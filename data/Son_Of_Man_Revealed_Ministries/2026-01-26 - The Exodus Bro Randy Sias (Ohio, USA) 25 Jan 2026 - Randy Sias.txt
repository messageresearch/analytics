TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Everyone's well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And rejoicing in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Rejoice in the Lord always." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And again, I say rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The human heart was made to be happy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The human heart was made to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then when our father reveals himself to us, &gt;&gt; he reveals our true identity, our purpose. Amen. What we are called for in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he reveals our earthly journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God's provided way in this time and hour is for us to serve him. Amen. Not in a Lutheran age, Wesian age, a Pentecostal age, &gt;&gt; but in the present time and season, the message of the hour. Amen. Where he has come to turn our hearts back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember the faith, we must have that same faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All the preaching, all the teaching and everything, if it doesn't produce the life doesn't produce the faith, then something is missing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If we don't see ourselves walking like the disciples walked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says the Holy Ghost is the action in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even as we examine our lives, see if we are sensitive to that still small voice and if we can hear the spirit speak to us and lead us and guide us. He was sent to lead us. The prophet says, I wonder why they ever got away from the Holy Ghost which was sent to lead and guide the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, but they set up other ministers and they set up programs and they set up so many things that will take the place of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you know the prophet finally tells us that the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A refilling. So even this morning, even as you come with your hearts, amen, in humbleness before the Lord, just empty out every thought. &gt;&gt; And right now, just say, "Lord, I have this expectation that you're going to speak to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God meets expectation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, there were many times Jesus and his disciples were walking along. Can you imagine blind Bartameus, he heard, the Bible says he heard the noise. Amen. And he asked them, "What is this noise?" &gt;&gt; He could have chose to remain silent. &gt;&gt; But when he understood that it was Jesus passing by, &gt;&gt; he said, "Son of David," he cried out. &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you're paying attention there, he said, "What is his noise?" So, there's a lot of noise. &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet says, "Wherever Jesus is, there's a lot of noise." &gt;&gt; So, in the midst of the noise, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; Barame's voice was louder than all of them that it caught the ears of Jesus. Amen. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; So in the midst of all the noise this morning, can you cry out? He is passing by this morning. &gt;&gt; You touch, reach out and touch him. Amen. So we are so blessed and privileged to have our pastor uh he's no no longer a pastor, former pastor Randy Sas. Am I saying that correctly? &gt;&gt; Saias. Amen. Let's give our dear pastor a hand. Welcome. [applause] Amen. I believe pastor is 75. 75 years old and still on the mission field. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's formerly a pastor of a church in Ohio in the USA. Not Ayo, Ohio. [clears throat] Ohio, USA. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh his [clears throat] dad was a former pastor there. He went on to the mission field. Amen. Then he was the pastor of the church and now he's gone onto the mission field. Now the prophet says a missionary is an apostle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't know why they stopped using the name apostle, but they call themselves missionary. But if you're looking for his gifting or his identification in the scripture, he's an apostle." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'd like to welcome our dear apostle this morning. I know he doesn't like the title or the name, but that is a scriptural reference to it. Praise the Lord. So, amen. He's been a blessing in the services that he's had thus far. I'll leave the rest of the introduction for our dear brother to come and introduce himself. and as the spirit leads. Amen. So, just want to welcome our dear sisters visiting with us this morning. Pray that you be blessed in the house of the Lord. Even our brother Tim at the back there. Amen. God will bless you and I pray you'll be blessed. How many of you have come at expectation? &gt;&gt; Amen. And God's going to meet that expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we come and say, "Lord, I refuse to leave here unless you bless me, unless you speak to me. &gt;&gt; We come with persistence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He will hear us." &gt;&gt; Amen. And so dear pastor, we give you a liberty this morning to speak even as the spirit gives utterance. Let's stand together and sing. There's room at the cross, room at the cross for you. Though millions have come, there is still room for one &gt;&gt; and there's room at the cross for you. There's room at the cross [music] for [singing] you. Amen. [music] There's [singing] room at [music] the cross for [singing] you. Oh man, [music] [singing] there's [music] still room for [singing] one [music] at the [singing] cross for [music] you. this room [music and singing] at the cross for [singing and music] you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] is good at the cross [music and singing] for you. And no [music] for the cross [music and singing] for me. Amen. Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. [singing] All glorious [music] [singing] for me [music] [singing] [music] for &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; and [singing] &gt;&gt; as we pray to the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Dear gracious heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we come to you in the precious name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, [music] &gt;&gt; we love that name, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; I've experienced, Father, being in a public place and walking around and hear somebody say the name of Jesus and my heart jumps. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I think he who is used that wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Do they know him? &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because that name means so [clears throat] very much to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] I'm thankful to be able to be here, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; with another [music] part of the family of God. A part of the family I have never met before. &gt;&gt; But Lord, we are all of one family. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you are our father. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; We all have one message to come and follow after your word. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; I pray that you will bless us this evening. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; May you use your servant, Lord, and bring bread of life. Lord, I could do nothing without you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I've seen you walk with me, Lord, and guide me through the years. And I'm asking once again that you will stand with [music] me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This poor servant, Lord, that bows his head, Lord, humbly before you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Knowing, Lord Jesus, that you are our strength, our breath, you are our life, you are wisdom, Lord. You are everything to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now we commit this service into your hands. Continue to bless each one that is here. In Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Let's open our [clears throat] our Bibles to uh Exodus 12 if you would. Thank you physicians. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We love the Lord very much with all of our hearts. since uh I've been serving the Lord for at least about 55 years now &gt;&gt; and uh back in 1971 uh I dedicated my life to the Lord. I was 21 years old and uh received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From my childhood, I was looking for something. I knew I needed it and I was at the altar many times praying. But this particular time I had just come back uh from Vietnam. I had been in the military. I had come back from Vietnam and there's some meetings. And uh when I went into those meetings, the power of God come in so strong. And I [clears throat] came in with a desire that I have to have God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I walked out of the meetings, I was walking around for four months saying, "What is different? Something has happened to me." And I realized that Lord, the Lord come into my heart. It changed me and I had such a hunger and a thirst to serve God. And that has never left me till this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If any of you today do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you think you have it. It's not what you think. &gt;&gt; When you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, there's a change. It comes in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know that change is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And someone would say to you, "Well, I don't believe that you have it. I don't believe you have the spirit of God." &gt;&gt; I know. I could say you weren't there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't know what I was. You don't know how God changed. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know what happened to me. &gt;&gt; You don't have to believe it because it wasn't for you. It was for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that needs to know whether it is correct or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh [clears throat] we'll read this portion of scripture and we'll have you to be seated. In Exodus 12, we're going to read verses 36- 38. And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. and they spoiled the Egyptians, which means they took of the things that they had the Egyptians had to be able to go on their journey. And the children of Israel journeyed from Ramsy's to uh Sukon and uh about 600,000 on on foot that were men besides children and a mix see it didn't didn't me didn't mention the women in other words there's children and women that is in there which comes out actually we understand it was about 2 million people that came out &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and it says here in verse 38 and a mixed multitude went up also again and flocks and herds even uh very much cattle. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh let's [clears throat] also look over into Numbers if you would. One verse of scripture. Numbers and that will be uh chapter 11. I'm sorry. one verse here in verse number four. Numbers 11:4. And the mixed multitude that was among them fell to fell to lusting. And the children of Israel also wept again and said, "Who shall give us flesh to eat?" May the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. Praise the Lord. [clears throat] We're going to title this today simply uh the uh the Exodus. And uh because everything we're going to be speaking about uh it's around the thoughts of the Exodus. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I said uh had speaking last night I said uh that God always has a purpose in what he does. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And uh the difficulty is that many times people do not understand the purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When they came out of Egypt they were very very happy people when they came out. [clears throat] uh because they are living leaving living a very difficult life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh just a small quote here from uh 1964 proving his word. Brother Ben says, "Yes, Joseph had much to go through uh to go down into Egypt, but God brought him out just exactly like he said. A very beautiful pipe of today. If we had time to go into it, I believe we have before uh here at the tabernacle went through uh I've gone through those thoughts. But God kept his word because uh they had to stay stay there in Egypt. It was hard for those Hebrew children down there in Egyptian bond Egypt which had been blessed and given the fruit of the land. the best place go to find out that they had to become slaves and those mothers to have to uh give into the h hands of the the Egyptian soldiers uh the fruit of the womb. In other words, that the the women, the Jewish women had to give up their children to the Egyptians that they would become soldiers, the fruit of the womb of their darling children baby and see him stand there, take a big knife and uh just cut it open and throw it over uh onto the ground, feed it to the the uh the gators, the crocodiles. Now it was hard thing to them to have to go through that. &gt;&gt; Yes. So it was they went from being a a Jewish people but they ended up going down into Egypt and it become to be a very hard life &gt;&gt; and very difficult and many times in pastoring I pastored for 47 years and there many have asked me well why did you resign and it was very simple is the Lord spoke to me and told me to resign. Yes, &gt;&gt; I um it was asked me, you know, the giving thoughts about possibly resigning and I thought I had responded with the words that I will never resign until the Holy Spirit speaks to me. And uh I've tried to resign before and the Lord would not let me. And uh I I knew that if I tried to do it again, he the Lord's going to stop me. So, he's going to have to speak to me directly. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, the very next night something happened and took place and confirmed that was actually the will of God and I just couldn't believe that I am actually supposed to resign really. It was a shock to me and uh so therefore in the next uh next while while I'm not going to give you all the details but um uh it took a while it was a little over a year before I actually resigned because when God tells you to do something there is a time &gt;&gt; to do it. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; There is the will of God and then there's a time for the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible tells us that the dead in Christ will rise first and we who remain shall be changed. But there's a time for that to take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we're waiting on the on the the timing of of God. &gt;&gt; And so that uh as I was looking to the Lord, it looked it came to be uh a little over a year and it came to January 1st, 2023 is when I resigned. Then after that I was praying to the Lord Lord what shall I do? I've resigned my position. I've taken all the authority and given it over to the uh uh uh present pastor now uh which is uh accepted by 100% of the people and uh he has the church and what am I supposed to do? What do I do? Well, the Lord sent somebody from another state and came and preached in our area. I went to that meeting and the Lord told me exactly right there in that message. Even the title of the message, I was wrestling with the will of God. Lord, what do I do? What do I do? And he comes to the pulpit and he says, the title of the message tonight is finding the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, I've had those things happen. And I have other testimonies where the Lord has come directly and spoken to me. And I find that is very important that we keep our eyes on the Lord regardless of what the circumstance. &gt;&gt; God always has a plan. When things are in its worst &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the when the when the time is very very dark &gt;&gt; and you think Satan has come and taken completely control, it's all in the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Satan can do nothing but follow the blueprint of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Anything he does falls right in line with the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan will go and do something and God has said, "Yep, I've been waiting for that. &gt;&gt; I knew you were going to do this." &gt;&gt; And so when we begin to learn that we are pre uh children of the king and that we are walking with him and he loves us very much. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So now it gives us a courage that when we get very sick, &gt;&gt; I've had some uh uh physical conditions and they were had been very bad for me. But in the midst of it all, I said, "No, &gt;&gt; Lord, I know you called me to walk with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You told me in your word that you have healed me. &gt;&gt; This thing has to go. The body [applause] has to obey. &gt;&gt; It has to obey because you have said so. &gt;&gt; The devil, you have called me to preach the gospel and I can't preach the gospel in this condition. So therefore, something has to change. Amen. Wonderful. [applause] &gt;&gt; I don't care about the pain. I don't care about the symptoms. I don't care about anything. I know that God is going to bring a change. I'm standing here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make any difference what the circumstance. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It was uh uh sometime in about last July. Uh, I was planning to go to the Congo and uh uh the the Congolese embassy had my passport and had not issued my visa and I only had a a few days before like about uh just about 7 to 10 days before I'm leaving and uh I they have not even informed me. They've had it for a couple of months and they have not even informed me of what the status of my passport is. So I told my wife, I said, I'm going to have to go to Washington, Washington DC, which is uh it's a 7-hour drive for me. And uh I'm going to have to go to Washington tomorrow. And she says, "Washington?" I says, "Yes." I says, "I have to get that passport and that visa." I said, "What am I going to do?" And I was all nervous about it. And I'm thinking, "What am I going to do? I've already paid for the tickets and I'm going to lose the money for the tickets and and what if they don't give me the passport? What if I don't have the visa? What if they my brain is just running away? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I just stopped and I just uh pulled back and I said, "No, I don't care what the situation is. God has always taken care of everything." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's always taking care of everything. And I said, "So somehow it'll work out, but that doesn't stop the brain." &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; the brain is still going on and thinking and thinking. &gt;&gt; And why I'm giving you just a little bit a little bit of my testimony is to encourage you regardless of what you're going through. God is an omnipotent God. &gt;&gt; He He care if he cares for the sparrows, he cares for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, never think that he's very far away. He knows everything that you're going through. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, also along with going on that trip, I knew that I was going to have some expenses and I didn't have the money for those expenses. And, uh, so I I I here at this particular time, I am very concerned about this passport. So, I know that in Washington there's a church that is there. I thought, well, I haven't seen the pastor in a long time. I'm going to go to church there that night and visit the pastor and then I'm going to go and take care of that business about the passport. So, I do that and uh I go to the uh uh church there and have fellowship with the pastor and the people there. It was a wonderful time with the Lord. And I'm walking out and uh we pastor and I were the last ones. We were talking so much and I'm about to walk out the door and uh the pastor says, "Brother, here here's something for your missionary trip." And he gives me $2,000. You don't know what it is, so I'll tell you how much it was. Uh he gave me $2,000. I said, "Brother," he said, "No, no, no, no, no. You take this. You take this for the for the work of God." And uh I did not expect that. &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for that. I I had no idea that this was going to happen, but I needed that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand what's happening? &gt;&gt; God arranged it. I had to go for that passport, but there was somebody else who's going to give a donation to help me on the trip. But everything was just working working out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I when I got there's so many details and I'm going to make it short because we have other things we want to talk about. &gt;&gt; But as I'm as I'm I'm now I actually I was leave left home and I was about maybe about halfway to Washington and uh No, no, no, no. I was just leaving my home and I was headed to Washington. I'm determined I'm going to make this trip and I get a a phone call from Washington. A phone call from No, no, no. Stop think. You ever have that problem? [laughter] Your brain just goes off. &gt;&gt; No. I got a phone call from the Congo, [clears throat] Democratic Republic of Congo, and the brother in the Congo says, "I hear you got trouble with your visa." Uh, yes. He says, "I'm going to make a phone call for you." And he says, "People are going to be calling you to get that thing straightened around." Really? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? I'm [laughter] just leaving my home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know I'm on my way. But he calls me and says, "I hear you have trouble getting your visa." I said, "Yes, I do." &gt;&gt; And so when I did go to the uh the embassy, they had to sit there for a little while, but it was all straightened around. All in all, I'm on my way back home. I got another $2,000 for the trip. Everything is paid for, taken care of, because when I got to the Congo, I had a $2,000 uh to $2,400 bill that needed to be paid for different experience expenses that were there &gt;&gt; and so on. But the Lord took care of all the expenses. I got [applause] my passport. I got my visa for everything. But brother Randy, Brother Randy saying, "What am I going to do? What am I going to do? I don't know how I'm going to pay for this. I don't know about the visa. I don't know about the pastor. What am I going to do? &gt;&gt; See, I'm just like me and you are. &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] what we have to do, we have to get a hold of ourselves. &gt;&gt; God is not going to stop you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's not going to stop your brain. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You have to deny yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Deny your own thought &gt;&gt; and turn back to the word of God and say, "He will take care of it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. He will give. He is in fact as far as healing goes. He has already healed me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; God cannot heal you. &gt;&gt; Let that get into your heart this morning. &gt;&gt; God cannot heal you. He can't do something he's already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, why is this con condition going on? It's because you don't believe. Oh, I do believe. No, no, no, no, no. You think you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. You asking the question, why is this continuing on? Is confessing unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you believe, there's no question. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; I believe it's done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the devil can wrestle that away from me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So life is very difficult. uh there the the people there in Egypt they had a very very difficult time. Uh it it wasn't an easy life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh maybe some of you I'm not sure this is my first time in uh uh in South Africa. There's a brother a brother brother Arun Kumar who heard I was in India and he was I heard that I was going to uh uh South Africa and he told me he said you go to South Africa I'm going with you want to go with me he said yes so he is here in South Africa and uh but he's been tr troubled with bronchitis he's having a very difficult time right at this moment and I told him I said you know Brother, I said the children of God, they uh they they suffer persecution and they suffer trouble. Life is full of trouble. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, brother. Yes, life is full of trouble." I said, "But we've read the end of the book." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We know what the end is going to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, and if we really believe his word, we know what the outcome is going to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, if I got this condition, what if I die? You're still healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; You think God is going to receive cake take in a sick body? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. &gt;&gt; You just stepped from here. You stepped into his glory and you're going to be perfect. Everything. &gt;&gt; You don't have to. You're you're you're healed one way or another. It doesn't make you It doesn't change anything. Glory to his holy name. And so you see when they were coming out of Egypt, this was a a uh a a a time a a a time had come because God had given Moses Abraham a promise. And that promise was that your seed will be in a a land that they are strangers of and they won't be there. But I will bring them out uh in the fourth generation and I will bring them out and take them into a promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this many this period of time has gone by and now they have been in the uh in Egypt for 400 years and the only life that they know is slavery. &gt;&gt; That is all that they know. &gt;&gt; They don't know anything else. And I'm going to jump ahead of our story. They don't know anything about fighting. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They don't know anything about being soldiers. &gt;&gt; And you see before we come to Christ, the only thing that we know is this world. The only thing that we know is to live life the best way we know how. But when you come to Christ, Christ wants to live in us. &gt;&gt; He wants to live his life in us. &gt;&gt; St. Paul said it's not I that lives but it's Christ that lives [clears throat] within me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is God's ultimate goal that he would be be in us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so as we are in this world uh and we don't know anything about God, it is very very difficult just like uh uh they were there in Egypt. They didn't know anything else. If you tell them about the promised land, they can't even imagine what this promised land is going to be about. And God, you tell people about this glory in this message. And people can't comprehend the glory that is there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And many people that are are have come into the land, this is actually further into the story, [laughter] but many people have come into the land and they still don't understand what God has for them. &gt;&gt; Yes. you know that they went into the promised land and they did not drive out the enemy. &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, you know, they're they're good people. We're not going to drive them out." No, no, no, no. You are not to sit down and and and and develop a life of compromise with the enemy. &gt;&gt; You are to drive them out. This land belongs to you &gt;&gt; and no one else is supposed to be there. But they did not understand the purpose of God though they are in the land. And it's the same way where people have come into the message they don't know the complete [laughter] purpose of God in what we are to become. Yes. You see? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so as they are are are going to to come out, we know very very much the story about how that the Lord had spoken to Moses and uh uh God made Moses God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Before the people. I know when this uh this was the Lord brought this greatly to my attention. I came to my our assembly at home. I was still pastoring and I had told them that uh uh I said Moses was God. And I just laid it there. I says Moses was God. And the church went quiet. My my assembly doesn't just shout just over for no reason at all. And they went quiet. I said, "You're quiet. You should be praising the Lord." I And I emphasized AND SAID AGAIN, "MOSES WAS GOD." OH, because I I just could sense their mind. But oh, he was a man. He's not God. But no, no, no, no. Mo God called him God. So therefore, he was God before the people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Even even now you're wondering which which direction is he going? &gt;&gt; You're already wondering just like they had done. But you see, God had taken this man and lifted him up. This sinner lifted him up to a position that he was God. &gt;&gt; He was so much God that he rebuked God. &gt;&gt; And he said that don't kill them because if you killed them, they're going to say you were able to bring them out of Egypt, but you couldn't take them into the promised land. And the Lord said, "AT YOUR WORD, I will do." &gt;&gt; I will DO ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. God listened to Moses. &gt;&gt; When did a man ever rebuke God? Nobody has ever done that, but Moses did. &gt;&gt; Exactly. True. &gt;&gt; And and brother Ben said that uh God had to listen to Moses because he made Moses God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So now we as we study the story of Moses, we find out Moses said God had spoken to him that he would rise up another prophet likened unto himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; So then therefore there's going to be another prophet that's going to be rise up who is also going to be God before the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see as brother Brandon very plainly says if you go back to faith is a substance that's in 1947 you find out that he says there he says was Moses God uh was it Moses or was it God in Moses that delivered the people? &gt;&gt; It was God in Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't Moses but it was God. What made Moses God? The word was placed in Moses. &gt;&gt; That's what made him God. &gt;&gt; We know that the Lord uh even through this message has told us that we are uh Messiah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are we are made gods. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As we go along here, let let me just kind of give you some insight. When brother Brandham was uh the Lord told brother Brandham to speak to the squirrels and he spoke to the squirrels and spoke not to but created that squirrels were created. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we know the storm. We know that he spoke to the bull the bees. He spoke to the storm. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He spoke uh about his wife having a tumor. The Lord said you say say what you will and it'll be done. He says when they go to put the knife to her side that the tumor will be gone. And that's exactly what happened. &gt;&gt; What was God doing in those moments? &gt;&gt; He was making it was for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was making him God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now many people have [laughter] taken this too far. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is God. No. Brother Brandham was a man. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; But you see what makes the difference is God in the man. &gt;&gt; God is using the man. What makes the differences in in your life is God in you. &gt;&gt; It's no longer you where it's God in you doing the work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; People put too much emphasis on brother Brandham. Brother Brandham is in the grave. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, but the God that was in brother Brandham is still here. Amen. Amen. And he wants that work the same way in your &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You [clears throat] have a circumstance that that you have and uh uh he wants you to speak to the circumstances. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're like I had to do body, you've got to change. You've got this situation in I got this situation in the body. BONNIE, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE cuz the Bible says you you have to change. Yes. &gt;&gt; And well, brother, that means we can speak anytime we want. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; If you watch Brother Renom that when he spoke, it was always by the leadership of God. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you don't let your mind stray. Don't don't think I'm just talking here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm talk I'm talking about a level that God is calling all of us to. Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know that the Bible says, well, let me say this verse. How many times have we prayed and say asking the Lord, we we desire the Lord to do this situation? How many have done that? How many pray that Lord, I'm praying. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Let me see your hand. &gt;&gt; Ah, that's it. Don't get &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I did. No, you see, we have prayed, BUT THE BIBLE SAYS that we when he was crucified, he said, "It is finished." And he rose to the right hand of the father. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he sat down. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what is he doing there &gt;&gt; when he sat down? waiting, &gt;&gt; waiting that every enemy will become his foottool. It doesn't say he was going to get up. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I want you to do this. No, no, no, no, no. You do. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT GOD IS LOOKING FOR. IF HE WERE TO stand right here and he said, "LORD, I HAVE THIS. WOULD YOU DO THIS FOR ME?" HE SAID, "NO, you do it." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SAY, LORD, I DON'T HAVE ANY POWER. HE SAYS, I GAVE YOU THE POWER. [applause] &gt;&gt; I gave you everything that you need. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I GAVE YOU THE PROMISE. I GAVE YOU MY SPIRIT. WHAT MORE CAN I DO FOR YOU? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You have the power to overcome. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, as we see uh in every church age, the the promise is to to overcome. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you can't be an overcomer, you can't be one of his &gt;&gt; because he only has overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here they are coming out of Egypt. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And oh my, they are so happy they're coming out of Egypt. They're excited. Now, people come into the we come into come to Christ and we're just uh in a big jubilee time. It's so rejoicing, but we have no idea the trials that we're going to run into. &gt;&gt; And especially I I remember many years ago that the air was just buzzing. This was a uh a period of time that was much before any of you were born. But the air was buzzing with the message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; People were listening to the message and reading the books of the message and talking about the message. Oh my. Praise the Lord. Glory to God. And now we have so many uh uh factions and so many divisions in the message and one believes this and one believes that and they have all their different ideas and so much confusion has come and uh many of us can hardly believe that we would come to all of this. &gt;&gt; Exactly true. And [clears throat] today as like our brother, the pastor and I were talking last night and we were talking and asking the question, is it possible that God, the angel of the Lord can be right in our midst and people are not sensing it. I Yes, brother. That's exactly true. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord was walking right in our midst. And because this is a new generation. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. You see, and we become, and using the pastor's uh uh uh terminology, we become desensitized. We're not uh sensitive enough to know God is in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And wherever wherever Jesus was, something happened. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Demons didn't like to be around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PHARISEES DIDN'T LIKE HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Everywhere he everywhere he went, if he was blind, he's no longer blind. If he's deaf, he's no longer dead. If he was dead, HE'S NO LONGER DEAD. &gt;&gt; Something always [cheering and applause] happened. &gt;&gt; And many times WE CAN COME TO CHURCH AND the the spirit of God IS MOVING AMONGST US AND WE GO BACK IN the same condition. &gt;&gt; Why does that happen? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN? IS BECAUSE WE'RE DESENSITIZED. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; brother Brennan. I listen I studied brother Brennan uh and I watched him very closely and I HEAR HIM COMPELLING THE PEOPLE CRYING OUT TO THE PEOPLE. HE'S HERE my friend. He's here. Just believe. [laughter] Just believe he's here. He's here. And I hear that heart groaning AND KNOWING THAT GOD HIMSELF, HE SAID, "DON'T YOU SEE THIS light standing over here? &gt;&gt; HE'S RIGHT HERE. IS MOVING IN THE BUILDING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; I know that uh in one of the services he was going to uh uh get into the message and he he he said, "Let's turn to uh such and such a a portion in the scriptures and uh uh they were turning there and he stopped." Oh, you sister there in the back. He says, "Something just happened to you." &gt;&gt; He didn't read the scriptures. He hasn't even started preaching. Yes, &gt;&gt; sister. You're in the back. Something just happened to you. &gt;&gt; You felt something, didn't you? And uh he said, "He just healed you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You just touched the throne of God." I said, "Look at that." You see, that person wasn't waiting on the preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. They weren't waiting on worship. They weren't waiting for hands to be laid on them. They knew God was in the building and they reached out and touched God and got their their &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, we become so de desensitized and we're always waiting on something. You don't have to wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day I hope our life changed. WHY DON'T WE START NOW? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T WE START TODAY? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Instead of staying in Egypt, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. LET'S GET OUT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; God sent the deliverer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. SO THEY'RE GOING OUT OF EGYPT AND NOW THEY ARE JUST so happy. We are no longer going to be slaves. We don't have to make any more bricks. It becomes so boring. They've been making bricks every day. Every day. And building a kingdom for somebody else. Now we're not going to be here for be a slave anymore. We're going out. And now they come down to the Red Sea. Uh the very place God wants them to be because they have to go through their baptism. Yes, &gt;&gt; there's mountains on the either side of it and the Egyptians are behind and what do they do? They begin to complain and they say, "OH, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? We're going to die. We're going to die. We should have stayed in Egypt. You mean you want to go back to being a slave? &gt;&gt; He just set you free. But look, WE'RE GOING TO DIE. LOOK AT THE CONDITION THAT WE'RE IN. Didn't he uh protect you from the plagues? Amen. Was there any flies in your house? [laughter] Amen. Was there was there any darkness in your house? You look at the supernatural THAT HAPPENED. YOU MEAN GOD cannot take care of you here? THAT'S THE PROBLEM OF US. WE we see many signs. WE SEE THE EVIDENCE OF GOD WORKING. BUT WHEN WE GET INTO THE MOMENT, WE CANNOT BELIEVE GOD for the moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT DID MOSES SAY? HE SAID, "BE STILL." YES. &gt;&gt; And that's one of the major things we need to do in our walk with God. WE NEED TO SETTLE our spirit down. We need to SETTLE DOWN AND START FOCUSING ON THE PURPOSE THAT GOD HAS IN OUR LIFE AND THE VICTORY THAT HE HAS GIVEN UNTO US. He said, "BE STILL AND WATCH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WATCH THE SALVATION OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO? YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT WATCH [screaming] GOD AT WORK. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ONCE GOD MANIFEST HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, where where's OUR ESCAPE WHEN THEY DID NOT KNOW the escape &gt;&gt; is in front of them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the escape was in the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when uh when Moses had uh stretched out the staff and through the night, the waters opened up. They in the morning they were very surprised to see this path through the through the waters. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So there they go. And you know it's such a complete [clears throat] supernatural thing that took place. Yes. Yes. Yes. Opening up the waters. But listen though that ground should have been muddy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That ground has laid under that water for ages. Yes. &gt;&gt; And it should have been muddy and it was dust. &gt;&gt; God sucked all the water out. They didn't even get [applause] any mud on their shoes. &gt;&gt; And they walk to the other side. And when THEY GET OVER NOW, [screaming] THEY REJOICE. AND I could see Moses. Uh, now you rejoice. You weren't rejoicing on the other side. But after you see God, God can come and deliver you. now that you're going to rejoice. You should have known what God could do before that. &gt;&gt; So the next time you run into a situation and it looks like uh that there is no hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand there is hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that happened to brother Brennan. &gt;&gt; You know when his first wife died, you know what her name was? &gt;&gt; Hope. And he was miserable because hope was gone. &gt;&gt; And he was so depressed and discouraged because hope was gone that God had to take him to the other side and show him hope still lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We get into the same situation. &gt;&gt; We think there's no hope. Hope still exists. Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly true. Praise the Lord Jesus. [clears throat] Amen. We may be a child. We may be an heir, but we do not know how to cross uh access the glory and the power of God. You see, that is the the problem with the people through the ages. that God calls unto his people, but the people of God do not know how to access that power, that glory. &gt;&gt; It's very simple. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's very simple. And it just takes faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you have to understand what faith is. &gt;&gt; Faith does not ask questions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't ask questions. Faith just sees the word, says that's it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will ask you this. How many know without a doubt in your heart that God sent a prophet in this day? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think that's not important to lift your hand, but the devil seeing whether you lift your hand, whether you believe it or not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see, [clears throat] you you want you want to let Satan know anytime you're asked a question like that, you need to let Satan see, I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See that hand right there? I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you believe that he has uh he God has sent a prophet in his day. Can somebody talk you out of that? &gt;&gt; No. You really believe that? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it that's in your heart? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, Lord. that says I know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; And no one you know that no one can change your thoughts. Some of the younger ones they might say well yeah I believe it but I I don't know. I don't know a lot about this stuff. They just need to be more secure. &gt;&gt; But you see many of us have come to a place we are anchored. I'm using that as an example. &gt;&gt; Yes. that uh we have become so anchored that that faith cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot move me over that. I know that this is thus said the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you don't realize you're wrong. Look, just leave me alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe this and it's not changing. &gt;&gt; No matter what you say, you're wasting your time. &gt;&gt; You see, that is faith. Yes. &gt;&gt; Faith does not question. &gt;&gt; Faith does not reason. &gt;&gt; And to access the glory and the power of God, that's the kind of faith you have to use. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And when you begin to ask questions and uh uh like saying, "Well, why isn't there changes? Why isn't something happening?" That's Satan attacking you and he's shaking your faith. And you see, he was he said he would shake the heavens and the earth and he's going to shake you. &gt;&gt; And the trial of your faith is more precious than gold. So the question is, do you really have faith or is it just your imagination? &gt;&gt; Amen. So when they came out, they did not know about the [clears throat] I'm sorry. They didn't know uh about the glory of God. They just the only thing they could see is the moment we're at the Red Sea. We're going to we're going to die. They come to the waters of Myra next and that they're oh, we're here. The waters are poisoned. We're going to die. Each moment, each step that they took, they come to a an obstacle and oh, we're in trouble. What are we going to do? What are we going to do? It was because it was a mixed multitude. Yes. &gt;&gt; Not everybody's going to be a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And out of that out of that group that were coming was we understand that there were two million. That's why you remember brother Brandham preached a one in a million. &gt;&gt; There are two million that come out and out of that there was only two that believe. &gt;&gt; There's only two that believe. So it came out with a mixed mixed multitude. And we are not to walk with God and uh and walk with the Lord and say, "Well, my brother over here, he believes like that and you know, I got respect to him. I have fellowship with the the brother and so this is this is what must be right. He believes a little differently, but I'm going to lean to what he is saying because it must be right." No, no, no, no. It's you and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's you and God. You have to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It's not what the other brother thinks, the other sister thinks. It has to be you and God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that that's the only way that faith can be anchored in Jesus Christ that you are in tune with God. Am I making any sense? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to his holy name. &gt;&gt; You see, people were uh uh God is desiring. He's bringing us not only from denominational world uh he's bringing us from just the world of sin and bringing in us into something that is magnificent and glorious. Hallelujah. And uh [clears throat] give me a second here. in [clears throat] the message uh uh the great warrior Joshua it's in 1955 he says and now uh God [clears throat] uh God told Moses go out now and look around and get a man out of every tribe and send them over into the promised land just a a few days after he had left the Egypt. Send them over now and spy out the land and then come back and give a report. &gt;&gt; Amen. COME BACK AND GIVE A testimony of what you experienced about being in that land. And when they went over across the little river Jordan and went over into the promised land and begin to look around to see whether it was a lean or whether uh it was a good down Yes, we're down at uh we're in paragraph 19 right now. And when they went out over across the little river Jordan and went over into the promised land and begin to look around to see whether it was lean or whether it was good or whether it was of grapes or whether it was of fruits, when they come back, they climbed up uh and cut down a a bunch of grapes that taken two men uh to pack them. But a bunch of grapes, I think of a land with a curse on it. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; uh uh will grow something like that. What would it grow when the curse is off of it? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; My my my &gt;&gt; it was under the enemy. See, it was under the dominion of the uh uh of the um Canaanites. And now the the Jews were going to come in and take over the lion land. And if it uh is uh producing grapes as such under the Canaanites, what is it going to do under the blessings of God? &gt;&gt; I think if a land they curse, it will grow grow something like that that will go to grow when the curse is off. Uh here they come back. But when they looked over into the land and seen all the Philistines and the Amorites and the Hivites and the parasites and all of those fellows all walled up and sitting in their big kingdoms and so forth, they they quivered or they were afraid in the in their boots, they come back and said, "Oh, when we when they called a council and brought all the children of Israel out, beautiful type now, and they took up and said, uh, the land is beautiful. It's wonderful. It would be good if we could uh have a revival like that. But when we just can't do it, we just can't do it. That's all. Oh, we're just a prey to them. Uh say my Well, they're they're way bigger. They are bigger. They're giants. Why? They're giants and so forth. And they're walled in and it's impossible for us to take them. Oh, why did you bring us out of our churches out into this kind of land? And exactly what I am talking about is when they come into this promised land, they have all these reasoning, [clears throat] all of these questions that are going on. God wants us to go in there and he's telling us there are many blessings that are there and we see that it is true. But why uh h how are we going to do it? because the devil attacks me. I have so many demons around me and I don't know what to do. I have this trial. I have that trial and I don't know if I'm going to make it because I have to fight here and I have to fight there. But you see the uh the Lord had already told us resist the enemy and he will flee from. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, instead of complaining about our trials, complaining about the situation, we should recognize that we are fulfilling the promises [laughter] of God that have been made from ages in the past. &gt;&gt; We are fulfilling scriptures today. &gt;&gt; You [laughter] are sitting here fulfilling scriptures. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T REALIZE IT, BUT YOU ARE FULFILLING SCRIPTURES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE GOD HAS SAID THERE WILL BE A PEOPLE THAT WILL COME AND BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise the Lord. I want you to notice this come in my mind just then when Moses sent those 10 spies over. It was in in the harvest of grapes, harvest time. perfect type of Pentecost, first fruits, Pentecost in and in in gathering, first harvest. And when they was at Kadesh Barnea at judgment, you know why? I know that for me that was always a confusing thing when brother Brandon would say this that going to Kadesh Barnea, it's the judgment. Why? Why is that the judgment? Because they had to make a decision. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And God was going to judge them for their decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this land worthy to take? &gt;&gt; And they and to to embrace. And they made a decision and said, "No, it is not worth it. It's not worth our efforts." Do you realize how much energy, how much effort we have to fight giants? &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to fight demons. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We all have to fight demons. &gt;&gt; But you know, as I said last night, is that one person, one soul &gt;&gt; armed with the the word of God, the Holy Spirit in this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. All of those demons are no match for that one. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And in this age, there's 200,000,000 more demons &gt;&gt; than what there was in ages past. &gt;&gt; That is 200 million demons on top of what was what there was. WHAT CHANCE? WHAT OPPORTUNITY DO WE REALLY HAVE? &gt;&gt; But you see what God has given us. All of those demons, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; are no match for one another. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has given us such power to make them all free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we're able to set your &gt;&gt; and sit here in the presence of God because of that power he has given unto us. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; There are many pe I I I know of people that have come in and out of church for many years. uh uh in in our uh place at home and they come into church and they wanted to serve the Lord and what happened the world pulled them back out. They came back in again and they've tried to serve the Lord and the world pulled them back out again. They cannot re resist the demons that are pulling on them. And one man I'm thinking about how many it's been probably 35 years or so that this man come in contact with the message and he he was out in he come to the message went out into the world and he come back again and then one day he just disappeared and he was gone and and I never got any word from him. I don't know where he went to or anything like that. And uh I think what happened? He was doing so well listening to the word of God and the glory of God moving in his moving in his life and uh and yet still he could not did not have the strength to continue on with Jesus. We have to fight demons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not a problem. &gt;&gt; I think it might be Yeah, I think it just come back on. &gt;&gt; There's something loose. It's It's now back on. It wasn't my brain [laughter] for a change. You keep an eye on me, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You see, I spoke last night about gratitude. We should be very grateful for what the Lord is has done for us. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel that way? &gt;&gt; To think you he called you. &gt;&gt; Yes. by you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you something special? If you look in the mirror, if you're like me, I said, "Oh, Randy, you're a wretched soul. You're you're you're a very important preacher." But Jesus loved you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus loved me. &gt;&gt; And I'm so grateful that the Lord would call me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you know, I I I look on myself and I don't see myself as a very I I don't see myself as a very good person. I get many compliments and uh many times being called such a a man of God and I I have to bow my head and I said Lord it's only by your grace &gt;&gt; I I I am actually actually nothing and in all of what I am to think that the Lord loved me anyway but you know I I learned why he loves me. &gt;&gt; Yes. why he loves me. And this is not our subject for today, but uh why he loves me is because like Mary, when Mary was told that she was going to have a child &gt;&gt; without a man, &gt;&gt; she believed it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She believed an impossible message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God always comes with an impossible message. A message that's hard to believe by the world, but it's still true. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when Mary uh uh uh heard the message from the angel, she took it and she believed it with all of her heart. &gt;&gt; And when this message came to me, I have to bow my head, Lord, I believe this message. I know it is true. I know it's thus sayeth the Lord, and I'm staying with it. And I realized that's the reason why the Lord chose me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why the Lord would choose you because before the foundations of the world, he already knew you were going to take this path and cling to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let's say praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's say praise the Lord again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's finish this here. And uh and when they was at Kadesh Barnea at the at the judgment, then it was to be determined on whether they could go over and get the Holy Spirit or not into the land of promise. Where they promise? Uh yet you say, "Is that a promise?" And yes, Peter said, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far far off. Uh uh even Chicago as many as the Lord your God shall call. We got too many people to saying uh it's too hard. We can't do it. We can it's harvest. This is the reason that they got this big bunch of grapes and brought it back for for a heaven. I can see Caleb and Joshua with that on their shoulders, marching down through there, just singing the Jubilee song. Uh they had the evidence. They could prove that it was a good land. They brought it back and give all the children a grape. Now, I like this part here. They give all they brought it back and give all the children a grape if they wanted one off of one cluster. Just look what a bunch of of grapes uh that they had. Now Joshua and Caleb, but when they heard all this murmuring, the people saying, "Oh, it can't be done. It can't be." Caleb run out in the midst of the people and quiet them and said, "It yes, it can be done." &gt;&gt; Joshua stood by him and certainly uh it can be. God's given it to us. Amen. I I like that. Yes, sir. What was it? They were potentially born in Christ. They had a knowledge of the word and the word become manifested. Remember, every one of those Israelites had the word of God preached to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Every one of them had the word of God preached to them. But it only had taken effect upon Caleb and Joshua to realize what it was all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so what we find is taking place. What we find is taking place, they came up to that promised land and at Kadesh Barnea there are those that made a decision that we cannot go into the land. So what happens? They wandered around in the wilderness for 40 years and they those died &gt;&gt; and God raised up a new generation. Now, as they come up, I want you to picture as we're coming near a close now, I want you to take notice as they come up to the promised land, they had not matured. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They were slaves. &gt;&gt; And they had not matured because they were going to have to become warriors. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They were going to have to fight. You see those that are in the kingdom of God that those especially those that are going to walk in this message, you're going to have to be a warrior. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And every demon is going to hell going to try to keep you from walking in this message. That's right. &gt;&gt; For me, the many years I've just so thankful for the faith that the Lord has given me and I was speaking about it last night and share it with you. You know the cloud in 1963. They are telling us that today that was not a cloud. It's not a cloud. Uh or uh I'm sorry. It's not seven angels. It's not seven angels. It's a rocket that created the cloud. &gt;&gt; And I I was telling the church at home, I said, "Well, they're saying it is a rocket that it that did all of this." And uh but I have to say this, praise the Lord for the rocket. &gt;&gt; Well, why would you say praise the Lord for rocket? Because it's a supernatural rocket. &gt;&gt; If you turn the picture, it still shows Christ. &gt;&gt; You can't change that. &gt;&gt; And you see it that you have to be a warrior in this message. Many people in the message are not maturing. And what is happening? They become people that are in the in in the gospel and we are deceiving ourselves and we're rejoicing and praising. You remember brother Ben said that about a boy that was in the graveyard and he's whistling as he goes through the graveyard. And what he's trying to do, he's trying to encourage himself because he is afraid &gt;&gt; and he hasn't got the courage of what uh uh what one would expect. And his whistling shows that. And people today, they're shouting and praising the Lord and just so happy. Praise the Lord. Thank God we're in the light. Show and so on. But you see, you have to be a warrior. &gt;&gt; You can't deceive your way into the kingdom of God. It doesn't work. &gt;&gt; It You see, we can we can listen to the teachings, and we're getting a little little deeper here. We you can listen to the teachings and and all of this, but God wants to work in your life. He wants to make a warrior out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not just walk around and praise the Lord. We're free. We're not in the world. We're not in the organization, but we're in the message. But what's the purpose? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES GOD WANT TO MAKE OUT OF YOU? &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A SLAVE ANYMORE. THEN WHAT ARE YOU? WHAT DOES GOD WANT TO MAKE OUT OF YOU? WHAT DOES HE WANT TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE? He pro he PICKED THIS UP OUT OF THE WORLD. Many of you young maybe grew up in a Christian home, but still God wants to make something out OF YOU. AND WHAT DOES GOD WANT TO DO WITH YOU? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He wants you to make you a powerhouse. &gt;&gt; A VESSEL THAT IS FULL OF POWER THAT DEMONS are afraid of. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And see, when they came, there was only two THAT GOD HAD FULFILLED THAT WORK IN THEM BECAUSE JOSHUA AND CALEB, and if you'll notice that Caleb means dog &gt;&gt; or a gentile, and the other one was uh standing there was Joshua, but Joshua didn't speak. It was Caleb doing the speaking. &gt;&gt; Joshua means Jesus. You see, these were the Jews that came out. But who is actually going to go in and take that promised land? It's going to be the Gentiles walking with Jesus is going to go in and take the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD TO RAISE UP A NEW GROUP of people that were willing to go across the the Jordan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Joshua said, "We are more than able." Well, when this new group came up, they were believers and knew that they could cross the river. BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE RIVER, what's the river's name? Jordan. &gt;&gt; Death. &gt;&gt; When they came to death, the Bible says it was a harvest time. And Jordan was overflowing. &gt;&gt; AND JORDAN IS SAYING, "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PASS OVER. You cannot. YOU STEP IN HERE and I will sweep you away." You remember in Revelations 12, it said the dragon opened up his mouth and sent a a a flood. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; After the woman, there is a flood at harvest time. And they're wanting now to go over in the across the river, go into the promised land. And the ene the the the Jordan is full waiting to sweep away the people of God. But they the the Lord said, "Call the priest, BRING THE ARK of the covenant and tell them to go and stand in the Jordan." And those uh those priests went out and they stood right there in the Jordan. &gt;&gt; We are NOT MOVING JORDAN. We are here and we are going to Passover and we have the ark of the covenant here. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You see friends, all of these events have a message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And that message is for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are not just stories. &gt;&gt; This is a message. And we can see ourselves in these events taking place. &gt;&gt; Jordan is standing there and does not want them to cross. But they the Lord told him, "Take the ark of the covenant, stand in the Jordan, and watch what happens." The Jordan opened up and they crossed over on dry ground. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. They they get to the other side. And after they get to the other side, Joshua uh tells them, "We're going to stop right here and we're going to have a ceremony. We're going to have circumcision. We can't live in this land without circumcision." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We need a meeting of getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We can't live in this land without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And so there they are. They had the they went through the time of circumcision. And now they're going along. They come up to Jericho. And uh uh and here is the time of uh [clears throat] uh uh uh Gideon uh Joshua. And he is standing there. [clears throat] And what happens? Uh all of a sudden I'm getting I'm I'm going to lay down my pride here. It was uh Joshua at Jericho or Gideon. Joshua. Thank you. See, just smack the devil right in the head. I'm going to lay down my pride and I'm going to find out the answers. Yet, I I get embarrassed when these things happen. When my thoughts start to get blurred, &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about, but I my thoughts start getting blurred and I get embarrassed and I thought, I've learned Satan just get away. What's the answer to this? Okay, now we can go on. Joshua was standing there and see the point is is that uh this angel brother Benham said there was an angel leaning against the wall with a sword in his hand &gt;&gt; and Joshua came up to him and says are you for us or are you for our adversary &gt;&gt; and he says I'm none I am the captain of the Lord of hosts &gt;&gt; and what he was saying he says I am the captain of Israel you did not cross Jordan brotherham says that that a uh that angel was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see THAT? THEY DIDN'T CROSS OVER THE JORDAN uh on their own. It was that angel that brought them across the Jordan. I am the captain. I brought you across the Jordan. I brought you through the waters of Myra. I was the one that was with you at that time. I was with Abraham when he came out of Caldes. I was with with this one when they were doing that. I was with this one. I am the captain of the host. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And the captain of the host is here now. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE WALKS AMONGST US. AND IT IS JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HE'S STANDING THERE WITH HIS sword in his HAND WAITING TO CHOP EVERY DEVIL TO PIECES. &gt;&gt; OH, praise the name of the Lord. TO KNOW THAT THAT LIVING JESUS CHRIST is here amongst us just as well. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. NOW AFTER THE DEATH OF JOSHUA WHERE WE COME TO A TIME THERE WAS A GENERATION that rose up that did not know God and did not know the works of God. And I am believing today that we're in that type of generation. Though we're in the message, CHILDREN HAVE GROWN UP IN THE MESSAGE BUT DO NOT KNOW THE works of God nor of the knowing God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AMEN. PRAISE THE LORD. BUT THE THING of it is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and &gt;&gt; WE HAVE COME THIS FAR ONLY BY THE GRACE of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are many things we can talk about. We can get into uh uh uh talking about the seven seals and the seven church ages and many different things that we could we could talk about. But friends, YOU IF WE CANNOT LIVE A simple Christian life, ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS don't mean anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we can sit down and explain all the details about the message and you don't have victory in your life, &gt;&gt; it's no good. &gt;&gt; As I've been talking here, maybe you're thinking, "Well, Brother Ry's preaching a very simple message today. Did you want something complicated? Did you want something uh something that takes us that deep far into the message or or something like that? What were you looking for? &gt;&gt; But you see, just to get something to give you something that will reach into your heart that you'll go home say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I want to be a soldier for God. &gt;&gt; I want to be a soldier in this message. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be like these people that [clears throat] came out and come into coming to the promised land and they're so weak. You know, when they brought the uh evidence back, evidence back from the promised land and here the evidence was there. Those 10 spies did not look at that evidence. They only looked at the giants in the land. &gt;&gt; And today, people do not look at the evidence in the in the in the message. They don't look where the people have raised from the dead. They don't look the critics don't look at uh the healings that have taken place and all the events that have happened. They're not looking at that. THEY ONLY CAN FIND SOME CRITICISM about the message. &gt;&gt; They're not looking at the evidence. And friends, God has given us so much evidence. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO WALK WITH GOD. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD IN THIS DAY, WE SHOULD LIFT OUR HANDS UH ON THE BASIS. LORD, YOU'RE STILL A LIVING GOD. You're still so gracious and powerful, LORD. OUR OUR SICKNESS IS HEALED. OUR DELIVERANCE IS THERE, LORD. EVERYTHING THAT WAS IS STILL HERE AND YOU'RE WALKING AMONGST US, LORD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR loving us. &gt;&gt; We should HAVE SUCH A A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS. Brother Benham says in a ministry called fellowship, he said when men uh lost their fellowship with God, they become a wanderer. And we've have too many wanderers in the message. We're wandering around and don't know what we're doing. We should have purpose in our life. I want to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want to be uh walk in that same power and that same glory. I WANT TO BE WHAT HE WANTS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [applause] Can I ask that the instruments would come? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's so many things we can speak. You know, after studying the message for for for so many years and I come to the pulpit, what what am I going to tell the people? What what am I going to talk about? &gt;&gt; But what I want to do, I want to give you something that can help you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, we got young people sitting here. &gt;&gt; What are you going to talk to them about the seals? &gt;&gt; We talk to them about the seven churches. They don't know anything much about those kind of things. But if I can give you something that everybody can relate to that is so important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Anybody been sick and party in the last couple of days? Anybody been sick &gt;&gt; here? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We're going to pray for you. We're not going to have a prayer line, but we're going to pray for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we pray, you want to take God's word. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're healing now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. You can play something soft. I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You want to take God at his word. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're going to finish this today. &gt;&gt; When I go home, I'm not going to wrestle anymore. [music] &gt;&gt; You might, one of you might say, well, brother, I don't have any issues in my life. [music] And you can just turn to the Lord say, Lord, I am so grateful for what you have done for me. You called me out, Lord. I'm only sitting here today because of your grace. [music] &gt;&gt; I'm only sitting here because I love you so much, Lord. [music] You have done so much for me. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for what you've done for [music] me, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

How sweet the sound [music] &gt;&gt; that saved a wretch like me. &gt;&gt; He knew what he was. [music] But the amazing hand of God reached down from heaven [music] and touched that soul. He has touched you, my friend. My brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] Brothers, you've been serving the Lord for many years as I have, but that grace still never changes. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It still it still never changes. &gt;&gt; Yes, [music] &gt;&gt; God. What would I do without you? &gt;&gt; Some of us been wrestling with demons.

How many would you want to lift their hand and say, "Lord, I just surrender all to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I really want you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
