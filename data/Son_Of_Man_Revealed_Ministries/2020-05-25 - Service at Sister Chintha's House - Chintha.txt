Paul said this Peter said this John said this linseed oil or your mother Lord she has said this he said that and she looked like this she'd look for Christ this is how she lived her life Lord let it be that living apostolate and owns all of them father a life Lord let it be a testimony unto them we ask you mercy and grace upon us now come and speak to our hearts lawyers come and say something or God then will be a comfort to us O God we ask it now in Jesus name Amen you may not greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen I believe without Jesus Christ will have no hope tonight amen but I believe the reason we have hope tonight and we have an assurance to know there our dear mother is gone on to be with a maker hmm the one she confessed when she mentioned the name Jesus she wasn't talking about a story every time she mentioned the name Jesus was somebody in the family she wasn't talking about a fairy tale today amen she was talking about the person Jesus Christ that she has come to know personally and accepted him as her Lord and Savior personally I'm sure you know that she wasn't talking about joining church she wasn't talking about joining a religion but she kept speaking about Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ became personally known to her the one that's come and died for us and they died for all of us that we might have life and have it more abundantly when the enemy has come to steal and destroy but the Bible said he has come to give life and give it more of an early I would like to take our reading tonight in the book of Matthew sorry the book of Mark chapter date reading from verses 35 the Bible says for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels he man you may be seated thank God for the reading of his words so I think the Bible is saying what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul what the Bible is speaking about here is that everything around us is temporal hmm everything that matters to this material life and the physical form and everything that pertains to the five senses is all a temporal life amen and if we invested time in a temporal life invested all our energy all our efforts all our years to try to gain things for the temporal life but have not spend time emphasizing and investing on that which is eternal then we have a problem when it comes to the time of death amen because that is something that no man can say I know exactly when I'm going to die he no man knows the day an hour when he is time on earth is done each father put you on God's program hmm God as the spot God has given each of us a character and a part to play in his great play and display of redemption each of us as the time allotted to us no man can say for sure which time what did our his life will be taken away but one thing we do know for sure the Bible says for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever shall believe on Him shall not perish but have eternal life amen so one thing we do know for sure that we can have eternal life hmm and we can have it only to Jesus Christ goodness and the way that he has provided for us and he hasn't provided a true religion hmm he's providing it God has provided to his son Jesus Christ a man was come and paid the ultimate price for us but he find that people on today they look at the life journey and he focused so much so much on this temporal life we find that when Sun crept in right there in the beginning in the Garden of Eden when Sun crappie brought death to the human race the Bible says God said to man on the day you eat of the fruit on death day you shall surely die so since started in the Garden of Eden hmm and how did sin come through the first Adam amen but God is a God of many characteristics and one of the greatest characteristics of God is being a savior repentance and to play the part of being a Savior man had to follow and God knew men was going to fall and Jesus Christ has come to make a way for mankind amen that man lost is way God but Jesus Christ comes to sending back to God amen amen God was in Jesus Christ reconciling the whole world to himself amen so he wants to turn the human odds we find that that the god of this evil age which is Satan what started in the Garden of Eden and 6,000 years he made this world into his Eden you don't believe that when Jesus was on the earth 2,000 years ago he told Jesus if you bow down to me then you can have all the kingdom of thoughts he offered it to Jesus Christ and now he's made this world his own either and he's been influencing men how is he being fluency man through the five senses touch feel taste smell yeah and he's been influencing man all through 6,000 years to turn away from God and man was trying to satisfy a desire within him but that desire God put it in men their desire that God man had he had a trust within himself he had a trust he was longing for something he was testing for something and he to satisfy the test he found other men to satisfy the test but those methods were temporal methods he could have turned to drugs he could have turned to the world he could have turned to gambling whatever he could he could turn to living a life in pleasure and he was temporal measure he true satisfaction and to satisfy the thirst that man had would only come to Jesus Christ and God has made that way so if I know dear sister has come and a life on Earth may not have been the easy life a life on Earth from time to time had been a struggle mm-hmm and every day as she progressed into a age old age it might have been a struggle for her to live but would inner something was happened already happened in Edmond and was continuing to take place she was being renewed today with investment a man the Bible says it's a lot Ananda man threescore and ten tulu that's a full life and the rest is grace how dear sister has lived on grace graceful years in the Lord you see this will always prove that everybody wanted what is what will be like life after death but Jesus come to contact death and the grave we went through the way of death but he rose over the third day and now as the keys of death and the grave that's right Jesus took the sting out of deaths that's why death is not the end of life for the believer yet is what is at door the doorways to go eternal life amen the Bible says in first Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 5:1 for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle be desorbed we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens in other words what body Apostle Paul is saying he deserves a tabernacle he basically house he does body dies we already have another body waiting for us amen even when this body takes his last breath when you look at your loved ones taking the last breaths he's because the life the soul comes out of that body and goes into a celestial body hmm you looking at the terrestrial body made of this ugly ugly element but there's another body would same physique and everything but in the prime of life that body is no more suffering that body is no more faint and body cannot decay that body doesn't age a man everyone is in a prime of life in that body hmm how does this dear sister is now rejoicing amen every is not a place where you just go and somebody plays a harp and sing along everybody is a real place a man everybody is a place first far more superior than the Sun a man it's it in fact this earth is gone in such a DK the children of God cannot live here any longer and God one of these days he's going to take the take away his children amen and you only breathe back off these innovates the hmm but every is a real place where do you see a lovely one taking the last breath it means a life the real life comes out of the body the earthly body the temporal body and they step into the real body they step into a celestial body think of them in the prime of life maybe in the 20s that's how that that's how they will be looking on that night so if you want to to go to the place we are near mother's gone you got to live the life that she looked you got to come to know the Savior that she loves a man if you want to have fellowship with her game hmm you are a fellowship when I make it you gonna have fellowship what I God go thank God has promised a journalist amen you can read any religious book in the world no no way and no religious book said I lay down my life and I'll raise it up again no way that it says God gave his game of eternal life to anyone but through Jesus Christ amen God has only given eternal life through His Son Jesus Christ whosoever shall accept him amen the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope see when the Apostle Paul is speaking now he's saying those that died in the faith we must not be ignorant of this no matter when we sorrow it's when he met some that we will follow it's what he naturally we will feel saddened because we must our loved one it's only natural there'll be times when we think about them and we have to think about them and talk but we must not serve as those that have no hope in other words what he's saying don't always if you never get a see them again event they not gone for eternal life I mean for eternity away from us we are going to be joined with them amen so I have this Hopi saying for we if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord and so shall we ever be with the Lord we are living in the time where the speak people are speaking about things of coming to the end of the world or the end of the world system as we know it we only be the time of a great pandemic on the earth and man don't have the answers as to what is going on we are living in structural times with the Bible said as it was in the days of lots as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man we are living the time that Jesus prophesied about he spoke about the condition that the world will be in mother's evils sin would be on the earth until Jesus comes so we know that we are living in the end times and one of these days Jesus is coming back but what you say is going to happen first there must be a resurrection a man those having died in Christ must arise first mmm and we are living in such a close hour now to the coming of the Lord the question is is our hearts ready mm-hmm oh did we know Jesus Christ personally I'm not asking to be join a church did we go be religious I'm not asking are we fasting and praying and and be religious but do you know Jesus Christ personally if he personally is revealed to you did you accept him as your Lord and Savior and you made him lord over your life do you making have you made investment for your soul have you allow Jesus to come into every compartment of your heart Eve I'm not just saying Jesus coming to moderate Tom but when he comes to every compartment it means all the things that are not of God you who don't you allow him to come be Lord of your life and allow the Holy Spirit that he promised to come and root out everything that is not of him that he must come and be Lord of your life if you did that because we are living in such a close hour where Jesus from Jesus spoke of all these things that are happening on the earth all these things enough unknown this Bible said to be pestilences me there'll be famines there'll be all these plagues on yes what you see now is what the Bible said what we see now is that I knew unusual to us we are living in the time the Bible's for but in these times are we do we ever get pinched dogs are we saying Lord I want to make my life right with you lord I want to know you Lord what what does the word speak about his time that we living in Lord what is it that you want me to do for you am I born yet Lord I'm born yo for a purpose what is my part to play in this plane how do you sister played a part help lot has come tune in on this earth but a life has an end a part to play on this earth is ended but on that side she's a joy sing everybody's a real please everybody's more lively than the says everyone got things going on all the time there's no right time in heaven there's no people sleeping in heaven people are awaiting amen every is a real place a mat and as much as it every is a real place we have a real body prepared for me we have a real body a celestial body as you got this earthly body you also got a celestial body so why don't the point that I make you today what have you done to invest in the kingdom of God what have you done to invest for your soul so the postal pole is saying if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we already have one waiting for us so I was kid if you know that there's no need to be scared of your life coming to end on the surface there's no need to fear yet we can say dips where is your sting a mo grave where is your victory amen but praise be to God that gives us life to Jesus Christ amen have you received him have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior the Bible says in Saint John 14 let not your heart be troubled he believed in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whither I go ye know and the way you know you see what happening Jesus life was fixing to end on the earth he proved he was God manifested in the flesh he was saying to disciples to his disciples when you see my life ending its ending for a purpose Jesus is telling his disciple this life is not ended in depth guess why I said I go to prepare a place for you amen a place to receive you so in other one he's telling them I go to prepare a money for you and a body of when your soul leave this earthly body is another body to receive it I go to prepare a place for you amen Jesus life was fixing honor that he is telling the disciples that life doesn't end at this and I want to see right now would you speak already before dear sister do not speak as if a life I didn't speak of an imaginary rejoicing beyond the curtain of time imaginary rejoicing in a region of the Blessed rejoicing with saints of like precious faith with all the believers that have died through the years but a family that died in Christ she is a rejoicing having a rejoicing time right now here's a big conference in heaven right now and she's having that time of fellowship is not the no time thing in heaven there's no limitation of time so they are having that constant fellowship talking to each other sharing the stories with each other remember a character would not change the character that she had yeah will still be the same day so a character will still be the same she's talking to a loved ones that's gone before the one that were waiting for her at the door waiting for her beyond the curtain of time she would have been missing meeting them and having such a great fellowship forever but we are here today and many will want to have fellowship were there one day many of us a year right now you'll love this so much that you want to continue to have the fellowship Jesus is the answer today I would ask you today do you know Jesus personally as your Lord and Savior have you made him Lord of your life if you do not I want you to say in your heart today Lord Jesus I want to accept you as my personal Savior I want you Lord Jesus to be the Lord of my life I want you Lord Jesus - personally reveal yourself to me dear friends this is a serious thing in life everything else that you see is not serious we think our educational system is serious we think having a job is is a real thing those are temporal things the decisions about your soul the investment you make in your soul is the most important decision that you need to make in your life there's no other decision more important than that about investing in your soul you need to invest and make Jesus Christ Lord of your life today government's got no answers scientists have no answers the most intelligent people of the world have no answers every organization every system has been shaken the world is in such a economic crisis they crying out for help they want to be bailouts but no one is trying to burn how many of them I went on and he's and repenting of their sins there was a time when God was going to destroy a place called Nineveh and he sent his prophet Jonah day and that people even have a repentant and because of the true repentance God spare them but we are living in an evil and adulterous generation instead of instead of repenting and calling out to God and cursing take regard for more alcohol the Kreger for the pleasures they would decry awful thing
