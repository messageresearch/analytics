[0:00] pray in the mighty name of our Lord and
[0:02] Savior Jesus Christ we ask His blessings
[0:05] amen amen amen
[0:09] hallelujah amen let's turn to the book
[0:12] of Galatians chapter 4 and verse one
[0:15] amen Galatians chapter 4 and verse
[0:19] 1 and it reads thus now I say that an
[0:23] heir as long as he is a child defer
[0:27] nothing from his servant though he be
[0:30] Lord of
[0:31] all but is under tutors and governors
[0:35] until the time appointed of the
[0:37] father even so we when we were children
[0:40] were in bondage under the elements of
[0:42] the world but when the fullness of time
[0:46] was come God sent forth his son made of
[0:49] a woman made under the law to redeem
[0:53] them that were under the law that we
[0:55] might receive the adoption of
[0:58] sons and because you are Sons God has
[1:01] set forth the spirit of his sons into
[1:03] your hearts crying our
[1:07] father I want you to know that's a
[1:09] special
[1:10] place to be able to cry Our
[1:14] Father there are many people who desert
[1:16] their children but God has not deserted
[1:19] his sons and his daughters amen we are
[1:22] redeemable attributes of God and he says
[1:26] wherefore thou are no more a servant but
[1:29] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[1:33] through Christ amen another portion of
[1:36] scripture in Ephesians chapter 1 and
[1:38] verse
[1:40] 4 it says according as he has chosen Us
[1:43] in him before the foundation of the
[1:46] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:50] Blame before him in
[1:53] love amen it's not our own choosing but
[1:57] the Bible says he had chosen us
[1:59] hallelujah it's not him that willth not
[2:01] him that runneth but God that showeth
[2:04] Mercy amen and what did he chose us
[2:07] choose us for to be
[2:09] holy amen it's not our own Holiness but
[2:13] he had chosen us to be holy and he had
[2:16] chosen us to be without blame before him
[2:19] in love we stand here this morning
[2:22] blameless before the Lord God Almighty
[2:25] because of the shed blood of Jesus
[2:28] Christ and having predestinated us unto
[2:33] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[2:36] to himself according to the good
[2:38] pleasure of his
[2:41] will what did he choose us for for a
[2:44] purpose what did he predestinate us for
[2:47] unto adoption of
[2:50] sons amen hallelujah you may be seated
[2:53] may the Lord add blessings to the
[2:55] reading of his word amen so this morning
[2:57] we'll for a little title we just speak
[2:59] on on the placing of sons amen the
[3:03] placing of
[3:04] sons and like we read in the book of
[3:07] Galatians we find that in the Old
[3:09] Testament when a man married and he he
[3:12] took a wife and he bought children this
[3:14] was called his house sold and he had a
[3:16] little
[3:17] kingdom he was the father of that
[3:20] Kingdom and the children that were born
[3:22] into his home were placed under
[3:26] tutors amen they were placed under a
[3:29] teacher
[3:30] under an
[3:31] instructor because this boy was going to
[3:34] inherit all that the father had so the
[3:37] father had to make certain that he could
[3:40] trust his
[3:43] son so he took to his place over this
[3:46] boy to educate him to raise him up to
[3:49] teach him the ways of the
[3:52] father amen and but he was remember he's
[3:56] a born son in the
[3:57] house but he still has same rights as a
[4:02] servant he's just a
[4:05] son
[4:07] amen and he is no more than a servant
[4:10] until he comes to an age where this
[4:13] tutor will now give a report back to
[4:18] father of how the son is
[4:21] progressing now if the tutor went to the
[4:23] father and said your boy is not doing
[4:26] very
[4:27] good I'm trying to teach him he won't
[4:31] listen he's got a headstrong way about
[4:34] him he just won't listen he's going
[4:36] after the things of the world he's going
[4:38] ahead and following his own will and not
[4:41] willing to follow my instruction and
[4:43] he's putting his own interpretation to
[4:46] everything I'm telling
[4:48] him the father is not going to be
[4:52] confident amen the F because the father
[4:55] knows that this boy is going to squander
[4:57] the family inheritance
[5:00] he's not going to be a good Steward over
[5:02] all the father
[5:04] has Amen brother if you can just follow
[5:07] along in the slides there amen you'll
[5:08] pick up the quotes I'm going through
[5:10] most of these things I'm taking as
[5:12] quotes but I'm paraphrasing it amen so
[5:14] when the father becomes aware of this
[5:18] report he is not too confident about the
[5:21] sun because the sun could mortgage off
[5:22] the farm he could sell it he could drink
[5:25] all the money and he could run around
[5:27] the father realizes then that this boy
[5:30] cannot take control of my
[5:34] domain but when the father is aware of
[5:37] this report he doesn't dishone him as a
[5:41] son he's still his boy but he could
[5:44] place no confidence in
[5:47] him amen and if he wasn't a worthy son
[5:51] the father could not adopt him nor place
[5:54] him in his family he's a Restless child
[5:57] he doesn't have the ability to carry the
[5:59] the father's work so the father just
[6:01] lets him go on being a
[6:06] son amen most of these thoughts you find
[6:09] in the position of a believer in Christ
[6:12] amen and the prophet says that's where
[6:16] Pentecost
[6:18] failed
[6:20] amen they they received the Holy Spirit
[6:23] but they were not willing to go
[6:25] further amen they they when they were
[6:28] born again with the ho spirit and
[6:30] receive the initial evidence of speaking
[6:32] in tongues they settled with that
[6:34] portion of the
[6:35] ministry they didn't want to progress
[6:37] further and that's they said this is it
[6:40] brother you were a child but you were
[6:43] just as much as child as you could ever
[6:45] be but you were born into the family but
[6:48] yet the tutor which is the holy spirit
[6:50] he watched over the church has it's been
[6:54] maturing now in contrast maybe the boy
[6:58] got a good report back
[7:01] back and the day came when this boy
[7:03] maybe had been right and a worthy man he
[7:06] listened to his father he took the
[7:08] instructions he was a good boy then the
[7:11] father took him into the public Street
[7:13] and he put special clothes on him and
[7:16] then the father had a ceremony and
[7:19] adopted the son into his
[7:23] family and then the son is no longer
[7:26] like a servant under a tutor he's now
[7:29] the the
[7:30] boss amen the son is no no longer under
[7:34] tutor but he is just like his daddy he
[7:38] holds the same Authority he holds the
[7:40] same power amen and the father gives him
[7:44] certain things to do the father now
[7:46] gives him
[7:48] responsibilities amen the father tells
[7:50] him these sign shall follow you that
[7:52] believe if you cast out demons amen
[7:56] hallelujah
[7:58] [Applause]
[8:00] if you lay hands upon the sick they
[8:02] shall recover the father starts to give
[8:05] you
[8:06] responsibilities hallelujah amen if you
[8:09] say to this mountain be moved and cast
[8:13] into the sea it shall
[8:15] happen the father starts to give you
[8:20] responsibilities amen hallelujah then
[8:24] amen he tells him you can take over the
[8:26] field here you can do this you can take
[8:28] care of the slave you can take care of
[8:30] whatever it is he is in full possession
[8:33] because he is adopted into the
[8:36] family and his name on the check is just
[8:40] as good as Daddy signing the
[8:43] name
[8:45] amen
[8:47] hallelujah the prophet of God tells us
[8:50] he says now in the spiritual sense after
[8:52] we are born into Christ we become
[8:54] children of God now this boy after he
[8:57] got to a certain age had to to be
[8:59] adopted into the same family he was born
[9:02] into any Minister knows that's the
[9:05] placing of a
[9:07] son then the prophet tells us we have a
[9:10] very good example in the prodigal
[9:15] son in Luke 15 now remember Luke 15 the
[9:20] father has two
[9:21] sons sir
[9:24] hallelujah
[9:26] amen and the younger of them said father
[9:29] give me me the portion of my goods that
[9:31] F fall to me and he divided unto them
[9:34] his
[9:37] living when was this after the tutor had
[9:40] given the report after he had come of
[9:44] age and he didn't want to stay in
[9:47] father's house he didn't want to stay in
[9:49] the confines of the
[9:52] word this was a type of the Pentecostal
[9:56] church amen after the initial outpouring
[9:59] of the Holy Spirit on in the day of
[10:02] Pentecost amen Acts 2 amen when they
[10:05] came a sound from heaven like a mighty
[10:08] rushing wind and it filled one and
[10:12] all amen he said give me the portion of
[10:16] this goods and he settled for a
[10:18] Pentecostal outpouring the initial
[10:20] evidence of speaking in
[10:23] tongues and he didn't want nothing else
[10:25] to do with the
[10:27] father hallu he didn't know know the
[10:29] father had many other blessings in
[10:32] store amen because the holy ghost in the
[10:36] land of the Holy Ghost there is
[10:38] plentiful blessings spiritual blessings
[10:41] amen if we can only find our place in
[10:45] Christ there's just not one blessing for
[10:47] the
[10:49] believer but the L the Holy Ghost which
[10:51] is the land of our inheritance as is a
[10:54] land flowing with milk and honey
[10:56] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[11:02] and the Bible says not many days the
[11:04] youngest son gathered all that he had
[11:07] together and he took his journey into a
[11:09] far country and he wasted the substance
[11:13] with righteous living what was he
[11:16] doing now he's going on a seven stage
[11:19] journey to his
[11:24] demise he's leaving his first love like
[11:27] Ephesians did
[11:30] amen amen he's leaving his first love
[11:34] he's leaving his father's house and he
[11:36] goes on the seventh stage of his falling
[11:39] away from the original
[11:43] Faith like the church did now we typing
[11:45] it with the church amen remember the
[11:48] parable is a Earthly story with a
[11:51] Heavenly
[11:53] meaning amen so we can find on his
[11:57] journey where he is in his Journey if we
[12:00] pick up the seven Church ages and God
[12:03] Said Amen to him I have somewhat against
[12:06] thee because thou has left thy first
[12:12] love amen under the second stage of his
[12:15] journey amen he is experiencing
[12:18] tribulation and poverty but Thou Art
[12:23] rich I know the blasphemy of them would
[12:26] say they are Jews and are not but are
[12:28] the syn go of
[12:30] Satan he began to dabble in amen other
[12:37] religions amen what was it it was a
[12:40] image being formed unto the
[12:42] Beast you economical
[12:45] move
[12:46] amen We Are All One worship together
[12:51] under the stage St third stage of his
[12:53] journey I have a few things against thee
[12:56] because thou Hast them here you hold to
[13:00] the doctrine of balum watch how he was
[13:02] slipping away from the faith he was
[13:04] holding to the doctrine of balum Amen
[13:07] with Tau BAC and to cast his stumbling
[13:09] block before the children of Israel he
[13:12] started to eat things that were
[13:13] sacrificed to idols and to commit
[13:17] fornication amen he started to hold to
[13:20] the doctrine of the nicians and it's a
[13:23] thing that God
[13:27] hated amen
[13:34] and under that fourth stage of the
[13:36] journey he met that woman
[13:41] Jezebel and she called herself a
[13:43] prophetess and she began to teach him
[13:45] and seduce him to commit fornication and
[13:49] eat the thing sacrificed to
[13:51] idols and God was just pleased with his
[13:56] walk and he says I will kill the
[13:59] children with death what is that
[14:04] tieria they all but died
[14:07] out that's the fourth stage of the
[14:09] journey kill the children with death and
[14:12] all the churches shall know that I am he
[14:15] who searched the reins and the hearts
[14:17] and I will give unto every one of you
[14:18] according to your
[14:20] works but he was slipping further and
[14:22] further away from father's home from the
[14:25] original
[14:27] teachings all that the two had been
[14:29] training up for all these years he was
[14:32] leaving it but God is not one to be
[14:35] defeated
[14:36] amen because this boy was a son from
[14:39] before the foundation of the
[14:42] world Amen he wasn't made a son when he
[14:46] was born but he was in the back parts of
[14:48] God's mind
[14:51] amen you may Wonder from God but if you
[14:54] are a predestinated son of God you will
[14:57] have to turn around and come back to
[14:59] Father's
[15:01] House
[15:05] amen we find here now under the fifth
[15:08] stage of the
[15:10] journey there's an admonishment given to
[15:13] him it says strengthen the things which
[15:17] remain amen strengthen the things which
[15:22] remain so God started a work in the
[15:25] boy's life and he sent forth Luther amen
[15:29] and Luther found a text in the Bible and
[15:32] the only thing that remained because the
[15:33] Catholic church had taken away the word
[15:35] from the
[15:37] people but Luther began to strengthen
[15:39] himself with the things that remained
[15:41] and he saw in the Bible the just shall
[15:44] live by faith he had a little strength
[15:49] amen
[15:51] amen he preached the message of
[15:54] justification amen hallelujah
[15:59] amen but the Lord goes on to say I have
[16:02] not found thy works perfect before God
[16:05] so justification just alone just
[16:07] wouldn't do it there had to be another
[16:10] stage in the journey amen so God sent
[16:14] forth Wesley amen with a message of
[16:16] sanctification and he went back on
[16:19] Horseback preaching
[16:21] sanctification another work of Grace
[16:24] amen what was this amen I have set
[16:27] before thee an open door Hallelujah and
[16:31] no man can shut it that message of
[16:34] sanctification still holds strong strong
[16:36] today because God had opened up the door
[16:39] of a Sanctified Holy Ghost fill life and
[16:42] no man can shut it
[16:46] hallelujah
[16:48] amen
[16:51] hallelujah oh bless the name of
[16:54] Jesus Amen now watch it goes on to say
[16:58] you you have a little strength so Wesley
[17:01] still have strength but it was a little
[17:07] strength and has kept my word and has
[17:10] not denied my name aren't you glad that
[17:13] we did not deny the name of the Lord
[17:15] Jesus Christ amen when it comes to
[17:18] baptism we are not ashamed of the
[17:21] name amen while other people who are not
[17:24] sons are confused about the name
[17:29] amen we know the name of the father son
[17:33] and the holy
[17:38] spirit
[17:40] amen
[17:41] hallelujah and on the seventh stage of
[17:45] his journey he ended up in a pitiful
[17:51] condition it says I Know Thy works you
[17:54] are neither cold nor
[17:56] hot I would that there were cold or hot
[17:59] but because thou are lukewarm and
[18:01] neither cold or hot I will spew thee out
[18:04] of my mouth because you said I am rich
[18:07] increased with goods and have need of
[18:10] nothing and knowest not that thou
[18:12] wretched miserable poor blind and
[18:18] naked and that brings us to Luke
[18:22] 15:15 he found himself in a latan
[18:27] condition and the Bible says says he
[18:29] joined himself to a citizen of that
[18:34] country a leosan
[18:37] spirit look what this citizen did to
[18:41] him he didn't take him into his home and
[18:45] give him room in the
[18:50] house and that's what the latan spirit
[18:53] will do to
[18:56] you it will strip you naked
[19:00] that you won't even know
[19:03] it
[19:06] amen we will be miserable
[19:09] wretched naked
[19:11] blind but he joined himself to a citizen
[19:14] of that country and he sent him in the
[19:16] field to feed
[19:21] swines now look at what a contrast this
[19:24] is with the Good Samaritan
[19:29] the Good Samaritan found this man laying
[19:32] on the
[19:33] floor and what did he do they stripped
[19:36] him of his reignment and hounded him and
[19:39] depart leaving him half dead but they
[19:42] said the priest came by he didn't touch
[19:44] him no doubt Revival after Revival swept
[19:48] through that pig pen that
[19:50] day AA Allen Oral Roberts bully Graham
[19:55] all we having revivals
[19:59] amen
[20:01] hallelujah but none of the priests none
[20:04] of the
[20:05] Levites they came and looked at him but
[20:07] they passed the other
[20:10] way amen but they came a Samaritan
[20:15] hallelujah amen there came a Samaritan
[20:18] and as he journeyed he came he saw the
[20:21] man and he had compassion and he went to
[20:23] him and he bound up his
[20:26] hounds I have come to bind up the
[20:28] brokenhearted to set at Liberty those
[20:31] that are
[20:32] captive
[20:34] amen
[20:36] hallelujah he had compassion on him and
[20:39] what did he do he was pouring oil and
[20:43] wine oil speaks of the Holy Ghost and
[20:46] wine speaks of the stimulation of
[20:49] Revelation this was another kind of
[20:52] ministry sir
[20:54] amen hallelujah what is this amen
[20:58] hallelujah
[20:59] third seal oil and
[21:02] wine
[21:04] amen oh bless the name of Jesus and he
[21:07] set him on his own beast and he brought
[21:10] him into an hen and he took care of him
[21:14] he was not like the citizen who threw
[21:17] the prodical son into a pig
[21:19] pen but here he took him and he paid the
[21:24] price and listen to what the Bible says
[21:28] and on on the tomorrow when he departed
[21:30] he took two pence and he gave them to
[21:32] the
[21:33] host catch this now first and second
[21:38] pull sign in the
[21:40] hand Discerning the
[21:43] spirit he gave him two
[21:47] pens Hallelujah two PS were in operation
[21:52] to take care of him but watch the
[21:56] third he gave him two pens and he gave
[21:59] them to the host saying take care of him
[22:02] here's the third coming now and
[22:05] whatsoever thou spendest more when I
[22:08] come again I will repay the third has to
[22:12] be operated by you
[22:17] amen the third Pence because the
[22:20] inkeeper had two pens first and second
[22:22] pull but we are not satisfied with just
[22:25] two pulls we are going to make a request
[22:28] from the in keeper amen that we want the
[22:30] third
[22:32] pool
[22:33] [Applause]
[22:35] Hallelujah because the first pool was
[22:38] reaching to the five senses he would
[22:40] take them by the hand the second pool
[22:43] designed the spirit of man but that
[22:46] third pool amen went deep down into the
[22:50] soul and it brought that genene seed of
[22:53] God that was within us germinated the
[22:57] life but but it's for you to
[23:03] operate the word was given to the
[23:05] inkeeper if he ask for anything more if
[23:09] you say if you
[23:13] say he could have been sitting there and
[23:16] just been content with the two
[23:19] pence but he required further treatment
[23:23] amen and whatsoever he desired amen he
[23:27] knew that the price was paid made in
[23:29] full father has left an open checkbook
[23:31] for you this morning will you sign your
[23:34] name on it and give a claim let the
[23:37] great enforcer take it to the father
[23:39] this
[23:40] morning amen oh don't sit and wonder
[23:44] this morning amen but get involved in
[23:47] the service say Amen

[23:57] the bride right now we are having some
[24:00] nice hot dog rolls right now amen we are
[24:04] having a nice big juicy steak right now
[24:07] amen so get involved with the service
[24:12] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[24:16] the third part was left for the man to
[24:19] operate and to speak another
[24:22] word
[24:26] hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[24:29] amen now verse 17 brings us to this it
[24:33] says now we gone back to the Prodigal
[24:36] Son can you imagine he's looking around
[24:39] and all he sees
[24:40] is
[24:42] pigs have you seen the squala that a pig
[24:46] lives in hallelujah it's
[24:49] filthy and he's laying there next to him
[24:53] is pig mess this side is pig amen
[24:59] that's
[25:02] amen and he says the Bible says when he
[25:06] came to
[25:10] himself something took away his
[25:17] Amnesia it will take those seven unknown
[25:19] Thunders to wake her up
[25:22] [Applause]
[25:24] again something awoke the boy he came to
[25:27] himself

[31:02] heaven
[31:06] Rejoice amen amen amen hallelujah amen
[31:11] how many of you know that the father
[31:13] adopt to Jesus the same
[31:16] way amen God so loved the world that he
[31:19] gave his only begotten son but the
[31:21] adoption didn't take place at his birth
[31:24] the adoption didn't take place on the
[31:26] Jordan River that day even even though
[31:28] the Holy Ghost came and descended like a
[31:30] dove but the father took him up one day
[31:33] amen after he was TR trained after he
[31:36] went through his testings after he went
[31:38] through his trials after he went through
[31:40] his
[31:42] Temptations and the church will go
[31:44] through its own training
[31:46] ground you are on the training ground
[31:48] right

[31:52] trials all your
[31:55] testings amen
[31:59] we find amen what
[32:03] happened amen father took him up on the
[32:07] mountain of
[32:09] transfiguration God adopted his own son
[32:11] like that Jesus walking as an ordinary
[32:14] man but one day on Mount Transfiguration
[32:16] there were three Witnesses Peter James
[32:19] and
[32:20] John amen and
[32:23] watch the prophet says he separated
[32:26] Jesus from them and he overshadowed him
[32:30] and the Bible says is ramond shine like
[32:33] the sun now the prophet says what was it
[32:37] that special
[32:39] robe God adopting his own
[32:42] son amen what happened Jesus had changed
[32:46] his body he had passed over into
[32:49] glorification do you know the Apostle
[32:51] Paul refers to this as robes as a
[32:53] garment he lays down and he longs to be
[32:56] clothed with a garment from above
[32:58] so God takes Jesus on the mountain and
[33:01] he brings him to
[33:03] glorification in an adoption
[33:07] ceremony oh listen to this now and when
[33:10] he adopts Jesus Moses and Elijah
[33:19] appear you'll get it
[33:22] now Hallelujah after the book The titled
[33:25] deed of our inheritance comes down in re
[33:27] ration chapter 10 and after John is's
[33:30] told to take the book and eat the book
[33:33] and after he's told to prophesy again
[33:36] and that is what is going on right now
[33:39] the wife is prophesying
[33:42] again but she must go off the
[33:45] scene she must be
[33:48] changed because the message is the shout
[33:52] to gather the living Saints Hallelujah
[33:55] and when she changed the scene changes
[33:59] because there's a hidden Mystery right
[34:01] there after the
[34:03] prophecy the Rapture must take place and
[34:07] then Revelation 11 Moses and Elijah
[34:09] appears
[34:11] again hallelujah what was it if the head
[34:14] was adopted and Moses and Elijah
[34:17] appeared when the body is adopted Moses
[34:21] and Elijah will appear to the
[34:26] Jews amen amen
[34:29] amen oh
[34:32] hallelujah amen hallelujah so it's
[34:35] adoption time it's no longer time just
[34:38] to remain
[34:39] Sons you've been wandering around in the
[34:42] message in the word just as Sons telling
[34:45] everybody I'm Sons I'm Sons I'm Sons but
[34:47] you're walking around with no
[34:49] Authority when you speak nothing
[34:56] trembles when we speak we expect amen
[34:59] maybe you're you're a Terrorizer at home
[35:02] and you're terrorizing the
[35:05] family and you bring condemnation and
[35:07] fear to
[35:09] everybody but I'm talking about
[35:11] spiritual
[35:16] things walking around just as a
[35:19] son but we need to come to
[35:22] adoption one with
[35:24] authority one with power
[35:29] amen now we're talking about the
[35:32] inheritance because that's what it was
[35:33] about once you adopted you are now an
[35:39] inheritor and that's what Revelation 10
[35:41] is all about the book of
[35:44] redemption yes sir the title D to our
[35:47] inheritance being brought back to
[35:51] man and the prophet teaches us that the
[35:53] book of Ephesians parallels Joshua and
[35:57] just like Joshua positionally placed
[35:59] them in the land of the inheritance the
[36:01] book of Ephesians places Us positionally
[36:05] in the land of our inheritance which is
[36:07] the Holy
[36:09] Ghost and being in the land of our
[36:11] inheritance is one
[36:13] thing but walking victorious in the land
[36:17] possessing the gates of the enemy with
[36:19] all things under our feet is another
[36:23] thing amen the fful ministry is laboring
[36:27] to positionally place the people in the
[36:30] land of the
[36:31] inhabitants and I want you to know we
[36:34] are not afraid of the Giants in the land
[36:36] this bride Is Not Afraid amen we are not
[36:40] afraid to explore the land amen and take
[36:44] back everything that the devil has
[36:46] stolen from

[36:50] ground amen hallelujah we're exploring
[36:54] the land from Genesis all the way to re

[37:07] land amen hallelujah amen from natural
[37:11] to Supernatural in fact we even go to
[37:14] Genesis 1 and go into the back Paths of
[37:19] God's mind before God was God
[37:25] Amen and we uncover God's three-fold
[37:28] Plan of Redemption and God is working to
[37:31] bring to pass his plan we are not
[37:33] terrified by the Giants we are not
[37:35] scared of Liv and living in fear and
[37:38] condemnation remember when they got into
[37:40] the land the land was already
[37:43] occupied but they were placed
[37:45] positionally but they had to fight for
[37:48] every inch of
[37:52] ground
[37:54] amen why amen we are waging a war
[37:57] against the Giants how many if you want
[37:59] to wage a war this morning
[38:02] amen
[38:05] hallelujah amen whose report will you
[38:08] believe when we say we are more than
[38:11] able this
[38:12] [Applause]
[38:14] morning
[38:16] amen hallelujah we are waging a war in
[38:19] the Land of the Giants but we do not war
[38:22] after the flesh for the weapons of our
[38:24] Warfare and not carnal but the mighty
[38:26] through God to the pulling down of
[38:29] strongholds we are casting down
[38:31] imaginations imaginations that this
[38:34] person doesn't like me and that person
[38:36] doesn't like me or the pastor didn't
[38:38] greet me and the Deacon said this
[38:42] backbiting and fussing we are casting
[38:44] down every vain
[38:47] imagination amen we are putting our
[38:50] shoulders to the wheel and supporting
[38:52] the
[38:55] ministry casting down every ey thing
[38:58] that exalted itself above the knowledge
[39:01] of God and bringing into captivity every
[39:04] thought to The Obedience of
[39:07] Christ not oh if this doesn't work I'll
[39:11] try
[39:12] that if the prayer in the church don't
[39:15] work I'll go to the
[39:17] temple if that doesn't work I'll go to
[39:19] the palm reader if that doesn't work
[39:22] I'll go and call up my
[39:26] ancestors yes
[39:29] you'll be
[39:33] surprised why people are not
[39:35] positionally placed you want God to
[39:38] answer in your time but God will answer
[39:42] in his
[39:45] time it must be God's time any
[39:48] season the children of Israel wanted
[39:50] Moses to answer before time and he slew
[39:53] an Egyptian even though he was called
[39:58] even though it was the will of God for
[40:00] him to deliver them but it was the wrong
[40:02] season the wrong time God must take him
[40:06] back into the back parts of the desert
[40:08] 40 years of training but once he meets
[40:11] that Pillar of
[40:13] Fire now is the time for the Deliverance
[40:16] of the children of
[40:18] Israel anytime you meet that Pillar of
[40:20] Fire that's your season
[40:25] amen hallelujah
[40:29] what makes us unafraid of the Giants in
[40:31] the
[40:32] land the Lord had opened up our eyes
[40:35] like Elisha said open up the boy's eyes
[40:38] and when we opened up our eyes we saw
[40:41] reinforcements coming from another world
[40:44] From Another Dimension because the
[40:47] battle on the Earth was getting hot and
[40:49] heavy amen the battle that started in
[40:52] heaven was now upon the Earth and it was
[40:54] a battle for the
[40:56] mind Revelation 9 talks about the star
[40:59] that fell from heaven what is this demon
[41:02] powers coming down to the Earth and he
[41:05] was given a key to the bottomless
[41:08] pit amen Revelation 9:14 talks about the
[41:12] Four Angels which were Bound in the
[41:14] river Euphrates and now they were let
[41:16] loose and they were prepared for an hour
[41:19] a day month and a year to slay the third
[41:22] part of men itler melini Stalin amen
[41:28] amen and also 200 million demons 200
[41:33] million Horsemen are let loose and these
[41:35] are Supernatural demons that were let
[41:38] loose upon the
[41:40] Earth this is the Warfare we are in
[41:44] you're thinking it's just the carnal and
[41:46] things you're fighting this person and
[41:48] fighting that person not realizing that
[41:51] it Spirits sent to torment
[41:54] [Applause]
[41:55] you amen
[41:58] amen look at all of these demon powers
[42:01] even under the fourth seal there's a
[42:03] pale of Rider his name is death and the
[42:05] Bible says Hell Followed
[42:10] [Applause]
[42:12] him and power was given over them over
[42:15] the fourth part of the earth to kill
[42:17] with sword with Hunger with death and
[42:20] with the Beast of the field but when all
[42:23] hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose
[42:27] Loose as
[42:28] well Hallelujah I don't think you heard
[42:31] me when all hell is turning loose be
[42:35] under expectation that all Heaven is
[42:38] going to stand behind you to back you
[42:43] up God is not going to be defeated
[42:46] because when the enemy comes in like a
[42:47] flood the spirit of God raises up a
[42:51] standard
[42:53] amen and we see in Revelation 10 another
[42:57] Mighty angel coming down only Christ it
[43:01] could be amen and he's clothed with a
[43:03] cloud that's not a water Cloud that's
[43:06] not a rocket Cloud but that's a cloud

[43:45] hand a book open and his right foot on
[43:48] the sea and his left foot on the
[43:51] earth
[43:53] why because out of the sea is coming a
[43:56] beast and out of the earth is coming a
[43:58] beast in Revelation
[44:01] 13 and he must keep his foot on the land
[44:04] and on the sea to suppress these Powers
[44:08] because he still got a people on the
[44:10] Earth God is suppressing the powers that

[45:04] have four angels in the Book of
[45:06] Revelation 7 holding back the winds
[45:09] that's Wars and
[45:12] strife you see we don't see these things
[45:14] that are taking place in the
[45:16] Supernatural
[45:19] realm because Putin could have blasted
[45:22] them with that atomic
[45:24] bomb but hold back the winds

[45:29] transpire on the earth people are
[45:31] wondering why the war in Ukraine what
[45:34] relevance does that have God is still
[45:36] driving the Jews back to the
[45:39] Homeland Ukraine has the highest amount
[45:42] of Jews or had the highest amount of
[45:45] Jews outside of Israel but God put Wars
[45:49] and strife in the land to drive the Jews
[45:52] back to the Homeland because it's time
[45:55] for Moses and Elijah to
[46:02] appear the Jew must be back in the
[46:05] Homeland you don't believe me go and

[46:43] Four Angels saying hurt not the Earth
[46:46] neither the sea till we have sealed the
[46:49] Servants of our God in their
[46:52] foreheads but before their sealing time
[46:55] comes you must be seal

[47:00] sealed and now the Gentile dispensation
[47:03] is just about ending you must make sure
[47:06] you are sealed with that Holy Ghost Of

[48:31] Earthly inheritance but a Heavenly
[48:34] blessing spiritual
[48:37] blessings amen the anointing is not
[48:40] endered down to us via a natural
[48:42] inheritance but we when we reive the
[48:45] holy ghost we were endured with power
[48:48] from an eye the power Came From Another
[48:51] Dimension it came from another world

[49:58] telling them time and time again the
[50:00] angel of the Lord is not even two feet
[50:02] from where I'm
[50:04] standing he was telling them about this

[50:22] you about your strange and misunderstood
