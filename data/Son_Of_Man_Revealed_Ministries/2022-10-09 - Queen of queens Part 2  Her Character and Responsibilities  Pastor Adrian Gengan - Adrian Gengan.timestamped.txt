[7:07] queen of Queens talking about the Bride
[7:09] of Heaven amen and how amen the King of
[7:12] Kings has a wife amen this morning we'll
[7:15] look at a character and our
[7:17] responsibilities
[7:18] this queen of Queens amen a character
[7:21] and her responsibilities let's turn to
[7:23] Esther chapter 1 and verse 9.
[7:26] amen
[7:27] [Music]
[7:30] the bride must have certain
[7:32] characteristics and she does have
[7:34] responsibilities
[7:36] amen let's read Esther chapter one and
[7:39] verse 9. also Esther the queen Made A
[7:42] Feast for the women in the Royal house
[7:44] which belonged to King aceres
[7:48] she is the queen she is making a feast
[7:51] in the Royal house that belongs to the
[7:54] king
[7:55] let's drop to verse 10.
[7:58] on the seventh day when the heart of the
[8:01] King was Mary with wine he commanded
[8:04] mailman bisla bigger
[8:09] after
[8:11] and caucus the seven chamberlains that
[8:15] served in the presence of a hazarus the
[8:18] king
[8:19] now you've got to know that there are
[8:21] seven spirits of God Amen
[8:23] that also went forth into the Earth
[8:25] anointing those seven Church age
[8:27] Messengers amen
[8:29] and what will they do they were going to
[8:32] bring vasty the queen before the king
[8:35] with the rod with the Crown Royal
[8:38] so he wants her to appear before the
[8:40] king clothed in a Royal apparel with the
[8:43] crown to show the people and the princes
[8:46] of Beauty for she was fair to look on
[8:51] okay
[8:52] but the queen busty refused to come at
[8:56] the king's commandment by his
[8:58] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[9:01] rough and his anger burned in him so
[9:05] you'll find at the end of the lady Sian
[9:06] Church age she still didn't want to come
[9:08] and the King was angry he's standing at
[9:11] the door and he's knocking
[9:13] amen
[9:15] so we'll drop to verse
[9:18] 15
[9:20] and it says what shall we do unto the
[9:23] queen vashti according to the law
[9:26] because she has not performed the
[9:28] Commandment of the king Ace arrested by
[9:31] the chamberlains
[9:32] and memo can answered before the king
[9:36] and the princes vastly the queen had not
[9:39] done wrong to the king only
[9:43] you see these churches they haven't only
[9:45] done wrong to Jesus
[9:48] but to all the princes and to all the
[9:51] people that are in all the provinces of
[9:53] King azerus
[9:55] for this deed of the queen shall come
[9:57] abroad and to all women so that they
[10:00] shall despise their husbands in their
[10:02] eyes when it shall be reported the king
[10:05] then King Asus is commanded vastly the
[10:09] queen to be brought in before him but
[10:10] she came not
[10:12] likewise shall the ladies of Persia and
[10:15] media say this day unto all the king's
[10:18] princes which have heard of the deed of
[10:20] the queen thus shall they arise too much
[10:23] content and Wrath
[10:24] if it please the king let they go a
[10:27] royal commandment from him let it be
[10:29] written among the laws of the Persians
[10:31] and the medes that it not be that it
[10:34] being or not altered that vastly come no
[10:38] more before King Israel and let the King
[10:41] give a Royal Estate unto another that is
[10:45] better than she amen
[10:47] we're going to go to chapter four now
[10:52] amen after we find here that now there's
[10:55] a new Queen in town
[11:01] there's a new Queen serving
[11:04] the people
[11:06] amen and we are late in the story now
[11:09] where there's a threat put upon the
[11:11] Jewish people
[11:13] we're gonna pick it up from verse 9.
[11:15] ATEC
[11:17] is typing the fivefold ministry
[11:19] right and watch what they are doing they
[11:22] are echoing back the words of mordecaya
[11:25] Mordecai typing the seventh age
[11:27] messenger
[11:28] random amen because there'll be a people
[11:31] who are Faithfully taught to say only
[11:33] what the messenger said
[11:36] so ATEC is in another place
[11:38] he cannot come and speak directly to
[11:41] Esther
[11:42] catch the thought now Graham is in
[11:45] another place
[11:46] he cannot come and talk to Esther but he
[11:49] is speaking by the faithful Ministry yes
[11:52] and it says that attack came and told
[11:54] Esther the words of Mordechai
[11:57] who's telling you the word of Branham
[11:59] week after week amen if not attack
[12:02] again is to speak unto ATEC and gave him
[12:06] commandment unto Mordecai all the king's
[12:09] servants and the kings of the king's
[12:10] Province do know that whosoever whether
[12:13] man or woman shall come unto the king
[12:15] into the inner Court which is not called
[12:17] there is one law of is to put him to
[12:21] death
[12:24] now look at the contrast the first time
[12:26] it was death to Queen busty not to come
[12:29] into His presence now there's a law to
[12:31] come into the king's presence this
[12:33] you're going to be put to death
[12:36] except such as to whom the king shall
[12:38] hold out the golden scepter that he may
[12:40] live but I have not been called to come
[12:43] in unto the king these 30 days and they
[12:46] told to Mordecai Esther's words then
[12:49] Mordecai commanded to answer Esther sing
[12:52] not within thyself that thou shall
[12:54] Escape in the King's house more than all
[12:57] the Jews for if thou all together Hold
[13:00] Us thou peace at this time then shall
[13:03] their enlargement and deliverance arise
[13:05] to the Jews from another place but thou
[13:07] and thy father's house shall be
[13:09] destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou
[13:11] Art come into the kingdom for such a
[13:13] time as this
[13:15] then estimate them return Mordecai this
[13:18] answer go gather together all the Jews
[13:21] that are present in shushan and fasting
[13:23] for me and neither eat nor drink three
[13:26] days night or day I also am I mating for
[13:30] fast likewise and so while I go in unto
[13:33] the King which is not according to the
[13:35] law and if I perish I perish so Mordecai
[13:38] went his way and did according to all
[13:41] Esther had commanded him
[13:43] amen may the Lord a blessing to the
[13:45] reading of his word you may be seated
[13:48] you know funny enough I was looking at a
[13:50] picture this morning and I downloaded it
[13:53] and uh
[13:56] it was from 11 years ago socienita
[13:59] 11 years ago she sang at a concert of
[14:02] ours and you know Facebook has a way of
[14:04] reminding you of the past and he threw
[14:06] up this picture and Karen's picture is
[14:08] there and you need it's the first
[14:09] concert Karen came to and sister Janita
[14:11] was singing so are you going to sing for
[14:14] us this morning
[14:16] she's just like my wife amen they don't
[14:18] want to sing after they get married
[14:21] amen
[14:23] amen we'll give you a break this time
[14:25] but next time please come prepared does
[14:28] your husband know that you sing that
[14:30] well
[14:31] okay that's good she sings very well
[14:33] brother I'm sure she sings you to sleep
[14:35] every night amen now the qualities of a
[14:39] woman that Jesus is looking for to be is
[14:41] Queen
[14:44] amen that's what we're looking for a
[14:46] character and our responsibilities
[14:49] when you're looking for a queen you
[14:51] cannot take a woman off the street
[14:54] it's going to be a specific class of a
[14:56] woman
[14:58] amen you cannot take an ordinary woman
[15:01] and bring it into the uh to the Royal
[15:04] household
[15:06] amen
[15:07] look at what Prince Harry has done
[15:11] he took an adulterous woman
[15:14] I forget the name Megan came to me now
[15:16] Meghan Markle
[15:17] an adulterous woman and he brought her
[15:20] into the Royal household
[15:22] and did you see what she's done
[15:25] she refused to follow the Royal protocol
[15:28] of the royal household
[15:31] and she took the prince away from the
[15:34] United Kingdom he's now not even staying
[15:37] in his own country
[15:39] that's what finding the wrong type of
[15:41] woman would do to you
[15:43] and Christ will not settle for the wrong
[15:45] type of church
[15:48] Christ should only come to the right
[15:50] type of church
[15:51] amen so if you got my notes over the
[15:54] amen let's go to my notes amen we'll
[15:56] take it from brother Brandon because I'm
[15:57] not here to preach my own message I'm
[15:59] here like ATEC to preach back what the
[16:01] prophet is preached
[16:03] amen he says here
[16:06] when you're looking for a wife now
[16:08] Brothers pay attention sisters you too
[16:11] he's giving you three things to do
[16:14] he says you have to plan
[16:17] you have to look
[16:20] you have to pray amen when you're
[16:22] choosing
[16:25] so the pride that a man would choose is
[16:27] going to reflect his character it
[16:30] reflects what's in him
[16:32] she's going to help him make his future
[16:34] home
[16:35] amen Christ isn't going to take a bride
[16:37] that's in the world acts like the word
[16:40] partaking of the world and Counting
[16:42] God's Commandments as if he never wrote
[16:44] them
[16:45] amen so he's looking for a character
[16:48] amen you ask what type of a character he
[16:51] says the real true Born Again Church
[16:52] must have the character that was in
[16:55] Christ because the husband and wife are
[16:57] one and if Jesus only did that which
[17:00] pleased God kept his word and manifested
[17:04] his word his bride will have to be the
[17:06] same kind of character
[17:08] man amen ask yourself this morning are
[17:12] you keeping the word of God
[17:14] amen are you reflecting his character
[17:16] amen
[17:18] come on now take the word of God and use
[17:21] it as a Looking Glass this morning
[17:23] and don't only take certain parts of the
[17:26] word take every Speck of the word and if
[17:29] you are not lining up line up with the
[17:31] word this morning
[17:34] amen
[17:37] people are biased when they're looking
[17:39] at themselves amen God bless you my
[17:41] sister and see you there you came with
[17:43] sister Janita amen hallelujah amen
[17:46] people are biased when they look at
[17:48] themselves
[17:50] when they look at themselves suddenly
[17:52] there's Angels Wings there
[17:55] [Music]
[17:58] even sitting here in church this morning
[18:00] we come into the house of correction
[18:02] some of you got a little extra space for
[18:04] your angel wings
[18:07] amen
[18:10] Hallelujah
[18:12] but when we look at ourselves through
[18:14] God's looking glass you know what he
[18:16] tells us that our righteousness is like
[18:18] filthy rags
[18:20] we cannot depend on our own
[18:22] righteousness amen our own human ability
[18:25] right
[18:26] you know that when we depend on our own
[18:29] human ability how we fail
[18:31] the flesh man you even sit and you
[18:33] wonder and say oh what happened now
[18:36] how come you let me down flesh man
[18:40] why
[18:41] the spirit is willing but the flesh is
[18:44] weak and that's why we want your body
[18:47] change we are tired of the stressed outs
[18:52] amen
[18:53] God didn't send church amen presbyters
[18:56] he didn't send Bishops he didn't send
[18:59] Cardinals and Priests and popes
[19:01] he sent the Holy Ghost to lead the
[19:03] church
[19:05] we are looking upon men for a too much
[19:08] amen we are looking upon human
[19:11] leadership too much we must depend on
[19:14] the leadership of the Holy Spirit the
[19:16] one that was sent to leave the church
[19:18] amen amen amen there is no holy man
[19:21] amongst us but there is one holy God and
[19:25] he sent his holy spirit to fill the
[19:27] believer
[19:29] amen that's what was sent to lead the
[19:31] church he said when he the Holy Ghost is
[19:33] come he will lead you into all truth to
[19:37] reveal these things to you
[19:39] to bring them to your remembrance amen
[19:42] now what was vasy doing she was in the
[19:44] king's Royal household
[19:47] she was having a sister's meeting
[19:50] hello
[19:52] the Bible says that she was having a a
[19:56] banquet for the Sisters
[19:59] in the king's Palace
[20:01] she was having a sister's meeting and
[20:04] their theme song was sisters are doing
[20:06] it for themselves
[20:09] okay
[20:10] they invited Beyonce to come sing there
[20:14] the shoes on my feet I bought it the car
[20:16] I'm driving I bought it
[20:21] it wasn't an independent movement it was
[20:25] women's liberation
[20:28] amen
[20:30] right and they refused to come out at
[20:32] the command of the king amen
[20:37] and we'll be looking at vastly we look
[20:39] at our condemnation but when the king of
[20:42] commanded us to forsake not the
[20:43] ascending together of ourselves we
[20:46] refuse to come into His presence
[20:51] amen and the guest speaker that day was
[20:54] Bishop Jakes
[20:55] and he was going to speak on women that
[20:58] were loose
[20:59] from The Tyranny of King azuris
[21:05] they were having a Merry Old Time
[21:09] amen they were having a seven-day
[21:10] conference
[21:12] they had Joyce Meyer come in
[21:14] amen and all of these women preachers
[21:18] when the Bible condemns woman preachers
[21:20] he says I suffer a woman not to teach
[21:22] but your self authority over a man and
[21:25] that Still Remains the word of God in
[21:27] the 21st century
[21:33] but then there was a queen that was
[21:35] chosen Queen Esther a type of the queen
[21:38] of Jesus
[21:39] and she looks that out she can please
[21:41] the king
[21:43] amen the true bride attracts the
[21:46] attention of God the prophet says
[21:48] by keeping the word
[21:51] how can you extract God's presence you
[21:53] may ask
[21:54] you need to keep his word
[21:57] he says let us notice Christ there was
[22:00] no Beauty in him that we should desire
[22:01] him
[22:03] he always comes in beauty of character
[22:07] Christ wasn't a beautiful great strong
[22:10] Stout man God doesn't choose that kind
[22:13] you remember when he was choosing King
[22:15] David they brought all the strong men
[22:17] before the prophet to anoint
[22:21] Ed amen but God chose a righty looking
[22:23] boy
[22:25] and he shows him and he anointed him
[22:28] amen we choose by sight but God chooses
[22:32] by character amen amen and the fact that
[22:36] you are sitting here this morning tells
[22:38] me that you are peculiar people amen you
[22:41] are a special class of people that God
[22:43] has chosen do you know it's no ordinary
[22:46] thing for you to believe the message of
[22:48] the hour
[22:49] you were chosen and predestinated from
[22:52] before the foundation of the world
[22:54] you have that special character that God
[22:57] is looking for
[23:01] he says it's not worldly beauty of him
[23:04] that attracts his bride it's his
[23:06] character the character of the church
[23:09] that Jesus looks for not big buildings
[23:11] great denominations big memberships he
[23:15] promised to meet with wherever two or
[23:17] three are gathered now the True Believer
[23:19] rest his hopes upon the word of God
[23:21] being Vindicated in truth
[23:24] so we know just as that we are looking
[23:26] at Christ's character he is looking at
[23:29] our character
[23:30] he chooses a bride to reflect his
[23:33] character
[23:35] he says the modern churches of today
[23:37] misses his program by a million miles
[23:42] what is he looking for really
[23:44] yes if we quote this all the time the
[23:47] Jesus Christ is Hebrews 13 8 but he is
[23:50] look at what the prophet is saying he is
[23:53] looking for the for the day for the
[23:55] bride to be formed Hebrews 13 8 just
[23:59] exactly like he was
[24:02] now you know you can hardly be the way
[24:04] you was yesterday
[24:08] hey yesterday you were full of faith
[24:11] yesterday you were on fire for God
[24:15] today
[24:19] amen
[24:22] but God wants us to be what is he saying
[24:24] he wants us to be consistent Christians
[24:28] he's saying he wants the pride he's
[24:31] looking for the day for the bride to be
[24:33] formed Hebrews 13 8 just exactly like he
[24:37] was
[24:38] the Bible says let your yea be a and you
[24:42] may be made
[24:43] God is Not Looking for compromising
[24:45] Christians amen but God is looking for
[24:48] believers in this hour who will stand
[24:51] firm on his word
[24:52] irrespective of whether it's a popular
[24:55] opinion or not but they will stand on
[24:57] his word amen
[25:00] he says it's got to be his same flesh
[25:02] same bone Same Spirit
[25:04] same everything just exactly built up
[25:07] them too then become one until the
[25:11] church becomes that they are not the
[25:13] character of him the word for this age
[25:16] must be molded she must be molded like
[25:19] he is
[25:21] thank you
[25:22] amen now when we're looking at the
[25:25] responsibilities of a queen
[25:27] we know that
[25:29] the first queen in the Bible
[25:32] the queen of Adam's art was Queen Eve
[25:35] and she was given this responsibility to
[25:38] stay behind the word
[25:40] but she forsook her responsibility
[25:44] because she lasted after knowledge
[25:48] but Adam the prophet says took the
[25:52] responsibility upon himself
[25:54] when he covered her
[25:57] Adam knew what he was doing
[26:01] amen and he sold the whole human race to
[26:04] sin
[26:06] that he might have Eve for he loved her
[26:10] but if anybody ever wants to know God
[26:13] hear what the prophet is saying you you
[26:16] have to know God and His nature before
[26:18] you can understand his word
[26:21] people are trying to understand a
[26:24] written text
[26:26] they want to make sense of it and that
[26:28] is why they tell you but that word when
[26:30] Paul wrote back then was for another
[26:32] type of people
[26:34] but if you don't understand his nature
[26:37] you won't understand his word now you
[26:40] know why the prophet is so powerful
[26:42] he said I may not know the scriptures
[26:44] like these many theologians he says the
[26:46] way I understand God is through nature
[26:48] he says I'm a typologist
[26:52] you gotta understand God in his nature
[26:57] he says he's always giving man a warning
[27:00] and a reminder of our responsibility
[27:04] we are responsible and God has put us on
[27:07] Earth for a reason and that reason that
[27:10] he has put us on year four we are
[27:12] responsible to him for that reason you
[27:15] should go to him and find out what he
[27:17] wants you to do
[27:21] he says if you went to work for a man
[27:24] and you were walking on a ranch
[27:27] and you just went to the barn and sat
[27:29] down you know some people are like that
[27:32] if you don't tell him and instruct them
[27:33] what to do they'll just sit down they
[27:36] got a job to two
[27:41] look at what the prophet says it says
[27:44] well you must go and ask him what he
[27:46] wants you to do
[27:47] then you do it if you're working for a
[27:50] man find out what your duties are
[27:56] then if our life on Earth here
[27:59] then if our life is on Earth here then
[28:01] we should go to the one who put us here
[28:03] and say Lord what would you have me do
[28:06] what must I do why am I here
[28:10] if it's to be a housewife dishwasher
[28:14] whatever God wants you to do then you do
[28:17] the very best that you know how to do it
[28:20] no matter how little no matter how
[28:23] little it is you must do it
[28:27] the trouble of it is each one of us
[28:30] wants to do the next man's job
[28:33] we all want to pack the ball as we say
[28:37] amen
[28:39] now I I know there's a saying out there
[28:41] but I don't believe it applies to us
[28:44] there's a saying and it's called oxygen
[28:46] Thief
[28:52] I'm waiting for you in the back it goes
[28:55] from here and it goes slowly
[28:57] oxygen teeth you must have heard that
[28:59] term some of you may have used it
[29:01] you know what an oxygen tea feels
[29:04] [Music]
[29:05] but God as you hear for a purpose
[29:08] I don't believe there are any Oxygen
[29:10] thieves here
[29:11] not when you're called into the economy
[29:14] of God
[29:15] so if God has called you for a purpose
[29:18] if you ask God what your purpose is
[29:21] and when he's revealed to your purpose
[29:23] are you faithful to fulfill that purpose
[29:29] he says each one of us wants to do the
[29:31] next man's job now I can never be a
[29:34] prophet I'm not a prophet
[29:36] I can't be an evangelist I can try to do
[29:39] the work of an evangelist if the Lord
[29:41] asked me to do but I'm not an evangelist
[29:45] I can't take the next man's shop
[29:48] amen and neither can you but when the
[29:52] body is strictly framed together
[29:54] amen then we can function
[29:57] amen
[29:59] that's why we need one another
[30:02] now you may not be be called in the
[30:05] five-fold ministry but you can be
[30:07] operating one of the nine spiritual
[30:09] gifts
[30:10] that's given to the church
[30:14] amen
[30:20] let's let's just see some examples here
[30:22] and watch the patented him now
[30:26] he says the side of the Prophet had a
[30:28] great responsibility remember we are
[30:30] speaking about it means responsibility
[30:32] as I the prophet knew he had a great
[30:34] responsibility what did he do he went to
[30:37] the temple to pray
[30:40] now that's a good thing for all of us to
[30:42] do go down to the temple and pray
[30:45] right and once he began to pray what
[30:47] happened a vision broke up he saw the
[30:50] Lord I and lifted up let's look at Elisa
[30:54] what happened
[30:54] when the responsibility was placed upon
[30:57] Elisa to anti-brite for Isaac
[31:00] Ellie is a being a spiritual man knew
[31:03] that he needed the right kind of woman
[31:05] for Isaac what did he do in the hour of
[31:09] desperation when he arrived at the city
[31:12] he began to pray he says when you get
[31:15] desperate go to pray amen
[31:18] amen amen
[31:26] Lord God let the first maid that comes
[31:28] forth and what is the camel give me a
[31:31] drink
[31:32] be that he prayed in that hour of
[31:35] desperation you know what the problem is
[31:38] we are not desperate enough
[31:41] we are too comfortable with life
[31:43] here treats us well
[31:46] let us here gives us a good income
[31:49] leadership gives us
[31:51] Medical Aid
[31:53] latest here gives us pension Provident
[31:55] fund
[31:58] so we become like that Rich Young Ruler
[32:01] take ease my soul
[32:03] all is well
[32:06] but it wasn't so
[32:09] what was the review given to that man he
[32:11] says now fool
[32:15] and when he when he opened up his eyes
[32:17] when he died he opened up his eyes where
[32:19] was he
[32:20] in hell
[32:24] Hallelujah
[32:30] Rebecca herself when she came she made a
[32:33] commitment to follow Eliza even though
[32:37] she had never seen Isaac listen to what
[32:39] he says in paragraph 96 he said Rebecca
[32:42] is a type of the Bride you've never seen
[32:45] Christ but you hear by his servants what
[32:48] he is amen you sell out everything you
[32:52] leave your homes everything else it
[32:54] takes to go find him now notice she made
[32:56] a decision a type of the Bride left a
[33:00] denominational home to go
[33:02] amen yes
[33:05] now here's a prophet giving a
[33:08] kind of Life advice to us he says we run
[33:11] from trouble we run from
[33:13] responsibilities we are all prone to do
[33:16] that we are more prone to run than we
[33:19] are to stand and face it out
[33:21] we find ourselves running from
[33:24] responsibilities
[33:25] sometimes we find ourselves prone to run
[33:28] from work
[33:30] we don't want to work
[33:33] some people just think they can make a
[33:35] living without working
[33:37] but I think Solomon said we can find the
[33:41] answer in watching an end
[33:44] you know a little ant they tell me if an
[33:47] ant doesn't work and lay in that ant
[33:49] doesn't eat that winter
[33:51] so everybody has to work
[33:54] we got so many things we have to do so
[33:57] much responsibility we have to face
[33:59] everybody has got to face a certain
[34:02] responsibility
[34:05] he says when you choose a wife to be
[34:07] married choose a husband you take a
[34:09] responsibility
[34:11] you must remember maybe you build a home
[34:14] it's a pretty nice home remember after
[34:17] as a married woman you think of the
[34:19] responsibility of raising children you
[34:22] gotta think of them pretty slick walls
[34:25] is going to have dirty entrance all over
[34:27] them
[34:29] I feel sorry for my wife
[34:32] now she has to go
[34:34] do it all over again
[34:36] you know those crayon writings on the
[34:38] wall
[34:39] and everything
[34:41] these babies think they are commissioned
[34:43] pick up your pen and write
[34:48] dirty entrance all over them then you
[34:51] got the responsibility of educating your
[34:53] children
[34:56] are you listening to your prophet
[35:00] you got the responsibility of clothing
[35:02] and feeding
[35:04] everything is a responsibility
[35:07] and it's so easy when responsibilities
[35:10] face us to shirt from them
[35:14] and we find out that marriage is a
[35:16] responsibility in all manners
[35:23] Hallelujah
[35:24] amen
[35:27] and I pray amen that we are Faithfully
[35:30] taught husbands to face up to our
[35:32] responsibilities wives to face up to
[35:35] their responsibilities children to face
[35:37] up to their responsibilities that the
[35:40] house can function in order not only in
[35:43] the natural home but in the church the
[35:46] deacons face up to their
[35:47] responsibilities amen the laity face up
[35:50] to their responsibilities the musicians
[35:53] the song leaders the the ministers face
[35:55] up to their responsibilities
[35:58] then the body of Christ can function
[36:00] properly
[36:02] amen
[36:04] now he says many times ministers shook a
[36:06] responsibility of standing true to the
[36:09] word of God
[36:10] they'll shut that responsibility
[36:12] when truth of the world is brought face
[36:14] to face with us human beings we are
[36:16] prone to shut back until the last
[36:19] resource
[36:23] but we have to face up to
[36:25] responsibilities he says as a father you
[36:28] have to freeze up the responsibility to
[36:30] give your child a whipping
[36:33] them little fellows you don't want to do
[36:35] it but as a father or mother you have to
[36:37] face the responsibility of raising a
[36:40] child
[36:41] because the Bible says spare the rod you
[36:43] spoil your child
[36:45] and that still stands good in the sight
[36:47] of every psychologist there's in the
[36:49] world
[36:51] amen
[36:52] so I I believe you got the idea that all
[36:55] of us have responsibilities in life
[36:58] and if we are failing or falling short
[37:00] in them
[37:01] let's come back on track with the word
[37:03] of God
[37:05] and if you know the things we have been
[37:07] dealing with right now what the problem
[37:08] of speaking I've not been spiritual
[37:10] things
[37:14] but that's you fulfilling God's will for
[37:16] your life
[37:18] if you just look back the last 10
[37:20] minutes everything the prophet was
[37:21] saying
[37:22] has been the natural Affairs of life
[37:25] but God is telling you that your
[37:27] responsibility
[37:28] as a man
[37:33] amen
[37:38] let's go back to helping the young
[37:40] people here 67.
[37:42] he says if I was a young man looking for
[37:45] a wife to be married
[37:46] yesterday girl to meet every
[37:48] qualification that I thought it took to
[37:51] make a woman why morally she was a queen
[37:53] and lovely and a fine personality a real
[37:57] Christian everything I could think of to
[38:00] make me a good wife no matter how I much
[38:03] I say she's perfect
[38:05] she's exactly right she isn't mine till
[38:08] I accept her and the responsibility of
[38:11] being my wife
[38:16] what is he telling you young man young
[38:18] girl not the young girl so much I don't
[38:20] want you girls to be forward now
[38:24] a young man
[38:26] woman is cut out to be on
[38:28] you and you see that she's fine in
[38:30] character
[38:32] now you want to act shy
[38:35] you don't want to talk to her
[38:38] you want somebody to Foster the phone
[38:41] you
[38:42] well if she likes me she must phone me
[38:45] you gotta face up to the responsibility
[38:49] and even if you get rejected
[38:52] you gotta try
[38:55] otherwise she's never going to be yours
[39:01] he says now when we come into a meeting
[39:04] and see the power of God moving and
[39:05] doing things doing Supernatural Works
[39:08] seeing perform look in the Bible see its
[39:11] promise for the hour
[39:13] then we see those things we are
[39:16] confronted with the responsibility to
[39:18] either accept it
[39:20] now people may sympathize with it
[39:25] then in the thing you're responsible for
[39:28] you're not responsible to sympathize
[39:30] with the message he says but you've got
[39:32] to accept it it's got to become part of
[39:34] you and you are part of it then it's
[39:36] yours
[39:38] amen
[39:40] listen what he says here when you marry
[39:43] a certain woman that you have chosen you
[39:45] are one then and that's the way you are
[39:47] with Christ when you see manifested made
[39:50] real then you are part of him and he is
[39:53] part of you and together you're part of
[39:56] the message
[39:58] amen that's what I was trying to convey
[40:01] to you last week you are the message
[40:04] yeah
[40:06] the message is not just some text
[40:08] written about the seals yeah
[40:11] amen
[40:14] he says when you become part of him and
[40:16] he becomes part of you together you are
[40:19] part of the message amen
[40:22] you are the Revival
[40:24] stop looking for the Revival outside
[40:27] stop looking for some Dynamic evangelist
[40:30] to come and stir you up
[40:32] stir you up emotionally
[40:35] the Revival is going on within you daily
[40:37] amen amen
[40:41] he says Christianity is everyday rocket
[40:43] living living for God in this present
[40:46] world it's a constant burning of the
[40:48] fire and love of God in the heart and if
[40:51] you feel that way every day there's a
[40:53] fire of God within you every day there's
[40:56] a love of God within you amen that sets
[40:59] of fire and puts her you out yonder with
[41:01] the people making converts to Christ
[41:04] he says responsibilities
[41:07] getting a man running from the presence
[41:09] of God he says You must accept your
[41:12] responsibility
[41:14] we Lester was faced with it one day she
[41:17] was living a luxurious life in the
[41:19] palace
[41:20] she had all of her needs taken care of
[41:24] there was nothing short for Queen Esther
[41:27] but suddenly one day there came an
[41:29] urgent cry
[41:30] a knock on the door
[41:33] there was a threat on a people's life
[41:35] then we're gonna kill them
[41:39] and what did Mordecai do he placed the
[41:42] burden upon Esther
[41:44] he plays the responsibility upon Esther
[41:47] yes
[41:49] and all seven churches are gone off the
[41:52] scene
[41:53] that always the responsibility placed on
[41:55] right now
[41:57] who will carry the message forward amen
[41:59] who will carry the gospel forward amen
[42:02] you didn't ask for it but the
[42:04] responsibility has been placed on your
[42:06] shoulders
[42:08] amen amen
[42:11] then that sigh and cry for the
[42:13] Abomination 10 in the city
[42:17] listen to what he says here now and the
[42:19] responsibility that God has given us in
[42:22] this day
[42:23] to bring this message
[42:26] as I get older my no my days are
[42:28] shortening up I feel the responsibility
[42:30] greater than I ever felt pressing on we
[42:34] must do it we must get down to it
[42:36] everywhere we go and tell the message
[42:39] amen yes oh Hallelujah get involved in
[42:43] the service this morning amen
[42:45] hallelujah get the Breakthrough in the
[42:47] service this morning amen Satan will
[42:50] surprise you up this morning but in the
[42:52] presence of the Lord there is Liberty
[42:54] amen hallelujah
[42:57] oh Hallelujah
[42:59] blessed be the name of the Lord amen you
[43:02] know why people don't like the
[43:03] responsibility brother preach me how I
[43:06] am blessed teach me how to get blessings
[43:08] of God I'm teaching you how to get
[43:10] blessed take on the responsibilities
[43:13] amen that God has given us and the Lord
[43:16] will reward us
[43:22] amen amen he says we must get down to it
[43:25] you know what getting down to it is
[43:27] you have to get your hands dirty you
[43:30] have to get your feet dirty amen
[43:32] amen and do the hard work
[43:36] tell the message tell the people that
[43:39] Jesus is coming soon amen hallelujah
[43:41] it's as simple as that they may be
[43:44] saying hey I've heard that for the last
[43:46] 50 years but tell them he is much sooner
[43:49] coming now than he was 50 years ago
[43:52] you better get ready or you'll be left
[43:54] behind
[43:58] he is God and he's coming soon see not
[44:00] only tell them that Christ is coming he
[44:02] said tell them that Jesus is God
[44:05] and he's coming soon there's not a hope
[44:07] left in the world but the coming of the
[44:10] Lord
[44:12] he says it's always been that way it's
[44:14] been in man he has shot from God ever
[44:18] since Adam in the Garden of Eden
[44:21] when he came
[44:23] the responsibility to make his choice
[44:25] whether he would stay with God or with
[44:27] his wife the responsibility was up to
[44:29] him he either had to take what his wife
[44:32] said or what God Said and he chose the
[44:34] way of his wife
[44:36] and when he did that he lost his
[44:38] original condition
[44:40] and he brought the whole world subject
[44:42] to death when he had to take the
[44:44] responsibility of accepting new light
[44:46] that his wife had found
[44:50] he says 10 words they couldn't keep
[44:52] eight or ten words
[44:55] amen
[44:57] I want you to know Jesus did not show
[44:59] his responsibilities
[45:01] no matter how bad sleeping you are Jesus
[45:03] still doesn't show his responsibilities
[45:07] because if you are a predestinated son
[45:09] and daughter of God no matter how far
[45:11] gone you are if
[45:14] even if you're a prodigal
[45:17] this has a responsibility to save you
[45:24] amen hallelujah yes
[45:27] God is not going to shut his
[45:29] responsibility about saving you and
[45:32] healing you and setting you free just
[45:35] because you are in a backslidden
[45:37] condition
[45:39] it's like any father whip take care of
[45:42] his child
[45:43] no matter if the child is stubborn and
[45:45] Disobedience sometimes he still has a
[45:48] responsibility to that child
[45:51] amen the heart of the father was
[45:54] revealed in the story of The Prodigal
[45:56] Son
[45:59] amen
[46:01] the father was there looking out
[46:03] when his son would return and when he
[46:06] came back
[46:07] the father didn't say oh now you're
[46:09] coming back began
[46:12] well like a big man you know we Indian
[46:14] strong
[46:16] okay
[46:17] there was nobody like you
[46:22] you were having big mouth with me now
[46:32] Father's Heart was not like that
[46:34] and that father was revealing the heart
[46:36] of God
[46:38] the father was only concerned about one
[46:40] thing
[46:41] that my son which was dead amen is now
[46:45] come back to me he's alive it's time for

[52:59] the type of woman that Jesus Christ is

[53:04] she possesses a certain quality
[53:07] she knows her duties
[53:10] yes
[53:12] amen
[53:13] and she needs to reproduce the life of
[53:17] the king
[53:20] there's nothing that pleases the heart
[53:23] of the king more
[53:24] than to give him her offspring
[53:29] heir to the Royal throne
[53:32] if there's no air
[53:34] his kingdom will come to an end
[53:37] but aren't you glad amen the Bible says

[53:50] no matter how
[53:52] hard life becomes
[53:54] no matter what situations we go through
[53:57] life
[53:58] brother Branham says no matter what a
[54:01] man professes to be he says watch his
[54:04] wife
[54:05] what's the kind of woman he marries
[54:08] he'll tell you his character
[54:11] if he is marrying a sex Queen
[54:14] or some model
[54:16] or somebody that wants to be on the
[54:18] fashion parade
[54:20] he says that reflects what's in his
[54:22] heart
[54:25] you know that you've read choosing of a
[54:26] bride yes
[54:28] the king is looking for somebody who's
[54:30] loyal to him
[54:32] who will come out of this command
[54:35] o the family name
[54:38] can you imagine if they made Megan or
[54:40] Prince Harry King
[54:42] what would have happened
[54:47] wants to Sparkle
[54:50] in Hollywood
[54:51] she got no time for the king for the
[54:54] Queen's ways
[54:56] hey yeah
[55:00] she's coming from the city
[55:02] of angels
[55:12] so she kind of pulled a family name
[55:15] amen
[55:17] but the king is looking for somebody
[55:19] who's loyal to him
[55:21] who cannot pull the family name who can
[55:24] teach the children the babies in Christ
[55:28] because mother is the Fifth Gospel
[55:32] and also not squander the family
[55:35] inheritance
[55:37] do not when we're saying Squad of the
[55:39] family inheritance even Jesus taught us
[55:42] that
[55:43] he says don't cast your pearls before
[55:45] swines
[55:46] [Music]
[55:47] yes
[55:52] amen
[55:54] let's close with this now he says what a
[55:56] sacred Trust
[55:58] what a responsibility to a woman
[56:02] she's a type of the church which has the
[56:05] same responsibility
[56:07] as a woman as a sacred responsibility to
[56:10] her motherhood
[56:11] to a virtues to a husband the church has
[56:15] a sacred responsibility to prayer and
[56:19] the word amen
[56:21] what's our sacred responsibility
[56:24] prayer and the word
[56:27] and to Christ just the same as the woman
[56:30] has
[56:32] Jesus never said go make schools he said
[56:35] preach the word
[56:39] he says that's where we neglected
[56:42] not make institutions hospitals that's
[56:45] all right
[56:46] but that's not the church's Duty their
[56:48] duty is to preach the gospel
[56:51] but we've done everything else but that
[56:54] we've drifted in like Satan did and mix
[56:58] up some gospel something else
[57:01] he says corruption
[57:03] even our own world over
[57:05] watch the trend of the world
[57:09] so then again he's saying a true bride a
[57:12] female devil is loyal to her mate amen
[57:16] what are some of the qualities of this
[57:18] woman that he's looking for
[57:20] he says she is a prophetic class of a
[57:23] woman
[57:24] because to understand the Book of
[57:26] Revelation
[57:28] which is a book of symbols
[57:30] it says it has more symbols because it
[57:32] is a book of Prophecy therefore it has
[57:35] to be understood by a prophetic class
[57:37] yes this book is not meant for everybody
[57:42] amen
[57:43] amen
[57:47] amen
[57:49] he says this means this book can't be
[57:51] revealed to anyone but a special class
[57:55] of people
[57:58] it'll take one with prophetic Insight it
[58:02] will require the ability to hear from
[58:03] God
[58:05] what am I describing to you now yes
[58:08] amen your qualities
[58:11] and your responsibilities
[58:13] I'm revealing to your characteristics

[58:22] you have the ability to hear from God
[58:26] you can take Supernatural instruction

[58:35] 28 19 he says go ye therefore teach your
[58:38] Nations
[58:40] baptizing them in the name of the father
[58:42] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[58:47] teaching them to observe all things
[58:51] whatsoever I have commanded you

[58:56] telling us to live this way tell them
[58:58] because you're fulfilling what Jesus
[59:00] said amen
[59:02] amen my husband told me to teach you all
[59:04] things

[59:20] father
[59:22] not name of the father name of the son
[59:25] name of the Holy Ghost
[59:28] Father Son and Holy Ghost has one name
[59:31] and it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:33] [Applause]
[59:36] amen
[59:37] 28 20 says teach them to observe all
[59:41] things
[59:44] what I have commanded you
[59:46] he commanded the women to not cut their
[59:49] hair
[59:51] is them to do these things
[59:53] [Music]
[59:55] why you keep hammering against the woman
[59:57] Jesus told me to teach you these things
[1:00:01] if you want me to stop teaching you then
[1:00:03] obey the word
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:09] he says Lord I am with you always
[1:00:12] amen Mark 16 I'm showing you the
[1:00:15] qualities of this woman now the
[1:00:17] characteristics of this woman and the
[1:00:19] responsibility of this woman

[1:00:23] the gospel to every creature
[1:00:26] when she does that whoever believes
[1:00:28] shall be saved and whoever believes not
[1:00:30] shall be damned so watch your word
