[16:12] before we ask the Lord for his grace 1
[16:15] Samuel 16 from verse 1 to 2 and then
[16:18] we're going to jump to verse 11 after
[16:20] that and the Lord said unto Samuel how
[16:22] long will thou mourn for Saul seeing I
[16:24] have rejected him from reigning over
[16:26] Israel full thine horn with with oil and
[16:29] go and I will send the to Jesse the
[16:31] bethlehemite for I have provided me a
[16:33] king among his sons amen and Samuel said
[16:36] how can I go if Saul y he will kill me
[16:39] and the Lord said take an for thee and
[16:42] say I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord
[16:45] in verse
[16:47] 11 and Samuel said unto Jesse I yet all
[16:51] thy children and he said there remained
[16:54] yet the youngest and behold he keep of
[16:55] the sheep and Samuel said unto yes he
[16:58] sent and fetch him for we will not sit
[17:01] down till he come hither and he sent and
[17:04] brought him in that he was ready and
[17:06] with all of a beautiful countenance and
[17:08] God and God goodly to look look to and
[17:11] the Lord said arise anoint him for this
[17:13] is he and Samuel took the Horn of oil
[17:15] and anointed him in the midst of his
[17:17] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[17:19] Upon David from that day forward so
[17:21] Samuel Rose and went to raar I want to
[17:24] turn to 1 Samuel chter
[17:27] 25
[17:29] couple of verses
[17:39] there 1 Samuel CH 25 verse1 and Samuel
[17:44] died and all the Israelites were
[17:46] gathered together and lamented him and
[17:49] buried him in the house of abama and
[17:51] David arose and went down to the
[17:53] Wilderness of pan and there was a man in
[17:56] moan whose possessions were in caramel
[17:58] and and the man was very great and he
[18:00] had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats and he
[18:03] was sharing a sheep in Cel very rich man
[18:06] indeed now the name of the man was nebal
[18:09] and the name of his wife Abigail she was
[18:12] a woman of good understanding in a woman
[18:14] of
[18:16] Revelation and of a beautiful
[18:18] countenance but the man was chish and
[18:20] evil in his doings and he was uh was of
[18:23] the House of Caleb and David heard in
[18:26] the wilderness that nabal did she sheep
[18:29] and David sent out 10 young men and
[18:31] David said unto the young men get you up
[18:33] to carel and go for go to nabal and
[18:37] greet him in my name thus shall I say to
[18:40] him that liveth in prosperity peace be
[18:42] both to thee and peace be to thine house
[18:44] and peace be unto all that that thou H
[18:46] has now have commanded I have heard that
[18:50] thou has uh has sheer now thy Shepherds
[18:53] which were with us we Hur them not
[18:55] neither was their art missing unto them
[18:57] all the while there were in C as the
[18:59] young man ask the young men and they
[19:02] will show thee wherefore let the young
[19:05] men find favor in thine eyes so we come
[19:08] in a good day give I pray thee
[19:09] whatsoever cometh to thy hand unto thy
[19:12] servants and to thy son David and when
[19:14] David's young men came they spake to
[19:16] nabal according to all the those words
[19:19] in the name of David and sees nabal
[19:21] answered David servants and said who is
[19:23] David who is the son of Jesse There Be
[19:26] many servants nowadays that break away
[19:28] every man from his master shall I take
[19:30] shall I then take my bread and my water
[19:33] and my flesh that I have killed for my
[19:35] shearers and give it unto men whom I
[19:37] know not whence they be so David's young
[19:40] young men turned away and went again and
[19:42] came and told all those say the Lord
[19:45] bless the reading of his word you may
[19:48] take your seats this
[19:50] morning amen we got to just take for a
[19:54] title this morning recognizing the drum
[19:57] beat of change amen amen and I've just
[20:01] I've shortened the sermon a bit but it's
[20:03] still a long sermon so we'll just trust
[20:05] the Lord to give us Grace amen uh when
[20:07] we need to stop but
[20:11] um I was going to take a little bit of
[20:14] Abigail but will but I I thought that
[20:16] maybe that will just speak on the drum
[20:19] beat of change yes and um trust God will
[20:22] share something this morning to our
[20:25] hearts and it's a very beautiful story
[20:27] here in the Bible about
[20:29] David um and uh this woman Abigail
[20:34] Abigail we know she types the Bride of
[20:36] Jesus Christ and we'll trust the Lord
[20:39] and see how it
[20:40] unfolds and um we see in this story that
[20:44] we had just read the story of King David
[20:48] being anointed
[20:49] king the scripture here is showing us
[20:52] that the anointing is leaving one king
[20:55] King Saul and he is moving to another
[20:57] king
[20:59] means that there is a change here in the
[21:01] time in the days of Israel amen there is
[21:04] a change in um the season and uh you
[21:09] know always change is not well received
[21:12] yes and the kingdom was changing from
[21:15] one king to another king from One Tribe
[21:18] to another tribe and a dispensation was
[21:21] changing yet in the house of
[21:23] Israel and uh the prophet Samuel himself
[21:27] was afraid of this man King
[21:29] Saul and um and the Lord had said to uh
[21:34] the prophet Samuel go and just uh offer
[21:38] sacrifice so people will not know that
[21:41] you are going to anoint another king yes
[21:44] in other words if you if you now my if
[21:46] you uh if you're hearing me for the
[21:47] first time I preach a lot with types and
[21:49] shadows so you have to follow my thought
[21:52] you eventually you'll catch what I'm
[21:53] saying and uh so you find out J that
[21:56] this thing that was happen happening in
[21:59] the time of the calling and the
[22:01] anointing of King David the Lord is
[22:03] telling the prophet Samuel to keep it a
[22:06] secret means that go as if you are
[22:09] offering a sacrifice and the thing that
[22:11] you about to do this dispensational
[22:14] change will be a secret until the
[22:17] appointed
[22:18] time amen so yeah the prophet is going
[22:21] with a message of the hour he's going to
[22:24] unveil and reveal a dispensation change
[22:27] and that secret is going to be made
[22:29] known but if you read the story about
[22:32] Abigail and and nabal nabal does not
[22:35] catch that Myster but Abigail types the
[22:38] bride she catches the change of
[22:40] dispensation she recognizes that there
[22:43] is a new king she recognizes that
[22:45] there's a coming up a new king there's
[22:47] an anointing up a new king there is a
[22:50] season
[22:51] change amen so it's kept a secret until
[22:54] the appointed time Amen in other words
[22:57] until the abigailes rise upon the scene
[23:00] that secret is made known of the new
[23:02] king amen amen amen so the spiritual
[23:06] Minds like the prophet said the
[23:07] spiritual minds are always looking for a
[23:10] change they're always looking and
[23:12] they're always listening for the
[23:14] change and they know and they identify
[23:17] when the change
[23:19] comes and uh so we we trust the Lord the
[23:23] things that we saying will help us this
[23:24] morning and of course we're taking it
[23:27] out of what the prop has been saying so
[23:28] there's nothing
[23:30] new there's two characteres here a
[23:32] husband and a wife the husband is called
[23:34] nebal and the wife is known as Abigail
[23:38] now you notice here that neor did not
[23:40] recognize the change of God's anointed
[23:44] yes he missed the change of dispensation
[23:47] amen and I we say like this here this
[23:50] morning obviously he was not reading he
[23:53] was not listening to the tapes not
[23:55] reading the books of the prophet Samuel
[23:58] amen and that is why he missed the
[24:00] change neyar was not sensitive to the
[24:03] change in Israel he was not careful to
[24:06] follow the prophet follow the line of
[24:10] inspiration follow the unveiling of God
[24:13] Amen and so it was Samuel the prophet
[24:16] that anointed Saul as king it was Samuel
[24:20] the prophet that the word of the Lord
[24:22] came to all the time because the word
[24:25] comes to the prophets amen amen it was
[24:28] Samuel the prophet that said to King
[24:30] Saul that you have rejected the word of
[24:33] the Lord and God has rejected you as
[24:36] king surely this news must have
[24:39] spread people would have known what had
[24:42] happened how God had rejected
[24:45] Saul and we know not everybody will
[24:48] accept it like you see the character
[24:51] nebor when God had rejected Saul and God
[24:55] is choosing a new king Neal rejects the
[24:59] change nebal is the one that's not
[25:01] letting go of the light of another day
[25:05] he's holding on to a message up another
[25:08] day he's holding he's holding on to
[25:10] another message and the message has
[25:12] moved
[25:13] on because the prophet says Revelation
[25:16] is Progressive amen and the moment you
[25:19] stop and you say this is it you become a
[25:21] denomination you put a w around yourself
[25:23] because the word keeps opening and
[25:25] falling until we go into the translation
[25:30] and so Samuel went to the house of Jesse
[25:33] and we know that Samuel anointed a
[25:35] Shepherd boy to be king over
[25:37] Israel and when Saul got to hear about
[25:40] this he sought to kill
[25:42] David and you know what Saul is trying
[25:45] to do he's trying to kill the influence
[25:47] of David he's trying to kill the
[25:49] ministry of David he's trying to kill
[25:52] the word for this day and this age now s
[25:55] is not a person brother and sister what
[25:58] we preaching today Sol is not a person
[26:00] Sol is a spirit Spirit that spirit that
[26:03] rises up against change
[26:06] yes
[26:07] Saia he rejects the word of God Saul
[26:10] types the Pentecostal Church you notice
[26:14] here when Saul was anointed by Samuel
[26:17] the spirit of the Lord come upon him and
[26:19] he began to get into the spirit and
[26:22] prophesy and the people were asking he
[26:24] saw one of the prophets you see a of
[26:28] Pentecost a type of those with a
[26:31] Pentecostal understanding of the word in
[26:34] other words saw type a Pentecostal
[26:37] Revival and sa yeah he's the one that
[26:40] disbelieved the word of the prophet
[26:42] Samuel he rejected Samuel he rejects the
[26:45] progression of the
[26:48] word just like the Pentecostal
[26:51] church and Prophet William bam had come
[26:54] to a Pentecostal Church
[26:56] first but when the the word began to
[26:58] open up yes then they rejected the
[27:02] message they rejected the word and
[27:04] stayed as a denomination yes like when
[27:07] Jesus he had preached thousands that
[27:10] followed him big churches big revivals
[27:12] and then when he said eat my flesh and
[27:14] drink my blood it was giving the
[27:15] revelation of the seven SE amen that's
[27:18] when there was only 12 that remain and
[27:21] so we find it's the same thing here so
[27:23] long as the prophet could have healing
[27:25] and discernment all of those things that
[27:27] were B but when he said eat my flesh and
[27:30] drink my blood have a revelation of who
[27:32] he said right now then the numbers began
[27:34] to dwindle
[27:36] amen what happened a spirit of Sal comes
[27:39] upon the church and they reject the
[27:41] message of the hour
[27:43] amen amen the biggest problem that we
[27:46] have in the message is that we're
[27:48] holding on to a Pentecostal teaching of
[27:50] the word we are holding on to a
[27:53] Pentecostal understanding of the word
[27:55] and the prophet says when the seals have
[27:56] been opened the Bible becomes a brand
[27:58] new book Hallelujah you cannot read it
[28:02] the same you have to read it through a
[28:04] prop with eagle eyes
[28:08] amenah Glory now I just dropped this in
[28:11] here it just come to me when I was
[28:12] sitting in the room and I trust that it
[28:14] uh you will receive it well like like
[28:18] like like the Rapture and the coming of
[28:19] the
[28:20] Lord the Pentecost will have this big
[28:23] idea that there's going to be a great
[28:24] big meeting in the end and yet
[28:27] it's a secret catching away a secret
[28:30] catching away nobody is going to know it
[28:32] no one's going to see it he says there
[28:34] people going to go missing and people go
[28:36] missing every single day it's common for
[28:38] people to go missing and when the
[28:40] Rapture goes he says the people will go
[28:42] bride will go missing and the world will
[28:44] not even know it a secret catching way
[28:47] of the Lord yet a Pentecost
[28:50] understanding is he will come and all
[28:51] eyes will see him yes now you know Jesus
[28:55] himself spoke about his second coming m
[28:58] and you find out that Paul being a
[29:00] dispensational prophet he preached the
[29:02] second coming and you know that Paul
[29:05] never said what Jesus said all that Paul
[29:08] began to speak about is the Lord himself
[29:10] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[29:12] of voice in a trump now you know Jesus
[29:16] never said those words but you take
[29:18] Paul's words because Paul's a
[29:20] dispensational
[29:22] prophet now the Pentecostal
[29:24] understanding is that when he comes
[29:25] there's going to be a shout of voice a
[29:27] trump a resurrection a Rapture all is
[29:29] going to take place they put it in the
[29:32] future but now we had another
[29:34] dispensational prop oh yes William B is
[29:37] come and he preached the second coming
[29:39] of the Lord and he said the shout that
[29:43] Paul spoke about is a message that goes
[29:46] for Hallelujah in other words he's not
[29:48] putting in a future event he's saying
[29:50] the shot is on right now and the Paul
[29:53] says when he descends from Heaven he
[29:56] comes with a shout yes amen means that
[29:58] the coming of this Mighty Angel the
[30:00] coming of Christ he comes with a shout
[30:02] message amen now I'm trying to say
[30:04] something this morning oh thank is
[30:06] there's a denominational understanding
[30:08] that has been lurking around the message
[30:11] but now he Prophet now comes to take
[30:14] away the den denomination understanding
[30:16] of the scriptures amen amen there's a
[30:20] change in the kingship there's a change
[30:23] of dispensation it's leaving Saul and
[30:26] it's coming to King David amen yes so
[30:29] you find out Prophet shout is a message
[30:32] that goes forth and this message that
[30:34] goes for must be a rapturing
[30:37] message it must be a message that gives
[30:40] you rapturing faith and says rapturing
[30:43] faith lays in those standards which is
[30:45] in that seven seal means that the
[30:48] message that goes for is the message of
[30:50] the Seven Seals it's that message that
[30:53] goes for that will give us Rapture in FA
[30:56] that is the shout message that we are
[30:58] hearing and listening to brother
[31:00] sisters of course it's not a future
[31:03] event the Rapture process has started
[31:06] the bride now is feeding on the word the
[31:09] word is becoming flesh and says he says
[31:12] like your natural body it starts up in
[31:14] the wom of your mother it starts up from
[31:15] a little cell at that starts up at your
[31:18] spine and it grows cell upon cell upon
[31:21] cell Hallelujah he said if it's a cell
[31:23] of a human it'll produce a human the
[31:25] cell of a dog will produce a dog amen it
[31:27] says in the wh of a mother when the cell
[31:29] is fully formed then she burs that baby
[31:32] and probably the same thing with the
[31:34] bride of Christ she's eating the word
[31:37] and inside of her a word body is
[31:39] building and it's it's building word
[31:41] upon word upon word upon word and
[31:44] remember a human cell will produce a
[31:47] human body and a word cell must produce
[31:49] a word body inside of you there's a one
[31:52] body that is being built and one of
[31:55] these days when the body is ready we are
[31:57] going to B this body we are going to
[31:59] give birth to a body change and we are
[32:02] going to go into a
[32:03] rapur wonderful thank you so we are not
[32:07] holding on to a denom understanding of
[32:10] the word we know our day and our message
[32:13] we know what's happening brothers and
[32:14] sisters the first coming the first
[32:17] coming was a prophecy and there were
[32:20] scribes there were Pharisees there were
[32:21] priests there were all lot of holy
[32:23] people and yet none of them knew the
[32:25] hour they none of knew the day of the
[32:29] first coming except one person Mary and
[32:32] to Mary was revealed the day the hour
[32:36] the moment she's the one had birth pain
[32:38] she's the one had an angel visitation
[32:40] she's the one that knew about the coming
[32:42] and she's the one that took the message
[32:44] to Elizabeth and spoke about that coming
[32:47] amen it is the same yesterday today and
[32:50] forever the second coming will not be
[32:52] any different it must an angel must
[32:55] visit another Mary a virgin of the word
[32:57] and the angel has come brothers and
[32:59] sisters and he has told us that we've
[33:01] been highly favored and we have received
[33:04] the message of the hour we know about
[33:06] the second coming we know the when the
[33:08] how we know his nature we know him this
[33:11] hour because it must be revealed to us
[33:13] hallelujah hallelujah you love the
[33:16] Lord notice here David in the Bible
[33:19] David said the word of the Lord have I
[33:21] hid in my heart and we read the life of
[33:24] David he was just a humble Shepherd boy
[33:27] that was going to become king but God
[33:29] chose him God called him God by for
[33:32] knowledge known the heart of David you
[33:34] know I was saying I just dropped this in
[33:36] here I was saying to somebody you know
[33:38] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[33:41] yet David was so so full of
[33:44] false so full of mistakes David
[33:46] committed adultery he even killed bba's
[33:49] husband to have her as his own wife and
[33:51] yet God said David a man after my own
[33:53] heart because the heart of God is a
[33:55] forgiving heart am amen and and the
[33:58] prophet says he says a righteous man is
[34:01] not a sinless man but a man that knows
[34:03] how to repent when he makes a mistake he
[34:05] says that what that's what David was
[34:08] David was not a right he was a righteous
[34:10] man because he knew how to confess his
[34:12] sins to the LA amen and that's what
[34:14] makes him a man after God's Own
[34:16] Heart yet David says the word of the
[34:18] Lord have I hidden my heart that I will
[34:20] not sin against it we know the word is
[34:23] Christ it's Christ the word that's
[34:25] hidden his heart Christ hiding in
[34:28] Simplicity and he always hides in
[34:29] Simplicity and he reveals himself in the
[34:32] same way David said the word is in my
[34:35] heart and that he will not sin against
[34:38] God and sin his unbelief in other words
[34:41] that I will not disbelieve the word of
[34:43] the Lord in my day and age David was
[34:46] anointed of God to be king of an
[34:49] everlasting Kingdom the scripture says
[34:52] and David says I will hide the word in
[34:55] my heart I will not die about the
[34:57] promised word for my day and for my age
[35:00] when doubts
[35:02] arise and doubts arise about God's word
[35:05] doubts arise about who we are David is
[35:08] saying the word have I hid in my heart I
[35:10] will not disbelieve I will not
[35:13] doubt David here is full of
[35:16] Trials his life is full of
[35:18] discouragements and disappointments but
[35:20] yet he was still the anointed of God
[35:23] anointed king by prophet
[35:25] Samuel you find out yeah that he was
[35:27] rejected by Saul Saul tried many times
[35:31] to kill David now you have to be in the
[35:34] spiritual yeah that Saul is trying to K
[35:37] kill the influence of the ministry of
[35:39] David amen yes when you think that Saul
[35:43] should be
[35:44] spiritual Saul should show a spirit of
[35:48] meekness Saul should be accepting God's
[35:50] Will and God's word yes Saul is
[35:53] persecuting the anointed of God for the
[35:55] day yes yeah Saul was rejecting the new
[36:00] day Saul was rejecting the new message
[36:03] Saul was was rejecting the new
[36:06] dispensation Saul was rejecting the new
[36:09] king that David had to stand the
[36:12] persecution because he knew who he was
[36:15] and he knew the promised work for the
[36:18] day am that's why he can say the word of
[36:22] the Lord have I hid in my heart I will
[36:25] not disbelieve the promises that were
[36:27] made in this day through a prophet a
[36:29] prophet Samuel
[36:32] amen
[36:34] hallelujah praise the Lord just going to
[36:36] skip a little
[36:37] bit the word is hid in the heart and the
[36:41] word does not just come into any heart
[36:44] because the Bible says the heart of a
[36:46] man is Stony yes man is born in sin man
[36:50] is born with
[36:52] disbelief his birth is Stony he's not
[36:55] created in a natural bird to hide God in
[36:58] his heart and yet David says I hide the
[37:00] word of the Lord in my heart how do you
[37:02] get a heart in a condition to receive
[37:04] the word because David could say Lord
[37:06] create in me a clean heart renew a right
[37:10] Spirit within me a man's heart is a
[37:12] Stony heart but it needs to change and
[37:14] receive the word of the Lord in his
[37:16] heart amen the prophet says the heart of
[37:18] man thinks he knows more than God he
[37:22] says and God cannot touch that Stony
[37:24] heart so when a man can humble himself
[37:27] and realize it's it's not what I know
[37:30] but it's what you will show me to the
[37:32] prophet to the message to to your
[37:34] scriptures this
[37:35] hourl God's ways and God's nature does
[37:38] not change amen the moment the man
[37:40] thinks like the man thinks he knows more
[37:43] than God then his heart becomes a ston
[37:45] God cannot reveal anymore to amen that's
[37:49] right the Bible says about the word of
[37:51] God he says I'll write my laws in your
[37:53] heart in the tablets of your hearts mean
[37:56] I will put my word into your heart and I
[37:58] will change the heart of a man amen take
[38:01] away the Stony art like Ezekiel said and
[38:04] put a heart of Flesh now put my spirit
[38:06] in you which is the holy spirit but says
[38:09] when the Holy Spirit comes into a man he
[38:11] says it changes the nature of the man
[38:13] amen hallelujah so that your spirit can
[38:15] get on with his Spirit yes there's no
[38:18] thinking faculties in the heart and yet
[38:21] the scripture says as a man think it in
[38:22] his heart and says he says why he said
[38:26] because in the heart of a man is a place
[38:28] called a soul yes amen he says in that
[38:31] that Soul there is a place where God
[38:33] comes and dwells in a man amen he says
[38:35] that place there is the Throne of God
[38:37] Almighty himself the influence of man
[38:40] comes from the soul and son and a
[38:42] daughter of God that's born again
[38:44] baptized in the Holy Spirit God dwells
[38:46] in the soul of the man that becomes the
[38:48] controll Tower of that man God comes and
[38:51] sits in the place and a man does not
[38:53] think with his head out that he starts
[38:55] to think with his heart amen the
[38:57] influence comes from God himself sitting
[38:59] on the
[39:00] throne praise the Lord as a man think it
[39:03] in his heart man has always had the
[39:06] tendency to reason the word with his
[39:08] mind and that's why a man is not allowed
[39:11] to think with his mind but to think with
[39:13] his heart yes to believe to have
[39:16] faith you know I'm just I'm just
[39:18] skipping my notes here but you know the
[39:20] Lord said to Moses he said to Moses he
[39:23] said he said I'm going to speak to you
[39:26] I'm going to speak to you and through
[39:28] you to the people but I'm going to speak
[39:30] mouth to mouth
[39:31] Yes you know why the Lord was speaking
[39:34] mou to mount to Moses because at the
[39:36] burning bush the Lord said to Moses I've
[39:39] called you to go and deliver my people
[39:41] and then Moses all of these excuses all
[39:43] of this all of the reasons why Moses
[39:45] could not do it Moses was a stammerer
[39:49] and Mo and and Pharaoh had a big army he
[39:51] says how will Pharaoh believe in all of
[39:53] those things and Moses was reasoning in
[39:55] his mind yes why God was speaking Moses
[39:58] was hearing and Moses was reasoning in
[40:00] his
[40:01] mind and so the Lord come to Mo and says
[40:04] now this time in the wilderness he says
[40:05] I'm not going to speak you like that now
[40:07] I'm going to speak mouth to mouth he
[40:09] going to come from the mouth of God
[40:11] through the mouth of the Prophet it's
[40:12] going to bypass his hearing bypass his
[40:15] thinking bypass his understanding amen
[40:18] bypass human reasoning amen what I'm
[40:22] saying this morning is that's how God
[40:24] speaks amen not our years this morning
[40:28] where it goes into our mind and then we
[40:29] have to reason it to the Natural mind it
[40:32] has to make sense to us amen but God is
[40:34] going to speak mouth to mouth God is
[40:36] going to speak from the heart to the
[40:38] mouth God is going to speak where it's
[40:40] no more man's intellect man's reasoning
[40:42] and man's understanding but man now must
[40:44] believe by faith the things that he he
[40:46] and God speaks through great
[40:50] Prophets You Love the Lord amen you noce
[40:54] here David is on the run from
[40:57] Saul and um he passes by the sheep and
[41:01] the servants are
[41:02] neighbor and the pro and the Bible says
[41:05] here that the prophet Samuel is dead but
[41:08] you notice the prophet is off the scene
[41:10] but the prophet introduced a new king
[41:13] amen the prophet you pointed to another
[41:16] king the prophet you pointed to another
[41:19] one in other words what Samuel is what
[41:22] Sam's happening in the life of Samuel is
[41:24] not I as decrease now he must increase
[41:28] to catch the mystery of David Saul was
[41:31] anointed with a vial of oil which a vile
[41:33] is just a small bottle a measure of oil
[41:37] but David was anointed with a horn of
[41:39] oil mean that David was anointed with a
[41:42] greater measure of the word of the Holy
[41:44] Ghost the horn speaks of power the horn
[41:48] is the word and the horn speaks of power
[41:52] the word has the power to change the
[41:55] horn is the word but the oil in the
[41:57] heart is the Holy Ghost other words
[41:59] David in Ty is Anointed with the
[42:02] fullness which is the word and the
[42:05] spirit the Dynamics and the mechanics he
[42:08] becomes in t the fullness of
[42:12] God in the book of Christ The Mystery of
[42:14] God reveal the prophet says the fullness
[42:17] is back in the church amen amen in other
[42:20] words if the fullness is back in the
[42:22] church means the one that is Anointed
[42:24] with the Horn of oil has come Amen in
[42:27] other words we are not living under the
[42:29] dispensation of Saul the king but the
[42:31] church now is moved to David the king
[42:34] that has come Anointed with the fullness
[42:37] that is back in the
[42:39] church you love the Lord
[42:43] am you look at the
[42:46] scripture so here has the tip you
[42:49] can in scripture of 1 Chronicles chapter
[42:52] 2:15 the Bible says David is the Seventh
[42:55] Son of Jesse
[42:57] which means it times the L this in
[42:59] church
[43:00] age but if you read 1st Samuel chapter
[43:03] 17 it says David was the eighth son of
[43:06] Jesse yes and of course if you read the
[43:09] Bible with just natural eyes it looks
[43:11] like a
[43:12] contradiction but to my understanding I
[43:14] don't see any
[43:16] contradiction because this Prophet came
[43:18] to call a bride of Jesus Christ you know
[43:22] the prophet says that we are not in the
[43:24] ludin churches yes
[43:26] we are not in the Methodist churches he
[43:29] says we not even in the Pentecostal
[43:31] churches he said but we are in the
[43:33] bright
[43:34] age Amen in other words what the prophet
[43:37] William had come to do he' come to that
[43:39] seven Church age Hallelujah he' come to
[43:42] call a bride out of the seventh but he's
[43:45] taking her out of the seven into the
[43:47] bride which becomes in type the eight
[43:49] amen so you notice in Tye David David is
[43:52] of the seven in the one scripture but in
[43:54] another scripture David is up the
[43:57] eight why the seventh is of the eight
[43:59] and the eight is of the
[44:01] seventh in other words the church is
[44:03] being called under the ministry of David
[44:06] is called out of the Pentecostal age
[44:08] into the bright
[44:10] age Hallelujah there has to be a bright
[44:14] age this is the Eighth Day not the
[44:16] eighth age we are not in the Pentecostal
[44:19] age we in the bright age when the age of
[44:21] the open door amen Revelation 3 is the
[44:25] seven such ages but Revelation 4 is an
[44:29] Open Door amen Amber man says the door
[44:32] is Christ means the open door is the
[44:35] open revealed Christ taking us out of
[44:38] the lean Church of Revelation chapter 3
[44:41] into the bright age amen you love the
[44:44] Lord
[44:46] amen I'm showing in typ here the
[44:49] ministry of David brothers and
[44:52] sisters in the temple in the most holy
[44:54] place this there's a lampstand with
[44:57] seven lamps types to seven Church age
[45:01] yes but the high priest does not stay
[45:03] there he goes into the most holy place
[45:06] he goes beyond the seven candlesticks he
[45:09] goes beyond the seven Church ages he's
[45:11] going beyond the church age light he
[45:13] going into the sh light he's going into
[45:15] the bright light Hallelujah the
[45:17] scripture says we are made Kings and
[45:19] Priests hallelujah mean that if we are
[45:21] Kings and Priests we are not living in
[45:23] the church AG life amen we have to leave
[45:26] the church a light of the Holy place and
[45:28] go into the most holy place we have to
[45:30] go into the sh light which is a bright
[45:33] light because we are Kings and Priests
[45:35] amen we have to come out of the
[45:37] Pentecostal age and we have to go into
[45:39] the bright age the seventh is of the eth
[45:42] and the E is of the seventh we're coming
[45:44] out of the seventh but we are going into
[45:46] the E
[45:47] amen and our King is King
[45:51] David you love the Lord praise the Lord
[45:56] we're moving into the eth we're coming
[45:58] out of the seventh the E types
[46:02] eternity you know that every prophet and
[46:05] messenger from Genesis to Revelation was
[46:08] subject to
[46:09] time they had a beginning and they had
[46:12] an end but in this day we have been
[46:15] introduced to Christ we have been
[46:18] introduced to the one that comes after
[46:20] the seventh messenger he is the eighth
[46:22] one but he is the Eternal one amen amen
[46:26] and when he comes he says time shall be
[46:28] no more am in other words he coming out
[46:31] of time he going into the
[46:33] eight you love the Lord amen all the
[46:38] prophets of time were born in flesh but
[46:42] this one that comes is not from time is
[46:45] from
[46:46] eternity it's Christ himself the word
[46:48] that has come Heaven that will pass away
[46:50] pass away but the word shall remain the
[46:53] word himself Has Come Today that's why
[46:56] the angel said time shall be no more
[46:58] means that it's there's no more Earthly
[47:01] Messengers now it's in Heavenly
[47:03] messenger it's no more messengers of
[47:06] time but it's a messenger of Eternity
[47:09] that's coming to take a bride that comes
[47:11] from eternity and she's going back to
[47:13] Eternity yes amen
[47:16] thank he who started the work in the
[47:20] beginning will be the one that will
[47:22] finish the work Hallelujah the one that
[47:25] started it was the one from eternity
[47:28] that come in Eden he was the messenger
[47:31] at Eden he was the Eternal messenger
[47:34] that come down in Eden now after all the
[47:37] messengers of time have come and gone
[47:40] the one that started in Eden is the same
[47:42] one that comes today and he'll finish
[47:44] the work and take us in a Rapture not a
[47:47] messenger of time but a messenger of
[47:50] Eternity and he says time shall be no
[47:54] more
[47:59] you love the Lord amen amen you notice
[48:04] here that Samuel had to introduce
[48:07] David and then Samuel had to
[48:11] decrease means that when the prophet
[48:13] introduces the King King David he must
[48:16] decrease so King David can
[48:19] increase and says the seventh angel is
[48:22] on Earth at the coming of the mighty
[48:24] Angel amen and the coming of the mighty
[48:26] angel that means that Samuel of today
[48:28] must decrease so he can
[48:32] increase now the story of David when
[48:34] David comes he sends word and he greets
[48:37] neighbor and he's greeting and he says
[48:39] to his men greet him in my
[48:42] name now if you if you listen to the
[48:44] proverb says what is the name of the
[48:46] Lord it says the name of the Lord is the
[48:49] word interpreted for your day in other
[48:52] words what David is saying to his men go
[48:54] and give neighbor the revelation of the
[48:56] word for today go and reveal to nebor
[49:00] that there's a new anointed king amen
[49:02] amen means GRE him in my name means
[49:05] preach this message go and preach
[49:07] Revelation 10 go and preach the one that
[49:10] has come today tell him greet him in my
[49:12] name the name of the Lord is the word
[49:14] revealed for your day yes and he says to
[49:19] nabal
[49:21] shalom means at his coming there's a
[49:24] message of shalom amise Lord if you read
[49:27] the message Shalom if you know says he
[49:32] appeared on Sunset yes 1963 he said it's
[49:35] our Lord up there he said and his
[49:37] message is Shalom his King David has
[49:41] come and yeah he's come to neighbor he
[49:44] says bre them in my name means give him
[49:46] the interpretation of what is happening
[49:48] today who has come who is the anointed
[49:50] king neighbor rejects that word but his
[49:53] message is Shalom the some somebody that
[49:56] has to catch a shallow
[49:59] message you love the Lord
[50:02] amen remember David is the king and he's
[50:06] King from the tribe of Judah means the
[50:09] lion of the tribe of Judah yes amen the
[50:12] coming King means he type Revelation
[50:15] 101 King
[50:17] Shalom King
[50:19] MDC the one that is coming in this hour
[50:22] in this day notice neighor
[50:26] the Bible Bible says nebal is a very
[50:29] rich
[50:30] man in other words he's rich is
[50:34] increased in
[50:35] Goods is the type of Leia yes is the
[50:39] type of those under the Pentecostal
[50:41] teaching of the word now I want to say
[50:43] this brothers and
[50:45] sisters you know if you read the Bible
[50:47] as a Bible story then the Bible is a
[50:50] closed book to you yes yes that's right
[50:54] and it makes it just a dead story book
[50:57] but the scripture say he's the same
[50:58] yesterday today and forever amen and
[51:00] when you read the scripture you have to
[51:02] see your day and your message in the
[51:04] scripture the Bible says the prophets
[51:07] the kings of old they type Jesus Christ
[51:10] but the women of the Bible types the
[51:13] Bride of Jesus Christ and every time you
[51:16] read about Abigail Sarah Rebecca and all
[51:19] of those zoom in you got to see yourself
[51:20] in scripture and those characters has to
[51:23] become alive in you
[51:26] because all of those Natures that laid
[51:27] in those woman the nature of Sarah the
[51:29] nature of Rebecca the nature of Ruth all
[51:32] of those Natures of those woman they're
[51:34] actually inside of the the soul of you
[51:36] and I the very character the very Gene
[51:40] the very nature is inside of us all that
[51:42] is waiting for is a light of the word to
[51:44] go over to come over the the gene of
[51:47] those characters and it'll bring it to
[51:48] life in your amen because if Mary was a
[51:52] type who is she a type of IFC was a type
[51:56] who he should type off if Ru is a type
[51:58] who is should type off yes if Abigail is
[52:00] a type who is should type off and if we
[52:03] are the real person then we must be able
[52:05] to express all of those characters and
[52:07] attribute in this
[52:09] day we don't read this Bible as a Bible
[52:12] story we don't read it as a closed book
[52:15] but it's an open book and characters
[52:17] become alive in our day and our
[52:20] age and so if there was a neighbor that
[52:22] was rejecting the word and there was an
[52:24] Abigail that was going to receive it I
[52:26] believe I'm speaking to Abigail this
[52:28] morning am amen those that will catch
[52:30] the Revelation those that will see the
[52:32] season change those that will see the
[52:34] dispensation change those that will see
[52:37] the king king of Judah the lion of the
[52:39] tribe of Judah coming in this hour those
[52:42] that don't hear a message from prophet
[52:43] Samuel and know that he has
[52:48] come you love the Lord am
[52:53] Abigails it it they won't manif faes
[52:56] they'll respond when it's revealed am
[53:00] amen glory thank you Lord NE he is Rich
[53:04] and increased in Goods the type of
[53:06] leysia blind wretched and naked don't
[53:08] even know him means he types A leodis in
[53:10] jur and he rejects the message of David
[53:13] he rejects the coming of the anointed
[53:15] work for his day amen yet the wife
[53:19] Abigail the time of the Bride she has a
[53:22] revelation that there's a change of the
[53:24] Kings am amen I haven't got time to do
[53:26] it this morning but if you read the
[53:28] scripture she prophesies about
[53:31] David abigael recognizes a day and a
[53:35] message she recognizes the change in
[53:38] dispensation there's a change in the
[53:40] drum beat of God's
[53:42] musical Neal did not receive the change
[53:45] but Abigail caught the
[53:48] change why the Bible says she was a
[53:50] woman of understanding means a woman of
[53:53] Revelation and I believe she's here this
[53:55] morning amen she heard the beat change
[53:59] she's with the program of God the
[54:02] prophet speaks of a symphony we'll try
[54:04] and close it up with this because I'm
[54:05] trying to just bring a point this
[54:08] morning and I'd love to speak about
[54:10] abigel because there's so much of
[54:13] things around her life but but the
[54:17] inspiration this morning is to bring
[54:19] this point through you brother mam
[54:21] speaks about a
[54:23] musical he speaks about about a
[54:26] symphony he speaks about a music
[54:29] orchestra a musical play or a musical
[54:33] drama and he said you take the music
[54:35] piece written by beatoven he says
[54:37] beatoven is the composer of that
[54:41] Musical and he writes a musical and it's
[54:44] an antitype of God type of God where God
[54:48] uh be types God God is this great
[54:52] composer God is a composer of his own
[54:56] Symphony his own Musical and the prophet
[55:00] says the Symphony of God is the word of
[55:02] God so like beat oven composes a a
[55:07] symphony God himself is this great
[55:09] composer and the symphony is a symphony
[55:12] of his
[55:13] word and just like Pete over the
[55:16] composer he knows the beginning from the
[55:18] end God knows the beginning from the end
[55:21] of his musical
[55:23] amen yes God knows knows this drama how
[55:26] it's going to play out yes amen God
[55:28] knows the characters in this drama thank
[55:30] God knows all things about this drama
[55:33] and and we have this drama in our hands
[55:36] daily daily we are reading a symphony
[55:39] daily we are reading God's musical daily
[55:42] we are seeing Junctions and and musicals
[55:44] and sounds and pauses and all of those
[55:46] things in the word of God daily we are
[55:48] reading and we are seeing dispensational
[55:53] changes probably only composer knows the
[55:56] beginning from the
[55:57] ending God is the only one that knows
[55:59] the beginning from the
[56:01] ending and he knows how this drama is
[56:03] going to play
[56:05] out now the P said there's a director of
[56:08] the musical amen the director is the one
[56:11] with a little back stick in his hand and
[56:14] he's the one that he directs the entire
[56:17] Orchestra the symphony yes and so the
[56:20] musicians they watch him they watch his
[56:22] hand movement and they follow the
[56:24] director amen amen amen now you have to
[56:27] follow the director carefully cuz if you
[56:30] don't follow the director carefully
[56:31] you're going to have a big
[56:33] noise you're going to mess up the whole
[56:36] musical you're going to mess up the
[56:37] whole
[56:42] Symphony now the prophet says in order
[56:44] for the director to direct the symphony
[56:46] correctly he says that the director must
[56:49] get into the spirit of beat over yes
[56:52] amen so that it can be line upon line
[56:55] precept upon precept amen the director
[56:58] sometime they call him the
[57:00] conductor and he saids that if the if he
[57:04] does not get into the spirit of the
[57:07] composer then he'll just mess up the
[57:09] whole
[57:10] piece oh yeah you'll have a gr a cow
[57:13] eating grass on the
[57:15] treetop will misin temper the word
[57:18] dislocate the word misplace the word the
[57:21] director or the conductor of the
[57:24] Symphony of God is this Prophet William
[57:26] BR that is coming this
[57:28] day he coming he's been directing the
[57:31] symphony for us brother and sisters yes
[57:34] amen and the problem says what happens
[57:37] to the director when he gets into the
[57:39] spirit of beatoven he says then the
[57:42] spirit of beov comes into
[57:45] him now Hebrews 1 verse1 God who had Su
[57:49] times in divers manners spake in times
[57:52] pass unto the prophets but unto the
[57:54] fathers by the prophets you know says
[57:58] that the word by is the wrong word that
[58:00] is used there he says God did not speak
[58:03] by the prophets God speaks in the
[58:06] prophets now the word comes in the
[58:09] prophets and the prophets give out the
[58:11] word here is our Prophet that is a
[58:15] director of this musical he gets into
[58:18] the spirit of the composer in other
[58:21] words the spirit of the composer must
[58:22] come into this prophet in order for him
[58:25] to direct a musical not for him to take
[58:28] us to the word and reveal the mysteries
[58:30] of this
[58:32] Bible you love the Lord amen it's the
[58:36] same thing with us this morning yes if
[58:39] we get into the spirit of the
[58:41] composer then the spirit of the composer
[58:43] will come into US
[58:45] amen the anointed word will come into US
[58:48] lighting up the scripture for our
[58:50] day but says there's too many directors
[58:55] there's too many directors that are not
[58:57] in the spirit of the composer amen
[58:59] that's right he says that is why the
[59:01] symphony is not in harmony with the
[59:03] music
[59:05] sheet then you got different doctrin
[59:07] different things different ideas Creeds
[59:09] and dogmas he says they're not in tune
[59:12] with the with the Sy with the with the
[59:15] composer not in harmony too many
[59:18] directors not in the spirit of the
[59:20] composer they're making Creed they're
[59:22] following a tradition of a Pentecostal
[59:24] teaching teaching bringing
[59:25] denominational Traditions into the
[59:27] message of yah
[59:30] amen then it sounds all fuzzy and
[59:32] muzzled up because the directors have
[59:34] not come into harmony with the
[59:37] composer they're beating up something
[59:39] that's not in the
[59:42] word we've got to get into the Promised
[59:44] word for our day amen going to read you
[59:48] a few quotations just to kind of tie
[59:50] this whole thing up in the Shalom
[59:53] message 641 1 12 paragraph
[59:56] 166 64112 Shalom parag 166 he said well
[1:00:02] let me give you some T here just a
[1:00:03] minute do you know what a symphony is he
[1:00:06] says I know you do it's a music It's a
[1:00:08] drama I see they act it out you little
[1:00:11] children you'll understand you remember
[1:00:12] in school I believe you have what is
[1:00:14] called the little Russian Symphony
[1:00:17] sometimes they act out on the drums you
[1:00:19] know it's called the little
[1:00:21] woodpecker and that got in into the
[1:00:24] woods and they had the fluttering and
[1:00:26] the beating on the drums and the things
[1:00:29] and you hear all you hear all as you go
[1:00:31] through the symphony as they played they
[1:00:33] play it I forget the name of that Peter
[1:00:35] and the Wolf that's right Peter and the
[1:00:37] Wolf that's a Russian
[1:00:39] Symphony uh they don't they don't have
[1:00:42] they have little figures flying around
[1:00:44] playing it out but they play it on drums
[1:00:47] but KN in some words and make drums and
[1:00:51] sounds and things and it plays out it
[1:00:53] acts so you understand
[1:00:56] plays so 168 he says now to you ad the
[1:00:59] scripture is God's
[1:01:01] Symphony yes Hallelujah he says only the
[1:01:03] composer which is God he knows what it
[1:01:06] really means and he reveals it to those
[1:01:08] who are
[1:01:09] listening who are interested in knowing
[1:01:12] what the drama is amen but you have to
[1:01:15] know about a symphony first you see it's
[1:01:18] not just something you see it's changing
[1:01:21] this Junctions of the word of the music
[1:01:23] it throws sometime it's going this way
[1:01:25] for a while and a certain beat after
[1:01:28] after a while it changes around what is
[1:01:31] it to to you who wouldn't understand it
[1:01:34] or don't know nothing about it not
[1:01:36] interested in it it's just a racket it's
[1:01:39] a fuss but to those who know about it
[1:01:42] they are watching for it they know it's
[1:01:45] coming hallelujah hallelujah thank you
[1:01:48] Lord unquote God's word is the symphony
[1:01:53] the Bible is God's music music sheet yes
[1:01:55] we had a prophet that got into the
[1:01:57] spirit of the composer that went into
[1:01:59] the thoughts of God amen amen and it
[1:02:02] told us about this God who was
[1:02:04] Elohim God that was self-existing God
[1:02:07] that existed and covered all space and
[1:02:09] time and this God had inside of him
[1:02:13] attributes and inside of this God was a
[1:02:16] symphony a symphony of his word a
[1:02:20] musical a Musical sheet that he wanted
[1:02:22] to express amen
[1:02:25] means that God who was Elohim St
[1:02:28] existing he wanted to write out a
[1:02:30] Musical sheet so he began to condescend
[1:02:33] and he began to change his form and
[1:02:35] express the symphony in the
[1:02:38] logos the Elohim began to change from
[1:02:41] Spirit being into the word into the
[1:02:43] logos from invisible to something that
[1:02:45] become visible he become the symphony
[1:02:48] himself the logos the
[1:02:50] word the first thing he does in this
[1:02:53] Symphony
[1:02:55] like all Symphonies he starts now to
[1:02:58] create
[1:02:59] Angels listen we are talking about the
[1:03:01] Symphony of God Amen his word he starts
[1:03:05] to create Angels because says he was not
[1:03:07] even God yet he was Elohim himself
[1:03:09] existing God means object of worship and
[1:03:11] so he creates Angel and watch how the
[1:03:13] symphony starts angels that created
[1:03:15] angels start to sing holy holy holy is
[1:03:19] the Lord God Almighty can you hear it
[1:03:21] this morning brothers and sisters amen
[1:03:23] God before the foundation of the world
[1:03:25] when everything was silent he existed
[1:03:27] alone but inside of him was a Musical
[1:03:30] sheet inside of him was a symphony
[1:03:33] inside of him was attributes and he
[1:03:35] wanted to write out this Symphony he
[1:03:37] began to express himself into the L of
[1:03:39] the word he creates angels and the
[1:03:41] symphony starts amen holy holy holy to
[1:03:45] the Lord God Almighty now we are
[1:03:47] listening to the symphony that started

[1:12:38] not tired of
[1:12:42] me let me give you an
[1:12:45] example what the prophet is saying about
[1:12:47] the drum beat that
[1:12:50] changes if you're watching a musical
[1:12:53] drama while you're watching a
[1:12:55] film and the scene is a very exciting
[1:12:59] scene then what the drums will do the
[1:13:01] drums actually giv you the beat for that
[1:13:03] scene and the drum
[1:13:07] goes or something like right there and
[1:13:09] everybody know it's a happy excited
[1:13:11] scene and they all caught up they under
[1:13:14] expectation for a nice scene but if the
[1:13:17] scene is going to change and in some
[1:13:19] maybe some
[1:13:21] Forest some prehistoric
[1:13:24] dinosaur is going to come and just bite
[1:13:26] everyone's heads off then the drum beat
[1:13:28] has to change that's what the prophet
[1:13:30] saying and the drum beat is telling you
[1:13:32] about the change yes and the drum beat
[1:13:35] is is is expressing the scene that's and
[1:13:38] then the drum beat from a from a happy
[1:13:40] beat he'll go
[1:13:44] to so people he the drum beat and
[1:13:47] suddenly they know oh the scene has
[1:13:49] changed there no more happy scene but
[1:13:51] they looking because something is going
[1:13:53] to happen that's going to change the
[1:13:55] atmosphere hallelujah amen so brother is
[1:13:58] saying here that there is a drum beat of
[1:14:01] change and those that are listening and
[1:14:03] looking they know when the beat of the
[1:14:05] Dum is changing amen they know to expect
[1:14:08] something different to happen am amen
[1:14:11] you love the Lord
[1:14:14] amen with that in mind paragraph 210 the
[1:14:18] same book it says when the real word of
[1:14:22] God falls upon the Vindicator upon the
[1:14:25] seed they see the Vindication of the
[1:14:27] word they recognize it they're looking
[1:14:29] at the word they know the junction they
[1:14:30] know the time they know the change they
[1:14:32] know the beat that's supposed to be in
[1:14:34] that
[1:14:35] hour Hallelujah they know the beat they
[1:14:37] know the time they know how it's
[1:14:39] supposed to go you see only the elect
[1:14:42] knows
[1:14:49] it let me just
[1:14:52] one the elect
[1:14:54] catches the the beat
[1:14:57] change the elect catches the change of
[1:15:01] dispensation yes the elect who types who
[1:15:03] types advate she's the one that realized
[1:15:06] that there was a change in King the
[1:15:09] proph say only the composer knows the
[1:15:10] word what the word really means he
[1:15:13] reveals it to those who are listening
[1:15:15] those who are interested in knowing what
[1:15:17] the drum beat is telling us let's put it
[1:15:21] together like this the Pharisees and the
[1:15:25] Sadducees 2,000 years ago the scribes
[1:15:29] holy men of the Bible they were reading
[1:15:32] God's music sheet called the
[1:15:34] Torah they were reading the music sheet
[1:15:37] and they were waiting for messiah to
[1:15:40] come you understand what I'm saying with
[1:15:42] all of these things now won't become
[1:15:44] nonsense and an
[1:15:46] noise they're reading a music sheet
[1:15:49] they're waiting for the Messiah to come
[1:15:53] but the problem with the Sadducees and
[1:15:55] the Pharisees they were not in the
[1:15:57] spirit of the
[1:15:58] composer means the spirit of the
[1:16:00] composer was not inside of
[1:16:03] them they could not recognize the drum
[1:16:06] beat of
[1:16:08] change they had the very messiah in
[1:16:10] their midst God veiled in human
[1:16:14] flesh but yet they were stuck in another
[1:16:17] scene of the
[1:16:19] symphony what they were reading in the
[1:16:21] music sheet was an actual scene that had
[1:16:24] taken place that's what they said Moses
[1:16:28] and Moses and Moses said this and Moses
[1:16:30] gave and Moses was that in the music
[1:16:32] sheet yes that was in the music sheet
[1:16:35] amen was that a scene in God's music she
[1:16:37] sheet yes it was a scene but the scene
[1:16:40] had played out and the scene had changed
[1:16:42] there was a drum beat of change Moses
[1:16:45] said the Lord thy God he would send a
[1:16:47] prophet liken unto me and this Prophet
[1:16:50] was standing in human flesh and the
[1:16:52] Pharisees SES they're reading the God's
[1:16:55] Symphony they're reading God's musical
[1:16:58] but they are stuck in the old scene yes
[1:17:00] like what answer the greatest deception
[1:17:03] in the church is living in a glare off
[1:17:05] another day amen mean that you're
[1:17:07] feasting on the word that had come
[1:17:09] yesterday and you're missing what he is
[1:17:11] doing right now right amen the problem
[1:17:13] with the church always has been is
[1:17:15] you're thanking God for what he done
[1:17:17] we're praising God for what he's going
[1:17:18] to do but we are missing what God is
[1:17:20] doing right now and the sad is Pharisees
[1:17:23] we thankk God for Moses Moses said
[1:17:25] there'll be a prophet Moses said
[1:17:27] there'll be a messiah and Messiah was
[1:17:29] there and they were missing the
[1:17:31] unfolding and the drum beat of
[1:17:34] change why they were not in the spirit
[1:17:36] of the composer they were stuck in Old
[1:17:39] scene the very Messiah was robed in
[1:17:42] human flesh and they missed it brothers
[1:17:44] and
[1:17:46] sisters worshiping the god of Moses
[1:17:49] worshiping the Wilderness God worshiping
[1:17:52] the god that appear appeared in a PO of
[1:17:53] fire worshiping the god that appeared in
[1:17:56] the cloud worshiping the God that was
[1:17:58] behind Badger skin in the
[1:18:00] temple but the same God had changed his
[1:18:03] tent from Badger skin to human skin
[1:18:06] veils in Jesus Christ and they missed
[1:18:08] the drum be of
[1:18:10] change but they were reading the
[1:18:12] musical they failed to see God
[1:18:15] materialized in front of them yes they
[1:18:18] were at a junction and they missed it
[1:18:21] they heard the noise
[1:18:23] but they had wanted nothing to do with
[1:18:25] the noise the crowd was making a noise
[1:18:28] people were testifying the blind were
[1:18:30] seeing the dead were being raised they
[1:18:33] heard the noise they heard the musical
[1:18:35] but to them it was a big noise why they
[1:18:38] were not in the spirit of the composer
[1:18:40] they did not get into the rhythm of the
[1:18:42] music they missed the drum beat of
[1:18:45] change amen when they were given the
[1:18:47] opportunity to said crucify Jesus give
[1:18:51] us barabus
[1:18:53] you see they could not read the music
[1:18:54] she right they kept looking back stuck
[1:18:58] in the old scene but yet in the very
[1:19:01] same day there was a woman at the
[1:19:04] well she come on a normal day to the
[1:19:07] well yes she's attracted to the Waters
[1:19:10] of Life what seemed like a normal day
[1:19:12] for her she comes and she meets a man
[1:19:16] she meets a man which looks like every
[1:19:18] other Normal Man nothing different about
[1:19:20] Jesus he looked like a Jewish man he
[1:19:23] dressed like a Jewish man he spoke like
[1:19:25] a Jewish man she even said it's not
[1:19:29] right for a Jew to speak to Samaritan
[1:19:31] why because in whatever he was he looked
[1:19:34] like a Jew so common so simple he just
[1:19:37] Blended in with the crowd and that's why
[1:19:40] sades and Pharisees and all of them
[1:19:42] missed it but yes this woman yeah the
[1:19:45] Samaritan woman she comes to the well on
[1:19:47] a normal
[1:19:48] day and a conversation begins to take
[1:19:51] place
[1:19:54] and the prophet says he is contacting
[1:19:56] her spirit but while he is contacting
[1:19:59] her spirit she's getting into the spirit
[1:20:01] of the composer
[1:20:03] too there's something happening on both
[1:20:06] ends when he's Discerning a heart she's
[1:20:09] getting into the spirit of the
[1:20:12] composer why brothers and sisters with
[1:20:15] her own confession she said we know our
[1:20:18] fathers told us when Messiah come she
[1:20:21] knew the musical ready amen she was well
[1:20:25] acquainted with God's Symphony she had
[1:20:27] been reading the Symphony of God's word
[1:20:29] and she knew that Messiah will come and
[1:20:32] the son of Messiah will be discernment
[1:20:35] so yes she's confessing and something
[1:20:37] that she's been following all the time
[1:20:39] in other words this woman at the well
[1:20:41] was watching for the drum beat of change
[1:20:44] she was watching for the sign of
[1:20:47] Messiah you love the Lord amen amen
[1:20:51] she's getting into the spirit of the
[1:20:53] composer watching for the drum beat of
[1:20:55] change she had been reading the Musical
[1:20:57] sheet all these years The Prophecy of
[1:21:00] the Messiah that would come and she know
[1:21:03] the sign of
[1:21:04] Messiah because she has read it in the
[1:21:06] music sheet she known about MDC coming
[1:21:10] to Sarah and Abraham having his back
[1:21:12] turned to the tent Discerning a heart
[1:21:15] was God in human flesh she read about
[1:21:18] Solomon Discerning the heart of the
[1:21:20] queen and B said was God in human flesh
[1:21:22] Discerning the heart of Solomon because
[1:21:24] the word is a discerner the word become
[1:21:26] flesh in other words she knew the sign
[1:21:28] of Messiah and she was listening to the
[1:21:31] drum beat of change
[1:21:33] amen he said go call your husband she
[1:21:37] said I am none he said you are rightly
[1:21:40] spoken you had five and the one that you
[1:21:43] you living with is not even your husband
[1:21:46] that was enough for her she caught the
[1:21:49] drum deed of change amen amen something
[1:21:51] triggered Within heart she noticed that
[1:21:54] in God's Symphony there was a change yes
[1:21:57] the Pharisees the S read the same Bible
[1:21:59] that she read and they missed it all
[1:22:02] together but she recognized the word for
[1:22:05] hour look what brother says here God

[1:26:10] day in this hour that we are
[1:26:13] living a Propet to turn around is back
[1:26:16] to the audience and then you would ask
[1:26:18] the question who is this
[1:26:20] m Jesus was in the storm with his
[1:26:23] disciples and they woke up Jesus in the
[1:26:25] storm and he said peace be still and
[1:26:29] they said what man of man is
[1:26:31] this that even the winds obey

[1:26:57] doing the Greater Works today
[1:27:00] amen we are reading the music
[1:27:03] sheet of God's
[1:27:05] word PR 171 I'm going to close up with
[1:27:08] I'm trying to find a place to close up
[1:27:11] but I also don't want to leave out
[1:27:13] something that will bless our
[1:27:18] heart you love the Lord am amen
[1:27:24] okay I'm going to
[1:27:34] skip there's a drama in God's Symphony
[1:27:36] let's just close at this point
[1:27:38] here there's a throne in heaven one sits
[1:27:42] on the throne It's the Most Holy place
[1:27:46] and a voice cries out who is worthy to
[1:27:49] take the music sheet who is worthy to to
[1:27:52] take the symphony who is worthy to open
[1:27:55] the symphony who is worthy to even look
[1:27:57] upon this Sy Symphony and give the
[1:27:59] interpretation of the Symon and no man
[1:28:01] was worthy yes Revelation 5 John begins
[1:28:05] to weep bitterly but the Bible says
[1:28:08] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:28:10] had prevailed amen other words the
[1:28:12] change of dispensation King David the
[1:28:15] lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:28:18] prevailed and he breaks out with a great
[1:28:21] Raw
[1:28:23] he is worthy to open the book He's
[1:28:26] Worthy to lose the
[1:28:28] seals and when John turned and looked he
[1:28:31] saw a lamb the meekness of a lamb the
[1:28:35] same one hiding in Simplicity
[1:28:37] again notice that before the lamb takes
[1:28:40] the book God hides in Simplicity of the
[1:28:44] Lamb then he opens the book The Prophet
[1:28:48] before he preaches a revelation of the
[1:28:50] seals he preaches God hid in
[1:28:53] Simplicity then he takes the book to
[1:28:56] preach the
[1:28:57] seals God hiding in simplicity so
[1:29:00] watching a symphony
[1:29:02] unfold yeah he takes the book and when
[1:29:05] he takes the book in Revelation 5 watch
[1:29:09] they break into
[1:29:11] worship suddenly the symphony is
[1:29:13] changing music is sounding they start to
[1:29:16] worship the four beast and 20 Elders
[1:29:18] they fall down before the lamb with
[1:29:20] sounds of Heart full of VES of ERS
[1:29:23] prayers of the Saints and they sing a
[1:29:25] new
[1:29:26] song when the lamb takes the book The
[1:29:29] simp opens up into a new
[1:29:32] scene there's worship that takes place
[1:29:35] then there's a scene change he leaves
[1:29:38] Heaven's throne and he's coming down to
[1:29:40] earth with the
[1:29:42] symphony Revelation chapter 8 the
[1:29:45] silence in the
[1:29:47] symphony a rest in the symphony an
[1:29:50] interval in the symphony
[1:29:52] the seven seal is open angels are
[1:29:55] worshiping God and whatever God is this
[1:29:58] worship but yet the prophet in the Bible
[1:30:01] says that In Heaven There was silence
[1:30:03] for the space of half an hour means
[1:30:05] Angels stopped
[1:30:08] worshiping what happen what's happening
[1:30:10] in the symphony whatever God is there
[1:30:13] worship but if Heaven is silent then
[1:30:15] God's not in heaven then God's left
[1:30:18] Heaven means he's coming down to earth
[1:30:20] and that's why when he comes down to
[1:30:22] earth there's noise on Earth again but
[1:30:24] Heaven is silent the says the Seven
[1:30:27] Seals the coming of the Lord in Souls
[1:30:29] that I Souls that are in prison now
[1:30:33] 63110 paragraph 347 say but remember all
[1:30:36] this time Noah was in the ark the bride
[1:30:39] is sealed in with Christ the last member
[1:30:42] has been redeemed the sick seal has
[1:30:44] produced his the seven seal brings him
[1:30:47] back to Earth the lamb come and took the
[1:30:49] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:30:51] said set down and claim what he own what
[1:30:54] he redeemed that's right it's always
[1:30:56] been that third pull three is perfection
[1:30:58] the ministry comes to his Perfection
[1:31:00] when it reproduced Christ again in the
[1:31:02] natural among human beings as predicted
[1:31:04] as it was in the days of
[1:31:08] L Pro say seven seal brings him back to
[1:31:11] earth when John takes that when the lamb
[1:31:14] takes that book remember there's silence
[1:31:17] in heaven for space half an hour he's
[1:31:19] left heaven but he's coming down to
[1:31:21] earth
[1:31:22] I want to drop something here you got
[1:31:24] think it's important to
[1:31:26] say and I want to lose the opportunity
[1:31:29] to say this
[1:31:30] here the reason for the silence in
[1:31:34] heaven because Heaven's Stone was empty
[1:31:37] if you read Revelation chapter 8 it says
[1:31:39] there was an angel with the golden
[1:31:41] sensor with much incense in his
[1:31:44] hands and what they do with the incense
[1:31:46] is they take the incense and they go
[1:31:48] into the most holy
[1:31:50] place and the and and it say when the
[1:31:52] high priest goes into the most holy
[1:31:54] place with the incense that the smoke of
[1:31:56] the incense creates a cloud and the
[1:31:59] cloud stands before the mercy seat and
[1:32:01] the priest himself and so you go with
[1:32:04] the incense and you go into the most
[1:32:05] holy place and a cloud has to appear in
[1:32:08] the most holy place and yet in
[1:32:10] Revelation chapter 8 it says the angel
[1:32:11] had the incense in his hands but he did
[1:32:15] not know what to do with the incense
[1:32:17] because there was silence in heaven and
[1:32:19] God was not there anymore the most holy
[1:32:22] place was not in heaven but the most
[1:32:24] holy Place had
[1:32:26] changed yes in Revelation 8 you find the
[1:32:29] Angel takes the incense and he throws it
[1:32:31] on
[1:32:32] Earth why does he throw it on Earth if
[1:32:35] it was meant to go in the most holy
[1:32:37] place because the most holy Place had
[1:32:39] changed was no more in heaven but now it
[1:32:42] was on Earth if you can picture way he
[1:32:44] through it I would say it like this year
[1:32:47] sunset Mountain 1963 the incense is
[1:32:50] strong strong and and the cloud appears
[1:32:53] why the most holy places changed from
[1:32:55] Heaven down to
[1:32:57] earth the Bible says Earth shook by an
[1:33:00] earthquake there was Thunders there was
[1:33:02] lightning a cloud forms itself on Mount
[1:33:05] Sunset there's a CH seene change in the
[1:33:09] symphony those who are watching the
[1:33:11] symphony they know that something is
[1:33:13] happening here on Earth
[1:33:14] amen the rest is a musical
[1:33:18] silence a rest in the music sheet
[1:33:22] but there's noise on Earth the scene has
[1:33:25] changed and brother preached a message
[1:33:28] what is the attraction on the
[1:33:30] mountain what is the noise all about
[1:33:34] he's asking a question because there's
[1:33:36] silence in heaven but there's an
[1:33:38] attraction on Earth there's silence in
[1:33:40] heaven but there's a noise on Earth
[1:33:43] those that are listening to it it's just
[1:33:44] a noise but those that are in the rhythm
[1:33:47] of the music sheet they know that this
[1:33:49] noise has a meaning amen and the
[1:33:52] director goes and say what is the noise
[1:33:54] all about it's a fulfillment of
[1:33:56] Revelation 10 verse 1
[1:34:00] to7 Mighty angel coming down with an
[1:34:02] open book there's lightning there's
[1:34:05] earthquake there's Thunders down here on
[1:34:07] Earth something is taking place in God's
[1:34:10] Symphony of his
[1:34:12] word the bride is watching the symphony
