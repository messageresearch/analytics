========================================

can you get it amen wherefore if God so close the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh he of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where with All Shall we be clothe for after all these things do the Gentile seek you see people who don't know God for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things amen amen amen yes but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you amen amen therefore take no thought for tomor for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof amen may the Lord have blessings to the reading of his word you may be SE seated amen praise the lord we find here that our lord Jesus is teaching us about how we can take care of the body you know when we come across things that are affecting our body we can very easily change diets change exercise programs do everything for the body but that is not the real us amen so we C to for the body and if a doctor gives us an alarming report we will do everything we can to follow the advice being given to us but yet within us is a spirit man amen the spirit man is much more important than the flesh man amen because it is from the spirit that we are controlled people don't realize it because we are not taught these things from birth we are not thought that we are a spirit being living in a flesh body and that one day the flesh body will die but the spirit will go to a new body we are not taught those things amen we may come to the knowledge of the truth years later but remember it's got to come with reconditioning because everything in your existence everything you learned was to cater for the five senses yes yes amen now we know that we have seven senses right how many if you know we got seven senses amen the prophet says we got seven senses we got five sens you know your you know what they are see taste feel smell here then we got the six sense Faith amen right and then the prophet says there's also another sense which is opposite of Faith which is fear the sense of fear so you can either choose to operate by faith or by fear so we see that the Lord is telling us you're cing so much for the flesh man but there is no investment in the flesh man there is no reward from investing in the flesh man so Jesus is inviting us and he's telling us come and seek the kingdom of God amen amen it's a gentle invitation into the kingdom and the invitation is telling you that in the Kingdom there's going to be No Lack it's going to open the doors to the and open the windows of Heaven amen amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah but Jesus is a good fisherman because Jesus said I will make you fishes of men am amen amen amen because I want you to know that even as brother brand tells us the Christian Life Is No Bed of Roses so the invitation is come I'm going to take care of you don't worry what you're going to eat drink what you're going to have amen but if we go to Matthew 1112 so with that that kind of an invitation wouldn't anybody want to come everybody will want to come because it's a lovely beautiful invitation amen now let's see what Jesus tells us about the kingdom even further from Matthew 11 and: 12 and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffer with violence so let me ask you Kingdom of the Earth can be seen physical eyes yes Kingdom of Heaven can be seen no because must be seen with spiritual eyes so Jesus is now giving us a glimpse into the spiritual Kingdom and he's telling us you're coming into the kingdom but this Kingdom suffered violence amen and the violent take it by force amen so when you're coming you got to be prepared for war amen I'm going to say what the prophet says again the Christian Life Is No Bed of Roses he says we're not here on a picnic God is looking for soldiers train soldiers rugged soldiers amen amen amen for all the prophets and the laws prophesied un John amen and if you will receive it this is the LI which was for to come he that ad hears let him hear amen so the thought came to me because we find that on the 10th month of the seventh day in 2023 there was an unforeseen t on natural Israel but we know that the natural types are spiritual yes amen amen amen amen what you're seeing going on in the natural is a type of spiritual what's going on if we had to sit back and and observe what is going on in spiritual Israel you will find that people when I'm saying spiritual Israel you know exactly who I'm talking about there is only one true spiritual Israel amen the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ but if we sit back people are relaxed people are comfortable people have intertwined the two lives together the Earthly and the spiritual and sometimes it seems that the Earthly has overshadowed and overpowered the spiritual that people can live defeated lives and continue with just having a knowledge that I'm in the message and I'm safe what happens is there's Philistine Nation that is camping in Israel and has got a stronghold and that from time to time you'll hear through the years they keep launching attacks yeah but is it from another city it's from within the walls of Israel the god-given land amen so there on the 10 month the seventh day you know there was an attack 5,000 Rockets were launched at Jerusalem taking them una ways amen if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound who can prepare for war now if you go and research it this you won't find probably in the mainstream media because you know the mainstream media is controlled by the Jews how many of you know that Wall Street is owned by the Jews amen hallelujah what was happening that led to the violence is that this MOS you know the mosque ala mosque I think it's called which is Temple Mount yes so it was the week of the Passover they call it sukot what I'm trying to show you there were Jews that were arising and was wanting to enter that Temple to offer sacrifice and the Palestinians were not happy because they call it desecration of their mosque and even within the Jewish laws you know that an ordinary person is not allowed to go in the temple there's different courts but this why I'm showing you there's a group of people that are so zealous for true worship that's natural Israel now amen and they want to go and Ed by force so the Israel army had to get involved and in order to stop it they also had to stop the Palestinians from going into the into their MOS to worship so because of the Restriction they call it the desecration of al- AA mosque and that is why they launched the attack that is the actual reason why they launched the attack what was it a people raising up in Israel who wants true worship to be restored now in the in the in the spiritual world is there a group of people restoring back to true worship is there a group raising up amen amen that is tired of just religion amen tired of just going to the Western Wall yes and praying amen he's Desiring Amen to now they want to go into a physical Temple we are saying Lord come into this Temple amen amen amen but we know that they are controlled by politics so then now they got the government involved and the Army involved I am saying that in this kingdom of God we have got to take it by force amen that's right how many times we heard the prophet say the Holy Ghost is a gentleman amen amen but the Holy Ghost is the one that turns up super takes us from natural to Supernatural but he's waiting for an invitation from you and me just waiting for that invitation waiting for us to get rid of all internal strongholds internal unbelief amen so we find here that Gaza was fell to Israelite rule amen and under King David in the 11th century King David was ruling this entire area it was all part of Israel but when when the when you know the the kingdom split between amen split between Israel and Judea Judah right so the northern kingdom and the southern Kingdom that's when Gaza became part of the Northern Kingdom of Israel amen so we find it's a it's a strip of land 41 kilomet and 10 kilm wide so you know it's not a very big piece of land 41 by 10 located in Israel and we find that Gaza was captured in the sixth day war Israel withdrew its troops around 7,000 settlers in 2005 and then you know they kept having peace treaties peace treaties peace treaties in one of these things they then ended it over in 19 between 94 and 99 they transferred security and civilian responsibility for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to the Palestinian in Authority now who is the Palestinians they are Philistines so the Philistines have always plagued Israel and because they never took care of them back then they are still here today yes you remember how God dealt with Saul because he refused to slay utterly slay and destroy the Kings the women the children yes amen now what does Gaza mean Gaza means strong City Gaza means strong City so there's a stronghold in the midst of Israel that now they can't get rid of now the entire world's attention is on Israel and even though there is a support they are also restrained from doing certain things so they cannot utterly slay and destroy the approach has to be measured amen amas means you know amas is the group that is now the militant group what does amas mean violence so they have a stronghold in Israel that's operating with violence yes do you know what they want they really want Jerusalem so in the natural the Kingdom of Israel is suffering violence and the violence wants to take it by force amen amen am but here we are spiritual Israel want to sit and eat peanuts us Lord while the flashing red light of his coming amen I want to make the statement that we are not waiting for the coming of the lord we are in the cycle of the coming of the lord The Rapture already started with the shout when the Lord comes and we are translated that will be the finishing of the Rapture amen that's what Hallelujah am amen for those of you who got unbelief in you have go read the Rapture message the Rapture starts with a shout and he tells us a shout is the message of the hour amen amen hallelujah hallelujah don't think that since Brandon fell asleep that all things are continuing the same no he was the Forerunner yes he had a message to forerun the second coming amen yes Amen in the first coming oh this going to be strong for you now I mentioned some of these things on Sunday Amen in the first coming God fully expressed himself through Jesus Christ in the second coming he's going to express himself through a people amen amen amen so wake up and smell the coffee you are part of the second coming part of the expression of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you Lord amen wonderful thank you thank you Lord Brother Joshua ask yourself ask ourselves this why is brother Brandon making the statement if the people get a true revelation of who they are right we sing and thinking hey who am I'm bright I'm bright I'm Ruth I'm no you are Jesus reproduced amen amen that's right people have fallen asleep Amnesia has taken a hold of them they don't know that this is how the Lord is expressing himself in the second coming yes Lord Amen brother Adrian are you trying to tell me that William Brandon was forerunning a bride amen but go and read Christ's mystery again is going to have a preent a body of people what do you think this is the head do you think he's coming at the Headless uh without a body no no no no we need to reexamine our theology because people are fallen asleep and they haven't really caught the mystery of the second coming amen amen they have a denominational concept of the second coming thinking that one day the sky is going to split open and they're going to see Jesus and Jes Jesus is going to say come home my son and everyone's going to fly that is why they attacked this this was the start of it amen amen than you Lord amen so we find a m means violence so I'll come in the natural the Kingdom of Israel is suffering violence and the violence violent want to take it by force now if somebody is being violent with you how can you stop them both won the kingdom what have you got to return it [Music] with you got to fight for every inch of ground amen amen and you don't have to fear yes amen because the captain of the host Hallelujah yes Lord amen the captain of the host has come down he never left amen am amen he never left yes the captain of the host when you saying host what is he talking what host Angelic host amen hallelujah we got to fight we got to wrestle we War we at War amen hallelujah the more I sit around and the more I think the more agitated I get because I become Restless in my spirit amen that this bride must raise up a powerful Army am amen hallelujah we need to awaken one another we need to encourage one another amen hallelujah so when when we are taking the kingdom of force we need to make a concerted effort to take it by force nobody takes things by force without a strategic Alliance yes that's right without War planning yes without without a plan yes amen even the Lord when he was leading them to take Jericho he had a plan six days you'll March around the city but on the seventh day you'll March seven times amen amen hallelujah amen amen amen six Church ages have gone by but in the seventh Church age amen at the end of that seven Church age comes a prophet to reveal all seven Church ages in the seven Church age we really marched through six times seven times because we had to revise what they have marched around what Ephesus marched around amen you know all the church ages didn't we revise that we've got the book Seven Church ages amen when did we revise that and go around that City seven times in this day yes amen amen so Jericho walls Must Fall Down yes amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we've got to have a strategic Alliance and our alliance is not with flesh and blood amen amen we wrestle not against flesh and blood I tell you the time has come now amen hallelujah when brothers and sisters who are fighting in the backyard need to come into the front yard because the fight is in the front yard far too long we've been fighting in the backyard amen calling for backup amen hallelujah amen yes praise the lord we need to to make a concerted effort Amen to enter the kingdom in spite of the violent opposition amen the opposition comes in many forms in our caral mind because this is the greatest Battle Ground amen you don't even know amen sometimes we become so unawares that we are fighting a daily battle amen we wake up in the morning and we groaning and we moaning and we fasting and we fighting amen battles going on if Satan defeats Us in the mind amen we can't have the victory throughout the day amen we go about murmuring and complaining and and talking stories amen instead of spreading the gospel and the good news of Jesus Christ and taking back and tearing down strongholds amen amen the kind of mind the Bible says is enity with God and then we got last of our own flesh amen forget about the pites and the name this brother Joshua you know them evites parasites parasites but now they also got websites websites strongholds T sites strongholds strongholds the kingdom of God suffer with violence and the violent take it by force amen not many amen's there people don't like him must talk about websites amen hallelujah amen praise

being bundled up am you can say bro I was I got to unbel the sign website your a tear being bundled I don't like rejection how you telling me I the Lord did this to me yes sir yes the Lord bound you

nothing all you can take with you is tears yes amen yes you will never take one true we with you amen so take strength brothers and sisters all the tears are being bundled amen hallelujah now you say the kingdom of God must be taken by force let's see what our lord Jesus teaches us about the kingdom of God further l 17 amen praise the Lord Luke 17 amen Luke 17 chapter 20 you see the tears now they're going to talk to Jesus and when he was demanded of the Pharisees who are these people to make demands when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation yes neither shall they say Lo here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you amen amen thank you Lord now that all adds a whole another dimension to this amen yes because here the Lord is telling us that Cast Away Your Mind from an after death heaven right most people have this concept of after death Heaven that when they die they will go to heaven but Jesus is telling you the kingdom of God is within you amen and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it and they shall say unto you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning for as the lightning that lightened out of one part of under heaven and shine it unto the other part under heaven so shall the also the son of man be in his day have you seen lightning how quick it is sometimes you say you saw the lightning it was so quick the person didn't see they say where he says that's how quick the lightning will come son of man ministry will be here am amen do you know there now most of the generation that was existing in the prophet's day are going down yes you seen in the month of OCT October yeah amen God took the greatest witness of Son of Man Ministry away the greatest eyewitness am amen amen not even it bisc saw the things that bully Paul saw because Ed bisc was not in all the meetings but bully Paul was there working with his father believe Paul saw the angel of the Lord amen amen amen but God took away the greatest eyewitness telling us that something is changing amen and you shall be Witnesses amen amen yes you shall be Witnesses now amen yes you see let me explain what kind of people you are you never saw one physical evidence of the Lord Jesus Christ you yet to believe in him amen you never saw him take the cross you never saw him die you never saw him raise again but you believe in it what is that called Faith now if you can believe believe God like that you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ whom you haven't seen you haven't touched you've nothing You' saw nothing with the physical senses but you're believing by faith amen how much more now can you operate with others aspects you never saw William Brandon amen you never heard him physically but yet you believe it by faith amen this is the caliber of people you are amen amen why you come back from a faith civilization amen amen praise the Lord yes Lord hallelujah thank so the Bible says that we come from God and we go back to God right how where did we come from but watch there a progression we come from the thoughts of God but we can't go back to his thoughts we already expressed when we leave this life we don't become a thought again amen we go back into aor glorified State we go back into a better State amen what is better a thought or the thing manifested so we're coming into the manifested word amen hallelujah this thing is going to Climax and I'm telling you it's climaxing but we need to shake ourselves strong amen don't allow strongholds to exist amen hallelujah so Jesus manifested the power so in the kingdom of God now is not only going to take care of your daily needs the king of God comes with power amen amen amen yes he's telling you that the kingdom of God is suffering violence so he's got to give you a power to counter the violence amen yes amen so Jesus manifested the power of the Kingdom with tangible signs tangible Miracles things that you could see amen they stood there in amazement because people that were born blind Jesus gave them back their sight amen people that couldn't walk from birth Jesus made them walk again what is that operating from the kingdom of God that was within him amen and you as a son and daughter of God can operate the same way if we get rid of strongholds there is something stopping you from operating to your true potential and those things are called strongholds because we don't want to lay down those strongholds amen yes help us that's right and only you and I will know what that stronghold is that's right only you will you and I will know where we are not allowing the Lord in yes amen only you and I yes amen amen so the Lord here I'm showing you now that the kingdom of God comes not with observation but it comes with such tremendous power that people can't help but see the power amen and even though the king om of God cannot be seen with natural eyes the power can be seen with natural eyes because here has a man born blind with naturalized people can see now this man we know him he couldn't see now he can see this man couldn't walk now he can walk this man is laying dead 4 days we are the best funeral service for him amen We buried him we Ed him we put him in this tomb Undertakers have come and gone but this man is called back to life do you know that was one of the final things that the Jews couldn't handle you go read the Bible about Lazarus that they couldn't handle people were being converted because here was a living being a living man was dead 4 days and people were coming into the gospel in the Kingdom that the Pharisees the scribes and everybody they couldn't handle it they said we've got to put him to death they even wanted to kill Lazarus now what what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is the reason I'm telling you that because when you are coming to life now when you are being resurrected from dead denominationalism dead message theology amen forgive me for saying that but when you are being resurrected now people are not going to be happy and they'll want to put you to death they'll want to silence you they want to kill your testimony they want to kill your influence amen but don't be amen don't be overtaken by them amen overcome all these strongholds you've got to overcome these criticisms Amen in order to get into the all of Fame you've got to go through the all of critics but while you're going through the all of critics don't be deterred amen just know that you are Marching according to on with Christian Soldiers you are Marching according to the plan of God you are not sure to please men the father gives the instruction and I carry them out I'm not here to please man I'm here to please my Goden amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah so each time amen that Jesus announced the good news of the Kingdom there was physical manifestation of sins being forgiven sicknesses being healed demons cast out feeding the hungry and death couldn't hold them down when Jesus was in attendance I'm going to say this again amen that when the kingdom of God is preached there is physical signs and wonders yes amen hallelujah amen so we can't present the kingdom of God and not have the same manifestation amen because I want to remind you of the one who was operating in this realm and this Authority was telling you and I that Greater Works than these shall he do amen for I go unto my father amen yes Lord amen now to the outside world it remained a secret how Jesus was operating with this Authority that's why they kept coming to him but to the people that were a part of the kingdom and to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom and to us it's not a mystery because all the Mysteries have been revealed amen all the Mysteries have been revealed under Revelation 10:7 so that we can Now operate in the Kingdom amen amen praise the Lord let's switch amen glory be to his name amen glory to his name yes Lord glory to his name there my heart was the blood applied glory to his name glory to his name glory to his name there to my heart was the blood glory to to his name one more time Glory Singing Glory to his name glory to his [Music] name to my heart was the blood singing glor to his name amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah so to recap what we are talking about is exactly what Paul preached amen even though we are in the days of Jesus and we're showing you how Jesus operated and he was presenting the kingdom but Paul says I not come in word only amen because the gospel preached is the kingdom of God being preached amen amen but the kingdom of God must come with power and demonstration amen yes if the kingdom of if the kingdom is being preached without power and demonstration then it's being preached from an intellectual standpoint the kingdom of God cannot be preached with mechanics only amen amen hallelujah are you saying we have turned the corner yes yes amen are you saying you're not satisfied with the mechanics no are you saying we need both mechanics and Dynamics yes amen thank you Lord amen so you're saying I can't be a casual observer in the message of the hour no you mean the time of gathering information and and understanding all the Mysteries are over yes how long you want to be schooled yes amen you know what a test is a test is to check what you have learned and to move you to the next level to promote you to the next grade amen amen so people amen they get excited about the Revelation but the Revelation comes to give you a faith yes any Revelation must come to give you Faith yes amen amen because faith is a revelation right so here we find in in I I ended with this thought there while when the lights went off that the people outside can't understand the mystery of how you can operate in your sunship Authority and then when you speak yes amen amen yes amen the mountain can move amen but when they speak nothing happens amen so to the Insiders it's not a mystery but to the outside it's a secret amen because didn't he say that the third pool won't be a public show yes amen this ministry of the Bride won't be for the public yes amen so Romans 47 Romans 14:17 says the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit in the Holy Ghost amen amen because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives of the Lords amen amen he's getting the Lord's favor what is needed Holy Spirit amen you you talk about this Holy Spirit that's so demanding you talk about the holy spirit that that just changes everything about me the holy you can't be the same way with the holy spirit amen if you invite the Holy Spirit into your life expect your life to be transform Amen to totally change yes amen you're going to you can't help because the holy spirit is love you can't help but love everybody yes you can't help but forgive everybody amen no matter how much they trample you the Holy Spirit kills the old nature gives you a new birth now he says the prophet says if you want to know if somebody's Dead with all nature what you got to do what you want to do tram their toes yes that's what he said right tram their toes and see how they react because he says that dead man how many of you went to the coffin and pinched the dead man then does he react no dead so the old nature must totally die please he I don't want to be attacked outside there amen praise the Lord whole man must completely die now you see there's there's many strongholds in our life it's not only that not only forgiveness and love but there's other things strongholds of bitterness that I say with my mouth that I love this person I say with my mouth that I forgive this person but there's that inside there there's still that feeling something is wrong something is wrong Holy Spirit now wants to go there and cleanse that Holy Spirit wants your time amen Holy Spirit wants your attention Holy Spirit wants you to make you operate like Jesus Christ amen I do nothing but what the father shows me amen so the kingdom of God is within you and is the holy spirit because the kingdom of God the Holy Spirit Will govern you and if you maybe you're wondering hey how do I behave you know if you go into a king's Palace what what is the protocol how do I behave how do I conduct myself in the king's Palace amen you don't have to worry about all that get the Holy Spirit amen amen and you don't have to guess whether you got the Holy Spirit anybody who's at a new birth anybody who's preparing to give birth will know about it amen amen there must be a time and an experience that you can relate to and point to amen yes this was the day I died and I was born again amen people say I've been born again I'm born again you know that's a loose word in the Christian world I'm a born again Christian born again Christian born again Christian but they're smoking born again Christian but they swearing yes born again Christian but they womanizing born again Christian but they committing adultery born again Christian but they fornicating they are lying they are misrepresenting the kingdom amen but the kingdom of God is suffering violence amen there's an there spiritual assault but you say I can't see it it's because that's how they are the spirits these demonic spirits you are saying he you guys are talking about I know in the Book of Revelation there it's telling us about 200 million demons where are they they are influencing you and affecting you every day of your life coming now amen through media social media coming amen through your friends coming in amen trying to deceive you deceive you deceive you get you lukewarm get you not interested in the things of God yes amen hallelujah get you lukewarm get you satisfied that's amen you say but I don't I don't see them working get you distracted day one without the Bible day two yeah he came with cility in the garden amen so the wway is going on we started the year with consecration amen I wonder how many have slipped away from that with the prayer life with the reading the Bible with reading the message of the hour feeding yourself on those things amen hallelujah because for me and for you if you have to sit back and listen if you have to sit back and look around and look at the framework of our faith something is wrong something is wrong and it needs to change and it needs to change with me this is where it starts amen amen This Is Where It Starts because we are wise in our own eyes yes right amen we are full of wisdom in our own eyes we feel like we got Angels wings but we need to start here yes amen amen praise the Lord when we sing We Are the continuation of the book of Acts start with me amen yes Lord because that's how change comes upon about it starts with individuals yes it starts with individuals who lose all Pride who lose all selfishness amen because eternal life is living for others amen amen praise the Lord amen then we know that the Apostle Paul is telling us that you need to do good to the household of faith first amen you need to good do good to the household of faith first amen so we need to take care of the church first because he says seek the kingdom of God and he's telling you the kingdom of God is within you so if you want to take care of the kingdom of God who must you take care of your brothers and sisters amen seek the kingdom of God do good to the household of faith yes amen hallelujah amen amen amen so we need to be obedient to his commands and follow follow his will for our lives amen so we know that God to reiterate how we started God is our provider yes God provides our basic necessities living in the Kingdom means trusting God that he will provide being thankful when he does provide and being satisfied with those Provisions amen amen now we know also that in this Kingdom it has keys yeah amen we know that the the Lord Jesus laid it out and he defined that the kingdom has keys and so Keys you know that open up amen you see the kingdom of God is not open for everybody you need keys to the kingdom amen amen there are certain doors that need to be unlocked certain Gates that need to be unlocked yes and when you are taking the kingdom you've got to have those keys am Upon This Rock I will build my church amen and I give to you the keys to the kingdom of heaven yes now that key is only given to a special class of people amen that Revelation to unlock the kingdom yes that Revelation to unlock the mystery of God that revelation Amen to understand all the mysteries of the Kingdom amen praise the Lord thank you Lord the mystery you got keys to unlock the communion amen nobody else has keys to unlock the communion who gave us the key to unlock communion amen is it part of the kingdom yes we know how to take the communion we know what's to be used in the commun communion when keys to unlock foot washing keys to unlock the mystery of God keys to unlock acts 238 amen the kingdom has keys anybody can read this but it's locked you need keys amen yes amen flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven amen amen so the Lord has given us keys and I'm afraid that we have taken these keys for granted we are not realizing that these are the keys that amen is the weapons given to us to overcome the strongholds so we need to use the word of God to overcome strongholds amen hallelujah so we've got to open up the kingdom of God to Believers and close it to unbelievers so if the Keys of the Kingdom are given to you you can lock and unlock didn't the Bible say don't cast your pears among swines what does it mean lock the kingdom amen when he says you go into a city and they won't hear you tou your feet and move on what are you doing locking the door amen what you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven what you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven you see nothing that we do you and I who are born again Sons and Daughters of God is without meaning every action every word we speak is recorded in heaven the power of our word this is how we operating right now by the power of the spoken word amen amen so that is is why we got to be so careful in this time in this season the words we speak amen amen people coming against us amen the words we speak they don't realize amen that they can call you a balded man go goad go on baled man and you have power to call she Bears amen praise the Lord let's try and bring this to a close now so the key Kingdom has keys amen that key is revelation you can lock and unlock don't be don't be disturbed when people don't want to hear you lock the door and move yes amen they're shutting out their own salvation one day they can't come to you how come you never open this door to me brother that day I was opening this door you told me take your keys and move you were satisfied with your Apostle your denomination and your teaching that's right amen you were seeking blessings natural blessings amen you were seeking just wealth that's all people want is wealth amen praise the Lord amen the modern day Christian Church is nothing but a gimmick that preaches Prosperity amen so we find here what does it mean to be violent in spirit the kingdom of God suffer with violence and the violent take it by force amen so you need to be spiritually violent you can't play with the devil that's right amen the Bible says that this guy is an adversity he's not an adversity to be played with yes you think this guy is some Mickey Mouse he rebelled against the god of Heaven he deceived Adam and Eve he deceived the entire world so don't go playing in his grounds he's come now to play in your territory he's come now to create a stronghold within you amen you know that the prophet says that unforgiveness bitterness and all of these things can lead to sickness amen so what is that creating a strong within you so we got to watch these things here in Psalm 144:1 it says blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth My Hands to War blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers to fight amen amen we need some Amasia spiritual amas amen God is not opposed to spiritual violence if the heart and intent is Right amen but we must be familiar with the law and you know generally in the police force what they tell you brother Joshua most of the time they can't use deadly force but in this Kingdom it's a requirement for you to use deadly force amen you can't go and attack Satan's kingdom with pet guns you can't put electric bed wires or bed wires and electric fencing Satan don't get shocked don't get scared of small shocks you need Atomic Warfare amen what's Atomic Warfare that's say the Lord who has thus sa the Lord in this hour the bride has th Sayed the Lord she has the mind of Christ she knows what he wants done with the word amen so we know that God can use natural force in the Bible to make people do things like he use natural force of the flood to take eight people into the ark and one man in a Rapture amen so God can use floods he can use earthquakes he can use a swarm of locust to let God's people go free yes he amen you can use natural force amen the laws of nature to cause Egypt and the Army pharaoh and the Army to let God's people go so God can use natural force and he can use it as a sign of punishment like he did they in Noah's day amen but there's also spiritual forces that God is using how many of you know what that is how many of you know who are God's spiritual forces right now yes because Earth is the Angel's domain unto the Angels God said you shall have dominion over the Earth God said I will have dominion over the Earth what did God say man shall have dominion over the Earth can God go against his own law that is why there's a fight for man because the Earth belongs to man so demon powers want to influence man so they can operate through man demon powers don't have jurisdiction over the Earth they've got to operate through men same way the Angelic forces God is on the earth holy spirit is on the earth amen Earth belongs to man so he wants to possess man so the war is hot and heavy amen this is not the time to be sleeping amen this is not the time to be amen amen creating strongholds in our hearts so what are what is the Bible saying are strongholds the Bible uses this term strongholds because they are armful thoughts and patterns arrogant attitudes amen hallelujah unforgiveness bitterness strongholds amen these beliefs amen lead to something and it it creates something in the spiritual realm it leads to demonic influence don't think all you know what bitterness is it's a demonic attack on you right right unforgiveness is a demonic attack on you you know when you get angry that's a demonic attack because you allowing that person to have power over you and you are angry with that person so which means that person has a stronghold over you amen amen amen we got to break these things and here in 2 Corinthians 10:4 and 5 I'm going to read this version it says the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal it's not weapons of the world but we have divine power to demolish strongholds amen but they are Mighty to the pulling down of strongholds the Bible says so we demolish arguments and every I think that exalts itself against the knowledge against the revelation of God and we take captive every thought and make it obedient to Christ amen you mean if I change my thinking I can change my faith my belief yes greatest Battleground the mind you mean if I change my thought my thinking pattern and align it to the word of God yes because it must drop down from here to here once it drops down to the heart it takes root and now God has a stronghold God has Dominion amen so we're demolishing things amen hallelujah amen how do you break stronghold once you recognize this you may be saying okay I recognize the stronghold within me I have this thing I need it to get out of me you got to stop now and bring it to repentance amen amen you got to be honest before God amen amen yes amen you got to Humble ourselves and let the spirit expose it yes and say Lord I don't care you know that's why in the back in the day there was true repentance in the church people are not ashamed the only thing they wanted to get right with God the prophet says I hated dryed confession he said when people you know the word of God is sharp it's powerful it can penetrate the heart that even now while the word of God you can't be bothered about the next person sitting there the only thing that matters is that we must get right with God Amen so that that amen eliminates everybody else it's just me and God if I need to cry out to him Lord help me I'm crying out to you Lord Jesus I'm reaching out to you amen so we got to come to a true repentance be honest before God Amen and let the Holy Spirit expose that stronghold of Darkness amen yes Lord hallelujah say Try Me Oh Lord test me oh Lord examine my heart examine my mind holy spirit show me that area of stronghold in my life yes and repent yes people have emotional strongholds amen people have you know they have doubt they have uh the Spirit of Rejection they feel like everybody's against them they there's a spirit of poverty all these things are strongholds Spirit of low self-esteem strongholds Spirit of Pride Spirit of stubbornness what are all of these things doing giving you complexes what are them strongholds amen amen oh my skin is like this strongholds I look ugly

I'm a daughter of God I've have been fearfully and wonderfully made amen they call you ugly you tell them I'm fearfully and wonderfully made hallelujah amen thank you Lord praise the Lord amen amen you can change your situation by your confession amen amen hallelujah amen Psalms 18 says I love you oh my Lord my strength the Lord is my rock my Fortress my deliverer my God Is My Rock in whom I take refuge he is my shield and the or of my salvation my stronghold Ephesians 611 says put on the armor of God that you may be able to stand firm against the tactics of the devil Hallelujah for our
