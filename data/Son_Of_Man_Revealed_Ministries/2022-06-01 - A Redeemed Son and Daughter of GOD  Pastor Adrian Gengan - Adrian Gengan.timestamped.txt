[6:37] that we should be called the sons of god
[6:40] therefore the world
[6:41] knoweth us not
[6:43] because it knew him not
[6:46] beloved now are we the sons of god and

[8:24] god amen that are called in this end
[8:26] time
[8:28] the only thing we live by in this time
[8:30] is to live in that realm of revelation
[8:33] without revelation we perish
[8:36] without revelation without the opening
[8:38] of the word we would just be another
[8:40] church another denomination
[8:43] but we live in this realm of revelation
[8:45] amen amen hallelujah heavenly places is
[8:49] the believer's position in christ
[8:52] amen we live in this elevated position
[8:56] and this elevated position has been
[8:58] given to us to make it through this life
[9:02] god knew that we couldn't make it
[9:04] through this life in our five senses
[9:06] so he gave us that sixth sense
[9:09] this man was living just with five
[9:11] senses alone and there's no hope in that
[9:14] amen is pursuing things to make the body
[9:18] happy
[9:19] but there is no happiness in just
[9:21] pursuing the five senses
[9:24] but faith
[9:26] that sixth sense
[9:27] amen raises up raises us up into that
[9:31] dimension of faith into that elevated
[9:34] position to help us to make it through
[9:37] this journey in life
[9:38] why we are living in satan's heathen
[9:42] amen a time when there's chaos upon the
[9:44] earth
[9:46] it's satan's hidden and they have gone
[9:48] completely insane the god of this world
[9:51] is being worshipped
[9:54] amen they do not know but they are
[9:56] worshiping this god of this evil age
[9:59] because he has come through deception he
[10:01] has come through religion
[10:03] he has swept even through the church
[10:07] and he is being worshipped as god
[10:09] amen hallelujah and if we are not in
[10:12] this elevated position
[10:14] of a man of revelation in this elevated
[10:18] position of our position and our
[10:21] authority we are going to be struggling
[10:24] in this world to live
[10:27] every day is going to be a struggle to
[10:29] live with all the pressures of life
[10:32] amen and we are going to buckle under
[10:34] that pressure
[10:39] amen if we didn't live in this world we
[10:41] would be stressed
[10:45] you say i'm stressed no you're not
[10:50] a believer is the most stress-free
[10:53] person
[10:55] because he has a hope he has faith in a
[10:58] god amen and not just in a god but in
[11:02] the living god amen amen a god who's
[11:05] proved himself alive so we are not
[11:08] stressed with what's happening we are
[11:10] not worried about what's happening but
[11:12] we know amen how we are going to make it
[11:15] amen we know how we're going to make it
[11:17] from one day to the next
[11:19] and that's through the believer's eye
[11:21] because we know who's going to meet us
[11:23] in tomorrow
[11:25] amen while there's uncertainty all
[11:27] around us we know that the lord is there
[11:30] because
[11:31] imam eternity moves through time
[11:36] amen eternity is not governed by time
[11:41] eternity has no beginning it has no end
[11:44] and god lives in eternity amen
[11:47] hallelujah so we cast all our cares on
[11:50] jesus if we are troubled about anything
[11:53] we committed to the lord and we take it
[11:55] to the lord in prayer amen
[11:58] amen hallelujah we leave our human
[12:00] thinking fears at the altar
[12:03] we leave broken hearts at the altar we
[12:06] leave fear at the altar
[12:09] the thing that's crippling our faith is
[12:11] fear
[12:12] fear of the unknown fear of uncertainty
[12:17] amen
[12:18] but what we got to do is rise up in
[12:20] faith and leave our insecurities at the
[12:24] altar and say lord i'm trusting you to
[12:27] see me through
[12:28] amen i don't want to go through life
[12:30] with my own ability
[12:32] not if you want to go through life with
[12:34] your own human ability
[12:36] amen but i'm trusting in the lord to
[12:38] lead me and guide me every step of the
[12:41] way
[12:43] amen being redeemed is not just a slogan
[12:46] but our lives testify that we are
[12:49] redeemed
[12:51] the amen
[12:51] son and daughter of god has a specific
[12:54] lifestyle amen amen hallelujah we are
[12:58] not conformed to the lifestyle of this
[13:00] world but we are transformed by the
[13:02] renewing of our mind to live according
[13:05] to a heavenly lifestyle and that
[13:07] lifestyle is the lifestyle of christ
[13:10] till christ performed in me
[13:13] amen hallelujah this lifestyle also
[13:16] displays the authority that daddy gave
[13:19] to me
[13:21] a man dominion authority
[13:25] the lifestyle displays the authority
[13:28] that a redeemed person possesses
[13:32] hallelujah what when we were failing the
[13:34] flesh god had come to give us a
[13:36] superpower
[13:38] and that superpower is the holy ghost
[13:41] hallelujah that changes this man amen
[13:46] hallelujah oh bless the name of jesus a
[13:50] redeemed man the daughter of god
[13:53] possesses qualities about them sonship
[13:56] authority
[13:58] dominion authority that circumstances
[14:01] around you has to obey you
[14:05] hallelujah
[14:06] and if there are people or things in
[14:08] this life that is pulling us away from
[14:11] operating in this level of authority we
[14:13] must reject it yes
[14:17] we should not accept it
[14:19] we must resist it we must reject it if
[14:22] it's trying to push down from our
[14:24] position
[14:26] amen hallelujah and you don't hold the
[14:29] devil an explanation for nothing yes
[14:32] amen
[14:33] we don't owe the devil an explanation
[14:35] for anything it's not his business why
[14:38] our women don't cut their hair
[14:41] it's not his business why our women
[14:43] don't wear pants
[14:45] and the men don't wear shorts amen they
[14:47] accuse the men of being dominating men
[14:50] and the women are stuck in bondage but
[14:52] what is really happening is that they
[14:55] are being bound when they look at you
[14:57] they are being condemned amen by the
[14:59] lies that they are living and to ease
[15:02] their conscience they are accusing you
[15:04] of being a dominating husband
[15:08] but it's not satan's business to know
[15:10] why we don't drink why we don't smoke
[15:13] why we don't gamble
[15:15] it's not his business why we don't watch
[15:17] television and entertain ourselves like
[15:20] the people of the world
[15:23] amen
[15:24] you say what satan is talking to me he's
[15:26] talking to you through people
[15:29] why must you be this way amen it's not
[15:32] his business amen if we are holy and
[15:35] undefiled and sometimes these devils
[15:38] come and say why don't you chill
[15:42] why not get so holy why don't you chill
[15:45] and just enjoy life
[15:48] amen but we don't like to chill we like
[15:50] to be on fire for god amen i'd rather be
[15:54] on fire for god than to end up in the
[15:56] flames of hell amen and the lake of fire
[16:00] but one day when he and his demon powers
[16:03] are bound in hell you can ask him why
[16:06] don't you chill
[16:09] there'll be no chill in hell
[16:16] we are not answerable to the devil
[16:19] if you feel you you need to answer him
[16:22] here's the answer we must give him get
[16:24] thee behind me satan amen
[16:28] amen the devil came to jesus at one time
[16:31] and said if you bow down and worship me
[16:34] i will give you all these things
[16:37] but jesus said unto him get thee behind
[16:40] me satan
[16:41] and then he says it is written it is
[16:44] written
[16:46] amen satan don't want you to recognize
[16:49] your position in the word
[16:51] he doesn't want you to know what the
[16:53] scripture says about you
[16:55] and all that has been prophesied about
[16:57] you
[16:58] amen satan certainly knows the bible and
[17:01] he knows his prophecy that he's gonna
[17:03] where he's gonna end up
[17:05] and he knows where you are in the bible
[17:08] but he's trying to keep you away from
[17:09] your position
[17:12] amen
[17:13] [Music]
[17:14] in romans chapter eight it says submit
[17:17] yourselves unto god resist the devil and
[17:20] he will flee from you amen amen
[17:24] hallelujah you know there's nothing that
[17:26] satan can offer us that will satisfy us
[17:30] money no women no popularity no we don't
[17:34] cater to the flesh because we walk not
[17:37] after the flesh but after the spirit
[17:40] and that's why there is no condemnation
[17:42] to you who are in christ jesus
[17:46] hallelujah
[17:47] amen 1 john 5 19 says we know that we
[17:51] are of god and that the whole world lies
[17:54] in the power of the evil one
[17:59] look at what john is saying
[18:00] the condition of the world is controlled
[18:03] by the devil
[18:04] but we are of god we are redeemed sons
[18:08] and daughters of god
[18:10] amen
[18:12] we were once the devil's property
[18:14] sitting in the pawn shop
[18:17] but we have been born with a price
[18:20] in fact satan has much preference to
[18:23] redeem you
[18:27] amen there was an era kinsman
[18:30] because of the flesh
[18:33] [Music]
[18:34] hallelujah
[18:35] but he knew that he did not have
[18:37] anything within himself to redeem you
[18:41] his blood couldn't redeem you
[18:44] amen
[18:45] hallelujah then you're a kinsmen
[18:48] four foot in fulfill feeding his claim
[18:52] and he took off his sandal and he had to
[18:54] beat it to say i'm forfeiting my claim
[19:00] hallelujah
[19:01] but then boaz came forth
[19:04] and he said i will pay the price for
[19:06] their redemption
[19:09] amen
[19:11] we were sitting in the pawn shop but now
[19:14] we've been bought for the price amen
[19:16] jesus paid it off
[19:24] amen he took me out of the devil's pawn
[19:27] shop
[19:29] amen hallelujah
[19:32] hallelujah oh hallelujah do you know
[19:34] your breakthrough is on a different
[19:36] decibel than where you are right now
[19:39] amen
[19:41] there must be shouts of joy and victory
[19:44] resound in the tense of the righteous of
[19:47] the lord
[19:50] amen one john three and eight says for
[19:54] this purpose the son of god was
[19:56] manifested
[19:57] to destroy the works of the devil
[20:02] the son of god was manifested to destroy
[20:05] the works of the devil not going to
[20:08] destroy he was manifested and the
[20:10] devil's work is already destroyed but
[20:13] he's trying to deceive you that he still
[20:16] has a word
[20:18] but he's a defeated enemy
[20:20] thank you amen when we were redeemed by
[20:23] the blood of the lamb we were born again
[20:26] and we are now answerable to god amen
[20:30] amen it's amazing how people find it to
[20:34] more responsibility to be answerable to
[20:37] a human being than to god
[20:42] the things we place before us
[20:45] if you belong to a club you would tell
[20:47] them hey i'm not coming in today if you
[20:49] belong go go belong to a work
[20:52] environment you would inform them hey
[20:54] i'm not coming today
[20:56] and you know what
[20:57] the truth of the matter is if you had a
[20:59] calendar and you were to mark down the
[21:01] days you went to work
[21:04] and there's 365 days in a year
[21:07] you might have went to work 360 days
[21:11] but if you mark down how many times you
[21:13] came to church
[21:15] maybe you came 300 days
[21:17] maybe 200
[21:18] maybe 100
[21:20] maybe 50
[21:22] maybe two
[21:23] christmas and easter
[21:28] but people find it that they they find
[21:31] that they need to be more answerable to
[21:32] man
[21:34] they find this this need to to conform
[21:37] to a certain environment but when it
[21:40] comes to the think of god things of god
[21:43] they feel they are not arguable
[21:46] one day
[21:48] we will answer
[21:50] amen
[21:54] soon
[21:55] god is coming
[21:57] for the second part of redemption
[22:00] god is not finished with redemption amen
[22:03] the first part is to pay the price for
[22:05] our redemption the second part is coming
[22:08] to claim to redeem
[22:11] amen he's coming to claim his purchase
[22:14] position and when he's coming to claim
[22:17] that which he has redeemed only he will
[22:20] know that you are redeemed possession
[22:22] how will he know
[22:24] how will he know that you are a redeemed
[22:26] son and daughter of god
[22:28] that's what we are speaking about the
[22:30] redeemed son and daughter of god he's
[22:32] going to look for the token he's going
[22:34] to look for the evidence he's going to
[22:36] look for the seal
[22:39] amen
[22:40] hallelujah
[22:42] he's gonna know you are redeemed because
[22:43] of the holy ghost seal that is upon you
[22:46] because when you were redeemed with the
[22:48] blood you had to be born again and
[22:50] filled with the holy ghost now's not the
[22:53] time to play church now the time to be
[22:55] on the move for god amen hallelujah in a
[22:59] relay they keep the strongest runners
[23:02] for the last amen
[23:04] hallelujah amen
[23:06] and now if you know we are right at the
[23:08] end time
[23:09] and you are here at the end time
[23:12] and god entertains you to be at the end
[23:14] time if you are feeling weak i want you
[23:16] to know this evening you are the
[23:18] strongest finisher
[23:20] that's why god and purpose you to be
[23:22] here hallelujah amen god had confidence
[23:25] in you to say my son my daughter will
[23:28] run in the midst of that legacy and
[23:30] spirit amen will not be influenced by
[23:33] these demon powers
[23:35] hallelujah thank you
[23:38] many many man hallelujah we can't treat
[23:41] one service different from the next

[23:46] gotta give our own
[23:50] amen amen hallelujah praise be to the
[23:55] lord almighty amen the holy spirit is a
[23:58] seal it's the token amen is the
[24:01] inheritance that god has given us to
[24:03] operate as a redeemed son and daughter
[24:06] of god and when he comes back he must
[24:08] see that token on display amen
[24:13] and what kind of display is he looking
[24:14] for
[24:16] what kind of display is the lord looking
[24:18] for
[24:19] a man
[24:21] he's looking for one in his image and
[24:23] likeness
[24:25] amen hallelujah

[24:58] if we take up serpents the bible says if
[25:00] we drink any deadly thing it shall not
[25:03] hurt us
[25:04] [Music]
[25:05] amen and you know what
[25:08] believing children
[25:10] lay hands upon the sick
[25:12] and they recover
[25:14] a redeemed son of god
[25:16] filled with the holy ghost
[25:18] that's the caliber of believer who is

[27:35] before we change dwelling places we are
[27:37] going to change bodies
[27:40] because these bodies cannot dwell in
[27:42] that new dwelling place so we must
[27:45] change bodies

[28:24] of the unbelievers so they cannot see
[28:26] the light of the gospel
[28:29] of the glory of christ who is the image
[28:32] of god
[28:38] in one corinthians 13 12 he says now we
[28:41] see through a timely reflection
[28:44] as in a mirror
[28:47] he says we're looking at this mirror but
[28:49] it's like a german reflection
[28:51] maybe the glass is dirty portraits we
[28:53] see through a glass exactly
[28:57] but it says then we shall see face to
[29:00] face
[29:01] now i know in part then i shall know
[29:04] fully even as
[29:06] fully
[29:10] not
[29:13] he predestinated to be conformed to the
[29:16] image of his son
[29:20] so that he would be the first born among
[29:23] many brothers
[29:26] jesus wants brothers

[30:14] liberty amen i can tell you the spirit
[30:16] of the lord is here now because there's
[30:18] liberty in the house amen
[30:20] it's not a stifled praise but it's
[30:23] praise the lord
[30:26] hallelujah
[30:28] then he goes on to say but we all
[30:31] with open face beholding as in a glass
[30:35] the glory of the lord

[31:14] is what you are being changed into
[31:17] from glory to glory even as by the
[31:21] spirit of the lord

[31:28] coming to his image you want to come
[31:30] into his likeness you want to be a
[31:33] redeemed son and daughter of god
[31:36] you want to walk in your sonship
[31:37] authority

[31:41] the training ground is his word
[31:49] the five senses the fire the five senses
[31:52] of this man cannot cope with this word
[31:55] it's in conflict with the spirit man
[31:58] you gotta fight and overcome every day
[32:01] amen the spirit man needs to be
[32:02] strengthened strengthen how you say
[32:05] through prayer
[32:06] to reading the word through praising the
[32:09] lord through worshiping the lord

[32:18] blow the trumpet
[32:20] sound
[32:21] on my holy mountain say the lord
[32:28] don't wake up
[32:30] in the morning and the first words you
[32:32] utter
[32:33] is a ground
[32:35] and a complaint
[32:37] but when you wake up when your eyes open
[32:41] praise the lord amen glory be to your
[32:44] name
[32:45] let your voice resound in heaven
[32:47] [Music]

[32:56] you know that
[32:57] to to muster anything in this life we
[32:59] must spend hours and hours
[33:02] days months years practicing and
[33:06] mastering the out of it
[33:09] until we become so skilled and so good
[33:11] you become one with the thing that you
[33:14] are studying
[33:15] that you are mastering
[33:18] a soccer player becomes one with the
[33:20] ball
[33:24] a man playing cricket that becomes an
[33:27] extension of himself
[33:30] he's not second guessing or i'll just
[33:31] swing this thing

[33:39] you become one within
[33:42] a master
[33:44] marksman
[33:46] the one that shoots
[33:48] he becomes one with a gun
[33:51] you become one with anything that you
[33:53] put before you
[33:54] that's what the apostle paul is trying
[33:56] to convey
[33:58] what are we beholding day to day
[34:00] if we are not beholding his glory
[34:03] then you are beholding another image
[34:07] and you are being changed into what you
[34:09] behold
[34:12] amen
[34:15] how many of you know
[34:17] that god is a
[34:18] bodybuilder you know a bodybuilder he
[34:22] practices for hours and hours and hours
[34:26] not practice he trains

[34:32] he's been building up his body
[34:36] some didn't catch him

[34:40] and you'll catch it
[34:42] [Music]
[34:43] amen
[34:44] he's been building the body up
[34:46] building the body and you know what
[34:49] he's not like one of these bodybuilders
[34:51] who's big on top
[34:52] and i speak like chicken
[34:56] in fact god's base
[34:57] is big
[34:59] faith

[35:02] [Music]
[35:04] amen hallelujah
[35:07] so you must become one with what you are
[35:10] studying or practicing if
[35:12] you want to be considered the master of
[35:14] it the leader of it
[35:17] [Music]
[35:19] amen
[35:20] now what happens when somebody is
[35:22] training to be good at something
[35:24] the first time they fail you think they
[35:26] quit
[35:29] sportsmen are good examples of this
[35:32] they have such a strong mindset they
[35:34] don't quit
[35:37] amen
[35:40] they don't quit but through blood
[35:42] sweat and tears they mastered that sport
[35:45] that art that music they become the best
[35:48] academic
[35:50] if somebody's good iman is studying
[35:54] imam maybe their great academic become
[35:56] doctors professors they got phds and
[36:00] doctors they become an expert in their
[36:02] field they do this how through hard work
[36:05] and perseverance
[36:09] but we don't want to spend time in the
[36:11] things of god
[36:13] the things of god are not interesting to
[36:15] us
[36:17] we feel one service a week is good
[36:19] enough
[36:21] two servers a week is good enough
[36:24] the rest of the week we go on a wall
[36:28] god can't find us
[36:32] amen so how are we going to be changed
[36:35] into that image
[36:36] the son of places an image before him
[36:39] and he tries to impersonate that image
[36:41] he's idol his celebrity he anoints
[36:44] himself with that spirit until he
[36:46] becomes so consumed by it that he lives
[36:49] out what he is beholding
[36:52] but we are beholding the glory of the
[36:54] lord and we are being changed into the
[36:56] same image that we are beholding
[37:01] when we fail in the flesh we don't quit
[37:03] amen sons and daughters of god are not
[37:06] quitters yes amen we continue to behold
[37:09] his glory

[37:14] give up amen we don't throw in the towel
[37:18] amen hallelujah we pray and when we
[37:21] don't get an answer we are not
[37:23] disappointed but we continue to behold
[37:26] his glory
[37:29] we read the word and if there's
[37:31] something we don't understand we don't
[37:33] stop studying but we rely on the holy
[37:36] spirit to teach us and to give us an
[37:39] understanding of the world amen

[38:53] spirit to slay the giant amen we
[38:56] specialize in cutting off heads

[40:31] that many people subscribe to
[40:34] and they have this area of influence
[40:36] people
[40:38] want to be like them
[40:40] amen
[40:42] but look at what satan is doing when he
[40:45] anoints them from that first dimension
[40:48] and that is why the book the legacy and
[40:50] spirit says they are naked wretched
[40:53] miserable and blind and they don't know
[40:55] it

[41:29] but we are not connected to the fourth
[41:31] dimension
[41:33] in fact we are not even connected to
[41:35] that sixth dimension
[41:37] we are connected to that seventh
[41:38] dimension
[41:40] amen and as a son and daughter of god
[41:42] when we get communication through that
[41:45] seventh dimension we are exercising
[41:48] sunshine authority we have power to bind

[42:18] possesses this
[42:20] authority this power through the access
[42:23] of the holy spirit
[42:26] amen in closing i want to tell you about
[42:28] this boy
[42:30] he was living in a farm and they were
[42:32] very poor
[42:33] and he
[42:34] they didn't have much
[42:36] and
[42:37] his father had a little mirror
[42:41] that every morning he should shave
[42:43] himself
[42:44] and the boy he would jump up or climb
[42:46] onto this log just to try and get a
[42:49] glimpse of himself
[42:51] but all he could see was little portion
[42:53] he could never see his full image
[42:57] he would look and he would see maybe the
[42:59] side of his face whichever side he
[43:01] looked but he could never see his full
[43:04] image
[43:06] amen
[43:07] but he had an aunt who lived in the city
[43:10] was very rich
[43:13] and they used to go there for christmas
[43:16] once a year
[43:18] and
[43:20] when he came of age and of understanding
[43:22] now
[43:24] he went there with his mom and dad
[43:28] they went for dinner
[43:30] and he is out playing in the yard and
[43:32] having fun and he is looking at the
[43:35] majesty and the beauty of this place
[43:38] amen
[43:41] now i'm typing that with ladies here
[43:43] and
[43:44] the bride of jesus christ
[43:47] amen
[43:48] they think they are rich increasing
[43:49] goods but they are paupers in the spirit
[43:52] yes
[43:53] but when they come here in the land of
[43:54] the spirit
[43:55] they are amazed
[43:58] in the realm of revelation amen that's
[44:00] right
[44:01] they stand amazed yes
[44:05] in our presence
[44:09] amen
[44:11] so
[44:14] after dinner
[44:15] he had the best
[44:17] meal
[44:18] seven course meal
[44:20] and he's asking where did you get this
[44:22] where did you get that
[44:24] where did you get this
[44:27] but it's a hidden mystery
[44:29] the aunt just smiles
[44:31] doesn't say much
[44:33] so the boy said let me go explore this
[44:34] house and he comes and there's a
[44:37] stairway going up
[44:38] and he sees there seven steps
[44:43] and he's climbing up
[44:45] seven steps
[44:46] to perfection
[44:48] he's climbing out
[44:50] seven steps to perfection
[44:53] when he comes on that seventh step
[44:56] it's a big landing there
[44:58] and he sees this huge mirror in front of
[45:00] him
[45:01] and he sees this boy
[45:08] amen
[45:09] and he walks
[45:11] he's amazed to see this boy because he's
[45:13] never seen this boy before
[45:16] the full image of himself and he goes
[45:18] towards the mirror
[45:21] and he sees when he moves this way the
[45:23] boy moves that way when he moves this
[45:25] way the boy moves that way
[45:28] he tries to duck
[45:31] [Music]
[45:34] and he tries to touch the boy and when
[45:36] he reaches out that boy is reaching out
[45:38] to him
[45:41] can't you hear me amen amen
[45:44] you're
[45:47] [Music]
[45:53] amen
[45:54] amen when he touches that he realizes
[45:58] that that's him yes and he springs up
[46:03] that's me amen amen
[46:06] and when we looked in the denominational
[46:08] world we saw portions of ourselves and
[46:11] they told us stay with the pentecostal
[46:13] blessings but we were not satisfied with
[46:16] that amen until we came to our
[46:19] kinsmen's house and we came to the top
[46:22] of that seventh step amen and they had a
[46:24] huge mirror of the world and when we saw
[46:27] ourselves the full image reflected back
[46:30] to us
[46:31] we saw ourselves in the mirror of the
[46:33] word
[46:34] and we say that's me
[46:37] that is me
[46:39] hallelujah a redeemed son and daughter
[46:42] of god back in his image amen let me
[46:45] tell you without the holy spirit we will
[46:47] not make it in this life
[46:50] we are going to be defeated in this life
[46:52] amen you'll become insane you'll become
[46:55] a wreck
[46:57] why don't we trust the holy spirit to
[46:59] lead us and guide us
[47:00] the one that was sent to lead and guide
[47:02] the church
[47:04] why don't we have him he'll empower us
[47:06] he's not like those demon powers who
[47:08] strip us naked but he clothes us amen
[47:11] hallelujah he says let us rejoice
[47:14] let us be glad the marriage of the lamb
[47:17] has come and his wife had made herself
[47:20] ready and to her was granted that she be
[47:23] arrayed in final in it
