will come and speak to your heart this morning amen we thank god for the unique gifts that he has given to thank god for the firefox ministry if you've been listening in and streaming in the messages that have been preached in the past couple months and weeks a lot of messages spoken about pressing into the rapture things that are to be the shout wing fought which is a message going forth amen we gotta stay in the continuity of god's word amen amen because god has given us gifts and god has given us his spirit and we stay in the spirit then there is a continuity of his word amen amen and we believe that we might seem like fanatics to some but why we keep speaking about the rapture the coming of the lord a body change but that's what we are called to win this hour amen that's what we are enlightened to and that's the faith that we are given in this hour amen remember faith is a revelation yes amen and you cannot speak about something that's not revealed to you amen but it's if it's revealed to you and that's you can speak about it it becomes open it becomes plain to you amen amen it becomes second nature to you amen so we're going to go into the scriptures this morning and we trust that god will bless our hearts amen we've got our bibles read the book of matthew chapter 17 from verses 1. the gospel of saint matthew says and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringing them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them now we know what transfigured meaning he was changed amen amen he was changed before there in other words as they were walking up the mountain they're walking look at jesus think of jesus in a natural form with his disciples walking up a mountain if you picture somebody walking after up a mountain is tiring your body becomes sweaty and the natural side looks exhausted amen but this natural side now is going to be changed right before them they've seen they're looking at they're walking with jesus from the natural side but how are they going to see something now something supernatural is going to take place amen something that they haven't seen in the natural form in their life or there never was a time when anyone had seen that and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light so they never seen something like this the way he changed his form he come into his glorified state amen and behold they appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with him here's the disciples witnessing firsthand that when those that go those that i believe in god go and sleep they don't just stay in the grave there's a place where they are and here they appearing before him before the disciples with jesus moses and elijah was alive all the time amen remember moses is typing those that died because moses died and elijah was caught up amen amen so they was there now in the theophany form but jesus now he he was transfigured into a glorified state now then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be if thou wilt let us make year three tabernacles you see the holy ghost wasn't given as yet yes yes peter now still thinking carnally he's still thinking in the natural because he's seeing moles and elijah in the state in this because now they know that they come from another dimension and they're living in the dimension and they're looking at them as supernatural beings and now they want to make tabernacles to also worship them see peter thinking in the carnival the holy ghost hasn't come down as yet amen he said while he yet speak he wanted to cut him off right there while he yet speak beyond a bright cloud overshadow them and be on a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son amen amen here comes the second adam now amen the first fruits of many amen the one has to die in the ground and because he will die in the ground he's going to bring forth many other sons amen he has the first the son son of god amen he's gonna come and he's coming to adoption amen asylum he is approved now amen aren't we living in an adoption age amen amen while he had spoke beyond a bright cloud overshadowed him and beyond a voice out of the cloud who said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased amen [Music] and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and we're so afraid amen i just want to read the way mark 9 puts describes him in mark chapter 9 it says 9-2 and after six days jesus take it with him peter and james and john and leaded them up into a high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them and his raymond became shining exceeding whiter snow so as no fuller on earth can wipe them amen amen so it was something that you can't even describe it in a natural amen there was no color on the earth or there was no filler that one that you know that here was material and all that nothing no michigan was made like it nothing there was no white or brightness like this on the earth in the natural there was no brightness like this amen yet the disciples what are we trying to say they're looking at jesus one part walking with him in the mountain in the natural form and now they're seeing his supernatural form and realize that this supernatural form had nothing ever experienced before amen amen we thank god for the reading of this word let's pray one more time father we thank you for your divine presence this morning we know that you are here with us father come lord and open the scriptures to us open our eyes of understanding give us the faith to hear your word of god and when we hear your word let us not just become yours but become doers of your word amen and let your word be embedded in our hearts let it do something to us father let it transform us from within the father and whatever transformation takes place within let it be reflected on the outside law we bring this natural man under subjection now in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you may take your seat tell our bible also to the book of saint peter chapter two say peter chapter 2 reading from sorry ii peter chapter 1 verse 14. second peter chapter 1 verse 14. knowing that shortly yes peter speaking now remember peter was the one who witnessed the transfiguration of jesus right is he speaking now knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle now those that understand the message language when the bible has revealed to you we understand when the bible is talking about the tabernacle he's talking about his body right so he's saying knowing that shortly i must put up this my echo so he come to your realization their day on mount transfiguration that what they knew about life was only temporal right and no doubt they've seen this they've seen the supernatural they've seen the first pool the first two pulls done they've seen jesus heal the multitudes they saw jesus feed them they saw the supernatural they saw what happened to the fishes amen but now and they've seen they were in the bible we had people raised from the dead amen but they all died again amen but now peter has come to the knowledge because now this is after pentecost now after he has the holy ghost and it's revealed to him that the life that he wants you is only a temporal life everything that he ever knew about his life until the holy ghost comes down was all temporal amen and what jesus showed him before he goes in the before jesus dies goes to the crucifixion jesus showed him what life is going to be like in that glorified form you can never die amen that's why in the book of revelation i am he which liveth and was dead and he's alive forevermore amen he didn't say i'm the one who was dead and live it now he's saying i'm i am he that limits amen and was dead and he's alive forever more amen amen so he was showing them in my transfiguration what what is going to be attained amen in other words there was like god playing out a drama or what you are going to attain amen that through jesus because jesus when he transfigured right there that glorified he could have went straight to heaven amen but he's come for a purpose amen god had to reconcile mad back to him because it was a promise that was made in the garden of eden by the seed of the woman amen now when when mary being a natural type a natural woman but the prophecy was already spoken of 800 years before gabriel even encountered visit her that a virgin shall conceive a natural woman going to have a supernatural experience amen but when gabriel visits her if she doesn't say to gabriel i'm receiving your word now beat unto me according to thy word yes mary is standing there on earth in the natural in our dimension on earth in a natural form but one comes from another dimension amen amen one passes the time barrier comes from another dimension comes and visit her and when he gives her the word of what's going to happen to her what happened she receives that word she said be unto me according to thy word amen and then what happened when she receives one from that dimension a message from that dimension which is pronounced in her dimension what happens something supernatural takes place in willingness amen amen the holy ghost overshadows her and she conceives of the holy one amen speaking about what happened in this day in 1963 amen a mighty angel comes down from heaven amen amen what happened with the shouts amen that was the message going forth amen amen and you're the bride the church was like a type of mary said be done to me according to thy word amen one come from another dimension amen come into your dimension and what happened you in the natural have received it with your natural senses because you began to hear it but what happened when you began to hear it something deep down within you deep down in the soul what was that it was faith amen it was faith that caught the revelation it was faith that connected to it amen and there was a connection and when there was that connection what happened you began to conceive amen you began to receive amen a word from another dimension amen and the very word that you received is going to do a work from within you amen amen daily daily you are dying naturally amen daily the natural man is dying but something is happening within you something is being renewed every day something is growing within you amen the supernatural he's growing within you amen amen and one of these days this natural is gonna put off and the supernatural is gonna take over amen and that's why nobody if you have a true connection with him if this message has been totally vindicated to you personally nobody no false prophets yes no deceiving theologian no intellectual person can come and deceive you from truth amen amen because the bible said the truth shall set you free amen and he said to whom the son of man set free is free indeed because when you receive this word that comes from another dimension what happened it was your year of jubilee amen you were the slave all along and you were slaving in his flesh in his past house but when he was being deceived from in satan's eden you was being deceived by signs you have been deceived by your educational system you are being deceived by the modern civilization but when one comes from another dimension and connects to you what happened the jubilee trump would sound it amen and you put everything down he said lay down this man amen you been you began to be convicted and you you something told you this is the truth you begin to repent of all your sins amen amen and then you come to justification amen amen and then by faith because you believed it you was justified amen and then what happened you went into that water amen you went into the water grave to watery grave because you wanted to die to that old man amen you wanted to die to that old man and what happened that whole out of stone amen began to become a heart of flesh and you began to be sanctified amen what happened there your own nature began to change yes amen your taste buds began to change you began to put on a holy man's taste you began to put on a thinking man's filter your desire for the whole things of the world began to change amen and now you no longer desire those things because why you are becoming sanctified and the purpose of you being sanctified is because he wants to put his spirit in you and his spirit is not a fully spirit amen his spirit is a holy spirit amen so you come to the process of sanctification and then when you are sanctified it becomes a place now for the holy spirit to come and dwell in you amen and when he comes and dwell in you he wants to come in every door in your hearts he wants you to open out all those girls all those hidden compartments because he just come he cannot just come and dwell in you he wants to come and have lordship of your life he wants to have leadership of your life amen that's what the bible says be not conformed any longer amen to the pattern of this world amen but be transformed by the renewing of your mind because there's a transformation taking place within you amen and when the transformation is taking place within you what happens the natural man began to put begins to project what is taking place within you the natural man becomes a reflector of the image of what's within you amen amen what am i talking about your nature your nature change the natural man is showing you now the things that i used to desire there's something testing for something else there's another testing within me amen that thirsting wants to receive of eternal life that thirst that thirsting within you cannot receive of this natural life because it's temporary it began to it becomes to be revealed within you that all that you are receiving is bringing forth depth amen amen every day when you look at the mirror you realize that your your body this body is decaying no matter how much you try to camouflage it with all the natural things that they've got with all the products that they have you cannot deceive yourself from within you the natural man the organs are all fading out but there's a spirit man that's growing amen there's a spirit man that is renewed daily amen so we find that peter is speaking here now he says knowing that shortly i must put up this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ and showed me what he's talking about now jesus showed him that when that tabernacle is put off there's another tabernacle amen amen he showed him that you're gonna change from a natural man to a glory of you to come to a glorified state that is the end result amen your end result of what you're going to attain peter is to become to a glorified state and we've come to the knowledge of the truth in this hour and we realize that we are not here by some form of religion because religion is man just trying to satisfy his conscience and i don't think anyone here this morning he's come here to satisfy his conscience because if you do that then you're wasting your time amen and i don't think that any one of you this morning want to say no i just lead a good christian life i don't dress up like the world i live a holy clean decent life if that is all it takes then you're wasting your time because religion can produce that religious religion can produce a people that is pious religion can produce a person with virtues religion can produce a lady that dresses up right amen it's beyond that those things you do because you have a revelation of who you are those things you do because you realize that the body is a tabernacle of the most high god amen amen it's beyond religion that you are here this morning you have a revelation that you are to attain something that we are not here to just establish church amen but we are part of a mystical body amen amen because we are connected to the headstone which has come down in this day and it was a uniting time amen of people called out from every organization from every system from every part of the world of people call out to be part of this body amen and under one spirit we all baptize into this body amen you see your water baptism may place you in a fellowship but your holy ghost baptism places you in the body and that's why if you've got the holy ghost baptism you will only find yourself as a particular group of people who've got something different from everyone else because you would identify yourself to an entire body amen i'm not talking about a body of denominational systems or a nominal church christian i'm talking about the body of christ amen amen amen you'll identify yourself as the entire body of christ in its entirety every church will be sovereign but i'm talking about a baptism placement where you are positionally placed in that body imagine to know your part in the body because until you come to a realization you're only living under a partial realization and you will never produce nothing because you're not connected to their body and you're not fulfilling god's purpose for you because god has a purpose for each of us amen amen that is why we are moving from the natural to the supernatural that's what we're speaking on this morning amen from the natural to the supernatural in the hour of translation amen amen we believe we're in our translation this morning amen amen all the signs all around us we can see that we're living in perilous times on the earth every nation is shaken amen i'll read that i'll read a quote to you now the problem of god says it's scared every nation is scared might as well like the white house you know what you know what's america like right now listen to what he says like a little boy in the nighttime passing a graveyard whistling in the dark can your spiritual years catch this acting like we big and brave but all behind everybody's shaking in their boots it's uncertain right our nation's treaty of peace and everything else is just shaking the united nations shaking everything shaking the bible said it would don't we have a virus that comes on the earth and leave every nation shaking amen every nation everyone no one can say they haven't been touched every industry has been touched amen but we receive a kingdom cannot be shook amen everything shaken is uncertain the season's uncertain you don't know whether to plant your crop if you haven't got some kind of irrigation the season's so irregular frost rain anything else can happen right in the summertime and you've seen that there's famine for food we don't have crops props are getting destroyed with locusts and things like that yes amen so we think that everything is shaken and no one is certain but in hour of uncertainty what what are you saying to you be certain of god amen amen if there's anything you can be certain about is be certain of god amen and that's why jesus was showing peter he showed to you that this is an example of what's going to happen he's going to be the first born of many amen but peter to come into this into this stage you have to go through the process amen remember we want a body change right this is our translation how are we going to go up there into the other dimension in this natural body we can't do it that is why nobody can understand the mystery of the rapture if they haven't received god's word in this hour amen mary would not ever conceived if she didn't accept gabriel's word she had to receive gabriel's word coming from another dimension that something supernatural was going to take place to where that never happened in the history of mankind amen a virgin conceived of that holy one amen so you have received in this hour you had to accept that one came down in this day amen from another dimension and you receive that word and that word now only that word under that seventh seal is gonna give you a rapturing faith amen because you're not going to have a change for the body no no matter how holy you are no matter how much you fast and pray no matter how much you attend church if that word is not revealed to you how are you going to have faith for the rapture amen peter james and john you've been seeing me healing the multitudes you see me turning what into wine you see me feeding the thousands but now i want to show you something peter james and john that was healing naturally those people that was raised from the dead still have to die but peter james and john there's something more to that you're going to need a body change amen you need a body change to get on the other side remember something those theories can only come down in this dimension when christ allows them to come down and pick up their bodies in the grave that if you when those theories are coming down this body is already has to be aligned with it he has to become one with it amen he has to dovetail with his body you have to become a perfect foot amen he has to doubt here with his body this natural body cannot go there dare to come here what the prophet was lying there going beyond the curtain of time lying in the bed he had to come out of his body and the body and he had to look at the body lying there and then he went in beyond the curtain of time and he went into the other body he stepped into the other body but there's going to come a time when those bodies have to come from that dimension to this dimension and transform this body into a glorified body amen amen so the prophet had then experienced where an out-of-body experience but it was another time when he's walking through amen look at this because remember now there should be an example of another son in this day remember he had an out of a body experience going through that i mentioned which is typing now the sleeping saints amen leaving this dimension and going out to another grain to the other body putting off this earthly tabernacle and putting off the other tabernacle but there was another time where he's walking while walking he has a body change amen amen while walking he has a body chain you never leave the body while walking here's the prophet having this experience because there to be a type in this day amen there to be one example in this day he had to have a body experience with change where you could see the deer right there and the deer could almost eat off his arm and everything changed the whole dimension changed he just entered into a dimension it didn't happen he actually it couldn't happen on earth he had to step into a dimension amen so here's the prophet that has the same experience and here's jesus now with his disciples before them while they're looking at him while they're watching him in the natural suddenly he's transfigured before them amen showing them y'all are going to attain this and in this body you can never die amen in this body you can never get old in this body there'll be no more sickness yes you're gonna go around peter you're gonna go around preaching the gospel you're gonna go around under the first two pools under the first pool and healing people and so forth but more than just healing them you are going to give them the gospel because the gospel is going to do a transformation in their lives and the gospel when they go down to all those six ages when they go down in the grave there's going to be one day amen the very word that they received amen there's going to be a resurrection and those graves are going to open up those graves have to give up those bodies and those theophony bodies are gonna dovetail with those natural bodies amen it's gonna change from the corruption to the incorruption amen but we are given another promise in this hour hallelujah we are given another promise where the mortals is going to put on immortality amen amen we are given another promise that some of you won't see that amen amen in the hour of translation some of you are going to move from the natural to the supernatural amen from the natural from the from the earthly body to the heavenly body so he says here moreover i will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance so he knows that the body must die but because it's revealed to him that life doesn't end against amen no matter what going to happen to this body he knows that he has to get perfect he has to take up his cross and follow jesus and if christ was persecuted he's also going to get persecuted he knows that but no matter what you do to that body he has a revelation and he's willing to give his life for it why would he do that why would he be willing to give their life for christ because they had a revelation that this life that they know is not life amen amen you know we know people we are persecuted in this hour you are persecuted for following the true word in this hour you are persecuted in the fact that they call you an oddball they say but you're talking about going away you're talking about being a citizen of heaven you're talking about leaving the earth but this is life we have to live here you have to do progress and do all these things if you do all those things what are the revelation of who you are where you're coming from and where you're going then you're wasting your time yes there have to there are things that we have to do in the natural to get by in this life but is that that is not all that is not our purpose amen we are called for a purpose in this hour we are called to have a body change in this hour amen we are called to be that people that will have a enoch work amen we are walking into translation in this hour amen amen enoch was that seven from adam and he was the one caught up he was translated because he walked with god amen and how's your walk with god this morning amen your work with god is when you recognize your day and your message when you recognize god in this hour when you recognize where god is in his people in this hour amen amen god is always on the move and you got to recognize god in the form that he is in and where is he now he's in his bride amen god bailed in human flesh again in a many member body doing the greater works amen sometimes you think you you're trusting god for something and you think of every natural way first to achieve what you want because we are so we have this conception so much of the physical realm we invest so much in the physical realm that we spend little time investing in the spiritual realm and that's why we see so less of the supernatural if you want to experience the supernatural you gotta tap in that realm you gotta spend time connected to him remember he's a supernatural god amen he's a messiah how did we get this message from another dimension it came supernaturally to us how did you receive this message you read the book like everyone else did you read it with intellect it was an intellect that gave me the message the same angel of god that came and revealed it to the prophet he's the same angel and god came and whispered into your ears amen he came and opened your understanding amen he come to give you skill and understanding in his hour amen he comes to reveal himself personally to you it was supernaturally revealed to you so if you received a supernatural word and you connected to him then the supernatural should be something part of our life when you become so much with him eventually you become normally become part of your life amen you're saying but that was in the days of the prophet no this is your power amen this the prophet had in that measure now is the time amongst the many member body to receive it amen the prophet added in that time because why god had to reveal himself to a son of man ministry but now he's revealing himself to the bride because she under a messenger receives that word and she becomes the final voice in a day amen she becomes the final voice in this hour how does she become a final voice she had to receive something amen she has to receive a supernatural word amen and each time you're connected with him he's taking you from the natural to the supernatural amen that is why now after the holy ghost come down and when peter all experienced this and that is why they could walk now they're looking at a man with a natural eyes with a natural five senses they're looking at the man there in the gate beautiful and he's lying there down there and he's begging they must have seen him every other day but now the holy ghost is upon them amen now they're connected to the supernatural amen this man is asking for harm amen he's asking for something they can give naturally to him because he wants something natural he he doesn't have a living because he is in the state but they looked at him they fixed their eyes on him now they're not looking at him now would naturalize because if they look at him with a naturalizer look at him in his condition that he's in a disabled condition and they cannot help him no they looked at him now with spiritual eyes amen they don't look at a natural man they look at it supernaturally and they said silver and gold which is the natural things have we none but such as we have which is the supernatural we give unto you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk amen what happened they were so connected now to the supernatural they are giving the supernatural amen are we connected today with the supernatural amen if we can't trust god for these little things if we can't trust god for natural i mean for small little things how are we going to have capturing faith amen rapturing fate lies in that word you must eat of that word john began to eat of that book man john was typing the bride you have to eat of that word i'm not talking about eating like reading with just human understanding i'm not talking about human understanding no no no we are beyond that now amen reading and trying to understand its meaning in the grammar and everything you're gonna go wrong because to understand scripture from genesis to revelation you'll find that sometimes scripture has come for meaning you've got to understand scripture in the way he's revealing it or you can look at the scripture for many times but until the holy ghost comes and reveals amen amen so he says for we have not followed cunningly devised fables you know what that means what is device favor something that was used in the dark ages to lure the people where they will speak about some phenomenal thing or something like that they'll be buying something that was like made like a supernatural which called mythology right they make a myth and then make it like a real thing they'll devise it for example they'll speak of a miracle that happened but it never happened they'll devise it they'll speak about these things they'll speak about doctrine they'll devise their business bible scholarly colleges and they'll make these doctrines and they receive the people but he says when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty amen for we received from god the father honor and glory when they came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and his voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mountains we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that's shined in a dark place and until the day dawn and the daystar rise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is our private interpretation amen for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of god speak as they were moved by the holy ghost amen so we thank god that this day we received a word that it wasn't devised it came from god amen amen it wasn't something made made up we all can see the latency of the hour hey man but we can see that people are being distracted they be distracted because there's so much of things that are happening in a physical realm right now people are dying every day people are losing their job people don't have food to eat people are getting retrenched from work these are the natural things that are happening around us and these are the distractions that come in the physical realm and people don't know what is happening but if they can go back to scripture amen if they can realize that these are modern events made clear by prophecy that this was foretold before it happened peter and the disciples and all these uh the fosters and all of them that followed jesus in the day when the persecution came upon them and each one supposed to started to get killed he didn't come as a shock to them they were it was foretold before it happened amen jesus told them what was going to come of them when paul was called by god god told him to paul almighty muslim for the gospel but people are getting shocked as to what is happening if you are a believer in god and you have received this message if the word has been revealed to you and you understand what is happening in this hour and the latency of this hour shouldn't be a shock to you you could speak to any unbeliever they all don't know what to do you all are scared and the bible says you cannot give us a spirit of fear but a power and of a sound mind what does fear do fear brings torment it releases a tremendous demon on you fear fear releases the tormenting spirit on you i'm talking about when you accept fear it releases the spirit upon you and that spirit begins to torment you and he put you in bondage but we never receive that spirit amen we received a spirit that will that will come to give us liberty in the day amen a spirit has set us free from bondage a spirit that set us free from slavery from the stressed house amen take god at his word amen yes amen in this hour when you have need take god at his word amen what does his word say he said don't worry what food you're gonna eat yes what clothes you gonna wear amen he said the birth of the air yes amen hey toy lord he had this food for him the lilies of the field thank you how are they clothed he said don't worry about the things your father know that you have need of something amen amen but you see god amen sometimes when you're in a situation when you when you're in a dark place and you don't know what to do that's the time you go and seek god you go to your father and say lord i'm in the situation yes and you're not mine yes and you you let off you forget about your natural senses yes amen amen amen when you're connected with that word you'll let off that physical realm right amen amen i'm not saying there's going to be everyone will go to their faith everyone goes to this phase when they come down amen look at elijah he had this great great thing going on he he encountered those false prophets on the mount carmel showdown amen and after that jesus because of the jersey bell's prophet jezebel said she will have him have his blood and whatever he began to run for his life because what happened now from the supernatural you have to come down to the natural amen he will switch gears so i'm saying now from the natural switch gear to the supernatural switch into gear and see what the world says in the midst of uncertainty be certain of god amen from the natural moving to the supernatural realm amen from jesus come from the supernatural to the natural amen because god had to be fashioned like unto men amen he had to let up everything he had to empty himself out he was made of no reputation you have to let off everything and come like a man but he had to be fashioned like a man amen so we can come to where he is amen because he has to take us back again to what was lost in the garden of eden man forfeited his rights in the garden of eden i don't know that adam was the image of god and they met dominion over everything everything was under adam's foot but adam forfeited that when he listened to you who listened to the serpent and by one word brought sin into the human race separation from god amen but jesus now he's showing disciple this is what you're going to go to then they began to see this is we know people even prophets can heal and pray pray for people that get healed but what we see now this is god this is not natural this is supernatural because you're trying to show them i come fashion like man because god had to come in human flesh god is a spirit right god is a supernatural being is a spirit it was easy for the for the jews listen to this now when moses was called up to receive the commandments of god and when god came in the the mount sinai in thunderings and lightnings and so forth what happened the people got scared this is moses don't let god speak to us let me speak to you you come speak to us amen they were scared it was easy for them to believe a supernatural god hallelujah but now it's coming 2 000 years ago now when jesus comes on the scene they can't believe that god who is a supernatural god confession like unto a man they can't believe that this great god can come in a natural form amen there they were scared of him they wouldn't go near the mountain moses speak to us but yeah he's put on his face they pull his beard they want to do all manner of things to him to the same god that he was afraid of amen and that is why we find today that when we tell the people he appeared to us in this day it's so hard for them to believe because they think about the natural he appeared but we never see him we never heard from him but you you go and tell them about the god of the bible yeah they believe you did the bible thing but they can't believe what he's doing in this day amen they can see this god in in 2000 years ago the gospels they can see this jesus working in the gospels but they can't see him right here then he appeared before us they can't see him in the way he's revealing himself and the same thing today with people it's easy for them to believe that he was here in 1963 he was here from 1947 right to 1965 amen working amongst the prophets but it's hard for them to see that he's working amongst the people now amen it's easy for him to believe cancer was healed in the prophet moses the the blind began to see the death began to hear the the lame began to walk the dead was raised it's easy for him to believe that but has god changed he's the same yesterday today and forever amen is it not the same spirit that was there is here now today amen is he not now in the bride amen amen all these mechanics you have received and received amen through your five senses you had the dynamics the mechanics right amen but it's time now to switch into the supernatural amen and let the dynamics take place because it's the hour coming now when you're going to have needs where you're going to have needs that your natural man cannot help you yes amen it was the time it actually happened in the first exodus they came out supernaturally god fed them supernaturally the clothes never ran old supernaturally they were healed there were no sickness of the boundary if there was the brah serpent was there how much more jesus christ amen that was only the example you can believe god then amen under the blood of bull and goats how much more now under the blood of jesus christ amen and how much more now in this hour amen when he comes to put claims over you amen amen when the book of redemption comes down in the day and how much more now when you have an identification with him amen amen when you have signing powers yes amen that is why the natural mind it's so hard for the natural mind to comprehend the the the the things of god because the things of god are spiritually designed it is how can you you deserve something spiritually if you are not connected to him amen and how can you be connected to him you never come under justification you're not sanctified you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah but how can you be connected to him how can the spirit of god dwell in you if you haven't even changed your heart of stone to other flesh if you never even had that changes yet there had to be a nature change amen there to be a nature change because now you realize jesus was the first born of many and he brought you now under a new citizenship amen that you are now no longer the citizens of this world all these elements that will die off of these temporal elements you are citizens of heaven amen jesus come from the supernatural to the natural we are going from the natural to the supernatural amen amen we are going to be transformed from natural from mortal to immortality it's so hard for us to to believe things god for to believe god for the supernatural because everything we in our life if we want to achieve a home we think about we have to get a job we have to get a we have to get so much mortgage to get a house and when we try to conceive how we're going to make this money but did we ever go and pray and say lord i lay this at your feet yes you direct me to get the right job yes you direct me to get the right raise you direct me to get a nice good enough salary to afford a mortgage and get a house if you just look at things only naturally that's what the people of the world do yeah we are not called on to that amen amen and neither are we called to build our kingdoms on this earth right because the bible says godliness with contentment is great gain amen if we've got the basic things that's good enough god don't want you to go hungry god never make history the righteous god will not leave the righteous forsaken nor lay when he let his children bake bread yes god will not god like his children to be happy god knows that if you're in need of a shelter you'll provide that for you amen god knows you have need of an automobile to take you from point a to point b and he'll provide that for you but god knows that you need clothes you need food he knows that but god wants you to seek refurb his kingdom and his righteousness then all these things shall be added unto you it is easy to take the scripture and say all this thing shall be added unto me but what about taking the first part seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and from the time we receive this word there's been hungering and thirsting within us for more and more just like how you feed your natural man if you don't feed that natural man anymore you stop drinking water you stop eating food that man will start to die how do we expect to achieve anything in the supernatural if we're not feeding the spirit man i'm not talking about coming to church and receiving a sunday message or a midweek message i'm talking about an individual work i'm talking about a personal relationship because it's a uniting time and a sign you know what a dangerous i want to see if you haven't been united with him am i if you haven't been united with him there was many who came and said lord lord have i not prophesied in your name lord i will not cast out demons in your name what he said depart from me workers of inequity i know you're not yes amen they haven't been united with him in the way he came in this hour hallelujah the pharisees and said you see the holy people they thought they were united with god through the law but the way he came they wasn't united with him the nominal christians are going to church they're talking about they're confessing jesus they're praying to jesus and they sing miracles because the bible says the rain falls on the just and the angels that doesn't mean they are saved they are getting miracles because the rain is falling but we're talking about we're talking about getting in the translation we're talking about the rapture in faith now they are receiving christ i mean speaking about christ they're professing christ they're using christ's name in prayer and so forth and they think miracles take place and god only deny them that because those are the spiritual gifts the lying spiritual gifts and the reason why it's falling is because the bride is on the earth yes that's the fact the rain has to fall because the bride is on the earth am i but it's going to become an hour when the bride is taken off the scene amen because she's going to transform from the natural body to the supernatural body amen from mortal to immortality when she leaves the earth it becomes the closing the grace days of gentiles and then what happens the rain starts to fall on them but the rain will fall as long as the bride is on the earth [Music] world they could see no sin they could see no pain they could see no death they only could see that yet it wasn't fully revealed to them but when they received the baptism of the holy ghost nothing in their natural life mattered more than them wanting to attain what was supposed to be yet they never they never they themselves had to die they had to die they had to go by the way of death but they knew that was a door to an immortal life amen that was a door to another life but we are living in the hour now we have this promise this is our promise that is why this is all we speak about we speak about a rapture we speak about a body change we speak about leaving this past hour we speak about this earth being changed because we're living in the hour where god's three four purpose has to be fulfilled coming to completion amen restore fallen adam man back to dominion again to restore falun eve to bring his church into a condition where she wouldn't accept anything else she won't accept any deception that the serpent owned the savior with his word she will take god at his word that he's restored eve amen the world is gonna celebrating woman's day women want to achieve and get something they feel that was taken from them or they want to to come to some achievement they want to achieve something in life but here's the bride of jesus christ she has come to her achievements she's come to all fullness in this hour amen she's rising up in her power amen because why she received the baptism of the holy ghost which is the earnest of the inheritance amen the down payment amen she received a kingdom which cannot be moved she received a kingdom amen and those people saw the kingdom coming in power when they saw jesus in a glorified state they saw the power of this kingdom they saw that this is something that contains death this is something supernatural amen as we've seen the kingdom come in power in this day have we seen the supernatural in this day amen have we seen god come our way amen let's open to john 1 john 3 2. beloved now are we the sons of god and don't not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen amen we shall see him as he is we shall also have that body him and aren't you glad that we're going to have a body and we know what it is if you want to go to space you can't just go there you gotta you gotta go and learn how to be an astronaut you gotta have the right equipment you gotta have the right gear on and it takes you a long time to practice how to become an astronaut if you want to get into that dimension if you want to get into the rapture you got to know what it takes to get there you got to know what it takes to have a body change you got to come to the process to justification certification baptism of the holy ghost coming and accepting his word in this day come and apply the token in your life the holy ghost word that comes down amen this message is a holy ghost message amen he's not a message from a man it's come from another world the headstone has come down to be connected with the body and that's what the world rejected in this hour when they rejected the headstone they couldn't be part of their body when they rejected the message of the hour they rejected the headstone and they were no longer connected with that body they were not united with him and they lost their chance to go into the rapture because as hell was spoken from this very pulpit that the rapture is a cycle it's a process that already started yes amen and if you're not already caught up in that process and you're ready for some future events it'll already be gone and you'll continue life like normal rapture is not some future event it's a process that already started what's going to happen next is the resurrection of the sleeping saints and when they come and we which are alive and remain also will be quickened with them the sleeping sings their body is gonna end the sixth dimension is going to empty out those theoretically bodies those theorem bodies are going to pick those earthly bodies whether it went in the grave whether he went in the fire when it was eaten by lions when it went in the sea amen whichever way it went it's going to come up amen it's going to come up in a glorified state amen and you watch our life and remain your bodies the six dimension is also going to empty out your theoretically amen and it's going to connect with this body but if you are not connected to it now if you're already not connected right now don't wait for a future event amen you're gonna miss the rapture you can be in you can receive a prophet you can come to the you can have the see the pull of fire you can see the supernatural cloud you can come to the right baptism you can heat of that spiritual manner and you can still miss it amen the first exodus what happened they came out with moses they had a prophet they had the pull of fire they had the supernatural cloud they went through the red sea but they wasn't there to cross over jordan amen it's crossing over time amen it's the hour of translation amen amen it's time to put out the old man from the natural and moving to the supernatural amen in our way everything is shaken it's remember these bodies cannot go there amen but they will come here amen amen those theophony bodies is coming here amen and then it will take it will quicken this body and then this body will go there in a glorified state amen amen we will go there in glorification amen from the natural to the supernatural in the hour of translation amen the holy ghost comes down in this day to make you live a life as he separated from the world a total separation from unbelief amen when you come when you have a total separation like abraham he had to be total when god called abraham in the land of babylon he had to come out of his land leave his kindred then he had lord taking a lot with him eventually he had to be separated from lot as well amen then when lord comes out and he's just abraham now and sarah because sarah is connected to abraham what happened then he comes down when elohim comes down he speaks about the promised son tell us the last sign before the coming son amen he deserves heart gives them a name change before the body change comes a name change amen now you realize you forget about now you are recognized no longer the son and daughter of muslim muslim so and so you're forgetting about that first birth now you recognize your second birth man you realize that the second birth is more important now than your first birth amen the first birth put you on his heart to get tried to get tested because your son and daughter of god he put your ear to all these trials and errors because of sin you are stepped in that body but your second birth becomes more relevant to you now and you begin you forget about the first birth then you realize who you truly are you have a name change amen you see your name in the book and you see that you are part of him amen amen you're connected to him and then when you have that when sarah and abraham had the name changed what happened he had a body change hallelujah amen and the body chain produced isaac amen we have the name change we receive the new name we receive him in this day we are about to receive that body change amen amen god bless you let's stand up and have the musicians to come over amen amen from the natural to the supernatural in the hour of translation amen we've seen the supernatural in our day amen [Music] hey amen you appreciate the word of the lord amen let's give the lord a good clap of praise amen let's all stand together even as
