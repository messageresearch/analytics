you know the taxi this we all going full swing you find the loss so people that are infected that spread it around so it's a it's a very trying time we are living it right along the world also today the first of July the mentioned Israel is going to take parts of the West Bank under their control and there's gonna be a lot of protests with the Palestinians already they're starting firing rockets into the Mediterranean Sea and things like that so they're still calling for the destruction of Israel right so we know what the Lord told us to watch for the victory amen we know the gospel is going back to the Jews already right and God is got a hundred and forty-four thousand a thank you you will take care of so we're just gonna go through a little excitation in the book of Genesis also like to once again wish discover happy birthday Raul let's say keeper she's a very generous sister with the family very accommodating and they like to provide meals for the people okay Robert Genesis chapter 2 we're going to speak on getting to life life here how we can have life if we stay with God's Word if you still God's Word we live life see and speed of light and unbelief unbelief will bring death and destruction right get assist up to - really from verse 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayst eat freely freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die praise Allah so the day they eat of the tree then to the guy we went to Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay and God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit the tree which is in the midst of the garden God and said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be hoping and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil let's pray you have any Beechnut to just raise your hand Lord Jesus thank you Lord even as we came this evening long songs that have been sung to praise you and give it gonna Rob the prayers that went forth and all the exhortation and a proof single day we give you praise tonight Roy thank you rob we can be standing here a few of us back in this country Lord with our country and the whole world is it a penny lots of people like hospitals a lot of people are in quarantine and Lord lot of people have died and Lord the fear is still gripping the hearts of the people and although we have great scientists in the world people that are learning that study but not there's not one single thing they can do at the moment a lot therefore our fight will only bested me we are trusting you Lord that you'll make a way for us keep us by your grace Lord each and every one of us you see our hearts you see our requests will make a way for us and Lord in at this present world you're already to be caught about as it was in the days of Solomon and Lord it's a shame to mention things that are being done in this world today God is pathetic the condition of the people had way to look or what we just kind feel calm and do what you said you'll do again we pray that you bless over 200 hot slob and baby think understanding lorded and know what your one is telling us that we may not come short but find grace in your eyes Lord bless us tonight given as you come at me ask it all in Jesus precious and never failing name amen please let me be seated so blocked all that but then you heat up the tree you're gonna die and the separate set you'll not die how do you believe then Adam and Eve and by the grace of the Lord we go to him and one day are we going to see anybody amen how many of you believe never see them but God's are they gonna die and they did what God told him not to do how are you gonna see them he did anybody got upset so God said you bet that so he never means that they're gonna die straight front of them physically fall down and die right the death is separation from God they'll be separated from God that's what he meant the day that you eat thereof will be separated but what God did by His grace and mercy need to be him go cause I'm concerned he wouldn't have slain and anymore must have been a man or something and make clothing for them he was still concerned although they disobeyed it so to get that animal skin there was a nice day to the dog so god straightaway native atonement and also after he brought the cases upon death and he told him the seed of the woman he sees spoke about the seed of the woman to come which is Jesus Christ praise the Lord light day the Garden of Eden right there when they disobeyed God he spoke about the seed of the one what is the will come and do he is going to be the reality of them aim and mentioning his own blood so no no God said they you know they couldn't tie and you know we friend God also eat you that he wanted this to happen like God wanted this to happen so knowing that we put them on a free moral agency they must make a choice see so we find that's why Satan couldn't come to to help he was always on creation I became too he was taken out of an editor but and he take them through he the woman right and this devil you already what God told it because I mean said oh we we must not eat of all the trees and don't eat of all the trees but what we don't eat he said you shall not die what is it you put one word Amen and that brought chaos destruction amen did cursing and it was guessed that you you work by the sweat of his brow to endure living and also the woman will bring for child in sorrow there will be a painful experience see all because of disobedience amen see so when when people disobey God right that is unbelief the Prophet tells us that is the biggest sin unbelief amen so what he said I believe not believing the Word of God is unbelief right so God God didn't make a total death but God continued the wrong and he still gave his word he still established his word when he brought Israel the children of Israel out of Egypt he still established it world gave them a covenant getting the commandments in that you must keep this one a matter if you don't keep this way you're going to be destroyed amen so God always kept his word see it's a word that the people must feel amen and if they don't keep that word like that is how belief not really believing the word like in our day now if they don't really keep the word the revealed word for our day that came by the hoping of the word and the restoration of baptism and got it and many other things marriage and divorce if they don't keep that and go against at work that's unbelief amen see they can be Christians that can be great to chirp so you can do all these things but because of unbelief God is gonna deal with them see when it comes to his word but on play Amen see God buddy when they say something is very serious amen people must keep that word see we don't meet people now they they take the Word of God lightly amen and you tell them sure of the scriptures baptism Godhead and elegent divorce and serpent seed and oldest thing now in order believe whether the same and the other says in the book of Revelation there at 22 if you add one word or take one word the name is gonna be thinking about a man they know that see so it's a it's a very serious situation let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 30 we just confirmed it that God is keeping his word if I we can come to church we can say we believe God we can save me in the message and we don't keep the world it doesn't mean much hey but keeping that word important amen see living before the Lord even as God set the limit I know that you you you come out this house well if daddy shouldn't it be destructive see so just to confirm Mia Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 15 so God is telling the children of Israel yeah they came out now and then we're going to go possess the land and then and God went to them for himself this nation you know for his Americans and he wanted them to keep the word amen see all he's asking them to keep the word and acknowledge him he says don't go to these other gods simply gods of the people of the way and why you're gonna take over but just keep my word and knowledge me that's what he's asking see and then he says look what it says to them to their army Thank You verse 15 see okay I need a little bit up to get for you to pick up what is happening for this commandment which I command you this day is it not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that perhaps for the same we shall go up for us to heaven and bring it to us that we maintain it and do it neither is it beyond the sea and Bowsher to say one shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may get it he said he says you don't have to go searching and looking for the word I'm giving it to you amen right but the word is very near thee say in the mouth in the heart the Dharma is do it amen whatever you do it the world is in your heart the word is in Arma we must do it pay zero even but the word is very near up to me in my mouth in da Gama's do see I've sent me for me this day life and good amen death and evil exactly what he told Adam and he did the day you need to go to die I'm giving you my way if you're not gonna keep it dead an evil amen verse six in this I command thee this day to love thy God amen to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and statutes and his judgments that there is love and multiply and that God is only good you know good for them amen you want to bless bless them amen and the Lord our God shall bless thee in the land where the God goes to possess it justice just acknowledge me keep my word I'm gonna bless you I'm good it'll prosper in the sled what it does not turn away huh so people they don't want to keep the word if your heart turn away even friends it's time that we took the Word of God serious amen see when we come and stand in the chat will this will be too late like we're speaking to her brother and we were showing in the scriptures a marriage of the wash took you through the Word of God took it through the quotes in spite of that you still wanna go do wrong it's part of knowing the way see but he's got not turn away so he's hot turned away from from the world so people have can turn away from the world meet other people about their the world of work today and how they must connect themselves as Christians and everything the heart turns away from the world and they will still tell you I'll give you to understand how my Christian I said God and I wish you bought it see but if I not turn away so the doubt will not get maybe some people don't yet amen don't speak to us it's messy you know yo y'all want to believe it you go believe it leave us alone me okay and that will stand in the judgment against them but if they're not in a way so that thou shalt but yet but shall be blown away and worship other gods and serve them and denounce up to you this day that we shall surely perish and the tree shall not prolong your days upon the land whether the parcel of a Jordan to go to possess it look at this time I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death amen I'm calling every to witness I'm sitting before you life and death blessings and cursings therefore choose life amen amen choose life that broke down and I see may live man choose life and I was that by keeping the world amen amen nothing nothing either that that disc eating the world what's in them cakes Jesus there and also demonic treatment buddy what do you want not keep the world but Jesus those three times holy Satan it is returned hey man it is returned it is Richard price alone so we must have why the word - Amen if we are confronted with something or whatever situation find the one and say it is written hey man if we can stay like that it is written this is where I want to stay say so remember you must choose between life and death amen and God is giving the people at church today just get into my chance I'm giving you the word you have a choice so in that way God is not going to be a beauty I'm giving you my word you make a choice amen see the promises God don't send anybody to help they send themselves praise the Lord agreement so that's why he even though he'll believes brought death and destruction and sorrow she humbly dead destruction sorrow to the human race but thank God there was a second added so we say but we asked him if anybody was going to be there that's gonna be very very unfair because he had a very something really take with the worship of God and one except Abel Abel came with his burnt offering and Gora Gora accepted it so who told him that Xiaomi had an asset or me what happened now he was laying he was led to do the right thing and take note you can read that in the Bible when God put the curse he said by the sweat of your brow we shall kill them and it's gonna bring forth thistles and thorns and everything he's gonna have a hard time but you find when Adam and Eve is when Cain and Abel is born who does the telling of the ground Cain and Abel is a keeper of sheep varies a lot so he was looking after sheep over there and that wasn't he said 12 ton brother past is there the Greenglass the waters and he was just looking up the sheep but Cain was tilling the ground see how the cascada fell onto Cain so Abel had him told him about you know what the original sin was and some light was revealed to him he must take a lemon slate Freddy's alone and God had respect unto that so God is going to accept Abel right if you go to book of Hebrews by faith Abel offered that regarded more excellent sacrifice but now nothing's mentioned about Adam knowing he was mentioned about enemy see when he talks about Cain and Abel saying sacrifice God rejected he was gone accepted prays a lot so I believe they're gonna be there because God made an atonement in the way the Prophet described it he says God took that skin and read them and he and he had them going out of the garden those skins flattening as they walked to be good blood but something's too bloody you put the buddies think about them because they make the whole cavalry and what the Prophet said the covering is religion today people wanna put the whole covering see God is giving us the word amen and when the word that the bride will be blessed he plays a lot he's given us a word to be dressed it we can't be pressed to the Word of God see so let's go three places the sea so I was looking up there and a lot of people are saying it is not living anywhere that where they can enable will be sorry anybody will be you know I'll be revealing I mean the first letters the first two people are left and brought life upon the earth so God maybe atonement see now let's see so if God said that anyone's going to die now I mean how many of you know how many years ever lived anybody here how many years in animal oh nine eleven thirty years but God said you shall die but he virtually lived a full life 930 years right and he's a great great grandson Ben tolosa he lived for I think 969 years but another descendent from there lived also for over 900 years see there never died instantly see but God ended the torment for him amen see and they they are the first ones I believe we're definitely going to see them and God after all he he wanted them to for well because a promise anyone assurance attributes see what all this display so I bet you that never happened so to display this means that we tried to separate here was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field but he was kicked out from him because the first one was country dilemma so you can imagine before Ben was created the was started in heaven and this Lucifer was a very beautiful created beautiful looking and you were so powerful he was able to include two-thirds of the angels to come on inside see it was a fight what happened he was kicked out enough so ever since then he was looking to come against God's plane he thought he was coming against God's plan but it was working one cosplay because God allowed it say so we find those two seats the serpent seed right so you look in the genealogy if you look it comes right up and stop by sin bypasses Kate goes to they two-headed see Adam said okay he's left up so Kang wise father hid him he's supposed to be there also then should be there amen so he was the one includes him amen he was a was bringing unbelief so are the people not believing today goddess send them a strong delusion then believe a lie the Bible says that amen they'll depart from the truth and they'll bleed everything else for the will of God okay so Ramona once unbelief sets in but so that's why God start drawing the line people know how to believe he's given them the way they got a hunter slate nobody could come and say I don't know God probably gave the word amen I read it from Revelation 12:9 okay this is one of the other translation that thinks amplified translation revelation 12:9 and the huge dragon was cast down that whole serpent who is called the devil and Satan e e o is the seducer the deceiver of all humanity the world over he was forced out and cast down to earth and his angels were flung out along the sea to tens of the angels the deceiver the seducer so you thinking other people are adorably but they are they are influenced by the devil not to believe see because he came to say to the said you know if that be the Son of God and you can do better codes you can do this ever why should be a no see so that's what this devil has got the people it's given them all these things that is offer them things which the LORD refused okay the message gives and colleagues are without repentance he says here the gift itself doesn't do there's no way for anybody to ever have anything from God except by faith amen see to accept anything from God it must be by faith God has made that is way that was from the beginning for the people to believe God by faith that was given to Adam and Eve to believe God's Word and when Eve disbelieved God's Word then he brought death sorrow sickness seemed to disbelieve God Amen you would be now to disbelieve God see so he would be you must be very careful you might eat now but how am I gonna displease God well as young young people youngsters yeah male and female you might need a partner they're going to take you away from the world are you going to stay with a word and believe the word are you going to disbelieve the word and go with an unbelieving partner it's happened a lot of places see so you have to stay with the word and blink God's Word are you going to discipline works with right right so they're a brand staggered not at the promise of go through and believe that he grew stronger amen no unbelief is gonna move a grin the father of faith Craig's a lot thank God that his face was slide then we can be the children of Abraham through Jesus Christ amen amen okay in the message at thy word now only thing you can ever get from God is my fake amen so we got em tremendous faith if you want anything from God you know you'll only get it by faith amen now many of us take now okay what I want is a good faith I'm going to pray just work great no look this is what I need this is what we do for me no you must be that's a Vienna doll so what about that with a woman that came to the king she bested him amen he sent you away but she came every time then he said himself listen yet she's troubling me give her what you want let it go you gotta be persistent she wants something from God really mean business amen be persistent and then I will not leave you till you bless me oh who said that take her I will not sleep alone get me to a wrestle rule alone thank you I simply get into a rest of the road Amen lord I need this law please I won't leave I would and I'm going to believe I'm going to trust you hmm amen praise the Lord not going to come easy so only thing you can ever get from bodies by faith and the reason that I say that they will be turbid here or either coat what's wrong with in and told the reason why they can't be is because I believe what he told me is a truth so I talked to my discernment now that people come right and for these years he stood by me and I know he will now it's because I believe it just believe it just with all my heart and soul and body and mind and you believe that and then if your number is called tonight in the prayer line and if God reveals your heart and speak to you and give you totals here don't you never have any kind of testimony only that he healed you because if you do if you one can testify to the other side that negative side he'll come back to you worse then it was it was so let me say you God said something and having pronounced you an ear or something don't be negative about it be positive about amen see if you don't be positive then even telling us see so God said something believe it and press on hold on to that word amen just remember if he can't accept it from those bases don't come at home in that seat to the plane ride don't come at home see cause it would be embarrassing yeah before the audience any RV and you have to be told them and so don't come at home look what I said if you're going to be negative about what God is going to tell you don't cut it off amen and if you get a doubt at all you waste your time gonna work against you so what I say if God is going to tell us something and tell us it won't be positive about Amen keep that word cp+ see because the Bible said go and sin no more the worst people come up on you now sin is unbelief see the first sin was committed by him because she disappeared God's Word that's where the whole thing weighs tonight disbelieving gods would see you believe God's Word as it is written yeah you don't need nothing else plays a lot don't disbelieve God's Word we leave nothing else amen see that God's Word is not a man's word to remain even out and rising and trying to say well you cannot listen to me you're going to believe what we believe then you're going to make it no it's God's Word amen see so I said bleep God's Word and nothing else our ancestors by the time we are living in how many people have defected and went to the tulips Kiki come on up how did people believe this machine and walked for a while then the 2 loxp she gave all the scriptures were there you know all day in church acres Christ a mystery of God reveal Christ is the mystery of God revealed but now we can now go and say now we believe in two logs and the proverb reaches every time he changed his mask he took on a body of flesh and he came amen so before before he can even visit the library Help listening so are these two lots see the the left teaching now unbelief setting why because of a man and then came to influence them and stopped it and they left it whipped but I want to say if you don't believe this never seen you would stay with the words you're not gonna run with the crowd a man so the British never see will finally be a small group of people that were really stable the word and and regard some real faithful ones around the world and really staying with a true message of God see and then you got all over the world people are saying this and saying nothing and running year running their dream over but the true bride is predestinated she's not good either the unbelief people take it you know so likely to leave the word and we'll do something God's one that's why I said man shall not live by bread alone but every word that God sends a man see so I tell you what we we can't stay with this work that we are nothing much say to stay with the word is what net is so constant word is nothing much okay the message Redemption by judgment now God when he loved adamant he so much that the intersession blood the judgment was dead and he had to do something something had to die in the stead and then they could stand there in his presence now if there was judgment he first listened to sent him and he whitewashed the word over so what degree they are whitewashing the went over same thing and the discipline oil and the word then became God's judgment amen the world became God's judgment not this word the Word of God will judge every person in this world that's been preached yeah this morning his big preach Tonya at the Wall Street preached over there at Christian Church down to the Brisbin championship wherever the word is be preached it becomes the judgment men are judged by the world and here is one good thing you know either of judgment goes before us or it'll follow after us amen happy for sure we've got to be judged by Jesus Christ the word now every man here today doesn't have to be judged and the him he can be judged this morning if he wants to be judged now there has to be a preparation made for judgment now if God in order to bring everybody into his presence he had to make a propeller and what did what did what what did that see if you don't believe in grace what will be grace they have extended his presence and his to Earl and first see cranes provide a preparation amen oh how happy I'm for that grace provided and preparation grace Islam God's will love these fallen creatures that he provided a preparation to stand then in his presence before judgment see what it did before he could judge them and pronouncing his grace word first Fluellen see so the atonement was already made but the paid for the home see yet they had to pay for the wrong God rented killed a sheep or Hannibal's and and put skins on them to cover them up and blood was first made before judgment the judgment was through the blood of course and then he shed the blood of the innocent to cover up the guilty the guilt of the guilty praise Allah now there is no other gods in any other religion does that amen truly the God of the Bible crazy okay so the Bible tells us here would God brought them out of Egypt why didn't ever make it to the promised land because of their unbelief the provoked God cuts in oh my god their letter prophet they went through the baptism your letter cloud experienced five pillar of fire experience but you know where the bugs are then they make spot while a serious thing was taking place Moses gone there God is busy writing out the Word of God to bring the commandments to them they will make spot they were playing they made the calf and they started worshipping the cows can you make it a time like that and the Prophet was there let me become of the wind so I destroyed all of them why the Bible says because of the hot belief so Paul tells us in the book of Corinthians a 1 Corinthians let us be we're like how they provoke God and fell that does not be guilty of the same things amen so he tells us the same thing since today when you use voice I did not your heart a man see as in the provocation God I'll be up they're going to come and stand in the judgment now the world of the word of God say God the Word of God came clear in the last days look around and see would share tower or leader somebody brought the Word of God in the measure kept in the message none of them that I'm in this preaching but God sent a message to bring the full word that razor oh so this word that was delivered unto us it meant to disbelieve that we're coming the judgment say what they do they take the Word of God traveling under faith isn't it put him to an open shame that's what the Apostle Paul said see it wouldn't be guilty Hebrews 3 18 and 19 and to hope that is well and they should not enter into his rest but those who disobey see who had not listened to his word or refused to be compliant or be persuaded so we see that they were not able to enter into arrest because of an unwillingness to adhere to and Trust in and rely on God and believed and shut them out humbly shut them out so we brother brother told us God is a very fair God which ever way he acted in the past must do the same things he's going to bring the same judgment amen so the helis take note of it when it's a Word of God we need to stay and believe and obey that word of a man see because say that word was given to Adam and Eve as a defense defense they came out of the defense and would Elizabeth the servant they disobeyed God but listen to the serpent which was inspired by the devil see so people would more bleed lies today that misinterpreted don't believe the Word of God same thing they listen to the devil and listening to the Word of God breaks a lot proving his word look what it says in proving his worth don't you realize but dear precious friends at this planet that Satan makes you a promise he will make you one of the best ministers in the Association he will give you the front seat in every Church and make you a deacon he will do anything if you'll just get away from his world so what is the promise signal Satan can promise in the church notice kill him the world and all the kingdoms he would take them he was trying to get him to break that word cuz he knowed he had him right there if he could he made most of Britain's he may even break it but he hit the wrong guy this time plays a lot I'll be glad for that jeez have to stand the test he was not Moses or anybody else he was a word made flesh and I'd say to came there he hit the wrong throw guy says he was a word and he didn't know it he was a word himself I can see him we want to picture him kind of a kids picture I can see that being all black wings flap against him and saying now I'll tell you what its pleasant you should fight and God said if we did we would die oh well Charlie you know you won't I see oh that's nonsense that same old fogey idea don't you believe man but God said so God proved it right and it's brilliant right now people are dying this minute he will prove it right notice when you cut to Moses who said Moses you know you gotta hook him see your high-tempered look what that bunch of the Renegades has done see why don't you just go there and really tell them about it and Moses went there nice mug the rock twice huh but when he hit that 10,000 volt line it sends his fellows when he ran up against him and he said oh listen said I'll give you all the kingdoms and he said it is written and then it is open suddenly the world saw above us now when we are confronted with something find a word wait is a man huh find the word but we bring it down and come down if you are the situation you want to live like husband and wife it is written no fornication maybe even understand clearly now it is written no fornication you must only live as husband and wife after you get married so the government oh man you know doesn't matter you know you'll be feel good about it you know you need to grow up now you need to be a little bit mature you know everybody's doing it and the Prophet one is preaching says it ah it's like finding a needle in a haystack you find a woman no a girl who has not been living loosely like looking for a needle in the haystack see and they all sit down and say everybody's living it up you know let's go to the party and all this you know everybody's living in a dream the whole thing you know rave parties and you know we're gonna be stuck up huh so it starts there I tell you yeah you go to one of those parties then and just stick around see how quickly you want to get into the account sin looks good cilix empathizing after you partake of it brings forth there looks good saludos putting all this movie out there teenagers going and having party and you know everything planned said everything else everybody thinking that's life and God sent the Prophet says dead dead he said that was in hotel and I saw other work heading on these young people and what wasn't they look they say give me this is like he said but that's been see how the dough is coming up about the life now the Covenant I see some other way so sometime people will be careful see if you know be a bait for the devil see you can be a blade for the devil then he'll come notice when he come to Moses ok Moses ok of it but hit those 10,000 volts it is and he said if thou be the Son of God see he's always doubted it if thou be the Son of God he sees God adapting it today he's Jesus God see thou be the Son of God he's always doubted it he still teaches others to doubt it he don't eat about it cut Moses he taught all of them to planned out it he's teaching you to try to about it and you that sitting right here now if you want me to call your names it's being Satan's been trying a long time to get you to doubt be sin from say I could go little angel Satan is trying to get you to duck me don't you do that sister if you do that well or not be but just doubt just believe this way you don't have to believe me but you believe this see if I say that word if I say this word it's not mine it's his my words different but this is is the other stuff I don't want to get into that right now notice promise of all his words absolutely true he proved it he proved because he proved he was their true word mention of libretto but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God now how does he live by well if you just take some of God's Word you look now that wasn't what he said see not some of God's Word how does he look oh it's a bit though his that is dying fast that's flesh but he belongs to church believes everything but that he's still dead you get it he can only live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God amen the high priest the bishop the Cardinal the pastor he says God every word that proceedeth after part of God amen how do we know it's God's Word he says so then he proves it see he proves his word amen notice that if that be so the confession will not make you look your chest membership will not make you look notice by his word only amen ba is word only not just one word misplaced see one word kill the human race in the Bible amen see and he says in revelation 22 one word will still kill the whole thing his name will be taken on the book of life and see we should also mention had one or take one word see I I don't mean not two words just one word not one sentence one word one word he says o people do you understand one word can change the whole thing so now I am NOT just exactly talking to this audience this is staked you see and it goes all over the world so it's for us he meant turning their way is bitching because all over the world see to be honest game people of the world that one word one word not one sentence not one paragraph one word that's all Eve disbelief I will think cultural overlooked it and watch it up forgiven them she said Satan begat me and me we should have got to deal with that but Satan for the 7 know ye although the game is what you put up a free bottle agency because you have done this thing and headed what's wrong with you you suppose with our little creation I know the woman you gave me kind of expected to stand up see passing the buck now you see the movement you gave you another story I mean you put me to sleep I don't know she she's awakened this is this is good see pass the buck and then got her to be with him also you know what imagine he could call all the animals name them like in giraffe zebra he was like a god of the ever chat wat what's he done yeah but now he disbelieved God would eat and he went in telephone so when he was not supposed to do say well the serpent couldn't answer nothing he just you must go crawling on their on your belly the rest of your life he be eating the best day so much he was an upright man only his seat can mix with a human race and God allowed it that way they did that way but after the city constant say we find even today science is trying to mix human and animal see them another one they've tried it with everything else that missing link was a certain caste see now let's say they've got the wrong foot here so one word disbelief God prove it but then if you keep everywhere you Shalu they doubted one word rug dead to the human race I mentioned not love a bread loaf for his physical state but every word every word just the way certain and the Bible says if you have no private interpretation no manners anywhere any at all to try to interpret the Word of God God is his only temperature and how does he definitely what I'm making it come to pass place a lot so let us earth believe that now know as a little group I wonder how the past and manage of this big groups dancing and running around and everything else but are they paying attention to the world is a word preach that there was ketchup dancing and getting emotional on is gone but rock obama say we must stay with the word amen so blood sisters I don't know one day if I'm not here and your sugar can't be continued stay with that word today would that work if you want to make it on the other side stay with it would say whatever you know the promise of so many things but I'd closing right now he said so many things he said sometime a little chat will stop and the past a simple humble you know led by the Holy Spirit then the enemy will come and offering another position now I know what you small I'm gonna cover join our group you know and you'll be big and then here salary will reach ten times huh and he says it goes there and everything out said before you know it the enemy comes and they be defeated without stating the word but when they humble and support the shame of the world say but the enemy will come offer big things see that's how that's how the church will going to see they got deceived by getting into big things we're going to be big for God million more in 44 without the word plays wrong so how did he get overpowered and sent a nude or whether it's sacred go to the word Torah see Satan can quote the world see so don't let the this come this Satan they never become and white wash wash that word away see after all what the prophets of the bride is she's a word right amen okay so the word pride must be well thanks a lot so I prayed much bless us he was blessed just aim of the word and then we we may have faults and failures and always little thing this keep praying and pressing on breathe under the blood but stay with the word see it's not something now it you're coming against the word see something that is directly in line with the word then we better watch it see we love failures and folks and everything else but stay with the word amen we allow our faults and failure to the rapture and stay with that word God sees our heart Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary I play the wrong bless us Hey please look we understand with the word Amen six don't run for big things somebody stay so close not prepare me see the must be a population attended the bus
