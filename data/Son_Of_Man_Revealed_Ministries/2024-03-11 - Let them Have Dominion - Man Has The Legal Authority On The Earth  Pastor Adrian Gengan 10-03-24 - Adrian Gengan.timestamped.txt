[2:10] Jesus amen but that's our expectation
[2:13] yes amen it's what we expecting in this
[2:15] time in the season is to see our Lord
[2:17] Jesus amen the Bible says when we see
[2:20] him we shall be like him am amen
[2:23] hallelujah in his own image and his own
[2:26] likeness amen praise the Lord amen let's
[2:28] turn to the Book of Genesis amen we've
[2:30] been dealing with the Book of Genesis
[2:32] and looking at the origins of
[2:34] man amen for those of you who didn't
[2:36] come Wednesday night you need to listen
[2:38] to that sermon amen maybe you already
[2:40] did amen
[2:42] hallelujah so there's no excuse why we
[2:45] shouldn't be up to date with the sermons
[2:48] amen because for some reason you miss
[2:51] church you can always catch up with it
[2:54] amen hallelujah it's important for you
[2:56] to catch up because if God is doing
[2:58] something amen we need to be in
[3:00] alignment with it amen amen amen if you
[3:03] can say Amen to that if we are not in
[3:05] alignment with that we'll be walking not
[3:07] functioning as one body amen but we need
[3:10] to grow together amen hallelujah so
[3:12] Genesis chapter 1 we reading there verse
[3:16] 26
[3:27] amen and God said let us make make man
[3:30] in our image after our likeness and let
[3:34] them have dominion over the fish of the
[3:36] sea and over the foul of the air and
[3:39] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[3:42] and over every creeping thing that
[3:44] creepeth upon the
[3:46] Earth so first God speaks it and then in
[3:50] 27 he does it so God created man in his
[3:54] own image in the image of God created
[3:57] him male and female created he them amen
[4:02] the Lord had blessings to the reading of
[4:03] his word amen praise the Lord amen may
[4:07] be seated
[4:10] amen let's turn to Psalm amen we read
[4:13] this on Wednesday we'll read it again
[4:15] Psalm 115
[4:18] amen give you the scriptural backing so
[4:20] you know what we're talking about
[4:24] amen amen i' like to welcome you and uh
[4:27] also we have a visitor with us amen
[4:28] sister Rosa let's give a hand as we
[4:30] welcome up
[4:33] amen amen I believe uh brother Eric from
[4:36] Pastor Denzel's church is witnessing to
[4:37] her so she's here for Fellowship this
[4:39] morning pray amen the holy spirit will
[4:41] speak to you in some way amen hallelujah
[4:43] and I believe it's sister Michelle's
[4:45] birthday this morning let's give a hand
[4:46] let's thank the Lord amen wish you Happy
[4:49] Birthday the Lord continue to bless you
[4:51] and keep you amen so Psalm 115 verse 17
[4:55] or verse 16 says very important these
[4:58] scriptures now you got to make a note of
[5:00] these scriptures because this becomes
[5:02] your Source your
[5:04] Lifeline when you are challenged you
[5:06] quote back these scriptures yes that's
[5:08] right amen remember when Jesus was
[5:10] challenged he quoted back the scriptures
[5:12] so you got to know the word amen I know
[5:14] you have excellent memories but you need
[5:16] to carry your pen and your pages because
[5:18] there's so much coming out and you need
[5:20] to make notes of it amen so it says the
[5:22] heaven even the heavens are the Lords
[5:25] yes amen amen hallelujah yes but the
[5:29] Earth
[5:30] but changes it right but the
[5:33] Earth ha he given to the children of
[5:37] men amen that's straight in line now
[5:41] with Genesis 1:26 there now when he said
[5:43] let them have dominion amen amen amen I
[5:47] don't know if you can say Amen to that
[5:49] amen now there's a quote that John
[5:51] Wesley John Wesley and St
[5:54] Austine made the
[5:56] statement it says here now we read John
[6:00] Wesley it seems that without God man
[6:03] cannot right man cannot do anything on
[6:06] the earth without God but then he goes
[6:09] to say and without man God will
[6:13] not yes do anything on the earth amen
[6:17] amen I'll read it again it seems that
[6:19] without God man cannot and without man
[6:23] God will not St Augustine said the same
[6:26] thing amen he says without God we cannot
[6:30] without us God will not amen so we see
[6:34] that these men understood
[6:35] something and this is in line to when
[6:39] we're dealing with
[6:40] prayer amen it seems that God cannot and
[6:44] without man God will not what is meaning
[6:48] is that amen that man has the legal
[6:51] Authority on the
[6:52] Earthen amen amen yes so you find here
[6:57] when God is making that statement let
[6:59] let them have dominion what is he
[7:01] doing how many of you know that's a law
[7:04] oh yes thank you Lord that's a law set
[7:07] forth in the earth when God said let
[7:09] there be light amen when God created the
[7:12] heavens and the Earth he set all the
[7:13] laws in
[7:15] motion now when he creates the Earth and
[7:18] all of creation he needs to set a law on
[7:21] the
[7:22] earth and he says let them have
[7:26] dominion Hallelujah am amen praise the
[7:29] Lord
[7:29] so let us make man in our image is what
[7:33] God Said right everybody agree amen the
[7:36] word image does not mean look
[7:39] like God did not make you to look like
[7:43] him amen amen hallelujah yes the Hebrew
[7:47] word means
[7:50] characteristics
[7:52] amen let them have the same
[7:55] characteristics let them have the same
[7:56] qualities of God Amen I have given you
[8:00] God's character amen I made you just
[8:03] like Father God oh yes thank you Lord
[8:05] amen the qualities of God is in you amen
[8:09] every one of you you are God's
[8:12] image amen hallelujah amen amen tell
[8:15] somebody I'm I have the character of God
[8:18] I of amen hallelujah they're going to
[8:22] remind you next time you fight with them
[8:24] now amen praise the Lord I have the
[8:27] character of God amen so the qualities
[8:31] of God is in you every one of you you
[8:33] are in God's
[8:34] image so the word likeness so he says
[8:37] image and
[8:38] likeness amen the word likeness in
[8:41] Hebrew means to function
[8:46] like so let us make this
[8:49] man with the characteristics the
[8:52] nature the essence of God and let him
[8:55] function like God oh thank you amen
[9:00] amen that means you function like God
[9:02] your
[9:03] father amen hallelujah any man that does
[9:07] not function like God he is
[9:12] malfunctioning what is that if we detail
[9:14] it any man that doesn't have the
[9:16] character of God any man that doesn't
[9:18] have the nature of God the life of God
[9:22] Amen he's not functioning like God he is
[9:25] malfunctioning amen hallelujah fear is a
[9:28] sign that you are malfunctioning because
[9:31] that's not being like God Amen worry is
[9:34] a sign that you are
[9:35] malfunctioning having doubt and fear and
[9:38] anxiety is a sign that you are
[9:42] malfunctioning amen praise the
[9:44] Lord and we know that perfect love has
[9:47] come down in this age Amen to cast out
[9:50] all fear amen amen the Capstone of Love
[9:53] is come down Amen to to unite with the
[9:56] body amen hallelujah are we building up
[9:59] to that edstone hallelujah amen so we
[10:03] see amen we in a time and season where
[10:06] perfect love has come to cast out all
[10:07] fear amen if you have worry like we
[10:11] saying you're malfunctioning you need to
[10:12] cast all your cares upon Jesus because
[10:15] he cares for you the reason you are
[10:17] Contin continually in a cycle is because
[10:20] you are trying to control the
[10:23] situation after the humanistic realm
[10:26] amen amen hallelujah whatever you've
[10:29] been taught in this life has told you
[10:31] that you need to take control of the
[10:32] situation that you need to handle the
[10:34] situation and worrying about the
[10:36] situation will solve the
[10:39] problem amen one of you will never solve
[10:42] the problem hallelujah amen hallelujah
[10:45] you know our lord Jesus speaks about
[10:46] this amen hallelujah and he says that
[10:49] worrying won't solve the thing amen
[10:52] hallelujah he says amen why don't you
[10:54] cast all your cares upon Jesus he says
[10:57] seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[10:59] righteousness and all of these things
[11:01] shall be added unto you amen you see the
[11:04] the biggest hindrance to our prayers is
[11:06] worry and fear because that puts doubt
[11:09] in our heart how can we pray being
[11:12] worried and fearful and saying oh God
[11:14] but when you release it to God and say
[11:16] lord it's not mine in the first place I
[11:18] release it to you in Jesus name amen
[11:21] hallelujah so when we read there why did
[11:25] God create us what is our primary
[11:28] purpose that God created us for if I had
[11:31] to ask you the question of most people
[11:33] they'll say the primary purpose we were
[11:35] created is for worship yes amen right
[11:39] that's what most people will say but
[11:41] what is the Bible
[11:44] saying remember before you were created
[11:47] God had
[11:48] angels and were the Angels worshiping
[11:51] him so can we say the primary purpose
[11:53] for Angels is
[11:55] worship the primary purpose for man
[11:57] according to Genesis 1 is to have
[12:03] dominion you see Traditions have kept us
[12:06] in certain ideas and certain boxes yeah
[12:09] that you can only do this
[12:11] yes but the message of the hour is
[12:14] coming to restore you back to your full
[12:15] Dominion
[12:17] amen you know if God doesn't restore me
[12:20] back to everything that Adam was before
[12:22] the fall then his Redemption is in
[12:25] part so I'm expecting his Redemption to
[12:28] be the full restoration of everything
[12:30] that Adam lost can you agree with that
[12:33] amen hallelujah we can't we can't
[12:36] understand uh and believe that animal
[12:39] was a God man on the earth he could
[12:40] speak to the winds he could speak to the
[12:42] waves that God gave him dominion over
[12:44] the fish of the sea the fire of the air
[12:46] and all the Beast of the field and then
[12:48] we want to be inferior man after God has
[12:51] done
[12:51] Redemption after he paid the price to
[12:54] redeem us back to our original condition
[12:57] amen you see many of us want to leave
[12:58] leave it to after the Rapture we don't
[13:01] want to do anything on the earth we want
[13:04] God to do all the work on the Earth but
[13:06] I have news for you this morning God
[13:08] will do nothing on the earth except he
[13:10] is in cooperation with man even the
[13:13] Bible says in Amos 37 surely the Lord
[13:16] will do God will do nothing except he
[13:19] reveal his secrets to his servant the
[13:20] prophets amen
[13:23] amen amen so God created us our primary
[13:27] purpose is somebody said Dominion
[13:31] Dominion you must have dominion in every
[13:34] area of your life thank you Lord every
[13:37] area of your life you must have dominion
[13:40] you are the God man yes you are the god
[13:42] daughter amen amen you must have
[13:46] dominion praise the Lord when sickness
[13:48] comes in your life you must have
[13:50] dominion when Trouble Comes you must
[13:52] have dominion when Temptation come you
[13:54] must have dominion amen amen you must
[13:57] have dominion unemployment comes you
[14:00] must have
[14:01] dominion somebody say Amen release your
[14:04] faith this morning amen means to so be
[14:07] it I agree with it hallelujah amen
[14:11] praise the Lord amen Satan want to keep
[14:13] you bound now amen Satan don't want you
[14:15] to have your Liberty this morning but I
[14:17] tell you the spirit of God wants you to
[14:19] be free this morning amen hallelujah you
[14:22] see we put a limit to God when we we put
[14:25] limits when we say Amen that God's idea
[14:28] of us is just to worship Him amen yes we
[14:30] must worship Him God's idea of us is to
[14:34] come and pray before him yes we must
[14:36] pray before God Amen but that's not our
[14:38] primary purpose amen some people believe
[14:42] that the purpose is to have a title in
[14:44] the church to have a position in the
[14:45] church amen and traditions of men have
[14:48] kept us amen if you can become a deacon
[14:50] maybe you become a pastor maybe you
[14:52] become an evangelist maybe you hold some
[14:54] title in the church that gives you your
[14:56] worth I tell you your wor is in Christ
[14:58] amen amen your worth is to have dominion
[15:00] over the Earth am thank you Lord you may
[15:04] not have a single position in the church
[15:06] amen but you stand as a son and daughter
[15:08] of God and have
[15:10] dominion thank
[15:13] you amen hallelujah most of the time we
[15:16] in our positions and our our situations
[15:19] because of wrong confessions you go and
[15:21] analyze the words that are coming out of
[15:23] your mouth and you'll see you keep
[15:25] confessing the negative
[15:27] things amen for example if your child is
[15:30] a drug addict you continually saying and
[15:33] admitting your child is a drug addict is
[15:35] echoing words amen because your words
[15:37] have life and you are basically putting
[15:39] a label on them and you carry the
[15:41] authority in this hour and you have told
[15:43] them that they are an
[15:44] [Music]
[15:45] addict you need to speak a word to
[15:48] reverse it and tell them my child is a
[15:51] son of a king amen and my child is fully
[15:54] delivered my child is liberated amen
[15:57] amen Lord the word need to come from
[15:59] your
[16:00] mouth amen hallelujah God don't
[16:03] interfere in man's
[16:07] business without invitation am does he
[16:12] say in his word if my people who are
[16:14] called by my name what's his
[16:19] name will humble themselves and pray
[16:23] what is
[16:25] prayer amen hallelujah prayer is a
[16:29] petition amen hallelujah when you make a
[16:32] petition you're petitioning according to
[16:35] the
[16:35] law if we have a constitution you know
[16:38] you petition the government according to
[16:40] the
[16:41] Constitution now God has given us his
[16:45] Constitution amen amen so when we make
[16:48] our petition our prayers we are asking
[16:51] God to come and we are petitioning
[16:53] according to the word amen because the
[16:56] sickness is not in alignment with God's
[16:58] word word because the word says by the
[17:00] stripes of Jesus we were healed so we
[17:02] are petitioning and I authority to come
[17:05] to the Earth we are giving him authority
[17:07] to come and have access over that
[17:09] sickness and to Deliver Us from that
[17:11] sickness amen yes thank you thank
[17:16] am how many of you know that God does
[17:19] things on the earth without
[17:21] man yeah God just does things without
[17:25] man God in the beginning he he said let
[17:29] there be an
[17:30] ark and then he brought the
[17:33] floods and then he said let all the
[17:35] animals go into the ark and then all the
[17:37] animals ran into the ark and he said let
[17:40] eight men go into the
[17:43] ark God won't violate his own
[17:46] law when he said let them have dominion
[17:48] over the Earth he will not violate his
[17:51] own law yes Lord
[17:55] sir amen we may think nothing about the
[17:58] rules we face that we set up but God is
[18:02] governed by his own laws God is governed
[18:04] by his word yes God won't do anything
[18:07] outside of his word so for God to have
[18:10] legal Authority in your life you must
[18:12] give him permission am that is why God
[18:15] is Jesus is teaching us to pray Our
[18:18] Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy
[18:20] name thy kingdom come I'm inviting you
[18:23] bring the kingdom your will be done in
[18:25] my life on Earth as it is in heaven you
[18:28] are giving God
[18:30] permission how many times we heard the
[18:32] prophet say that the holy spirit is a
[18:34] gentleman he won't just budge into your
[18:36] life but you've got to welcome him into
[18:38] your life
[18:40] amen amen hallelujah amen praise the
[18:44] Lord so the word dominion in Hebrew
[18:46] means to rule let them have dominion let
[18:48] them
[18:49] rule over my kingdom on the earth amen
[18:53] hallelujah it means to govern to master
[18:56] every situation to manage the the
[18:58] Master's resources Amen to be a governor
[19:01] to be a ruler to be have control over
[19:04] all the animal life fish life plant life
[19:07] I have control over your flesh as well
[19:12] amen amen hallelujah yeah that a beast
[19:16] right here before you can control the
[19:18] fish control this
[19:19] flesh control this flesh amen hallelujah
[19:24] have dominion over this flesh hallelujah
[19:27] praise the Lord
[19:30] so the authority given to men is
[19:32] necessary to understand what we are
[19:34] restored
[19:35] to when God created the Earth he gave
[19:38] the legal Authority in the earth to
[19:41] man he didn't say let us have dominion
[19:45] he first said let us make man but he
[19:47] didn't go on to say let us have
[19:50] dominion he said let
[19:53] them let them have
[19:56] dominion amen amen hallelujah praise the
[20:00] Lord I'm trying to take away some
[20:01] Amnesia amen amen you came through amen
[20:04] a perverted birth amen you came through
[20:06] a fallen birth so you forgotten what you
[20:08] were made like amen but the Thunder is
[20:10] coming this time to take away your
[20:12] Amnesia to make you known that you are
[20:14] part of God that you are Eternal as God
[20:16] is eternal amen thank
[20:19] you thank you
[20:23] Lord if I want to make a wooden desk or
[20:27] wooden Pulpit I must go and take wood to
[20:29] make
[20:30] this right the designer knows what he
[20:33] wants to
[20:36] make the designer knows what he wants to
[20:38] make yes so if God is saying I want to
[20:42] make man in my image and after my
[20:45] likeness what material must he
[20:51] use I'm talking about Genesis 126
[20:54] now before God goes to the dust of the
[20:57] Earth yeah to make
[21:01] man he must use the same material of
[21:04] himself and God is spirit amuah and they
[21:09] that worship Him must worship Him in
[21:10] spirit amen and in truth yes Lord amen
[21:15] hallelujah so God goes to his own
[21:18] self and the spirit your original Spirit
[21:21] rotates off of
[21:23] God Amen Hallelujah and man becomes a
[21:27] living soul amen praise the Lord amen
[21:30] amen amen amen amen hallelujah you're
[21:32] saying you're repeating yourself every
[21:33] week amen you're not believing me every
[21:38] week amen repetition is good yes you
[21:42] know what happens when you repeat
[21:44] something I want you to get into your
[21:46] spirit where when you say it it doesn't
[21:48] even sound
[21:50] unusual amen praise the Lord amen amen
[21:53] so when God speaks his word it becomes
[21:55] law God gave man Dominion on the Earth
[21:58] what was he doing he was shifting over
[22:00] the control of the earth over to
[22:02] man amen let them have dominion praise
[22:06] the
[22:07] Lord so God made a spirit being out of
[22:10] himself he made listen what I'm saying
[22:13] now God made a spirit being called man
[22:15] out of himself and he put the spirit
[22:17] being into a dirt
[22:20] body and he formed you out of the ground
[22:23] and called it man and God gave authority
[22:25] in the earth to a spirit being living in
[22:27] a dirt body that is the law therefore it
[22:30] means that the only creatures that have
[22:32] legal right to function in the Earth
[22:35] with authority are spirits with a
[22:41] body God took the Genesis 12 126 man and
[22:44] he put that Spirit In The Genesis 2 man

[29:43] is God works
[29:45] through amen praise the Lord I'm glad
[29:47] you know that amen praise the Lord
[29:52] amen how many of you believe that so we
[29:56] said Spirit without a body is illegal
[30:00] and Powerless on the
[30:07] earth a spirit without a body is illegal
[30:10] and Powerless on the
[30:12] earth okay let's let's let's magnify
[30:15] that thought is God a spirit yes
[30:20] yes okay understand what I'm saying now
[30:23] is God a spirit yes who has he given
[30:27] legal Authority on the earth so in order
[30:30] to do anything on the earth who must he
[30:31] connect
[30:32] with and that is what prayer is doing
[30:35] telling him have the legal Authority and
[30:38] God has the power we have the authority
[30:42] come on now says we've got the authority
[30:45] he says we don't have the power but we
[30:47] have the authority so prayer is asking
[30:50] God to come in with your power and
[30:52] interfere in my life some of us don't
[30:55] want anyone to interfere in our lives
[30:57] but you say Lord come into fear in my
[31:00] life let's go to first quot and see what
[31:02] the prophet is saying so I'm telling you
[31:05] what about the Holy Spirit then can the
[31:08] Holy Spirit do something that you don't
[31:09] allow him to
[31:12] do so here the prophet is saying evil
[31:15] spirits when it's not inhabited in a
[31:17] human body is powerless seemingly right
[31:21] then in another quote here what he says
[31:22] now very striking you got to understand
[31:25] this because you can't be saying Lord
[31:28] help me help me help me but then you
[31:29] kick the holy spirit out the holy spirit
[31:32] is powerless without you giving him
[31:33] permission you're going to read this now
[31:36] we got the now in that man was some
[31:40] Spirits you we just referen this right
[31:42] the man that was
[31:44] possessed in that man were some spirits
[31:47] that was cast out of the swine in gadera
[31:49] some of those poor people out there in
[31:51] that insane institution beating the
[31:53] heads against ped bar cells remember
[31:56] Devils never die
[31:58] die Devils always live but there will be
[32:01] a time where Devils will have to die
[32:04] they will become totally annihilated but
[32:06] now they are alive and they work from
[32:08] generation to generation upon human
[32:11] beings some of them is in the form of
[32:14] cancer some of them in the form of
[32:16] epilepsy some of them in the form of
[32:18] tuberculosis they get into the flesh but
[32:21] seemingly they are powerless until they
[32:23] get into a person
[32:26] amen
[32:28] amen so sometimes when they tell you you
[32:30] have a symptom of something and you go
[32:32] around telling everyone I have this I
[32:33] have this you are giving them legal
[32:35] right to attach themselves to your
[32:38] body now here's the important part they
[32:41] have to operate through a person which
[32:43] brings another thought that the Holy
[32:46] Spirit covers the earth but is almost
[32:48] helpless until it gets into you and to
[32:51] me yes
[32:56] amen God is depending on you and I the
[33:00] Holy Spirit the Earth is full of the
[33:02] spirit of God but it's poured out but it
[33:06] cannot operate until it comes into us we
[33:08] human beings to
[33:11] operate
[33:12] amen now what man of people it would be
[33:15] to shut the holy spirit's
[33:19] move what caliber of people must it
[33:22] be to make the Holy Spirit
[33:25] powerless
[33:30] later
[33:36] here isn't that the condition latest
[33:38] here is in they shut out the spirit now
[33:41] I'm asking you let's leave later see I'm
[33:43] asking
[33:45] you how many times have you told the
[33:47] Holy Spirit come back some other
[33:49] time and need to do this I need to
[33:52] follow my own will my own ambition you
[33:55] make him powerless help us Lord yes how
[33:58] possible
[34:00] amen praise the Lord let's go to Matthew
[34:02] Matthew
[34:03] 15:38
[34:05] Amen Let let's hope I get the scripture
[34:07] right amen praise the Lord Matthew
[34:11] 15:38 so God is all powerful
[34:15] right oh sorry 13 this 1358 I think it
[34:23] is we know God is all powerful and he
[34:26] can do as he pleases will right listen
[34:28] to what Jesus could do and he did
[34:31] not many mighty works there because of
[34:36] there did Jesus the same one say all
[34:38] power in Heaven and Earth is given unto
[34:40] me so why didn't he go by his own
[34:43] authority and just say Okay healed
[34:44] healed healed healed what does he need
[34:46] cooperation of man through faith oh yes
[34:49] what does the scripture say he did not
[34:52] many mighty thing works there because of
[34:54] their unbelief amen so God can't work in
[34:58] your life because of unbelief the Holy
[35:00] Spirit cannot help you because you don't
[35:02] want to surrender to the Holy Spirit you
[35:05] make the Holy Spirit
[35:07] powerless amen praise the Lord
[35:09] hallelujah amen
[35:12] amen remember these keys are to build
[35:15] you
[35:16] up amen yes now the prophet goes on to
[35:21] say so he says the Holy Spirit cannot
[35:24] operate until it comes in us we human
[35:26] beings to operate
[35:27] and the devil wants to take us over to
[35:29] operate under him so when he gets the
[35:32] mild form he starts to sin if he can
[35:35] hold him just in a righteous man a good
[35:37] man and just let him go ahead and try to
[35:39] be good like that if he can get all of
[35:41] him like that until he's dead that's
[35:44] just what he wants to do he's got him
[35:46] you see Satan wants to hold you in that
[35:48] position of being a religious person a
[35:51] good person until you
[35:53] dead wants to get you off the Earth
[35:55] because he knows you have no legal
[35:57] Authority
[35:59] then so they oppress you enough to make
[36:02] you feel like you're
[36:03] religious make you feel like you're a
[36:05] good church
[36:07] member until you're
[36:10] dead amen you understanding the
[36:14] quote he's got him because no matter how
[36:17] righteous you are how good you are how
[36:19] moral you are how clean you are how
[36:21] honest you are you'll never get to
[36:22] Heaven until you are born again amen
[36:25] what was our quotes we were reading
[36:26] Hallelujah only seed can be reborn not
[36:30] everyone can be reborn amen right you've
[36:33] got to be born you've got to be
[36:35] regenerated or there's not a way in the
[36:37] world for you to ever enter Heaven or
[36:39] ever to come to Christ
[36:43] amen he says here in the message who is
[36:45] God I'm afraid that the church doesn't
[36:47] know their Authority I'm afraid that the
[36:49] Holy Ghost born men don't realize the
[36:51] Authority or the authority that God has
[36:53] permitted to his
[36:55] church I'll give you the keys to the
[36:57] kingdom whatever you bind on Earth will
[36:59] be bound in heaven amen whatever you
[37:02] loose will be Loos what is what is that
[37:05] stop there whatever you bind on Earth
[37:07] will be bound God is asking you
[37:11] permission but you possess the authority
[37:13] on the earth amen God is saying hey you
[37:17] that possess the authority bind loose
[37:21] and I come with my power and back it
[37:25] up
[37:27] I give you Powers over serpents and all
[37:29] kinds of diseases everything nothing
[37:31] shall harm you exercise your faith Let
[37:33] it Loose let God have his way God will
[37:36] grant it to you amen how many if you
[37:38] want to exercise that all right the next
[37:40] time you see a coage you go and exercise
[37:42] your authority over it thank you
[37:45] Jesus amen let's start
[37:49] small amen praise the Lord I have given
[37:52] you Authority praise the Lord amen let
[37:56] us make man in our image you are in the
[37:58] god image you are in his likeness amen
[38:01] hallelujah praise the Lord
[38:06] amen here in this next quote we're going
[38:08] to read in the unfailing realities of
[38:10] God just to reiterate this God always
[38:14] likes to work through men amen how many
[38:17] of you agree with that amen how many of
[38:19] you can say Amen to that amen praise the
[38:23] Lord God always likes to work through
[38:26] men
[38:28] it's God's program to work through men
[38:31] do you believe that congregation says
[38:34] amen God works through man he made man
[38:37] his helper on Earth he made man a Lesser
[38:40] God than himself
[38:42] amen now we've been through that in the
[38:45] teaching lately in Genesis 1: 126 when
[38:47] he was El Ella Elohim the alls
[38:49] sufficient self-existing one and then in
[38:53] was attributes of the father son Holy
[38:55] Spirit not three God
[38:57] three officers in him that he was able
[39:00] to live in those dispensations he was a
[39:02] savior he was a king he was a God all
[39:05] these things displayed the selves it's
[39:08] the attributes of God and when God made
[39:11] man in his own image he put him on Earth
[39:13] as a Lesser God Jesus declared it when
[39:16] he said is it not written in your laws
[39:18] that you are
[39:19] Gods amen and if he called those Gods
[39:22] who whose the word of God came come to
[39:24] which are the prophets how can you
[39:27] condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God
[39:29] he
[39:30] said they just couldn't understand it
[39:33] but man was put here with a dominion
[39:36] over the Earth he had everything under
[39:38] his control amen what Adam lost Jesus
[39:41] proved he had restored amen he stopped
[39:45] nature he raised the dead he done
[39:48] everything and the world is groan today
[39:51] the Bible said for the manifestation of
[39:53] the sons of God for God to get into his
[39:56] sh children again in realities to make
[39:59] things real amen
[40:04] amen and it stumbles the
[40:07] people you see here 10th of March God is
[40:10] trying to get the reality back into
[40:12] you amen hallelujah God is trying to get
[40:15] the reality back into you you have legal
[40:18] Authority on the earth amen praise the
[40:21] Lord now if Satan can't keep the truth
[40:25] from them he makes Fanatics out of them
[40:28] you see so you can go off on the Other
[40:30] Extreme as well so what is Satan's first
[40:32] goal to keep the truth away from
[40:35] you because he knows if you get the true
[40:38] Revelation he'll be
[40:40] powerless that's the quote so what's he
[40:43] saying here now if he can't keep the
[40:45] truth away from you did he keep the
[40:47] truth away from you somebody said
[40:52] no
[40:54] amen so then he makes Fanatics out of
[40:58] them throw them off on this side and
[41:00] that side and they get all kind of stuff
[41:02] the Bloods and oil sensation which is
[41:04] not even
[41:08] scriptural God has to find somebody he
[41:11] can
[41:12] trust ask yourself can God trust
[41:15] you amen ask yourself now can God trust
[41:18] me somebody there that he can have
[41:20] confidence in can have confidence in God
[41:23] that can believe
[41:25] him go has to find somebody he can put
[41:27] his confidence in and when he finds such
[41:30] a man are you such a one this morning
[41:32] amen has God found you this
[41:35] morning when God finds such a man he can
[41:37] put his confidence and his power in a
[41:40] man that will follow the road that will
[41:42] stay right on the map go right until
[41:44] until he comes to the place of power
[41:46] faith will lead him to that because he's
[41:48] got faith in the word it will lead him
[41:50] to the promise he lead him to power the
[41:52] power will lead him to the promise
[41:55] amen
[41:57] going to reiterate this now Hallelujah
[42:00] and now man was God's subject man is
[42:03] what God works
[42:11] through so if you are praying and asking
[42:14] God for
[42:19] something let's believe the quote
[42:22] now who's God going to work
[42:25] through
[42:28] oh but then now I I don't like my
[42:32] pastor you saying Lord speak to me speak
[42:35] to me now he's speaking to the pastor
[42:36] and you don't like the
[42:38] pastor but who God works
[42:41] through so if you are rejecting the
[42:43] answer coming from the five-fold who are
[42:46] you really
[42:47] rejecting because God works through amen
[42:51] if you are sick the Bible says call the
[42:53] Elders of the church let them anoint you
[42:55] with oil let them lay hands on you and
[42:57] pray if that is God's answer in the
[43:00] Bible and you don't exercise that and
[43:03] you're saying God you're not answering
[43:04] my prayer you're not answering my prayer
[43:06] God will only walk through his word
[43:09] amen God saying I already gave you the
[43:13] answer amen then you know in Mark 11:23
[43:16] he says if you say to a situation be th
[43:18] removed be th cast into the sea don't
[43:21] doubt in your heart but believe the
[43:23] words that you have said you can have
[43:25] what you have said
[43:28] yes you see most of us don't have a
[43:31] problem with speaking and asking the
[43:33] problem is with believing our words
[43:35] because as time the time delay we don't
[43:39] get the answer when we see it unbelief
[43:41] set in reason set in doubt set in and
[43:44] then remember it must be according to
[43:46] God's time in season too your prayer is
[43:48] correct maybe your faith is correct but
[43:50] you got to wait for the time and season
[43:52] and until it opens up to you you got to
[43:55] remain faithful
[43:59] yes it took a man that know something
[44:01] about supernatural but God has such a
[44:04] man thank the Lord for that God has
[44:06] always got somebody he always has he had
[44:09] a man that could put his hands on aren't
[44:11] you glad that God got you in this hour
[44:14] the prophet is saying God always has a
[44:15] man God always has somebody so you are
[44:19] that somebody that God has this
[44:22] time amen praise the Lord praise the
[44:25] Lord now you know in Exodus
[44:28] there in the book of
[44:31] Exodus I told you God always connects
[44:33] with man
[44:35] right in the book of Exodus I think it's
[44:37] chapter
[44:39] 3 just want to read the opening uh
[44:43] scripture there opening verse amen you
[44:47] can throw it up on the screen as well
[44:49] amen praise the
[44:54] Lord
[44:56] so we see in Exodus 3 what happens Moses
[44:59] meets the pillar of
[45:02] fire right I'm trying to show you now
[45:05] that God wanted to work through Moses
[45:08] but what happened with
[45:10] Moses he slew the Egyptian because he
[45:13] moved out of God's time in season and
[45:16] then he ran away to the
[45:21] desert right pay attention now because
[45:23] you're going to benefit from this
[45:25] because because even though you may fall
[45:28] even though you may mess up even though
[45:30] you may be God of God's time and season
[45:33] God won't change the
[45:36] man amen thank you Lord God will wait
[45:40] for you amen oh somebody amen yes God's
[45:44] not going to discard you yes amen
[45:46] because of your faults and failures yes
[45:49] amen you are predestined for this hour
[45:52] hallelujah thank
[45:53] you thank you
[45:58] amen praise the
[46:00] Lord so here in Exodus chapter 3 at
[46:04] chapter 3 you'll see
[46:05] uh when Moses sees the bush right just
[46:10] want to read verse two because this is
[46:12] also important most people concentrate
[46:14] on the burning bush everybody agree that
[46:16] Moses saw a burning bush but most people
[46:19] don't even quote it the right way and
[46:21] here in verse two you'll read read it
[46:23] the right way and the angel of the Lord
[46:26] amen appeared unto him in a flame of
[46:29] fire yes so that was the angel of the
[46:32] Lord in the bush that is why the bush
[46:34] didn't
[46:36] burn Hallelujah the angel of the Lord
[46:40] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[46:42] of the midst of a bush and he looked and
[46:45] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[46:46] Bush was not
[46:49] consumed oh the devil better be wary
[46:52] amen because the angel of God walks with
[46:54] us the angel of God is here with us amen
[46:58] amen amen he's a consuming
[47:00] fire you know Satan is terrified of
[47:03] you thank you amen he's only acting like
[47:08] he's not scared of you but if you only
[47:11] recognize who you are as a son and
[47:12] daughter of God Satan is terrified of
[47:14] you
[47:16] am amen
[47:18] hallelujah praise the Lord now here very
[47:22] important I'm trying to get to is verse
[47:24] seven
[47:30] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[47:32] Affliction of my people who are in Egypt
[47:34] and I've heard they cry by reason of
[47:36] their task Masters for I know their
[47:38] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[47:41] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[47:43] and to bring them up out of the land
[47:45] unto a good land unto a large and land
[47:48] flowing with milk and Hy unto the place
[47:50] of the
[47:51] ites amorites perizzites evites and
[47:54] jebusites and Moses clapped his hand and
[47:57] said yes Lord go ahead and do it yay
[48:00] you're going to come and deliver
[48:04] them Moses yes Lord you what is God
[48:08] saying I am come down to do this
[48:11] yes but who has the legal Authority on
[48:13] the
[48:16] earth so he's trying to connect with the
[48:19] man amen will use his voice
[48:24] yes
[48:26] because God got the
[48:28] power but he needs a man yes to speak
[48:35] amen I come down to deliver them I'm
[48:38] going to lead you to this
[48:40] land so Moses could said yes brilliant
[48:43] plan Lord I'm going to sit back and
[48:46] watch you do
[48:47] it very next verse now says now
[48:51] therefore oh sorry where am I
[48:54] yeah verse 10 let's go to verse 10 come
[48:57] now so God just told him I'm going to do
[49:00] it then he says come
[49:03] now therefore and I will send thee
[49:07] amen
[49:09] amen I will send
[49:12] thee to Pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[49:15] forth my people the children of Israel
[49:19] out of Egypt
[49:21] amen God in Moses Hallelujah yes God in
[49:29] Moses praise the Lord how many of you
[49:31] identify this is the first Exodus what
[49:32] we reading it's the first Exodus right I
[49:36] don't have time to preach this at length
[49:37] now I need to jump quickly here now amen
[49:39] praise the Lord amen okay let me give
[49:42] you all three Exodus while we here first
[49:44] Exodus he comes and he connects with a
[49:46] man amen now in order to fulfill and
[49:49] bring remember God wants to have the
[49:52] authority on the Earth but he can't do
[49:54] it without a body on the Earth Earth so
[49:56] what he couldn't fully Express his
[49:58] attributes now through all the prophets
[50:00] because they were Fallen men so he
[50:02] creates a body you know the Bible says
[50:04] the word became flesh amen and dwelt
[50:07] amongst
[50:08] us so God creates himself a body and he
[50:12] comes and he lives in that body amen
[50:14] everybody agree amen am so that he can
[50:17] have the legal Authority now now you
[50:19] don't have to rely on the
[50:21] prophets he's got a son on the earth
[50:24] amen perfect one one who didn't come by
[50:27] six birth one who didn't come by the
[50:30] Fall one is a perfect man on the earth
[50:33] so this man has Authority now God can do
[50:35] what he wants amen come on now somebody
[50:38] amen understand what I'm saying God
[50:41] don't have to beg men
[50:43] now because God now has a body on the
[50:45] earth
[50:48] am sir but now before the body
[50:52] came there are certain scriptures that
[50:54] must come to pass
[50:56] amen like Isaiah 7 a virgin must
[51:01] conceive so the angel comes to
[51:04] Mary and he tells
[51:07] Mary th are highly
[51:10] favored and he wants to make that
[51:12] scripture come to
[51:15] pass but a you a man on the earth the
[51:20] woman must give him legal
[51:24] Authority
[51:27] amen everybody understand what I'm
[51:29] saying he wants to bring his word to
[51:31] pass it's time for Jesus to be born but
[51:35] he must connect with somebody on the
[51:37] earth who opens up and gives him that
[51:40] legal Authority amen hallelujah
[51:44] amen and you'll find here that Mary says
[51:47] behold the handmaid of the Lord be it
[51:50] unto me according to Thy word amen and
[51:54] the angel Departed from her all he was
[51:57] waiting for was to give him the
[52:02] authority what was she saying use my
[52:04] whom
[52:06] amen gave him the authority and the
[52:09] angel of the Lord departs to go and
[52:11] bring forth the word so that the
[52:13] scripture can come to
[52:15] life so if in the first Exodus God had
[52:18] to connect with Moses to deliver the
[52:21] people the second Exodus he connects
[52:23] with Mary to bring forth Jesus amen amen
[52:28] in the Third Exodus he comes down in a
[52:30] cave amen amen and he says I come to
[52:34] tell you you're strange and
[52:35] misunderstood life amen amen I've come
[52:38] to tell you that you are take a a
[52:40] message of healing to the Nations as
[52:42] Moses was given two signs you shall be
[52:44] given two signs amen oh isn't this a
[52:48] perfect message amen he needs to connect
[52:50] with a man on the
[52:53] earth and what does the problem Prophet
[52:55] say the prophet is just like Moses oh I
[52:58] can't speak I can't do this I can't do
[53:01] that if you go read Exodus there two
[53:03] chapters the Lord is debating with Moses
[53:06] here how he can't do this and how he
[53:08] can't do that God is not worried about
[53:11] your
[53:12] incapabilities or how you see yourself
[53:15] God will use you whatever you give to
[53:17] him amen and remember God shows you
[53:20] knowing how you were
[53:21] made God knew that Moses was a stamer
[53:25] God knew that Moses amen couldn't do
[53:27] certain things in his own strength but
[53:29] God that was God's chosen vessel don't
[53:31] let people look down upon you you are
[53:33] God's chosen vessel in this time amen
[53:36] amen thank you Lord praise the Lord
[53:40] praise the Lord thank you amen
[53:43] hallelujah praise the Lord so what
[53:45] happens here
[53:47] now
[53:52] Hallelujah so I showed you all three
[53:54] Exodus how he needs to connect with men
[53:57] of the earth to bring about the
[54:00] Exodus but here now going back to the
[54:02] story about
[54:03] Exodus there's an army coming after them
[54:06] I'm just trying to encourage you this
[54:07] morning here now there's an army coming
[54:10] after them after they leave Egypt
[54:11] everybody
[54:13] agree
[54:16] right now why do they leave Exodus
[54:19] because of the plagues Egypt Pharaoh
[54:22] allowed them to go because of the
[54:24] plagues
[54:26] now did God say Let There Be
[54:28] flies let the water turn to blood Let
[54:32] There Be frogs did God said
[54:34] it or did he use the legal Authority on
[54:36] the earth
[54:38] amen God used the legal Authority on the
[54:41] earth and Moses said let there be flies
[54:44] and let the water turn to blood and
[54:48] let you exercise it didn't Jesus say by
[54:52] the confession of your mouth Romans 10
[54:55] 19 amen if you believe in your heart
[54:57] confess with your mouth yes you shall be
[55:00] saved doesn't the Bible say death and
[55:03] life lie in the power of your tongue yes
[55:05] the legal Authority is in Man's Tongue
[55:08] amen so we can't be mute people we can't
[55:10] be quiet people yes amen we ought to
[55:12] know who we are we ought to speak what
[55:14] we want amen come on now people amen we
[55:18] need to speak what we want speak what we
[55:20] want to see the situation how we want it
[55:22] to be I'm speaking I'm speaking under
[55:25] legal Authority amen so we find here
[55:28] that after God uses Moses mouth to speak
[55:31] because remember he needs a legal
[55:32] Authority for his power to be displayed
[55:36] I hope that's being made clear to you
[55:37] amen praise the Lord now he comes and if
[55:40] you read here Amen in the book of
[55:43] Exodus they come to the Red
[55:47] Sea and they are basically trapped up
[55:50] because the sea is before them and
[55:51] Pharaoh's armies are behind
[55:54] them
[55:55] right now Moses does something
[55:59] here amen Moses does
[56:03] something just want to get to
[56:08] it praise the
[56:10] [Music]
[56:13] Lord in chapter
[56:15] 14 praise the
[56:22] Lord chapter 14 you got it Exodus CH 14

[56:28] context so now they're trapped they're
[56:30] surrounded the armies behind them the
[56:32] Seas before
[56:34] them is it
[56:36] not is not this the word that we did
[56:39] tell the in Egypt saying let us alone
[56:41] that we may serve the Egyptians for it
[56:43] had been better for us to serve the
[56:44] Egyptians than we should we should die
[56:46] in the wilderness now the people start
[56:48] to
[56:49] murmur now watch what Moses
[56:52] says and Moses said unto the people
[56:54] people fear not amen stand still and see
[56:59] the salvation of the Lord amen which he
[57:03] will show to you
[57:05] today for the Egyptians whom you have
[57:08] seen today you shall see them again no
[57:11] more forever amen amen hallelujah the
[57:16] one with the legal Authority starts to
[57:18] make a confession
[57:22] yes he goes on to say the Lord shall
[57:25] fight for you and you shall hold your
[57:29] peace now after he makes his
[57:32] declaration I want you to read in
[57:34] between the lines here now because
[57:36] you'll see the very next verse there
[57:37] it's saying that the Lord said the Lord
[57:40] is answering Moses which means after
[57:43] Moses makes this
[57:45] declaration Moses goes to God you heard
[57:49] the boss I just made there

[59:41] around they see Pharaoh and the Army
[59:44] advancing why the sea is
[59:48] open does God close the
[59:52] sea God now needs a legal Authority

[1:03:11] Constitution because it's in God's word
[1:03:13] he must bring it to pass amen the
[1:03:16] prophet of God will go on to say anytime
[1:03:17] the word of God is believed the same way
[1:03:20] in the right condition the right
[1:03:21] atmosphere in the same way same faith

[1:04:20] earth amen amen how many of you want to
[1:04:23] say Lord May in the past I haven't
[1:04:25] exercised my legal Authority because I
[1:04:27] didn't recognize who I am I thought I'm
[1:04:29] born through uh through naida
[1:04:32] and whatever your surname is and I was
[1:04:36] just born to live a life get married
[1:04:38] have children go to the
[1:04:41] Grave I I don't see myself as quickening
[1:04:44] any scriptures I'm going to close with
[1:04:46] this
[1:04:47] now there's a promise in Revelation
[1:04:51] 10 somebody's bringing back the Le legal
[1:04:54] authority to the Earth the mighty
[1:04:57] Angel man's legal authority to have
[1:05:00] dominion over the

[1:05:40] authority to go and take the book amen

[1:06:00] did the Lord say I have come down to
[1:06:02] deliver the
