[0:00] Amen. To worship him and give him
[0:02] praise. Amen. So I'd like to welcome
[0:04] every one of you in the house of the
[0:05] Lord. Amen. Our visitors especially.
[0:07] Amen. Brother Nolan and Sister Bunnies
[0:09] are no strangers to us. Amen. You know,
[0:12] Brother Nolan, you take children for
[0:13] excursion, right? So you must tell them
[0:17] you brought them to excursion to show
[0:19] them where you grew up,
[0:20] &gt;&gt; in which church you grew up.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Nolan is a son of this
[0:24] ministry.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lovely brother. Amen. Always a
[0:28] pleasant spirit. Amen. And he's serving
[0:30] the Lord out there ever since he got
[0:32] married. But you know, we got a custom
[0:34] that with the girls follow the guys.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. But Nolan got
[0:40] away.
[0:41] But we're happy to see him here this
[0:42] morning. Amen. Together with his family.
[0:44] And it's good to see. Amen. People you
[0:46] grew up with still serving the Lord in
[0:48] the message and now imparting it on to
[0:50] the next generation. Amen. Looking at
[0:52] Sister Esther there, I was reminded that
[0:55] when Sister Bernice was that age, she
[0:56] was also singing. Amen. So we you know
[0:58] what the Lord told about Abraham. I know
[1:00] him that he will raise his children
[1:02] right. He will teach them the ways of
[1:04] the Lord. We're thankful. Amen. That
[1:05] they in fellowship with us this morning.
[1:07] We love them. We appreciate them. Amen.
[1:11] Also, Amen. I keep forgetting our
[1:12] sister's name. Is it uh
[1:17] add a line? What you said?
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Am I saying it right?
[1:23] &gt;&gt; All right. Go. Let's welcome her as
[1:26] well. Give her a hand. Amen. Praise the
[1:27] Lord.
[1:29] Hallelujah. Amen. I pray you'll be
[1:31] blessed in the house of the Lord. Let's
[1:32] read our scripture then you can get
[1:33] seated. Amen. So last week we were
[1:35] looking at that Jesus was the door and
[1:38] we needed a key to open the door.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we found that revelation is
[1:42] the key to open the door to Jesus.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; And we found that this door wasn't just
[1:47] an ordinary door in Revelation 10:7. It
[1:49] was a door to marriage.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what the Elisa ministry
[1:55] came to unite us with Christ. Amen. So
[1:58] we just want to bless his name. Let's
[2:00] turn to John chapter 14. Maybe we'll
[2:02] read verse 20 there and then you can be
[2:04] seated. Amen.
[2:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:13] So the Lord Jesus now is fixing to leave
[2:18] and he's giving a word of comfort to the
[2:20] people to his disciples. Amen. If we
[2:23] want to get context, let's read from
[2:25] verse 16 and we'll see what our Lord is
[2:27] saying here. He says, "I will pray the
[2:30] father. He will give you another
[2:31] comforter."
[2:33] So I am one door. Jesus is the door.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to open up another door to
[2:38] you.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you another comforter.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; That he may abide with you forever.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Even the spirit of truth whom the
[2:49] world cannot receive
[2:53] because it seeth him not
[2:56] &gt;&gt; neither knoweth him. So this comforter
[2:59] that's coming is not an ordinary message
[3:02] for the outside world.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; He's saying the world cannot receive
[3:06] him.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Neither because it seeth him not. So
[3:10] which means that we got to have a
[3:11] spiritual eye to see him
[3:13] &gt;&gt; because they won't see him but we'll see
[3:14] him.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Neither knoweth him, but you know
[3:18] him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall
[3:21] be where?
[3:22] &gt;&gt; In you.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Where is he?
[3:28] &gt;&gt; He is in you.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[3:33] come to you.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet a little while, this is the
[3:37] verse I want to get to now from 19:20.
[3:40] Yet a little while and the world seeth
[3:42] me no more but you shall see me because
[3:44] I live you shall live also. Now main
[3:48] verse at that day this day
[3:52] &gt;&gt; after seven church ages after
[3:54] denominational ages have run out. At
[3:56] that day you shall know that I am in my
[3:58] father.
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; You in me
[4:01] &gt;&gt; and I in you.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Meaning the complete mystery of
[4:04] God would be finished.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; And the complete marriage would have
[4:08] taken place
[4:09] &gt;&gt; because that is an intertwined between
[4:11] God and man.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; It says I am in my father, you in me,
[4:15] and I in you. The Lord a blessing to the
[4:17] reading of his word. You may be seated.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:23] So I just want to uh tie this quickly
[4:26] because sometimes we preach things and
[4:28] some people want to see the scriptural
[4:29] evidence of it. So if you go to
[4:31] Revelation 22 and verse 17, I was trying
[4:34] to show you this and I was speaking
[4:36] about it even on Wednesday when 17 Amen.
[4:40] where when the Lord here is writing in
[4:42] the book he says the spirit and the
[4:45] bride say come and I was trying to show
[4:48] you that it's not a spirit somewhere
[4:50] else and the bride somewhere else and
[4:52] two voices.
[4:55] The spirit is in the bride.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:00] Hallelujah. Can you say amen?
[5:02] &gt;&gt; When the when the Bible is saying and
[5:04] the spirit and the bride say come,
[5:07] &gt;&gt; the spirit at that time will be in the
[5:09] bride.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to give you the scripture.
[5:12] We just read it. So he's saying the
[5:13] spirit and the bride are saying come.
[5:15] Not two different voices, but the spirit
[5:18] is in the bride. Tabernacle in the
[5:20] bride.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; If you go back to St. John 14 and verse
[5:23] 17, same verse 17, you'll see what our
[5:26] Lord Jesus is saying there. We just read
[5:29] it now.
[5:31] Amen. In verse 17, he's saying, "Even
[5:33] the Spirit of truth, whom the world
[5:35] cannot receive because it seeth him not,
[5:37] neither knoweth him, but you know him,
[5:39] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[5:41] you."
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:43] &gt;&gt; So, I'm bringing there 14:17 and
[5:46] Revelation 22:17 to show you it's not
[5:49] two different voices on the earth. Yeah.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; And for the first time
[5:53] &gt;&gt; since the fall,
[5:55] &gt;&gt; God can come down in the cool of the day
[5:58] and he don't have to be looking for his
[6:00] son and his daughter.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because every evening in the in
[6:04] the cool of the day, the Lord would come
[6:05] down in the garden of Eden and he would
[6:08] have fellowship with his sons and his
[6:09] daughters.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; They would not Amen. would not run away
[6:12] or not ive
[6:14] &gt;&gt; because they were not in a fallen
[6:15] condition. Now we find in Revelation
[6:18] 22:17, for the first time, man is fully
[6:21] restored on the earth and he can now say
[6:23] to the father, "Come."
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; So, amen. Getting to our morning topic
[6:32] this morning. I want to tell you that
[6:35] there are some things that God had
[6:37] designed in his thoughts and his
[6:38] attributes
[6:40] that can be only expressed through you
[6:42] and I.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[6:45] God destined it that way.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That's right.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was for ordained from before
[6:51] the foundation of the world.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; You can't force God to do things that
[6:55] were meant for you and I to do.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; What God wanted to do through Jesus
[7:02] Christ, he has fully done it.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Now, we still when God is now working
[7:09] through his bride, he wants to have the
[7:11] preeminence through his bride. We want
[7:13] God to come and do it. But that was was
[7:15] not what was in the back part of God's
[7:17] mind.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; So we can't force God to do things that
[7:20] was meant for you and I to do.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Everything that was meant to do that God
[7:27] wanted to do, he did it through Jesus
[7:29] Christ.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; For his part,
[7:31] &gt;&gt; for the male part,
[7:33] &gt;&gt; but when it comes to the female part,
[7:35] there's an expression, a feminine
[7:37] expression that God wants to do through
[7:39] you and I.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; So when the bridegroom cometh, he opens
[7:46] the door in Matthew 25:10. If you put it
[7:49] up there, you'll see we are living in a
[7:51] time and season where we can't call
[7:53] ourselves wise virgins.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't let me shock your theology
[7:58] again. We've been through this for the
[7:59] year. We're speaking about the opening
[8:00] of dimensional doors this year.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; What did he do here? And while the bride
[8:06] went to buy, the bridegroom came and
[8:08] that they that were ready went in with
[8:11] him to the marriage and the door was
[8:13] shut.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; You are not going to the marriage after
[8:18] the rapture. The marriage takes place
[8:20] here on earth now.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that?
[8:24] &gt;&gt; We are going to the marriage supper.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; So which means the wise virgins Jesus
[8:28] has opened the door to them to a
[8:30] marriage.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; And they have gone in with him for the
[8:33] marriage.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; I'll bring a further clarity to that. If
[8:39] you believe you're a wise virgin
[8:40] carrying oil in Leos here, then you're
[8:42] still in the second court.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Because even the wise virgin said, "We
[8:51] can't give you some of this oil less we
[8:52] run out."
[8:53] &gt;&gt; They knew if they stayed outside of the
[8:55] door, that oil was eventually going to
[8:57] run out.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if you take the tabernacles
[9:01] and the three courts, on the outside
[9:03] they had natural light.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; On the inner court they had candlestick
[9:07] light, seven church age light.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; But in the holiest of holies
[9:12] &gt;&gt; is where the bride is now shutting with
[9:14] God where you don't need candle light,
[9:17] you don't need lamp light, but you got
[9:19] shakana glory light.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; So if somebody asked you, are you wise
[9:26] virgin? No. How can you be a virgin and
[9:28] be married? Amen.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Something wrong with you.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; You're married to the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:36] and you claiming to be a wise virgin
[9:38] walking with oil in your lamp. There's
[9:39] something wrong with you.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Which means now remember the marriage
[9:44] was typed out in the Eastern culture.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Now when somebody was married,
[9:51] &gt;&gt; the marriage was only
[9:54] regarded as marriage truly married
[9:56] because after the vows were taken
[9:59] There was a tent
[10:02] &gt;&gt; where the bride and the groom had to go
[10:04] into
[10:05] &gt;&gt; and consummate the marriage
[10:07] &gt;&gt; before the marriage feast.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. We mustn't get it confused with
[10:11] our western way of doing things.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; They were testing two things.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Whether she would be submissive and give
[10:18] herself to her husband.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; And they were also testing for a virgin.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Because if she was found not to be a
[10:25] virgin, then marriage was announced.
[10:27] Yes.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; And the woman has put away.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; We can't be reading the Bible with our
[10:34] western weddings.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have honeymoon after the
[10:38] wedding uh celebration after eating.
[10:42] Praise the Lord. Here they had honeymoon
[10:44] first.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Because they want to test if this is a
[10:47] royal woman.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have progressed in time.
[10:54] We can't be calling ourselves wise
[10:56] virgins. We were the wise virgins. Just
[10:58] like our one time we were the church.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; But in the first year, brother Brandham
[11:03] changes our position from church and he
[11:05] says, "I no longer call you church, but
[11:07] I call you bride."
[11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; So as bride, you can still be a virgin.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; As bride because you come in now, they
[11:18] make
[11:19] [Music]
[11:23] &gt;&gt; they bring you down to the altar
[11:25] &gt;&gt; to be married to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[11:28] But there after you say your vows, what
[11:30] do they say? I now present you husband
[11:32] and
[11:33] &gt;&gt; wife.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; Your title change immediately from bride
[11:37] to wife.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Because as bride you are at low
[11:42] inheritance.
[11:44] As bride, you don't have the name yet.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Only as wife, you take on the name.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't want to be
[11:51] staying on this too long. You know,
[11:52] we've been through this. Amen. Through
[11:54] the months now, but I just want to hit
[11:56] the highlights of this. When they when
[11:58] you are leaving there, you are leaving
[12:00] as Mr. and Mrs.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; So, you can't say that you are now the
[12:06] bride of Christ. You are now the wife.
[12:08] You are the married wife. Amen.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; And we took you through the quotes and
[12:13] he showed you why Adam was given a wife
[12:15] is to reproduce his own life.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "Every man is given a bride to
[12:20] reproduce himself."
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Adam was given a wife to reproduce
[12:25] himself.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; So woman who doesn't want to go into a
[12:30] husband and bring forth his seed is not
[12:33] in oneness with him.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:38] So here you can find Jesus opening up
[12:41] the door to the marriage and the door
[12:43] was shut.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; So there's a door open to the bride
[12:51] which we have come into. Amen. We have
[12:54] come into this door now. So like I'm
[12:57] saying there are some things that God
[12:58] wants to do through the bride. So when
[13:00] the bridegroom cometh, he opens the
[13:02] door. What is he doing? Revealing
[13:04] himself. That's what Revelation 10:7 is
[13:06] all about. He is revealing himself when
[13:08] the mystery of God is being revealed.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; The opening of the door is the
[13:13] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it doing? Opening is
[13:18] revealing Christ in bright form. Now,
[13:21] Christ in white form, Christ in sons and
[13:24] daughters. So, opening is equal to
[13:26] revealing.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; When is this door being opened? At the
[13:30] opening of the seventh seal. Now,
[13:32] brother Brandham says that if I am
[13:34] fixing to do anything, I know better
[13:36] than to speak it out aloud.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; He says because Satan will try and cut
[13:42] me off at every corner from me achieving
[13:44] what I need to achieve.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Distract me that the prophet is now
[13:51] having a 10th vision
[13:53] and he's speaking it out aloud
[13:55] everywhere.
[14:01] He's speaking it out aloud.
[14:04] He speaks about a brown bear. He's
[14:05] speaking it out aloud.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; I wonder when to cut it off.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; But in the seventh seal, he tells us,
[14:12] "If I'm fixing to do anything, I rather
[14:15] not speak it."
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Now, you know why the seventh seal is in
[14:21] silence? Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Because there are certain things that
[14:24] God is going to do
[14:26] &gt;&gt; that Satan can't interfere with.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; But it's only the the participants that
[14:33] will know.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; What's happening?
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; So we know that the door opens to a
[14:41] kingdom.
[14:43] Amen.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; When Jesus is saying, "Seek you first
[14:45] the kingdom,"
[14:47] we know that you need a key. And we know
[14:50] that the key is revelation.
[14:53] Hallelujah.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; So when where we we normally advise the
[14:56] young people, seek ye first the kingdom
[14:58] of God and his righteousness. But if you
[15:00] don't know what the key is to unlock the
[15:02] kingdom, how you going to open it up? So
[15:05] the key is revelation.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; The key is understanding.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Then you start to unlock the blessings
[15:12] of God for your life.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Now we know that this kingdom that we
[15:19] are in has no geographical borders. It's
[15:21] a spiritual kingdom.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every kingdom has a king and
[15:25] our king is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; Now we find here I want to take maybe
[15:33] the type of uh Esther in the Bible.
[15:36] Amen. The song you sang this morning,
[15:38] sister Bernice, was very apt and
[15:40] appropriate for this morning message.
[15:42] Amen. Because there are certain things
[15:44] that he can only do through the bride.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:49] Now I want to ask you
[15:52] if you're looking at the book of Esther
[15:55] when the king had displayed his entire
[15:58] glory of the kingdom and everything.
[16:01] Amen.
[16:04] There was one thing
[16:07] he was not satisfied with showing his
[16:09] wealth, his houses and everything else.
[16:12] His full glory was going to be revealed
[16:14] through his wife. Yes.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; He wasn't satisfied when he displayed
[16:19] the entire wealth of the kingdom.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; And it looked like even they were not
[16:23] impressed.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then what more can I do to
[16:27] impress them?"
[16:30] &gt;&gt; I I'll show them my queen.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; But vastly refused to come.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; I don't have time to get into now, but
[16:38] he says, "Lu the receiver refused the
[16:40] seat
[16:41] &gt;&gt; of Christ." Amen.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Wesley refused to receive the seed of
[16:46] Christ.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; The the Pentecostals refused to receive
[16:49] the seed of Christ.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; But after William Brandon came as
[16:53] Revelation 10:7
[16:55] &gt;&gt; and Malachi 4:5 and 6, there was now a
[16:59] woman that he found at the well.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; A Rebecca,
[17:03] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[17:03] &gt;&gt; that he found at the well.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; And she was drawing water.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. She had justification.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; She was making a sacrifice to feed the
[17:18] camels.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Sanctification.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; So, he had come to bring her into union
[17:26] with Isaac. You know the story. But we
[17:29] are focusing now on Esther. If you're
[17:32] looking at Esther, you will know that
[17:34] Vast is put away. And they have they now
[17:37] the seven chamberlins which are typing
[17:38] the seven church age messengers are now
[17:40] saying go and find a new wife.
[17:45] This one won't reproduce your life.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Go find a new wife.
[17:53] Then we find there's a ministry.
[17:56] Amen. On the scene there
[17:58] &gt;&gt; you know that the king's chamber and one
[18:00] of them is a
[18:02] &gt;&gt; h e g a i. There's a ministry to prepare
[18:07] you for marriage.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; There's a ministry to bring you as
[18:12] queen.
[18:14] If we want to hit the highlights, we can
[18:16] we can look at it very quickly. Amen. If
[18:18] you just want to see it.
[18:20] Praise the Lord. Let's go to Esther
[18:23] chapter 2.
[18:26] Esther chapter 2 and verse 8.
[18:30] It says, "And so it came to pass when
[18:33] the king's commandment and his decree
[18:34] was heard, when many maidens were
[18:36] gathered together unto Shusha and the
[18:38] palace to the custody custody of Agai,
[18:41] that Esther was brought unto the king's
[18:43] house to the custody of Agai, keeper of
[18:46] the women."
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can read further. I want to
[18:49] get down to verse 15. Now when Es when
[18:52] the now all the women were presented now
[18:54] when the turn of Esther the daughter of
[18:56] Abiel uncle of Moriah
[19:00] Amen
[19:01] I don't want to read the whole thing but
[19:03] you can see she required nothing but
[19:05] what Agai the king's chamberlain
[19:08] the keeper of the woman appointed. So
[19:10] she didn't want anything else but what
[19:12] this keeper of the house had given her
[19:14] &gt;&gt; to go into the presence of the king.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Esther obtained favor in the
[19:19] sight of all of them that looked upon
[19:20] her. So Esther was taken into kingus
[19:23] into his house royal in the 10th month
[19:25] which is the 10th month in the seventh
[19:28] year. So under 10th seven it's a
[19:30] marriage.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God being revealed is a
[19:34] marriage.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; And the king loved Esther above all
[19:40] women and she obtained favor grace and
[19:43] favor in his sight more than all the
[19:46] virgins.
[19:47] Why some want to be virgins? You can be
[19:50] virgin.
[19:53] But now she's wife.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; How many of you can see this?
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Esther now becomes wife. She obtains
[19:59] favor more than all the virgins.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So that they he sent a
[20:05] royal crown upon her head and made a
[20:07] queen instead of vasti.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now she is queen.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there's a ministry to
[20:16] bring you into union with Christ where
[20:19] you can be regarded the queen.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; You can walk around the house.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; You have royal accommodation.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; You have royal food.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; You have luxury living.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Is that what we want?
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; But I want to show you a ministry was
[20:43] only a part way. That's why we're
[20:44] speaking about two doors were open to
[20:46] Esther.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Two ministries were open to Esther.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; One under AI to bring her to the
[20:52] marriage. But there must be a further
[20:54] ministry.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; You would know that she didn't have the
[20:58] kingdom. Even though she was the wife
[21:00] because when she finally comes into the
[21:02] king's presence, he says, "What is it,
[21:04] Esther, that you want
[21:05] &gt;&gt; even to have the kingdom? I'll give it
[21:07] to you."
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Now, can I give you what you already
[21:09] have? Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Which means she didn't fulfill a duty as
[21:15] a wife yet.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Where the king could say half of mine is
[21:19] yours.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Now remember men are easily hurt.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; The woman didn't want to come to him.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; She didn't want to have his child.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; So he was looking in the background
[21:30] whether this woman
[21:32] &gt;&gt; will give myself away.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:36] Oh,
[21:38] I give myself away.
[21:41] You see, you can be in the king's
[21:43] palace.
[21:45] You can be partaking of the royal
[21:47] blessings,
[21:48] &gt;&gt; but you're not wife to him.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; You can have
[21:57] board and lodge in the king's palace.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; You can even have a queen-sized bed,
[22:03] maybe a kingsiz bed.
[22:06] And let me put it very bluntly and I I
[22:09] pray you get what I mean.
[22:12] You can be sleeping in the palace but
[22:14] not sleeping with the king.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. Yeah.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; We find here now
[22:28] that the prophet
[22:30] Modiah is not happy with Esther just
[22:32] being queen.
[22:35] Amen.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; He's not happy with her just being
[22:38] queen.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Right now, up until this point of the
[22:41] story, she's queen for her own benefit.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; We were not called into the kingdom for
[22:45] our own benefit.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; There are certain things that he kind of
[22:49] can only do through you and I.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; But as long as we stay outside of his
[22:54] presence,
[22:55] &gt;&gt; here she is standing like queen, a
[22:57] virgin queen. I'm the queen. I got
[22:59] chosen above all women. But the king is
[23:02] in his throne room and she's
[23:05] disconnected from him.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; She even says she includes herself with
[23:11] the other people. But she didn't realize
[23:13] what her position is.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; She says anyone who comes into the
[23:17] presence of the king will be killed.
[23:21] She didn't realize she was a married
[23:22] wife.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Why? All these years she thinks she's a
[23:26] virgin with oil and a lamp.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; She needs to change her mentality.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; But there's a ministry that's got to
[23:40] change her mentality.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; You remember what we told you about how
[23:45] God works. Revelation is coming through
[23:48] his prophet.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; The key of revelation, you can't get it
[23:52] on your own.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; You've got to get it through a prophetic
[23:55] gift.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So she goes on living and you know
[23:58] how Ammon comes and he tries to he now
[24:01] he writes a law that all Jews will be
[24:03] killed
[24:04] &gt;&gt; on a certain certain date.
[24:07] Now time is drawing near. Seven church
[24:10] changes have passed.
[24:13] The fourth house is on the earth. All
[24:16] hell is let loose upon the earth.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Time is drawing night. The bride needs
[24:20] to get out of the way.
[24:24] But she is just living there
[24:26] disconnected from the king. I pray
[24:28] you're reading between the lines what
[24:29] I'm trying to tell you.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Saying I'm in the message,
[24:34] &gt;&gt; saying I'm the bride.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Saying I'm a virgin.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; Saying I'm a wife. But you have no
[24:40] relationship with the king.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; You will find that
[24:48] her words that whoever goes into the
[24:51] presence of the king will be killed is a
[24:54] non-truth.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; She is believing that if I go into the
[24:59] presence of the king, I'll be killed.
[25:02] But when she finally gets into the
[25:04] presence, she is proved wrong.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Which means she could have gone earlier.
[25:09] Yeah,
[25:12] &gt;&gt; she was depriving herself of privileges.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Because she didn't want to go in
[25:17] &gt;&gt; because of a false word that was
[25:19] preached to her.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; But she looks like she's in the message.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; She's It was the first ministry that
[25:30] brought her in.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; She's queen. What more could you want? I
[25:34] want more.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Hey.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:39] I don't want just the title.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; I want more.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; And in fact, I must have more.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you are
[25:48] satisfied with what you have right now?
[25:50] &gt;&gt; How many of you want more?
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Then amen. God is opening to us now that
[25:54] he wants to give us more, but you can't
[25:57] receive more in the current condition
[25:59] you are in or where you are currently
[26:01] positioned.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Who must change their position in order
[26:05] for Esther to get more? Must the king
[26:07] come out of where he is or must you get
[26:09] into where he is?
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; I just want to be where you are.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; You can't call the king to where you
[26:18] are.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; You've got to lower your pride.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; You've got to lower all your ambitions.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; And you've got to get into the presence
[26:26] of the king.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful. Thank you. So we are
[26:33] finding here some like identification
[26:35] being in the kingdom is not good enough.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Oh
[26:40] &gt;&gt; being in the kingdom is not good enough.
[26:41] No
[26:44] some have I a certain identification. I
[26:47] got justification. Do you know
[26:49] justification? You mean you in the
[26:50] kingdom?
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Hey
[26:53] that's a work of the Holy Ghost.
[26:56] So justification means you you're in the
[26:58] kingdom but you haven't gone the full
[27:00] way. To have sanctification means you're
[27:02] part of the kingdom. I told you last
[27:04] week all of these people will be saved.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; When John sees them, John is asked who
[27:09] are who are these? You couldn't number
[27:11] them. They were without number.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; And the voice the angel says these are
[27:16] they that have come through great
[27:17] tribulation.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; So they will not lose their salvation.
[27:20] They were saved under justification,
[27:22] saved under sanctification, saved under
[27:25] restoration of the gifts. But in this
[27:27] time and season, if you miss the shout,
[27:30] &gt;&gt; you will miss salvation.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; There's not an alternate door like an
[27:34] escape hatch. If I miss the shout in the
[27:36] rapture, I'm going in the secret door.
[27:37] I'll go in the tribulation. No.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you miss your part
[27:45] of the rapture, which is the shout, you
[27:47] will miss the physical translation of
[27:49] the body.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they to stay outside the court
[27:56] of the Lord's knocking, but they won't
[27:57] open. Christ has opened the door to the
[27:59] marriage, pull the bride out. He changed
[28:02] the title from church to bride into a
[28:04] married ceremony because he wants to
[28:06] reproduce his life in us like no other
[28:08] age before.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:15] So every door has a key. And when he
[28:17] opened the door, we know he pulled the
[28:18] bride in through revelation, right? The
[28:21] foolish virgins can't come in. He says
[28:23] the door was closed to her because she
[28:24] don't have revelation of this end time
[28:26] message.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; That's why she can't come to the
[28:28] marriage. She don't have revelation.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Thank God for
[28:33] revelation."
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; That's my key.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; To unlock Jesus.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:44] Now there's another key if you go to
[28:46] Revelation 3:7 there.
[28:50] Hallelujah. Let's look at this key very
[28:52] quickly.
[28:54] And to the angel of the church in
[28:56] Philadelphia, right?
[29:00] You remember Philadelphia is a leap over
[29:01] age now.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; We've been speaking on the Philadelphia
[29:04] corridor.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; All of these things. You remember
[29:06] brother Brandon says it's a lapover age.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Into the latest church age. How many of
[29:11] you remember that? Amen.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; These things say he that is holy, he
[29:15] that is true, he that had the key of
[29:17] David.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Now what is this key?
[29:22] &gt;&gt; He that openeth and no man shut it and
[29:25] shut and no man openeth. Now what kind
[29:28] of a key is this? It sounds like a
[29:29] master key.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; It sounds like a key to unlock
[29:34] potentials.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; It sounds like a key to the kingdom.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Is Jesus called the son of David?
[29:42] Then what is this key that they're
[29:44] talking about?
[29:48] Jesus has the key. How many of you are
[29:50] reading this?
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; These things say he which is holy. Who
[29:53] is that?
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Is that Jesus?
[29:59] &gt;&gt; He that is true.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; So the one that is holy and true has the
[30:04] key of David.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; But does he really have it?
[30:14] In what form does he have it is what I'm
[30:16] trying to ask you. Let's go. Amen. If
[30:18] you can put up that first quote there.
[30:20] So let's read Isaiah 22:22 before you
[30:23] put up the quote. So let's look at the
[30:24] key of David. Right.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; I don't if you're interested to see what
[30:28] the key of David is.
[30:30] Amen.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; So here in Isaiah 22:22 it says, "And
[30:34] the key of the house of David will I lay
[30:37] upon is."
[30:39] &gt;&gt; So where's the key?
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Why not answering me?
[30:49] Don't want to go 1:00.
[30:53] And the key of the house of David while
[30:55] I lay upon is
[30:57] &gt;&gt; shoulder. So he shall open
[31:01] &gt;&gt; and none shall shut and he shall shut
[31:04] and none shall open. Is that just what
[31:06] we read in Revelation there?
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; So this key looks like an important key
[31:10] to have.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Now remember the key of David. Why
[31:18] David? Remember David did something very
[31:21] unusual. He was king. But he went into
[31:24] the priest
[31:26] tabernacle there and he ate of the mana.
[31:30] Something a king was not supposed to do.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember that King
[31:34] David did that.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Because what was he trying to type? He
[31:38] was trying to type Melzdc was both king
[31:40] and priest.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; So he did it for a reason. If we go to
[31:44] that first quote there, you'll see what
[31:46] the prophet of God is saying. Amen.
[31:49] Okay. So, I don't want to get this. I
[31:51] want to get Did I give you this first?
[31:56] Praise the Lord.
[31:58] Let me see what I gave you first. Amen.
[32:06] The first quote I gave you was about the
[32:07] key of David. Amen. Maybe you put it in
[32:10] a different order. He says, "He that
[32:12] hath the key of David."
[32:17] This is what we want to see now. What is
[32:18] the prophet telling us this? What is he
[32:22] telling us about the key of David? How
[32:23] many if you want to know?
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says, "He that had
[32:28] the key of David," this beautiful phrase
[32:31] follows and comes out of the preceding
[32:33] verse, he that is true, Christ, the
[32:36] perfect realization contrasted with
[32:39] partial realization.
[32:42] Praise the Lord.
[32:44] Here it is. Moses was a prophet of God.
[32:47] But Jesus, like unto Moses, was the
[32:50] prophet of God.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; So, I'm reading this quote from my
[33:02] message that I gave to you. It's the
[33:04] first quote I sent to you. So, if you
[33:06] can find it quickly, I don't want the
[33:07] people to miss this. Amen.
[33:10] Praise the Lord.
[33:20] So, I'm going to read now and I want you
[33:22] to get what the prophet is saying this T
[33:23] is cuz it's very important to understand
[33:26] it.
[33:28] You don't if you're going to your car
[33:30] and you can't find your your house key
[33:31] or your car key.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; And you're walking around going looking
[33:37] everywhere for the key only to finally
[33:39] realize the key is in your pocket.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:43] That's what I'm trying to convey to you
[33:44] now.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet is saying certain
[33:50] things
[33:51] &gt;&gt; and we are missing it in the message.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; He that had the key of David. This
[33:57] beautiful phrase follows and comes out
[33:59] of the preceding phrase. He that is
[34:01] true. Christ the perfect realization
[34:03] contrasted with partial realization.
[34:06] Here it is. Moses was a prophet of God.
[34:09] But Jesus, like unto Moses, was the
[34:11] prophet of God.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; David, a man after God's own heart, was
[34:15] king of Israel. But Jesus is greater
[34:18] David, king of kings, lord of lords,
[34:20] God, very God.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Now, David was born of the tribe of
[34:30] Judah, out of whom no priest came. Yet
[34:33] he ate of the shorebread received
[34:36] reserved for priest. He was the great
[34:38] warrior overcoming the enemy,
[34:40] establishing the people as king. He sat
[34:42] on the throne. He was a prophet. He was
[34:45] a wonderful type of Christ.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; So, he's showing you that David was
[34:49] typing prophet, priest, and king.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, it says in Isaiah 22:22,
[34:56] "And the key of the house of David will
[34:58] I lay upon his shoulder, so he shall
[35:00] open and none shall shut, and he shall
[35:02] shut, and none shall open." So wait,
[35:04] does it look like God is doing this?
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Because he's saying, "He shall open, he
[35:09] shall shut."
[35:11] [Music]
[35:16] &gt;&gt; The spirit uses this Old Testament
[35:18] reference concerning the Lord Jesus
[35:20] Christ and his ministry in the church.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; What the key of David signified at that
[35:27] time was a mere shadow which is now
[35:29] fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst
[35:31] of the lampstands. It has to do with our
[35:34] Lord after his resurrection and not his
[35:37] earthly pilgrimage. But what does the
[35:39] key signify?
[35:41] The answer lies in the position of the
[35:44] key.
[35:50] It's not in his hand.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; It's not worn around his neck. It's not
[35:56] placed in the hands of other men. Or the
[35:58] verse could not be saying he alone has
[36:00] the use of that key for he alone opens
[36:03] and shut and no man has a right but
[36:05] Jesus himself. Isn't that right? But
[36:08] where is the key? It's on his shoulders.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Now he's going to show you something.
[36:15] But what does the shoulder have to do
[36:17] with it? Read Isaiah 9:6. And the
[36:20] government shall be upon his shoulder.
[36:22] [Music]
[36:24] &gt;&gt; But what does this mean? The answer is
[36:26] this. The phrase government upon his
[36:29] shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony
[36:31] from the east.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[36:34] &gt;&gt; When the bride has been committed to the
[36:36] groom, she takes off a veil and places
[36:39] it over the groom's shoulder, signifying
[36:42] that not only is she under his dominion,
[36:46] that she has transferred her rights to
[36:48] him.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[36:54] That he is the head. Oh yes.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; But then if he is the head,
[37:00] it means he's not the shoulder.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Shoulder is part of the somebody say
[37:06] &gt;&gt; body.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; So where's the key?
[37:11] &gt;&gt; It's in the body.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; So if Jesus himself is the only one that
[37:16] can lock and unlock
[37:19] &gt;&gt; and the key is in the body,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; through whom must he lock and unlock?
[37:24] Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; You see why I say there are certain
[37:32] things locked up in his mind that only
[37:33] you and I can fulfill if we submit to
[37:35] him.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; So we want him to do everything but he
[37:39] wants to do it through us.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[37:48] He is the head but also that he bears
[37:51] the responsibility and the care that he
[37:54] and he alone. No one else, no other man,
[37:56] no other power has any right or
[37:59] responsibility. I don't expect another
[38:01] man to be buying groceries for my wife.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; I don't expect another man to be buying
[38:08] a dress for my wife.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; He takes full responsibility.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus Christ takes full
[38:16] responsibility for each and every one of
[38:18] us personally.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; In this room seated right here, Jesus
[38:22] Christ has a personal responsibility
[38:24] over your life.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Meaning from your breath to your
[38:28] well-being to your health to your job to
[38:31] your school to every facet of your life.
[38:33] Jesus takes clinical responsibility for
[38:36] it.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Which means if we realize that we can go
[38:41] to him and make a claim,
[38:42] &gt;&gt; you are responsible for me. Why am I
[38:44] starving? You are responsible for me.
[38:47] Why don't I have clothes? You are
[38:49] responsible for me. Why don't I have a
[38:51] place to stay?
[38:54] &gt;&gt; But you can only make a claim if you
[38:55] recognize who you are.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; And who has responsibility over you?
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, man.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Joshua, do you expect us to
[39:07] Josephine to God and work
[39:08] &gt;&gt; right now
[39:10] &gt;&gt; and buy our own clothes and our own
[39:12] food?
[39:14] No, brother Joshua, sister Vanessa has
[39:16] taken personal responsibility over
[39:18] sister Josephine.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; So anything sister Josephine needs
[39:25] &gt;&gt; must she go ask brother Jeff
[39:28] &gt;&gt; the uncle
[39:29] &gt;&gt; the rich uncle?
[39:34] No, she must go to mom and dad.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Who did Caleb's daughter go to?
[39:44] Yes.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; After he got his inheritance,
[39:48] &gt;&gt; came to Caleb,
[39:50] &gt;&gt; came to her father and says, "Father, I
[39:52] have need of the spring."
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "Such as I have, give I unto
[39:56] thee. You want to the upper spring, but
[39:58] also take the lower spring."
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; You've got to realize who you are under
[40:06] headship.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; You see why is so important? because you
[40:11] can make a claim upon your head.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Father.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just continue reading and
[40:21] finishing this quote. So, he has person.
[40:23] So, anything you need in this life,
[40:24] Jesus Christ takes personal
[40:26] responsibility over you.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; You need a husband, who you need to ask?
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Your head.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; You need to ask Jesus.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Look, unmarried people, your head is
[40:36] Jesus Christ.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; If you need a wife, you need a husband,
[40:43] you need to ask the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is your head.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Seek the Lord in these things.
[40:56] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:05] And that beloved is the key of David.
[41:08] God being sovereign. He for you by
[41:11] divine decree exactly who would be in
[41:13] his bride.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Watch is going to detail it now. He
[41:17] chose her. She did not choose him.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; He called her. She did not come on her
[41:24] own. He died for her. He washed her in
[41:26] his own blood. He paid the price for
[41:28] her. She belongs to him and to him
[41:31] alone.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; She's only committed to him and accepts
[41:37] the obligation. He is her head for
[41:41] Christ is the head of the church.
[41:44] Praise the Lord.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; And Sarah called Abraham
[41:48] Lord even so the bride is happy that he
[41:52] is her Lord. Do you know what that word
[41:54] Lord means?
[41:57] Maybe after this the woman will call the
[41:59] husband Lord.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord because maybe we don't
[42:05] know what the Lord mean word Lord means.
[42:07] The word Lord means owner.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; You are my owner.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Now, who's renting here?
[42:17] &gt;&gt; What's your the man that owns a building
[42:20] called?
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Landlord.
[42:24] You mean he owns that land?
[42:28] See, I make it easy for the sisters to
[42:30] come call you Lord.
[42:32] Where was the woman taken out of?
[42:35] So who is the owner?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; So when you come to your husband and say
[42:40] Lord all you are saying is owner.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb expect a Lord there.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Lord Caleb.
[42:52] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[42:57] Now let's let's jump very quickly to the
[43:00] story of Esther again and I'm going to
[43:01] close now. Amen.
[43:05] We'll hit the highlight of Esther and
[43:07] then we'll close. Is anybody not happy
[43:09] with that arrangement?
[43:14] Okay.
[43:16] We find in the book of Esther very
[43:18] quickly we showed you there was a
[43:20] ministry of Agai who only brought her a
[43:22] certain stage of the journey.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; He brought her into the marriage
[43:27] &gt;&gt; but then he went off the scene.
[43:31] Here in the book of Esther chapter 4,
[43:35] we find there's another ministry comes
[43:37] in on the scene
[43:39] which is a type of the five-fold
[43:41] ministry.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; It says in Esther chapter 4, we can read
[43:48] maybe just from verse five
[43:52] starts in five, right? Then God called
[43:55] Esther. Then called Esther for Ach.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:00] A techch is a very important ministry.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Techch is now taking word from Moriah
[44:08] &gt;&gt; and conveying it to Esther.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; He is the gobetween.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Because right now Brandom is not on the
[44:14] earth.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Modiah doesn't have access to Esther.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; So he's sending word via tech.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; The fivefold ministry is getting word
[44:24] from the prophet's message
[44:26] &gt;&gt; and bringing it out to you week after
[44:28] week.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? To position you.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Watch what he does. Then called Amen
[44:36] Esther for one of the king's chamberlins
[44:38] whom he had appointed to attend upon her
[44:40] and gave him commandment to Modi to know
[44:43] what it was and why it was.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. To know the mysteries.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; What it was, why it was.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; That sounds like a mystery.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; So who's bringing it? The five-fold.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Where is he getting
[44:59] it from? And Ach went forth to Moriah.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; You ask your pastor anything, he goes
[45:04] into the message.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; He goes to Moriah to find out what did
[45:08] Moriah say.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Ach went forth to Mori unto the street
[45:15] of the city which was before the king's
[45:17] gate. And Mori told him of all that had
[45:19] happened to him and the sum of the money
[45:21] that Ammon had promised to pay the
[45:23] king's treasures for the Jews to destroy
[45:25] them. So like I said, time is running
[45:28] out. The date for all Jews to be
[45:31] annihilated is coming closer.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Time is running out. The time for our
[45:35] body change is growing closer. The time
[45:37] for the Denny Christ is growing closer.
[45:39] We don't have much time. So at is on the
[45:42] scene now to speed up the process and
[45:44] bring the king in to bring Esther into
[45:46] where she's supposed to be.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; And he gave him copy of the writing.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. And the decree that was given to
[45:56] Shusha, didn't we see copies of the one
[45:58] world government, the one world
[46:00] religion? Didn't we see copies of it?
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; They have everything in place right now.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Didn't Modiah tell us about these
[46:08] things?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Show it to Esther. Declare it unto her.
[46:13] Charge her that she should go in unto
[46:15] the king. What is his ministry now?
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Get into shakana glory.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now is the time church not
[46:23] to stay outside. Yeah. Virgin with lamp.
[46:25] Get into the presence of the king.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Get shut in with God. Come into shakana
[46:30] glory.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; What is his ministry?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; He's saying give word, give charge that
[46:37] she should go in unto the king.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; To make supplication unto him and to
[46:43] make request before him for her people.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And at came and told Esther the
[46:50] words of Moriah
[46:52] again five-fold ministry coming to tell
[46:54] you.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you'll find there's a back and
[46:59] forth back and forth going. She sends a
[47:01] tech with another word. I don't want to
[47:02] read all of it. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's
[47:04] go down to verse 14.
[47:08] For thou allto together, for if thou
[47:10] allto together holdeth thy peace at this
[47:12] time, then shall enlargement and
[47:15] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[47:17] another place.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to know in God's mind,
[47:20] enlargement and deliverance is not
[47:22] supposed to come from another place.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Enlargement and deliverance is supposed
[47:26] to come from you, Esther.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; But he's saying if you don't want to do
[47:33] your part,
[47:35] &gt;&gt; God will do it another way. That's
[47:36] right.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; But let's pray that the hack ministry
[47:40] works.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Because it does work now.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; But thou and thy father's house shall be
[47:47] destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou
[47:50] art called to come into the kingdom.
[47:51] Kingdom needs a key.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Key of David
[47:55] &gt;&gt; for such a time as this.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; This ministry shakes her.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; This ministry startles her.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. to realize that even in the king's
[48:07] house she can die.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Can we say that
[48:11] &gt;&gt; you your father's house even you die in
[48:13] your kingdom because the decree is that
[48:15] all Jews must die.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:23] Praise the Lord.
[48:27] Now she says
[48:29] to Badim, "Return to Morai. Go gather
[48:32] together all the Jews that are present
[48:34] in Shushan. Fast ye for me, neither heat
[48:36] nor drink three days, nor night or day.
[48:39] I also and my maidens will fast
[48:41] likewise. So will I go unto the king
[48:44] which is not according to the law. And
[48:46] if I perish, I perish.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; You see, we don't do Daniel fast.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; We are type of Esther.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Denominations can't do this fast.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; They like to eat fruit and veg all day
[48:58] and they call it Daniel fast.
[49:01] They do it for 21 days
[49:03] &gt;&gt; eating fruit and veg.
[49:06] Esther's fast is no food.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; I know some of you saying, "I want to be
[49:11] like Daniel."
[49:12] This is too hard, right? Praise the
[49:15] Lord.
[49:21] Now, let's go to verse five, chapter 5
[49:23] verse quickly. Now, what she said,
[49:28] remember what she said? Anyone who goes
[49:29] into the presence of the king will die.
[49:32] Esther chapter 5 verse two. And it was
[49:34] so when king saw Esther the queen
[49:37] standing in the court that she obtained
[49:39] favor in his sight.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; And the king held out to Esther the
[49:43] golden scepter that was in his hand. So
[49:46] Esther drew near and touched the top of
[49:48] the scepter.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; This is who he was always waiting for.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Because he was rejected by Vasti. This
[49:57] man's ego was a bit affected.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; So he was afraid to call for her just in
[50:05] case. She says she don't want to come.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; So when he saw her there, he says, "This
[50:15] is whom I've been waiting for all my
[50:16] life."
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; How come you're married to me? How come
[50:21] you're my queen?
[50:22] &gt;&gt; But you're not with me. Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; So he raises the royal scepter.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; To his queen
[50:31] &gt;&gt; and then he says unto her, "What will
[50:33] thou queen Esther? What is thy request?
[50:35] It shall ever even give unto thee after
[50:38] the kingdom.
[50:40] Praise the Lord."
[50:44] Now you know that uh Esther goes on a
[50:48] bit of a thing now where she tries to
[50:49] set up a meeting between Aean and the
[50:51] king. I'm not going to go into all of
[50:52] that. I want to get past this because
[50:54] most preachers stop here. This royal
[50:56] scepter is raised.
[50:58] Esther is before the king. Ammon is
[51:01] destroyed. But there's a further part to
[51:03] the story.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; We want to get to that part.
[51:11] Praise the Lord. Here in Esther chapter
[51:13] 7. Now,
[51:15] so after the banquet of wine, wine is
[51:17] typing revelation. After the banquet of
[51:20] revelation, right? If you read there in
[51:22] Esther chapter 7, you'll see there
[51:26] chapter verse two.
[51:29] And the king said unto again unto
[51:31] Esther, on the second day at the banquet
[51:33] of wine. Now, banquet of wine, I'm
[51:35] telling you spiritually speaking, is a
[51:37] banquet of revelation. That's right.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Stimulation of revelation. What is thy
[51:42] petition, Queen Esther? And it shall be
[51:44] given grant to thee. What is thy
[51:45] request? It shall be performed even to
[51:47] ask the kingdom. Then the queen answered
[51:49] and said, "If I have found favor in thy
[51:51] sight, O king, and if it pleased the
[51:53] king, let my life be given me at my
[51:56] petition and my people at my request.
[51:58] For we are sold, I and my people to be
[52:00] destroyed, to be slain, to perish. For
[52:02] if if we had been sold for bondman and
[52:05] bond woman, I had held my tongue."
[52:08] Although the enemy could not count to
[52:10] veil the king's damage.
[52:12] Then the king Asus answered and said
[52:14] unto queen Esther the queen who is he
[52:17] and where is he that does presume in his
[52:19] heart to do so.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; So now she reveals the fourth house
[52:23] rider. She reveals Amon there. Right?
[52:27] If you go to verse 10 which is the last
[52:29] thing I want to show you the end of Amon
[52:30] and Aman is hanged in the gallows that
[52:33] he had prepared for Modiah.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:37] I want to get to chapter eight because
[52:39] eight speaks of eternity. Now
[52:41] &gt;&gt; eight speaks of the bride age.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Eight speaks of the headstone age.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; This is where things start to happen.
[52:48] Now
[52:52] her getting rid of Amon was good, but
[52:55] this is now for the deliverance of the
[52:58] Jews.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read from verse four again.
[53:02] Now the king held out the golden scepter
[53:05] towards Esther. So second time a scepter
[53:07] is held out to her. Esther rose and
[53:09] stood before the king and said, "If it
[53:11] pleased the king, I found favor in the
[53:12] sight and the things seem right before
[53:14] the king and I be pleasing in his eyes.
[53:16] Let it be written to reverse the letters
[53:19] devised by Ammon, the son of Ahmedabad,
[53:23] the Agatite,
[53:25] which he wrote to destroy the Jews,
[53:28] which were in the king's provinces."
[53:33] Right?
[53:35] For how can I endure to see the evil
[53:37] that shall come to my people? Or how can
[53:39] I endure to see destruction of my
[53:40] kindred? Then king said unto Esther the
[53:43] queen and Moriah the Jew, behold I have
[53:46] given Esther the house of Ammon him and
[53:48] they have upon the gallows be because he
[53:51] laid his hand upon the Jews.
[53:55] Now watch. You want me to write? Who
[53:58] does Esther want to write?
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Esther wants the king to write. Yes,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; everyone read that
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Esther is telling the king, rewrite the
[54:08] law.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; What is the king telling her now?
[54:14] Write you for the Jews.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Which means, sister.
[54:21] Amen.
[54:23] What does it mean?
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Speak the word.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; You're right.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Why you asking me?
[54:33] He said, "Write he also for the Jews has
[54:36] he like you
[54:40] &gt;&gt; in the king's name."
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Well, there's no one more qualified to
[54:44] write in the king's name than the one
[54:45] who has the name.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wonderful. Amen.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; She is Mrs. Hahasser.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; So, in whose name are you writing
[54:57] &gt;&gt; in the king's name? But it's your name.
[55:00] Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; And seal it with the king's ring.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; For the writing which is written in the
[55:10] king's name and sealed in the king's
[55:13] ring, may no man reverse.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what he is telling her, I
[55:21] as a king have decreed something and my
[55:24] words are irreversible.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; I have written it down
[55:28] &gt;&gt; as it is written. So let it be. But if
[55:31] you rewrite the laws,
[55:33] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you permission to rewrite the
[55:35] laws.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you permission to rewrite
[55:38] your life story.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; You have the king's seal.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You have his name.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; The king's seal means his authority.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Then where the king's called in the
[55:52] time, watch now, pay attention to the
[55:54] date.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; In the third month, that is the month of
[55:57] S on the 23rd day. Hallelujah.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Right on the 23rd day,
[56:04] &gt;&gt; as it was written according that Moriah
[56:06] commanded unto the Jews, lieutenants,
[56:08] deputies, rulers of the provinces, which
[56:10] are from India, unto Ethiopia, and 127
[56:14] provinces, and to every province
[56:16] according, this sounds like prophesying
[56:18] again, to every nation, tribes, and
[56:19] tongues.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Rewrite it and prophesy it.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Verse 10. And he wrote in King Audis's
[56:28] name and sealed it with the king's ring
[56:32] and sent letters by post on horseback
[56:34] and riders and mules, camels and young
[56:38] dramaties.
[56:41] What was going to happen? To sum it up,
[56:45] the day when these men were going to
[56:47] come to kill the Jews still stood.
[56:50] But they rewrote the law that on the
[56:52] 23rd day,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; we will fight for our rights. any man
[56:57] coming after us and the Jews, we have a
[56:59] right now to defend ourselves.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; I want to end with this quote here to
[57:03] show you
[57:06] &gt;&gt; regarding now. Remember what we said?
[57:08] The key is on the shoulder.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you remember that?
[57:12] &gt;&gt; The key is on the shoulder.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:17] So, let's read there after that last
[57:19] quote we read in the church ages. The
[57:21] spoken word is your original seed.
[57:24] 620318.
[57:26] Where is the government? Now remember
[57:28] the government shall be upon his
[57:29] shoulder. And we know the key is on the
[57:32] shoulder. Everyone is understanding
[57:34] that.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Where is the government going to be upon
[57:39] the shoulders? His body. The government
[57:41] upon his shoulders. That's a part of the
[57:43] body. What is is it is earthly strength.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; I'll let you digest that a bit.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. The strength of almighty God.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; The one who spoke and said, "Let there
[57:57] be."
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; His strength is not in heaven.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; The government upon his shoulder, that's
[58:10] his body. What is it? His earthly
[58:13] strength. Samson. The Philistines are
[58:16] upon thee.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And Sam arose. His strength.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:22] What is another word for strength?
[58:24] Virtue.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Where is all seven virtues?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Tell me in his body.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; From faith to charity.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Tell me it's in his body.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Tell me his earthly strength is in his
[58:36] body.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; God's earthly strength, his word made
[58:43] flesh in his body here on earth bringing
[58:46] to pass. Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; You want God to take the key and unlock
[58:50] certain things. God's earthly strength
[58:52] is on the earth.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; That's the second for mystery purpose of
[58:56] what God is doing.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; He's having the preeminence through his
[59:00] body. The keys on the shoulder so he can
[59:02] perfectly unlock what he wants to unlock
[59:05] and lock what he wants to lock.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And we keep sitting and waiting for God
[59:11] to do everything.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Lord, give me the key.
[59:16] Give me the key. The Lord is saying,
[59:18] "But the key is on your shoulder."
[59:22] You have the key.
[59:26] The key is the revelation, but you don't
[59:28] know how to use the key. You're waiting
[59:31] for somebody else to come and take the
[59:33] key. Praise the Lord.
[59:36] Now, closing with our last thought
[59:38] there.
[59:40] Remember what we read in St. John 14
[59:43] verse 17.
[59:45] Where is the Lord right now?
[59:48] Maybe maybe this won't make any sense to
[59:50] you or maybe you don't even believe it
[59:51] because you don't believe the Holy
[59:52] Spirit is God Almighty.
[59:55] Maybe you're a trinitarian.
[1:00:00] Hello.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; If you're a Trinitarian, this thing
[1:00:04] won't mean nothing to you.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you put up John 14:17 there,
[1:00:12] you'll see. for he dwelleth with you and
[1:00:15] shall be.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; So which means Jesus said, "I'll send
[1:00:20] you another comforter."
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; So which means if he wants to use a key,
[1:00:25] he is in you
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; to use the key of David
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; to unlock it.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; You mean the the fullness of God is
[1:00:40] coming into the body? Yes.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You and I hold a certain measure
[1:00:45] of it. That is why St. John, if you go
[1:00:47] to verse 20 there, this is key to this
[1:00:49] is our scripture. Now, that day you
[1:00:52] shall know, I am in my father, you in
[1:00:54] me, I in you.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; You've got to realize you are married
[1:00:58] totally.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Body, spirit, soul, everything.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Christ is in you.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Ephesians 17 as our last,
[1:01:09] sorry, 3:1 17 as our closing here. You
[1:01:12] say with the fullness in the body. Yes.
[1:01:14] Let's see if the Bible confirms this.
[1:01:16] Ephesians 3:17.
[1:01:19] That Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:01:22] faith. That you might that he being
[1:01:24] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[1:01:27] to comprehend with all saints what is
[1:01:29] the breadth, length, depth, and height
[1:01:32] and to know the love of Christ which
[1:01:34] passes knowledge that you might be
[1:01:36] filled with some of the fullness of God.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:01:43] You mean collectively as the body of
[1:01:45] Christ, the fullness of God is residing
[1:01:47] in the body.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; But that's why Satan keeps you divided
[1:01:50] and you don't like that brother because
[1:01:53] the fullness is not in one man.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; The fullness is in the body.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; So we hate other people from other
[1:02:02] churches in the body.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; But we need the fullness.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; We need the unity. We need the love.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; We need to break down walls.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; We need to break down barriers.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan is laughing because you
[1:02:18] fighting with your brother and you got a
[1:02:19] heal feeling against your brother and
[1:02:20] you can't stand to fellowship with your
[1:02:22] brother. And Satan is laughing because
[1:02:23] you are disempowered.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; You're only moving here with 2% power.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Disconnected from the rest of the body.
[1:02:31] trying to fly but your engine
[1:02:34] 2% power you're flying with
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; because you are not connected with the
[1:02:38] rest of the body. You see why it's
[1:02:40] dangerous to be in churches that tell
[1:02:41] you don't fellowship with other people.
[1:02:43] Don't go to combined meetings. Don't go
[1:02:45] to convention. Don't connect with the
[1:02:47] rest of the body. What are they doing?
[1:02:48] Disconnecting you from charging.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; If my battery died, what do I need to
[1:02:52] do? Take jumper cables, get brother
[1:02:54] Jaffford's car, plug it into his
[1:02:56] battery, and suddenly my engine starts
[1:02:58] to swing. Yes.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; But if you call formal in your house,
[1:03:01] they're saying press play, press play,
[1:03:03] press play.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Where is the key?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; The body.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; You in your house alone.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Battery is dead. I know you know you
[1:03:17] can't leave a battery too long without
[1:03:19] charging.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; What happens to the battery?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Go leave your car for a couple months.
[1:03:24] Don't drive it. Don't start it. See what
[1:03:26] happens. and go see if you can even try
[1:03:28] and restore that battery. If it's a very
[1:03:30] strong battery, maybe most of the time
[1:03:32] they'll tell you, "Sorry, this battery
[1:03:34] is gone. You need a new one."
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying preserve what you have.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; There's no replaceable batteries here.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; What God has given you, treasured.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; The key to David is on your shoulder.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; And God wants to lock and unlock and
[1:03:52] bind and loose through you right now. We
[1:03:55] had more quotes on Christ the mystery,
[1:03:57] but I'm not going to go into it right
[1:03:58] now. Let's stand together and give God
[1:04:00] praise.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; What is this teaching for? To empower
[1:04:05] you. Come musicians, let's sing.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; What is this teaching for
[1:04:10] in any of this preaching here? Was it to
[1:04:12] elevate me?
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Or was it to empower the body?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; To make you realize who we are as a
[1:04:20] body?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; The the quicker we realize it, the
[1:04:23] quicker we can get into the throne room.
[1:04:25] Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And look, once she got into the throne
[1:04:27] room, she was given out the kingdom.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; She was given the king's seal. She was
[1:04:31] given the king's name. Said, "Go rewrite
[1:04:33] the laws yourself."
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; But there is power in the spoken word.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Who operates a spoken word right now?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; You.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You and I operate the power of the
[1:04:47] spoken word. Brother Brandon is not
[1:04:49] here.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; There are certain things designed only
[1:04:51] for you to do. Don't try and resurrect
[1:04:53] brother Brandon from the dead.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; You'll come out with the with the
[1:04:57] resurrection of the sleeping saints,
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; but you always want to quote about the
[1:05:00] fish he raised. How about you raise your
[1:05:01] own fish?
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; You always want to talk about his
[1:05:05] squirrels.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; How many of you know you can't eat
[1:05:12] a squirrel from the past?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; If you're feeling for squittle,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; you have the power to speak it. Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; It's in you. Remember who takes
[1:05:25] responsibility for you. I want to sing
[1:05:26] that song again where Eagles's there.
[1:05:27] Let's sing it. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:42] We have been born in an eagle age
[1:05:46] by an eagle's prophet's message
[1:05:50] to manifest the living word for our day.
[1:05:56] And we've been given wings to fly
[1:06:01] way up in the sky
[1:06:04] when no other bird can fly
[1:06:10] to live in heavenly atmosphere
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:17] to fly a lonely eagle's day.
[1:06:23] Oh fly,
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:26] so high
[1:06:28] where the world of God is
[1:06:33] a living reality.
[1:06:38] So
[1:06:40] so high.
[1:06:42] True eagles in the sky.
[1:06:47] Set your wings. Let's fly the day.
[1:06:53] [Music]
[1:07:00] We have been gathered by the shout
[1:07:04] a message that porn out
[1:07:07] from this world of fear and doubt
[1:07:13] and have been given eyes to see.
[1:07:18] All the mysteries are being revealed.
[1:07:21] Our lives are telling prophecy
[1:07:25] to see our position to see our position
[1:07:29] in God's word. Or to fly where only
[1:07:33] eagles could to fly where only eagles
[1:07:37] could.
[1:07:40] Let's fly
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:43] so high.
[1:07:45] Where the word of God is
[1:07:50] a living reality.
[1:07:54] Oh so
[1:07:57] so high. True in the sky.
[1:08:04] Set your wings. Let's fly away.
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:16] We are not called to be heard about the
[1:08:20] message of hearts on the ground.
[1:08:24] Neither to be living out.
[1:08:31] We can change and lift it up
[1:08:34] on the mountain to talk
[1:08:38] setting in the temple.
[1:08:42] Oh, gather
[1:08:44] at our
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:08:51] provide a place we live.
[1:08:56] It's fly
[1:08:59] so high
[1:09:01] where the world of God is
[1:09:06] a living reality
[1:09:10] to soul
[1:09:13] so high
[1:09:16] eagles in the sky.
[1:09:20] Set your wings fly with you.
[1:09:25] Well,
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; let's just worship the Lord as the music
[1:09:26] plays. Lord, suddenly thank the Lord in
[1:09:28] here that the key, the key of David is
[1:09:32] given to you the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:36] Lord Jesus wants to operate the key to
[1:09:40] you and I. Father, forgive us, oh God,
[1:09:44] if we've been expecting other people,
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, to fulfill our part of the
[1:09:49] promise,
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; to fulfill our part of the word, oh God.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; But you've given us the key of David.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, that you open and no man can shut.
[1:09:59] You shut and no man can open.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help us to realize we are part
[1:10:05] of the mystery of Christ. Part of the
[1:10:08] mystery of God.
[1:10:10] Oh, how we love you, Lord Jesus.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Use us in any way you want to use us. We
[1:10:16] are your hands. We are your feet.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; We are your eyes. We are your ears.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; We are your shoulder. Oh God, we give
[1:10:25] you all rights, oh God.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; You are responsible for our wellbeing.
[1:10:30] You are responsible for our daily needs.
[1:10:32] Oh God,
[1:10:35] thank you Jesus.
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:38] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:42] How many of you want to make a claim on
[1:10:43] the one who is responsible for you? If
[1:10:46] you are sick in body, the one that was
[1:10:48] responsible for you says by my stripes
[1:10:51] you are healed.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; The one who is responsible for you to
[1:10:56] take care of your daily needs. Now that
[1:10:58] you've come into his kingdom, unlocked
[1:11:00] it with revelation says, "I'm Jehovah
[1:11:03] Gyra. I'm your provider.
[1:11:06] You don't have to worry about clothes
[1:11:07] and food.
[1:11:10] How much more are you than sparrows?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; How much more are you than the lily of a
[1:11:14] field?
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; If God does feed the sparrow and he
[1:11:17] clothe the lily in the field, how much
[1:11:19] more are you, son and daughter of God?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; But right now, we are not even focused
[1:11:25] on wanting things naturally.
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] To have a good tie is nice.
[1:11:32] Have a good home is nice.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] have nice things is nice. That's good.
[1:11:37] You should have it. But the main thing,
[1:11:41] do you have a personal relationship
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; with the Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Esther was a queen
[1:11:49] got bought and lodged in the king's
[1:11:51] palace, but she didn't have a personal
[1:11:53] relationship with the king
[1:11:57] until the at came to reposition her and
[1:12:01] told her to get into the presence of the
[1:12:03] king. Hear the angel of the Lord this
[1:12:06] morning telling you to get into the
[1:12:07] presence of the king.
[1:12:11] You'll be surprised what you find when
[1:12:12] you get there. You'll find a royal
[1:12:14] scepter raised to you. You'll find him
[1:12:17] telling you rewrite the laws on your
[1:12:19] own. You'll find him telling you on the
[1:12:21] 23rd day, go and do it. You'll find him
[1:12:23] telling you, here's my ring. Here's my
[1:12:26] authority.
[1:12:30] You are now adopted.
[1:12:32] Esther's adoption ceremony.
[1:12:35] Two doors were open to her. One through
[1:12:38] AI and one through Ach.
[1:12:42] You may have come through one door.
[1:12:45] Now you need to come through the next
[1:12:46] door.
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:50] Oh, you speak for God in this time
[1:12:54] once more. The world will yet direct
[1:12:56] from God as at Pentecost.
[1:12:58] for God will speak through her.
[1:13:03] Amen.
[1:13:07] Speak my Lord.
[1:13:10] Speak my Lord.
[1:13:14] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[1:13:19] Speak my Lord.
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:22] Speak my Lord.
[1:13:25] [Applause]
[1:13:27] Speak and I will answer. Lord, send in
[1:13:31] me. How many of you want to say that
[1:13:33] this morning? Speak my name.
[1:13:38] Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be quick.
[1:13:43] Speak and I'll be great.
[1:13:47] Oh, speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak
[1:13:52] my Lord. My Lord.
[1:13:55] Speak and I'll be quick.
[1:13:57] [Music]
