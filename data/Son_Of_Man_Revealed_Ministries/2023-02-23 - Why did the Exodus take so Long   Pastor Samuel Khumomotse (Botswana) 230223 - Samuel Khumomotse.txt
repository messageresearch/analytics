TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Waters He restored my soul he leaded me in parts of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy stuff they comfort me the preparers the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anoint us my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen let's give the Lord a good act of a praise hallelujah amen amen amen so we know amen that 23 is a very significant number if you read amen over in the Book of Romans and you'll find where the Apostle Paul is telling you amen and he's giving his account of that ship the ship that was red but to finally in the 23rd verse he says for they stood before me an angel of God whose I am and whom I serve glorious amen brother Brandon when he was going to meet you know when he had enough of the church world and he said I'm going into the cave yes and he said I don't know but my wife must take care of Billy Paul and if you go and type it out you'll see he had 23 dollars in his bank account and when he surrendered at 23 dollars and he went into the cave he met the angel of the Lord amen amen Hallelujah the prophet of God when he was getting married to Mida amen he said you go pray and I'll pray after they prayed he asked me them what the Lord reveal to you he said the Lord showed me Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet and she says what the Lord say to you he said I was married on the 23rd of October 23. yes amen if you go and type out the prophet speaks about amen this man that he studied I forget his name can we remember his name amen he uh what's his name I'll get his name now amen

23rd of October [Music] amen so what year are we in Hallelujah 20 20. 3 [Music] amen for those of you know amen this church is excited because I'll tell you why now because we experi expecting to see

pastor Eugene Ashley preached and he preached on Grace and he was a blessed service amen we were all rejoicing after the service and I happened to meet Pastor Samuel at lunch and it was not even arranged it was all just happening I was on my way to pick up uh Pastor Eugene and then brother denzo formed he said don't worry I'll bring him and come and can we just have supper together so I said fine amen so we met and then lo and behold I met Pastor Samuel and his wife amen and I can't while we're eating I can't really asked him why don't you come for the service now I want you to know the brother is here on a rest break yes do you know how many churches there in Durban everyone would have snapped him out yes and he come here to preach we probably never have got a chance with the amount of people that would have wanted him to come in that one week amen so he came to the service and he said as long as I'm not preaching I'll come and enjoy the word but there was something about the preaching of the word that can revive a soul even a tired Soul amen yes yes so I am guilty many times of bringing people out of retirement and also bringing people out of the holidays amen you know no preaching is safe when they come for holidays so amen I think there was a pull from a different Brothers he up to the service and the brother amen he was talking to Pastor Denzel after the service I think on the way home and he mentioned that yes he does feel a child to come and preach okay now don't worry who's here who's not here yeah that's right yes the upper room only had a select few again amen I told you all of that to tell you this what's the date today and none of us knew we were going to be in service tonight yes that's right some of us don't know what they did tell them what the date is Brothers Denzel tell him love him some people don't work so you know when you don't work you'll lose track of days what's the date today so we have the Great Expectations because it's a Divine appointment amen you know even when the request came the flesh was trying to say no the flesh was strange and I will put it up for another time but something click and said submit to the holy spirit amen amen and therefore every brother amen amen and I tell you if you come an expectation tonight amen you shall see the Holy Ghost descend in such a measure through the preaching of the world but with power and demonstration amen also amen the past is Anointed he has a gift on his life you can pull from that gift yes but as the Holy Ghost is moving tonight I urge you to enter in and as you are seated there if you don't have the Holy Ghost say Lord give me the Holy Ghost amen if you need a refilling of the Holy Ghost the Lord can drop down and give you the Holy Ghost amen I've got one more

for us amen we want to submit the Holy Spirit I tell you if we can submit and all things are possible we have some great requests that we're going to bring before the Lord but I want the preaching of the word to go forth first amen Apostle Marvin is here and his dad is in hospital we're gonna pray for him amen is Pastor Andrew munsami we're going to pray that the Lord will touch him and heal him amen amen you know who's the closest to the heart of God and when his Queen makes a request he'll say what is my request even to off the kingdom amen when the queen makes a request so stand into the session for who knows you've been called for such a time as this my Uncle Reuben munsami also clinically ill if the Lord don't touch him he won't last for very long we're going to pray the Lord touch him how many of you have a need in the house of the Lord how many of you have a prayer request amen and I know the spirit of God is here to meet with us bless your name Jesus welcome Holy Spirit we

Spirit we are in your presence fill us with your powers [Music] live inside of me [Music] foreign [Music] just want to sing only believe I only believe the prophet of God says when that song was sung he did something in the meetings he said the angel of God responded to that song if you can get the top to believe then all things are possible not even cancer will be able to stand in your way amen church I want you to be sensitive to the spirit of God this evening oh please foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] only believe [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh Jesus is here [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] opportunity to greet you all the wonderfully for following Our Savior Jesus Christ we are still standing we could just obey our Bibles to the people of Exodus chapter 4 2 the week of Exodus chapter 14. amen hallelujah and then they reach [Music] I believe the story downloads the Bible says and when Pharaoh Junior the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold Egyptians matched after them they were so afraid in the children of Israel Pride unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt thou has taken us to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt thus with us to carry us from out of Egypt is this not the way that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone and we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness this is just at the beginning of the Exodus amen and this is the people under the Moses commission let's come to the Book of Joshua chapter one amen Joshua Festival Joshua chapter so we see when it comes to Joshua chapter 1 . before it gives them instructions in from verse 10 downwards so we shall read the reaction amen the people as he instructed by Joshua let's hear the reaction in verse 16. and it says and they answered Joshua saying all that thou has commanded us we will do amen and without sovereign Grace that has brought us together for it is not by our ability or our will the father We Believe before ordained it before the foundation we could meet in this manner in this mission in this particular geographic location yeah at this particular time amen we pray as your weight has been read speak to us touch Our Lives yes draw us closer to yourself Amen in the name of our Lord Our Savior Jesus Christ amen you may be seated by the same systems Amen Let me just take this moment to appreciate it by the way s that are taking you to stay before you say a few words it was not my intention I I had turned down [Music] invitation to preach elsewhere because I was just dreaming a lot of fatigue things just have been out and came to death and just arrested yesterday after we left signal you should preached for us and then as we left with Pastor Davidson on the way just after leaving the gate here I just began to become feel very restless [Music] I should come back I was aware that if I did not disclose it because foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] my favorite Services is when I'm sitting down like last night when Pastor Eugene was ministering and I can say Amen to someone or maybe just sneaking in a series of animals and hide somewhere there and and just enjoy myself yeah I always love that I mean because you know you sit there you feed a soul with spiritual food and also the Bible admonishes as it tells us do unto others what you want them to give them so if I don't preachers you're also sit down so and at one way so maybe you have to make him to owe us amen God bless you for such a lovely wonderful atmosphere amen which we enjoy it it made us future the weight last night amen you know you can go to places you can preach but there's sometimes services or places or churches where within five minutes you're asking for water you're not thirsty you're coughing but you're not suffering from flu and Corona and then you feel like there's arrows that deflate back that which you are trying to say until you feel like oh God let never be back to me bring me back to this place but it was so wonderful last night just to enjoy that wonderful Divine Supernatural atmosphere and a testimony uh that a brother was reciting and one that the pastor also hinted on very touching testimonies which really uh continually it it kind of uh uh helps us to realize that the things we believe are real it's not imagination amen it's things that are tangible right so tonight let's just speak a little bit on um why did The Exodus take so long and we want to look at Inhibitors attitude wonderful in this context so we find that the journey brother Brahman says from Egypt to Israel okay it was supposed to take one and a half hours if it was by car so that's roughly 150 kilometers yeah then he says the same Journey by foot was supposed to be three days then we realize that this journey which was supposed to be one and a half which was supposed to be three days it became 40 years now which translates to 14 000 days 14 400 Days and in hours the journey which was supposed to be one and a half hours if it was by automobile if it was our times it took about 345 600 hours close to half a million hours normal why did Jenny so short become so long was it the fault of God was it that the land was not real was said that was in the front of pharaoh was he was he obstructing them from entering into the promise was it fault [Music] was it too strong for Israel what was it the inheritance problem maybe that's what we need to look at yeah and established that the God who promised them this wonderful land was here he was all powerful and he already declared it's theirs so it cannot be his fault yes amen when it comes to Pharaoh Pharaoh and his army were totally defeated amen and there were not an obstruction for Israel to enter into the life was it the Canaanites that extended them from taking their place in the land of promise certainly not the Canaanites but the Bible had said that their defense had already patted from them so it leaves just one group of kids let's realize brothers and sisters that this inheritance this land was a real place it was not something theoretical it was not something which was imaginary amen hallelujah it's not just a claim it was a reality amen you know when you move around the cities there's areas where you find a sign preaching the way of a dog and there's this phase of a scaring Pitbull whatever they could the picture itself was scared you're going to knock anything and the weights rain Terror in your heart yeah you go inside some of these homes [Music] you will find that it's not dark amen no mouse amen maybe just a few cockroaches in the kitchen so they claim outside yes in the reality inside are different yeah amen promise was not just a dream yeah it was something real important yeah man I think of a little experience we used to have as little children I believe in the mid 70s you know rural home where we grew up there was this neighbor in the for in the bush in the farming area he had a lot of old scrap cars which were no longer functional and no wheels they'll be suspended on logs and on Stones so we could go there and chill and sneak out because they were not inside the yard they were just outside uh in the around the trees and so on so we got there we begin to say each one chooses his car we are going to do car racing and then you know you start sitting on an imaginary chair and then you start an imaginary Engine with your mouth you say and then from there you begin to rev this imaginary car and you're holding a steering that doesn't yeah and then you start saying I'm overtaking I'm overtaking I have won the race but you know after all the drama and all the noise you discover that it's nothing which is real yeah yeah there's just a claim it's not tangible yeah it's all imagination Because by the end of all the noise and the trauma and everything you are still at the same place where you were here where you began to play with your friends yeah but my brother my sister I want to assure you tonight that the land of promise was real amen the land was tangible then the Bible tells us we have an inheritance we have anything any general inheritance and this inheritance is real to us amen is touchable amen just like faith is not imagination faith is something touchable life is something real yeah so we see brothers and sisters that these people are told that there's a man amen that belongs to them and it's an inheritance yes in no inheritance is something you have not went to yeah yeah something you did not went for but it's given to you for free but you can accept inheritance or refuse the Heritage the choice is always in Your Hair amen amen but we thank God we have any channel inheritance amen amen now let's realize that God had already given uh Abraham the boundaries of the land that he gave him it was all detailed and described in the Book of Genesis and we find that you guys told the River on the south is one border below that is Egypt and then he was told uh Another River in phrase but you must not Israel was told when you get to that man of Promise don't go beyond the Great River new friends because Beyond inference is is Babylon it's confusion It's ability I tell you my brother my sister at pays to stay within the boundaries inheritance landmarks it head boundaries and as long as a Jew was inside the boundaries of this land yeah he was he was undefeated yes because it's your place and you have advantage against the enemy because it's why you really belong and when you are there your power and jurisdiction and Authority ah man you cannot be shaken by anything else amen absolutely as long as you know this is my inheritance and the brothers of what belongs to me so that's why if we we are going back to the city of caporali Botswana maybe from Johannesburg if we are driving and then we see a police officer stops us but he's waiting for another police uniform uh we are not obligated to stop yes because amen if we stop we might just stop out of courtesy out of battery to this part to him to say please do you know geography yeah you're outside yeah yes outside a place of your Authority amen you are outside your boundaries you're outside your jurisdiction please just pick your things stop shaming Us return back to [Music] You Know The Enemy the devil the amount your roadblock in your own inheritance where you really belong yeah you're not obligated to stop you should be able to tell you something to say I'm not talking about anything I have power I have jurisdiction I have authority to extend this promise it must have been the name of the Lord of Israel is in just a little background we are told by the Bible in The Book of Leviticus 18. that nothing that defiles was to be brought into this land amen amen right because the god of the land you had his principles of how the people that live in this land should believe amen and the Bible says those that defile it this land vomits its inhabitants out so the land was a vomiting land amen does that Define them it it vomited them out think of when Israel defiled This Land part of the Kingdom of Israel was vomited to Assyria and another part later [Music] yeah they rejected Jesus defiled the lamb yes and the land vomited them to All Nations [Music] doesn't don't you think of the message of the hour those that try to Define it yes amen amen amen so my brother my sister let me read this quotation as we begin Brother program says God never did deal with Israel till she cut to her Homeland hear me thus say of the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to her amen yes the message of the Hour come back to the original amen get away from your Methodist Baptist Presbyterian in your Pentecostal assemblies Oneness threeness and fiveness whatever it may be whatever it is Church of God Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Church of Christ all Antichrist movements amen thank you men in every one of them godly people in every one of the movements but the organization in itself is not of God and God will never bless it he has never done it so now realize he says the Homeland for the church for the bride is the message Gabriel's instructions to Daniel that is amazing thing visible unit of the bride of Christ amen decides these words says the pilgrim fathers were thankful for the Newfound way of life amen being separated from the old English denominations and treats they could marry the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed worked for their age for their day so weak so can we be thankful experience like Abraham separated from the Saints of the world all of our Associates Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all that religions I'm speaking Across the Nation all the treats and to what so you're separated us from dead kids you're separated us from denominations we have been called out of the Babylon amen amen but God cannot call you from something and leave you hanging inside he calls you out of something and places so he called us to work separated us and opened to us and you land and you message for this day so in this context of the invisible Union brother is bring it to our attention that the new land whereby we are separated unto is the message Hallelujah the new message of this day so brothers and sisters Israel was a nation in Exodus and the parallel between two there's a lot that we can learn from amen now let's realize that brothers and sisters when God commissioned Moses Moses commission was to take them out of Egypt but Joshua's commissioned us to take them yeah yeah amen amen look at this Philip brought Nathaniel to Jesus Jesus Took Philippine [Music] to him when he saw Nathaniel coming to him but yet they were walking side by side we see him but the Bible specifies only Nathaniel but remember that Philip had already believed he had already extracted Christine and then feel to connect him I believe that's what the pastor was saying last night you said the world can work on a person and say goodness Jesus Peter to Jesus Jesus took him in in one account of the Gospel does somebody tell woman testify to her people and Jesus brought them into the gospel by speaking to them amen when we bring people to Jesus Jesus Takes them into today [Applause] he places is [Applause] amen now watch this brothers and sisters there's always been better for land because the first war in the Bible one of the festivals on land I mean on Earth was a battle a quarter Overland ibraham's Shepherds visitors yeah let's check but it was crazy land uh because the land cannot be expanded it's finite you know it's limited like that and then you know you have to push someone because you can't extend the land and then the lead cannot be relocated if you have a bad neighbor no matter how much you groan and cry as they say you can choose a wife you can choose a car you can choose a job but the country is a neighbor yeah right you somehow find yourself next time neighbor if it's a dreadful neighbor he's a dreadful neighbor and because land cannot be relocated you cannot get angry and uh uh kind of put your car I mean your house with a a giant JCP or excavator and relocate it to another place the best is you might sell the property go and live somewhere else but you cannot believe okay that particular specific piece of property so that's why the land is good always a source of conflict and War because it cannot be expanded and it cannot be relocated and my brother my sister if we take it in the context of the message you cannot start explaining over stretching the message and we say things that really are no longer scripture amen we cannot end we cannot subtract the word Remains the Same forever because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen that's why we see that uh the issue of shortage of land throughout history has been a cause of migration at times and we see that sometimes people migrate because they want a better pastures and when we thank God that the Lord leads us to Green Pastures besides amen amen they want better water but we have Fountain of Living Water planted by the water they look for a better fertile land to bring forth fruit amen but the world has been planted in our soul which is the good ground for the way to manifest they want maybe better grazing land like a world and fruits and grapes of the land but you know in The Inheritance we have everything we have need of is there they are looking for resources maybe better resources minerals and sources of resources for our needs but I tell you what brother my sister in the kingdom of God we don't have we don't need anything outside it amen amen everything we have need of is already inside again of The Incorruptible seed of God brother says all we have needed for this journey is already inside you if you're good on your body amen so let's realize that if you have a piece of land that has got this uh boundaries and so on everything inside it belongs to you amen all the minerals all the mountains all the rivers everything inside there belongs to you but you have got to know your inheritance you need to survey your inheritance you need to properly know your landmarks you need to properly know all the boundaries if you don't know the enemy will come and cut a piece of your land then you just keep on saying impossible 15 helpers now if it's like it's 14 what is it or you might not even notice anything because you don't know you learn much ah man blessed be the name of the Lord and my brother my sister let's meditate upon the word of God day and night so that we can know the length and bread of our Heaven yes sir so that we can know what belongs to us so that if the enemy tries to part of what belongs to you then my Divine Healing from you and take away Joy from you [Applause] try your smile Jesus Christ happiness is not salvation is mine you can stand your ground because you know you know your inheritance the breath and the land of inheritance and my brother my sister we realize that even denominational people they sometimes feel like something is not right among them and then unfortunately the loudestian age it's um it talks about their blind and they are naked and Ratchet and miserable and programs is the scaling things and they don't know it since that part is very scary and now think of someone who is blind and naked and wretched and miserable in the ages don't say attack each so blind men in darkness trying to survey and not identify the landmarks [Music] and it goes like I found it and it's not a new movement he calls it back to God Ministries then another one out of this one feels like things are not right he's a blind man in darkness he also begins to try to identify the real thing and then he says I found it aha I found it I found it then it calls it maybe Spirit everybody see your Christ them I see whatsoever you know Chinese are certain of names until the names some of them are ridiculous some of them are very strange sometimes even hear of a helicopter Church of God it's just Choice assaulted it's just explaining it's just blind people in darkness right or identify the original landmarks but my brother my sister you don't need a blind person to do something yeah yeah you need someone with technical knowledge you need someone with eyesight someone with the right equipment and thank God through all the church ages we see that denominations fired a lot of rubble of our inheritance until we lost track of 1 million knew exactly how to use this equipment and by the grace of God he has located because all the mystery of God is finished and completed by this delighted amen until now all the brothers and the landmark civil inheritance has come to blame you amen that's why my brother my sister and the hour we live in we have no excuse we should not be we should not say to God in our time because all the mystery of God has been blessed and brought to our attention in terms of the revelation of the word if they don't understand something in the message don't say it's not open just say Brethren ah TV is not yet open to me it's not yet revealed there you go if the seventh angel finishes I think this other seal is not open amen because then the question becomes um brother random did not just preach the Seven Seals he preached The Refuge yes but the revelation of the Seven Seas so if I don't understand any of them I should not Proclaim it's not open as you just said to me I remember God in his time he shall reveal it to you but to Elijah all the entire mystery has been opened yeah ah man God help us hey amen so this land that is our inheritance let's quickly rush to me the people under Moses Commission now we see that under Moses they just thought the Excellence with mammary this is what makes the land which is so so near becomes so far yes [Music] they expecting Virginia with memory and complaining instead of trusting God and brother Brahman says God let them through that root so that he could show the reason my teeth this is a place where my brother my sister god with his mighty hand open the Red Sea amen and the Bible says he made the waters the world unto the water oh yes now I don't know anyone who is a water engineer here who can make it them where the water becomes the wall unto the water is not possible with God says Moses when he says stand still and see the salvation of the Lord what they needed was to stand still yeah because before them is the Red Sea behind this Furious Army besides his mountains it was like they are colored and the enemy was laughing said yeah you are finished but he had problem one in front problem two mayor hiding problem number three on the side so God opens problem number one and then Red Sea opens and brother brothers is when they Stood Still God made their trouble to stand still in salute for them amen salute and Flinch yes and you see I behave like it knew the DNA of the people that are passing amen blessed be the name of the Lord and my brother in your time of Trouble Don't Panic stand still even see this conversation send the signal to the heavens God will make your camera to stand still into it assumes that ah a way it's been made for us they die they dive in and God just waited for them and they go in and hit this way it's only made for God's children Israelites amen and when the last two have crossed it was like the water did another DNA examination this is different [Music] but who are you and the waters because that was not there where my brother my sister but realize how Israel is starting a journey with just my money can you think after this they'll stop it sometimes the promises of God which are so real it becomes so far from us yes amen many times to do with our approach and our attitude yes amen now this was chapter 14 in chapter 15. after this sound a great song after they sing a song of Victory after they saw the dead Egyptians floating in the waters then there's no water to drink I didn't even should have said Victory is my yeah Victory Is Ours literally today is my man they should have said this situation another miraculous amen yes in Exodus 15 24 maybe if you could just cast it for us there the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink they are moving from amateurs they're about along the way you see them become professional mammals and then later they become Champion amen [Music] and the genie becomes [Music] so they say what shall we do and we see that in the wilderness against Moses and Aaron honey could help us and what shall we drink I believe the water had become bitter yes the water was bitter amen and yet just a moment there was a tree just around yeah that could sweet in the water yes it was not far it was within the age as a tree of life brother continue your bitter life into Sweet Life Hallelujah it was right by examine the Wilderness nearby and the solution to any situation we face is always nearby for when God answers afraid someone is praying when they were hungry and they needed manner God did not Reigns they have to go kilometers hundreds of kilometers to go and collect the mother it fell the right way God help us [Music] and when they needed Jericho to be taken over God brought the solution right there brought down the Walls when they needed to Cross Jordan God did not open the Waters of of a river you afraid somewhere far there and then I'll go and go like these little circles he just opened exactly the right way and when Goliath needed to be brought down God did not bring a hittite to someone else he just brought a little David so he said the midst of Israel the solution was within Israel amen and he brought down Goliath and my brother my sister I would like to say just like Daniel said there's a man in the Kingdom he's not outside anything you need is you are within the kingdom there is a man in the Kingdom who can turn your Sorrows into Joy he is not far from you so sometimes people say no you know I wish I was living in another country I wish I was in another city in that fellowship and that you just live in the world of wishes God's Solutions are right where you are amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so it's always important to stop wishing and start living and start being realistic and start believing God that God I believe where I live and where I Fellowship where in the city I live in this is why you will take me to stay and I will stay here and I know that Lord needs I have I have you'll take care of them right where I am otherwise you become an anti-music tourist amen when we just strikes One Church the bills you know the the natural the flight where it's warm they skip the winter here amen and then when they get there they don't realize that it's for that place also operates on seasons they get there when it's warm and rise and then it's all done they say oh it's wonderful I'm happy I'm here after a little while oh it just drives there then they they fly to another place I tell you it's important to be always part of the solution until at the end people churches like stockings ah man God help us the solution is always there all it takes is the right attitude towards the promises of God the word of God we have the right attitude towards it and the right attitude towards the gifts of God it brings about the results amen and then we see in Exodus 17 so Exodus 14 day Mama Exodus 15 uh the water is bitter and then Mama again Exodus chapter 17 there was lack of water and the Bible says maybe if we read verse two wherefore the the people did chai which means to quarrel with Moses saying give us water let me make dream and Moses said unto them one child with me therefore do you tempt the Lord amen so then China cuddled with the prophet the church that they call it with the messenger of their time they chatted with the Exodus message God help us brothers and sisters at any time never to cuddle with the Exodus Prophet but to believe the message he brought to us because we know this message brothers and sisters has not men's Ingenuity it's not some theological uh stuff could have been a theological part somewhere called the Bible school but we know this is the absolute true revelation of Jesus Christ in our day amen may God help us never to child with the message that's why sometimes some rise up and he starts saying I've been in the message eight years and now realize it's not a true gospel uh maybe put this like it's a CV you know kind of but I tell you we don't know the message of Malachi for after the flesh even if someone can come from Jeffersonville Indiana and tell us no because when there was no Prophet he's my my father's cousin actually when he died I was old I was one of his that held his casket and all that even if he can prove means that they are related while telling we are too late the water is we don't know this message after the French but this is in Recreation of Jesus Christ just like if someone Rises up and comes from Bethlehem of Judah and says I am a descendant of millions and Mary and Joseph I had the story of Jesus was just created by our family to immortalize our name in the changes of history and begins to say I tell you there was never any man called Jesus we will tell him we are sorry we realize you're at you we feel pity for you yes but we shall not believe your story because we know that Jesus is Alive we have experience we know Lord Jesus after the flesh but we know him by Revelation amen yes yes so the child with Moses and then we see that the place we hear of the place being called meriba which means strife and Masa which is Temptation where this whole scenario took place amen God help us then in Exodus 16 we see that there was a time when they had no food and the whole communication came again to Moses maybe let's go read this one brothers and sisters Exodus chapter 16 verse 2 I'll try to be quick I won't take long Exodus chapter 16 verse 2 and the whole complication of the children of Israel Mama against Moses and I don't need the Wilderness and the children of Israel said unto them with God that we had died by the head of Moses of the Lord in the land of Egypt when he was sent by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the food you have brought us uh forth into this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with amen now they are complaining but they have seen God opened the Red Sea they have seen God bring down the plagues in Egypt they have seen God open the Red Sea they have seen brothers and sisters God take bitter wanted to Sweet Waters they've seen God Supply water for them from Iraq amen now this is the time where they should be believing God even much more and when they see any challenge they should be saying thank God this is before us very soon we shall see the mighty hand of God the Bible are my sister they are now becoming professional mammers because it looks like it's becoming their occupation and preoccupation amen God help us never to have to have that kind of spirit amen this is the kind that could never enter into the promised land this is the time that God made to wander in the wilderness of 40 years when we thank God there was another generation that began to rise up in the generation building just run to the job tonight [Applause] hey man so we see them two months after leaving Egypt they begin to Mama about lack of food and issues of hunger but yet heaven was ready to supply them with food on daily basis and they are talking about the flesh there's so much in the flesh that they may think about the flesh parts of Egypt God help us yes then we see when they come to numbers 11 the Bible says there was a lasting among the children of Israel and they wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat they were not tired of money I mean they said we remember the fish we didn't eat in Egypt feeling the Cucumbers the melons the leeks the onions the garlic they remember the manual of Israel of Egypt by memory yes oh my brother my sister I tell you we don't need to remember the menu of Egypt I tell you we have better food and there's a land of promise we have spiritual food in due season and we see that they will now becoming tired of the manner that God gave them God help us never to get tired of what God gives us and my brother my sister they were out of Egypt but Egypt was not out of them amen see it's one thing to take someone out of the water when they are drowning it's another thing to pump water out of them you can take water out so it's one thing to come out of denomination out of Egypt out of Babylon out of the world Egypt it's another thing process for the Egypt to come out of us for baby not to come out of us amen and you can imagine a man drowning in a swimming pool or in a sea and you dive in you swim you pull him out then when it's fully resuscitated after a few days he starts telling you that even though you rescued him but the way you assuming was not according to International standards of swimming your big Strokes you're not correct your anger and your orientation so imagine this message of Malachi 4 rescued us when we were drowning denominations and so on and then after when someone says to Malachi for that no even though you rescued me but however the way you did it the method the methodology the process the work ah man God bless you God help us amen then we see them in Numbers Chapter 14 they they begin to murmur about the Giants of the land by this time they have become fully professional yes they are becoming Mama rights amen so God came the money Mama God kept on extending their Journey because that kind cannot enter into the promised land yes blessed be the name of the Lord and then we see the mammary about water and bread in numbers 21 and God sent seconds to bite them and my brother my sister this is the kind that they behaved like they were in an accident like they are forced like it was not their choice to agree to go out saving God was a big big this is the kind that every time they want Moses to do everything for them but they don't want to do anything for themselves this is the kind that God could not allow to enter into the promise amen yes but praise be to God when you're reading Joshua chapter 1. we see a totally different way amen amen we see that Joshua commands these people and they respond and say all that you command us to do we shall do yeah I know this way actually [Music] they're not like real parents only goes a space you push it when you leave it even after 10 years you find it there unless you a cyclone comes to blow it away [Music] yes the Joshua commission amen there was this generation this generation they never saw uh the place fall in Egypt this generation that did not hear the First Health commission of long suits this generation that we're not there when Moses descended from the mountain they were not yet born but they believe it when God showed roses they believe it like they had the voice of God permission most amen amen amen this is the time that enters into the premise they believe everything yes they thank God at this word and they are their inheritance minded they mind about eternity Promise by all means blessed be the name of the Lord so we see under Moses era as we try to summarize these people under Moses they will just complaining about death and Graves and they had a lot of memories of Egypt and comparisons and and they they were just like it was a very difficult church I tell you two million people Moses the men of the world no matter there is a time when he strikes The Rock it's just too much pressure and brother Branham tells us that it was just the way more people treated Moses it got to a point where instead of speaking to the Rock the men is so much pressure until he lost feeling for them and Etc I tell you Moses was a great man two million people he was the pastor of 2 million people amen yes sir God gave him a very strong wife and we also at times begin [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord then we see that under Moses it was just a memory generation very argumentative they were the fault finding time they could not be instructed there were just two rules about things they could not enter into the end to God's rest they were a disrespectful generation you know there's a they call Moses as for this Moses we don't know what the spirit amen and I'm calling the prophet like that and even the Pharisees calling Jesus as for this fellow I'm in the same language yes have they behaved as if they were first to come forced by Moses to come out of Egypt they were behaving like spiritual teenagers if they they neither know Moses neither is commission but these are the people that should have believed them Moses much more because they saw the glory of God upon his face and that's all the glory of God witness my brother my sister they saw the place called upon Egypt yes he said the ones that you have made the younger ones they believe even much more amen but help us I tell you my brother my sister there is not how long we have been in the message it's not how shocked you have been in the message is is the message really inside me yeah inside me amen blessed be the name of the Lord yes by Moses when he said let there be fleas when he said let that be fraught when he said let there be toughness but I promise that was the manifestation and there was a squeeze amen so the Red Sea open they were a stressful generation they wanted Moses to do everything for them while they do nothing and if this kind crossed the river Jordan to go into the Promised Land as soon as they cross their Victory Moses give us the land Moses show us the landmarks Moses Drive the Giants out Moses give us the old color of the land Moses give us the waters away The Well of waters Moses it was going to behave everything books is different the problem says God does not want us to be lazy Chris yes we must never be in spiritually Christians yes they behave like selfish spoiled children they did not have the inheritance mentality but let's compare with those that enter the promised land amen blessed be the name of the Lord under Joshua this this generation they are not memory generation non-argumentative they could be instructed they were very serious about things amen amen and we can see the head that possess us inheritus life even the way they speak they behave as if they are the ones who initiated the actions like they are the ones who said let's go out damn it and yet they were not born yes God blessed in the name of the Lord oh my brother my sister many of us here we only hear about brother but we were not alive we never had the privilege of seeing him we never had the privilege of hearing himself a million person amen and we only see the message many years after years passed but when is he fully revealed to you you behave like you are the one that was there it cleansed me that I came with him he becomes so real to you it becomes so tangible it becomes something so real until you believe the message with all your heart like that black Americans here old man who said I believe it's from keeper to Keeper Time discover to clever from the cover of the Bible to the other cover says I even believe where it is [Music] and they uh they were young but they behaved like spiritual adults they behaved as if they were with Moses when God gave commissioned him with the Benin Bush experience they behaved as if they were there when the third pool was manifested in Egypt when Moses said let there be fleas Let There Be frogs Let There Be Darkness they behaved as if when there's a Red Sea open they were there ah man this is the kind that enters this is the kind that works by faith when they saw a pharaoh and his army the Bible says they saw I mean they lifted up their eyesight but this kind that enters into the promised land they don't walk by sight and Promises because faith is a Super Saiyan it puts your senses in the body under subjection faith and the prophet says it's a superior sense it puts even the senses in your spirit imagination and all others and the subjection and it tells them shut up amen [Applause] they were action oriented that's why we see that some of them the tribes even took their inheritance even before Joshua says take your inheritance they begin to say Hey where's my Heritage then we see Joshua begins to preach to some say arise possessive inheritance and they begin to go around to survey the land because seven tribes were not yet taking their land and they come with a book a book it says in seven Parts they they describe the land in a seven part book amen amen and they take the entire land they had the inheritance mentality like the people of the Times of Israel amen when you said we shall tell us we shall arise and do something amen so with Moses their view of him was that this is a menu because out of Egypt he must ensure that all is well with us he must do everything for us when we do nothing they treated Moses like he was a magician who should miraculously provide them with water with everything while they do nothing this is the kind they did to perish in the wilderness but these people are the Joshua they treated Joshua as a leader that they must follow but they are co-workers they had to fight the Giants of the land we see John Caleb can you say give me my money [Music] this is the way we should approach and every promise in the word of God my brother my sister why your son give me my Mountain I'm walking dead Caleb was not interested in Mount Ephraim he was not even interested in Mount evil or somewhere there but he was interested in his heart you hear a short joke so if you give me my mountain foreign [Music] [Applause] like players in the game they were not spectators it was a spectator it's not a player a spectator is a stop saving he's imagining things a spectator is a Critic a spectator yeah it appears very easy from a distance That's How The Spectator looks at it but I tell you the generation that entered into the promised land they were in place with Christ in the Kingdom that when something is being done for the glory of God someone must rise up and say where is my part in this let me also movement and if it's the mentality only people under Moses these are the kind that wants everybody to visit them they visit no one they want everybody to pray for them they pray for God yes but they are in sorrow they want everybody to comfort them but they Comfort no one [Music] [Music] until they all perished in the wilderness yes sir yes [Music] [Music] he says because of unbelief amen so the the the length of the time stretching from instead of three days to 40 days 40 years it was to do with their approach to the promise that is laid before them may God help us brothers and sisters to realize that whatsoever promised we have before us all we should do is to have the right attitude and much into our inheritance yeah now let's let me read this quotation here brother Brian says in Jehovah Jireh and remember you can write me down on me Mark me down on the paper of time and put it in the history when I am passed on that's when I appear in the Judgment bar I say this that every promise of God in the Bible is true so the promise of getting into the promised land it was true the god of Israel was Almighty all-powerful and now he has manifested himself in their time as Jehovah Jehovah means the one that dwells with his family he was not away from them he was right in their Mysteries amen thank you Lord amen amen can be tender nights yeah their defensive departed from them so the challenge was really on the inheritance amen so every promise in the Bible is true and if you take the right mental attitude towards any different promise of God the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God it will bring it to us amen no matter how big the promise is no matter how small the promise is as long as is the promise of God and there's a right mental attitude it will come to pass oh God help us brothers and sisters when it's salvation whether it's healing whether it's anything deliverance from any condition the right mental attitude will bring you to pass amen this is what makes a difference between people in any assembly there are some that will have testimonies of what God is doing in them in their lives right in the church whether in the service whether in their homes there are some that keep on this video right is this thing real you know what this brother is saying this money [Music] history I think of a time when our child was sick we traveled to Zambia for a youth camp about 19 years ago in you know he said let me pray for the child then I saw the pastor who was the host pastor of the camp passing then I thought ah the man of God is passing so I went with my wife and we took the past the child to the pastor and he just prayed for the child and immediately the child got went and started playing amen jumping everywhere amen and yet I could have said okay let me just also pray for him because I'm a minister but I thought ah the name of God is here nearby let me just pass this time to here but it's to do with our attitude yes yes and God help us to have always the right attitude towards any Divine yes we will also tell you the right mental attitude towards any of God's gifts amen amen also makes you amen whether it's a Teaching Ministry whether it's an evangelist whether it's pastoral whether it's Apostolic the right mental attitude and even the right mental attitude between us as Believers one-on-one wife and husband when your wife says let me pray for you and you say ah you really you of 24 hours it won't work because you have locked up amen your mental attitude in such a way that you don't believe it but if he says honey let me pray for you and he said hey I've been thinking about that and then she lays heads on you God is able to give you blessed be the name of the Lord if your husband says let me pray for you let me say uh you the other day you angry with me do you think that God can hear prayers and people like you that will not work yes and the blockade is caused by governmental attitude yeah but if we can really have confidence is the hardest thing for God to do is to make men to have confidence in the other man amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord God help us so he says it will bring you to pass remember don't forget that if you personally you take the right mental attitude towards any of the Divine promises it will come to us now let's take a conclusion here let's go to Joshua chapter 17. amen remember we're trying to compare people under Moses people and Joshua yes what need those that entered into it Joshua chapter 17 verse 14 to 15. the Bible says in the children of Joseph speak unto Joshua saying why has thou given me but one lot and one person to inherit saying seeing I am a great people for as much as the Lord had blessed me hitherto so the children of Joseph after all others have been given the inheritance they feel like they are not is not enough somehow they believe they were still somebody somewhere I believe that our might should not freeze we should always believe this is more to the experiences we can have with Christ so all you have experienced is not the end of everything even as Jesus said to Nathaniel just because I told you I saw you under the Fig Tree when before Philip called me you believe me you shall see greater things yourself this is what they end your sin of the Messiah the second problem but behold you shall see Angels descending in the city [Applause] don't ever leave it toward my brother my sister no matter what you've experienced no matter what you've encountered in his presence I tell you God is more ready to give us more and more money do you experiences in his presence yesterday so they believed there was more that they could also receive federal now I want us to come to the event the words of Joshua he says and Joshua answered them if thou be a great people then get the app to the world country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the parasites and of the Giants if Mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee this is what Joshua is saying to this if what I have given you you feel like it's not sufficient there is more land but I express you I'm not going to cut for you amen amen amen amen to have access don't need to be there as Joshua you can go ahead Joshua is giving them an instruction Joshua is authorizing them to say the land is enough there's plenty go ahead and cut for thyself and he doesn't give them a limit to say after so many kilometers end there as much as long as you can cut for yourself keep on cutting for yourself and I'll tell you my brother my sister in our spiritual land the message of the hour amen everything you have need of is right in the word of God even if salvation is there if you need rest your soul is there forgiveness of sin healing of your soul healing of your body joyous it's all yes Hallelujah but for you to be a benefactor go and cut for this yeah so if you want the Holy Ghost God for yourself you have to believe if you want joy cut [Music] yes don't ever come to this state where you take some things for granted and just resigned to him if a negative fate and say you know this is our disease in our family it is about history [Music] this is my this is my depression this is my confusion this is my you know when you say something is yours it means you own it then the question becomes do you have any proof it's yours any document ation that this is the reason why [Music] think of this yes academic extract comes and after it loads will grab it reverses right into your yard and the Cabbage man begins to Institute the Trap is smelling truck and tries to offload the cabbage if he dumps that cabbage yourself it has never been used the Cabbage from the truck you just you just happened to try to tell you heard into a main field but if you have a titled it for that piece of crown no matter whether the man is towering tall yeah even if you're tiny any woman you can stand up to him and say what is it stop it amen no idea Toppings is not weird try next door [Music] you know what belongs to you and you know that this doctor did gives me Authority and power and if he insists that he's going to do it you have the power to summon the wrong trust to come in and fast your rights amen blessed be the name of the Lord so don't ever say my my sorrow my what my heart amen blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus never said my soul I give unto you my restlessness I give unto you my sickness I give unto you amen my confusion I give unto you but Jesus is my peace I give unto you and joy I give unto you my rest I give unto you this is what Jesus saying that if the enemy brings something else he just remember that he's trying to make you attempt inside you have the power like those and the Joshua's commission to say no no no no this is not mine mine is a land fruits fluffs with milk and honey mind is well I have everything salvation of my soul that's why I have healing of my soul that's why I have everything amen I must have a mind and an attitude to possess and enter to that promise that's what was the difference it's what made such a short Journey such a long journey my brother my sister sometimes we say I've been praying to receive the Holy Ghost for so long why is God not filling me with the Holy Ghost sometimes [Music] we say why is what not but yet it might be to do this yes yes you don't believe it enough oh our mental attitude for our mental black we have preconceived ideas of what the Holy Ghost is you cannot receive the Holy Ghost until you know who the Holy Ghost is and what he does when he has come amen amen sometimes you see I've been praying why am I not eating healed if God is Not testing for your faith because he also sometimes can test he can try your faith and the drivers is the time of your faith if it's like that maybe it might be where we doubt a bit we we we we we begin to think maybe it will awake when God wants maybe when he's happy God help us brothers and sisters we have a real inheritance it's within our reach is within our axis any one of us we can have faith enough even like this that is Peter white is yet speak these words the may God help us and may God bless you richly that we should be that kind of Generation all who you tell us we shall do wherever you send us we shall do we shall go and that kind is the ones that entered into the promised land may God bless you richly amen God bless you pastors [Applause] [Music] amen you appreciate the word of the Lord amen let's Stand Together Hallelujah let's give the Lord a good answer for praise amen hallelujah amen amen the land of our inheritance amen are we living in the land are we walking in the land do we know the length and breadth of the lamb and let me ask you what is our inheritance amen [Music] the Holy Ghost is our inheritance do we know the length the breadth of the Holy Ghost do we know his workings amen amen if it's our inheritance to be possess it but Branham says the only one that's going in the Rapture is the man of the Holy Ghost amen God the token amen I believe on the token now that we can answer those questions if we are walking in the land I mean if you want to make a claim tonight [Music] there's many gifts of the Holy Spirit one the working of Miracles the word of knowledge amen we've had the revelation of the word tonight and after the preaching of the word amen comes through worship Hallelujah and true worship can only come thank you when we know who he is even as Daniel prophesied that the shall come of people in the last days that know that God shall do great exploits amen amen I want you to just be reverent in his presence the Lord does not manifest himself through the preaching of his word because the word brings revelation and what the Revelation comes power [Music] holy ghost power is here if you have a need you want to raise your hand at this time amen even as we mentioned a few prayer requests before we started if you want to raise your hand you can stand in the gap do you know one time they came a man to Jesus and his servant was sick at home maybe his servant didn't even know what was going on because the Bible says he was sick unto death he didn't even know where his master was he didn't know his master was gone all the way to see Jesus to ask for his healing somebody that you love probably don't even know that you are in his presence right now can stand in the Gap and say Lord I have somebody in need and Lord you don't even have to go there but you can just speak the word and it shall be so the Bible says the very same hour that Jesus spoke that word the servant was healed I ask you can you raise up to that level of Faith because Jesus said I've never seen such great faith in all of Israel amen amen hallelujah for those of you that have Beyond raised and you need a touch from the Lord amen how many of you have a second body and need a touch from the Lord can I see your hand amen anybody sit near the touch from the Lord anybody seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost anybody seeking a refilling of the Holy Ghost [Music] and while we have the men of God remember what the pastor just said now our attitude our mind and our attitude towards the things of God look at what the angel told the prophet if you can get the people to believe you yes he says not even cancer will be able to stand in your way and I tell you we haven't been called to this service for no reason because [Music] the Lord wants to move in a special way but can we allow him to move you've heard the message tonight are we willing to allow the spirit of God to move amen hallelujah [Music] he touched me and know he touched me and hold the drawer that floods my soul I know something is happening and now I know he touched me and me [Music] foreign [Music] oh I will never see to praise him I'll shout [Music] Mighty turn [Music] your singing touch me he touched me oh I the joy that floods my soul today oh something and now I can't try amen can we all just talk to the Lord can we just begin to give him praise and thanks let's begin to thank you for the word that has come to our amen let's begin to appreciating amen the message we're gonna pray in this in the spirit amen Hallelujah hear it amen forget the car [Music] up here in Hallelujah to be men in a special way Hallelujah [Music] was the age of my life oh we bless your name Lord Jesus [Music]
