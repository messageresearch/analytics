========================================

let's give the Lord a good anap of praise God is great and greatly to be praised this morning amen hallelujah amen so we were dealing on the opening up of spiritual Frontiers and we know that we are not in an ordinary time in season there's a frontier that's been open to us a new land been open to us under the seventh seal amen hallelujah so we want to take back everything that belongs to us amen amen so we'll turn to 1 Samuel chapter 30 this morning praise the Lord amen our God is good amen our god is awesome amen 1 Samuel chapter 30 amen we'll read a portion of scripture and then we'll be seated then we'll continue reading amen now this is David's final battle before Saul is killed and you know once Saul is killed he's going to be stated as king amen so it's his one of his last battles that he's fighting before he becomes king and it came to pass when David and his men were come to zlac on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and Zig and smitten Zig and burnt it with fire now what what a reception to come to you're out in battle you're coming home to your family you're coming home to see them and you find the city burned with fire not only that and had taken the woman captive that were therein and slew not any even great or small but carried them away and went on their way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burnt with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives amen then David's and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep so this was no ordinary thing this really affected the men how can their woman they were going out to battle to form a protection over them but while fighting the battle the enemy had slipped in an burned the city and taken them captive and David's two wives were taken captives a Noam the jezrael itis and Abigail the wife of nabal the calite amen praise the Lord Abigail means my father's Joy so they took away David's Joy there and we know that the joy of the Lord is our strength Wednesday night we were speaking on out to have to your faith virtue which is strength power amen I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength praise the Lord and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord is God amen amen so you got to have a word within you to be able to encourage yourself yes amen nobody else is coming to offer encouragement they want to kill him and David said to abatha the priest am son I pray thee bring me either the he and ABA brought to of the eph for to David and David inquired at the Lord shall I pursuit after the tro shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all amen yes Lord that's the word of the Lord David can go out with an assurance he's going to recover all you may be seated the Lord at blessings to the reading of his word amen praise the Lord amen just to catch David's thoughts in the Psalms if you can go to Psalm 35 regarding this and we'll see how David was engaged in battle and what he really did here when he prayed amen Psalm 35 if you can go to it you know David wrote Psalms regarding his life's journey and the battles he was facing praise the Lord amen we'll read here when he's when he's Consulting the Lord he says plead my cause oh Lord with them that strive with me fight against them that fight against me take hold of shield and Buckler and stand up for my help draw out th the spear and stop the way against them that persecute me say unto my soul I am thy salvation Amen Let Them Be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devis my hurt now I pray that you're not just thinking about David I'm talking about the demon powers that have been Unleashed upon the Earth that are P that amen that want to come out to you that want to cause you arm he says let them be as shf before the wind and let the angel of the Lord chase them amen now you remember last week's service seen and unseen worlds our strategic Alliance yeah with the Unseen World yes right so watch what Avid is praying send the angel of the Lord to chase them Hallelujah yes now if David can commission that how about Sons and Daughters of God who been filled with the Holy Ghost let their way be dark and slippery and let the angel of the Lord persecute them amen thank you for without cause they have hit for me their net in a pit which without cause they have died for my soul let Destruction come upon him at unawares and let his net that he had he catch himself in that very destruction let him fall and my soul shall be joyful in the Lord it shall rejoice in his salvation all my bones shall say Lord who is like unto thee who deliveres the poor from him that is too strong for him y the poor and the needy for him that spoiled him false Witnesses did rise up they laid to my charge things that I knew not they rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sacko I humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into my own bosom I behave myself as though he had been my friend or brother I bowed down heavily as one that mourned for his mother but in but in my adversity they rejoiced and gather themselves together yay the objects gathered themselves together against me and I knew it not they did tear me and cease not for the OCR OC for some reason I can't say this word because I don't know if there's Hypocrites sitting here hypocritical mockers in Feast they nest upon me with their teeth Lord how long will thou look on Rescue my soul from their destructions my darling the lions from the Lions see he's talking about his darling from the Lions I will give thanks in the great congregation I will praise the among much people okay so David goes on and you can continue to read there how he prayed to the Lord amen so we like we were saying now our thought for today is utterly slay and destroy the Enemy by Your Word seed amen if you have responded to the message of the hour and you believe the message of the hour something within you quickened you to the message of the hour yes yes to see Gene of God Amen so just remember that so David is going to utterly slay and Destroy because he has a word from the Lord to pursue the enemy amen hallelujah the Bride of this day and this hour has been given an order from the Lord to pursue the enemy to utterly slay and Destroy when they are given a prophecy in Revelation 10:11 they are given a prophecy to prophesy again prophecy is to destroy the enemy that say the Lord is an atomic bomb on the enemy the prophet of God says that you want to know what Atomic Warfare is he said it's that sayth the Lord amen praise the Lord amen so we find here David is encouraging himself he goes to the Lord in prayer and he's asking the Lord to send the angel of the Lord before him to slay those enemies amen now we may be thinking that how can Angels kill men but if we show you some examples in the the Bible the angel of the Lord is a destroying Angel he can utterly slay and Destroy yes amen amen so there's a strategic alliance between the seen world and the Unseen World amen like when they surrounded that City that day you know we read Kings chapter 6 there and they came in the night time and the saw physical ERS and chariots but there were ERS and chariots that could not be seen by the natural eye we've been through this last week Sunday the Unseen World amen so Satan copied the Unseen World he brought chariots he got these men to design the Chariots based after the Unseen World so Elisha says open the boy's eyes to the Unseen World amen amen hallelujah and I want you to know those ERS are still alive today oh yes those angels have not aged neither have those horses aged those are Supernatural horses amen amen they have Immortal Life hallelujah praise the Lord so we're finding here that that he goes and he he's got 600 men but then he leaves 200 men and he takes only 400 we know four is the number of Deliverance so God Amen in his perfect type he's going to deliver them so they go and they pursue and we'll just pick up some highlights I just want to get through this very quickly amen hallelujah so that we can get to the Crux of what we're trying to say this morning Hallelujah 1 Samuel chapter 30 just want to read some more scriptures is there but David pursued he and the 400 men right and 200 behind so then they meet in Egyptian in the field we're not going to get to that the Egyptian tells them how they overtook the city and he says and when he had brought him down this is verse 16 now so now the the Egyptian leads them to where these men who slay burned the city and took the people captive he brought them now to where they were and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the Earth eating drinking dancing this was like a nightclub they were rejoicing because all of the great spoils that had been taken out of the land of the Philistines out of the land of Judah but watch David now under the anointing under the leadership of seen and Unseen World David smoke them from the Twilight even un the evening of the next day amen amen when you are pursuing the enemy don't stop amen if you get a little relief of symptoms don't stop amen hallelujah if you pursuing the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you pursuing the new birth if you're pursuing for Greater Heights in the spirit of God don't stop oh thank you Lord totally slay and annihilate every unbelief from our life amen and they escaped ning man of them see 400 young men which rode upon camels and fled and David recovered all amen that the amalekites are carried away amen and David rescued his two wives and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither Sons nor daughters neither spoil nor anything that they had taken to them David recovered all amen we're not going to allow the enemy to take back anything from us whether it's our health whether it's our joy amen whether it's our children we do not allow him to take am God gave you your children to Holy wedlock you claim them amen you keep claiming them you have a concern if a mother amen there a m had a concern for a son who was dying he she and the Lord grounded an airplane because she was praying for a son God will not forsake your prayer oh yes God Amen prayer will make you stronger God will hear your prayer Hallelujah people say oh well you know we leave these things no as long as you have breath in your lung and the Rapture is not taking place claim every one of your loved ones amen hallelujah thank you Lord praise the Lord amen David recovered all and David took all the flocks and the hers which they drove before the those other cattle and said this is David's spoil now when they come back they come back to the 200 men and these men remember not been in battle with them but yet they were part of the Army and the men started to get Carnel some of the 400 and said we will not return to them their spoil just give them their children and their wives but don't return to them everything that was stolen but David being a just King saids no amen they are off us amen our victories are their victories amen even in the message of the hour our victories are the victories for the Bride of Jesus Christ Our battle amen if we win these battles amen we are winning it for the body of Christ praise the Lord amen so give to them release to them amen Le to them a word praise the Lord so we find David goes on and then he starts to bless all the other territories that were taken away what is he doing he's prophesying again and he's reestablishing everything that the enemy stole Psalm 144 And1 says blessed be the Lord God my strength Psalm 144 And1 blessed be the Lord my strength who teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers to fight Hallelujah I like the way he says fingers because if you want to learn Warfare in this hour you got to learn your fingers here oh yesj amen your fingers to fight amen amen hallelujah yes praise the Lord I hope you got strong fingers I hope your fingers are functional amen you turn to the word of God and you are going to slay the enemy amen amen that the enemy will be defeated with the word of God it's the only thing that will defeat Satan any time on any grounds any place amen now in Romans Romans 8:37 says nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen I'm telling you now there's not a demon power can stand before you you're the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ to you has been given amen an authority released to you when Jesus Christ ascended on high amen we're going to read a quote just now the prophet of God under a prophetic anointing he's speaking thus sayith the Lord is a word from God and he's going to tell you he's releasing his authority to the bride some people don't even know Mark 16 says in my name they shall cast out Devils they think it's repeating the name of Jesus it's not that church when he's saying in my name he means in my authority in my stad in my place because the one that has come to adoption has the same signing Powers as the Lord Jesus Christ so in my authority they shall cast out Devils that devil will think it's Jesus Christ talking it won't be different amen praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah maybe you think it's not so Amen brother if you can go to that very last quote amen I I got my notes differently today if you can go to that message hallelujah how many of you love the Lord amen amen while I'm here on the thought I want to give you this quote because amen some people okay let's just find it in God's provided place of worship 1965 go to paragraph 196 I want you to know you no different to Jesus in the spirit realm you are no different to Jesus amen just like our husband and wife are one amen oh yes oh oh yes how can we be joints with Jesus and not be like Jesus Hallelujah am come on now amen amen thank you you got it 196 praise the Lord he says the church will come through justification through Luther sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is that enlarging territories now they enlarging their territory from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man right this is the important part that when the husband and wife will be the self persons am so I don't want you to suffer from inferiority complex amen Christ and his wife will be the self same persons God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same am I don't know about you but for me the same means the same amen I don't know about you but the the same don't mean lesser ah come on now amen you see right now Satan is telling you you can't be but you're going to defeat that enemy right now in your mind this is the prophet of God speaking a word to the people of God Amen here let's go to that next quote Amen in in the exposition of the seven church I don't know if I've given you this but maybe type this out there amen see if you find the seen and unseen seen and unseen amen so we're finding now that the Bride of Jesus Christ is not a bride just dressed in a wedding garment that's like what you see on these wedding days like a white robe like a white robe with a white gown the bride's wedding armor right now is Ephesians 6 sorry yeah it's Ephesians 6 right put on the old armor that's the armor of an adopted son sword of the spirit Shield of Faith breastplate of righteousness loin G with runs G with truth amen feet short with the preparation of the Gospel Shield of Faith amen we got it okay let's just get to the beginning of this paragraph yeah there here is the mighty conqueror let you just see that here is the mighty conqueror he is the one who conquered Both Worlds so go down yeah here is the mighty conqueror talking about Jesus Christ now he is the one who conquered Both Worlds of the seen and unseen amen amen you remember we were teaching about how the the men have authority on the justion on the Earth but there's one man who has Juris fiction on Earth and in heaven it's the Lord Jesus Christ well seen and unseen but nothing could conquer Christ we're going down now I skipped all letter about Napoleon we don't hear about them amen we want to he about Jesus for this morning right but nothing could conquer Christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him has been given a name that is above every other name yes he conquered death hell and the grave and as the keys thereof what he looses is loosed and what he binds is bound there is no changing of it there is no conqueror before him and there is none bes beside him he alone is a savior Redeemer he is the only God and the Lord Jesus Christ is his name amen now notice from there the prophet goes now it goes into a quotation mark as a prophecy over the church he says Don't Fear John who is John is it the one who took the book yes yes is it the type of the Bride yes don't fear Little Flock all that I am you are here too amen hallelujah all my power is yours oh yes Lord my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst he here in your midst this morning I have not come to bring you fear and failure but love and courage and ability some people like to think oh I got no ability God has given you ability in this hour an ability to believe his word an ability to hold up the word and the standard of the word high that's your ability amen all power is given unto me and it is yours to use oh yes than come on Church of God you Lord why do we lay like there's no power in the church amen he says all my power I've given to you to use amen the thing is sometimes people have the power of God and they let it lay dant like electricity running to an house every Appliance is connected like you are everyone fly framed in the body of Christ but in order for the appliance to work you've got to turn on the switch you've got to let the the wall amen the plug be connected to the main one and as you need it amen you turn on every Appliance and every Appliance though it has different functions are all pulling from the same Source praise the Lord your Kettle Works different from your microwave if you want a warm food you won't put it in the kettle amen praise the Lord everyone fitly framed in the body functions differently but they all connected to the same power source yes amen wonderful so make a note of that that's a personal word to the church the Bride of Jesus Christ he says all my power is yours my omnipotency is yours I've not come to bring fear and failure so why do we fear Satan Whispers in our ears and fear strikes the heart especially when it comes to sickness fear strikes the heart of men oh what's going to happen to me they go into a self Petty party but I want rugged bold Christians amen I want Christians who know the word of God who are not ashamed of the word of God who can laugh with the doctor amen the prophet of God says the doctor gives you a report you laugh in his face tell you you got cancer you laugh and you think what what cancer you talking about amen 1 Peter 2:24 says he by his wounds I was healed oh yes but no we go there doctor said doctor said how about what the word of God says amen how about you change your confession to the word of God Amen doctor gave me three months to live he it God ask him how many months you got to [Music] live how many months you got to live how can you tell me how many months I got to live but thank you for diagnosing the case I'm now going to amen engage the armies of the Living God I'm going to prayer I know what area to Target am amen I know what area to Target now I don't have to pray Lord I don't know what's wrong with me heal me I know it's saying cancer in my lungs I will pray and blast the demon out oh thank you Jesus we claim to be in the message of the hour but we don't have a backbone when it comes to these things when it comes to Healing we accept everything that the doctor says we want to accommodate the situation hallelujah amen I tell you if your blood pressure is too high right now in the presence of God by your power of your spoken word you can speak your blood pressure back to normal you can speak your sugar levels back to normal amen stop depending upon tablets stop depending on the doctor's report amen who created you thank you Lord they're not going to pack a packet of pills and say oh don't forget to bring it in the Rapture Hallelujah and you better not have motion sickness because you're going to be changing Dimensions amen hallelujah you better be not afraid to fly one day you're going to fly so high yes amen praise the Lord but fear grips out of people you watch people can be can be uh sympathetic with the word yes I believe that yes I believe that but watch when you go through a trial and a test that's when your true metal is tested amen praise the Lord that's when it matters that's when you must have the faith of Abraham and call those things which are not as though they are we're not asking you to live in denial maybe they diagnosed it correctly but you say my faith SE as Jesus cursed that viig tree and it wither to the root this cancer is cursed and I curse it to the root amen amen hallelujah thank you the blood of Jesus Christ flows yes through my veins so the blood of Jesus Christ must clear every blocked artery oh yes yes but it's according to your faith now every fiber of my being every fiber of my body is functioning perfectly it's per working as a 23y old young man all my arteries are free amen it's clean amen the blood flows to my body carrying oxygen to my brain and other parts of my body I have neut and rich blood amen I have lack of nothing amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen amen amen actually slay and Destroy we can't be sympathetic with the devil now amen amen amen amen praise the Lord let's get back to our sermon amen praise the Lord Acts 1:8 very important the Disciples of the Lord 120 of them are staying in the upper room it's a time of Silence the Lord told them T here in the city of Jerusalem until you endured with power that's the power we want this morning amen yes Lord Acts chapter 1:8 but you shall receive power amen when after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth after the Holy Ghost he's come upon you what is that the Lord is telling them you are in here now in Jerusalem amen I'm sing you to be Witnesses but I want you to prepare for an enlargement amen of territory yes you're going to go to Jerusalem Judea Samaria and South Africa amen the utmost parts of the earth sir so when God is going to give you enlargement he's going to equip you with power amen hallelujah then we know know on the day of Pentecost what happened how the Holy Ghost fell amen praise the Lord amen let's turn to one sorry John chapter John chapter one praise the Lord let see one more thing about the power here let me continue now we know that the promise of power is to them that can receive him who is him the prophet says who is him for every age the word the word released to every age amen so Acts chapter one said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you meaning the Holy Ghost has come for two things to birth you with a born again experience and to form you into the word image you can't be formed into the word image without being born again that's why I think many people are making the mistake they want to be formed into the word image but they have not been born again they have not had the right birth not at the right experience they haven't died to the things of the world they haven't died to the whole nature but they want to be formed into the word image it won't work so you have two experiences in one act when the Holy Ghost comes upon you now it's for your birth and for your adoption because we are going back to original sons that we were born to be praise the Lord so we were reading there John chapter 1 but as many as received him to them gave you what somebody say it loud to them gave he to become sons of God Amen even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God so yeah it again he gave power to become sons of God a power has been released to the church he says n natural force put Israel in a Homeland he will take the power of God to put the church in the bride amen hallelujah so we find again what we are saying the promise of power is to them who receive him for the age him is the word for the age amen so yeah we know that in the beginning animals were supposed to be born by a by a sexual reproduction but sons of deity sons of God where to be born by the word and by the spirit amen and the word and the spirit make the spoken word you can't have mechanics without the Dynamics to have spoken word you've got to have the word and the spirit we are supposed to be born by the word and the spirit except a man be born of water and the spirit so Jesus Christ brought back the original way as to how sons of God should be born I want to I want to prove this to you in Genesis chapter 1 amen let's just read you quickly Genesis chapter one in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and watch the spirit of God moved over the face of the waters but that's only the moving of the spirit what does it need come on now we just said spirit and word what does he need so the spirit of God moving over the face of the waters couldn't do anything except it was expressed through the logos through the word so it's only when when God speaks the word can now the spirit and word come into action am everybody see that the spirit of God Alone was moving over the face of the waters and then God releases a word and God said let there be light and there light yes amen so the fullness is spirit and word mechanics and Dynamics so Jesus Christ brought back the original way that sons of God should be born we are not born again by coming to church we are not born again by shaking hands we are not born again by putting our name on the church register we are not born again by some emotions but we are born by word and by spirit amen that's been released in this age not a word released in Luther's age neither in Wesley's age but a word released in this age so that was God's original intention how we should be born so the spoken word is word and spirit together and we know the spoken word cannot fail yes amen because word and spirit cannot fail and that's the power to the church word and spirit together I'm trying to show you the power that you are to receive amen you shall receive power tering the city of Jerusalem receive power as many as received power to then he gave power to become sons of God so the power is word and spirit amen and that tell me in which other age has word and spirit been released amen didn't Jesus say in that day they shall worship me in spirit and in truth truth is the word didn't pilot I think asked Jesus what is truth my word is truth spirit and word amen so how do you receive him he said says for as many as received him so how do we receive him the only way that we can ever be born again is to receive the word in the wh of your mind Hallelujah that's how we are born again you must be able to receive the word in the wh of your mind because in your heart is the word seed representation the prop of God says when when when when the battle was set God shows the heart Satan shows the mind so how God works he sends the word he sends the mind but it must drop down to the heart because in the heart is the word Gene seed that's your representation that's the Eternal Zoe life within you but it needs a word to Quicken it so Satan shows the Battleground to infiltrate the word from dropping from the mind to the heart you see why he gives you mind battles you see why he tells you it's not possible yes right so we are not to have mental defeats in our mind but we ought to be having mind victories if you if you keep the word in your mind you will be an overcomer am where's the Battleground the mind so you've got to take the word to the mind to the Battleground and slay the enemy every thought bring it under obedience to the word of God take every thought captive how you going to catch it captive by the word not by psychology the only way you can Captivate those thoughts is by the word and the devil's job is to take away the word from your heart from your mind but the holy spirit is here as that angel of God to give you Grace to keep the word of God in this hour so God Jesus gave us the the key he says it is written it is written God said so amen hallelujah some of you need to keep your mouth closed about speaking because you only speak negative things if you don't know what to say say Satan it is written yes God said so I believe it it must be according to the word amen God said so if God speaks the word the enemy fights the word amen through Avenues of Your Mind through Avenues of memory reasoning affection your conscience how do you feel Satan wants you to keep you focus on your feeling it's not how I feel it's what the word of God says about me I'm more than a conqueror greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world why you want me to confess how I feel if you really want to know I feel like giving you devil but we know we can't attack him in the physical so we attack him spiritual if you want Satan to be defeated this is how you defeat him amen our greatest weapon our greatest Authority right so you've got to be able to keep the word in your mind right in the face of your emotions right in the face of your feelings no matter how Satan comes to whisper in your ears no matter how down you feel you don't bow down to your feelings your feelings must bow down to the word of God no matter how sick you are you don't B on to that sickness your sickness must B on to the word of God can I get some Christians here who will utterly slay and Destroy trouble come on any hand you utterly Sway and destroy you take the word of God to your work you take the word of God to your school you take the word of God to your home you take the word of God everywhere that you go josua every place the soul of your foot shall tread you shall possess yes Lord amen oh thank you Jesus thank you amen you've got to confess it you've got to say it people want to think the word no say the word speak the word Romans amen 10 says if you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth you've got to be able to speak the word amen if God had kept up all all his thoughts in the back part of his mind in the beginning if nothing would have manifested it had to move from a thought to a word spoken don't just think oh no I believe the message I me if you can read my mind beside my wife I me if you can read my mind what I'm thinking now you see you can't think that but when a word is spoken it releases something into the atmosphere and it goes about to be a creative power of God Hallelujah Romans uh chter 12 amen hallelujah I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable to God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world amen amen but be transformed be transfigured be changed what by the renewing of your mind so you're being changed transformed transfigured from a sinner to a saint being transformed from a regular son to a Son of God there's a transformational work being done within each and every one of us and the power of the word is a power of transformation Hallelujah so how can you be transformed by the renewing of your mind the only way for transformation to take place your mind must first be renewed what is the Bible saying be renewed in your mind yes that's right amen start to think like a Son of God start to act like a Son of God amen amen you must have seen that picture a young boy with tattered clothes nothing to you can see he's poor he's a beggar but he's looking in the mirror and the image in the mirror is one with a suit one well dressed one with his haircut what he sees how he sees himself in the mdle how do you see yourself do you see yourself as a son and daughter of God do you see yourself as part of God's economy amen hallelujah that you are amen part of God's economy you are his greatest treasure that your soul is worth 10,000 words amen amen that you are the reason he is coming back in this hour amen amen I want you to know God kept you back in this age not for no reason yes sir God kept you back in this age because you are the ones that can overcome this age hallelujah thank you Lord he couldn't have any other one here to overcome this age but you were the ones with the gene seed of God which means you have genetic qualities of God within you your DNA and if you know what DNA means your DNA carries the DNA of God come on now who knows what DNA means anyone scientists oh you're all looking down now nobody knows what DNA means blood hey blood yes it's to do with the bloodline but I'm talking about the acronym what does DNA mean very good that's what science is but DNA means means divine nature attributes you're right brother Kenzo that's the scientific term you're very intelligent I didn't even know that [Music] divine nature attributes amen I carry the DNA of God within me didn't Peter say you you shall have the divine nature of God Amen he's talking about your DNA amen divine nature attributes you got to be transformed by your mind amen that you may prove that which is good what is acceptable and the perfect will of God so the mind is the battlefield is like the middle man and your soul is your wor seed and you have to thank God that you have a wor seed within you amen amen and we understand by the message of the hour that your word seed was expressed by the logos Hallelujah let me say that again Lord I don't want you to get over your head H at thoughts amen and he had to find a form of expression like Satan can only walk through doubt and reasoning unbelief God can only walk through his word God will work through no other way except through his word God will only work so you can only work through the logos that's how he finds expression through the logos so he condescended and our names were expressed in the logos and we know the logos is seven spirits of God seven spirits of Elohim amen seven rainbows amen hallelujah seven colors in the rainbow amen these are all talking about God praise the Lord amen so we find God Justified you based on that seed within you why did God choose you in this age you take this message how come one person can't believe it and you can believe it you have a c Gene of God within you oh yes amen amen that's why you believe the

that is quickened comes now deity upon the Earth come Sons and Daughters of God back on the earth Hallelujah so we know we were thoughts in elohim's mind and your thought was expressed as a word in the logos amen hallelujah so the logos is God himself your word was expressed into the logos then your word seed in the logos becomes your name in The Book of Life praise the Lord now I am telling you you are perfect in Christ yes your mind will come against that truth but every one of us here if we are in Christ we are perfect in Christ amen your mind will tell you it can't be so because you did this you did that amen but you take the word and you place it in the battleground of the mind and you say God said so it is written keep telling your mind God said so amen I am perfect I'm showing you how to take back now amen I'm showing you how to possess the promises of God what happened to John Ryan he had to keep confessing that he was healed amen I hope we got some good Catholics in the message church because they don't know how these things work the prophet says the reason why John Bryan could maintain his confession he was a Catholic and you tell a Catholic say five mares he will do it diligently but yeah message people they think ah one time I must speak you know Jesus prayed for somebody I think it was it blind eyes and he says I see trees as men then Jesus prayed for him again some of you want one prayer did Jesus pray for him again you read that see act can never read it you must go read the Bible Jesus prayed for the man again and his eyes became clear hallelujah amen so you got a John Ryan the reason why you maintain the positive confession people here don't believe message of the hour they say believe a prophet they don't know how to operate by spiritual laws the power of your confession maintaining your confession until one day John Ryan said it for the last time one of these days if you are maintaining your confession you are going to say it for the last time amen you are going to say it for the last time amen yes Lord here you want Bible I'm going to give you Bible 1 John 3 behold what man of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the what sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is here's the main part now everybody waiting whosoever is born of God does not commit sin why John why why are you saying this John because his seed remain in him amen your what seed remains in you making you sinless amen yes sir amen and he cannot sin I don't know what the devil's been telling about you but you're a sinner telling my what seed within me has no representation of sin I am not a sinner amen amen he tells you but look at your past I don't know that person that person came through the fall that person came through sexual reproduction but I'm a Son of God I've been born again through the blood of Jesus Christ I've been born by word and by spirit amen people think brother Bram was making casual remarks I'm no longer the son of Charles and Ella Bram amen hallelujah he was denouncing his first birth you've got to denounce your first birth you've got to recognize you're a son and daughter of God and you carry within you the DNA of God and also the power of God you carry the authority of God can somebody connect with that can somebody believe it amen Ministry is coming week after week to labor to put the word of God in your mind to put the word of God in your mind so it can Quicken that se Gene within your heart therefore we come to church Hallelujah Galatians 3:26 I took it from the amplifier because I want you to get the context the meaning for you who are you who are born again have been reborn from above spiritually transformed renewed Sanctified are all children of God set apart for his purpose with full rights and privileges amen amen amen through faith in Christ Jesus amen so like we were saying he was born of God cannot sin cannot not sin your mind will not accept the truth tomorrow he'll tell you you're a sinner but your mind will not accept the truth because Satan comes through the Mind amen he will come against it remind you of memories remind you of mistakes amen challenge you how can you say you're perfect when you did this how can you be perfect when you fall into sin how can you be perfect when you do this when you do that amen but I want you to know we are moving from Jacob's Grace to Joseph Perfection amen hallelujah Abraham had genetics within him Abraham had amen a promised seed within him and as the seeds was coming out some were finding defects Hallelujah he produced an Isaac but that was the natural son Hallelujah If Abraham had possessed the power of the spoken word he would have spoke Jesus into existence the Royal Seed of Abraham but he was reproducing the animal way and he brought forth Isaac and Isaac brought forth Jacob and out of Jacob came forth 12 genetics but Jacob was moving in Grace the prophet of God says Abraham was election Isaac was justification Jacob was Grace and he says Joseph was Perfection there's a seed line within you the gene of God which is perfect which is Joseph he says there's nothing against Joseph amen hallelujah when I'm saying Joseph I'm talking about you you're jeene seed there's nothing against you so you keep speaking the word you keep believing the word you say it shall be so and it will be so amen hallelujah people are finding it hard to be born again amen because what they will take in their mind amen what what are they taking from the world or what are they taking from the mind is it the seeds of god of the seeds of Satan finding it hard Romans 8:33 I'm giving you a lot of Bible today amen who shall lay I'm talking about the one who does not commit sin who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect who which demon power dare lay a charge who lay a charge it is God who justify it so if we still struggling in our Christian faith that is not God's intended way for our life the only way you must be born again you've got to receive the word for your age yes receive it in the whom before the spirit comes you must be able to receive the word amen and when we have the word in the whom amen we have put on the mind of Christ no demon can confuse us oh yes no demon can bring depression no demon can bring anxiety what is that demon powers got fancy names amen but they are devils it's Devil's coming to torment you Spirits hanging around trying to bring you down hallelujah amen demons can't attack you they can I mean they do attack but I want to show you something the attack means nothing Isaiah 57 Isaiah 57 17 when they're firing against you the fiery DTS of the enemy dots of depression dots of anxiety DS of sickness a man built on the word of God a man who Jean seed is activated he's now an adopted son of God he says no weapon that is formed against the shall prosper Hallelujah no weapon yes amen no weapon formed against you shall prosper amen young people you're going through mind battles you're going through situations at school no weapon formed against you shall prosper Hallelujah am somebody bullying you somebody saying something against you somebody speaking down against you take the word of God to the Battleground and say you demon no weapon formed against me shall prosper in fact the word of God goes on further every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment Thou shalt condemn amen yes meaning I cancel every word spoken against me right now cancel every word spoken against you I cancel every negative word spoken against me I cancel every evil that is meant for me I cancel those words I bind those words in the name of Jesus Amen who is this for this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me say the Lord hallu you see this is what it's like watch Satan coming against you demon Power is coming against you demon power is in men and women too not sure but say that's how demons work watch now Isaiah 29:8 This Is How They are this is how God will confuse them it will be as when a Hungry Man dreams that he is eating but when he awakens his hunger is not satisfied or when a man is thirsty dreams that he is drinking but when he awakens in fact he is faint and his thirst is not quenched so will the multitudes of all the nations who fight against Mount Zion amen they'll be dreaming of doing things to you but they shall not Prevail Mount Zion is the bride amen I want to show you how the Angelic gets involved When you pray amen very quickly let's turn to 2 Chronicles CH 32: 211 people think amen that we we don't have an Unseen World yet to assist the Sons and Daughters of God I want you to see who was fighting these battles amen who the Lord sends it says and the Lord sent an angel which cut off all the Mighty Men of Valor and the leaders and captains in the camp of assy of the king of Assyria who did it the angel of the Lord cut off all the Mighty Men of Val and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king so he returned with shame face in his own land and when he came into the house of his God that they C that they that came forth of his own bow slew him see son slew him there with the sword 2 Kings 19:35 and that very night the angel of the Lord went out and struck 158,000 man in the camp ah you see why you don't play with the angels of God Amen you don't play with the Son of God yes why were they slaying they were coming against the children of God and God will rise up he says vengeance is mine say the Lord now you know why in Exodus 23 it says beware of him Daniel 3:28 then Nebuchadnezzar spake and he said blessed be the Lord God of Shadrach Meshach and Abino who has sent his what his Angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and healed their bodies that they may not serve nor worship any God except their own God acts chap 12: 23 I'm going very quickly to this immediately this is talking about aod because aod did not give glory to God an angel of the Lord struck him down and he was eaten by worms and died amen 1 Corinthians 10:10 and do not complain and do not complain as some of them did and were killed by the destroying Angel right Exodus 12:23 for the Lord will pass through the and smite the Egyptians when they see the blood upon the lentil and upon the two side poost the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come in unto your house to Smite you why am I saying this I'm trying to show you Revelation 10 it's a time of War it's a military setting it's a time of war the mighty angel coming down why does he Roar brother Bram says when a lion roar it strikes fear Into the Heart of the enemy so he Roars and his feet pillars of fire he steps upon those two beasts to suppress their powers amen praise the Lord let's just go through two more examples Joshua 10:11 and it came to pass as they fled from Israel and we're going down to bethon that the Lord cast down great Stones the Lord cast down great stones from Heaven upon them unto ezeka and they died there were more which died with hail Stones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword don't play without our God amen amen here's a scripture in Deuteronomy dear beloved avenge not yourself but rather give Place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay say the Lord so we know where we are standing as the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we know where we are standing and dumb devils are on the Run amen they know they are defeated now the prophet says Satan hates Revelation he doesn't want you to get a revelation of who you are because Satan becomes powerless before you before you amen so we are Standing on the Promises of God no Fallen Spirit can tell us something different how are we going to defeat the enemy by the word it is written God said so amen so we are Standing on the Promises of God you know you come from God and you're going back to God no demon in hell can tell you that you are lost you made some mistake I am not lost hallelujah amen thank you Lord my salvation my Redemption was paid before the foundation of the world I I am a sealed product of Elohim praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord are you a sealed product yes come on ask your neighbor are you a seal product tell him I don't want to see any leaks amen don't leak on me please know it's a pyramid City fly framed if you leak now you're going to leak on me you must be a sealed product let's go to that quote amen 15 what is the Holy Ghost that's what the matter we don't get sealed so much we too loose about things when the inspector comes through to inspect your life to see if you're not just loose about things little loose about your prayer life little loose about that temper little loose about that tongue to talk about others he'll never seal the car some dirty abotts some V things some vulgarity mind he can't seal the car but when he's found everything is in place the inspector then he seals it who's this inspector the tutor the guide now watch what he says dare anybody touch that seal so if you're sealed dare anybody touch you dare anybody open that seal until that car has reached its destination to where it seal before that's it touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm for I say unto you it is better that a millstone was hanged around your neck and you were drowned in the depths of the sea then for you to offend or shake a little on these last least of these that's been sealed you see what it means that's what the holy spirit is it's your Assurance it's your protection it's your witness amen amen it's your seal it's your sign I'm Heaven bound don't care what the devil says I'm Heaven bound he sealed me he gave it to me he sealed me to his kingdom I'm Glory bound let the winds blow let Satan do what he wants God has sealed me till the day of my Redemption that's what the Holy Ghost is oh you should want it I can't go on without it so much could be said there but I'm sure you know what I'm speaking of so believe in your heart and keep confessing it that I shall be filled and I shall be refilled amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah I want you to know those that were carrying oil in the lamb started to lose oil finally they ran out of oil the five foolish amen so you must be able to receive the word like we were saying in your home and many of us face that challenge we can't just take the word when we are facing challenges in fact for some of us the word is the last resort when we are facing challenges but the Bible says let the weak say I am amen let the poor say I am let those without the Holy Ghost say I shall be filled if you love The Holy Ghost you must be filled yes how many if you love The Holy Ghost oh the precious Holy Ghost amen your mind will challenge you but keep saying let the sick say I am healed let the sons of God say I shall be adopted Amen Let the sons of God say I shall be glorified keep saying it it is written in the word I shall be glorified that's the way to walk in Victory amen people are attacked physically and defeated because they cannot attack handle the spiritual attack mentally we lose battles in life because of our minds yes and when we lose it in our minds it manifests in the body it manifest as a reality in our bodies but if your Victory is in your mind by the word then your reality becomes your manifestation what is it manifestations of Victory amen what is it my victory that overcometh the world is our faith that's the Bible so a son and daughter of God don't know failure a son and daughter of God don't know defeat amen a son and daughter of God know negative words a son and daughter of God don't speak negative words a Son of God speaks positive a son and daughter of God only speaks the word of God amen amen this is my day-to-day Victory I must live by the word I must prach by the word I must eat by the word amen my entire being must be the word of God Amen now you know
