========================================

so Genesis 24 we'll just read a portion of scripture here and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in some things all things all things amen and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had he has a man walking in authority of everything he's walking in Dominion Authority of Abraham's belongings put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh so that is the way they made a covenant and he's not swearing by any man he says I will make this way by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell so this is now looking for Marriage Partners amen but Thou shalt go unto my country to my Kindred and take your wife unto my son Isaac so the servant hears this I'm a swear by the Lord and he says but Venture the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest and Abraham says beware that thou bring not my son to the again you see we can't go back to idolatry come out of her my people and we ought not to be going back yeah amen don't ever take him down there the Lord God of now he's going to reveal a hidden Mystery to him because remember Abraham is walking in perfect faith and he's receiving Supernatural Revelation from the Lord and he's going to reveal his Revelation now he's saying the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and would spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy SE I will give this land amen he shall send his Angel before thee amen amen he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from den and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son F again amen and then now the servant after he's hearing of the supernatural revelation and who's revealing the mystery of God's will to him he's willing now to put his hand under the thigh and he says and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter amen and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia unto the city of nul Amen let's just read one more scripture and set the SE and he made his camels to kneel down within without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water the Lord had blessings with the reading of his word you may be seated amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we've been through the previous chapter and we see how Abraham had come through his greatest test and Abraham called it worship to be obedient to the word of God is called worship amen amen so we know that was when he was asked to sacrifice Isaac and he passed the test with flying colors amen he pass the test with flying colors amen so much so that this man was taking a knife to plunge into his son a angel has to call out from the angel doesn't even have time to come from Heaven he has to scream from heaven so serious was Isaac I mean Abraham the angel has to scream out from heaven and tell him Abraham stay thy hand amen amen we've been through that last week amen hallelujah so now he comes down from the mountain with Isaac as he spoke and the lad will return amen and he's walking in Victory now he's the master of all circumstances he's walking in perfect faith and calling those things that are not as though they are and he speaks like God Amen so we find time progresses and in Genesis 23 we read about the death of Sarah and how Abraham secures a burial sight for her amen so we find that time passes even further and now Abraham is concerned about Isaac because it's Abraham's responsibility to see to it that Isaac marries the right type of girl yes yes the right woman so that the seed line will continue and he can become the father of many nations amen right now he only had one son but God said you'll be a father of many nations he told him look to the stars look to the sand so shall your seed be so he knows there must be a progression in order for the seed line to progress he must find a wife for Isaac amen so when Abraham approaches this he's very specific and he is not appaz it in the way that he goes about searching for the bride for Isaac so this title here you can title it finding the Bride of Isaac finding the Bride of Isaac amen so he's not appaz in finding Isaac wife amen he knows that if God was so precise about the bedding ground in which Isaac would come through amen that it had to be through Sarah then the type of woman that Isaac marries will also be of utmost importance am so he has to make a decision and Abraham as you know has the mind of Christ and he knows what he wants with the word yes and is not to marry from other nations young men young women you're not to marry from denominations but now he has to make a decision I don't want to go back to Babylon I don't want to send Isaac down there to who will I send he's got to make a decision amen amen amen hallelujah yes Lord so we in this decision it says here amen if you go for the that first slide at the same time Abraham was determined he did not want his son to marry an unbeliever that would be a good decision for Christian today who are Sons and Daughters of Abraham to make the same decision about their children I I thought the son must choose I thought the daughter must choose brother Brandon please rephrase that okay let me rephrase it for brother Brandon it would be a good decision for Christians today who are Sons and Daughters of Abraham to make the same decisions about their children amen amen Abraham had to make a decision but Abraham did not want his son connected with that kind of stuff I wonder what kind of stuff I you know brother Brandon really had to elaborate there he'll tell you what kind of stuff amen stuff on the face stuff on the nose stuff on the ears amen amen they are full of stuff amen that's unbelief so so great is the stask that Abraham appoints the stask to his most trusted servant the one that was going to become the heir to all things if Isaac was not born the one that was born in his own household amen amen the one that was like an adopted son you don't make somebody your a if they're not your adopted son so elas is an adopted son he's a Son of God he's a spoken word Son of God walking in power and authority amen amen he commands Abraham's Kingdom and he tells the servants what to do is in charge of the household so the servant elizer has been trained in the house all these years for this specific time for such a time as this now Eliza must step forward to fulfill his greatest role in Abraham's household yes amen all the other years were years of preparation all the other years out in the Evangelical field amen under the first and second pool with just years of preparation but he was waiting for a message amen yes yes Lord now that the promised son was here Isaac and was of age to be married elzar's main purpose of his ministry is to be revealed amen the prophet will say so the time has been allocated to every man to make his decision whether he's a preacher or a prophet or a church member or what more he's got to make a decision and he decided that elizar was the selected one because he had found elizar to be a trustworthy servant he had been loyal and true and upright and just and honest that's the kind of a servant that God can pick to take a message from him to the church what kind of what kind of servant if you read there a loyal servant a true servant an upright servant a just servant an honest servant amen that's the kind of messenger god can use amen amen amen why to bring a message to the church now Elm has also make a decision if he's going to trust his five senses to make the decision or if he's going to trust his six sense and connect with the supernatural world and help him to find the bride for Isaac we also have decisions to make will we go in the caral way or will we connect with that angel will we ask for divine intervention in our decisions can we go in on our knees and pray and say Lord I've got this decision to make but I don't want to make it alone based on my human emotions and five senses won't you step in on the scene and bring me Angelic assistance amen you see the angels of God are here on Earth is ministering spirits to the Airs of salvation but they are sometimes unused they are sometimes unwanted services but if you in a time of need you can call and say Lord send the angels of the Lord amen hallelujah so El is has to make a decision amen whether he will trust his own taste about a woman he's got his own taste in a woman amen now most people if they would approaches from a caral point of view they would think that Ela is a young person Ela is not a young person remember he was already there and was going to be the heir of all things before Isaac was born so now Isaac is approaching 40 years old and he needs to get married so Ela is not a young man amen my point of telling you that he was not trying to flirt with Rebecca he had no desire to flirt with the bride am and neither did our Prophet amen so the prophet says sometimes we got to let God speak to us yes Lord help take God's decision of who should be when you who you'll come into fellowship with you see what he's saying there you need to take a decision who you'll come into fellowship with who's your close circle of friends who's the one that's influencing you who's the on that you spend time with you'll have to make a decision about that your parents can advise you your friends can advise you amen the pastor can advise you but ultimately you will have to make the decision and birds of a feed the flock together you find you hang around with dogs you get it fleas amen hallelujah yes and sometimes I wonder why our young people hang around with unbelievers they're my neighbor they're unbelievers do not be unequally yolked with unbelievers how can two walk together oh but we have such a good time laughing laughing about what yes we just have a good old time here we laugh about anything you'll be laughing in Hell together why don't you come laugh with us amen enjoy the things of God and Sarah says the Lord that made me to laugh amen yes amen Hallelujah he says I don't care what level it's on come anyhow let God speak you see he's speaking in a certain level this morning but are we hearing the voice of God Amen now it says here it was coming about evening time when he came to the well near the city and it came about the time that Rebecca had to make a decision so Abraham made a decision Ela made a decision now Rebecca makes a decision and he says I believe believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about half hour amen amen amen yes Lord I believe the Ang this this is the Angel of the Lord amen is there seven angels in this picture as well cuz the Angels formed the wig amen yes some people believe these are were the theophanies of the seven Messengers they preach it as Doctrine but I have you know theophanies don't have wings and the prophet says great Wings the one on the right with the swept back Wings swiftly flying amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord Seven Angels formed the wig yes amen seven angels formed the wig so he's coming now about the time of evening and why am I saying that he says I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about half an hour right so this is preaching 1959 before the event happened yes in 1963 so brother BR Khan make these things up because you know that the Angels appeared there before he went hunting the picture was taken February 28th the prophet was hunting about a week later so the angel of the Lord I don't know why people have built up this picture in the head that the angel must only come there when the prophet is there they wrote the story they wrote the story so it must happen according to their time line so now when the prophet is telling them the angel appeared there half an hour early ah we want it to be according to our story so they have a revised version amen so he says I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about half hour for he will send his angels before thee for what that makes the way clear yes amen that's right thank you you see because people do not understand what's happening in the spiritual world right the Angels had to come and prepare the way yes clear out all other demonic forces that were coming to oppos it yesen we think it's all an Dory Prophet going here Prophet going there going to rescue the boy who was going into his Cham uh to be on death row there and then he he missed being there on time and all of these things hunting season wasn't open God has fixed all things perfectly hallelujah amen hallelujah God will send his angels before you then makes the way clear and it must have been the angel of the Lord that spoke to Rebecca's heart and said go get to the water yes and Rebecca came to the Water of Life at the evening time amen now how many if you know that God works on both ends yes how many of you know that God works on both ends amen if you are praying about something he's working on the other end to bring it to pass so when Abraham had this desire in his heart to find a bride for Isaac Rebecca was Restless in her part of the country she didn't want to stay in Babylon she had a desire to leave that place none of the men of the city interested her the Bible says she was very beautiful she was to look upon and she was a virgin no doubt she was of age to be married and she may have been receiving proposals but nothing within a connected amen yes Hallelujah nothing within a connected amen now who is Ela for those of you that don't know Eliza is a type of the Prophet yes amen amen who at evening time now the Lord Jesus Christ has got a bride on the Earth but they are trapped in denominations yes and trapped in systems of this world that he must send a prophet with a message get her amen amen you know the prophet had that Vision or not Vision sorry he had a physical experience where he was feeling down in his spirit and he needed confirmation of his ministry and he opened up the Bible to Genesis 24 to ELA the faithful servant and he says my eyes fell upon the scripture and he says go hunt my bride amen and he says that has been the confirmation that this is my messag amen amen then he sees a preview of The Bride amen hallelujah you'll find it on the slides there amen if you search for it there you'll see he has a preview and in this preview he sees the bride but the last bride is getting out of step and he says it's all to my min Min to keep her in Step Amen to keep her in line amen amen praise the Lord amen thank you now years eler he approaching the the well and he's about to meet this woman at the well amen and he's coming now and you know he took 10 camels 10 camels is to let you know you are supposed to know the hidden mysteries of God that this is typing Revelation 10 amen 10 camels of his master amen and he made the camels kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening amen so this woman something within a tells her like you said there now the Lord works on both ends right something within her tells her it's time for you to go to the well now when you hear that voice you got to obey it amen brothers and sisters we need to be sensitive to the Angel's voice in this hour we can't be walking around ignorant and saying I got this feeling and I got this you got to be so in tune with the spirit am yes amen hallelujah because God doesn't let me say it this way God doesn't always work where you're going to hear an audible voice he he go he into the city no was the prophet when that sister who recognized herself as a shunamite woman was he even aware of what was happening and he says Lord she she said Lord I am your shunamite woman where is your Elijah you think the Lord said now I'm going to ground this plane my Prophet I'm going to ground this plane there's a woman in need here in the city and I'm going to ground this plane just excuse the turbulence here but I'm going to ground this plane and you are going to have to walk a few city blocks until you come to this woman and you will find a woman standing on the corner of the street if he didn't work for the prophet that way you need to be sensitive to the spirit if the prophet didn't obey the voice he could have stayed in the airport he could have been frustrated and said oh now this turbulence is wind now is grounded the plane but he knew how to walk in the spirit now so another reason why we won't be able to hear the spirit's voice is because we have so many other voices in our ears amen we allow ourselves to be influenced by so many other voices that when the the voice of God can't penetrate through amen I want you young men to be men of God to be so full of the power of God to be so full of the anointing of God Amen I want Even You sisters to be so full of the power and the anointing of God Amen Hallelujah let's shut out every other voice let's shut out every other thing amen that's ending us from hearing the voice of God Amen yeah I'm looking at orim now and and the other day she was going she's going to school and I asked her where's your glasses CU she normally has glasses she's saying I don't need them and she says the teacher asked me where's my glasses so she says no I don't need them so she's been sitting in the service and she connected and she's got faith to believe that the eyesight is perfect amen now if you'll do that to a 9-year-old amen so I asked her she she says there's two things amen and then I asked her about it she says no she's already confessed it she believes it amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah how about us now I guarantee you that if we can approach the Lord with childlike Faith because faith is not something super duper amen hallelujah that God that only operates with the big and the Great and the mighty amen praise the Lord so yeah he's saying now behold I stand by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy pict I pray thee that I may drink she shall say so I shall say and she shall say amen he is specific about what she must say come on now if your boss is giving you grief and you in trouble and he's calling you to the office you can say and he shall not even say this or he shall not even say that you mean my Dominion Authority stretches just above the animal world the supernatural world I can even put words in other people's mouths yes yes I don't know if you reading the Bible yeah but El is is saying that when I say give me a drink she shall sing amen amen amen so you see brother Jaden when you're approaching this girl you must say and I shall say will you and she shall say I do you already confess it amen praise the Lord I know we're very shy guys here they don't like to talk about anything like this amen but we're talking about finding a bride for Isaac yes finding a wife for Isaac yes amen so we can learn from these things right amen so when I say drink she will then she'll not only say drink and I will give thy camel and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master amen amen hallelujah and it came to pass before he had done speaking so God working on both ends before he was done speaking he's still making his prayer he is still speaking the word and it says behold Rebecca came out which was born to bethuel son of milka the wife of n Abraham's brother with a pitcher upon her shoulder and the damil was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled a picture and came up and the servant ran to meet her and the servant ran to meet her amen amen hallelujah now I want you to know the servant wasn't running 50 different times yet and keep running and telling this girl give me a drink of water and that girl said no and then he went this side give me a drink of water you think he kept was hit and miss no who was leading him amen the angel of the Angel of the Lord okay let me break it down for those that didn't get it can I have your number I'll give you a call can I have your number I'll give you a call so now you're searching for a wife but you found 50 girls and you saying Lord let the one and you made your own condition let the one when I visit a house my name must be on the biscuit see I didn't need to explain that amen so the angel tells him that's the one if the angel led him this far now I want you to understand it was no easy Journey for eler to come along that way we just spoke about the supernatural world do you not think he would have faced every obstacle along the way yes he was going to find a bride for Isaac you think they didn't face obstacles along the way treacherous conditions resistance they were thieves they were robbers yes but these were also well- trained servants they dealt with five Kings and their armies amen they were fighting a spiritual battle and they had come here at evening time amenallah you see when we read the story weting they walk straight out of Abraham's house and they came there now they're so fresh and they're there now but try and and find the meaning of the story put yourself in there yes amen hallelujah find the heart of the story and you'll see that they maybe have been tied in the journey amen but he's so uh determined to fulfill the commission that he goes about to praying at evening time amen hallelujah and early in the morning you know this woman comes out and then she draws water and what did we just read there the angel of the Lord was hooing her to the waters calling her to the waters hallelujah amen she didn't know that all night was 10 camels and the Servants of Abraham outside there waiting amen and she AC it so the servant ran to me and said let me I pray thee drink a little water of thy picture and she said drink my Lord and she hasted now she said drink my Lord that was what he asked for right but here's the second part and she a it let down the picture upon her hand and gave him to drink and when she had done giving him a drink she said I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking amen amen hallelujah amen amen oh praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord yes amen hallelujah now just to tell you what this means a camel drinks 60 gallons of water one camel right so if I had to convert it in liters there was no h pipe amen but this woman gets to work she's running down to the well coming back up putting it there for them to drink running back down she ran up and down 60 times amen you see the kind of character that he was looking for for someone was able to catch the hidden part of the mystery the unspoken part amen and she was fulfilling it of her own accord somebody who could do the Greater Works amen amen a young girl a beautiful girl Not Afraid Amen to get dusty and dirty and run up and down to the well and serve not men she's serving camels What would these beasts the prophet says they represent Powers what was she doing refueling her own transportation yes amen is the message of the hour our transportation yes amen what was she doing giving life back to the camels amen water is life she was giving life back to the camels and when you and I amen obey the message of the hour we are giving life to the message the power the power that's going to take you to your Isaac oh yes you know without you the message is dead so who is giving life to the message amen that's what she's doing she is giving life to the camels has the deer panted for the waters so animal you know where they need water she's giving life to the message how are you serving the message are you giving it life are you giving it power are you allowing the message to take and have an effect on you amen she is giving life to the message she is running back and forth 60 times going getting water coming and throwing and this like I'm going to reiterate the prophet never asked her to do it I only do what the tape says I don't have my own personal ambition to go out and do something for the Lord the prophet says I must lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened so I will just lay here and be ripened I will not have any concern for other people and go do an Outreach I got this one quote lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened am I right I can't see myself I'm laying here you know when you laying you can't see yourself unless you got a mirror on the roof now people are laying there and preachers like me are coming around to tell me you are not right and they getting offended you are sunburnt sorry not you instead of getting ripened you got sunburnt because you left the vine there was no life flowing you know in order for the fruit to be ripen you must still be attached to the vine you must still be attached to the tree some have gone on no I'll detach myself from this tree I'm going to listen to the tape at home I'm lightening here amen they're ripening at home do you know why they ripen at home they don't want a a present tense Holy Ghost who is able to discern what they're doing right now and call it out because when it's coming from the tape it's always about another person the prophet was talking to them not us back in the day can't be us he Lord amen so she's responding to the unspoken word he never asked her to feed the camels she said I will feed the camels also and she got to work amen hallelujah the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word so if there was nothing to be done why would he make that statement he knows what she wants done with the word amen and the man was wondering at her held his peace to with whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking so it must have been quite a sight for him right to watch this that the man took a golden earring of half a shekele weight and two bracelets for a hand of 10 shekels weight of gold and said whose daughter are thou you must still find out now whose daughter she is just the sign alone is not good enough there's lots of women out there performing signs hello lots of churches out there performing signs wonders and miracles so the sign alone el is was not convinced with the sign alone what did he do he pour out the gifts he pulls out the gifts a type of the church world but he wants to place the gift upon her and he says whose daughter are thou pray I pray thee is there room in thy father's house for us to Lodge in and now she identifies herself I am the son I am the daughter of Bethel the son of milka which she bear unto n she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to Lodge in the Beast needs power to make the journey back but the Beast can't survive on water alone so there's a further ministry under Rebecca I hope you get this to give the message life amen amen amen not only water yeah she is telling eler we have Str and provender I don't know that's probably some cattle food and a room for you to Lodge in and the man bowed down his head and Worship the Lord that was a sign amen bringing the message of the hour into your home amen thank you bringing the message of the hour into your home and letting it live feeding it not just finding a room he says I have a room for you is there room in your heart for the Lord I have room in there for you thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen so he worships the Lord and he says blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham who had not left us destitute my master of his mercy and his truth amen I being in the way the Lord led me to the house of my Master's Brethren amen so he starts to recite all of these things and Rebecca had a brother and his name was Laban and Laban ran out to the man and it came to pass he saw the gifts hearing and bracelets upon his sister's hands and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well and he said come in thou blessed of the Lord wherefore standest thou without for I have prepared the house and the room for the camels and the man came into the house and he unguarded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that were with him and there were set meat before him to eat but he said I will not eat until I have told my errand and he said speak on you see sometimes you go to people's house you got an urgent business they say no no don't worry just eat first eat first then we'll talk they say no we'll talk first then we'll eat doesn't matter you traveled in the wilderness Journey get the business out first amen then you know if the that conversation didn't go too well now you going to eat you have to leave amen so don't be an hypocrite now have the meal and everything first then you're going to tell them something now things are not working out yet tell them first and leave amen praise the Lord let's get back to the message amen that was just reading there the Bible amen the prophet is telling us that when we are making decisions in life we can't make decisions that are based on nothing it must be secure decisions trusted decisions so he find he says there's times when you have to make hard decisions maybe in your midle middle age you have your last earning ni talking about finances here and you put a little here you put a little there you got to a place maybe that the money has to be invested somewhere you've got a decision to make where you will put that money and before you invest that money you'll first find a place where it's safely put maybe this is happening for a reason right now the Lord don't want you to make foolish decisions yeah the prophet is giving you advice he says we have things today that just get rich over overnight invested here and tomorrow you're a millionaire but you wouldn't put your money in such a place as that because it's your life's earnings amen but what will you do with sober and sincerity you'll search for an Old Reliable firm that's been tested and proved one that's safe and there you'll invest your money because you don't want none of this fly by night and if you're that sincere and concerned in your decision about your life's earning how much more sin should you be about your religion and your salvation amen we shouldn't go for some of these little fly by night ideas or put your name on the church book and shake hands with the preacher that won't work amen he says I would recommend you tonight to an Old Reliable institution that was founded on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down to dwell among men it was the most reliable firm that I know of to invest your soul amen and your future in eternity in an oldfashioned Pentecostal experience amen it's been time tested and proved to be the truth 2,000 years hasn't changed a bit and the same dividends that was paid off at Pentecost is still being paid off by this firm amen yes inflation hasn't caused God to give you a lesser Holy Ghost yesen thank you no matter amount of attack by demon powers has made the Lord amen withdraw his power from the church it's the people that have restricted the power of God from flowing through the church we need to clear out all channels and be a conduit for the power of God yes amen amen amen there is no wireless electricity brother Caleb is there wireless electricity you've got to be connected to the source yes you've got to be connected to the power yes amen amen Hallelujah people want to operate I'll connect wirelessly I'll connect wirelessly amen people are so backslid they don't want to go to church I'll stream the service so they are connecting wirelessly to the service now the angel doesn't have confidence to come in your home but the angel of the Lord is in the church now you can't connect with his anointing you can't connect with his presence amen hallelujah amen right now I suggest you stop resisting the spirit of God and you start to embrace the spirit of God and you allow the angel of God to work through you so that he can touch you even now yes amen amen hallelujah 2,000 years it hasn't changed a bit yes the same power the same anointing amen amen yes Hallelujah and the same dividends that was paid off at Pentecost is still being paid off by this firm the gift of the Holy Spirit the power of healing to see Visions Angels appear to you yes Lord oh hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Jesus you Lord thank you Lord I can imagine amen El a telling Rebecca the angel of the Lord is here the angel of the Lord is here can you feel it in the atmosphere amen the angel of the Lord is here and something within her began to tug and say yes I can feel his presence I can feel the brush of angel's wings you see if you if you understood there there wasn't only 10 camels and some servants traveling through the Wilderness there was Angelic forces because the Abraham said I shall send my angel before thee I'm telling you that same Angel of the Lord is not aged and he's here right now and he's here going before you yes amen yes the angel of the Lord can meet you at your need yes the angel of the Lord if you can reach out by faith right now the angel of the Lord is able to meet you at your need you are surrounded by Angelic beings you are surrounded by Supernatural [Music] word open up the boy's eyes let him see right now connect with the angel of the Lord right now connect with the angel of the Lord amen hallelujah you thank you Jesus amen bless your name amen hallelujah so walk watch where we invest our time our energies make a good investment in an oldfashioned firm yeah the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen we got something positive we know that God will back up what we preach yes amen that's right hallelujah amen God has already been doing it but I'm telling you with confidence now God will back up what's being preached amen amen yes amen hallelujah God still sends his men with an angel before them Hallelujah to take a message to the church yes thank you amen oh he left with a strain of camels and he had the gifts for the bride he loaded the camels full of gifts to give the bride and he never told her that they were for another generation or another day they were for the bride he says every true servant of God sent out has got

brag about himself yes the man did not draw attention to himself he says I've come to establish a relationship between you and the Lord Jesus Christ amen Ela was not flirting with her along the way trying to get her to fall in love with him thank you Jesus amen in fact when they got married Rebecca didn't have a picture of elaser and put it there and say this is the man who brought me to Isaac she didn't have a picture of ela in the house to say this is the man that brought me to Isaac she was not secretly in love with the prophet amen amen now what made them connect the prophet says they

one message of the hour that she gave life to because the message of the hour is transportation am the prophet even says it the very word that you are eating your new body will materialize around the word he says you're not eating eating of the body word of a son of man but you're eating from the body word of the son of man he says I was not the one there that appeared on the o River amen I was not the one that appeared there in Houston Texas I was not the one that appeared on Sunset Mountain but greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world Amen it's our time we as message people
