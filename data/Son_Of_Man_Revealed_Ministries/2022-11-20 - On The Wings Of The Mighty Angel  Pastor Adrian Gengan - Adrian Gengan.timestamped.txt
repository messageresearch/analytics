[0:05] She wants to return thanks to the Lord.
[0:06] Amen. I tell you, it's no ordinary thing
[0:09] when sons and daughters of God recognize
[0:11] their position and want to walk in
[0:13] newness of life.
[0:15] Amen. My dear sisters, I want to tell
[0:16] you something. Satan is not going to be
[0:19] happy with you after today.
[0:21] And he's going to point every arrow
[0:22] against you. He's going to try to make
[0:24] you live worldly, to do things worldly.
[0:26] But you take your stand for Jesus
[0:28] Christ. Amen. He's going to bring
[0:30] temptations. This walk's not going to be
[0:32] easy.
[0:32] The Christian life is not a bed of
[0:34] roses. You're going to get trials.
[0:36] You're going to get temptations. But I
[0:38] want you to know the Lord will always be
[0:39] by your side. If you call on his name,
[0:42] he will always be by your side.
[0:44] Amen. And what a blessing it is to walk
[0:46] into newness of life. And I shared the
[0:48] scripture with you. The Bible says that
[0:50] over one sinner that repent, the angels
[0:53] of God in heaven rejoice.
[0:55] Amen.
[0:55] So what a jubilee. What a rejoicing that
[0:57] is in heaven. And why can't we join
[0:59] heaven and rejoice on the earth? Amen.
[1:01] With our sisters. Amen. And even the
[1:03] family, the mom and dad, I'm sure they
[1:05] are most excited this morning to see
[1:07] their daughters who they have raised,
[1:09] who God entrusted to their care and
[1:11] they're raised in the in the nurture of
[1:13] the Lord now make that decision on their
[1:14] own that they want to serve the Lord.
[1:16] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm so glad.
[1:20] Amen. For all the songs, the testimonies
[1:21] this morning. I know it's right in line
[1:23] with what we preaching this morning.
[1:26] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:28] Everybody excited?
[1:30] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So, we'll
[1:33] turn to Revelation chapter 10 this
[1:35] morning. My subject this morning is now
[1:39] when I after I prepared the old message
[1:41] and had everything done, something
[1:44] dropped in my spirit and said, "Check
[1:47] when brother Brandon preached this
[1:49] message."
[1:51] And I looked and it was the exact month
[1:52] of November in 1965.
[1:55] Amen.
[1:57] [clears throat]
[1:58] So he preached a message. So remember on
[2:01] the wings of a snow white dove he's
[2:03] following the dove leading that lamb
[2:07] message
[2:08] right? So on the wings of a snow white
[2:10] dove. Now we all know the song on the
[2:13] wings of a snow white dove.
[2:14] God sends down his pure sweet love.
[2:17] A sign from above on the wings of a
[2:20] dove. So this morning seeing that it's
[2:22] 60 years later surely the Holy Spirit
[2:24] will progress.
[2:25] Amen.
[2:27] And the Lord gave me this title and it's
[2:30] titled
[2:31] on the wings of the mighty angel.
[2:34] Amen.
[2:35] Amen.
[2:36] Amen.
[2:37] Amen.
[2:38] The message that we have came down on
[2:41] the wings of a mighty angel.
[2:45] Let's read. Amen. And I saw another
[2:48] mighty angel come down from heaven
[2:51] clothed with a cloud.
[2:53] Now you'll notice right here. Sorry.
[2:56] When the spirit speaks, I just need to
[2:57] move. Stop right there.
[2:59] You'll notice he's saying, "I saw
[3:01] another mighty angel." So John is seeing
[3:03] angels descend up from heaven onto the
[3:06] earth.
[3:07] This is another one.
[3:09] If you'll read Revelation 9, you'll see
[3:11] that angel falling like a fallen star.
[3:15] Coming down upon the earth.
[3:18] You'll see brother Brandham is on earth
[3:20] at the time of this angel's coming.
[3:22] So there's a natural messenger on the
[3:24] earth. There's an angel on the earth.
[3:27] And I want you to know under this time
[3:29] and age, you got to be under three
[3:31] angels message.
[3:34] Some people have opted for just two
[3:36] angels message.
[3:39] But it's very important to be under the
[3:42] three angels message.
[3:44] Amen.
[3:46] Who are these three angels, you might
[3:47] ask? the mighty angel that came down in
[3:50] Revelation 10.
[3:52] The seventh angel.
[3:55] And the prophet of God, I want to read
[3:56] it right from him. Amen. Hallelujah. The
[4:01] prophet of God says this
[4:04] before I forget this. I want to read it
[4:06] for you so that you get it. Amen.
[4:10] [clears throat]
[4:13] He says, "Your pastor," you'll find this
[4:15] in the book, Revelation book of symbols,
[4:18] paragraph 58. He said, "Your pastor,
[4:20] when he stands here on the platform
[4:22] ministering the word of God, he is God's
[4:25] angel to the church.
[4:27] Messenger to the church."
[4:28] So I don't understand why some people
[4:30] don't want to have a pastor.
[4:32] Amen.
[4:33] So they are not under the angel to the
[4:35] church.
[4:36] So you need to be under the mighty angel
[4:39] who gave the message to the seventh
[4:41] angel
[4:42] and the pastor standing there. Here's
[4:44] the quote. Standing there on the
[4:46] platform ministering the word of God. He
[4:48] is God's angel to the church, messenger
[4:51] to the church.
[4:52] So we are so glad that we under the
[4:54] three angels message.
[4:56] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's continue
[4:58] reading. Amen. So what we said was there
[5:00] are angels that are descending from
[5:02] heaven but here comes another mighty
[5:04] angel. This was no ordinary angel. He
[5:07] was clothed with a cloud
[5:09] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[5:11] face was as it were the sun and his feet
[5:14] as pillars of fire. Oh, what an angel
[5:17] this is.
[5:18] Amen. This is not a soft angel with
[5:21] wings just flying and flapping
[5:23] singing holy, holy, holy. This is a
[5:25] different kind of angel.
[5:28] Amen. This is not an angel who worships
[5:30] before the presence of God,
[5:31] but this is God himself in the form of
[5:34] an angel. Amen.
[5:37] And he had in his hand a little book
[5:39] open, and he set his right foot upon the
[5:42] sea, and his left foot on the earth
[5:44] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[5:46] lion roarth.
[5:48] Hallelujah.
[5:50] And when he had cried, seven thunders
[5:52] uttered their voices.
[5:53] Amen.
[5:55] And when the seven thunders had uttered
[5:57] their voices, I was about to write. And
[5:59] I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[6:01] me, "Seal up those things which the
[6:03] seven thunders uttered and write them
[6:05] not."
[6:06] Amen. May the Lord add blessings to the
[6:08] reading of his word. You may be seated.
[6:10] Hallelujah.
[6:12] You know, when I was reading this quote,
[6:14] I my mind went back to brother Joshua
[6:16] and brother Jaff because when I read the
[6:19] quote, you know, brother Joshua
[6:22] specifically, I think it was I think
[6:23] brother Jaff had a similar experience
[6:25] when they walked into that convention
[6:27] that year.
[6:29] They heard a specific voice and specific
[6:31] word spoken to them.
[6:33] You can ask them what it is if you
[6:34] forgotten after the service. But as I
[6:37] read this port, you'll find that when
[6:39] the angel is telling this brother a
[6:41] certain thing, you'll hear it's exactly
[6:43] the same angel speaking.
[6:45] Amen.
[6:45] Amen.
[6:47] Amen. Hallelujah.
[6:49] So you find here on the in the message
[6:51] on the wings of a snow white dove,
[6:54] there's a brother who left
[6:55] denominationalism
[6:57] and he wants to hear more about the
[6:59] message of the hour.
[7:01] So he's going downtown looking for the
[7:03] church. He hasn't been given the
[7:05] location.
[7:07] So he seen people gathered and he
[7:09] inquires and he says, "Is this where
[7:10] Billy Brandham is going to preach?" And
[7:13] they said, "No, this is where Billy
[7:15] Graham is preaching by the way of a
[7:16] flim."
[7:18] And I'm afraid many people looking for
[7:20] Billy Brandham preaching this morning.
[7:23] When they knock on their door, they're
[7:24] going to say, "This is where Billy
[7:25] Brandom is preaching by the way of a
[7:27] tape." Amen.
[7:32] But the angel didn't want him to stay
[7:33] where the film was being played.
[7:37] He said, "Well, I'm sorry. I got the
[7:39] wrong place." So, you tell them when you
[7:41] go there and you're playing that,
[7:43] "Sorry, I got the wrong place."
[7:46] Nothing against it,
[7:48] right?
[7:50] But we got to come by God's provided
[7:52] place.
[7:53] Amen.
[7:55] He said, "Now, where can I go, Lord?" He
[7:57] started to walk up Texas Street and
[7:59] there was a big white cross up on a
[8:02] church and the Lord told him just keep
[8:04] walking.
[8:06] When he got to the church where brother
[8:08] Brandham was preaching, he saw a bride
[8:10] and groom coming out of the church.
[8:12] Amen. [laughter]
[8:14] Amen.
[8:15] That's right in line with what we've
[8:16] been preaching. Queen of Queens, a
[8:18] marriage, Amen. ceremony taking place on
[8:21] the earth.
[8:23] And what did the Lord say? This is what
[8:24] I'm getting to now. The Lord says, "Now
[8:26] this what it is. You're coming out of
[8:29] denominationalism
[8:30] to enter the bride to go with the
[8:33] groom."
[8:33] Amen.
[8:34] Yes.
[8:34] Amen. [applause]
[8:36] Amen.
[8:37] Hallelujah. Isn't that in similar lines?
[8:39] Amen.
[8:39] Amen.
[8:42] This message, Amen, is a message that
[8:44] has come down from heaven.
[8:46] Amen.
[8:47] This is not a message made up by a
[8:49] seventh grade education Kuckian
[8:51] preacher.
[8:52] Amen.
[8:53] [clears throat]
[8:53] Amen. Amen. So my title this morning is
[8:57] on the wings of the mighty angel
[9:01] and for a subject I want to speak on a
[9:04] royal proclamation.
[9:06] Amen.
[9:07] Amen. Now a proclamation is an official
[9:10] formal public announcement.
[9:13] Now a proclamation I want you to know is
[9:16] different from a declaration. That's
[9:18] right.
[9:20] So he's not coming to make a
[9:21] declaration.
[9:23] He is coming to make a proclamation.
[9:26] Amen.
[9:27] And it's usually issued, a proclamation
[9:29] is issued by a person of authority to
[9:32] make certain announcements known.
[9:35] Yes. Amen.
[9:36] Now, before a proclamation is made
[9:39] either in trumpet sounds
[9:43] or I'm going to say it in this way, they
[9:45] cry with a loud voice.
[9:47] Amen.
[9:48] Amen. You know back in the day when
[9:50] there wasn't microphones and things they
[9:52] would say here he here he
[9:55] and everyone must give pay attention
[9:58] there's some important announcement to
[10:00] be made
[10:02] and if it's an important message from
[10:04] the king then everyone must be silent.
[10:11] Now, if you look at the way brother
[10:14] Brandham structured his message on the
[10:15] wings of a snow white dove, he takes you
[10:18] through the Bible and he shows you every
[10:20] time that dove appeared.
[10:22] Now, who is this snow white dove that
[10:24] brother Brandham is talking about, he's
[10:27] talking about God Almighty coming in the
[10:30] form of the Holy Ghost.
[10:33] Amen.
[10:37] So I am taking you this morning and I'm
[10:39] speaking on the wings of the mighty
[10:42] angel. And I'm going to show you every
[10:44] time that mighty angel came down, he
[10:46] brought a proclamation.
[10:49] Amen. The first proclamation he brought
[10:51] was announcing the birth of Jesus
[10:54] Christ.
[10:56] And that announcement came on the wings
[10:58] of a mighty angel. You find in Luke
[11:01] 1:26, in the sixth month, the angel
[11:03] Gabriel comes to that city Nazareth,
[11:07] and the angel says to Mary, "Hail, thou
[11:09] art favored. The Lord is with thee.
[11:12] Blessed art thou among women."
[11:15] Amen.
[11:15] And the angel says to Mary, "Fear not,
[11:17] Mary, for thou has found favor with
[11:19] God."
[11:21] Amen.
[11:24] And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
[11:26] womb, and bring forth a son, and thou
[11:28] shalt call his name Jesus.
[11:33] Amen.
[11:35] The next time he brings a proclamation
[11:37] is at the birth of our Lord Jesus.
[11:41] And we know they there are shepherds in
[11:43] the country and they are in the field
[11:44] keeping watch over the flock by night.
[11:46] And lo, the angel of the Lord comes
[11:48] down,
[11:50] and the glory of the Lord shines round
[11:52] about them.
[11:54] And they were so afraid. And the angel
[11:56] of the Lord says to them, "Fear not, for
[11:58] behold, I bring to you good tidings of
[12:01] of great joy, which shall be to your
[12:03] people, for unto you is born this day in
[12:06] the city of David a Savior, which is
[12:09] Christ the Lord."
[12:10] Amen.
[12:10] And this shall be a sign unto you. You
[12:13] shall be, you shall find a babe wrapped
[12:15] in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.
[12:18] Amen.
[12:18] What was the angel's message?
[12:21] Messiah is on the earth now.
[12:24] Amen.
[12:26] Hallelujah. And the Bible says, Amen.
[12:29] that the shepherds got into action.
[12:32] They made a to go find where the babe
[12:35] lay.
[12:37] Amen. You find a few years later the
[12:39] wise men trying to follow that star and
[12:42] coming to Bethlehem that day made a
[12:45] proclamation where is he born king of
[12:48] the Jews.
[12:48] Amen.
[12:50] Amen.
[12:53] A proclamation.
[12:57] The next proclamation comes when this
[13:00] mighty angel at the resurrection of our
[13:03] Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 28. You'll
[13:06] find it's the end of the Sabbath and
[13:08] it's beginning to dawn toward the first
[13:10] day of the week.
[13:11] This is taking place between 6:00 and 9
[13:14] one morning.
[13:15] Amen.
[13:16] And Mary Magdalene comes and the other
[13:18] Mary and behold, there's a great
[13:20] earthquake,
[13:21] right?
[13:22] There's another one fixing to happen.
[13:25] Amen.
[13:26] And it's right in line without going
[13:28] away.
[13:30] Yes.
[13:31] Hallelujah.
[13:32] Amen. If an earthquake struck when the
[13:35] head arose,
[13:37] there'll be another earthquake strike.
[13:39] Amen.
[13:39] When [clears throat] the bride is taken
[13:41] away.
[13:41] Amen.
[13:42] Amen.
[13:44] The Bible says here there was a great
[13:46] earthquake. Why was the earthquake?
[13:49] [laughter]
[13:50] What does the Bible say was the reason
[13:51] for the earthquake?
[13:53] For the angel of the Lord descended from
[13:56] heaven.
[13:57] Amen.
[13:58] Amen.
[13:59] and came and rolled back the stone from
[14:02] the door and sat upon it.
[14:07] Why was he doing it? He was not trying
[14:10] to release Jesus from being trapped
[14:12] within the tomb.
[14:16] Jesus could have passed through that
[14:17] wall and he did. The angel came and tore
[14:21] the seals open so that the person
[14:23] standing on the outside could see that
[14:25] he is not dead.
[14:26] Amen.
[14:27] But he is arisen. Amen.
[14:29] The same way when he comes to break the
[14:30] seal off of your life and he breaks all
[14:33] seven seals, it's for you to see, amen,
[14:36] that you have rights back to your
[14:38] inheritance and you don't have to lay
[14:40] dead in your dead denominational system
[14:43] in your man-made religion. But when he
[14:45] calls your name, you can go free.
[14:48] Amen.
[14:50] Amen.
[14:50] The Bible says his countenance was like
[14:52] lightning.
[14:53] Amen.
[14:54] Hallelujah.
[14:55] Amen. Now think of that Revelation 10
[14:58] angel. His countenance is like
[15:00] lightning, his raignment white as snow.
[15:03] And for the fear of him the keepers did
[15:05] shake and became as dead men. And the
[15:08] angel answered and said unto the woman,
[15:10] "Fear not he. For no, for I know that
[15:13] you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is
[15:16] not here. He is risen as he said, come
[15:19] see the place where the Lord lay."
[15:22] Amen.
[15:22] Amen.
[15:24] Jesus Christ is risen from the dead.
[15:26] Amen.
[15:27] That's our message. Amen. That's the
[15:29] most victorious message that we have
[15:32] that he is now king of kings and he's
[15:34] lord of lords and he's still the risen
[15:36] savior.
[15:37] And he's still saving those that seek
[15:40] him.
[15:40] Amen.
[15:41] He is still calling the names that are
[15:43] found written in the book.
[15:44] Amen.
[15:45] The family album is not complete.
[15:47] Amen.
[15:48] Amen. So he is still calling names.
[15:51] Thank you, Lord. And until that last
[15:53] name is called, he will not stop. And
[15:56] neither should the bride stop.
[15:59] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[16:02] Amen. I want you to know this is the
[16:04] bride's revival.
[16:05] Amen.
[16:06] This is the time of the bride's revival.
[16:08] The greatest message that has ever
[16:10] struck the earth.
[16:12] Amen. Came by the shout of a mighty
[16:14] angel.
[16:15] Came when that seventh angel messenger
[16:18] began to utter his voice.
[16:19] Amen.
[16:21] And he began to turn our hearts, every
[16:24] predestinated seed, he began to turn our
[16:27] hearts back to the faith of the original
[16:30] Pentecostal fathers.
[16:32] Amen.
[16:32] All you got to do is subject yourself to
[16:34] that voice. That voice is designed to
[16:37] turn every predestinated son and
[16:39] daughter of God back your heart back to
[16:42] the original faith.
[16:43] Thank you, Lord.
[16:45] The trouble comes is when we reason with
[16:47] that voice.
[16:47] That's right. A trouble comes when we
[16:49] question the voice.
[16:51] When he says woman shouldn't wear pants,
[16:54] we question the voice.
[16:55] When he says man shouldn't have long
[16:57] hair, we question the voice.
[17:01] That's always the trouble when we
[17:03] question the voice that sent and
[17:05] designed to do a certain work.
[17:07] The Bible says that Malachi 4, what
[17:10] shall he do when Amen.
[17:13] In the days of the voice of the seventh
[17:15] angel, when he shall begin a sound,
[17:17] mystery of God is finished.
[17:18] Amen.
[17:19] Elijah the prophet shall turn our hearts
[17:21] back to the faith.
[17:23] Let him do his work.
[17:25] Amen.
[17:25] Amen.
[17:26] Amen.
[17:27] Don't stop the work.
[17:32] Oh, I said we are in a bride's revival.
[17:35] Amen. But some people are fixing for a
[17:37] 30-day revival starting today.
[17:41] Some of you laughing. You know where I'm
[17:43] going.
[17:45] Oh, they can't wait [clears throat] for
[17:46] today. 30-day revival. Life is going to
[17:50] come back to the body.
[17:55] For those of you who don't know,
[17:58] soccer world cup 2022.
[18:02] I want you to watch your husbands, your
[18:05] wives, your sons, your daughters at home
[18:07] and see how excited they're getting and
[18:10] I want you to go and needle them and
[18:11] say, "Why you don't perform like this in
[18:13] church?"
[18:14] Amen.
[18:16] Hurry.
[18:17] Hallelujah.
[18:18] They're fixing for a 30-day revival. And
[18:21] dare you switch that channel?
[18:24] Dare you change it? But I'm not talking
[18:27] about message believers. I'm talking
[18:28] about unbelievers because that don't
[18:32] happen amongst us.
[18:35] That don't happen here. 90 minutes
[18:37] fixated to a game,
[18:39] but we can't put on a prophet's message
[18:41] that's going to give us rapturing faith.
[18:45] You even want to watch the highlights.
[18:48] Now watch, there's going to be a
[18:50] transfer of spirits. Something that's
[18:52] being played thousands and thousands of
[18:55] miles away is going to create an
[18:58] atmosphere in your home,
[18:59] right?
[19:01] And people's temples are going to rage
[19:06] and fights are going to break out,
[19:08] right?
[19:09] And people are going to lose their lives
[19:11] when they in these taverns and these
[19:13] bars.
[19:14] Why?
[19:16] For a silly ball game.
[19:18] Amen. a little pigkin that they kicking
[19:21] around.
[19:25] Amen. So, go ahead, enjoy your revival.
[19:27] But we'll stick with the bride's
[19:29] revival.
[19:29] Hallelujah.
[19:30] Amen. It's the bride's revival. The
[19:33] spirit is moving all across the land.
[19:36] Amen.
[19:37] Amen. Oh, I I can sense some resistance
[19:40] here this morning.
[19:41] I want you to know, Amen. You're not
[19:43] supposed to be an unbeliever. Right.
[19:45] If you're going to go and resist, then
[19:46] the spirit of God's going to come and
[19:48] chop that thing right now.
[19:49] Amen.
[19:50] Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:53] Amen. Give me some relief. I just want
[19:55] to let go of the pressure. Brother
[19:57] Brandon told you how to let off the
[19:59] pressure.
[19:59] Amen.
[20:00] Amen.
[20:01] Surround yourself with the things of
[20:02] God.
[20:03] Amen.
[20:04] Amen. Hallelujah. Why you want to let
[20:06] those people raise up your blood
[20:08] pressure?
[20:09] You can't even kick the ball straight.
[20:11] Now your blood pressure is going to
[20:12] rise.
[20:14] And it's going to go further than that,
[20:16] brother Sunonny. Some people are going
[20:17] to place bets
[20:20] now. You can do it on your phone at
[20:22] home.
[20:24] You just download the app.
[20:27] Sports betting at home.
[20:30] Must be some cockroach here, some devil
[20:32] here this morning.
[20:33] But the torch is being shown that way
[20:35] this morning.
[20:36] Don't lose your money.
[20:38] Yes.
[20:38] Use your money to pay your offerings,
[20:40] pay your tithes.
[20:42] Amen. Amen.
[20:43] Don't go give it to that. Now it's going
[20:46] kata over there. Hey, you're going to
[20:49] give the Muslims all your money.
[20:53] Amen. Hallelujah. Can we move on?
[20:55] Amen.
[20:56] Amen. Have we killed that spirit?
[20:58] Yes.
[20:58] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now, we are the royal
[21:01] seed of Abraham.
[21:04] How many of you agree?
[21:05] Amen.
[21:05] Royal seed of Abraham. But royal seed of
[21:08] Abraham is tied to an earthly kingdom.
[21:12] I'm trying to show you your position
[21:13] this morning.
[21:15] [laughter]
[21:17] Amen. [clears throat] Tied to an earthly
[21:19] kingdom.
[21:21] But I want the bride of Jesus Christ to
[21:23] know this morning that when this mighty
[21:25] angel came down from heaven,
[21:28] our domain extends from just the
[21:31] three-dimensional world.
[21:35] Amen. Because Abraham
[21:38] is royal seed, his inheritance to the
[21:41] earth.
[21:44] Amen. Amen.
[21:45] I know you're going to get it this
[21:47] morning.
[21:49] Amen.
[21:49] Hallelujah.
[21:51] It's tied to an earthly kingdom.
[21:53] So as children of Abraham, as royalty
[21:56] seed of Abraham, our inheritance is of
[21:58] the earth.
[22:00] Yes.
[22:01] But Christ has stretched that
[22:02] inheritance.
[22:03] Amen.
[22:05] Our domain now stretches far beyond the
[22:07] three-dimensional world. We are also the
[22:10] royal queen married to the king of
[22:12] heaven and that makes us the queen of
[22:14] heaven.
[22:16] Amen.
[22:18] I want you to know nobody, no other
[22:20] woman can make that boast.
[22:22] That we are rulers of the earth and also
[22:25] the queen of heaven. Amen.
[22:27] And heaven has a throne waiting for you
[22:29] to be seated upon.
[22:31] When you leave this three-dimensional
[22:33] world, you are going to a physical
[22:35] heaven
[22:36] and you're going to be seated with the
[22:37] King of Kings.
[22:39] And they have your place reserved.
[22:42] Hallelujah.
[22:43] Amen.
[22:43] Do you have reservations?
[22:46] Amen. There's a place reserved around
[22:48] that marriage table, that married supper
[22:51] table with your name on it. reserved
[22:54] for the royal queen of heaven.
[22:57] Can you imagine? Oh, what a glorious
[22:59] thing. I wrote the song a few years ago.
[23:02] I still have to find time to sing it.
[23:03] Amen. All I can find time for now is to
[23:06] prepare messages. Amen. But we'll find
[23:09] time to sing the song. And it's called
[23:11] Hello, Mrs. Jesus.
[23:13] Can you imagine? Amen. When we go to
[23:16] heaven and we are physically united with
[23:19] Jesus Christ. Church, I want you to know
[23:22] we shall physically see Jesus Christ.
[23:25] Amen. Some of us have got so accustomed
[23:27] to just being united with the word Jesus
[23:29] Christ. But I want you to know there
[23:31] will come a day, there will come a time
[23:33] when we'll be physically united with the
[23:35] Lord Jesus Christ and we shall look upon
[23:38] his face.
[23:40] Yes.
[23:41] And the Bible says he shall wipe away
[23:42] every tear from our eyes
[23:45] and he shall say weep no more.
[23:48] Amen. This life is full of trouble.
[23:50] This life is full of heartbreak.
[23:53] There's enough going on in this life.
[23:55] Amen. To to finish us sometimes
[23:59] to tear a man down,
[24:01] tear a woman down.
[24:03] But God is keeping us in this hour.
[24:05] That is why when we get to the other
[24:07] side and they begin to ask us, "How did
[24:09] you ever make it in that most evil age?"
[24:14] Amen. You mean you came out of that age?
[24:18] the most evil age
[24:22] when the god of that evil age was
[24:23] enthroned.
[24:26] Satan became incarnate in the pope.
[24:30] Yes.
[24:31] You mean you lived in that age?
[24:37] Amen.
[24:39] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So our
[24:41] kingdom stretches far beyond this
[24:43] three-dimensional world. We are the
[24:46] royal queen of heaven. Now when we come
[24:48] into kingdom life,
[24:50] kingdom authority,
[24:53] it requires a certain kind of a speech.
[24:58] Around the royal household, they have
[25:00] something called the queen's language.
[25:03] Yes.
[25:04] You cannot speak the ordinary language.
[25:06] Yes.
[25:09] It's the same way in the spiritual
[25:10] kingdom of God.
[25:12] We we cannot talk ordinary language of
[25:15] the common people. That is why you won't
[25:17] hear denominational talk here in the
[25:19] church.
[25:20] Neither in any messy church.
[25:23] That's common language.
[25:24] It's a common people.
[25:27] But here the queen of heaven is seated
[25:30] together in heavenly places and we have
[25:32] a royal language.
[25:33] Amen.
[25:34] He has changed our language.
[25:37] Amen. You try talking. You want to talk
[25:39] I English. You want to talk royal queen
[25:42] language. Talk about the seven seals.
[25:45] I'll tell you your language is very
[25:47] high.
[25:48] Yes.
[25:49] Talk about the seven church ages and the
[25:50] church age messengers.
[25:52] Amen.
[25:52] And how they overcame each age.
[25:55] Talk about the trumpets and talk about
[25:56] the vials.
[25:57] And talk about Revelation 10 and the
[25:59] mighty angel coming down.
[26:01] Yes.
[26:02] Hey, this guy went to uh
[26:05] private school.
[26:07] Yes. We had a private tutor.
[26:11] Amen. Our father paid for private
[26:12] tuition. and he sent him down on the
[26:15] wings of a mighty angel.
[26:18] He saw that you needed extra help.
[26:20] Amen.
[26:20] So he sent you for private tution.
[26:24] Amen. So when a person is born into a
[26:27] royal house, so whether he is born in a
[26:29] royal house or whether he is brought
[26:31] into the royal house by marriage, they
[26:33] must undergo training.
[26:37] What is the training for? To teach you
[26:39] about the royal life.
[26:40] That's right.
[26:41] To teach you about protocol.
[26:43] Amen. I think brother Joshua and them
[26:46] also they are taught because they
[26:48] sometimes accompany these provincial
[26:51] leaders and sometimes maybe even the
[26:52] president. They teach you a protocol
[26:54] what to do, what not to do. Amen.
[26:59] How to approach the king and the queen.
[27:01] They teach you that you cannot walk
[27:03] before the king or the queen. That shows
[27:05] disrespect. When you leave the room, you
[27:08] leave with your you don't turn your back
[27:10] and you leave. You leave with your face
[27:14] and you bow as you leave. Approach,
[27:17] respect, presence. They're teaching you
[27:19] about royal life.
[27:21] They're teaching you etiquette. They're
[27:23] teaching you the royal ways of the
[27:24] kingdom. And that's what the message of
[27:26] the hour came for.
[27:29] You know, when you were in the royal
[27:31] household, you can't dress any hour.
[27:34] Why you think the message started off
[27:36] with dressing?
[27:37] Amen.
[27:38] He started to teach us about royal life.
[27:41] Yes. Amen.
[27:42] There's a certain dress code for kings
[27:44] and queens.
[27:46] And this is how you dress. This is how
[27:48] you carry yourself out. No. No. We don't
[27:50] go out and we drink. We don't go out and
[27:52] we smoke. We don't go out and we gamble.
[27:54] Started to change our opinion and our
[27:56] thoughts about royal life. Amen. Some
[28:00] people cannot handle royal life.
[28:03] Yeah. Case in point, you know this
[28:06] woman?
[28:09] Yes.
[28:10] She wanted to sparkle,
[28:15] but they were cutting her down to size.
[28:17] She couldn't handle royal life, so she
[28:20] had to leave. Now, she took the prince
[28:24] of England away.
[28:27] And [clears throat] that's what will
[28:28] happen if you marry the wrong person.
[28:32] Can you imagine that guy? Tragedy can
[28:35] hit at any time. Even though he thinks
[28:37] he's so far down the line, tragedy can
[28:39] hit at any time and he could be the next
[28:41] king,
[28:43] but because of his wife,
[28:46] he can't assume the throne.
[28:49] So watch who you marry.
[28:52] Amen. Even in spiritually, I'm talking
[28:55] about watch who you marry.
[29:00] So we know now, Amen. They approached
[29:02] the king and queen. The message of the
[29:03] hour came to prepare us for royal life.
[29:05] And we said the message of the hour came
[29:07] on the wings of a mighty angel and he
[29:09] brought it down with a heavenly language
[29:11] that only royal descendants understand.
[29:15] Amen.
[29:16] Didn't they come to Jesus and say, "Oh,
[29:18] you're speaking in parables. We can't
[29:20] understand."
[29:21] But there was a time when Jesus spoke
[29:24] plainly to them and they said, "Now thou
[29:26] speakst plainly to us." Wasn't
[29:31] when we first came into the message,
[29:32] seals, thunders, vials, trumpets sounded
[29:35] foreign to us.
[29:37] It used to boggle our minds. Yo, this is
[29:41] higher grade stuff.
[29:43] But now,
[29:44] Amen.
[29:46] Now that we became accustomed to the
[29:48] language, now that the tutor has broke
[29:51] it down for us.
[29:52] Amen.
[29:54] Now we can understand clearly
[29:57] because to you it's given to understand
[29:58] the mysteries of the kingdom.
[30:00] Amen.
[30:03] Amen. Let's get to the crux of our
[30:04] message this morning. Amen. So what is
[30:08] he doing now? Notice if you had paid
[30:10] attention to every time he made a
[30:12] proclamation
[30:14] this angel what did he always say? Fear
[30:18] not.
[30:19] Fear not.
[30:21] Fear not.
[30:25] But here in Revelation 10 when he is
[30:27] coming he does not use the words fear
[30:31] not
[30:33] because his agenda is totally different.
[30:39] If I could describe the scene of
[30:40] Revelation 10,
[30:43] I would say it's in the midst of war.
[30:48] [clears throat]
[30:49] It's in militant situation.
[30:53] This mighty angel, like I said, is not
[30:55] flying around with fluffy wings.
[31:00] I'm putting a halo over your head.
[31:03] But the Bible says that he descends from
[31:05] heaven.
[31:07] Amen. Let's take it slow now. We said
[31:10] when the when he descended on the Jordan
[31:12] River that day
[31:14] and he came down on the winds of a dove.
[31:17] Amen.
[31:19] and he settled upon Jesus.
[31:22] What was he doing? Brother Brandham says
[31:25] he sent his love on the wings of a dove
[31:28] that was coming to do the first part of
[31:30] redemption.
[31:33] The scene is set now. Revelation 10,
[31:36] the battle is raging.
[31:38] Yes,
[31:38] there's a fight for your soul.
[31:42] Satan is going to make his final move.
[31:45] Amen.
[31:47] So the lamb must go to work and he's
[31:49] doing his mediatorial work for 2,000
[31:51] years.
[31:53] But there comes a time when this mighty
[31:55] angel in Revelation 5, you'll hear there
[31:58] the Bible calls him a strong angel.
[32:00] But if you click on the Greek, he'll
[32:02] tell you he's a mighty angel.
[32:04] So the mighty angel is saying, "Who is
[32:06] worthy?"
[32:07] There's an urgent cry.
[32:09] Yes.
[32:10] Why? There are people on the earth who
[32:12] are being overtaken by the powers of the
[32:15] earth. Right.
[32:16] Yes.
[32:17] That writer is writing.
[32:20] Who's worthy to take the book? We need
[32:23] the redeemer to come quickly.
[32:26] It's an urgent cry.
[32:29] There's a quick search done, search
[32:31] heaven, search the earth.
[32:33] When they say they search beneath the
[32:35] earth, they are talking about the realm
[32:37] of the dead. They go to that paradise
[32:39] and they are looking.
[32:42] They're looking in the sixth dimension
[32:44] for somebody that's worthy to take the
[32:46] book.
[32:48] Even sixth dimension saints are not
[32:50] worthy to take the book.
[32:54] And here comes the high priest because
[32:57] now his sacrifice is accepted and he
[33:00] comes back out of that sanctuary.
[33:04] Bells ringing on his feet because he is
[33:07] alive.
[33:08] The bell signified if he was dead or
[33:10] not. But don't you hear the bells now
[33:15] ringing?
[33:16] Amen.
[33:17] Don't you hear the [singing] angel
[33:19] singing?
[33:22] Amen.
[33:25] He's coming back out of the sanctuary.
[33:27] And when he's coming back out, John is
[33:30] weeping.
[33:31] Yes.
[33:32] And the angel tells him, "Don't weep,
[33:35] John." One of the elders tell John,
[33:38] "Don't weep.
[33:39] For the lion, the tribe of Judah hath
[33:42] prevailed.
[33:43] Amen.
[33:45] Watch his title. As lion of the tribe of
[33:48] Judah, he is king.
[33:50] Yes.
[33:52] But John, who the type of the bride,
[33:57] turns and he looks and he sees the lamb
[34:00] as though it had been slain.
[34:03] Yes.
[34:05] Very important because he's typing two
[34:07] son of son ministries there. one son of
[34:10] David. But when the bride is looking,
[34:13] she still sees him as son of man.
[34:17] Okay? When she looks, she sees a lamb as
[34:21] though it had been slain. So he goes and
[34:23] he takes the book from the one who has
[34:25] the original title deed, which is God
[34:27] Almighty in spirit form.
[34:31] Amen. We preach this many times and we
[34:33] told you it's not the book changing
[34:35] hands but it is the one who has the book
[34:37] changing form.
[34:38] Amen.
[34:39] Amen.
[34:39] Amen.
[34:41] So he takes the book and in symbol type
[34:44] you'll read there in Revelation 6 he
[34:46] starts to break those seals in symbol.
[34:48] Yes.
[34:49] But even as a symbol type John just
[34:51] wrote what he saw in symbols but never
[34:53] understood the interpretation of that
[34:55] symbol. That's right.
[34:58] But here now he comes in Revelation 10.
[35:01] The same one who came out of the
[35:02] sanctuary.
[35:04] Same one who took the book now comes
[35:06] down in the form of a mighty angel.
[35:08] Amen.
[35:10] Brother Brandon says only Christ it
[35:12] could be.
[35:16] Hallelujah.
[35:17] So watch the thought and the point. When
[35:18] he came at the Jordan River, he came
[35:21] down on the wings of love.
[35:23] He came, he sent down his love on the
[35:26] wings of a dove. Now that he's coming in
[35:28] Revelation 10, on the wings of a mighty
[35:30] angel, he is coming with judgment.
[35:33] Yes.
[35:33] Yes. Amen.
[35:35] This is the Goel.
[35:38] Who is the Goel? The Goel is the same
[35:41] redeemer. Boaz was both redeemer and
[35:44] Goel.
[35:46] The Goel is the avenger.
[35:49] The redeemer is not only one full of
[35:51] love. Yes.
[35:53] But with redemption comes judgment.
[35:55] Amen.
[35:57] Amen. So this time he's not coming down
[36:00] on the wings. Amen. Sending down his
[36:03] love on the wings of a dove. But this
[36:05] time he sends judgment on the wings of
[36:07] the mighty angel.
[36:09] And when he comes on the earth, the
[36:10] earth is chaotic.
[36:12] Yes.
[36:13] Men's hearts are failing for fear. Demon
[36:15] powers are let loose on the earth. The
[36:17] kingdom of God is suffering violence.
[36:19] and the violent are taking it by force.
[36:21] Amen. Hell is let loose upon the earth.
[36:24] Morals are corrupted. It's another Sodom
[36:26] and Gomorrah condition again. The
[36:28] messenger of the age has been rejected
[36:30] by the later
[36:33] and Christ is put outside of the church.
[36:36] Yes.
[36:37] That is the condition when the angel
[36:38] descends.
[36:40] And he's coming with fierce wrath.
[36:43] His coming is swift.
[36:46] The prophet when he saw him coming he
[36:48] said before I could bling my eyes he
[36:49] says they came
[36:54] angels said great big wings
[36:57] in a constellation.
[37:02] Amen. What is he coming to do? To
[37:05] execute judgment on the earth. He's not
[37:08] coming on a picnic.
[37:10] Yes. Amen.
[37:11] He's not coming for a social visit.
[37:14] Amen.
[37:16] This same angel descended to Abraham
[37:19] under the same conditions.
[37:24] Amen. The same conditions existed when
[37:26] he descended to Abraham.
[37:29] Sodom was ready for the judgments of God
[37:31] and Abraham and Sarah were ready for the
[37:34] body change.
[37:35] What's the contrast?
[37:37] If you can see the solemn condition,
[37:40] how many of you can testify that the
[37:42] world is in a sodom condition? Amen.
[37:44] Come on now. How many of you can testify
[37:46] the world is in a solemn condition?
[37:48] Then there's a group of people who's
[37:51] ready for the body change.
[37:52] Amen.
[37:53] Has to be
[37:55] scripture cannot be broken.
[37:58] Amen.
[38:00] So with one visit,
[38:03] with one coming of the mighty angel,
[38:06] he is appearing before two people.
[38:12] He appears to Abraham and Sarah
[38:14] and he brings them a rapturing faith
[38:16] message.
[38:16] Amen.
[38:19] And with the same visit, he lets Abraham
[38:21] know about the destruction of Sodom and
[38:23] Gomorrah.
[38:25] Yes.
[38:27] The same thing happened in Revelation
[38:29] 10.
[38:30] One descent,
[38:33] but doing two works.
[38:34] Yes. Amen.
[38:35] Bringing title deed back to the bride.
[38:38] Bringing back title deed. Amen. To the
[38:41] royal descendants of heaven.
[38:43] Amen.
[38:44] And bringing judgment to the world.
[38:48] Amen.
[38:50] What is it? Amateur tribulation.
[38:55] Let's go to the quote. Amen. In uh
[38:58] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[39:00] paragraph 603. He says, "And the church
[39:03] becomes the word by him making her a
[39:07] part of him." So if you ever want to
[39:09] know now learn from these things how if
[39:12] you're saying why how do I become the
[39:13] word? He says by making her a part of
[39:16] him and that's the word again personally
[39:20] identified by him. I'm showing you the
[39:22] reason why he descends with such
[39:24] ferociousness.
[39:30] Here it is. his property alone.
[39:35] You are his property alone.
[39:37] Amen.
[39:38] He will not allow any other man to put
[39:40] his hand on you.
[39:42] Amen.
[39:43] Amen.
[39:44] She is redeemed by him.
[39:47] Through him, for him, and for him alone.
[39:52] Amen.
[39:53] Amen.
[39:54] Hallelujah.
[39:56] No one can touch you. I'm going to read
[39:59] it again.
[40:01] The Bible says you are his property
[40:03] alone. Sorry, the property saying you
[40:05] are his property alone. His property
[40:08] alone. She is redeemed by him, through
[40:11] him, for him, and for him alone.
[40:15] That's right. That then what is the
[40:18] devil howling about?
[40:20] Okay, let me read that right. He said
[40:22] that's what the devil is howling about.
[40:26] That's why he's in a raging fit right
[40:28] now. because the mighty angel has
[40:30] descended to claim his property
[40:33] and he can't get to you.
[40:37] He said what the devil is howling about
[40:41] that is being revealed.
[40:46] He says we're in dangerous time.
[40:48] Remember the scripture says when these
[40:50] things begin to happen, time is no more.
[40:52] What am I trying to do while via this
[40:54] quote? We're just not reading a quote
[40:56] for the sake of reading. I'm trying to
[40:58] show you the conditions on the earth at
[41:00] the time when this angel is coming. We
[41:04] are speaking about on the wings of the
[41:06] mighty angel.
[41:10] He says she is fading away. When we see
[41:12] the manifestation earthquakes, you see
[41:15] them thousands killed the other day.
[41:17] Earthquakes in diverse places. Fearful
[41:20] sights in the sky. Pillars of fire like
[41:22] floating around like flying saucers.
[41:25] They don't know what it is.
[41:28] They don't have an idea.
[41:31] Did you notice the angels that come down
[41:34] investigated Sodom before Sodom was
[41:36] destroyed? You remember that?
[41:39] There was a bunch that come down, three
[41:42] of them. One of them stayed with
[41:43] Abraham. You remember that?
[41:45] There were lights from heaven. That one
[41:48] came down in investigating judgment.
[41:51] Amen.
[41:52] Amen.
[41:54] So we are learning now that this angel
[41:56] is not coming on a picnic.
[41:59] If you watch with what ferociousness is
[42:01] coming
[42:04] to it now
[42:07] he says look now watch if you go and
[42:10] Google this when did they first sight
[42:12] flying saucers
[42:14] angels you'll see it's around the time
[42:17] brother Brandon goes into the ministry
[42:20] because angels are coming down to meet
[42:22] with him in the cave
[42:25] angels are appearing
[42:30] He says look what they found around the
[42:33] Pentagon things they find them that's
[42:36] the world judgment Sodom and there is
[42:38] one represented who will be represented
[42:41] amongst the churches will be Christ
[42:43] himself vindicating himself sights in
[42:47] heaven above and signs in the earth
[42:48] below certainly oh the devil is howling
[42:51] about this
[42:52] yes
[42:52] the manifested truth of the promise of
[42:55] the word in everyone.
[43:00] Sure.
[43:03] Where's the word found?
[43:05] There's another quote where he says,
[43:06] "The word is in the bride as it was in
[43:08] Mary."
[43:10] Here again, let me read it. The
[43:12] manifested truth of the promise of the
[43:14] word in her alone.
[43:17] Amen.
[43:18] The word is in you alone.
[43:22] Amen.
[43:27] In paradox 270, he says, "We see the
[43:30] world geographically. We see the signs,
[43:33] earthquakes in diverse places, nations
[43:36] against nations. Right now, it's
[43:38] happening. We see all these things
[43:40] that's predicted. We see fearful sights
[43:42] in the skies, man's hearts failing,
[43:44] flying sauces and so forth that they
[43:47] can't explain. Investigating judgments
[43:50] coming to the earth." Yes,
[43:52] we see the atomic bombs hanging out
[43:54] yonder. Do you hear it being announced?
[43:57] Atomic bombs. Atomic bombs everywhere.
[43:59] And the great missiles can carry total
[44:02] destruction in an hour.
[44:05] You see, they can't even control their
[44:07] missiles. You saw the Ukrainian missile
[44:10] went and
[44:11] bombed Poland.
[44:14] Now, whether it's a mistake or not,
[44:15] people still died. That's right.
[44:18] Property was still damaged.
[44:23] We see the gases hanging above us there
[44:26] that would rain down the that would rain
[44:28] the fires down out of heaven and destroy
[44:31] the earth. Right.
[44:36] In question and answers you say now in
[44:37] the days in the in this last days the
[44:40] logos that was upon Jesus
[44:45] which he has become from that back to
[44:47] the pillar of fire again has descended
[44:50] down on the earth.
[44:52] Amen.
[44:53] For an investigating judgment.
[44:59] One more quote just to
[45:03] finalize what this points on
[45:05] investigating judgment. This is and
[45:08] knoweth it not 269. The world don't know
[45:10] what that is.
[45:14] You know,
[45:15] you know it's on. We know what it is.
[45:21] That's why I say royal language for us.
[45:24] Amen.
[45:24] We know what it is.
[45:28] You see all this time I was saying the
[45:30] devil is howling, howling, howling. You
[45:32] saying, "Where is the devil howling?"
[45:33] Didn't you see? Believe the sign.
[45:35] Howling.
[45:40] Didn't you see them trying to blast it
[45:41] all over the internet?
[45:42] What are they doing? They're howling
[45:46] because people know what this is.
[45:53] He says the world don't know. You know
[45:55] it's on. We know what it is. See, we
[45:57] know it's investigating judgment angels
[46:01] and how at the Pentagon and all about
[46:04] how it come right down and the
[46:06] intelligence how they go like a flash
[46:08] before and be gone. You must have seen
[46:10] those videos. They're looking and
[46:12] they're fliming this light and suddenly
[46:15] it's gone.
[46:18] He says they go like a flesh and be
[46:20] gone. Pulling away from anything they
[46:22] got. Brother Brandham snaps his fingers.
[46:26] They don't realize what it is. Let them
[46:28] think whatever they want to. They call
[46:30] it flying saucers. They don't know.
[46:38] Now, when the angel is here, we've got
[46:40] to let the angel lead the way.
[46:42] Yes. Amen.
[46:44] That is why we do not we do not have a
[46:47] roster. I cannot predict and tell you
[46:49] the next five services what is going to
[46:51] be preached.
[46:53] Because when the angel of the Lord is
[46:54] here, we let the angel of the Lord lead.
[46:58] Let's find it in my angel shall go
[47:00] before thee. Next quote, if you've got
[47:01] it there,
[47:02] he says the trouble of it, we try to get
[47:05] ahead of the angel.
[47:09] You see, even if he called us to preach,
[47:11] we must wait for the angel.
[47:12] Amen.
[47:13] Because the prophet says, "She has thus
[47:16] said the Lord or she keeps still."
[47:18] Amen.
[47:19] So sometimes even even when I was not
[47:22] the pastor if I didn't have a message I
[47:25] do not jump at every opportunity pastor
[47:27] Ronnie asked me to preach if I didn't
[47:29] have a message I would tell him sorry I
[47:31] don't have anything
[47:33] she keeps quiet if she don't have thus
[47:36] sayith the lord
[47:37] we don't look at just jumping up in the
[47:39] pulpit and preaching
[47:42] if a man knows that he has a message
[47:44] from the Lord he to bring it forth for
[47:45] the people
[47:47] amen so he says says, "Let the angel
[47:49] lead the way and he will lead us to the
[47:52] fountain of the water of life and give
[47:55] it to us freely."
[47:56] Amen.
[47:58] You see, if we let the angel lead the
[48:00] way, he leads us to the fountain of the
[48:02] water of life and we have it freely.
[48:06] Amen.
[48:10] Now, if you notice the scene, we're
[48:11] going to try and bring this to a close
[48:13] now and just highlight what he's doing
[48:16] here on the wings of a mighty angel.
[48:19] We're talking about the proclamation
[48:20] today.
[48:22] What is he doing? As soon as he
[48:24] descends,
[48:27] he
[48:27] roars
[48:36] because it's the lion of the tribe of
[48:38] Judah.
[48:40] He's bringing a proclamation from the
[48:42] throne room of heaven who said the one
[48:45] that's carrying the proclamation is an
[48:47] important figure.
[48:50] Now he's bringing an important message
[48:52] from heaven. Why is he roaring like a
[48:55] lion?
[48:56] The Bible says he cried with a loud
[48:58] voice like when a lion roar.
[49:02] There's chaos on the earth.
[49:06] There's too much noise upon the earth.
[49:11] And in the jungles of Africa, not these
[49:15] zoo lions now,
[49:17] in the jungles of Africa, when the lion
[49:20] roars,
[49:22] everything shuts up.
[49:24] Yes.
[49:32] Amen. An important message from the
[49:35] king. Everyone must shut up.
[49:39] Everything must shut up.
[49:42] I'm going to say something now.
[49:47] Even heaven goes silent at this
[49:49] proclamation.
[49:51] Amen.
[49:52] Amen.
[49:54] Amen.
[49:55] I've said enough there.
[49:58] That's a big chunk of meat right there.
[50:01] Amen.
[50:03] When the lion roars,
[50:07] why will heaven go silent if that's not
[50:10] the king?
[50:15] I just tried to explain to you that you
[50:16] are both royal queen of heaven and
[50:18] earth.
[50:20] Now that he roars on the earth, even
[50:23] heaven pays attention.
[50:26] Yes. Amen.
[50:29] Silence on the earth. Silence in heaven.
[50:32] What is he doing? The mighty angel roars
[50:34] like a lion. Everything shuts up. Amen.
[50:37] We said, you know, the lion is the king
[50:39] of the jungle. So too is the lion of the
[50:41] tribe of Judah, king. He's king of
[50:43] kings. Amen. But his subjects are not
[50:46] the only ones on the earth alone. But he
[50:50] has royal subjects in heaven.
[50:52] Amen.
[50:52] And even they silent.
[50:56] The prophet describes it this way. in a
[50:58] suspense of time in that moment where
[51:02] everything hangs in the balance he's
[51:04] coming to execute judgment on the earth
[51:07] and he's also bringing title deed back
[51:09] to Adam's fallen race
[51:12] because redemption is the greatest
[51:14] thought of God
[51:17] it's the ultimate plan
[51:19] so they want to see how it all ends I
[51:21] want you to know we are in the final act
[51:23] this is the end
[51:26] these are the closing scenes
[51:30] So when he comes to return title D to
[51:32] the royal descendants, what must he do?
[51:36] I told you it's chaotic.
[51:38] The greatest battle is being fought.
[51:40] So he descends with one foot on the one
[51:43] beast and one foot on the other beast.
[51:46] Yes.
[51:47] Yes.
[51:47] Amen.
[51:48] Amen.
[51:49] They are rising up out of the the earth.
[51:52] One out of the earth, one out of the
[51:53] sea. So he descends and he puts
[51:58] his foot on there.
[52:05] Amen. And as long as his feet is on
[52:08] their head, as long as his feet is on
[52:10] their head,
[52:12] they cannot operate with the full
[52:13] authority they want to.
[52:15] That's why you see America trying to
[52:16] flex their muscle, but they don't know.
[52:18] They they are singing, I was shackled by
[52:21] a heavy burden. The pope is singing,
[52:24] "Need [singing] the Lord of the mighty
[52:27] angel."
[52:33] Then the mighty angel crushed me. And
[52:36] now I'm no longer the same.
[52:40] For he crushed me. Oh, he crushed me.
[52:47] They are feeling the weight of the
[52:48] mighty angel.
[52:50] Their wrath cannot be unleashed upon the
[52:52] earth as long as that mighty angel is
[52:54] here.
[52:55] As long as they're the people.
[52:57] Amen.
[52:57] Why is he so angry? This angel.
[53:00] Why is he so ferocious?
[53:02] Because of you and I.
[53:06] He's descended in this hour because of
[53:08] you and I.
[53:09] Amen.
[53:09] And he's come to take control.
[53:13] So that you can go free. Amen.
[53:18] Do you know if the angel didn't descend
[53:20] and he just sent his word by a man, you
[53:23] wouldn't have been able to get to that
[53:25] word.
[53:26] Satan would have overcome you on every
[53:28] trial,
[53:29] every circumstance because you are still
[53:32] in a flesh body fighting fleshly
[53:34] battles.
[53:36] But he must come to contain those two
[53:38] powers
[53:39] like he ascended that descended that day
[53:41] in the midst of Joshua's camp.
[53:44] He's come to set the battle in the rain
[53:46] so that you can have the victory. Amen.
[53:48] Let's move. So as long as his head is on
[53:50] on these two beasts here, they cannot
[53:52] rise to full authority yet. That is why
[53:54] they are trying to change laws and move.
[53:57] Amen. To change laws, but they are not
[53:59] fully in control.
[54:00] Amen.
[54:02] Amen.
[54:04] It was time for the mighty angel to come
[54:06] down. Same thing happened when they
[54:08] tried to throw those three Hebrew boys
[54:10] into the fiery furnace.
[54:13] Amen. This was not a job for an ordinary
[54:16] angel.
[54:18] So God said, "I will go down myself."
[54:21] Amen.
[54:21] And as they began to take these three
[54:23] boys and they're about to throw them in,
[54:27] they just threw them in and there's a
[54:28] four man in that furnace.
[54:30] Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:37] Even the ones that bow down before the
[54:40] image that was set before them
[54:43] got burnt. Yet the fire was not meant
[54:45] for them.
[54:47] There's a type right there.
[54:49] The ones, you know, that were trying to
[54:51] bind these three Hebrew boys and throw
[54:54] them in. The Bible says the fire was so
[54:56] hot that they got burnt. Yes.
[54:58] Amen.
[54:59] But did they bow down before that image?
[55:01] They had to bow down because there's
[55:03] only three that didn't bow down that
[55:05] day.
[55:06] So even these people that were binding
[55:08] them. So I'm trying to show you that
[55:09] those that bow down before the image of
[55:11] the beast will be burnt.
[55:13] Yes.
[55:15] Amen.
[55:16] And the ones that do not bow down will
[55:18] be saved.
[55:19] Amen. Amen.
[55:22] Amen. So right now they are changing
[55:23] laws trying to control but they do not
[55:25] know what this heavy burden is.
[55:28] It's the mighty angel.
[55:33] Amen.
[55:38] So the royal subject must be taken off
[55:40] the earth and he's going to do it in a
[55:42] royal fashion. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's
[55:45] go to brother Caleb. Let's go to I don't
[55:46] have it there on the slide. Let's just
[55:48] type it up. Psalm 50. I want to show you
[55:50] this condition. Why it's so temptious
[55:52] around and why is it so fierce and so
[55:55] rare? Amen. Why is he roaring like a
[55:57] lion? Why is seven thunders roaring
[56:00] their voices? It's a battle.
[56:04] If a trumpet blows an uncertain sound,
[56:06] who shall prepare for battle? But the
[56:09] seven thunders come to sound a certain
[56:11] sound.
[56:14] He says here of the mighty God. This is
[56:16] the same one that descended. Now
[56:19] is David in the Psalms a prophetic
[56:21] writer?
[56:22] Yes.
[56:22] Amen.
[56:23] So here he is writing about Revelation
[56:25] 10.
[56:27] The mighty God even the Lord had spoken.
[56:30] Did he cry with a loud voice?
[56:33] And called to the earth from the rising
[56:36] of the sun to the going down thereof.
[56:38] Did he raise his hands up to heaven?
[56:42] out of Zion the perfection God had the
[56:46] perfection of beauty God had shined
[56:48] right so it go straight to you the bride
[56:50] now that's what he's coming for he says
[56:52] our God shall come and shall not keep
[56:55] silence
[56:56] a fire shall devour before him is his
[57:00] feet like flames of fire
[57:03] so it must be pretty hot on those two
[57:05] beast head
[57:07] a fire shall devour before him and it
[57:10] shall be very tempest estuous round
[57:12] about him.
[57:16] Amen. He shall call to the heavens from
[57:18] above and to the earth that he may judge
[57:20] his people.
[57:23] Here's the rapture now. Gather my saints
[57:25] together unto me, those that have made a
[57:28] covenant with me by sacrifice.
[57:30] Amen.
[57:31] What a prophetic writer this is.
[57:33] Amen.
[57:35] Gather my saints together. The rapture
[57:39] them that have made a covenant. Blood
[57:41] covenant, blood covenant, sacrifice of
[57:43] the lamb.
[57:45] Amen.
[57:45] With me by sacrifice. Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:51] So you can see Revelation 10. He's
[57:54] coming to execute judgment.
[57:58] He's coming on the wings of a mighty
[58:00] angel. Now what is he coming for? Let's
[58:02] bring this to a close. The Lord is going
[58:04] to pronounce a final victory.
[58:06] Amen.
[58:08] Amen.
[58:08] Amen. That's what we are moving towards
[58:11] right now.
[58:13] Oh army of the living God,
[58:15] march forward. We are heading to our
[58:17] final victory.
[58:19] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. What is the
[58:22] final victory? The voice of the
[58:24] archangel. One of these days he's going
[58:27] to call the names of the ones that is
[58:30] found in the book and out of the graves
[58:32] and out of the dust of the earth are
[58:34] going to come forth bodies.
[58:37] Amen.
[58:37] Amen.
[58:39] Hallelujah.
[58:41] The Bible says he shall descend from
[58:43] heaven with a shout,
[58:45] with the voice of the archangel and with
[58:47] the trump of God. The shout is to gather
[58:50] the living saints.
[58:52] That's already taken place.
[58:54] That is still going on right now.
[58:57] But then the ministry will change to the
[59:00] voice of the archangel and he shall call
[59:03] to the sixth dimension.
[59:05] And he shall call Amen. And from the
[59:08] dust of the earth, 16 elements shall
[59:10] come forth. Amen. They could have been
[59:12] thrown into the deepest sea. They could
[59:15] have been ate up by lions. They could
[59:17] have been burned by fire. But when that
[59:19] voice of the archangel begin to call,
[59:22] amen, from the earth shall come forth,
[59:25] bodies that will be formed, amen, in the
[59:27] brilliance of the youth. And on that,
[59:30] amen, will come on the earth, bodies
[59:32] standing there.
[59:34] Amen. And then from that six these
[59:36] bodies cannot operate on their own.
[59:38] Amen. So he will empty out that sixth
[59:41] dimension and their theophony bodies
[59:44] will come down from that dimension and
[59:46] it will come down and merge with their
[59:48] flesh bodies on the earth and they will
[59:50] become a glorified body.
[59:53] Thank you Lord.
[59:56] Don't fear death.
[59:59] Amen.
[59:59] Brother Brandham says death is an open
[1:00:01] doorway.
[1:00:02] Yes.
[1:00:05] Amen. The voice of the archangel is
[1:00:08] going to call for the names that are
[1:00:10] found in the book. The sleeping saints
[1:00:12] names are found in the book.
[1:00:15] Amen.
[1:00:16] So you must call their names as well.
[1:00:21] And they shall come forth. Amen.
[1:00:25] Hallelujah. And that is going to be the
[1:00:27] final victory.
[1:00:30] So I want to sum it up by this and tell
[1:00:33] you
[1:00:34] he came with a message of love on the
[1:00:37] wings of a dove.
[1:00:40] But he comes now with judgment on the
[1:00:42] wings of a mighty angel.
[1:00:45] He did the same thing in the days of
[1:00:47] Abraham.
[1:00:50] The only thing this time
[1:00:53] Abraham and Sarah were having a body
[1:00:56] change to bring forth a natural son. The
[1:00:59] only thing in the type is here. He's
[1:01:02] bringing a message of our body change
[1:01:04] and we will be united with the son.
[1:01:08] Amen. I'm going to close with this
[1:01:11] thought I had on the way to church.
[1:01:14] Why are there only seven steps to
[1:01:16] perfection?
[1:01:18] And what happens after perfection?
[1:01:24] After perfection, he comes down and he
[1:01:27] caps the lives of the believers.
[1:01:30] There's seven steps and then the
[1:01:32] capstone is Christ.
[1:01:35] A man who reaches perfection,
[1:01:38] a man who comes into the image and
[1:01:40] likeness of God,
[1:01:43] he cannot be contained or restricted by
[1:01:46] a three-dimensional world.
[1:01:48] Amen.
[1:01:52] I've said enough. Let's stand. That's
[1:01:54] too powerful right there.
[1:01:57] We are climbing up to perfection.
[1:01:59] Yes.
[1:02:01] a man who comes into perfection.
[1:02:04] And that's the man Enoch was.
[1:02:07] Amen.
[1:02:10] Three dimensional world couldn't keep
[1:02:11] him bound.
[1:02:12] Amen. [laughter]
[1:02:15] Amen.
[1:02:16] Amen. [applause]
[1:02:17] Amen.
[1:02:18] So, let's keep climbing.
[1:02:20] Amen.
[1:02:20] Let's keep moving up to perfection.
[1:02:22] Yes, Lord.
[1:02:23] This world cannot defy you.
[1:02:25] Gravity will not be able to defy you.
[1:02:28] Amen. You shall be changed in the
[1:02:30] moment, in the twinkling of an eye. The
[1:02:32] message came on the wings of a mighty
[1:02:35] angel.
[1:02:38] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:02:39] Amen. Brothers, you know, this is not
[1:02:42] the end. You know, we can go on and on
[1:02:44] and on and on.
[1:02:46] Amen. There's so much in the word.
[1:02:48] [music] We can just have a jubilee right
[1:02:50] now.
[1:02:51] Amen. But we just also want to go into
[1:02:54] [music] the baptism as well. Amen.
[1:02:57] Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] Blessed [music] be the name of the Lord.
[1:03:01] Let's see what's the attraction on that
[1:03:03] mountain. While the world is groping in
[1:03:06] darkness and don't even know what this
[1:03:08] attraction is, we know
[1:03:14] what's [singing and music] the
[1:03:15] attraction on that mountain. [music]
[1:03:22] What's going [singing] on on Mount
[1:03:25] [music] Sunet?
[1:03:30] God [singing] has come down to vindicate
[1:03:32] [music]
[1:03:34] his word. It's uniting [singing]
[1:03:37] time for Christ and his bride.
[1:03:42] Oh, [music]
[1:03:44] what's the [singing] attraction on that
[1:03:47] mountain? [music]
[1:03:51] What's going on [singing]
[1:03:54] on [music] Mount Sunet?
[1:03:58] The God has [singing] come [music] down
[1:04:00] to vindicate
[1:04:03] his word. It's uniting
[1:04:05] [music and singing]
[1:04:06] time for Christ and his bride. [music]
[1:04:11] Amen. Let's bow our heads for prayer.
[1:04:14] Amen. And if you want to be remembered
[1:04:16] in prayer and you say, "Lord, [music]
[1:04:19] I see with what ferociousness you have
[1:04:20] come down in this hour. You've come to
[1:04:23] silence your critics. You've roared like
[1:04:25] a lion." [music] Amen. Seven thunders
[1:04:29] begin to utter their voices. [music]
[1:04:33] And when the lion roars, he strikes fear
[1:04:37] in that jungle. Everything must shut up.
[1:04:42] He's coming with a proclamation.
[1:04:45] He's coming with a message of the hour.
[1:04:47] Amen.
[1:04:48] That's what the mighty angel has
[1:04:49] descended for. [music]
[1:04:51] And I want you to know the proclamation
[1:04:53] is the message of the hour. [music]
[1:04:55] Amen.
[1:04:56] He's come with a mighty proclamation,
[1:04:59] a shout to gather the living saints.
[1:05:03] [music]
[1:05:04] Amen. Don't miss it for anything, dear
[1:05:07] brothers and sisters.
[1:05:09] Don't miss it for anything.
[1:05:11] Don't fool around with the world and all
[1:05:13] that it has to offer.
[1:05:15] Let's get our lives right with God.
[1:05:17] Let's let's not see how far away we can
[1:05:20] get from God, but let's see how close we
[1:05:22] can get to God.
[1:05:23] Amen.
[1:05:24] Amen. Let's not now that we've come so
[1:05:26] far, try to backslide and just take
[1:05:29] ease. Amen. Don't be like that man who
[1:05:30] said, "Oh, soul take thy ease. Let me
[1:05:32] tear down these barns and build bigger
[1:05:34] barns." No. Let's see how close we can
[1:05:37] get to God. Let's walk. This road is a
[1:05:39] narrow way. It's a hard way. It's a
[1:05:42] narrow way. [singing] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:46] Hallelujah.
[1:05:48] And if the mighty angel has roared over
[1:05:49] your life this morning, maybe you're
[1:05:52] just been in a slump, in a condition,
[1:05:54] but the angel has roared to remind you
[1:05:57] that these are the closing scenes and
[1:05:59] the royal proclamation has been made.
[1:06:03] Amen. Then get back in line. Step back
[1:06:05] in line. [music]
[1:06:06] It's time to move, church. It's time to
[1:06:08] move. Not time to play. It's time to
[1:06:10] move.
[1:06:13] There's a great battle. Amen. There's a
[1:06:14] great army marching. No time to slack
[1:06:17] down. [music] No time to set up tent.
[1:06:19] Time to move.
[1:06:21] Amen. [music]
[1:06:22] Hallelujah. You want to raise your hand
[1:06:24] at this time and say, "Lord, I have a
[1:06:27] need. I have a desire. Speak to me.
[1:06:30] Lord, I want a closer walk with you."
[1:06:32] You can raise your hand at this time
[1:06:33] even as we pray. Great God, heavenly
[1:06:36] father, we come before you and we thank
[1:06:38] you, Lord,
[1:06:40] for your word, Lord. It's so powerful.
[1:06:41] It's so quick. It's so sharp, oh God,
[1:06:45] that it can discern our hearts and our
[1:06:46] thoughts. Father, I pray, Lord, this
[1:06:48] morning, Father, even as their hands are
[1:06:50] raised, that you will meet them at the
[1:06:51] point of their need. Lord, we know,
[1:06:53] Father, their needs may defer one from
[1:06:55] another. But you are the mighty angel
[1:06:57] who is in the midst right now. And you
[1:06:59] came with a message of proclamation on
[1:07:01] the wings of that mighty angel. And you
[1:07:03] are here right now, Father. And Lord,
[1:07:05] your angel wing can touch them right
[1:07:07] now. Father, your hand can touch them
[1:07:09] right now, oh God. And Father, your hand
[1:07:12] can touch their lips of clay right now,
[1:07:14] Father, with a call from heaven, oh God,
[1:07:16] that they'll say, "Woe is me. I'm a man
[1:07:19] of unclean lips. And I dwell in a land
[1:07:21] of unclean people."
[1:07:22] Amen.
[1:07:23] Father, even as Lord, we believe it's a
[1:07:25] prophetic outpouring this morning.
[1:07:27] Father, you are right in line, right in
[1:07:29] step, Father, with the progression of
[1:07:31] the church, oh God. We believe it's the
[1:07:33] angel of God leading us every step of
[1:07:35] the way. And I pray Lord that you would
[1:07:37] meet us at the point of our need. I pray
[1:07:39] you will heal the sick, oh God. Every
[1:07:41] sick person, oh God, I pray, oh Lord,
[1:07:44] that right now, Father, in the mighty
[1:07:46] name of Jesus, they will receive the
[1:07:48] healing. They will receive a miracle
[1:07:50] touch from the Lord, oh God, and they
[1:07:52] will be made every withhold. Father, I
[1:07:54] pray, Lord Jesus, that you will, Father,
[1:07:56] give them a closer walk with you, Lord.
[1:07:59] And may there be a double portion
[1:08:00] anointing come upon them, Father. Those
[1:08:02] that desire a closer walk with you,
[1:08:04] grant to them the desire of their heart.
[1:08:06] Glo those that Lord desire, Father, the
[1:08:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost, Father, I
[1:08:10] pray you'll fill them up, oh God. And
[1:08:12] those, Father, I pray, Lord, for our
[1:08:14] dear sister Jayen and Janice, oh God,
[1:08:16] even as Lord, they made this decision,
[1:08:18] Lord, to come into that watery grave and
[1:08:20] will die to themselves, oh God, and will
[1:08:23] go, Lord, through, Lord, that burial
[1:08:25] process, Father, and shall be
[1:08:26] resurrected in you. I pray Lord that you
[1:08:28] will come down Lord like you came down
[1:08:31] Lord on the day of Pentecost and fill
[1:08:33] them Lord with your anointing father.
[1:08:35] Fill them with the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:37] Ghost. May there be daughters of God who
[1:08:39] stand in this hour Lord as a testimony
[1:08:42] to the world of your salvation power and
[1:08:44] what you are doing in this day Lord
[1:08:46] Jesus. And I pray Lord that you'll bless
[1:08:48] them all the days of their life. Bless
[1:08:50] them every step of the way. Whatever
[1:08:52] decisions they make in life oh God I
[1:08:54] pray you'll bless their plans, bless
[1:08:56] their purposes Lord. Lord, even as they
[1:08:58] seek your face, Lord, bless, Lord, the
[1:08:59] mom and dad, oh God, I pray, Lord, even
[1:09:02] as they have raised up their daughters,
[1:09:03] Lord, in the admonition and fear of the
[1:09:06] Lord, I thank you, Lord Jesus, for their
[1:09:08] lives. And I pray, Lord, that you'll
[1:09:09] bless them, Lord, even as they have
[1:09:11] raised up these two young daughters,
[1:09:13] Father. I pray, Lord, and Lord, I'm sure
[1:09:15] they dedicated them to you, [music]
[1:09:17] Lord, many years ago. And now, Father,
[1:09:19] they come back to you to be baptized in
[1:09:21] your name, oh God. [music]
[1:09:23] We give you glory and we give you
[1:09:24] praise, oh God. We pray Lord that you
[1:09:27] would bless each and every one of us,
[1:09:28] the hearer of the word. And even as we
[1:09:30] further continue now, we pray Lord that
[1:09:32] you'll bless us in this time. Even as
[1:09:34] Lord, the angels of God are rejoicing in
[1:09:36] heaven. We rejoice here on the earth, oh
[1:09:39] God.
[1:09:40] We bless your name and we pray you'll be
[1:09:41] with us now for the remainder of this
[1:09:43] meeting. We ask these blessings in the
[1:09:46] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:09:48] with much thanksgiving. Amen. Amen. You
[1:09:51] may be seated.
[1:09:53] God bless you.
[1:09:56] Amen. So, we do have the baptismal pool
[1:09:59] out here. Amen. [music] We thought it
[1:10:02] might be inconvenient if we had gathered
[1:10:04] somewhere else to do the baptism [music]
[1:10:07] and we really wanted you to witness the
[1:10:09] baptism and be a part of it. Amen. So,
[1:10:12] we made it convenient for everyone and
[1:10:15] we'll go now straight to the baptism.
[1:10:17] Amen. We can just greet one another
[1:10:18] outside but [music] I don't want you to
[1:10:20] start to talk other stories and other
[1:10:23] things. Just be in [singing] the frame
[1:10:25] and right mind of the service. [music]
[1:10:27] Just greet one another. God bless you.
[1:10:29] Give them a smile. You're allowed to
[1:10:30] smile. Amen. And then we'll just gather
[1:10:33] around the baptismal pool there and
[1:10:35] we'll do the baptism. God bless you.
[1:10:36] [music] Amen. The Lord bless you and
[1:10:38] keep you. Amen.
