confession that an inward work has been done amen and sister Janiece wants to get baptized let's give the Lord a good act of praise for that amen and I pray even as the amen take the step to walk in

work you don't have to be tense amen you're in the presence of your father the King of Kings and the Lord of lords amen hallelujah so this morning we'll continue with our amen series queen of Queens this is part five amen and we'll speak on hallelujah amen what is thy request what is that petition even to off the kingdom amen Hallelujah we'll turn to Hebrews chapter 4 as the start of our scripture because we know that there was a change in the scene Esther is a beautiful book because it starts out with a beautiful scene of the king and his kingdom and now he wants to flaunt the wealth of his kingdom and after he he does a tremendous display of all his witches he wants to bring forth his most prized possession and like the Lord says we are his victory the queen of Queens is his victory amen the final thing that he can show and the reason for his death is us the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ now this King aserus wants to bring forth his most beautiful beloved shroud and not trophy do we don't believe in Trophy Wives but his most beloved treasure and bringer and show the people because the Bible says she was very beautiful but she refused to come and if you're we're not reading that now but I'm just giving you the background and he called seven chamberlains to call vasty to the feast to call her out and seven churches Messengers have gone out into the world to call it right out but we find at the end of that seven Church age they refuse to come they even locked the door and shut him out yes amen so that's when the king makes he consults his wise men and they make a declaration put vasty away lest the rest of the woman start a woman's Liberation and say that we want to be like basti and we won't obey our husbands so they started the Pentecostal I'm not the original Pentecostal church now but they started the denominational Pentecostal eyelid system right there okay so from there you'll see the scene changing there there's a time now where they are looking amongst the young virgins we spoke on Wednesday about the ten virgins amen so they were looking amongst the virgins and there was one who was obedient to the one who was instructing her and even now that she was going to approach the king for the first time she only took what he advised them to take right the same way we the one that was commissioned to find a bride for the Lord Jesus Christ because when he was looking for the scripture he said go hunt me a bride like elieza so he has designed his job he's designed to find the Lord Jesus Christ a virgin bride in this hour so the only thing he gave us was the word pure and adulterated word and he said take this and go into the presence of the king amen amen and when we take the pure word undiluted amen and go before his presence we are accepted amen and then we are now placed Queen amongst all queens yes Amen in his Royal Kingdom and now the marriage has taken place but then there is now a change in the scene she's now Queen in the Kingdom and she may have been Queen for many years but there's now a threat upon her life and the life of her people there's coming a persecution whether you believe it or not this coming a squeeze whether you believe it or not and if you do not have boldness to go into the presence of the king and call on him amen you are going to be left to the ones that are pursuing you so let's read Hebrews 4 and 14. it says seeing then we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God so where is Jesus he's in the heavens let us all fast our profession for we for we have not an eye priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin so once Jesus tempted with adultery yes was he tempted of fornication was he tempted with the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life the Bible says he was tempted on all points but yet without sin now here's the point we want to get to because you know we're getting to the point where Esther enters the throne room so he tells us in verse 16 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need amen Esther was in a great time of need the bride right now is in a great time of need but we know need to come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain favor and find Grace to help in the time of need amen may the Lord a blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so as amen just to uh talk about it as you know today there is something happening on Mount Sinai we spoke about this on Wednesday amen so you know they have they have now the one agreement that was signed in September the final document for the world religions to unite now under the U.N the climate change the pope has now called for them to go to Mount Sinai and re-establish The Ten Commandments not the original Ten Commandments that was given to Moses and his people now watch how significant it is because God called his chosen people to Mount Sinai and he took his Prophet up onto that mountain and the glory Cloud descended upon that mountain and he gave his chosen people Ten Commandments to live by he didn't call all the nations of the world he didn't call the Philistines and the hittite and all the other ice to Mount Sinai but he called a specific class of people to Mount Sinai and he gave them his word to live by now that they have formed a one-word religion the First Act is to go back to Mount Sinai with all the religions and form another ten commandments why are they doing this they are believing that they are caused the chaos upon the Earth in the terms of climate change and we showed you that in Revelation chapter 11 verse 18 how God is going to destroy them that destroy the Earth so man knows that he has destroyed the Earth and now they're coming for ten ten plus one brother Caleb okay they want to add 11th one as well but we do have an 11. they didn't just add one because when Jesus came he said what was the 11th commandment you know it hey that you are my disciples if you have loved one for another you see Satan is a copycat so the 11th commandment is love and you remember what the prophet teaches us that all the Commandments are Rapture around one thing which is love because if you love your neighbor you won't steal his wife if you love your neighbor you won't kill him you won't steal right so the all the Commandments are wrapped around love and Jesus was the personification of love and so we see here what we're looking at is Esther because Esther there's two books in the Bible that are named after women both typing the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ one book is Ruth where Boaz is the great Redeemer and he redeems Ruth a gentile a moabite he redeems her and the second one she now suits his Queen Esther so two books in the Bible very precise amen showing you the condition of the church woman and a position that she is going to be one redeemed second she is going to sit as Queen because the one who overcomes later seer told in us to come and sit with me on my throne all right and we are Believing by faith that we have already overcome leaders here hallelujah how many of you can speak by faith yeah amen that we have already overcome this age amen we need to speak it by faith we need to believe it by faith because we're calling those things that are not as though they are amen amen why we are life of his life Spirit of his Spirit the same characteristics that Jesus had we have even before Jesus was dead and they crucified him he said destroy this Temple and in three days I shall raise it up again amen amen what was he speaking he was speaking the revelation of his faith hey so this bride needs to speak amen hallelujah I shall overcome this age amen I shall not be defeated by the enemy yes or any of his teams amen so we find here what is happening that four times she comes into the presence of the king four different times and four different times his words are added to Queen Esther so four times the king asked Esther a question and he empowers Esther every time with the ability to speak and to ask so in the presence of the king with a royal ship to raise the king empowers Esther and what is he saying what is that petition what is thy request even throughout the kingdom except on that fourth time the fourth time he doesn't say even to ask the kingdom but three times he tells her even to ask the kingdom amen there's a reason for all of that now what we're trying to get through is tie this with the four anointings now let's pick this up for the Caleb in the fifth seal let's read from paragraph 141 amen and see uh before we get into that I just want to show you what the prophet says about these four anointings and how they were going so that you can see it where history is going into the presence of the king because the king is a lion um hello the king is a lion and she comes under that lion anointing amen if we get it amen in the full steal paragraph 141 it says now the first words that lion that Roar that pure unadulterated word the second entire theory was the ox a beast of burden and it was also a sacrificial peace wasn't exactly the poor little church Romans settled down there to A Thousand Years of Dark Ages and anything that didn't profess to be the Roman Church was put to death immediately they had to labor go from place to place so that's the second anointing under the ox right he says in 144 now now if you notice that was packing and preserving that Bible and they had to labor among one another there you are the ox he said don't you Earth the oil and the wine 145 what did they do they willingly walked up there and died now watch Esther was willing to walk up there and die they didn't but care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrificed labor and they walked up just as freely as they could walk Anointed with the true spirit of God of that age that's why I tell you we need a revelation that we have been anointed for the age yeah and died like Heroes a sacrifice thousand times thousands see eight million of them on the record 68 million Christians lay down their life for this gospel amen 147 he says now the third piece that went out from the devil was the black horse see 148 he says the third piece that went out a power from God to combat him to combat the powers of the black horse was a man cunning smart with the wisdom of God and we're gonna watch Esther operate in that cunning wisdom smart knows how to get Amen in trouble you know a man is smarter than any of the beasts he's smarter cause he cannot witch him mostly he is turning through now I already want you to know that the spirit of God is already here because what you are hearing this morning you will never hear anywhere else amen when yesterday is being preached you'll never get those four anointings tied in there so already know the spirit of God is here and you better get involved in the service amen amen amen the third piece that wins out a power from God to combat him to combat the powers of the black horse was a man telling smart with the wisdom of God you know a man is the smarter than any of the beasts he is smarter because he can outwit him mostly he is scanning shrewd 150 he went out to Convent him with the canniness of God's wisdom in him so it wasn't the wisdom of a man it was God's wisdom in man that was the age of the Reformation Martin Luther John Wesley and so forth it was the Reformation zwingly Knox Calvin who all went out it was the cunningness now you watch exactly from the Dark Age from the Reformation this way it was the shrewdness of man so that's where your third anointing we gotta go to The Sixth Seal to pick up that fought anointing because this is the one I wanted amen the fourth anointing in The Sixth Seal paragraph 385 amen he says here and father today we stand here by your grace and we are only here because of his grace amen right now this is in his prayer paragraph 385 you'll pick it up amen father today we stand here by your grace and it's not because that it's a special people but it's because just like in the day of the lion or the ox or the man it's the eagle time is the anointing of the hour it's the time that we are living here it's the working of the holy spirit for this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead amen amen and if you're Jesus is dead then bury your Jesus and come to the Lord Jesus Christ amen yes amen Hallelujah amen so we find here we'll have to go to Esther chapter 5 now and pick up these things amen Esther chapter 5 and verse 3. so he said amen King service he is the king he's ruling in this Kingdom now before Esther could come into the presence of the king she made preparation and I want to put the denominational World on notice forget your Daniel Fast it will get you nowhere try the extra fast because the Daniel Fast he only ate vegetables amen but here the the extra fast is different hallelujah amen the Queen's fast is different nobody wants to talk about it's just fast we're not going into that but you can reach up to four and see Estes fast she got Mordecai too far she got the people to fast and she herself began to fast before she came into the presence of the king amen so let's read from verse 3. so now remember the scene is the throne room of the king there's a declaration gone across the land and everyone is fearful to ever come before the presence of the king that anyone who comes into the presence of the king uninvited shall be put to death and Esther informs Mordecai about this but she comes to that decision where she says if I perish I perish amen because Mordecai had told her who knows if you've been called into the kingdom for such a time as this you think you've gone there to live a royal life of luxury you are there to labor amen the life of a queen in the message of the hour is not just to live under the Royal blessings amen but you are to label to find the last one it's a sacrificial life yeah amen so the lion is King and under the lion anointing here you ask her a question she comes boldly before the presence of the king and she's watching Remember the situation is now tense she doesn't know if you're gonna raise up the Royal scripture because in a moment's time she'll be good taken away and killed but she walks there before the king and she's singing into thy presence we can't not by the works we have done but by thy Grace and thy Grace and then he raises at the Royal Center breathe a sigh of relief now we pick it up then the king said unto her what world thou Queen Esther remember Israel referring to her by a royal title yes now what will thou number one what do you want what is that request he doesn't need to go to the next part to surrender even to off his kingdom but he goes further and he says it shall be given thee even to a half the kingdom he don't even know why she's coming before him oh I want you to know he's reflecting the heart of the father that anytime you go before the father he's willing to give it all for you amen are we willing to ask of him this morning yeah what will thou communister what is thy request it shall be given thee to half the kingdom now watch Esther doesn't go straight to the heart of the problem a first request is this and Esther answered if it seemed good unto the king let the king and amen come this day unto the banquet I have prepared for him that's only the question know how to approach the king some of us as soon as we go Lord you know this day was so terrible and hard Lord oh I don't you bombarding heaven but into his gates with Thanksgiving amen tell me to his courts With Praise Jesus taught us how to praise His Our Father who child in heaven Hallowed be thy name amen thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven you're inviting the presence of Heaven down then it says give not the first opening prayer okay so he said no notice the answers first thing is come to a banquet now I just want to detail this if we go to Esther 1 1 he told her what is my request what is your petition even to ask the kingdom I want you to know what this entails it came to pass in the days of a service he reigned from India to Ethiopia and he had 170 what's up 127 provinces under his domain and Rule amen and he was willing to give us 63.5 percent not percent 63.5 provinces he was willing to give Esther he was ruling your great great great great great great great great grandfather he was the king over India all the way through to Ethiopia and he told Esther I'll give you even to a half of his kingdoms I'm telling you that for a reason amen he wants to share his glory with no man but the one through whom he will reveal himself through okay so after Kingdom I just needed to detail that but here's the answer now the world today wants to empower women the false way they want to make women a sex goddess they want to empower her by telling her she has the right to abort a seed that's within her it's your body your right but Christ is the one that truly empowers the woman amen I I also want to say that I want to empower you this morning and I want to empower the woman here this morning because as God is my witness some of us have never said an amen in the church you ask yourself you're sitting next to your neighbor now for the last we started at 10. one hour did you hear an amen coming out please check if they're breathing look to the left look to the right just check are you okay okay no more reaction Christian there's you know you always want to teach your children how to behave and how to speak in public normal Christian reaction is Amen to the word praise the Lord hallelujah amen so I want to empower you this morning so she is able to come into the presence of the king and the first sign of deceptor being raised and the King asking us something she says I want you to come to my banquet and bring amen with you she's able to step into that position of authority because who can summon the King who has the power to summon the King but you let's go to Matthew 18 18. amen Matthew 18 18 speaks about the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and how he empowers him his Queen he says very very same to you whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven amen amen yes amen yes your words are not light your words carry power two dimensions that you are thinking this demon is operating on the Earth but when you bind that Spirit on the earth it is bound in heaven amen amen and whatsoever you loose on the Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I shout you he's coming to you the second time to tell you and Empower you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they ask amen it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven and here it is you have the power to summon the presence of the king he says for where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them Hallelujah Esther can call on the king to come into this place welcome welcome amen welcome Holy Spirit we are in your presence yes amen what is the famous Jeremiah scripture that's easy for everyone to remember that triple three is not the triple six now the Triple Three Jeremiah 33 verse 3. call unto me and I will answer thee amen and show the Great and Mighty things which thou knows not amen so the Lord will come to you if you call on his name he just promised her to ask the kingdom but she's only making one request come to my banquet seems like an easy request for the king to respond to Acts 2 21 you know Acts chapter 2 is this powerful chapter because this is the birth of the church where we're talking about empowerment that's why I'm bringing this in this is what the scripture where empowered church but the baptism of the Holy Ghost where they are now in that upper room and they are the rushing Mighty Wind comes into the upper room and it filled them one and all and they are now stumbling around amen oh and they come into the streets they can hardly contain themselves and Peter stands up yes this is now Acts 2 and 21 and he tells them he shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved amen amen you got to be able to call on the name of the Lord in every situation amen amen yes they're five and five now we need to go back there then the king said now what did Jesus tell us anything you asked in my name I will ask the father I will bring you to pass I will make it happen yes to five and five as soon as Esther makes this request the king gives it out as a decree cause Eamon to make haste that he made two at yesterday had said yeah immediately or we could go to Daniel right now because Daniel when he understood the time when the season had come he began to pray and when the angel finally got to him what did he tell him he said as soon as I heard that prayer I just batched Heaven's Angels oh somebody get it this morning as soon as I heard thy prayer an angel was dispatched but he said I was met with resistance amen he says for 21 days but heaven will respond to your call immediately I tell you this morning if you've never called on the name of the Lord call on the name of the Lord and he shall meet you at the point of your name amen Hallelujah he says immediately get Eamon to come to the streets amen and do an essay that's it oh look at the screen now or words now carry power it's moving the king it's moving this demon power amen that's working in amen so the king and amen came to the banquet that Esther had prepared now they come to this place that's called the banquet of wine in verse 6 now and the King said unto Esther at the banquet of wine Hallelujah amen so if you already got it Esther can only be in a banquet of wine amen hallelujah we love to be spiritually drunk yes amen we like to be Intoxicated by his holy spirit amen the intoxication of the holy spirit gives us a stimulation of Revelation amen amen Hallelujah and the King said to Esther at the banquet of wine what is that the second time now what is that petition and it shall be granted thee what is thy request even to ask the kingdom it shall be performed he knew she never got to the heart of the matter under the line anointing what is she doing now she's under the ox anointing she's laboring yes amen now the backwood of wine we can take this now with that third right of that house right and that third anointing hurt not the oil and the wine what is the banquet of wine wine touched the stimulation of Revelation we know oil is the type of the Holy Spirit but wine is a stimulation of Revelation amen watch what she's going to do she's going to uncover his right she's going to uncover the scheme of Amen under what was the right horse riders scheme and plan exposed but if not under amen the opening of the word the opening of that seventh seal amen amen that gave the bride a stimulation of Revelation that sets her apart from every denomination yes hallelujah amen amen the Revelation that exposes Satan's Riot and scheme and his deception our seven sealed only declare this morning he is our banquet of wine oh thank you Lord now what was the banquet of wine the banquet of wine was a banquet that was carried out after the main meal because at the main meal meat and all our other Delicacies were being served but they never served wine in this portion of the Persian Kingdom they served the water because they didn't want to get drunk too early on amen the wine had to be stored up for a specific time amen the full revelation here I hope you're getting it the seals were not revealed in the days of poor amen Paul said we see through a glass Darkly Hallelujah but he said as light is needed it will be given I'm talking about the prophet now that's what he said so the banquet of why was the continuation of the banquet that was first set out now they're called to this banquet of lions where now it's like think of it as dessert you're getting your wine and you're getting your fruits and you're getting all of these other luxuries now it's after the meal she's calling them to the banquet of wine so here he comes under the banquet of wine amen which we said now she's laboring here and as the wine is being poured out and they are having a Pentecostal feast she exposes amen the writer is being exposed under this anointing he asked Esther the same question well let's go to verse 7 now and see Esther's response then Esther answered and said so he asked her what is your petition what is your request she says my petition and my request is if I found favor in the sight of the king and if it please the king watch now she's walking I told you she's laboring so it's it's still a banquet of wine She carries it out to the next day because there's another anointing coming amen he can't she gets the king and amen to come to the banquet of wine but listen to her request if you please the king to Grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and Eamon come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them I will do tomorrow as the king said because there is another right going forth amen there's another anointing going forward need she's still operating under the ox anointing the church as a whole I'm talking about so she's inviting him to come back now this King if this was your wife and you asking her what do you want first she tells you come to the banquet well first she doesn't tell you immediately like you know any of a few of you asked your wife what do you want to eat then you never get a straight answer right so the trick thing is to say if I were to take you out where would you like to go and then you take the way she told you right so watch there's a further work to go see it doesn't tell immediately in the throne room in the throne room she doesn't reveal what she wants she says come to my feast banquet of wines under the banquet of wines she doesn't tell him what she wants okay you see even then they couldn't understand women [Music] so she sells it come back tomorrow now many of us would have said but I'm here now tell me now but there's things to be uncovered in the next chapter because this is chapter five they next come together in chapter seven so there's certain things that happen right [Music] so she says if I find favor in the sight of the king and if you please the king to Grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and amen come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them and I will do tomorrow as the king had said so she wants to get them to that stage of smart cunning shrewd where she can expose right so if we if we had to look just as a glance fee we're not really preaching on this but maybe it'll spark some interest in you to read this in the Book of Esther between chapter 5 and verse 6. there's something that happens sorry between chapter five and verse 7 what happens let's put it up you can see here what happens the son of man is being revealed in time a son of man is revealing this son of man what is a son of man the glory of the Lord fully revealed through a prophet or somebody help me here what is a son of man God in a prophet come on we call ourselves son of man revealed Ministries we should be able to know what that means amen he said I am a son of man revealing these son of man amen amen again I'm going to make a statement you would never have heard this anywhere else if the spirit of the Lord does not pick it up amen because here on the inside of man Mordecai is being honored so amen remember amen so the king if you read it now I wonder what she said ice cream I wonder what I did he's probably wondering what he did because every time I ask her something she didn't want to talk to me she said come tomorrow come tomorrow he can't sleep so he asked for the book of records and here he finds that there were two two chamberlains that wanted to kill the king but under the ministry of Mordechai he exposed their workings he exposed those two spirits amen he exposed Oral Roberts and Billy Graham amen and he asked what honor has been given for Mordecai now watch out our footly frame the singing is there because Mordecai had operated in two pools of his ministry and under the he needs to come into his third poor ministry right if you understand where I'm going with brother Brandon's Ministry so now as he's doing this somebody comes into the court of the king amen now we know Eamonn is the bad guy he comes into the outer Court he can't come into the inner Court the Bible says he's in the ultimate Court of the King's house this is verse 4 now to speak unto the king and what he wants to do he wants to kill the influence of William Branham hmm 300 denominational ministers want to meet him yes and what is he telling the king I want you to hang Mordecai in The Gallows that he had prepared for him England already prepared The Gallows amen you see the king won't honor everyone's request he never asked amen okay what did he ask him he said who is in the court amen comes there and asks without permission he says he wants to speak to the king to hang Mordecai and the King said unto him and be all aim and stand it in the court and he said let him come right the king asked him this he said what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighted to honor now Eamon thought in his heart to whom the king Delight to honor more than myself and Eamon said to the King For Whom the king delighted to honor let their way of getting son of man Ministry now he's going to take the king's garments and he's saying let the Royal apparel be brought which the King used it to where amen amen amen if that's not the glory of the Lord and the horse power horse speaks of power which other Ministry you know operated or this level of anointing and power and authority I thought somebody will rejoice more than that this morning amen amen and the horse which the king righted upon and the Crown Royal which he set upon his head oh Hallelujah he wants the king's clothing the king's heart and the king's crown to be placed on the head if that's not son of man Ministry I don't know what it is and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of the one the king's most notable princes that they may array the man with all the king delighted to honor and bring him on Horseback to meet the street to meet through the street of the city and Proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted to honor wasn't he taken seven times around the world Amen that the glory of the Lord could be seen in this ministry that he confounded Kings potentates and wise men and church leaders and and Buddhists and and all of these uh G what these people jeans and sheets and everyone amen that even God was it God Lindsay that said when I met this man I met Jesus that even to today when some people cannot separate a son of man from the son of man that they worship Branham Christ if that is not the type here then what is [Music] what is he saying dress him in your garment put your crown on him let him ride on your horse and parade him through the streets I mean then the king says to him and make haste take their Peril the horse as thou has said and do to Mordechai the Jew and as you are standing there on Mountain wandering Lord what is this thing amen a king's sword fell into his hand and he looked at him he said it's shining glistening in the Sun and he said I've always been fearful of these swords and knives but here it was and he said the end will fit me perfectly aren't you glad the word is a perfect fit for us he says it fit me perfectly the king's sword fell into my hand and he said not a king sword The Voice told him it's the king's sword and Mordecai amen so now amen you can hardly believe himself can you believe it this man thought he was going to be getting all of these things and now they lay it upon Mordecai and Mordecai came again to the king's gate but Haman ran to his house morning didn't they go with Hill between the legs or does the brain and finish them that they and he said good morning friends understand do you have certain issues against my teaching on what a baptism God had serpent seed if any of you can show me in the Bible where I'm wrong bring your Bible and come stand next to you he says you could have heard a pin drop amen he says if you can't come stand he says then get off my back amen amen so amen running back to his house where he's going by his wife running with his head covered even now he believes in head covering 2016 and Eamon told zerish's wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him then now if you read these people this way is counselors right they told him if you read the previous chapter to get that Gallow and hang Mordecai he followed the instruction now he runs back to his advisors and the told his wise men and and zerish if Mordecai be the seed of the Jews before whom that was begun to fall thou shall not Prevail against him hmm but thou shall surely fall before him and while they were yet before he can even go into hiding while they were talking to him and telling him be careful you're going to be next the king's chamberlains come judgment is here and he's to bring amen unto the banquet that he has to have prepared oh you know he's in trouble now you know he's in trouble now bring him to Esther's feast that's where we get to chapter seven now second day of the feast so the king and Eamon came to the banquet with s to the queen and the King said again to Esther on the second day of the banquet of wine Revelation is still falling out now it's falling fresh because Luther just received the just shall live by faith and he began to protest the Catholic system and he nailed his 95. what they call it this is on the door of the Catholic Church and he's exposing them for who they are and yeah Wesley is riding with sanctification amen under the second day the banquet of wine and he says what is thy petition between Esther and it shall be granted to thee what is thy request and the third time he says and it shall be formed be performed even to half the kingdom then Queen then there is to the queen answered and said if I have found favor in thy side O King and if he please the king let my life be given at my petition here she is now willing to lay her life down so remember she says you ask me petition and request so for my petition you can lay my I Lay My Life down and my people at my request for we are sold I am my people to be destroyed and to be slain is she approaching the Legacy in church age where she recognizes the condition of her people sold out they're about to be perished about to be destroyed to be slain and to perish for we have been sown for bornmen and born women didn't they sell them out at the Pentecostal feast they saw the church I held I had held my tongue although the enemy could not come to build the king's damage so yes she is that present stage of our ministry now and she's now telling the condition of the people and the king is answered and said unto yes to the queen who is he and where is he that does presume in his heart to do so here she exposes him now and Esther said remember he's sitting right there thank you you have a set in a place where someone wreted you out and you're looking at that person and you think yeah how you could do this to me instances the adversary and enemy is wicked amen then Eamon was afraid before king and the Queen Watch What Happens now the king leaves the banquet of wine and the King arising from the bank with the wine in his rep went into the palace Garden and Eamon stood now he's just aiming and Esther you got it the final showdown will be Eve again with Satan where she's got to confront him alone and stand the ground but this guy he gets caught in a bad situation here let's read King leaves the place and he leaves Esther alone with this guy because remember it was Eve alone with the serpent Amos stood up to make requests for the life for his life to Queen yes to the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king he knew the King was going to kill him now then the king returned out of the palace Garden into the place into the place of the banquet of wine and amen see where he went now in talking to the queen he ended up on a bid yeah he must have been pleading but it's a better position to be found when the husband walks in Mr was then the king said will he Force the queen also before me in the house as the word of the Kings as the word went out of the king's mouth they covered eamon's face the king I only began to speak then and they covered his face and have not one of the Chamberlain said before the king behold also The Gallows 50 cubits High which Eamonn had made for Mordecai which had who had spoken good for the king standing in the house of Hamlin then the king said hang him thereon so they hang Damon on The Gallows and there that he had prepared for mordecaya then was the king's wrath pacified if you would have noticed that we had transitioned just with a few lines in the story it had moved from Esther revealing the condition of the church to a time of Investigation judgment thank you judgment upon amen when is Judgment under Revelations him so you see how quickly we moved in that story amen amen judgment was said and Haman is killed now you'll find in chapter eight on that day King asuras gave gave the house of Amen the Jews enemy unto Queen and to Esther the queen and Mordecai came before the king for Esther told what he was to her the king took off his ring which was from amen and gave it to Mordecai and Esther said Mordecai over the house of Amon so you'll see he gets all Abel's blessings right we find here now next you see Esther going into an intercessory role again he has to speak yet again before the king fell down on his feet he sought him with tears to put away the Mischief of Amen okay this is the point I needed to get to even though Eamon was dead the law and the decree and aim and certain motion was already going to come to pass so she has to make further petition to stop the laws that had been written Wednesday we explain to you that while Daniel had freedom of religion they set laws into motion too lined up his worship and stop him from praying so he says then the king held out the golden scepter unto Esther and Esther Rose and stood before the king and said if he please the king if I found favor in his sight and the things him right before the king if I be pleasing in his eyes Let It Be written to reverse the letters devised by aiming the son of emadata the agatite which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces for all Can I Endure to see the evil that shall come upon unto my people or How Can I Endure to see the destruction of my kindred then the king Acer is sent out to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew behold I have given Esther the house of amen and him that hangeth upon the Gallows because he laid his hand upon the Jews ready also for the Jews as if like a Jew and he says use my name ask anything in my name he says speak in the king's name seal it with the king's ring for the right thing which is written in the king's name and is sealed with the king's Ring May no man reverse he puts the power back to the church who is Mordecai and is to the church and he says take my ring he carries the cichlid write what you will ask anything stamp it with the seal of approval then the king's cribs were called the third man now they call the scribes and they make them sit before Mordecai and Esther and they write all the laws that they want I'm not going to go into that you can read it amen what I want to get to is the next one because remember we said he asked her four times he asked her three times already but he asked so one more time there was so much more we were going to get to amen but our time is already gone amen we find here under the in the ninth chapter now that the Jews go about destroying all of them that are brought her to kill them so it was the 12th month you see there the 13th day the king's commandment there is decree Drew near to be put into execution in the days the enemies of the Jews hope to have power over them that it was turned to the contrary that the Jews had ruled over them that hated them so the Jews gathered themselves from all the cities and all the provinces amen and they killed him and all the rulers of the provinces lieutenants deputies officers of the Kings amen and the fear of Mordecai fell upon them so verse 5 does the Jews moved all the enemies for The Stroke Of The Sword and the slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those who hated them and in verse 6 you see they destroyed 500 men right they killed 500 men and they killed amen's ten Sons so in verse 12 the king says to Esther the Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men intrusion in the palace and the ten fans of Amen which have sought would what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is that petition he granted me what is that request further and it shall be done notice it doesn't say to ask my kingdom because after the time of Investigation judgment she's already overcome and she is already she's already ruling do you get the point pay attention the fourth time he doesn't ask her even to ask the kingdom Because by the ninth chapter she recognized a position in the Kingdom she's already ruling to ask the kingdom she had already written laws and stamped it in his name amen amen she has already been exercising her rights for 2 000 years as Queen of Queens [Music] amen so he doesn't need to tell her even to ask the kingdom he positioned and empowered her to such a point that she is operating at that level amen give God praise amen hallelujah foreign [Music] she's flying above the things of the world she is fighting and overcoming amen amen amen she's living under that eagle anointing um now watch judgment is coming now from Esther this is the first time remember she exposed his works eamon's words right and judgment came from the King Hanging On The Gallows second time now the fourth time now he's asking she finally steps into that Authority because if she's not ruling and reigning like we just said in the mustn't she execute judgment as well who shall judge the Earth follow now we're not out of scripture here we're writing language scripture amen so it says here then as in verse 13 now verse 13 He just struck me now revelation 13. bringing judgment upon that b system if it please the king let it be granted to the Jews which I ensure to do tomorrow according unto this day's decree and let amen's ten Sons behind upon the Gallows this is such a harsh punishment for the Jews that we ensure and gather themselves together on the 14th day also of the month Adan slew 300 men at shushan but on the prey they did not lay their hand but the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and at rest from the enemy that slew of their full 70 and 5 000. so it wasn't only 500. you see the further work of this church they are now slaying 75 000. there's not only 500 demons there's 200 million demons let loose you need to slay all of them amen before they can come a day if you've seen verse 17 there's a day of feasting and of gladness before you come to that day there must be investigating judgment there must be judgment past amen hallelujah amen I need to stop right there and get into some of the scriptures amen that the true king of kings he's speaking to his Queen give me five minutes and we'll move amen let's go to John 15 and verse 5. amen and see if these are not the words that now the true king of King is now speaking to his true Queen John 15 and verse 5 he's saying I am Divine you are the branches he that abided in me I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing very quickly in order for you to get fruit the life that is in that vine must flow through your branches okay he said if a man abide not in me is cast forth as a branch and he's with it and Men gather them and cast them into the fire here's the verse I want to get to the seventh verse of the chapter if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you same thing as restored Queen Esther but this is the true king of kings telling his Queen if you asked anything it shall be done unto you John 14 12. amen let's go quickly now verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father and in verse 13 He says whatsoever you're asking my name remember what we were telling you the king told us to take my ring speak in my name amen whatsoever you asked in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it I hope and now you are you are ignited in your heart your passion in your heart to ask something before you leave this place [Music] amen John 15 and verse 16. before I get to the scripture was Esther chosen did she chose the king or the queen king chose her the king chose her let's read them with understanding you have not chosen me I have chosen you and ordained you did he finally position her to have the kingdom that you should bring go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask Dr father in my name he may give it you John 16 and verse 22 I know you're writing it down you'll read it at home amen and and just maybe you can print it out because these things are faith building scriptures 1622 he says you now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again oh I want to see him amen he said he will see us again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man take it from you and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever you ask the father in my name he will give it to you is it true you of us nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full in Psalm 37 and verse 4 it tells you to delight yourself in the Lord and he shall give you the desires of thine heart amen also note that being a son doesn't automatically make you inherit all things because you can be a son but you still have the same rights as a servant I'm in Galatians chapter 4 verse right now Galatians 4. but what is needed is for you to be under tutors and governors Amen to be under the five-fold ministry until because they are given for the perfecting of the Saints amen right until we come into the unity of the faith he says because what will this teach us why must you go on the tutors and darkness now imagine you're born in the king's household and you can't remember nothing you have no power to speak nothing he puts you under tutors and governors he wants you to have humility he wants you to have respect he wants you to honor those that are in authority amen in order to be adopted of the Father the tutors and governors what must they do give back a report to the father a good report if you're training in maturity and when the report is accepted the father adopts you and you become an heir of all the father has all right you'll read that in Galatians chapter 4 from verse 1 to 7. so he's telling you a child defers nothing from his servants going out to tutors governors maybe I'll read one verse it says let's read verse 6 because you are Sons God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more his servant but his son and if his son then an ear of God through Christ right amen let's go we've got how many more scriptures just a few more 1 John 3 21 this is now the Apostle of love John it says beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards God verse 2 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do these those things that are pleasing in his sight one John 5 verse 14. he says this is the confidence we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he Hearth us and if we know that he can that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we have decided that we have desired of him Matthew 17 20. I'm just laying in these Faith scriptures amen verily I say unto you if you have faith the great of a mustard seed you shall say to this mountain remove hands beyond the place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you Matthew 21 21 verily I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea it shall be done maybe you're asking how can I get this power how can I get this access you've got to go to acts 1 and 8 where he says you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnessed unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria even to the uttermost parts of the Earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and Luke 24 49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but Terry you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high amen so our King of Kings has come to empower the queen of queens and he's asked you what is your petition what is your request even to off the kingdom amen and with that I want you to stand up on your feet and hold your petition your request before the Lord let's stand amen blessed be the name of the Lord look at what Satan did to his bride scripture miserable wretched naked blind don't even know it but the Lord's Queen he said she's clothing diamonds pure and white Royal garments spotless that's revelation 19. amen Royal garments of the word
