[4:11] rejoicing in the Lord amen amen
[4:13] hallelujah only if you're glad to be
[4:15] walking and living in this time in this
[4:18] season amen hallelujah I you know the
[4:22] prophet they said I think he asked
[4:24] Bosworth which was the best time of his
[4:26] life yes and he said right now amen amen
[4:29] and we believe this is the best time of
[4:31] our life amen amen in all the years that
[4:34] we've been walking with the Lord this is
[4:36] the best time of our lives
[4:38] amen why because we and the groom have
[4:41] become one yes amen hallelujah when
[4:44] Jesus said when you have seen me you
[4:46] have seen the Father the bride stands
[4:48] here on the Earth right now when you
[4:50] have seen me you have seen Jesus if we
[4:53] can't say that something's wrong with us
[4:54] we need to get to that amen that's what
[4:57] the message was all about to bring us
[4:58] into his image and his likeness amen do
[5:01] you know
[5:02] there's many accounts of this and you'll
[5:04] find that some have gone into the
[5:06] extreme of it that when they looked at
[5:08] the life and the ministry of William
[5:09] Branham they were baffled and they
[5:13] mistook him for Jesus
[5:18] now anyone who's preaching a message if
[5:21] people are following that message they
[5:23] must come into that image of that
[5:25] message yes
[5:26] yes right you know the brand I mean
[5:29] spiritual food in juices and he's
[5:31] telling you the message on the messenger
[5:32] I won yes right amen the food you eat
[5:35] you become that food yes if you eat junk
[5:37] you get health problems amen if you eat
[5:39] good food like the Bible said we should
[5:41] amen our bodies will be healthy amen so
[5:45] what am I trying to say
[5:47] If the message had an effect on William
[5:49] Branham that way
[5:51] amen that they mistaken for Jesus yes
[5:54] the same message or to have an effect on
[5:57] our lives amen amen that we must be
[6:00] Jesus reproduced on the Earth

[6:04] Faith now we are living in a world of

[13:09] from the day but amen the Lord can
[13:12] strengthen Us in his presence amen let's
[13:15] just turn to the word of God
[13:20] Exodus chapter 6
[13:26] to start from verse 28.
[13:32] [Music]
[13:37] and it came to pass on the day when the
[13:39] Lord spake unto Moses in the land of
[13:41] Egypt that the Lord spake unto Moses
[13:44] saying I am the Lord
[13:46] speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt
[13:49] all that I say unto thee and Moses said
[13:52] before the Lord behold I am a
[13:55] uncircumcised lips and how shall fear or
[13:58] harken unto me
[14:00] and the Lord said unto Moses see I have
[14:03] made thee a God to Pharaoh amen and here
[14:06] and thy brother shall be thy prophet
[14:09] amen you
[14:10] 've got a blessings to the reading of
[14:12] the word amen so I don't have to prepare
[14:16] a foundation today because the
[14:17] foundation has been laid all these weeks
[14:19] amen we know we are constantly talking
[14:21] about what's happening in the season
[14:23] amen so none of us are in the dark of
[14:25] what's Happening amen what the Lord is
[14:27] doing this year amen because we've been
[14:29] experiencing it in our own lives yes
[14:31] amen so it's not just God working with
[14:33] one person but amen God working with
[14:35] each individual amen it might be in
[14:38] different spheres of your life amen some
[14:40] may be in a spiritual sense some may be
[14:42] in their natural life amen but God is
[14:45] concerned with all the things amen
[14:47] sometimes we tend to only want to apply
[14:50] the things of God to the kingdom of God
[14:52] Amen but Jesus said the kingdom of God
[14:54] is within you yes so amen even your
[14:56] natural life is part of the kingdom of
[14:58] God Amen so amen we can see God working
[15:01] and be thankful for that amen and we
[15:03] pray that you'll strengthen us tonight
[15:04] yes amen so I only got notice of
[15:08] preaching today at around midday five
[15:10] o'clock
[15:11] hey man so I didn't have much time to
[15:13] prepare a sermon but amen but thank God
[15:16] the days of sermons are over amen the
[15:18] Holy Spirit can still give us
[15:19] inspiration amen so we pray that he will
[15:22] drop down this evening and speak to us
[15:24] yes so we know we've been here in the
[15:26] last few weeks that amen we are Gods on
[15:30] the earth amen Adam was made to be a God
[15:32] on the earth amen we know that great God
[15:35] Almighty he was the god of the heavens
[15:37] and he made his son Adam to be a god of
[15:39] the earth amen
[15:41] so for a title tonight I just want to
[15:43] talk on the manifestation of the god man
[15:46] in each exodus yes yes amen and because
[15:49] I'm a lawyer I'm gonna add a legal
[15:51] subject and we're gonna say it's the
[15:54] ravindikachu action now some of you
[15:57] might not understand what that is but
[15:59] I'm going to explain that to you I'm
[16:01] going to give you a low 101 today amen
[16:03] hallelujah amen hallelujah so
[16:06] God says to Moses amen Moses is going
[16:10] now to face pharaoh and now remember
[16:12] that at that time Egypt is this great
[16:14] superpower amen they were the Great
[16:17] superpower of the world and actually in
[16:20] those days the Pharaoh was looked at as
[16:23] a god
[16:24] amen and the Pharaohs in those days
[16:26] weren't just like just ordinary Kings
[16:28] they were looked at as God beings very
[16:33] mythical and very Spiritual Beings and
[16:35] they worshiped their Pharaoh amen yes it
[16:37] wasn't like the kings that we have today
[16:40] so here we have a superpower amen that's
[16:43] controlling the world and we have a man
[16:45] that supposedly a God but God says unto
[16:49] Moses now Moses being the real God man
[16:52] God says unto Moses I made you a god
[16:55] unto Pharaoh amen what the world has
[16:58] said is they God
[17:00] amen what Satan has said is he's man in
[17:02] that hour as a God God is not saying I
[17:05] have made you
[17:08] Amen in this great age amen and Moses
[17:12] now looking at Moses we know the life of
[17:15] Moses Moses grew up under this household
[17:18] yes under the household of pharaoh he
[17:21] was trained under the house of pharaoh
[17:23] but little did Pharaoh know that in his
[17:25] own household was a God man being raised
[17:28] up
[17:29] amen amen amen to defeat the works of
[17:32] Satan yes amen now if we look at verse
[17:37] chapter 6 verse 30 we'll see that Moses
[17:40] has sort of this inferiority complex
[17:43] and Moses says he says the Lord behold
[17:47] I'm of uncircumcised lips yes and how
[17:50] shall I how shall Pharaoh can unto me so
[17:53] even Moses started to look at his own
[17:54] thoughts now amen so Moses started to
[17:57] see that he was not good enough amen he
[18:00] said everything no but you know I did
[18:01] this in my past yeah amen how is God
[18:04] going to use me when I did this in my
[18:06] past it can't be that God can use me
[18:08] when I did such a thing yes amen you
[18:11] know some of us are excellent swimmers
[18:13] because God says he threw our sins in a
[18:15] sea of forgetfulness but some of us want
[18:17] to swim right down amen excellent
[18:20] swimmers but amen you remember the story
[18:22] about the prophet uh the prophet saying
[18:24] that there was one time this daughter
[18:25] told her dad to stay up in the attic
[18:27] because he makes too much of noise amen
[18:29] and he found in the geography book that
[18:31] he could not find the bottom of the
[18:33] ocean amen so I want to tell you tonight
[18:35] that no matter how good of a swimmer you
[18:37] are you're not going to reach the bottom
[18:39] amen
[18:40] swim down that ocean you're not going to
[18:42] see any of my sins
[18:47] this complex that he had and so in the
[18:50] next verse God says unto Moses and the
[18:53] Lord said unto Moses see I have made
[18:55] thee a God to Pharaoh amen don't talk to
[18:58] me about you being of uncircumcised lips
[19:00] don't talk to me about your past
[19:02] thank you
[19:06] amen God designed it this way did he not
[19:09] design Adam to be that way amen did he
[19:12] not put Adam in that condition to rule
[19:15] over the Earth yeah amen it was God's
[19:17] purpose and when God made man he said it
[19:19] was good amen amen because God had a
[19:22] purpose in his heart amen hallelujah so
[19:25] Moses amen had to get over this
[19:27] inferiority complex yeah amen and I want
[19:29] to encourage you to not stop looking at
[19:31] ourselves amen look at ourselves the way
[19:34] God looks right now Moses tried to look
[19:36] at himself the way he saw himself amen
[19:39] but God said now look at the way I see
[19:41] it amen I see you as a god
[19:44] amen amen and then Moses now when Moses
[19:48] starts to realize who he is we know what
[19:51] happens the name and he goes down to
[19:52] Egypt and he absolutely torments Pharaoh
[19:55] amen he torments Egypt amen he torments
[19:58] The Works of pharaoh amen the ten
[20:00] plagues amen and we know we can see
[20:02] Moses coming into this god statue where
[20:04] he starts to speak flies into existence
[20:06] amen he starts to speak frogs into
[20:08] existence amen so much so the Pharaoh
[20:11] began to get sick of him amen and
[20:13] sometimes the devil needs to become so
[20:15] sick of us amen amen if the devil is not
[20:17] sick of us there's a problem amen it
[20:20] means he's fine because we are not
[20:21] attacking him amen but Moses amen the
[20:24] prophets that he went on as a one-man
[20:26] Invasion amen and he began to attack
[20:28] Egypt amen that great superpower of that
[20:31] day amen those demon powers that were
[20:33] held up amen at that time Moses began to
[20:37] torment them amen amen and why because
[20:39] Satan amen thought he had a man there
[20:42] that he backed up this man Pharaoh amen
[20:44] but Moses was backed up by God
[20:49] amen by the same power amen and Rose
[20:52] Jesus from the dead because he said it's
[20:54] the same power that Rose Jesus from the
[20:56] dead dwells in us it will Quicken this
[20:58] Mortal body amen amen like the prophet
[21:01] talked about the policeman amen he might
[21:03] be of a small statue standing there at
[21:05] the traffic sign amen and no matter how
[21:08] big that truck coming down the road is
[21:10] amen when they see the policeman put up
[21:12] his hand they have to stop amen amen
[21:15] because that policeman is backed by the
[21:17] law of the land amen and we are back to
[21:19] amen by the law of God and the power of
[21:22] God Amen by the supernatural we are
[21:24] backed by the angels of God Amen because
[21:27] he said I will give my angels charge
[21:29] over thee amen so we know that the angel
[21:31] of the Lord goes before us amen amen we
[21:34] are backed people amen so when we speak
[21:36] we should not be afraid amen we should
[21:39] speak with authority amen because we
[21:41] have the backing of the Holy Ghost
[21:43] amen thank you Hallelujah
[21:46] amen now Moses you know
[21:49] Moses began to do all of these great
[21:51] things
[21:52] and he began to exercise his faith I
[21:56] began to speak all of these things all
[21:58] of these things
[21:59] but even Moses came to a stage where
[22:03] when they were come to the Red Sea
[22:06] and he was perplexed now because all of
[22:08] the people was crying unto Moses Moses
[22:10] he brought us here to Die Why didn't
[22:12] Jesus not leave us in Egypt the amen so
[22:14] Moses began to get perplexed and he
[22:16] began to forget about the power of God
[22:18] Amen so Moses starts to cry out to God
[22:21] Amen to make a way because they were
[22:23] stuck at the Red Sea
[22:25] amen
[22:27] When God Says unto Moses why are you
[22:29] crying amen speak and go forward amen
[22:33] because Moses had already been
[22:34] commissioned God was not going to come
[22:37] down and commission him again amen he
[22:39] already commissioned him the first time
[22:41] amen so Moses had the backings to speak
[22:43] and go forward amen so that is where we

[22:49] to wait now for an audible voice of God
[22:51] to speak to us you've been hearing that
[22:53] these last few weeks amen we heard the
[22:56] the other week I mean how our Prophet
[22:58] amen came to a stage in his life where
[23:00] he began to lose the compassion for the
[23:02] people and he wanted to go up into the
[23:04] mountains and God told him that you are
[23:07] called for a much greater accordance
[23:09] amen God told him why are you waiting
[23:11] for me to tell you when to go or what to
[23:13] do amen he had already been commissioned
[23:16] to the angels not meet him in the cave
[23:18] and commissioning amen he said if you
[23:20] get the people to believe you nothing
[23:22] will stand in your way yes amen amen so
[23:25] Moses came to the same place am and let
[23:27] us not come to that place where we say
[23:29] no we are waiting amen where we say no

[23:51] trial is I'm pretty sure that trial is
[23:53] not greater than the Red Sea amen I'm
[23:56] pretty sure it's not greater than those
[23:58] Seas coming up as walls amen hallelujah

[25:09] Lord amen hallelujah
[25:13] um amen so Moses did not have to wait
[25:15] for a vision amen he didn't have to wait
[25:17] for an audible voice he just had to
[25:20] speak and go forward amen
[25:23] amen hallelujah we see that this was the
[25:26] first Exodus amen remember we speaking
[25:28] about the manifestation of the god man
[25:31] in each Exodus we know there were three
[25:34] Exodus amen but just looking at the
[25:36] first Exodus amen being the Genesis amen
[25:40] being the first Exodus we see that first
[25:43] Moses had to come up into the statue
[25:45] where he was a God man amen he is a God
[25:48] to pharaoh
[25:49] but not only that that same Ministry
[25:52] then produced people who would be Gods
[25:55] on the earth yeah that same Ministry
[25:57] produced a Joshua amen and Joshua was
[26:00] like a god who could say to the sun sun
[26:02] stand still amen hallelujah amen God had
[26:07] set the sun in motion amen when God
[26:09] created the Earth amen he wrote the laws
[26:11] in place of how this should stay this
[26:13] planet should stay here the sun should
[26:15] stay yeah the Earth should rotate amen
[26:17] how many days the Earth should rotate
[26:19] God wrote the laws of physics the laws
[26:22] of gravity and all of these laws but
[26:24] here comes a man now who rewrites those
[26:27] laws of physics he says amen now I know
[26:30] that almighty God created you I know
[26:33] that God sets you in place to move at a
[26:35] certain point amen I know that these
[26:38] laws are in place but the very same God
[26:40] that created you created me amen
[26:43] hallelujah and the same God created Adam
[26:45] to be a god of the earth amen I am a son
[26:48] of Adam

[26:56] you to stand still until I say so amen

[27:05] the laws of physics amen hallelujah amen
[27:08] can you imagine what audacity that is
[27:10] Amen to say you know what God created

[27:16] the Son of God is commanding the son to
[27:18] do something contrary to what God
[27:19] commands amen yet it is in the will of
[27:23] God Amen Hallelujah is that contrary to
[27:26] the will of God amen amen amen
[27:29] hallelujah thank you amen you know signs
[27:33] have been studying the laws of physics
[27:35] and the laws of science for thousands of
[27:36] years now amen but we had forefathers
[27:39] thousands of years ago they were stopped
[27:41] in the sun they were Defying Gravity
[27:43] yeah amen they would define the laws of
[27:45] physics amen you don't believe me if you
[27:47] look at Samson amen yeah the prophet
[27:49] said you know when the church will
[27:51] preach about Samson or when they draw a
[27:53] picture and they draw this big picture
[27:55] of a man with great big muscles but the
[27:57] prophet said he was a Little Mommy's boy
[27:59] amen with little locks on his ear like a
[28:01] little amen that's what the
[28:03] prophet said so how was Samson able
[28:07] to take the gates
[28:08] amen and carry the heavy gate with all
[28:12] of those Philistines on him on the gate
[28:15] how is he able to do that the laws of
[28:17] physique does not permit that yeah amen
[28:20] the law of the way of physics tells you
[28:22] that there's a certain weight that goes
[28:24] with a certain load and you can only
[28:26] handle a certain load amen but Samson
[28:28] begin to rewrite the laws of physics

[34:41] Adam was Amen in the beginning
[34:45] amen now you know when the the Pharisees
[34:48] always criticizing Jesus what was the
[34:51] real reason that they were really angry
[34:53] about uh Angry with him for

[34:58] is they said you being a man make
[35:01] yourself God amen amen that was the
[35:03] tracks of it yeah amen if he was just
[35:06] like for example he was just a preacher
[35:08] or something they would have not worried
[35:10] so much
[35:11] but he said you being a man make
[35:13] yourself God Amen and you would notice
[35:16] that whenever the ministry comes to a
[35:18] stage where people have to come to
[35:21] realization that they are God upon the
[35:24] Earth yes you will watch that that same
[35:26] spirit
[35:27] is there to attack him yes amen what was
[35:31] the main challenge last year and the
[35:33] previous the years just prior to this
[35:35] year prior to this year where the
[35:37] commission came forth and where we are
[35:39] learning now that we have to be Godzilla
[35:40] amen the biggest attack came on the
[35:43] Firefall Ministry because they started
[35:45] to say stay at home play the tapes you
[35:47] don't need the Firefall Ministry why
[35:49] because there was coming a time when the
[35:51] Firefall Ministry whose purpose is to
[35:53] edify the bride was to awaken the bread
[35:56] to their position and you are to be Gods
[35:58] upon the Earth amen amen Satan was not
[36:01] gonna be happy about that so he tried to
[36:03] silence the voice amen
[36:05] amen he tried to attack that amen but
[36:08] here we are today amen amen the work of
[36:11] God Amen man cannot be defeated amen
[36:13] amen
[36:14] Satan cannot stop the things of God how
[36:18] angry he wants to get amen even in the
[36:20] time of the first Exodus amen Pharaoh
[36:23] got so angry amen because Moses was like
[36:26] a God now to him amen he began to do all
[36:28] of these things so much so that Pharaoh
[36:31] began to you know curse Moses and say
[36:33] all of these things till he pronounced
[36:35] his own son's death amen when he started
[36:38] a curse Moses pronounced his own son his
[36:40] own son's death and he got so angry that
[36:43] he even chased Moses into the ocean bed
[36:46] with his Great Walls of water standing
[36:50] he was so mad at Moses that he even
[36:52] chased Moses right there yeah amen not
[36:54] realizing he is walking into his own
[36:56] grave amen the same in the time of Jesus
[36:59] they were still so angry that they began
[37:01] to crucify him amen they begin to reject
[37:04] him amen amen so the same today amen
[37:08] Satan gets angry amen when we want to
[37:10] come to our position when God wants to
[37:12] tell us that you need to come up higher
[37:13] when God wants to tell us that there's
[37:15] more for us amen than just receiving the
[37:18] word and being happy with that amen God
[37:21] wants to show us amen that the whole
[37:23] purpose of this amen the third foreign
[37:25] minister part of the threefold purpose
[37:28] amen was that God was restoring title
[37:31] deep God was restoring us back to
[37:33] academic condition amen amen but Satan
[37:36] gets angry when he hears these things
[37:37] and then he wants to attack the move of
[37:39] God Amen but we are not unaware of his
[37:42] schemes
[37:43] Hallelujah and God raises up a standard
[37:46] yeah it is why you notice how the word
[37:48] started to come in such a vigorous form
[37:50] Amen to attack that amen because God
[37:52] raises up a standard amen standard is
[37:55] the word of God amen hallelujah amen
[37:59] glory amen isn't he great amen isn't he
[38:03] worthy yeah Hallelujah
[38:06] hmm
[38:10] so yeah so they begin to get angry at
[38:12] Jesus because he
[38:14] they said you're making yourself God and
[38:16] what did Jesus say to them then
[38:18] he said if you don't believe me that I
[38:20] am he hey amen if you don't believe that
[38:22] I am the god man walking on the earth to
[38:25] leave the works because the works
[38:27] testify of who I am if you want to
[38:30] believe my confession I am a God man in
[38:32] this age amen believe the works that are
[38:34] following amen but now we can't say that
[38:37] if the works are not foreign
[38:40] for many years amen the messy church has
[38:43] had the profession amen but the works
[38:45] were not following but this year
[38:48] Hallelujah
[38:50] oh yeah
[38:55] these signs will follow he says
[39:00] amen hallelujah so now we can say to
[39:03] this age amen that if you do not believe
[39:05] that we are the ones Amen to bring forth

[42:47] walking upon the Earth demon he was able
[42:49] to say to the fish amen little fishy I
[42:52] give you back your life amen amen he is
[42:54] able to see the sister how do you write
[42:55] amen I give you the salvation of your
[42:58] two boys amen hallelujah and showing us
[43:02] an example in this day of what we need
[43:04] to come to
[43:06] now the prophet also you know many times
[43:09] operated by vision and
[43:11] what he would see the father doing amen
[43:13] and we know that when he spoke the
[43:16] squirrels into existence and he spoke to
[43:19] the fish God instructed him to do those
[43:21] things
[43:22] but that was only because God was
[43:25] teaching him how the third poor works
[43:28] yeah
[43:29] God was showing him how this works amen
[43:35] because
[43:37] for years the prophet said he did not
[43:39] understand Mark 11 23 yes
[43:42] yes amen and he doesn't want to preach
[43:45] on it because he didn't understand it
[43:47] amen
[43:49] and
[43:50] so we see God was teaching the prophet
[43:52] and how to operate in this and that is
[43:54] why God instructed him speak to the
[43:56] schools speak to the speak to the fish
[43:58] now that does not mean now that we have
[44:01] to wait each time for the audible voice
[44:03] of God to instruct us speak to this
[44:05] speak to them God was teaching him so
[44:07] that God so that he could show us yes
[44:09] how to operate that power amen amen amen
[44:13] amen so sometimes we can take the flips
[44:16] out of that and say okay no we have to
[44:17] wait for God to speak but he's already
[44:19] commissioned us yes yes Mark 11 3 if you
[44:22] say Amen so don't confuse the tuna and
[44:26] think that we have to wait now for an
[44:28] audible voice of God Amen he is already
[44:30] commissioned that amen
[44:32] now I'll give you an example of that and
[44:35] just to talk about this example I just
[44:37] want to go through this quote and maybe
[44:39] if we can put it up so
[44:40] it's quite a long quote
[44:43] but I want to go through it just in bits
[44:45] and pieces because I think the prophet
[44:47] teaches us a good lesson here on how to
[44:50] operate Amen in this Supernatural and in
[44:53] the level of Faith amen
[44:55] but I want and I want you to pay special
[44:57] attention to the fact that this is from
[45:01] the message faith is the substance yes
[45:03] which is the first recorded message
[45:07] so the prophet is laying a foundation
[45:09] remember the prophet was instructed to
[45:11] record the messages spiritual food in
[45:13] due season amen so in the very first
[45:16] message I want you to see what
[45:18] Foundation the prophet is laying and I
[45:20] wanted you to see that even though the
[45:22] prophet says for years he did not
[45:24] understand Mark 11 23 but I want you to
[45:27] understand that he was already operating
[45:28] it it might not have understood it but
[45:31] he has already operating in it
[45:34] amen so let's go maybe you can type out
[45:38] I have faith to believe anything
[45:46] amen amen you love the Lord amen amen
[46:04] paragraph 35.
[46:06] this is a little bit up higher
[46:12] okay
[46:24] let's start from the last
[46:26] um
[46:27] sentence there properties and I'll see
[46:30] if you've got faith so the prophet here
[46:31] is testing whether the sister has Faith
[46:33] now sister you do not you do not have
[46:35] faith so the sister the prophet went to
[46:37] pray for the sick sister
[46:39] and the prophet asked if she believes
[46:41] that she said yes she has faith
[46:43] to be healed and the prophet Discerning
[46:46] I said you do not have faith amen
[46:49] so she said oh Reverend Brennan I have
[46:52] faith to believe anything now doesn't
[46:54] that sound like us message people all
[46:56] over these years amen amen we have we
[46:58] have the word we believe anything we
[47:00] believe that the Lord can do anything
[47:01] and she says oh brother Brandon I have
[47:03] faith to believe anything
[47:05] and he says if you have faith and the
[47:08] prophet says the faith he said if you
[47:09] have faith I want to ask you and show
[47:11] you rather that you do not have faith
[47:15] now listen and catch every word of it
[47:17] amen now in the prophet we know when the
[47:19] prophet says listen amen he's going to
[47:21] teach us something amen and he says
[47:23] catch every word of it
[47:26] hanging in the room from there was this
[47:28] chandelier with a string and at the end
[47:30] of the string was a little bracelet name
[47:32] and you all know the story I mean it was
[47:34] a white bracelet and the little red sets
[47:36] a man let's go a little bit down you
[47:38] know what that is 36 and I've seen that
[47:41] little bracelet hanging down I said to
[47:43] the young lady how far are you away from
[47:45] the bracelet and she said approximately
[47:48] 15 feet
[47:49] I said now the prophet asked the adults
[47:52] to turn their backs
[47:53] because the next paragraph and that's
[47:55] the reason I'm getting into these things
[47:57] with you tonight we've got two more
[47:59] nights and something's got to be done
[48:01] amen the prophet realizes there's
[48:02] something missing everyone so he's
[48:03] teaching them a principle yeah he says
[48:05] see you see now I don't want you to go
[48:08] away and say anything wrong about this
[48:09] because you might have to answer the
[48:11] Judgment for it and so I said something
[48:14] has to be done immediately now your
[48:16] parents just turn your back and some of
[48:18] the neighbors who are sitting up here
[48:20] MLS just got a little bit more down
[48:27] just before paragraph 37 and she said
[48:29] about three days said I can't even keep
[48:30] water in my stomach and you know what
[48:33] attendeecee Associated appendix problem
[48:36] paragraph 37. and I said now if you
[48:39] believe with all your heart and you
[48:40] prove to me now that you've got faith
[48:42] look directly at that bracelet and hit
[48:45] hang in the inward air and you make the
[48:47] bracelet swing around in the room and
[48:49] then you make it swing back and forth in
[48:51] the room and stop it and I'll believe
[48:53] you have faith now let's just stop there
[48:56] hey man how the prophet takes something
[48:58] very literal he doesn't take something
[49:01] spiritual he takes something very
[49:03] literal and he says if you say you have
[49:04] faith I want you to move this bracelet
[49:07] without even touching it
[49:09] now that test would choke most of us
[49:11] message people yes amen that would
[49:15] definitely choke most of us message
[49:16] people and I pray that the Lord amen
[49:18] brings us up to that state state that
[49:21] the prophet was in that could exercise
[49:23] in such a fate like that amen amen but
[49:25] let's see what the prophet teaches us
[49:27] she said Oh Brother Branham said why ask
[49:30] me something like that I said I wanted
[49:32] this and the prophet said I said I want
[49:34] you to see if you have faith I said
[49:36] Jesus said all things are possible if
[49:38] you believe
[49:39] now that's the prophecy that's pure
[49:42] Faith amen and here the prophet says
[49:45] even magicians use it many times to play
[49:48] pranks and so forth burst glasses and
[49:50] things and you wonder how they are doing
[49:51] these things the prophet says they are
[49:53] applying the same law of Faith they are
[49:55] believing it's going to happen and it
[49:57] happens amen and this is from the
[49:59] prophet now
[50:02] amen I want you to sit still now so
[50:04] you'll catch this wake yourself up amen
[50:07] so when I get through with it you know
[50:09] what it's all about
[50:12] then she said why brother Graham no one
[50:14] could do that I said oh yes anyone can
[50:16] that believes and he said well I don't
[50:19] believe that anyone could do that so the
[50:21] prophet says but I thought you said you
[50:22] believed for all things
[50:24] see how she was caught right there and
[50:27] some of us can get caught right there
[50:28] amen when it comes to circumstances in
[50:31] our life everything you know this is
[50:32] just something literature that's going
[50:33] on in our life but amen apply your faith
[50:37] amen amen
[50:40] and she said I don't believe there's
[50:42] anyone that can do that that's much here
[50:44] now look at the word she says that's
[50:45] material brother Brandon
[50:47] like Jesus cursing the Fig Tree material
[50:50] I said yes ma'am she said well I can see
[50:54] it done and the prophet said if you
[50:56] desires the prophet said he could do it
[50:57] paragraph 14. now I want you to see how
[51:00] the prophet does this
[51:02] he says then of course putting my mind
[51:04] on it now I want you to imagine this is
[51:06] that bracelet and the prophet that he
[51:09] puts his mind he focuses on it
[51:12] and having her to watch that and not me
[51:14] yeah as many times
[51:17] in the meeting the prophet talks about
[51:19] how we would take a cross-eyed child
[51:22] and not just without even praying for
[51:25] the child he would just look at the
[51:27] child's eyes and focus his attention on
[51:29] the childhood and the child's eyes
[51:30] should come straight amen that's what
[51:33] the prophet says in paragraph 40
[51:35] paragraph 41 and I use that for an
[51:37] illustration
[51:39] amen
[51:42] let's just skip a few paragraphs
[51:44] paragraph 42 now then of course fasting
[51:46] my eyes to that bracelet which you can
[51:49] yourself if you don't doubt in your
[51:51] heart the property saying you can do it
[51:53] as well and it started to move around
[51:55] and it moved back and forth Crossways
[51:57] and stopped it she said that
[52:00] spiritualism
[52:01] now I can tell you for a fact that this
[52:04] will choke many many message people they
[52:06] would say that that is spiritualism they
[52:08] would say that is fanaticism but amen
[52:11] the prophet amen is giving us this in
[52:13] the very first message that's recorded
[52:15] that we have as a foundation amen amen
[52:18] and he says I thought you say something
[52:20] like that and it profited my isn't it
[52:22] strange how people that profess they
[52:24] know God yet know so little about him
[52:26] amen she said you know we belong to the
[52:30] Church of Christ
[52:32] and the Church of Christ
[52:34] believes amen we speak the Bible where
[52:37] the Bible speaks and we are silent where
[52:39] the Bible is silent
[52:41] and the prophet says you know that is
[52:42] their slogan and I have questioned that
[52:45] a few times amen so the prophet actually
[52:47] questioned the slogan where it says I
[52:49] say Style with the Bible say silent
[52:51] because we know that God can do anything
[52:53] God can actually do something that's not
[52:55] in the Bible because he is God Amen but
[52:58] he chooses to do things that are in his
[53:00] word so that we can have confidence in
[53:02] him he said in his word if it comes to
[53:04] pass we can have confidence in him amen
[53:07] so he said all right
[53:09] she said there's no such a thing can be
[53:11] shown in the Bible or anything like that
[53:13] so she's challenging the prophet and
[53:15] saying what you just did is not in the
[53:17] Bible
[53:17] right
[53:19] and the prophet said I thought you would
[53:21] say that and the prophet said sure it's
[53:22] in the Bible so if we go down to
[53:24] paragraph 43 he says when Jesus passed
[53:26] the tree the Fig Tree the prophet is
[53:28] bringing us back to the same example
[53:30] amen we don't have to read that whole
[53:32] thing but we know what happened Jesus
[53:34] cursed the Fig Tree amen and we know
[53:37] that it wizard away you know something
[53:38] literal something natural amen because
[53:40] Jesus believed that what he said would
[53:42] come to pass amen amen the prophet said
[53:47] now the prophet is I know you're
[53:49] unbelieving Pastor trying to justify his
[53:51] unbelief said that that was a mountain
[53:53] of sin amen because Mark 11 11 Trinity
[53:57] says if you speak to this mountain amen
[53:59] now many people many times when we
[54:00] preach as well we say you know your
[54:01] spiritual Mountain but Jesus was even
[54:04] being literal yeah that if you speak to
[54:06] a literal Mountain absolutely because
[54:08] there's no what Adam did amen Adam could
[54:10] say to the street being knocked and go
[54:12] and plant Yourself by the river and
[54:14] you're gonna be him yeah so Jesus was
[54:16] being quite literal amen Hallelujah and
[54:18] he says if you had Faith the size of a
[54:21] mustard seed and the prophet did not
[54:23] Faith the size of a massive seed would
[54:25] move that mountain how much smaller
[54:27] Faith would you need just to move that
[54:28] bracelet amen there ought to challenge
[54:31] us now amen if something can move a
[54:34] mountain like how we said before is your
[54:36] child greater than the Red Sea be
[54:38] imparted how much lesser Faith do we
[54:41] need Amen to overcome our trials amen
[54:45] the prophet did I've often wondered why
[54:48] it was a mustard seed and he said a
[54:50] master city is the smallest among all
[54:52] seeds that's right but there isn't
[54:54] nothing will mix with a mustard seed a
[54:58] man is all mustard amen you can't mix
[55:00] anything with it kale or nothing and
[55:02] make it grow it's all mustard
[55:05] and if you've got that much Faith all
[55:07] fate not mixed up with something else
[55:09] amen amen not mixed up with any wavering
[55:13] amen it's got to be a genuine mustard
[55:15] amen you've got to be genuine perfect
[55:17] Faith amen amen amen hallelujah
[55:21] now let's go to this next paragraph
[55:25] she says why she said look here I want
[55:28] to ask you something she said did God
[55:30] move that or did the devil move that I
[55:32] yes where everyone's gonna choke amen
[55:35] did God move that or did the devil movie
[55:37] and the prophet said neither God nor the
[55:40] devil moved it he said I moved it by my
[55:42] faith amen amen God didn't do it the
[55:46] devil didn't do it I did it by my faith
[55:49] amen hallelujah so if the prophet could
[55:52] do it back then the seventh seals was
[55:55] not even open title not even yet been
[55:58] restored
[55:59] dilemma.com down the mighty Angel and
[56:02] not come down with the open book as yet
[56:03] and the prophet could do it back then
[56:06] what can we do now amen what can we do
[56:09] in a season where Mark 11 23 is open in
[56:13] a season amen yeah at that time maybe
[56:15] the prophet was opening it maybe in a
[56:17] small measure yeah but now in the season
[56:19] when Mark is opened up amen what can we
[56:23] do amen
[56:25] amen hallelujah would we speak things
[56:28] into existence amen hallelujah what can
[56:31] we do amen if we are the God people
[56:33] walking on the earth amen because we are
[56:36] a God man in this end time the prophet
[56:38] William Branham walking on the earth
[56:40] amen amen and his ministry has produced
[56:42] a God people amen that is now coming
[56:45] into realization of who they are yeah
[56:47] amen and not able not to speak amen and
[56:50] they're able to speak with such
[56:52] Authority that it comes to pass amen
[56:54] amen and when someone has to ask us
[56:56] who made that happen
[56:58] it wasn't God it wasn't the devil amen I
[57:01] made it happen amen look we hear the
[57:03] code amen the prophet of brother will
[57:05] come to you and say I have need of rain
[57:06] and he says I give you rain amen amen
[57:09] hallelujah amen amen so it's I give unto
[57:12] you amen such as I have I give unto you
[57:15] amen thank you hey man the prophet is
[57:18] preaching Us in the very first message
[57:20] amen the foundation message and he's
[57:22] laying this Foundation of Faith amen I
[57:25] know this is the
[57:27] the next paragraph 45 he says but you
[57:29] are a free model agent you being a human
[57:32] being you can resent it in your heart
[57:34] and you can resent it in your heart
[57:36] tonight what what's been preached amen
[57:38] you can resent it in your heart that
[57:40] what we are talking is absolute nonsense
[57:42] you can choose to do that you are free
[57:45] moral agent yes but amen when the
[57:47] evidence is there amen when the works
[57:50] are there differently and prove that
[57:52] this is true amen who unto you amen woe
[57:57] unto you if you resent it amen
[57:58] hallelujah amen you can't be sitting at
[58:01] a camp amen can't be sitting in the camp
[58:03] and notice amen the angel of the Lord
[58:05] moving and you just keep still amen
[58:07] hallelujah amen you can't be in a crowd
[58:10] that is hot and you being cold amen yes
[58:13] it has to make you hot amen hallelujah
[58:16] yes amen so if you are not moving yet
[58:18] soon you are going to start to move amen
[58:20] because as the fire starts to burn you
[58:22] up
[58:23] amen you're gonna start getting started
[58:26] to feel the fire amen
[58:32] thank you
[58:34] [Music]
[58:35] and I want you to notice we're almost
[58:36] done with this chord but the next
[58:38] paragraph
[58:40] the prophet says and then she said well
[58:43] do you mean to tell me then what part
[58:47] does God play with it so the prophet
[58:48] said I I made that happen so she says
[58:51] what part does God play in that and now
[58:53] I want you to see remember the prophet
[58:55] said yeah if you read a little bit of
[58:57] the Prophet said that Jesus said if you
[58:59] say so the prophet is actually referring
[59:00] to Mark 11 23.
[59:03] and then now when she says what part
[59:05] does God have in it
[59:07] the prophet goes on to answer by saying
[59:09] now look there was an angel came down to
[59:11] me amen amen he met me over there
[59:15] he gave me the commission and said
[59:17] you'll be sent with a gift of Divine
[59:19] Healing
[59:20] amen so the prophet is now when she
[59:23] answers this question he signed Mark 11
[59:26] 23 where the angel of the Lord amen and
[59:29] didn't we yeah just recently that the
[59:31] angel of the Lord came into partnership
[59:33] with the prophet and now he wants to
[59:35] come into partnership with the bride
[59:37] amen amen so yeah the prophet is time
[59:39] Mark 11 23 with the angel of the Lord he
[59:42] said the angel of the Lord met me back
[59:43] there amen and he said he commissioned
[59:46] me amen so the same Angel of the Lord
[59:49] has commissioned us amen have we not do
[59:51] we not believe that the angel of the
[59:52] Lord is at the pulpit yeah do we not
[59:54] believe that the angel of the Lord is
[59:56] commissioning us into the nation after
[59:57] what yeah amen so we got to believe that
[1:00:00] the angel of the Lord is working in
[1:00:01] partnership with us amen hallelujah and
[1:00:04] look at this he is preaching this in the
[1:00:06] first message Amen in the foundation
[1:00:08] message faith is the substance
[1:00:11] hallelujah amen
[1:00:17] and the prophet didn't even realize that
[1:00:19] he was operating in Mark 11 23 because
[1:00:21] many years later he said he never
[1:00:23] understood it
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] another quoting man from a different
[1:00:32] message the prophet says it's a personal
[1:00:35] individual affair with the person that
[1:00:37] Christ is revealed to them amen if you
[1:00:40] say he has been revealed to me and in
[1:00:42] the Life of Christ produced here in the
[1:00:44] Bible that same life in him does not
[1:00:47] reduce itself in you then you've got the
[1:00:49] wrong Revelation yes now amen let's say
[1:00:51] Amen to that amen let's say that we are
[1:00:53] not reducing that life we've got the
[1:00:55] wrong Revelation amen amen we might have
[1:00:57] had knowledge yes amen we might have had
[1:01:00] a theory about the message but we've had
[1:01:02] the wrong Revelation amen because it
[1:01:04] must produce the Life of Christ again
[1:01:06] amen amen hallelujah he says if if a
[1:01:10] life if I put the life of a pumpkin
[1:01:13] into the life of a pear tree it would
[1:01:15] bear pumpkins by the fruits you shall
[1:01:17] know them amen amen we know amen that
[1:01:21] the next one brought out apples there's
[1:01:24] some kind of a grafted Affair in there
[1:01:26] that's bad in its own life every
[1:01:28] denomination will be a life of itself
[1:01:30] but if the original vine ever puts we've
[1:01:33] heard this for years now but if the
[1:01:34] original vine ever puts another shoot it
[1:01:37] will get grapes like it did the first
[1:01:39] time and in the Life of Christ Jesus
[1:01:41] Christ ever puts another body of
[1:01:43] Believers is he put in Forth another
[1:01:45] body amen it will bear the fruit and the
[1:01:49] first one like the first one did they
[1:01:51] will write a book of Acts behind it amen
[1:01:53] amen because it'll be the same life yes
