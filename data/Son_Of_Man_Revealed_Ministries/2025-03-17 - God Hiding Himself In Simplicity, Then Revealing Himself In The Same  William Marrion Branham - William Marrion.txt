TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now I want to read also in the book of St Matthew's gospel the 11th chapter of St Matthew 26 and 27 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto be even so father for so it seems good in thy sight catch those two scriptures who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed stand Jesus thank God that he had hid the mysteries from the wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would learn for it seemed good to God to do do that now from this text or from this scripture reading I draw this text God hiding himself in Simplicity than revealing himself in the same it is strange to think how that God does such a thing as that God will hide himself and something so simple that will cause the wise to miss an a million miles and then turn right back around in that s simple thing in the Simplicity of his way of working and reveal right out again and as I have made the old statement many times that man Still Remains man man is always giving God praise for what he did do and always looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he's doing they fail to see what a simp thing he used to do it with see and then they look forward and see a great thing coming that's going to happen and nine times out of 10 it's already happening right around them and so simple that they don't know one day uh a man up here at udica and he claimed that there was no such a thing as God and I understood that by this the man was gloriously converted to Christ at the age of about 85 years old he asked a little girl one day who was uh coming from Sunday school why did she Wast her time on doing such a thing as that she said because she believed that there was a God and Mr Dy said that he said child you are so wrong to believe in such a thing as that and said that the little girl stooped down and picked up a a little flow to out of the off of the ground pulled it from its pedals and said Mr Darcy could you tell me how this lives there it was when he begin to search back he could said to the child what's growing in the earth and then the questions could Revol back where' the Earth come from how'd that seed get there what happened on on on and run it on back until he seen see not the great glamorous things that we think about but it's the simple things that God is so real the simplicity so it pleases God to reveal himself and then hide himself then hide himself and reveal himself in simple little things it's it's put over the top of the head of man because if you'd say why would a just God do that is because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself a man was made to rely completely upon God that's reason we're liken to Lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the Holy Spirit supposed to lead us so man is made that way and God made all of his works so simple that the simple could understand it and God makes himself simple with the simple in order to be understood by the simple we stumble over Simplicity God is so simple until the scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles but listen to the Simplicity of God and then you find God right you're in the simple ways and I'm not here to contradict school and education and try to support ill litness I'm not here for that but what it is the people as so place so much upon on that until they're even in the seminaries and so forth they're missing the very thing that God has put before them now today we preach philosophy we preach readed and denominationalism and so many things and leaving off the word because they say it can't be understood it can be understood he promised to do it now we're asking him to do it now we're going to take a few characters here for a few minutes let's notice in the days of Noah Noah's day God seen worldly wisdom so greatly punctuated and respected he sent a simple message by a simple person to show them his grace found an illiterate maybe farmer by the name of Noah a sheep herder and the simple message of of building an ark constructing is something to get into that there's no water to float it while he become a fanatic and he become a hard ball now then again in Moses day notice another time of Deliverance when God is just about to do something to deliver his people God sends a message to the people and it's so simple as we'll catch the breaking of these seals that's my purpose of bringing this first that we find out that the breaking of those seals is so simple the the the smart missed a million miles amen hallelujah I hope that God anoints me for see see it just goes over the top and that's I thought this message this morning would be appropriate to lay a foundation on the Simplicity of God see how God hides himself in Simplicity now notice Moses in the day that God was going to deliver the children of Israel according to his word he what did he do e chose a simple family we have no record of it see just a son of Levi is all we know and so uh we U and his wife just an ordinary uh probably mud Dober as a were with things out there making brick for the enemy is just an ordinary slave in Israel but God chose that family to bring forth the deliverer just an ordinary Jewish Family he never went and got royalty and celebrity or something or even got some priest he took a common ordinary family Simplicity how he always works in Simplicity yeah but God in the beginning that could have made the sun preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preach the gospel but he ordained man for that purpose and he never changes it we could tell take a a look at Cain and Abel how that that Cain tried to please God by some beauty another way people think by a great fine dressed congregation by uh priest with with ministers with robed in robed choirs and all the the put on that pleases God can you see where it come from Cain tried the same thing and he buil him an Al no doubt that he made it pretty and the man was sincere he worshiped he thought as long as I'm sincere it doesn't make any difference it does make a difference you can be sincerely wrong but Able by Revelation by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice nothing clean about it as far as it look humanly speaking but it pleased God to reveal is secret to Abel by simple faith in the shed blood notice Elijah's day God chose to hide himself in a simple person now just think of it can you grasp it God hiding in a illiterate and Elijah humbled himself and stayed with what God Said in such a way that it pleased God to take that same Spirit from Elijah and promised to shove it three times down the road from that amen and he did it sure he did sure he promised it that it would come and it come up Elisha his successor that come on John the Baptist according Malachi 4 supposed to be here again in the last day Lo God loved that spirit that was up on that simple uneducated Woodsman from back there in the wood somewhere and so it was so obedient to his word that he could say Elijah do this and Elijah would do it and God hid himself in there such Simplicity God in Simplicity amen he does the same thing the Way Up Is Down always humble yourselves don't never say well I got this and that you ain't got nothing just just remember if you got the grace of God just be thankful for it but when he came on the seene in such [Music] Simplicity they missed him they missed him L wood Banks when we sitting down there and know the god Vindicated truth when a little old dead men of fish laying on the water and the Holy Spirit spoke the day before he had go to show him his glory and do something about it and there that morning standing the Holy Spirit come down in that boat and raised up and spoke to that fish and it laying on the water dead for half half hour his gills and inals pulled out of its mouth it come to life and swim away as good as any other fish what is it God hiding himself in Simplicity are you ready ready I want shock you a little bit hallu The Rapture will be the same way yes it'll be so simple no doubt it be likewise till the Rapture will come one of these days and nobody will know nothing about itess Jesus don't don't don't get up now but study just a minute I'm sure enough clothing the Rapture will come in such a simple way till the judgments will fall and they'll see the son of man and they'll say wasn't we supposed to have such an such and wasn't there supposed to be a lie sent to us and wasn't there supposed to be a Rapture Jesus will say it's already happened and you didn't know [Music] it Lord W God in Simplicity it'll be a secret because he said he come like a thief in the night he's already told us this the Rapture then judgments shall strike sin plague sickness and everything and people cry for death to take them when the Judgment Lord why is this judgment up on us when you said there be a Rapture first he say it's already come and you didn't know it God hiding himself in Simplicity oh my all right the all has already happened in you do it l why don't Believers believe the simple signs of his coming where is our faith to believe the simple word of God just what God Said Tak him at his word god hides himself now in Simplicity in a humble little Bunch but one of these days oh he'll manifest himself as he always has in today's P time do you love him [Music]
