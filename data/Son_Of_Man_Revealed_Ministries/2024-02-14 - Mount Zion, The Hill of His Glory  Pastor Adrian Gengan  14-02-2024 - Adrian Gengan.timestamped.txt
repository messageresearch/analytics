[0:04] amen we'll speak title called Mount Zion
[0:08] the hill of his glory amen Mount Zion
[0:11] the hill of his glory Psalm 24 reads the
[0:15] Earth is the Lords and the fullness
[0:19] thereof amen that's
[0:21] ownership he's declaring ownership amen
[0:25] amen hallelujah amen there's only one
[0:27] that can put
[0:28] claims the King of Kings and the Lord of
[0:31] lords the Earth is the Lords and the
[0:35] fullness thereof the world and they that
[0:38] dwell therein amen not only is the
[0:42] heavens and earth is but the occupants
[0:44] belong to him so it's futile for man to
[0:48] fight over land when it doesn't belong
[0:51] to them they are custodians of the land
[0:55] amen praise the Lord so he starts off
[0:58] this chapter by declaring who is is the
[1:00] ruler who is the owner amen and the
[1:04] inhabitants thereof are also of the Lord
[1:07] for ye has founded it upon the Seas and
[1:11] established it upon the floods now you
[1:14] got to read Genesis there to read how
[1:16] the firmament above and the firmament
[1:19] below because you do know that science
[1:22] if you go watch all of these Rockets
[1:24] they can't get a rocket past a certain
[1:26] space it hits like called a glass
[1:28] ceiling when it touches that it
[1:31] explodes okay they were launched one
[1:33] recently you'll see the video footage
[1:35] when it hits that place it explodes the
[1:38] radiation is too great it can't go past
[1:41] that
[1:41] barrier so he's saying he founded it
[1:44] upon the Seas he established it upon the
[1:48] floods and here in verse three it says
[1:50] who shall Ascend into the hill of the
[1:52] Lord or who shall stand in his holy
[1:57] place right the hill of the Lord is
[2:00] where the presence of the Lord is the
[2:02] hill of the Lord amen is his
[2:05] Tabernacle now remember this is prior
[2:09] Calvary so they need to go to a physical
[2:13] Temple Ascend the hill go to the temple
[2:17] we know now in the Third Exodus the
[2:18] scene is changed we are the living
[2:20] Tabernacle of the most high
[2:22] God but the one that can Ascend the
[2:25] glory realm can get into the glory of
[2:28] the Lord is one that had Clean Hands and
[2:31] a pure heart amen must have clean hands
[2:36] and a pure heart who had not lifted up
[2:39] his soul unto vanity nor sworn
[2:43] deceitfully now this person that has
[2:45] Clean Hands pure heart doesn't lift his
[2:47] soul to vanity or sworn deceitfully has
[2:50] a blessing attached to it he shall
[2:53] receive the blessing from the Lord and
[2:56] the righteousness from the god of his
[2:58] salvation
[3:00] this is the generation of them that seek
[3:02] him that seek thy face oh
[3:06] Jacob which generation the end time
[3:10] generation this is the
[3:12] generation amen not the generation gone
[3:15] before but I say to you this is the
[3:18] generation I'm reading from the Bible
[3:20] Church of God I'm saying this is the
[3:23] generation of them that seek him that
[3:26] seek thy faith oh Jacob lift up your
[3:29] head now watch there's a pause there at
[3:31] the sixth then in the seventh lift up he
[3:34] heads ho he Gates and be lift up he
[3:37] Everlasting doors and let the king of
[3:40] glory and the king of glory shall come
[3:43] in amen amen who is the king of glory
[3:46] the lord strong and mighty the Lord
[3:49] Mighty in battle lift up he heads oh he
[3:51] Gates even lift them up the Everlasting
[3:54] doors and the king of glory shall come
[3:57] in who is the king of glory
[4:00] the Lord of hosts he is the king of
[4:03] glory amen the Lord had blessings to the
[4:05] reading of his word you may be
[4:07] seated praise the
[4:11] Lord
[4:12] amen so as we've been built up in the
[4:15] message of the hour we know that Mount
[4:18] Zion is typing an end time people amen
[4:21] hallelujah the Lord had met his people
[4:25] on different mountains at different time
[4:27] am amen but in the end time there not a
[4:30] physical mountain called Mount
[4:32] Zion it's a
[4:34] spiritual reference to the body and the
[4:36] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ Mount
[4:38] Zion the Lamb's wife amen the city of
[4:42] the Living God where God dwells where
[4:45] God
[4:46] Tabernacles Hallelujah aren't you glad
[4:48] to be part of the Tabernacle of God Amen
[4:51] praise the Lord amen if you know these
[4:53] things say Amen so I know that you know
[4:55] it I don't have to go digging the quotes
[4:57] for you and show you and prove to you
[4:59] that m Zion is the city of the Living
[5:01] God we've been through this through the
[5:03] years amen Mount Zion Hallelujah now in
[5:07] Psalms 24 is speaking about the hill of
[5:09] the Lord this means the place where the
[5:12] Lord lived amongst his
[5:15] people you would know it's the place of
[5:17] the Tabernacle at once you remember the
[5:19] meeting place around the
[5:21] tent then when the temple was
[5:24] built right think of Abraham now because
[5:27] they say that the temple is built where
[5:30] Isaac was about to be
[5:32] sacrificed same spot but did he go up
[5:34] the
[5:36] hill amen he went up the hill did the
[5:40] Lord Jesus go up the hill amen so it's
[5:43] all shadows and types so he's asking who
[5:46] shall Ascend the hill of the Lord who
[5:48] shall go into the glory realm where his
[5:51] glory
[5:52] descends now that is typing now we said
[5:55] the Tabernacle the temple the hill of
[5:57] the Lord that's what who shall Ascend
[5:59] the the hill of the Lord means who wants
[6:01] to really go into his glory realm
[6:05] amen so from that time forward where
[6:08] David is referencing it it's called The
[6:10] Hill of the Lord Jerusalem Mount
[6:13] Zion amen now we know that like we said
[6:16] now Mount Zion is the
[6:18] bride the Lamb's wife which is the holy
[6:21] place where the presence and the glory
[6:23] of God
[6:24] dwells amen hallelujah we are to carry
[6:28] ourselves am amen recognizing that we
[6:30] carry the anointing of the most high

[10:25] amen amen the bride of Christ which is
[10:28] you and I are reflecting the glory of
[10:31] God on the earth now yes and we are not
[10:34] reflecting
[10:36] it it's shining from Heaven to Earth
[10:39] hear me what I'm saying now not in this
[10:42] time in this season not in the second
[10:44] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ we are
[10:47] not reflectors of the Sun from
[10:53] Heaven amen how me if you understand
[10:55] what I'm saying the sun is not in heaven
[10:58] and the moon on the Earth and we are

[11:24] again because I wanted to sink in the
[11:26] Holy Ghost In You Is God Amen
[11:31] amen I i' like to make it simple amen so
[11:34] that you understand the Holy Ghost In
[11:36] You Is God Amen God tabernacled your
[11:41] flesh you say but I thought that was a
[11:44] onean scripture a son of man revealing
[11:46] the son of man you know something about
[11:48] a
[11:50] manufacturer when he when he's creating
[11:52] a car let's talk about
[11:54] cars they have a
[11:57] prototype
[12:00] you know where I'm going with this they
[12:01] have a
[12:03] prototype and until they Excel that
[12:06] prototype yes they won't put it in mass
[12:09] production so God worked with a one man
[12:12] scripture God worked with a prophet amen
[12:15] until the Prototype was perfected until
[12:18] he could fully display his glory through
[12:20] this one Prophet amen then he said this
[12:22] wave she way before us amen I have
[12:25] confidence in this amen I have
[12:27] confidence in man now amen that the wave
[12:30] sheath is waved before the people and if
[12:32] I can reflect my glory through him I can
[12:35] now reflect it to the people who accept
[12:37] his message amen amen thank you
[12:40] Hallelujah you see we carry within us I
[12:43] was trying to present this to you on
[12:44] Sunday amen I was trying to present I
[12:47] don't know if you really got it or
[12:49] not that what we have different from the
[12:53] other churches is our Revelation yeah
[12:56] the revelation of the mysteries of God
[12:58] yes
[12:59] and and what that value is what the
[13:02] essence of the Revelation is the
[13:03] substance the glory of the Revelation is
[13:06] is that when we receive the
[13:09] Revelation yesen it is the glory of God
[13:12] revealed to us because to you it is
[13:15] given to know the mysteries of the
[13:16] kingdom of
[13:18] God so why I'm what I'm telling you I'm
[13:21] trying to bring it down I'm trying to
[13:23] break it down now let us not devalue the
[13:26] Revelation that we have in this hour am
[13:28] and think that the prophet came to
[13:30] reveal the mysteries of God for no
[13:32] reason we think it has no value to us it
[13:35] doesn't pertain to our daily lives but
[13:37] the the Revelation is our glory amen
[13:40] because what is coming out of the
[13:42] Revelation out of the Hidden Mysteries
[13:45] is coming forth of Faith amen because
[13:48] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[13:50] will literally turn our hearts back to
[13:52] the faith of the fathers so there is
[13:55] glory in the Revelation revealed to us
[13:58] amen because the the Revelation is
[14:00] Christ himself being
[14:02] revealed how many of you know that's in
[14:04] the seal it's Christ revealing himself
[14:07] amen amen hallelujah so he's come to
[14:09] make it so plain to us so clear to us
[14:12] that this is now when his character is
[14:14] revealed to us when his nature is
[14:16] revealed to us his mind is revealed to
[14:19] us that's him revealing his
[14:21] glory and he'll reveal and share his
[14:24] glory with no one except the one to whom
[14:26] he has given after the kingdom oh yes
[14:29] amen so what a privilege we have church
[14:32] that we have been given the mysteries of
[14:33] the Kingdom of Heaven the mystery that
[14:36] he had locked up in the back part of his
[14:37] mind is now revealed to you and I you
[14:41] say I don't understand the Mysteries I
[14:43] don't understand the Revelation then you
[14:44] need to stay in the presence of God till
[14:47] he reveals it to
[14:49] you outside of the the mystery of God
[14:51] being revealed in this hour outside of
[14:53] us getting a understanding of the
[14:56] mysteries of God the revelation of God
[14:58] our our life has no
[15:01] value do you know if let me say it this
[15:04] way the
[15:07] Mysteries equals
[15:09] Thunders amen amen because he says the
[15:12] Thunders are the divinely revealed
[15:14] truths mystery truths right so I know
[15:17] many times when we say Thunders people
[15:19] don't understand what that means they
[15:20] think it's very mysterious amen
[15:22] hallelujah praise the Lord but it is him
[15:25] revealing himself to us through his word
[15:27] amen
[15:30] God has no higher order than revealing
[15:32] his word than through his Prophet yes
[15:36] amen but when he is revealing his word
[15:38] he's really revealing himself to us
[15:41] Christ amen praise the Lord amen you
[15:45] know these are the things we ought to be
[15:48] rejoicing about amen because this is
[15:52] life you you may be thinking what is the
[15:54] value in this I'm trying to show you the
[15:56] value in the revelation of the word it
[15:58] is the glory of God revealed to us am
[16:02] because think of it now when the glory
[16:03] of the Lord is revealed only this word
[16:06] this glory is going to produce rapturing
[16:08] Faith amen because Faith cometh by the
[16:11] hearing hearing of the word of God but
[16:13] how about when all the Mysteries are
[16:15] revealed what value will hearing that
[16:19] word amen the word revealed by the
[16:21] prophet the word where the Bible is made
[16:24] a new book to us it's going to produce a
[16:26] perfect Faith because we have partial
[16:29] understanding of the scriptures we have
[16:31] perfect understanding of the scriptures
[16:33] so it's got to produce a perfect Faith
[16:35] Can you say amen amen yes Hallelujah you
[16:38] know when you're sitting in algebra
[16:40] class and you you you bit lost in the
[16:42] class you and the teacher say you
[16:43] understand everybody say you understand
[16:45] amen hallelujah so I pray it's not going
[16:48] over your head this evening and I'm
[16:50] trying to break it down as and I'm not
[16:52] trying to talk message language but I
[16:53] really want to bring it down
[16:55] amen because the church cannot progress
[16:59] unless it understands who she is and the
[17:01] value of what has been revealed to us so
[17:04] I'm speaking about man Zion the hill of
[17:06] his
[17:08] glory so if people want to see the glory
[17:10] of God where must they come go to
[17:13] Israel see the
[17:16] temple go before the
[17:19] wall there's no value in
[17:21] that that is what the prophet says a day
[17:25] gone
[17:26] by Looking In if you want to go to
[17:29] Israel fine I know the the prophet
[17:31] encourages people he says you know what
[17:33] you go to Israel the Bible becomes a new
[17:35] book to you not a new book but it
[17:37] becomes alive to you because you walk
[17:40] where Jesus walked the Sea of Galilee
[17:42] you go to the tomb amen it makes you
[17:45] maybe understand the Bible better amen
[17:49] those experiences become alive to you
[17:52] but I'm saying if we really recognize
[17:54] who you are yes then that you have more
[17:57] value than that amen if people want to
[18:01] come into His presence if people want to
[18:03] come into the Tabernacle of God where
[18:05] must they
[18:07] come say
[18:09] me amen because who are you yes brother
[18:11] ra the word but who are you you are the
[18:13] word made
[18:15] flesh amen now it may seem a lot to
[18:18] swallow because you think me with my
[18:20] faults and my failures because you're
[18:22] looking at the flesh now me with my
[18:25] faults and my failures and my short
[18:26] temper and my attitude and my no
[18:30] patience and my all of these things but
[18:34] God is working on you oh yes building
[18:36] you up amen amen hallelujah don't look
[18:40] at the flesh thank you that's why the
[18:43] Apostle Paul is admonishing us I die to
[18:45] the flesh
[18:46] daily you see it's a struggle for you to
[18:49] really serve God I'm talking according
[18:51] to the flesh but when the spirit rules
[18:54] the
[18:54] [Music]
[18:56] flesh you take dominion over the the
[18:58] flesh amen right so I want you those of
[19:02] us that are exercising Mark 11:23 in the
[19:05] hour you can't exercise Mark 11:23 and
[19:08] call things into existence if you can't
[19:10] bring this under
[19:12] subjection first speak to your own flesh
[19:16] amen speak to this
[19:19] mountain amen everybody here what I'm
[19:22] saying before you go and speak to any
[19:25] other thing situation speak to this
[19:27] mountain say you come under subjection
[19:30] you like certain things I'm bringing you
[19:32] under
[19:33] subjection listen here my body is in a
[19:37] fallen state but I am coming back
[19:39] through Redemption amen and I have a c
[19:42] Gene Within Me amen hallelujah yes you
[19:46] know you got the C Gene within you
[19:48] that's all that
[19:50] matters amen because there is value
[19:53] there's Essence to the seed you put that
[19:55] seed in the right atmosphere it's going
[19:57] to grow yes and when that seed grows no
[20:00] matter if you put that seed in any other
[20:03] place as long as it's in the right
[20:04] environment what is in that seed
[20:07] Hallelujah if fact I don't know what the
[20:09] right word is but the DNA of that seed
[20:11] must come forth yes so if you are the
[20:14] gene of God the attribute of God the
[20:17] seed of God you are going to come forth
[20:20] in this hour irrespective of how your
[20:23] faults and your failures amen you are
[20:25] going to come forth in this hour shining
[20:27] forth in your Eden Beauty yes Lord amen
[20:30] so look past your faults amen look at
[20:33] the value of the Cross look at the blood
[20:36] amen hallelujah amen because when Satan
[20:39] is making you focus on your faults and
[20:42] failures he's basically telling you the
[20:44] blood was not enough and if you dwell on
[20:47] that and say yes I'm so weak I'm so
[20:49] feeble I'm like this you are also
[20:51] agreeing with the devil that the blood
[20:53] was not enough because the blood
[20:54] cleanses us from sin the blood cleanses
[20:57] us amen Hallelujah and makes us
[20:59] righteous thank you Lord hallelujah the
[21:01] blood amen apply the blood apply the
[21:04] token you Lord thank you Lord there is
[21:08] power in the cleansing blood of the Lamb
[21:09] thank you Lord amen praise the Lord so
[21:12] what are we really saying now is the
[21:14] season where we are reflecting the glory
[21:16] from within identifying that this is the
[21:19] day of St John
[21:21] 14:20 what is say in John
[21:23] 14:20 amen what is say in John 14 I'm
[21:27] saying this is the day where St John
[21:29] 14:20 is coming to
[21:31] pass let's read St John 14:20 it says at
[21:36] that day you shall know that I jesus am
[21:41] in the father and you the bride in me
[21:44] and I Jesus in where
[21:48] amen now if we are so close to the
[21:52] Rapture and the
[21:54] Rapture comes
[21:57] tomorrow is this scripture a future
[21:59] event or must it be fulfilled before the
[22:04] Rapture must this scripture be fulfilled
[22:06] before the
[22:08] Rapture so he says that that day you
[22:10] shall know I am in the father you in me
[22:13] and I in you amen it's no longer I that
[22:17] liveth but Christ that liveth in me amen
[22:21] amen now we're going to read Hebrews
[22:22] chapter 12 this is a very important
[22:24] scripture for what we are saying now
[22:26] you'll see here what the Apostle Paul is
[22:29] telling
[22:30] us so remember all the mountains all the
[22:33] hills where God's presence was his
[22:36] presence was So Glorious that nobody
[22:39] could touch it nobody could come near
[22:42] except Moses except the priest but even
[22:45] they what they had to have clean hands
[22:48] and a pure heart everybody agree right
[22:52] so he's saying you have not come unto
[22:55] the mount that might be touched
[22:58] for you are not come unto the mount that
[23:00] might be touched and that burned with
[23:04] fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and
[23:07] Tempest and the sound of a
[23:11] trumpet and the voice of
[23:18] words what happened on the mountain
[23:21] there was a
[23:23] cloud there was
[23:25] voices amen his glory sh kind of Glory
[23:28] was coming down there was
[23:31] fire right which which voice that they
[23:35] heard entreated that the word should not
[23:38] be spoken to them
[23:40] anymore I want you to focus on the
[23:43] scripture now where is The Voice coming
[23:47] from
[23:49] Heaven The Voice is coming from
[23:53] Heaven everybody say The Voice is coming
[23:56] from Heaven Voice is coming from
[23:58] tell your neighbor The Voice is coming
[24:00] from heaven I'm doing this for a reason
[24:02] because when I go to another scripture
[24:04] you'll tie it in with what Paul is
[24:06] saying
[24:10] right for they could not endure that
[24:13] which was
[24:14] commanded you see when this event
[24:17] happens the church world can't
[24:20] endure you're seeing it now they could
[24:24] not endure that which was
[24:26] commanded and if so much as a beast
[24:29] touched the mountains it should not be
[24:31] stoned or thrust through with a dart and
[24:33] so terrible was the sight that Moses
[24:36] said I exceedingly fear and
[24:39] quick now the scene changes
[24:42] but you I come unto Mount
[24:47] Zion and unto the city of the Living God
