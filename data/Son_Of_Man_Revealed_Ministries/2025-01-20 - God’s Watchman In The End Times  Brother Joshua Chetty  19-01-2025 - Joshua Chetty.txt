========================================

hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he had given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God and we have known and believed the love that God had to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have Holiness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casted our fear because fear had torment he that fear is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hated his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he have seen how can he love God who he who he have not seen and this Commandments have we from him that he who loved God love with his brother also amen the the prophet said something very important and I think it's it's good to know it earlier this year than later he said that fear does do it nothing it brings absolutely nothing but faith faith in God it it delivers God delivers in faith 100% so and perfect love we ought to have trust and hope in God Amen amen praise the Lord remain seated amen even as we sing this last chorus and we call our pastor Adrian forward amen let's s touching Jesus is all that matters amen touching Jesus is all that [Music] matters and your love will never be the same there is only and there is only one way to touch him just believe oh just believe when you call on his name touching Jesus touching Jesus is all that matter and your never be the [Music] same there is only only one way we can touch [Music] him we must believe we call on his name amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's certainly good to be found in the house of the Lord amen would you greet your brother and sister sitting next to you welcome them in the house of the Lord say God bless you good to see you amen hallelujah amen appreciate and love every one of you amen praying for you I pray you praying for us amen because even as we see the day F approaching we know that the enemy's attack will be greater but we know that the bride is an invincible Army amen amen hallelujah no weapon formed against her shall prosper just want to read a little quote amen uh if the brother can find it in the angel of the the Lord 51052 amen Wednesday we were speaking on are you able to discern the signs of the time like William Brandon amen and we went through amen quite a few things of the Prophet how he would look at events situations he would look at uh blackouts UFOs uh Angels appearing and how you would tie it to signs of the end time he would look at natural disasters he would look at politics he would look at amen all of these things happening because we know these are all key players is to the signs of the end time and one thing that caught our attention was this in paragraph 54 we know amen that uh they had this Golden Globe awards there in LA and they were mocking God Amen on the 6th of January and then on the 7th of January fir broke out amen and this is the quote we want to read over on the east coast they always hollering at me why you going to the West Coast everybody pulls out to Los Angeles maybe that's God's place now we were showing you why that was God's place because Los Angeles is where isza Street Revival started amen so God started a Revival 1906 start of the latest Church age in Los Angeles notice if they reject it judgment must strike so he goes on to say right here is probably where judgment will strike amen he says and that's right let's get ready then he says my this will probably be the first place it'll hit amen this will probably be the first place it'll be hit right in here amen oh Church hold to God's unchanging hand pray amen amen hallelujah so we see all of these signs amen we shouldn't be desensitized amen by our modern day living and our standards of living and and just chasing amen after things in this life we should be so in tune with prophetic word of God to see that these things now brother BR would also say in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel Amen in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel paragraph uh you can find this he says how many has heard me say if you want to know what time of week it is look at the calendar if you want to know what time we're living in he's talking about God's prophetic calendar he says watch the Jews yes amen amen that's God's calendar taken right from there so if we are watching the Jews we know that doors have started to open up we started to speak on the opening up of Dimensional Doors because in the fourth seal it's telling you that a door was open hell was let loose upon the Earth Hell Followed the four Rider so we know that the pope on the 24th of uh December announced that it's the start of the Jubilee for them right onee pilgrimage he announced a jubilee and he opened four important doors they call it only doors right we know that these were not just normal signs because when the pope went amen back in the prophet's day the moon blacked out right we showed you that on Wednesday how the prophet is reading when the moon blacked out what that meant for the church he's not seeing it as a it's an eclipse of the the the moon what a phenomenon he is typing it biblical events and he's saying look how the church is blacked out and he said exactly how signs capture those pictures six phases of the moon he says the Holy Spirit had drawn it on the board amen how the church had blacked out and then we told you that amen January starting now planets are going to line up six planets will line up now and then seven planet planets will line up amen and the prophet is telling you that when the planets line up it's a sign the first sign he says was when the word word was made flesh in Jesus right remember this fortune teller is telling the Prophet this on the bus yes the first time this thing lined up was when Jesus was born what was that word made flesh somebody pay attention now second time he says it would lined up when you were born what was that son of man Ministry word was going to be made flesh again so when planets start to landine up up again could it be a sign that the word is going to be made flesh in the bride amen yes look for it amen expect it so we are looking at all of these things and we are learning these things because of the prophetic gift that was released to the bride amen just like how Esther said under the ministry of Moriah the bride is sitting under the ministry of William brandham and learning how to discern the signs of the time amen so praise the Lord amen so we see now that they negotiated a peace deal there so the prophet said watch the Jews right I just read it he said if you want to know what time watch the Jews and you know there's opening of doors like we are saying these are not ordinary doors right these are demonic doors but the prophet says God will not be defeated he says when all of hell is let loose he says all of Heaven is also let loose on the earth amen so it's time to connect with the Angelic realm amen like Elisha said open the boy's eyes if we are not connected now with the Angelic realm we are going to miss it do you know that every Son of God was connected with the Angelic realm amen if you can put up Daniel 6:22 there amen we'll see what Daniel is saying how you were saved from the Lion's Den what saved Daniel Amen it's interesting we know that uh he wasn't there alone my God had sent his Angel amen amen Daniel is saying the Lions didn't eat me because my God is sent his Angel and had shut the lion's mouth amen so if we are not connected with the Angelic realm right now because angels are ministering spirits to the ear of Salvation that's the Bible so we going to see now from Tomorrow doors are going to open again Trump coming back for his second coming amen you know what's going to happen there amen you can see everyone is bowing down to Trump you got all Tech Giants you got Elon Musk you got Mark Zuckerberg you got amen all of these Tech Giants bowing down amen even this guy from Apple what's his name Steve something this new guy Tim yeah so they all have met with I even read this morning Bill Gates also met with Trump and he says Trump got some fantastic ideas so we can see all of them are bowing down why because of Revelation 13:12 put up Revelation 13:12 there you'll see all of these things coming into play now right and he exercised all the power of the first Beast before him and caused all the Earth and all them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed so don't expect to see much communication from the pope because the second part of Revelation 13 deals with the US speaking with the mouth of the Dragon amen amen amen so they are going to be fulfilling laws and unfolding these prophecies amen so watch now Trump coming in it's going to open up a dimensional door as well because all of these leaders are anointed with Spirits demonic spirits amen praise the Lord so even as we start to see these things unfold the Bible says lift up your head look up because your Redemption is drawing n amen so amen uh we're glad Amen to be found in the house of the Lord I thought I'll just encourage you with that amen uh brother Joshua is going to be sharing the word of the Lord I wasn't too well the last couple of days so I don't know I think I'll be able to preach this morning amen I get in the office and I see brother Joshua was also out with the flu amen hallelujah so but he'll still be ministering he was a very good Steward he didn't fall me back and say I can't make it amen so he's going to preach this morning amen so I'm very happy to see our brother lenon here this morning amen his dear wife amen let's give them a hand welcome them amen that's the brother of our brother Denver here if you don't know amen so amen it's always been on my heart I've always been reaching out to him for and he knows that amen ever since I saw him there at the birthday with the sun's birthday always been reaching out to him and the other day when he was there at work he was doing some fitment on a vehicle I saw him and I went rushing down to see him amen I had a chat to him and I'm very glad that he's here this morning amen amen other than the chat I believe it's the angel of God who is speaking to his heart amen the the Lord will speak and minister to his heart and uh amen I pray that he'll be blessed in the house of the Lord this morning amen he did tell me that he might have to leave a bit early because his son needs transport or something amen so just excuse me if he leaves a bit early amen so let's prepare our hearts now for the word of God Amen let's stand together even as we receive our brother Joshua amen Our Sister Kim wasn't here to do Sunday school this morning amen but we thank Sister Sarah for stepping in at the last minute amen amen to the kids were so excited and we told them do you want to cancel Sunday school and they said no so we found a last minut of replacement amen so we thank Sister Sarah for stepping in there amen hallelujah oh he's worthy to be praised yes let's sing that song again amen signs of the time are everywhere from F amen praise the Lord amen we invite our brother Joshua to come signs of the time are [Applause] everywhere oh there a grand new feeling in the air Hallelujah so keep your eyes [Music] the EAS [Music] Sky lift up your hand [Music] Redemption and [Music] by is a brand [Music] new in the end so keep your eyes upon the he [Music] Sky lift up your Redemption hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord father we come before you this morning knowing Lord that we can see the signs all around us and Lord we can see this bride in his maturity Lord at one stage Lord it was in infancy yes Lord but this is the hour of maturity oh god oh this is the hour where fruit cannot be hidden Lord Oh Lord the fruit is showing huah and father all that was just taking along and to be separated cuz it's a separating time father thank you Lord and this is the hour Lord when you are calling for a total separation from unbelief yes Lord Oh Lord we know that this is a serious hour Lorden and we realize the seriousness of this hour Lord Jesus we know this message is something special and dear to us Lord this message wasn't just some theology hallelujah or just some to get some people together and have churchianity but this message was to get a people to have a dimensional change this message was to get a people ready for a Rapture oh Father and to bring them back to their original condition yes Lord and father as we see Sons and Daughters this morning who's here Lord oh to profess your name who here Lord to praise you who's here Lord to adore you I pray Lord that you'll come and speak to our hearts father Yes Lord you know the things that we have need of oh god oh we are lying upon you to morning oh God we pray Lord for the sick and Afflicted that your healing hands will be upon them oh God you are Jehovah raer our healer father oh we know Lord that healing is a children's bread oh you still the god that Heals Nothing is Impossible nothing can stand in your way father oh we pray father that right now those that are sick and afflicted by your healing hands will be upon them those that are standing in the gap for their loved ones may your hands be upon them and I pray for the backsliding right now Lord Jesus oh that your Holy Spirit may bring conviction upon the soul oh God to recognize the hour that we living in I pray and ask now that you come and have your own way Holy Spirit Come have the preeminently in Jesus name we pray amen amen and amen amen thank you amen I greet you all now Lov the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah please bear with me just pick up the flu the grace of God Amen you know the spirit is vibrant but the body is tells something else but we pray that God will have his own way amen amen we turn to the Book of Ezekiel reading from chapter 33 ver one to9 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when I bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coast and set him for their Watchmen if if when he see the sword come upon the land he blow the Trump and warn the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet yes and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head yes he heard the sound of the trumpet he he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the Watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not wed if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will require at the watchman's hand so thou oh son of man I have set thee a Watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shall hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me when I say unto the wicked of Wicked Man th thou sh surely die if thou Dost not speak to one the wicked from his way that Wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will require at thine hand nevertheless if thou want the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou has delivered thy Soul amen thank God for reading of his word you may be seated we also turn to the Book of Revelation 13 reading from verse 11 Revelation 13 reading from verse 11 and I beheld another Beast coming out of the earth and he had two arms like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first pce before him stop there amen so we know that we had a Watchman in this day amen amen God had a Watchman for the age yes amen and if he had a Watchman for the age and then there has to be people right now God has to appoint a people that will Echo the same same words of the Watchmen amen amen because why when the when the Seven Seals was open the Bible became a new book amen amenu and all the secret God had plainly declared to his bride amen and she is to Echo the same words of the prophet in this day amen but the Holy Spirit takes charge of his own word amen amen so those that are part of God those that are part of his program those that have the token in this hour those that have identity in this hour those that have representation yes because out of representation you don't have a body of there yes if you don't have representation you don't have a theophany yes that's why the Pharisees could hear the same words that Jesus was speaking yet they were holy people but they didn't have representation but the woman of the well an ill Fame woman she had representation amen because she had a theophany up there amen amen therefore you find in this hour God is entrusting Watchman amen yes and and and and a Watchman is not a normal person they entrusted to be spiritually Vigilant amen they called to have discernment in this hour they're called to take the same word that was given through the prophets and to to take that same prophecy and watch over over that prophecy that's what the Watchman is doing in this hour the fivefold ministry amen is to watch over brandom's prophecy amen amen amen yes to ensure that Brandon prophecy is coming to pass amen every other person is looking at the news every other person is looking at world events but a true Watchman is our as discernments amen he doesn't see things as just tomorrow for example is a Inauguration in America and everyone's looking forward towards it and they're expecting something great things to happen even the Christians in America expecting something great to happen because finally they they feel they have a president who is for them but State and religion cannot be together am history is repeating itself amen amen we already know in 1960 there was a union between aab and Jezebel yes amen that was told by The Watchmen amen amen when there was a union between aab and Jezebel and that Union hasn't stopped amen because aab right now when we are seeing aab speaking she's actually being the mouthpiece for Jezebel yes amen amen amen because what does revelation 10 811 she exercised the power of the first Beast amen and now you're going to see it becoming more clear to you yes amen modern day events are made clear by prophecy amen now it's going to become more clear yes while the church world was excited we have a person that's going to accommodate us didn't that happen and didn't that happen in in the days of Constantine when Nero was burning Rome and blaming the Christians then came Constantine Constantine and said you now I will give now positions in the church I will now give you wealth I will now give you land didn't it happen yes when Pagan Rome became paper Rome yes amen amen so Watchman is required to be vigilant amen God has got Watchman in this hour to watch the hour that we are living in to watch the condition of the church to watch the condition of mankind and also to show ensure that the bride stay in cause amen because the bride is no longer in infancy amen there was a time when she was green she was laying in the presence of the son for all these years but now she's ripened amen and now she's in the fruit form hallelujah amen and now all this word that's in she's bubbling with his rivers of from this with this Fountain of Life with this inexhaustible Fountain of Life and she cannot keep quiet anymore that's why now she must prophesy again before Nations and tongues amen watching over the prophecy of brother brandham amen yes amen so she have to see deser the times of the times amen you know brother Bram had that that encounter he showed the symbol when he took the Rock and he threw it in the air yes and he said judgment shck the West Coast yes and he said it almost sunk Alaska yes and he said he didn't stop there yes so judgment as in God's impending judgment has been coming on and on yes until you even see now in Los Angeles with the prophet prophecy where he spoke that Los Angeles will sink she will go to the bottom of the ocean that's his prophecy that is thus say the Lord hallelujah and the message choosing of the Bride he says that amen amen but he said could it be the starting point of judgment because that's where all the full come yes the full come from Hollywood yes the influence from The Fifth Dimension working through the fourth dimension through Hollywood infiltrating homes infiltrating the whole world Amen and influencing mankind that's how demon powers were coming through the screen and through the high as they watching it demon powers were influencing man we're coming upon man and that's why you find that every fashion every train of every sin it comes from Hollywood amen but you find the great deception right now that's coming in amen because why religious power political power is all coming together yes amen and we know that we had we Gentiles had the gospel for 2,000 years yes now the gospel must go back to the Jews yes amen yes amen the only thing that's holding the Jews back from receiving the gospel is the bride amen the next event to take place is the voice of the Resurrection we are sealed up under the shouts hallelujah amen this bride is sealed up in the shouts amen which are the message going forth it seal Us in yes amen he said I will meet you in there amen and in there is sh glory amen amen where where you don't need light for man manmade light amen amen where you got God is the light of the city amen hallelujah because in there is the makeup of a pyramid City yes amen amen a p City that's going to leave the Earth amen and a p City that's going to come back to the Earth yes amen amen then Jesus when he left didn't he take a trail of all the Old Testament Saints with him yes just like that the body now the body of Christ is going to live in that form amen amen but we find that impending judgment is coming upon the earth and the next phase now the next phase will move from the from the the shout to the voice yes but right now C up under the shout is the hour where the foolish virgins will come and say give me some of your oil yeah but it's going to be too late then yes because that is the dividing line amen amen they had all these years to receive the Gospel they had all these years to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes amen they had good works they followed Church order and Doctrine they had good religion they were good people but they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they didn't have the oil they couldn't come into a union amen he takes a union amen there's an invisible Union that was taking place amen where there was Oneness he he said father may they be one even as we are one amen this Union is in such a manner where where the bride and Christ is so much alike that all you can see when you see her you will see the word amen amen because she's CH changing from flesh to word yes amen something that she bypassed she bypassed that theophany but she's coming to that amen and she cannot come into it unless she has that representation there that's why you find sometime you preaching to people you you're explaining them the word and they just can't see it they got to have representation not everybody has representation there not every every body has a theop there yes because the Bible says the rest of the Dead live not until a thousand years amen they come up in the white Throne judgment only those that have bodies will will go in the first resurrection amen who come in the first resurrection and those that are alive and remain shall be caught up with them so we find that the influence of Satan is now being manifested yes in laws M yeah in in legal systems in practices and you're going to see now the the the the this this this Beast Revelation 13 America the USA the system is going to now be an influence to the whole world yes and it's very easy for them because everybody trades with them yes and all they have to do is if you don't follow suit we'll stop your trade we'll raise taxes on the trade so you see that everybody now is lining up coming to trying to be close to this man but did God ask us to follow a man no the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness Hallelujah then all these things shall be added unto you we don't need the favor of man yes amen amen Our Father owned the CLE on a thousand years amen we don't want to we don't want to worship any creation we want to worship the Creator amen we are part of the creat we are part of him amen yes we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen amen amen amen so that's why you find in this hour a good Watchman is not going to shun to tell you the full counsel of God Amen like in Acts 2027 he says for I have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God yes amen a good Watchman is not here to make you come together together and just have church he's got no time to play church amen yes the true five4 Ministry is our got no time to play church amen we don't want just a religious gathering yes the true five Ministry is yeah with a work to do amen and his work is to get that body into is to build up the body of Christ yes Amen to bring her into maturity in this hour to get her into that pyramid City Amen to make her find God's purpose in our life amen and to also wner about the things that are happening on the earth yes to W of Satan schemes a true Watchman is also one that will stand in the gap for the people amen just like Moses how he stood in the gap for the people the spirit of Christ was upon him a true Watchman will also stand in the gap yes amen a true Watchman will also want the bride against apostasy yes he will have discernment to recognize that if something is out of the word he have to you have true discernment to see that is not in line with the word that is your own opinion amen but that doesn't match up to the word it must be line upon line here a little there a little amen it must D together it cannot misplace it cannot mislocate amen you cannot misinterpret the word yes he's got to Be watchful over the things yes he's got to watch over God's flock amen so we find that God has called and set men apart to to fulfill this purpose yes now you find a Watchman firstly he's going to see a far off he got to have special eyes sights amen that's why you find the The Watchman of the age the prophet of the age he could see a far off he was a Seer hallelujah amen he was an eagle amen amen amen liken unto an eagle a prophet amen yes an arc cannot go where he goes it will disintegrates amen amen but this Prophet didn't just see beyond his age he took you to the back part of God's mind amen he showed you your Origins amen he showed you your origin and he showed you what you turn him back to he showed you the true purpose of redemption he's taking you back to an original condition amen amen that's why you find that you're living in a time where a man is so afraid right now that you know with all the things that happening they frightened hey can the economy fail can will the economy fail can we rely on anything we rely upon the word of God yes he said don't take thought of what food you're going to eat don't take thought of what clothes you're going to wear he said the spatters of the air amen God cares for them the lies of the field the tri Lord yet Solomon was not a raid like one of them yes amen so he knows the things that you have need of we are like upon Him amen amen so he says here the Watchman what he was the duties of the Watchman in the whole Testament The Watchman was the man that went up to a tower in the city way high he was higher than all the footmen because it was his position now in order for this man to get up there he must have a good clear understanding yes and he must have good eyes so he must have spiritualized amen he must be alert in other words he's looking at modern day events made clear by prophecy amen he must know the Stars so you must see God shows signs in the heaven when you seeing the signs in the heaven something is taking place on the earth yes that's why you find right now the stars are going to align during this week amen the sorry the planets are going to align themselves yes and if the the planets are lining theel the prophet said that's is there's a spiritual application to that yes am amen there's a spiritual application that God must show the sign in the heavens first amen so something's fixing to happen amen yes he says because it was his position in order for this man to get up there he must have a good clear understanding he must have good eyes he must be alert he must know the stars and many qualification had to be before he could be a correct Watchman amen now everybody likes to be a Watchman everybody likes to be a minister but to be a correct Watchman there's a qualification amen and there's a scriptural qualification yesen and I'm afraid today that we put some Watchmen in that couldn't see very far yes sir oh couldn't see all the disaster that's coming to w the people then unqualified a Watchman would soon have the city destroyed because the entire city depended on the Watchmen now don't we have a pyramid City amen this PID city is depending on the true Watchman in his hour amen amen hallelujah who is going to look at their interests is going to look after Brandon's prophecy over their lives amen I'm talking about your own prophecy what the Bible says about you your part of the prophecy your part of the scripture must be fulfilled it must be accomplished in this hour that's why you got Watchmen to watch over that Amen to ensure that the city comes to its position amen amen it says the entire city depended on the Watchmen God's Watchmen just like is in the Bible his Prophet was considered Eagles the eagle a would climb higher than any other bird a AR trying to follow an eagle with just disintegrate in the air he could never get there because the eagle is a special built bird for the purpose hallelujah amen if he wasn't when he went up his feathers would fall out of him did you ever try to pull the feathers out of an eagle's wings oh they great tough feathers because they bear the young ones on their on these feathers and they must be way high and they go and what good would he do do him to go up if he could couldn't have sight to see way off that's what I think today if we educate our ministers what good does it do to educate them if they have a spiritual Insight if they haven't got a spiritual inside to see far the coming and warning of the danger amen amen he's just like giving you your canary bird good wans to make good Wing feathers and and then keeping him in a cage what good what good does it do to give him vitamin what good does it do to learn of a God that was if it isn't the same today amen what good does it do to learn the Bible if you're going to deny all the power thereof it we must be equipped for such amen amen we're not talking about a God in history we're talking about the God in now what could we do to talk about a God that was but we want to see God in his people we want to see God made flesh again God dwelling amongst his people amen so that is that is what a Watchman going to watch over amen God in his people without denying the power amen so he says we have a Watchman a Watchman that climbed the rampants of Glory the Holy Spirit was sent back to Tower in men and woman amen who would believe God that's the Watchman amen hallelujah the the Holy Spirit sent to us as a Watchman that watches over us he is our Guardian the Holy Spirit was sent to lead man to be the Watchman of our soul exactly right man wasn't to watch one another it was the Holy Spirit to watch we don't need some manm amen it's the Holy Spirit working through the ministry amen working in his people amen he is the guide amen yes he's our tutor our teacher the holy spirit is to teach then we C to that to the Holy Spirit looking at his things Watchman what of the nights amen so the holy spirit is the guide amen so we know we can see impending judgments on the earth because you know the quote Pastor Adan just read speaking about Los Angeles where he says could it be he said where judgment will strike right here is probably where judgment will strike that's right he said let's get ready my this will probably be the first place it will hit amen right in here oh Church hold to God unchanging hand amen amen could that be the start of what's coming on the Earth right now because the bride is coming to her maturity yes is it happening because the bride is coming to her position now the bride is ready now she's forming this pyramid city is formed now yes where she's ready to walk like Enoch amen amen amen Hall she's ready because Enoch was in the pyramid she's caught up in the shouts amen amen she she sealed up in the shout amen which is the message of the hour Enoch was in the pyramid and he walked up that seven step and he left from there am amen beautiful she is the one that's caught up now in the shout she's sealed in hallelujah amen when she's sealed in nothing can take it away from her yes amen could it be that she's already sealed in and this is the hour where she is now ready to take a flight as we see what's happening on the Earth but there must be in between that time in between that shout in between the voice there must be the quick short work yes amen there must be the season of the quick short work he said short work amen hallelujah and it's a quick work amen where the bride recognizes who she is she becomes the invisible Invincible Army amen she becomes the super Church she becomes the super race hallelujah amen when she recognizes her position yes she recognizes her part of the prophecy she now works in perfect Faith because she recognizes her part of the scripture amen yes so you find that the Cry Of The Watchman has always been echoing through all the ages God always had a messenger in every age in this age he had a messenger but there must be one who says Thou must prophesy again before Nation Tong and king that's why the prophet came and he preached Revelation 10 1-7 yes and he highlighted everything in Revelation 10 1-7 but he left out Revelation 10 8-1 amen for people yes he left it for another time yes because he knew that there will be a people that will receive that word amen there will be a people that will have representation that will believe that message that he bringing amen hallelujah it wasn't for the Pentecostal babes yes yes he was preaching among the Pentecostal babes and while he was fishing other the fish were coming in but he was fishing for that rainbow trout amen amenallah but when she comes in amen when she's the one that's coming in now she's going to be the one that will be echoing the same message out to Nations out to to individuals and they can discern the hour that they living in amen hallelujah amen and she can see now the modern day events made clear by prophecy she can see the Judgment signs she can see the sign of oncoming storms of judgment amen when the prophet threw up the rock there and he said Alaska almost sunk he said judgment didn't stop there and didn't we see from there earthquakes pestilences all the things around the world did we see rumors of walls yes then we see Matthew 24 being fulfilled amen find the world in this dark stage this L age but what he's done he brought people to be complacent the spirit of ly has gri people in such a way that people become to think that I have all I'm doing now every morning I got to wake up on the routine I just got to go to work I got to earn a living that's my life but what the Watchman is wanting to do which is the 54 minutes is showing you your position showing you your true purpose what you were placed on this Earth for why you are predestinated to live in this day why you are predestinated to live in this hour is to make a Rapture yes amen that's what you were kept for you wasn't kept in the day to be beheaded you wasn't kept in the day to be fed to the uh fighting Gladiators and fighting the FED to the Lions no you was kept for this day you was anointed for this hour and this is the hardest age because it's such a deceptive age sin everything is so complacent yes amen you you become so inre to this age am you got to work to make a living and when you are caught up in the work cycle of the system with your education system your working system that is Satan taking you away from God yes amen Satan does everything to take your time away from God take you away from your prayer life take you away from meditating upon God's word taking away from the things of God taking away from the purpose of God that's what Satan planned that is why God put Watchman in his hour to watch over you to to to make you to remind you all the time that you are you might find sometime the word is coming in repetition but the reason why it's coming repetition to remind you all the time that you are put here for a purpose you are put here because God anointed you in this hour God anointed you to be an eagle in this hour God anoint you with an eagle to overcome to fly above your circumstances not to be a slave to sin not to be a slave in Satan's eeden yes Lord amen that's why he he came and he spoke about that slave boy yes amen he his father was a king of the tribe yes and he knew and that when he leaves that place of slavery after his time and what is going to happen after his Jubilee he's going to live in the time of Jubilee at the end of his the Jubilee time Trump put blows he's going to leave slavery and he's going to go back as the King's son amen so what he did he knew now to fit into that place I got to continue as the king even though I am here yes oh yes amen did it stop Daniel in Babylon when Daniel and all was and shedrach mishak and those Hebrew boys when they they went as young boys but when they were trapped in Babylon they were trapped in the Babylonian system did it stop them from serving the one true God did it stop them from the prayer life did stop them from did they compromise they didn't compromise and bow down to any image foreign images they didn't need food sered to Idols amen because they kept all the ordinances that was given to them amen they still serve the one true God they were faithful in what they believed in so you are trapped in this latest year you are trapped in this world but you are not of this world Amen you conduct yourself as the son of the king the kingj because the Jubilee trumpet has sounded it is time that we go free to him the son of man free he free indeed amen that's why you you have the overcoming power to overcome every situation to every to overcome the fil of this world to overcome the situation where Satan wants to keep you Earthbound he wants to keep you slaving and slav and slugging for men yes and he he wants to take away your time one of the most precious Commodities that he can take from you is your time yes because we with our time it's whether we serve God or we can serve memory yes amen so there there's a responsibility on the blood of christen there's a responsibility on those that are sealed with the spirit of God Amen because our role is to Echo the warning yes of judgment upon the Earth yes amen our role is to cry and sigh for the Abominations of the Lost amen we also have an intercessory role amen amen and our role is to cry out for people to come to repentance yes Lord amen to warn the people of God's uncoming storms of judgment he said thou has prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings this is the day when the title the book has come down amen he come down to the rightful owner amen it never happened in any other age but in this day amen that's why 1963 when the when the cloud picture was taken that was the Vindication amen that was just to vindicate what was happening amen the prophet knew it wasn't for him yes that was the Vindication yes he knew what was happening he was there yes but that was the V ation and he said that's my lord of there amen amen so you find that the moral decline of people amen as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of Noah didn't Jesus speak these things yes he's giving you signs amen and we seen this we seen the moral decline of people on the Earth where sin is glorified we seeing disasters on the earth we seeing all these things we seeing all the natural disasters we seeing all these things being fulfilled we seeing Global tensions amongst Nations right now and you're going to see more to come amen but the bride must be purified before a translation and how does she get purified is through the word through the washing of the Waters of the word the bride must be puf if to the word the bride doesn't face judgment there yes she's being judged now by the word that is why a true son and daughter of God when he's chastised of the Lord he will realize God's righteous judgments God's judgment is righteous amen amen a true son and daughter of God when he's being chastized he will take the correction yes because he knows that the word is purifying him yes amen the because he's coming he's forming he has to come back to the word yes amen the the word doesn't come to you to your form no you you have to align to the word amen so that is why called for the bride must have a total separation yes from all unbelief all form Doctrine and stand firmly on the revealed words we don't compromise with the revealed words amen amen we're not going for isms we're not going for for feelings and Sensations and emotions we are going on the revealed words amen amen we anchor our faith upon the words yes Lord and the word is unchanging the word keeps a Believer consistent yes amen that's why you find a Believer True Believer doesn't be stagnant his growth is not stagnant can you imagine you got a child that doesn't grow in your home is is remaining as a baby and he's come now a 30 years old and he's calling is what okay it's like this you got a baby when the baby cries you'll run to the baby give the baby the food change the baby diapers you will do that Pentecostal babies that's why they experience those things when you come new to Christ every soon as you ask for something you're getting it but as you mature now yes amen that son and daughter was 30 years 40 years old now he can't go to the father and cry he can't be crying for food he can't be crying for clothes amen amen because he's got everything there he needs to take what was given to him and make a life for himself amen he needs to cultivate what's given to him he needs to know how to handle the father's Affairs he know how he needs to know how to handle the father's finances the father's business amen don't you aren't you supposed to be about your father's business in this hour amen amen this is the hour where the true Watchmen must blow the trumpets and call others to the safety of Christ amen when people now are running to and fro with every wind of Doctrine we need to watch out we need to call out to brothers and sisters that are chasing up to every wind of Doctrine running from to the left running to the rights shaky characters amen we are not yet to compromise with the word God gave us thust sayth the Lord amen amen this is is a unadulterated word when you feel the word is coming toward and you you take you leave the church you go to another church the word is too hard you know we leave this we leave this group we go to another group I'm talking about around the world now but a true son and daughter of God say Lord if that word is going to mold me if that word is going to shape me Lord if that word is going to make me a better person for you lord it's going to give me character Lord Oh Lord if that word is building me up to the stature of a perfect man then Lord Lord be unto me according to Thy word am amen but remember now when the Watchman is telling you about what's coming at night morning is also coming yes amen what a glorious morning that will be amen amen there's going to be a translation morning amen amen between 6 and 9 one morning yes oh there's going to be a body change oh they going to be Enoch was the type amen Noah went to the tribulation but there's people that are typing Enoch here in this hour amen that didn't face tribulation not one bomb shall fall while she's here amen nothing will happen to his wife she's going to walk into translation in this hour amen she's going to leave the oncoming storms of judgment before anything happen she's going to take a flight amen that is why you find in this hour Watchman is telling you doors are being opened amen spiritual doors are being open have spiritual have spiritual ears to Year yes amen what the word of the Lord is saying what the spirit is saying Hell is Unleashed on the earth while hell is unleash on the earth oh Heaven is on the earth the angel of God was the prophet hasn't left the Earth hallelujah amen not only the angel of God yeah all the host of angels are around us amen that's why sometime you might be bumping into Angels that's why you got to be sensitized to these things a true Watchman is going to sensitize you and tell you re be conscious of the presence of God be conscious that the Angels around you yes L thank you Father amen when you come into the church when you come into the house of God be conscious that the spirit of God is here oh and when the spirit of God is there is Liberty amen and if there's liberty in the presence of God you can shout you can jump you can shout oh you can praise God even in your circumstances maybe your bank account is empty but you praise God you say my father hold the thousand years is Jehovah my provider oh he shall open his windows of heaven and pour out his blessings upon me amen oh my cup run it over amen oh thank you Jesus amen amen so we find that this is is the hour that we living in amen gross Darkness upon the Earth but oh rise and shine he says oh thy light has come oh those seven third has come to awaken you oh that seven seal come to you he come personally to youen it wasn't a public show but that one was for you amen am under the first two pools yes it was a public show but under the third pool oh he said I'll meet you in there amen it's not for everybody it's not a public show but it's the cycle of the Rapture it was the hidden Mystery amen amen because it comes to a union with you amen and when you come into a union with him then you know that you are one with him amen and then he you are taking part of him amen you are changing to word because to get there you must change amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen we finding this hour according to revelation being being F before very eyes am yes and that's what you're going to see now because this Beast is going to exercise all the power of the first Beast before him amen you wouldn't find Rome in the front line you won't find Jersey Bell in the front line but she be manipulating the system yes this one will speak for home yes this one will speak for Jezebel amen and all the nations will'll give into it yes because why everyone want to thrive and survive amen everyone wants the economy to work yes everyone wants to have that because eventually someone got to bring that Tre to Israel yes someone you know what he said Vatican owns all the gold yes but the Jews own the bonds yes and they have to bring it together they have to get them in and they have to come by a treaty so where are we amen we have got the title deep yes we are the rightful lers of the earth yes while they're fighting for land why they fighting for economy while they're fighting for power while they fighting for gold we are the rightful HS over the Earth don't you know the righteous shall sh up the ashes of the wicked amen this Earth belongs to us amen amen but not not this world condition not this world system not Satan no he's going to take us to the unimon while he makes it a fot place when he transforms it into a foot place we will come in that Millennium Reign amen hallelu and we continue to live here he's going to make it a suitable habitation for us a suitable habitation for the bride amenu so the next step the next event to happen for this bride is the voice of the Resurrection so bride bride of Christ Watchmen are warning Watchman is saying warning you of what's coming God impending judgment on the earth Gentile doors are closing in one of these days the gospel going to go back to the Jews yes this is not the time to play church this is not the time to come to the church for religion amen Lord this is not the time to come to church to satisfy your conscience or to please your family Lord you come to church you come to the house of God because you have a purpose amen hallelujah you are predestinated for purpose God has placed you here for a purpose amen that is to fulfill the purpose that he's created for your life where he's placed you in the body of Christ he's placed you in the body amen and the body needs one another every part of the body is needed that is why if you got a true revelation of this word you only just see yourself and your and your family you will see you'll see the entire body you will work for the body you want to do things for the body of Christ amen because you know this body each one needs the other each one cannot do without the other it's an entire city it's a perit city amen hallelujah hallelujah amen s so we find that God has shown us through the scriptures and through the prophet how he chose his Watchman amen and how he chose and why he chose the Watchman to war the people of the things to come and to to get the and if the people take eat to what the Watchman says then their own fath is Judgment but if they don't take he then the blood they have to face their own consequences for it but if the Watchman also doesn't warn them then the Watchman the blood of the people will be upon the Watchman but if the Watchman warns them that the blood is not on him anymore it's between them and God so it's on themselves so when you are being one of these things that are happening on the earth and the word is warning you of this time if the word is being spoken to you in his pure form without compromising he not being Cy coed to you and if you don't take heat to it then that becomes between you and God amen amen so we find that the message of the hour that we received is to bring us into the word image amen yes into the word image that we bypass amen Jesus didn't bypass that yes and Jesus had his theophany he comes as king theophany to M to he come mzd King theophan to Abraham and then he comes in flesh form but when the body is laying in the Tomb he goes into the in the theop form he goes to the souls that are lost in prison and now part of the third pull is also preaching to the souls that are lost in prison yes amen so you'll find that right now as the message come forth we are living in the hour as the as we find that Satan is going to put all his Targets on the bride yeah in the form of a squeeze but you'll be preaching to the Souls Lost in prison you'll be preaching but they'll be lost they can't hear you because they don't have the representation because they the bride is already sealed in the door has been shut he's put you in he pulled you in and he shut the door so they can't hear his voice amen that's the hour we're living in because that's part of the third pool to preach also to the souls that are lost in prison now because they are totally separated from God yeah amen so all these things are coming upon the Earth we're going to see more things that are coming and this a closing scripture AB 21 says and I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved so let us take each of the warnings of the Watchmen in this hour the five Ministry let's align our lives with the revealed word and remain faithful until the coming of the Lord amen let's stand hallelujah amen [Applause] hry take thank you amen amen you appreciate the word of the Lord amen amen I think we ought to give the Lord a good handup of Praise amen
