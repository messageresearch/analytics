[0:00] thought that will try to exalt itself
[0:02] against the knowledge of Jesus and
[0:05] father I pray the spirit of Christ will
[0:06] move from Heart to Heart Lord searching
[0:09] out the reins of our hearts oh God
[0:10] trying to find that Abiding Place oh God
[0:12] to reproduce the life of Jesus Christ oh
[0:15] God I pray Lord that you'll come now
[0:17] father and even as the prayer requests
[0:19] have gone forth and Lord we know your
[0:20] healing power has already gone forth to
[0:22] stretch forth the hand to heal o God to
[0:24] deliver and restore we thank you for it
[0:27] in Jesus name we ask His blessings now
[0:29] amen amen I greet you all in the
[0:31] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[0:33] Jesus Christ amen our Lord and King whom
[0:36] we are looking forward to see with our
[0:39] physical eyes
[0:40] amen hallelujah amen that's how blessed
[0:44] hope and promise amen so greet you all I
[0:47] pray that you all are well and trusting
[0:49] the Lord amen looking forward to the
[0:51] coming of the Lord
[0:53] amen let's turn to Galatians chapter
[0:54] four of us uh we'll start at verse 19
[0:57] there just one
[0:59] portion of scripture there Galatians 4
[1:02] 19.
[1:06] he says my little children
[1:09] of whom I trivale
[1:12] in birth
[1:13] again
[1:15] until Christ be formed in you
[1:19] you see the faithful Ministry
[1:24] is laboring
[1:26] to bring forth the Life of Christ
[1:29] so the Apostle Paul is saying my little
[1:31] children of whom I travail in birth
[1:34] again
[1:35] until Christ be formed in you
[1:39] now you don't know what it is like on a
[1:40] minister
[1:42] amen because you as an individual all
[1:45] you have to worry about is yourself
[1:49] but to the ministry has been given
[1:51] charge over the flock of God
[1:53] and God commanded us to feed the Lambs
[1:55] and to feed the sheep
[1:58] and if you read Ephesians 4 there you'll
[2:00] see the responsibility placed upon the
[2:02] faithful Ministry to bring the body to
[2:04] perfection in the unity of Faith so
[2:07] there's a great burden upon the
[2:09] preachers
[2:10] amen upon the five-fold ministry so
[2:13] therefore we ought to be praying for the
[2:15] fivefold ministry amen and bring them
[2:17] before the Lord and never be critical
[2:20] over them but rather commit them in
[2:22] prayer before the Lord amen hallelujah
[2:25] so they are travailing in birth until
[2:27] Christ is formed in you and sometimes
[2:29] you want to continue in life your own
[2:31] way but you notice the sword is coming
[2:34] to shape you
[2:35] amen so Christ be formed in you so
[2:38] Colossians 1 27 verse 28 and 28 there
[2:41] also says
[2:44] Colossians 1 27
[2:47] to whom God would make known what is the
[2:50] riches of the glory of this mystery
[2:52] among the Gentiles
[2:55] so get his thought now there's a
[2:57] glorious mystery amongst the Gentiles
[2:59] and he does the riches of Christ and it
[3:02] this mystery is Christ in you
[3:06] the hope of glory
[3:08] and Romans 8 10 one more portion will
[3:11] just read that Romans 8 10
[3:14] and if Christ be in you
[3:17] the body is dead because of sin
[3:20] but the spirit is life because of
[3:23] righteousness
[3:24] amen and then we would just want to
[3:26] focus on what that spirit is in
[3:28] Galatians 5 22 this is the fruits of the
[3:31] spirit
[3:31] Galatians 5 22 but the fruit of the
[3:35] spirit is love
[3:36] Joy
[3:38] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[3:44] faith
[3:45] meekness and temperance
[3:48] so this is how Jesus was
[3:51] Jesus had love he had joy peace
[3:53] long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith
[3:55] meekness and Temperance amen you may be
[3:58] seated
[4:00] so
[4:02] I just want to title this in the form of
[4:04] a question
[4:06] do you have the Life of Christ
[4:09] amen it's an important question to ask
[4:12] because he'll only Unite with those that
[4:15] have his life in this time in this day
[4:18] do you have the Life of Christ
[4:22] amen hallelujah
[4:24] so the lord gave his word in the
[4:26] beginning and he's been looking for a
[4:28] woman who would believe his word
[4:33] because through the woman came to fall
[4:35] yet through another woman came the
[4:38] perfect Son of God who would be the
[4:40] perfect Lamb of God that would take away
[4:42] the sin of the world Amen and in Genesis
[4:45] 3 you'll find the first type of woman
[4:48] there and the Lord is giving a prophecy
[4:50] in Genesis 3 15 and he's telling her I'm
[4:53] going to put enmity between thee and
[4:55] between thee and the woman talking to
[4:57] the serpent now between thy seed and her
[4:59] seed now we know that the woman doesn't
[5:02] have a seed
[5:04] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[5:07] shall bruise his heel we know this is
[5:10] the first prophecy given
[5:12] about a coming savior about a coming
[5:14] Messiah
[5:16] amen hallelujah the seed of the woman
[5:20] Now watch how God never disclosed to
[5:23] Satan his plan but he put it there in
[5:26] mystery
[5:28] Satan was least expecting for a
[5:31] virgin-born woman to be a son
[5:34] [Laughter]
[5:38] for Adam to speak the word
[5:42] and Eve would have conceived
[5:48] amen so that is why if you trace the
[5:50] line he's always after the seed of God
[5:53] he's trying to get after Jacob he's
[5:55] trying to get after Joseph and he's
[5:56] trying to murder ugly lineage let me
[5:59] tell you if he killed all of them Jesus
[6:01] would have still come forth because
[6:03] Jesus didn't rely on a natural lineage
[6:09] you see how he Bluffs Satan
[6:12] he could have killed every one of them
[6:14] but Jesus came by the spoken word
[6:19] Satan got taken unawares
[6:23] amen hallelujah
[6:26] so we find the first type of woman there
[6:27] the one who just believed then we find
[6:29] another woman that we read in Genesis 18
[6:32] and even her it took a while to get her
[6:34] to believe
[6:36] she had to get away from all doubt and
[6:38] reasoning and even the Laughing within a
[6:40] heart
[6:41] and even seeing the discernment she even
[6:43] lied to God's face
[6:46] and said I did not laugh telling God I
[6:49] did not laugh
[6:52] and the prophet says that God would have
[6:54] killed her for it
[6:55] but because he already spoke the word
[6:57] and said through you shall come forth
[6:59] the promise seed and because she was a
[7:02] part of Abraham he couldn't touch her
[7:04] life
[7:06] same reason he could not kill Eve
[7:09] amen then we find in Luke 1 30 hear the
[7:13] angel of the Lord finds a woman
[7:17] and the angel tells you have found favor
[7:19] with God
[7:21] you're a different kind of woman Mary
[7:25] amen
[7:28] and he says be old Thou shalt conceive
[7:30] in thy womb and bring forth the son and
[7:32] shall call his name Jesus he shall be
[7:34] great I'm glad I have a great Jesus he
[7:38] shall be called a son of the highest
[7:40] amen and the Lord God shall give him the
[7:42] Throne of his father David and he shall
[7:44] reign over the house of Jacob of and of
[7:47] his kingdom there shall be no end then
[7:49] Mary said unto the angel how shall it be
[7:52] seeing a No-No man and the angel
[7:54] answered and said the Holy Ghost shall
[7:57] come upon thee the power of the highest
[7:59] shall overshadow thee therefore the holy
[8:01] thing which is shall be born of thee
[8:03] shall be called the son of God
[8:05] right then he reveals about John the
[8:07] Baptist and here 38 is where I want to
[8:09] get to and Mary said behold the handmaid
[8:12] of the Lord
[8:14] be it unto me according to Thy Word
[8:18] I want you to know this has been the
[8:19] response of you and I when we heard the
[8:22] message of the hour we didn't reason
[8:24] with the prophet's word
[8:26] everything that he said we said be down
[8:28] to me
[8:30] now one reason with the word which was
[8:33] Eve one had to be convinced after she
[8:36] left within herself before she believed
[8:38] but like we said Mary was another type
[8:40] of a woman she was a pure virgin woman
[8:42] who believed the Angel's word as soon as
[8:45] she heard it
[8:46] and that's the kind of response God
[8:48] wants from his bride
[8:51] now from all the women God could have
[8:53] chosen to write a letter to or type us
[8:57] to when he's writing a letter to the
[8:58] bride
[9:00] remember one night the prophet
[9:03] has
[9:05] a vision or the Lord tells him pick up
[9:07] your pen and write
[9:09] of all the women
[9:13] he types Mary
[9:15] let's read that a bit he says then the
[9:17] harmony of the father and son Jesus
[9:19] never did anything until it was first
[9:21] showed to him by the father
[9:23] he's saying that for a point to show you
[9:25] that the harmony is now to exist between
[9:27] the groom and his bride
[9:30] because what kind of a home would it be
[9:33] if the husband and wife are not in
[9:35] harmony
[9:37] it would be a chaotic home
[9:40] amen
[9:42] he shows uh his Word of Life she
[9:45] receives it
[9:46] now what is the word what is a seed
[9:50] she receives it she never doubts it not
[9:52] like Eve therefore nothing can hammer
[9:58] not even death
[10:03] amen for if the seed be planted the
[10:06] water will raise it up again
[10:09] now here is the secret of it the word is
[10:12] in the bride as it was in
[10:14] Mary
[10:16] not as it was in Eve
[10:18] not as it was in Sarah
[10:21] the word is in the bride as it was in
[10:24] Mary
[10:26] the bride is the mind of Christ for she
[10:29] knows what he once done with the word
[10:32] Mary knew what he wanted done with the
[10:34] word
[10:37] amen
[10:39] Hallelujah
[10:40] she performs the command of the Lord in
[10:43] his name for she has thus said the Lord
[10:50] I'm waiting for a prophetic Prophet to
[10:53] come along and and Proclaim that said
[10:55] the Lord who has thus saved the Lord
[11:01] some are waiting for a return Ministry
[11:04] some are studying the messages and
[11:06] typing out that's it the Lord
[11:12] she performs the command of the Lord in
[11:14] his name for who has thou said the Lord
[11:17] somebody say hi
[11:20] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[11:22] that's the Holy Spirit and it comes to
[11:24] pass
[11:26] so that is why we should never lay
[11:28] around around idly in this time and in
[11:30] this season
[11:31] God has commissioned us to go forward
[11:34] some people are waiting for the portals
[11:35] of Heaven to open and God to audibly
[11:38] speak to them when she's already been
[11:40] given that said to the Lord
[11:45] like a seed that is planted and watered
[11:47] it comes to full of us serving its
[11:50] purpose
[11:51] amen now we've got to serve our purpose
[11:53] right he says they in the bride do only
[11:55] his will no one can make them do
[11:57] otherwise they have thus said the Lord
[11:59] or they keep still now didn't he just
[12:01] tell us we have that saith the Lord so
[12:03] we can't keep still
[12:07] hello
[12:10] a lot of people quote this part
[12:14] you know why they don't have that said
[12:15] the Lord they are backslidden in the
[12:18] message
[12:19] they have settled for the religion of
[12:21] the message
[12:23] they are no better than the scribes and
[12:26] the Pharisees who believe said we have
[12:28] Moses as our prophet we have a bunch of
[12:31] them today
[12:32] we have Branham as our Prophet but no
[12:35] Life of Christ
[12:38] same Pharisee you know something when
[12:40] men die
[12:42] let me just put it this way for you
[12:44] when Holy Ghost filled men die
[12:47] what happens to the Holy Ghost
[12:50] it's waiting to fill more people
[12:55] hello
[12:57] you believe Holy Ghost fooled me and die
[13:01] it's the same way in the other way when
[13:05] men die with demon spirits or demon
[13:08] Spirits get cast out of men they're
[13:10] looking for new bodies to dwell
[13:12] right
[13:14] so the Holy Spirit wants to move in a
[13:17] body of people
[13:20] and the Holy Spirit is a
[13:23] gentlemen
[13:27] amen so they have that saith the Lord
[13:29] and we can't be like the scribes and
[13:31] Pharisees because my point was when
[13:34] those scribes and Pharisees dies where
[13:36] did that Spirit go to those Spirits are
[13:39] still alive on the Earth
[13:40] and that's the worst kind of spirit the
[13:42] religious spirit
[13:46] amen
[13:47] some people are so holy they can't even
[13:49] swallow their own spit
[13:56] we've seen it right through the years
[14:00] amen
[14:02] so he says they know that it has to be
[14:05] God in them doing the works so we don't
[14:07] get puffed up
[14:08] we remain humble it's God in us doing
[14:11] the works
[14:12] amen fulfilling his own word he did not
[14:15] complete all his work while in his
[14:18] Earthly Ministry
[14:19] so now he works in and through the bride
[14:24] some are watching it
[14:26] like they're eating popcorn and the what
[14:27] they want to see other people perform
[14:29] signs Miracles wonders
[14:32] they want to be entertained
[14:35] in the message of the hour
[14:38] they don't want to become a co-worker
[14:40] with the Holy Ghost
[14:42] so they want to be entertained
[14:45] amen
[14:48] she knows that for it was not yet time
[14:50] for him to do certain things that he
[14:52] must do now
[14:55] some would have liked to have read that
[14:57] another way some would have liked the
[14:58] prophet to phrase that another way
[15:00] some would have liked him to say it's
[15:02] not your time for him to do certain
[15:04] things
[15:07] but that's not what he's saying do you
[15:09] know many people read that quote that
[15:11] way
[15:12] he's saying it was not your time for him
[15:15] to do certain things that he must do now
[15:21] but he will now fulfill through the
[15:27] but the bride keeps saying he did it
[15:29] through the prophet he did it through
[15:30] the prophet he did it to the prophet
[15:32] last 60 years they've been singing that
[15:34] song
[15:37] but what is the prophet saying he'll do
[15:39] it through who
[15:41] so the bride is singing he'll do it
[15:43] through the Prophet The Prophet is
[15:44] saying he'll do it through the bride
[15:46] what's going on
[15:51] that they are saying say what the tape
[15:53] says
[15:55] but I'm saying what the tapes is yes and
[15:58] he is saying you'll do it through the
[15:59] bride
[16:02] the work that he had left for a specific
[16:06] time
[16:07] for which specific time this specific
[16:10] time
[16:14] amen hallelujah
[16:16] now he says yeah the true bride she's
[16:18] already predestinated to take the place
[16:21] I'm not here because of my own choosing
[16:23] God chose me to be here you can't
[16:26] silence me neither can I silence you we
[16:29] both have a voice and we are the final
[16:30] voice to the final age
[16:32] when Christ comes to his bride she will
[16:34] be a virgin like Mary was
[16:37] when Christ the word comes to the bride
[16:39] shall be same as he is a Virgin by the
[16:41] word should be the same product that he
[16:43] is Virgin
[16:47] she is part of him she needs no Dogma
[16:49] she won't have any she's absolutely
[16:52] Virgin by the word she'll punctuate
[16:54] every word of God within
[16:58] oh be it according unto me be to unto me
[17:02] according to Thy word she'll have a
[17:04] virgin whom what is she made of a virgin
[17:06] whom what did Jesus come out of a virgin
[17:09] whom amen hallelujah
[17:12] praise the Lord amen now the bride is
[17:15] not pursuing own vision and Christ
[17:17] pursuing another vision
[17:20] the eye is single their mind is single
[17:24] amen the vision the purpose is the
[17:27] second full mystery where Christ is
[17:29] having the preeminence in his bride
[17:32] amen without Jesus we have no vision
[17:37] and if we have no vision we have no
[17:39] purpose amen so we tap into the vision
[17:41] of God and we come God's provided way in
[17:44] this time
[17:45] we come to Jesus and amen and he gives
[17:48] us a vision
[17:49] he gives us a vision for our lives he
[17:52] gives us a vision for his word
[17:56] amen
[17:59] Jesus did not lose his vision at 12
[18:02] years old he had a vision
[18:05] and he said I must be about my father's
[18:07] business
[18:08] amen hallelujah
[18:11] the father's business was Jesus purpose
[18:17] at 30 years old he comes to the prophet
[18:20] John in the water to be baptized and
[18:22] John feeling unworthy says Lord I need
[18:24] to be baptized of you but Jesus knew
[18:27] that his vision and his purpose must be
[18:29] fulfilled and the word must come to pass
[18:31] so he says suffer it to be so now for
[18:34] thus it becomes us to fulfill all
[18:36] righteousness
[18:38] so we are never to lose our vision
[18:41] don't lose our vision of Jesus
[18:43] keep our eyes ever on him many friends
[18:47] and dear loved ones have lost their way
[18:49] they have lost the vision of him
[18:52] amen hallelujah
[18:55] now Jesus
[18:57] oh
[18:58] Jesus
[19:01] did he just say we if you go back to
[19:03] that slide there we are like Jesus
[19:06] did he say we are like Jesus we are part
[19:09] of him
[19:10] we have the same attributes amen then
[19:13] let me tell you about Jesus
[19:16] the blind came to Jesus and they went
[19:18] away with perfect eyesight
[19:23] the sick came to Jesus and the winter
[19:25] were healed
[19:28] it was a slide before brother killed
[19:30] amen
[19:32] the came to him and they went
[19:34] away walking
[19:39] if you came to Jesus and leper
[19:45] if you came to Jesus a leper you went to
[19:47] a cleansed
[19:49] amen
[19:51] this is I'm talking about the Life of
[19:52] Christ do you have the Life of Christ
[19:58] even they brought to him woman caught in
[20:00] the act of adultery
[20:04] they went away with sins forgiven but
[20:06] people come to us and they live more
[20:08] condemned
[20:14] if you come to him dead
[20:18] You Went Away alive
[20:23] amen
[20:26] that's our lord Jesus
[20:29] amen the Mighty God not even death could
[20:32] hold down his own body
[20:34] even when he was dead in the flesh he
[20:37] was fulfilling his vision and he was
[20:38] doing a work in his theory of any body
[20:41] he went to the regions of the lost and
[20:44] he preached to the souls that were in
[20:45] prison he emptied out paradise
[20:48] amen and on the third day when his
[20:51] ministry beyond the grave was complete
[20:53] the spirit of God raised him up again
[20:55] he came back in a glorified body this
[20:58] was a glorious body one that can't be
[21:00] crucified one that cannot die a body
[21:03] that can pass through walls amen
[21:05] hallelujah a body that can change
[21:07] dimensions and when our lord Jesus comes
[21:09] back again we are told that when we see
[21:12] him we shall have a body like his own
[21:14] glorious body
[21:16] amen amen many many men glory be to his
[21:21] name so we are exactly like our Lord
[21:23] Jesus Christ
[21:25] the only thing we are short of right now
[21:27] is our new body
[21:31] amen
[21:32] that's how a life should be the only
[21:34] thing we are short of is our new body
[21:38] amen
[21:41] Yahweh and slide six now
[21:43] then if God does anything in the church
[21:45] it'll be original back with the word
[21:47] again
[21:48] because the life
[21:50] that's in the tree has to obey its own
[21:52] kind
[21:52] and Jesus wants fruit for himself his
[21:55] wife must bring forth the kind of
[21:57] children that he is
[21:59] bright children were children
[22:06] amen we must produce this is an Rapture
[22:08] message now
[22:10] Jesus once who reproduce his life
[22:12] through you
[22:15] how many of you have fertile ground
[22:18] amen let's not be Barren or unfruitful
[22:21] now Jesus comes to sow his seed his word
[22:23] into you through the message of the hour

[27:21] that
[27:22] you say brother Branham I spoke in
[27:24] tongues that's good but that's still not
[27:26] what I'm asking
[27:28] you say brother Brandon I never armed
[27:29] anybody that's not what I'm asking about
[27:33] is the Life of Christ in you

[27:54] brother how do I get the life brother
[27:56] Branham he's going to tell you he takes
[27:58] death to yourself
[28:00] to develop the picture of the image of
[28:02] Christ
[28:03] The Life of Christ in you you have to
[28:06] dump your own out so that Christ can
[28:08] come in you have to die to yourself
[28:12] how many of you want to say Kill Me Lord
[28:14] oh yes Lord kill all my fleshly desires
[28:17] kill my worldly desires Lord and let
[28:19] Christ live in me
[28:24] he says I would rather have the Life of
[28:26] Christ in me to live sweet and
[28:28] Victorious than I would have than I
[28:30] would all the gifts of healing
[28:32] the gift of Prophecy
[28:34] all them other gifts Just Give Me Jesus
[28:38] to be like Jesus Hallelujah
[28:43] give me the Life of Christ
[28:46] let me live the life the life is what I
[28:48] want to live I want to live so others
[28:51] will know
[28:52] that's my desire at Christmas I pray
[28:54] that your desire and I pray God would
[28:57] give us this desire
[29:01] amen
[29:04] The Life of Christ is in the church
[29:06] vindicating his word that's how God was
[29:09] in the earth in the form of Jesus being
[29:11] the word to make the word live
[29:15] that should be our desire Lord whatever
[29:17] portion of the word you have for me I
[29:19] want to make it live and the Holy Spirit
[29:21] is today in flesh making the word of God
[29:24] live to every promise and every wonder
[29:27] and everything is Promised it's there
[29:31] it's in the word
[29:33] and the word wants to be expressed
[29:34] through you
[29:37] know so
[29:39] amen we ought to be asking ourselves
[29:44] do I have the Life of Christ
[29:46] amen
[29:48] do I have the Life of Christ
[29:55] amen amen
[29:58] amen is it evident now we know that
[30:01] eternal life is living for others
[30:04] amen
[30:06] and Jesus came to give us
[30:08] eternal life
[30:10] so life should be lived serving others
[30:15] our life should be lived for others
[30:18] Amen in fact the world is craving
[30:22] and looking
[30:24] for somebody who's christ-like
[30:28] you know you can do it in your daily
[30:30] lives you can stretch forth your hand
[30:33] to have somebody in need
[30:35] amen
[30:37] you can stretch forth your hand to touch
[30:39] somebody to speak to somebody
[30:42] to comfort them with the word
[30:44] amen so the question that we ask have
[30:48] you
[30:49] got the Life of Christ
[30:52] now the Life of Christ
[30:56] it's not something you can be an
[30:57] undercover agent
[30:59] that we have to guess whether you have
[31:01] the Life of Christ
[31:03] because brother Branham says you give me
[31:04] a few minutes
[31:06] in that person's company
[31:08] I'll tell you what kind of a spirit they
[31:10] have
[31:11] amen
[31:13] there's some people that you feel very
[31:15] uneasy
[31:17] because you know you can run fellowship
[31:19] with them
[31:20] that spirit is not connecting
[31:22] but there's some brothers you can you
[31:24] can just click and you connecting with
[31:26] the word and you can speak and and time
[31:27] is going then you got to really cut
[31:29] yourself off and say brother I've got
[31:31] other things to do or you know what amen
[31:34] you get so engrossed
[31:37] because that's an eagle connecting with
[31:39] eagle
[31:40] amen hallelujah and that is why I love
[31:42] it when the prophet says you know when
[31:43] we get to the other side I'll talk to
[31:46] this brother and then a thousand years
[31:47] he's gone
[31:49] amen and he says we just got started
[31:52] amen and then it's then you saw somebody
[31:54] else there now you saw Sean they now you
[31:56] have to running or talk to Sean
[31:59] okay you saw sister you saw sister
[32:01] Maggie now you've got lots of stories
[32:03] hey
[32:04] sister Karen after church assistant now
[32:07] she ended up with three children
[32:09] leave that we have to explain to my
[32:11] father
[32:15] amen but what a time that will be
[32:18] amen what a glorious time don't miss it
[32:20] for anything but the thing required is
[32:23] the Life of Christ The Life of Christ we
[32:25] know amen comes by three stages the
[32:28] fourth stage is the final product but
[32:30] it's Amen justification sanctification
[32:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which
[32:34] brings us into the formed word image
[32:37] which is the Life of Christ backing us
[32:39] now that's where I'm going to stop and
[32:40] I'm going to hand it over to some of the
[32:42] brothers here who's going to come and
[32:43] encourage you you ask me who you know
[32:46] who you are
[32:48] because as the spirit gives utterance
[32:50] man praise the Lord
[33:01] for Lord and Savior Jesus Christ tonight
[33:03] and not strange enough I was just
[33:05] thinking today
[33:07] that I was wanted to say to pastor we
[33:10] should have a special day to like praise
[33:12] worship and testimonies must come forth
[33:15] but I see the Lord has just told him
[33:18] like you know just come forth now you
[33:20] know beyond
[33:21] you know the soldiers always have to be
[33:24] prepared amen amen we have to be
[33:26] prepared We Are Soldiers of the Cross we
[33:27] People Prayed Amen to give a testimony
[33:30] to praise the name of the Lord and to
[33:32] not to be ashamed of his of him amen any
[33:35] time any place anywhere Brahm says we
[33:38] can defeat the Devil any place any time
[33:40] anywhere amen so we are more than
[33:43] conquerors amen and I'm so privileged
[33:45] and I'm so thankful for this message
[33:47] amen because this not only this message
[33:50] has brought me
[33:51] but it's kept me amen
[33:54] you can be in the valley you can be in
[33:56] the mountain he's still the same God

[34:00] resurrect you he's the one that can
[34:02] uplift you he's the one that increase
[34:03] your faith increase your desire increase
[34:06] your love for him brother I've noticed
[34:08] something I'm I'm this is my my heart
[34:11] saying I'm telling you that God knows my
[34:13] heart
[34:14] you know ever since sister Maggie passed
[34:17] away
[34:19] I haven't been so much closer than what
[34:22] I was to the Lord yes now
[34:25] you know
[34:27] I I
[34:29] sleep I get up
[34:32] word
[34:34] I'm serious and you know this is the
[34:36] amazing thing at last night I was up to
[34:39] late so I was reading a message and I
[34:41] want to encourage every one of you
[34:44] they'll
[34:45] the message entitled the 11th
[34:47] commandment
[34:49] and you know what and these the message
[34:52] contains testimonies about different
[34:56] different people and you know and the
[35:00] amazing thing it was you know I was
[35:02] battling my legs knees and joints and
[35:06] you know I'm trusting the Lord I'm
[35:08] believing I'm I'm you know there's
[35:10] there's I cannot be moved
[35:14] my feet is so much anchored in that I
[35:16] cannot be moved my children can testify
[35:18] to that
[35:20] and you know
[35:22] I spoke to Pastor Eden last week I could
[35:25] feel
[35:26] there's a change in my body I'm serious
[35:29] I'm being I'm here and I'm keep on
[35:31] saying Thank You Lord thank you Lord
[35:32] thank you Lord so why why I'm bringing
[35:35] that point out I asked Bridge Jefferson
[35:38] last week to call me to give a testimony
[35:40] our thing is forgotten forgive you
[35:43] brother right so now but I know but you
[35:47] know what God had a purpose for that
[35:48] because
[35:49] Pastor Adrian came in the end and
[35:52] I figured what what happened but it
[35:54] coincided with what I was what I was to
[35:58] share
[35:59] you know God is not the author of
[36:01] confusion he knows when to put you on
[36:03] the spot and when not to put you so
[36:05] don't worry brother it's fine
[36:08] I had
[36:09] don't worry it's fine so anyway I've
[36:13] sent uh sent a clip of two pages from
[36:16] last night page 21 22 of that same
[36:19] message
[36:20] and look at what we have does say the
[36:23] Lord does say it the Lord
[36:26] so so we can find many disputes about
[36:30] just say the Lord but I want to tell you
[36:32] something
[36:34] this message is real
[36:37] and I'll tell you why because our 17
[36:40] year old boy
[36:42] I read them a problem with the South
[36:44] African and I lived in a shack
[36:47] chandolo right but look at where the
[36:50] Lord took me out from and pass Aiden
[36:52] preached if you look at how the Lord has
[36:54] blessed us
[36:55] physically materially and whatever
[36:58] and at the current moment now my
[37:01] business is
[37:02] I just can't cope
[37:05] I just can't cope I'm serious I just I
[37:07] just can't cope I'm going home late and
[37:10] then the children asked me what happened
[37:11] Dad you go home later I said no I'm busy
[37:13] but anyway but what I'm bringing a point
[37:16] into uh to say please read that message
[37:20] if you are battling with a sickness if
[37:22] you are badly you know the
[37:25] healing is a process medical happens
[37:27] instantly all right so while I was
[37:30] reading this now and I was thinking you
[37:33] know Lord leclastic I felt you know my
[37:35] knee was like like some operation is
[37:38] going through my knees you know and I
[37:41] don't know whether some of y'all might
[37:42] notice like I sometimes put my one hand
[37:43] on my chin stand up and whatever but
[37:46] that's beside the point but last night
[37:48] when I started to read that
[37:51] there was one incident similar to mine
[37:53] now it says you know what
[37:55] there's a lady that's giving the
[37:57] Testament in the and the neighbor of us
[37:59] tried to put a doubt in him but
[38:03] it's then the prophetology you know what
[38:05] this is how it's gonna that healing is
[38:07] going to take place the tissue is gonna
[38:09] like grow in stages
[38:12] you know things are going to grow and
[38:14] say so what I'm saying to you tonight
[38:16] if you are believing God for a miracle
[38:18] yes
[38:19] hold on to that
[38:21] amen hold on as Jacob held on yes he
[38:24] wrestled with God you Resolute him and
[38:26] you say Lord you put your Yankee your
[38:28] feet in him and said Lord this is that
[38:30] this is your word yes you know like
[38:32] passage in all this is
[38:34] God said did you said it God is not man
[38:36] that he should lie and God will not say
[38:38] something today and change it tomorrow
[38:40] it's not like us
[38:42] instead fast so what I'm what I'm what
[38:45] I'm saying to you and I I'm say I said
[38:47] it to a lot of people in the message go
[38:49] and read that book and I don't know why
[38:50] because and that book has the unusual
[38:52] color of the cover too so you won't miss
[38:54] it it's uh like
[38:57] turquoise and red stripe but go and find
[39:00] that book
[39:01] because
[39:02] he's going to encourage you so if you
[39:05] want a new artist it's there if you are
[39:07] new limbs it's there so whatever you
[39:10] need you know those testimonies will
[39:12] encourage one of you and I believe the
[39:14] Lord has already done a finished work
[39:16] amen praise the Lord amen
[39:27] praise the name of Jesus Amen
[39:32] how many of you believe this we are
[39:34] entered the season of the Greater Works
[39:39] amen John 14 12.
[39:41] this is the season
[39:43] this is the hour you you read the code
[39:45] there a specific time yes you have to
[39:48] see it for your time it was stored up
[39:50] remember when the prophet was preaching
[39:52] he's preaching to a mixed crowd
[39:56] but there was no bride at that time he's
[39:58] preaching for a future time yes and that
[40:01] is why it was the the food had to be
[40:04] stored up
[40:05] and in a time of famine
[40:07] Amen in a time of famine this food was
[40:11] now Unleashed but it's not for everybody
[40:14] it's for a special class of people
[40:17] now this is nothing to do with you and I
[40:19] now
[40:19] when when God when Mary was chosen the
[40:23] first time
[40:25] right
[40:26] she said she said to Gabriel the Angel
[40:28] Beat unto me according to Thy word he
[40:32] doesn't take anything of her he didn't
[40:34] take anything of any human being the
[40:36] complete embryo was formed in it yes
[40:38] so if it happened to Mary then
[40:41] then in this virgin bride yes who have
[40:44] now received the word is nothing to do
[40:46] with air
[40:49] amen the complete Life of Christ formed
[40:51] in US
[40:52] when you receive when you Avail yourself
[40:55] to say beat unto me when you believe the
[40:57] word that's coming this day be it unto
[40:59] me Lord according to Thy word when you
[41:02] believe that word for your day
[41:04] the complete work was formed in you
[41:07] amen and then when it's formed in you
[41:10] what happened it must start to show on
[41:12] the outside amen there comes a time when
[41:15] you're going to meet your cousin when
[41:17] you're going to meet Elizabeth amen that
[41:20] babe that was dead in there leap for Joy
[41:23] when she heard the name of Jesus and the
[41:26] name of Jesus is through who the Bride
[41:28] of Jesus Christ
[41:29] because she becomes the final voice so
[41:33] he's a resurrected Jesus that's in this
[41:35] bride that now your cousin Elizabeth's
[41:39] gonna hear and the baby the life that
[41:40] was in it the Holy Ghost will come up in
[41:42] her
[41:44] amen we are the reflectors of Christ in
[41:47] this hour
[41:49] amen so I was going to work one of these
[41:51] days
[41:52] I think a few weeks ago and I said Lord
[41:55] how can I change how can I be a person
[41:57] to change things around
[42:00] because we we are preaching these things
[42:02] we must be the reflectors of Christ we
[42:04] must have a positive energy within us
[42:07] because the the word is you know the
[42:09] life is in US so we have life we must
[42:11] speak life
[42:12] you must change situations around so I
[42:15] walked into the first person's office
[42:16] and we started to speak and I use
[42:19] whatever opportunity I can Shadow when
[42:21] you when you got the word in you you can
[42:23] you can use any situ any conversation to
[42:25] turn it to Christ amen so anyway before
[42:28] we know it it came into this and I
[42:30] started taking to this person to the
[42:32] things that God is doing in this day God
[42:34] has been doing Through the Ages and
[42:36] where we are now
[42:38] and this person got so engrossed in the
[42:40] conversation take him to you know the
[42:42] true baptism the the church ages where
[42:45] we are and all that
[42:46] foreign
[42:55] come come take over this is this is
[42:58] where I am now
[42:59] hey you got excited now here this
[43:01] thing's happening and he said Denise
[43:03] what what was he what he spoke about
[43:06] he started to say this very brother
[43:07] that's speaking to you now let me share
[43:09] my testimony
[43:10] how I started to believe this truth now
[43:13] so he started to share the East part so
[43:15] you see what I'm saying we have all this
[43:17] within us
[43:19] but this is the hour of the Greater
[43:21] Works this is the hour where we can't be
[43:24] silent we can't be still
[43:26] how can you be the final voice
[43:28] in this final age how can you be the one
[43:30] that must prophesy again but you keep
[43:32] still we can't keep still
[43:35] there was a time for keeping still
[43:36] because when we had to go study and pray
[43:39] and it was a time and we had it in the
[43:41] start of the Season we had ever time of
[43:43] consecration
[43:44] going back to the altar going back
[43:46] consecrating our life time for prayer
[43:48] but it's now the time to prophesy again
[43:51] Hallelujah we're carrying an anointing
[43:54] yes
[43:55] yes you you might because you become
[43:57] accustomed to it you don't realize it
[43:59] but when you're going and facing people
[44:01] that are abound
[44:02] you might be speaking a few nuggets
[44:06] but when you're speaking
[44:08] because you are you're getting life
[44:09] within you
[44:10] when you're speaking the circumstance of
[44:13] spiritual debt
[44:14] they feel convicted there's something
[44:17] that they feel around you they feel an
[44:18] atmosphere around you
[44:20] like amongst you and I we it become
[44:22] common to us but amongst them that are
[44:25] not would have not received as words of
[44:28] life
[44:29] he's not coming to them
[44:31] so when you're speaking you're changing
[44:33] atmospheres
[44:34] you're changing the circumstances around
[44:36] you're changing people's circumstances
[44:39] people are bound
[44:40] because when you talk about love that's
[44:42] love
[44:43] when you have the love for and you see
[44:45] people bound and you know that the enemy
[44:47] is bound him and you know that people
[44:49] are evolved in religion the church world
[44:51] have bound them religion abound them
[44:53] dogmas increase the bound him
[44:56] and you have such a compassion because
[44:58] you know these people are trapped in the
[44:59] system
[45:00] but you have words of life amen amen
[45:03] they can break every barrier it's
[45:05] anointing that will break the anointing
[45:07] that will break the Yoke of bondage
[45:09] amen so we're speaking about the
[45:12] anointing now so when are we talking
[45:14] about the Life of Christ that was the
[45:15] topic today but I'm talking about
[45:16] carrying the anointing yeah so Jefferson
[45:19] I was in quarter was it Monday in court
[45:22] we were in court on Monday so we were
[45:24] having this case so the client was
[45:25] chatting telecasts right there
[45:27] apparently I left a USB in one of the
[45:30] cars that I was using it worked and the
[45:33] people at work they were they were using
[45:34] my car they took my car and I didn't
[45:36] know my USB was there
[45:38] and and a person was very upset very
[45:40] upset with things at work and they were
[45:42] in a very very bad mood from the time
[45:43] they left the office
[45:44] but when they started to drive the car
[45:46] and they put the music on and they
[45:49] annoyed they felt this anointing through
[45:51] the music and everything was soothing I
[45:53] said no it's not just the music the
[45:55] persons that were driving the car was
[45:57] carrying the anointing you're using the
[45:59] car that I was using
[46:01] and if we are using something to be
[46:03] carrying an anointing with us
[46:05] amen then when I left this person called
[46:07] me the client called me and said you
[46:08] know what ew when you left you know
[46:10] there's something about your brother
[46:11] he's telling me my brother now he said
[46:13] your brother is getting an anointing and
[46:15] he's saying uh you know he's talking
[46:16] about he's talking about the word and
[46:18] even one person was speaking in court
[46:19] they were overheard him talking and they
[46:21] came and he started correcting them with
[46:22] the word and he was talking about his
[46:24] William Branham and he's saying you know
[46:27] he said you know your brother is so into
[46:30] the word that's what I'm saying the
[46:32] people they don't have these things that
[46:34] we have
[46:35] we need to realize what we have what
[46:37] we're caring
[46:38] we're carrying some we we're carrying
[46:41] such a blessing from God
[46:44] and we have all of this all of the
[46:46] things that are given to us but now much
[46:48] is required unto much is given much is
[46:52] required the world want to see Jesus
[46:53] they're crying out for Jesus
[46:56] but they're being deceived they cannot
[46:58] see Jesus
[46:59] they want to see Jesus there's people
[47:01] bound they know the only time they can
[47:03] get up is to Jesus
[47:04] and they want to see the Jesus of the
[47:06] Bible yes and there's only one group of
[47:09] people on the Earth right now that can
[47:12] give them the demonstration of the power
[47:14] of the Gospel of the resurrected Jesus
[47:17] and that is the bride of Christ God
[47:20] richly bless you
[47:21] [Applause]
[47:43] praise the Lord amen
[47:47] hallelujah you've been blessed amen
[47:51] glory

[47:57] I'm going like a tortoise
[48:00] but praise the Lord the fire is still
[48:02] burning
[48:03] the fire is still burning
[48:05] you know
[48:07] what we hear here week after week I want
[48:11] to tell you it's all lining up
[48:15] if you if you want to wait for the
[48:17] prophet
[48:18] is not coming
[48:21] he's not coming
[48:23] he left you
[48:25] with that food
[48:27] he left you with that word and that word
[48:30] must be carried by the bride
[48:33] and nobody else
[48:36] nobody else will carry that the bride
[48:38] will ride this Trail one more time
[48:41] and you know what we're seeing
[48:44] what we're seeing is unbelievable
[48:47] but it's real
[48:49] it's real
[48:51] do not be despondent yes
[48:54] do not be despondent you're carrying
[48:57] that word
[48:58] you know I never stopped I don't know
[49:00] why people are afraid of telling the
[49:03] people that you believe a message for
[49:05] the end time
[49:07] you believe a prophet yes his name is
[49:09] William Branham why are you afraid
[49:13] if you're afraid get off the bus
[49:17] get off the bus if the bus is too fast
[49:19] take the train
[49:22] this is what's happening
[49:24] we are being encouraged
[49:26] don't worry about anything when you come
[49:28] to church just pray and say Lord speak
[49:31] to me
[49:33] not to my neighbor
[49:35] we miss the people
[49:37] we were on we were unfortunate that we
[49:40] didn't have the latest uh what you call
[49:43] uh technology
[49:45] we had to read till two in the morning
[49:47] three in the morning preach at 10
[49:49] o'clock
[49:51] you see
[49:52] but we thank God
[49:54] you see God had to bring it in time
[49:57] he brought the tape recorder
[49:59] then he brought the other things and
[50:02] then he brought this why it's a season
[50:05] it's moving from one stage to the next
[50:07] stage like they had a buggy and horse a
[50:10] car then we went to plane now you're
[50:12] going to the moon so

[50:57] sleep because he said he'll give his
[50:59] children good sleep

[54:20] and you know
[54:21] other people looked and there was guys
[54:23] there was some of the municipal workers
[54:25] sitting outside they all looked they
[54:27] said alfundis you know
[54:30] you see what you're carrying
[54:32] you don't know you're carrying a
[54:34] dynamite
[54:36] you can explode anytime
[54:38] you never be afraid never be ashamed to
[54:42] preach this gospel never be ashamed to
[54:44] pray for somebody
[54:46] you know my brother-in-law was going
[54:47] through us some other times
[54:50] you know he's old
[54:53] and it's also like
[54:55] a little bit of uh you know he got he
[54:58] got some little bit of passion and stuff
[55:00] like that so it's been through a little
[55:02] hard time
[55:03] and I just prayed
[55:06] I said Lord just help him
[55:08] and I told him you know what just phone
[55:10] your daughter-in-law
[55:12] and I left
[55:14] when I left he's got no phones
[55:19] he's not into the phones and speaks to
[55:21] him but I told him he must phone his
[55:23] daughter-in-law but you see what
[55:24] happened there
[55:25] God knew his need
[55:28] he didn't have air time he was going to
[55:30] buy airtime
[55:32] but God didn't allow me to buy the
[55:34] airtime because he knew his need and his
[55:36] need was prayed for
[55:39] let us not stop there my brother my
[55:41] sister I want to tell you this God is
[55:43] great
[55:45] you see
[55:47] when the when the Israelites left
[55:50] when the Israelites left Egypt
[55:52] they never came the one that disrupted
[55:56] the whole thing from outside the camp
[55:59] they came from within the camp
[56:02] detail and Cora came from within the
[56:04] camp
[56:06] never come from outside
[56:08] when he came to Jesus
[56:10] Judas was in the camp
[56:12] you never come from outside
[56:14] in Paul's time what uh Armenia said
[56:18] philidius was in the camp going around
[56:21] preaching the other side of the Gospel
[56:24] and yeah now we got the all in the camp
[56:28] so it's not going to come from outside
[56:29] don't take the wheat and tears and put
[56:31] it outside it's here
[56:34] so when you hear in the gospel receive
[56:36] it
[56:37] take it take it and swallow it when you
[56:40] give John the book when John took the
[56:43] book he ate it
[56:45] now you take the word and eat it
[56:48] and you can become a new creature you
[56:51] can be somebody that is carrying this
[56:53] dynamite and walking around let me tell
[56:55] you something this message is not dead
[56:59] let us raise this Banner
[57:01] it is better of love and let us carry it
[57:04] onwards Christian Soldiers marching as
[57:07] to war with the cross of Jesus going on
[57:10] before us
[57:11] so we shouldn't be anyway nobody should
[57:14] intimidate us
[57:16] whenever you go around when you talk
[57:17] about this word sit down and try and
[57:19] give somebody something I've been doing
[57:21] that all my life
[57:23] and I even said the Lord when I was in
[57:26] hospital I told him Lord you give me
[57:29] back you take me back or take me home if
[57:32] you haven't finished if you have a
[57:34] purpose you leave me here and I'll
[57:36] continue
[57:37] and they never stopped
[57:39] although in my sick bed I was still
[57:42] ministering to the people
[57:44] and I want you to know that God will not
[57:47] leave you he will stand by your side you
[57:50] know what there is one thing I always
[57:52] said Lord if this cancer if this cancer
[57:56] came from wherever it came it must go
[57:59] back
[58:00] a month three weeks ago I had a test I
[58:04] think I put it out in a prayer warriors
[58:06] grew in the group
[58:08] and this is the final test
[58:11] I mean they gave me that test I was
[58:14] almost finished
[58:15] because that I think that medication
[58:17] didn't agree to me I thought I was going
[58:19] to die
[58:20] I couldn't breathe
[58:22] but
[58:24] anyway I got stabilized and something
[58:27] and I went home
[58:30] I said Lord
[58:31] this thing yeah

[58:36] and then I'm thinking hey three days
[58:38] gone four days gone doctor number four

[59:10] guy phoning I don't know his number he's

[59:19] I've got good news for you
[59:22] I got good news for you
[59:25] and he said
[59:26] there's nothing
[59:28] we can't find nothing
[59:31] I said all your blood results are all
[59:34] clear
[59:35] your MRI is clear
[59:37] he said we won't see you until another
[59:39] one year we see you next year he said in
[59:43] January you do a blood test we'll see
[59:45] you again next year I said Thank You
[59:48] Lord
[59:49] Hallelujah
[59:51] I want to remind you
[59:53] that this God
[59:55] is our Jehovah Rapha
[59:57] oh God our healer
[1:00:00] don't be afraid
[1:00:02] when you see something
[1:00:03] happening don't be afraid
[1:00:06] take the name of Jesus
[1:00:09] he is the author the finisher of your
[1:00:11] faith
[1:00:13] may we all rejoice
[1:00:15] in the presence of God
[1:00:17] we're rejoicing with the word
[1:00:19] don't stop
[1:00:21] let us keep that momentum
[1:00:23] Rejoice rejoice
[1:00:26] and let the Lord come in our presence
[1:00:28] may the Lord bless you I want to tell
[1:00:31] you something
[1:00:32] don't be despondent when you see people
[1:00:34] leaving
[1:00:36] you know why
[1:00:37] you see when you say A man was 40 years
[1:00:41] in the message
[1:00:43] and he's leaving
[1:00:46] and that might be something
[1:00:48] you go home and think about it no don't
[1:00:50] go home and think about it
[1:00:52] you see God sent the prophet Malachi 4.
[1:00:57] he said he will turn the hearts
[1:00:59] of the children
[1:01:01] back to the Pentecostal father's faith
[1:01:04] he never said he said
[1:01:07] that's what happened to the people
[1:01:08] acknowledge they they didn't receive the
[1:01:12] message it didn't drop from here to
[1:01:13] there
[1:01:14] such a short distance
[1:01:16] from here today
[1:01:19] never drop
[1:01:21] if it only dropped that wouldn't happen
[1:01:24] because you come in you see what
[1:01:27] happened to Aiken
[1:01:30] what happened to Aiken
[1:01:31] he went to the people
[1:01:33] but when he saw that
[1:01:35] you see because he came from there when
[1:01:37] he looked at it they came from there he
[1:01:39] saw it
[1:01:40] so he wanted it
[1:01:43] so people thinking they came to this
[1:01:45] message they were wasting their time
[1:01:47] there would have been some doctor of
[1:01:49] divinity
[1:01:50] some doctor of so and so PhD lld mad
[1:01:55] that's what it is so they've gone back
[1:01:57] so don't get worried
[1:01:59] the Rapture is taking place there is a
[1:02:02] falling away
[1:02:03] there's a falling away
[1:02:05] and that falling away you can see it
[1:02:07] you can see it other people can't see it
[1:02:11] so they'll follow
[1:02:12] you just follow Jesus
[1:02:17] I will follow Jesus
[1:02:21] anywhere everywhere he goes
[1:02:25] follow
[1:02:28] I will follow Jesus hallelujah praise
[1:02:33] the Lord

[1:03:10] you know skeptical about when we said
[1:03:13] this was going to be the most
[1:03:14] Supernatural a year for the church but
[1:03:16] as we can see the months going on we can
[1:03:18] truly see God working amen we can see
[1:03:21] that it's not just a coincidence amen we
[1:03:24] can see amen how God is working week

[1:03:30] it's the 23rd amen amen 23rd of August
[1:03:34] 2023 amen and
[1:03:37] we can say that we are being changed
[1:03:39] amen we have been formed into that word
[1:03:41] image amen one thing I can say
[1:03:44] personally in in my life in this year is
[1:03:48] that God is starting to remove out the
[1:03:50] the fear amen I believe that the message
[1:03:53] people have been under a lot of fear
[1:03:56] over the years scared to pray for people
[1:03:57] scared to see results when they pray you
[1:04:00] know even
[1:04:01] we've been here in the last few weeks
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:05] um how we are to be courageous amen God
[1:04:09] doesn't work with cowards amen we heard
[1:04:11] that the other week I think on Sunday
[1:04:13] amen God does not use cowards amen he
[1:04:15] needs people that are brave amen because
[1:04:17] if God doesn't present the opportunity
[1:04:20] for you and if you don't take the
[1:04:22] opportunity we will never see the
[1:04:23] supernatural amen if you are never brave
[1:04:26] enough to go lay hands or to pray for
[1:04:28] someone amen we will never see the
[1:04:30] supernatural but God needs brave men
[1:04:32] amen like Joshua and Caleb who were
[1:04:34] Brave amen they were not cowards amen
[1:04:36] even though they saw giants
[1:04:38] amen they may be in the natural had
[1:04:40] every reason to be scared amen but they
[1:04:44] were Brave amen holding their confession
[1:04:47] amen I had a thought sitting there and I
[1:04:49] thought that perhaps the current state
[1:04:51] of where the message church is as a
[1:04:54] general whole is that
[1:04:56] when Mary produced Jesus Christ right
[1:05:00] and she was producing The Life of Christ
[1:05:04] all we know in the Bible from the early
[1:05:07] years of Jesus up until the wedding at
[1:05:10] uh
[1:05:11] Kane Kane and Cana
[1:05:14] is that we knew that at the age of 12
[1:05:16] Jesus was the word he was able to
[1:05:19] confound the priest with the word he
[1:05:22] could debate with the word we knew that
[1:05:23] we knew that he was a carpenter so he
[1:05:27] went about his daily life living but we
[1:05:29] knew nothing else about Jesus Christ in
[1:05:31] terms of the supernatural happening
[1:05:34] and that is where's the message as a
[1:05:37] general is perhaps now we've got the
[1:05:40] word we can confound any denomination
[1:05:42] person we can debate with any
[1:05:44] denomination person or any theological
[1:05:46] person about the word we go about our
[1:05:49] general lives working Etc but no
[1:05:52] Supernatural power of God moving until
[1:05:54] they come to the wedding and Mary comes
[1:05:57] to Jesus and say there's a situation
[1:05:59] here there's a problem there's no wine
[1:06:02] and Jesus look at what Jesus says to her
[1:06:04] Jesus says to her it's not my time as
[1:06:06] yet
[1:06:08] and doesn't that seem to be the picture
[1:06:10] of the message says no it's not our time
[1:06:11] we don't have that say the Lord we don't
[1:06:13] have to move now but Mary persistent
[1:06:16] said
[1:06:18] do what he says and she commanded those
[1:06:20] men to do what he says so Mary
[1:06:24] basically moved and and and moved Upon
[1:06:27] Jesus to then get into action and the
[1:06:30] bride of Christ the true bride of Christ
[1:06:32] at this hour is now getting into that
[1:06:34] place where they are saying no no no we
[1:06:36] cannot wait anymore it's time to get
[1:06:38] into action it's time to see the
[1:06:40] supernatural amen it's time for the Life
[1:06:42] of Christ not only to produce the word
[1:06:44] amen but to produce the power that was
[1:06:47] in the word amen and that is the place
[1:06:49] that we are God is bringing us into this
[1:06:51] year amen amen and like Joshua mentioned
[1:06:54] amen when when John the Baptist was dead
[1:06:57] in the womb amen but when the name of
[1:06:59] Jesus was spoken amen that dead baby
[1:07:03] came to life amen so we cannot be dead
[1:07:05] amen we have to have life in US amen so
[1:07:08] like I said amen God does not use
[1:07:10] cowards amen and over the last
[1:07:14] um you know over the last week or two
[1:07:16] weeks I noticed in my own life that God
[1:07:19] is starting to take away that fear of of
[1:07:22] wanting to needing to pray for people or
[1:07:25] even like we said mentioning the name
[1:07:27] William Branham mentioning what we
[1:07:29] believe in being true to what we believe
[1:07:31] in amen not not shocking around about it
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:35] amen I was just the other weekend I was
[1:07:37] sharing this testimony with brother
[1:07:39] Adrian and I'm not going to share the
[1:07:41] full testimony because this has also
[1:07:42] been recorded and I don't doubt and
[1:07:45] unbelief to set in before we before I
[1:07:47] hear the full the victory of the
[1:07:49] testimony amen but I was on my way to
[1:07:52] work and I was driving and I was busy
[1:07:54] praying
[1:07:55] um as I usually do in the mornings to
[1:07:57] work
[1:07:58] and I drove past a beggar that was on
[1:08:01] the street
[1:08:02] and he had a condition and I won't say
[1:08:04] what the condition is
[1:08:06] but he had a condition and I drove past
[1:08:08] him I can't continue driving while
[1:08:10] spraying and then in my spirit the words
[1:08:14] of what pastor preached the week the
[1:08:16] Sunday before that was that God will
[1:08:18] present to you opportunities what are
[1:08:21] you doing with those opportunities
[1:08:23] and something urged me urged me to turn
[1:08:25] and go back
[1:08:27] and it was so impressed upon my heart
[1:08:29] that there wasn't even an easy place for
[1:08:32] me to turn and go back I had to like
[1:08:33] literally drive like further down come
[1:08:36] back I turned and came back and then
[1:08:38] there was cars behind me so I just
[1:08:40] couldn't get to this person I had to
[1:08:41] turn like three times just to get to him
[1:08:44] and because he has begging I firstly
[1:08:47] gave him money and I asked him I could
[1:08:48] see what his condition was but then he
[1:08:51] he explained to me what his real
[1:08:53] condition is
[1:08:55] and I didn't pray for him I took his
[1:08:57] hand and I said in Jesus name you're
[1:09:00] going to receive it
[1:09:02] I said in Jesus name you're going to
[1:09:03] receive this I'm not going to say what
[1:09:04] it is as I said because I don't want
[1:09:06] doubt to come in if I'm anyone watching
[1:09:08] it who might not believe because if I
[1:09:10] told you what it is some of you might
[1:09:12] think I'm a mad person amen and we heard
[1:09:15] on Sunday if you paid attention to the
[1:09:17] word on Sunday it was directly related
[1:09:19] to this testimony amen but usually if
[1:09:24] you look at a condition like that you'd
[1:09:26] be fearful to pray over something like
[1:09:27] that because you'd be fearful of what if
[1:09:30] one in case you don't see the results
[1:09:31] but something Came Upon me that all fear
[1:09:34] just went away
[1:09:36] and I couldn't do anything else but hold
[1:09:38] his hand and speak the word of him and I
[1:09:41] drove away and I said and now every day
[1:09:43] that I drive past there I am looking for
[1:09:46] this person to see that come to pass I
[1:09:49] know and I told Brother agent I know
[1:09:50] that I'm going to see it come to pass
[1:09:52] whether it's this week whether it's five
[1:09:54] years or whatever it's going to come to
[1:09:56] pass and that is when I will share the
[1:09:58] full testimony of it amen but I'd like
[1:10:00] to thank God Amen to take that when he's
[1:10:02] taking out that fear I mean that's when
[1:10:03] we can operate in faith amen I also have
[1:10:06] a lot of testimonies to share you know
[1:10:08] over Sister Kim and the baby but she
[1:10:10] wants to be here uh when when I share
[1:10:13] their testimony but
[1:10:15] brother Joshua also mentioned I didn't
[1:10:17] know that the brother actually told him
[1:10:19] about it but we have that course on on
[1:10:22] Monday
[1:10:24] and Josh had already left and we were
[1:10:26] waiting for the matter
[1:10:28] and so this guy you know yes
[1:10:31] congratulates me for baby and he and he
[1:10:33] asked me whether he could bring a candle
[1:10:35] for me because he's a Catholic you know
[1:10:36] it's a light for babies so tell him no
[1:10:38] you know what I don't we don't do that
[1:10:39] and we don't believe in all that but
[1:10:41] then I realized as a Catholic and I said
[1:10:42] this is my opportunity
[1:10:45] yeah
[1:10:47] size that are witnessing to him and
[1:10:49] unashamedly I told him what we believe I
[1:10:51] told him we believe in a prophet his
[1:10:53] name is William Branham We Believe In
[1:10:55] the End Time message and this is what
[1:10:57] the message says about the Catholic
[1:10:58] Church
[1:10:59] and I told him that the pope is the
[1:11:01] Antichrist and I told him that you know
[1:11:04] I told him and I and I told I gave him
[1:11:06] the prophet's favorite line I said you
[1:11:08] know if you don't believe certain thing
[1:11:09] keep what whatever you believe if you
[1:11:11] don't believe the rest you can throw it
[1:11:12] out but at least hear me out so I took
[1:11:15] him to the scriptures I told him how the
[1:11:17] mark of the beast is and how she is
[1:11:20] displayed in the Book of Revelation and
[1:11:22] so he has very enthused being a Catholic
[1:11:24] he has very enthusiant what I had to say
[1:11:27] because he could not deny the scriptures
[1:11:29] now
[1:11:30] he might be able to deny my own opinion
[1:11:33] but he could not deny the scriptures
[1:11:35] about the triple six about Rome being
[1:11:37] seated over seven hills and all of that
[1:11:41] and then I took him back in history and
[1:11:43] I showed him how the Catholic Church
[1:11:44] started to form started to pollute the
[1:11:47] doctrines Etc
[1:11:49] and then whilst I'm talking to him I
[1:11:51] could on the side of my eye I could see
[1:11:52] this lady continuously looking at me
[1:11:55] so
[1:11:56] but I kept on talking to him
[1:11:59] then when I walked past she got she just
[1:12:01] got my attention said sorry are you
[1:12:03] seven day Adventists
[1:12:04] because you know they have some similar
[1:12:06] beliefs about the end time so I told her
[1:12:08] no sorry I'm not I'm not 78 Francis I
[1:12:10] Believe In the End Time message of
[1:12:12] William Branham
[1:12:13] so what I'm trying to say is God is
[1:12:16] moving out over the years we've been too
[1:12:18] reserved amen
[1:12:20] if you look at God's men in the Bible
[1:12:22] they were not reserved
[1:12:24] well they were reserved in the maybe in
[1:12:27] their personal life but when it came to
[1:12:28] the things of God they were not reserved
[1:12:30] John the Baptist was not afraid to tell
[1:12:33] a King Herod what he has reading was
[1:12:34] wrong
[1:12:36] amen God's man has always been
[1:12:38] courageous amen that is what he's
[1:12:40] calling us to because he cannot use us
[1:12:42] if we remain cowards amen we've got to
[1:12:44] be courageous but at the same time
[1:12:46] we got to realize amen where we are
[1:12:49] wrong and I think that's where as a
[1:12:50] church we've come to this year we've we
[1:12:52] have looked and taken introspection and
[1:12:55] we've said Lord work in us use us change
[1:12:58] us if we are wrong in any way change us
[1:13:00] amen so let's be let's be like that amen
[1:13:03] every week we are in the word of God the
[1:13:05] word is molding us it's shaping us let's
[1:13:07] allow God to shape us amen there's still
[1:13:09] a lot of work for God to do on us but he
[1:13:12] is doing it amen and he's faithful and
[1:13:14] just to finish the work amen if there's
[1:13:17] anyone else that would like to see
[1:13:18] anything you can Comfort now
[1:13:21] you can raise your hands if you are
[1:13:24] coming
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:53] good evening Saints
[1:13:55] it probably should be here
[1:13:59] so um I find it interesting what Jeff
[1:14:02] was talking about being fearful
[1:14:04] and I think the problem with a lot of
[1:14:08] people and in this generation we live in
[1:14:11] is that the spirit of professionalism
[1:14:13] and secularism and fearful is in this
[1:14:18] whole generation
[1:14:20] and it's something I realized it's you
[1:14:22] know you see all over social media where
[1:14:25] people who want to separate themselves
[1:14:27] from
[1:14:28] God
[1:14:29] they even bring in the churches it's
[1:14:33] what's fascinating is that the the demon
[1:14:36] he wants to come in the church and he
[1:14:39] works in he wants to deceive everyone in
[1:14:41] the church now from out the church
[1:14:43] and I find it really fascinating and
[1:14:45] there's one thing about being fearful
[1:14:47] also when you don't want to spread the
[1:14:49] word is that you're also being selfish
[1:14:53] and that's something I realized it
[1:14:56] anyone especially asking a message the
[1:14:59] time that we don't use the opportunity
[1:15:00] we're being selfish yes
[1:15:02] and I feel like many times I've been
[1:15:05] selfish and without spraying the word
[1:15:07] but if I give you one testimony
[1:15:10] I have a friend who is a Hindu and you
[1:15:14] know Hindus I feel like
[1:15:16] they they'll never want to you're your
[1:15:19] side of being a Christian and so on
[1:15:22] so you know one day I decided to to just
[1:15:25] to tell you more about William brand who
[1:15:28] doesn't know anything about it obviously
[1:15:29] they they only know their things so I
[1:15:33] decided to just bring up the name
[1:15:35] and then and then one day he started to
[1:15:38] just Google his name and he told me you
[1:15:41] know you know on Google he says
[1:15:43] um this is a bit of controversy and and
[1:15:47] he's like a doomsday prophet and so on
[1:15:49] so then I started discuss with the Bible
[1:15:52] I told him to read at least the first
[1:15:55] book of the Bible Genesis
[1:15:58] so what he found interesting was that
[1:16:03] um God made us in the likeness of his
[1:16:05] image
[1:16:06] and it's and that's why we've been
[1:16:09] talking about the whole year is for us
[1:16:10] to come into the likeness of God
[1:16:13] and to redeem falling men so as a
[1:16:17] talking team and so on he started
[1:16:19] getting intrigued by the message and in
[1:16:22] triple eyes you have to say and my
[1:16:24] beliefs so you know I'm praying I pray
[1:16:27] for him is
[1:16:28] I told him to even if you want to come
[1:16:30] to the youths he can come and and he
[1:16:34] said he actually might come I know
[1:16:37] and one of my other friends he's a
[1:16:40] Christian as well and he's in a
[1:16:43] domination one thing uh we'll be talking
[1:16:46] about is that there's a spirit of the
[1:16:48] Pharisees that's similar to what's
[1:16:50] happening in East church and he started
[1:16:52] to pick up on it so why are we talking
[1:16:54] about it one service in Wednesday but
[1:16:58] the agents start talking about that same
[1:16:59] Spirit that's from that time is still in
[1:17:01] this in the churches now
[1:17:03] so and then he started getting intrigued
[1:17:06] by when I mentioned the name William
[1:17:08] random and I still discussed some things
[1:17:11] that
[1:17:12] that's going on the judge and people
[1:17:15] always get uh astounded when they hear
[1:17:18] about the things that's going on what I
[1:17:21] believe and so on so yeah
[1:17:26] [Applause]
[1:17:33] amen
[1:17:35] so do you believe God is taking out the
[1:17:36] fear and bringing courageous men amen
[1:17:39] that in itself is a testimony amen that
[1:17:42] God can start to raise up young men amen
[1:17:45] amen let's stand and sing amen
