[3:21] hallelujah we're come here to show the
[3:22] devil whose side we on we come here to
[3:24] serve a risen Jesus amen give him a good
[3:26] ank clap of Praise he's not dead but
[3:28] he's alive
[3:30] prise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen
[3:34] so amen we ask you to keep remembering
[3:37] the family of Brother Willie naid amen
[3:40] and uh yesterday was the funeral and
[3:43] they asked me to do the funeral amen so
[3:45] we were there ministering the word of
[3:47] the Lord just want to share this with
[3:48] you that the word of the Lord can come
[3:50] and penetrate even the hardest of Hearts
[3:53] yes people that you think will never be
[3:56] open to the gospel but when the word of
[3:58] God comes forth amen amen amen yesterday
[4:01] the word went forth and I think it was
[4:03] like busting concrete for the word to
[4:06] get sewn in
[4:07] there amen so apart from all the
[4:10] Believers that were there that
[4:12] complimented the sermon for me that
[4:14] didn't matter to me that the Believers
[4:15] were complimenting because they knew the
[4:17] message of the hour they know about the
[4:21] gospel but there was a Hindu girl St
[4:23] Hindu married to my NE to my cousin
[4:26] brother Joshua knows the family well
[4:28] that's uh because he led the father to
[4:30] the Lord there and these people are so
[4:31] staunch in the Gos in their faith that
[4:34] they wouldn't listen to anyone in all of
[4:35] the family functions they are the most
[4:37] religious ones having prayer and things
[4:39] so I was standing and talking to some of
[4:41] the sisters there after the service
[4:43] think s l and maybe Angelia I forget who
[4:45] was there my wife was standing there and
[4:48] she could have walked past me but she
[4:49] tapped me on my shoulder she called me
[4:51] and she says that was
[4:54] something
[4:56] right there the witnesses here they were
[4:58] standing right there there and I said
[5:00] well you got you think about it she says
[5:03] yeah you left me with loss to think
[5:04] about amen now what can do that except I
[5:07] as a man words can't do that to people
[5:10] it's got to take the Holy Ghost then we
[5:12] were going in the car park and another
[5:13] old man his name is George he gets off
[5:17] the car because he was looking for me
[5:19] he's also a Hindu he gets off the car
[5:22] just to come shake my hand and tell me
[5:24] Well Done I really enjoyed what you were
[5:26] saying what would make unbelievers do
[5:29] that yes it's the power of the Gospel
[5:31] amen amen they must see a resurrected
[5:33] Lord Jesus Christ so I also ask you to
[5:36] remember them in prayer because when the
[5:38] word is sown Satan will come to try and
[5:40] pluck the word out of their hearts now
[5:42] we never know that these things could be
[5:44] playing in the head and they could
[5:46] soften up amen and God can do something
[5:49] so every opportunity we get we ought to
[5:51] be presenting the gospel amen you know
[5:54] yesterday I was challenged there because
[5:57] I knew that there was going to be mostly
[5:58] Believers so I could have preached a
[6:00] message sermon where the Believers would
[6:03] have been rejoicing amen but the Holy
[6:06] Spirit allowed it in the way to present
[6:07] Christ to the people Amen to show them
[6:10] the resurrected Lord Jesus and the
[6:12] benefits of serving the lord Jesus amen
[6:15] so sister Rosemary was a wonderful
[6:16] sister amen served the Lord faithfully
[6:20] and uh the Lord saw it fit to take her
[6:22] home at this
[6:23] time amen you know sometimes we may be
[6:27] sick we may be unwell and you think but
[6:30] didn't we
[6:31] pray to the point of death didn't we
[6:33] have
[6:35] faith didn't we believe God why didn't
[6:37] God touch that person why didn't God
[6:39] heal that person you see all of us have
[6:41] an expiry
[6:43] date there's a
[6:45] birthday and if the Lord carries there's
[6:47] a death
[6:48] date and no amount of
[6:51] prayer can stop God I was reading a
[6:54] quote this morning and the prophet is
[6:55] saying that the sister came into the
[6:57] prayer
[6:58] line and the prophet says she came there
[7:01] for something it could have been a heart
[7:04] problem and the prophet says he prayed
[7:05] the prayer of faith and said go on your
[7:06] way believing you healed but he says as
[7:08] she was walking by he saw this black
[7:11] shadow following her so remember what he
[7:13] was doing confessing Mark
[7:16] 16 as she's going by he sees this black
[7:20] thing over her he calls her back and he
[7:22] tells the sister make yourself ready
[7:24] you're going to meet the
[7:27] Lord he says she goes back into the seat
[7:30] and she's like looking at her husband
[7:31] and saying what was that you know the
[7:33] man says I'm going to die and the
[7:35] prophet say she died right there there
[7:37] to come and take her away not that she
[7:39] was irreverent to anything it was a time
[7:42] to
[7:43] go amen so the Bible says to everything
[7:46] there's a season time to be born yes and
[7:49] a time to die I know nobody nobody da
[7:52] wants to go on the other side you want
[7:54] to hold on to life dear life with your
[7:57] last breath amen but a Believer knows
[8:00] what's waiting on the other
[8:02] side one of the thoughts I was sharing
[8:05] yesterday was about a seed that's
[8:06] planted in the ground when you plant a
[8:09] orange
[8:10] seed what are you expecting out of the
[8:13] ground you're not going to expect apples
[8:15] right so when a human is swn into the
[8:18] ground what must he raise up as
[8:22] amen a Son of God he must raise up but
[8:25] even better when you saw a seed into the
[8:27] ground how you reap a harvest of seeds
[8:30] and you eat
[8:32] seeds are you getting something
[8:35] better something juicy something more
[8:38] glorious than the seed so when a
[8:41] Believer is swn in faith in Christ he's
[8:44] coming back glorious amen he's coming
[8:46] back younger he's coming back wiser amen
[8:49] amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[8:52] amen let's stand for the reading of
[8:53] God's word amen this morning we'll speak
[8:55] on the authority of Mark 11:23 in me
[8:58] amen
[9:00] amen praise the Lord amen but before we
[9:03] get there on want to read the
[9:04] progression of scriptures I didn't
[9:05] realize that Mark was so packed with
[9:08] Dynamic quickening power most of the
[9:10] scriptures that deal with the church and
[9:12] our faith lies here in The Book of
[9:15] Mark amen praise the
[9:21] Lord Mark 9:23
[9:24] says if thou can't believe all things
[9:27] are possible to him that believeth amen
[9:32] amen if thou can believe all things are
[9:36] possible to him that believeth we'll go
[9:40] to our focal point in scripture Mark
[9:42] 11:23 which
[9:47] reads for verily I say unto you that
[9:56] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[9:59] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[10:02] the sea and shall not doubt in his
[10:06] heart but Shall Believe those things
[10:08] which he saith shall come to pass he
[10:11] shall have whatsoever he saith
[10:17] amen if you don't know this is the
[10:19] season we are in now amen amen amen the
[10:23] time for murmuring and complaining is
[10:25] over amen you've got to open up your
[10:27] mouth and speak things that you want yes
[10:31] Lord amen God has put the authority in
[10:34] our mouth Yes amen so he says whosoever
[10:38] is that the priest is that the pastor
[10:41] the Deacon
[10:45] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[10:48] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[10:50] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[10:52] but shall believe that those things
[10:54] which he say shall come to pass he shall
[10:56] have whatsoever he sayth one more
[10:58] portion of of scripture before you be
[11:00] seated Mark
[11:02] 16
[11:17] amen so in Mark 11 from verse1 14 we see
[11:21] that Jesus is left with 11
[11:24] disciples amen so one was walking among
[11:28] them among
[11:30] them but he wasn't a True
[11:32] Believer amen he was
[11:34] always nagging the church telling them
[11:37] you shouldn't use the money for this you
[11:39] shouldn't be doing this you shouldn't be
[11:40] doing this amen the Bible says he had
[11:43] his hand in the
[11:45] purse but that's
[11:48] something with that number there cuz he
[11:51] had 11 disciples left amen afterward he
[11:53] appeared unto the 11 as he sat at meat
[11:56] and upgraded them with their unbelief
[11:58] and Hardness of Heart because they
[11:59] believe not them which had seen him
[12:03] after he was
[12:05] risen and he said unto
[12:07] them go into all the world and preach
[12:10] the gospel to Every
[12:14] Creature before I go on there the spirit
[12:16] just wants me to focus on that verse
[12:18] there you see what Jesus did
[12:21] there you think in his parting
[12:25] message he'd be giving them a nice
[12:27] farewell sermon
[12:29] read that verse again afterward this is
[12:32] he Jesus appears unto the 11 and as he
[12:35] set at meat he uped
[12:41] them because of the unbelief and
[12:43] Hardness of Heart so Jesus and he starts
[12:46] calling
[12:49] them now a pastor's job is to rebuke
[12:52] Amen to bring correction yes that's not
[12:54] the job of the other four of the
[12:56] ministry the pro that's a a pastor's job
[12:59] because the pastor is The Shepherd of
[13:01] the flock so any other Ministry comes
[13:04] here it's not their job to rebuke to
[13:05] chastise the church and all of these
[13:06] things it is the pastor's job
[13:11] amen upgraded them with their unbelief
[13:14] and Hardness of Heart because they
[13:15] believe not them which had seen him
[13:18] after he was
[13:20] risen now when after it is a rising of
[13:23] the Sun and after it is risen and we are
[13:26] telling you that Jesus Christ is
[13:27] reproduced in human flesh again and in
[13:29] you and
[13:30] I if you don't believe us there's a
[13:34] rebuke coming to you so yeah after Jesus
[13:37] rebukes them I wonder how the spirits
[13:40] must have been now Jesus tells them go
[13:43] into all the world and preach the gospel
[13:45] to Every Creature
[13:48] amen he that believeth and is baptized
[13:51] shall be
[13:52] saved and he that believeth not shall be
[13:57] damned and these signs shall follow them
[14:00] that
[14:01] believe in my name they shall cast out
[14:05] Devils so if you tell me that you
[14:07] believe these are some of the signs that
[14:09] will accompany you
[14:12] amen amen anyone can make a profession
[14:15] but Jesus is saying you are going the
[14:17] believer can be clearly
[14:22] identified in my name they shall cast
[14:24] out Devils they shall speak with new
[14:27] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[14:29] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[14:32] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[14:34] the sick and they shall
[14:38] recover amen praise the Lord the Lord
[14:42] had blessings to the reading of his word
[14:43] you may be
[14:46] seated amen so the
[14:51] authority of Mark
[14:53] 11:23 in me now I'm saying in me I'm not
[14:57] personalizing it to me you need to
[14:59] personalize it to you amen the authority
[15:02] of God's word is in every one of
[15:06] us now we know that every word word of
[15:09] God that is written is the sworn
[15:12] Authority amen this is what the prophet
[15:15] is teaching us now the word of God is
[15:17] God sworn Authority amen it's the
[15:20] absolute for every believer amen it's
[15:22] the infallible truth amen yes amen and
[15:26] the Bible says that heavens and earth
[15:27] will pass away but my words will never
[15:29] pass away
[15:32] Hallelujah and the prophet tells us it
[15:34] must be fulfilled in its season amen
[15:38] amen amen you see Mark 11:23 comes about
[15:44] because of the fig tree that was
[15:46] cursed that the disciples were
[15:48] questioning Jesus regarding the Fig Tree
[15:51] now we know the Fig Tree types Israel
[15:56] amen can everybody agree agree with that
[15:59] the Fig Tree Jesus says he's typing
[16:01] Israel yes amen
[16:04] amen so this was also when Jesus was
[16:08] cursing the tree it was also a figure of
[16:11] what he was
[16:13] doing because here he comes in the
[16:15] beginning of Mark 11 he comes riding he
[16:17] comes into Jerusalem riding on a
[16:20] CT and what scripture was he
[16:24] fulfilling he was fulfilling a prophecy
[16:27] in the Bible that says behold your king
[16:30] comes riding am yes Amen on a CT amen so
[16:35] he was fulfilling scripture but a king
[16:38] if they are declaring Behold a king is
[16:40] coming a king has
[16:43] Authority when a king
[16:46] speaks amen his subjects must obey but
[16:50] this wasn't just any ordinary King oh
[16:53] yes Lord because you can see the king
[16:55] speaking to his disciples and telling
[16:57] them go and you'll find the the cold
[16:58] tide but you speak to those men and they
[17:01] will give you the cat tell them loose
[17:02] the cat for the
[17:04] master they must a natural person
[17:07] wouldn't recognize Jesus to be their
[17:09] Master but y as a king in Authority tell
[17:11] them the master has need of
[17:17] it amen then he's coming now and he sees
[17:21] Israel a far
[17:23] off and she's got
[17:25] leaves she's performing religious
[17:28] ceremon
[17:29] she's performing the duties the high
[17:31] priest is in the temple sacrifice is
[17:33] being presented but yeah God Almighty is
[17:36] on Earth yes amen he sees from a far off
[17:40] she's very religious so he goes to the
[17:43] vict Tre to see if there be any fruit in
[17:46] there oh yes amen help us Lord
[17:50] yes yes help us so when Jesus comes to
[17:53] Israel and he's presenting the word they
[17:56] are telling them we are our Father
[17:58] Abraham
[18:01] but Jesus The Living Word who Abraham
[18:03] spoke about is standing in the midst of
[18:05] them and he tells them before Abraham
[18:07] was I am amen amen hallelujah
[18:11] hallelujah so Jesus cursing the Fig Tree
[18:14] is a figure of speech where Jesus sorry
[18:17] it's not just a figure he literally
[18:18] cursed a victory and it withered away
[18:20] but it is a shadow of him cursing Israel
[18:24] that their eyes will be closed amen amen
[18:27] amen
[18:29] and then when the vi Tre is withered
[18:31] away he comes now to the disciples and
[18:34] he says now the authority is being given
[18:36] to you if you say to the mountain I'm
[18:40] done working with the Fig
[18:42] Tree in fact this fig tree can be found
[18:44] all the way in
[18:45] Genesis Adam ran to it when they fell
[18:49] trying to find the covering so God hates
[18:51] Victory
[18:54] religion man-made
[18:56] religion you find it again in Mark 11
[19:00] Jesus speaking to the Fig Tree and now
[19:03] there's something about that tree it
[19:05] didn't recognize its
[19:09] creator let me tell you why they put a
[19:12] dead rod in the ark where the same
[19:15] presence of the Lord lay and that dead
[19:17] Rod dried
[19:19] Rod bed in that
[19:22] presence amen this tree was so hard in
[19:25] Earth I'm telling you it's typing Israel
[19:28] in the presence of the same Shak of
[19:30] Glory that tree was supposed to produce
[19:33] fruit but it refused to produce fruit
[19:36] that's why the Bible says Jesus answered
[19:39] the Fig
[19:40] Tree it's a figure it's a type of
[19:43] Israel yes it's a type of Israel who
[19:47] rejected the Messiah in the presence of
[19:49] the Messiah they couldn't burst forth
[19:51] into life but you know that God also
[19:54] says that he blinded them for a season
[19:56] that we the Gentiles could come in
[19:59] am amen so the word of God is our sworn
[20:03] Authority amen and and the prophet tells
[20:06] us that every promise in the book
[20:08] belongs to the
[20:09] believer amen hallelujah when God speaks
[20:14] that becomes a
[20:16] law amen and the Holy Spirit is here to
[20:19] enforce the law amen for the believer
[20:21] amen you have been ordained to do it and
[20:24] it takes the
[20:26] believer how many of you have ever heard
[20:28] the Holy Ghost
[20:29] speak
[20:32] am amen how many of you have heard the
[20:36] Holy Ghost speak amen amen if you were
[20:40] not here Wednesday brother Joshua laid
[20:41] it out beautifully how the Holy Ghost
[20:43] speaks and now you've got to submit to
[20:45] the authority of the Holy
[20:47] Ghost you see I told you the Holy Ghost
[20:50] is not wandering around like a Wandering
[20:51] Spirit the Holy Ghost is working through
[20:54] men amen yes the fivefold ministry is
[20:57] God's dressed way for for the
[21:01] church you telling me are you trying to
[21:04] tell me Pastor that as you speaking now
[21:05] the Holy Ghost is speaking to you
[21:09] yes but the holy spirit is yet to
[21:11] enforce that law you have been ordained
[21:14] to do so and it takes a
[21:16] Believer you've got to have the badge of
[21:19] a Believer we got Authority any law
[21:23] enforcement officer will have a
[21:27] badge but don't be a
[21:29] counterfeit you know you get fake
[21:31] officers coming to your house telling
[21:32] you that they a police officer they can
[21:34] present a
[21:36] badge
[21:38] amen the prophet tells us that the
[21:41] greatest curse on the church today is
[21:43] the church not knowing who they
[21:45] are
[21:47] amen and the prophet is telling us that

[41:07] God gave his church The Authority by
[41:09] using the name by faith to cast out evil
[41:11] spirits and heal the sick and do great
[41:13] signs of Wonders I can show you where it
[41:15] was given to the church but there's no
[41:17] record in the Bible nowhere where he
[41:19] ever took that power away from the
[41:25] church
[41:29] but this Gospel of the same Deliverance
[41:31] was to be preached to All Nations
[41:33] beginning at
[41:34] Jerusalem and we was to be Witnesses of
[41:37] him in Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the
[41:40] uttermost parts of the
[41:42] Earth this gospel the signs was to
[41:45] follow the believer until he comes again
[41:47] go into all the World Mark

[42:00] authority of the law if electricity has
[42:02] certain laws you've got to submit to
[42:04] that Authority if you work against the
[42:07] laws of electricity you can kill
[42:10] yourself anything in
[42:13] life amen how many of you know even at
[42:16] work when you go
[42:18] there there's levels of authority you
[42:22] can't just Storm Into the director's
[42:24] office and start telling
[42:28] nonsense amen yes didn't the Centurion
[42:31] tell Jesus about Authority and he says I
[42:35] am command over this 100 men and I tell
[42:38] them do this do this do this and they go
[42:40] and do
[42:44] it we've got to submit to Authority in
[42:46] any matter am we cannot resist the
[42:49] authority otherwise it will not work for
[42:50] us

[42:55] when is
[42:58] trained he's got the authority of the
[43:00] state behind
[43:03] him but he can't just go around without
[43:06] his
[43:07] [Music]
[43:09] uniform sometimes they go around plain
[43:11] clothes but what they've got to produce
[43:16] identification so he's got to produce
[43:18] identification the same policeman if
[43:20] he's a traffic officer he can stand on
[43:22] the N2 or
[43:25] N3
[43:27] and that car can be going 150 M hour
[43:30] could be an 18wheeler Truck moving at
[43:32] high speed if he steps out on that road
[43:35] and he raises his hand and flags them
[43:37] down they better
[43:41] stop that's
[43:46] Authority he doesn't stop the truck by
[43:49] his power he stops it by his

[53:47] see an acceleration Amen in the move of
[53:51] God at Harvest Time there'll be an
[53:53] acceleration in the right
[53:56] rening he says there's so many
[53:58] spiritualists that know more about the
[54:00] spiritual World talking about now these
[54:02] fortune tellers and these they know more
[54:04] about the spiritual world than people
[54:06] who profess themselves to be
[54:13] Christians
[54:15] amen praise the Lord you see the high
[54:18] priests and the Levites of Jesus day
[54:21] they call Jesus a
[54:23] devil when when he was here on Earth
[54:26] they called Jesus a
[54:29] devil but here the Devil Comes the
[54:31] lowest form of demon man that was bound
[54:33] in the
[54:35] tombs the Devil Himself says we know who
[54:37] you are you're the Son of God the Holy
[54:40] One Devils can recognize who you are
[54:43] more than other people
[54:46] amen he says while educated Theological
[54:49] Seminary preachers recognized him to be
[54:51] beab which was right the devil or the
[54:54] preacher
[54:59] sure people always want to believe the
[55:01] preacher the high priest who was right
[55:04] in that case the high priest was calling
[55:06] him a devil the devil was calling him
[55:08] the Son of God the prophet is asking you
[55:10] a question who was right the devil or
[55:12] the
[55:15] preacher the devil was and he says
[55:18] brother it hasn't change much today they
[55:20] don't recognize the power of God no
[55:23] matter how much teaching you got you can
[55:25] drum that into
[55:27] it he says God is not in big words God
[55:30] is in an honest
[55:32] heart you might stand there speak big
[55:34] words like I don't know
[55:36] what that doesn't bring you closer to
[55:39] God some people sleep with the
[55:41] dictionary I wonder how I'm going to
[55:43] speak this word now
[55:46] and confuse the
[55:52] people you can stand and practice how to
[55:54] repeat teach a sermon and say these
[55:56] things that don't bring you closer to
[55:58] God you can learn the dictionary till
[56:00] you sleep with one is he saying this you
[56:03] can learn the dictionary till you sleep
[56:05] with one and it still wouldn't get you
[56:07] closer to God what gets me closer to God
[56:10] brother Brandon a humble submitted heart
[56:14] in the Simplicity is what brings you to
[56:16] God a humble heart God loves no matter
[56:19] if you don't know your ABCs that don't
[56:21] make a difference just a humble heart
[56:23] God dwells in a humble heart
[56:25] not in education it's in schools not in
[56:29] schools seminaries not big words God
[56:32] dwells in the human heart you see what
[56:34] Mark 11:23 says if you believe in your
[56:40] heart if you believe in your heart the
[56:42] words that you
[56:43] speak you shall have what you say
[56:46] amen amen do you realize that's where
[56:49] man fell from he never believed his own
[56:52] word so they asked Jesus how you spoke
[56:54] to them to the street Jesus said well I
[56:57] spoke with my mouth and I believed in my
[56:59] heart and he tells him you're talking
[57:02] about the tree look at this mountain
[57:05] here if you speak to this
[57:09] mountain and tell it where to go and you
[57:12] believe in your heart and you confess
[57:14] with your mouth you shall have what you
[57:15] said
[57:17] amen but that's too
[57:20] simple man he fell away from knowing who
[57:24] he is
[57:25] that he's the god of the earth amen that
[57:27] he's given dominion over the
[57:30] Earth didn't we read that in Romans 10
[57:34] if you believe in your heart confess
[57:35] with your mouth you can be saved you
[57:38] shall be saved same principle applies in
[57:41] anything in
[57:43] life confess with your mouth believe in
[57:46] your heart am you see for too long maybe
[57:49] you've been confessing I'm good for
[57:50] nothing nothing good ever comes of me
[57:53] and you believe it in your heart that's
[57:55] why you continue that way
[58:00] right amen so you need to change the
[58:03] your confession yes when you change your
[58:06] confession you change your
[58:08] belief you change the way you think you
[58:10] change who you are
[58:12] amen so he says the lower down you can
[58:15] break yourself the more simple you can
[58:17] become greater in the sight of God
[58:20] Amen he says I see your fields of wheat
[58:22] out here are we wheat in the Bible he
[58:27] calls us wheat right listen what he says
[58:29] a full head of wheat always
[58:36] bows a little old spri sticks out there
[58:39] flopping around like it knows
[58:41] everything it ain't got it in the head
[58:45] that's the way with a lot of these guys
[58:47] that think they got a whole lot in their
[58:49] head nothing in the heart though a holy
[58:52] head will bow to the power oh recognize
[58:55] Jesus Christ amen as the Son of God and
[58:59] believe his Works
[59:04] amen he says now we know exactly from
[59:07] the word which was recorded by the Holy
[59:09] Spirit how the first original church was
[59:11] founded and how God manifested himself
[59:14] in her that's what the church was at
[59:17] Pentecost is the standard now listen to
[59:21] this if something is the standard it's
[59:23] the pattern God will never change
[59:26] yes we can't become so Advanced that we
[59:30] bypass God's pattern listen to this
[59:31] quote very carefully now the church at
[59:34] Pentecost is the standard
[59:36] amen amen that is the pattern
[59:41] yes there is no other pattern amen
[59:47] yes no matter what the scholars say God
[59:50] has not changed that pattern
[59:52] amen what God did at pentec because he
[59:55] has to keep on doing until the church
[59:58] age closes yes
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:03] amen I thought I can with my books at
[1:00:06] home my churches book my SE that's even
[1:00:08] saying that is like a figment of
[1:00:11] imagination cuz people don't sit with
[1:00:13] their Church AG book and they don't sit
[1:00:14] with their seals book they don't sit
[1:00:16] with a message book that's like a
[1:00:18] figment of our imagination now that
[1:00:23] we but it's not sitting at home doing
[1:00:27] nothing with the
[1:00:29] gospel he says the Pentecostal Church
[1:00:32] talking about Pentecost in the Bible is
[1:00:34] the pattern God never changed the
[1:00:39] pattern what he did at Pentecost he has
[1:00:42] got to keep on doing until the church
[1:00:43] age closes he says those Scholars may
[1:00:46] tell you the apostolic age is over don't
[1:00:48] you believe
[1:00:50] it such statement is wrong on two counts
[1:00:53] first it is wrong wrong to suppose that
[1:00:55] there aren't any more Apostles because
[1:00:58] the original 12 are dead and Apostle
[1:01:00] means sent ones there are many sent ones
[1:01:02] today as long as men are called and sent
[1:01:04] forth with the word of life there's an
[1:01:06] Apostolic age going
[1:01:10] on secondly they refer to the age of
[1:01:13] manifested holy ghost power as being
[1:01:15] over since the Bible has been completed
[1:01:18] that is
[1:01:19] untrue there's not even one scripture to
[1:01:22] suggest that
[1:01:26] here is our proof on both these charges
[1:01:28] are false acts
[1:01:31] 238 so he quotes acts 238 right and he
[1:01:35] says the promise of the power with which
[1:01:38] the apostles were endured at Pentecost
[1:01:40] is to you and he's got the Jews and to
[1:01:43] the children Jews and to them are far
[1:01:46] off which is Gentiles and many as the
[1:01:48] Lord Our God shall call both Jew and
[1:01:50] Gentile until he stops calling the
[1:01:54] pentec costal message and power will not
[1:02:04] cease you better sit back in your chair
[1:02:07] right now because I'm I'm going to
[1:02:09] preach for another
[1:02:12] hour I'm waiting for the second wind to
[1:02:15] come
[1:02:16] amen because I can see you dying
[1:02:19] out but you know a boxer he continues
[1:02:22] continues but then they get a second win
[1:02:25] so if you're about dying out now I'm
[1:02:28] going to preach until the second wind
[1:02:29] comes into
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:32] you but you preaching so hard you want
[1:02:34] me to get involved in the things of God
[1:02:37] that's what you're asking me to do
[1:02:39] you're telling me to take my
[1:02:44] place so what am I telling you you
[1:02:46] better start saying amen others I'm
[1:02:47] going to continue
[1:02:49] you the second win better come in the
[1:02:52] next
[1:02:53] minute
[1:02:56] amen turn to your neighbor and say come
[1:02:58] on unless we can do this we can do this
[1:03:00] we can finish
[1:03:01] it hey because now if you left the roast
[1:03:04] in the oven I burnt roast you're going
[1:03:06] to go up
[1:03:09] to amen this is more important than
[1:03:12] lunch right now right
[1:03:14] amen because this what I'm telling you
[1:03:16] Mark 11:23 even if you don't have lunch
[1:03:18] you can go home and speak it
[1:03:21] yes
[1:03:23] amen you that's a genuine thing
[1:03:26] sometimes people don't have money for
[1:03:27] lunch people don't have money for
[1:03:29] food but what I'm telling you right now
[1:03:31] is so important that you can speak it
[1:03:33] into existence amen because the
[1:03:36] authority of Mark 11:23 is in
[1:03:39] me
[1:03:40] amen amen you see until he stops calling
[1:03:43] the Pentecostal message and power will
[1:03:45] not cease what the church haded
[1:03:47] Pentecost is in a un
[1:03:50] inable that means absolute and
[1:03:52] undisputable Undisputed she had the word
[1:03:54] of power she had the word power of the
[1:03:57] spirit manifested in diverse signs and
[1:03:59] wonders gifts of the Holy Ghost right it
[1:04:01] tells you the holy the church was not
[1:04:02] organized by men led by the Holy Ghost
[1:04:04] wasn't very big it was hated and
[1:04:06] despised oppressed it was persecuted
[1:04:08] unto death but it was true to God in
[1:04:10] stayed with the original word and
[1:04:12] pattern yeah again he's telling you why
[1:04:14] is he saying so many time the true
[1:04:16] church will always try to be like the
[1:04:17] original at
[1:04:19] Pentecost the true church of today will
[1:04:21] try to appropriate the early first one
[1:04:24] and The Messengers of to the churches
[1:04:27] having the same spirit of God in them
[1:04:28] will try and approximate the Apostle
[1:04:31] Paul they won't be exactly like him but
[1:04:34] the true Messengers will be the ones
[1:04:35] that come the closest to Paul who was
[1:04:38] free of all men sold out to God and gave
[1:04:40] forth the word of God only and
[1:04:42] manifested the Holy Ghost in power none
[1:04:44] else would do it you have to work from
[1:04:47] the original
[1:04:50] am you see the true church will always
[1:04:53] be the the one that tries to follow in
[1:04:55] the steps of her Founders at Pentecost
[1:04:57] and her Messengers will follow the
[1:04:59] Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the
[1:05:01] first church
