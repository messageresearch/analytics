[2:33] sister jenzo you here back amen
[2:37] hallelujah pray the Lord will bless you
[2:39] amen
[2:41] hallelujah amen God bless you amen let's
[2:44] turn to the Bible Romans chapter
[2:51] 3 Romans chapter 3 amen praise the
[2:58] lord we can read from verse 21 but I'll
[3:01] focus on verse
[3:08] 27 but now the righteousness of God
[3:11] without the law is
[3:13] manifested being witnessed by the law
[3:16] and the prophets even the righteousness
[3:19] of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[3:22] unto all and upon all them that believe
[3:25] for there is no
[3:26] difference for all have sinned and come
[3:29] short of the glory of God being
[3:31] justified freely by his grace through
[3:34] the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[3:37] amen whom God had set forth to be a
[3:40] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[3:43] to declare his righteousness for the
[3:45] remission of sins that are passed
[3:48] through the forbearance of God to
[3:50] declare I say at this time is
[3:52] righteousness that he might be just and
[3:55] the justify of him which believeth in
[3:59] Jesus now you can see that scripture is
[4:01] packed so many things we are finding in
[4:03] Jesus there amen you're finding
[4:05] righteousness in Jesus amen you're
[4:07] finding that you are Justified you are
[4:09] redeemed through Jesus amen hallelujah
[4:12] amen we have remissions of sin through
[4:14] Jesus amen we are justified through
[4:17] Jesus then it comes through verse 7 27
[4:21] where is the boasting
[4:23] then it is excluded yes by what
[4:27] law of works so that there's two laws
[4:30] now is it the law of Works how many of
[4:33] us receive this by
[4:35] works no but by the law of Faith am amen
[4:41] the Lord had blessings with reading of
[4:42] his word amen you may be
[4:44] seated for title will speak on the law
[4:47] of Faith this morning amen praise the
[4:51] Lord hallelujah amen amen that should
[4:55] excite us because
[4:58] amen a law is a universal principle
[5:03] amen so why I'm saying it should excite
[5:06] us because anyone operating under the
[5:09] law can operate by faith amen if we can
[5:13] tap into the
[5:15] law yes anyone who applies it amen can
[5:19] have faith amen so it's not for Selected
[5:23] Few
[5:23] people amen hallelujah young and old can
[5:27] have faith am rich and poor can have
[5:30] faith amen whether you have a position
[5:32] in the church or you don't you can have
[5:34] faith amen hallelujah amen amen when God
[5:38] looks at us he looks at us Through The
[5:40] Eyes of Faith he looks at us in our
[5:41] ought to be condition amen so we praise
[5:44] the Lord for that amen
[5:47] hallelujah amen so the principle of
[5:50] Faith are based on spiritual laws now on
[5:53] the earth they are natural laws and who
[5:55] set these laws into motion is God
[5:58] Almighty amen Hallelujah when God
[6:00] created the heavens and the Earth he set
[6:03] laws into motion
[6:05] amen amen and man through time has
[6:08] stepped into God's laboratory and they
[6:11] began to discover these
[6:13] laws and then they start to work with
[6:16] these laws and by working these laws
[6:19] they are able to achieve many things in
[6:21] this life and they've gone through many
[6:24] revolutions you know that amen
[6:27] hallelujah you know brother the r and
[6:29] all of these things because they were
[6:31] working with laws and now you find one
[6:34] of the final things that they've tapped
[6:35] into is that fourth dimension the fourth
[6:38] dimension was God's Communication
[6:40] channel With His prophets they could see
[6:43] Visions amen they could see a far off
[6:45] amen hallelujah but then science stepped
[6:48] into God's laboratory and God allowed it
[6:51] that way amen so that through this
[6:54] fourth dimension is coming now amen the
[6:58] word of God but the is also not demon
[7:00] powers influencing bya this fourth
[7:02] dimension and coming through ether waves
[7:04] through your homes amen through your
[7:05] Wi-Fi signals all of it amen two Avenues
[7:09] one coming down from heaven and one
[7:11] coming from the pit of Hell right amen
[7:15] hallelujah so these are spiritual
[7:17] principle of faith is based on spiritual
[7:20] laws they work for whosoever will apply
[7:23] these laws and you can set them in
[7:26] motion amen how do we set the law of
[7:29] Faith In
[7:30] Motion
[7:32] [Music]
[7:33] amen how do we set the law of Faith In
[7:37] Motion by the spoken word
[7:41] amen amen the law of faith is set in
[7:46] motion by your mouth amen amen that's
[7:50] why it says let everything that add
[7:52] breath praise the
[7:53] Lord not let everybody everyone who
[7:57] wants to praise the Lord begin to
[7:58] imagine it just say it in your heart
[8:00] just think and rejoice inside and say I
[8:03] just want to contain this no let
[8:04] everything that has bre praise the Lord
[8:06] amen you wake up in the morning and the
[8:08] birds are praising the Lord amen
[8:10] hallelujah amen yes amen animal life is
[8:14] teeming in the morning J
[8:18] do amen hallelujah they are all
[8:21] operating amen worshiping God Amen some
[8:25] of us we wake up in the morning we got
[8:26] no life we feel more tired
[8:29] amen amen hallelujah but we ought to
[8:32] Spring forth into life the first thing
[8:35] in the beginning God think on God think
[8:38] on the scriptures amen hallelujah begin
[8:41] to activate the spirit man within you
[8:44] Amen Hallelujah Lord amen amen just
[8:48] begin to say something Amen to praise
[8:50] the name of Jesus Amen at it with your
[8:52] mouth let it be the first thing you say
[8:55] let it be the last thing you do in night
[8:57] at night thank you Jesus Jesus yes amen
[9:00] amen what are you doing activating
[9:02] spiritual laws amen hallelujah we are
[9:06] having a church Quake amen what you
[9:08] begin to do amen you begin to Rattle
[9:10] Satan's kingdom every time you praise
[9:12] the Lord you rattle Satan's kingdom
[9:16] amenah amen yes so we set it in motion
[9:19] by our law the mouth by our mouths amen
[9:23] hallelujah yes amen now I want you to
[9:26] know the message of the hour has come to
[9:29] Us free yes amen we don't have to be
[9:31] bound that's right we don't have to be
[9:33] defeated amen amen hallelujah yes Lord
[9:36] we can praise the Lord anyhow amen
[9:39] whether we feel like or not amen amen
[9:42] turn to your brother and say come on
[9:43] join me praise the Lord say join me join
[9:46] me amen hallelujah tell him I want to
[9:49] hear you say
[9:51] amen
[9:53] hallelujah praise the Lord thank you
[9:55] Jesus so we know that in the natural law
[9:58] is rule with the authority of government
[10:00] behind it amen so we're talking about
[10:03] spiritual laws so the Kingdom of Heaven
[10:05] is behind God's spiritual laws amen and
[10:09] you don't dare violate it you work with
[10:11] God's laws amen you know with natural
[10:14] laws if you violate a law you can cause
[10:17] serious
[10:18] damage you can also end your life amen
[10:22] it carries clear consequences to anyone
[10:25] who violates it so a principle is a
[10:27] belief that God's Behavior
[10:29] amen but that only has a moral Authority
[10:32] behind it I'm talking about the natural
[10:34] laws they set these laws in motion on
[10:36] the earth governments put laws into
[10:39] place to gu to guide our moral Behavior
[10:42] yes
[10:44] amen but we're talking about the
[10:46] principles of faith and based on
[10:48] spiritual laws they are natural laws
[10:50] spiritual laws amen so we know that a
[10:54] law is something that has been tried and
[10:56] proved and whosoever gets involved amen
[10:59] anyone who gets involved the result will
[11:01] be the same amen you can try the law
[11:05] here in Durban you can try it in the USA
[11:07] you can try it around the
[11:09] world yes it must work the
[11:13] same amen so that means that the faith
[11:16] law there's no discrimination yes it
[11:19] doesn't work with any particular uh race
[11:21] group or particular language group amen
[11:25] it's a universally applied law yes amen
[11:29] the result will be the
[11:31] same amen so in faith there's no
[11:34] discrimination amen so the question is
[11:38] are we activating the law of faith in
[11:40] our lives are we living by faith amen
[11:45] amen because it's so easy to speak the
[11:48] negative it's so easy to speak in the
[11:50] flesh yes sometimes we forget about it
[11:53] sometimes we forget what we are taught
[11:55] but these things we need to reprogram
[11:57] ourselves amen amen sometimes you just
[11:59] need to do a good
[12:01] research amen and forget the old ways
[12:04] and just start to say Amen in school
[12:06] they didn't teach me about myself
[12:08] properly they taught me to rely on the
[12:09] five senses amen but here in church I'm
[12:12] hearing that I'm a spirit being amen
[12:14] amen amen amen and I ought to rule from
[12:18] the spirit man amen
[12:20] amen now we know there's a natural law
[12:22] called gravity amen I'm trying to show
[12:26] you here now that two laws can't be work
[12:29] at once and that one law can be more
[12:31] powerful than the other law so we know
[12:33] that the law of gravity pulls everything
[12:36] down but then there's another law called
[12:38] The Law of
[12:40] thrust so we know that a
[12:43] plane how does a plane defy one law by
[12:47] applying a more powerful
[12:51] law so on a Runway This Plane starts to
[12:54] take off with high speed thrust is built
[12:57] pressure is built on the Wings amen and
[12:59] it makes it Fly what's happening it's
[13:02] operating amen and it goes through the
[13:06] air and it's actually flying and it's
[13:09] using the air something we can't even
[13:12] see you can't see it but those wings are
[13:15] relying on the
[13:17] air amen hallelujah people wondering how
[13:21] we operating how we are functioning amen
[13:23] because faith is not something you can
[13:25] see yes amen amen amen hallelujah how
[13:30] come you are so joyful in the midst of
[13:32] uh economic depression how come you are
[13:35] so joyful Amen in the midst of trials in
[13:37] the midst of sickness in the midst of
[13:39] circumstances amen because the joy of
[13:42] the Lord is my strength I don't rely a
[13:45] natural circumstances to bring joy
[13:50] amen hallelujah whether the situation is
[13:53] good or bad I've learned to trust in
[13:55] Jesus I've learned to trust in God I've
[13:58] learn to to say praise the Lord
[14:01] anyhow amen
[14:04] hallelujah amen and the law of gravity
[14:07] sometime he trying to pull you down but
[14:09] you need to use a law of thrust yes amen
[14:12] hallelujah what does the law of thrust
[14:14] to now and the gets the engines going in
[14:17] the plane it starts to create its own
[14:21] storm starts to create its own winds in
[14:23] the air to start to give it a lift
[14:27] amen amen so what is it doing it's
[14:30] creating a storm on purpose sometimes we
[14:33] need to create an internal storm yes yes
[14:36] amen too slack too lazy we need to
[14:40] create an internal storm to be able to
[14:44] SW amen
[14:47] hallelujah praise the Lord amen so what
[14:50] happens here this plane that's operating
[14:53] now must gather speed it must gather
[14:55] speed and as it starts to approach amen
[14:58] the of that Runway the pilot must
[15:03] lift and that plane when it lifts it
[15:05] lifts the cargo it lifts the passengers
[15:08] it lifts the weight of the
[15:10] plane it lifts everything amen could be
[15:14] thousands of tons in the in the plane
[15:16] amen but H Allelujah you can't play with
[15:19] the law yeah the law must work for you
[15:22] amen amen amen hallelujah praise the
[15:26] Lord so imagine the brings it now on the
[15:30] on the runway there and he's try is's
[15:32] activating the law of lift amen he's
[15:34] going to have to maintain a certain
[15:36] speed you can't be cruising there and
[15:39] thinking suddenly you're going to pull
[15:41] up nothing's going to happen
[15:45] amen so when we approaching now
[15:47] rapturing faet to leave this Dimension
[15:50] at what speed at what altitude ought we
[15:52] to be flying amen amen hallelujah did
[15:56] you hear what I said yes
[15:59] you some of you have not been on an
[16:01] airplane I need to take you brother
[16:06] Joshua that gForce when they take off
[16:10] yeah amen hallelujah they've got to
[16:14] maintain a certain speed in order to
[16:17] reach lift off amen sometimes amen we
[16:21] are too Earthbound in life because we
[16:22] are maintaining a cruise
[16:24] mode just cruising out you know you know
[16:27] when they're backing out to get onto the
[16:29] runway it's Cruise mode they just like
[16:30] cruising until they get onto the runway
[16:35] yeah amen and when they about to take
[16:38] place or when they about to take off
[16:40] everyone must be seated yeah you must be
[16:43] buckled up what is that I'm trying to
[16:46] tie that now with a cargo in that
[16:49] container everything must be tightly
[16:51] buckled
[16:52] down nobody's standing everybody seated
[16:57] seat belt in place M amen cell phone put
[17:01] on airplane mode
[17:04] yeah and some people are really nervous
[17:08] Flyers amen hallelujah the plane is
[17:11] getting ready to take off we are getting
[17:13] ready to change Dimensions amen
[17:16] hallelujah I want you to know that the
[17:18] plane is already going because the shout
[17:20] has already come yes the plane has got
[17:22] to maintain a certain speed we can't
[17:24] slow down because of unbelief we've got
[17:27] to maintain the speed am amen because we
[17:29] want lift up amen yes Lord am amen we
[17:33] will not slow down for anybody if you
[17:35] want you can catch up but we will not
[17:37] slow down yes amen hallelujah give God
[17:40] praise amen yes Lord
[17:44] hallelujah that's right amen amen amen

[17:52] and move I don't know 35,000 ft 38,000
[17:55] ft whatever it is praise God we are
[17:57] soaring the heavenlies amen amen other
[18:01] birds may try and follow us amen
[18:03] hallelujah but they'll disintegrate amen
[18:05] other people may try to impersonate but
[18:07] they will disintegrate because they are
[18:09] not built for the laws up there
[18:12] Hallelujah they are not built to reach
[18:14] out to choth that we can go to amen but
[18:17] this is the age of the Flying Eagle
[18:19] we've been built for this time we've
[18:21] been built for the season amen spread
[18:23] your wings and fly yes Lord God thank
[18:26] you Lord amen praise the Lord yes
[18:31] amen as much as there's a law of Faith
[18:33] there's a law of fear as well people
[18:36] have fear sitting in the airplane oh
[18:39] some people they close their eyes and
[18:41] they hold on for dear life amen there's
[18:44] fear there's a lot of fear in life
[18:46] there's a lot of sicknesses come to

[26:14] we don't like the test Abraham was put
[26:16] to a test not a
[26:19] Temptation amen God was going to finally
[26:23] amen that was God taking his hand up on
[26:25] the mountain to say this is my beloved
[26:26] Son in whom I well pleased but he had to
[26:29] pass the test
[26:32] amen
[26:35] amen you know that's something there
[26:38] maybe I should drop this in
[26:42] here sometimes it's hard for fathers to
[26:44] compliment their
[26:47] sons to say son well done I'm proud of
[26:51] you learn from heavenly father he took
[26:54] Jesus up on the
[26:56] mountain and before for the witnesses he
[26:59] said this is my beloved Son

[27:17] there
[27:19] amen hallelujah
[27:22] [Music]

[27:28] and hearing from your
[27:30] father you've got to have the confidence
[27:32] of your father Yes yes the reassuring
[27:36] voice of your father that lo I Am With

[27:44] along life's journey amen
[27:47] amen amen praise the
[27:50] Lord amen so no matter what is around us
[27:54] keep the word of God near our mouth and

[27:58] now in our mouth only even in thy mouth
[28:01] and in thy heart what is that the word
[28:06] of faith which we preach amen amen amen
[28:11] amen because the word of faith will help
[28:13] you to overcome any sickness any disease

[28:19] do I use the word of God in my mouth in
[28:23] my heart and keep firing and believing
[28:25] yes amen
[28:29] amen so it's not enough to be a good
[28:32] Catholic and only repeat the word

[28:38] word and what they have this
[28:41] rosary right they say I'll keep
[28:44] repeating this word just repeating the

[28:57] confessing is one part believing
[28:59] switches it up
[29:02] amen amen
[29:04] hallelujah praise the Lord so it's not
[29:07] enough to only speak the word it's more
[29:08] about believing when you're believing
[29:10] you're firing that engine and somebody
[29:12] comes to you and speaks the opposite of
[29:14] what you are saying amen focusing on the
[29:16] symptoms you're not going to change your
[29:18] words to agree with them you're going to
[29:20] keep firing the word of God by the
[29:22] stripes of Jesus I am healed I don't
[29:24] care what you're saying amen hallelujah

[31:24] tablets a day and he says I'm battling
[31:26] to sleep at night I don't know what to
[31:27] do I can't even

[31:55] somehow the Lord allowed that to happen
[31:57] happen amen the prayer so you can hear
[32:00] the words that are praying and I'm
[32:01] telling him before I pray I said you
[32:03] believe God can give you a new lungs
[32:05] amen amen you remember we were preaching
[32:06] on that yes now God doesn't prepare you
[32:08] for something without putting you
[32:10] through it we've been through it in the
[32:12] church we taken you through all the
[32:14] quotes but here now God presents you
[32:16] with the situation amen what are you
[32:17] going to do
[32:20] yes amen so you can hear me saying in
[32:23] the video there if you believe God can
[32:25] give you new lungs and then I told him
[32:28] repeat after me and we sprayed the
[32:29] prayer of faith and I told him tonight
[32:31] you're going to sleep like a baby amen
[32:34] if you can
[32:35] believe so this man is down and out he
[32:37] got no but he's a very brilliant man you
[32:39] can see he's fluent in his English and
[32:42] things he maybe taken a wrong turn in
[32:44] his life and he ended up on the streets
[32:45] there but he speaks very well amen so
[32:48] that was the last saw
[32:51] him cuz he went
[32:54] away and then last Saturday we were out
[32:56] there there at the next picture we were
[33:00] out near check saave you know where
[33:01] check saave is
[33:03] there different location and we were
[33:05] busy over there now this is the man same
[33:09] man but you can see he looks
[33:10] different this is like a month
[33:13] later so we're busy over there and I see
[33:16] him running towards me and he grabs my
[33:20] hand and he says it worked it worked
[33:22] amen amen amen yes Lord amen
[33:28] hallelujah thank you Jesus now remember
[33:32] he's homeless I don't have a cell phone
[33:33] to keep encourag him so I took him on I
[33:36] said tell me what your testimony he says
[33:38] he went back home that night amen thank
[33:41] you Lord he went back home that
[33:44] night and he said Lord I don't know who
[33:46] that man is but he began to teach me
[33:49] your word and he told me if I can have
[33:51] faith to believe amen that you are able
[33:53] to heal my lungs amen he said Lord I
[33:56] don't these are words now he said Lord I
[33:58] don't want to put you through a test but
[34:00] if that was really you won't you come
[34:02] and touch me you see the prophet says
[34:06] sometimes in a prayer line because of
[34:07] his Divine gift the Christian he says a
[34:09] Christian woman or a man can pass
[34:11] through the prayer line and they never
[34:12] have faith they think they have
[34:15] faith but what they have is an
[34:17] intellectual conception of Faith he says
[34:19] but yeah maybe a woman of the street
[34:21] will come she's got nothing else she can
[34:22] only hold on to faith and he says There
[34:25] She Goes by receiving it yes amen amen
[34:28] am amen so I never saw him for a month
[34:32] he comes and he telling me it's worked
[34:33] it worked he tells me he went home and
[34:35] he prayed and he told the Lord if it's
[34:37] you he's saying the next thing he knew
[34:39] he woke up in the morning and he slept
[34:41] like a baby give the Lord
[34:44] a then I asked him what about the tablet
[34:46] he's saying I never had to take another
[34:48] tablet praise the Lord praise the Lord
[34:51] now I'm asking you did God give him new
[34:53] lungs
[34:55] yes amen yes Lord who is able to do this
[35:00] amen he is able to do exceedingly
[35:02] abundantly above all that we could ask
[35:04] or think amen if thou can believe all
[35:07] things are possible
[35:10] amen amen thank you God will vindicate
[35:15] what we are preaching amen yes God will
[35:18] back it up yes amen and if the people
[35:22] that's in the confines of the message
[35:24] will not accept it and believe it God
[35:26] will find people that he needs to
[35:28] minister to amen but you got to know
[35:30] what you're talking about you got to
[35:32] have something to give amen I'm asking
[35:35] you how is your drink offering being
[35:36] poured
[35:37] out yes it's not for you to keep taking
[35:40] in how is your drink offering being
[35:42] poured out yes Peter and John there you
[35:45] know they in Acts chapter 3 what do they
[35:48] say such as I have give I unto thee you
[35:53] must have something to give it
[35:55] out
[35:57] I don't believe God is prepping Us in
[35:59] this place and this time and season for
[36:01] us to keep it for
[36:03] ourselves because you know your needs
[36:05] are really limited amen don't keep it
[36:08] when you get really old and you're sick
[36:10] then you want to pull out your
[36:12] faith eternal life is living for others
[36:15] yes yes amen let's go to the first slide
[36:19] that when to get the quote in amen cuz I
[36:22] want to remind you this we got to come
[36:24] back to the sincerity of the word amen
[36:27] right and believe that God can vindicate
[36:30] himself not vindicating me now this is
[36:33] Glory goes to God if I could heal anyone
[36:37] I I definitely would heal them I can't
[36:38] heal anybody amen all I can do is
[36:41] activate your
[36:44] faith but you know the prophet says
[36:46] you've got to have confidence in the man
[36:48] preaching he says if you don't have
[36:50] confidence in the man preaching God
[36:51] won't be able to do anything for you
[36:53] because God uses man that's his Avenue
[36:57] okay next one you see sincerity and
[37:00] sacredness now I'm I'm putting this
[37:02] again here for a
[37:05] reason five good people really filled
[37:08] with the spirit will do more in Phoenix

[37:14] you're consecrated to God in a sincere
[37:17] life amen amen praise the Lord read that
[37:21] aloud brother rames read that
[37:23] again that's where sincerity and in
[37:27] sacredness five good people really

[37:32] Phoenix than all the members we've got
[37:35] if they are consecrated to God in a
[37:37] sincere
[37:40] life the first five ANS let me see them
[37:45] amen amen I'm in that number amen yes

[38:03] the assembly thank you Lord I didn't
[38:05] even know I never saw
[38:07] her but I believe she told my wife after
[38:10] the service she showed her the book and
[38:11] said I got it from Autumn
[38:14] yesterday praise the Lord now what is
[38:16] that it's God waiting there to be able
[38:21] maybe we never got a single other person
[38:22] to come but yes s to Michelle with the
[38:24] children let's give the Lord a good an
[38:26] of praise I believe God is going to give
[38:27] something good there amen amen I was
[38:31] telling you about this woman and the
[38:32] eggs she went to prepare the eggs again
[38:35] and she went back to her husband to give
[38:37] it to him why she knew something about
[38:39] atmosphere she knew something about her
[38:41] life lived yes she knew not to stoop
[38:43] down to that level but to live the life
[38:45] of Christ what
[38:48] happened when the friends saw this woman
[38:51] singing must Jesus bear the cross alone
[38:54] and all the world go free he says no
[38:57] there's a cross for you there's a cross
[38:58] for
[38:59] me amen amen those three men got on the
[39:03] floor crying weeping they said we want
[39:06] this God that you serve amen hallelujah
[39:09] amen we want this God you serve oh yes
[39:13] SL probably some other woman would have
[39:15] grabbed him by his hair and told him not
[39:17] eat from the floor
[39:20] there hey
[39:23] no the life of Jesus Christ amen being
[39:27] lived amen praise the
[39:30] [Music]
[39:33] Lord so faith is the one will liftt you
[39:35] up when you are down when you're praying
[39:38] and praying and praying within and and
[39:40] you're praying and trusting God don't
[39:41] have anxiety when you
[39:43] praying you can't mix these two laws
[39:46] together the law of fear and faith you
[39:49] can't mix
[39:51] anxiety and I also want to tell you you
[39:53] can't stop thoughts from coming into
[39:55] your head but remember remember that's
[39:56] Satan's playground don't think you are
[39:59] defeated just because thoughts are
[40:00] coming in your head the prophet says
[40:02] don't let the thoughts settle yes keep
[40:05] the word of God in your heart the word
[40:07] in your mouth the word is neither even
[40:08] in thy mouth and in thy heart amen keep
[40:12] the word there
[40:15] amen amen you can know the word up here
[40:18] but that doesn't affect
[40:21] anything the spiritual law is applied
[40:23] when you keep it CH amen and you Holding
[40:26] On by faith amen hallelujah so when you
[40:30] when you start to learn the spiritual
[40:32] law and how it operates now you can say
[40:35] I'm ready for liftoff my engines are
[40:36] firing amen you're speaking the word
[40:38] with boldness you're speaking the word
[40:40] with confidence without wavering without
[40:42] doubting now you know your flight is
[40:44] sure to take off
[40:46] am
[40:48] amen now brother Cale probably can teach
[40:51] you that if you don't study a certain
[40:53] law it can cost you your life
[40:56] if he didn't study the laws surrounding
[40:58] electricity ask him how dangerous it is
[41:00] to touch a live
[41:03] wire
[41:05] amen so you got to be able to study the
[41:08] law first yes amen learn how it
[41:12] operates amen otherwise if you don't
[41:15] know how to handle it it will cause
[41:17] great damage yes demons will start to
[41:19] make you
[41:21] run amen you'll get an electric shock
[41:24] but when you're operating on the law of
[41:26] Faith amen you can't for a moment stop
[41:28] because the law of faith is active amen
[41:31] amen it's an active Force the Holy Ghost
[41:34] is an active Force yes it's a pulsation
[41:37] in our
[41:38] souls amen you you you're are beside
[41:42] yourself amen you're constantly living
[41:44] in this world of perfect Faith you can't
[41:47] stop thinking about the Lord Jesus
[41:48] Christ amen amen amen can I get a
[41:51] witness here you can't stop thinking
[41:53] about the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[41:55] hallelujah amen you become a fanatic you
[41:58] become thinking hey maybe something has
[42:00] gone wrong with me amen hallelujah
[42:03] amen so we here we have good people in
[42:06] Phoenix that's consecrated to God in a
[42:09] sincere life amen hallelujah
[42:13] [Music]
[42:14] amen so don't just repeat the word here
[42:16] now what I'm saying to you how is the
[42:19] spiritual law activated this is a very
[42:21] important concept now
[42:23] because when you reading Hebrews 11 then
[42:25] it tell tells you Faith cometh by the
[42:28] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[42:32] you ever understand how that
[42:35] works faith comes by
[42:37] hearing hearing by the
[42:42] word
[42:44] amen so not necessarily you hear
[42:47] something 100 times that faith
[42:53] comes I'll take the slow now where is is
[42:56] the word in your mouth
[42:58] and so the word in your heart faith
[43:01] comes by the hearing that's one hearing
[43:04] and hearing by the word what happens the
[43:06] word speaks back to you yes amen the
[43:10] word speaks back to you
[43:13] amen when that word is speaking back to
[43:15] you now you're not taking the Faith from
[43:18] the outside yes you're taking the Faith
[43:21] from the inside
[43:22] amen amen give God praise for that amen
[43:26] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so now
[43:30] what is happening I'm speaking words and
[43:32] receiving not from your external years
[43:34] only but faith is coming from the from
