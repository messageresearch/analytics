[7:05] I know we're almost at church
[7:08] but we're happy to have them back this
[7:10] morning amen and we're going to do the
[7:12] baby dedication this morning
[7:14] hallelujah amen if we can just start to
[7:17] mark this is not our scripture reading
[7:21] but before we read that let's turn to
[7:22] Psalms 128 from verse 1.
[7:27] [Music]
[7:34] amen
[7:41] all right
[7:44] amen Psalms 20 128 and verse 1 reads
[7:47] amen
[7:49] blessed is everyone that fear of the
[7:51] Lord
[7:52] that walketh in his ways for Thou shalt
[7:55] eat the labor of thine hands
[7:57] happy shall thou be and it shall be well
[8:00] with thee
[8:01] thy wife shall be a fruitful Vine by the
[8:04] sides of that house
[8:06] thy children like Olive plants round
[8:08] about thy table
[8:10] behold that thus shall the man be
[8:12] blessed the fear of the Lord the Lord
[8:15] shall Bless The Art of Zion and thou
[8:17] shall see the good of Jerusalem all the
[8:19] days of thy life yea Thou shalt see thy
[8:22] children's children and peace upon
[8:25] Israel amen what a glorious blessing
[8:28] amen now I don't want my wife to be
[8:30] scared when I read thy wife shall be a
[8:32] fruitful Vine by the size of that house
[8:36] amen the Lord has blessed us with three
[8:38] beautiful children and we want to return
[8:40] praise and honor to God this morning
[8:42] amen for a beautiful gift he's given us
[8:44] amen and that's what the dedication is
[8:46] to return the gift back to God Amen
[8:50] so the baby's name is
[8:53] amen and Everlast is the Hebrew origin
[8:57] it comes from the word Ari or Ari
[9:00] meaning lion and L meaning God
[9:03] so it means Lion of God Amen so in the
[9:06] Bible it was uh we don't know if it was
[9:09] I think it's a gender Mutual name but it
[9:11] was the son of God which was Jacob's
[9:14] first son
[9:15] amen ever lie so Ella is derived from
[9:18] the Hebrew element of L meaning God
[9:22] so Ella means God is my light amen so we
[9:25] got light of God and God is my light and
[9:28] Gengar means
[9:29] King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[9:31] whatever you want to make it means amen
[9:35] amen hallelujah because again is Christ
[9:37] in this hour
[9:39] Moses was Christ
[9:41] David was Christ
[9:46] I'm telling you gengan is Christ
[9:49] amen God bless you let's turn to Mark
[9:52] chapter 10 amen
[9:56] if the grandparents want to come and uh
[9:58] you're more than welcome let's call the
[10:00] grandparents forward and come stand here
[10:02] we'll get some pictures amen
[10:05] Hallelujah
[10:06] I was telling brother Joshua the other
[10:08] day
[10:09] about a year and a half ago
[10:12] I stood at a bedside and watched life
[10:15] leave a body
[10:18] and about four weeks ago or just three
[10:21] and a half weeks ago I stood at another
[10:23] bedside and watched life into her body
[10:27] and throughout the entire birth process
[10:29] when Carol mentioned to labor I could
[10:32] only think of things that are to be
[10:34] and who is this Melchizedek because he's
[10:38] teaching us how life comes into the body
[10:41] he's telling us how there's a spirit
[10:43] waiting to meet that body yes and when
[10:46] the baby takes that first breath Spirit
[10:48] enters their body so while Cameron was
[10:50] going through all the pain and the
[10:52] suffering I was just
[10:53] trying to understand what's going on in
[10:55] spiritual realm right there and I didn't
[10:57] want to miss that opportunity and it was
[11:00] a beautiful moment amen Mark chapter 10
[11:02] verse 13 says and they brought young
[11:04] children to him that he should touch
[11:05] them and his disciples rebuked those
[11:08] that brought them
[11:10] but when Jesus saw it it was much
[11:12] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[11:15] little children to come unto me and
[11:18] forbid them not for of such is the
[11:20] kingdom of God
[11:22] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[11:25] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[11:28] little child he shall not enter therein
[11:31] and he took them up in his arms
[11:33] put in put his hands upon them and bless
[11:37] them so the property is so bad in the
[11:40] Bible they brought little children to
[11:41] Jesus that he might bless them and he
[11:43] put hands upon them and we do the same
[11:46] he says we continue to do that let's
[11:48] just think bring them in bring them in
[11:55] bring them in from the fields of sin
[12:01] bring them in bring them in bring the
[12:08] little ones to Jesus
[12:12] [Music]
[12:26] can we bow heads together
[12:29] how much gracious God and Heavenly
[12:32] Father
[12:33] we stand the Lord with this precious
[12:35] gift in our hands
[12:37] Lord we stand your honor father that you
[12:39] have entrusted us
[12:41] precious little gift to God
[12:43] Lord truly we can say Lord From the
[12:45] Bottom of our hearts that you give and
[12:46] you take away your lord
[12:48] and father even as you have given us
[12:50] Lord appearance this precious little
[12:52] gift to the ways in the admonition of
[12:54] Jesus Christ will God I pray you'll help
[12:57] us to be faithful parents about Jesus to
[12:59] raise up and nurture father in the
[13:02] atmosphere of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[13:06] Lord even as you said mother is the
[13:07] First Gospel Lord Jesus Lord to raise
[13:10] the child or teach the child away from
[13:12] the Lord we pray Lord that you bless
[13:14] Karen the Lord Jesus we thank you Lord
[13:16] for your hand upon her during the birth
[13:18] of God and Lord for giving us safe and
[13:20] successful delivery Lord Jesus we thank
[13:23] you for good health upon the Lord amen
[13:25] we also thank you for the baby Lord of
[13:27] Jesus the baby is in perfect helpful God
[13:29] Amen may you continue to be with all the
[13:32] days of our life may you be a protection
[13:35] yes Father we live in a wicked and an
[13:38] evil generation Lord but I pray O Lord
[13:40] that you will keep our Lord from every
[13:42] evil arm and danger father and may Lord
[13:45] you always look to you father as you
[13:47] always put you first in your amazing
[13:50] and Lord even as we read that scripture
[13:52] father Lord that they brought little
[13:54] children into you alone and father if
[13:56] you were here we would place that into
[13:57] your hands Lord Jesus but we stand here
[14:00] as representatives of you Lord Jesus and
[14:02] we come to you now father presenting her
[14:05] to you Lord Jesus we pray Lord that you
[14:07] would continue to be with the Lord may
[14:09] she grow in Grace Lord Jesus and keep
[14:11] the Lord in health of God and Father
[14:13] whatever the Satan may come to try and
[14:16] bring his schemes Lord we curse and we
[14:18] bind those schemes in our mighty name of
[14:20] Jesus Lord Jesus and we ask him to take
[14:22] his hands off of God's Property Lord
[14:24] Jesus
[14:26] into your hand and we dedicate him into
[14:29] your hand Lord for a life of service in
[14:31] your kingdom Lord we dedicate our life
[14:34] Ela Gengar in the name of our Lord and
[14:37] Savior Jesus Christ with much
[14:39] Thanksgiving in our hearts amen
[14:45] yes
[14:53] [Music]
[15:18] foreign
[15:45] but it's one of the most beautiful
[15:47] feelings amen
[15:49] hallelujah and and unless we come like
[15:52] babes in Christ
[15:53] amen Christ wants to Hold Us in his
[15:55] bosom amen so amen let's stand for the
[15:58] reading of the word this morning
[16:01] for a little title will speak on Queen
[16:03] of Queens
[16:04] amen
[16:10] he's the king of kings
[16:12] and he has a wife
[16:14] so if he is the king of kings then we
[16:16] must be the queen of Queens amen
[16:18] [Music]
[16:22] Hallelujah
[16:24] amen let's turn to our Bible Esther
[16:26] chapter 2 verse 15.
[16:34] Esther chapter 2 and verse 15.
[16:37] now when the turn of Esther the daughter
[16:40] of Abby Hale the uncle of Mordecai which
[16:43] had taken her for his daughter
[16:46] was come to go in unto the king
[16:49] she required nothing but what a guy the
[16:52] King's chamberlained The Keeper of the
[16:54] woman appointed
[16:57] Hallelujah now we've got to see
[16:59] ourselves in that time
[17:01] we required nothing
[17:03] but what the seventh angel messenger had
[17:06] told us
[17:07] and yes to obtain favor in the sight of
[17:10] all them that looked upon her
[17:13] amen and this bride in this hour has
[17:17] favored
[17:18] so Esther was taken now not only did she
[17:21] find favor with all that looked upon her
[17:26] so remember she required nothing now she
[17:28] comes into the king's presence
[17:30] so Esther was taken into King azerus
[17:34] into his house Royal in the 10th month
[17:37] amen hallelujah notice now the scripture
[17:41] amen it's put them mathematically yes
[17:44] Revelation 10 7 is put them
[17:46] mathematically in order
[17:48] when John was writing Revelation 10 he
[17:51] didn't number it but God and the
[17:53] inspiration when they were numbering the
[17:55] Bible they numbered 10-7 so in the 10th
[17:58] month she was brought into the house
[18:00] which is the month of in the seventh
[18:03] year of his Reign
[18:06] Amen in the seventh year in the seventh
[18:09] Church age of the reign of Christ
[18:12] um this queen was brought into the house
[18:15] and the King loved yesterday above all
[18:18] the women above every denomination amen
[18:22] and she obtained grace and favor in his
[18:27] sight more than all the virgins
[18:30] so that he set the Royal Crown upon her
[18:32] head and made a Queen instead of vashti
[18:37] then the king made a great feast unto
[18:40] all his princes and his servants even
[18:42] Esther's feast and he made a release to
[18:46] the provinces and gave gifts according
[18:49] to the state of the king and when he
[18:52] ascended on high he gave gifts unto men
[18:55] amen now what she required nothing let's
[18:58] just turn to First Timothy verse 2 and
[19:01] 9.
[19:02] Amen to see the kind of
[19:06] desire that Queen Esther had
[19:09] it says in like manner also that women
[19:12] Adorn themselves in modest apparel
[19:16] would shame facelessness and sobriety
[19:19] not with braided hair of gold or pearls
[19:22] or costly array
[19:24] but which becometh woman professing
[19:26] godliness with good works let the woman
[19:29] learn in Silence with all subjection but
[19:32] I suffer not a woman to teach no serp
[19:35] authority over the man but to be in
[19:38] silence amen may the Lord a blessing
[19:40] should reading of his word you may be
[19:41] seated
[19:43] so queen of Queens the one who's married
[19:46] to the King of Kings
[19:47] we'll go to our first quotation which is
[19:50] found in
[19:51] Amen in the in the bridge message
[19:54] we find that the prophet is saying in
[19:56] paragraph 228 the lamb is the only
[19:59] mediator
[20:01] he was the one that came forth but what
[20:03] did he do now he's been back there
[20:06] interceding until his blood at a tone
[20:08] for every person and the lamb now knows
[20:11] what's written in the book he note from
[20:14] the foundation of the world their names
[20:17] were in there he stood back here
[20:20] and then the mediatorial work till
[20:23] everyone that's put in the book has been
[20:25] redeemed and it's finished now he walks
[20:27] out he's done the Kinsman walk he knows
[20:30] the Kinsman work was to testify before
[20:33] the elders
[20:35] you remember Boaz ticking off his shoe
[20:37] and so forth he has done all this now
[20:39] now this is the point I want to get to
[20:42] he says now he comes to take his bride
[20:45] so when he's coming in Revelation
[20:47] chapter 5 he is coming to take his bride
[20:49] he says amen he comes now as king he is
[20:54] looking for his Queen amen
[20:57] he says amen amen in this book is the
[21:00] old secret of it wrapped up around Seven
[21:04] Seals Seven Seals waiting for him to
[21:07] come
[21:08] amen now this Bride is a virtuous bride
[21:13] amen virtues mean that she is honest she
[21:17] is courageous she is compassionate she
[21:20] has generosity
[21:22] she has fidelity
[21:25] she has Integrity fairness amen and she
[21:28] has Prudence like the Bible tells us in
[21:31] Proverbs 31 that a husband is known in
[21:34] the gates
[21:36] didn't we just read the Kinsmen work
[21:38] that he was known in the gates
[21:41] the Bible says he's known in the gates
[21:43] ways centered amongst the Elders of the
[21:46] land
[21:46] and she make it fine linen and sell it
[21:49] yet she delivereth girdles unto
[21:51] Merchants strengthen honor our clothing
[21:54] she shall rejoice in time to come
[21:58] she opened her mouth with wisdom
[22:01] and in a tongue is the law of kindness
[22:03] should look it well to the ways of our
[22:06] household and he did not the bread of
[22:08] idleness
[22:09] amen the king's household is on the
[22:12] earth now
[22:14] amen
[22:15] Jesus prayed let thy kingdom come
[22:18] let thy will be done
[22:20] amen so the kingdom of God we must look
[22:24] well upon his household
[22:27] amen he says eat not the bread of
[22:30] idleness
[22:31] a children rise up and call her blessed
[22:34] a husband also and praise with her many
[22:37] daughters have done virtuously but thou
[22:40] excels them all favor is deceitful and
[22:44] beauty is vain but a woman that filled
[22:47] the Lord she shall be praised give us
[22:51] the fruits of her hands and let your own
[22:53] words praise her in the gates
[22:56] now we know that marriage on the earth
[22:58] is a type of the Heavenly marriage
[23:00] between Christ and the church amen now
[23:04] in the natural marriage you'll find the
[23:06] prophet is telling us that a decision
[23:08] has to be made
[23:10] yes a young lady has to make a decision
[23:14] you young ladies that are unmarried one
[23:16] day you will have to make a decision
[23:19] some guy is going to approach you
[23:22] and ask you for your hand in marriage
[23:25] before that there may be other flirters
[23:27] come along
[23:28] other people who just want to maybe get
[23:31] to know you and maybe just kiss you a
[23:33] little bit and just hold your hand a
[23:35] little bit
[23:36] but you have a sacred virtue that's
[23:39] that's been entrusted to you
[23:41] that you have got to be virtuous and
[23:44] true to your husband even before you are
[23:47] married
[23:48] the same way the church
[23:50] amen so
[23:52] she has to make a decision whether she
[23:55] wants this young man
[23:57] and the young man has to make a decision
[23:59] whether he wants the young woman
[24:02] and the prophet says she must be the
[24:05] only woman in the world that you love
[24:08] and he must be the only man
[24:12] now that doesn't fade after you get
[24:14] married
[24:16] after five years
[24:19] after 10 years
[24:21] after 20 years she must still be the
[24:24] only woman you love
[24:27] oh I was expecting a stronger amen than
[24:29] death
[24:32] he must still be the only man that you
[24:34] love
[24:36] I know I know after 20 years of marriage
[24:38] it's hard to remember
[24:41] the love
[24:43] now you are living by grace
[24:48] when you were getting married you were
[24:49] married in love
[24:51] now you are married by grace
[24:53] anyone ask you how's your marriage by
[24:55] grace of the Lord Brother
[24:56] [Music]
[25:00] but we should never lose
[25:04] that affection for one another
[25:06] we should always be in love with one
[25:08] another and you know you know when when
[25:10] there's a distance being created between
[25:12] you and your wife
[25:14] anyone knows what stonewalling is you
[25:17] know when we stone wall one another
[25:19] you walk past like trains going past
[25:21] each other
[25:23] but let love abound
[25:26] disagreements will come
[25:30] amen but love will cover a multitude of
[25:33] sin
[25:34] amen hallelujah
[25:37] so remember that she must be the only
[25:40] woman you love and he must be the only
[25:42] man that you love and the prophet says
[25:45] it's the same way making a decision for
[25:47] Christ the first thing you have to do is
[25:49] make up your mind whether you're going
[25:51] to serve God and take him as your savior
[25:54] or you're not going to do it yes
[25:57] yes are you going to serve the world or
[25:59] are you going to serve Christ you have
[26:01] to make up your mind
[26:03] there has to be a decision made and
[26:06] after the decision is made the prophet
[26:08] says that engagement comes
[26:10] amen then you find that at the altar you
[26:13] make an engagement before that before
[26:15] this Union can be and that's the way
[26:17] it's what Christ Church has to be an
[26:19] engagement a pledge because you ain't a
[26:22] love of fear beautiful after that this
[26:25] promise is made
[26:27] For Your Precious Love
[26:29] climb the highest mountain
[26:33] now you can't climb up the bank
[26:35] when she tells you to weed the garden
[26:38] For Your Precious Love I'll swarm the
[26:41] deepest sea
[26:43] but you can't get a glass of water when
[26:45] she asks you
[26:47] hey
[26:49] there's got to be promises
[26:51] one another
[26:53] I want to tell you this morning
[26:56] your vowels until death do your part
[26:59] and it's a man's responsibility to
[27:01] provide for the home
[27:04] yes I know we are living in times where
[27:06] economic conditions are difficult and
[27:08] the wife has to work to assist the
[27:09] husband but the primary responsibility
[27:12] lies with the husband to take his
[27:14] responsibility and be a provider at home
[27:18] and that doesn't change as the years go
[27:20] on yeah
[27:25] amen
[27:26] she you have a responsibility to take
[27:29] care of your children don't let other
[27:31] men take care of your children
[27:34] if you have been praying for a job value
[27:36] the job that God has given you
[27:40] the moment people get jobs the next week
[27:42] they're complaining about the job
[27:45] but a week before they were fasting and
[27:46] praying
[27:48] Lord make a way for me give me this job
[27:52] they are quoting scriptures Lord I speak
[27:55] to this mountain
[27:57] now when the job is given to them
[27:59] they're lazy
[28:02] lazy do not want to work
[28:05] the Bible goes on to say if a man
[28:07] doesn't work he shouldn't eat
[28:09] en amen amen
[28:11] amen and I want to also emphasize that
[28:14] that promise and that responsibility is
[28:17] also till dead to your part amen
[28:22] amen
[28:24] what are we saying Christ is a great
[28:27] responsible provider
[28:30] he takes care of all of our needs
[28:32] according to his riches in glory he
[28:35] doesn't let us bid for stuff that's
[28:37] right but he provides according to our
[28:39] needs and our desires
[28:41] sometimes we do not have enough is
[28:43] because we do not ask him
[28:45] but we've got to come to God by faith
[28:48] and ask of him
[28:51] beautiful and I want you to know put
[28:54] your husband under Lotus
[28:57] that I am going to ask for big things
[29:04] didn't the didn't the propheties ask God
[29:07] for big things yeah
[29:09] yeah now who now what Ephesians 5 back
[29:12] to him sisters
[29:15] when he is quoting that you must be
[29:17] submissive
[29:18] quote Ephesians 5 back to him say as
[29:20] Christ is the head of the church the
[29:22] husband is the head of the wife so quote
[29:25] Ephesians back to him and when the
[29:27] prophet says ask God for big things tell
[29:30] him honey I cannot see God right now but
[29:34] you are God's representative on the
[29:36] earth and I see you as my head so I'm
[29:39] asking you for big things
[29:44] can you have that Faith this morning
[29:46] [Music]
[29:48] amen what will it do it will put him on
[29:51] his knees
[29:53] to say Lord my wife is trusting you
[29:56] my wife has this requirement Lord won't
[29:59] you open up the windows of Heaven father
[30:01] and provide for me and my household
[30:06] you are following a divine order and a
[30:08] Divine passion and if we know how to
[30:11] walk with God's divine order and divine
[30:13] pattern then we will be blessed
[30:16] amen hallelujah he says we start to make
[30:20] promises one to another he says Twitter
[30:22] if you marry me I promise I'll be loyal
[30:25] and true
[30:26] I will look upon no other woman or I
[30:28] look upon no other man
[30:30] and I'll do a duty as a wife
[30:33] we have children it'll be my duty as a
[30:36] mother I'll be a housekeeper all these
[30:39] promises has got to be made and should
[30:41] be in a correct wedding
[30:43] if that guy's gonna make you give
[30:45] promises stay away
[30:48] children
[30:49] because your word is your bond
[30:54] if the only question he ever asks you is
[30:57] will you marry me and he's made you no
[30:58] promise
[31:00] then you can't hold him to nothing
[31:03] because even The Vow is reciting there
[31:05] somebody is forcing him to recite that
[31:06] vow
[31:08] repeat after me
[31:10] the guy probably never been to church in
[31:12] his life he's coming into the message to
[31:14] marry you
[31:16] and now the past is telling him repeat
[31:18] after me
[31:20] I am mukhu take thee to be
[31:25] and he's just repeating everything
[31:28] why he wants you
[31:32] the prophet says listen all these
[31:35] promises has got to be made or should be
[31:37] in a correct wedding come on
[31:40] come on amen he says the same way when
[31:42] you come to Christ Lord if you will
[31:44] receive me into your kingdom I promise
[31:46] there you are I love you I'll be true to
[31:48] you I'll serve you day and night
[31:51] it's too bad we forget that
[31:55] but let's come back to our first love
[31:58] let's remember the promises of God
[32:01] amen we always want to remind God of his
[32:03] promises towards us how about we
[32:06] remember the time when we promised the
[32:08] Lord that we would serve him
[32:10] when we promise the Lord if he healed us
[32:12] we would serve him
[32:15] amen
[32:16] amen he says here listen I'll serve you
[32:20] day and night I'll fast and I'll pray
[32:22] I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my
[32:25] Tidings into the straw house I'll pray
[32:27] many times a day I'll do anything I'll
[32:29] pledge all my love to you that's what
[32:32] you should do that's exactly right where
[32:34] you promised that it should come from
[32:36] your heart
[32:38] not because Billy Graham or Oral Roberts
[32:42] said come say a sinner's prayer but
[32:43] there should be a true conviction of the
[32:45] heart there should be a true repentance
[32:48] of the Soul
[32:50] amen we've got to come and he says when
[32:53] we take that pledge that's in paragraph
[32:55] 89 now if we don't become part of him
[32:58] like a woman become part of the man or
[33:01] the man part of a woman then we are
[33:03] artificial Christians amen the prophet
[33:06] will go on now to tell you that you're
[33:08] not really married to that woman
[33:11] hello
[33:13] you could have a marriage certificate
[33:16] but he said if you are not connected
[33:18] together as one he says you are not
[33:21] really married to that woman listen to
[33:24] what he says now you might be loyal
[33:27] if you don't love your husband him 60 or
[33:30] 70 years old yes to the older people now
[33:34] if you don't love your wife uh 67 years
[33:37] old and you don't love him as good as
[33:39] you did in the beginning then you're
[33:41] really just raising his children
[33:45] amen
[33:47] he says that's the way too many churches
[33:49] are we're just taking the name of
[33:51] Christian Church pretending to be bride
[33:56] when it's artificial we're not connected
[33:58] with the Christ in any way we're like an
[34:00] artificial tooth
[34:02] artificial arm artificial eye and he
[34:05] says anything artificial we're just
[34:07] putting on but we can't put on Chris
[34:09] Christianity you've got to be connected
[34:12] with it amen and that's what's the
[34:15] matter he says with the denominational
[34:16] Church they had never come into a deep
[34:18] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:20] they have not connected with him amen
[34:23] and they are artificial Church
[34:25] yes
[34:27] he says in 93
[34:29] one thing sure friends we are not going
[34:31] to deceive Christ he knows his own
[34:34] amen so first decisions next engagement
[34:37] then promise then the ceremony that's
[34:41] when the bride takes the bridegroom's
[34:43] name
[34:44] amen she is no more than of her own name
[34:48] she takes the bridegroom's name amen
[34:51] that's why I am titling it queen of
[34:53] Queens
[34:56] we have taken on his name yes
[34:59] amen
[35:02] he says when the church has the ceremony
[35:05] makes the promises then she takes the
[35:07] bridegroom's name she is no longer a
[35:09] church of the world she is the Church of
[35:12] the Lord Jesus Christ amen I mean I
[35:15] don't mean by name I mean by birth by
[35:18] Nature by power of God by the revealed
[35:21] truth of God in the heart she becomes
[35:23] the Christian church at the great
[35:25] Universal Apostolic Christian Church she
[35:28] becomes part of Christ when she does
[35:30] that Christ injects into his own Spirit
[35:33] his own life and the Bible said so that
[35:36] Adam and Eve you are no longer tween but
[35:38] one and when the woman the church is
[35:41] married to Christ they are no longer two
[35:43] they are one question you his life has
[35:46] been brought to you then you become his
[35:48] bride
[35:51] listen he's going to emphasize this
[35:53] point and we're going to hit at it this
[35:55] morning he says another thing after
[35:57] these vows have been taken the ceremony
[36:00] has said my wife's name was broy before
[36:03] she was married
[36:05] she is no longer a boy she is Branham
[36:09] now she is no more boy she is Branham
[36:13] so when you're coming to Christ you know
[36:15] more of the world you are of Christ you
[36:18] cannot for the things of the world they
[36:20] are dead to you for he that loves the
[36:23] world or the things of the world the
[36:25] love of God is not in you amen
[36:27] hallelujah now taking his name many
[36:31] people want to take his name
[36:33] that's why in the message he tells you
[36:35] Blasphemous names we have many lodges
[36:39] that just took his name
[36:42] amen but they are artificial Christians
[36:45] they just have his name on the building
[36:49] amen
[36:50] Hallelujah but he says when we take his
[36:53] name we and he injects his life in us
[36:56] what is that injection of life it's the
[36:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost let's go to
[37:00] 101 there he says you can't become a
[37:03] Christian until Christ injects himself
[37:05] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into
[37:08] you then you're connected with him
[37:11] yes amen the connection comes to the
[37:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you're no
[37:18] longer trained you are one I and my
[37:21] father one you and I are one amen all
[37:24] that was in God according to Christ and
[37:27] all that was in Christ is born into you
[37:29] his church his beloved wife amen
[37:33] and that's why we don't have an
[37:35] artificial name we know the name of the
[37:37] Lord amen some don't know the name
[37:40] they're still wondering what's the name
[37:42] so they recite something that relates to
[37:45] the name they say in the name of the
[37:47] father and of the son and of the Holy
[37:50] Ghost
[37:51] because they are not too clear what the
[37:54] name is but there's a revelation been
[37:56] given to the Bride of Jesus Christ then
[37:58] his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:04] amen now we are dead to the things of
[38:07] the world we are debt to denominational
[38:09] ideas and Creeds and dogmas we are dead
[38:12] to every tradition that comes into the
[38:14] message and we only have it here for the
[38:17] Master's Voice
[38:21] amen we are sitting with him in the
[38:23] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen we
[38:27] are a different person a different
[38:29] personality because we are becoming New
[38:31] Creation
[38:33] hallelujah thank you Lord now in 104 it
[38:36] goes on to re-emphasize us and I'm
[38:38] getting to a scripture now
[38:39] just like the woman there's no more
[38:41] broad she's a Branham she goes by that
[38:43] name
[38:45] then there's been churches churches
[38:49] brights
[38:50] but they must come one who pays his name
[38:57] amen hallelujah
[39:03] let's turn to Isaiah 4 1.
[39:08] you see what this woman were after
[39:10] Isaiah 4 chapter 1.
[39:15] some of some brothers maybe know the
[39:17] scripture of my heart because they're
[39:19] waiting for a fulfillment of the
[39:20] scripture
[39:23] amen Isaiah 1 1 says and in that day
[39:27] seven women shall take hold of one man
[39:32] saying we will eat our own bread
[39:35] and weigh our own apparel
[39:38] was the parable given to Esther
[39:43] only let us be called by thy name
[39:46] what are they after
[39:49] the name they just want to be called a
[39:51] Christian Church
[39:57] why it's a reproach
[40:01] take away our reproach
[40:04] seven women
[40:07] come through seven Church ages
[40:10] seven women claim to have his name
[40:15] but in the evening time
[40:17] it shall be light
[40:21] amen hallelujah in the evening time
[40:25] the great floodlights of Heaven were
[40:28] shown down upon the Earth and every
[40:31] denominational cockroach yet to SketchUp
[40:33] because the Rises Shine for thy light
[40:36] has come and he exposed every one of
[40:38] those churches as being spirits of
[40:40] antichrist amen
[40:43] yes amen that's right he exposed their
[40:47] skirts for the garments were spotted
[40:49] [Music]
[40:51] amen
[40:53] and he found a virtuous bride amen
[40:56] hallelujah
[40:58] he says amen listen to what he says the
[40:59] church needs he says the thing that 114
[41:02] now if she only knew it being part of
[41:04] him with his spirit in her the words
[41:06] that I do shall you do also
[41:09] believe for it
[41:11] hello the what shall I do shall you do
[41:14] also amen amen greater than this shall
[41:18] you do for God for I go unto my father a
[41:21] little while and the world me no
[41:23] more yet you shall see me for I'll be
[41:26] with you even in you to the end of the
[41:29] world then it's question you you can
[41:31] together your heirs with him
[41:34] when Esther walked into the kingdom that
[41:37] day and a title changed and a name
[41:40] changed she'd not only changed title and
[41:43] name she changed everything about her
[41:46] she was once a proper living in
[41:49] Mordecai's house

[45:39] a wife
[45:41] she's heir to all he's got

[45:50] that Jesus said all power in Heaven and
[45:52] Earth is given unto me
[45:55] now brother Caleb when you marry a
[45:57] community of property or brother Jefe
[45:59] Joshua when you married community of
[46:02] property
[46:03] and the man is there of all things
[46:06] who owns half of it
[46:10] does he need to give a concept
[46:14] I want you to go back and read Jesus
[46:17] said all power in Heaven and Earth is
[46:19] given unto me
[46:20] he was given a name above every other
[46:22] names
[46:23] amen the prophet says he was taken so
[46:25] high and placed above heavens of heavens
[46:27] [Music]

[46:32] she's heir to all he's got yeah
[46:35] yeah and so forth
[46:37] but he says and there now watch is
[46:39] giving a message of warning but if she
[46:41] goes wild she starts off on a tantrum
[46:44] she starts running off after TD Jakes
[46:47] yeah and smiley Joel
[46:52] and
[46:54] what's this guy's name
[46:56] you don't know
[46:58] good I was trying to catch you there
[47:01] you learned from the last house amen
[47:06] what's this guy's name big rabbis
[47:10] you'll see them on YouTube
[47:15] as your pastor I want to tell you this
[47:17] morning
[47:18] the red effort is not assigned to you
[47:27] I label to tell you maybe in the last
[47:28] two Services the final sign given to the
[47:32] Gentile Church
[47:35] and he typed this with Genesis
[47:38] was the back turn to Sarah
[47:40] and the discernment of Sarah's art
[47:43] and he said you're seeing your final
[47:45] sign
[47:47] let me ask you this why are we getting
[47:49] excited about rare efforts when there's
[47:50] no Temple
[47:52] yeah what are they going to do with the
[47:54] red efforts
[47:55] nothing gonna cost them more grass
[47:59] they need Temple to be restored
[48:03] there's no Temple
[48:07] that is not a sign for us to be excited
[48:09] about
[48:10] why are we going over into the Book of
[48:12] Revelation 11 and looking for signs for
[48:15] what
[48:17] people want to buy parts and this is the
[48:19] tactic of the enemy what comes before
[48:21] revelation 11.
[48:24] people not ex not satisfied with
[48:27] revelation 10.
[48:28] Revelation 10 11 says Thou must prophesy
[48:31] again amen they don't want to do that
[48:36] they do not want to prophesy again they
[48:39] are looking for a false promise rated
[48:41] for in Israel
[48:43] why don't you send funds to feed them
[48:46] keep the red effort alive
[48:51] amen not only that it becomes idolatry
[48:55] let me tell you why
[48:57] because when you have revelation of the
[48:59] word
[49:00] it becomes idolatry to now sacrifice
[49:08] right
[49:09] what they are doing God's not going to
[49:11] accept
[49:12] you think God's going to accept that red
[49:13] effort when it's finally sacrificed what
[49:15] did the Apostle Paul labor to tell us
[49:18] that the law of the sacrifice was taken
[49:20] away and by one sacrifice
[49:23] through one blood
[49:25] Christ has redeemed all men by his blood
[49:29] amen I am telling you watch it very
[49:32] carefully and I'm telling this as your
[49:34] pastor it becomes idolatry
[49:37] it becomes Baal Pagan worship
[49:41] amen
[49:42] that's right
[49:45] and I'll say it again God is not going
[49:48] to accept the sacrifice of the ready for
[49:52] because when they begin to try and
[49:54] explain it to them Moses and Elijah is
[49:56] going to tell them hey guys
[49:57] isn't that what Feast of the trumpets is
[50:00] recognizing your day and its message hey
[50:04] they're gonna he's gonna tell them you
[50:06] missed it why are you sacrifice why are
[50:08] you killing this poor animal
[50:11] amen let's get back to our message that
[50:13] was just by the way amen
[50:17] so we know amen we are taking his name
[50:19] we value the name amen now
[50:23] [Music]
[50:27] we read that okay we stopped on 115.
[50:32] 116 he says what if a woman gets married
[50:35] takes all these vows and everything
[50:38] she becomes the man's wife she's heir to
[50:41] all he's God so forth and she goes wild
[50:44] she starts off on a tantrum starts
[50:46] running after other men not only that
[50:48] she starts sharing her love with others
[50:52] a man with his wife
[50:54] all the promises that has been made then
[50:56] she goes out and starts sharing her life
[50:58] with others a love and affection with
[51:00] others he says that's what too many
[51:02] so-called Christians do sharing your
[51:04] love with the world
[51:06] what she breaks it down playing dancing
[51:08] gambling staying home from praying
[51:11] meetings to watch television all kinds
[51:13] of worldly things that took place of the
[51:15] love of God in the church's heart she's
[51:17] gone on a tantrum she's gone wild she's
[51:20] gone out after other men she's sharing
[51:22] her love
[51:23] she'll take a tithing and she'll give it
[51:25] to the church she'll spend it on other
[51:27] things out there in the world instead of
[51:30] loving God the way she should and living
[51:32] for God and loving to come to church you
[51:35] almost have to persuade her to come
[51:37] right I don't need to say more
[51:41] you know week after week how we try and
[51:43] persuade you to come
[51:44] listen to the type of woman he's saying
[51:47] that you have to persuade to come the
[51:49] woman that's gone wild
[51:50] that's gone out after other men
[51:52] he says you have to persuade
[51:55] to come to church
[51:57] let's leave that he's going to have a
[51:59] bride that hasn't got a wrinkle enough
[52:02] she's only Washed by the blood of his
[52:04] own self that's right
[52:06] see where we stand the waiting getting
[52:09] ready to come let's turn to Revelation
[52:10] chapter 19 and verse 6.
[52:22] he says then I heard
[52:24] as it were the voice of a great
[52:26] multitude
[52:28] as the voice of many Waters
[52:31] and the voice of Mighty thundering
[52:33] saying hallelujah for the Lord God
[52:36] omnipotent reigneth
[52:39] I want you to notice who is speaking now
[52:42] it's the voice of many Waters
[52:45] what does brother Brandon says it's the
[52:48] voice of the ministers
[52:50] crying out to the people
[52:52] what are they saying they further go on
[52:55] to say let us be glad and rejoice and
[52:59] give honor to him for the marriage of
[53:01] the Lamb is come Hallelujah and his wife
[53:05] had made herself ready
[53:08] and to her was granted that she be a
[53:10] raid in fine linen yeah this is Esther
[53:13] now in time clean and white for the fine
[53:17] linen is the righteousness of the Saints
[53:20] anything to go
[53:23] and he said unto me right blessed are
[53:25] they which are called to the married
[53:27] supper of the lamb and he said unto me
[53:29] these are the true sayings of God
[53:33] he says here in 172 Esther was to become
[53:36] a bride she didn't want none of the
[53:38] dawning of the world she wanted to go in
[53:41] to the king just like she was she
[53:43] adorned themselves like the Pentecostal
[53:45] or two with a Meek humble Spirit when
[53:49] all these fancy first ladies come by
[53:51] with their new Fandango things the king
[53:54] looked at them and put them in the
[53:56] chamber with the concubines
[53:59] but when this Ester coming to sight he
[54:02] got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek
[54:05] Spirit he said that's her
[54:08] go get a crown and put it on her head
[54:10] that's it
[54:12] amen
[54:14] he says let them Adorn themselves with
[54:16] that kind of spirit not only the woman
[54:18] but the men too Adorn themselves with
[54:21] that kind of spirit then you become
[54:22] ready for the bride sweet Reverend
[54:26] Esther made her heart clean
[54:30] right he says
[54:32] we have to have wrinkle removers
[54:35] to get it out of our garments
[54:38] Esther cleaned herself she cleaned the
[54:40] heart
[54:42] that's what the church need a hard
[54:44] cleaning
[54:47] brother Branham asked the question how
[54:48] do you clean your heart brother Branham
[54:50] washed By the Waters of the word through
[54:53] the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:55] Esther Purge the heart before God walked
[54:58] with a Meek humble Spirit the church
[55:00] that's going to be the bride of Christ
[55:02] Esther refused worldly adornment she
[55:05] took the spirit in her heart to go
[55:06] before the king Esther didn't want to
[55:09] Adorn herself with the modern apparel of
[55:11] the world that wouldn't look like a
[55:14] King's wife
[55:17] he says in 216 now the hour has come the
[55:21] bride has made itself ready oh made
[55:24] herself ready she laid aside all the
[55:26] things remember Esther was chosen the
[55:29] others were rejected and only those
[55:31] that's born again that's got the spirit
[55:34] of God will be chosen that day that the
[55:36] Crown of Glory will set upon ahead and
[55:39] the others will be rejected
[55:42] in 178 now in the message Israel and the
[55:46] church he says oh the Bride of Jesus
[55:48] Christ will be Mrs Jesus Christ
[55:52] Hallelujah
[55:54] baptized in his name baptized in his
[55:57] spirit in his name filled with his power
[55:59] robed in his righteousness Hallelujah

[56:05] the gentle bride in the message once
[56:08] more he says a name he says you say Amen
[56:12] name means nothing
[56:13] then why did God change Abram's name to
[56:16] Abraham why did he change Saul to Paul
[56:20] Simon's name to Peter why did he change
[56:23] his own name
[56:24] why did he change Jacob to Israel not
[56:28] until He restored the Lord not until he
[56:30] overcome now when Jesus overcome death
[56:32] hell and the grave the Bible says he had
[56:35] a new name and when Jacob overcome and
[56:37] if the church can overcome she will stop
[56:40] saying I am Methodist Baptist

[1:00:51] edifying of the body of Christ and if
[1:00:54] that is God's protection over the church
[1:00:56] if that is God's stress way that's where
[1:00:58] the attack is going amen

[1:02:15] one time Rebecca was a Barren wife one
[1:02:18] time Leah was a Barren wife one time
[1:02:21] Rachel was a Barren wife

[1:08:31] they had one from every nation
[1:08:33] represented there
[1:08:35] so there was a South African bride
[1:08:37] amen and by God's grace we are believing
[1:08:40] we are one of them
[1:08:43] look like one out of every nation I was
[1:08:45] looking at it as they passed by and seen
[1:08:47] them pass by and instead of going down
[1:08:50] they started going up amen
[1:08:55] we're going up to the high places
[1:08:59] going up to the high places amen
[1:09:05] we didn't drop off
[1:09:08] but we are going up
[1:09:10] I'm going up a Yonder
[1:09:14] to be with my Lord
[1:09:18] I noticed one of them trying two or
[1:09:21] three of them trying getting out of line
[1:09:25] I scream stay in line
[1:09:28] and the vision left me and I was
[1:09:31] standing in the room screaming stay in
[1:09:33] line
[1:09:35] Wonder Could it already be passed could
[1:09:38] the bride already be called is that what
[1:09:40] we're going through today now listen
[1:09:42] this is in the message the Rapture one
[1:09:44] of the few last messages he preached she
[1:09:47] has to be molded made into it the image
[1:09:49] of Christ
[1:09:50] that's the only thing it's in there it's
[1:09:53] in the word there cannot be anything
[1:09:55] added a woman with one hand like a man
[1:09:58] and the other woman with a paw like a
[1:10:00] dog it's got to be exactly word of the
[1:10:03] Lord like he is the word the bride is
[1:10:06] part of the bridegroom the woman is part
[1:10:08] of a husband so of course she's taken
[1:10:10] out of the husband he was taken was he
[1:10:12] part of Adam from his side and so is the
[1:10:15] bride not taken from a denomination but
[1:10:18] taken from the bosom of the word of God
[1:10:20] for this day
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:26] so who were these people
[1:10:29] they're for getting out of state
[1:10:32] was it the Press Play movement
[1:10:34] was it the two Lords movement
[1:10:37] was it the note-taking communion
[1:10:39] movement
[1:10:40] okay
[1:10:47] who was getting out of Step
[1:10:49] got the prophet at the screen stay alive

[1:11:11] have left all that we know down in

[1:11:56] our skirts with the garments of the
[1:11:58] world but we have chosen Morris the
[1:12:00] Peril of the world and we have been
[1:12:02] connected to him by the baptism of the
[1:12:05] Holy Ghost we have recognized our
[1:12:07] position and our authority to come into

[1:37:29] what happens to you in any circumstance
[1:37:32] God knows that you are the predestinated
[1:37:37] Son and Daughter of the Living God Amen
[1:37:40] so he can't lose you yeah there's it's

[1:37:46] already made it it's not something that
[1:37:48] you have to do amen God said you have
[1:37:51] already made it because he's got uh
[1:37:54] cattle on a thousand hills and you can
[1:37:56] ask anything in his name anything and I
[1:38:00] say it's like the Pastor said there's a
[1:38:03] gift out there but I want to say this
[1:38:06] the gift is right here too you know
[1:38:09] believe your past
[1:38:11] or believe the Evangelist believe anyone
[1:38:14] that stands behind the sacred desk that
[1:38:16] when he speaks the word demons are Cast
[1:38:19] Away right there and then so when he
[1:38:23] lays hands on you remember the Bible
[1:38:25] said call the Elder that's an action of
[1:38:29] Faith call me elderly you don't have to
[1:38:32] be sick you don't have to suffer all you
[1:38:35] have to do is obey the word of God Amen
[1:38:38] and when you all beat into the word of
[1:38:41] God and that's what God looks towards
[1:38:43] amen is your obedience to what he has
[1:38:46] promised and when he promises anything
[1:38:49] you can bet your bottom dollar on that
[1:38:52] and when we say about the accountancy
[1:38:55] amen the bottom dollar is the profit
[1:38:59] Hallelujah so we have eyes to see we are
[1:39:03] not blind in this real decent Church age
[1:39:05] we might
[1:39:07] have lots of money we might have big
[1:39:11] cars and houses but we need the big and
[1:39:15] lovely Lord Jesus Christ in our hearts
[1:39:18] and that's all we need amen and as long

[1:39:58] for that scissor to fall on that
[1:40:01] material where God placed it before the
[1:40:05] foundation of the world and I'm happy to
[1:40:07] be part of that material how about the
[1:40:10] baptism of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah

[1:40:18] tell somebody that Jesus Christ a man
[1:40:22] that you love him with all your heart
[1:40:23] with your mind and your soul and at the
[1:40:26] end that love will pull you through any
