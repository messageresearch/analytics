Um so a few weeks ago when pastor said u said that we must prepare our testimonies I was very excited and I was like ready for it and &gt;&gt; I even said 15 minutes [clears throat] we laugh. So uh but the devil like tried to rob me of my joy and I felt sick and two weeks I didn't come to church and then I was I used to feel very tired and I couldn't explain why and uh so I just continued praying trusting God. But last night um I was done like meeting up the house and everything. I was sitting on the city and then he said that the only thing now is to get ready for church and keep clothes ready. &gt;&gt; And then I got up and then I felt this pain in my left arm. I couldn't explain it. I couldn't move my arm. I couldn't lift my arm. I I I just don't know what was wrong. So I went upstairs, shook hands and I don't know what's wrong. I can't move my arm. And he he says, "Do you want me to massage your arm? You want a pain tablet or something?" I said, "No, no, no. I don't want anything. I'll just uh lie down in bed." And then I just said a simple prayer, you know, faith and said, "Lord, I believe in you. I believe in your word and I can't understand what's happening, but I claim my healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your name and because you said by your stripes we were &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So uh I slept I had a peaceful sleep slept through the night. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Got up this morning my entire body was beating like I was beaten up. So I said now God what is this? And uh I said I'm still believing. I'm still &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I fell on my knees and started praying and I said Lord I claim my healing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I opened my Bible and said, "Lord, speak to me." So I opened to Psalms 119 &gt;&gt; and I said, "That's like such a powerful psalm. I was so blessed reading it." And I said, "Uh, I'll continue, Lord, just receiving." So I started walking around the house and walking outside and just praying and trusting God. And then I just started feeling better. So when I came upstairs, I told her I was getting hands off the church. No, I'm not feeling well. I can't make it today. So, I was very disappointed. And then I said, "No, but that's not going to stop [clears throat] me." &gt;&gt; And then uh I just continued the day and I started feeling better and just praising God. I said, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; And I came to church and I could lift my arm [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's truly being truly being wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Amen. So, I am so excited. Jesus said, "Out of you shall come forth this wellspring of living water." &gt;&gt; I think that we don't enjoy our Christianity enough. &gt;&gt; I think that we don't enjoy the benefits of the gospel enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if we truly was enjoying it, we can't WAIT TO TELL SOMEBODY WHAT JESUS is doing for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me come down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So I can greet you properly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Daniel the second. Amen. So we pray that the Lord will bless you this morning. Amen. Good to see our brother David again. Bless you. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then let's get to our scriptures. Amen. With the sun, he sent his greetings. Amen. He sent me a message this morning. He was traveling to Istanbul. Amen. So [clears throat] we pray that the Lord will continue to bless their journey, their trip. Amen. He's just been to Turkey. So now he's been to Istanbul. And he says that he prays, Amen, for each one in the church this morning that the spirit of God will be able to bless each one. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says he's missing the fellowship. We certainly missing him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we pray that the Lord will bring him back safely even with our sister Lily. Amen. Many people not share this morning as well. Amen. We pray that the Lord will still minister to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their hearts thank you for the testimony, sister Jing. How many of you are taking what you are learning and applying it? &gt;&gt; By show of hands, how many of you have seen changes in your own life &gt;&gt; by applying the word? &gt;&gt; And how many of you have testimonies regarding that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then I want you now to not hold back the testimonies. It may be simple things like that woman whose flower kept multiplying. &gt;&gt; It seemed like a simple thing &gt;&gt; but the flower was multiplying &gt;&gt; in a horn house. &gt;&gt; So you must be able to speak these testimonies because testimonies breeds testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how it works. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So keep your testimonies alive. Do you know that's how you keep your flame alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can't you know remember the olden days people couldn't wait. You could you had to tell in Abu you testify next week. We have too many testimonies today. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And testimonies ought to be a part of our everyday life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we walk in the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We live in the supernatural. Let's read our scripture. Then you can be seated this morning. [clears throat] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's go to John chapter 7 verse 38. Amen. Our Lord Jesus is saying, "He that believeth on me," how many of you believe on the Lord? &gt;&gt; As the scripture said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. &gt;&gt; Our Lord is going to define that. Amen. As we read. Amen. We can [clears throat] maybe we read 37 there and then 30. Let's let's get to the I didn't type out all the word verses there, brother. If you can just get to that. So maybe we'll read from verse 37 there. It says, "In the last day, that great fe of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, if any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture had said, out of his belly shall flow living waters." Straight away we can see Jesus knew the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because he's quoting back scripture. &gt;&gt; Do we know our Bibles? Can we quote back scripture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here he's going to define what he means. But this speak of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified. So this river that's going to be flowing out of us is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's read also in St. John chapter 4 verse 13. We know a very popular scripture. The prophet preaches this time and time and again about the woman at the well. We'll get to verse 13 there. Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinkketh out of this water shall thirst again." Talking about the natural well of Jacob there. But whosoever drinkketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all establish that water is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we get to one more portion before you are seated. Revelation 21 and verse 6. Amen. Revelation 21 and verse 6. Our Lord Jesus still speaking to John now, but now he's in a glorified body. And he said unto me, "It is done." On the cross, he said, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; Now he's saying, "It is done. I am alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The beginning and the end. &gt;&gt; I will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may be seated. So the Holy Ghost is here to be poured out this morning and it's free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just got to have a willing heart to receive it this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So as we look at things in life, I want to remind you of what the prophet said. The prophet says that the rapture will take place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I believe between 6:00 and 9:00 some morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I just want to remind you of that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because that's our goal in sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To make this &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying between 6:00 and 9 one morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe the prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know Jesus rose between 6:00 and 9 one morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we were we were quoting this on Wednesday, but I didn't read it, but I want to read it this morning. He says, "We ought to be in action in respect to the word. &gt;&gt; God don't want people who are inactive. Yes. &gt;&gt; We ought to be in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We ought to be telling people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Signs of his coming, appearing everywhere. We see it push out in the word. We hear the HOLY SPIRIT COME TELL US CERTAIN THINGS. He's fixing to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God wants to do something, he throws it up in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He always shows it in the heavens first before he does it on the earth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now, [clears throat] we shouldn't be just drifting living life. If I come and ask you WHAT IS YOUR PLANS, WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE in life? I want you to be able to TELL ME WHAT YOUR PLAN IS, WHAT YOUR VISION IS, WHAT YOUR goal is. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be just drifting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet is talking here about somebody who had come to the house and he told his wife to fix them something to eat. And his wife was scared of the man. He said, "Don't be scared." and he fixed him and then he start to talk to him and he asked what is your plans in life? Where you coming from? He says oh nowhere. Where you going? Oh nowhere. What's your plans? Uh nothing. &gt;&gt; Uh we'll see. I want you to know WE'LL SEE IS ILLEGAL WORDS IN THE KINGDOM of God. &gt;&gt; We'll see means YOU DON'T HAVE A VISION AND A PLAN. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying again? There are certain illegal words in the kingdom. WE GOT TO SPEAK VIA THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JESUS ALWAYS QUOTED BACK THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he SAYS JUST DRIFTING. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. You never got saved just to be a church member of a church. To be a member of a church. You got saved to work. &gt;&gt; Now to work, you can't be lazy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. WE DON'T DRESS UP AN ARMY JUST TO LAY AROUND ON THE CORNER. &gt;&gt; SURE. and flirt with the girls. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, we were saying women like me men in uniform. Praise the Lord. Go ask sister Ela and Sister Jria. I mean, Sister Vanessa, they got men in uniform. Praise the Lord. But we're not here now to look pretty in our uniforms. [clears throat] We train an army to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't fight your battles. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are training an army FOR YOU TO FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS EVERYTHING WAS GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, but they had to fight for every INCH OF GROUND. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR OUR DELIVERANCE. WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR OUR HEALING. WE GOT TO FIGHT FOR OUR SALVATION. AMEN. WE'VE GOT TO BREAK THROUGH THESE DEMON POWERS AND FIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We got to keep our victory, maintain our victory. How? We fight, we overcome. &gt;&gt; So, we're not here to flirt with girls in an army uniform. We train our army to fight. We're not on a picnic. We're on a battleground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, put your sandwiches away this morning. We haven't come here on a picnic. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. WE HERE TO FIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE HAD TO DEFEAT THE enemy this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God don't use the lazy. GOD DON'T CALL the lazy. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T USE DON'T use those who are sitting around doing nothing. This is not the quote of the prophet. This is my notes. &gt;&gt; When God called David, HE WAS TAKING CARE OF SHEEP. &gt;&gt; When God called Elisha, he was walking in the field. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God called ISAIAH WAS IN THE TEMPLE burning incense, when the Lord asked, "Who can I send?" And he said, "Here am I. Send me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. OUR LORD JESUS EVEN AT 12 YEARS was at the temple saying, "I MUST BE ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS." AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Even Even when THE LORD CALLED PETER, JAMES, AND JOHN, they were WORKING IN THEIR FATHER'S BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They were about their father's fishing business. AND WHEN GOD CALLED OUR PROPHET, AMEN. He was already having healing revivals. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When he came to him in the cave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO GOD DON'T CALL THE LAZY. GOD DON'T USE THE LAZY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. I expected a better amen than that. Amen. &gt;&gt; God can't use lazy people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. EVEN JESUS SAID, "PRAY THE FATHER THAT HE WILL SEND LABORERS INTO THE VINEYARD &gt;&gt; because the harvest is ripe, but the laborers are few." &gt;&gt; Too much lazy people in the KINGDOM DON'T WANT TO WORK. AMEN. NOT EXCITED ABOUT THEIR OWN SALVATION THAT I'VE GOT TO TELL SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE man that Jesus healed, &gt;&gt; he said, "I can't sit around you."

YES. &gt;&gt; SO MAYBE THE SERMON IS NOT FOR YOU THIS MORNING, BUT I'VE GOT TO KILL THINGS IN MY OWN LIFE. [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. I'VE GOT TO RISE UP. I'VE GOT TO HAVE A HIGH AMBITION. I'VE GOT TO HAVE A HIGHER vision for myself, for the things of God, AND FOR THE WORK OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T THINK I'M SATISFIED. ASK THESE BROTHERS THAT I SPEAK TO. AMEN. I'M NOT CONTENT JUST STANDING HERE AS THE PASTOR OF THE CHURCH to preach to you EVERY WEEK. WE WANT MORE. WE WANT TO ACHIEVE MORE FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, stop using illegal words in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, maybe we're thinking what uh what is our purpose? Where are we currently now? I I've just summarized some of the thoughts the prophet had and we're going to take the highlights of his thoughts to show where we are in the message right now. This might take a few moments, but I don't want to dwell on it too long because this is not the point of my message. My message this morning, drink. We speaking about that living water. We've got to drink and push out every PROMISE OF GOD FOR OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's laying within us. &gt;&gt; But we've got to push it out of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says the message today is those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened. &gt;&gt; Which means it's green. &gt;&gt; You see them selling mangoes now. Green mangoes. Some of you like green mangoes because you make mango pickle. &gt;&gt; But that's not the state. It's end product is &gt;&gt; the end product is must lay in the presence OF THE SUN TO RIPE BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING BETTER than a ripe mango. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe you're taking something NOW. HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING this morning. You may like mango with your chili powder. You may like mango with your salt, &gt;&gt; but that's not its intended design, &gt;&gt; you've stopped the process, &gt;&gt; you've pickled it. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; It's supposed to lay in THE PRESENCE OF THE sun until it is ripe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, Amen. Let's follow his thought now. plenty green. &gt;&gt; We haven't. Now, what does green mean, brother Brandon? He's saying green means we don't have sincerity. &gt;&gt; We don't have sacredness. THE THING WE OUGHT TO HAVE IN OUR MIDST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, if eating green mango means we are not, we don't have sacredness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't have sincerity. He says, "And then you lay yourselves right in his presence and just make love to him." How do we do that? We talk to the Lord. Oh Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; Tender my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take away all the filth and the love of the world and let me live holy in this present world before you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, then he goes on to say, OUR FAITH ISN'T RIPE. SO, people have green faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is not ripe. So, is he saying you DON'T HAVE FAITH? NO. YOU GOT THE MANGO, BUT IT'S GREEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. YOU'VE GOT FAITH, BUT IT'S NOT RIPE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; INTELLECTUALLY, we're hearing THE MESSAGE OF GOD has given us &gt;&gt; and seeing the signs that he's shown us, proving it by the Bible. It's there, but all out the church needs to lay in the pres in his presence till it tenders up, you know, and get sweet in your spirit. &gt;&gt; Let's make that mango sweet. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET'S RIPEN that faith this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You can pick up the message and then let the sun now watch. He doesn't use su n there. He uses s o n BAKE ALL THE GREENNESS OUT OF YOU. SEE, MAKING YOU MATURED CHRISTIAN. GOD IS COMING SOON to receive his church. And we must have that type of Christians for him to receive. &gt;&gt; So God is NOT COMING FOR GREEN MANGO. GOD IS COMING FOR RIPE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm not calling you a mango now. &gt;&gt; God is coming for ripe mature Christians. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [snorts] Amen. &gt;&gt; The wheat has got to get RIPE TILL IT BECOMES so ripe to Christ it become bread on the table. Ah &gt;&gt; you see most people like to say we are the wheat we are the wheat. He's saying now the wheat must progress go through its process where it becomes bread on the table. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the prophet now not me. The word to be ripened in your heart to bring forth and live what we are talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm waiting for that day where I'll speak and it'll create. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when that day is now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The time is now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What's use I come to marriage supper there and I speak. &gt;&gt; What's use you sick here now but I don't pray for you now. And I come there in the marriage supper and say bro you remember you were sick there on the earth &gt;&gt; but now in your new body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no need for me to pray for you then. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Now is when we must work for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] We have a lot to cover this morning and I want to move fast. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we got to understand like we've been speaking over the last few weeks. GOD HAS DONE EVERYTHING for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's all been done. &gt;&gt; We just read how Jesus said it is done. Jesus on the cross said it is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have got to now receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. and start TO LIVE IT OUT. &gt;&gt; LIKE THAT BOY WAS PARDONED. HE DIDN'T WANT TO RECEIVE IT. &gt;&gt; Like when I'm telling you, YOU'RE WITHOUT SPOT, WITHOUT WRINKLE, WITHOUT BLEMISH. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT BLAME, people don't receive it. &gt;&gt; No, it can't be. I must still do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU'RE NOT RECEIVING YOUR PARDON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Bible in in Galatians chapter 3 THAT SAYS WE ARE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD THROUGH CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he DID EVERYTHING FOR US. IN HEBREWS 12:2 IT says we are looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him. Let's stop there. Who was the joy that was set before Jesus at the cross? &gt;&gt; He knew me when he was on the cross. I &gt;&gt; you and I were on his mind. &gt;&gt; The joy that was set before him &gt;&gt; was you. &gt;&gt; Let's understand the scripture. He's saying THERE WAS A JOY THAT WAS SET BEFORE HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The joy that was set BEFORE HIM ENDURED THE CROSS. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HE SAID A PICTURE OF HIS LOVELY WIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He saw us. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'LL DIE FOR HER." &gt;&gt; AMEN. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; Never mind. WHEN I WAKE UP 5:00 IN THE MORNING, GO TO WORK. I'm picturing my wife, swiping my card, HAPPY FOR THE JOY THAT SET BEFORE ME. I'LL ENDURE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Despising the shame. AND HE SAT DOWN AT the right hand of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the joy of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God don't like TO SEE HIS JOY LOOKING SAD THIS MORNING. God don't like your SUDDEN LOOK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; How many of you have the joy OF THE LORD? &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW ABOUT WE LET OUR FACE KNOW ABOUT IT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Come on, smile. Somebody smile. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know when you can't smile? &gt;&gt; When you're there in the coffin now. &gt;&gt; Please, you're alive now. I want to see your smile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. WE OUGHT TO HAVE JOY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE OUGHT TO BE HAPPY PEOPLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WE CAN'T BE LIKE PHARISEES JUST KEEP that so you know so reverent look. No, &gt;&gt; we can't be so heavenly minded that we know earthly good. &gt;&gt; That's correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; No earthly good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everyone afraid to come talk to you &gt;&gt; because you know you get a lecture now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's be earthly good. Let's encourage one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So we are the his victory and the reason for his death. Do you know that we are the central theme of what God is doing on the earth now? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about born again sons and daughters of God. I'm talking about the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ. You are the CENTRAL THEME OF WHAT GOD IS DOING ON THE EARTH. NOW, &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; When God is dealing with Russia, when God is dealing with Ukraine, when God is dealing there with the Pope, and God is dealing there with the USA, those are what they call them for actors. &gt;&gt; They're not the main actor. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; They are extras. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the main the main central theme &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; is you. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's put it another way. What is God's program for today? Who is walking in God's program for today? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We are working OUT GOD'S PROGRAM FOR TODAY. &gt;&gt; YES, that's right. &gt;&gt; And all the others are actors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God is going to use them soon to put a squeeze. &gt;&gt; How many of you know what a squeeze is for? &gt;&gt; Is to see what's inside. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, where is victory? REASON FOR HIS DEATH. And Christ we know is a central theme of the Bible. And right now in 2025, Christ is in me. So I become the central theme. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Christ is forming me, making me the central theme. Let's go to the court for those of you who don't believe me. He says, look, Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. &gt;&gt; So Christ lives in you makes him the center of the revelation. Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. &gt;&gt; See what God's trying to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know a lot of you like to be like the main actor. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many of you like to be main actor? &gt;&gt; You know when you went talk about when you were younger now and you watched Bruce Lee now you watch a kung fu movie. when you came out there of the movie. Now you are Bruce Lee. &gt;&gt; How many of you did that when you were &gt;&gt; amen [clears throat] look? You felt like you were Bruce Lee. Why? You saw an image that was placed before you and you wanted to be like that. Then for a little while you started that spirit got on you. You started to act like Bruce Lee until maybe your brother gave you one smack and then you came back down to being you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the point I'm trying to make is you are the central theme right now. You are the main actor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not. Amen. An extra. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the purpose of why the seals were open, if I can summarize it, is to expose the right of the enemy to show you that Satan is already defeated. &gt;&gt; To show you THAT HE'S ALREADY POWERLESS &gt;&gt; AND TO SHOW YOU THAT HE IS DEFEATED. The seals WERE OPEN TO ALSO REVEAL YOUR TRUE IDENTITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN TAKE YOU in the back PART OF GOD'S MIND AND SHOW YOU YOU ARE ETERNAL AS GOD IS ETERNAL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You know that's in the message. Amen. Hallelujah. It came now to tell you that YOU CAN OVERCOME THIS WORLD. Christ has given you the victory THROUGH CHRIST. GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seals came to REVEAL OUR TRUE IDENTITY and to break Amen. open our understanding that we were created in the image of God. And that means TO BE LIKE GOD. That means to have dominion over the earth. That means to have amenity over every circumstance, over every situation, over every sickness, over every trial. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see how the enemy was trying to whisper to suggest &gt;&gt; first he attacked her in her body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then brother Kenzo didn't want to come to church. &gt;&gt; So she could have easily said no. &gt;&gt; I'm not going today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then now what what happened? I've got this in my notes. We're going to read it now. What did she start to do? She said she started to walk around. &gt;&gt; The prophet told us we've been through this now and act like you're healed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Speak like you're healed. &gt;&gt; Believe like you're healed. And he says your body has got to obey your confession. &gt;&gt; That's what's happened today. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Your body had to obey your confession. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T CRAWL UP IN ONE CORNER THERE. NOW, OH, a nice day. I'll eat this perfect weather. This &gt;&gt; I can just lay here and sleep. &gt;&gt; Because now I got a alibi. I'm sick. Everyone can see I'm sick. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But no, faith rises above that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, we got to realize also THAT WE HAVE UNLIMITED POTENTIAL LAYING WITHIN US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We have UNLIMITED POTENTIAL LAYING WITHIN US. We know about untapped resources. &gt;&gt; But we talk about it AS IF IT'S SOME SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE UNTAPPED RESOURCES IS WITHIN US BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST IS WITHIN US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So we have unlimited potential AND OUR IMAGINATION, OUR THOUGHTS, OUR AMEN THINKING OUGHT TO MATCH GOD'S THINKING. &gt;&gt; God did not have a small imagination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now you say, what's imagination? Imagination, listen to this, is the ability to form you ideas, &gt;&gt; images or concepts of things that are not concurrently perceived through the senses. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't see it with the five senses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you ARE ABLE TO CREATE THIS IMAGE, &gt;&gt; this life in your mind, &gt;&gt; this well body. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet says, "Set your well body before you &gt;&gt; and he says, walk to it." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we KNOW THAT FAITH IS A SUBSTANCE OF THINGS hoped for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is a substance of things HOPE FOR. WHAT IS HOPE? Hope is the desire. &gt;&gt; Hope is the imagination. &gt;&gt; But just hope alone. God didn't just leave it in his thoughts in THE BEGINNING. WHATEVER WAS in his thoughts, he had to speak it AND LET IT MATERIALIZE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he SPOKE IT BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAYS IT COULD BE MAYBE A HUNDREDS AND BILLIONS OF YEARS. BUT HE SPOKE THAT WORD EXPECTING TO SEE LIGHT. When he said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." HE SPOKE HIS OWN WORDS AND HE BELIEVED HIS OWN WORDS. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SPOKEN WORDS. AMEN. EXPECT TO RECEIVE WHAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Faith is the SUBSTANCE OF THINGS HOPED FOR, THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS not seen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT DON'T LEAVE THINGS IN a hope state. START TO SPEAK IT BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; START TO APPLY IT BY FAITH. FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD. &gt;&gt; START TO TAKE ACTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Prepare for it. Amen. Hallelujah. We are we've been speaking on Wednesday. We are supernatural beings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are a being, BUT WE ARE SUPERNATURAL BEING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm not a human being. I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST living in me. The prophet says we become a twofold being. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the earth to die, but one of heaven to live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm a twofold being. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be looking at the outer senses HERE IN THE BODY THAT'S DECAYING. AMEN. BUT I'M NOT AN ORDINARY PERSON. I'M A SUPERNATURAL BEING WITH A SUPERNATURAL FAITH AND I'M OPERATING WITH SUPERNATURAL INTELLIGENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. WHY IS THERE SUCH A PUSH? ASK YOURSELF, WHY IS THERE SUCH A PUSH IN this time and season NOW FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? &gt;&gt; EVEN THEIR VERY WORD SHOWS YOU IT'S ARTIFICIAL. &gt;&gt; SO SOMEBODY TELL ME IF ARTIFICIAL MEANS A COUNTERFEIT, WHERE [applause] IS the devil? &gt;&gt; There must be supreme intelligence on that. There must [cheering] be a supreme [applause] intelligence. a super intelligence on the earth now. &gt;&gt; That's right. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD SHOWED IT. AMEN. Back then, &gt;&gt; GOD SHOWED A SIGN OF THE SUPREME INTELLIGENCE. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Show me a pillar of fire. I'M NOT LOOKING FOR THE PILLAR OF FIRE TO BE TAKEN OVER MY HEAD. THE PILLAR OF FIRE IS IN ME. AMEN. IT'S LIKE FIRE SHUT UP IN MY BONES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; People are looking for signs. Amen. People are looking FOR PICTURES AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING? They're puffing themselves up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE PREPPING THEMSELVES UP. LOOK. LOOK. THIS is &gt;&gt; Look at what what's happened. Did I jump and cause that? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm glad I caused some movement here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. People are trying to say, "Look, PICTURE, LOOK THIS. NO, I WANT TO SEE THE HOLY GHOST INSIDE of you." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW IS NOT THE TIME OF GOD ABOVE US. YES. &gt;&gt; Now we got the time of God with us. &gt;&gt; Now it's THE TIME OF GOD IN US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO WHY THE PUSH FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? ARTIFICIAL intelligence is changing the world AND IT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE THE WORLD IN WAYS WE can't even imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what they say. DO YOU KNOW EVEN THE CREATORS OF ARTIFICIAL intelligence are now the the founders of it are now sending messages to say, "Hey, be careful." &gt;&gt; Sure. It's too powerful. &gt;&gt; It's too dangerous. &gt;&gt; What it can do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Satan is always TRYING TO IMPERSONATE WHAT GOD IS DOING. &gt;&gt; Satan is not doing a new thing. You know, Satan works through science. Satan is not doing a new thing now with artificial intelligence. He's trying to copy what God is doing with supreme intelligence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. We learning these things because the prophet taught us how to think like this. He's a copycat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows that supreme intelligence is on the earth now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy GHOST IS THE DEITY WITHIN US. &gt;&gt; WE ARE AWAKENING TO OUR true potential. &gt;&gt; Why do you think HE SAYS THEY'LL STOP CANCER? &gt;&gt; Do you know that they say that artificial intelligence will be able to read your DNA and all the faulty cells, it'll be able to fix it. [crying] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what they are saying. &gt;&gt; That's right. They can fix the gene in YOU AND TAKE OUT ALL THE BAD GENES THAT YOUR CHILDREN WON'T GROW UP with these things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN ALSO FIX THE GENE THAT IF YOU WANT BLUE EYES. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Or green eyes. &gt;&gt; They can fix it and code it &gt;&gt; in the gene. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But man has stepped into God's laboratory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Man has stepped into God's laboratory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And so he knows that NOW WE AWAKENING TO OUR true potential. Let me tell you the supreme intelligence that's laying within you. You're leaving there untapped. [crying] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are living beneath our God-given privileges BECAUSE WE DON'T REALIZE THE POWER IS WITHIN US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OUT OF ME IS THROWING THIS WELLSPRING OF LIVING WATER. &gt;&gt; I NEED to drink. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know water carries pressure? Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Water is full of pressure. &gt;&gt; Carries pressure. Flowing water. Amen. It carries pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Praise the Lord. Even when you go, even in a stagnant pool, if you go to the bottom, there's pressure there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we we are looking now and we are seeing we identifying supreme intelligence is in us. We have got to learn how to operate supreme intelligence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jes, our Lord knew this. If you put up St. John 14:12 there, Jesus knew the potential that lays in supreme intelligence. &gt;&gt; That's why he says, "Amen." 14:12. [clears throat] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; St. John 14:12. Go. It's not in the notes. You can just find it on the message the search or your Bible search. He says, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." Now, most of the time we jump to the second part of this. I'm saying let's match the first part first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying the ones who believe on him. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe on him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's telling you your potential right now. The works that I do shall he do also. &gt;&gt; You mean uh Jesus healed the blind man? Yes. He's saying the works that I do, you must do also. &gt;&gt; You mean Jesus healed a deaf man? &gt;&gt; Yes. The works that he did, you must do also. &gt;&gt; You see, message people have been taught that we can't operate like this. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's something we've been told that that only the prophet could do these things. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't know where they got it because the prophet, you won't find it in the message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When it came to a one man scripture, ONLY ONE MAN could be Elijah the prophet. Yes. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. ONLY ONE MAN COULD BE Revelation 10:7, the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Only one man could be Revelation 3. Amen. The seventh CHURCH AGE MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; ONLY ONE MAN COULD BE used of God according to Luke 17:30, a son of man revealing the son OF MAN. &gt;&gt; BUT NOWHERE ELSE DO YOU FIND THE PROPHET saying that you are limited. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; He'll tell you every one of you has the authority to pray for somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord. So he says here, Amen. AND GREATER WORKS. WHY GREATER? THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO COME ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST IS SUPREME INTELLIGENCE. &gt;&gt; Please get this. &gt;&gt; The one that is coming now on the day of Pentecost, greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many of you know the things of God only get greater? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It may move in a minority. It's coming to a pyramid needle point now. But the potential that's lying there is greater potential. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's move on. Amen. So, we are talking now about this. And and like Jesus said, the spirit of the Lord is upon me. I'm going to teach you how to speak. &gt;&gt; The spirit, YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY, "THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T WE HAVE THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He had anointed me &gt;&gt; to take the book and eat the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has ANOINTED ME TO STOP SICKNESSES, TO STOP DISEASE, TO STOP CANCER, TO START HEART DISEASE, STOP HEART DISEASES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Let me preach the revelation of my faith. Amen. The spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach this year. Amen. That this is THE YEAR OF JUBILEE to open up prison doors to the whole those THAT ARE HELD CAPTIVE. AMEN. BY THE ENEMY. I am here to make the mute speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am here to [applause] make the mute speak. &gt;&gt; You say, "WHAT MUTE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" WE HAVE WE HAVE HAD TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE message that were mute. But I'm HERE TO PUT THE POWER OF GOD WITHIN YOU TO IGNITE THAT FLAME WITHIN YOU. To make people THAT HAVE NOT BEEN OPERATING THE WORD THAT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK THE WORD, I am here to make the mute speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm here TO MAKE THE DEAF HEAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN.

The prophet says when you are born again, now listen to this. Now this is the main crux of what we are saying this morning. When you are born again and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into your heart, you have everything you have need for the journey. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of is for the journey. &gt;&gt; Think of that apple seed. Now every apple it'll ever produce is in the seed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now pay attention to the words of the prophet and apply it to your life. &gt;&gt; He says everything you need. Now, he's he's not saying what you need in heaven. &gt;&gt; Everything you need for your earthly journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says he's the exhaustable, inexhaustible fountain of life. &gt;&gt; Right. When you receive the Holy Ghost, everything you've got need of between here and glory is right. Amen. In you then. M &gt;&gt; so whatever you need he says from here till the time you are taken away is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were made in the image of God. You are like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before God spoke in Genesis 1 that everything the earth, the sun, the moon and everything was all in him. &gt;&gt; Everything was in him. &gt;&gt; Yes. It existed in him in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; There was nothing out there. &gt;&gt; But he spoke it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Everything for your life's journey is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's saying whatever you need between here and glory is right in you. &gt;&gt; It ain't faith you need. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Remember the faith is green. &gt;&gt; You got the faith. It's green. &gt;&gt; You got faith. If you got the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; for he is your faith. But the thing you HAVE TO KNOW IS HOW TO USE THAT FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You've got to know how to use that faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he goes on to say, "Everything you have need of was put in you when you received the Holy Ghost for your life's journey." Notice life's journey. &gt;&gt; Pay attention because this is going to change your life. &gt;&gt; This is GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY you think. &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of when you receive the Holy Ghost for your life's journey. That's right. For your healing, for your salvation, for your joy, for your happiness. &gt;&gt; Where is it coming out? OUT OF THE SOURCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATER, OUT OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS NOW GO TO PUSHING, GO TO DRINKING, go to stirring, go to reaching out DEEPER DEPTHS, HIGHER HEIGHTS. It's all there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't NEED SOME DIVINE HEALER TO COME HEAL YOU, Sister J. Shri. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm glad the testimony came because here's a witness, right, &gt;&gt; brother Josh? What did I tell you on Friday? I said, "We have so many people sitting with testimonies here. Bear me witness." &gt;&gt; And I said, "I'm afraid because I know you come tell my wife. &gt;&gt; You'll all testify to my wife. You're raising her faith. [laughter] She tell me in the car and she tell me at home. &gt;&gt; But I want you to come here and testify." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to come here and testify. &gt;&gt; Because where where was your healing? It was in you, &gt;&gt; you had to speak it out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Brother Josh, where's your healing? &gt;&gt; In you, &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The prophet says when Satan comes with your name on it &gt;&gt; and he's got your address on it &gt;&gt; and he comes here and says, "Look, it's your name on the package. &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR ADDRESS. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST SIGN FOR IT. He says refuse to sign for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yeah, I got Charles Marimu. &gt;&gt; Say wrong person. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got WRONG PERSON. &gt;&gt; DON'T ACCEPT. SAY THAT'S NOT my name. &gt;&gt; I am Adrien Christ. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I AM ROMESH THE CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I AM JOSHUA THE CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Do you know what having the Holy Ghost means? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Christ means the anointed one. &gt;&gt; So when they got your name there attached to it, you can immediately refuse it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because when you are in Christ plus you are the married wife of the Lord Jesus Christ, you take on his name. So tell him, "Sorry, I AM YOU ARE TALKING. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DELIVER THIS PACKAGE TO SOMEBODY WHO DIED YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE OLD MAN. &gt;&gt; That's the old man." [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And even if you ACCEPTED IT, YOU CAN ALWAYS RETURN TO SENDER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; In fact, they come very quick and they return the career. They send their own career company. When you tell them you want to return it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't believe me? &gt;&gt; They are subject to your words. &gt;&gt; When you tell a demon power to go, it must go. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Jesus said, "Whatever you bind must be bound." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you loose must be loose. &gt;&gt; So say, "Come, I lose your demon power. I loose you. Come pick up this package and take it back." They must obey your words. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, let's awaken to this. Jesus said, "Whatever you loose shall be loosed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you bind shall be bound. &gt;&gt; He didn't say only here on the earth. He said whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. &gt;&gt; You see how powerful you are. &gt;&gt; Deity is living in you. &gt;&gt; But we don't operate. We don't exercise it. &gt;&gt; So he says now you don't have to you don't have to now call a divine healer to come heal you. The healing divine healing HAS ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED AT CALVARY. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, let me tell you, there are seven compound names of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you know the seven compound names? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I tell you, every everything you have need of for this life's journey can be tied up to one of those names. &gt;&gt; If you need salvation, he's savior. &gt;&gt; If you need healing, he's rafa. &gt;&gt; If you need righteousness, he's our righteousness. He's our peace. He's shalom. &gt;&gt; You can find it there. Gyra &gt;&gt; is provision under Gyra. &gt;&gt; Come on up people. I want you to work with me. &gt;&gt; Is provision everything you have need of for this earthly journey. Is it tied up under Gyra? &gt;&gt; So is that part of redemptive rights? &gt;&gt; Is that part of redemptive blessings? &gt;&gt; So is it wrong to ask for it? &gt;&gt; It's not wrong. Put up 1 Chronicles here chapter 4. Amen. Brother Josh, come. You got to walk quick today. Amen. I don't want to take them too long. Let's walk quickly here today. 1 Chronicles chapter 4. Let's read verse 9. Be a man of vision. Have vision. The if a certain allotment has been given to you, be like Jabz. Say, I'm not satisfied with this. &gt;&gt; I have high ambition. &gt;&gt; Jabus was more honorable than his brothers. His mother said, I'm going to call you sorrowful. You, I see only sorry in your life because you are what you are named. Right? You know the mothers cried out their name in birth. &gt;&gt; But now this man had better vision. He called on the God of Israel. He didn't call for Joshua and all the elders to say, "You marked out this territory. I want more land." No. He called on the God of Israel. OH THAT THOU WOULDEST BLESSED ME indeed &gt;&gt; and enlarge MY COAST. &gt;&gt; YOU GAVE ME A SMALL PIECE OF LAND HERE. I HAVE WALKED EVERY INCH OF GROUND AND MY DREAM IS TOO BIG FOR WHAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Enlarge my territory that thine HAND MIGHT BE WITH me and that thou wouldest keep me from evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that it may NOT GRIEVE ME. WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING TO BLESS ME WITH, HOWEVER YOU'RE GOING TO ENLARGE ME, &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to grieve me. I don't want this thing to hinder my faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God granted him. So if this prayer was an illegal prayer, God would never have granted him. I want you to know that praying like this is legal in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a legal transaction. &gt;&gt; And God gr Somebody read the last verse with me. And God granted him that which he requested. I'm asking you, what are you requesting from the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what we are learning everything he says it's within us. We've got to know how to reach out and drink. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you need to change that cable, maybe do that. Amen. Here's a cable out here. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "All we do is drink from the fountain of life." Where's the fountain of life? Somebody say, "The Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to drink. Where's the Holy Ghost? Somebody say, "Within me." &gt;&gt; Within me. &gt;&gt; So, I'm drinking and pushing out everything we have need of this journey. In this journey. Somebody say, "In this journey." &gt;&gt; In this journey. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about heaven. &gt;&gt; He's saying IN THIS JOURNEY. YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Maybe I'm not preaching to all of you, but I'm preaching to somebody this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm preaching to somebody because somebody has needs in this journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. All things we have need of is in him and we are planted in him and we draw from him. He's the inexhaustible fountain of life. I can't exhaust him. Right? Let's follow now and go on. is. &gt;&gt; So like Jabz, WE MUST HAVE A BIGGER IMAGINATION. &gt;&gt; WE MUST HAVE A BIGGER VISION. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WHERE THERE'S NO VISION, PEOPLE PERISH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO HE'S SAYING WE MUST DRINK MORE THAN OUR PORTION. &gt;&gt; DON'T TAKE LITTLE BIT HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; We need to take MORE HOLY GHOST BECAUSE HE'S SAYING AS WE DRAW OUT, IT'S INEXHAUSTIBLE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. drink more than it portion. AND MORE IT DRINKS, THE BIGGER IT SWELLS UP. YOU SEE PRESSURE WHAT IT DOES? &gt;&gt; Because you're drinking now from this water. It's pushing up. Pushing up. &gt;&gt; It's pushing out. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's saying PUSHING OUT THE LIMBS, PUSHING OUT LEAVES. &gt;&gt; PUSHING OUT BLOSSOMS. PUSHING OUT. AMEN. IT PUSHES OUT THE APPLES. AMEN. And that's the way the Christian is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see what this Christian is like? He's pushing it out of him. The potential IS LAYING WITHIN HIM. HE'S PUSHING IT OUT. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Do you know God wants you to be effective in his kingdom? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has designed you specifically with different temperaments and different character and different vision. Amen. To be used in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; We are not here to suppress your vision. We are here. Amen. Amen. To allow you to express THE VISION OF GOD THAT GOD HAS PLACED WITHIN YOU. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says, "We are planted together in Christ Jesus who is inexhaustible fountain of life. We are planted in Christ. We just drink, drink, and push out." Drink, drink, and push out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're saying, "What is this?" Drink, drink, push out. I'm hearing the word. I'm eating the word. I'm hearing about my healing. I'm pushing out my healing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Here again he says and everything we have need for the earthly journey. &gt;&gt; Somebody say earthly journey. &gt;&gt; Earthly journey. &gt;&gt; Divine healing. The power of God and all these other things is in every individual in here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you're planted in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me let me go back and tell you that all the redemptive blessings are in the redemptive names and all are in you now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. So if you need Rafa, where is it? &gt;&gt; You got to drink and &gt;&gt; to drink means you need to know the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So go start to know the scriptures about healing. &gt;&gt; I sent my word and I healed your diseases. Isaiah 53:5. Amen. 1 Peter 2:24. Amen. Mark 16. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the scriptures that's now attached to healing. The prophet says if you want healing, he says, "Think on healing scriptures." Think on healing. If you want gyra, you need to go that my God shall provide all my needs needs. My God shall supply all my needs according to his riches in glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know if he is going to supply my need according to his riches? &gt;&gt; It's not coming small. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hear what the Apostle Paul is saying. MY GOD SHALL SUPPLY ALL MY needs &gt;&gt; according to his riches in glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So which MEANS IF YOU'RE ASKING GOD FOR 10 GRAND, GOD DON'T HAVE 10 grand in glory. &gt;&gt; Even his streets are paved in gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he says bro, you know how you tell a person, hey, I only got this one grand change. God is going to tell you, I only got one gold brick here. That's my smallest change. Come on now. Somebody believe what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to his riches in glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many of you know you get what you ask for? you get what you ask for. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; So, if you're going to keep saying, "Lord, help me pay my rent. Help me pay my rent." God is going to keep helping you pay your rent. &gt;&gt; Because that's what you're asking. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I need better amen than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me pay my rent. You need to expand your vision. Be like Jabz. &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for the provision thus far that you help me to pay the rent. I see myself now as a proud homeowner. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thank you Lord that you've already provided for my need &gt;&gt; Lord because every time give the Lord a reason why &gt;&gt; because me renting here every time the people want to sell the flat I must move. &gt;&gt; Come on be practical. &gt;&gt; Did he say everything you have need of your earthly journey? &gt;&gt; I don't want to be heavenly good and earthly no good to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Every time I settle in have my first child. They're telling me I must move. a six-month baby. I must take and move with the furniture and the cot and this and that. David, you're going to learn. Praise the Lord. You have your second baby. They're telling you, "Hey, you know what? I'm giving you a notice. You have to move. Tell the Lord, I'm tired of moving." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm only suggesting to you a vision, &gt;&gt; but maybe you got big bigger vision than me. Maybe you have bigger expectations than me. &gt;&gt; What is it that you have? It's laying within you. &gt;&gt; Now, let's recap. Did the prophet say everything you have need of is in you? &gt;&gt; You got to drink and push it out. Which means you've got to attach the promise of God, the word of God to your life and push it out of you. Speak it out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you when I prophesied over you and I told you that Abraham was going to be the father of many nations and I said, "You'll be the owner of many businesses." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? You need to drink and push out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't keep praying, Lord, help me with this land. Help me with this land. That's what he's going to give you. He's the high priest of our confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John Ryan began to confess. Beside John Ryan, there's another man, the prophet says. He had the jerks. You'll pick this up. So, this man kept jerking. He came in the prayer line. The prophet says, "You're healed." He couldn't understand what the prophet is saying. He kept jerking. Amen. The prophet says, "You already healed according to the word of God." So this man, he began to go and he began to confess and tell everyone that he was healed. His mother was a Christian. Amen. He went back home in the countryside and he began to tell his mother he was healed. He began to go to church and tell everyone he was healed. The prophet says one day he's sitting there in the in the lounge and the mother and the pastor is saying, "Are you sure that this man didn't work you up?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. He said he began to have the jerks. Amen. The mother even told the son, "Son, you're embarrassing us now. You keep making this confession that you are healed, but everywhere we go, you don't act like you are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't look like you are healed. You keep got the jerks. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this man for 6 months, he kept his confession to pick this up in the message is jerking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he began to say, "Amen. The man of God told me I was healed and I believe I am healed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And immediately he was delivered and set free. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Immediately he was delivered and set free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we everything we have need of for this earthly journey. Got to drink more than your portion. Amen. Now hear what he says. It has to drink more than his portion. Did we go past it? Right. Divine healing things you have in need of he says everything you have need of for this life's journey. Even the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody read that even the &gt;&gt; is &gt;&gt; brother you don't have that on the screen there it's paragraph 85 on that uh he has to drink more than his portion that's where we are right is the inexhaustible that's the way the Christian is yes next Amen. So he says here divine healing power of God. We got that right. All of these things planted in Christ. The Holy Ghost baptism. Yeah. There it is. Now everything you have need of for this life's journey, even the rapture is right in you then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to now make sense to what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because the apostle Paul says he shall descend with the voice, the shout, the voice, and the trump. &gt;&gt; Come on now, somebody walk with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the rapture message, &gt;&gt; we know our portion of the rapture is the &gt;&gt; shout. What is the shout? It's a message going forth. &gt;&gt; What is that message going forth? It's the word of life, the living bread of life. &gt;&gt; And what did he say? The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So is he saying our part of the rapture, the shout is in us. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that sense made to what he's saying now. Amen. &gt;&gt; The shout is in us. &gt;&gt; The rapture is right in you then. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Tell your neighbor, it's about to get good. &gt;&gt; It's about &gt;&gt; Tell not time to sleep now. &gt;&gt; It's about to get good. &gt;&gt; You see what's going on here? You didn't notice Sister Josephine is already here trying to take over from Joshua &gt;&gt; because she has vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; She knows when Joshua goes, she don't want to leave this pastor stranded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So she says, I'm already going to start training &gt;&gt; to put quotes. She says, because why must Joshua get scolding a lot? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll be easier on her because she's a girl. [laughter] Praise the Lord. So he says, even the rapture is in you. Then he goes, there's people resenting when he said that. HE SAYS DON'T RESENT THAT. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. THE RAPTURE IS IN US NOW. I WILL PROVE IT BY the gospel. Those who have justified, those who are justified, he had glorified. Then then in heaven today, we are glorified in the presence of God. Right now, I'm just pushing out to it. God in his word. You believe it? Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we are pushing out now every redemptive blessing that God has promised us. Amen. He says the pro. Now, here here's what we want to get to. Now, the trouble with people when you become a Christian, you don't look around in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Help us. That's true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't look in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know there are message people, children that grew up in the message that bypassed the cross? &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; You were taught to accept the prophet in the message. &gt;&gt; They made you bypass the cross. Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't bypass the cross &gt;&gt; and come to Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You've got to start at the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be born again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you can testify to what I'm saying right now? &gt;&gt; Many people have missed that experience. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They bypassed the cross because they tried to make you force you to believe God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's true. &gt;&gt; They didn't make you fall in love with Jesus first. &gt;&gt; That's right. All they told you was you can't do this, you can't do that, you can't do this, you can't do that. &gt;&gt; They didn't show you how Jesus came to save you from a life of sin. That you were born in sin and you were marked for death 70 years and they'll put you in a coffin and forget about you. &gt;&gt; But Jesus came to give you purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus came to give you eternal life. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. &gt;&gt; See, SO THE PE PROBLEM with people, you become a Christian, YOU DON'T LOOK AROUND IN THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; YES. That is absolutely true. &gt;&gt; Yes. You say, "Well, I accepted Jesus as my personal savior." He says, "That's good." &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with that. That's what you should do. But after you become a Christian, go in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Look around and see what's yours. &gt;&gt; Now, prayer means to petition. &gt;&gt; YOU PETITION HEAVEN &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOUR WORD SAID THIS, &gt;&gt; and I'm coming to petition HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO ANSWER ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the [clears throat] prophet says heavens and earth, he says because heavens and earth will pass away. Heaven will respond to your prayer. He says my word will never fail. &gt;&gt; The high priest has GOT TO ANSWER YOUR PRAYER because you are petitioning heaven according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are praying according to the word of God. Amen. So the more we drink, we push out it brings out these elements. So pushing now also means it's going to push out bitterness. &gt;&gt; Amen. M. &gt;&gt; It's going to push out envy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to push OUT BACKBITING. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO PUSH OUT GOSSIP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRESSURE. THAT'S WHAT PRESSURE DOES. &gt;&gt; I said this on Wednesday in my prayer. I'm going to say it now as preaching. PART OF PREACHING. SOME OF YOU ARE NOT receiving what you are receiving because there are blockages there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You hate everyone. &gt;&gt; You speak about everyone. &gt;&gt; You gossip about everyone. You're envious of everyone. &gt;&gt; You're jealous of everyone. You have unforgiveness in your heart. &gt;&gt; That is what's stopping now. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Go and read after Mark 11:23 after 24 and see what 25 says. Go read even when Jesus is teaching the disciples how to pray. He says, "Forgive." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to be each other's gatekeeper. Be your husband's gatekeeper. Be your wife's gatekeeper. Be your children's gatekeeper. Then next time they start to speak like that, say, "Brother, please stop." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We mustn't speak like this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We mustn't get angry like this. Let's help one another. Let's be utterly good. &gt;&gt; Say, "Love, I hear what you're saying, but you know, according to the word of God, we should not be speaking like that. Let's forgive them. Let's rather pray for them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; You know, some people are so uh defensive all the time. They got the guard up all the time. Amen.

Inside your thoughts. &gt;&gt; You know, some people have the most beautiful thoughts. And some people say a penny for your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You staying in a one-bedroom shack. Maybe here in a maybe a tin town. You're staying in tin town. Do they still have tin town? I'm just using tin town so nobody gets offended here because tin town finished, right?

Push it out. Make your vision come to pass. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll give you a Bible. The Bible says Jesus, the lamb of God, was slain from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Beautiful thought. Imagine if you just left it there. If he never physically came to the earth and did it, but all he had was a beautiful thought. The lamb is slain from before the foundation of the world. Come season and time, the word had to be made flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The word had to be crucified. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So don't leave your dreams lying in your head till they put you 6 foot deep. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Pray and say LORD GIVE ME BOLDNESS to witness. &gt;&gt; I feel like nobody's listening to me. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody's ready to run out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says now I will see if I'm in now what? These are faith defeating words, prayer killing words. &gt;&gt; I'll see if I'm feeling better. I will see how it goes. And see if this will work. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; To see means you have vision. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the blind can't lead the blind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They'll both fall into a dish. I'm going to get to some points here. I want to get to now. Amen. Praise the Lord as we close. Amen. I'm sorry it's taking longer than it should, but I trust it's helping somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He says, "It's not what you see. It's what you believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's what you believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not what you feel. He never did say, "Did you feel it?" He said, "Did you believe it?" &gt;&gt; That's how you're saved by faith. That's how you're healed by faith. And faith is a substance of things hoped for. The evidence of things you don't taste, see, taste, feel, smell, hear. You just believe it, act on it. Amen. So, you know, the prophet of God also tells us about the spring and he wants you to know how it is bubbling &gt;&gt; and he went and spoke to the spring and he said if that spring could speak, it will tell me there's something within me pushing out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, when they ask you how are you so successful in life? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How you making it in life?

So, we've got TO ENLARGE OUR BORDERS AND OUR TERRITORIES and and and and our imagination and ask God for big things. &gt;&gt; He says, we know that the human mind asks for things that it it imagines. But we know that also out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. &gt;&gt; So, you can't lie. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, if there's a small dream and a small imagination, that's all you're going to ask. &gt;&gt; Break the limit. Uh Amen. Break the limits on your mind this morning. and think things that are not meant for you. &gt;&gt; You know the prophet uh Elisha on his deathbed he spoke to this king shash and he said strike the ground with arrows to signify your future victories over the enemy and he only struck the ground three times.

Now Elas was a servant. So that when she went to uh Isaac now and she was now the wife of Isaac, she wanted to live like Eliza like a servant. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You think every time Isaac said Isaac said look at &gt;&gt; north, south, west, it's all ours. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She said, "No, I want to be like any." &gt;&gt; Come on.

I asked for hundred of souls in this meeting. &gt;&gt; You know what message people say? No, we're not looking for numbers. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've been around message people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You preaching the gospel for nothing. Then &gt;&gt; imagine somebody going fishing and they say, "I'm not respecting fish. I just came here to waste my time. &gt;&gt; [laughter] [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; you went fishing. You're not expecting fish. &gt;&gt; They go there now and they set up the thing. We haven't come here to change you from your religion. &gt;&gt; You've been there in this outreaches with us. You've been there in these outriches with us. Greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We are HERE TO PRESENT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST TO YOU, BUT WE HAVEN'T COME TO CHANGE YOU FROM YOUR RELIGION. WE HAVEN'T come to change you from what you came to do there. turn that thing off and go home. &gt;&gt; Because what you are PRESENTING MUST BE BETTER THAN WHAT THEY HAVE for them to want what you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm asking for hundreds of souls in this meeting. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What else you asking for? I'M ASKING THAT EVERY SICK person enters that door will go out of here. Well, I'm believing it. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, we got the opening of the word. We don't pray for the sick. I'll tell you, I was sitting with somebody last week, Saturday, and they're telling me, "Bru, you know, I don't believe in just laying hands and praying for the sick." &gt;&gt; God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Message pastor. &gt;&gt; I I you know, we got past that now. &gt;&gt; I don't know where he is going past because he's so old. He is going to need healing of the body one of these days. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. enters the door, every sick person that enters the door will go out well. &gt;&gt; Well, amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm believing it. I'm believing that after we go, there won't be another gathering of people, but it'll be a revival. Satan has kept me out of it for long enough, and I believe the hour is here for a real sweeping revival in every church and around the country. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; What are we believing for? Don't be afraid to go to ask God for anything he's willing more than willing to give it there then you are to receive it. &gt;&gt; See if we can get that little shadow wiped away to know that he's willing to do it. You're his children. He loves you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know how you like to minister and do good things for your children. The very strain of fatherhood. Parent of your children comes from God. Amen. He's the father of us all. He loves us. He wants to do it for us. If he can just get us lined up with the blessings and so forth. You see some people were misaligned with the blessings. What is he saying? Father wants to get us aligned with the blessings. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Some of you wives ought to be nudging your husband and saying, "Come on. You the cause of this thing here. Come on now." Hello. Praise the Lord. We'll do marriage counseling afterwards. Everybody, when you leave here, if you're healed, act like you're healed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Act like you're healed. &gt;&gt; You can't raise YOUR HAND. ACT LIKE YOU CAN raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Act like you're healed. If you believe it, act like you are. Go saying, "THANK YOU, LORD. IT'S A FINISHED WORK." There sister J performed it this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She wasn't prepared. She said she started to walk around. I was quite surprised. She sent me a message at first 6 this morning telling me she wants to give a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So by which means she was already up by that time. She was walking around. Thank you Lord. It's a finished work. It's done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not by feelings. It's by faith. Say you're healed. Believe you're healed. Act like you're healed. Associate with those who believe in healing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will bring you right out to perfect soundness of health will not fail. &gt;&gt; So let's take that concept and apply to other areas of our life. If I'm sick, I must associate with those that believe in healing. &gt;&gt; Hey, I can apply this principle now. You mean if I want to be a successful businessman, I CAN ASSOCIATE WITH SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN. &gt;&gt; HEY, come on now, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; LAWS AND PRINCIPLE MUST WORK EVERY TIME IT IS APPLIED. &gt;&gt; IF I TAKE SOMETHING AND THROW IT UP NOW IN THE AIR HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA, it must come down because it's a principle. If I go to the USA and I throw it up, it must come down. LAWS AND PRINCIPLE MUST WORK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So if I ASSOCIATE WITH A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN and ask him, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; How can I want to be a successful businessman and I go by the brokeest business? That fell a puzzling. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are you setting before you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Jab, if you want to be a good lawyer, will you go study the life of one lawyer who's losing every case? &gt;&gt; No. If you want to be I MUST ASSOCIATE WITH THE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN. If I want to become successful in whatever we are doing associate with those who are successful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Birds of a feather flock together. &gt;&gt; You say this is now for the Pharisees. Give me a quote. &gt;&gt; Now you better you believe you're better. Say you're better. Act like you're better. Yes sir. I'm saved. You assoc say it with those that are saved. Ah, see now salvation even &gt;&gt; he says even salvation you associate with those that are saved. &gt;&gt; When you first were lost, you came to church, you were associating with those that are saved. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Then you started to act like you're saved. &gt;&gt; You started to speak like you are saved. &gt;&gt; You started to say hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. You started to speak the language like you are saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe that you are saved. Act like you're saved. And it was righteousness. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm so glad about today? I'm giving you a lot of quotes. &gt;&gt; You can't say I'm preaching my own thoughts here. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; He was wounded for a transgression, sitting at the right of hand of the father to make anything you confess. Now, what if you come to the altar and say, "Well, I don't know." &gt;&gt; But in your heart, you believe that you're saved and don't say nothing about it. You will never be saved until you believe it, accept it, and confess it. So I'm going to say, "Show me the company you are keeping, and I'll show you who you are." You know the prophet says that, right? &gt;&gt; Show me what you're looking at. You are becoming whatever image you're placing before you. Whatever you're thinking about, you are the sum of your thoughts. If you think negative, you'll be negative. If you think lack, you'll be in lack. People need to have a vision for their lives. Don't associate with people without vision. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. Come on. This is the climax now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want YOU TO CUT OFF ALL association with people that are not adding value to your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In fact, to associate with them, it's illegal in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "How can light have fellowship with darkness?" &gt;&gt; I know some of you are going to think, "Hey, everything is illegal with you. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change your friends. Change your associates. &gt;&gt; Some of you have been friends with people for years that have never spoken for your betterment. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; They have gone on and progressed, but you are the same. And they never help you, &gt;&gt; never encourage you, never inspire you. Hello. Change your friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change your friends. Change your associates. &gt;&gt; You can't be a Christian and still have holy friends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have their beers. You say, "No, I'll have coke." &gt;&gt; You compromise on who you are and your principles because you want to watch two people kick one ball. You go sit in the bar. No, &gt;&gt; because you're a message believer. You don't have TV in the house. &gt;&gt; But you're still violating now. You say, "I don't have TV in the house. I must sit in the bar now." That people smoking. They're drinking there, but you're drinking coke. [snorts] You gone on to their territory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's an illegal act. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's an illegal act. You stepped onto their grounds, but not once did they step onto your grounds. &gt;&gt; Not once did you bring them to church. &gt;&gt; They didn't want to come onto your territory, but you went onto their territory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to remind you, Jesus said, you are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; He says, and light, Amen. light in the world. You can't afford to dim your light and associate with darkness. Jesus also said, you are the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, people are flavorless. &gt;&gt; They need some salt. You are the seasoning they need. SO DON'T COMPROMISE WHO YOU ARE. They need to Amen. They need to see that you're a true Christian and they need to make you need to make them hunger and thirst for what you have. Let's read this quote. Samson got into bad company. And always remember when you are in bad company, you're out of the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Why you want to frustrate yourself? Because Liverpool lost the other day. Now you're fighting with all your friends because all your man united friends are phoning you and saying ah you're lost. &gt;&gt; You're having fruitless mindless uh conversations. Those people there living it up rich and everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you're having fights here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Power of influence. &gt;&gt; That fellow missed the goal that you getting angry in the house. &gt;&gt; You don't want to talk to anyone now because they're all making fun of you. You being in the room. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; See, you are out of the will of the Lord. If you lay with a dog, you get its fleas. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's a rather rude expression. It's got a lot of common everyday sense to it. You can't associate yourself with things of the world and expect to stay spiritual and humble before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are known by your company. Show me your company. I'll tell you who you are. &gt;&gt; And when the church begins to keep company with the world, it's no more then it's no more than the world. It gets out of fellowship with the Holy Spirit. Gets out of company with God and angels and God's heritage when you begin to flirt as Samson did. Amen. How's he going to do it? We're closing on this quote now. He says he's going to give you things little by little. The promise is yours. The land is yours. I've given it to you. Go and possess it. I'm going to not going to give it to you all in one year. I'll give it to you. Amen. He says, "If I give it to you in one year, the wild beasts are going to come and multiply against you. But as you push out, as you are able to take the land, Jabz, as you are able to walk every inch of ground, &gt;&gt; I'm going to enlarge your territory. I'll give you just as you are able to take the lamb. What a beautiful tonight for divine healing. The promise is yours. By the stripes you are healed. Now you have to go in and take it. Maybe you can't take it all at one time. But you can just accept it tonight. Only thing you have to do is push out the Amorites. Push out the days of miracles is pass. See this pastor telling me you can't pray for the sick. &gt;&gt; He's telling me the days of miracles is passed and other things. Just go in and take the lamp. Push away those theologies and all the explaining away. The promise is mine. Just take it. It's yours. What a beautiful promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Taking time. [applause] Amen. But I want you to do these things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the most powerful army of God right now. &gt;&gt; We are the super church. We are the super race. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the royal seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Come musicians, let's sing and worship the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What a glorious promise we have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Who here is going to change their confession? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who here is going to have a better vision? &gt;&gt; Who here is going to think better thoughts? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think higher thoughts. Have a vision for your life. Have a concern for your salvation. &gt;&gt; Have a concern for your healing. Get those things right. Jesus said, "Seek the kingdom first." Remember how we started the fountain is the Holy Ghost and out of the Holy Ghost you can push out everything you have need of in this life's journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have the Holy Ghost which means you are now have [music] untapped resources and we are saying let's change that and tap into resources. Let's sing from F. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm no longer [music] a slave to fear. This is [singing] what's been crippling people. Fear. Fear to ask God for big [music] things. Change it now.
