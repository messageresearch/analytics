[0:43] hallelujah amen amen you may a SE that
[0:46] God bless you amen every saint every
[0:49] believer Amen in the precious name of
[0:51] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[0:53] what a wonderful privilege we have to
[0:56] come again amen there's no other place
[0:58] we desire to be than his presence amen
[1:01] so if we can't gather here in his
[1:03] presence then we want to be with him on
[1:05] the other side amen hallelujah so you
[1:09] know he says David longed to be in the
[1:12] presence of God he says one thing have I
[1:15] desired and that will I seek after that
[1:18] I might dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:20] all the days of my life now
[1:24] David because he was a king he couldn't
[1:27] physically stay in the temple but now
[1:29] now that the Holy Ghost has come we
[1:32] become the temples and the Holy Ghost
[1:35] can have permanent residency within us
[1:39] now we don't sign a lease with the Holy
[1:41] Spirit and telling you're only allowed 3
[1:43] months 6 months or 12 month lease we
[1:46] give him full control amen hallelujah to
[1:49] have his way in US amen and I want to
[1:52] remind you that the Holy Ghost has come
[1:55] for a dual purpose to birth you and then
[1:58] to bring you to your adoption
[2:01] now if you read the Bible in Ephesians
[2:03] you were not predestinated to be born
[2:06] again oh yes Ephesians says you were
[2:09] predestinated to be children of God
[2:12] which means to be come to your full
[2:14] adoption so don't be satisfied with just
[2:17] a New Birth come all the way to the
[2:19] adoption ceremony amen hallelujah so
[2:22] amen we have sister narasha visiting
[2:23] with us again God bless you Sister amen
[2:26] and uh I believe a testimony is still
[2:27] growing and we're waiting for the full
[2:29] testim morning I believe sister Ruth was
[2:31] telling me last week she went for
[2:32] another scan and uh was it a sist what
[2:36] do they call it okay a mess so it was 10
[2:40] cm
[2:43] 10 13 19 and when they last measure it
[2:48] did
[2:49] is five five so something is dying
[2:54] there amen and we rebuke that demon even
[2:56] now yes amen amen hallelujah you know
[3:00] sometimes when you scold a dog you saw
[3:02] how sheepishly it walks away
[3:04] right so maybe it's sheepishly walking
[3:07] away but tonight you've come into the
[3:09] presence of God amen hallelujah
[3:11] hallelujah amen and you shall receive
[3:12] your full healing amen hallelujah so we
[3:15] shouldn't be ashamed of these things you
[3:17] know I have good news for you that today
[3:20] brother Moses was discharged from
[3:21] hospital let's give the Lord a good
[3:22] hande of
[3:24] Praise amen so we we will wait for the
[3:28] full testimony amen because there's so
[3:30] much that have transpired think of it in
[3:32] a week A lot has
[3:34] transpired from the time he was admitted
[3:37] till the time now each one of these
[3:39] brothers have testimonies regarding it
[3:40] and brother Moses himself has testimony
[3:42] about this amen I'll just share
[3:45] something with you very quickly because
[3:47] maybe you won't hear me talk about this
[3:49] again so when I went to the hospital I
[3:52] think it was Sunday so Sunday we had the
[3:54] combined meeting but something urged me
[3:56] to go to the hospital and pray for him
[3:58] so I got that quter to
[4:00] 4 and uh when I saw him looking from a
[4:05] human standpoint death was all over him
[4:09] you'd say there's no way he's going to
[4:10] come out of this
[4:12] bed okay and I believe it was even worst
[4:15] scene the day before that brother Joshua
[4:17] and brother jaff were witnessing because
[4:19] he was black blood just being spewed out
[4:22] you know and he had this eup and he kept
[4:25] like having this jerk and eup so it
[4:27] wasn't very comfortable to see him in
[4:28] that condition but when you're going
[4:31] there under commission you can't look at
[4:33] the symptoms am and even though the
[4:36] family may be around there you got to
[4:38] get the eyes off the situation and to
[4:41] focus on the word amen so read the
[4:44] scripture pray the prayer of faith and
[4:46] we left I left for the service so and
[4:49] this is how Satan works so you got to
[4:51] understand the prophet says when you're
[4:53] about to be healed Satan comes with the
[4:55] worst symptom with a scare tactic next
[4:59] day the hospital tells us that he's got
[5:01] to go onto an oxygen
[5:04] mask now you know when they start to say
[5:06] that they starting to say your lungs are
[5:08] affected your oxygen levels are not
[5:09] optimal and this and that and everything
[5:11] is going down and you know the the
[5:13] initial diagnosis they had was stage
[5:15] four kidney disease that's was from the
[5:18] first blood
[5:20] War amen but we rebuked that thing and
[5:23] we prayed amen amen
[5:25] so when we got the news that the mask
[5:28] was there I said no this is now we need
[5:30] to go even higher
[5:32] spiritually amen amen if Satan wants to
[5:35] raise the bow we need to raise the bow
[5:37] amen amen hallelujah so you get into a
[5:40] time of warfare time of prayer yes and
[5:42] the time of warfare you can't do in the
[5:44] day amen you do Warfare in the night
[5:48] amen amen hallelujah so that required
[5:52] waking up early parts of the night early
[5:54] in hours of the morning and praying and
[5:56] praying and rebuking and canceling out
[5:58] Spirits so Tuesday I said said let me I
[6:00] will I now need to go to the hospital
[6:02] again and I was going to meet brother
[6:04] Joshua there at
[6:06] 2:00 when he went over there something
[6:08] told me take the pillar of fire the
[6:11] prophet with the pillar of fire because
[6:13] brother Moses speaks highly about the
[6:14] pillar of fire and you know he knows
[6:16] about the prophet he'll never say
[6:17] anything
[6:18] negative so I gave him the book healing
[6:20] thoughts and I gave him the pill of fire
[6:22] and I said don't focus on this man focus
[6:25] on the pillar of fire that's the angel
[6:27] of God and he's going to be here with
[6:29] you in this hosp amen you'll hear
[6:30] further testimonies later on about that
[6:33] amen so that was when I went there he
[6:35] still had the oxygen mask but this time
[6:37] I went under the authority because I had
[6:40] fasted we had remember we did Warfare
[6:43] the night before so this time I knew
[6:45] that when two or more agree upon
[6:47] anything it shall be done amen must be
[6:51] done amen so we not learning the Warfare
[6:54] and how it operates for us not to put it
[6:56] into practice so the Lord will present
[6:58] situations for us to know how to handle
[7:01] Warfare to know how to go into Warfare
[7:04] amen so immediately when I started to
[7:06] pray read the scripture again pray over
[7:08] him and then immediately brother Joshua
[7:10] starts to get inspiration and he told
[7:11] him some things there immediately you
[7:13] could see it was all under the anointing
[7:14] that things were being spoken amen amen
[7:17] hallelujah so they were going to do the
[7:19] scope but they never ended up doing the
[7:20] scope that whole week and I know why
[7:22] they didn't do the scope because if they
[7:24] did the scope at that time they would
[7:26] have picked up something and then they
[7:28] would have started to to probe and do
[7:30] this that and the other test so they
[7:32] only did the scope on
[7:34] Monday they did the scope on Monday and
[7:37] they said everything looks good amen
[7:40] right suddenly the blood work now
[7:41] they're not talking there's no kidney
[7:44] problem amen they ran blood test again
[7:47] there's no kidney problem amen amen amen
[7:50] praise the Lord it that thing was
[7:52] reversed wonder the demon was rebuked
[7:55] yes and cast out yes amen that's the
[7:57] power of God amen hallelujah and then
[8:01] you remember what we did here last week
[8:03] wednessday the whole church got together
[8:06] amen and I asked you to put Moses shety
[8:08] name upon your
[8:09] lips amen every one of you have to do it
[8:13] so you're also part of this testimony
[8:15] hallelujah what I'm trying to tell you
[8:18] we took brother Moses from the gates of
[8:21] death amen hallelujah and that's the
[8:24] Power of a Praying church that's the
[8:26] power of God and then you know amen so
[8:30] even the doctors brother Joshua and and
[8:31] probably brother jaff when they sharing
[8:33] the testimony will tell you the doctors
[8:35] are now downplaying everything as if
[8:37] everything is was just normal because
[8:40] you know scientists don't believe in God
[8:42] so they can't testify but we know what
[8:44] happened amen so then you know what
[8:46] happened to Sister Victory they told her
[8:49] she had a heart attack did the ECG and
[8:51] everything the church got to pray now
[8:54] there's no sign of it now they're on a
[8:56] treat of a chest
[8:57] infection amen
[9:00] amen this is not a coincidence amen
[9:02] let's give God praise for that so from
[9:05] saying somebody had a heart attack
[9:07] they're going to book you in for
[9:08] angiogram and we're going to see you
[9:10] know what surgical procedure you need to
[9:12] suddenly now it being nothing blood
[9:14] tests are now
[9:15] clear that's the power of God cuz
[9:17] remember on Sunday I told you they told
[9:19] her that her blood enzymes was way over
[9:22] what it should
[9:23] be suddenly in the latest blood tars
[9:26] everything is normal amen the power of
[9:28] God amen so I want you to remember also
[9:31] Pastor Ruben
[9:32] Daniels
[9:34] uh he was uh amen taken unwell you know
[9:37] we also prayed for him last week
[9:39] wednessday I ask you to remember him in
[9:41] prayer amen so I wouldn't be telling you
[9:44] this if he didn't tell me so today he
[9:46] sent me a message amen and
[9:52] uh so he was telling he's waiting in
[9:54] anticipation for his healing he's
[9:56] waiting for his Miracle amen
[10:00] now there's a testimony behind that
[10:01] which I won't share right now amen but
[10:04] the brother has cancer in his what's it
[10:08] pancreas in his pancreas and now they
[10:11] did even further uh test today and they
[10:13] saw that it was further spread or
[10:15] something right
[10:18] so we want to take authority over that
[10:21] situation amen distance is not a problem
[10:25] yeah past Ruben could be in Ranon
[10:29] whichever hospital is in I don't even
[10:30] know which hospital but we are here amen
[10:33] but we are not fighting warfar based on
[10:36] territories like provinces so we Ascend
[10:39] the spiritual realm the Heavenly realm I
[10:42] don't know if you remember for months
[10:43] I'm telling you we ascending the
[10:44] spiritual realm amen maybe it sounded
[10:46] like a new phrase to you I told you we
[10:48] Ascend the spiritual realm we're going
[10:49] to high dimensions of the Holy Ghost
[10:52] amen so we don't wrestle against flesh
[10:55] and blood certain on who get dirty will
[10:57] go higher amen amen amen you know Birds
[11:01] you can't fight an eagle in the air amen
[11:04] oh yes praise the Lord amen so let us
[11:07] rise above our circumstance I say
[11:09] nothing shall be impossible to you am I
[11:11] say there's no situation that you are
[11:13] facing right now that God can't deliver
[11:15] you out of thank you Lord thank amen so
[11:18] praise the Lord so today amen as you
[11:19] would know amen I appreciate the prayer
[11:22] Brother s amen hallelujah would have
[11:25] been Pastor Ronnie's
[11:26] birthday and uh would you would have
[11:29] been
[11:31] 72 amen but the Lord didn't see you fit
[11:33] for that he wanted him to be 18 am amen
[11:38] hallelujah so we know he's alive and
[11:41] well in another body yes
[11:45] amen but what I wanted to say was we had
[11:49] a spiritual father in this church amen
[11:52] amen
[11:53] yes that led the church for over 40
[11:57] years so it's not something we can
[12:00] forget amen we've been on a journey for
[12:03] over 40 years so it's not something we
[12:05] can easily forget amen
[12:09] hallelujah
[12:11] and why I say we are
[12:13] fortunate not a lot of people have
[12:15] spiritual
[12:17] fathers don't worry I'm not choking
[12:19] about crying there's just something
[12:20] stuck in my throat you so don't you
[12:22] don't get emotional and think oh he's so
[12:24] sensitive now and he's crying
[12:27] no so we are Sons we are daughters we
[12:31] have learned from him amen he has taught
[12:34] us valuable lessons and his life itself
[12:36] was a sermon the way he lived he wanted
[12:40] the church you always you knew he wanted
[12:42] the church to prosper he wanted the
[12:44] church to flourish he wanted the church
[12:46] to grow in Christ he was concerned about
[12:48] the Lost amen he was encouraging the
[12:50] church to do Outreach work fulfilling
[12:52] the Great Commission amen
[12:55] hallelujah and even when he came to
[12:57] personal lives he wanted you to progress
[13:00] in your work yes he wanted you to
[13:01] progress in different aspects of your
[13:03] life amen
[13:06] amen because Abraham was not only
[13:09] blessed spiritually
[13:11] yes this Abraham was so blessed that the
[13:14] Lord said even the nations of the world
[13:16] will be blessed Because of
[13:18] You amen so that's the kind of life I
[13:20] want to live that's the kind of life we
[13:23] can live because we are children of

[14:05] positioning us shaping us molding us

[22:58] even in your prophet's life Lord so many
[23:00] things couldn't be said in the books and
[23:01] tapes father because so much of
[23:03] Supernatural was taking place and even
[23:06] in our own lives Lord we testify from
[23:08] time to time but certain things we don't
[23:10] testify because so many things are
[23:12] happening oh God we're living the
[23:14] supernatural life oh God that is the
[23:16] life of a True Believer father because
[23:19] Lord we are supernatural beings oh god
[23:22] oh we thank you Jesus for the things
[23:24] that you are showing us Lord right now
[23:27] we commit the services into your hands
[23:29] we Comm all things into your hands and
[23:31] we ask that you have the prence over
[23:33] everything now in Jesus name
[23:36] amen amen to God be all the glory amen
[23:40] great things he has done amen yes
[23:44] amen I just I was going to share with
[23:46] you before I start preaching a portion
[23:48] you can have
[23:50] a a portion of my dad Tes but I see
[23:54] didn't share a lot of it but just to
[23:55] share it a little bit from from my angle
[23:57] you know people testify they Testify the
[24:00] way they saw it amen you find the
[24:03] gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John
[24:05] testifying from the angle of the day so
[24:08] amen I'm just remembering as I'm driving
[24:10] to church now the last time when my
[24:12] father had an ar ar
[24:14] attack and I remember the time when he
[24:16] went to pray he was in tears and went to
[24:18] see him in the casualty he was in tears
[24:20] and the first Minister that prayed for
[24:22] him was Pastor
[24:24] Ronnie so I was thinking the first
[24:26] Minister that prayed for him now was
[24:28] brother
[24:29] Adrian so am it was it might seem
[24:33] unusual but certain things happen for
[24:36] certain reasons in people's life you
[24:38] know amen so he was the first Minister
[24:42] that Pastor ad was the first Minister
[24:43] that prayed for him hospital when he had
[24:45] the Art Attack in Gandhi Hospital Pastor
[24:47] Ron was the first person went and saw
[24:49] him as a minister and prayed for
[24:51] him so just a brief uh testimony because
[24:55] I told him today that when you are
[24:56] better when you ful cover and get
[24:58] strength you need to come to our church
[24:59] and you need to testify I said yes as
[25:02] soon as I get my strength I'll do that
[25:05] so on uh he had been sick for a while
[25:09] for a few days until he got very weak
[25:12] and he couldn't make it anymore then Jaa
[25:14] took him to the M hospital and then they
[25:19] did some blood test on
[25:21] him and he was so
[25:23] weak that they put him immediately on a
[25:26] drip and when they did the blood chain
[25:28] test and when the blood st came came out
[25:31] it showed stage four kidney failure that
[25:34] was a blood uh test showing and I
[25:37] believe his blood pressure was low on
[25:39] that same night blood pressure was also
[25:41] dropping so the next Jeff when i ph ja
[25:44] lat night he was going to take him to
[25:45] Gandhi Hospital so I told jaffet they're
[25:48] going to just leave him there and
[25:50] they're not going to be stabilizing him
[25:52] I said bring him to the doctor in the in
[25:54] the bluff the next morning let's get him
[25:56] stabilized before we take him to the
[25:57] hospital
[25:59] because he really needed more drips at
[26:00] the time the Jeffer brought him when my
[26:04] doctor friend checked him out he said
[26:07] I'm surprised your father never going
[26:08] into shock as yet when he looked at the
[26:10] results from the Mage from hospital and
[26:13] then he said he put him immediately on
[26:15] oxygen and he put him on DS he said
[26:17] because in this condition you would have
[26:18] went into shock
[26:22] then uh he took Jeffer and I into his
[26:24] office and he found a kidney
[26:26] specialist and he gave gave him the
[26:28] symptoms and he gave him the readings
[26:30] you know the blood results when he gave
[26:32] the blood results he said this is a very
[26:34] serious condition he said he should be
[26:36] taken to the hospital immediately so I
[26:38] said we we don't have the funds to put
[26:40] him in a private Hospital the best
[26:42] things we could do is take him to the to
[26:44] Ark Khan's hospital the doctor said you
[26:46] can't take him in your car you got to
[26:47] take him in ambulance that's how serious
[26:49] it is so we called an ambulance there
[26:51] and ambulance took him to Khan's
[26:53] hospital and I went there and then being
[26:57] there like the whole entire entire
[26:59] day he was getting weaker and weaker and
[27:03] then by the time we eventually got uh I
[27:07] think I left jefford there for maybe a
[27:09] few hours I said now let me go get
[27:11] something to eat and have a rest and
[27:12] come back soon as I left jefford jefford
[27:16] said when they checked his uh sets the
[27:20] blood pressure and everything it dropped
[27:22] right down and the nurses started to
[27:24] panic they went into a panic mode and
[27:26] they then they put him in immediately
[27:28] into the emergency room and everything
[27:31] was just dropping his blood pressure his
[27:33] arrate and all were dropping so they put
[27:35] him into the emergency room and they
[27:36] started uh Reviving him there and
[27:39] putting back on drips and everything so
[27:43] then I came and spent the rest of the
[27:44] night with him then I think it was late
[27:45] in I don't know midnight for me and he
[27:48] wanted to come there I said I'm thinking
[27:50] that there a man of God that needs to
[27:52] prepare for Sunday and you know
[27:54] everybody knows when you're preparing
[27:55] for the Sunday service you you don't
[27:57] like to be disturbed I said no it's BR
[27:59] just speak the word from where you are
[28:00] but it's fine we are here we pray uh you
[28:04] prepare your service you know you carry
[28:05] on we we are okay so I waited him I
[28:09] waited him for the rest of the night I
[28:10] said dad I it's church tomorrow I need
[28:12] to go at least have 2 hours sleep to
[28:14] have a few few some rest because I need
[28:16] to go to church in the morning I said
[28:18] but I'll leave you here and I'll come
[28:20] and check you out before I go to
[28:21] church so I left him so something got
[28:26] very edgy with me you know like I just
[28:27] work woke up I just woke up watched my
[28:29] face and rush rush to the hospital and
[28:31] he said you'll never then I saw him he's
[28:33] not there where I left him then he was
[28:35] put into an emergency room right in the
[28:37] air with some oxygen on and I said and
[28:39] he said you never believe what happened
[28:40] he said when you left I so much of blood
[28:44] came out so much not even at home and
[28:47] everything so much of blood came out
[28:49] that they got shocked all of them they
[28:50] called the surgical doctors and
[28:52] everything and then they decided to how
[28:54] then they realized how serious he was
[28:56] and they said they have to admit him
[28:58] immediately so they started working on
[29:01] him and I they said they'll admit him so
[29:04] I said okay I'm going to leave you and
[29:05] go to church now but I'll come after
[29:07] they'll come after church and check on
[29:08] him
[29:10] so when I left him and I came to church
[29:14] you know when you leave someone and you
[29:16] know in the from The Human Side I'm
[29:18] saying now you know you're going to get
[29:19] the call from the
[29:20] hospital that's the way I left him
[29:22] because I left him looking I could see
[29:24] death all over his
[29:25] face his face was looking at that he
[29:28] couldn't read properly you couldn't talk
[29:30] it was just his face was right inside
[29:32] his eyes were in and his mouth were in
[29:34] face was dark and even when I left him
[29:37] at night when I was there just before I
[29:38] leave him I was trying to wake him up he
[29:40] couldn't wake up I didn't I just thought
[29:42] he's sleeping but meanwhile his blood
[29:43] pressure dropped right down until they
[29:45] put it on the Monitor and they saw his
[29:47] blood pressure was down so he was going
[29:48] to go into a shock but we I prayed for
[29:51] him and I left him I prayed and I came
[29:53] to
[29:54] church that evening that's when Pastor
[29:56] Adrian went there and
[29:59] then the it was which day it was when we
[30:02] went Shing the break on Tuesday on
[30:05] Tuesday we met the before on Pastor
[30:07] Aiden's lunch break we met at the
[30:09] hospital so Pastor aen prayed for him
[30:13] and he gave him the pillow of fire
[30:14] picture and he said don't look at the
[30:16] man look at the pillow of
[30:20] fire and then as he just trade past Adan
[30:23] trade I spoke I said there's a reason I
[30:26] just pointed I said there's a reason
[30:27] under anointing I said there's a reason
[30:29] there's a delay of the endoscope I said
[30:32] God is working with inside of you amen I
[30:35] said you're going to come out as the
[30:36] testimony by the time they do the scope
[30:37] the report is going to be a good
[30:39] report this was on Tuesday then as it
[30:43] came to the week they even didn't do the
[30:45] scope on Friday then they said no it's a
[30:47] weekend now they leave it for Monday by
[30:49] the time they did the scope they
[30:51] couldn't find anything other than a
[30:53] normal alar
[30:54] Hallelujah and uh and he had a throat
[30:58] infection which was picked up in the
[31:00] hospital when using the oxygen Like A
[31:01] fungi
[31:03] infection and
[31:05] uh that was uh that and then asked him
[31:10] but then how was the kidney because you
[31:12] never gave any treatment for the kidney
[31:13] yeah he said no the the last Blood the
[31:16] latest blood test oh okay before I go to
[31:18] that brother Jaffer did the blood test
[31:20] in the private hospital that's lamon
[31:23] they gave stage four kidney failure the
[31:26] the specialist said is stage four kidney
[31:28] special failure RK Khan's Hospital said
[31:31] we are the government we want to do our
[31:32] own blood test they did the own blood
[31:34] test they said stage four kidney failure
[31:37] when the latest blood test came they
[31:38] said there's nothing wrong with the
[31:39] kidneys at all kidneys
[31:42] are the kid is perfectly normal so
[31:46] because even when when we when that
[31:48] special left they said they was
[31:49] preparing for dialysis immediately when
[31:51] we left that Bluff Medical the kidney
[31:54] specialist was there Jeff and I were
[31:55] there you need to prepare him for that
[31:58] even when they saw him they said but the
[32:00] only only problem is here they need to
[32:02] first to the endoscope but God was
[32:05] delaying all the process cuz he was
[32:07] working but over and above this when
[32:11] Pastor AB gave him the pillow of fire
[32:13] picture and he told him look at that the
[32:15] pillow of fire then that evening when I
[32:17] did the evening visit and I left him I
[32:19] said Lord It's not a good thing to leave
[32:21] my father in a government hospital but I
[32:24] pray that your angel will be with you
[32:28] and I prayed that prayer then he had a
[32:31] supernatural exper which I will let him
[32:32] I don't want to add to that I want to
[32:33] take off I want him to give his own
[32:35] testimony he had his own experience in
[32:37] the hospital so you know I was just
[32:42] thinking about the scripture in 2 Kings
[32:43] 184 it says he removed the eye places
[32:47] and break the images and cut down the
[32:49] growes and break in pieces the Brazen
[32:51] serpent that Moses had made for un
[32:54] through those days the children of
[32:55] Israel he's talking about when ezekiah
[32:58] came into the king and he removed you
[33:01] know the the worship the images that
[33:03] they made they even made a image like
[33:06] how the Brazen serpent which Moses had
[33:08] there now God had that for a purpose at
[33:10] the time but yeah they was worshiping
[33:12] the image now so we know that modern
[33:16] sorry uh the medicine and Doctor are all
[33:22] a sign of Divine
[33:24] Healing but people starting to put their
[33:27] faith in deaths is the same as them
[33:30] worshiping this Graven image amen of
[33:32] Moses serpent when people put their
[33:35] faith on doctors when they put their
[33:38] faith on medicine that's a sign of
[33:41] Divine Healing but the faith must be in
[33:43] Jesus amen yes you need to have your
[33:46] faith in the one that redeemed the one
[33:48] that come to do the work of redemption
[33:50] your faith cannot be on medicine yes yes
[33:53] you need the medicine that's part of
[33:55] Divine Healing it's a sign of Divine
[33:58] Healing you need the good doctors is a
[34:00] it's a sign of Divine Healing but your
[34:02] faith cannot be based on them and that's
[34:05] the problem today people are putting
[34:07] their faith on signs they putting their
[34:10] faith on medicine that is good as
[34:12] idolatry because that's what happened in
[34:14] the book of ezekiah they took at Moses
[34:16] Brad Serpent and they was worshiping
[34:18] they made an image and was worshiping it
[34:21] so our faith must always be in Jesus
[34:24] Christ you know people are looking for
[34:26] the best hospitals the best doctors but
[34:28] our faith must always no matter where
[34:30] you are treated your faith must be in
[34:32] Jesus Christ amen so even when you
[34:35] takeing your medication pray over it
[34:37] amen put your faith in Jesus Christ amen
[34:39] let's stand to our
[34:44] feet just a small exhortation
[34:48] tonight also remembering our pastor
[34:53] Ronnie you know when we say remembering
[34:56] the reason why we remember we don't
[34:58] forget because they live on amen amen
[35:00] they just in another place in a more
[35:03] Superior place than this yes in a more
[35:06] Superior body than
[35:09] this amen so 1 Corinthians 4:14
[35:36] I write not these things to shame you
[35:40] but as my beloved Sons I warn you for
[35:44] though ye have 10,000 instructors in
[35:49] Christ and I like the way Paul says it

[36:20] can see the
[36:22] word but are they a father to

[36:30] fathers because a father is a person
[36:33] that's going to nurture someone in
[36:35] Ministry a part A a father is someone

[40:11] many
[40:12] instructors many people preaching the
[40:14] gospel but it had to have a father amen
[40:18] and in a church okay firstly who started
[40:22] the church yes it was the Holy Ghost
[40:25] which gave birth to the church Church
[40:28] you find that in the book of Acts

[41:21] branches not every Branch perform the
[41:25] same is that right right not every

[42:09] loss if we do a a order check and see
[42:12] this is where we losing prophets we need
[42:14] to work on this area this is the area
[42:16] that we are lacking yes and then they
[42:18] work on the things that they are lacking
[42:20] yes amen and then they have a team
[42:22] building together to work together as a
[42:25] team yeah you find that being a
[42:27] successful store amen amen and you find
[42:29] that branch is different from the other
[42:32] branches amen so likewise Christ is a
[42:35] vine but there are many
[42:37] branches so we are part of a branch amen
[42:41] and we got to make sure that this Branch
[42:44] bear forth
[42:45] fruits but we don't want it to just bear
[42:48] forth fruit we want it to be fruitful
[42:51] and multiply
[42:54] amen if you look at Genesis 49 22 it
[42:58] says Joseph is a fruitful bow now Joseph
[43:03] is typing Perfection right even a
[43:06] fruitful Bow by a well whose branches
[43:10] run over the wall am this is Genesis
[43:14] 49:22 so we're talking about extending
[43:17] territory extending spiritual Frontiers
[43:19] amen amen now it he saying Joseph is a
[43:23] fruitful Bow by a well which is good
[43:27] because why he's drawing from a well
[43:30] he's drawing from the main from the
[43:31] water right we drawing from this
[43:33] inexhaustible Fountain of Life but it
[43:36] says whose branches run over the
[43:41] wall amen now it's extending its
[43:43] boundaries amen amen it it's by a well
[43:47] but it's running over the wall now and
[43:51] then the archers have sorely grieved him
[43:53] and shuted him and hated him but his bow
[43:56] of B in strength and the HMS of his
[43:59] hands were made Strong by the hands of
[44:01] the by the Mighty God of Jacob even by
[44:05] the god of thy father who shall help
[44:08] thee and by the almighty who shall bless
[44:10] thee with blessings of Heaven above
[44:12] blessings of the deep that lith under
[44:14] the blessings of the breast and of the
[44:17] womb so you find that yeah the Bible is
[44:21] saying us that Joseph Jacob now is
[44:24] blessing Joseph and he's saying you are
[44:26] Joseph is a fruitful bow even a fruitful
[44:29] B well because if you look at Joseph he
[44:32] extended beyond the borders of Israel
[44:35] and his ministry was what for the
[44:37] preservation of life for the whole world
[44:39] at that time amen so what is what is the
[44:43] ministry of the Bride when thou must
[44:45] prophesy again before Nation tongue and
[44:48] Kindred is she not kept for such a time
[44:50] for the preservation of life it is not
[44:53] Mery Grace upon the Earth it is not the
[44:56] final voice in his final day amen amen
[44:59] but if your foundations are not
[45:02] right sons have to be brought up by a
[45:04] father amen you find even in the natural
[45:07] if a son doesn't have a children that
[45:09] don't have fathers are not brought up
[45:12] rights it makes a big difference with a
[45:15] with a child having a father so how much
[45:17] more spiritually
[45:20] now we find that people say no the Lord
[45:23] called me I'm going to
[45:24] preach and never grow out was never
[45:27] brought up in Ministry by a
[45:30] father then whatever Ministry they going
[45:33] they're going to be shaky amen they want
[45:35] have a firm
[45:36] foundation because your spiritual father
[45:39] is going to guide you yes he's going to
[45:42] look at your life he going to have
[45:43] discernment yes he's going to discern
[45:45] your life amen he's going to see where
[45:47] you are lacking spiritually and you're
[45:49] going to he going to see what you need
[45:51] to grow amen
[45:53] amen you know I'm thinking of the time
[45:56] when when we first started in
[45:58] ministry as Paul said yet we had many
[46:01] instructors we also were I was taken
[46:04] back with beautiful
[46:07] Ministries will tell you we should
[46:08] always admire different Ministries the
[46:10] 54 Ministry different teachings and all
[46:12] that but you know one thing about Pastor
[46:17] Ronnie he never got Amazed by any
[46:20] different Ministries he said now let's
[46:21] take it back to the word let's see what
[46:23] the prophet is saying about it let's see
[46:25] what the Bible says about it and in any
[46:27] situation cuz I went with him you know
[46:29] when he counsel with people say let's
[46:31] see what the Bible says about it let's
[46:33] see what the word says about
[46:36] it so you find that a spiritual father
[46:40] he also knows his son if someone say
[46:43] they spiritual father to you they must
[46:44] have theer they need to know you amen
[46:47] they need to understand whether this
[46:49] person is the right person for the
[46:50] ministry not that someone just say okay
[46:52] you're looking good you have the right
[46:55] stature physically you have the the
[46:57] right you can speak well eloquently you
[46:59] are the right person for the ministry
[47:01] that is not a spiritual father a
[47:03] spiritual father must have discernments
[47:05] am say this person might not be there
[47:07] right
[47:08] now but I can see something in this
[47:10] person amen there's some potential in
[47:13] his
[47:14] person that's why when when Samuel went
[47:17] to choose when he was looking on the
[47:19] natural God was looking on the inside
[47:22] God knew God is God already had his man
[47:25] that's why a spiritual father father a
[47:27] Shepherd you got to tap with God Amen
[47:30] you got to be connected with God and God
[47:32] got to show him who to choose as his
[47:34] spiritual Sons how to grow them up amen
[47:38] and if the and if the foundation was
[47:40] right then they must be an extension of
[47:44] borders amen amen amen if the the
[47:47] foundation was right then this Branch
[47:49] must bear forth much fruits it must be
[47:52] fruitful and multiply amen and not R to
[47:55] De generation and must must take it over
[47:57] to other
[47:58] Generations amen it must be a passing of
[48:02] inheritance
[48:04] am
[48:06] amen that's how you see the fruits of a
[48:08] Min a true Ministry when you can see the
[48:10] younger generation now going to take up
[48:12] the B amen they passing it on and they
[48:15] working on the younger gener they have
[48:17] discernment to see what to work on what
[48:21] what aspect in their life they need to
[48:22] work on and then you see the fruits of
[48:25] it it might take a long time these
[48:28] things require patience amen these
[48:30] things are not done with overnight
[48:32] because this is not wishy-washy stuff
[48:34] amen amen this is genuine stuff now
[48:37] therefore you find in the early
[48:40] Ministries the early ministers their job
[48:43] was to get C correct amen they had to
[48:47] labor in that and the reason why they
[48:50] had to lab in that because the
[48:51] foundation wasn't right cracks was going
[48:54] to come along the way
[48:57] and the buling was going to fall
[48:59] amen but thank
[49:02] God for he was in control of all
[49:10] things Paul says in one Corinthians 36
[49:13] he says who then is Paul and who is Aus
[49:17] yes but ministers whom ye believed yes
[49:21] even as the lord gave to every
[49:23] man I have planted apus watered but God
[49:30] gave the
[49:33] increase so then neither is he that
[49:36] planted anything neither he that watered
[49:38] it but God that giveth the increase so
[49:42] you got to watch the fruits of any
[49:44] Ministry and see if God was in it
[49:47] because there must be an
[49:49] increase amen you cannot remain the same
[49:53] you've got to extend the borders amen
[49:56] amen when when when Joshua took them
[49:58] there and Joshua wasn't just satisfied
[50:00] with people just coming in there and
[50:02] taking he wanted them to extend their
[50:04] borders amen he wanted them to be
[50:06] successful in that land because even God
[50:08] said to him if you don't turn to the
[50:10] left don't turn to the right you'll have
[50:12] good success if you only keep the words
[50:14] what I've send you you you should have
[50:16] good success amen so if you can look at
[50:19] your life to say am I disatisfied with
[50:22] where I want to be whether it's
[50:24] naturally physically or whatever I'm
[50:26] talking about spiritually as well which
[50:28] is the main part of it am I satisfied
[50:31] with just calling myself a church
[50:33] believer or do I want to find out what
[50:36] is God's purpose for my life amen where
[50:38] do God want me to be yes and if you
[50:43] attend to if you have that real sincere
[50:45] desire you know who God is going to
[50:47] reveal it to
[50:50] Joshua and who is Joshua coming to the
[50:55] ministry amen so if you're attentive and
[50:58] have the right attitude God is going to
[51:00] show you where you're supposed to be
[51:02] amen
[51:03] amen I thought I was I was satisfied
[51:06] with just receiving the message when I
[51:07] came in I was so excited that there was
[51:10] something I never saw in my whole life
[51:12] and this was the best thing that ever
[51:13] happened I wasn't preaching was the last
[51:15] thing I would have thought of in this
[51:16] message I'm talking about when I came to
[51:18] the message I wasn't thinking about
[51:19] preaching I was satisfied wow God sent a
[51:22] prophet God spoke about a a message
[51:24] that's going to take us to the Rapture
[51:25] there was a message is going to change
[51:27] us and take us to the Rapture wow I was
[51:29] seeing all these things I didn't know
[51:31] I'll be a minister in this
[51:34] message but there was a
[51:37] Shepherd a spiritual father that said to
[51:40] me start we and
[51:42] preaching took me one day out of the
[51:45] Blues said you go and preach and open a
[51:46] meeting training
[51:49] ground I said but open a I haven't
[51:52] preached in open a meeting and you'll
[51:54] all know about the first experience that
[51:56] he went out he said no I want you to go
[51:57] preach there then from there he said no
[52:00] you take the wedness day
[52:02] service because it was training ground
[52:05] amen like I'm reminding like when I to
[52:08] take cable Caleb for driving lessons a
[52:11] father must take do this things with
[52:12] their children you take them on training
[52:14] ground and you get them ready to go for
[52:17] the
[52:19] test so you see two spiritual fathers
[52:22] will
[52:24] identify but they could see see what we
[52:27] couldn't see at that
[52:28] time they could see what we couldn't see
[52:31] you understand amen so therefore
[52:34] sometime you get the minist you say you
[52:36] want you to do something for the Lord
[52:38] you might think but I'm just in
[52:40] significant I'm just a normal person in
[52:42] the church but the ministry is asking to
[52:44] do the specific thing for the Lord
[52:46] because they can see something that you
[52:48] can't
[52:49] see because discernment is in the church
[52:53] because the the vision of the ministry
[52:55] is to enlar LGE the territory to enlarge
[52:59] the borders they're not satisfied with
[53:01] the local assembly no the local assembly
[53:03] is just equipping you it's bullying you
[53:07] but you are here you getting trained as
[53:09] soldiers because you are going out
[53:12] you're going to enlarge the Border you
[53:14] taking the ministry out amen yes Lord
[53:17] amen amen and right now we also fighting
[53:19] spiritual battle we fighting demon
[53:21] warfar now you hear the prayer request
[53:24] from the past in Johannesburg
[53:27] we might not be in Johannesburg but we
[53:29] extending our borders there now God has
[53:31] put the gift in the church if he placed
[53:34] the gift in this body this part of the
[53:35] body remember he's got the body right
[53:37] and each one got their own part to play
[53:39] in the body now if God has placed the
[53:41] gift in this part of the body let's
[53:43] extend our
[53:45] bodies send the gift out there how you
[53:48] can help as the church is create the
[53:51] right atmosphere Hallelujah create the
[53:54] right atmosphere where no demon Spirits
[53:55] are welcome
[53:57] so let's send out the gifts through the
[54:00] atmosphere through the airwaves through
[54:02] the atmospheres
[54:04] amen till the angel of God is going out
[54:07] there amen amen
[54:09] yes that's what we're talking about
[54:12] extending the
[54:16] borders so Jeremiah 3:15 says and I will
[54:19] give you pasts according to mine Hearts
[54:23] amen who shall feed you with knowledge
[54:25] and
[54:29] understanding amen so you can't be
[54:32] coming to a church and saying that you
[54:33] have a
[54:34] pastor but you don't have knowledge and
[54:37] understanding of the word because a true
[54:40] Pastor is going to feed you amen a true
[54:44] Shepherd is going to feed you the true
[54:46] word amen and he and he knows his
[54:50] children you know this one can't dig so
[54:53] much this one I got to give him just a
[54:55] little bit
[54:56] this one he want strong meat this one
[55:00] got this problem we need to deal with
[55:01] that that's a true Shepherd now a true
[55:04] Shepherd know every one of the Sheep
[55:06] amen amen he knows the Sheep the Sheep
[55:11] must have maybe got a sickness the Sheep
[55:14] got a problem the shepherd knows that he
[55:16] said this one here I cannot leave him
[55:18] alone I got to watch this one here amen
[55:21] this one year I got to watch it because
[55:22] if I leave it it's going to fall off the
[55:24] cliff oh yes this one yeah is keep
[55:27] running away even though I'm rebuking
[55:30] and rebuking I'm going have to break it
[55:32] leg because they love the
[55:37] Sheep Jesus said John 10:11 said I am
[55:40] the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd
[55:42] giveth his life for the Sheep but he
[55:45] that is in the highing and not the
[55:47] shepherd who own who's own the Sheep are
[55:50] not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth
[55:53] the Sheep you see the one who's not
[55:56] connected with the great Shepherds yes
[55:58] right that's an ising
[56:00] Shepherd but the one who's called
[56:02] ordained before the foundation of the
[56:04] world gifts and calling are without
[56:05] repentance that means you are to be born
[56:07] with the gift not someone lay hands on
[56:09] you and say now you a
[56:10] pastor amen that you went to some Bible
[56:14] College and someone made you a pastor
[56:15] because you got some diploma no you was
[56:17] born with the gift amen yes amen so
[56:22] leave with the sheep and flee and the
[56:23] Wolf catched them and Scatter scattered
[56:25] the Sheep
[56:26] theing flee and he himself fleeth when
[56:29] the trouble comes he flee it because he
[56:32] is an ising and carth not for the Sheep
[56:35] but Jesus said I am the Good Shepherd
[56:37] amen and know my sheep and am known of
[56:41] mine someone say but Jesus is talking
[56:43] about himself no where is Jesus yes
[56:47] where is Jesus veiled in this hour amen
[56:51] as the father knoweth me even so I the
[56:54] so know I the father and lay down my
[56:56] life for the sheep and other sheep I
[56:59] have which are not of the SW them also I
[57:02] must bring and they shall hear my voice
[57:06] and there shall be one fold and one
[57:09] Shepherd
[57:11] amen so you see how
[57:14] serious jesus takes this thought of
[57:18] having a good shepherd yes you see how
[57:21] serious this is and he Likens them to
[57:23] Shepherd and sheep because Shepherds
[57:26] it's not like why didn't say herder or a
[57:30] person that look after pigs or person
[57:33] that look after
[57:34] cattle why you didn't say Shepherd
[57:37] talking about a shepherd and a
[57:38] sheep because a Shepherd become one with
[57:41] a
[57:41] sheep a Shepherd you see
[57:44] sheep sheep cannot be lit on their
[57:47] own that's right yes sheep has to be
[57:52] led and therefore God himself so it fit
[57:55] this is my sheep I can't put an island
[57:58] in there I got to put my own there amen
[58:02] so before a true Shepherd is born even
[58:05] before they born they ordained to be
[58:06] there and at that appointed time in that
[58:09] season you going to look after my sheep
[58:12] am that's why Jesus said to Peter feed
[58:15] my sheep said to him again feed my sheep
[58:18] said to him feed my lamb
[58:22] amen so Jesus was concerned about these
[58:25] things but we talking about a Ministry
[58:28] that stood the test of time we're
[58:31] talking about a Ministry that not remain
[58:34] stagnant because 40 years plus plus
[58:38] now or the time Pastor Ronnie ran the
[58:41] ministry 40 years
[58:43] Ministry the the test of where it took
[58:45] the time was where it extended the
[58:47] Border where it extended the wall and
[58:50] became
[58:51] fruitful where it became a fruitful
[58:54] Ministry but the fruits you shall know
[58:56] them am the way to judge a Ministry is
[58:59] by the
[59:01] fruits amen because you know there's
[59:04] many Ministries around the world that
[59:06] soon as something happens to the
[59:07] shepherd the ministry falls apart and it
[59:10] happened in big
[59:13] Ministries many M big name
[59:16] Ministries the church fell apart and
[59:19] they not progressing further but you
[59:21] find that if a minister is truly called
[59:24] of God and he got his foundation rights
[59:28] he got his Branch running rights amen
[59:31] and then his branch is in order then it
[59:34] must bear forth fruit it must become
[59:37] fruitful so you can imagine now you got
[59:40] all the share holders waiting for the
[59:42] dividence and this branch is not doing
[59:45] well how are they going to get the
[59:47] dividend if this branch is not making
[59:49] money we talking about in the natural
[59:51] law if the branch is not doing well they
[59:53] say you got a car industry right a car
[59:55] franchise and that car franchise is not
[59:57] doing well how the shareholders going to
[1:00:00] get the dividends from
[1:00:04] there then there's something wrong with
[1:00:06] the branch but who do you go checkl in
[1:00:08] the branch the
[1:00:10] GP the one that's running the branch
[1:00:13] because something's wrong with the
[1:00:14] leadership
[1:00:15] day that's right so if a church remains
[1:00:20] stagnant and is not progressing and is
[1:00:23] not moving beyond his boundaries then
[1:00:26] there's something wrong with the
[1:00:28] ministry there's a leadership
[1:00:32] problem but if the church is
[1:00:35] progressing from Glory unto Glory from
[1:00:38] strength to strength from Grace to Grace
[1:00:42] amen amen and they progressing in the
[1:00:44] revelation of the word from drawing from
[1:00:47] his inexhaustible Fountain of Life and
[1:00:50] the word is becoming clearer and clearer
[1:00:53] then you know that this is a Ministry
[1:00:56] with a good which had a good foundation
[1:00:59] amen and now it's progressing over the
[1:01:02] world Amen it's becoming a fruitful bow
[1:01:05] extending his boundaries amen and
[1:01:08] therefore now is ready to take on
[1:01:10] spiritual Frontiers amen hallelujah you
[1:01:13] can't go take on spiritual Frontiers if
[1:01:15] you are
[1:01:16] shaky you can't take on spiritual
[1:01:19] Frontiers if you don't have that
[1:01:21] Foundation solid how can you extend out
[1:01:24] if your foundation can't hold firm fir
[1:01:26] yes amen but if the foundation is firm
[1:01:31] you got to have the wise master builder
[1:01:34] amen present amen
[1:01:38] yes the wise Master bull got to be in
[1:01:41] action you've got to be the one that
[1:01:43] started the
[1:01:45] foundation and if the wise Master bull
[1:01:47] started that and the foundation is solid
[1:01:49] it can now extend the boundaries and if
[1:01:51] you see what God is
[1:01:53] doing I'm just having a talk to the
[1:01:55] church
[1:01:56] amen if you can see what God is doing
[1:02:00] spiritually speaking then you can see
[1:02:03] where God is ready to take
[1:02:05] us the question we need to ask ourselves
[1:02:09] are we ready to Avail ourselves for the
[1:02:11] next
[1:02:12] step are we are we ready to completely
[1:02:15] surrender
[1:02:16] ourselves are we ready now if today
[1:02:20] tomorrow you get a call from the pastor
[1:02:22] say we got a demon case or we got a life
[1:02:24] and dead situation I need to come I need
[1:02:27] you to come with me are you ready to go
[1:02:31] there or you going to say no I'm just
[1:02:35] satisfied you got to know your position
[1:02:37] amen amen now not everybody is called to
[1:02:39] do that but they got to be those
[1:02:42] soldiers those gallon soldiers amen amen
[1:02:45] you can't just leave everything for the
[1:02:47] pastor or another ministering brother
[1:02:50] you got to have G soldiers in the
[1:02:51] assembly say Pastor I understand you
[1:02:54] can't make it there I will go to the I
[1:02:56] will go for that case there's a demon
[1:02:58] case in his house I will go take it amen
[1:03:01] don't worry brother Pastor I will go
[1:03:03] there it's a life and dead situation I'm
[1:03:05] going there I'm prayed up now don't go
[1:03:08] and look for praying up that time you
[1:03:10] better live a life pray that amen and
[1:03:14] you better know what you're talking
[1:03:15] about when you're facing a demon amen
[1:03:17] the first thing is to have discernment
[1:03:19] you got to discern the spirit yes you
[1:03:22] got to speak you know
[1:03:25] you know we we Face different people and
[1:03:28] different uh they say psychologists can
[1:03:31] spend a few minutes with you and buy
[1:03:33] your just by your facial makeup they can
[1:03:35] tell you what's wrong with you but
[1:03:37] discernment is
[1:03:39] different discernment don't just see the
[1:03:41] out amen you can even cover the outfit
[1:03:45] you can put a camouflage on the outside
[1:03:47] discernment goes inside it diagnoses
[1:03:50] inside you and it Contex what type of
[1:03:52] spirit is influencing you
[1:03:57] so Ephesians 4 4 says there is one body
[1:04:00] and one Spirit even as you are called in
[1:04:02] one hope of your calling one Lord One
[1:04:05] Faith one baptism one God and Father of
[1:04:08] all who is above all and through all and
[1:04:11] in you all but unto every one of us is
[1:04:14] given Grace according to the measure of
[1:04:17] the gift of Christ amen so we given
[1:04:20] Grace by the measure of the gift of
[1:04:22] Christ wherefore he said when he
[1:04:25] ascended upon us he led captivity
[1:04:26] captive and he gave gifts unto
[1:04:30] men now that he ascended what is it but
[1:04:33] that he also descended first into the
[1:04:35] lower parts of the earth he that
[1:04:37] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:04:39] up far above all Heavens that he might
[1:04:43] fulfill all things and he gave some
[1:04:45] Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:04:48] evangelists and some pasts and teachers
[1:04:51] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:04:53] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:04:56] the body of Christ till we all come in
[1:04:59] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:05:01] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:05:03] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:05:06] stature of the fullness of Christ but
[1:05:09] what what he says in verse 14 he says
[1:05:12] that we end fought being no more
[1:05:15] children toss to and fro amen and
[1:05:18] carried about with every wind of
[1:05:20] Doctrine yes amen so it become
[1:05:23] questionable into
[1:05:26] whether a person is under a true
[1:05:28] five-fold Ministry when they are tossed
[1:05:31] to and fro with every wi of
[1:05:36] Doctrine but the slate of men and
[1:05:38] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[1:05:41] weight to deceive but speaking the truth
[1:05:43] in love may grow up into into him in all
[1:05:47] things which is the head even Christ so
[1:05:51] you
[1:05:52] see if you got a true fire for Ministry
[1:05:55] you will not be tossed to and fro with
[1:05:57] every wi of Doctrine and that must be
[1:06:00] proved through the through the test of
[1:06:03] time amen and I know one
[1:06:07] thing starting from the foundations of P
[1:06:10] R's Ministry he wasn't TS to and fr he
[1:06:13] wasn't taken away by different doctrines
[1:06:15] that were coming by he stood in the
[1:06:18] center and he stood with the word and he
[1:06:21] stood he stood with what was given to
[1:06:23] him by God he didn't to whatever God
[1:06:27] gave him as his gift he stood it and
[1:06:30] then from there the batt is passed on
[1:06:32] and then he progressing to different to
[1:06:35] where God has placed the shepherd now
[1:06:38] and from where God placed the shepherd
[1:06:40] now is progressing to the people into
[1:06:43] where God is placing them now amen
[1:06:45] therefore you got to have the obedient
[1:06:47] voice amen and here what the Lord is
[1:06:50] speaking through the 54 Ministry where
[1:06:53] God is placing you positionally amen
[1:06:55] because only when you come into your
[1:06:57] position yes amen then you come to your
[1:07:00] adoption ceremony yes amen it starts
[1:07:04] from the shepherd first it starts from
[1:07:06] the five until the fivefold is adopted
[1:07:08] if the fivefold is not adopted come to
[1:07:10] the adoption
[1:07:12] ceremony then there's a problem you
[1:07:14] cannot progress further than death yes
[1:07:17] amen you hear the testimony of brother
[1:07:19] Caleb it came from the pulpit it came
[1:07:23] from the preaching that you must speak
[1:07:25] the word
[1:07:26] it came from the fivefold that you must
[1:07:28] speak the word and he took it amen so
[1:07:31] you see how it come you see God the
[1:07:32] order of
[1:07:36] things
[1:07:38] so God doesn't do things apparantly he
[1:07:41] does things in his order and he doesn't
[1:07:44] change it so you got to come into your
[1:07:46] position when you come into your
[1:07:47] position you come to your adoption
[1:07:49] ceremony amen and then when you come to
[1:07:51] your to your adoption ceremony you are
[1:07:53] now ready to go take on ERS take on
[1:07:56] Frontiers amen the only thing that will
[1:07:59] be left behind for you the only thing
[1:08:03] outstanding or the final part which is
[1:08:06] not even for you to do that part will
[1:08:08] happen you will have a body change but
[1:08:11] your part you must fulfill Hallelujah
[1:08:13] the other part you will get it you do
[1:08:16] your part and he'll do his part amen
[1:08:19] amen because from that Dimension come
[1:08:21] for your theophany to dve tail with you
[1:08:24] and touch me your theop want to Dove
[1:08:27] tail with something that is in the same
[1:08:29] image amen that two must be one amen it
[1:08:33] has to when you're using the word
[1:08:35] dovetail you must come to the image that
[1:08:37] you bypass amen oh yes but you are
[1:08:40] changing because you are coming to the
[1:08:42] word image as you are eating of the word
[1:08:45] yes and you can only come through that
[1:08:47] through the true fivefold Ministry and
[1:08:50] any through five4 Ministry must have the
[1:08:53] right foundations but we thank God you
[1:08:57] don't have to say you don't have to brag
[1:08:58] and say we got it the fruits will speak
[1:09:00] for itself when they ask Jes when when
[1:09:03] they asked Jes John the Baptist asked
[1:09:05] them if he's the one to come he said go
