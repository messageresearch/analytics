[5:12] in our everyday life
[5:14] amen so we amen we come at this time now
[5:17] to hear the word of the Lord and we see

[5:21] see that there must be an acceleration
[5:24] in the body of Christ amen amen for you
[5:27] to ascend into that spiritual realm that
[5:29] you ought to be amen the prophet of God
[5:32] says that if we do not become adopted

[5:41] son amen we talk when we talk about
[5:44] adoption we are talking about Old
[5:46] Testament we're talking about the
[5:47] ancient law and not the modern law we
[5:50] have now amen so the danger
[5:53] is that though you be a son now is the
[5:56] time to become an adopted son

[6:05] around not realizing what you have now

[6:14] two sons one goes into the world but he
[6:17] comes back home and he's adopted amen
[6:20] but there was a son who remained at
[6:23] home and he got upset because he was not
[6:26] living in his
[6:28] inheritance he father even told him son
[6:31] all that I have is yours but you never
[6:33] saw fit to use
[6:36] it so he didn't become an adopted son he
[6:39] just remained a son not knowing how to
[6:42] use his
[6:43] inheritance amen so the we'll praise the
[6:46] Lord amen just with that thought there

[16:42] time where there must be a performance
[16:45] of the prophecy amen amen and the word
[16:48] of God shall not return not in void God
[16:51] says I am not man that I should lie amen
[16:54] amen we also turn to the Book of
[16:56] Revelation chapter 10 reading from
[16:59] verses 8 to
[17:02] 11 and the voice which are heard from
[17:05] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[17:11] and take the little book which is open
[17:13] in the hand of the Angel which stand it
[17:16] upon the sea and upon the Earth the one
[17:19] that's oppressing the powers now amen
[17:23] right and I went unto the angel and said
[17:26] unto him give me the little book give me
[17:29] my inheritance give me my title deed and
[17:31] he said unto me take
[17:33] it and eat it

[17:39] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[17:43] honey amen you must partake of this word
[17:47] every part of this word you must eat it
[17:50] up amen you must eat this entire word
[17:54] that is given unto you amen amen and I

[17:59] for you to become the final voice in the
[18:01] final age to become the authority on the
[18:05] earth amen you must eat all this book
[18:09] you must take the title de that gives
[18:11] you your Authority that gives you your
[18:13] right amen
[18:15] yes and I took the little book out of
[18:17] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[18:19] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[18:22] soon as I eaten it in my my belly was
[18:25] butter and he said unto me now watch
[18:29] this part can only happen after you
[18:30] eating the book amen thou must prophesy
[18:34] again before many peoples and Nations
[18:37] and tongues and Kings amen amen because
[18:42] the word that you are eating must come
[18:45] to you must perform it amen amen it must
[18:48] manifest out amen amen that's how you
[18:51] prophesying again when all that you have
[18:53] eaten again from the book is now going
[18:55] to be manifested there must be a perform
[18:59] of it amen amen amen you may be seated
[19:02] sorry
[19:04] am amen so we speaking tonight for a
[19:07] little exaltation manifestation of the
[19:10] prophesied promise coming to pass amen
[19:14] amen there was always prophecies in the
[19:17] Bible and there was time when the
[19:19] prophecies had to be fulfilled yes amen
[19:22] but we speaking about our day and our
[19:25] time and our prophecy amen amen and this
[19:28] prophecy phy and the entire Bible if you
[19:31] look at it no matter what prophecy it
[19:33] was whether it was about I will send you
[19:35] sending whether it was to the children
[19:37] of Israel I will send you a deliverer
[19:39] when Joseph was telling them to them the
[19:40] Lord himself shall send a deliverer unto
[19:42] you amen right after 400 years that was
[19:46] prophecy but when Moses walks on the
[19:48] scene that prophecy coming to pass amen
[19:51] then asiah is prophesying a virgin shall
[19:52] conceive then when the angel appears to
[19:55] Mary and she said be unto me according
[19:57] to th word that proph prophecy coming to
[20:00] pass amen and when the Holy Ghost bir it
[20:03] there was a manifestation of that
[20:05] prophecy yes amen but the entire Bible
[20:10] had one purpose and one achievement amen
[20:14] amen it's one purpose and one
[20:16] achievement is
[20:17] Redemption is man coming back to his
[20:20] original condition amen man that has
[20:23] fallen in the Garden of Eden man that
[20:26] was put on the earth to be king of the
[20:27] earth amen
[20:29] yes that's why Satan when he lost the
[20:33] battle in heaven remember Michael
[20:38] defeated him Michael had two3 of the
[20:39] angels He had one3 of the
[20:41] Angels right and he was cast into the
[20:45] Earth then he took him a time with his
[20:47] demon powers to get this political
[20:49] system that's right demon powers in
[20:52] politics demon powers around the world
[20:55] systemen yes amen demon power in in
[20:58] science in education all over
[21:01] influencing man and we find that Satan
[21:06] now he had a purpose as
[21:09] well his purpose was to run this to have
[21:13] his kingdom on this Earth amen yes right
[21:16] so he had his kingdom now for 6,000
[21:19] years I mean if it wasn't so Jesus could
[21:22] have told him when he offered it to
[21:23] Jesus he said if you bow down to me I
[21:26] give you the
[21:27] kingdomes Jesus could have told him
[21:29] you're lying it's not your kingdom Jesus
[21:30] didn't say that because he is the God of
[21:33] this evil age this is his
[21:37] kingdom but because Adam had for feet in
[21:41] it Satan lost the battle in heaven and
[21:45] now he came to Earth and what he did he
[21:47] couldn't get to Adam there was no way he
[21:50] would get to
[21:52] Adam so what he did he went to the
[21:54] byproduct of man he went to Eve yes and
[21:58] he received him and brought the fall of
[22:01] Man but from there God still had a
[22:05] purpose and his purpose was to restore B
[22:09] man to the original condition amen and
[22:12] Satan is thinking now he's ruling the
[22:13] Earth but God got a
[22:16] purpose God got a purpose that he'll
[22:18] have sons and daughters who will come
[22:21] back to rule and Reign upon this very
[22:23] Earth hallelujah oh don't you know the
[22:25] saint shall sh upon the ashes of the
[22:27] wicked
[22:29] amen people are trying to achieve all
[22:31] the things in this Earth all the wealth
[22:34] and all the kingdoms they're trying to
[22:36] deceive people and achieve all these
[22:38] things in politics and so forth but they
[22:41] don't realize everything is set for the
[22:43] bride yes that's right amen because this
[22:47] is our place amen this is our domain we
[22:50] have to have a domain yes yes amen this
[22:52] is our
[22:53] kingdom but yeah we're going to rule and
[22:55] reign with Christ amen amen
[22:59] but we are in this age of adoption we
[23:03] are to receive a spirit of adoption yes
[23:08] amen and we receive the spirit of
[23:10] adoption just before the time it comes
[23:13] to the changing of the body amen so from
[23:16] the time we received the spirit of
[23:18] adoption to the till we went the
[23:21] Redemption of our body waiting for the
[23:22] Redemption of our bodies now which is a
[23:24] final part of the adoption right because
[23:28] now you you can't go into the New
[23:29] Kingdom with this body yes because
[23:31] that's an that's an eternal Kingdom now
[23:34] yes amen so you need an eternal body and
[23:37] this body is corruption but it must put
[23:39] on
[23:40] incorruption that can take you to live
[23:42] to Eternity amen because the soul is
[23:45] already saved the soul is already
[23:47] redeemed the soul is eternal
[23:51] amen but the body needs to be changed
[23:55] amen but from the time we but before the
[23:58] changing of the
[24:00] body there must be Sons and Daughters of
[24:03] God that come to maturity amen amen that
[24:07] taken this book that has been partaking
[24:10] of this book that not satisfied who says
[24:13] I just got that this I got the the
[24:16] message of the hour I believe that God
[24:18] sent a prophet and I believe the church
[24:21] order and Doctrine and so forth no we're
[24:23] talking about people that realizes what
[24:26] Redemption truly is amen because when
[24:29] you see Christ the mysty of God you must
[24:31] See Redemption from Genesis to
[24:34] Revelation amen and you must see that
[24:36] you had a part to play from the Old
[24:38] Testament going all the way to the New
[24:40] Testament everything was a type and
[24:42] Shadow Of You am amen thank
[24:52] amen so this is the age where Sons and
[24:55] Daughters of God must bring fruit fruit
[24:58] to
[25:00] Perfection amen we must bring fruit
[25:03] coming to Perfection it is not good
[25:07] firstly those that bear no fruit in his
[25:10] hour will be cast out yes will be cut
[25:13] taken
[25:14] out and those that just bear fruit will
[25:17] be
[25:18] purged and that's not a bad thing
[25:21] because Sons and Daughters of God has
[25:23] chastized they are purged for the
[25:25] purpose of bearing for much fruit yes
[25:28] amen so when God is purging you he
[25:31] doesn't want to say I'm satisfied I got
[25:32] the message of the hour I believe the
[25:34] prophet I'm bearing fruit now here's my
[25:36] fruit I believe the message and I'm
[25:38] standing firm with this message for 20
[25:40] years 30 years believing this message he
[25:44] wants you to Bear much fruit amen he
[25:47] wants you to bear fruit of perfection he
[25:49] wants you to manifest himself amen the
[25:53] very life of the vine must be shown
[25:55] forth
[25:58] amen amen IM imagine we had Jesus on the
[26:03] earth he was the complete word made
[26:07] flesh the fullness of the word he was
[26:09] working on the earth 2,000 years ago

[26:14] says the former treaties that are made o
[26:16] theophilos of all that Jesus began to do
[26:18] and
[26:19] teach so you never say just to teach
[26:22] what he says Jesus began to do and teach
[26:27] amen amen so he didn't just come and
[26:29] teach the
[26:31] word amen amen there had to be a
[26:34] performance amen amen amen there to be a
[26:38] performance of the word amen there to be
[26:41] a power and
[26:43] demonstration that this is not just
[26:45] man amen this is
[26:48] God Amen he's taking natural
[26:52] things right he's looking at natural
[26:54] circumstances in front of him and he's
[26:57] doing Supernatural things
[26:59] amen now every son and daughter of God
[27:03] must do the same if Christ is in him
[27:07] he's not walking just in his natural
[27:09] world like everybody
[27:10] else amen because you are now the word
[27:14] the fullness of the word has come in
[27:16] this day the fullness of the word is now
[27:19] in where in a many membered
[27:23] body it was God in human
[27:26] flesh 20 years
[27:29] ago God in a redeemed body in a
[27:32] prophet then where is God now because
[27:36] the part of Jes God in human flesh in
[27:38] Jesus Christ was done away with then he
[27:42] had to come in a prophet in a redeemed
[27:45] body but where is God
[27:47] now where is the manifestation of God
[27:51] now amen amen he now in full plain view
[27:55] in bright
[27:56] form amen
[28:07] want read this one quote before
[28:11] going he says wait till them seven
[28:14] Thunders utter their
[28:17] voices to that group who really can take
[28:20] the word of God and any day it will
[28:24] slice and cut and they can close the the
[28:29] evens they can shut this or do that
[28:32] whatever they want
[28:34] to now this is not an immature church
[28:37] amen yes
[28:39] amen now if people can't believe God for
[28:42] simple
[28:43] Miracles a to take how are they going to
[28:46] take this part of the
[28:48] word if people can't understand God is a
[28:51] supernatural God never walk in the
[28:54] Supernatural how are they going to take
[28:56] this part of the word now yes
[28:58] so he say no it was good for William
[29:01] Bram this is not for William brandham
[29:04] see what he says here wait till them
[29:06] seven UT voice to that group not talking
[29:10] about the one man
[29:11] Ministry who really can take the word of
[29:13] God and every there it will slice and
[29:17] cut and they can close the evens amen
[29:21] they can shut this or do that whatever
[29:24] they want to Glory he'll be slay by the
[29:28] word that proceed from his mouth is
[29:29] sharper than the two sword they could
[29:31] call for a 100 billion tons of flies if
[29:34] they wanted
[29:35] to but you see this is a mature Branch
[29:38] bunch of people they know what to do
[29:39] with the word amen whatever they say is
[29:42] going to happen because it's the word of
[29:43] God coming from the mouth of God Amen
[29:48] now he say listen to what he's saying
[29:49] here whatever they say right but he
[29:52] saying it's the word of God coming from
[29:53] the mouth of
[29:55] God now is God speaking or is they
[29:58] speaking amen they are the veil yes but
[30:02] what's working inside the veil Beyond
[30:04] the
[30:05] Veil they are uttering the voice right
[30:08] it's their vocal
[30:10] cords but beyond that Veil if you look
[30:12] beyond that Veil amen what you say it's
[30:15] the word of God coming from the mouth of
[30:18] God Amen yes amen thank you Lord because
[30:23] that's what they receive in the
[30:24] hour the whole entire word of God coming
[30:27] from the M of God
[30:28] God always is his word but he always
[30:31] uses man to work it
[30:34] yes God could have called for them flies
[30:37] down there in Egypt but he said Moses
[30:39] that's your
[30:41] job I just tell you what to do and
[30:43] you'll do it he fully done that he could
[30:46] have chosen the sun to call him he could
[30:48] have caused the moon to call it and and
[30:51] the or the wind to call it but he said
[30:52] Moses he chose he chooses men all right
[30:56] so where has God ever changed
[30:59] God always uses
[31:01] man now for God to use us it takes a
[31:04] full surrender to God Amen in order for
[31:08] God for the fullness for the for the
[31:10] word of God to be manifested for there
[31:13] to be a manifestation of the word to us
[31:15] there must be a
[31:16] surrender amen and the perfect example
[31:20] is it the prophet was an
[31:22] example he was the first Chief in way
[31:25] before us in this day a man surrendered
[31:27] to God that God could use him cuz God
[31:30] said I got a work for you to do and when
[31:32] he was surrendered to God God could use
[31:35] him for that work but now there has to
[31:37] be others that follow there are to be
[31:40] other sons of God that come into
[31:41] adoption in this hour amen he was the
[31:44] son of Jesus was the son of God coming
[31:45] to adoption brother brandham was the son
[31:48] of God coming to adoption then there
[31:49] must be other sons of God whose names
[31:52] are in the book that must come to
[31:53] adoption in this
[31:55] hour and they must come to an hour
[31:57] because when they come to adoption and
[32:00] maturity then the world is going to see
[32:02] Sons and Daughters of God am amen then
[32:06] the world going to say that's an example
[32:08] of Christ that's an example of Jesus
[32:11] Christ upon the Earth that's why people
[32:13] many people never understood brother
[32:15] Bram they never believed some of them
[32:17] never believe what he said but they
[32:18] couldn't pick on his life they couldn't
[32:20] pick on the way he operated because they
[32:22] knew that God was with
[32:25] him so just like that people must know
[32:28] that God is with
[32:30] you amen so that's if that was an
[32:33] adopted son of God coming this age now
[32:35] we taking this book if our names are in
[32:38] the book we must be the adopted sons of
[32:40] God in this
[32:42] age it can't be for another age there is
[32:46] no other age for the Gentile church amen
[32:50] amen in fact we out of the ages now we
[32:52] are in the bright age amen because from
[32:56] here the gospel is going to go go back
[32:58] to the Jews yes amen
[33:00] amen but before the time it goes back to
[33:03] the Jews Sons and Daughters of God are
[33:05] coming to adoption
[33:08] yes and what is bringing them to
[33:10] maturity and adoption it is the
[33:12] preaching of the
[33:14] word amen because God ordained the
[33:17] fivefold ministry for that purpose
[33:25] am but it was all prophecy prophesied
[33:30] and God's word must come to
[33:33] pass so the five for is going to Echo

[34:11] you back to what was lost in the Garden
[34:14] of Eden that is the purpose yes the

[34:19] redemption if you can take every part of
[34:21] the Bible from gen take every every
[34:25] prophecy every major prophet every minor
[34:27] prophet take all the the books of job
[34:30] and everything everything is about the

[34:34] Redemptive everything shows you God's
[34:36] Plan of Redemption amen amen and
[34:39] Redemption is not just for you because

[35:25] diet is going to make you a good healthy
[35:28] person
[35:29] amen now if you're a person that living
[35:33] that when you see the world you seeing
[35:35] it more from the from your carnal nature
[35:38] and you're looking at the world through
[35:40] your eyes you're living narrow-minded in
[35:43] your own world in your own eyes you're
[35:45] narrow-minded but you're not seeing the
[35:47] through God's eyes which is a bigger
[35:49] picture yes which is Redemption for the
[35:51] for everything and his old plan amen
[35:54] amen God's Plan of Redemption and you're
[35:56] not seeing this body this bride in a
[35:58] body amen you living in this
[36:00] narrow-minded world then how are you

[36:22] automatically think about worldly
[36:24] abundance no God talking about I'm
[36:26] talking about all of God's blessings
[36:29] everything amen where you live like a
[36:31] king on the earth because why you look
[36:33] you're thinking of your original
[36:35] condition there's a revelation that you
[36:37] receive and true Revelation firstly you
[36:40] receive this Revelation I'm an IM I
[36:43] cannot die I've already passed from
[36:46] Death unto life amen right that's once
[36:49] you have that fear is
[36:50] gone and the Bible said perfect love
[36:53] casted away all fear so when you have a
[36:56] revelation that I cannot die
[36:58] I passed already from Day Life what what
[37:00] all that Satan has over you so that's
[37:03] gone then he's going to give you you
[37:05] can't be lost yes because once you say
[37:09] once you are sealed with the Holy Ghost
[37:11] you can't you are sealed until the day
[37:13] of
[37:14] redemption then you know your salvation
[37:16] is secure then that fear is gone you see
[37:19] this is not denomination of baby
[37:20] teaching now amen amen you can't get
[37:23] this in
[37:24] denomination people are keep going to
[37:26] the altar confessing hoping that they'll
[37:28] be saved hoping that much the more they
[37:31] repent the more they'll be saved yeah
[37:33] you haven't done it in the first
[37:35] place you have that Revelation
[37:38] amen now we never had that under a
[37:41] denominational concept yes you have to
[37:43] come in the message of the hour amen
[37:45] amen amen because why a prophet have to
[37:47] go in the back part of God's mind to to
[37:51] show you that you always was with him oh
[37:53] yes and if you always was with him you
[37:56] cannot end see amen you always existed
[38:00] with him and he goes beyond
[38:02] that there's a feminist part of God
[38:05] which is part of he cannot be separated
[38:07] from it's it's makeup it's part of his
[38:11] attributes amen so you are connected
[38:14] with him amen that is why in this hour
[38:18] when he come say Adam Adam where are
[38:20] thou he said Lord I am here to have
[38:23] fellowship with you I am here to cry AB

[38:43] S yourself some fig leaves
[38:45] yes amen you're not covering it up with
[38:48] some form of religion but you can have
[38:50] fellowship with him any time amen that's
[38:53] why he took his son in his hour that
[38:55] come to adoption and said now walk with

[39:14] fellowshipping with him amen you are
[39:16] walking with him you are communing with

[39:26] prophesied of this bride that she'll be
[39:27] a sinless potless bride that she'll be a
[39:30] super Church she'll be a you got to take
[39:33] that part of the book you got to eat it

[39:38] to pass
[39:40] amen amen there must be a performance of
[39:43] it yes because thou must prophesy you're
[39:46] prophesy your part that's a performance
[39:48] of it amen
[39:50] amen but it all depends on your diet

[39:57] EST
[39:58] diet and you want to be like the Jones
[40:00] you want to be like everybody else and

[40:06] received the message of the hour and if
[40:08] that satisfies you that that just good
[40:09] for you and you're just bearing fruit
[40:12] but God wants you to Bear much fruit he
[40:15] wants you to bear fruit to perfection in
[40:16] this hour amen amen we are Marching to
[40:19] Perfection he wants Sons and Daughters
[40:22] Amen to manifest his word amen he want
[40:25] sons and daughters who can stand up for
[40:27] his his words yes amen Was Not Afraid
[40:30] amen of what anyone
[40:33] says amen when God put Adam in and Eve
[40:37] there in the in the Garden of Eden amen
[40:41] everything had to obey Adam yes amen
[40:45] everything have to wait every all nature
[40:48] had to wait for Adam's
[40:49] instruction amen and he had his Queen
[40:53] there amen everything was in harmony
[40:57] there was no problem with Adam and Eve
[40:59] there was no problem with the animals
[41:01] there was no animals fighting the lion
[41:04] and lamb was perfect amen yes Hallelujah
[41:08] there was no decaying of the
[41:10] leaves in like how you get in different
[41:12] seasons now there was no leaves for
[41:14] dying off
[41:15] amen there was no weeds in the ground
[41:19] everything was
[41:21] perfect so just like that God is
[41:24] bringing this bride now he's changing
[41:26] your Earth right now the first thing
[41:29] he's doing is making you have dominion
[41:31] over your Earth amen this Earth yes amen
[41:35] the first thing God is play you see
[41:37] sometime we say oh Satan is coming in my
[41:39] mind Satan is that Satan's coming your
[41:41] mind you have this old nature Satan is
[41:44] playing on their own nature so he comes
[41:46] on the Battleground yes because you
[41:48] already remember the flesh is already
[41:50] from the sinful nature we already
[41:52] inherited that to the birth the natural
[41:55] birth to the first birth we already
[41:57] inherited the sticky
[41:59] nature and then Satan knows what to do
[42:02] now he comes in a battleground of the
[42:04] mind
[42:06] right there when Jesus was on the earth
[42:10] he showed us what to do with Satan when
[42:12] he comes to tackle you in your mind you
[42:16] have to go back to the word and give him
[42:18] back the word yesen don't qu in carnally
[42:23] right you will lose every time yes you
[42:26] do not fight with flesh and blood but
[42:28] with powers and principalities and
[42:30] rulers of Darkness do not fight with
[42:33] Satan on Satan's grounds yes you will
[42:36] just end up a mess and you will lose on
[42:39] his Turf you need to fight with him in
[42:41] your Turf we are now seated in Heavenly
[42:43] places in Christ Jesus we are like

[42:48] heavenlies amen we fight a spiritual
[42:50] battle amen so you defeat him there amen

[43:04] if you're not eating of this book amen
[43:06] amen how are you going to prophesy again
[43:10] all you be prophesying is carnal things
[43:13] you'll be speaking caral things
[43:19] amen we find that Satan has had his
[43:23] church God has done with all the ages
[43:25] but at the end of all ages now when God
[43:29] was bringing his bride into Plain View
[43:31] amen we know that Satan is also 2
[43:35] million demons on the
[43:37] Earth but what is your worst demon that
[43:39] you can face now is your religious
[43:41] demons don't think Satan has not
[43:43] Advanced
[43:44] himself listen when Satan when the
[43:47] nicadan spirit started yeah right he
[43:50] crept in the church he kept in the
[43:52] original Church yes there was a Holy
[43:55] Ghost full Church
[43:58] and then it came all the way it went to
[43:59] the Dark Ages then you had Luda then it
[44:03] still crept in lud's message then you
[44:06] had Wesley it's still crep in there then
[44:08] you had the Pentecostal Lady it's still
[44:10] crep in there and then you had the
[44:13] message of the hour don't think it don't
[44:16] C creep in there because he said in the
[44:18] framework of the message amen this SE
[44:21] will be so close amen yes amen till
[44:24] he'll receive the very elected if
[44:25] possible do not think that people are
[44:27] not established in the message do not
[44:30] think people are just there there are no
[44:32] churches that people are set in the
[44:35] ways but the fruit you shall know
[44:38] them amen we are not satisfied then it
[44:41] serves no purpose if we want to just be
[44:43] set in a ways and we got an established
[44:45] we we believe everything but we're not
[44:47] moving in per we're not moving in
[44:50] progression now if the Holy Ghost Church
[44:52] the book of Acts was the act of the Holy
[44:55] Ghost right in the original Church and
[44:57] he said there must be a continuation of
[44:59] the book of Acts if there was a powerful
[45:01] church and if from there to now there's
[45:03] no progression then there's something
[45:05] wrong amen yes but we thank God that
[45:08] he's showing us he's positionally
[45:11] placing us amen amen that's what the
[45:14] true preaching of the word come to do is
[45:15] positionally placing
[45:17] you amen that is why when you sit in
[45:20] church when you look at your brother and
[45:22] sister when you look at the preacher
[45:23] look Beyond the Veil amen you must
[45:25] understand when God is talking to you
[45:27] he's talking to you for a purpose I
[45:29] don't think I don't think we living in a
[45:31] age where people want to preach flowery
[45:33] sermons he's not going to do anything
[45:35] for us we want to preach something and
[45:37] believe something okay ask yourself this
[45:39] one question whatever you do in
[45:42] life is that relevant to Give Me
[45:44] rapturing Faith just ask yourself the
[45:46] one question am I doing this thing in
[45:48] life am I understanding this is it
[45:50] giving me rapturing Faith because our
[45:52] purpose is to leave the Earth our
[45:54] purpose is to make the Rapture amen but
[45:57] before we have the Final Redemption of
[46:00] the body there must be a
[46:02] display amen of sons and God adopted to
[46:07] God Sons and Daughters adopted in sour
[46:11] amen there must be a final display
[46:14] amen there must be an ins sign there's
[46:18] always been an ins sign there must be an
[46:20] ins sign in this hour and that is a
[46:23] bride coming to adoption in the hour
[46:30] amen we could look at our Mark and say
[46:32] look at this was a prophet of God and we
[46:34] could see God in that man everything we
[46:37] talk about we see God in that man that
[46:39] was our example of God in a man in the
[46:41] hour so we must attain to people must
[46:45] see God in us and say God in that man
[46:49] God in that sister yes when you speak to
[46:51] somebody have you ever spoke life into
[46:54] somebody and said and then the person
[46:55] said to you that not you speaking that
[46:58] is God
[47:03] [Music]
[47:05] speaking
[47:08] amen John 15
[47:11] says I am the True Vine and my father is
[47:15] the husband man every branch in me that
[47:19] beareth not fruit he take it
[47:22] away and every branch that beared fruit
[47:25] he purged it
[47:27] that it may bring forth more fruit amen
[47:30] so God is Not Just satisfied with you
[47:32] having just fruit he wants more fruit
[47:35] amen so he doesn't want you to just be
[47:38] stagnant in your work yes there must be
[47:41] a progression in your work
[47:44] amen I mean brought this message to show
[47:47] you that I'm going to be setting up
[47:49] another
[47:50] kingdom and you are going to be my queen
[47:52] in the kingdom hallah and don't you know
[47:56] the same shall judge the Earth that
[47:59] people are going come to a judgment in
[48:01] the white Throne judgment you'll be
[48:03] sitting there as a
[48:05] judge and don't you know that he that
[48:08] gave a glass of water to one of these my
[48:10] little one shall not surely not lose the
[48:13] rewards amen don't you know the grace
[48:17] that you have to
[48:18] share amen the mercy that you have to
[48:21] share just because you are the bride
[48:24] because of people's association with you
[48:26] for the good deed that they did to you
[48:28] they only lose their
[48:30] reward you're not just any type of
[48:32] people on the
[48:33] earth now how much more for the people
[48:36] that do bad to you as well it's better
[48:38] than a milstone should be put upon them
[48:43] amen so he says now ye clean to the word
[48:47] which I have spoken unto you abide in me
[48:51] and I in
[48:54] you as the branch cannot bear fruit of s
[48:57] except you abide in the vine no more can
[48:59] ye except you abide in me I am the vine
[49:02] ye are the branches he that abided in me
[49:05] and I in him the same bringeth forth
[49:07] much fruit for without me ye can do
[49:10] nothing if a man abide not in me is cast
[49:13] forth as a branch and is withered and
[49:16] Men gather them and cast them into the
[49:18] fire and they are burned but if abide in
[49:21] me and my words abide in you they shall
[49:24] ask what you will and it shall be done
[49:26] done unto you here in my father is
[49:29] glorified that ye bear much fruit so
[49:32] shall ye be my disciples you see how God
[49:35] is glorified when you bear for much
[49:38] fruit amen amen so when people see God
[49:41] in you God is
[49:43] glorified when the people see Christ in
[49:45] you God is glorified amen but if the
[49:47] people see your sticky nature and they
[49:49] see the old condition the adamic
[49:51] condition how is God going to be
[49:53] glorified yes amen amen so if you want
[49:56] God to be glorified in this you must
[49:58] display his nature amen amen you must
[50:02] display his
[50:03] attributes
[50:08] amen now watch what he says here the
[50:11] people who took his Revelation from God
[50:14] became the living Apostles yes read and
[50:17] known of all men for their
[50:19] generation what he says people who took
[50:21] his
[50:22] Revelation from
[50:24] God they became the Living Word the
[50:27] living Apostles
[50:29] right when the Methodist failed God
[50:32] raised up others and so it has gone
[50:34] through the years until in this last day
[50:36] there is G again another people in the
[50:40] land who under their messenger yes will
[50:44] be the final voice to the final age
[50:47] amen yes sir the church is no longer the
[50:50] mouthpiece of God it his own mouthpiece
[50:55] so God is turning on Earth
[50:57] he will confound her to the prophet and
[51:00] the
[51:00] bribes now when the prophet was on the
[51:03] earth whenever you had God a prophet on
[51:06] the earth the prophet will tell the
[51:08] state what to do the prophet will tell
[51:12] either bring judge pronounce judgment to
[51:14] the state or pronounce something but
[51:17] they will say what what must happen but
[51:20] the church and state don't mix
[51:23] together now if we are to be the final
[51:25] mouthpiece of God
[51:27] we will dictate what happens on the
[51:28] earth we should be telling the people
[51:30] what is to become on the earth so if you
[51:33] want while you on the earth if you want
[51:36] a blessing if you want something you can
[51:38] speak it you can prophesy amen amen you
[51:41] have the authority to speak it like
[51:43] Esther spoke amen you can change the
[51:46] decree of the laws of the land while you
[51:48] are here because let me tell you
[51:50] something the reason why everything is
[51:52] okay right now is because of the Bride
[51:55] is suppressing the powers
[51:57] amen
[51:59] amen so Grace is on the Earth because of
[52:02] you yes but the minut you leave the
[52:06] Earth from the false prophet it goes
[52:08] into the Beast amen and then Satan
[52:12] incarnate into a pope right now he just
[52:14] the false prophet but he's going to
[52:16] change and then watch what's going to
[52:18] happen on the Earth when the bride
[52:19] leaves the
[52:22] Earth so he says so God is turning on
[52:26] her he will confound her through the
[52:28] prophet and the bride for the voice of
[52:31] God will be in
[52:33] her so where's the voice of God now
[52:37] amen amen where's the voice of
[52:39] God so what are we speaking when the
[52:43] world sees us are we speaking like them
[52:47] are we joining them in all the negative
[52:49] things they say or we have hope or we
[52:52] are people that can prophesy yes life
[52:56] amen a people that can pray for the sick
[52:58] and they will recover yes a people are
[53:00] not afraid no matter what the doctors
[53:02] told them it can be cancer it can be
[53:04] death but you are able to speak to the
[53:06] sickness amen that you are able to
[53:09] you're not afraid of the
[53:11] circumstances the only time you'll be
[53:12] afraid to go pray for someone that is
[53:14] sick if you don't have faith to believe
[53:16] that they'll be
[53:17] healed amen but he says for the voice of
[53:22] God will be in
[53:24] there yes if it is for it says in the
[53:29] last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the
[53:32] spirit and the bride say come
[53:36] amen once more the world will he direct
[53:40] from God as at Pentecost but of course
[53:44] that word bride will be reputated as in
[53:47] the first age yes amen now he cried now
[53:52] he has cried out to this last age you
[53:54] have the word
[53:56] you have more Bibles than ever now we
[53:58] can say we've got the whole opening of
[54:00] the word I want you to take it to us now
[54:03] we've got the entire word open to us
[54:05] right the Seven Seals have been opened
[54:08] amen the seven Thunders have Ed their
[54:11] voices you have more by we have all the
[54:13] messages amen we have them in book form
[54:16] we have them in tape form we have them
[54:18] in digital form
[54:20] amen and we have the fivefold ministry
[54:22] around the world but you're not doing
[54:25] anything about the word
[54:28] except dividing and acing it into
[54:31] pieces so God don't want that he doesn't
[54:33] want us to divide he doesn't want to
[54:35] debate about the word debate of
[54:37] different doctrines into pieces taking
[54:39] what you want and leaving out what you
[54:41] don't want don't take out any
[54:44] Scripture amen don't take out the
[54:46] scripture that day in the Bible don't
[54:48] say there was for another day don't say
[54:50] that was good for the days of the
[54:52] Prophet amen he said taking what you
[54:56] want and leaving out what you don't
[54:59] want maybe you don't have the gift for
[55:01] that or you don't have the faith for
[55:03] that but don't take it out don't take
[55:06] out from the word amen if you don't have
[55:08] faith to believe the word don't take it
[55:09] out of the word maybe that someone else
[55:12] will have faith for it pray for the
[55:14] brother you are not interested in living
[55:17] it but debating
[55:19] it I would sooner you were called Art
[55:23] now he's speaking to letter but I'm
[55:25] getting something to you here we have
[55:27] the fullness of the word we saying we
[55:30] might have all the word but they also
[55:32] telling us leave the leave the preaching
[55:34] of the word just push play they are
[55:36] telling us different things we don't
[55:38] want to debate anymore we got no time
[55:40] for that we are in a Battle Ground here
[55:43] amen and the battle is
[55:45] Raging amen the battle is Raging you got
[55:48] 200 million demon disguise in different
[55:50] forms amen you got them in the churches
[55:54] you got them in politics you got them
[55:56] all over
[55:57] amen so we got no time to debate we got
[56:00] no time to
[56:01] fuss that is why you find a true son and
[56:04] daughter of God always the prophet of
[56:05] God can prophesy the word and he goes
[56:07] goes
[56:08] away you got no time to fast with them
[56:11] he gives them the word and he just goes
[56:13] away he doesn't fast for them and make
[56:15] them you want to believe this no he does
[56:18] he got no time to talk he just come and
[56:19] do
[56:21] amen but when you simply take my word
[56:24] and don't honor it
[56:27] I in return must refuse to honor you now
[56:30] he told us to the lean age let us not
[56:33] make that same mistake when he's given
[56:34] us all the word amen we got to manifest
[56:37] our parts amen the man there must be a
[56:39] manifestation of our part of the word
[56:41] now you can't have the word from 1965
[56:44] till the prophet go off the scene from
[56:46] that time to now the word has stor up
[56:48] stor up and then the word was going
[56:49] around the world we can't have the
[56:53] word and going to the hour of the
[56:55] rapture but the bride hasn't made an
[56:58] impact on the
[56:59] earth amen yes that's the
[57:03] fact there must be an impact the people
[57:05] must recognize that the authority of the
[57:07] church or the authority of the word is
[57:09] in the brides amen amen yes the
[57:12] authority of scripture is with the bride
[57:15] yes no one can debate on scripture the
[57:16] authority of the scripture must be with
[57:18] the bride amen amen and all the workings
[57:21] of the Holy Ghost must be in the bride
[57:23] amen all nine spiritual gifts must be in
[57:26] the brides all gifts of the Spirit must
[57:29] be displayed among the bride all seven
[57:32] virtues must be in the
[57:36] brides amen no one else should be no one
[57:40] else has the authority in he said she be
[57:43] his mouthpiece God said that so every
[57:47] other voice who speaks don't have
[57:49] authority to speak amen every voice must
[57:52] be shut up amen but when she speaks
[57:57] she's speaking with authority because he
[58:00] has ordained it
[58:02] amen he said she'll be his
[58:06] mouthpiece
[58:08] amen so all that was prophesied must be
[58:11] manifested in this hour amen
[58:17] amen he said now remember this Christ in
[58:21] the true church is a continuation of the
[58:25] book of Acts yes but the Book of
[58:28] Revelation shows out that the Antichrist
[58:31] Spirit would come into the church and
[58:33] defile it make it luk Wang formal and
[58:36] Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his
[58:41] works right down to the time he is cast
[58:44] into the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[58:46] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[58:48] people get the true revelation of the
[58:52] true church and what she is
[58:56] what she stands for and that she can do
[59:00] the Greater Works she will be an
[59:01] invincible Army if they get a true
[59:04] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[59:06] framework of the Christian church and by
[59:09] God's spirit discern and wi the
[59:12] Antichrist Spirits you can't be living
[59:15] this hour without discernment amen you
[59:17] must be able to discern the spirits and
[59:19] how you do that God has put the Watches
[59:22] Over You amen that's why he has Watchmen
[59:25] amen
[59:26] God has Watchmen true Watchmen who can
[59:29] discern what they put there for a
[59:31] purpose to discern the spirit that will
[59:33] come in the church that will come and so
[59:35] seeds of the
[59:37] stenes
[59:40] amen he said
[59:42] Satan will be powerless before he will
[59:45] be as definitely twed today as when
[59:48] Christ with stod his every effort to
[59:50] gain power over him in the desert yes
[59:54] Satan hats revelation but we love it
[59:57] amen with true Revelation in our lives
[59:59] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:00:01] against us but we will prevail against
[1:00:05] over it amen in this last quote just
[1:00:08] want to give you the prophet is giving
[1:00:10] an illustration about a fire the this
[1:00:12] Winchester firearm that he had and when
[1:00:15] he shot it it managed to shoot a certain
[1:00:18] distance but when he rode up to them
[1:00:20] they said he cannot go there but he's
[1:00:22] saying I know he did
[1:00:24] that so he's saying here I started to
[1:00:26] shoot the squirrel I find out I hit him
[1:00:28] somewhere else beside in the high I got
[1:00:30] nervous I tried again on paper and it
[1:00:32] wouldn't eat the target it would hit
[1:00:35] within or quarter of an inch or half an
[1:00:37] inch something at 50 yards but I know it
[1:00:40] would do better than that I done
[1:00:42] everything to the gun that I know how to
[1:00:44] do and nothing seemed to fix up right so
[1:00:48] I wrapped it up in a box sent it back to
[1:00:50] the Winchester company for Examination
[1:00:52] for rebedding they wrote me an nice
[1:00:54] letter I have my file at home and said
[1:00:56] Reverend brandham that rifle would Will
[1:00:59] Group an inch in a 25 yards said is just
[1:01:03] a model 75 it's not a Target gun it's
[1:01:06] just a little plinker and said you'll
[1:01:08] never get any better than that now that
[1:01:10] was the Winchester company that made the
[1:01:12] gun said every an inch and 25 yards and
[1:01:17] I drove nine straight OES in 50 yards
[1:01:20] now here's my thought my wife said now
[1:01:22] look B she said if the company who made
[1:01:23] the rifle will just say that and and it
[1:01:26] won't do no better than that then who
[1:01:28] are you to say that I said honey here is
[1:01:31] what it is I don't care what the company
[1:01:33] says I've seen it do it and I know it'll
[1:01:36] do it and I sat down there when the
[1:01:39] other Brethren were shooting squirrels
[1:01:42] anyway they wanted to hit them was all
[1:01:44] right m center back anyway I sat under a
[1:01:46] tree and I was crying I said God I'm so
[1:01:49] nervous I can't hold myself together why
[1:01:51] did you make me a little nervous fellow
[1:01:53] like this and I realize when I'm
[1:01:55] standing here the before me and a voice
[1:01:57] just as plain as you would hear mind
[1:01:59] said you were made thus for a purpose
[1:02:02] because until you know that the rifle is
[1:02:05] going to zero once because if it's zero
[1:02:08] once rather it will Zero again it's the
[1:02:11] same rifle
[1:02:13] amen therefore I see if you're obeying
[1:02:17] this word taking this original taking
[1:02:20] this range finder and bring it down to a
[1:02:22] place till I can see the same thing
[1:02:24] those apostles saw the same gospel they
[1:02:27] preach it will produce the same results
[1:02:30] so if the same word that brother Brandon
[1:02:33] was seeing and he's seeing the results
[1:02:35] and we have received his word today amen
[1:02:38] we believe this word amen that we must
[1:02:40] see the same results amen amen amen you
[1:02:42] got to zero it in because we got this
[1:02:44] range finder amen you got to follow the
[1:02:47] guid in this hour amen if you follow the
[1:02:50] guide he going to lead you the same
[1:02:51] every time thank you Lord amen
[1:02:58] now you find that some
[1:03:01] people are trying to find the guide the
[1:03:04] wrong way they don't you see the guide
[1:03:07] doesn't work like that like how people
[1:03:09] think some people are not under edip
[1:03:12] they can't submit to Authority they
[1:03:14] can't submit to a edip when God has
[1:03:16] placed edip in the church and God has
[1:03:19] set them as Watchman over the church
[1:03:20] amen and that's how the guide is working
[1:03:23] if you're not sitting under Authority
[1:03:25] how you going to of the guides God has
[1:03:27] always put man and man to lead the
[1:03:30] people amen and the man is leading the
[1:03:34] people in this hour to get them ready
[1:03:35] for Rapture he's showing them how they
[1:03:39] can come to their position amen but if
[1:03:42] we going to be people that now we just
[1:03:44] going to be at home I'll play the tape
[1:03:47] I've got the message of the hour I'll
[1:03:48] just follow the thing here and I don't
[1:03:50] want to submit to any Authority but I've
[1:03:51] got the tape how is that following God's
[1:03:55] plan for the age
[1:03:56] amen then you're taking out scripture
[1:03:58] you cannot take out the word Ephesians 4
[1:04:01] says I have gave some to be Apostles
[1:04:04] some to be pastors and the prophet of
[1:04:06] God says the pastor is the highest
[1:04:07] Authority in the church and your pastor
[1:04:09] will see you through now show me where
[1:04:12] did he ever come and take that
[1:04:15] out
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:18] amen the church remember the church is
[1:04:21] the female right he's typing the female
[1:04:23] and she has to be under agship yes just
[1:04:25] like in the home if the woman is not
[1:04:27] under the headship of the husband then
[1:04:30] she's not under God she's not obeying
[1:04:31] God at all amen she's not under
[1:04:33] Authority so if the female doesn't want
[1:04:36] to be in a church or congregation
[1:04:39] doesn't want to be in a church and just
[1:04:40] going maybe Church hopping and don't
[1:04:42] want to be under submission or listening
[1:04:44] to the message at home they're not under
[1:04:46] submission so they don't have a headen
[1:04:48] they're not obeying their
[1:04:50] head so he says but if he is God ever
[1:04:54] God he is still God he always was God
[1:04:57] and he can be nothing else but God and
[1:04:59] he's God Eternal therefore we want to
[1:05:01] look to the Target now what Target the
[1:05:04] church is shooting at but sorry not what
[1:05:08] Target the church is shooting at but
[1:05:11] what Target that Christ is shooting
[1:05:13] at we look for Christ to appear appear
[1:05:17] the same Jesus he said when he was on
[1:05:20] earth a little while and the world seeth
[1:05:22] me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll
[1:05:26] be with you to the end of the world the
[1:05:29] same one who could direct the word and
[1:05:31] the word direct it right straight onto
[1:05:34] the Target that same Lord Jesus is here
[1:05:38] this morning in the form of the Holy
[1:05:39] Spirit to direct our thoughts and focus
[1:05:41] down to his word to one true and living
[1:05:44] God to one purpose and to one
[1:05:46] achievement amen and if he'll just let
[1:05:49] him do it he will focus the word right
[1:05:52] into a place that will prove that he the
[1:05:55] same yesterday today and forever thank
[1:05:57] you Lord depends on what you want to
[1:05:59] look at now it's good to say
[1:06:03] God God is with us but God has moved
[1:06:06] from God above us God With Us now he
[1:06:10] moved to God in us amen so when it's God
[1:06:14] in us we are now the mouthpiece of God
[1:06:18] that when you speak it is God speaking
[1:06:20] through you amen amen that's why when
[1:06:23] you see your brother look Beyond the
[1:06:24] Veil when you look at your sister look

[1:06:31] know that God is speaking
[1:06:35] amen this last quote when a man
[1:06:38] confesses his sins and gets right with
[1:06:40] God and God drops the sin of his
[1:06:42] convention into the blood of his own
[1:06:44] blood and forgives that sin and he
[1:06:47] places in that man the original spirit
[1:06:49] that should be in there paragraph 83
[1:06:57] his own Spirit making him a Son of God
[1:07:00] how much more ought the creative power
[1:07:03] of God to be in the church amen it
[1:07:06] breaks down every wall of sin it breaks
[1:07:08] down people today today try to say those
[1:07:12] words was back for another age it is if
[1:07:15] you still out from under that
[1:07:17] blood but if you're under the blood the
[1:07:19] power of God by his word Remains the
[1:07:23] Same it's got to be the same if he could
[1:07:27] do that by the blood of sheep and
[1:07:29] animals what about the blood of Jesus
[1:07:31] Christ how he could do it we must cope
[1:07:34] our lives and focus it to the word of
[1:07:36] God just like that we would a picture
[1:07:40] camera or try to get the right Focus
[1:07:42] before we snap it and then we got the
[1:07:45] real true picture that's what we want to
[1:07:48] do to focus our lives into Jesus Christ

[1:07:53] become the same person you you are a son
[1:07:56] adopted to God by the blood of the
[1:07:58] righteous Jesus Christ then the church
[1:08:01] would be moving on without friction
[1:08:04] without Earth without arm without doubts
[1:08:07] without Scruples without friction it
[1:08:09] will be moving in the power of the word
[1:08:12] of God manifesting every divine blessing
[1:08:17] that God promised to it if it just do
[1:08:21] that you see if it just do that if the
