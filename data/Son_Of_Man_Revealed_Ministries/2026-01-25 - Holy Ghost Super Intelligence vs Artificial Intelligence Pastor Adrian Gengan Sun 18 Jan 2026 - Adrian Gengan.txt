TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So let's turn to Isaiah 1:19 for opening scripture. It says, "Come now and let us reason together, sayeth the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as [music] snow." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as will. &gt;&gt; So that's what the blood of Jesus can do. Completely change our lives and turn us around. I want to get to the next verse. There's a promise attached now. If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land. &gt;&gt; But there's the downside to it. There's pros and cons to everything, right? &gt;&gt; Here's the con. If you re if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. &gt;&gt; 1 Kings 19, we read 11 and 12. So this is the prophet Elijah here on the mountain. And he said, "Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord." And behold, the Lord passed by and a great and a strong wind [music] read the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord. But the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind and earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire a still small voice. So that still small voice is the Holy Spirit. [music] &gt;&gt; Now the promise of the Holy Spirit was given when our Lord Jesus ascended to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He told him to tell me in the upper room. when he was ascending he said you shall receive power now as the world becomes more dependent upon artificial intelligence and you'll find it even coming into your very own devices that artificial intelligence is available to all of us &gt;&gt; now you can use artificial intelligence in a limited way and you can use it like Google to ask you questions and it'll answer you or you can use it in a much more advanced ways and know how to prompt it there's an intelligence designed that will unlock an entire new world to you. &gt;&gt; But the key is knowing how to prompt it, knowing how to work with it, knowing how to give it the right commands. &gt;&gt; Now, that is called artificial. There's no animal intelligent as a man. Man is the highest form of intelligence on the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants us to be able to use not now our own human intelligence, but within us, he's given us something that's called supreme intelligence. &gt;&gt; This intelligence is not the intelligence of the mind. &gt;&gt; This intelligence is supernatural intelligence. The Holy SPIRIT, IF YOU'LL HEAR WHAT THE how the Lord Jesus describes him, he's called a comforter. He's called a teacher. He's called the guide. He's called the spirit of truth. He's called the advocate. &gt;&gt; He's called the seal. &gt;&gt; He's called the token. Can you see how intelligent this supreme intelligence is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's here to lead [singing] man and guide man in every area of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, WE CAN CHOOSE TO IGNORE THAT WITHIN us or we can unlock its full potential. Amen. &gt;&gt; Many people in this life don't want to move ahead with technology. People still want to live in an awesome buggy age. &gt;&gt; They're Amish. They refuse to acknowledge scientific progress. &gt;&gt; So they still travel by awesome cut. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; And maybe even with us, some of us say, "Oh, you know what? I'm old school. I don't depend on technology. I don't depend on these things." Then you still can live in an awesome bike age. Now the prophet of God would tell us that my my uh great-grandfather traveled in an oen buggy and he say my father traveled in a certain thing. He says I travel in an automobile and he says I'm expecting my grandchildren to travel by jet plane. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So as science progresses the church of God was also supposed to progress. &gt;&gt; We are not behind science. The prophet of God in his day said, "Science has taken man farther in the realms of the spir in the realms of science than the preachers have taken the church in the realms of the spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to say that's not so this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] We are taking you into the realms of the spirit where we are now seated together in heavenly places where all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can choose to ignore this intelligence that's within us. And I want you to know something about this intelligence. I'm going to [music] first now talk about artificial intelligence. The creators of artificial intelligence, they call them the godfathers of artificial intelligence are sending warnings to the world. They're saying what we started to create, he said it's going to cause chaos on the earth. &gt;&gt; They are starting to warn about this artificial intelligence and they say it's eventually going to lead to the destruction of mankind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to know that when a prophet sees things, he sees something ahead of time and he probably can't fully describe it. &gt;&gt; Was it Ezekiel? You saw chariots with light torches, &gt;&gt; but he was talking about cars. Now when Daniel was seeing this image of the beast uh this beast representing the kingdoms when he saw [music] it get into iron and clay. It takes a prophetic gift now to be able to interpret that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROPHETIC GIFT ALSO UNFOLDS ITSELF. Praise the Lord. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Because you'll find if you do a study on it, the prophet will not only attach you to one thing in particular. Yes. &gt;&gt; He first says [singing] it's the it's between the the the Roman Catholics and the Protestants. &gt;&gt; Then he talks about communist and the other side. &gt;&gt; So he's not detailing it to one thing. It's an unfolding revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now iron, like I said, it's the 26th chemical compound. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And clay is where man was taken from the earth. So, could it be that it finally gets to where it's going to be an artificial intelligence they're trying to join with man and what they will eventually try to present as the mark of the beast? I said it's an unfolding revelation. &gt;&gt; Remember, there's coming a time now where no man will be able to buy or sell except he take the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; Could this be the year that the money system collapses? &gt;&gt; That they go back on the gold standard. Who owns the wealth of the world? The gold. &gt;&gt; America owns the the the largest supply of gold. &gt;&gt; Germany comes next and next is Rome. &gt;&gt; But there's a catch there. Because the prophet says Rome holds the gold of the world. [music] &gt;&gt; And he says the Jews hold the paper in Wall Street. &gt;&gt; He says they're going to come together and form an alliance and a and agreement. But he says they're going to break the covenant. Amen. You know these things because of the valley of the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; The prophet revealed all of these things to us. [music] &gt;&gt; And he says how they will come now and they will destroy the present money day system. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we have moved now. And if you notice on January 3rd, significant changes, significant things happened on January 3rd this year. That fault line started to crack on January 3rd. It was on January 3rd that Trump decided to invade Venezuela &gt;&gt; and take captive that president. &gt;&gt; So January 3rd already things started to shift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something that was out of desperation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Like I told you on Wednesday, they starting to get rid of the petro dollar which is the dollar which was an an international currency. in which to trade by &gt;&gt; and now they're going and they're using normal currencies and this bricks is causing major upsets in the world. &gt;&gt; All the nations that are aligned with bricks are causing major tensions in the world and that's why USA can't stand it now because that's an opposition [music] force to them. But what I'm trying to show you in all of this, God's prophetic calendar is moving along. &gt;&gt; And this was all prophesied. This was all spoken about. Now we seeing it unfolding before our very own eyes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now before before Alaska go before California sings, the bride will be gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, are we prepared for this hour? And when I'm asking, are we prepared for the hour? God has given us something [music] to help us in this time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't call the refilling of the Holy Ghost the dynamics for nothing. Yes, [music] &gt;&gt; it means that supreme intelligence has got to awaken within us. &gt;&gt; And like I said, we can choose to ignore this intelligence that's given to us. &gt;&gt; If God has opened up technology to us, we should use it for God's kingdom. But the Bible says the television could have been a blessing, but it's become a curse. &gt;&gt; Listen to the still small voice. &gt;&gt; We can know you got a technology. Some people still get lost everywhere they go, but they got a phone and they got Google Maps. No me I don't rely on that thing then that woman is giving me all wrong directions [music] we can choose to ignore something that's given to us or we can unlock it full potential &gt;&gt; I say it again the Holy Ghost is our supreme supernatural intelligence given to us in this time and season &gt;&gt; but many people are ignoring it many people don't know how to activate it &gt;&gt; now if it's the TEACHER YOU'RE ALLOWED TO ASK A teacher questions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So only of us have activated the anointing of teacher, the Holy Ghost in me and say, "Holy Ghost, please lead me and guide me in this. I need an answer to this. You are my teacher." &gt;&gt; Amen. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Please teach me this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we can't do it in the noise of all the other voices. We've got to get alone and be quiet with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Knowing how to hear the spirit's voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When in a certain problem, a certain struggle, go to the inner teacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; He's called a guide. &gt;&gt; How about we activate THE GUIDE? &gt;&gt; WHEN WE'RE GOING THROUGH A PROBLEM, A SITUATION, and maybe heartache and and depression and brokenness and anxiety, he's called a comforter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I need to phone Dr. [music] Abdul Muhammed and phone and check the psychologist if he's available. No, &gt;&gt; you've given &gt;&gt; a comforter. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You don't believe your brother. I'll take you to court. Come here. I'll put a lie detector test, but he's called the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul didn't go to call brother Joshua and say, "Come here, brother Joshua. I need an affidavit." when he [singing] was dealing with Ananas and Safh give me a sworn affidavit that you didn't sell this land for this amount he relied on the spirit of truth &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you this hidden intelligence given to us [music] that we don't use &gt;&gt; he's called a guide he's called a comforter he's called a teacher [music] he's called a spirit of wisdom &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; he can unlock within us potentials And do you know that the this becomes now personified in us that you become when the Holy Ghost is in you and you fully surrender to him. You walk into the room and the Holy Ghost walks into a room. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you speak, they hearing the spirit of wisdom. [music] &gt;&gt; When you speak, they're hearing the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not detached from us. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost becomes one with us when we are so healed and surrendered to him. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
