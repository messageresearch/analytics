========================================

So, I walked out from the room there and when I walked in here, it's very stuffy. Maybe we can get the air con on a bit. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So next week, Sunday, there'll be a combined service on the 10th. Amen. Our pastor Dan Matanga from Harare uh Zimbabwe will be ministering. Amen. 4 p.m. at the Derbell Secondary School. So, Amen. If you know Pastor Dan Matanga, he preached for us last year and he spoke on the spirit hanging over you. Amen. If you remember that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're blessed to have him again this year.

So we greet everyone in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also welcome once again our see our pastor Denel's mom here. Amen. God bless you. May you be blessed in the presence of the Lord. Amen. Let's turn to Luke chapter 8. Amen. will speak a title that's maybe called what the prophet used God's provided place of worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I use a subtitle, I'll say knowing the time and season that we are living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so easy to be deceived &gt;&gt; if we don't know the time and season. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke 8:9 And his disciples asked him, saying, "What might this peril will be?" And he said, "Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to others in parables that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. So present the gospel and walk away. &gt;&gt; Don't break your head. &gt;&gt; What is Jesus saying? They are seeing the scriptures you are showing them but they will not see it. &gt;&gt; And they are hearing the scriptures you are telling them but they don't understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Now the parable is this. The seed is the word of God. &gt;&gt; So anytime now even as we are sowing seed now that's we are sowing the word of God. That seed want to get to one more scripture. Zechariah 4:7. Amen. Zechariah 4:7. Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth a headstone with shoutings. Amen. He'll bring forth the headstones. Head stone with shoutings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the rapture starts with a shout. &gt;&gt; That's the coming of the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus does all three things as he's descending. Everybody say Jesus is the headstone. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's saying the headstone will come with shoutings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Crying grace, grace unto it. The Lord had blessings to the reading of his word. You may be seated. We can just go to Luke 8:10 there. Again, just want to make a a comment on this. It says, "And he said, unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God." In this time and season that we are living in in 2025, there are no mysteries of God that are not revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; All the mysteries of God have been revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seventh angel has already sounded. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, we are living in a very Amen. Uh &gt;&gt; an anointed hour. &gt;&gt; There's never been a time or a season where the entire mystery of God has been made known to a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, we are not still wondering and pondering about what this mystery is, what that mystery is. All the mysteries that were supposed to be revealed were revealed when brother Brandham sounded his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must know the time and the season that we are living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If a farmer doesn't know time and season, &gt;&gt; he will not be a successful farmer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know there are certain seasons that you can plant certain seeds? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then there are certain trees that you can't keep tilling the ground. &gt;&gt; How many of you till the your your mango tree every year? Fruit trees bear according to time and season. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go and take it up by the roots. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There are certain trees that you've just got to leave planted. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it will bear fruit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But there are certain crops which you must till. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must know the time and season. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the to everything there is a season. &gt;&gt; Yes. a purpose for everything under the sun. Now, if we don't know time and season, we can have wrong expectation. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; And having a wrong expectations, we'll be expecting wrong results. &gt;&gt; And be wandering around and around the message of the hour, never fulfilling what we were meant to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this can bring frustration. But not only frustration, we can miss our day and its message. &gt;&gt; We can be so close to it, but we can miss our day and its message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Remember we were backgrounding with Esther. She was in the kingdom wearing a royal crown, &gt;&gt; being called your majesty, your highness. &gt;&gt; She was so close to it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; But she was never in it. &gt;&gt; Why? was disconnected from the headstone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So in the times when our Lord Jesus was on earth, the scribes and the Pharisees were still trying to keep the season of Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the season had changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were trying to keep the season of Moses. They failed to see time and season had changed. Proof after proof, manifestation after manifestation, Jesus displayed before them. But they failed to see it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Their eyes were blinded. Why? Traditions of men. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm saying let us not be blinded in the message but traditions of men in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not 1965. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you read the opening book of Joshua, &gt;&gt; it is very clear and you can you are very sharp. You can read between the lines. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you put up Joshua chapter one there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; There's a very distinct statement that the Lord makes to Joshua. &gt;&gt; Go to the next one. Moses, my servant, is &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; First Exodus. &gt;&gt; We're in the third Exodus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses, my servant, is dead. &gt;&gt; What is he trying to tell him? &gt;&gt; Stop looking back. &gt;&gt; You are now called and chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's emphasizing there. Moses, my servant, is dead now. Therefore, you arise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as we keep you looking back and we speak about as if sometimes we speak to people and they ask us where is where is brother Brandon? &gt;&gt; We speak about him like he's so alive. &gt;&gt; But we are failing to see that he had a message &gt;&gt; and the proof of his message and the vindication of his message is that the life of Christ must be formed in us. &gt;&gt; If the life of Christ is not formed in us, we are wasting our time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He came with a message. &gt;&gt; He came to reveal all the mysteries of God so that you and I could reproduce the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We must be an army of Jesus. &gt;&gt; When people look at us, they must not be able to tell the difference between us and Jesus. &gt;&gt; The same works that was in Jesus must be seen in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we've got to get our expectation right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to get our faith right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So here they are porting they're porting the prophets and the psalms to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right? But when the when when the prophets and the psalms are speaking about the what the prophets and the psalms are speaking about are standing right before them. &gt;&gt; People are porting the ports. People are quoting about the bride, &gt;&gt; about what the bride will be. But the very manifestation of the bride is right before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is the deception? Satan will always keep you looking. &gt;&gt; Always looking. &gt;&gt; And fail to see what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, well taught church. Praise the Lord. Amen. So they refuse to accept it. And when we refuse to accept the day and hour we are living in now, we are crucifying it. &gt;&gt; They crucified Jesus. They didn't want to hear that he was the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; They still don't want to hear that you are the word made flesh today. &gt;&gt; They are saying, "No, we are still waiting for something more." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They took the word and they killed it and spirits don't die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sure. Let's go to the first quote there. The prophet is saying, "Amen." Praise the Lord. The prophet is saying, "The time and hour that we're living in, that we're living, if a person don't know which way to go, &gt;&gt; what to do, or how to turn, you're not walking by faith anymore." &gt;&gt; Now, this is the hour of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we if we ever want to walk in perfect faith, we've got to know the time and the hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, otherwise, you're not walking by faith anymore. You're just guessing. You're presuming &gt;&gt; what's happening. Oh, no. You know, God sent a prophet. We received his message, but we're not sure what's happening right now. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're kind of wondering what happened. &gt;&gt; Since Brandon fell asleep, everything is the same. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; What are they doing? They're presuming. guessing but we are walking with a definite authority. &gt;&gt; We are walking with a definite vindication. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has not left the church. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the guide. You know what has happened? People have kicked out the Holy Ghost and took theology of the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't see the Holy Ghost move anymore. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. People are not moved shaken by the Holy Ghost. People are not led by the Holy Ghost. But the Bible says that sons of God are led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; We should always keep the flame alive. Amen. Always keep the spirit alive in us. &gt;&gt; Don't be a dead cold church, but be a church where the spirit of God is moving to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what happens when you have a cold? &gt;&gt; After a while, it gets &gt;&gt; lukewarm. You've got to stoke it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need some stoking. Amen. I pray the Holy Ghost stoked some calls this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says you're not walking by faith anymore. You're just guessing. You're presuming. And to presume is to advance without official authority. &gt;&gt; Now, in our spiritual walk, we don't want to be advancing without spiritual authority. &gt;&gt; Without official authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the next one then. So, if we haven't got the real official authority to know what God said would take place in this hour, &gt;&gt; how are we ever going to face the hour? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we've got to face it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Knowing by faith in his word that the things that supposed to be happening now and the condition of the nations. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now watch. I know sometimes you hear preachers saying, "Don't worry about this. Don't worry about Russia. Don't worry about Rome. Don't worry about America." &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; Let's bring a balance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those things won't position us. It won't give us faith. But he's saying let's take everything. &gt;&gt; He's saying we've got to know what's supposed to be happening now. &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus also say watch the fig tree. &gt;&gt; Now you're getting message minister say don't worry about Israel. Don't worry about USA. How can I not worry about USA when it's Revelation 13? &gt;&gt; How can I not worry about Rome when it's Revelation 13? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we mustn't get carried away in our preaching. &gt;&gt; Yes. We've got to know our time and season, but God has placed it also in signs. &gt;&gt; He's saying we got to know what's supposed to be happening. the condition of the nations, the condition of the people, the condition of the church and so forth. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We've got to know that and then how to walk out to face it. If you don't know how to do that, well, we just call kind of appazantly just jump in hoping it'll be there, hoping this, hoping that &gt;&gt; and will it be? But God don't want us to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we can't just be hoping, oh, I hope I make the rapture. No, &gt;&gt; we are walking with such confidence that we are in the shout &gt;&gt; and because we are caught up in the shout, we will make the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We haven't missed the shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He wants us to know what he has said about this day and then meet it by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he said it would be that way. Then we know your truth then because you haven't got some person's word for it. You've got his word of what we must do. And we are hoping that our heavenly father will grant this to us this week. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we've got to know our time and our season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we can't walk in perfect faith. Amen. Did the prophet make that very clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, some of the things that help us is to watch the condition of nations, the conditions of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the point of what I'm trying to convey to you this morning is that we can't be living in the bride age with the full opening of the word married to the lamb. &gt;&gt; And expecting a lady message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't be living all the way in the headstone. Somebody tell me what the virtue in headstone is. &gt;&gt; Charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. The Bible says charity. The virtue in the headstone is charity. And you can't bring charity down to a legacy and condition. &gt;&gt; Legacy in virtue is brotherly kindness. And I tell you, even in our own lives, some people are operating more in brotherly kindness than in charity. &gt;&gt; People who claim to be in the message of the hour are trying to operate the virtue of brotherly kindness in the legacy and church age when we supposed to be operating the fullness of it, which is charity. &gt;&gt; Charity, you can decide what you want to do and can't do. Sorry, let me say that again. Brotherly kindness, you can decide what you want to do and what you can't do. &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness, you can decide if you want to be good to your brother. &gt;&gt; Charity is different. &gt;&gt; Charity is God's. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Charity is an eternal. &gt;&gt; It's whether you think that person is deserving or not. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be called into the message of the hour and be living below your privileges. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, we got mean people. &gt;&gt; We got mean people even in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Supposed to be liberated. &gt;&gt; Supposed to be delivered. &gt;&gt; Supposed to be expressing the love of Jesus. Supposed to be expressing charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't even give cup of cold water to one another. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't even show charitable things. There there's a reason why it's called charity and not a love in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can love somebody without doing good works. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why organizations are not called love organizations. They're called charitable organizations. &gt;&gt; It's because it's accompanied with good works. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Charity is different. Charity is love accompanied by works. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. If we get to God's only provided place of worship, I think it's the next quote. It says because you are in Jesus the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The part of the word that's manif being manifested today. This day's message. &gt;&gt; Now watch the prophet has a pyramid in the church. I want you to get this. &gt;&gt; Not Luther, &gt;&gt; not Wesley's, Pentecostals, but your Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the reflection that has to come up into this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. He says now he's showing you that you have to come up into this into the headstone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then he's saying you can't go back to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There you go. &gt;&gt; You can't go back to Leosia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't the Didn't Mama Eagle call you out of the barnard? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was that? The story. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that was calling you into the headstone? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I just want to nail this thing down. In fact, I want to take a sword and cut off a head right now. &gt;&gt; How many of you believed you're married to the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me see your hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe you are married to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Who is Jesus Christ? Somebody say the headstone. &gt;&gt; So how can you be married to the Lord Jesus Christ the headstone if he is not here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many of you got married on Zoom on Skype? The the minister says that these two parties present now &gt;&gt; may be joined together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must be physically present &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus &gt;&gt; to be married. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; So if he came to take you as a wife he is physically here. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord. Now we have so much message, so much quotes. I can I can just say to you because I know you believe it. We are not going to the wedding ceremony there. We are going to the married supper. &gt;&gt; So when I'm using terminologies as we are in the headstone, we are already married to the headstone Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it shouldn't be a foreign teaching to you. Yet it is a foreign teaching in the message of the hour &gt;&gt; because we are still trying to keep people in a legacy and church age with a lady and church age messenger but we have another messenger. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Be quiet. &gt;&gt; The latest CN had a church age messenger. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was a seventh church age messenger. &gt;&gt; You remember John was told to write all that he sees. Yes, &gt;&gt; you find that in Revelation chapter 1, I think it's verse 19, he's told to write. &gt;&gt; Then in chapter 2, he says, "Write to the Ephesians. &gt;&gt; Write to the Smyrnians. Write to the uh Amen. Titerians. Write to them." &gt;&gt; Seven church ages he's told to write. But then in Revelation 10, the same angel that told him to write tells him, "Don't write." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that is a hidden bright age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's only for the people Amen. that's been called up into the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's So, in other words, it's only for the people that have been pulled into the door &gt;&gt; of marriage. It's only to the people that have been married. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. That's right. So you can't go back to that. That's adding leaven to your holy bread. &gt;&gt; So why you want to bring? So remember when I'm saying this year, we're trying to pull Pentecostal blessings. &gt;&gt; Okay. Was Luther justification? &gt;&gt; Was Wesley sanctification? &gt;&gt; Was Pentecost Amen. Later this year restoration of the gifts? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I'm saying. We are trying to add that &gt;&gt; to what we have. What is he saying? You are adding leaven to your holy bread. &gt;&gt; Because man shall not live by every word that man shall live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God in its season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In its season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Today we might be just doing a foundation of what we are speaking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know that brother Brandham says that you must be in his time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It must be his season. Now, these are five must &gt;&gt; when you're trying to do God a service. &gt;&gt; Remember this. Now, you young people that's getting married, remember what the prophet of God taught you. You don't just take anyone and marry her. &gt;&gt; Just because you find a girl in the church doesn't mean she's a good girl. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What does he say? You must watch character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You go for character. &gt;&gt; Yes. Jesus didn't choose you because of your good looks. I'll have you know. &gt;&gt; Jesus chose you because of character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So character is very important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we must choose correctly or you can ruin your entire life. You choose the wrong man, you choose the wrong woman, you'll ruin your entire life. &gt;&gt; So these things must be entered into prayerfully, &gt;&gt; advisedly. Now these are the some of you don't even pay attention to the marriage vows. This must be entered into prayerfully. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Advisedly. Who did you advise about who you want to get married to? Amen. So, those of you that haven't chosen yet, choose wisely. &gt;&gt; And who are you in consultation with to speak about this choice? This is not an easy choice. &gt;&gt; It must be done prayerfully. &gt;&gt; This is not about flirting. I'm talking to this girl. I'm talking to this guy. No. You are going to be living together. You're going to be having a family together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to be raising children together. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible says, "How can two walk together unless they be agreed?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I also want you to know, and I'll say it now for our young people, we don't believe in casual dating. &gt;&gt; That's right. We do not believe in casual dating in young people going out and just spending time together. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't see how close you can get to a person. You must leave room for the angel of the Lord between you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I know some of you are saying, "Brother, you said we in 2025. You're preaching like you're 1965. &gt;&gt; The word of God is not changing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do things respectfully. Do things out of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you start right, you'll end right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't want to do things where you corrupt yourself even before you enter the vows. Some people come into the marriage uh ceremony so defiled. so defiled. Amen. They and and and I do hope that young people know that if you defile your life, you have to confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to confess it to one another, &gt;&gt; then confess it to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's a clause in that marriage vow &gt;&gt; that if a woman doesn't disclose to her husband &gt;&gt; that she has been unfaithful and she slept around with other men, &gt;&gt; if he finds out years later, this is the only time Jesus said, except for the sake of fornication, &gt;&gt; he can put her away. &gt;&gt; You can be married 10 years, 20 years, if by then you tell your husband and he doesn't forgive you, according to the Bible, he can put you away. So these things must be disclosed upfront. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And ask yourself, what are you looking for? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The prophet says you can't get all things. &gt;&gt; He says sometimes you'll get a real pretty girl &gt;&gt; or real handsome guy, right? And he says other times, amen, maybe they financially well off or they got good character but they don't look so well. He says, "But what are you really looking for?" &gt;&gt; He says, "Are you looking for somebody to raise your children, to be a mother to your children, or are you looking for somebody who will just put them in any old crash and just jump to any old job?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And not be a mother to your children and not be a wife to you. &gt;&gt; Somebody pull me out of this. Trying to get back. I'm trying to get back slowly, brother Sunny. But somebody pull me out of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the choice we make for marriage, I say don't play with it. &gt;&gt; If you get the wrong job, you can leave the job. You don't like the job, you can leave the job. But the marriage is until death do us part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So choose wisely. Amen. So the prophet is saying if you go to the next you must be in his time in his season. You got that now must be time season. It must be according to the word that's been spoken. I don't care how well you say this ought to be or that ought to be. It's got to be according to his word, according to his time and season. It must be given according to the person he has chosen to do it. &gt;&gt; Now maybe somebody's asking this question that the prophet is saying next. What difference does it make what age you are in? Oh, what are you doing about the hour you're living in? What are you doing for Jesus at this time? He says, "Oh, I want to see him. I want to see the hour." I look and see all these old bodies transformed. See them changed in a moment in a twinkle. If that isn't so, then we're most foolish people. We are just eating, drinking, merry, for tomorrow you die. See, you're just like an animal. You die and you go to dirt and that's all. But there's a mortal immortal soul in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We done heard from heaven. We done seen it proven. &gt;&gt; Right. I'm just trying to lay this as a background before we continue. He says you've got to follow the season, the time, and what season you're in. What time make that vindicated to see that is exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, where where has God called us to now in 2025? Are we just in a state of limbo wondering what's happening? Or are we walking so closely with the spirit? Are we being led by the spirit that we know exactly the time and season that we are living in? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know where the prophet left the earth. &gt;&gt; We know the progression that God has been dealing with the bride. &gt;&gt; And we know where we are right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there anything lacking in our spiritual growth? &gt;&gt; Are we tracing our spiritual growth or are we just living day by day, month by month, Amen. without tracking our spiritual growth? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, what are we called to be in this time and season? What is the expectation of us? Amen. That's what I'm trying to ask you. What is our what are we called to be? What is our time and season? Amen. How many if you get what I'm trying to say? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if we are living with the wrong expectation, wrong time and season, we're going to be living, Amen. beneath our privileges. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's see what the prophet says in the next one there. He says the bride is to be the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then she's got to be of Christ, part of the bridegroom. She's got to be the word. The word not for his day. the word of this day that he promised would be this day that he sent his word for to mold his bride and maker. &gt;&gt; So what is he doing? He's sending the word. Now this is remember it's important to understand this. That's why he sent the prophet. He sent the prophet with the word to mold her and make her. Amen. Let's read properly now. Hope we see it. Don't get some idea of your own now. Don't take somebody else's idea. Take the vindicated word here, the Bible. God has promised in his word how he would choose his bride in this last day. Did you know that? Amen. &gt;&gt; That by his original plan of choosing Christ, of choosing the times, choosing the seasons, he can't miss it on his bride because she's part of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? When he didn't choose Christ by a denomination, did Christ come to a denomination? No. They rejected him. Well, that's what the denomination done. Then when he chooses the bride, can he come any other way? &gt;&gt; So what is he trying to say? He's not choosing the bride by some denomination. He's choosing it by the word. That's what he's trying to say here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's very important that last part there. How did he identify him when he come? By a man with the spirit of Elijah on him. &gt;&gt; Come out of the wilderness. How will he identify his bride? &gt;&gt; He says he promised Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; The same thing. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, if we're living where we are saying we're supposed to be living, &gt;&gt; all the way where the life of Christ is supposed to be on display. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the way in the headstone, &gt;&gt; then headstone conditions are different from Lethian conditions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you would know that the prophet says that on that seventh step in the pyramid inside the pyramid there was a little ledge there where there had to be a messenger to lead you into the king's chamber. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's where we have been with the prophet and his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the same way a tech led her to a point where she now needed to go into the king's chamber. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's a difference in ministries before you get into the king's chamber and after you get into the king's chamber. &gt;&gt; Before you get into the king's chamber, if we are taking the story of Esther, &gt;&gt; Amon is running a mock. &gt;&gt; Ammon is ruling the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Ammon has the king signant. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a devil. Now, in your life, &gt;&gt; the devil can run a mock. &gt;&gt; He's plotting against Modiah. He's talking against the cloud. &gt;&gt; He's talking against his prophet. &gt;&gt; He's saying all kinds of things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Why? She's not in the presence of the king yet. [Music] &gt;&gt; And she can do nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But there's a difference after she gets into the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; Now, Amon is under her control. &gt;&gt; What she says about Aan must happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happens? Now pay attention because this is typing the seals. After she gets into the presence of King Asus, Ammon's plan is uncovered. &gt;&gt; What is that? The opening of the seven seals, showing the rider and his ride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uncovering Satan's scheme of how he is riding to conquer and defeat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. So once she gets into the king's chamber now she's able to expose. &gt;&gt; The seals are opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The writer is exposed. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she's able to control the situation and put him to death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what about your demons? &gt;&gt; What about your Amen. situations? &gt;&gt; Are you able to control it? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Or are you running all the time? Now remember the first the first messenger to her was Agi. He gave her gifts and with just gifts she had come through justification, sanctification, restoration of the gifts. With just gifts, she couldn't save her people. &gt;&gt; Yes. But &gt;&gt; she had to get to the giver of the gifts. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I want to I want to go not to the next one to the following one. It says and today he's standing. Amen. So what am I saying? You need to get into the presence of the king. Pay attention. And today he's standing amongst us &gt;&gt; in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming into his church, making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same. Making himself known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when I read that they are the same, &gt;&gt; I want to be the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When I'm saying when the property is saying will be the same, which means they have the same potentials. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's just that we can't unlock it because we disbelieve that about ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says the Holy Spirit is coming more and more into the church. &gt;&gt; You see the here's the problem right now, brother Joshua. People hate the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; People don't want the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; People don't want the Holy Ghost. People feel the Holy Ghost is too restricting. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost doesn't want me to do this. &gt;&gt; If I get the Holy Ghost, I can't watch Netflix. &gt;&gt; If I get the Holy Ghost, I can't watch shows. If I get the Holy Ghost, I can't watch movies. If I get the Holy Ghost, I can't mess around. &gt;&gt; Ah, you see it's quiet. &gt;&gt; People don't like the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; People like the idea about the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; but they don't want the Holy Ghost. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right now, we should be saying amen &gt;&gt; to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I'm not preaching to your feelings. Your feelings may be getting hurt right now. I am not preaching to your feelings. I'm preaching to the spirit man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to strengthen the spirit man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if your flesh is getting hurt, spirit man, rise up and say, "You deserve it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Flesh, you deserve it." Because the Holy Spirit was meant to tabernacle me. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to say this again. If the bride and groom will be the same, what is our expectation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How come Jesus could go to a blind man and heal the blind man? &gt;&gt; Now same means same. &gt;&gt; If your expectation is lower, that's your problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor that's your endowment. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Says same. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I can prove it by scripture. If you make me a liar, I can prove it by scripture. Jesus said, "Greater works than these shall you do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we are struggling to find the greater works. You know why? There's no surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were preaching on unlocking the king's favor. &gt;&gt; How did she unlock the king's favor? We missed that important part. She had to go through consecration. She had to go through fasting. She had to go through prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to get into the king's chamber anyhow &gt;&gt; with our mini skirts, &gt;&gt; with our pants, &gt;&gt; with our bob hair, with our makeup, &gt;&gt; with our earring, &gt;&gt; without skinny jeans. &gt;&gt; Young men wearing skinny jeans. You know that's a homosexual thing. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; you like skinny jeans. &gt;&gt; The homosexuals want to see your legs. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; that's why Brother Sunny, unless you went to a comedy show, &gt;&gt; go to Gateway or somewhere, &gt;&gt; you'll see burly men, &gt;&gt; masculine men walking with pink shorts. &gt;&gt; They made it style. &gt;&gt; It's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; Why homosexual men are designers? How many of you know? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. Don't act like you don't know this. &gt;&gt; The designers in the fashion world are homosexuals. Yeah, &gt;&gt; true. &gt;&gt; So men were wearing khaki pants &gt;&gt; and baggy pants. Chinos they were wearing. &gt;&gt; What chinos? &gt;&gt; I want to see their legs. &gt;&gt; So they made this. What did I said? &gt;&gt; Skinnies. &gt;&gt; Skinnies. &gt;&gt; They made these skinnies. Now you walking with these skinnies. Firstly, you can't even put your leg in that thing. &gt;&gt; It's so tight you can't walk. &gt;&gt; Why you don't wear your pants loose? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Wear your pants loose. &gt;&gt; We are not interested in your leg. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your leg is for you to walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If we put our bodily organs in the right place and what the purpose of it, your leg is for you to walk. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither are we interested to see the form and shape of woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we come into the house of the Lord, we ought to dress appropriately. &gt;&gt; Cover yourself. Cover your body. Amen. So I am saying the bride and the groom will be the same. making himself known. You see, we are still believing that the head is disconnected from us. Yet, we saying we're married. &gt;&gt; I'm going to labor on this point a bit. &gt;&gt; Because if the head is here, if the headship is here, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; then this supposed to be the super church, &gt;&gt; the super race, &gt;&gt; the invincible army. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is supposed to be the church right now. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is supposed to be the church where the sick are healed. &gt;&gt; The dead are raised. Amen. The blind eyes open. &gt;&gt; The deaf ears hear &gt;&gt; the gospel is preached. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got the full restoration of the word, but we're walking around like theologians or professors. &gt;&gt; Everywhere we go, we've got our gown. We got graduation gown. We never take the graduation gown off. Amen. &gt;&gt; We let the sick lay. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am saying let's prove Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's take him out of history. &gt;&gt; Let's take him. Amen. Let's kick the filth out of our houses. Amen. Looks like that's what we need to start doing. Let's start to kick the filthy music out of our houses. Let's start to kick the pop songs of our houses. Let's start to kick the rock songs out of our houses and put godly music back in our houses. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a problem why the bride and groom is not the same. &gt;&gt; There is a definite problem. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And if you go to any doctor, he's going to diagnose the problem, but you have come to Dr. Jesus this morning and he's diagnosing the problem. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "You want my name, but you don't want me." &gt;&gt; Esther, you are walking in the book of Esther chapter 4 without getting into the king's chamber. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got the name, you married, you got the crown, you got royal accommodation, you got amen, royal food, but no connection. &gt;&gt; I'm disconnected. The king told me if I come into his presence, I'll be killed. &gt;&gt; So, some people believe that the only time they'll be united with Jesus is when he's coming in the clouds of glory. &gt;&gt; And you'll be changed and caught up to meet him. Jesus is not coming for any appetite fairy tale of yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus makes preparation. Do you know what the shout is? It's an eastern tradition. &gt;&gt; It's an eastern marriage thing. When the bridegroom is coming with his friends, he shouts. He makes a loud noise because he wants to alert everybody that he's here for his queen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he descends with a shout. What is the shout? A message going forth together living saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says it's the living bread of life. &gt;&gt; Now if we are connected to the headstone, why are we so dead? &gt;&gt; Why aren't we living in pistols of all men? Why don't we carry the fire of God in our souls? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not excited about anything. We are not excited about church. We are not excited about the religion. We are not excited about the message of the hour. We come in dead. We come in cold, we come in formal, and we go out the same. Amen. We come in miserable and we go out miserable. The message was not sent as a bondage, but the message was sent as freedom. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to be free in the message of the hour. We've got to be rejoicing and present the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm tired of seeing people looking so dull and gloomy, acting like the message is a chain. The message is not a chain. The message is a liberating force. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time we proudly proclaim. Amen. People in the message of the hour, whether it's two or three of us. Amen. Young people, whether it's just a few of us, Amen. We got to say, I'm so proud to be identified with the message of the hour. Amen. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd rather be counted for Jesus now while it's shun upon. Amen. While they walk, Amen. I choose to stand for Jesus. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; It was so gloomy. Amen. It was so dull. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; The bride and the groom will be the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When in heaven, I don't want it. Hey, &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, are we the sons of God? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh hallelujah. He says one day the one that you feel in your heart sees identification will become personalized before you. &gt;&gt; You're you're united with the word by the word and the word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is God. At that day now here he brings our scripture. At that day which is this day you'll know that I'm in the father the father in me. I in you. You in me. That's marriage right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We keep saying these things for repetition. Amen. &gt;&gt; Until we get it. &gt;&gt; Now I want to get to the next one, but I want to get to paragraph 177 then. Now if we are saying we are in the headstone age, &gt;&gt; then it's got to have end time conditions. He says the word the evening message must carry evening results. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know what's the expectation up in the headstone? perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The expectation up here in the headstone. You say, "Brother, are we in the headstone?" Paul writes it another way in Ephesians chapter one. He says, "You are called into heavenly places." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The word, the evening message must carry evening results. &gt;&gt; The evening message must sew evening seed or I told you, you got to recognize time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't be sewing morning time seeds in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The evening message must sew evening seed, not morning seed. Evening seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray the Holy Spirit is trying to awaken us. &gt;&gt; We are trying to sow for later and age. Amen. We are trying to sew for later and condition. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am not in Leosia. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if you're in Leosia, &gt;&gt; if you're in Leosia, then let me call you out. Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of our sins. &gt;&gt; If you're in Lucia, then I must come week after week and call you. Come out of her, my people. Be not partakers of our sin. But the fact that you are sitting here this morning shows that you have come out of latest fear. You have responded to the call of the shout. Amen. And you have caught up into heavenly places. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are called into the headstone age, but Satan doesn't want you to recognize where you are, that you are seated now in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you know the prophet of God teaches us? Everything must be believed by faith. &gt;&gt; Even this what I'm telling you now that you are caught up in the headstone must be believed by faith. Even that quote there about you being exactly the same as Jesus must be believed by faith. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, nothing will happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For example, if I know the word says these signs shall follow them that believe. If I lay hands upon the sick, they shall recover as long as I don't believe that and don't lay my hands and nothing will happen. &gt;&gt; Nothing will happen. &gt;&gt; But here, brother Josh comes and he believes the scripture. &gt;&gt; And he says, I'm going to lay hands on the sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And take the promise of the word and they shall recover. Because his expectation, he believes the word, this brother shall recover. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am saying take what I'm saying to you now and start to live in it. &gt;&gt; Start to ask the Lord, Lord, if I'm living in a headstone age, if this is the age of perfection, if this is the age where sons are to be a manifestation, I want to see it manifested in my life. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And then when God presents a situation to you, don't run away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Josh was telling you on Wednesday &gt;&gt; that he needed a certain amount of money. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure. &gt;&gt; Cash. &gt;&gt; He wanted a certain amount of money cash. I'm just trying to give you this example. Amen. He needed cash. Now, he prayed the prayer in the morning. The opportunity arose during the day. Somebody said, "I've got a case. I need you to represent me in court." &gt;&gt; What in case he said, "I'm too busy. It's a Friday." If he said he's too busy, &gt;&gt; it's a Friday. &gt;&gt; I want to go home early and look at Sister Vanessa's eyes. &gt;&gt; What would have happened? &gt;&gt; The prayer that he prayed, &gt;&gt; God was already providing the answer. &gt;&gt; But who could have stopped it? &gt;&gt; You don't believe me? Go to Genesis chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's 11:23. &gt;&gt; Somebody claim Mark 11:23 there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we go to Genesis chapter 2, I just want to show you something that God can have everything set for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can have everything in place. &gt;&gt; He can have seeds in the ground. You can have your life set in order, &gt;&gt; but you can't be there like a &gt;&gt; inactive participant. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Let's get to Genesis chapter 2 here. And I just want to show you something. Let's go to verse 5. Okay. Let's read from verse four. Let's see God setting everything up for us. How many of you believe God knows the end from the beginning? &gt;&gt; Amen. We know. I know the thoughts and plans for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every blessing that God has for you is already being given to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all locked up in the word. &gt;&gt; Right? You are already blessed. &gt;&gt; You are already raptured. &gt;&gt; You are already perfected. &gt;&gt; Right? Well, watch this now. These are the generations of the heavens and earth when they were created in the day that the Lord had made the heavens and earth. Earth and heavens, right? Every plant of the field before it was in the earth, every herb of the field before it grew. Now, how does it happen? He's saying God got plants before it was in the earth. &gt;&gt; He's got herbs in the field before it grew. &gt;&gt; God is seeing what he wants. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're a farmer, you must already start to see your crop. &gt;&gt; If you're trusting the Lord for a situation, already believe you have received it. &gt;&gt; Abraham spoke like God. He believed those. He called those things which were not as though they are. &gt;&gt; What did John Ryan do? He was blind as a bat, &gt;&gt; but he kept saying, "Praise God, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is saying before the plant of the field was in the earth and every field and every herb of the field before it grew. Now here's the reason why. &gt;&gt; For the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There must be your part. &gt;&gt; The seeds are laying there. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; even the first part could have been open. God could have caused the rain to come on the earth. &gt;&gt; But what is required in the law &gt;&gt; somebody to tell &gt;&gt; that's where we are lazy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We locked up in our room. Lord, I need a promotion. I need a better job. How about you update your CV? &gt;&gt; Does anybody know you're looking for a job? No. Lord, I'm leaving my windows open. Every day I'm singing the windows of heaven are open. &gt;&gt; What are you doing to till your soil? &gt;&gt; Hey, you brothers that got business, did you all take your products and leave it in the shop and go home? That thing is going to sell itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your product sell itself. You've got to till. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to work. &gt;&gt; You've got to labor. &gt;&gt; Now, when you are faithful in that, hold God to his promise. &gt;&gt; We've got to know how to operate the word. Hold God to his promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know how the Lord operates. He comes and he holds you accountable for what he's given you. &gt;&gt; You know that in Matthew 25, &gt;&gt; he comes here, he holds you accountable. What have you done with what I have given you? &gt;&gt; You can be quicker. You are now taken accountable with what he has given you. &gt;&gt; You can go to the Lord in prayer and say, "Lord, I have managed what you have given me faithfully. What you have given me, I have managed it faithfully. According to me, I have taken it to the to the borders of this. I can't stretch this any further. Why don't you multiply it for me?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, you trusted me with this and I managed it well. You say not so. You say not so. &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles chapter 4. &gt;&gt; You telling me you can't petition God to enlarge your borders. Amen. Is it 1 Chronicles 4? I think it's 10 somewhere there. Jabz &gt;&gt; called on the God of Israel saying now let me background this the land was marked out &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; by Joshua &gt;&gt; territory was given by the elders &gt;&gt; how many of you agree &gt;&gt; they were allocated a certain portion of land &gt;&gt; but this man Jabz had a vision so big &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; that the land wasn't able to contain aining &gt;&gt; what they gave him was not suitable. &gt;&gt; What they gave him was not enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So instead of consulting the elders and saying hey you gave me a small portion of land but my vision is bigger he consults a higher power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God Jabas called on the God of Israel saying oh that thou would bless me indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So is anything wrong to ask God to bless you? &gt;&gt; If you don't ask him to bless you that's your enda. Yes. &gt;&gt; All that thou wouldest bless me indeed and enlarge my coast. &gt;&gt; That means enlarge my border. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enlarge my portion and that thine hand might be with me and thou would escape me from evil that it may not grieve me. And look at what God does. And God granted him that which he requested. &gt;&gt; Amen. We sitting miserable but we're not speaking. &gt;&gt; We come now to the end of the message. The prophet is speaking. The spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we are speaking every other word. &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the original seed &gt;&gt; we are speaking. Nothing good ever happens to me. &gt;&gt; Nothing ever good comes to me. Your words are so powerful and you actually believe it. So nothing good ever happens to you. &gt;&gt; I've been working for this company for 20 years. They have never given me an increase. &gt;&gt; Instead of saying, "Lord, I thank you. I've been working faithfully for 20 years for this company. I pray Lord that you make me find favor in the eyes of the boss. May they recognize my potential and I thank you for the increase that you have already given me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to speak what you want. &gt;&gt; That's how you speak like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman who had a drunk husband, &gt;&gt; she went around, hey, this drunkard, this drunk, she didn't go there doing that. You tell everyone your husband is a drunkard. Then your husband is a drunkard according to your confession. But what in case you change your confession? I thank you Lord. My husband is delivered of this addiction. &gt;&gt; I thank you Lord. He's the most loving man. I thank you Lord that he has changed his ways. I thank you for the blood. And I thank you Lord that the next time he drinks, it'll be the blood of Jesus that is washing him and cleansing him. &gt;&gt; And he'll never desire it no more. The woman that had an abusive husband and was taking food and throwing it against the wall, she maintained her testimony. &gt;&gt; She maintained her confession. &gt;&gt; She said, "Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free?" &gt;&gt; No. There's a cross for you and there's a cross for me. &gt;&gt; That confession made a made those people see the Christian character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They came repenting. They gave their hearts to the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't think, don't be fooled by you phoning everybody now, telling your telling everyone what a horrible person your wife is and what an a horrible person your husband is is going to change the situation. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, when his wife when he came home and the wife was grumbling about him not hitting Joseph and she was upset with him, what she went did He took an apron &gt;&gt; and he started to &gt;&gt; wash the dishes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He started to wash the dishes. You know, not all of you have to go wash dishes, but I'm saying you got to know your wife. Sometimes she likes chomp. You got to go buy the chomp. Amen. Sometimes she likes flowers. You got to go buy the flowers. So, you got to know your wife. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you can change the situation. &gt;&gt; We want to control atmospheres. We want to control demon powers. We want to control every other situation. You can't control your tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's close now. Amen. So we were reading the quote the word the evening message must carry evening results. So I'm saying the headstone must carry headstone results. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The evening message must sow evening seed. Not morning seed, evening seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you know why the prophet is saying this? Let's see how good we are. because he said this messenger will sow for two rains. You'll sew the former rain. So the former rain is for the morning seed and the latter rain is for the &gt;&gt; evening seed. So he says the evening messenger must sow evening seed, not morning seed, evening seed. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray you are not bored by the message that God has sent us. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're trying to learn how to operate in our position out of the headstone. &gt;&gt; The midday scene, it seeds back there was denomination. It died, perished. But evening time message will show evening time light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will show evening time results. The evening time message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Jesus time midday message showed midday results. The beginning message showed the beginning results. Made creation. He made his son in his own image in the midday. In the evening time, he makes a bride for it. What? By his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How did he form the earth? How did he speak it into existence? By his word. What was his son? The word. And the word was made flesh. How will he take his bride? By the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In 178 there he says the evening time he promised he would reveal open the seven seals show what them churches has missed back there. Revelation 10, Malachi 4, Luke 17:30. He said he would do it. Now let's not mix it up. Let's keep it right like that. &gt;&gt; Want to close with this because I want to get use this for the launching pad for the next one. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's talking about the pyramid going up to the king's chamber. &gt;&gt; And just before you hit the seventh wall, there's a little introduction plank there where a messenger comes out to bring you to the king. &gt;&gt; Right? He's saying the same way John the Baptist introduced Jesus, but the headstone was rejected. Now, they didn't know the stone of scone or whatever it is. They didn't know where it's at because it's a rejected stone. But that's the stone that caps the whole thing that makes it the pyramid through the complete seven church ages. Add grace. Add this. Amen. The last one is Christ. Add this to your charity. Add grace. And something else till it gets up to Christ in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I am the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, we've been through the door now. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's saying we've got to leave. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and come up now to that seventh step &gt;&gt; where you're going to enter the headstone age where you're united with Christ &gt;&gt; married to Christ and there Christ is the door and you know what you need the key and we spoke about revelation being the key he says we've got to be magnifi magnetized to the headstone &gt;&gt; oh yes &gt;&gt; you see why I'm saying brother Brandham is talking about metal pieces &gt;&gt; and he says there's got to be this great magnet that comes across the factory that picks up these metal pieces. &gt;&gt; Now, we've had the message of the hour, the shout &gt;&gt; that has come like a great magnet &gt;&gt; and pulled us out of Leosia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says we've got to be magnifi magnetized to that headstone. That headstone is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And every one of us has got that magnetism of the Holy Spirit. When the stone strikes the image, the church will flee to it back into glory. She will be taken up at the rapture of the saints when she goes forth in that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh skip the next one there. I want to get to paragraph. It says 261. We'll read this and then we'll close. Amen. He says, "Notice, you are a son of God in the house of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a part of God's economy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does part of God's economy means? &gt;&gt; Being part of God's economy means &gt;&gt; it takes care of your finances. &gt;&gt; It takes care of your protection. &gt;&gt; It takes care of your daily needs. &gt;&gt; Amen.

He also Amen. drops the charges. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the enemy charges you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But Romans 8:1 says he dropped the charges. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; If there's no condemnation, which means the case is dismissed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to get to let's get to 262. He says the Lutheran under justification. This is very important now. We're going to close. The feet raised it like that. Wesley under sanctification, the Pentecostal under the arms, the works and deeds and so forth. Right? Now remember Pentecostals later &gt;&gt; don't confuse it now. &gt;&gt; Right? Had to be legalist. Now he says, listen to this everyone. Read this. But now we come to the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are we? &gt;&gt; But now we come to the head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The capstone. Grace. Grace. The capstone cry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So is everybody clear that the prophet is separating us from the lenos? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. He's saying now we come to the capstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grace. Grace. The headstone crying what? Grace. Grace. Pass from death and creed into a living word of the living God. God's only provided plan for his age. &gt;&gt; Hey, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Time and season. If you are not in the headstone, you're not in God's provided place of worship. &gt;&gt; It is saying God's only provided place. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's read this again, church. &gt;&gt; He says we we're into a living word. Now, remember, he says the shout is a living bread of life. &gt;&gt; That's the living word. &gt;&gt; So, we are in the shout of the living God. God's only provided plan for his age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's only provided plan for his age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; What we are trying to do is take the opening of the word, the message of the hour, and trying to live in latest year with it. &gt;&gt; And later is cold. &gt;&gt; Latest year is lukewarm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're wondering why the message is not working in latest year. &gt;&gt; It's wretched. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it's poor. &gt;&gt; The outside of it, listen, the outside of it, they rich. They increase with goods. They have need of nothing. &gt;&gt; But you're trying to live inside the latest year and age with the message of the hour. You're miserable, &gt;&gt; cold, &gt;&gt; wretched, &gt;&gt; blind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Naked. &gt;&gt; You don't know it. &gt;&gt; You are not called to take a headstone message and live in Lady C. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Let's read this. God's only provided plan for his age. I want you all to say this because this is the crux of the message. The only provided plan for this age &gt;&gt; is for me &gt;&gt; is for me &gt;&gt; to be in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive. and seated now in heavenly places. Now watch he's saying in present tense &gt;&gt; already alive &gt;&gt; and subject to every promise in the word then what does he do? You being a part of God's gene, a part of the word, other men a part of God's word, seated together like what's happening here this morning. &gt;&gt; Manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven amongst you. &gt;&gt; No leaven amongst you. Just the word seated in heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus. No leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you see the super church? &gt;&gt; But we want to dysfellowship one another. &gt;&gt; The super church is relying on us being united. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because us being united is bringing the fullness of the Godhead amongst us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No leaven among you. That brings the entire fullness of the Godhead among you. Oh, I I want to say this because we need to stop here. Somebody's not paying attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know what that means? &gt;&gt; If you saw Jesus, what would that mean to you right now? &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "The fullness of the God, it was locked up in Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he saying here? &gt;&gt; When we are seated together in heavenly places, &gt;&gt; no leaven amongst us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No differences. Amen. &gt;&gt; It brings what? &gt;&gt; It brings the fullness. Oh, he actually uses another word. The entire fullness &gt;&gt; of the godhead bodily among you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's the key why we can't see the super church super race. &gt;&gt; The moment somebody leaves this church, ha, we got rid of them. Now we think they are separate raptures. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; And separate heavens. &gt;&gt; No. If you want to see the fullness of the godhead in the church, get rid of petty differences. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgive &gt;&gt; and forget. Say, "Brother, you are my brother." &gt;&gt; You know, I I I'm starting to dislike it when people talk about other message ministers. profusely. Even if there's portions of what they are saying is incorrect, I would rather be on their side, united with my brother because they believe the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Than to be associated with some denominational chicken preacher. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I would rather be associated with a message pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's standing for present day truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Present day word. &gt;&gt; Than to be trying to fight one another. &gt;&gt; You know what we're trying to do? &gt;&gt; We got a forefront battle here. One fighting this side, one fighting that side. Now we we leading the battle here and we're shooting this pastor. &gt;&gt; Don't do that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says if somebody got the ball, don't see try and take the ball away. see how you can support him. &gt;&gt; Hey, I I don't think people are seeing this. &gt;&gt; What does this mean to bring the entire fullness of the God in amongst us? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; If I told you Genesis 1, that God is going to be among you. Would that make any difference to you? The one that created heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; The ones that spoke and said, "Let there be." He's saying that God is going to be among you. [Music] He couldn't do it in Luther's age. &gt;&gt; He couldn't bring the fullness. Now, you know why the headstone was rejected? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The headstone is cut a certain way. It can't fit on Luther's foundation there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't make an exact fit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't fit on Wesley's foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't fit on the Pentecostal foundation. &gt;&gt; Yes. So it had to wait. That's why they rejected the stone. If I gave you something, you don't know what to do with it. What you going to do? You'll leave it one side. &gt;&gt; That's what they did with it. &gt;&gt; That's why the Pentecostals rejected Brother Brandham's message. They didn't know what to do with it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't for them. &gt;&gt; We're going to close now. Couldn't do it in Luther's age. Couldn't do it in Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age. But in the day when the son of man will be manifested, revealed, brought back, the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The entire deity. Am I supposed to expect something? Uh now here's where we find the balance again because people are saying we got the opening of the word we don't need other things we don't need manifestation we don't need healings we don't need this we got the opening of the word let's bring the balance &gt;&gt; if the entire deity is here he says entire deity showing the same visible signs &gt;&gt; manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in the form of a prophet God. &gt;&gt; Glory promised by Malachi 4, promised by the rest of the scripture where you worship at the house of God seated in present tense. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to close with this because I don't think we understand what we what we have. There's 258. I know some of you just want to close the service and go. &gt;&gt; It's fine. We're laboring here now. &gt;&gt; Somebody must till the soil. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says in our bodies with speaking with new tongues prophesying. Oh, you see this is what what message is this? &gt;&gt; 65 1965 the Easter seals. Why I'm telling you this? I'm your pastor. I need to tell you stuff. &gt;&gt; People tell you that we're in the opening of the word now. We don't need certain things. Here is the prophet of God, the prophet of the age. After the opening of the word, &gt;&gt; he's saying, "And now in our bodies with speaking with new tongues, with prophesying and foreseeing, laying hands on the sick, and they recover the world, dead, and all the things of the world, we've passed from death unto life, and now hold the &gt;&gt; Lord." &gt;&gt; Now, if you are called to live in the headstone, hear what he says. There ain't enough devils in hell to keep us from doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing what he's saying? &gt;&gt; There's no amount of demons in hell to stop you from prophesying &gt;&gt; to stop you from laying hands on the sick &gt;&gt; to stop you. Amen. From fulfilling every promise of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying there ain't enough devils in hell to keep us from doing it. We were forained of God for this hour. So let them bring 200 million demons on the earth. He says even they are not enough to stop us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; In the headstone is atomic warfare. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We hold all power in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't Don't bow down for these little demon powers, sicknesses, and diseases. They try to cast on your life and ask you all kinds of stupid questions when you go to the doctor. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; For every other thing they tell you, you are an individual. You are individually accountable. When you come to sickness, your father had this. &gt;&gt; What do you want to know about my father? Even if my father had it, it stops with me. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I said it. &gt;&gt; The doctor might tell, listen to me, the doctor might tell you it's hereditary. The doctor might tell you it's genetic. The doctor might tell you that this thing will be passed down through generations. You tell him doctor I stand here today &gt;&gt; and I am stopping it. He says what gives you the authority to stop it? My God gives me the authority to stop it right now. &gt;&gt; Come on now. He says they'll stop sicknesses. They'll stop cancer. &gt;&gt; Who's going to do it? &gt;&gt; You're going to die and wait for somebody else to do it. &gt;&gt; You're alive now. Do something about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If we are not the people called to manifest sons and daughters of God on the earth right now, then we all rather die and go to the grave and let God raise up another generation that's got the courage to take the sword of the spirit to take the word of God and be able to operate the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many of you got sickness in your body right now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me see your hands. Anyone's got sickness in their body right now? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. How about we take God at his word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We are standing in the presence of sons and daughters of God who carry the portion of deity right here right now. We'll stop sickness right now. We'll stop cancer right now. We'll stop all manner of sicknesses right now. &gt;&gt; If thou can believe then all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, I'm not trying to walk you up. I'm telling you Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says there ain't enough devils. The word of God manifests itself. Oh, please somebody hear this. Please read this. &gt;&gt; The word was for we were forained of God for this hour. &gt;&gt; Now, what did we start out with? We got to know our time and season. &gt;&gt; We got to know our hour. Yo, I'm closing now. We were forained of God for this hour. &gt;&gt; If you are breathing, God got you here for a reason. &gt;&gt; Do something about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God manifest itself right through &gt;&gt; and we live in the presence of God by the promise by the word promise of God. Ain't no devil in hell can keep me from raising. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No demon in hell can stop you from raising up to your potential. &gt;&gt; You were called for this hour. &gt;&gt; How about we reshot the devil now and say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say amen. Somebody who never said amen before, say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shut the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not expecting you to say amen. Say amen to the word of God. Say, I believe the word of God. I am called for this hour. I am called for this time and season. God didn't choose Luther for this time. God didn't choose Wesley for this time. God didn't choose William Brandon for this time. But God chose you and I to be standing here in 2025. Glory to God. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's do something about it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen.

He said we have opportunities that Paul never dreamed about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody give God praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have opportunities &gt;&gt; that Paul never dreamed about. &gt;&gt; I want you to know brother Brandon would have wished he had lived in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this time and in this season now in 2025.
