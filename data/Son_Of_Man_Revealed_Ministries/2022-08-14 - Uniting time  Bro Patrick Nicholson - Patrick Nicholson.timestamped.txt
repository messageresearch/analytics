[16:12] announcement just because
[16:14] some believers have approached me
[16:15] already but nobody's obligated to do it
[16:18] so
[16:19] because pastor ronnie had been the
[16:20] church pastor of the church for 40 years
[16:23] some of the believers have already asked
[16:24] me if they can contribute towards
[16:27] the memorial
[16:28] amen towards the meals and whatever else
[16:30] is going to be prepared so we also don't
[16:32] want to let you miss that opportunity if
[16:34] you want to do that amen so you can
[16:36] contribute towards it you just mark it
[16:38] and you give it to uh amen to brother

[16:57] keep him safe traveling west he's there
[16:58] as well it's a nice holiday nice break
[17:00] for him amen
[17:02] so let's do our best that we can
[17:06] amen for us to serve us for 40 years
[17:08] amen we can do the best we can and uh
[17:11] just give honor and remember a life of
[17:14] ministry served to the lord amen and
[17:17] from that ministry
[17:18] there's other sons that have raised up
[17:21] amen other ministries that have raised
[17:22] up
[17:23] they're not only confined in this local
[17:25] church
[17:26] the other people out there preaching
[17:27] because of this ministry
[17:29] amen other people are fellowshipping the
[17:31] message churches because of the ministry
[17:33] that came here amen so i i certainly
[17:36] know that if pastor ronnie was here he
[17:38] definitely would have celebrated his
[17:40] 70th birthday
[17:42] you know how he loved his birthday
[17:45] amen
[17:46] so uh you want you want me to have
[17:48] people that celebrate well we're not
[17:49] celebrating the 70th we're doing a
[17:51] memorial

[17:56] so he's in the youth the best body of
[17:59] his life amen so we trust him and
[18:01] everyone to cooperate with them
[18:03] amen so this morning we're happy to have
[18:05] with us
[18:06] my mom
[18:08] in grace
[18:09] they usually say in grace not in law
[18:13] and my daring law amen let's welcome you
[18:16] let's give them a hand amen hallelujah
[18:20] spend some time with us
[18:22] anticipating the arrival of the
[18:24] grandchild
[18:27] and uh it's an exciting time so we're
[18:29] not sure any day now
[18:31] amen no man not the day of the hour
[18:34] amen but the lord knows this one
[18:36] amen because life comes from god so we

[19:01] just a plain thing amen it's a gift it's
[19:04] a calling and it's something amen
[19:06] shouldn't be taken lightly
[19:08] amen so we know amen
[19:10] that the minister would have studied
[19:13] and he would have sought the lord for a
[19:14] message for us so we come now and we do
[19:16] our part we draw from the minister
[19:19] amen we don't come to be entertained
[19:22] we don't come to watch
[19:23] amen
[19:24] what's the action what's the move but we
[19:27] pull on the gift
[19:28] amen something even the minister may not
[19:30] even have in his mind to say but you got
[19:33] pulling you
[19:34] and you can operate the gift
[19:36] amen and god can speak directly to your
[19:38] need this morning
[19:40] amen so without wasting uh much more
[19:43] time amen let's stand together even as
[19:45] we sing word of god ever true

[21:11] lovely name of our lord and savior
[21:14] jesus christ amen it's certainly a
[21:17] wonderful protest to be back

[21:22] africa
[21:23] and i'm certainly happy to be with
[21:25] the children the grandchildren
[21:28] and the trust that god will send the
[21:30] bless of saiyan as we await
[21:33] the new arrival amen so may god bless
[21:37] karen i think
[21:40] what i think i know

[21:59] [Music]
[22:01] what a wonderful
[22:03] time
[22:04] season
[22:06] for especially pastor adrian and the
[22:09] first time that i'm preaching god in the
[22:11] east
[22:12] amen so may god certainly bless him
[22:16] just so
[22:18] trusted i couldn't make i couldn't make
[22:21] it
[22:23] but i believe that all things work
[22:25] together for the good to them that love
[22:26] the lord amen
[22:28] so
[22:29] i think adrian has just pulled me back
[22:32] out of retirement
[22:33] so if
[22:35] if i make a mistake behind the pulpit
[22:37] this afternoon today it's his fault amen
[22:42] so may god bless him and
[22:44] certainly happy
[22:46] to address the church in durban
[22:49] and also
[22:50] certainly miss
[22:52] our precious pastor ronnie that passed
[22:54] on and trust that the lord will
[22:56] certainly
[22:57] rest his body
[22:59] in peace until
[23:01] uh he comes back to uh greet us because
[23:05] that's a promise that god amen
[23:07] he's coming back again and
[23:09] we can say for sure but we will see him
[23:13] and
[23:14] it's not it's not
[23:17] him coming but it's us going hallelujah
[23:21] yeah so he's already made it and
[23:24] we also find ourselves like i was in a
[23:27] little bit of an accident
[23:30] i almost
[23:32] took my life
[23:34] wrote the bucky off
[23:37] but by god's grace
[23:40] i just walked out of that accident with
[23:42] a
[23:43] headache
[23:44] after two
[23:46] i could think the way that my head felt
[23:49] must have been both airbags it would not
[23:51] be amen
[23:52] so i trust that you keep on praying for
[23:55] me and god will give us grace and mercy
[23:58] and trust that everything
[24:00] that he's done is for
[24:02] the good amen amen doesn't matter what
[24:04] it is for the good amen that's not what
[24:06] happens to you and i believe that
[24:09] all things work together for the good to
[24:12] them that love the lord
[24:14] if you know that you love him remember
[24:16] doesn't matter how bad the situation
[24:18] seems it's for the good to them
[24:22] so i certainly want to
[24:26] bless you with a
[24:28] sermon this morning
[24:30] i trust that god will send me how much
[24:32] time do i have for the past savior
[24:37] it's not it's not covered
[24:41] so
[24:42] my wife reminded me she said it's two
[24:44] two-hour sun
[24:46] i have to stick to two hours
[24:50] what did you say the church is two hours
[24:53] okay sorry
[24:58] i trusted god was in the uh graces with
[25:01] his presence amen amen that's all we
[25:04] need nothing else
[25:05] and then trust that the lord will simply
[25:08] bless us as we stand
[25:21] [Music]

[25:27] [Music]

[28:42] and the whole earth was of one language
[28:45] and one speech

[28:49] journeyed from the east they found a
[28:52] plane in the land of chennai and it
[28:54] dwelt there and they said to one another
[28:57] go to let us make brick and burn them
[29:00] thoroughly
[29:01] and they had bricked for stone and slime
[29:04] and they for mortar
[29:05] and they said go to let us hold us a
[29:08] city and a towel will stop may reach
[29:11] unto heaven and let us make us a name
[29:14] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[29:16] face of the whole earth amen and the
[29:18] lord came down to see the city and the
[29:20] tower which a children of men
[29:22] builded and the lord said behold the
[29:24] people is one
[29:26] and they have all one language and this
[29:28] they begin to do and now
[29:31] nothing will be restrained from them
[29:33] which they have imagined to do amen
[29:36] so we'll stop right
[29:38] there turn to the book of matthew
[29:41] chapter 16
[29:45] and you also start from this one
[29:49] reading if you all have it
[29:57] the pharisees also with the sadducees
[30:01] came and tempting desired him that he
[30:04] should show them a sign from heaven and
[30:07] the answer then said unto them when it
[30:10] is evening
[30:11] you say
[30:12] it will be fair weather for the sky is
[30:14] red
[30:15] and in the morning it will be foul
[30:17] weather today for the sky is red and
[30:20] lowering
[30:21] ye hypocrites
[30:22] you can discern the face of the sky but
[30:25] you cannot discern the signs of the
[30:28] times
[30:29] a wicked and adulterous generation
[30:32] seeketh after a sign and they shall no
[30:34] sign be given unto it but the sign of
[30:36] the prophet jonah
[30:38] and he left them and departed
[30:41] may god bless the reading of his will
[30:43] you may be seated this morning
[30:54] so
[31:04] [Music]
[31:16] if i can maybe just have a request
[31:18] may i change the bottles around i
[31:20] haven't used this one
[31:23] so i just need a warmer
[31:26] bottle thank you
[31:34] now i've got a title um
[31:37] uniting time
[31:39] yeah so
[31:40] try to keep it simple
[31:42] and straightforward so
[31:45] maybe dive here and there we dive in and
[31:49] come back up
[31:50] get some
[31:51] breath and
[31:53] try to just float on top and then
[31:57] so once in a while
[31:59] take a dive again so we trust that
[32:02] we'll just keep your thinking kept your
[32:04] spiritual thinking caps on and trust in
[32:06] god will certainly lesser snow
[32:09] we
[32:09] [Music]
[32:10] trust that you are all
[32:12] comfortable
[32:30] those that i don't know by name
[32:32] i trust that
[32:34] god will certainly bless you because i
[32:36] feel honored to
[32:40] speak to you amen from a scriptural
[32:44] message standpoint and i trust that god
[32:46] will certainly give us grace
[32:48] and our understanding will be
[32:49] enlightened
[32:51] by what i have to say and that
[32:54] you'll be
[32:55] more confused than you got enlightened
[32:58] by god's grace so i believe that
[33:01] god is not as complicated as we make him
[33:04] not to be because he makes everything so
[33:07] simple that a child will understand what
[33:10] message is all about what these
[33:12] scriptures are all about amen because
[33:14] it's written that he reveals his secrets
[33:18] amen
[33:19] not only to his prophets but he reveals
[33:21] it to babes such
[33:31] people
[33:32] that gets the message from the
[33:34] scriptures
[33:35] but it's fishermen his mechanics
[33:38] housewives
[33:39] and
[33:40] students
[33:42] so i was a student myself when i came
[33:44] into the message
[33:46] in grade 10 so
[33:48] and i didn't have an understanding of
[33:50] the message all i knew was that i wanted
[33:53] to be saved
[33:54] that was what mattered to me i didn't
[33:57] grow up in the message
[33:58] and i grew up in the world
[34:01] i was reading this morning
[34:04] and
[34:05] i saw a name by the uh
[34:09] pat tyler
[34:10] and i was wondering how who's respect
[34:12] tyler because brother brown constantly
[34:16] called his name asked him to read the
[34:18] bible and
[34:19] calling a friend and i realized that
[34:23] i was listening to a message and
[34:27] i thought well
[34:28] this is basically the message that i
[34:30] should be preaching because brother
[34:32] branham said
[34:33] isn't that so brother pat
[34:35] and i said well that's a message then
[34:37] i'm going to have to preach this morning
[34:40] that's why i looked him up and i saw
[34:41] that he was a tyler
[34:44] who was a
[34:46] gangster that was converted as a former
[34:48] gangster
[34:50] and uh
[34:51] god brought him into the message
[34:54] so it doesn't matter who you are amen
[34:58] god has got a place for you amen in his
[35:01] economy
[35:02] and i trust that god will certainly give
[35:04] us grace i was never in a church i
[35:07] always wanted to
[35:09] find myself
[35:10] going to a church but i was more like on
[35:12] the sporting field
[35:14] trying to do what the world does but by
[35:16] god's grace he turned me around
[35:19] he set my foot upon a rock amen
[35:22] hallelujah and here i am today
[35:24] knowing that jesus christ is the same
[35:27] yesterday today and forever and
[35:29] everything that i wanted to do
[35:32] i did by god's grace
[35:34] and that was
[35:36] storming first in my heart
[35:39] that i wanted to be
[35:41] a son of god amen i would have been
[35:44] about four maybe five six six years old
[35:48] and somebody asked me
[35:50] are you going to heaven i said i don't
[35:53] know
[35:54] [Music]
[35:55] and that
[35:56] question stuck with me
[36:00] for years and years
[36:02] until i was about 17 years old
[36:05] he said i could give my life to the lord
[36:09] i want to find
[36:10] jesus in my heart
[36:14] and not knowing parents didn't go to
[36:16] church
[36:17] one was the seventh-day adventist the
[36:19] other one was a union congregationalist
[36:23] and
[36:24] we didn't know what church to go to
[36:26] catholic seven days adventures
[36:28] and uh
[36:30] by god's grace the message came away
[36:33] and saw the cloud
[36:35] amen
[36:36] my cousin told me
[36:38] that he's seven angels
[36:40] hallelujah
[36:42] and
[36:43] today i can see those angels right there
[36:46] in the cloud
[36:47] people can't see it amen they said it's
[36:50] a rocket hallelujah but to me it's jesus
[36:53] christ out there amen that's him
[36:56] nothing else so i certainly am happy to
[36:59] know that
[37:00] uh
[37:01] what doesn't mean anything to the world
[37:03] means more to me than life
[37:06] when i look at
[37:08] the cloud i look at the pillar of fire
[37:11] over the property in the picture
[37:13] that was taken
[37:15] people will kind of reject that
[37:18] and that's why
[37:19] my subject this morning included in my
[37:22] title uniting time and my subject is
[37:26] the rejected one
[37:28] amen if you've never been rejected you
[37:31] won't grow amen there needs to come a
[37:33] rejection
[37:35] if you ever asked at school
[37:38] to take a girl out and she said no
[37:43] you feel kind of rejected amen and you
[37:46] don't know where to put your head you
[37:47] don't know what to do
[37:49] i was in survey
[37:52] raid 1 they would call it
[37:54] and we were all sitting around this
[37:57] beautiful girl
[37:58] amen and everybody was asking do you
[38:02] like me and do you like me and she said
[38:04] yes yes and when it came to me she said
[38:07] no
[38:10] so i kind of
[38:12] thought well
[38:14] you kind of learn
[38:15] you know how to
[38:17] handle those things
[38:19] it stuck with me for a while
[38:21] but you kind of
[38:23] sort of
[38:24] think well
[38:26] these things happen in life and that
[38:30] you need to be pushed one side
[38:32] and then jesus came on this earth and he
[38:34] was the rejected one nobody else like he
[38:38] could be rejected
[38:39] did nothing
[38:40] the god of heaven and earth he created
[38:43] all things
[38:44] but he was the reject one so
[38:47] who are we
[38:49] a man to
[38:51] escape being rejected
[38:53] and we feel down that we failed maybe a
[38:56] grade or we failed out
[38:58] you know to get a job or to be top of
[39:00] the class
[39:02] or to do any little thing and be
[39:04] rejected and then you find
[39:06] it builds character
[39:08] once you find yourself in those
[39:11] places it builds character
[39:13] so
[39:14] i just want to share a few quotations
[39:17] with you nothing that you don't know
[39:19] and i trust that god will certainly
[39:21] bless you
[39:22] and we look at
[39:25] the scriptures
[39:29] and i would like to share some uh things
[39:32] maybe historical
[39:34] issues with regard to the seals
[39:37] like i said it will just be a short
[39:40] piece to share with you and i think it
[39:43] blessed me and i believe it will bless
[39:45] you
[39:48] now
[39:50] we find that
[39:55] the bible says in the book of luke
[39:58] i'd like to maybe read it there also
[40:01] and then we can
[40:03] have the sunday school teaching
[40:06] now he said beware of the 11 of the
[40:09] pharisees
[40:11] which is hypocrisy
[40:13] verse 11
[40:15] it's his amen
[40:17] so for there is nothing covered that
[40:19] shall not
[40:20] be revealed
[40:23] now think about the seals
[40:25] think about the thunders
[40:27] think about adoption think about the
[40:30] baptism of the holy ghost
[40:32] think about all these things water
[40:34] baptism
[40:35] all covered
[40:36] based on the fact that we were
[40:40] we were
[40:41] clothed over we were veiled
[40:44] from the apostolic message
[40:49] that
[40:50] came on the day of pentecost on about
[40:53] 120
[40:55] amen
[40:56] and the bible
[40:58] is not
[40:59] exact on that
[41:02] outpouring
[41:03] of how many received it and he said it's
[41:05] about 120 people
[41:08] and we find that
[41:10] since then 3000 and then
[41:13] azusa street ended up with a lot of holy
[41:17] spirit
[41:18] coming down upon people in measure so we
[41:22] find that
[41:23] we didn't know what it means to be
[41:25] baptized in water
[41:27] and what the correct formula was yes but
[41:30] god by his grace
[41:33] came with revelation chapter 10 and
[41:35] verse 7 and said but
[41:37] in the days of the voice amen so there
[41:41] had to come a voice today
[41:43] to reveal the mystery of god amen so it
[41:46] was a mystery and the mysteries
[41:50] the prophet would say
[41:52] it
[41:53] is the reason why we don't know the
[41:56] mysteries is because we are not taught
[41:58] the mystery
[42:00] and then
[42:01] sometimes we find that pastors will have
[42:04] a kind of a mystery
[42:06] and the people would just be hanging
[42:08] there like thunders or adoption
[42:11] uh
[42:13] big words like those amen and it's as
[42:15] simple as it sounds
[42:18] because the bible tells us that the
[42:20] thunder is the voice of god amen
[42:23] it's as simple as that you don't have to
[42:26] kind of
[42:28] like
[42:29] when he was on mount transfiguration
[42:32] some said they thundered and others
[42:34] heard yeah
[42:38] from different avenues the way they were
[42:41] listening at this
[42:43] sound
[42:44] there were at least two people that got
[42:47] the different revelation of what
[42:49] happened on non-transfiguration
[42:52] so he
[42:53] what do you hear today
[42:55] yeah him
[42:56] jesus or hear he the evangelist or hear
[43:01] the pastor what he's got to say or is it
[43:03] what god has got to say that's the
[43:06] bottom line amen amen in any company if
[43:09] you can't get the bottom line sorted out
[43:12] then you're going to become bankrupt
[43:15] hallelujah so get the bottom line
[43:18] straight enough to know that you are
[43:21] profitable yes
[43:23] amen
[43:25] not with the f but the ph
[43:27] in the center profitable
[43:30] there there has to be
[43:32] someone on the scene today in the amount
[43:36] of confusion that's happening we have to
[43:39] find ourselves profitable amen there has
[43:42] to be eyes because remember
[43:45] all movement in the body
[43:48] is below from the eye and down
[43:52] all movement amen
[43:55] anything above the eye there's no
[43:57] movement
[44:00] hallelujah you can maybe cause some
[44:02] wrinkles but that's all you're going to
[44:04] get a man above the eye but every
[44:07] movement is below the eye and when the
[44:10] eyes come
[44:12] you find that
[44:13] the eyes speak our prophet
[44:16] amen
[44:17] and if you don't have a prophet you are
[44:19] blind and that's why this age
[44:22] they've got all kinds of ministries
[44:26] they've got all ministries to kind of
[44:29] build the church to get the funds in to
[44:32] get out there and get the crowds in amen
[44:37] but
[44:38] there's no i
[44:40] because the bible has prophesied god is
[44:43] prophesied
[44:44] they will be
[44:46] rich
[44:47] increased in goods
[44:49] there will be people that will be
[44:52] uh
[44:52] heady high-minded
[44:55] amen
[44:56] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[44:58] god and who's god the word amen they
[45:01] don't care about the word the word
[45:03] doesn't matter to them no more
[45:06] but there's a people in the land that's
[45:08] got eyes to see
[45:10] amen back
[45:12] and forward presently hallelujah because
[45:16] jesus christ is the same yesterday
[45:19] today and forever he's the unchanging
[45:22] god amen and that's why we have to look
[45:25] how
[45:26] what are we united to
[45:29] what are we up against when we look at
[45:33] the circumstances in this world
[45:36] who are we going to believe are we going
[45:39] to take god at his word or are we going
[45:41] to take what man says
[45:43] flesh
[45:45] and blood
[45:46] has not revealed this to you but my
[45:50] father in heaven
[45:51] amen and who is my father in heaven it's
[45:55] the holy ghost amen amen nothing less
[45:58] nothing more
[45:59] he is this great spirit that created
[46:03] heavens and earth amen amen before jesus
[46:06] the body set his foot on the stone
[46:10] the father was there amen
[46:12] and that's why isaiah could say about
[46:15] this what
[46:17] the catholic people will call the
[46:19] eternal son
[46:20] but yet comes the eye and he says
[46:22] there's no such a thing amen as an
[46:25] eternal sign yes amen because the sun at
[46:28] the beginning and the sun would have an
[46:30] end and that confused me
[46:33] quite a lot
[46:34] because we are sons
[46:37] so if we are not eternal what are we but
[46:40] we are speaking of that logos that went
[46:43] out of god amen we are talking about
[46:46] that son
[46:47] being eternal because if that son is
[46:50] eternal then we believe in the trinity
[46:53] we believe in a father person a some
[46:56] person and a holy ghost person
[46:58] but the bible declares that the name
[47:02] of the father and the son and the holy
[47:05] ghost is the lord jesus christ amen
[47:10] so that was made visible to us in our
[47:13] minds in our hearts that revelation 10 7
[47:17] but in the days of the voice of the
[47:19] seventh angel he unites us back to the
[47:23] lord jesus christ and back to the
[47:26] apostolic father
[47:27] because remember we were baptizing in
[47:30] the name of the father and of the son
[47:32] and of the holy ghost in three persons
[47:35] and calling titles names amen
[47:38] but we find that the name of those
[47:41] titles belong to the eternal god amen
[47:45] hallelujah it's the lord jesus christ
[47:51] now after the voice has spoken and
[47:54] revealed the mystery
[47:57] of god which is the lord jesus christ we
[48:00] find that this son
[48:03] now meets paul on his way to damascus
[48:07] and he said
[48:08] i am jesus
[48:11] hallelujah so that means this jesus
[48:15] is no longer that son that came from
[48:18] mary amen
[48:20] in her home he is now back as isaiah
[48:23] said the son shall be the everlasting
[48:28] father
[48:30] oh
[48:30] my you see you can't take one scripture
[48:33] and make it work you have to get the
[48:36] whole puzzle together
[48:38] otherwise the car will be eating grass
[48:40] right on the top of the tree
[48:43] hey man bring the cow back amen
[48:47] back under the ground back on his four
[48:49] feet amen
[48:51] and doesn't matter how nicely it fits
[48:54] you all of us had a puzzle to complete
[48:57] and you find that some pieces fit amen
[49:00] but the picture doesn't
[49:02] match amen
[49:04] hallelujah so when jesus said i am
[49:09] hallelujah jesus
[49:12] paul recognized that elohim amen jehovah
[49:17] jireh
[49:18] is jesus
[49:20] wow
[49:21] he found his face amen amen
[49:25] lord yahweh
[49:28] who are down
[49:31] and when yahweh said on jesus
[49:35] he got the revelation amen
[49:38] jesus the god
[49:40] of the old testament is the
[49:42] jesus now you might not find that a
[49:45] scripture written but it's the
[49:47] revelation amen the god of the old
[49:49] testament is the jesus of the new amen
[49:52] oh wow
[49:54] so we thank god
[49:55] without the eyes now you would think now
[49:59] here's two
[50:01] uh elijah
[50:03] two elijahs
[50:05] there was going to be five elijahs
[50:08] altogether
[50:09] amen
[50:11] and
[50:12] when you share the word elijah
[50:15] you just find here's a man the original
[50:18] elijah he comes from nowhere
[50:21] and he rebukes this jezebel and ahab
[50:25] when you come from
[50:27] no mother no father that's identified in
[50:30] scripture but it's just elijah but he
[50:34] had the spirit of god upon him
[50:37] so when you hear the word elijah just
[50:39] think about that it's not a man but it's
[50:42] the spirit of god in a man amen
[50:45] hallelujah
[50:46] so that's why
[50:48] the spirit of elijah is used
[50:51] five
[50:52] times amen because it's god speaking yes
[50:57] it's not a man it's not like we would
[51:00] think it's a prophet so here comes uh
[51:03] malachi
[51:04] and he promises
[51:06] that there'll be elijah
[51:09] turning the hearts of the fathers of the
[51:12] law
[51:13] to the apostolic or rather pentecostal
[51:16] children yes amen so there was the law
[51:19] fathers
[51:20] and they needed to change their hearts
[51:24] to what jesus was giving amen
[51:28] he was giving the holy ghost
[51:31] and we needed to receive the holy ghost
[51:33] and only the apostolic the children
[51:36] amen would get the holy spirit so there
[51:39] we find that when john came on the scene
[51:43] he was already united in flesh
[51:47] to jesus
[51:49] he was jesus cousin in other words
[51:52] [Music]
[51:53] elizabeth and mary
[51:55] they were cousins so that made them
[51:57] second cousins
[51:59] according to the flesh
[52:01] what we would know but we know that
[52:04] jesus was no flesh
[52:07] he was created
[52:10] amen
[52:13] and self yes oh yes
[52:16] there was nothing human about jesus but
[52:20] he was all human amen oh my
[52:24] so we find that elijah was now
[52:27] being promised
[52:29] that he would turn the law of the jewish
[52:32] fathers to these
[52:34] pentecostal children amen
[52:37] and then
[52:39] when the pentecostal children moved on
[52:42] we find that the gentiles started coming
[52:45] in because remember peter was sent to
[52:48] the jews
[52:50] and paul
[52:51] was a
[52:53] missionary or an apostle to the gentiles
[52:57] because they rejected the message of
[53:00] paul
[53:01] and he said i turned to the gentiles yes
[53:03] amen and that's us amen
[53:05] so when you turn to the gentiles here
[53:09] comes a bright tree being formed
[53:12] and when the bride tree was formed we
[53:15] find that here were seven
[53:18] messengers seven voices
[53:21] seven angels
[53:23] earthly angels not the ones with the
[53:25] wings but a messenger and an angel is
[53:28] one in the same thing as far as a man is
[53:30] concerned he's sent to us yes he's a
[53:33] saint one he's a missionary and that's
[53:36] why you find in the message that there's
[53:38] so many apostles great men that call
[53:40] themselves apostles because they want to
[53:43] be the top of the food chain
[53:45] they want to be above the pasta
[53:47] and the prophet says there's no one
[53:49] above
[53:50] the elder
[53:53] right yes
[53:54] amen there's nothing above the elder
[53:59] if you want to be an apostle and come
[54:01] and sit here as an apostle and think
[54:03] that you're about the pastor
[54:07] get out
[54:09] because you don't belong
[54:12] sorry to put you out i don't know who
[54:14] you are
[54:18] but that's
[54:19] the crux of the matter
[54:21] there's nothing above the pastors
[54:26] and that's why these men
[54:27] that's calling themselves apostles
[54:30] they make themselves above the past
[54:34] amen
[54:35] because of advantage
[54:39] you find that these men are usurping
[54:41] authority over god's
[54:44] other
[54:46] and that never happened in church
[54:48] not in the apostolic church not today
[54:51] because he's the same god amen
[54:55] so we have to realize what an apostle is
[54:58] an apostle
[54:59] is united in the body by the holy ghost
[55:03] because remember
[55:05] gifts and callings are without
[55:07] repentance you don't have to repent to
[55:09] be an apostle you don't have to repent
[55:12] to be a pastor amen amen there are
[55:15] pastors today behind the pulpit without
[55:18] the holy ghost
[55:22] now that is a very hard statement to pay
[55:24] man but that's the truth of the matter
[55:27] because you can be gifted but without
[55:29] the holy man
[55:31] that is why you have to be united to the
[55:34] head amen
[55:37] and the only way to be united to the
[55:39] head is to receive the holy ghost amen
[55:42] [Music]
[55:44] and that's why when you look back in the
[55:46] book of genesis these people the whole
[55:50] earth was of one language
[55:53] and of one speech
[55:56] and once that happens you get away from
[55:59] god
[56:00] absolutely when a board united in a
[56:04] church against a pastor that church is
[56:06] dead
[56:08] there's nothing left of it amen when the
[56:11] people comes against the pastor the
[56:13] church is dead
[56:15] when the pastor comes against the people
[56:18] there's nothing left of them because
[56:20] they are not united yes amen
[56:23] amen
[56:24] you have to unite like two donkeys
[56:28] trying to get to food
[56:31] and they both tied
[56:33] together
[56:34] but you find that there's a bundle of
[56:37] hay and here's a bundle of hay and the
[56:39] rope is not enough for them to feed
[56:42] both right amen
[56:45] so the rope
[56:47] has to they have to come to a decision
[56:50] to first eat the one side
[56:53] and then go to the other side amen
[56:56] and both of them as they feast together
[56:59] we'll get half of this and half of that
[57:01] which will be a half plus a half peace
[57:04] one amen
[57:05] oh my
[57:06] united time it's time to be united
[57:11] in in that sense where if we are not we
[57:15] are divided yes and a divided house will
[57:19] not stand amen
[57:22] so here you find that the elijah turning
[57:24] the hearts to
[57:27] the children
[57:29] is to the pentecostal and then the same
[57:32] scripture says at the heart of the
[57:35] children to the fathers now we would say
[57:38] apostolic fathers
[57:40] we say yes but what kind of a children
[57:43] are we
[57:45] for our hearts to be turned
[57:47] that means
[57:49] we
[57:50] are lost in darkness
[57:53] because why would our hearts be turned
[57:55] in
[57:56] amen
[57:57] so that means
[57:58] ad325
[58:01] the nice saying fathers
[58:03] said
[58:05] we'll take
[58:06] titles instead of the name
[58:08] and when they took titles
[58:12] we became the children of the nicene
[58:14] fathers that's true and somebody said
[58:16] amen amen
[58:18] when that happened there had to come a
[58:22] messenger
[58:24] to turn our hearts back amen yes
[58:27] pastorizing fathers
[58:29] back to the apostolic
[58:32] now they're not children anymore they're
[58:35] now the fathers yes
[58:37] they were children yes when they were
[58:39] the law fathers
[58:41] but when they
[58:43] 2 000 years went on the children became
[58:47] the fathers
[58:49] and these nice in children we were
[58:51] baptizing in the name of father son and
[58:53] holy ghost but revelation 10 7 comes and
[58:57] he says
[58:58] lord jesus christ
[59:02] now i want to say this anyone today
[59:05] that's not baptized according to the
[59:07] formula of matthew chapter 28 and verse
[59:09] 19 which says the name of the father son
[59:12] and holy ghost is lord jesus christ
[59:14] you will not be united with the head
[59:18] what does that mean brother pat that
[59:20] means you won't receive the holy ghost
[59:22] you say why does it matter brother pat
[59:25] because it mattered to paul
[59:28] in acts chapter 19 he met a bunch of
[59:31] doctors converted by john but they were
[59:34] preaching christ remember they were
[59:37] preaching what elijah was preaching
[59:41] elijah was john
[59:43] because jesus identified john and he
[59:45] said this is the elias that you come yes
[59:49] amen
[59:50] hallelujah and when this elias came then
[59:53] you're not
[59:56] but he said behold the lamb of god that
[59:58] takes away the unbelief of the world yes
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:02] so then jesus identified
[1:00:06] john as the liars of malachi chapter 4
[1:00:10] the first part
[1:00:12] but the second part was identified by
[1:00:15] the holy ghost himself
[1:00:18] now where's the holy ghost today
[1:00:21] the holy ghost is the bride you can't
[1:00:23] find it anywhere else amen amen how do
[1:00:25] you get into the bride by being baptized
[1:00:28] by being born again yes and the new
[1:00:31] birth
[1:00:32] is two phases in other words you
[1:00:36] are entering in
[1:00:38] and you are seen
[1:00:40] and the bible jesus said to nicodemus he
[1:00:43] said to be born again
[1:00:46] you must be born of water yes yes
[1:00:49] and of spirit yes
[1:00:52] those two phases happens with the new
[1:00:54] birth
[1:00:55] but now watch what happens and he says
[1:00:57] now
[1:00:58] unless you are born of water which means
[1:01:02] you've got to be baptized
[1:01:04] to signify that you are
[1:01:06] starting the new birth
[1:01:08] hallelujah like a baby is born in water
[1:01:13] before it's born yes right on the
[1:01:16] outside it's there waiting in water
[1:01:19] being shaped
[1:01:21] receiving its organs it's bones it's
[1:01:25] toes it's all kinds of uh
[1:01:29] elements
[1:01:31] that's being added to that baby to be
[1:01:33] united with his spirit
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:01:38] oh my so now you find that when
[1:01:42] this
[1:01:43] child is born of water
[1:01:45] there must be a formula yes amen
[1:01:48] hallelujah
[1:01:50] without the formula you are not going
[1:01:52] anywhere john comes and he says
[1:01:55] unto repentance
[1:01:57] hallelujah
[1:01:58] and everybody says well john is
[1:02:00] baptizing now and here jesus comes and
[1:02:03] the bible said jesus was not baptizing
[1:02:07] but his disciples were doing the baptism
[1:02:09] but here was jesus and his group
[1:02:12] baptizing and john and his group
[1:02:14] baptizing
[1:02:16] but here comes paul
[1:02:18] and paul says
[1:02:20] unto what were you baptized
[1:02:23] they said we were baptized unto john
[1:02:27] can you see how important what a baptism
[1:02:29] is
[1:02:30] it's for the new birth
[1:02:32] it's for god accepting you
[1:02:35] so that you can
[1:02:36] be
[1:02:37] entered into the body
[1:02:40] that you can be united with jesus christ
[1:02:43] amen so anyone that's baptized in the
[1:02:45] name of jesus christ you must be
[1:02:47] baptized over
[1:02:49] because
[1:02:50] the correct formula is lord jesus christ
[1:02:53] amen amen anyone that's baptized in the
[1:02:55] name of jesus must be baptized over
[1:02:58] because the correct formula is lord
[1:03:00] jesus christ because the mystery of god
[1:03:03] is revealed yes yes who the father son
[1:03:06] and all you go see do you see how simple
[1:03:07] it is but yet so powerful
[1:03:10] and if you reject that
[1:03:12] you're not going anywhere but to the
[1:03:14] tribulation
[1:03:16] because all those that's got the holy
[1:03:18] ghost goes in the rapture amen those
[1:03:21] without the holy ghost you can be you
[1:03:23] can have faith you can avert you you can
[1:03:26] have knowledge you can have temperance
[1:03:28] you can have
[1:03:31] brotherly kindness you can have all
[1:03:33] those virtues
[1:03:35] but you have not been accepted
[1:03:38] because god accepts your faith when he
[1:03:41] sees you are obedient amen if you're not
[1:03:44] obedient he won't accept your faith
[1:03:47] and that's why when we look at people
[1:03:50] that were baptized in the name of father
[1:03:52] son and holy ghost luther baptized like
[1:03:54] that
[1:03:55] but he was obedient to the revelation he
[1:03:58] received
[1:04:00] it was not it was not the mystery of god
[1:04:02] was not revealed to them like it's today
[1:04:04] for us
[1:04:07] the responsibility for us is
[1:04:11] that if
[1:04:13] much is given
[1:04:15] much is required
[1:04:18] hallelujah there's not a greater message
[1:04:22] to reach this other than the one malachi
[1:04:25] chapter four to turn our hearts back to
[1:04:28] the episode
[1:04:30] away from the nights and fathers away
[1:04:33] from titles back to the name amen
[1:04:36] back to life
[1:04:38] back
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:47] baptized on the elijah
[1:04:50] and he said
[1:04:52] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:04:55] you believed
[1:04:57] have you been in the message
[1:04:59] you haven't received the holy ghost yet
[1:05:02] how were you baptized
[1:05:04] hallelujah they said well we don't know
[1:05:07] about any holy ghost and he says well
[1:05:09] how were you baptized he said well we
[1:05:10] were baptized according to john's
[1:05:13] baptism he said but you're preaching
[1:05:15] christ
[1:05:16] you baptist but you're preaching christ
[1:05:18] and he recognized the formula for
[1:05:21] baptism was wrong yes and then paul said
[1:05:25] come let's baptize you and look right
[1:05:27] and he says
[1:05:29] paul baptized them in the name of the
[1:05:31] lord jesus
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:33] didn't say lord jesus christ but when
[1:05:36] peter baptizes
[1:05:38] luke writes
[1:05:39] jesus christ
[1:05:42] so look knew exactly
[1:05:44] what the name of the father son and holy
[1:05:47] ghost is because why would he leave out
[1:05:49] christ in luke 19
[1:05:51] or acts chapter 19
[1:05:53] and leave out lord in acts chapter two
[1:05:58] he knew
[1:05:59] what the name of father son and holy
[1:06:01] ghost is so why would paul now do
[1:06:04] something different than matthew 28 19's
[1:06:08] instruction by jesus christ
[1:06:12] he wouldn't
[1:06:14] and that's why
[1:06:15] god accepts your faith
[1:06:18] and he gives you the holy ghost amen
[1:06:21] that's why you have to work your faith
[1:06:24] add to your faith virtue and knowledge
[1:06:27] and temperance and patience and
[1:06:30] godliness and brotherly kindness
[1:06:33] and when god sees those things
[1:06:36] that you have worked your faith
[1:06:38] he gives you in other words he accepts
[1:06:41] your
[1:06:42] faith amen
[1:06:47] hallelujah
[1:06:49] so
[1:06:51] let those things
[1:06:52] stand out in your life
[1:06:55] let there be
[1:06:57] the foundation the rock
[1:07:00] that god gave you faith
[1:07:03] and now for you to be united with the
[1:07:06] head hallelujah
[1:07:08] not everybody wants to be united with
[1:07:10] the head
[1:07:12] but they forget about the cap
[1:07:16] and i'm going to tell you what the cap
[1:07:17] is
[1:07:18] the cap is for the individual
[1:07:21] amen everyone gets the holy spirit
[1:07:24] while you're in this life if you are
[1:07:26] predestinated to me
[1:07:28] but the whole church from paul
[1:07:31] to this day gets the headstone
[1:07:36] can you get it separated now
[1:07:38] the cat is for the individual it's the
[1:07:40] holy ghost we receive the holy ghost in
[1:07:44] measure
[1:07:45] don't tell me that you've got the
[1:07:46] fullness of the holy ghost like jesus
[1:07:48] had it no you'll never get it like that
[1:07:51] you'll get it like those on the day of
[1:07:53] pentecost when god separated himself and
[1:07:56] united himself with 120 and filled them
[1:08:00] because of the obedience going to the
[1:08:02] upper room
[1:08:04] have you gone to the upper room yet
[1:08:07] have you received the experience
[1:08:10] and don't think that everybody is going
[1:08:11] to get the same experience no
[1:08:14] but everybody will get the holy spirit
[1:08:17] but your experience will be maybe on
[1:08:19] your knees in front here or you'll be
[1:08:21] sitting with your
[1:08:22] [Music]
[1:08:23] hand in your head or in your face at the
[1:08:25] back there
[1:08:27] hey man or you'll come running from the
[1:08:29] back to the front and run out there and
[1:08:31] run back and all around
[1:08:34] doesn't matter how you receive it as
[1:08:35] long as you receive it amen that's the
[1:08:38] bottom line
[1:08:39] that's when the profit or the or the
[1:08:42] profitability comes in
[1:08:44] when you receive that what god says
[1:08:48] it's not only for you but to your
[1:08:50] children amen
[1:08:52] and to them that's far off even as many
[1:08:55] as the lord your god your call
[1:08:57] i trust you are happy amen
[1:09:00] anybody sleeping
[1:09:03] not yet amen
[1:09:04] so i'm just teaching i'm not trying to
[1:09:06] preach here today
[1:09:08] so i'll try to preach some other time
[1:09:10] maybe in another two years i've been
[1:09:11] here last time two years ago
[1:09:14] hallelujah so i trust that god will
[1:09:16] certainly give us grace but i want to
[1:09:18] keep it as simple as possible
[1:09:20] so that you can understand that
[1:09:23] those two prophets
[1:09:25] were the elijah prophets
[1:09:27] and you know what jesus said of elias
[1:09:30] he said no man born of women greater
[1:09:32] than john yeah hallelujah
[1:09:35] so now here's the word where's the word
[1:09:38] today in the bride
[1:09:39] what was the bride or what does the word
[1:09:41] say of elias for today no one born of
[1:09:44] women greater than william brandon
[1:09:47] you can say that with me amen
[1:09:49] no man i don't care who comes
[1:09:52] man is not if joseph branham or
[1:09:54] bulletpole uh whoever he might be he
[1:09:58] cannot be another one
[1:10:00] outside of william bradley amen amen
[1:10:04] it's not possible yes right because
[1:10:07] jesus said of his elijah no man greater
[1:10:13] and the word will say the same thing
[1:10:14] about
[1:10:15] her eli
[1:10:16] because he said
[1:10:18] his forerunning is coming
[1:10:21] amen
[1:10:22] when the son of man is revealed
[1:10:26] hallelujah
[1:10:27] we find that the son of man was revealed
[1:10:31] in a son of man
[1:10:33] to show forth the bride of the group
[1:10:36] amen
[1:10:38] why he was the elijah he was the friend
[1:10:43] of the group
[1:10:45] that's why he never pointed to himself
[1:10:47] he didn't say i'm the one he said no i'm
[1:10:51] pointing you to jesus christ
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:55] so anyone pointing to himself
[1:10:59] hallelujah is of the devil
[1:11:02] you can't point to yourself because
[1:11:04] that's what lucifer did in heaven he
[1:11:07] pointed to himself
[1:11:09] and when he pointed to himself there was
[1:11:12] one third angels
[1:11:15] that went with him
[1:11:17] because he was pointing to himself they
[1:11:20] fell
[1:11:21] by the lie of lucifer
[1:11:23] now lucifer was just not an angel you
[1:11:26] think that he might be a devil
[1:11:29] looking like with horns no
[1:11:31] he was a light bearer
[1:11:34] he was a minister
[1:11:36] hallelujah he could do any kind of
[1:11:40] thing he was a song leader
[1:11:44] he could preach he could do anything
[1:11:47] but then he pointed to himself when he
[1:11:50] pointed to himself he took a
[1:11:52] third of the church
[1:11:55] hallelujah the whole church in heaven a
[1:11:58] third of that those are that's some
[1:12:01] millions and millions of people
[1:12:04] hallelujah that lucifer
[1:12:07] and that's why it's so hard for them to
[1:12:09] send them to hell yet because there are
[1:12:12] so many on this earth today because they
[1:12:14] fell
[1:12:16] you can't send a demon to hell you can
[1:12:19] only cast him up
[1:12:23] hell is not open yet
[1:12:25] hell is right here on this earth where
[1:12:27] those demon powers are causing all kinds
[1:12:30] of diseases cancer tuberculosis and
[1:12:34] that's why i'm saying today doesn't
[1:12:36] matter what kind of a disease you have
[1:12:39] might be eye trouble stomach trouble
[1:12:42] foot trouble
[1:12:44] matters not
[1:12:46] by the preaching of the word by your
[1:12:49] pastor and every minister the demons are
[1:12:52] cast out
[1:12:53] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:12:56] amen amen
[1:12:58] remember when you walk out there that
[1:13:01] spirit has left you
[1:13:04] you cannot say that you came in and
[1:13:07] walked out with the same demon that you
[1:13:09] came in because we have the authority by
[1:13:12] the word of god we are united with thus
[1:13:16] saith the lord when you walk in you go

[1:17:50] big kind of a virus and they found it in
[1:17:53] an animal called the shrew
[1:17:56] and the shoe
[1:17:57] is packing this virus
[1:17:59] and they don't know how it got to the
[1:18:01] humans
[1:18:02] in china
[1:18:03] but they say it's not highly
[1:18:05] transmissible
[1:18:06] you find that
[1:18:08] they can just press a button now and
[1:18:10] close our church they can press a button
[1:18:13] and keep their past at home
[1:18:16] and they can just spray a few biological
[1:18:18] weapons
[1:18:19] that's what the virus is all about
[1:18:21] biological warfare
[1:18:24] so it's about time that we have a
[1:18:25] spiritual warfare
[1:18:28] it's smaller than those biological
[1:18:30] weapons
[1:18:31] amen but it's more powerful
[1:18:33] it's greater he that's in you he's
[1:18:36] greater and more powerful than he that's
[1:18:39] in china than he that's in russia that
[1:18:43] he that's in the united states of the
[1:18:46] soviet socialist republic
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:51] who are the united states
[1:18:54] the bride amen who is the united states
[1:18:56] united against the bride

[1:19:02] why because they had the truth of the
[1:19:05] word of god amen he had thus saith the
[1:19:08] lord and he spoke to the jezebels of
[1:19:11] this age oh yes and he said
[1:19:14] to the herots or where the king was and
[1:19:17] he said you are not supposed to have
[1:19:20] that horn it's your brother's son
[1:19:23] marriage of divorce
[1:19:25] water baptism
[1:19:26] communion all kinds of things
[1:19:29] john the baptist
[1:19:31] was united to the headstone when
[1:19:35] from his mother's world
[1:19:38] wow
[1:19:39] hallelujah we don't hear that ever
[1:19:41] happening because
[1:19:44] the law and the prophets was until john
[1:19:48] after that it's the new birth
[1:19:51] can somebody say amen
[1:19:53] after john eats the new birth what
[1:19:55] happened to william branham he had to be
[1:19:58] born again
[1:19:59] hallelujah before god could use him
[1:20:02] before he could strengthen his brethren
[1:20:05] he had to go to the upper room
[1:20:09] where his upper room was amen you know
[1:20:11] where you drop the room on your knees
[1:20:14] you want to go up you have to go down

[1:20:26] be good to everyone on your way up
[1:20:28] because you'll be sure to meet them on
[1:20:29] your way down
[1:20:30] amen hallelujah even satan will be there
[1:20:34] to meet you
[1:20:36] because pride takes you up
[1:20:38] but god takes you down amen and when you
[1:20:40] go down hallelujah you don't look either
[1:20:44] not
[1:20:44] when you look down
[1:20:46] you see the kingdom
[1:20:48] hallelujah because from your knees
[1:20:51] you'll go to the water from the water
[1:20:53] you'll have faith
[1:20:55] faith like enoch
[1:20:56] enoch had such a friend that he was so
[1:20:59] united to god that he was not because
[1:21:02] god took him amen he was united
[1:21:06] amen so much so that this world
[1:21:09] couldn't hold him no more right just
[1:21:11] imagine we call it gravity gravity lust
[1:21:15] is hold on enoch

[1:21:27] man the bible says you are a man
[1:21:30] he said god created man
[1:21:34] so ultimately
[1:21:36] amen you are a man
[1:21:39] but he divided man and he said male and
[1:21:42] female
[1:21:43] created you then
[1:21:45] hallelujah
[1:21:47] so sister there's no schism in the body
[1:21:49] of christ

[1:21:53] holy ghost will lead you into all truth
[1:21:55] what you have to do with your gift in
[1:21:57] the body of christ matters not if you're
[1:22:00] a housewife or a mechanic or a doctor or
[1:22:02] a nurse or just a student
[1:22:05] you are in the economy of god by the
[1:22:07] baptism of the holy ghost god accepted
[1:22:10] your faith after you add it to your
[1:22:12] faith faith without works is dead

[1:22:46] so we know who the two elijahs was one
[1:22:49] was john for
[1:22:50] the jews
[1:22:53] and to fought for
[1:22:55] jesus who came to his own
[1:22:57] and he told peter don't go to the
[1:22:59] gentiles
[1:23:00] go to the jews jesus saying that
[1:23:03] why he was a jealous god and he said
[1:23:06] don't you touch my bride yet
[1:23:10] hallelujah i've got a messenger
[1:23:13] that's going to
[1:23:14] you know what happened paul rebuking
[1:23:16] peter
[1:23:17] because
[1:23:18] he
[1:23:19] being
[1:23:21] holy ghost's fault
[1:23:23] amen a man with a holy ghost did you
[1:23:26] know that
[1:23:28] god said
[1:23:29] grieve
[1:23:30] now not the holy ghost
[1:23:33] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:23:37] redemption amen
[1:23:39] so that means if god says don't eat that
[1:23:42] means you can eat
[1:23:43] if god says grieve not that means you
[1:23:46] can grieve
[1:23:47] otherwise why would he say that
[1:23:49] grieve nor not the holy ghost whereby
[1:23:51] you are sealed you are sealed but you
[1:23:53] can grieve you are married but you can
[1:23:56] commit adultery
[1:23:58] hey
[1:23:58] did you know you can commit adultery
[1:24:01] after being married
[1:24:03] yes
[1:24:04] [Music]
[1:24:05] it's possible
[1:24:09] so grieve now not the holy ghost whereby
[1:24:11] you were sealed until the day of
[1:24:12] redemption why because you are still in
[1:24:14] a body of flesh
[1:24:16] amen
[1:24:18] and then you'll call it a mistake
[1:24:20] after willfully
[1:24:21] you won't do it willfully when you have
[1:24:24] the holy spirit
[1:24:26] because now your mistakes are grieving
[1:24:28] god you're making too many mistakes
[1:24:31] and then
[1:24:32] making too many mistakes means that you
[1:24:34] are willfully doing what you are doing
[1:24:36] and i'm saying
[1:24:38] by the grace of god in my spirit grieve
[1:24:41] you ministers
[1:24:42] you laity members
[1:24:45] you trustees and deacons grieve now not
[1:24:48] the holy spirit whereby you are sealed
[1:24:51] until the day of your death you are
[1:24:53] united to christ
[1:24:55] but yet you can grieve him
[1:24:58] because remember
[1:25:00] when
[1:25:01] you make that mistake
[1:25:03] i'm saying it like that because
[1:25:06] it's a mistake you make
[1:25:08] you don't mean to do that
[1:25:10] you don't mean to look
[1:25:12] at that nakedness
[1:25:14] you don't mean to lie
[1:25:17] at that moment to cover your skin
[1:25:19] you don't mean
[1:25:21] to
[1:25:22] run a red light you don't mean to not
[1:25:24] stop at the stop stream
[1:25:27] amen
[1:25:28] fear takes you beyond what you believe
[1:25:31] sometimes
[1:25:33] you know you know what you have to
[1:25:35] believe but your fear takes you beyond
[1:25:37] your faith
[1:25:39] because when your faith goes this way
[1:25:42] fear takes you that way
[1:25:44] oh i'm scared i'm fearful
[1:25:46] so what does it happen when you have
[1:25:48] cancer the doctor declares you've got
[1:25:50] cancer your faith takes you past that
[1:25:52] cancer but your fear will bring it back
[1:25:56] you've been prayed for you've been
[1:25:57] anointed nothing can happen against you
[1:26:00] it's your fear
[1:26:02] and that's why even the doctors as
[1:26:03] unbelieving as they are
[1:26:05] so many of them will tell you to be
[1:26:07] positive what does that mean perfect
[1:26:11] positive the prophet says
[1:26:15] don't ever be negative in your testimony
[1:26:18] because it will take you down yes
[1:26:20] it will kill you to make you sick again
[1:26:23] it will be worse for you
[1:26:25] than the previous time that you were
[1:26:26] single
[1:26:28] are you happy can you say amen
[1:26:30] can everybody say amen
[1:26:32] can i get a sister say amen

[1:27:46] no
[1:27:47] pig
[1:27:48] that's the same with christian
[1:27:51] there's nothing higher than being a
[1:27:54] christian
[1:27:55] that's the highest order that you can
[1:27:57] ever be
[1:27:58] is to be a christian
[1:28:00] amen i feel anointed when i say those
[1:28:04] words
[1:28:05] higher than a christian you cannot be
[1:28:08] you want to be a minister it's lower
[1:28:10] than a christian
[1:28:12] paul said
[1:28:13] there's nothing about me
[1:28:15] that i should boast
[1:28:18] and he said three times i've asked god
[1:28:20] to take this phone
[1:28:21] out of my flesh
[1:28:23] and three times he said my grace
[1:28:28] it or leave it paul my grace is
[1:28:30] sufficient
[1:28:31] so matters not
[1:28:33] in what
[1:28:34] uh
[1:28:37] sphere i am where i find myself
[1:28:41] i'm content with what god said
[1:28:43] and god said my grace is sufficient and
[1:28:46] paul says i glory in my infirmities
[1:28:51] oh why do you want to be blind
[1:28:54] crippled what do you want
[1:28:57] something where the devil has got
[1:28:59] he's got you
[1:29:01] gripped
[1:29:02] he's got you by the throat there's
[1:29:04] nothing you can do about it what do you
[1:29:06] want
[1:29:08] after
[1:29:09] after you've got
[1:29:10] what
[1:29:11] prophet would say satan has got one
[1:29:16] blow one punch coming your way
[1:29:19] amen now satan has got a hard hand he
[1:29:24] doesn't come lightly to you
[1:29:26] why go lightly and face him
[1:29:29] you have to train and exercise
[1:29:32] how
[1:29:33] to get the licks of satan
[1:29:35] hey man away from you amen hallelujah
[1:29:40] when i was young i used to box every day
[1:29:44] of my life at school i used i had to
[1:29:47] keep off my enemies
[1:29:50] because every enemy that saw me want to
[1:29:52] do
[1:29:53] hallelujah and that's the devil he wants
[1:29:55] to fight
[1:29:57] every bit of the way
[1:29:59] but you have to keep your god up
[1:30:02] have on the helmet of salvation
[1:30:05] amen
[1:30:06] that's where you have to find yourself
[1:30:08] because
[1:30:10] it's gonna rain upon you not
[1:30:12] little pebbles it's gonna rock so rocks
[1:30:15] will rain on you
[1:30:17] that's why you need a helmet and the
[1:30:20] bible says it's a helmet of salvation
[1:30:23] i'm saved
[1:30:24] hallelujah amen
[1:30:26] have on the breastplate of righteousness
[1:30:32] what's the breastplate when you look at
[1:30:33] the priest
[1:30:34] he's got all the stones 12 stones on his
[1:30:37] breastplate and when the holy spirit
[1:30:39] comes upon those stones it sparkles
[1:30:42] and he says
[1:30:43] you're our accepted son
[1:30:45] you're an accepted priest you are a king
[1:30:47] and a priest and when god flashes his
[1:30:50] lighter on you
[1:30:52] the enemy sees that and he backs off
[1:30:55] because god has accepted his priest
[1:30:58] and his king
[1:30:59] you are a king sister you're a priest
[1:31:01] sister
[1:31:03] did you know that
[1:31:04] amen you you're in the priesthood by the
[1:31:07] baptism
[1:31:09] nobody can take that away from you
[1:31:12] you don't have to preach
[1:31:14] your very walk is a sermon
[1:31:16] the way you talk is a silence your
[1:31:19] children recognize you that you are
[1:31:22] praised in the kingdom of god united
[1:31:25] with the son of god and there's nothing
[1:31:28] they can say against you because you
[1:31:30] know who you are you know where you come
[1:31:32] from and you know where you're going to
[1:31:35] because the bible says we are not blind
[1:31:37] that we can see who our make and creator
[1:31:41] is
[1:31:43] lord jesus amen he's not the third
[1:31:44] person
[1:31:46] hallelujah
[1:31:48] i'm so happy
[1:31:49] i promise you that we are going to not
[1:31:52] be too long
[1:31:54] let's read this quote
[1:31:57] behold i send my messenger before thy
[1:31:59] face we shall prepare thy way before
[1:32:03] thee very i say unto you among them that
[1:32:05] are born of women they are not risen or
[1:32:07] greater than john the baptist
[1:32:09] not withstanding
[1:32:11] amen he that is the least in the kingdom
[1:32:15] just a brother
[1:32:17] student the least in the kingdom is
[1:32:19] greater than he
[1:32:21] amen john you're so great but there's
[1:32:24] somebody in the benches here that's
[1:32:25] sitting here that's greater than john
[1:32:28] hallelujah
[1:32:30] you are greater than john because you
[1:32:32] still esteem yourself the least in the
[1:32:34] kingdom
[1:32:36] but you are in the kingdom how do you
[1:32:37] get in the kingdom on the baptism of the
[1:32:39] holy ghost
[1:32:40] how did you get the holy ghost because
[1:32:41] god accepted your faith that you added
[1:32:44] to
[1:32:45] virgin knowledge temple inspirations etc
[1:32:47] etc when god sees your faith working
[1:32:50] he accepts you
[1:32:52] and he kept you
[1:32:54] hallelujah when you go to university you
[1:32:57] are capped
[1:32:58] after
[1:33:00] you have done what you had to do you
[1:33:03] have passed this you have gone through
[1:33:06] that you are you are temperamental amen
[1:33:09] but then god comes with temperance you
[1:33:11] know what temperance is i've said this
[1:33:13] once before temperance
[1:33:15] is when you have this uh especially on
[1:33:18] the side of the cars you find that it's
[1:33:20] shatter proof in the front and it's
[1:33:22] it's
[1:33:23] it's not shatterproof but it's armor
[1:33:25] plate on the side
[1:33:27] how shatterproof
[1:33:28] is that when you hit a stone against it
[1:33:31] because of the plastic between two
[1:33:33] pieces of glass
[1:33:35] it will just shatter and it will crack
[1:33:37] this way and crack that way this way
[1:33:39] that way depending on where the crack
[1:33:41] leads
[1:33:42] but with armor plate on the side of the
[1:33:44] car
[1:33:45] especially at the back
[1:33:46] you find other plate
[1:33:49] cannot be you can't heat it with your
[1:33:51] fist
[1:33:52] and sometimes you throw a brick against
[1:33:54] it the brick bounces back you find many
[1:33:57] times where people want to rob you in
[1:33:59] the street like a traffic light they
[1:34:01] will throw a brick against the armor
[1:34:02] plate and it will just bounce back into
[1:34:05] their face and they're thinking about
[1:34:06] what's happening with this glass it's
[1:34:09] glass no it's not
[1:34:11] it's tempered
[1:34:14] tempered glass means
[1:34:16] that there's a force that brings a glass
[1:34:19] together to the extent the heat that it
[1:34:22] goes through it tempers the glass
[1:34:25] hey man
[1:34:26] it becomes tempered
[1:34:28] in a sense that
[1:34:30] when you heat it with a sharp object
[1:34:33] you break the temperance of the glass
[1:34:36] and the whole glass every bead will
[1:34:39] shatter through the glass and every inch
[1:34:42] of the glass will have a little crack
[1:34:45] and a bead that when you push your
[1:34:47] finger through that window it will just
[1:34:50] it will just start to break because the
[1:34:52] temperance of that glass has now been
[1:34:56] released
[1:34:58] it was kept together how is how are you
[1:35:01] kept together by the word of god
[1:35:04] heat
[1:35:04] you are treated with hate with fire and
[1:35:07] the holy ghost it tempers you
[1:35:10] and that's what temperance in the
[1:35:12] pyramid means that the prophet drew you
[1:35:14] are tempered by the word of god
[1:35:17] and then when anything strikes you
[1:35:20] you just hold your temple
[1:35:23] you are tempted
[1:35:24] nothing goes against it amen let the
[1:35:27] enemy throw a stone it can't penetrate
[1:35:30] that because it's tempted
[1:35:33] when your wife angers you you are
[1:35:35] tempered
[1:35:37] you don't shatter
[1:35:38] when your husband comes against you
[1:35:41] why are you going to church again this
[1:35:43] morning you've been to church so many
[1:35:45] times watch that you were holier than
[1:35:47] loud then your temper holds
[1:35:49] you can't shatter
[1:35:51] by your husband's temperament or your
[1:35:54] wife's temper or your child or your
[1:35:55] teacher or your boss
[1:35:57] nothing shatters your temper
[1:36:00] because you are put together
[1:36:02] piece by piece
[1:36:04] heat treated
[1:36:06] put together
[1:36:08] and you are tempted by the holy spirit
[1:36:11] fire and the holy ghost same thing amen
[1:36:15] the holy ghost and fire
[1:36:18] tempest you together amen
[1:36:21] you are sealed
[1:36:23] by the holy ghost
[1:36:25] until
[1:36:27] the world ends
[1:36:29] god don't see me today to lose you
[1:36:32] tomorrow
[1:36:34] and that's why i'm going to skip many
[1:36:35] things
[1:36:40] much is known about
[1:36:42] the seals
[1:36:45] on roman wolves
[1:36:47] when you have anybody have a world you
[1:36:49] know what a world is it gets a notoriety
[1:36:52] stamp
[1:36:53] and it says
[1:36:55] this
[1:36:56] notoriety lawyer from pronouncing it
[1:36:59] right
[1:37:00] has said that
[1:37:02] whatever oath is inside this world is
[1:37:05] sealed
[1:37:07] with a stair
[1:37:10] i've heard what he has to say
[1:37:12] he's agreed solemnly to the oath
[1:37:15] and i place my sail upon this
[1:37:18] it's settled and whoever reads it
[1:37:22] has to perform
[1:37:23] the words written there
[1:37:26] oh my god
[1:37:29] it's only saying that
[1:37:33] my amen
[1:37:35] i just press my knot
[1:37:38] away
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:45] so let's let's see what the seals are
[1:37:48] all about amen
[1:37:54] now remember what the prophet says about
[1:37:56] the seals
[1:37:59] he says that the seventh long closing
[1:38:02] amen so
[1:38:03] give me about 10 minutes
[1:38:07] it's only 11 53 now i know
[1:38:18] the prophet says that
[1:38:21] the seventh seal now listen carefully
[1:38:24] before you say amen
[1:38:25] it's not open
[1:38:28] hallelujah but then we see
[1:38:32] that the prophet himself says that the
[1:38:35] seventh cell is the coming of the lord
[1:38:40] oh yes
[1:38:42] so now
[1:38:44] has he come
[1:38:46] now remember what many people are doing
[1:38:48] in the message
[1:38:49] they said he has come and that means
[1:38:52] we listen to the book of corinthians
[1:38:54] where paul says
[1:38:56] when he has come we do we do the
[1:38:59] communion until he comes so
[1:39:02] if he has come then we don't have to do
[1:39:04] communion no more so as long as you are
[1:39:06] having communion you are saying he
[1:39:08] hasn't come
[1:39:11] but you have to be careful when you
[1:39:12] start to say he hasn't come when he has
[1:39:15] gone
[1:39:16] amen and don't say
[1:39:19] uh
[1:39:21] he's come and is gone because if he's
[1:39:23] come we must see him corporally
[1:39:26] do you know that we must see jesus
[1:39:29] corporally amen when he comes yes he's
[1:39:31] not coming as the holy spirit he's
[1:39:34] coming as a man
[1:39:37] a human being like he
[1:39:39] made himself known to the disciples
[1:39:42] he says handle me
[1:39:44] hallelujah and that's the way
[1:39:47] we will handle jesus when he comes the
[1:39:50] second time for the bride
[1:39:53] we are not talking for the world now
[1:39:55] because he will identify himself he will
[1:39:58] unite himself to the jews
[1:40:01] but listen to this
[1:40:02] he has come for the bride
[1:40:06] as
[1:40:07] the son of man now we have to identify
[1:40:10] where the son of man appeared
[1:40:12] he appeared in a son of man which was a
[1:40:16] son of man means prophet the son of man
[1:40:18] is holy ghost
[1:40:20] the son of god amen because that's how
[1:40:24] he could only come with this prophet he
[1:40:26] could come as the holy ghost he couldn't
[1:40:28] come any other way because that's what
[1:40:30] he promised he came as
[1:40:33] the son of god as the son of man why
[1:40:37] because he discerned the hearts the
[1:40:39] intents of the hearts of the people
[1:40:43] the same way jesus as the son of man
[1:40:46] identified himself to the samaritan
[1:40:49] woman who were samaritans and to the
[1:40:52] jews when he said before you were under
[1:40:55] the fig tree i saw you
[1:40:58] amen he said thou art the son of god
[1:41:02] but there he was in flesh and he was
[1:41:04] called by nathaniel the son of god god
[1:41:07] the son of god
[1:41:09] and we find that when the samaritan
[1:41:11] woman identified him and he said
[1:41:14] of the prophet he said you know our
[1:41:18] father's worshipped here
[1:41:20] and
[1:41:21] are you are you greater than
[1:41:24] jacob
[1:41:25] he said you know
[1:41:27] the time is going to come when two
[1:41:29] worshipers will not worship me
[1:41:32] uh here in this in this place but they
[1:41:35] will worship me in spirit and truth amen
[1:41:38] because god seeks such to worship people
[1:41:41] spirit and truth don't worship him
[1:41:43] because you're just a christian call
[1:41:45] yourself christian church church member
[1:41:48] amen uh pastor adrian he's my pastor no
[1:41:52] what about you
[1:41:52] [Music]
[1:41:54] pastor adrian has got the holy ghost you
[1:41:56] all believe that what about you hey man
[1:41:58] you're just not a christian you're
[1:42:00] sitting a few you're a priest you have
[1:42:02] to exercise your priesthood out there
[1:42:06] and out there everywhere you are
[1:42:08] you have to shine the light where it's
[1:42:10] dark amen
[1:42:12] hallelujah
[1:42:14] so we find ourselves in that state where
[1:42:18] son of man
[1:42:20] is revealed
[1:42:22] the son of man is revealed
[1:42:25] as the holy ghost in a prophet and he
[1:42:28] comes he said your name is such and such
[1:42:31] and such and such you live in such and
[1:42:33] such go home and be healed
[1:42:35] in the name of the lord jesus christ go
[1:42:37] home and do well
[1:42:39] hallelujah what was that it was the
[1:42:42] former rain
[1:42:44] falling
[1:42:45] with the latter rain
[1:42:47] remember there's a promise coming the
[1:42:49] latter rain and the former rain will
[1:42:51] fall together
[1:42:53] now we said we're gonna dive sometime so
[1:42:55] we're diving now keep on the spiritual
[1:42:57] thinking camp don't sleep now
[1:43:00] did somebody say amen amen can you say
[1:43:02] that again amen can you say it one more
[1:43:04] time amen
[1:43:05] hallelujah
[1:43:07] so now we find that the son of man
[1:43:11] was being revealed in a prophet because
[1:43:14] it was promised that
[1:43:16] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:43:18] begins to sound the mystery of god is
[1:43:20] revealed so here was the mystery of god
[1:43:23] on a platform in a prophet
[1:43:26] coming and he said you know he's
[1:43:28] standing about a few feet away from me
[1:43:31] hallelujah now the angel was there and
[1:43:33] all of a sudden there's a light
[1:43:36] and he said you
[1:43:37] your brother your name is so-and-so
[1:43:40] you've got on the left side of your lung
[1:43:43] uh the doctor was looking at it through
[1:43:45] this that in the other and thus saith
[1:43:47] the lord go home and be well
[1:43:49] what was that former rain falling
[1:43:53] now
[1:43:53] it was falling together he was doing the
[1:43:56] discernment
[1:43:57] and he was telling him you are healed
[1:44:00] lettering
[1:44:01] the former and the lettering falling
[1:44:03] together
[1:44:05] glory to god
[1:44:06] so you was the son of man revealing
[1:44:09] himself
[1:44:11] he has come
[1:44:12] and he's coming
[1:44:14] so we don't stop communion because we
[1:44:16] know he's coming in a corporate body but
[1:44:18] he was here as he said now what does the
[1:44:20] bride say about william branham no man
[1:44:23] born of human greater than william
[1:44:24] branham but the least in the kingdom is
[1:44:26] greater than he
[1:44:29] so there we have it former and literary
[1:44:31] folly together he has come the seventh
[1:44:33] seal is open
[1:44:35] and when it opens when a woman gives
[1:44:38] birth it just closes to the public the
[1:44:40] public doesn't see it but you are sealed
[1:44:42] in
[1:44:43] they ask you allowed as it was in the
[1:44:45] days of noah so shall it be in the days
[1:44:48] of the coming of the son of man when
[1:44:51] they were eating and drinking
[1:44:53] they didn't see the rain come but no
[1:44:55] before one dropped foul saw the rain
[1:44:58] come and he said it's gonna rain it's
[1:45:01] going to rain
[1:45:02] hallelujah we are going up beyond the
[1:45:04] friends we are going in the rapture
[1:45:06] although i'm dead my body might be death
[1:45:10] i'm going to be resurrected
[1:45:13] in a twinkling of an eye hallelujah it's
[1:45:16] not going to be a wink a wink is when
[1:45:19] you know you're sitting across a table
[1:45:22] and you see this nice guy on the other
[1:45:23] side and he winks at you you know like
[1:45:27] like that our man
[1:45:29] and you blush
[1:45:31] but you know there won't be time to
[1:45:33] blush when he comes amen
[1:45:35] it's not going to be a wink it's going
[1:45:37] to it's going to be a twinkle
[1:45:40] hallelujah a twinkle is so fast
[1:45:43] that you can see movement you can stop
[1:45:46] movement hey man
[1:45:48] if you have a twinkle that a fan blowing
[1:45:50] in your room and you twinkle at that fan
[1:45:53] it looks like the fan kind of stops in
[1:45:55] the moment
[1:45:56] and life on this earth will stop in a
[1:46:00] moment when you twinkle yourself out of
[1:46:02] this world
[1:46:03] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:46:06] your body is change hallelujah and i
[1:46:09] believe when this body changes you can
[1:46:12] eat anything you want to you can create
[1:46:14] a mcdonald's burger if you want to you
[1:46:16] can create a
[1:46:18] kentucky fried chicken doesn't matter
[1:46:20] what 12 herbs and spices
[1:46:25] hallelujah so that means you are now
[1:46:28] that creator
[1:46:30] like god you are a head
[1:46:32] amen
[1:46:34] and that's why
[1:46:35] now
[1:46:36] we can create another world but god has
[1:46:38] got laws in place that you can't do what
[1:46:41] you want to do but you know you can amen
[1:46:44] that's why we can exercise our faith on
[1:46:47] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:46:49] standard which is you sister which is
[1:46:52] you brother which is your preacher the
[1:46:54] standard of god is raised up against it
[1:46:57] so be against the power of the devil and
[1:47:00] satan come out and leave this house
[1:47:03] leave this video leave this bathroom
[1:47:06] leave
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:21] and your thing you know what god is
[1:47:23] saying amen that's why god says don't be
[1:47:25] afraid when they take you to the judges
[1:47:27] in the courts but just speak amen
[1:47:30] because only you speaking it will be the
[1:47:32] holy ghost
[1:47:34] you will have words that they won't even
[1:47:36] be able to
[1:47:38] understand
[1:47:39] how do they get this word this unlearned
[1:47:41] man doesn't have anything in his name
[1:47:45] he's never been a day in school but yet
[1:47:47] when he speaks
[1:47:48] we just have to listen
[1:47:50] we can't again say what he says because
[1:47:52] he's saying what god is speaking amen oh
[1:47:55] yes
[1:47:57] so now we see these seals
[1:48:00] all the seals has been opened but it
[1:48:02] will be close to a lot of people
[1:48:05] the reason why is because of the
[1:48:06] unbelief
[1:48:07] the ark was closed to many people
[1:48:09] because of the unbelief but there were
[1:48:11] animals that went in some animals
[1:48:14] couldn't go in because
[1:48:15] they didn't
[1:48:16] believe there were some people that
[1:48:19] didn't go in because they didn't believe
[1:48:21] and when the door was shut they wanted
[1:48:22] to come in afterwards but then
[1:48:25] afterwards means that tribulation is
[1:48:27] setting the rain is starting to fall and
[1:48:29] that's what happens with you outside the
[1:48:31] holy ghost outside the bride of christ
[1:48:34] you go to the tribulation so that you
[1:48:36] can get the fire on you so that you can
[1:48:39] sleep for a thousand years come up in
[1:48:41] the judgment the judgment throne and
[1:48:44] then you'll be separated as a sheep or a
[1:48:46] goat and depart from me you workers of
[1:48:48] iniquity on the left you goat but to you
[1:48:51] sheep enter in
[1:48:54] the joys of the lord amen amen
[1:48:57] now where did they get to joy when they
[1:48:59] died
[1:49:01] with their own blood in the tribulation
[1:49:03] because they rejected the holy ghost
[1:49:06] they rejected the life in the blood this
[1:49:08] side so they had to cross over
[1:49:11] and go into the tribulation die with
[1:49:14] their own blood come up
[1:49:16] pass the millennium in the judgment seat
[1:49:19] and then be counted as a sheep
[1:49:21] where's the bride sitting in the throne
[1:49:23] of justice
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:25] and the eyes
[1:49:27] of the lamb is right around it
[1:49:29] you can't escape me
[1:49:31] i know what you've done to me
[1:49:33] i've known what you've done to my wife
[1:49:36] i know what you've done to my daughter
[1:49:38] and my my brother and my sister i know
[1:49:40] what you've done because my eye will be
[1:49:43] on the lamb's head
[1:49:45] right around the head of the land
[1:49:47] your eye is dead
[1:49:49] you are a witness you the bride
[1:49:52] you're baptized by the holy ghost this
[1:49:53] side before the tribulation system as
