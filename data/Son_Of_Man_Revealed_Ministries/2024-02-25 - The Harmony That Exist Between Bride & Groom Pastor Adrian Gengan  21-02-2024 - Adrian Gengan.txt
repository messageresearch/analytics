TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with much Thanksgiving amen amen I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's good to be found in the house of the Lord to worship Him amen especially in a time and season like this amen we ought to be gathered together with Believers of light precious Faith amen we can find no common ground with anyone else yes but C genene must connect with C gen amen life must connect with life amen and the body is fly framed together Hallelujah so everybody feeling good amen hallelujah we know we are the sons and daughters of the most high God and we have Zoe life within us amen then we oughtn't be down and gloomy one day and up another day amen but we should be full of the glory of God Amen let's turn to St John chapter 5 amen praise the Lord hallelujah we find that the Lord will keep certain things for certain seasons and if you remember brother Brandon when he's preaching that seventh seal he says as light is needed it will be given amen and we can start to see that coming out now amen as light is needed it is coming to the body amen as she needs that perfect Faith it's coming to the body amen so we just want to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit we don't want to be disconnected from the Holy Spirit when he says move we move amen when he says keep quiet we keep quiet amen hallelujah so St John 5 and verse 19 amen praise the Lord you see here the scripture reads then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do amen for what things soever he doth these also doeth the son likewise amen so we see Jesus had the mind of the father and he's telling us the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth that also doeth the son likewise so he was depending on the father leading him he was depending on leadership amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen praise the Lord amen he's certainly worthy to be praised amen he's worthy to be adored amen i' like take a little thought a title called the harmony the Aron this harmony is now to exist between the groom and the bride amen what we reading here St John 5:19 then we see it's it's not just a statement Jesus made but he is basically showing you in type how the groom operated the bride will operate amen amen hallelujah so we know that we were locked up as he thought in Elohim amen and as long as Elohim kept it locked in his mind we could never come to expression amen but we were expressed how through the logos what is the logos the word we know the word was made flesh so we were locked up in the logos amen and we find that the lordos kept it a hidden Mystery but it was revealed in Ty through Adam and Eve amen but here at the end time now when Christ is on the cross he unveils the plan when he stri when they strike his side and out comes the body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the lord it's in the Sunday fold of brother Joshua amen I just copied it and paste it there in the Sunday folder I've got a little flyer there just the inspiration for next week service meetings I want to put it up and announce the service amen just lead trusting the Lord for the details of the service amen so next week Wednesday we will have a service amen our normal service but it'll be under special inspiration have you got the picture brother Joshua hallelujah amen amen so that'll be our inspiration for next week wedness day amen we all know what happened on the 28th of February 1963 amen amen so it's called The Cloud of Glory amen hallelujah and Revelation 101 the prophet says if the vision is scriptural it must be interpreted by a scriptural by the scripture so being a scriptural prophet he went to the scripture and the Lord took him to Revelation 10 to interpret the vision amen hallelujah amen and a vision will not fail yes write the vision amen though it car wait for it yes it shall come to pass amen amen so he saw this Vision 6 months anyway we're going into next week's service we need to keep quiet and and wait for next week's service but that's the inspiration I want you to pray for the service amen because the Lord will do Mighty things amen so it's a commemoration of that day you know that it remains a mystery secret to the world but to us it's not a secret so therefore we can celebrate it amen The Cloud of Glory when his glory came down am amen amen a mystery to the world but to us the coming glory amen praise the Lord amen so here the prophet would say amen after reading that scripture we go to a quote here in the church AG book so he's talking about the harmony between the Father and Jesus now it picks it up in the church AG book and this is coming from a letter to the church pick up your pen and write Holy Spirit inspires the prophet tells him pick up your pen and write and in the secret letter to the bride he is writing the statement he says notice the armony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5:19 amen then he says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his [Music] bride that means we can't think our own thoughts we can't do what we want in this life amen we are not Latos gogs amen but we here to do the will of the father amen we are on assignment amen we are on commission amen how much more so under Revelation 10 under commission thou must prophesy again amen so the armony is now to exist between the groom and his bride by God's grace amen are you a part of the Bride this evening amen we are fly framed then the armony must now exist between the bride and the groom now what will the armony look like they will be in one Accord because any marriage way to work for that Union to work they must be in harmony they must be synchronized that's what the word harmony means to be in one Accord to be synchronized to be in agreement because how can two walk together L they be agreed amen imagine if we are walking according to the dictat of our own Arts here in this late end of this latest year Church age but Christ wants to fully manifest himself through his bride that would be a scene like Queen uh queen vasti and king acerus wanting to show the glory through the bride but she's not interested pursuing her own plans her own agenda amen church is just a thing that we do once a week or twice a week it's not a lifestyle that's what that vasy is amen but the body and the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ every day amen she's in harmony with the Lord Jesus Christ Christ amen she knows that it's not her doing the works but it is him through her so yes what the amony will look like the quote continues he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it oh yes that's what Armon looks like amen she never doubts it amen hallelujah now when we are reading this I want you to contrast this with Omega Eve she was shown the word of life initially she received it but then she doubted it but this amen this uh sorry that's the alpab bride this Omega bride she receives the word of life and she never doubts it the prophet goes on to say the members now this ought to Rejoice of our hearts because we are the members of the Virgin bride amen we are the members of the Virgin bride he says the members of the Virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials amen have you read in the Bible Jesus potentials he is saying the bride will have his potentials amen that's his abilities his capabilities his promises for what he is their head and all power belongs to him amen they are subject to him now that's the Ephesians 5 subjection why been subjection they are subject to him as members of our bodies are subject to our head now here he goes on to say therefore you see when we in armony with the with Jesus he says nothing can armor nothing can harm you in this hour amen hallelujah even though 200 million demons are let loose upon the Earth H is following that fourth Rider nothing shall harm you amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah not even death so don't be afraid of death death can't harm you death will change your Dwelling Place death will move move you into your theophonic body amen hallelujah we know what is Promised for us amen because there was a man here who could turn on the light amen he took the light amen he took the darkness of death and he Shone light upon death he took the light amen he took the darkness of what happens after death he went beyond the curtain of time and he Shone light yes amen come on now I want you to think from your Spirit man The Original Seed man the gene man I'm preaching to this evening amen he took light he took light and he Shone it upon your dimensional bodies amen that you can be here in a threedimensional world but he Shone light in the six-dimensional world and he shows you that there's another dimension of your body laying there in that Dimension so you're a dimensional being amen hallelujah and one of these days God is going to connect those two bodies those two Dimensions to make it a glorified body amen can somebody give God praise amen hallelujah amen nothing can armor not even death he says here is the secret of it the word is in the bride amen don't let Satan tell you you're good for nothing that you don't have the word if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ the word is in the bride as it was in Mary Amen Hallelujah Lord amen praise the Lord the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word amen so Mary Mary could have been the Mechanics for many years yes she was the Mechanics for many years amen but one day she had to make that word live amen amen she was reading Isaiah 9 for many years a virgin shall conceive she was part of the Dynamics amen quoting the word quoting the word quoting the word but in the right season Amen in the season of manifestation when that promise has to come to pass amen that Dynamics has to to strike the mechanics yes amen amen and the Dynamics came to the mechanics I hope you can see it there amen hallelujah the angel of God the Holy Spirit came in the form of Gabriel and said Mary thou are favored highly favorite amongst all women hallelujah amen oh some of you may be getting shocked amen I'm telling you the angel of the holy spirit in the form of the angel of God came to the mechanics amen the Dynamics came to the mechanics to Quicken the word that was in maryah and she said be unto me according to Thy word what did she do she began to give fuel for the Dynamics to be able to work you remember the prophet says you need that fuel he says if there's no gas in there there's no good by Mary's acceptance to the Angel's message she began to fuel and cause a spark to germinate so that the Holy Ghost could overshadow Mary and bring the Word of Life to pass somebody give God praise amen thank you amen amen amen what is the mind of Christ you ask we got to cross to another message very quickly and the world is again falling apart the prophet says if the mind of Christ is in us then we will recognize that word to be the truth amen and it lives right through US amen denominations do not accept this message there's only one group of people that allows this message this word that recognizes this word he says if you recognize this word that's the mind of coming to the church amen thank you Lord thank you Lord amen can it be more pler than that he says if the mind of Christ is in us then we will recognize that word to be the truth let me tell you something little iglet you didn't recognize the truth you didn't recognize William bram's message to be the truth because of association with your father of association with your mother of association with any Earthly man you recognized Malachi 4 message to be the truth because you had representation on the inside of you you are always an eagle amen you are always a gene of God Amen Hallelujah that's just God's grace upon your life that maybe you were born in a message home maybe you were born Amen in a Christian home and God allowed that Grace upon your life amen but not everyone was afforded that opportunity summer came amen hallelujah amen but all of us came amen born in sin shaped in iniquity came into this world speaking lies hallelujah amen in fact in this in this life itself we have dimensions of our bodies amen hallelujah first we come in a fallen body born in the world in a fallen body as innocent as a baby locates a fallen State Hallelujah sons of Adam are Fallen amen hallelujah sons of Adam cannot redeem themselves Redemption is only in Jesus Christ amen therefore every son of Adam that is born must be born again yes hallelujah amen amen Jesus said you must be born again amen amen and only seed can be reborn Hallelujah that's why not everyone can receive the message of the hour you got to have the SE Gene of God within you Amen to be able to germatize in this time in this season yes this time the Holy Ghost is outpouring itself like no other time in history amen hallelujah oh I don't think you're hearing me amen at the fullness of the word at the fullness of the opening of the word the Holy Ghost is outpouring itself in a greater measure amen one like the world has never seen yes we are a continuation of the book of Acts but only if you know when something continues it gets greater it gets better it gets more Dynamic hallelujah hallelujah God don't go backwards if we're a continuation of the book of Acts that's why he calls us a super church that's why he calls us a super race amen somebody give God praise amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen this church is on fire amen look at what she does she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord amen yes I want you to settle in your heart you have thus sayith the Lord when you have the message of the hour you have thus sa the Lord when you become the manifested word of Revelation 108-111 you are thus say the Lord thank you thank you Lord yeah what he says then the word is quickened by the spirit now what is the spirit the Dynamics so the mechanics is quickened by the Dynamics that what he's saying here Dynamics upon the mechanics Holy Spirit upon the word bride oh hallelujah amen that's why in this time in this season amen it's we can't live without the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost is our source of life amen the Holy Ghost is a spirit of Truth the holy spirit is our guide amen praise the Lord thank you Lord amen he says like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will I'm trying to show you the harmony the harmony between groom and and the bridegroom now the bride and the groom no one can make them do otherwise amen you know Satan is a fool he comes to your Fallen body which is not yet redeemed and he tries to make you fall by your Fallen body he can't make you fall in your soul amen thank you so he gets you focused on your mistakes he gets you focused on your faults he gets you focused on the flesh man amen and then you get down in your spirit and once you get down in your spirit what happens you allow doubt to settle in amen but you got to recognize amen the tactics of the devil amen you don't look to your mistakes you don't look to your faults you you look to the finished work of the blood they know amen he says here enough no one can make them do otherwise they have thus say the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works you see this is not the time and season for man St this is not the time and season they know it's God in them doing the works amen fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride yes amen oh come on are you reading this am this is the prophet of God speaking to you yes which other Prophet can tell you this which are the Expositor of the word can tell you this that he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride amen yes amen they know okay she knows that for it was not your time for him to do certain things that he must do now you see even when brother Brandon was opening that seven seal he knew it wasn't yet time so he says I mustn't say anything more and he says as light is needed it will be given amen now I asked you if light is going to come to the church and the body who is it going to come by amen amen we know it's coming through the Holy Spirit right but the holy spirit is walking through Ephesians 4 that's right amen you can get no light in this time in this season except it come via the fivefold ministry right now you see the attack on the fivefold ministry now you see the attack on silencing that five-fold Ministry because it knows it is time now that light is needed so they're trying to shut up the fivefold ministry how many of you have seen the revelation of William Brandon's message grow greater because of the fivefold ministry amen am I've seen it amen I'm a recipient of the fold ministry glory to his name amen amen amen praise the Lord amen so not yet time for him to do certain things so God works according to times and Seasons but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time yes so beyond expectation because when he calls me I will answer when he calls me I will answer yes he calls you Amen to operate same amen Mark 16 he calls you Amen to lay hands upon the sick he calls you to anoint them that are sick amen with oil he calls you to speak the word amen in your time of need thank you here in this message the prophet is saying now he's taking types and shadows if we can see what Jesus was in the New Testament we'll see what Jesus is working amongst us in the last days we're looking for the armony right that's what we focused on so we're looking at the type to see how he operate then he will work the same because he's Hebrews 138 yes now here's a very important one not all together work Jesus working in me William brandom you hear what the prophet is saying what are what are what are some people saying that he's only working through him right remember now they trying to silence the voice of the fivefold and they saying he's only working through them here what the prophet is saying not allog together Jesus working in me he works in you just the same as he works in me amen anybody that's born again I I may be able to see visions and you may not but that doesn't mean that he's not with you he's with you just the same amen watch now he talks about the prophet and the King here he was just the same with zekiah as he was with Isaiah but Isaiah ezekiah was the one who got the blessing not Isaiah asaiah just took the word it wasn't Isaiah's praise that was heard it was ezekiah highest praise that was heard so you see when the five Ministry is preaching sometimes it seems like the people are more blessed because one is just bringing the word but the one that's catching the word amen he's able to operate the word than amen praise the Lord so yeah he's saying when when he passed by the pool talking about saying John 5 then now he seen all the people he healed a man and the Jews questioned him I can't do nothing whatever the father does he shows me and then I go do that that's true in St John 5:19 and we notice in Jesus he was a kind man he was a humble man yet he was a man of power when he spoke he was very humble and gentle but when it come time to separate between truth and error Jesus was very Stern picked up some ropes and tied them together and kicked over the money charges table and beat them out of the temple called the Pharisees those religious people while you bunch of Hypocrites you serpents Snakes in the Grass and all these things he was a man who could speak when it come time to speak he was a man who was full of love but he loved his father so much till he stayed in harmony with his father and anything that interfered with that Harmony then Jesus draw the line amen amen anything that comes to interrupt our Harmony between us and Jesus we draug line we don't compromise with the word amen we treasure the harmony between groom and bride praise the lord well that would be the same man today he's here he will let you do things and so forth like that but when you go to sinning and go like that then however the line will be drawn you see so Jesus is going to preserve the armony as well Jesus is going to bring his wife under subjection if she goes out of line that's what he's trying to tell you now listen something will come down and then stop it and say look here just a minute is that right sure he does he chastens his children chastens them I believe he does and the Bible says they are brought upon us to try our faith amen now if you're sick tonight and something might have happened along the road and you sinned or something another ask God to forgive you amen Maybe you've been a little Dil Tre and you say well I never went out and got drunk you see people perceive sin to be a certain thing you don't have to get drunk to sin just disbelief that's sin [Music] unbelief amen praise the Lord now the prophet is going to speak in plain language these are his words he's saying in very PL plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God etern though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season you know what a special thought we must have been then if he kept us for the End Amen you know the only keep us bold for the end they keep the best for the End Amen yes hallelujah amen and though she is feminine okay and as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride literal spoken word seed bride you know what he's saying he spoke you to come in this time and season how if you carting catching the heart of this amen what does it mean to be the spoken word seed bride oh yes Lord God spoke you to come in this time and season amen like he spoke and said let there be he spoke you to come in this time and season and though she is feminine in designation she's also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source that's what we were dealing with on Sunday came from the same Source came from the same material amen was eternal with him oh Hallelujah that's why you can't end me because I'm Eternal with him I come from the same Source I share the same DNA amen amen hallelujah yes I have God particles in me oh thank you Lord thank you Lord and He now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest In the Flesh thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many member spoken word seed amen manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called amen so what are we amen I if you want strong meat than we are the Holy Ghost manifest amen okay amen somebody the bone there the holy ghost is a spirit oh yes so God was if we read that you just studyed this quote when you go home yes he's showing you how God came from Spirit to word to flesh but he needed a body in order to express himself through flesh so the Holy Spirit which is a part of the Trinity if you know what I mean those three are one the holy spirit in this time and season in order for him to be fully expressed he needs bodies yes amen so when I'm looking at you Holy Ghost people I'm looking at manifested Holy Ghost this revelation will get stronger amen if if you can get the true revelation of who she is [Music] amen because the Holy Ghost fully expressed in Jesus made him what amen true the Holy Ghost fully expressed in Jesus made him what hey maybe I should just preach the ministers tonight amen come on Amen strong meat belong to them which are of full age that's matured people amen let me get by that amen hallelujah praise the Lord remember what I've been telling you all this time your original spirit is the holy spirit that's what you fell away from so God in order to make you come back to his image and likeness has to send forth the original spirit amen therefore you have to be baptized with the holy spirit amen to regain your original Spirit oh yes hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen amen amen don't die with the lights amen but be revived in his presence amen hallelujah we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seen and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn yes are you hearing what the prophet is saying only a certain class of people can be reborn in this hour you have to be Original Seed we did not become seed because we were born again we were born again because we were Original Seed yes amen because we were seed is the reason we can could be quickened in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken amen praise the Lord all of this will be Lost in Translation amen they're switching everything off I don't hear the generator on is yet amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen how many of you are sealing the mystery become more clear yes amen amen that the Holy Ghost is not a sensation the Holy Ghost amen is not restoration of the gifts but the Holy Ghost is actually a hidden Mystery for this hour that when it comes upon the believer oh yes that's why he says your Tabernacle your Tabernacle deity right amen amen amen amen the Lord is going to make the revelation of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost more clear amen what I'm trying to drop into your seeds right now amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we did not come become SE by the rebirth when Jesus said you must be born again we didn't become the seed then that's what he's saying we were the seed therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non there's nothing to Quicken thank you Lord thank you Lord he says all this carefully in mind now to take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner yes God by his death the shed blood brought back his own he brought back the spoken word seed bride amen redeemed our love to Proclaim it amen yes and we were in the thoughts of God then expressed in flesh and there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are sons of God Amen we heard his voice and we cried out as did The Prodigal Son save me oh my father I am returning to thee a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a Son of God in fact a lot of true Christians are like the story of the baby eagle that was etched out under a end you know that the eagle is a type of the True Believer when a farmer took an egg from the Eagle's Nest placed it under a end in due time all the eggs under the end etched out the baby cheeks got along fly with the mother end but the little eagle could not figure out the clacking and scratching for food in the manual pile he managed to make a living but he was pretty confused about it all so you had a 15-year-old eaglet sitting there in the denominations hey brother jaff was telling me he came to the convention Easter convention and he said even though he had responsibilities he was a Sunday school leader he didn't even resign from his position in fact he never went back to the chicken yard he just flew amen now what would make a 15-year-old do that what is he saying here a true Son of God can go for years amen but when he hears that eagle scream and then an eagle scream Child come out of her amen praise the Lord but one day way up in the air the mother Eagle that had laid that egg spyed that little Eagle on the ground she swooped down with tremendous speed and screamed at the top of her voice for him to fly up to Meer now you didn't realize that what was happening Mama Eagle came to the convention brother Joshua and told him now you are in the church Mama Eagle came to you in your time and Seas him amen he had never heard an eagle cry but when he heard that first scream something in him stirred and he longed to launch out toward it amen the chickens were screaming false prophet the chickens were screaming stay away from it chickens were screaming C amen but something there was a deep inside of you amen hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen hallelujah praise the Lord he screamed back amen hallelujah you got to call back out to Mama amen he screamed back that he was afraid once more she called out screaming that he Tred beating his wings he h himself into the air and answering the Cry of the mother he sort off into the blue skies oh yes you see he was always an eagle he acted like a chicken for a while but he could not be satisfied but when he heard that call of that great Eagle he came to his own place and once he Son of God hears the Cry of the Spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet Eagle you see who he's typing that word the great prophet eagle and be with him forever seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen amen praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord oh isn't he worthy yes amen amen praise the Lord amen now talking about this Omega Eve the bride has the mind of Christ right we're closing now this Omega Eve will know how to operate the word amen amen am you will know how to operate the word why you haven't left the guide amen you are relying on the guide to teach you how to operate the word amen if do not know how to operate the word because she got away from her guide she got away from her teacher she got away from her Spirit of truth because the spirit of Truth was not around Adam was her guide Adam was a leader Adam was her spirit of truth but she got away from the original spirit amen she got away from the guide and she began to go out on her own grounds amen steep onto the grounds of unbelief she stepped onto the grounds of reasoning amen hallelujah without the guide and when she went on to reasoning she thought she could handle the word without the guide amen without the spirit of Truth yes but this eve this Omega Eve is not like Alpha Eve she stays with the guide amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen in the message God of this evil age you're going to have to type this up brother Joshua the God of this evil age paragraph 37 amen so Eve I'm talking to you I'm talking to you because right now you are the most powerful being on the face of the [Music] Earth you are a supernatural being empowered by the Holy Ghost quickened by the word amen we find now this evil age is to prove you see what the evil age is to do to prove something to prove to Satan she is not like Eve that she is not that type of a woman she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that is the same yesterday today and forever today but failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she's come in contact Again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word for in the beginning of the Bible man was given the word of God to live by one word misinterpreted a man called Satan in the person of an animal called The Serpent Satan in this person could talk to Eve you see what I'm trying to tell you Spirits possess bodies so if the Holy Ghost Is possessing a brother and the brother is speaking to you the word of God who is really speaking to you amen amen amen Satan in this person could talk to Eve and misinterpreted the word to her and was lost it must be every word in the middle of the Bible Jesus came and said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word where he was tempted by Satan God telling us here in the last days the God of this world will rise up in the last days and whosoever shall add one word to it or take one word from it his part will be taken from from The Book of Life I'm trying to show you the characteristic of this bride that she will be in harmony with the groom and she will not forsake one word One Dot one comma one aot [Music] amen Now Eve was United until she broke one word okay I think this is another message in the message Oneness Amen in the message Oneness paragraph 32 amen praise the Lord just give me 5 minutes we'll be done amen praise the Lord amen Now Eve was United until she broke one word remember our our thought the harmony that exist between the bride and the groom the harmony comes down to us keeping the word right now he was United until she broke one word or doubted one word being true that separated her every word man shall not live by bread alone but every word so we can be in God United because Adam and Eve before the fall before the disbelieving of the word was an example of what we could be in him so they held the mystery between Christ and the bride to be United with with him is life to be separated from him is death right now 33 he says we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but you see it's following his rules following what he said do stumbling and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it come on now brother stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he stumbled he'll get up again amen if he wobbles God pulls him right back into the path as long as he's in the part of Duty but if he's off the part of Duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the part of Duty God's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or a woman is obligated to that person as long as they in the part of Duty amen praise the Lord so so God is under obligation to you to not look at your human failures amen so how can we use excuses like I'm not perfect amen that I'm always making mistakes Lord is there something wrong with me you're looking at your human mistakes you you're living in a body that's not yet fully redeemed yes amen praise the Lord amen amen so the Omega if the Omega Eve will not leave the guide the Omega Eve in fact has a special promise in this day amen yes the Omega Eve in this day has been told that the guide will come to her amen after seven Church ages after the restoration of the gifts after the Holy Spirit even pouring himself out through Luke 17:30 through a one man scripture she's been given a promise that the guide will come to her amen yes the Omega he has the promise of the Holy Spirit refilling her
