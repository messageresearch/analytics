[0:00] for
[0:02] making me whole.
[0:06] I want to
[0:09] thank you
[0:12] Lord for
[0:14] giving to me.
[0:19] Thy grace
[0:23] salvation so
[0:27] full
[0:28] and free.
[0:32] Amen. Amen. Father, we thank you, Lord,
[0:34] that you can Father, thank you, Lord,
[0:36] because of what you've done, Father.
[0:38] Amen. Lord, we don't have words to
[0:40] describe how we feel in your presence.
[0:42] Yes, Lord. But Lord, we just lay
[0:44] ourselves in your presence, oh God.
[0:47] Thank you, Father. You know the secrets
[0:48] of the heart. And your word declares
[0:51] when we don't have the word, the Holy
[0:52] Ghost makes such on our behalf, oh God.
[0:55] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, even as we come
[0:57] now, Father, as obedient sons,
[0:59] submitting ourselves under your mighty
[1:00] hand, we pray, Lord, for our outpouring
[1:03] of your spirit, Lord Jesus. And Father,
[1:05] I pray, oh God, that you will position
[1:07] us, oh God. Amen. Father, I pray, Lord,
[1:09] that revelation will be in attendance,
[1:10] oh God. That Father, Lord, we'll be able
[1:13] to position ourselves as where you want
[1:15] us to be in this time. in this season,
[1:17] oh God. And Father, even as you are
[1:19] pouring yourself out, Lord, we want to
[1:20] empty ourselves out of ourselves and
[1:23] everything, Lord, that's not of you,
[1:24] Father. Lord, even as we come before you
[1:26] now, Lord, we pray you'll bless the
[1:28] hearer of the word and the speaker, oh
[1:30] God. We pray, Lord, for the word that
[1:31] will be spoken, Lord. We find an abiding
[1:33] place in our hearts. We ask your
[1:35] blessings now in the name of our Lord
[1:36] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank
[1:38] you, Lord. Amen. I greet you all in the
[1:41] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:43] Jesus Christ. Amen. Everybody feeling
[1:45] good in the house of the Lord? Amen.
[1:48] Hallelujah. I feel good just to know
[1:51] I've been redeemed. Amen. Makes me feel
[1:54] good. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So, we are
[1:57] grateful for another time and
[1:59] opportunity to come into the house of
[2:01] the Lord. Amen. To worship him. Amen. If
[2:04] Jeff's unwell, remember him in prayer.
[2:09] Hallelujah. Amen. And remember one
[2:11] another in prayer. Amen. Remember also
[2:13] those that we
[2:15] are we are praying for. Amen.
[2:17] Backslitting not coming to church. Amen.
[2:21] And maybe thinking who's the backsliden
[2:22] ones not coming to church. Amen. People
[2:26] can be backslitten in many ways. That's
[2:28] right. Sometimes they need overcoming
[2:29] power. Amen.
[2:32] So eating once a week is not good
[2:34] enough.
[2:36] Amen. Some people are so particular
[2:40] about the eating habits. They want to
[2:41] eat every 3
[2:43] hours or three meals a day. Amen. So I
[2:47] believe Amen. every opportunity we get,
[2:49] we should come into the house of the
[2:50] Lord. Now don't be mistaken that by
[2:54] seeing signs come to pass and prophecies
[2:57] come to pass that will scare people to
[2:58] church.
[3:01] Not anymore. Yes, that's right. You
[3:04] know, in 1977 they were so convinced
[3:06] they sold their houses, their
[3:07] properties, this and the that year. Even
[3:09] if they're coming with physical marks,
[3:10] people will say, "Ah, I'm not coming to
[3:12] church."
[3:13] That's right. That's how the conscience
[3:15] of people
[3:16] are. Even as the Bible says, even as you
[3:18] see the day fast approaching, now they
[3:21] can see prophecies unfolding. The day is
[3:24] fast approaching, but they don't want to
[3:26] be found in church. So, I'm saying
[3:28] remember our brothers and our sisters.
[3:30] We don't want anyone to be lost or
[3:33] anyone to miss out on the rapture. And I
[3:35] say again, if the rapture takes place,
[3:37] and it's very likely it might take place
[3:39] on a witness day,
[3:41] then where will we be? Lord, where will
[3:44] we be when the book is open?
[3:48] Where will you be when the role is
[3:50] called?
[3:52] Amen. Will you be found in your place?
[3:54] Amen. Let's turn to the Bible. We read
[3:56] our scripture, then you can be seated.
[3:57] Amen. Praise the Lord. Are these screens
[3:59] on,
[4:00] brothers? Amen. We'll go to Acts chapter
[4:03] 4.
[4:05] Praise the Lord.
[4:08] Amen.
[4:19] Amen. We read Acts chapter
[4:27] 4. We have sister is it Kita? Am I
[4:30] saying it right? Is that the right
[4:32] pronunciation? Amen. Let's welcome our
[4:34] sister. Amen. Brother Shman's daughter.
[4:36] Is this your oldest daughter? Give a
[4:37] hand. Amen. Welcome her. Praise the
[4:40] Lord. Is this your eldest daughter?
[4:42] Amen. Praise the Lord. I remember you.
[4:44] You came here like two years ago. Maybe.
[4:47] Amen. I remember she's coming to the
[4:49] church and at that time wanted to come
[4:51] fellowship. We'll be happy to have you
[4:52] here with us tonight. We pray the Lord
[4:54] bless you. Amen. And grant to you the
[4:56] desire of your
[4:57] heart. Amen. And so Acts chapter 4 and
[5:01] verse
[5:05] 13 says, "And when they saw the boldness
[5:08] of Peter and
[5:12] John and realized that they were
[5:14] unschooled and ordinary men, they
[5:17] marveled and took note that these men
[5:20] had been with Jesus." Amen. Amen. Amen.
[5:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, who's Peter
[5:27] and John? Amen. The statue of a perfect
[5:30] man. That's now faith to
[5:33] love. When they looked at the stature of
[5:36] a perfect man, they realized these men
[5:39] were unschooled ordinary. So they're
[5:41] marveling at these men and took note
[5:44] that these men had been with Jesus.
[5:47] These men not only had a relationship
[5:49] with Jesus. Amen. When they're saying
[5:51] they took note that they had been with
[5:53] Jesus, what they really saying is that
[5:55] these men are like Jesus. Hallelujah.
[5:58] Yes. Amen. That's right.
[6:01] Amen. They thought they got rid of
[6:04] Jesus. Yes. Now instead of seeing one
[6:07] Jesus,
[6:08] they are seeing two Jesus. Amen. In his
[6:12] image and likeness. That's right.
[6:16] And seeing the men who have been healed
[6:18] standing there with them, they seeing
[6:19] the evidence. They had nothing to say in
[6:22] response.
[6:25] Amen. Amen. So the supernatural will
[6:28] always silence the critics. Hallelujah.
[6:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. When they saw the
[6:35] boldness of Peter and John, I'm telling
[6:36] you, that's a statue of a perfect man,
[6:38] they realized that they were unschooled,
[6:40] ordinary men and that these men and they
[6:43] marveled and took note that these men
[6:44] had been with Jesus. Amen. Amen. The
[6:46] Lord bless him through the reading of
[6:48] his word. You may be
[6:51] seated. He's going to be doing this the
[6:53] whole time. So I'm speaking on the Holy
[6:56] Ghost positioning sons of God for the
[6:59] final omega manifestation. Amen.
[7:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[7:07] There's only
[7:09] one unseen force sent to position us in
[7:13] this time and season. We can't get on
[7:15] man's idea. We've got to depend on what
[7:17] was sent to lead and guide the church.
[7:20] Amen. Amen. If it led the alpha church,
[7:22] it must leave the omega church.
[7:24] So, amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You know,
[7:26] when you start primary school, they
[7:29] start you with ABCs. A B C D E F G
[7:34] and they teach you counting 1 to 10.
[7:37] But what they teach you in alpha
[7:39] preschool is not what they teach you in
[7:42] Omega Metric.
[7:44] Amen. So, I'm saying the Holy Ghost is
[7:47] positioning the sons of God for the
[7:48] final Omega manifestation. Hallelujah.
[7:51] Which means that the omega manifestation
[7:53] won't be ABC's. It will be algebra.
[7:58] There is a people on the earth
[8:01] now that the prophet of God can say,
[8:03] "You know your ABCs. I can teach you
[8:05] algebra."
[8:08] That's still not a church coming. That's
[8:10] a church that's here.
[8:13] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. How many of
[8:15] you ready for algebra? Hallelujah. Amen.
[8:18] Amen. then you're the omega
[8:19] manifestation right now. Thank you,
[8:21] Jesus. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[8:25] I'm just praying this thing obeys me and
[8:28] it I don't know why it keeps doing that.
[8:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. So if you
[8:35] remember here that this man had sat by
[8:38] the gate beautiful.
[8:40] Amen. He sat there for 40 years.
[8:45] So Jesus died when he was 33.
[8:48] So this man would have been there
[8:51] sitting at the temple because the Bible
[8:52] if you read it says this man went daily
[8:54] to the temple
[8:56] to beg arms. Yes. And Jesus was always
[9:00] around the temple.
[9:02] So this man would have been sitting
[9:04] there when Jesus was passing by. That's
[9:06] right. Yes. But the son can do nothing
[9:09] but what the father shows him. Amen.
[9:12] Amen. Same like the man at the pool of
[9:13] Bethesda. He goes there and there's
[9:15] hundreds of people laying there. But
[9:17] Jesus heals one man. Yes. So this man
[9:21] was not meant to be healed under Jesus
[9:23] ministry. That's right. This man was
[9:26] meant to heal to be healed under St.
[9:28] John
[9:29] 14:12. Greater works than these shall he
[9:32] do. For I go unto my father. So there
[9:35] are certain things in life, certain
[9:38] situations in life that are kept back
[9:40] and held back for a certain time and
[9:41] season
[9:43] for the greater works for the outpouring
[9:45] for omega sons of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[9:49] Amen. But we can't operate in this way
[9:52] unless we recognize who we are. And
[9:55] sometimes we've got to be elevated to
[9:57] our position.
[9:59] So I'm praying for an elevation to our
[10:01] position. Even this tonight, I'm praying
[10:03] for us to go into higher dimensions of
[10:05] the Holy Ghost to get into that heavenly
[10:08] places in Christ Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[10:11] Praise the Lord. Amen. Oh, our God is a
[10:13] good God. Amen. Hallelujah. So, they are
[10:16] looking at the boldness that will come
[10:19] into the statue of a perfect man.
[10:23] All creation is in fact groaning to see
[10:25] the boldness come into the stature of a
[10:27] perfect man. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[10:30] Lord, praise the Lord. Now remember, we
[10:34] took this quote and the prophet is
[10:37] telling us that each generation
[10:40] has its own revival. So I say to you,
[10:43] don't miss the bride's revival.
[10:47] Don't miss the revival in 2025.
[10:50] Hallelujah. Remember how we started the
[10:52] year? God has promises for each new
[10:55] year. Lord, Amen. God has things planned
[11:00] for each new year. We spoke to you about
[11:02] dimensional doors being opened up. Amen.
[11:06] And we are seeing how in the in the
[11:08] religious realm, the doors have opened
[11:10] up. We're seeing in the political realm,
[11:12] doors have opened up. If you haven't
[11:15] noted in
[11:17] 2025, Revelation
[11:19] 13, the USA elected their new leader,
[11:23] inaugurated their new leader. Also in
[11:26] 2025 now, Revelation 13, the beast has
[11:29] got their new leader. Amen. And how many
[11:32] of you remember the message after 25
[11:35] years? Amen. Amen. Yes. Yeah. Amen.
[11:41] Amen. So that that wasn't just a
[11:42] message. Yeah. So we were looking at
[11:44] after 25 years, the promised son came
[11:47] forth.
[11:49] So we're looking now after 25 years
[11:51] since 2000. Every 2,000 years something
[11:54] major takes place on the earth. So could
[11:56] it be after 25 years sons and daughters
[11:58] of God will come to manifestation? Isaac
[12:01] will come in on the scene. Amen.
[12:04] Thank you, Lord. Amen. So each
[12:06] generation has its own revival. Oh, I'm
[12:10] having a good revival. Amen. We are got
[12:13] a word revival. Amen. And the prophet
[12:15] says they chants at the word. Amen. Not
[12:18] a word for another day. Hallelujah.
[12:20] Amen. Hallelujah. We don't have a word
[12:22] for another day. We've got present tense
[12:24] word, present tense reality. We see the
[12:28] supernatural in our day.
[12:31] God himself made flesh today.
[12:35] Amen. Now, hear what the prophet of God
[12:38] says here. If you've got the Holy Spirit
[12:40] in you, because the Holy Spirit is your
[12:42] original spirit. Amen. Amen. That's
[12:45] right. He's going to lead you and guide
[12:47] you into all truth. Amen. Watch what he
[12:49] says now. You're a candidate for
[12:52] association with the unseen world. Amen.
[12:57] And the supernatural. Listen in
[13:00] Revelation book of symbols. How many of
[13:02] you got the Holy Ghost?
[13:04] Amen. You got to make that your
[13:05] confession as well. How many of you have
[13:07] received the Holy Ghost?
[13:10] Then now the prophet is saying you're a
[13:12] candidate for association. Yeah.
[13:16] And let me tell you, a son and daughter
[13:18] of God, the prophet says, can go many
[13:21] years
[13:23] wandering. But because you are a seed of
[13:25] God, God will call you back into his
[13:29] program. Amen. God won't leave you,
[13:31] Amen. outside of his program. Sons must
[13:35] always come back to his program. You
[13:37] remember the prodigal son. That's right.
[13:39] Amen. If you are feeling too cold, you
[13:40] can switch the air off or higher. Amen.
[13:43] Praise the Lord.
[13:47] God won't leave you in a pitch pen
[13:49] eating pig food.
[13:52] Because sons can't feed in end time on
[13:54] pig food. Sons need eagle food. So
[13:58] there's only one place where eagle food
[13:59] can be found. That's in father's house.
[14:01] So no matter what position you find
[14:03] yourself in, what condition you find
[14:05] yourself in, God is leading you and
[14:08] guiding you back to truth. Amen. Yes,
[14:11] Lord. Thank you, Father. because you are
[14:12] a predestinated seed that God loves you
[14:14] and you pull you back. Oh, thank you,
[14:16] Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Glory. Somebody
[14:18] say, "I'm a candidate
[14:21] for association with the unseen world."
[14:24] Amen. And the supernatural. Amen. Thank
[14:27] you, Jesus. But I want to take that a
[14:29] bit further because a candidate is not
[14:32] may not be chosen.
[14:36] Right.
[14:39] You see that? That's right. He says if
[14:41] you've got the Holy Spirit, then you're
[14:43] a candidate.
[14:47] And and the word candidate means someone
[14:50] who applies for the
[14:52] job is nomination nominated for
[14:55] election.
[14:58] Hallelujah. Amen. So you are nominated
[15:01] for election.
[15:03] So God has nominated you when he gave
[15:05] you the Holy Spirit for association with
[15:07] the unseen world.
[15:11] But I don't just want to remain a
[15:13] candidate. Hallelujah.
[15:16] Glory to Jesus. Because a candidate is
[15:19] only nominated for election. Lord, you
[15:23] can have many people nominated.
[15:27] Amen. Let's see what Jesus is telling
[15:28] the disciples here. Amen. Praise the
[15:30] Lord. He's telling them, "Verily,
[15:32] verily, I say unto you, he that
[15:34] believeth on me." Right? Yes. So the one
[15:37] that believes on him is the one entitled
[15:39] to the Holy Ghost. Number one, he says,
[15:41] "Now the works that I do shall he do
[15:44] also."
[15:46] Praise the Lord.
[15:49] Who's going to do this?
[15:51] The one that believes.
[15:53] The one that has the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[15:56] Praise the Lord. Glory.
[15:58] Thank you, Lord. The one that he says,
[16:00] "Greater works than these shall he do."
[16:03] Amen. because I go unto my father. So
[16:07] what is he
[16:08] saying? He's saying I am here the
[16:10] physical manifestation of God on the
[16:12] earth. But I'm going away and I'm going
[16:16] to reestablish sons on the earth. Amen.
[16:18] Back to the original position. Amen. He
[16:21] says because I go to my father, greater
[16:23] works shall these sons do. So what was
[16:26] Jesus doing?
[16:28] Somebody tell me he was nominating them
[16:30] as candidates. Amen.
[16:34] Amen. At that time, the Holy Ghost had
[16:36] not poured out on them. Amen. Right? You
[16:38] see this, brother Amed? Amen. So St.
[16:40] John 14:12, he's nominating them as
[16:43] candidates. Amen. That's right. He's
[16:46] saying, you are the candidates for whom
[16:48] the greater work shall be done. Amen.
[16:51] Praise the Lord. Amen. But I want you to
[16:54] notice now the
[16:57] candidates now became elected official
[17:01] sons. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[17:04] That's Acts chapter 2 now. And then we
[17:06] find ourselves in Acts chapter 4 where
[17:09] Peter fasting. Let's see if the evidence
[17:11] work. Let's see if because the prophet
[17:14] says, "When the Holy Ghost comes upon
[17:16] you, you're a candidate for association
[17:18] with the unseen." Amen. Right.
[17:21] Association with the unseen and the
[17:23] supernatural. Now, we know the Holy
[17:25] Ghost poured out in Acts chapter 2.
[17:27] That's right. Right. Amen. Now go read
[17:29] Acts chapter 2 again because Jesus is
[17:31] telling them in Acts chapter 1 that you
[17:33] shall receive power when the Holy Ghost
[17:35] comes upon you. But when you're reading
[17:38] Acts chapter 2, we are seeing a
[17:40] different kind of power.
[17:42] Because here the Holy Ghost comes in
[17:44] like a mighty rushing wind. Hallelujah.
[17:47] Praise the Lord.
[17:49] The Holy Ghost comes in like a mighty
[17:51] rushing wind. Amen. Cloven tongues of
[17:53] fire sits upon them. Then it goes into
[17:57] them. Amen. Then they sang out of there
[18:00] like drunk men. Right. Still no power.
[18:03] We can't see any power. Right. Amen.
[18:07] Because Acts chapter 2, everyone refers
[18:09] to as Acts chapter 2 as the birthplace
[18:11] of the church. The power restored to the
[18:13] church. But what we find there is a man
[18:16] Peter standing up in the face of
[18:19] criticism and mocking that these men are
[18:22] drunk. He stands up there and he reports
[18:25] scripture back to them and says these
[18:27] are not drunk as you suppose. So it's
[18:30] the power restored of the spoken word.
[18:32] Amen. They are not drunk as you suppose.
[18:37] But this is that the prophet Joel spoke
[18:40] about. Amen. I'm going to pour out my
[18:42] spirit upon my sons and my daughters.
[18:45] Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord. And so I'm
[18:51] trying to show you. You read Acts
[18:52] chapter 2. It's a preaching service.
[18:57] And the power of the Holy Ghost
[18:59] captivates 3,000 men. Amen. And they are
[19:03] saved under the preaching of Peter.
[19:07] 3,000 souls get saved, convicted. Amen.
[19:10] Men and brethren, what must we do to be
[19:12] saved?
[19:13] He says, "Repent and be baptized in the
[19:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Amen.
[19:18] Amen.
[19:20] Praise the Lord. Now, we would have
[19:23] associated power with something else.
[19:27] But the power of the gospel, 3,000
[19:29] souls. It's only in Acts chapter
[19:33] 3 that Peter and John now come to the
[19:36] gate. Beautiful. Amen. Right. So, let's
[19:39] don't forget our thought now. In John
[19:43] 14:12, Jesus is telling the disciples,
[19:45] you are the candidates for greater
[19:47] works. Amen.
[19:49] But let's see after the Holy Ghost comes
[19:51] if it
[19:53] works, if it fulfills itself. Because in
[19:56] Acts chapter, you can follow in your
[19:57] Bibles if this thing is not working
[19:59] properly. In Acts chapter
[20:02] 4, Amen. or maybe Acts chapter 3, it
[20:05] says, "And Peter fasting his eyes upon
[20:08] him with John."
[20:10] So this must be a complete statue of a
[20:12] perfect man. Everybody say with me,
[20:14] "Peter is faith." Peter is faith. And
[20:16] John is love.
[20:19] Amen. So that's now from the from the
[20:22] foundation to the capstone.
[20:25] And saying look on us. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[20:31] Hallelujah. Amen.
[20:33] Because they know where deity is in
[20:35] right now. Amen. Come on. These people
[20:37] are not confused. Amen. Peter and John
[20:40] are not confused. Amen.
[20:42] You can't be confused in this time and
[20:44] season when we come right to the top now
[20:46] with the capsule coming down to realize
[20:48] where's deity. Amen. Look back to the
[20:51] 60s. Look back here. Look back there.
[20:54] No, look on us. We carry the authority
[20:57] of the word.
[20:59] Thank you. I believe that Lord. Thank
[21:02] you.
[21:04] Peter fasting his eyes upon him with
[21:06] John. So faith is looking upon hope.
[21:10] Remember this man is representing hope.
[21:12] He has a hope for something. He says,
[21:14] "Give me something." So here you're
[21:16] seeing faith, hope and love. Faith and
[21:19] and love are standing there and hope is
[21:21] hoping for something.
[21:23] And he says, "Look on us." And he gave
[21:26] heed unto them expecting to receive
[21:29] something of them. Yes. Praise the Lord.
[21:32] Amen. Now, I picked up something here.
[21:36] When you're picking this thing up, you
[21:38] can actually type in
[21:40] here the the restoration of the bride
[21:43] tree.
[21:45] Amen. Because look on us was one work of
[21:48] grace. Yeah. Amen. Amen. Yes. You can
[21:51] type in there justification,
[21:53] sanctification, and you can see right
[21:56] there 456. Amen. Six. They still
[22:00] speaking. Silver and gold have I none,
[22:02] but such as I have give I thee. In the
[22:04] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise
[22:07] up and walk. Amen.
[22:10] Thank you, Lord. So speak to your own
[22:12] situations.
[22:14] Speak to your own problems. Speak to
[22:16] your own trials. Amen. They must bow
[22:19] down. Amen. To your words. Thank you,
[22:21] Lord. They must bend to your words. They
[22:23] must obey your words. Thank you, Jesus.
[22:25] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Praise
[22:28] the Lord. Oh, I bless you. Amen. Thank
[22:30] you Jesus. And remember now it's only in
[22:33] verse seven that he takes him by the
[22:35] right hand. Right hand is signifying
[22:37] power. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you
[22:40] Lord. It's in that seventh age now that
[22:41] you are seeing the manifestation. Yes.
[22:44] Amen. The prophet of God on the scene
[22:46] took him by the right hand lifted him up
[22:48] and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[22:50] received strength.
[22:52] Amen. Thank you Lord. Amen. So which
[22:55] means at the end of the seven church age
[22:58] the bride was on her feet. Hey somebody
[23:00] catch us.
[23:03] It wasn't in any other age but only in
[23:05] the seventh verse at the end of that
[23:07] seventh age the bride was back on her
[23:09] feet.
[23:11] Amen. Thank you Lord. But the bride goes
[23:14] into another position into the bride age
[23:16] and the verse eight which speaks of
[23:18] eternity. Now the bride is leaping.
[23:21] Amen. upto stood and walked and entered
[23:24] with them into the temple because now
[23:26] she is the temple walking leaping and
[23:29] praising God.
[23:32] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So I say now
[23:35] this is my words. We are not the
[23:37] nominated candidate but we have secured
[23:39] the nomination and have been appointed
[23:42] to our position as sons of God. I am not
[23:45] a nominated candidate anymore. I'm the
[23:47] elected official.
[23:50] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. I
[23:52] bear the position as a son of God. Amen.
[23:55] Amen. So, which means now I've been
[23:57] appointed and elected for association
[24:00] with the unseen world and the
[24:01] supernatural.
[24:03] Thank you, Lord.
[24:06] Amen. Thank you, Lord. You have been
[24:08] elected now. Amen. Amen.
[24:13] Amen. So, you know, in school when they
[24:15] elect you as prefect, you can't do your
[24:17] own thing.
[24:20] You think prefect is being nice, you
[24:22] forsaken your lunch breaks.
[24:24] You must go stand in one corridor now
[24:27] and stand there. They they position you
[24:29] in that one place,
[24:31] right? Amen. You can't go along with the
[24:34] rest of your friends.
[24:36] Why? You've been given a position of
[24:38] power and authority. Amen.
[24:42] Amen.
[24:43] So we can't associate with the normal
[24:48] because we have been called out and
[24:50] positioned as sons of God. Amen. For
[24:52] association with the unseen world and
[24:54] the supernatural. Amen. Hallelujah.
[24:57] Lord, I'm only bringing one aspect
[24:59] tonight to show you something about the
[25:01] unseen and the supernatural than our
[25:03] association with them. Now I ask you if
[25:07] you were if you're praying in your room
[25:10] and an angel appears before
[25:12] you.
[25:15] Amen. An angel appears before you. What
[25:18] would be your reaction? What would be
[25:20] your reaction, brother Caleb?
[25:23] You'll be fearful. Amen. Brother Tyson,
[25:26] you saw an angel come into your room.
[25:28] Stand there. What will you do?
[25:30] You'll also be fearful. Amen. So fear is
[25:33] striking the heart.
[25:37] Amen.
[25:40] Hallelujah. But remember your
[25:43] association is with the unseen. Amen.
[25:46] According to the scripture now, right?
[25:49] Your association is with the unseen and
[25:51] the supernatural. Amen.
[25:54] So which means we live more in a
[25:56] supernatural realm
[25:58] and our minds is always heavenly.
[26:00] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[26:02] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's why I've
[26:05] been saying over a few weeks now, we go
[26:07] to work differently. Hallelujah. We go
[26:09] to school differently. Two of you
[26:11] traveling, you and your friend traveling
[26:13] in the same taxi to work, but you
[26:15] traveling in the taxi in heavenly
[26:16] places.
[26:18] While they in earthly realms,
[26:20] Amen. They're talking about earthly
[26:22] things. But your your your mind is
[26:24] heavenly minded.
[26:26] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[26:28] So, we are I'm saying this again. We are
[26:30] the elected officials for association
[26:32] with the unseen world. Amen. Amen.
[26:39] Thank you, Lord.
[26:43] So, I want to go to that verse 14 there.
[26:45] If you pick it up in your Bibles, Acts
[26:47] 4:14. And seeing the men who had been
[26:50] healed standing there with them,
[26:53] they had nothing to say in response.
[26:56] Right? That's verse 14. Now I am saying
[26:59] that we right now do you know that we
[27:02] are being healed? Amen. That's right.
[27:05] Amen.
[27:08] What is what is the the body change?
[27:11] It's the final healing of the body.
[27:13] Amen. Amen. So Enoch's walk is one of
[27:17] healing. Every day his body was being
[27:20] healed. Amen. And being healed. And one
[27:23] day he was so perfectly healed that he
[27:25] changed dimensions. Amen. Shall we leap
[27:27] over walls? Hallelujah. Amen. Now I'm
[27:30] asking you what kind of Holy Ghost do we
[27:32] believe if we believe that we are
[27:33] continuation of the book of Acts?
[27:35] Because the book of Acts took Philip and
[27:37] transported him while he was in a flesh
[27:39] body. Amen. So don't tell me the Holy
[27:41] Ghost can't do the same thing today. You
[27:43] need transportation. The Holy Ghost can
[27:44] transport you. Amen.
[27:48] You need an answer to your question like
[27:49] the uni. The Holy Ghost can give you the
[27:51] answer. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[27:54] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. But pay
[27:56] attention now. The the evidence is
[27:59] standing before them and they had
[28:02] nothing to say in response. Right? So
[28:05] which means they were
[28:07] silenced. They had to shut
[28:10] up. And here what the prophet of God is
[28:13] saying now. Watch. He's typing Mark
[28:15] 11:23 to the sons of God. He says, "Say
[28:18] to the mountain, be moved. Don't doubt
[28:20] in your heart, but believe what you have
[28:22] said shall come to pass. You can have
[28:24] what you have said. Now watch how he
[28:26] types in scripture. He says the placing
[28:28] of the church in position. Amen. I'm
[28:32] speaking on the Holy Ghost placing the
[28:33] sons of God in position for the final
[28:36] omega manifestation. Right. The placing
[28:39] of the church in position. So if he's
[28:41] going to place us in our position, he's
[28:43] going to give us the scripture to use.
[28:45] Amen. And he's just quoting the
[28:47] scripture. When the angel of God came in
[28:49] 2023, what scripture did he give us? I'm
[28:52] angry. He gave us Mark 11:23.
[28:56] Amen. He gave us Amen. Mark 9:23. All
[28:59] things are possible to them that
[29:00] believe. Thank you, Lord.
[29:04] Amen. So, these are the scriptures of
[29:06] little gods. These are the these are the
[29:09] these are the words that little gods
[29:11] utter. Thank you, Lord. Come on now.
[29:15] Yes. Yes, sir.
[29:18] He says where what is the placing of the
[29:21] church in position where the fullness of
[29:23] the power of the Holy Ghost comes into
[29:25] the church.
[29:28] Amen. Praise the
[29:30] Lord. Are they switching
[29:32] now?
[29:34] Amen. They should actually switch and
[29:36] not wait for it to go. Praise the Lord.
[29:40] Hallelujah. Let's just wait for them to
[29:41] switch and we're not distracted by that.
[29:55] [Music]
[29:58] Praise the Lord.
[29:59] [Music]
[30:47] Amen. Don't need to switch this back on.
[30:53] Amen. So, watch now what we just said.
[30:56] If the Holy Ghost is positioning us as
[30:58] sons, he's got to give us our scripture.
[31:00] Amen. Amen. And our scripture is Mark
[31:03] 11:23.
[31:05] Amen. The scripture that positions us as
[31:08] sons how to speak. Amen. You got to
[31:11] switch this uh back on here. Praise the
[31:14] Lord. So he says here again, the placing
[31:17] of the church in position where the
[31:19] fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost
[31:21] comes into the church. Amen. Amen. So we
[31:25] should be looking for nothing less than
[31:26] the fullness of the power of the Holy
[31:28] Ghost coming into the church.
[31:31] Amen.
[31:33] Amen. Lord, send the power.
[31:38] Amen. Amen. In fact, why don't we repeat
[31:41] that? Lord, send the fullness of the
[31:43] power. Send the fullness of the power of
[31:45] the Holy Ghost of the Holy Ghost into
[31:47] me. into me. Right now, when that
[31:50] happens, we're going to switch this back
[31:52] on, I suppose.
[32:01] Watch what he says now. Now remember we
[32:03] we are obviously following a train of
[32:05] thought. These men's mouths were shut
[32:07] when the evidence was standing before
[32:08] them. Right. Right. I'm tying it with
[32:10] this quote. He says when the fullness of
[32:12] the power of the Holy Ghost comes into
[32:14] the church, the critics's mouths will be
[32:15] shut. Amen. Amen. So what do we need?
[32:18] Association with the unseen world.
[32:21] Amen. Amen.
[32:23] association with the unseen world and
[32:25] the supernatural to shut the critics's
[32:27] mouth. Then watch what he says. It'll be
[32:29] a short time. Amen. So people seeing the
[32:33] sign, hey, pope elected. Hey, excited
[32:35] for Sunday. Monday.
[32:37] Born again on a Sunday, born again on a
[32:41] Monday.
[32:44] Hey, Sunday they born again. Monday they
[32:48] gone again.
[32:52] Hey
[32:54] It'll be a short time. So from Sunday to
[32:58] Wednesday is a short time.
[33:02] Amen. Amen.
[33:04] Right? Watch what he says now.
[33:07] Jesus, which is the head, came right off
[33:10] the mountain, went straight to Calvary.
[33:13] Notice it won't last long. It will be
[33:15] there. It will be here. Amen. It won't
[33:18] last long, but it will be here. What is
[33:21] he saying here? The fullness of the
[33:23] power of the Holy Ghost will be here but
[33:24] for a short quick time. Amen.
[33:28] Hallelujah. Amen. So what you do now
[33:32] when you see believers not here, you go
[33:33] and tell them, "Brother, I'm concerned.
[33:35] Sister, I'm concerned you're not at
[33:37] church. The hour is late."
[33:41] Amen. Amen. The hour is late. We should
[33:44] be found in the house of God. Yes.
[33:47] Praise the Lord. Amen. Tell your
[33:50] children to come to church. Amen. You
[33:52] know, I was reading this thing and it
[33:53] really struck my heart that you know
[33:56] even David in the book of Psalms is
[33:58] talking about how we can't take nothing
[34:00] from this life, anything we attain in
[34:02] this life with us.
[34:05] Amen.
[34:07] But the only thing that we as humans can
[34:10] take is our children.
[34:15] Right. Let me cancel your thought right
[34:16] there. Ate right took her children with
[34:18] us.
[34:21] Praise the Lord.
[34:23] Amen. So, what is your desire? Amen. If
[34:26] I ask you, what's your desire? You going
[34:28] to ask for a house or a car? Or you
[34:29] going to say the salvation of my
[34:31] children?
[34:32] Yes, Lord. Lord, because house and car
[34:35] you can't take but children you can
[34:37] take.
[34:39] The Lord told Abraham, I know you'll
[34:41] raise his children, right? He'll teach
[34:43] them to fear the Lord. And you'll read
[34:46] as they were going on, they were
[34:47] gathered with their people. gathered
[34:48] with their people, gathered with their
[34:50] people. But none of the land, the cattle
[34:52] that would said was gathered with them.
[34:55] So you can't take those things. Right?
[34:58] So build your hopes on things eternal.
[35:01] Hallelujah. Amen. The critic's mouth
[35:04] will be shut when the supernatural comes
[35:06] in. Amen.
[35:08] Amen. Amen, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[35:14] Here he's taking Romans 8. If any man
[35:16] have not the spirit of Christ, he is
[35:18] none of his. There it is. He is spirit
[35:21] and he is life. So, we've got to start
[35:24] to see ourselves as our words being
[35:26] spirit and life. Come on. This is not
[35:28] just a teaching. Every word that the
[35:31] bride of Christ speaks right now. Sons
[35:33] of God, when they are positioned, their
[35:34] words become spirit and life. Which
[35:36] means when you speak, you've got to
[35:39] Amen. expect to see your words come to
[35:41] life. Yes.
[35:44] Amen. Your words are not ordinary words.
[35:48] Your words must come to life. Amen.
[35:50] Thank you, Lord. This is exactly what
[35:53] the word is. That is exactly what Jesus
[35:56] is. He is the word. So, watch our way.
[35:58] This is the point I want to get to. So,
[36:00] when a spirit born, are we saying the
[36:03] spirit is coming now to do this for us?
[36:05] When a spiritborn spiritful man in faith
[36:08] takes that word into his heart and
[36:10] places it upon his
[36:11] lips, M Amen. Why? That is the same as
[36:16] deity speaking. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank
[36:20] you, Lord. Every mountain has to go. I
[36:25] say every chain must be broken. Every
[36:27] shackle must go. Every demon power must
[36:30] leave in Jesus name. In fact, right now,
[36:32] I break curses in Jesus name. Right now,
[36:35] I'm breaking chains in Jesus name. Right
[36:37] now, I'm breaking struggles in Jesus
[36:39] name. Yes, Lord. I break sickness in
[36:41] Jesus name. Lord, thank you Lord. Thank
[36:43] you, Father. Thank you. Thank you, Lord.
[36:45] Amen. Hallelujah. Demon powers are
[36:47] coming to oppress him this time. You
[36:49] think when when the fullness of the Holy
[36:51] Ghost is coming in, do you think not all
[36:53] of hell is not coming against you to
[36:54] oppose it? All of hell is coming against
[36:57] the children of God. But greater is he
[36:59] that's in me than he that's in the word.
[37:02] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[37:06] Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. And it's
[37:08] the same as deity speaking. You know
[37:10] what that means? It's the same as Jesus
[37:12] speaking. Hallelujah. Jesus wasn't
[37:15] selfish. Whatever he achieved when he
[37:17] and he got when he when he was
[37:19] victorious and he rose up, he shared
[37:21] with his body. Amen. Amen. Glory. He
[37:24] says every mountain has to go.
[37:28] Depression has to go. Anxiety has to go.
[37:32] Let me tell you, some people don't want
[37:34] to let go of their past. But I'm saying
[37:36] let go of your past. It has to go. Yes.
[37:40] Amen. When God puts something under the
[37:42] sea of forgetfulness, he forgets it. So
[37:44] stop reminding God all the time of how
[37:46] sinful you were and what you've done.
[37:49] Amen. Because you never done it in the
[37:51] first place.
[37:53] Thank you, Lord. You heard that song,
[37:54] what sin? What sin?
[37:58] It was gone the very minute you
[38:00] confessed. Amen. Buried in the
[38:03] sea of forgetfulness.
[38:06] Thank you, Lord. Yes. Praise the Lord.
[38:09] Hallelujah. Amen.
[38:11] Every mountain has to go. Thank you,
[38:14] Jesus. In fact, right now, if you're
[38:16] sitting here with a mountain, a
[38:17] circumstance, a issue, you got to tell
[38:19] it to go right now. Amen. You've got to
[38:21] give it legal notice. Demon powers will
[38:24] come. If they can't possess your body,
[38:26] Brother Brandham says they come there.
[38:28] There's a spirit hanging over you. They
[38:31] hang over you and you're feeling the
[38:33] weight of them hanging over you. Amen.
[38:35] And they come to oppress. Yeah. And
[38:38] depress. Yes. Amen. Amen. So sometimes
[38:42] you're feeling the weight. You're
[38:43] wondering why. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory.
[38:46] You got to say, I do not give you any
[38:48] authority over my spirit, my soul, or my
[38:51] flesh. This belongs to Jesus Christ.
[38:55] Amen. Amen. Give it legal notice. And
[38:58] don't speak this in your mind. Speak
[38:59] with your mouth.
[39:01] Yes. Your word, which is your logos,
[39:04] Amen. becomes your reality. That's
[39:06] right, God. Hallelujah. You know that
[39:09] that the Lord God, this is how the law
[39:11] works. God, brother says, was dwelling
[39:14] with his thoughts. And when he had all
[39:17] of his thoughts,
[39:20] nothing was happening.
[39:22] He needed another expression. Yes.
[39:26] Hallelujah.
[39:28] Amen. Which means he needed a logos
[39:31] so that the word can be expressed. Amen.
[39:35] Wonderful. Praise the Lord. You know
[39:37] that brother Brandham says it was in
[39:38] this stage of the condescension when he
[39:41] came from spirit to word which is the
[39:43] theophony body that he said all he
[39:45] created all things. So which means I'm
[39:48] still on my thought from Sunday by the
[39:50] way that the eternal thoughts of God
[39:53] needed a home.
[39:56] The thoughts need a bing ground. Amen.
[39:59] So the thoughts are like seeds but it
[40:02] needs a bing ground which was the logos
[40:04] and the logos gave expression to the
[40:06] thoughts.
[40:09] So the logos spoke what was in God's
[40:11] mind and he said let there be light and
[40:13] there was light.
[40:16] This same logos comes on the sixth day
[40:17] and says let us make man in our image.
[40:20] Amen.
[40:22] Praise the Lord.
[40:24] Amen. And when God says, "Let us make
[40:27] man," he makes a male and a female
[40:30] spirit.
[40:34] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Never forget how
[40:37] God made the first man. He made a male
[40:40] and a female spirit.
[40:42] Praise the Lord.
[40:44] Hallelujah. Lord, then God opens up a
[40:48] door. Amen. God opens up a door.
[40:53] Praise the Lord. Amen. He now needs a
[40:56] man to till the earth, till the ground.
[40:59] Yes. So what does he do?
[41:02] He opens up a door. Amen.
[41:07] He opens up a
[41:09] door in this man called Adam. And he
[41:13] takes from him inside a rip. Amen.
[41:17] Praise the Lord. Amen. Then the original
[41:19] man that he created, he separates that
[41:22] spirit. Yes. He takes the feminine
[41:24] spirit out of Adam and he puts it into
[41:30] this woman that he creates. Amen.
[41:34] Hallelujah. So a door is opened on the
[41:38] earth now.
[41:40] So these two need to function as one
[41:42] unit. To be man.
[41:46] So that's why when Adam wakes up now and
[41:49] he says, "You're a fine looking rip.
[41:53] Adam says, "You are born of my bone,
[41:56] flesh of my flesh. You shall be called
[41:58] woman." And he says, "Therefore shall a
[42:01] man leave his father and mother and be
[42:03] joined because they both now must be
[42:06] united." Amen. To function as the God
[42:10] man. Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[42:12] Amen. Amen. Amen. That was just by the
[42:15] way. I just want to read this last part.
[42:16] He says, "Satan cannot stand before that
[42:20] man." Which man? A spiritborn man. A
[42:24] spiritfilled man in faith who takes the
[42:26] word in his heart and places it on his
[42:28] lips. That man is the same as deity
[42:30] speaking. Yes. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[42:35] Satan cannot stand before that man. And
[42:37] there's only one type of people that
[42:39] Satan can't stand before is is a church
[42:42] that has got true revelation. Amen.
[42:44] Amen. Who knows who she is, what she
[42:47] stands for, that she can do the greater
[42:49] works. Amen. She will be an invincible
[42:51] army. Here is where the prophet is king.
[42:53] Now, if they get a true revelation of
[42:55] the true spirits within the framework of
[42:57] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[43:00] discern and withstand the antichrist
[43:01] spirit, Satan will be powerless before
[43:04] her. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[43:10] Ask your neighbor sitting next to you.
[43:12] If you don't have a neighbor, just turn
[43:14] around and ask somebody. Have you got a
[43:18] revelation? How long you in the message?
[43:22] Have you got a revelation?
[43:25] Amen.
[43:29] Because this is the key. Revelation is
[43:32] the key. Amen. Hallelujah. He fights
[43:34] revelation. He cannot stand it. That's
[43:37] right. Amen. He says if she knows Amen.
[43:40] Satan would be powerless before, right?
[43:42] So here is where the revelation, you
[43:45] know, this is a scripture about
[43:46] revelation. In Matthew 16, thou art
[43:48] Peter and upon this rock I will build my
[43:50] church. The gates of hell, yes, Lord,
[43:52] shall not prevail against it. 200
[43:55] million demons let loose on the earth. I
[43:57] don't care. They can't stand against
[43:58] this. Amen. Amen. That's right. They can
[44:02] go try their luck anywhere else. Not
[44:05] here. You say, why you using the word
[44:07] luck? Yeah, a lot of you try luck. Now
[44:10] you don't have to go gambling house,
[44:12] gambling den. Hey, you're sitting in
[44:15] your with your app on your phone in your
[44:17] bedroom. That's right. And you're busy
[44:19] gambling over there. That's where your
[44:21] money is getting wasted. Amen.
[44:24] Hey. Amen.
[44:27] You soccer betting and what?
[44:31] Betting on horses,
[44:34] playing all your things on your phone in
[44:36] your house. You're getting poor in your
[44:37] house.
[44:40] Amen.
[44:41] Amen.
[44:44] gates of hell can't prevail against it.
[44:47] Thank you, Lord. You see, people bind
[44:49] themselves by all of these spirits.
[44:52] Amen. But we we call ourselves sons of
[44:54] God, highly revelated people.
[44:59] Praise the Lord. But we go to foolish
[45:01] things like that. Yes. Squander what God
[45:04] has given us. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[45:10] Now let's deal with only one thing
[45:12] tonight. Amen. Then we close. Now when
[45:15] we are being positioned as sons of God.
[45:17] Now remember what we are speaking about.
[45:19] Amen.
[45:21] We are saying the Holy Ghost is
[45:23] positioning sons of God for the final
[45:25] omega manifestation. Amen. Hallelujah.
[45:29] The final omega manifestation
[45:32] which is Christ in the church. That's
[45:34] right. Praise the Lord. Don't lose that
[45:37] thought now. Yes. So let's position us
[45:40] in one aspect.
[45:43] He says this is the message unbelief
[45:46] does not hinder God. He says but today
[45:49] we have the privilege of coming beyond
[45:51] the angels.
[45:54] Hallelujah.
[45:55] Thank you Lord. Because Jesus never died
[45:58] for angels.
[46:00] And angels are servants. Yes.
[46:04] And by the blood of Jesus, we are sons
[46:06] and daughters. Amen. Amen. And we come
[46:10] into thy presence saying, "Thank you,
[46:12] Father, for what you have done for us,
[46:14] what you mean to us." Amen. Amen. Thank
[46:17] you, Lord.
[46:19] So, I asked that question for a reason
[46:21] before, right?
[46:24] I asked you the question, if you saw an
[46:26] angel, what would you do for a reason?
[46:28] But he says, we have a privilege of
[46:30] coming beyond angels.
[46:35] Hallelujah.
[46:36] Now remember my question wasn't if you
[46:38] see the angel of the Lord which is God
[46:41] in the form of an angel. I never asked
[46:44] you that. I said if you saw an angel
[46:45] come into your room what would you do?
[46:47] And I don't mean the girl with the curly
[46:50] hair that you call your angel cuz some
[46:53] of you thinking I wish she came into my
[46:56] room, right? I'm not talking about that
[46:58] angel. I'm talking about an angel of
[47:01] God. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[47:06] Jesus never died. Angels are servants.
[47:09] Amen. Ah
[47:12] bro. Angels are what?
[47:18] Right now they asked the prophet a
[47:21] question. How shall we judge angels? He
[47:24] says by being sons and daughters of God.
[47:26] Angels are servants. We are sons and
[47:28] daughters of God. Amen. Amen.
[47:33] Praise the Lord. Now remember, the Holy
[47:34] Ghost is positioning us in this aspect
[47:36] tonight because he wants us
[47:39] to be positioned. We can't say we're in
[47:41] heavenly places and we don't know how uh
[47:44] authorities work.
[47:46] The kingdom of God is very ordered.
[47:49] Amen.
[47:51] Amen.
[47:53] You get your general law, then you get
[47:56] higher powers. The centurion was
[47:58] detailing that to Jesus. Yeah.
[48:01] Right? So we know why am I saying this?
[48:04] If you're following my thought, I said
[48:06] you are have association with the unseen
[48:08] world and the supernatural.
[48:11] Right? So when we are having association
[48:13] with that, we shouldn't be fearful.
[48:18] We should know that we are sons of God.
[48:20] Amen. Right. Thank you, Lord. Here's a
[48:23] scripture 1 Corinthians 6:3. Do you not
[48:26] know that saints shall judge the world?
[48:28] And if the world shall be judged by you,
[48:30] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[48:32] matters? Here's verse three. Now, know
[48:34] ye not that we shall judge angels? Amen.
[48:38] Amen. How much more things that pertain
[48:41] to this life? Amen. So the scripture is
[48:45] saying, "Knowing not that we shall judge
[48:47] angels."
[48:50] Right? Now you hear what the prophet of
[48:52] God is saying here.
[48:55] Right? And it's in the mind of Christ
[48:57] that the human being has the privilege
[48:59] to enter in.
[49:02] You have the privilege to enter the mind
[49:03] of Christ.
[49:05] Didn't he say the mind the bride has the
[49:07] mind of Christ? Right. Let me go quickly
[49:09] now. And know the mind of Christ. My a
[49:13] reality to dwell in the channel of
[49:14] Christ. We unworthy mortals have been
[49:17] brought in to be sons and daughters of
[49:19] God to be fellow citizens. Oh my. I get
[49:23] to shouting. Amen. Amen. Amen. He's
[49:26] driving a point into that wellm where
[49:29] even angels can't come. Angels can't
[49:32] know the mind of God. Yes. Angels don't
[49:36] wasn't revealed to angels the three-fold
[49:38] mystery secret that God held in the back
[49:40] part of his mind.
[49:44] Hello. Amen. Amen. He says say angels.
[49:48] Yes sir.
[49:50] So what am I telling you? If we are we
[49:53] are adding association with angelic
[49:54] beings and the supernatural or the
[49:57] unseen and the supernatural. He's saying
[49:59] now in the in the heavenly realms there
[50:01] are angels there too. But he's saying
[50:03] angels coming can't come into realms
[50:05] where a son can go. Amen. Amen.
[50:09] Praise the Lord. Where sons and
[50:10] daughters angels are servants. The
[50:13] servants cannot go where sons and
[50:15] daughters will go. Amen.
[50:18] I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.
[50:20] Yes. I want you to position yourself and
[50:22] elevate yourself tonight. Amen. Thank
[50:25] you, Lord.
[50:27] Why? Here's the reason why. They can't
[50:30] enter into that relationship. Amen. They
[50:33] can only bow down before God and say,
[50:35] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[50:38] Almighty." But sons and daughters of God
[50:40] have a relationship.
[50:42] Amen. Whereby we can cry, aba father.
[50:45] Hallelujah. Angels can't make a claim on
[50:47] God, but sons and daughters can make a
[50:50] claim on God. We have right inner claims
[50:52] of every redemptive blessing. Angels
[50:54] can't make redemptive bless claims.
[50:57] Amen. Amen. Amen. That's right. They
[51:02] can't enter into relationship. They
[51:04] can't reference him as husband. They
[51:06] can't reference him as lord. They can't
[51:08] reference him as savior. Hallelujah. We
[51:10] enter into relationship. Yes. For they
[51:13] are servants and we're sons of and
[51:15] daughters. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Thank
[51:18] you. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[51:21] So, to to what extent can I operate this
[51:25] then? If I'm a son and they are
[51:28] servants, to what to what extent can I
[51:30] operate this? Let's see how the prophet
[51:32] operates this. He's praying for the
[51:34] governor's life here. He says, "God,
[51:35] spare our governor's life here of
[51:37] Arizona. God, we love him. We know that
[51:39] thou was put him up to be an overseer of
[51:42] over the people and the things of the
[51:44] nation here of the state. You see, he's
[51:46] not praying for Ramaposa to be dead
[51:48] yet. He's causing a mock in this
[51:50] country. Lord, just take him. No, he's
[51:53] praying now for the officials, right?
[51:55] Watch now. This is the point I want to
[51:56] get to. I pray you will send your angel
[51:59] to him right now. Amen. And let him know
[52:03] that we are praying for him now. Amen.
[52:06] Amen. Thank you, Lord. So, so you mean a
[52:09] son of God can dispel angels? Yes. Well,
[52:12] he could have called
[52:16] 10,000 angels. Amen. But I thought we
[52:19] were joint ears. Hey, come on.
[52:23] Aren't we joint ears?
[52:26] So, are angels
[52:28] available?
[52:30] When Daniel prayed in an angel, was an
[52:31] angel dispatched?
[52:33] Yes. Yes.
[52:37] I pray you'll send your remember was it
[52:40] last week or two weeks ago we were
[52:43] praying and we said let's remember the
[52:44] ones that are not in church and I gave
[52:46] you the scripture I said all that the
[52:47] father has given me will come to me and
[52:49] I said let's pray the angel of God goes
[52:50] and speaks to them I believe the angel
[52:53] of God is speaking amen amen you
[52:56] remember we had a baptismal service here
[52:59] you remember there was about five or six
[53:00] of them that came to be baptized how
[53:02] many if you remember that I think
[53:04] Jamaima got baptized at the same
[53:06] If I'm not mistaken, it was during co we
[53:10] put that little pool out there. You
[53:11] remember everyone jog your memories?
[53:14] That brother out of the blue phoned me
[53:15] today to ask me what time we having
[53:18] service on Sunday because his daughter
[53:21] wants to come to church. Amen. Amen.
[53:25] So what triggered that if not the
[53:28] prayer?
[53:29] That's right. Amen. The angel of God
[53:32] calling people to come. Amen. Angel of
[53:34] God calling people to come. You think
[53:36] you're here by accident tonight? No.
[53:40] You think you're here by accident to
[53:41] realize to make you realize that your
[53:43] position is higher in the realm of God.
[53:45] Amen.
[53:47] In fact, let's look at the hierarchy
[53:49] right
[53:50] now. In the seven dimension, you have
[53:52] God. Yes.
[53:55] Right.
[53:57] Who you think is next in line?
[54:03] Which angel would you positioned
[54:06] in? Come
[54:10] on. Praise the
[54:14] Lord. So, let me ask you another simpler
[54:18] way. Beside
[54:20] God, who holds the highest authority and
[54:23] power?
[54:31] I I'm trying to position you differently
[54:33] now.
[54:37] Who has the power and authority on the
[54:39] earth?
[54:42] Amen. That's me. That's you. Amen. So,
[54:46] what we need to do is see ourselves
[54:48] differently.
[54:50] See ourselves differently. Thank you,
[54:52] Lord. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[54:55] So you say you say but
[54:59] uh is that real that the prophet is
[55:02] saying send your angel right now? You
[55:04] can pray for that. Amen. Well, let's see
[55:07] what the scripture says. Amen. I if I
[55:09] put the scripture here. Yeah. Here's it.
[55:13] Hebrews chapter
[55:15] 1 verse
[55:17] 13-4. But which of the angels said he at
[55:19] any time sit on my right hand until I
[55:22] make thine enemies thy foottool? Right?
[55:25] This talking about the son of God. I'm
[55:27] saying you're another son of God. Now
[55:29] watch what he talks about. The angels.
[55:31] Are they not all ministering spirits?
[55:35] Sent forth to minister to God
[55:39] Almighty. Somebody help me to read this.
[55:42] I'm having a problem reading this.
[55:46] Then God is the air of salvation. Yes,
[55:49] sir.
[55:51] Is God the air of salvation?
[55:55] Okay.
[55:57] Who is the heir of salvation?
[56:01] So, who are the angels sent to?
[56:04] But they are sent as what? Ministering
[56:07] spirits.
[56:11] Are they not all ministering spirits
[56:13] sent forth to minister for them who
[56:16] shall be hes of salvation? So, angels
[56:20] become ministering spirits to you. Thank
[56:22] you, Lord. Elijah needs food. Yes, sir.
[56:26] Send the angels. Give him food.
[56:30] Hey, people gone quiet now. Amen. People
[56:33] gone quiet. They don't want to hear
[56:35] this.
[56:37] Amen. They want to leave angels higher
[56:39] than them.
[56:41] But the Holy Spirit is positioning you
[56:43] now in this one.
[56:45] Come on now. Why are you going quiet?
[56:49] Am I Am I not reading scripture? Amen.
[56:51] Am I not reading the prophet's quotes
[56:53] here? Amen.
[56:55] Right. So, yeah, he's he's asking the
[56:57] Lord to send an angel to him right now
[56:59] and let him know that we are praying for
[57:01] him right now. Amen. Now, you're a son
[57:04] of God. You got a need. You got a loved
[57:06] one. I challenge you right now. Pray and
[57:08] say, "Lord, send your angel right now."
[57:10] Amen. They are sick. Lord, touch them
[57:12] right now. Amen. Somebody needs
[57:14] deliverance. Touch them. Yes. Come on.
[57:18] Maybe you're witnessing and witnessing
[57:19] to someone. They don't want to come to
[57:20] church. Do you know you can say, "Lord,
[57:22] send your angel to stir up the art and
[57:25] bring them back to church." Amen.
[57:28] Thank you, Lord. I I feel like I'm
[57:30] getting 50% sure in agreement this
[57:32] evening. Thank you, Lord.
[57:35] Hallelujah. Amen.
[57:40] Okay. Well, let's just keep saying what
[57:42] the prophet says. Maybe the unbelief
[57:44] will be killing it now, right? Amen.
[57:46] Kick him down. Kick him down.
[57:50] We got the devil on the run. Hallelujah.
[57:53] Amen. Yeah, I can feel him now. I can
[57:57] feel him. We got him in a corner. But
[57:59] some people don't want to let him go.
[58:01] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Glory.
[58:03] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:07] Answer our prayer. May he recover
[58:08] immediately.
[58:10] May he be well. Love you all the days of
[58:12] his life. Right. Lord, I ask for the
[58:15] governor's life to be spared in the name
[58:16] of Jesus Christ, the son of the living
[58:18] God. Amen. Now, here we go. Now, sons
[58:20] and daughters, who has the most power
[58:22] before God?
[58:25] Thank you, Lord. Here's the prophet
[58:26] asking this. Now,
[58:29] you didn't want to believe me just now
[58:30] when I spoken. Here's the prophet. Now,
[58:33] sons and daughters, who has the most
[58:35] power before God? What is an angel?
[58:38] An angel is his servant. That's right.
[58:42] They're his servants. What are you?
[58:44] Thank you. His sons and daughter. Amen.
[58:47] Who has the most power in heaven then?
[58:50] Hey, you didn't want to believe me just
[58:52] now? Why don't you read now? Hallelujah.
[58:55] Who has the most power? Amen. Amen. Then
[58:59] a sinner that saved by grace or an
[59:01] archangel standing by his right side.
[59:05] Ask your neighbor, am I reading right?
[59:10] Glory. Amen. That's right. Thank you,
[59:13] Lord.
[59:15] Come on. Come on. I'm reading the
[59:17] prophet's quote here. I need to pull you
[59:19] out. Pull you out. Yes. Amen. Amen. And
[59:23] position you this evening. Yes. Who has
[59:26] the most power in heaven? A sinner that
[59:28] saved by grace or an archangel standing
[59:31] by his right side.
[59:34] Right. So what I'm trying to do, I'm
[59:36] trying to pull prodigals who had the
[59:37] servant mentality to say let me go back
[59:39] to my father's. I said listen my servant
[59:41] the servants are eating better than me.
[59:43] That's right. He wanted to go and be a
[59:45] servant. God don't want you to be a
[59:47] servant.
[59:48] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[59:50] Lord,
[59:52] come on now.
[59:55] Who has the most power? A sinner that's
[59:58] saved by grace or an archangel that's
[1:00:00] standing by the right side, who do you
[1:00:02] think has the most power? He says the
[1:00:05] sinner that's saved by grace has more
[1:00:07] authority in heaven than the archangel
[1:00:10] that stood by his side without sin cuz
[1:00:12] he's a son. Amen. Yes. Yes. Thank you,
[1:00:16] Lord. Son has more authority than his
[1:00:19] servant.
[1:00:21] Of course, we forget what we are. We
[1:00:24] forget many times what made us what we
[1:00:26] are. Amen. After we become what we are,
[1:00:30] then we forgot how we got here. This is
[1:00:31] in the kinsman redeemer.
[1:00:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:37] Amen.
[1:00:39] So, I'm saying
[1:00:41] the Holy Spirit wants to position you
[1:00:43] for an omega manifestation. Amen. But in
[1:00:47] order to to for you to see the omega
[1:00:49] manifestation, he must show you your
[1:00:52] position in the kingdom.
[1:00:54] Right.
[1:00:55] Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:00:58] Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:01:01] Glory. Go and read Ephesians 1 and see
[1:01:04] how it ends there. Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:01:06] It's showing you that God Jesus Christ
[1:01:08] ascended above all powers and all
[1:01:11] principalities. But now he says he has
[1:01:14] come now to share that in his body.
[1:01:17] Thank you Lord. So he holds the highest
[1:01:19] authority in the heavens and you hold

[1:01:33] So how do we see ourselves? Amen.
[1:01:37] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Now, let me ask
[1:01:39] you this
[1:01:40] question. Between the angels of God,
[1:01:46] and the kingdom of
[1:01:48] Satan, who holds more authority and
[1:01:54] power, that's the easy one. Who holds
[1:01:57] more authority and power?
[1:02:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:04] Who's more powerful? Hallelujah.
[1:02:09] So, let's look at the hierarchy again as
[1:02:11] we close. We got God.
[1:02:17] We got us.
[1:02:19] We got the angels of God.
[1:02:22] Then we got demon powers. Amen.
[1:02:26] Wonderful. Thank you. So what authority
[1:02:30] ought we to have over lowerass beings?
[1:02:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:38] Lower class beings
[1:02:41] coming to worry you and trouble you.
[1:02:46] Hey,
[1:02:48] you are risen sons. They are fallen
[1:02:50] angels. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:54] How come fallen angels are troubling
[1:02:57] risen sons?
[1:03:00] Hallelujah.
[1:03:02] You got to believe who you are in this
[1:03:04] time and season. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:07] You got to make claims in the kingdom of
[1:03:09] God as a son. You're struggling with
[1:03:12] something in this life. Go before God.
[1:03:15] That's right. Struggling with something
[1:03:17] even in your body right now. Go before
[1:03:19] God. I am telling everyone that I am the
[1:03:21] tabernacle of the most high God. Right
[1:03:24] now, your body is not looking too good.
[1:03:26] Amen. I'm struggling with this.
[1:03:30] This is coming down to your reputation,
[1:03:32] not mine. Your word declares that I'm
[1:03:35] already healed. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:39] Can you make a claim on God? As a son,
[1:03:42] you have the rights to make a claim on
[1:03:45] father's inheritance. He says,
[1:03:46] "Therefore, we can cry, aba, father,
[1:03:50] source,
[1:03:52] sustenance." Amen. Let's just leave it
[1:03:55] there. Let's stand together. Give the
[1:03:56] Lord a good hand of praise.
[1:04:00] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, I
[1:04:03] believe the Holy Spirit is positioning
[1:04:05] us. Thank you, Lord. Amen. To recognize
[1:04:07] where we are in the kingdom. Amen. The
[1:04:09] Holy Ghost positioning sons of God for
[1:04:11] the final omega manifestation.
[1:04:14] Hallelujah.
[1:04:17] What we are seeing now is the beginning
[1:04:18] of the end.
[1:04:21] Amen.
[1:04:23] Why is it now in 2025, you're seeing
[1:04:25] both players in Revelation 13 elect new
[1:04:28] leaders? Thank you, Lord. Hey,
[1:04:32] how about then? Oh yes, Lord. Amen. In
[1:04:36] the kingdom realm,
[1:04:39] we are being positioned in you. Amen.
[1:04:41] Amen. To our true position. Yes. Oh yes.
[1:04:45] Amen. Now you know why I got this court
[1:04:48] here.
[1:04:51] Because there's newly elected officials.
[1:04:55] They have a newly elected US president.
[1:04:57] They have a newly elected pope. But I
[1:04:59] say they are newly elected sons and
[1:05:01] daughters of God. Amen.

[1:05:23] this far by faith. Amen. Leaning on the
[1:05:27] Lord,
[1:05:29] trusting in his holy word. Amen. Cuz
[1:05:33] he's never failed me. Oh yes.
[1:05:36] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. Every
[1:05:39] head bowed, every eyes closed. Thank
[1:05:41] you, Jesus.
[1:05:44] Amen. Maybe you're saying, "Lord, I
[1:05:45] never saw myself, father, as much, but I
[1:05:48] realize now when I'm looking at
[1:05:50] authority and power and and the how the
[1:05:52] kingdom of God is set up." Thank you,
[1:05:54] Lord. I'm second in charge. Glory. Thank
[1:05:57] you, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:01] I'm second in
[1:06:03] charge. All power in heaven and earth is
[1:06:05] given unto me.

[1:06:09] heaven. Amen. Whatsoever you loose on
[1:06:11] earth is loosed in heaven. Whosoever sin
[1:06:13] you remit, they remit. Whosoever sin you
[1:06:16] retain, they are retained.
[1:06:18] Are these scriptures making sense now?
[1:06:21] Why would he place such authority upon
[1:06:23] you? Because you are an attribute of
[1:06:25] God. Hallelujah. You are Adam back on
[1:06:27] the earth right now. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:30] Amen. So I want you to get rid of all
[1:06:32] unbelief now. Get rid of every doubt,
[1:06:35] every fear. Amen. Say, "Lord, I
[1:06:38] believe." Amen. Maybe you don't
[1:06:40] understand much of what I said tonight,
[1:06:42] but say, "Lord, I believe every word." I
[1:06:45] believe every word. Send your Holy Ghost
[1:06:48] to make it more plain to me. Maybe I
[1:06:50] spoke it in a way that maybe you didn't
[1:06:52] understand. Say, "Lord, speak it to me
[1:06:54] in a way that will break it down. Make
[1:06:55] it digestible to me, oh God. The Holy
[1:06:58] Ghost will bring things to your
[1:06:59] remembrance. The Holy Ghost will lead
[1:07:01] you into truth. The Holy Ghost is your

[1:07:52] reason and anxiety and showing us oh God
[1:07:55] who we are in the kingdom of God. how
[1:07:57] you're positioning us even now, oh God.
[1:07:59] But Father, Lord, showing us, oh God,
[1:08:01] the authority that lays in a son and
[1:08:04] daughter, our God, Father, the authority
[1:08:06] that you have invested in us, oh God.
[1:08:08] And Lord, you have now put your
