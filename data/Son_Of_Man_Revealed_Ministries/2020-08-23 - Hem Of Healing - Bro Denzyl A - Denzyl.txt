us at 80 years and you know they say if you hold you might not have a chance to come under life but she's healed that well again so we thank god many testimonies also across the world we get uh you know the voice of god posting there people who they're covered 19 and things around the world they are being healed so we thank god we can always believe for that amen so no matter what the problem is always believe amen whatever the case and whoever the person is believer unbeliever you know i was never healed he wasn't a believer but a little girl a jewish girl was he servant testified to him and

and did that he got healed and after he got healed of himself he still went back to his old gods but you see we still serve a message from god amen and we just pray and you know god will make a way for us one of our needs up we just pray you know in the standard there's a crisis around the world hundreds of thousands of companies are closed down hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs and uh you know we thank god he's keeping us amen so giving praise giving glory and never fail to acknowledge him what he [Music] he was in swaziland for over three months i think after the

pastor denzel with us amen mr and mrs we pray god bless you this morning and uh encourage us for the word so uh you know this uh 19 has been very uh disruptive now the pastors can't even meet and discuss combined service we are locked up the easter service and uh you know we know when when the whole thing is going to come right again we're seeing our combined services and all the pastors preaching and all this thing so i thought i'm going to start inviting pastors you know to come every month one part will come every month and and enjoy the blessing of the ministry amen amen and fight for modesty so we're glad to have with you this morning made the sacrifice i've been leaving his church whatever arrangements you have to make and uh spend the time with us to preach the word of god so pray god to bless us this morning amen and now if you remember the last message he preached here let's see we've got a good memory you can you know nobody preach a masterpiece yeah he preached masterpiece now this morning i believe we are all masterpieces of god amen are we a masterpieces because of the word amen we are masterpieces because of the word see we have received him the word so god is only interested in the word so we are part of him the word and god sees us all because he was the masterpiece we are also master people man that we can believe him and receive him will be rejected around the world in this entire message but you know we can become part of that and just remember we cannot serve god if he hasn't called us [Music] we cannot serve him if he has not revealed his basics for us amen amen so we take him for them so he revealed it we can come and serve because a lot of people have rejected it and uh got all manner of uh excuses and you know they've got negative things to say about the message we had all these things the working of the holy spirit but uh you know reveal to you it's part of you amen you know it's part of you nothing can take it away that's the greatest thing that happened to us see that we have received so i believe we are all masterpieces we may have our faults and failures but the prophet said god looks in our hearts and he sees what we think about those things amen see if it is flesh we are not perfect here but we have one that is perfect the problem said now the negative is reflecting the perfect one so there's a perfect one there there's a negative here it talks about the trees and everything and there's it to beyond there's a perfect world over there i'll be glad for that amen so don't look at all that just know you are under the blood and god sees what we think about how we live and our faults and failures and how we feel about everything that's the main thing so we just appreciate it praise the lord let's stand this morning and i'm sure we're going to be blessed in the presence of jehovah and we'll be come to worship him and and acknowledge him amen thank god for that amen we also remember the uh the live streaming audience over there that got to make a way for them they that are not well and sick and things like that [Music] raise our hands [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] this is indeed another happy privilege we can come into your divine presence there's no better place this morning that we have never been to come into the presence of great chipotle all [Music] father your word says you are the same yesterday today god that does not change in his ways and his nature and his character yes and we are so confident that we got to know you through this message if it has not been for this message in the prophet that you would have said or we don't know where we would have been we don't know what understanding would have had of the word would have been in a state of confusion in babylon but it's your grace this morning that has picked us up this brought us into heavenly places into christ jesus this morning we humble ourselves before you break jehovah i absolutely that you forgive us of all thoughts and all failures oh we have many this morning we are not worthy but we thank you for what you have done for us lord that we can be covered and shadowed by the divine blood of christ thank you lord that when you look at us this morning you don't see any of our inequity you don't see any of our trespasses but you see the blood that is perfect and you see a bride that is spotless this morning a bride that is a virtuous bride that can come and stand in your divine presence lord knowing who she is this morning may you bless the meaning of thy word or the inspiration that we have when you take me out of the way but just use me as a vessel to speak things that i need for this morning in jesus name amen it's good to be again in the house of the lord for the opportunity to minister may the lord bless you and all that have come this morning those are listening hebrews chapter 7 we're going to read from verse 15. also hebrews chapter 7 on verse 15 and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchizedek meaning the likeness of melchizedek another priest who is made not after the law of eternal commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testified a priest forever after the order of melchizedek but there is barely a disallowing of the commandment going before the weakness and unprofitable thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by which we draw nigh unto god and in as much as not without an oath he was made priest for they for those priests were made with an old uh without an oath but this would then hold by him that say that him the lord's swear and will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek by so much was jesus made a charity of a better covenant and they truly were many priests because they were they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continued forever had an unchangeable priesthood let me want to turn to um look of luke chapter eight verse 43 luke chapter 8 from verse 43 it says and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of his garment that's the hymn of his garment and immediately a issue of blood extension and jesus said who touched me in all tonight peter and dave which were with him said master the multitude throng thee and presley and says thou who touch me and jesus said somebody had touched me for i perceived that virtue is gone out of me the lord blessed being of his word you may take your seats now this country reading another two verses and when the woman saw that she was not hit she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what caused she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith and may be whole go in peace the lord bless his word brothers and sisters and uh we trust you all and happy this morning and we thank god for his grace we thank god for his healing his wonderful testimony the things that he's doing uh in our lives we truly appreciate you this morning now i was just caught between two thoughts and about what i would thought i would share this morning and i thought i would speak on the tablets maybe in the day of atonement but um i seem to have just drifted away from that the scripture that we read here the title this morning is the hymn of evie and it's a thought that we took in our church and i'm just trying to put a couple of sermons together so that it'll make sense this morning paul here in the book of hebrews that we just read he speaks about jesus christ being a high priest and it's this same paulia that was struck by a pillar of fire on the road to damascus that's right and this paul asks a question the question was who art thou lord amen now it's not that paul did not recognize who the people of fire was or did not recognize the pearl of fire yeah that was not the thing because bellamy said that paul asked the question who are the lord and paul had no problem with that but the question that paul was really asking lord or elohim how are you unfolding or revealing yourself today that was paul's question because paul could not fail them out now or god was revealing himself in that day and then he asked the question who art thou lord or how are you revealing yourself to us today and revelation can only come from god paul was a student of the world paul was what the bible would call a pharisee or pharisees he had no problem reading the old testament and interpreting according to what had been taught but yeah with all the understanding and the teaching that he'd been brought up but he still did not recognize the first coming of jesus christ he missed it many of them missed it that day and the lord answered to him and the lord said i am jesus that thou persecuted us and that must have pricked his heart because here was paul who thought he was a righteous son of god persecuting the christians that believe and follow the doctrine of jesus christ and he thought he was doing the right thing until god had revealed him that i am jesus this spirit of fire this light that has struck it out i am actually jesus so that must have picked his heart knowing that he was persecuting the one that he was actually worshiping himself and paul let me know how to separate himself uh go into the wilderness going to the desert so god would reveal exactly his word for the hour paul knew who god of yesterday was he had no problem with that but paul did not know who the god of today was that's always a problem brothers and sisters he's recognizing your day and his message recognizing god in your day even recognizing the token for your day like philippines says the token kept changing and we know brother and says god answered the question to paul and he says that he revealed to paul that jehovah the old testament was jesus of the new testament meaning that he was the fullness of the goddess made body in a in a flesh body jesus christ amen just the same revelation that was given to paul was the same revelation given to peter when peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god was the same revelation that was given to john when john when john said he was the word and the in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh it was the exact same revelation given to the woman at the well she said we know when when messiah cometh he do with these things so she had a revelation that this was the messiah without the theology of what paul had god revealed into a bio revelation being a predestinated seed amen just like martha and mother when christ came to the grave of letters martha said i believe that thou art the christ the son of god same revelation revealed to all of them now he's being revealed to paul the apostle and prophet so the revelation does not change brothers and sisters the lamb says he is the word he is god and the only thing that changes about him is his veil the way he expresses himself now we know that jesus was a prophet scripture tells us he was a prophet we know he was prophet king and priest moses in the book of deuteronomy says the lord that god will raise up a prophet like an unto me and he came as a prophet but he was the prophet of prophets yes all the old testament prophets brother man said had a portion of the word and every one of them reflected him to come but jesus christ was not a portion of the word he was the fullest of the world all prophets made together in one body god tabernacle in human flesh and brother bannon says that god before the foundation of the world he saw himself becoming flesh amen god saw himself becoming a man and going to calvary god saw himself do the work of redemption yet there was one part of redemption at calvary the other part is completed today because brother barron says revelation is progressive amen and god's vision of himself becoming flesh is progressive brother branham does not stop at jesus christ 2000 years ago brother says that when god saw himself becoming flesh he saw himself becoming flesh and you and i amen today that's a quote amen you see he saw himself becoming flesh in you and i and that's why the scripture says at that day you will know that i am in the father the father is in me i am in you and you are in me and brother says that day is this day yes in other words that scripture is being fulfilled brothers and sisters in our very day and hour that we are living now jesus we know came as son of man he came as prophet john 16 verse 14 says the people testified truly this was the prophet that was prophesied to come into the world now when we think of melchizedek we know he was king and priest of the most high god and these things we know i'm just going to rush to them the bible says melchizedek had no father no mother no beginning of days no ending of life he was an eternal being we know there's only one that is eternal that's god himself eternal god who is an eternal priest and is a an eternal king meaning that his priesthood does not end his kingship does not end yet paul in the book of hebrews tells us there is another king and priest who is in the order and likeness of melchizedek meaning that there is another priesthood after melchizedek but how do you get an order for example like brother adam explains it alien was god's first high priest amen when aaron died his son eliezer became high priest means that he took the death of one high priest to get another high priest and it became the iranian order and that brought in that order but the high priest had to die for another high priest to succeed but here we find out here that jesus christ is a high priest after the order of melchizedek yet melchizedek is an eternal being and cannot die absolutely so how are you going to get an order without a death now each one that passed away in early high priest aaronic priesthood they were uh the ironic priesthood had a uh the same bloodline means that it had to be the son of a high priest the son of a high priest the son of the high priest it had to be the same bloodline continuously amen god kept the priesthood in the same bloodline but so to the heavenly priesthood brothers and sisters melchizedek who was god himself having a particular bloodline jesus christ was no different from him the scripture tells us also this is what brother says i think i skipped too far can now jesus christ but the remnant says in the bible says that he was none other than melchizedek himself like paul says amen right amen it was not that uh the man speaks about melchizedek he says melchizedek was the pre-incarnate jesus christ amen he says about melchizedek he says melchizedek was the theophany of jesus christ in flesh amen means up to the enemy didn't die but melchizedek just continued in another body jesus christ not two different persons but one same person means that it's the same blood that was in melchizedek is the same blood in jesus christ and you know brothers and sisters the bible says that we are made kings and priests also amen after the order of jesus christ yet we ought to have the same bloodline as him and that's why in the book of christ the mystery god revealed brahman says you become the blood of jesus christ by the holy ghost amen by the spirit when the blood cell burst at calvary he says the light of the bloodshed came out upon the believers being the same blood from jesus christ comes upon the believer in spirit form it makes you the blood of jesus christ by the spirit amen that's how we become kings and priests after the order of jesus christ now the scripture tells us here that god instructed moses to wash aaron the high priest to anoint him with the anointing oil i think i mentioned this when i came at one time to wash him to anoint him and to dress him up there was a prophet that had to do that work aiden was washed by the prophet anointed by the prophet dressed by the prophet and he had to walk a holy walk into the most holy place absolutely amen pauline said that regarding the earthly priests he says that there was no place for jesus christ here on earth to be a high priest because the earth had the earthly priest he said yet jesus christ had somewhat to offer also as a high priest he said the earthly priest offered blood according to the law of the old testament which was the blood of bulls and goats it was an old covenant without an eternal promise but once a year they had to go and repeat the same sacrifice and paul says but jesus christ was different he says that he didn't have to go once a year to calvary his sacrifice was perfect that he went once and once done the job and his covenant was not the covenant of the old testament of the law but the new covenant of grace like i said jesus christ was melchizedek in flesh god tabernacle in human flesh there's no other high priest that could redeem the people with his own blood they come with the blood of bulls and goats a lower life is what they brought and the lower life could not redeem a higher life unit so god himself had to come with a higher life than our own life with his own life he'd come and give me that calvary to redeem us now we want to watch jesus fulfill the requirements of this high priest and to see how they missed him in that day and to see how they miss him today we said aaron had to wash our aven was washed by moses anointed by moses dressed by moses but his walk was his part jesus when he come to john and he come to a prophet also at jordan he was baptized in the water by the prophet john the baptist and brother man says the lamb was going to the washing just like the high priest even had went to the prophet moses and moses washed him jesus christ comes to jordan and john the baptist washes him and john the baptist identifies him at the river john he says behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world because jesus christ was both the lamb and the high priest together so john and the prophet washes god high priest god's lamb high priests and them and then joining his anointed right when the dove descends or the holy ghost descends in the form of the doubt means that he is anointed now as god's high priest and jordan washed and anointed at jordan now you watch this two types here when the dove is descending a jordan you remember when saul was anointed as king the scripture says that he was anointed with a vial of oil now a vile is a small portion of oil but yet when the scripture speaks about david being anointed a man up to his own heart he says david was anointed with the horner for him means that to saul it was a portion of the holy ghost but to david intact it was the fullness of the holy ghost in david amen and yet jordan we find that when the holy ghost came down the form of the dub it was not a vial of the holy ghost but it was the fullness of the holy ghost that come down in jesus christ because jesus was the son of david and david was anointed as king and jesus is anointed as king also this is the one type the second type is john said was the word made flesh in the book of john he says jesus christ was the word made flesh and the prophet tells us he says that the rose of sharon is the anointing of the word let me explain it now original quotation the seed of discrepancy says notice he is the rose of sharon the sweet smelling savor the anointing upon his people you cannot come before him with any creep or anything but anointed with the rose of sharon the word so yeah brother is saying that rose of sharon which is which is a perfume in the anointing oil he said it's the word and when john identifies him in the book of john he says in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh means that he was the anointing perfume the anointing oil of the rose of sharon so the word was the anointing the anointing that anointed priest and anointed king that's what he was he was anointed with the word because he was the word he was king and priest amen absolutely he was the word made flesh the perfume in the anointing oil the high priest is anointed with the anointing oil perfume with the rose of sharon before he enters the most holy place christ our height priest the lamb is anointed with anointing oil before he also goes to the most holy place how do they get this perfume from the rules of sharon prophet tells us this and you can read it up also he says they crush that rose of shame they crush it till the liquid comes out of it and they take the liquid the liquid has a fragrance in it and they mix that fragrance into the uh olive oil and it's perfumed with the rose of sharon and that anoints a person we know the type there is christ that was crushed at calvary till he bled and the blood was the anointing oil blam says the blood was the rose of sharon it was a sweet spelling saver see the prophet says our our sacrifices was a stink in the nose of god amen he says but when christ bled at calgary the rose that was crushed he says when the blood moves out of him it became a sweet smelling saber unto god now we know the role of sharon is the word and brother says on calvary the word died for you he says the word bled for you at calvary and the prophet tells us that the word also saves you and the word heals you as well amen crush that cowardly amen so we find out yet that he is anointed both as king and priest yeah in his earthly journey he was washed he was anointed he was anointed right now he has to be dressed right and the scripture says that when he went to mount transfiguration that his garment had changed that his garment became a pure white linen garment you know the scripture says though our sins being scarlet yet they shall be as white as that and they were talking about jesus christ who is white as well so now there was a transfiguration when his garment was brilliant white it was white as wolf in other words god was changing his garment because he was the lamb that was clothed with the world that was going to be the sacrifice a pure white garment and he was a lamb that pleased god that's what the voice said this is my beloved son whom i'm well pleased with yeah he him pure white lemon which was the holiness of the priest that's what he want washed anointed and dressed right dressed to be our lamb and our priest watch another dressing this morning here he is in pilates hall and we keep this in mind the lamb is getting ready for the atonement to sacrifice and when the lamb comes to pilate pilate asks him a question he says are you the king of the jews imagine that brother he's coming as a lamb for the sacrifice yet pilate uh pilate has the lamb for inspection but pilate asks the lamb a question are you the king of the jews because he was both king and priest and after pilate examines him and asks him are you the king of the jews christ says thou sayest i am what does pilate do next father itself find no fault so by pilate's own confession pilate is confessing that he is both king and priest lamb is examined found without fog but the lamb is questioned are you king of the jews then the soldier takes him away and the bible says that they change his garment again from the white garment that he is using now remember he was transfigured on mount transfiguration he is a is a lamb a white garment of world but yeah they take off his garment the bible says and they put on him another garment now the scripture says they put on a robe that was purple in color purple is a royal color it's a color of royalty in other words they took off their the normal garment that he used and they put on a kingly garment onto him amen and the scripture said they bowed to him and mocked him and called him hail king of the jews hail king of the jews didn't know what they were doing they took the lamb and they were presenting himself a king amen amen in the book of matthew they say they put a scarlet robe upon him because he took our sins they shamed him and they mocked him but he took it for us because he was our lamb but mark says he put a purple robe on him because he was our king also luke says they put a gorgeous robe on him you see it was a king's robe but also this was the most beautiful rope the most beautiful sacrifice that god was pleased with himself after dressing him up in royalty they plated a crown of thorns and they crowned him the lamb was crowned at calvary king they hit him on their head the bible says why on their head because when the sinner had taken his sacrifice to the temple they had to lay their hands on the head of the lamb and confess their sins yeah not knowing what they were doing they were hitting him with their hands on his head but what they were actually doing in time confessing the sins of the world upon him every stage he was being proven even by unbelievers that jesus christ was both king and priest amen was god manifested in flesh he was mercy let me drop this here why did they put a crown of thorns upon him what was adam's curse in the garden of eden adam was not cursed but the bible says the ground was cursed for adam's sake means the ground will bring forth thorns and tissues that was the curse and yeah he was second adam and he came to undo what first adam done so he took adam's curse upon himself when he took the the crown of thorns he took that curse and he put it upon himself at calgary being the second adam he took adam's curse washed anointed right and dressed amen now the high priest before going into the holies of holies he takes off his royal dress and he puts on a simple linen garment in humility he enters into the chicano glory beyond the veil and jesus was stripped of his purple outfit his proper gown and dressed into plain linen cloth again and he entered into the most holy place calvary a high priest had to walk right he had to walk a certain walk and a high priest when he walked into the most holy place the scripture tells us he had golden bells and pomegranate up the hymns of his garment the gold bells and the pomegranate they rang holy holy holy the sound the sounds of the bells are tied to the hem of his garments and he tells everybody that he is still alive amen that's what we commonly know about the golden bell and the pomegranate pomegranate that it just rings out and makes a sound to tell us the high priest is alive now jesus walked through gata at gallery it was the most holiest walk you find in exodus chapter 28 34 it speaks about the gold and pomegranate in other words on the hem of his gown on the hip of the high piece gum they'll have one gold bell stitch and one pomegranate red parmesan and one gold bell one red pomegranate that's how they stitched it and the book of accents says golden pomegranate gold and prominently that was the process the gold bells at the hymn of his garment he represents the king [Music] the gold bells represent deity god himself gold we know is the most precious mineral it speaks of god himself but the pomegranate is red in color and rare is the color of the original earth because adam's adam's name means red adam's name means earth also because the earth was red the ground is red pomegranate types the flesh which is this earth means gold and pomegranate on the hands of the high priest curd he speaks of deity coming down to earth amen means deity of god becoming flesh in a human body pomegranate is red it represents the blood the sacrifice the death yet inside of the pomegranate it is said to have many seeds and seeds speak of life because he is life amen but inside the pomegranate are many seeds now the jews tell us this when they open up a pomegranate they find all these seeds in the pomegranate he says when they counted it he says most of this pomegranate counted this counted 613 seeds let's keep that in mind the pomegranate is red in color it speaks of death but the seeds in it speak of life because he was he conquered death and given us life there's so many seeds inside of a pomegranate and if you buy one you will see that but it speaks of god who have many seeds inside of him which is you and i those that were hidden before the foundation of the world and were in him when he was expressed in a body of flesh here on earth like brother ben said when he come on earth you were inside of him means he was that pomegranate with many seeds instead of him so when you went when he went to calvary you were inside of him also so we were the many seeds inside of him the pomegranate represents christ who came to us to die for those that were part of him for our salvation and for our healing he's a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmity gold bells speak of both king and priest he entered into the most holy place at calvary as both king and priest on the cross he hung as a lamb that was bleeding for our sins but on the cross they wrote above his head here is jesus king of the jews king and priest again in revelation chapter 5 when a strong angel asks the question who is worthy to open the book they found no man in heaven worthy to open the book and one of the others said behold john don't weep the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed amen but when john turned and looked he saw a lamb again why is both king and priest again all through the scripture he was expressing king and priest this was melchizedek it was god himself in flesh amen unveiling and revealing himself and they were missing prophet king and priest the fullness of god manifested in flesh the world missed his visitation they turned down their pardon they could not recognize him in his first coming let me bring this in here this morning i want to concentrate on the hymn of the high priest garment we said the gold bells speaks of deity deity on the hem means that deity is coming down to earth to the lowest place and pronounces god hiding in simplicity and that's the reason they always missed him because of the way he revealed himself in a simple way the papa grante's vows we said was the earth represents the earth gold is deity so we have deity coming coming down to flesh means god becoming flesh here on earth to redeem man and to heal man inside the pomegranate are seeds which is life many seeds which which represents you and i brothers and sisters he came for those that were a part of him now according to the jewish law like i said they they count in most of its 613 seats and some more and some less but taking the average it was 613 seats which the torah or the jewish bible it says it has 613 commands or law in the old testament amen so what are the jews telling us yet that the pomegranate represented the full word of god because that's what jesus christ was it was the full word of god manifested in flesh amen but yet the seeds represented us also because the scripture says obama says that we make up the fullness of god if you read christ the mystery of god revealed the lamb says the fullness of god is back in the church again because he's come to us we are part of the fullness he is the word the word died for us the word plead for us the word saves us you can touch him today by believing his word holding onto his word we read a scripture here in the book of luke it speaks about a woman that had a bloody issue for 12 long years there's no doctor there's no self-proclaimed healer there's no medication that could help her god allows us sometimes to come to a place where we have no choice but to turn to him like the prophet says he throws us into a state of emergency to bring forth a desperation in our lives she was in a state of emergency she was desperate for healing but she heard that jesus was to pass away she was not going to let the opportunity pass her yes she had faith in him she had faith that he was the all anointed one not just part anointed all of him including his government she understood that this was the fullness of god here in flesh she knew a secret that even the pharisees and the celestials didn't know amen she knew a secret that even paul the apostle didn't know paul wrote most of the new testament by this time didn't know the secret that this woman with the blood issue knew you read numbers chapter 15 verse 37 to 39 it says speak unto the children of israel and put them that they make fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generation and then they put upon the fringes of the borders a ribbon of blue and it shall be unto you for a fringe the gay may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and they can seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which they are used to go whoring so what is god telling them telling the men of israel yet to do he commands them that at the hem of their garments to wear fringes means they have to sow tassels four tassels on the four corners of the garment on the hem of the gums and the purpose of the tassels was to remind them of the full and complete commandments of god neither at the hem of their garments must be a reminder of the word of god the full word of god means again what the scripture is showing is that the fullness of the word of god is going to come down to earth again let's bring him right down to the garment the hem of the government so they so they have the word in the hem of the garments the lowest part of the earth the word becoming flesh representing jesus christ means that in type what christ what god was saying to the men of israel look for him to come keep your eyes on the hem of your garment because that's how he's coming he's going to be the word manifested in flesh but they missed it they missed the type they missed the real thing they were supposed to have their eyes focused on the hem of their garments on the full word of god so they would recognize his coming they missed it because they did not hold on to the word of god and it depends what we holding on to this morning brothers and sisters we can hold on to the word of god and we'll identify him today we can hold on to a church we can hold on to a system and we can miss it today but if you hold on to the word of god you keep your eyes on the full word of god he will reveal himself now this is what they say when they had to tie the tassels into the hem of their garments there was a special way of knotting it and when they knotted it the number of knots that they had in each tassel was 613 knots you see what god was being brothers and sisters representing again even in the north the full world or the full command of god means that they should not escape or take their eyes off the full word of god they poke a hole into the garment and tie 613 knots tapping the full word of the old testament law the woman here she types the bride of jesus christ we're living in the day when the world is being made such a game brother says christ has come the word has come we use the same the bright coming of christ because he's coming in the bride notice the color of the castle is blue blue is the color of heaven means that the tassels have to be blue because heaven is coming down again do not all the types were there to the jewish people he was revealing it to them all the time but yet they still missed it the blue castle is heaven coming down to earth heaven coming and hiding in simplicity and they missed it but also blew his fellowship because god had lost fellowship and god was destroying fellowship again with man god desires fellowship there's something here that the woman knew that the others didn't know he said this the tassels on the hem of the garment it also represented the status of the stature of a man like a high priest when you seen a high priest you'll see him with the gold bells and the pomegranate you'll know his teachers you will say that's a high priest because you identified what was on the hem of the garment and i can't hear you some royal tassels and maybe some gorgeous tassels and when you see me know that's the robe of a king that's his status he's a king so it reveals the status of a man and the scripture tells us that the high priest in the days of jesus they began to widen their hymns they began to sow more beautiful tassels to show how good they were to show how impressive their lives were to show where they stood in a social standing so they began to brag about their own selves by putting beautiful tassels on their garments you find in the book of matthew chapter 23 he says but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their select trees which is a leather box that they use with scripture written in it when they pray they make broad their salaries and enlarge the borders of their garment and love the outermost rooms of feast and the chief seats in the synagogues greetings in the marketplace and be called rabbi rabbi rabbi so scripture is saying that god given them the commandment to have four fringes of blue to remember the word of god because if you keep your eyes on the word you will understand how he's going to reveal himself but yeah they made they got the hem of the garments wider and they put the old beautiful free fringes to be seen in the public that men will call him rabbi rabbi rabbi self glorification and that's why we got to be careful of religion amen they were very religious they were the most religious praying five times a day they were dressed right in everything but religion is very deceiving amen they have religion no problem with religion but they denied the power thereof they denied the holy ghost how god revealed himself in that day they denied it because they were religious and he took the eyes of god's commandment focused on the four tassels which is the full word of god and if you do that it will reveal him to you they changed the word of god they made it more beautiful they changed its color and all of those things they men handled the word of god to suit their own understanding and present themselves they denied the word of god for the day but there was a woman with a blood issue she could have looked at the high priest and she could have said such a beautiful garment such wonderful tassels on the hem let me put my faith in that and grab the hymn of their garments but the scripture tells us although they had beautiful tassels on their garment this woman was not moved to go for religion she would not move to go for something that was man-made a fate was anchored in the word and the word alone she was long past religion 12 long years she tried everything me she tried religion already she tried physicians already none of it could deliver her so she got to a place where she was desperate brothers and sisters and desperation moved there to look for the world long past religion even brother man tells us he says laying of hands is religion he says it's a jewish tradition he says and people like tradition people like religion so they want you to lay their hands on him and the lamb says but look at the the centurion he says lord you don't even have to come into my house but speak the word and it shall be one of it is religion the other one is the word be manifested in flesh today speak the word and move on she was tired of religion tying that she'd have to come to the high priest bring a sacrifice and follow tradition all the time it didn't help her she was looking for something more than religion brothers and sisters yeah like we said the centurion said lord you speak the word what was the centurion saying he was identifying who this man was he's only one man that can speak the word and that was god himself the logos before the foundation of the world he spoke the word into existence yeah the centurion is saying you i know who you are you are different from all the other men you are not like a priest like the other priest you are the logos yourself speak the word yes what are we saying we gotta go past religion we gotta go past bible stories this morning the world is being manifested in flesh and we gotta identify him today paul paul no matter how great he was paul missed it amen until god had grace upon paul and revealed to him that this is who i am the word made flesh according to john according to peter christ the son of the living god and so forth amen they missed him and yeah the pharisees says he missed him also about a woman with a blood issue a woman that is unclean she recognized something about jesus christ that the others were missing that is why you're not in one of those big churches that is why you in one of those fancy buildings because you're not running after those beautiful castles you're not running after the white garments the white hemmed of the garments you're not running after religion this morning but you're seeking something different so this man recognized this was the logos inflection speak the word it shall be because he was the logos in flesh the same logos that become flesh that spoke squirrels into existence brothers and sisters same one and belgium said it was not me that was speaking he said was him speaking to me let me just drop this here because it's on my mind brother madam says he says the scripture that he didn't want to preach on is a scripture it says when you say to this mountain be removed and cast into the sea it shall be brother ben said he was scared to preach in that scripture amen and the reason was that he could not understand how he would do that he said so i avoided preaching on the scripture most of my life until until that day in the wilderness that day when i went hunting he says and he says i did not speak that day he said it was my body but he spoke through me he spoke squirrels to existence now i understand the scriptures speak to the mountain and it will be moved it's not you this morning but it's him manifested in your place that will speak to the mountain to move amen the logos again becoming human flesh brothers and sisters [Music] they were missing it all the time but god does not change but anxious god always had skin on him she did not have time for religion these pharisees should have had the right tassels to remind them daily about the word of god the word of god that was going to become flesh the scripture says the virgin shall conceive but there is so full of themselves and religion they miss the word unfolding and revealing itself for the day what they done is they altered the handle of the garment they altered the world they altered it by altering the tassels yes the tassels were meant to remind them of the law of god the full word of god the hebrew word for law is halaqa and means the walk or the way means it's supposed to have the law at the hymn of their garments and is supposed to have a certain walk and yeah was christ christ not just the way they were dressed of course he had a gown with tassels on it but he had a certain walk because he was the law he was the word and in his walk to calgary he was about to pass a woman with the blood issue means that in his word there's people that he's going to pass by absolutely people that are going to identify him as the word of god identify him as jehovah god it's them that he's walking past this morning yeah he has the law he has the word because he is the word and it means the walk or the way because he is the winner means that he is our high priest with gold bells and pomegranate ringing holy holy holy he was god's high priest he was god's king he was melchizedek in flesh this woman was looking for something but the beauty part about this woman she recognized a day and a message why jesus and not go to the high priest why he is him and not there him because the scripture speaks about the hymn of the government in other words this woman was watching scripture she was waiting for scripture to unfold and reveal in itself and she recognized that jesus christ was scripture being fulfilled says but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he shall go far and grow up as calm of the storm now this is old testament scripture malachi the last book means that this sister with the blood issue had already read that scripture she already known that that the son of man was going to come with healing in his wings so she knows she's got a blood issue she but if only i can identify that son of man i know i'm going to be healed of my blood issue amen so she knew the scripture because it's old testament scripture but she was waiting for the fulfillment of it and she recognized that this day the scripture is going to be fulfilled in other words the scripture is saying that messiah is going to come with healing in his wings and that's what she was after now you go back to hebrew again and the hebrew word for wings is the word kanaf yeah but you know that kenneth is not does not have just one meaning kenneth means wings but kenneth means him also so if you read the scripture it means that some of man will rise with healing in his head this woman knew hebrew she understood the scripture he said the son of man is going to come with healing in his wings of course son of man is a man in flesh he does not have wings no man has wings so she knew how to interpret the scripture it's not going to be wings on a man but it's going to be the ham of his garment so she knew scripture she was waiting for fulfillment of scripture and then she recognized hey hold on this is the son of man if she didn't recognize that she would have went to the high please grab their hands but she didn't grab their hymns so the messiah will come the son of man will come with healing in his hands she knew the word brothers and sisters she found her position in the word yes she recognized her day and a message she recognized the messiah in her day she recognized the word being manifested in flesh amen what a contrast to everybody else all of them saw him they call him bialzebaum they call him the son of a soldier they call him a devil they call him all sorts of name but she recognized that this is the son of man this is the messiah this is the one with flesh and if i can get a hold of his hem the scripture of malachi 4 verse 2 will be fulfilled in my life she recognized that day in the message and she knew that messiah would come with healing in his wings and you go back and read the scripture the bible says as many as grabbed the hole of his hem they were healed and if we didn't read it we obviously a lot of us missed it i missed it i i never read that scripture took note of it even if i read it but the scripture says as many as grab the hem of his garment we're healed so they're not just the one person now that had a revelation of who he was there were others also that god had revealed that this is the messiah the word made flesh malachi chapter 4 verse 2 was being fulfilled in their days you see my point brothers and sisters that all through the ages they were missing he's coming they were missing the way he was unfolding himself but look who god was choosing to reveal himself woman at the well woman with the blood issue martha and so forth to them god was revealing the mystery of how he unfolded himself for the day for paul it was grace she took a whole of the word and when she grabbed the hem of his girl with me the the him has the full word of god means she grabbed a hold of the word for her day and she hid herself because she was embarrassed she was deemed a sinner unclean she was hiding but yet she embraced the word remember the high priest him he had pomegranate with seeds the reason why she could identify because she had representation there she was one of the seeds and the reason you recognize this message is you are one of those seeds you have representation inside of that pomegranate this morning brothers and sisters the pomegranate is and she fell and he felt virtue leaving him in other words virtue left him and entered into her and when the virtue entered into her the bible says that her bleeding her blood issue stopped amen amen the unclean was made clean the one that was separated from god is now brought back into fellowship with god amen virtue left him and entered into her in other words a part of him went into her brothers and sisters he turned around he said who touched me amen hello peter and all of them looking around says lord this so many people around you how can you access who touched you says not that cannot touch peter but there's a different touch i felt virtue leaving me me that somebody recognized who i am and drew on me drew on the world and the word came into her say the way he turned to her the bible says he knew her like he knows you and i but all he's waiting for you is for you to grab the grab a hold of the word for your day is for you to understand how scripture is being fulfilled in your day then he turns to you virtue will enter into you when you recognize the word for your day and it will manifest in you brothers and sisters expressing god's word for this hour she hung on to the hem of the word she caught the word because she was part of the word she was represented by the seeds in the pomegranate and then the word turned to her what did the word do the word revealed the mystery of this woman to the rest of them the lord asks peter who touched me means who is this person that has got the revelation of the word for the hour and peter said i don't know who that bride is i don't know who that woman is but the word turned to the woman and revealed her to the others this woman was a mystery but the word revealed the mystery of who she was nobody knew her but when she got the mystery of gawa then the word revealed her means a word revealed her name amen peter did not recognize her nobody knew her but when the seal of healing virtue broke right there it revealed her because her name was in the book and her name is in the book when you read the book of luke she's there identified there brothers and sisters and balaam says your name is in this book also amen he says it's not like all my neighbor or leave or something like that he says when the mystery from this book is being preached says when you catch the mystery he says it reveals your name in other words she caught the mystery of the word for her day that this man is malachi and world it would foreign who she was amen and when you catch the mystery of the word for today it reveals you the mystery of the bride brothers and sisters thy faith and made the whole the same chapter you find this generous daughter who died at 12 years old raised up and is a lady with a blood issue 12 years old also representing the old church and the young new church means that from ephesus even up till now the bride aid is calling you in this chat let's close at this point here see zechariah chapter 8 verse 22-23 king james version he says many people and strong nations shall come to seek the lord of hosts in jerusalem and to pray before the lord thus saith the lord of hosts in those days it shall come to pass that ten men shall take a whole or ten men out of all languages of nations even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a jew saying we will go with you we have heard that god is with you ten men is gonna get ahold of one man get ahold of his god because they believe that god is with this man now we know that is christ that all nations are going to get a hold of the hymn of his girl because god is with him he is god but in the time today the ten taking a hold of the one he's a type of revelation chapter 10 verse 1 means when all nations from all over the world is going to recognize revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and grab a hold of his hymn which is the word take the skirt of one jewish man because god is with him that's christ today revelation 10 1 and he comes to me with an open book which is the word itself he comes today with an open book which is the hymn of his garment he comes today with the full word of god again and he reveals to us brothers and sisters that's the gold belt it's a pomegranate it's a blue castle it represents a deity becoming flesh again amen revelation 10 with an open book the full word is coming down to earth again the prophet says like i mentioned earlier in the book of christ the mystery of god revealed he says the fullness is back in the church again now amen amen what does it mean but the fullness is back in the church because when christ comes to you then the fullness is back amen because he was the fullness before the foundation of the world and in that fullness you were represented in them amen then when you were taken out at calvary then it was not the fullness anymore because you were taken out the mansion but when he comes back and he's made flesh in you then the fullness is back in the church again the two are becoming one the fullness back in the church again and the angel says to john take a hold of that book it means go grab his hymn now take the full word because your name is represented in that book when you grab the hell of his garment and you recognize your day and your message it's going to reveal you as the bride of jesus christ today every seed is represented in there by faith you believe you it is you when you take the book when you take the m you are eating the book as the bible says and virtue now is leaving him and he's entering into you when the word is becoming flesh in you you recognize your day and its message like the woman with the blood issue when you catch the mystery of your day and its message it's revealing your name like i said earlier on and reveals the part that you have to play in the kingdom of god he said to the woman it's thy faith that saves you and brother says faith is a revelation it's your revelation today that actually saves you your revelation of how and and how who god is and how he's unfolding and how he's revealing himself today says this day you'll know that i am in the father and the father is in me i am in you and you in me and says this day that day is this day when the word is being made flesh in his pride today is the healing for our soul grabbing a hold of the hem of this garment identifying that this is scripture being fulfilled revelation 10 1 coming of the mighty angel is christ coming down again in what form to the bride this day it is fulfilled and you embrace the full word of god your grabbing is him virtue is leaving him and coming into you the world is being made flesh in you and is bringing healing to your soul eternal life brothers and sisters god bless you i'll be with you this morning just remain blessed amen shall we stand trophy father we thank you for your word once again thank you for your amazing grace and as we've seen in scripture lord there's many people that have seen you lord in a physical body but still did not recognize how world was being fulfilled scripture was being fulfilled in the day but to the predestined elected seed lord you revealed your word to them and we feel lord god so unworthy this morning you feel lord like that woman with a blood issue or that she hid herself when she identified the world because she was so embarrassed of her condition i feel like the woman that come to the wild lord so embarrassed by her condition lord she had to come at a separate time lord when uh when the other woman who were so-called uh much more holy than her much more respected she had to come at a certain time we feel like that woman today lord god but yet lord we know that those women receive grace and we are so thankful that we also feel like that that we receive this grace grace to identify the scripture in our day grace to identify your word and how it's unfolding our day we thank you for a prophet in this message yes we thank you lord god that we can feed on this word every day draw from emmanuel's veins that we could lord look forward to a body

ronnie gingham are together with his family and the congregation those that are present those that are not god that you'll have your special head of grace and protection over them you know god realizing the hour is so late you said lord when i come will i find faith but i pray god those that are in this fellowship lord the father will be found with faith lord lord in the time of the rapture we commit them into their hands if there's any sick and afflicted lord may he draw from your word this morning because like the woman lord when she identified the words you receive their healing may those that are sick and afflicted lord may they turn to the word medieval embrace the word of god this morning know that through the word the prophet says the word is a healer the word is our savior the word is god himself and by the preaching of the word about god they could anchor in him and they could claim the things that they are requesting we bless your name we appreciate you we worship and adore you relax all these mercies now in jesus name [Music] amen [Music] this morning and we thank god for the inspiration also the types bring out all the types showing christ amen another prophet told us we don't see christ in every verse of the bible yes go back and read it again so all the touch is there the present again who can see that only the bride yes the others can't see them see you know many times even people on the radio they say they're preaching the word lord bless your word but the word not anointed with the spirit is not worth yeah amen but we can hear the word anointed by the spirit see most everybody denominations everybody said they're preaching the word but what where are they preaching it's going to be the anointing of this day yes thank god for them to bring these things out and god has written these things out for us to feast on it [Music] amen we can live off this world yes okay so we thank god for that we give him praise you know touching the aim of his

the kingdom of god discuss that old system even in the prophet coming and tell us how god has disowned them once they were blessed once they had removed the holy spirit but they compromise on the world and god has disowned them but you make them right you're holding on amen i don't want to let it go i won't let this work go i won't let the message go we have come to revelation praise the lord aren't we glad for them and we can say with peter that lord where can we go to you are the words of eternal life okay where can we go you know explain the other place you go five thousand get down to
