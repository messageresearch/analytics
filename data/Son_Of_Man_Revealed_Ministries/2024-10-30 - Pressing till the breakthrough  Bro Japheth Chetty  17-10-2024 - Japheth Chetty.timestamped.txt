[3:58] 3:3 brethren I count not myself to have

[4:05] forgetting those things which are behind
[4:07] yes and reaching forth unto those things
[4:09] which are be which are before verse 14 I
[4:13] press to the mark for the prize of the
[4:16] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen
[4:20] may God add blessings to the reading of
[4:21] his word you may be
[4:23] seated amen so tonight we're going to
[4:26] talk on persevering until the
[4:28] Breakthrough amen amen pressing until
[4:31] the
[4:32] Breakthrough amen so I just want to read
[4:34] the Amplified version before we go on
[4:37] cuz I like how the Amplified version
[4:39] puts it and I'll read uh the whole
[4:41] chapter from verse
[4:46] one finally my fellow
[4:48] Believers continue to rejoice and
[4:51] Delight in the Lord to write the same
[4:54] things again is no trouble for me it is
[4:56] a savu for you paulia look out for the
[5:00] dogs look out for the troublemakers look
[5:03] out for the false
[5:05] circumcision amen those who claim
[5:07] circumcision is necessary for salvation
[5:11] for we who are born again who have been
[5:13] reborn from above spiritually
[5:16] transformed renewed and set apart for
[5:19] his purpose are the true circumcision
[5:22] amen so these are the true circumcision
[5:24] those that have been reborn amen
[5:25] spiritually
[5:26] transformed who Worship in the spirit of
[5:29] God and glory and take pride and exalt
[5:31] in Christ Jesus and place no confidence
[5:34] in the flesh though I my myself might
[5:38] have confidence in the flesh amen we
[5:40] know this famous scripture from Paul
[5:42] Paul where he says he was of The Tribe
[5:44] of Benjamin amen he is a Hebrew of
[5:46] Hebrews so Paul had every reason to
[5:49] glory in the flesh amen just like we can
[5:51] say Amen we had we have every reason to
[5:54] Glory because we've had the opening of
[5:55] the word we've had all of the Mysteries
[5:58] and all of these things amen
[6:00] we can glory in those things but Paul
[6:02] goes on here to say that amen he counts
[6:05] it all as
[6:07] nothing but he counts what he counts
[6:09] import is the righteousness in Christ
[6:11] Jesus that is found in US amen amen amen
[6:15] and the resurrection of his power amen
[6:18] he goes on to
[6:19] say not that I have obtained it this
[6:23] goal of being Christlike so he's saying
[6:25] I haven't obtained this goal of being
[6:27] Christlike yet I haven't obtained
[6:28] Perfection as yet
[6:31] but he says I actively press on so that
[6:33] I may take hold of that
[6:36] Perfection so we've not obtained
[6:38] Perfection yet we are we are striving
[6:41] for Perfection amen but Paul is saying
[6:44] because we have not obtained it yet we
[6:45] are actively pressing towards that
[6:48] markl amen we are not just saying that
[6:50] we are coming un Perfection but we are
[6:52] actively doing something about
[6:55] it he says brothers and sisters I do not
[6:58] consider that I have made it my own
[7:04] yet but one thing I do forgetting what
[7:08] lies behind me amen it's important to
[7:12] look back and see what God has done but
[7:14] in order to strive to Perfection we have
[7:16] to forget what lies behind us and reach
[7:19] forward to what lies
[7:21] ahead and he says I press on toward the
[7:23] goal to win the Heavenly prize of the
[7:26] upward call of God in Christ Jesus
[7:29] and he says all of us who are mature
[7:32] amen now maturity speaks of adoption
[7:35] coming up into spiritual
[7:36] adoption all of us who are mature
[7:39] pursuing spiritual Perfection should
[7:41] have this attitude What attitude is this
[7:44] the attitude of leaving those things
[7:46] which are behind and pressing forward to
[7:48] what God wants to do now Paul is saying
[7:51] every mature person or believer should
[7:54] have this
[7:56] attitude and he says brothers and
[7:59] sisters together follow my example and
[8:01] observe those who live by the pattern we
[8:04] gave you amen so Paul is saying amen we
[8:07] we we are striving for this Mark of
[8:09] perfection we know that we have to
[8:11] obtain this but we can't just sit back
[8:14] we have to actively press towards it to
[8:17] obtain the goal to obtain the prize
[8:20] amen amen
[8:23] amen now we find that we you know we we
[8:27] always read the scripture and it's a
[8:28] famous scripture
[8:30] and we might think okay it's just a
[8:32] basic scripture nothing to do with any
[8:34] serious mystery or something like that
[8:36] but amen when you read a scripture like
[8:38] got and then you put it in season then
[8:39] it means something to you amen so we see
[8:43] we are living in a season now where all
[8:46] things are striving to reach their
[8:48] climax Amen in every sphere it's almost
[8:52] like the time where the Prophet was
[8:54] talking about uh when when they were
[8:56] striving to go into space and to to
[8:58] reach the moon
[8:59] everyone was striving to reach the moon
[9:01] first the prophets of Russia was trying
[9:04] to do it America was trying to do it
[9:06] there was this pressure to obtain this
[9:09] goal amen and so now again we can feel
[9:12] this there's this heavy pressure in all
[9:15] spheres Amen in the sphere of Science in
[9:19] the religious sphere in the political
[9:21] sphere there's a huge pressure to reach
[9:23] a climax to reach a goal we see in for
[9:27] example in the sphere of science
[9:29] science has been progressing so much
[9:32] just in the last week we had three big
[9:37] things that have been happening in
[9:38] science one of the Pioneers Elon Musk
[9:41] released three great
[9:44] achievements and one of them being the
[9:47] fully automated driverless cars that the
[9:49] prophet prophesied about the other being
[9:53] a fully humanoid robot and the third
[9:57] thing being for the first time they were
[10:00] able to land back a rocket that they
[10:02] usually send into space usually when
[10:04] they send these Rockets into space the
[10:06] the bottom part of it blows up and they
[10:08] cannot use it again but for the first
[10:10] time they managed to preserve that and
[10:12] they managed to park it back on the
[10:15] ground so in the science there's this
[10:18] huge pressure to obtain and to achieve
[10:21] and to advance and that is what science
[10:23] is doing and so they they've obtained in
[10:26] the last week just these three big
[10:28] achievements
[10:30] then we see in the realm of world wars
[10:33] and and and and what's going on in
[10:35] Israel Israel is trying to achieve that
[10:38] they have this pressure to achieve these
[10:39] three great goal Wars uh War goals
[10:42] there's this huge pressure to win you
[10:46] see there's the war in
[10:47] Russia there's this huge pressure that's
[10:50] building up to win the
[10:54] war and then you look at the political
[10:57] sphere in the USA what's happening
[10:59] there's a huge pressure now for who's
[11:00] going to win the
[11:02] election and you see now both sides they
[11:04] have the red and the blue the
[11:06] Republicans and the
[11:08] Democrats are actively pressing to get
[11:11] votes and to win vote and to win the
[11:14] popular
[11:15] vote they being busy bodies they are
[11:17] going about actively campaigning so that
[11:20] they win the election and you know
[11:22] people are saying
[11:24] that and and it's not just a small group
[11:27] a lot of people are saying that this is
[11:29] actually going to be the most important
[11:31] election for the
[11:32] USA because you say if the Democrats win
[11:35] and if Kamala wins that it might be the
[11:40] end of the
[11:41] Republicans which means if there's the
[11:43] end of that it might be it might mean
[11:45] that's the end of the Constitutional law
[11:47] for the USA because the Democrats are
[11:50] fighting to bring in the Foreigner or
[11:51] allow the foreigners in and the
[11:53] Republicans are saying no we want to
[11:55] stop illegal foreigners from coming into
[11:57] the USA and so by the the Democrats
[11:59] doing that and by allowing the
[12:01] foreigners the foreigners are going to
[12:03] vote for the Democrats and they
[12:05] eventually in each election are going to
[12:06] have the
[12:08] majority and so that will put an end to
[12:10] the Republican having uh any type of uh
[12:14] advantage and you know it's a type of
[12:16] how you know in the spiritual realm all
[12:20] of these there's a huge fight to block
[12:22] out the foreigners from coming into the
[12:24] spiritual amen these demon powers from
[12:26] coming into the body of Christ there's a
[12:27] pressure to stop this just like how
[12:30] Israel is the pressure to stop Hamas
[12:32] from coming into their
[12:33] territory so that's what's happening in
[12:35] the USA and you see they are not sitting
[12:38] back if you look in the last month both
[12:41] uh the Democrat Party and the Republican
[12:43] party has been going widespread
[12:45] campaigning and trying to get the
[12:46] popular vote why they're actively
[12:49] pressing towards
[12:51] something and you know it's it's such an
[12:54] important time because if you look at
[12:56] what the Democrats currently stand for
[12:58] you know they see that they have gone so
[13:00] far left the things that they stand for
[13:03] if they come into
[13:05] power it's going to be a different world
[13:08] as we know it cuz they are allowing all
[13:11] of these gays and lesbians and abortions
[13:13] and all of these things so very soon
[13:15] we're going to see a world Amen that we
[13:17] are not used to a world that does not
[13:20] have any any kind of moral as it is
[13:23] there is no morals so can you imagine if
[13:25] this goes
[13:27] on Amen so there's in the politic and
[13:30] even they recognize it they're not even
[13:31] spiritual but even the Republicans are
[13:34] fighting to say no we can't stand for
[13:35] these things because it's no family
[13:37] values in
[13:38] this so even they can recognize as the
[13:41] world can recognize something is wrong
[13:43] here and they can recognize that there's
[13:46] this huge pressure now to prevent the
[13:48] Democrats from winning
[13:50] yes but we know now that in order for
[13:53] prophecies to be full certain things
[13:55] have to
[13:56] happen it's either the Dem rats win and
[14:00] prophecy is fulfilled the first female
[14:03] president or the Democrats don't win and
[14:06] God is a lotting Grace yeah amen that's
[14:10] right you know
[14:12] so but we know that either way God's
[14:14] word must come to pass am
[14:17] right but these are all just showing
[14:20] that if these are happening in the
[14:22] natural in political sphere in the
[14:24] science sphere and all of these things
[14:26] then in the spiritual there is a
[14:28] pressure to toward something as well
[14:31] there's there's a pressure to achieve
[14:33] something amen you recall Pastor was
[14:36] calling it a A propelling in the spirit
[14:39] realm there's been a a a a quick move of
[14:43] God that's starting to speed up
[14:45] something that has started that is
[14:46] starting to propel and get quicker and
[14:48] quicker and quicker and starting to get
[14:50] more progress gain more ground why there
[14:53] is a pressure Amen to obtain something
[14:55] then you look at the in the in the in
[14:57] the natural world in in terms of natural
[14:59] disasters you're getting all of these
[15:01] disasters that are happening recently we
[15:03] had the hurricane in in
[15:06] Florida in August we had the earthquake
[15:08] in Califor in California yes amen we
[15:11] seen not too long ago a hurricane in in
[15:13] South
[15:15] Africa what is that now that's nature
[15:18] also building up pressure to a point why
[15:21] because before the delivery of the child
[15:24] they must have those huge birth pains
[15:26] and it's given its final birth pains now
[15:29] amen there's a pressure in nature amen
[15:31] because why they are waiting for the
[15:33] manifestations of the sons of God
[15:36] Amen and so if all of that is happening
[15:39] then they must be the bride that is also
[15:42] coming into position the bride that is
[15:44] also being propelled Amen to obtain the
[15:47] prize that which Paul was striving for
[15:51] yes Paul was saying I press towards his
[15:53] Mark of perfection amen amen but there's
[15:56] a people now that is striving and is
[15:59] coming to that point of perfect
[16:01] Faith there is a people that is coming
[16:03] to the stature of a perfect man in
[16:06] Christ Jesus amen Paul and and the and
[16:09] On Through the Ages they could preach
[16:10] about it but now is a people that is
[16:12] experiencing it amen a people that is
[16:15] manifesting it and bringing it to pass
[16:19] yes but there's got to be that pressure
[16:23] within us that propels us to excel to
[16:25] these things yeah we cannot sit back now
[16:28] if you look at the Lily the prophet says
[16:33] that the Lily has to go through this
[16:35] process where has to push throughout all
[16:38] the mud yes and it goes through this
[16:41] painful process and it strives to reach
[16:43] up to sunlight and to crack through all
[16:46] of the mud until it comes unto sunlight
[16:48] and when it comes into the sunlight then
[16:50] it can display its glory amen and the
[16:53] prophet says the Christian goes through
[16:55] the same thing he has to go through all
[16:57] of these trials all of the chesan the m
[17:00] and Maya of this world until it can come
[17:02] up into the sunlight amen and then
[17:05] display it Glory
[17:08] yes amen we know Matthew chapter 6 says
[17:12] which of You by taking thought can add
[17:13] one Cupid onto his stature and why take
[17:17] your thoughts for Raymond consider the
[17:19] lies of the field how they grow they
[17:21] toil not neither do they spin and yet I
[17:24] say unto you that even Solomon in all
[17:27] his glory was not a raid like one
[17:29] years the prophet says amen how Mr Lily
[17:34] Pastor Lily is a wonderful School a
[17:37] wonderful Bible teacher he gets down
[17:40] into the valley the dark place he pushed
[17:43] himself through the darkness of the
[17:44] earth so what to do to glorify himself
[17:48] he says no to glorify everything that
[17:50] comes in contact with
[17:52] him amen so the Lily is not trying to
[17:54] glorify Itself by projecting this Glory
[17:57] but it's to glorify those that come come
[17:59] into contact with the Lily
[18:01] amen and he has to toil day and night to
[18:04] keep his Radiance of beauty now watch
[18:06] Jesus said the lily toils not but here
[18:09] the prophet is saying the LI the Lily
[18:11] toils so it's it's the same as when we
[18:14] say the believer has to go through
[18:16] trials and cheses and all of these
[18:18] things and be beaten but at the same
[18:19] time the believer is at rest with the
[18:21] Holy Ghost it's the same like how we say
[18:24] the believer it's not it's not a flowery
[18:26] bed of yeas but at the same time we had
[18:28] rest with the Holy ghost yeah Jesus say
[18:30] no the liily doesn't toil but then the
[18:32] prophet goes and say no but the Lily
[18:34] does
[18:35] toil but it's at rest
[18:39] amen so he says he has to toil day and
[18:42] night to keep his Radiance of beauty to
[18:44] keep the perfume flowing he pulled day
[18:48] and night from the Earth to give out
[18:50] that's what a real Christian does you
[18:53] pray and humble yourself and keep before
[18:55] God day and night in order you in order
[18:58] that you might give yourself to somebody
[19:00] else so why do we have to pray day and
[19:02] night to be a help to somebody else
[19:07] amen amen it's not what you keep it's
[19:10] what you give that counts you must give
[19:13] yourself out to others that's the way
[19:14] Jesus did he gave himself to others did
[19:18] the Bible say in one place behold the
[19:19] lies of the
[19:21] field that's in the Bible what does a
[19:23] lily do he toils day and night just to
[19:25] yield himself to the bees the passer by
[19:28] to give
[19:29] out he saying he's to give out the honey
[19:32] to the bees and you know what does the
[19:34] honey type remember the prophet said one
[19:37] day he was he went to his camp and they
[19:38] had these Bears coming to his camp and
[19:41] he started to tear down his camp and
[19:43] then he saw this baby cup dipping his
[19:46] hand and head and everything into the
[19:47] honey JY and sucking all of the honey
[19:50] and the prophet said when he went back
[19:51] to his mother the mother and the other
[19:53] cup started to suck the honey out of
[19:55] them the prophet types it with the Holy
[19:57] Ghost and revive
[19:59] [Music]
[20:00] so the Lily is producing this honey
[20:02] which is the Holy Ghost and Revival for
[20:04] everyone else to benefit from it amen
[20:07] and that is the bride of Christ is
[20:08] displaying its Glory so that the Revival
[20:11] fires can spread out and that is why we
[20:14] have this year sharing in his glory we
[20:17] are sharing in his glory not only for
[20:19] our own benefit but that we also might
[20:21] share that Glory out to
[20:24] others thank you Lord
[20:27] amen and know now Jesus said that
[20:30] Solomon in all of his glory cannot be
[20:32] compared to one of
[20:34] these why because it's typing the
[20:37] believer now and now Solomon in his day
[20:40] the glory filled a natural Temple the
[20:42] glory didn't fill
[20:44] Solomon it filled a natural Temple amen
[20:47] but now Shak glory is embodied in human
[20:50] temples in human Tabernacles which is a
[20:53] better Glory than that of
[20:55] Solomon amen because that physical
[20:58] Temple was only typing amen the three
[21:00] parts of the temple which was the outer
[21:02] Court the inner court and the most holy
[21:04] of holies was typing us which is the
[21:06] flesh the spirit and the
[21:08] soul and now Shak glory is tabernacl in
[21:11] human flesh and that is why this is a
[21:14] greater glory than that in the days of
[21:19] Solomon amen if you look at the Roman
[21:22] Romans 8
[21:23] man we know that this is the image that
[21:26] we are coming up to it says for I reckon
[21:29] that the sufferings of this present
[21:31] times are not worthy to be compared with
[21:34] the glory which shall be revealed in
[21:36] us so what is going to reveal this Glory
[21:39] now it's a pressing a suffering a
[21:42] perseverance that we have to go through
[21:44] is going to reveal this
[21:46] glory amen it's not just us sitting back
[21:49] and expecting God to reveal his glory to
[21:51] us we've got to go through a pressing we
[21:53] got to go through a perseverance
[22:01] amen and that is why nature is waiting
[22:04] nature is expecting this from us
[22:08] amen James Amen in James 1 and: three he
[22:12] said knowing this that the try of your
[22:15] faith worketh patience another
[22:17] translation says knowing that the
[22:19] testing of your faith brings about
[22:22] perseverance he says consider it pure
[22:24] joy my brothers when you encounter
[22:26] Trials of many kinds
[22:28] because you know that the testing of
[22:30] your faith develops
[22:33] perseverance amen allow perseverance to
[22:35] finish its work so that you may be
[22:38] mature and complete not lacking anything
[22:41] so how are you going to not lack
[22:42] anything you won't be in lack if you go
[22:46] through perseverance because
[22:48] perseverance worketh patience which work
[22:51] which works on your faith and remember
[22:53] patience is a virtue it's long suffering
[22:55] so it's a virtue it's part of the
[22:57] stature of a perfect man
[23:04] amen and that is why Jesus said consider
[23:06] the
[23:07] Lily amen because we have to persevere
[23:11] like that Lily amen
[23:14] amen now Paul is saying in another
[23:18] scripture he saying that he is running
[23:20] this race not
[23:22] aimlessly amen he saying therefore I do
[23:25] not run aimlessly I do not fight like
[23:27] I'm Beaching the air no I discipline my
[23:30] body and make it my slave so that after
[23:33] I have preached to others I myself will
[23:35] not be
[23:37] disqualified so Paul is saying we are in
[23:39] this race yes but we cannot run
[23:42] aimlessly we got to know what what our
[23:45] destination is amen we got to know what
[23:47] our goal is am me that is why the Bible
[23:50] says that a people without Vision perish
[23:53] you got to have Vision you got to know
[23:55] what you're running towards right amen
[23:58] and you got to be discipline yourself
[24:00] for the race now we take it in the
[24:02] natural we know that in in in the Sports
[24:05] World for example we see all of these
[24:06] athletes and so forth they discipline
[24:09] themselves they bring themselves to
[24:11] rigorous
[24:12] training they do not expect to obtain
[24:15] the prize just anyhow neither neither
[24:19] are they relying on they just on their
[24:21] talent I know if you seen that the these
[24:24] Sports people are very talented but they
[24:26] don't just rely on their talent they
[24:28] don't just come for example to the
[24:30] Olympics rely on their talent but no
[24:32] they get into rigorous training they
[24:34] discipline themselves they do all kinds
[24:37] of things that are not normal to us for
[24:40] example they'll wake up at very early
[24:42] parts of the morning they'll put
[24:45] themselves in these huge ice buckets and
[24:47] freeze themselves almost like to death
[24:49] just to discipline their
[24:51] bodies why because they know in their
[24:53] mind that they have to achieve something
[24:56] and they are determined to achieve
[24:57] something am so just like at the bride
[25:00] of Christ if we are determined to
[25:01] achieve something we are not going to
[25:03] achieve it the way we've been going
[25:05] right we've got to come with a
[25:07] determination we've got to come with a
[25:09] motivation Amen to press Paul says I
[25:12] press
[25:13] actively amen there's got to be
[25:15] something more than what we have been
[25:16] doing to obtain the prize
[25:20] yes now you find even in
[25:23] the uh even in the U in the business
[25:27] world you find very successful people
[25:30] that are determined and these rich
[25:31] billionaires and so forth they don't
[25:34] live the lives that we live you would
[25:36] think hey they are enjoying life they
[25:38] have so much of money they can go on all
[25:40] kinds of holidays and just live their
[25:41] life but no they live actually very
[25:43] stressful lives because they are
[25:46] constantly disciplining themselves they
[25:48] wake up very early in the morning they
[25:50] have all of these structured routines in
[25:53] order to achieve what they
[25:55] achieve yes now many times we talk about
[25:58] them and we say oh they just lasting
[26:00] after money and they doing all of these
[26:01] things but no actually they they have a
[26:04] purpose and a goal in their hearts that
[26:06] they are trying to achieve and they do
[26:08] what is necessary to achieve that and
[26:10] the success follows that the Money
[26:13] Follows that now we on the other hand we
[26:16] say no we want to have this amount of
[26:18] money and we want to drive this car and
[26:20] have this that's the last of money
[26:22] because you are not having the value of
[26:24] working hard for it but you want to last
[26:26] after those things that is the L of
[26:28] money there's no virtue in that but when
[26:31] you are determined to achieve something
[26:33] and you put in the hard work and you
[26:35] discipline yourself then everything else
[26:37] follows you now just like that in the
[26:39] bride of Christ and in the Church of God
[26:42] Amen you say we want to achieve a super
[26:44] race you and achieve all of these
[26:45] Supernatural things you are lasting
[26:47] after those things without putting the
[26:49] effort into obtaining those things and
[26:52] the prophet says power without character
[26:54] is not foot rule it's satanic how does
[26:56] character come would you person
[26:58] persevering with you disciplining
[27:00] yourself with you striving to achieve
[27:02] certain goals and then these signs
[27:05] follow
[27:06] you when you put in the work then all of
[27:08] these things follow
[27:10] you
[27:12] amen but there's this huge pressure Amen
[27:16] to achieve these things it it reminds me
[27:18] of of these black Fridays you know
[27:22] everyone Waits at 12:00 at midnight at
[27:24] the store at the door and there's this
[27:25] huge pressure to get inside reminds me
[27:27] of one one day me and
[27:30] Tyler were standing outside the door
[27:33] where was literally number two in the
[27:35] line and everyone's waiting for midnight
[27:38] for the doors to open to rush in and as
[27:41] soon as the door rushed in we were
[27:43] number two in the line but everyone
[27:45] rushed in before us because there was
[27:47] this huge pressure to get
[27:49] in and that is the determination we need
[27:53] to be having in this hour when time is
[27:55] running out when all things are starting
[27:57] to come to pass and in every sphere amen
[28:01] everyone is coming to the climax there
[28:02] ought to be this HTH pressure in the
[28:04] bride to come up to spiritual maturity
[28:07] amen thank you Lord to fulfill our part
[28:10] of the
[28:13] book amen Paul is talking about a
[28:16] determination to
[28:18] obtain can you imagine how Joshua and
[28:21] Caleb when the spies came back and said
[28:24] no we're not able there's Giants in the
[28:25] land and so forth can you imagine if
[28:27] Joshua and Caleb came with just any old
[28:30] attitude no they had to be determined
[28:32] and say no we are more than able they
[28:35] were determined to achieve it and
[28:38] because of that they were able to go to
[28:39] war and Achieve and obtain The
[28:46] Inheritance but you know that's how it
[28:48] is in the
[28:49] world people are always striving to
[28:52] achieve yes and now we need to take that
[28:55] same kind of motiv motivation and amen
[28:58] applyed down to the things of
[29:00] God you know they have as I was saying
[29:02] the successful people in the world they
[29:04] have their daily routines and so forth
[29:06] sometimes I think we need in in in
[29:09] spiritual terms we need our spiritual
[29:10] routine right amen you'll find that they
[29:14] wake up early parts of the morning they
[29:16] have a certain structure to their day
[29:18] amen we need to start structuring our
[29:19] days to apply the spiritual things of
[29:21] God to give time for the spiritual
[29:23] things of God Amen if you look at for
[29:26] example Daniel
[29:28] Daniel was very successful in the
[29:31] natural leave leave alone the spiritual
[29:34] he is very successful in the natural in
[29:36] fact he was promoted to princes above
[29:39] other princes amen so he he knew how to
[29:42] succeed in the natural and so he applied
[29:45] those same laws in the spiritual of
[29:47] disciplining himself and coming to God
[29:49] three times a day and praying the same
[29:52] laws he applied amen when he needed
[29:54] answers from God he went into fasting
[29:56] and praying and we come back to that but
[30:00] just to say you know when we was looking
[30:01] at these natural people and and
[30:03] achieving things in in in in the
[30:05] business world and in terms of success
[30:08] you might think that they just doing it
[30:10] and achieving but no they actually maybe
[30:12] they don't know it but they actually
[30:13] applying spiritual
[30:15] laws because we know for example the
[30:18] Bible says what you s is what you reap
[30:20] so they apply that maybe they don't know
[30:21] it but they apply it the Bible says give
[30:24] and it will come back to you amen then
[30:27] there's this other step what they which
[30:28] they use is Proverbs
[30:31] 20:3 which says if you love sleep it
[30:34] says love not sleep lest Thou come to
[30:38] Poverty open thine eyes and thou shalt
[30:41] be satisfied with bread so the wisest
[30:43] man on Earth is saying if you want to be
[30:45] wealthy in the natural life don't love
[30:48] sleep get to work because God made Adam
[30:51] to work God said he put Adam to till the
[30:55] ground so these people in the in the
[30:58] world Amen they use these laws they
[30:59] might not know it but they use these
[31:01] laws and they devote all of their time
[31:03] and attention to obtaining these
[31:07] things amen now as I said Daniel was
[31:09] successful both in the natural and the
[31:11] spiritual so he knew how to apply these
[31:14] laws and when he saw that he needed an
[31:17] answer from God he needed to understand
[31:19] the scriptures he went into fasting and
[31:21] praying amen can you imagine he fasted
[31:23] and prayed for 21
[31:25] days without knowing in the in in the
[31:28] first 20 days or so that he is going to
[31:30] receive anything from the Lord without
[31:32] even getting a whisper or any kind of
[31:35] feedback yes now can you imagine some
[31:38] some of us will never receive a
[31:40] breakthrough because we give up too
[31:41] early there's no
[31:43] perseverance there's no pressing amen
[31:45] towards hearing from God Amen and
[31:50] there's no motivation is sweat it out
[31:53] that Daniel had a sweat it out and he
[31:55] waited until the angel came he continued
[31:58] he as
[32:00] persistent and you know I I I know this
[32:04] this works for a fact amen because I I
[32:06] applied it in my life you
[32:09] know when you know sometimes I I I I be
[32:12] afraid to talk about uh to share
[32:14] spiritual things because you know some
[32:16] some people might not necessarily
[32:18] believe these things you know sometimes
[32:20] the supernatural seems weird or seems
[32:23] hard to believe at times
[32:25] amen especially when the super natural
[32:28] happens amongst us it's hard to
[32:30] recognize when God is moving amongst us
[32:32] it's easy to recognize God somewhere
[32:34] else very easy for example I I'll give
[32:38] you an example before I go into
[32:40] this one of the great Miracles that that
[32:44] we would consider in the Bible for
[32:45] example is raising the dead in the Bible
[32:48] there are hundreds and thousands of
[32:49] Supernatural things that happened the
[32:51] dead was only raised a certain amount of
[32:53] times a few
[32:55] times amen even in Jesus ministry he did
[32:58] so many thousands of Miracles but the
[33:00] dead was only raised perhaps maybe three
[33:02] or four times in his
[33:04] ministry the prophet himself thousands
[33:08] of Supernatural things happened in his
[33:10] life but I think the dead was only
[33:11] raised about four or five
[33:13] times amen so we would classify the dead
[33:17] being raised as a major thing amen we'd
[33:19] count it as a h Supernatural Miracle
[33:22] amen won't you amen but how many of you
[33:26] know that there's a there's a believer
[33:28] he has seated amongst us that has raised
[33:29] the
[33:31] dead how many of you have taken thought
[33:33] that that there's actually someone
[33:34] seated in assembly that has a testimony
[33:37] of the Dead being
[33:39] raised amen why is because sometimes we
[33:42] don't give attention to these things
[33:43] because we can't recognize God moving
[33:45] amongst
[33:46] us amen we can't recognize the presence
[33:49] of God amongst us we want to see God on
[33:52] his throne we want to see God in his
[33:54] Prophet but it's hard to recognize the
[33:56] presence of God amongst us
[33:58] amen because now we say sh glory is
[34:01] Tabernacle human flesh amen so when you
[34:04] look at your neighbor you ought to see
[34:06] God Amen I wrote the song A while back
[34:09] perhaps I should sing it on Sunday I
[34:11] said the the lyrics of the song says I
[34:13] see that you are a child of God adopted
[34:16] son in New Creation after Christ the
[34:18] first born I see a divine nature coming
[34:21] out of you from another dimension amen
[34:25] there's a divine nature being expressed
[34:27] amen inside each of you and if we can
[34:29] only see God in each one of us amen then
[34:32] we can see God move more because by then
[34:34] his presence is
[34:36] recognized
[34:38] amen so I say this to say you know when
[34:41] you sometimes when you give spiritual
[34:42] testimonies there's a you feel that
[34:45] resentment because when you but if you
[34:47] say the prophet did it then it's 100%
[34:49] believed but how would you know if if
[34:52] you was in the days of the Prophet would
[34:53] you have believed him because at that
[34:55] point there was no hype about who the
[34:56] prophet is that's right it's easy now to
[34:59] say yeah I believe the prophet because
[35:01] there's been years of hype built up
[35:03] around him but if you was in the days of
[35:06] the Prophet would you have how would you
[35:07] know would you have believed him if you
[35:09] can believe your brothers and sisters
[35:11] now when they share their Supernatural
[35:13] testimonies yes amen that's how you know
[35:15] you would have believed him
[35:17] then so I said I was talking about
[35:19] Daniel and about how he is fasting and
[35:21] praying and I experienced this you know
[35:23] when when my brother was sick Jonathan
[35:26] who passed on
[35:28] and you know I got into such a state of
[35:30] desperation and you know sometimes it's
[35:32] good even though people might not
[35:34] believe or resent it but it's good to
[35:36] preach out of testimonies because that's
[35:37] what the prophet did right and you
[35:39] rather have someone preach out of an
[35:41] experience than out of an intellectual
[35:43] concept and amen we got men of God here
[35:45] that can preach out of experiences amen
[35:48] Supernatural
[35:49] experiences amen so I got under such
[35:52] desperation at that time because you
[35:54] know um he was getting quite severe and
[35:58] every day I was rushing him to hospital
[36:00] and just to get him on morphine because
[36:02] he was in such pain and all of these
[36:03] things eventually we took him to I left
[36:06] him at the hospital to have his last B
[36:09] of
[36:10] chemo and I began to get so desperate
[36:12] that I said I need to hear from God I I
[36:15] need an answer from God am to the point
[36:19] where at that point Sister Kim was
[36:21] heavily pregnant and you know with
[36:23] pregnancy comes all of these emotions
[36:25] and all of these things but was so
[36:28] desperate that I took her and I left her
[36:30] at her mother's place and I said you
[36:32] stay here I'm only going to pick you up
[36:33] when I hear from God and I went back
[36:35] home I fasted and prayed he went about 3
[36:37] or 4 days without eating and just
[36:40] waiting upon the Lord not seeing my wife
[36:42] or anything like that despite she being
[36:44] pregnant but that's the desperation I
[36:47] got under because I knew this was a life
[36:49] and death
[36:51] situation and you know it was at that
[36:54] point firstly
[36:56] that when I said God look look God I
[36:58] need to hear from you I'm going to open
[37:00] my bible three times and and the three
[37:03] times that I open my bible I want you to
[37:05] speak to me and give me an answer cuz at
[37:08] that point I didn't know that the Lord
[37:09] was going to take him
[37:11] away and the first time I opened my
[37:13] Bible the Bible says my ways are not
[37:17] your ways my ways are higher than your
[37:20] ways so I said okay I closed my Bible
[37:23] again I opened it again and it says and
[37:27] Jesus Jesus healed every serious pain
[37:31] and that's the first time I read in the
[37:33] Bible where it said Jesus healed every
[37:34] serious pain usually he says Jesus he
[37:36] the sick and all but those words serious
[37:39] pain struck out to me because Jonathan
[37:41] was in such serious pain he needing
[37:43] morphing every
[37:44] day and then I closed it again I opened
[37:47] it again and yah God Was preparing me
[37:51] here now he said thy brother who was
[37:54] once dead is now alive he has once lost
[37:57] now he's saved that was the word of the
[38:00] Lord and I didn't know at that point
[38:01] that he was going to pass on that week
[38:03] but here was God preparing me for it so
[38:07] anyway I was fasting and praying that
[38:09] week and then we ended up getting the
[38:11] call to go to the hospital and passed on
[38:14] and so I was like okay you know I waited
[38:16] upon the Lord I trusted in God but this
[38:18] was clearly God's will because God gave
[38:20] me the scripture for it and his word is
[38:22] absolute so I said praise
[38:25] God so on the day of his
[38:29] funeral uh it was now in the night and I
[38:32] went to lock the gate the outside gate
[38:34] and then I went back to my mom's house
[38:37] and next door my my my brother obviously
[38:40] married my neighbor so my nephew and
[38:42] niece my brother's kids were were next
[38:44] door and I saw my nephew at that point
[38:47] he was much younger I saw him look up to
[38:50] the sky and he's just staring into the
[38:52] sky and so I asked him why why are you
[38:54] staring into the sky it's night time now
[38:56] and then he just ran away inside the
[38:57] house house so I went inside the house
[39:00] and then he sends me from his mother's
[39:01] WhatsApp he sends me a voice note saying
[39:04] that he could see a man in the sky and
[39:06] and the man is threatening to take his
[39:09] life so now I immediately identified
[39:12] this as a demon Spirit now so I said you
[39:15] know what come I want to pray for you
[39:16] you know to cast out that spirit of fear
[39:18] and all of these things but then when he
[39:20] came so I asked him explain to me what
[39:22] you saw and I remember this is a small
[39:25] child and he says I saw this man in the
[39:28] sky and he has dressed like in a robe
[39:30] and he has carrying a
[39:32] sword and so I asked okay where did he
[39:34] come from and he said no this like a
[39:36] window open in the sky and he came from
[39:38] the sky now remember this is a child but
[39:40] he's talking about a portal of a
[39:41] dimension being opened and a spirit
[39:44] coming down amen coming for his life so
[39:48] anyway I prayed for him and I cast out
[39:50] that Spirit right I left him inside the
[39:53] house I went back outside and I was on
[39:56] the phone with brother
[39:57] and we just talking about what happened
[39:59] and I was just sharing to him what
[40:00] happened with my nephew and as I'm
[40:03] talking on the phone I see this light
[40:05] fly across the sky and it disappears in
[40:07] front of my eye and it goes in the
[40:10] direction of where he says this demon
[40:12] Spirit came now for me I immediately
[40:15] identified as the angel of the Lord
[40:17] coming down after praying to combat the
[40:21] enemy so remember now I'm talking about
[40:24] Daniel and a time where he fasted and
[40:26] prayed and the angel came now and
[40:27] remember Michael also came down to fight
[40:30] demon powers when I got under the same
[40:32] desperation I noticed the same thing
[40:35] happened so you know and here comes the
[40:38] re the rebuke even to myself why do we
[40:41] have to wait for a life and death
[40:42] situation for us to get into that
[40:45] desperation why do we have to wait for
[40:47] things like that to happen to experience
[40:49] the
[40:50] supernatural amen it's proof even in
[40:53] Jesus life even in the prophet's life
[40:55] when they were able to separate
[40:56] themselves
[40:58] and and get into such an atmosphere they
[41:00] were able to connect with another realm
[41:02] amen amen and that realm is left there
[41:05] open the angel is there waiting for us
[41:07] to connect with him but the part is on
[41:09] us to actively
[41:11] press amen the part comes on us Amen to
[41:14] do something about
[41:16] it and amen the prophet thought us these
[41:20] laws and that is why the prophet will go
[41:22] into his quiet time you will find that
[41:24] even on the prophet's honeymoon every
[41:26] year he wouldn't even be home would be
[41:28] out in the woods hunting just so he can
[41:30] get away Amen to connect amen amen that
[41:35] is the sacrifice it takes but we say we
[41:37] want the supernatural to operate in our
[41:39] lives and we want to experience the
[41:41] third pole and all of these things but
[41:43] we we don't want it with the sacrifice
[41:45] that it takes now can you imagine Jesus
[41:49] himself had to do this and the problem
[41:52] of it is some of us are too lazy Amen to
[41:56] press towards the mark of the the high
[41:57] calling and it's it's no coincidence
[42:00] because the spirit of the age of Leia
[42:02] amen his laziness is to put us in a lazy
[42:05] atmosphere a lazy attitude a lazy way
[42:08] about doing things amen it's to get us
[42:11] lukewarm that's the spirit of the
[42:15] age amen and one thing God hates is
[42:18] idleness amen amen
[42:25] amen you know if we look at at the first
[42:27] church and in fact when the prophet is
[42:29] talking about the church
[42:31] ages um and you'll read it in the church
[42:34] age
[42:35] book I need to speed up now so we can
[42:37] get into prayer you'll read it in the in
[42:39] the church ages amen the prophet is
[42:41] about to preach the church ages right
[42:43] this is before the seals is open so this
[42:45] is one of the biggest things of his life
[42:47] that he's about to
[42:48] preach and he says before I go into
[42:51] study in the church ages the first thing
[42:53] I did is I went to God in prayer and I
[42:55] sought the Lord and I sought the Lord
[42:57] and only then I went and studied the
[42:59] scriptures see many of us want to just
[43:01] take the quotes immediately and do
[43:03] everything but the prophet said no we
[43:04] waited upon the Lord first to get the
[43:07] inspiration so he says how did I choose
[43:09] the messengers how did I choose the
[43:10] church ages and separate them he said I
[43:13] use the example of the first church and
[43:15] the first
[43:16] messenger and every other messenger had
[43:19] to follow the example of Paul and every
[43:22] other church had to follow the example
[43:23] of the first church amen amen so he said
[43:26] the true Church in this hour will follow
[43:29] the example of the first Ephesian church
[43:32] so if the Ephesian Church were not lazy
[43:34] they went about from house to house
[43:36] breaking bread amen they were
[43:38] continually in prayer in the service of
[43:40] God then the true church in this hour
[43:42] will be doing the same thing the true
[43:44] true church of the will not be lazy will
[43:46] not be idle but will also be doing the
[43:49] same things now we say we're going to
[43:51] write a book of Acts again but look at
[43:53] their dedication look at their
[43:55] determination to press towards the mark
[43:56] of the High Calling yes amen we need to
[43:59] come Amen to that same motivation that
[44:01] same attitude amen then we can
[44:03] experience the power of God moving in
[44:05] the
[44:06] church and that is why amen Malachi says
[44:10] he comes to turn our hearts back Amen to
[44:12] the faith of the Pentecostal
[44:15] fathers and remember what the Bible says
[44:17] work with faith it's the perseverance
[44:20] the trials that work with these things
[44:24] amen and we should not be caught up Amen
[44:26] in the spirit of Leia why we are eagles
[44:30] we fly high above the things of this
[44:32] world so we don't have to be caught up
[44:34] in the laziness of latera and how the
[44:36] church world is amen and we are caught
[44:38] up in the dright age we are not stuck in
[44:40] lateria amen amen so we should not be
[44:43] stuck in idleness and laziness amen God
[44:46] hates it amen if you look at the amount
[44:49] of scriptures that God speaks against
[44:51] idleness I'll take you through it very
[44:53] quickly just to give you some
[44:54] examples First Timothy the Bible says
[44:57] besides that they learn to be idlers
[45:00] going about from house to house and not
[45:02] only idlers but also gossips and Busy
[45:05] Bodies saying what they should not
[45:07] Proverbs Chapter 19 slothfulness cast
[45:10] into a deep sleep and an idle person
[45:12] will suffer with with Hunger
[45:14] Ecclesiastes says through slots the roof
[45:17] sinks in and through idleness the house
[45:20] leaks amen we're talking about a
[45:21] spiritual house yeah how is the
[45:23] spiritual house the body of Christ
[45:24] leaking through idleness through
[45:26] laziness
[45:27] proverbs 31 says she looks well to the
[45:30] ways of her household and does not eat
[45:32] the bread of idleness Proverbs 13 says
[45:36] the soul of the Slugger craves and gets
[45:38] nothing whilst the soul of the
[45:40] diligently of the diligent is richly
[45:43] supplied 2 Thessalonians 4 even when we
[45:46] were with you we would give you this
[45:49] command if anyone is not willing to work
[45:51] let him not
[45:54] eat amen
[45:57] amen for we hear that some among you
[45:59] walk in idleness not busy at work but
[46:01] busy bodies Proverbs 14 in all toil days
[46:05] profit but mere talk tends only to
[46:09] Poverty amen second Thessalonians now we
[46:12] command you Brothers in the name of our
[46:14] Lord Jesus Christ that you keep away
[46:16] from any brother who is walking in
[46:19] idleness even he's in the message he's
[46:22] talking about a brother yeah if he's
[46:23] walking in idleness the Bible says keep
[46:25] away from him right amen
[46:31] we we always read this scripture Matthew
[46:33] 20:6 now look at it's the 11th Hour of
[46:36] the day and here comes uh the master and
[46:39] he finds someone standing idle and he
[46:41] says unto him why are you standing idle
[46:43] it's the 11th Hour of the day we know
[46:45] it's typing Le it's typing the 11th Hour
[46:47] workers saying why are you standing idle
[46:49] here is my field going work in my
[46:52] field now it's not
[46:54] that this is just some rich I say just
[46:57] go work in my field as as if he's just
[47:00] giving him a chance the reason why he
[47:01] say go work in my field is because the
[47:03] same Master he saying the Harvest is
[47:06] plenty but the laborers are
[47:08] few amen so he's saying there's so much
[47:11] of harvest but I need labors everyone's
[47:13] Idle No one's working but the Harvest is
[47:22] plenty we see Jesus was a worker he was
[47:25] not Idol even at the age of 12 when he
[47:29] his parents was looking for him Mary was
[47:31] looking for him and they said why are
[47:33] you here we've been looking all along
[47:34] for you he said don't you know must be
[47:36] about my father's
[47:37] business so he was not idle he was not
[47:40] lazy from the age of 12 Years about his
[47:42] father's business amen amen now if we
[47:46] are coming to spiritual maturity how
[47:48] much more now we are not 12 years of age
[47:50] we are coming into spiritual maturity
[47:53] how much more we ought to be about our
[47:54] father's business
[47:58] and that is why you know Jesus even in
[48:00] his own
[48:01] Ministry you know he he went through a
[48:04] whole day ministering and praying for
[48:06] the sick and we know how the prophet
[48:08] said virtue was drained out of him and
[48:11] all of these things now remember Jesus
[48:12] was also human so he suffered from
[48:14] headaches and pressure and tension and
[48:16] all of these things but yet despite
[48:18] working the whole day he would go in the
[48:21] night and pray the whole night amen he
[48:24] was not lazy but he knew he had an
[48:26] objective to achieve and he pressed
[48:28] towards that
[48:30] objective amen
[48:33] amen amen I just want to read before we
[48:36] go into prayer I just want to read this
[48:40] quote before we
[48:43] close Prophet is saying that's the kind
[48:46] of men and woman we need to rise on the
[48:48] scene today if he doesn't answer tonight
[48:51] we will he will tomorrow night if he
[48:53] doesn't answer this year he will next
[48:55] year for he is God Amen not a God but
[48:59] the God and we see him night after night
[49:02] as amam climbed the steps talking about
[49:05] Moses parents now and
[49:07] joset uh would come up to him and say
[49:09] amam dear you've been up here praying
[49:12] all night why don't you just tell some
[49:14] of the boys you working with here to let
[49:16] them pray for a while and am would say
[49:19] well honey what if they don't do it
[49:21] somebody has got to do it somebody has
[49:24] got to pray through that's the way every
[49:27] Christian ought to feel tonight not
[49:29] waiting for somebody else but to take
[49:31] the front ourselves and go through if we
[49:34] believe the Bible to be history it's
[49:36] also a prophetic book that tells us that
[49:38] the same God shall rise in the last days
[49:41] and it's time for him to come on the
[49:43] scene amen so don't leave it for someone
[49:46] else is what the prophet is saying he's
[49:48] saying what if you leave it for someone
[49:50] else and they don't do it we got to take
[49:52] up the front ourselves we got to pray
[49:54] through we got to persevere we got to
[49:56] press onto the mark of the High Calling
[49:58] we got to come into the manifestation of
[50:00] sons of God because what if someone else
[50:02] doesn't who is going to fulfill the
[50:04] scripture we've got to take the
[50:06] responsibility and ourselves to obtain
[50:08] amen and to achieve the stature of a
[50:10] perfect man hallelujah amen let's stand

[50:15] are what we're going to pray about

[50:45] we're not going we're not going to be
[50:47] idle anymore amen we're not going to be
[50:49] lazy amen but God wants to work through
[50:51] a bride who's willing to work amen that
[50:54] is why he said if I can just get one
[50:56] person person fully surrendered amen
[50:59] then God can use him amen then God can
[51:02] move amen God wants people amen God
