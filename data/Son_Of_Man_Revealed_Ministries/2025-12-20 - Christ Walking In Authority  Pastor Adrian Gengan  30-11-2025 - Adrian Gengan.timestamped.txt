[0:19] Truly, this morning when I got up, I

[0:55] didn't have fear because I know who I am
[0:58] standing
[0:59] &gt;&gt; and I know
[1:01] when he calls I will answer.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; So I just said Lord I don't know what
[1:07] this is but anyway I just got up. I went
[1:10] to the room came back and I start to
[1:13] pray. I said Lord let your will be done.
[1:16] Whatever it is you are the great
[1:18] physician. So the next morning I phone
[1:21] my daughter and uh I told her this is
[1:25] what happened. She said dad you know I

[1:49] overcome him.

[20:03] Lord Jesus. But Lord, we just treasure
[20:05] it in our hearts, oh God. And Lord, we
[20:08] keep this word in our heart, Lord,
[20:09] knowing that this word will quicken us
[20:11] and change us in the moment, in the
[20:13] twinkling of an eye. We're keeping our
[20:15] eyes fixed on the [music] promise, oh
[20:17] God. And Lord, we are not focused on the
[20:19] things of this world, oh God, but our
[20:21] hearts are fixed heavenly, Lord, and
[20:22] what you are doing for us, oh God. We
[20:24] thank you, the Lord, this morning for
[20:26] every believer that has come into the

[21:05] mighty name. Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I greet you all in the precious

[21:11] Christ.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the King of Kings.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; And he's the Lord of Lords.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Tim. May
[21:20] good to see you here this morning. Amen.
[21:23] May you be blessed in the house of the
[21:24] Lord.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles.
[21:27] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[21:30] Let's go to Ephesians chapter 1.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to speak a little bit on
[21:39] Christ walking in authority.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ walking in authority
[21:47] or if you want to say it, the authority
[21:49] of the believer.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you focus your word
[21:57] when we sing Christ and if you're
[22:00] thinking of Jesus Christ 2,000 years
[22:02] ago, you're going to miss the message
[22:03] this morning.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; So, let's just read from Ephesians
[22:11] chapter 1 and verse 15.
[22:14] Wherefore I also
[22:16] after I heard of your faith in the Lord
[22:18] Jesus and love unto the saints cease not
[22:22] to give thanks for you making mention of
[22:25] you in my prayer.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; So what we're going to look at is two
[22:27] prayers of Paul and see what he's
[22:29] praying for the church. Amen. So we know
[22:32] that Ephesians parallels the book of
[22:35] Joshua.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; This is the land of our inheritance.
[22:38] This is the mature believer. He's saying
[22:40] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[22:42] the father of glory may give unto you.
[22:45] So he's getting something. The spirit of
[22:47] wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[22:50] of him.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; So we have to get the mystery of God.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; That's why Revelation 10:7 had to be
[22:57] fulfilled.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
[23:02] knowledge of him that the eyes of your
[23:04] understanding being enlightened.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So understanding is likening you
[23:09] to eyes. He wants our eyes to get some
[23:11] light, revelation light that you may
[23:14] know what is the hope of his calling,
[23:17] &gt;&gt; what the riches of the glory of his
[23:20] inheritance in the saints.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Now pay attention there and don't glance
[23:24] over it. He wants your eyes to be
[23:27] opened.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; Because there's a calling. There's
[23:31] riches of his glory
[23:34] &gt;&gt; and inheritance in the saints. Where's
[23:36] the inheritance?
[23:38] &gt;&gt; The inheritance is in the saints.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; And what is the exceeding greatness of
[23:44] his power to us?
[23:47] Where's his power directed?
[23:49] &gt;&gt; What is the exceeding greatness of his
[23:51] power to us who believe?
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. according to the working of his
[23:55] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[23:58] when he raised him from the dead and set
[24:01] him at his own right hand in heaven in
[24:03] the heavenly places. Far above
[24:05] principality and power and might and
[24:08] dominion and every name that is named
[24:12] not only in this world but also in that
[24:14] which is to come. and had put all things
[24:17] under his feet,
[24:19] &gt;&gt; and gave him to be the head over all
[24:21] things to the church, which is his body,
[24:25] the fullness of him that fill it all in
[24:27] all. You may be seated. The Lord had
[24:28] blessings to the reading of his word.
[24:30] Let's just drop down there. Amen.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; If we go to Ephesians and verse 14
[24:39] there. Amen.
[24:41] [crying]
[24:42] I think it's chapter is it chapter 2 or
[24:45] three?
[24:47] It says, "For this cause I bow my knees
[24:50] unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[24:52] Christ." So bowing his knee again is a
[24:54] sign of supplication of whom the whole
[24:56] family in heaven and earth is named.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; That he would grant to you again. You
[25:03] want him to give something to us
[25:05] according to the riches of his glory and
[25:07] to be strengthened with might by his by
[25:10] his spirit in the inner man
[25:12] &gt;&gt; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[25:14] faith.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is dwelling in our hearts
[25:18] by faith.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. that he being rooted and grounded
[25:21] in love may be able to comprehend with
[25:24] all saints what is the breadth and
[25:27] length and and depth and height and to
[25:30] know the love of Christ which passeth
[25:33] knowledge that you might be filled with
[25:36] all the fullness of God.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Now unto him that is able to do
[25:40] exceeding abundantly above all we ask or
[25:43] think according to the power that
[25:45] workketh in us. and to him be glory in
[25:49] the church by Jesus Christ throughout
[25:51] all ages, world without end.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the authority of the believer
[25:57] I'm saying Christ walking in authority
[26:00] in me and you.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You know they they
[26:04] came to the Lord the Lord Jesus asked
[26:07] the disciples who do men say that I am.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; He wanted to know what was the opinion
[26:14] of the outside world.
[26:16] And they offered him some answer. But
[26:19] then he asked them, "Who do you say that
[26:21] I am?"
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; The world today has an impression of us.
[26:25] They call us all kinds of names.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; They may label us, but I'm asking you,
[26:29] who do you say that you are?
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; We must have a revelation of who we are.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; So, we're finding the authority of the
[26:41] believer. And it's important. And Paul
[26:43] is saying he wants us to get this
[26:45] revelation
[26:47] because in Ephesians 6:12 he says we
[26:50] wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; We can't be living this life focusing on
[26:58] fighting flesh and blood.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; What is the Apostle Paul saying here? We
[27:02] wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. but against principalities,
[27:08] &gt;&gt; against powers, against rulers of the
[27:11] darkness of this world, against
[27:13] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; So, it's going to be veiled sometimes in
[27:20] a human flesh
[27:21] &gt;&gt; because demon powers possess men.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; But he's saying you got to RECOGNIZE
[27:26] YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING THAT FLESH.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; You are fighting, Amen. principalities.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; You are fighting powers. Yes.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Because where does the final
[27:34] principality and power end up in? It
[27:36] ends up in a man called the antichrist.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Satan himself becomes incarnate.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; In the pope.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; So demon powers are now let loose in
[27:47] bodies of flesh.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; The unredeemed, the lost, and they are
[27:52] making themselves known. But if we are
[27:54] going to try to fight these powers in
[27:56] the flesh, we are going to be defeated.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; This is a spiritual warfare. Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; So the authority
[28:09] is not just the property of a select
[28:11] few.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; The authority of a believer.
[28:15] Sometimes people think oh the authority
[28:17] lays in a minister. The authority lays
[28:19] in the evangelist. The authority lay in
[28:21] the pastor.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the authority is true
[28:26] possession to every child of God.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every child of God possesses
[28:30] authority.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; You can speak to your situation.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; You can speak to your problem.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; You possess the authority.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Christ made it possible for you to speak
[28:40] over your situation
[28:42] &gt;&gt; and get the victory over your
[28:44] circumstance.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:49] Ephesians 1:3.
[28:51] Just want to read this again. Blessed be
[28:53] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[28:55] Christ who had blessed us with all
[28:57] spiritual blessings. Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. Now that word had is
[29:02] a finished.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; It's a past tense.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; So I am not praying to God for spiritual
[29:08] blessings.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yes Lord. Amen.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; I am not praying to God for spiritual
[29:13] blessings.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he hath blessed us with
[29:17] all spiritual blessings.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything. You know the
[29:23] prophet of God would say this.
[29:25] Everything that Christ could ever do for
[29:26] us, he already done it.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; He's already done it.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, he had already
[29:34] blessed us with all spiritual blessings.
[29:37] So, in Christ, all spiritual blessings
[29:40] belong to us.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Now, some may know about it more than
[29:45] others because some walk with this.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Some walk with it.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Some live in it. Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Some experience it.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Because having knowledge alone is not
[29:57] good enough. [applause]
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Paul is praying that you receive
[30:03] knowledge.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; But if you don't walk in it, it's not
[30:05] good enough.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; If I give you a million rand, who wants
[30:10] a million rand in your bank account? You
[30:13] can go and tell everyone you got a
[30:15] million rand, but you could be starving.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; You've got to go to the bank and
[30:20] withdraw the cash.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. and make use of the funds. How many
[30:24] of us are withdrawing from the bank of
[30:26] heaven? The bank of heaven has all
[30:28] spiritual blessings.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know that there is nothing that
[30:34] can defeat the believer?
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing can defeat the
[30:39] believer.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; He says sickness, sorrow, pain, grief,
[30:44] nothing can defeat the believer.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; WE ARE VICTORIOUS IN CHRIST.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YES.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So having knowledge is not good
[30:53] enough. Knowledge acted upon brings the
[30:57] results.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; I can teach you week after week, but if
[31:01] you don't go put into practice what you
[31:03] have been taught, nothing will happen. I
[31:05] can tell you about Mark 11:23. If you
[31:08] say to this mountain, be thou removed,
[31:10] cast into the sea. Don't doubt in your
[31:12] heart, but believe what you have said
[31:14] shall come to pass. But if you don't
[31:16] yourself say to that mountain, if you
[31:18] don't speak to your problem, if you
[31:20] don't speak to your situation, nothing
[31:22] will happen.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus never told, if you put up Mark
[31:25] 11:23, he never told the disciples, pray
[31:27] to me and ask me and I'll speak to your
[31:29] mountain.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; The problem is too many of us are
[31:32] praying to God about our mountains when
[31:34] God said that you must speak to your own
[31:35] mountain.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; We want to go and cry. He didn't say cry
[31:44] to the mountain. He didn't say cry about
[31:46] your problem. He didn't say take your
[31:48] situation into your own hands. He said
[31:50] speak to it. Tell it what to do and tell
[31:53] it where to go.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. [applause]
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not only he says speak to
[31:59] it, he says be thou removed. That is
[32:01] speak into your mountain, but tell it
[32:02] where to go. Go into the sea.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Tell your debt where to go.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Tell your financial troubles where to
[32:12] go. Yes.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; TELL YOUR SICKNESS WHERE TO GO.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Speak to it.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible SAYS ALL CREATION
[32:22] IS WAITING FOR THE manifestation of the
[32:24] sons of God. But the sons of God ARE
[32:26] REMAINING QUIET BECAUSE THEY WANT JESUS
[32:28] CHRIST TO COME BACK physically and do
[32:30] everything for them. But Christ has
[32:32] already risen us up together with him.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; So the dominion and authority now lays
[32:37] in HIS PEOPLE, THE BODY OF CHRIST.
[32:39] HALLELUJAH.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; But that can remain dormant because
[32:42] people are expecting something else
[32:44] which is not in the word.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So knowledge
[32:51] acted upon brings the results and
[32:54] authority belongs to all children of
[32:56] God.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even a young child can speak to
[33:00] their problem. Even a young child can
[33:02] pray about their situation. Even a young
[33:04] child can speak.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is no respector of person.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[33:16] Satan is a deceiver.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; And that's how he works. He come to make
[33:23] you think that you don't have the
[33:24] authority.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; He come and whisper lies to you.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; That you are not you don't have any
[33:31] power, any authority.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; That there's still something further to
[33:35] come.
[33:37] Because as long as he can keep the
[33:38] believer down, defeated.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; To make them think that Christ didn't do
[33:42] it all on Calvary, he can now walk with
[33:45] his own authority.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; He can walk with some kind of power over
[33:49] you.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; To make you believe. You know, some
[33:52] people believe sickness is a blessing
[33:53] from God.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Because they are not convinced that it's
[33:57] the will of God for them to be healed.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; No. You know, this is my lot in life.
[34:05] just live with it.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible says by his stripes you were
[34:10] healed.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; It's God's will for you to be healed.
[34:14] Brother Brandham says unless you have
[34:16] confidence to know what the word is and
[34:18] his word is his will. He says then you
[34:20] can have the confidence to go to God in
[34:22] faith and say Lord this is your word.
[34:25] I'm standing upon your promise and I
[34:27] receive it.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. [applause and cheering]
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people believe it's God's
[34:31] will for them to be in lack.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; But then we know what we're doing. We
[34:35] are taking Gyra and nailing him to the
[34:37] cross.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Do you know believers especially in the
[34:40] message only refer to Jehovah Rafa?
[34:48] &gt;&gt; 99% of the time they'll only speak about
[34:51] Jehovah Rafa.
[34:53] But yet there are seven compound names.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:58] And brother Brandham says he reveals
[35:00] himself first as Gyra.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; THE LORD HIMSELF shall provide.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Now, brother, it's my lot.
[35:12] You sound like Lot.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lot was a lukewarm believer.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing is we don't know
[35:20] our rights.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; We don't know our inheritance. Yes,
[35:24] &gt;&gt; we are thinking just the natural
[35:26] descendants of Abraham are supposed to
[35:28] be blessed.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Do you know what Satan is doing? He's
[35:32] taking all your funds
[35:34] &gt;&gt; that belongs to the children of God and
[35:36] he's distributing it because you don't
[35:38] know how to use it.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; He's taking all the believers blessings
[35:41] and he's offering all his movie stars
[35:43] money.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; He's [clears throat] offering all of it
[35:45] to the world.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; That is why the kingdom of God can't
[35:50] move forward. Do you know why the
[35:52] kingdom of God can't move forward? God
[35:54] needs people like he told the prophet.
[35:57] The prophet attached himself to the
[35:59] Christian businessman's fellowship
[36:00] &gt;&gt; because they were the ones that could
[36:02] fund the evangelism.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; He attached himself to John Shar
[36:07] &gt;&gt; because John Shar was funding him.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; We can't even build churches. Help us
[36:14] Lord. My
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Don is the worst.
[36:19] Praise the Lord.
[36:21] Why? We have not been taught kingdom
[36:24] principles.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Even healing now, we don't want we don't
[36:27] want Rafa because we got medical aid.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; So, science has made it more difficult
[36:33] for people to have faith.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Because now the first thing they have is
[36:37] they pull out their medical aid card.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to see this doctor. And as
[36:41] long as the doctor can relieve the
[36:43] symptoms, they are happy.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; But Jesus doesn't relieve symptoms. Yes.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus paid for your sickness to be
[36:51] healed.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; We are not looking for symptoms
[36:54] believers here.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know in the past if your
[36:58] eyesight was going you had to believe in
[37:00] the Lord and say restore my eyesight?
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Now you go to the optometrist and make
[37:03] him rich. Instead of having the faith to
[37:06] believe that God can restore YOUR
[37:07] EYESIGHT, IF GOD CAN HEAL A BLIND MAN,
[37:11] &gt;&gt; if God can give a BLIND MAN BACK NEW
[37:13] EYEBALLS,
[37:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS GOD TO TOUCH FIBERS IN YOUR
[37:16] EYESIGHT, to give light to your
[37:18] eyesight? He said, "Greater works in
[37:21] thee shall he do."
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; We are looking FOR PEOPLE OF RUGGED
[37:28] FAITH.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; I'M not looking for mustard seed faith
[37:30] Christians. mustard seed faith in this
[37:32] time and hour in the hour of perfect
[37:34] faith.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; We're playing around with the gospel.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we're playing around
[37:41] with the message of the hour.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T REALIZE THE POWER THAT'S LAYING
[37:44] IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WE DON'T
[37:46] REALIZE THE AUTHORITY THAT'S LAYING IN
[37:47] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WE TALK ABOUT
[37:49] THIRDP but we never see a manifestation.
[37:52] We talk about thirdp and we [applause]
[37:54] referencing the 60s. We talk about
[37:56] thirdp and say wait until I say I AM NOT
[37:59] WAITING. ALL OF GOD'S PROMISES ARE YES
[38:01] and amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; I have the faith to believe it. I'm
[38:04] going to put my faith into action.
[38:05] [applause]
[38:06] AND BY GOD'S GRACE, we are already
[38:08] seeing it. Somebody give God praise.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sickness can't stand.
[38:14] DISEASE CAN'T STAND. PROMISE CAN'T STAND
[38:16] BEFORE YOU. YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. THE
[38:18] VESTED AUTHORITY OF HEAVEN IS REIGN IN
[38:21] YOU.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Many amen. So don't just take Rafa
[38:29] only.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Take Gyra.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; TAKE SHALOM. OH, I HAVE A TROUBLED MIND.
[38:37] JESUS SAID, "I'VE COME TO BIND up the
[38:38] broken ass.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; I've come to set at liberty those that
[38:42] are captive." AMEN.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST HAS COME TO DO IT ALL. AND
[38:45] HE'S ALREADY DONE IT ALL. AND HE'S
[38:47] ALREADY SEATED TOGETHER IN HEAVENLY
[38:49] PLACES in Christ Jesus.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. John 8:32. Amen. Jesus says, "You
[38:59] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[39:02] make you free."
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not just the truth. We
[39:07] all believe we got the truth in the
[39:08] message of the hour. HE SAYS, "KNOW THE
[39:10] TRUTH."
[39:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; And knowing THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; How come we some some PEOPLE ARE SO
[39:17] BOUND SO BOUND BY SITUATIONS, SO
[39:20] DEFEATED BY SITUATIONS?
[39:25] HALLELUJAH.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible SAYS WE ARE MORE THAN
[39:28] CONQUERORS.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; We are more than conquerors in Christ.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; We are overcomers.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; People think they're going to drag
[39:38] themselves into heaven. Yeah. You're not
[39:40] going to make it into heaven as a
[39:42] survivor.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; We are not going to make it into heaven
[39:47] as a survivor.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; They're not going to be dragging you
[39:51] through the gates there.
[39:53] We got one survival year out of latest
[39:55] year.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; We are going out of here victorious.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the people that were
[40:03] destined in the mind of God to have a
[40:05] body change.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; We were the people of perfect faith.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; We are the people that God has chosen IN
[40:10] THIS HOUR NOT TO BE DEFEATED by the
[40:12] enemy, not to be WEIGHED DOWN BY
[40:14] CIRCUMSTANCE. AMEN. RISE ABOVE YOUR
[40:16] CIRCUMSTANCE. RISE ABOVE YOUR PROBLEM.
[40:18] AMEN. RISE ABOVE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE
[40:21] TRYING TO WEIGH YOU DOWN.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know what the
[40:26] problem is? We're trying to live by
[40:27] feelings. We were not designed TO LIVE
[40:29] BY FEELINGS.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; FEELINGS are made and designed, Amen. to
[40:32] contact a certainly home.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; You can't move by feelings in the things
[40:36] of God.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; In fact, the things of God will make you
[40:38] act crazy.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; The things of God will make you do
[40:43] ridiculous things.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. How many of you know the story
[40:48] John Ryan?
[40:50] &gt;&gt; We all know the story, right?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; We all know it worked for John Ryan,
[40:53] right?
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; How many of us are daily confessing,
[40:57] "Praise God, I'm healed." Yet, you know,
[40:58] you're
[40:58] &gt;&gt; sick.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; How many of us are daily saying it?
[41:01] Praise God, I'm healed. Praise God, I'm
[41:04] healed. But we do it one day, we do two
[41:06] days, but we love John Ryan's story,
[41:09] &gt;&gt; but we never think it will work for us.
[41:16] Hallelujah.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; We never think it'll work for us. We
[41:23] like it as a story. John Ryan said,
[41:26] "Praise God, I'm healed."
[41:28] &gt;&gt; But for us,
[41:29] &gt;&gt; are we applying the word daily?
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed. Say it for one
[41:36] week. Say it for two weeks. Say it for 3
[41:38] weeks. Say it for four weeks. Say it for
[41:41] 6 months. Say it for one year until you
[41:43] receive it, until you believe in your
[41:45] heart that you ARE HEALED. HOW ABOUT
[41:47] YOUR loved ones?
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Some of you get excited here because I'm
[41:50] forcing you to lay your token over your
[41:52] loved ones, over your unbelieving
[41:54] family, over your daughters, over your
[41:55] sons, over your faith. You get excited
[41:57] in the church only when you go out. Hey,
[41:59] there's counsel. These people, hey, they
[42:01] don't listen. Very naughty people. This
[42:04] &gt;&gt; you're not laying your token.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; What did Raab say?
[42:07] &gt;&gt; I want all my loved ones to come under
[42:09] my token. Amen.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, people say, "Oh, brother, you
[42:13] preaching a name it and claim it
[42:14] gospel." I believe a name it and claim
[42:16] it gospel because God named the light
[42:18] and it came.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; God named the sun and it came.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; God named the moon and it [applause]
[42:22] came.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; And God told name what you want.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Ah, come on somebody.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Did God tell Abra tellite name what you
[42:33] want?
[42:33] &gt;&gt; She named it and she claimed it. Yeah.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Joshua named the sun. Sun stand still.
[42:42] Moon, you stand still.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; The authority lay in your mouth. But too
[42:47] many people are weighed under the
[42:48] circumstance, weighed by situations that
[42:51] they are defeated. Why? They're
[42:52] operating by the spirit, the flesh.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; We need to rise above our circumstance.
[43:00] Tell the devil where to get off.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. THIS MAN WAS RUNNING AND RUNNING.
[43:04] Says the devil IS ON THE RUN. HE SAID,
[43:05] "WHERE?" HEY, he's chasing me.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; That's the only time people see the
[43:10] devil on the run. The devil is chasing
[43:12] them instead of them chasing the devil.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around.
[43:21] Turn around and face the devil later on.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Let him recognize who you are.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Devil running rampant in your
[43:30] house.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Devil running rampant. Did you ever face
[43:32] him and tell him, "Listen here. It stops
[43:34] today. That's
[43:35] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; You've you've handled this thing for too
[43:40] long.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Today, it stops.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you notice.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; But you got to know who you are.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said, "Whatever you bind
[43:49] on earth."
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; You mean you're allowing demon powers,
[43:51] small little powers who have no
[43:53] authority over you to run rampant in
[43:56] your life. When Jesus said, "If you bind
[43:57] it on earth, I'll bind it in heaven."
[43:59] &gt;&gt; "And if you lose things on earth, I'll
[44:00] loose it in heaven."
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You mean you can lose the
[44:03] salvation of your loved ones on earth?
[44:07] [clears throat]
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Luke 10:19. [crying]
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I have given you." Luke
[44:22] 10:19. Amen. Let's read this together.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Behold, I give unto you power,
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. to thread on serpents and
[44:32] scorpions. Now these serpents and
[44:34] scorpions are not what you are thinking.
[44:37] It's not these animals, right?
[44:39] &gt;&gt; He's going to detail what it is. And
[44:42] over all the power of the enemy. These
[44:44] are demon powers.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; He's referring to demon powers.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; And nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice here, there's two
[44:54] powers there.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:58] the power that Jesus is saying he's
[44:59] giving us.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; And then there's the power of the enemy.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Now, if you go and read the Greek in
[45:06] that, the first word power should be
[45:09] translated as, I have given you
[45:11] authority.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; If you go and read other translations,
[45:18] it'll show you there the Greek word.
[45:20] Behold, I GIVE YOU AUTHORITY.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY POWER IN
[45:24] OURSELVES. THE ONLY POWER WE HAVE IS THE
[45:27] POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; I give to you AUTHORITY TO TREAD UPON
[45:35] serpents
[45:37] &gt;&gt; and scorpions and over all the power of
[45:40] the enemy, and nothing shall by any
[45:42] means hurt you.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; You know what he's saying? Trample these
[45:46] enemies.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; These enemies can't hurt you.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus is TELLING YOU TO WALK ALL OVER
[45:51] the enemy.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus is telling you to crush the enemy.
[45:54] Amen.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; HE'S SAYING THEY CAN'T HURT YOU. I'VE
[45:56] GIVEN YOU THE AUTHORITY.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; How many of you know the bullies in
[45:59] school?
[46:00] &gt;&gt; They come and eat you.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; I know some of you you're digging down
[46:04] memory lanes now. You're getting sad.
[46:06] You're remembering how they caught you
[46:07] and they eat you. Then you ran home to
[46:09] your brother and you told your brother
[46:12] and your brother came there and he held
[46:14] him.
[46:18] He held them
[46:20] &gt;&gt; and he told you to give him.
[46:22] That's what Jesus is telling you here.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; I've held these demon powers.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; You say they're not holding. Yeah,
[46:32] they're holding. Go read Revelation 7.
[46:34] Angels hold back the winds, wars, and
[46:36] strife.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; What are these demon powers? Amen. Hold
[46:39] it back.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Why? For the Jews.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; That's for the Jews. Where's our one?
[46:45] Our one is Revelation 10. One foot on
[46:47] land, one foot on sea. Because if you
[46:50] read Revelation 13, there's a beast
[46:51] rising out of the land. There's a beast
[46:53] rising out of the sea. So the mighty
[46:54] angel comes to suppress these two powers
[46:57] because the wife of the Lord Jesus
[46:58] Christ IS ON THE EARTH AND NOTHING shall
[47:00] be able to harm her as long as she's on
[47:02] the earth. So he has come and put one
[47:04] foot on land, ONE FOOT ON SEA, SUPPRESS
[47:06] THESE POWERS.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; And he's now GIVING YOU THE TITLE TO THE
[47:11] EARTH.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; HE BRINGS IT DOWN SUPPRESSING HIS
[47:14] POWERS. HE GIVES IT TO YOU. HE SAYS,
[47:15] "TAKE THE BOOK. EAT THE BOOK. THE
[47:17] AUTHORITY IS NOW IN YOU.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; I've given you authority.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; That authority. If you keep the word
[47:30] power, Amen. Like we said, it's author.
[47:32] The word power, there is authority. You
[47:35] know why? If you say the word power,
[47:36] people say, "Oh, I just feel weak. I
[47:39] don't feel like I got any power." You
[47:41] don't fight him from your flesh.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; You fight him from this inner man. Yeah,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; you strengthen yourself on the inner
[47:47] man. You know the if the traffic lights
[47:49] go out, they call a policeman.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Most of I haven't seen SAPS on on duty
[47:55] at traffic lights. I only see metro.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; It's only SAPS only metro allowed. So
[48:03] you see even there there's certain
[48:04] jurisdiction. SAPS can't go there the
[48:07] robot and make this like this. Only
[48:09] metro can do it.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The authority has been
[48:13] given to them. So traffic light goes
[48:15] out.
[48:18] You can't go past the traffic light if
[48:20] the officer raises his hand.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; What makes you stop your car?
[48:26] &gt;&gt; You recognize the authority
[48:28] &gt;&gt; that he carries.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; So you stop your car
[48:34] &gt;&gt; because that police officer has
[48:35] authority.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:41] So all he has to do is hold up his hand
[48:42] and everyone will stop.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; But he don't have power to hold back the
[48:50] cars. [clears throat]
[48:54] &gt;&gt; I seen some policemen,
[48:57] these taxis don't listen to anyone.
[49:00] They don't recognize authority.
[49:04] That police officer saying, "Stop. That
[49:05] fell is going,
[49:08] you can't do any. You got no power now
[49:09] to go stop the taxi and pull it back.
[49:13] What it's requiring is for the other
[49:14] person to recognize your authority.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a law-abiding citizen
[49:21] &gt;&gt; who can recognize your authority.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something, the most
[49:25] lawabiding
[49:27] power of force is demon powers. Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; When you tell them go,
[49:33] &gt;&gt; they recognize the authority and they
[49:35] go.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Even at your presence coming there, they
[49:39] start to tremble.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see, we got to personalize
[49:43] things as well.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; We know that demon powers tremble at the
[49:46] name of Jesus.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Where is Jesus?
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Who carries the vested name of Jesus?
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Who carries the married name of Jesus?
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; So, they recognize you coming. You know,
[49:57] they saw Jesus coming there. those demon
[49:59] powers
[50:00] &gt;&gt; to set that man free. He was bound in
[50:01] chains
[50:02] &gt;&gt; and they said, "Oh, you come to torment
[50:04] us."
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Why don't you let us go into the pits?
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Go."
[50:10] &gt;&gt; They recognize the authority.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[50:17] &gt;&gt; We need to speak and tell the demon
[50:20] powers, I'm a son of God.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; I've been washed by the blood of Jesus.
[50:24] Not only I've been washed by the blood,
[50:26] you know, some people like to stay at
[50:27] the cross.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; The cross was no sign of victory.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; The tomb, the empty tomb is a sign of
[50:36] victory.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't get quiet on me.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; You got to start at the cross.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] you can't sleep at
[50:43] the cross.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; The gospel must progress.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; You can't stay at the cross.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; You've got to progress. Same way you
[50:51] can't stay at justification. You've got
[50:52] to progress. Yes.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we'll be religious people.
[50:55] Oh, I love justification. I love
[50:57] justification.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; You got to move on.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; We couldn't stay at the cross. Jesus was
[51:03] not at the cross.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; They laid Jesus in the tomb.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Then he rose up. I showed it to you.
[51:10] Acts chapter one there. Amen. I think
[51:12] it's verse
[51:14] maybe 5, six, seven, somewhere there.
[51:16] What is Jesus is ascending up to heaven.
[51:20] You think it's a notable thing for
[51:22] somebody to even want to behold these
[51:24] things.
[51:26] Amen. Acts chapter one. You'll think
[51:29] it's it's a MARVELOUS THING FOR US TO
[51:31] BEHOLD this thing and to stay a little
[51:33] while here.
[51:36] Amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Why stand Yeah. Uh Jesus is going up to
[51:40] heaven and the angel says, "Why standing
[51:42] gazing?"
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't this be a marvelous thing to
[51:48] behold?
[51:49] Shouldn't this be something to record? I
[51:52] don't want to miss this event. Jesus
[51:54] ascends up to heaven and the angel, you
[51:57] men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up
[52:00] into heaven.
[52:03] The same Jesus which is taken up from
[52:05] you into heaven shall also come in like
[52:07] manner as you see him go to heaven. So
[52:09] he's telling them don't stay at THE
[52:11] CROSS.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; DON'T STAY NOW at the ascension. Go to
[52:15] Pentecost.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pentecost is the next scene in the
[52:20] drama.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; But some people are looking with a rear
[52:26] view mirror. [clears throat]
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Don't stay at the cross.
[52:33] Come to the EMPTY TOMB.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; DON'T STAY AT THE EMPTY TOMB.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Go and see HIS ASCENSION.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; DON'T STAY AT THE ASCENSION.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; GO TO PENTECOST.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN DON'T STAY AT PENTECOST.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Come now to the REVEALING OF THE WORD.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Four riders. Amen. Went forth and and
[52:55] ate the tree, the bright TREE DOWN.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAYS, I WILL RESTORE. SAY THE
[53:00] LORD.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE. SAY THE LORD.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; I gave that word over the church that I
[53:05] will restore, SAY THE LORD. GOD IS
[53:07] RESTORING YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS, your lost
[53:09] family members. But you know what crazy
[53:11] faith will do? Crazy faith will make you
[53:13] go and print that SCRIPTURE AND PUT IT
[53:15] ALL over the place where you can see AND
[53:17] SAY ALL THE YEARS THE LOCUST HAS EATEN,
[53:20] THE POWER HAS EATEN, THE CATERPILLAR HAS
[53:22] EATEN, THE LOCUST has eaten. I WILL
[53:24] RESTORE, SAY THE LORD. THAT'S WHAT FAITH
[53:26] CAN DO.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; LORD, thank you Lord.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what radical faith will do.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; If you're trusting THE LORD FOR
[53:38] PROVISION, ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE.
[53:41] Seek and you shall find. KNOCK AND THE
[53:43] DOOR SHALL be open.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what you start doing if
[53:46] you're unemployed? You go and apply for
[53:47] every job whether you qualified for it
[53:49] or not.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Lord
[53:50] &gt;&gt; because you are saying I must knock.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Promotion cometh from the Lord,
[53:55] &gt;&gt; not from any man.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Promote. Amen. Radical faith will make
[54:02] you print, ask and you shall receive. If
[54:04] you say to this mountain, it'll make you
[54:06] start to print these things and place it
[54:08] in front of you in your bedroom, in your
[54:10] kitchen, in your lounge. Amen.
[54:13] Hallelujah. You are not concerned about
[54:14] what people think about you. You are
[54:16] only there, Amen. to receive the
[54:18] promised WORD OF THE HOUR AND LET THE
[54:20] promised word of the hour come to pass.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is not a complicated thing.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; We make it complicated.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] Hallelujah.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know God must first reveal his
[54:36] promise in order for you to have faith
[54:38] in it?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; That's why he revealed his word.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know God must first reveal the
[54:48] promised word. He's not expecting you to
[54:49] believe nothing.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; If you go to uh Genesis chapter 12
[54:52] there, you'll see God is telling
[54:55] Abraham, "Come,
[54:57] leave your land. I'll take you to a
[55:00] land."
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:03] See, Abraham just sitting one day wake
[55:05] up and say, you know what, I believe
[55:08] there's a God and I believe if I leave
[55:10] my father's house,
[55:13] the Lord will bless me. No, God must
[55:16] reveal himself first.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; God will reveal his word first.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Then he takes our faith to follow.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get
[55:27] thee out of thy country,
[55:29] &gt;&gt; out of thy kindred." Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; From thy father's house unto a land I
[55:34] will show thee.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; And I will make of thee a great nation,
[55:39] and I will bless thee,
[55:41] &gt;&gt; and make thy name great, and thou shalt
[55:43] be a blessing.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful promise.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; I ask you, who wouldn't leave and go for
[55:49] this?
[55:50] &gt;&gt; This is the God of heaven making a
[55:52] promise to you.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; He's telling you, leave your father's
[55:54] house.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Come, I'll bless you. I'll make you a
[55:57] great nation. We hear you worshiping
[56:00] idols. Your name is nothing here. If you
[56:02] follow me, I'll make you a great nation.
[56:05] I will bless you. I will make your name
[56:07] great and thou shalt be a blessing.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if you wouldn't have
[56:13] followed this.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; I said raise it if you wouldn't follow
[56:17] [laughter] it.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't follow this with the jack?
[56:21] Would you follow that?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; What favor? What grace?
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you know that you are
[56:28] partakers of this through Christ.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Through the royal seed of Abraham, Jesus
[56:33] Christ.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU ARE BLESSED WITH FAITHFUL
[56:36] ABRAHAM.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says Abraham believed God
[56:41] &gt;&gt; and it was accounted unto him for
[56:42] righteousness.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Now God asked you to leave every
[56:46] Methodist church.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Every Anglican church,
[56:49] &gt;&gt; every Catholic church, every Hindu
[56:51] religion, every Tamil religion.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. HE ASKED YOU TO COME OUT OF HER MY
[56:55] PEOPLE and be not partakers of her sins
[56:58] and a place and you listened to that
[57:01] voice and you left it and you followed
[57:02] it and there's a BLESSING ATTACHED TO
[57:04] IT.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'VE GOT TO LIVE IN OUR
[57:09] INHERITANCE.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN INHERITANCE. THE INHERITANCE
[57:13] IS IN THE SAINTS.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE IT AND RISE
[57:17] UP.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know Satan is mad now
[57:27] &gt;&gt; because Satan hates revelation.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what we're doing is we
[57:31] empowering the believer by making us
[57:33] realize who we are in Christ.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; And Satan hates revelation.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's just get to a
[57:39] quote. Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you love the prophet
[57:44] of God?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just read here.
[57:51] Amen.
[57:53] If you can just find this quote for me,
[57:55] brother. Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Just type up there. Satan will be
[58:00] powerless.
[58:04] Satan will be powerless. That's in the
[58:06] church age book.
[58:11] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[58:20] Let's go up a bit.
[58:24] Now remember the Christ in the true
[58:27] church is a continuation of the book of
[58:28] acts.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; To continue from the book of acts means
[58:33] I must go past acts was somebody say
[58:35] pentecost.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Pentecost.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Everyone everyone agree.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Nobody's agreeing here.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Pentecost.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Acts was Pentecost.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Some people feel like I'm going to trap
[58:48] you now. You don't want to answer me.
[58:50] [laughter]
[58:52] Acts was [clears throat] Pentecost.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Now just say Pentecost was Peter
[58:57] Marsburg
[58:59] and your destination is Durban.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; You must continue past Peter Marsburg
[59:06] &gt;&gt; to get to Durban. See already some
[59:08] people don't want to agree. Now you're
[59:09] going into your shell. Please come out.
[59:13] Because people think Pentecost is the
[59:15] end result.
[59:17] Hallelujah. Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; It was justification, sanctification,
[59:23] that's Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and
[59:25] then now into the formed word image.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I am the formed word image. If you
[59:30] don't want to say it, I am the formed
[59:31] word image.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; I am Christ on display now.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, I am
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; The formed word image.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I am.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; I am Christ.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Christ makes you, the prophet says,
[59:45] Christ in you makes you the central
[59:46] theme of the revelation. Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; That's in Christ the mystery.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; You become the central theme.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; All creation is now
[59:54] &gt;&gt; focused on you. You are the central
[59:56] theme.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing can happen on the earth without
[59:58] you.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; That's great. So everybody agree that if
[1:00:02] Pentecost was Peter Marsburg and our
[1:00:04] destination is Durban, we must continue
[1:00:06] past
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; continue
[1:00:09] continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:00:11] Continue.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the book of Revelation shows
[1:00:15] how the Antichrist spirit will come into
[1:00:18] the church, defile it, making it
[1:00:20] lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; It exposes Satan.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Right. How many of you know the seals
[1:00:28] exposed Satan?
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Right. So, we're reading with
[1:00:30] understanding.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; It exposed Satan.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Revealing his works. Right. What is his
[1:00:37] works? His work is to attempt the
[1:00:40] destruction of God's people and
[1:00:42] discrediting of God's word.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's Satan's works. He despis
[1:00:46] discredits God's word. Right?
[1:00:50] So he fights that. He cannot stand it.
[1:00:53] He knows that if the people get a true
[1:00:55] revelation, now watch this. Pay
[1:00:56] attention to this.
[1:00:58] He is not saying if they get a true
[1:01:00] revelation
[1:01:02] of who the Ora is.
[1:01:06] Hey.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; People have a revelation of who the
[1:01:11] outright is. They even know the
[1:01:12] antichrist.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Probably the pope walking past you will
[1:01:15] call him names and say you're the
[1:01:16] antichrist. You're a deceiver.
[1:01:20] But if you go slightly up there, let's
[1:01:22] read again.
[1:01:24] Right. Further,
[1:01:29] it exposes Satan. But exposing Satan
[1:01:32] doesn't make him powerless.
[1:01:35] Read the quote with understanding.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Four horse riders, four seals were
[1:01:40] revealed and he didn't make Satan
[1:01:42] powerless.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody agree?
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Four stages of the ride.
[1:01:50] He's riding in the fourth horse doesn't
[1:01:52] you having the revelation of him riding
[1:01:55] the fourth horse doesn't make him
[1:01:56] powerless.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Can I get somebody to say amen?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; So let's see what makes him powerless.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Go down now.
[1:02:04] He cannot stand it. He knows if the
[1:02:06] people get a true revelation of the true
[1:02:09] church.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; So matter no matter what he is doing,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; no matter if you get an understanding of
[1:02:16] what he is doing, you must get an
[1:02:18] understanding of what God is doing
[1:02:19] through you.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; True revelation of the true church and
[1:02:24] what she is.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; I am Christ.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; What she stands for.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; And that she can do the greater works.
[1:02:40] [applause]
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; I am here to do the greater works.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; I am here to do the greater works.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; If Jesus said in St. John 14:12, greater
[1:02:50] works than these shall he do, for I go
[1:02:53] unto my father, I am destined. My gene
[1:02:56] seed is designed for me to come and
[1:02:58] stand here and do the greater works.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; I say IT WITHOUT RESERVATION. I SAY
[1:03:02] WITHOUT HESITATION, it is Christ in ME
[1:03:04] THE HOPE OF GLORY.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; SHE WILL BE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AN ARMY THAT'S UNSTOPPABLE.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Cannot be defeated. Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the two
[1:03:21] spirits
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; within the framework of the Christian
[1:03:23] church and by God's spirit can discern
[1:03:26] and withstand the antichrist spirit,
[1:03:28] Satan will be powerless before her.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; He will definitely be thwarted as when
[1:03:34] Christ withtood his every effort to gain
[1:03:36] power over him in the desert. Satan
[1:03:39] hates revelation but we love it. with
[1:03:42] revelation in our lives. The gates of
[1:03:44] hell cannot prevail against us, but we
[1:03:47] will prevail OVER THEM.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; OH, SOMEBODY REALLY UNDERSTANDING.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOUR LOVED ONES ARE TRAPPED BEHIND
[1:03:53] THE GATES of hell.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Is somebody hearing this?
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; YOUR LOVED ONES ARE TRAPPED behind the
[1:03:58] gates of hell.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Your health is TRAPPED BEHIND THE GATES
[1:04:01] OF HELL.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; YOUR FINANCES ARE TRAPPED BEHIND the
[1:04:04] gates of hell.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; But there's an advancing army, an
[1:04:07] invincible army that are pounding the
[1:04:09] gates of hell. AND THE GATES OF HELL
[1:04:12] CAN'T PREVAIL AGAINST YOU. THE GATES OF
[1:04:15] HELL ARE too weak for you. YOU ARE LIKE
[1:04:17] SAMSON. YOU PICK UP THE GATES OF HELL
[1:04:19] AND YOU SAY, "LET MY PEOPLE GO." YOU
[1:04:22] SAY, "LET MY LOVED ONES GO. LET MY
[1:04:25] HEALTH GO. [cheering] LET MY FINANCES
[1:04:27] GO. Let my son go. Speak the word and go
[1:04:30] forward." [applause and cheering]
[1:04:31] Hallelujah. God has got his church now.
[1:04:35] God has GOT HIS CHURCH NOW. HE'S
[1:04:36] TRAINING THEM. YOU SAY, "GOD IS TRAINING
[1:04:38] THEM NOW. GOD TRAINS. AMEN. OUR GOD
[1:04:42] TRAINS US.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T JUST LET THE CHILDREN OF
[1:04:44] ISRAEL WALK AROUND JERICHO ONCE
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ON THE FIRST DAY IT MUST HAVE
[1:04:49] SEEMED STRANGE FOR THEM TO walk around
[1:04:51] Jericho.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; So he make them get accustomed to
[1:04:54] walking around the wall.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; GET FAMILIAR WITH YOUR TERRITORY.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; GET FAMILIAR with the enemy.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Walk around it again the second time.
[1:05:02] BUT ON THAT SEVENTH DAY,
[1:05:03] [applause and cheering] WALK AROUND THIS
[1:05:04] wall seven times. Amen. Seven times.
[1:05:09] Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW YOU MUST GO AND CLAIM
[1:05:12] EVERYTHING that God has given you? EVERY
[1:05:14] PROMISE IN THIS BOOK, YOU MUST GO AND
[1:05:16] POSSESS IT.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; When they heard they were coming, Jero
[1:05:19] didn't open up the gates and put out a
[1:05:21] welcome mat and say, "Welcome, come take
[1:05:23] over the city." They had to FIGHT FOR
[1:05:25] EVERY INCH OF GROUND. BUT they went to
[1:05:27] take over the land of AI. Amen. And
[1:05:29] that's what believers in this end time
[1:05:30] will do. We will take over the land of
[1:05:32] AI because they are artificial
[1:05:34] intelligence AND WE ARE SUPREME
[1:05:36] INTELLIGENCE.
[1:05:38] WONDERFUL. [applause] AMEN.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Artificial intelligence can't defeat
[1:05:43] supreme intelligence.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you one of the easiest WAYS TO TO
[1:05:47] DEFEAT ARTIFIC artificial intelligence
[1:05:49] no matter how advanced it gets. You want
[1:05:51] to know?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; I'll turn off the power.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; They are depending on electricity.
[1:05:59] [applause]
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Battery power can only last
[1:06:03] so long.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] You need God's power.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Do you know they can't define what
[1:06:08] electricity is?
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Science can't really define what
[1:06:13] electricity is.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; They know how to harness it power. They
[1:06:16] know how to use it, but they don't know
[1:06:18] where it come from.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; How many of you know the word eel means
[1:06:22] God?
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's why they named it L.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Electricity.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; They know it's God's power.
[1:06:30] [clears throat]
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:06:34] Oh, wonderful.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So, no matter how advanced science get,
[1:06:37] they can't defeat God and his people.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bring this to a close now.
[1:06:42] Amen. How many of you enjoying the word?
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say, "Let's give the
[1:06:48] devil a knockout punch."
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:07:00] Ephesians 6 and 10. So just finishing
[1:07:03] the thought on the policeman. Where does
[1:07:05] the authority of the policeman come
[1:07:06] from? It's delegated to him.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; He's given a badge. [snorts]
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; You going to read Ephesians 6, you'll
[1:07:12] see that finally, my brethren, be strong
[1:07:15] in the Lord.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And in the power of his might.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; The scripture does not say be strong in
[1:07:21] yourself.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Why are we trying to fight our own
[1:07:23] battles? What is it saying? Be strong in
[1:07:25] who?
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Lord.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Be strong in the Lord.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Where is the believer? Somebody say in
[1:07:31] Christ.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; In Christ
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; sitting in heavenly places.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; He's in Christ. Be strong in the Lord
[1:07:38] and in the power of his might.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. All I have IS THE AUTHORITY. THE
[1:07:43] POWER IS LAYING IN HIM.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; The might is laying in him.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am not trying to be strong.
[1:07:51] Amen. Hallelujah. It never said a word
[1:07:54] about you trying to be strong.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; It never said a WORD ABOUT YOU FIXING
[1:07:57] your problems.
[1:08:02] Amen. When you can be strong in the
[1:08:04] Lord,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; that's God's dedicated authority to you.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:11] Yet bless us with all spiritual
[1:08:13] blessings in Christ. Be strong in the
[1:08:15] Lord. The value of your authority
[1:08:18] depends on the force of the power that's
[1:08:20] backing you.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; You see, there are many countries in the
[1:08:27] world
[1:08:29] But if South Africa try and flex its
[1:08:31] muscles against the US,
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; it doesn't have a good force behind it.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; They can b like a Chihuahua.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; But there's a greater force behind the
[1:08:42] USA
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; in military might.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; You you understanding what this is?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; The value of the authority or the level
[1:08:54] of authority depends on the forcets
[1:08:56] behind the user.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; The policeman has all the state metro
[1:09:06] backing him up.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; We have got all of heaven backing us up.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know why
[1:09:19] the Bible says all hell was poured out
[1:09:21] on the earth?
[1:09:27] Satan knows if you don't leave hell and
[1:09:31] come on the earth, he'll never have a
[1:09:33] chance at you.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "I defeated certain people." He
[1:09:46] named names.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "But there's one group of
[1:09:49] people."
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; That that will escape me.
[1:09:54] Come on, say that.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; There's one group of people
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; that will not even taste death.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; There there's one group of people
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; That the the Bible says they're going to
[1:10:08] be changed in the moment, in the
[1:10:09] twinkling of an eye.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; I've got to get to the earth to see
[1:10:12] these people.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Satan came on the earth and he brought
[1:10:16] all of hell on the earth
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; to try and have a go at you now.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of the promise in the word
[1:10:22] that you shall not fall as e fell.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; You will not fall like e fell.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Your gene seed can withstand the
[1:10:32] deception.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Of the enemy.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, amen. The believer is
[1:10:40] conscious of the divine power behind him
[1:10:42] and and of his own authority can face
[1:10:44] any enemy without fear
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; or without hesitation. Let's read John
[1:10:48] 4:4. Let's see what John 4:4 is saying.
[1:10:57] What? Sorry. One John 1 John 4.
[1:11:05] You are of God, little children, and
[1:11:08] have overcome them. Who's the them?
[1:11:11] Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; You are of God, little children, and are
[1:11:18] overcoming them.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Am I reading right?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; And are overcoming them?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Are going to overcome them?
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; You are of God's little children and
[1:11:32] have
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; overcome them.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; YOU ALREADY HAVE OVERCOME THEM.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:40] Because greater is he
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; that is in you.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Than he THAT IS IN THE WORLD.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; I HAVE already overcome autism.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; I have already overcome cancer.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; I have ALREADY OVERCOME HEART DISEASE.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Because greater is he that is in me
[1:12:00] [applause and cheering]
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Greater is he that's in
[1:12:09] me. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to exercise. Amen. Praise
[1:12:14] the Lord. We've got to exercise our
[1:12:15] faith. He doesn't say you're going to
[1:12:17] overcome them. He doesn't say, "I'm
[1:12:19] trying to overcome."
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; That's the problem with [clears throat]
[1:12:21] people. I'm trying, brother. You know,
[1:12:23] I'm trying because they don't want to
[1:12:24] surrender.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; So, they keep trying. They keep trying.
[1:12:28] They think their works are going to gain
[1:12:30] them something. When Christ already did
[1:12:32] it FOR YOU, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
[1:12:33] SURRENDER to his will, to his purpose.
[1:12:36] Amen. Hallelujah. It is Christ in you.
[1:12:38] The hope of glory indwelling you. Amen.
[1:12:41] Through the person and the power of the
[1:12:43] Holy Spirit.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; He already overcame all of them.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; And he gives you the authority. Somebody
[1:12:51] say, "Christ gave me the authority."
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Christ gave you the authority.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Matthew 28:18. Amen. Matthew chapter
[1:12:58] 28:18.
[1:12:59] And Jesus came.
[1:13:03] And Jesus came and spake unto them,
[1:13:05] saying, All power
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; All power.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; All power
[1:13:22] is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Now, that same word power is authority
[1:13:27] in the Greek.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; All authority
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Now immediately
[1:13:37] when Jesus ascended to heaven, he
[1:13:39] transferred that authority.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; He transferred the authority.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; To the ones who believe in him.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; People think that we just get salvation.
[1:13:54] But Christ gave us authority.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:14:00] So the only authority Christ has on the
[1:14:03] earth right now is through his body.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; The only authority Christ has on the
[1:14:10] earth NOW IS THROUGH HIS BODY.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; This is what he was working to achieve.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Through seven CHURCH AGES, HE HAS BEEN
[1:14:17] WORKING TO ACHIEVE THAT CHRIST MIGHT
[1:14:19] HAVE THE PREEMINENCES in a people.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the Bible says Christ is
[1:14:30] the head.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Christ is not THE WHOLE BODY.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY TELL ME who's referred to as
[1:14:36] the body.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; So he is the head and you we are the
[1:14:46] body.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible now is using like a human term
[1:14:50] to say body, human body as an
[1:14:52] illustration of the body of Christ.
[1:14:55] Now how much authority can the head
[1:14:58] operate alone
[1:15:00] without the body?
[1:15:04] But is Bible is the Bible saying Christ
[1:15:05] is the head?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; So Christ is the head and there's only
[1:15:10] so much the head can do.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; The head is the intelligence.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; The head can think things. He can want
[1:15:16] to do things but it requires the
[1:15:19] cooperation of the body.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Bless you Lord.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. REQUIRES OUR COOPERATION.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; WE ARE CO-WORKERS WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Now, if you think you can operate
[1:15:36] independent of your head, cut your head
[1:15:37] and leave it next to you.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; We can't operate without Christ is what
[1:15:42] I'm trying to tell you.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2,
[1:15:48] sorry, let's Ephesians 1:22.
[1:15:50] [clears throat]
[1:15:51] Now, we just read in Matthew 28:18, he
[1:15:55] says, "All authority has been given to
[1:15:56] me." Everyone read that?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And Ephesians 1:22 says, "He had put all
[1:16:03] things under his feet."
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody show me feet in the head.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Feet.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Feet is where?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody say in the body.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. He's put all things
[1:16:16] under where
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; his feet.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And gave him to be the what?
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; He made Christ the head.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Bless your name.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; And he put all AUTHORITY UNDER HIS FEET.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY, GLORY, GLORY.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; OH, if we only knew who we are in
[1:16:36] Christ.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. gave him to be the head over all
[1:16:43] things to the church.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; He is the head. We are the body.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Notice Ephesians 1:20.
[1:16:52] Then which he wrought in Christ when he
[1:16:55] did this. Which he wrought in Christ
[1:16:58] when he raised him from the dead and set
[1:17:01] him at his own right hand in heavenly
[1:17:04] places.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to show you next is
[1:17:08] oneness.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. God didn't just take the head of
[1:17:11] Jesus
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; and place it there in heavenly places.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; He resurrected the whole body.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; So if Christ THE HEAD IS IN HEAVENLY
[1:17:22] PLACES, THE REST OF HIS BODY is in
[1:17:24] heavenly places and we govern AND WE
[1:17:27] RULE FROM HEAVENLY PLACES.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause]
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, we love you. Yes.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; He wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:17:35] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:17:37] right hand in heavenly places.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say you want to see the
[1:17:46] scripture. I'll show you the scripture.
[1:17:48] So, when did he raise Christ? When he
[1:17:49] raised him from the dead, he set him at
[1:17:51] his right hand. Somebody say right hand
[1:17:52] means power and authority.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. Let's go to
[1:17:57] Ephesians chapter 2. I know I'm I'm I'm
[1:17:59] giving you a lot of scripture, but you
[1:18:00] got to take your teaching from the word.
[1:18:03] Ephesians 2 verse 5 and 6.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Even when we were dead in sins,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; oh, THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; QUICKENED US.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Together with Christ.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; When he raised up Christ, HE'S SAYING HE
[1:18:22] QUICKENED US.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD,
[1:18:26] WE WERE STILL DEAD IN SINS.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; But he's saying WHEN HE RAISED HIM from
[1:18:30] the dead, he quickened us together with
[1:18:33] him.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; How many of you are reading this?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; He quickened us together.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; With Christ. Let's go. Six.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And had raised us up together.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; And has made us sit together.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; In heavenly places.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; IN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; I may stay in Phoenix. I may stay IN
[1:18:58] VERUM. I MAY STAY IN RESERVOIR HILLS. I
[1:19:01] may stay in Hillary. BUT THAT'S NOT
[1:19:03] WHERE I AM IN CHRIST JESUS. IN CHRIST
[1:19:05] JESUS, I reign within IN HEAVENLY
[1:19:08] PLACES. MY POSITION IS heavenly places.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; I reign from this authority.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; HEAVENLY PLACES.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; SATAN IS POWERLESS.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Satan is defeated.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, is somebody saying this?
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; While we were dead in sins, how much
[1:19:24] more now that we are saved?
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:27] Do you know that didn't bring Esther to
[1:19:29] his side, raise the royal scepter and
[1:19:32] then not give her the opportunity to
[1:19:33] rule and reign with him?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Watch after the royal scepter was reign
[1:19:38] was raised.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Asus doesn't speak much.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; It is the bride now
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; who's speaking
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; commanding about a speaking about this
[1:19:47] concerned about the salvation of the
[1:19:49] Jews saying let's go and rewrite the
[1:19:51] laws.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; The bride is now in action.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; I say it again. Don't keep quiet.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Speak and go forward.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; The sword of the word is in your mouth.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Don't think about your problems. Speak
[1:20:07] to your problems.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Don't cry about your problems. Speak to
[1:20:10] your problem. This is the hour of the
[1:20:12] spoken word. Amen. This is the time for
[1:20:15] the PREACH. THE SPOKEN WORD IS the
[1:20:17] original seed. And
[1:20:18] [applause and cheering] the original
[1:20:19] seed has been restored back to the
[1:20:21] church.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you all. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Some people think the the original seed
[1:20:26] is God's thoughts in the back part of
[1:20:28] his minds. No,
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham is preaching a message.
[1:20:31] The spoken word is the original seed.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Some people say the original seed is a
[1:20:36] thought of God. No,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; the spoken word is the original seed.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Let there be."
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; So when we were dead in sins, he had
[1:20:49] quickened us. That's not something he's
[1:20:51] going to do. There, there again. He had
[1:20:54] raised us.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Had finished together. Made us sit
[1:21:00] together
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; You know, I wonder if sometimes we are
[1:21:09] sitting together in heavenly places with
[1:21:11] Christ Jesus, but we crying to God like
[1:21:14] Moses at the Red Sea.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; But you're sitting in the seat of power.
[1:21:18] He says, "All power, ALL AUTHORITY IS
[1:21:20] GIVEN TO ME."
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And you, [laughter] I'm showing you
[1:21:22] scripture. You are raised up together
[1:21:24] with him. What are you crying about?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; SPEAK AND GO FORWARD.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; SPEAK AND GO FORWARD.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Wherein in time past you walked. You
[1:21:37] see, IN THE PAST you walked according to
[1:21:39] the cause of this world, according to
[1:21:41] the prince of the power of the air. This
[1:21:44] is Ephesians 2:1 now. Amen.
[1:21:51] In time past, you walked according to
[1:21:53] the cause of the world, according to the
[1:21:54] prince of the power of the air. The
[1:21:56] spirit that now workth in the children
[1:21:57] of disobedience. You see where demon
[1:21:59] powers must be able to work, not in you.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible is saying demon
[1:22:03] powers has legal authority to work in
[1:22:05] children of disobedience. But children
[1:22:07] of obedience, demon powers have no
[1:22:09] authority over you. You give them the
[1:22:11] legal right, the legal notice. AND
[1:22:13] YOU'RE A VICTIM NOW. NOT TOMORROW. NOT
[1:22:15] WHEN YOU GO HOME. YOU A VICTIM NOW. SAY,
[1:22:18] "SATAN, I EVICT YOU."
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:27] Ephesians 1:19. I'm going quick now.
[1:22:30] Amen. We need to finish. Ephesians 1:19.
[1:22:33] The exceeding greatness.
[1:22:36] Amen.
[1:22:38] The exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:22:41] us. When the exceeding greatness of his
[1:22:43] power directed to
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; us,
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; it's being usward. It's given to us.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Excing greatness of his power to us
[1:22:52] would who believe according to the
[1:22:54] working of his mighty power.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; In other words, there is PUTTING FORTH A
[1:22:59] POWER. HE SAYS THERE'LL BE A POWER PUT
[1:23:01] INTO THE CHURCH.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Find that power put into the church.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Then you'll see the prophet is also
[1:23:08] saying this. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; There's a putting forth of divine
[1:23:10] omnipotence.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; God's power working through the church.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Spoiling
[1:23:16] principalities, spoiling powers.
[1:23:20] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:24] Christ has been enthroned and we have
[1:23:26] been raised up together with him and the
[1:23:28] ruling authority is given to us. Amen.
[1:23:31] This brings to a close now. But if you
[1:23:33] find it, just tell me. Amen.
[1:23:38] Now notice he said there the head and
[1:23:40] the body is raised together.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Somebody say the head and the body is
[1:23:44] raised together.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; The head and the body is raised
[1:23:46] together.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Say both are in heavenly places.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Both are in heavenly places.
[1:23:50] [clears throat]
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; My seat of power.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody say my seat of power
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; My seat of power
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; is in heavenly places.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; is in heavenly places
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; but my authority is on the earth.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; My authority is on the earth.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; You getting that? Yes.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; You are sitting in heavenly places, but
[1:24:06] your authority is on the earth.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; There'll be a power put into the church.
[1:24:12] You just start put into the church. We
[1:24:14] should get it. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; So the authority that belongs to Christ
[1:24:21] belongs to every single member of the
[1:24:23] body.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:28] 1 Corinthians 12:12 says, "For as the
[1:24:30] body,
[1:24:32] you got this."
[1:24:34] See what he says? He says, "You might
[1:24:37] think I'm a fanatic. The very same thing
[1:24:39] I'm speaking of will be done. There'll
[1:24:41] be a power put into the church."
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "There's no higher power
[1:24:46] than the revelation of the word."
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; We're just preaching the power to you
[1:24:50] now to show you that it's already given
[1:24:52] to you. There'll be a power put into the
[1:24:54] church now coming in that the Holy
[1:24:56] Spirit will so anoint a people
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; that till they'll speak.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; They'll speak
[1:25:06] and it'll create itself
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; right there.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; I believe. Amen.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; They'll speak. The authority is given to
[1:25:18] you. It'll create itself right there.
[1:25:21] Thank you.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; We haven't seen powers like this coming
[1:25:25] to the church. Now I know it for effect.
[1:25:28] Amen. Praise the Lord. So you can read
[1:25:30] that at home. Amen. If 1 Corinthians
[1:25:33] 12:12 says, for as the body is one, all
[1:25:37] member and many members and all members
[1:25:39] of that one body being many are one
[1:25:41] body. So what I'm trying to show you
[1:25:43] here now is that the head and the body
[1:25:46] both are Christ. [snorts]
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; For as the body is one, somebody say
[1:25:54] head and body is one.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Head and body is one.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; All the members of that one body being
[1:25:59] many are one body. So also is Christ.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; So when we are referencing Christ now,
[1:26:06] don't think about Christ 2,000 years
[1:26:08] ago.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about Christ the anointed
[1:26:11] one.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; When we are talking about Christ, we are
[1:26:15] talking about both head. That's Jesus
[1:26:17] Christ.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. and us the body.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Together we are Christ.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; You can't separate the head and the body
[1:26:26] and call one Christ and the other
[1:26:27] something else.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:26:32] Members of one body being many are one
[1:26:34] body. So also is Christ.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; So all the members of one body. Amen. So
[1:26:44] also is Christ. The church is called
[1:26:46] Christ. We are Christ.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Who do men say that you are?
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; But who do you say that you are?
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Some of you please go. I don't have time
[1:26:59] to read it now. Go and read Christ the
[1:27:01] mystery of God revealed where he's
[1:27:02] talking about Christ being the central
[1:27:04] theme.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Christ being the central theme. He says
[1:27:08] wherever Christ is the anointing, the
[1:27:10] anointed one, that becomes the central
[1:27:12] theme of the revelation. Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; And he's trying to show you how now you
[1:27:16] are the central theme. Okay.
[1:27:19] Let's close with this. Now
[1:27:24] 1 Corinthians 6:17
[1:27:29] you say, "Brother, give me another
[1:27:31] scripture." But he that is joined unto
[1:27:33] the Lord is what?
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; So there's no two spirits.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; There's no Christ spirit and then the
[1:27:42] bride spirit. Hallelujah.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Have we been joined unto the Lord?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? Is one spirit.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; He that is joined unto the Lord is one
[1:27:55] spirit.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; So let's let's recap. Let's not stay at
[1:28:02] the cross. Let's move past the cross,
[1:28:04] past the ascension, past Pentecost, past
[1:28:06] Luther, past Wesley, past Amen.
[1:28:08] Pentecost again. Let's move on to the
[1:28:10] formed image. Now
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; let's become ALL THAT THE WORD SAID WE
[1:28:14] MUST BE NOW.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Let's move past the mighty angel
[1:28:18] descending WITH THE BOOK. THAT'S
[1:28:19] FINISHED.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Somebody hear me. Let's move
[1:28:23] past Revelation 10:7. He's already
[1:28:25] sounded.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Let's move past. GO TAKE THE BOOK.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; I have already taken the book.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; I have already eaten the book.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; I am now in Revelation 10:11. Yes,
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; I am prophesying again
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; before many tongues, many nations, many
[1:28:43] people.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; HEAR THE WORDS OF MY PROPHECY.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Wa. We are sitting together. Amen.
[1:28:51] Hallelujah.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he died, we died. When he
[1:28:55] rose, we arose. When he was put ON THE M
[1:28:58] RIGHT HAND OF THE MAJESTY OF GOD, WE WAS
[1:29:01] PLACED ON the right hand of the majesty
[1:29:02] of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are sitting there a
[1:29:08] sitting where the head is having control
[1:29:10] having dominion having all authority.
[1:29:13] Say Satan
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; you are under my feet under my feet.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; All authority that Jesus Christ had
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; he has given to me to
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; when you are taking the book
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; you are taking back authority.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; You are taking back legal rights to the
[1:29:26] earth.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; So the earth responds to the spoken
[1:29:29] word. So you've got to speak the word.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. Give God praise.
[1:29:34] [applause]
[1:29:36] Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Worship him. Worship
[1:29:40] him. Give him praise.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Give him praise. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Christ wants to finish the walk in you.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Christ wants to finish the walk in you.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Christ has no hands but your hands.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Christ has no feet but your feet.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. The authority belongs
[1:30:04] to us

[1:31:44] [music]
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Every demon [singing] power has to bow.
[1:31:47] Now
[1:31:51] [music]

[1:31:54] bow.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; [music]

[1:35:17] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; You run a walk in my family for too
[1:35:22] long. You've run [music] a walk with my
[1:35:24] children for too long. You've run a walk
[1:35:26] in my finances for too long. You've run
[1:35:30] [music] away with my health for too
[1:35:31] long. [singing] But today, I'm coming
[1:35:33] back to take [music] back everything

[1:36:26] [music] Christ.
[1:36:28] You see, Jesus
[1:36:32] has [music] changed [singing] my whole
[1:36:35] life.
[1:36:37] If anybody [singing]
[1:36:42] [music]
[1:36:44] ask you
[1:36:47] who I am,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; you tell him

[1:37:23] Boy, if anybody [music]
[1:37:25] [singing]
[1:37:26] if anybody
[1:37:29] ask you
[1:37:33] [music] who
[1:37:34] I am
[1:37:39] [music]
[1:37:41] I am
[1:37:43] redeemed.
[1:37:47] [music]
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed. [applause]
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed. The Bible says, "Let the
[1:37:52] redeemed of the Lord say so.

[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Every place the soul of my foot shall
[1:37:58] tread upon." Amen. I shall possess.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to walk forward.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; God told Joshua, "You got to walk
[1:38:06] forward." Footsteps means possession.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; I'm walking over my healing. I'm walking
[1:38:11] over my deliverance. I'm walking. Amen.
[1:38:14] Victory for my children. Victory over my

[1:38:21] heavenly places. I RULE AND REIGN FROM
[1:38:24] heavenly places. [music]

[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Don't negotiate with the enemy.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Don't talk to the devil.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; The devil is a liar.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; You talk to him, you only hear lies.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Don't talk to him.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Why do we want to talk to him?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; People want to know the devil's name.
[1:38:45] What's your name? We don't want to even
[1:38:47] know his name. Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; We just want to tell him get out of
[1:38:50] here.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Get thee behind me. [applause]
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; If you go and read there,
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Get thee behind me."
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; The bride says, "Get thee behind me,
[1:39:01] Satan."
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every head bowed, every eyes
[1:39:03] closed. Even as we prepare to dismiss,
[1:39:05] we'll ask brother Tim, Amen, to close
[1:39:07] the service in prayer.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Trust in the Lord. Amen. Even as
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; the word of God has gone forth. Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; The word of God has been sown.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Let's say, Lord, water it.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Water your word, oh God. [music]
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Bring forth a good harvest.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Let us recognize who we are.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Satan is powerless before us.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; the bride is an invincible army.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]

[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; because we have the same spirit
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; that you have oh God.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; The same spirit must [singing] do what
[1:40:26] you did. [applause]
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Say that Lord the sick must be healed.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; In fact the sick are already healed.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Finished work.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Finished work. Amen.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; It's not something Lord that you have to
[1:40:40] look to
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; but something that you have already.
[1:40:44] Thank you, Father. We receive
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Lord. Even as it was about

[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Speak and it shall be done.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And when he did that, the waters opened.

[1:41:22] the servant who has spoken so faithfully
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; with so much [singing] conviction. Oh

[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Now it must not only be the servant of
[1:41:34] God who has spoken
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; but the congregation must speak
