========================================

the Bible this morning last week we were speaking on Grace needs Perfection and we were showing you how Jacob was making his journey to Joseph and we know that Jacob was typing Grace and Joseph Perfection amen Amen brother Brenham said whatever seed started the church that's what will come forth at the arst time so Jacob was the form of the seed and but when he was coming to Joseph he was coming to Perfection amen amen that's the time we at now amen praise the Lord so we're going to speak on Amen multiplication of grace and the way I'm going to say the next part because I want the bride to start to understand that the bride is already perfected and already married thank you Lord that is not a future work yes amen the Rapture is not taking you to a marriage Rapture is taking you to the marriage supper so if we are called under the shout message that's a message calling you giving you a message to prepare that's Revelation 19:7 the bride makes himself ready but in Matthew 25 we know the bride bridegroom comes he opens the door he pulls the bride in to the shout amen and them that are without oil on the outside so let's read our scripture amen we're speaking at 5 * 5 is a multiplicate because we know five is the number of Grace amen so if you multiply Grace that's 5 * five yes amen it's a multiplication of Grace yes the bride is perfected and married in the this time amen John 1:16 says and of his fullness have we all received and Grace for Grace amen and of his fullness have we all received and Grace for grace verse 17 says for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ amen hallelujah thankful amen that we are living under the dispensation of Jesus Christ now amen not by the law of Moses because we are living in the time of Grace and Truth praise the Lord and we go to Zechariah chap 4 amen Zechariah 4 from verse 5 says then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me amen I'm so glad that Angels so talk to us am am we've got to be in communication with the Unseen World then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit say the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel thou shall become a plane amen that's a son coming into position who can speak to mountains yes and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace amen unto it so multiplication of Grace at this end time cry yes amen I want to put a timeline to it I want to put a date to it and tell you that's 1963 the Shar message coming when those Angels Came From Heaven bringing a message to brother Bram and shoutings of Grace Grace because remember Revelation 10 is a setting for judgment but it's also bringing grace to the bride so it's judgment to the but grace to the bride same thing in Genesis 18 amen moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts had sent me unto you for who had despised the day of small things when he started in 1946 in a cave who can despise those things amen hallelujah for there shall be rejoicing amen and they shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel have we seen the plummet in the hand of zerubabel Amen Hallelujah with those seven the they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro from the whole earth amen praise the Lord you may be seated if you can put up Matthew 2510 want to read this amen I think it's very important we understand the time of and season we living in because you know there was three quarts to the temple amen there was the outer the inner and the holiest of holies amen so if you read the story and the parable of the five wise and the five foolish amen the bride has progressed she's no longer amen we've been saying this for a few weeks now I'm just reiterating she's no longer wise virgins with oil in the lamp outside the door amen remember the holiest of holies is where the bride needs to be yes amen shut in into that secret place Amen in the Shak of glory amen now how can you carry your lamp light and go into Shak Glory lamp light Candlestick light was in the second Court everybody agree so we can't be in The Bride of Jesus Christ come under the shout message and claim to be wise virgins carrying oil in our lamp walking through Lea no the shout came to open a door to us and pull us into the marriage can somebody say Amen yes amen so we got to know where we are and while they went to buy the bridegroom came did he come yes come on now Jesus does all three things as he's descending first he comes in a shout so it's Jesus in the shout yesen the bridegroom came and they that we already went in with him to the marriage amen that happens here on the Earth yesen amen and the door was shut so therefore denominations denominations can't understand the shout they can't enter this dimensional door of the shot that's open to the bride you can break your head you can even take coconut and break they will never see it if they are not predestinated amen amen so it's a door only open to the bride and we'll read this quote now in proving his word he says it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh amongst us and will make his word so real it will unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper now this is the point I want to get to she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage yes amen amen hallelujah so right now we are being united with the word the invisible Union amen hallelujah of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride praise the Lord now a very important scripture I want to read this is Malachi 4: 5 and 6 amen I want the young people to also amen start to learn these scriptures these are very fun fundamental scriptures to our belief and our revelation of the hour Malachi 4:5 says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet three people involved here God the bride and a prophet so God is talking to the bride here I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and you shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest they come and smite the Earth with a curse amen so we showed you that last week how when Joseph sent the brothers back to Jacob his heart was turned back to the children The Father's Heart was turned back to the children there because he had no confidence in them but finally when they started to minister to him his heart was turned back to them and he sent Benjamin with them showing you the first part of that prophecy and the second time the heart of the father children returned back to the fathers was when Jacob came and met Joseph praise the Lord amen one more Point I've got to read again a quote because I'm building up here brother brandom says we've read this before God stands on the promised word for each New Year amen so if you want to live on the Promises of last year that's fine with me but the prophet is saying in the message Shalom God stands on the promised word for each New Year yes he stands on it this year to fulfill what he got promised for the last 60 years no he's saying to fulfill what he has got promised for this year whatever it is I want to be right in the center of his will in the future like they did right in paragraph 190 he says so the new year is determined by God just determined to stay in his word walk where the word says walk amen so the reason we are saying that we don't want to miss anything any promise of God Amen that he has got stored up for this year we want to be a faithful Steward that wants to unlock all of the promises of God for this year amen hallelujah so brother Brandon we read now in Zechariah 4:6 that the prophet is saying not by power not by might but by my spirit say the Lord now the prophet is going to Define that let's see what he says in the message of Grace he says the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers that's Malachi 4 verse 6 said everybody agree we just read it now watch how he defines it he says in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not to bring you to some theology Malachi for's message is to turn your heart back to the faith amen and he's saying here he's defining it that is to be under the power of the spirit not to make us intellectual people but to be led by the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the Lord he goes on to say not by power not by might but by my spirit say the Lord not by organization not by Den denomination but by the holy spirit hallah amen God will bring forth the church in the last day amen so amen hallelujah the Bride of Jesus Christ like we said in Matthew 25 uh symbol amen is the Holy Ghost she is filled with the Holy Ghost there was a big distinction the reason why the foolish could identify the Bride of Jesus Christ as having the Holy Ghost is because they are the gifts but they are the GI of the gifts amen they were reading from the word but she was the word made flesh so they were asking the bride give us this word that's making you flesh and they said we can't give it to you because this thinging comes under a Shar message so you got to come out your prophetic gift to receive this Holy Ghost amen thank you Lord amen thank you Jesus I'm saying it again the bride that be become flesh amen which means she was tabernacling the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah the second full mystery purpose was already in fulfillment Christ was now veiled in his bride amen hallelujah because he won't marry anything beside the word come on Church Christ won't marry anything beside the word so if you open up the door to us and pull us into the marriage the bride is already been perfected and not by our own works but by his grace I think somebody ought to praise the Lord amen yes Lord oh Hallelujah Christ is not coming to do a further work to perfect us all that was needed to perfect us was already done amen you go look up the word justification amen if you're still struggling with sin or still trying to see yourself as imperfect you need to go and read that amen that when you are Justified is as though you've never done it in the first place amen amen thank you Lord praise the Lord hallelujah amen now when the Lord comes to the Lord will you make thinking why is the Lord reminding you of stuff why is the Lord reminding you amen hallelujah the Lord that's how God is he's a god of multiplication he's a god of Grace amen when he came to Noah he says Noah you have found Grace in my eyes it wasn't that Noah was living a righteous life that God said oh this man is so righteous I'll save him the Bible says Noah found Grace Hallelujah when they sin there in Eden and and the darkness amen swept through Eden that day chaos death Grace came in on the scene praise the Lord oh hallelujah amen so God will remind us because of his grace let's just go to Genesis CH 32 and verse 27 here we find Jacob wrestling with the angel amen so I I want to show you in this very short verses that sometimes truth is revealed to someone identification is revealed to someone but it takes them some time for them to walk in that revelation of things but God is gracious and patient and will keep reminding us thank you Lord here Jacob is wrestling with the angel and you know he doesn't want to let the angel go it's about time for amen for Sunrise and the angel says you've got to let me go and he says I won't let you go till you bless me and now the angel says to him in verse 27 he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob all name all nature name represents nature character 28 and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel amenah for as a prince has the power with God and with men and has prevailed finish work when Christ tells you who you are when Christ reveals your identity he's not going to tell you you will prevail he's saying you have prevailed am it's a finished work amen praise the [Music] Lord now watch again there the angel revealing that he's going to change his name now in 35 and verse 9 chapter 35 and God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of bed Dam and blessed him and God said unto him thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob now didn't God tell him that but God is reminding him you are not walking in the revelation of your name oh yes help us Lord amen we don't have any denominational name attached to us we are the bride the M Jesus Christ amen Lord and until we get into the Revelation to realize who we are we'll be walking around like Esther being married to the king but not in a position fearful to go into the presence of the king that's why you need the voice of morah the voice of the seventh angel thundering out amen reminding you that you've been called for such a time as this amen Esther was married Esther was having Royal robes Esther was living in luxury in the palace but she was fearful to go in the presence of the king this bride of Jesus Christ must never be fearful to come into the presence of the king but we have an exess and we must come boldly into his presence Hallelujah in fact it upsets the king if we stay out of his presence amen we were telling you the other day amen hallelujah when you come into CH kind of Glory that's the presence of the Sun so you can't have sunscreen please don't use sunscreen and come in the presence of the sun hallelujah amen amen that sunscreen I can say is unbelief praise the Lord now here reminding you now the Lord is coming to Jacob the second time and telling him thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob but Israel shall be thy name and he called his name Israel and God said unto him I am God Almighty what is going to confirm the Covenant now be fruitful and multiply amen a nation and a company of Nations shall be out of thee and King shall come out of thy loins and the land which I gave AB abam and Isaac to thee I will give it you see why he couldn't go based on his father's Covenant God will come personally to you and confirm with you amen hallelujah it must be a oneon-one experience he may have heard of the Covenant of Abraham he may have heard of the Covenant with his father amen Israel amen Isaac but now until he meet God face to face until you meet God on that sacred SS amen that's the time you'll only be convinced and then concerned other than that you hearing about a holy ghost in feeling other than that you hearing amen about amen the shout message and you being caught into this dimension of the shout and being changed under rapturing Faith but until he comes to revealed to you your new name amen what's tell me what's given at the marriage beside ring you take on the husband's name so if we just read that the marriage takes place here on the earth if there is a marriage between Christ and the bride there's got to be a name change you got to die to your own nature you got to die to your own character you got to amen be able to say Lord you are now my head we don't Christ don't want any independent woman you can't iate your name and take on the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you can't be Benjamin Maru praise the Lord but you've got to forsake all your rights you've got to forsake all your past remember what Rebecca did she left everything behind to be United with Isaac praise the Lord so we've got to leave all unbelief we've got to leave all of our amen things that we are meddling with the world and things that we've got amen our hands in the world and and no total surrender you we as a people would know the things we are still holding on to that's right Hallelujah like they would say enter your pockets let me see what's in your pockets praise the lord we can't come into Jesus Christ marriage with things in our pockets with golden wages amen hallelujah so are we seeing the grace of the Lord amen he's coming to remind Jacob of his name and then he's also giving him a covenant in verse 13 and God went up from him in the place where he talked to them now I want you to also understand this is before he has any children in things this brother Jacob goes on living his entire life even after two confirmation that his name is Israel still going by the name of Jacob amen now watch your Beginnings because your Beginnings are important this boy grew up with his mother and father it was not the desire of Jacob to trick his father into giving him the blessing if you read the story Rebecca is the one who told him to do this amen amen so what you SE into your children they will start to learn those ways Rebecca is the one that cooked the meal Rebecca is the one that told your hands are too fine you need to get the thing and put on your hands Rebecca is the one that coed him yes amen so he goes on living this way you'll see he goes and he tricks his father-in-law he goes and he tricks he's living a life now of deception everywhere he goes this thing is ingrained in him so much so that he now filters down to his children his children come to him with fake blood on a cloth and they're lying to their father they don't even tell their father this is Joseph's blood they just show it to him and he makes his own conclusion that is my son's blood so he lives for the next what we said 25 years thinking that Joseph is dead he's living under a self- deluded deception a self-inflicted deception that Joseph is dead and all this time he's being considered under his own name his own name nature imagine living for 25 years in deception being fooled by your own children now this is where we're want to get to that's why I related that now when Joseph sends back a message to his father he sends them back with chariots Joseph's chariots and we we were typing that the last time that the wagons the Chariots of Joseph was the message of the hour M just like how the camels went to pack amen Rebecca Joseph sent the Chariots Perfection had sent a message is Joseph Perfection was this message coming from Joseph so was it a message from Perfection amen amen and he was and and we read it now from verse chapter 45: 26 and they told him Joseph is yet alive amen and he is governor of all of the land of Egypt now watch the the Bible how it records it it doesn't say Israel and Jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not first they told him Joseph he they they presented remember the court of Many Colors with the blood he believed them Joseph was dead now they come back with the news 25 years later and they tell him Joseph is alive and he doesn't believe them and they told him all the words of Joseph [Music] which he had said unto them but the words alone is not enough watch what happened when he saw the wagons the Chariots which Joseph had sent to carry him the message of the hour amen come on now amen when he saw the type of transportation that was sent to take him to Perfection when you see the message of the hour you know this is not any ordinary message this message couldn't come from a seventh grade amen Prophet Kent Prophet when we saw the message of the hour we said no wait something is up here where did my sons get this Chariot where did you get this book from hallelujah amen where did you get that Revelation from amen something is up here amen what was happening his heart was being turned back amen it was the message of Malachi 4 coming to him and see what happens here when he saw the message of the hour which Joseph had sent to car him the spirit of Jacob their father revived amen this man came alive amen he was dead in his spirit because he loved Joseph amen but when he heard that Joseph is alive amen his Spirit revived within him and watch how now suddenly the Bible uses his new name and Israel's here because amen that was the message of the hour because the seventh SS take out all Amnesia he now recognizes is Israel and the Bible says and Israel said it is enough Joseph my son is yet alive and I will go and see him before I die amen hallelujah so God won't leave you till you live in the fullness of your name till you live in the fullness of your promise God will keep coming in the multiplication of Grace he keep coming Amen to remind you who you are blessed be your name of God Amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah yes Lord amen hallelujah now if I tell you that the prophet says the second form mystery purpose is Christ having amen the prein in his people amen Christ in Bri form how many of you would say Amen to that hallelujah amen and that's where we are we are not in the path where God is fully revealing himself through Jesus Christ that was the first part second part we know the first part of the second part was God tabernacling William brandom a son of man revealing the son of man amen amen hallelujah but now that was now to bring the bride into Union with Christ now he's tabernacling his bride Hallelujah so if I say that way people can stomach it they say God is revealing himself to his bride God is expressing himself to his bride but if we say it another way that the Holy Ghost is becoming flesh in US amen yes yes now remember what we said before as well the Holy Ghost is not a new thing Redemption is to bring back what was originally lost yes amen yes sir so God is not bringing the Holy Ghost now as a new thing because Adam lost the title de so which means the Holy Ghost himself was personified in Adam because Redemption must bring back that which was lost that's why on the day of Pentecost it was the most exciting time because For the First Time amen after 4,000 years the Holy Ghost could return and dwell in a people amen praise the Lord yes amen Ephesians 3:19 you say how we going to have the fullness let's take it from the Bible Ephesians 3:19 and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the what fullness amen we might be filled with the fullness of God you see we put limitations on ourselves and say the fullness can't be in US it can only be we are talking about the bride collectively now all of us have it in measure but when this bride is quickly framed together amen peace upon peace amen hone together coming now to the top it's the fullness of God that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now here the prophet is confirming this he it says in the message of Grace and The Headstone was never put in the pyramid we have no machines that could build a pyramid no powers unless it's Atomic power that could build a pyramid because it's too gigantic amen and there we also detailed that that two things were being built at that time one was written in the Bible and detailed and given the blueprint to Noah and told him exactly how to build his ark that was going to take him through the tribulation but it's not recorded how Noah sorry how Enoch built the Pyramid we know Enoch built the Pyramid because the prophet told us Enoch built the Pyramid but remember how does he build a pyramid in silence there's no record of it it's under the seven seiling type that he build a pyramid City amen it's just like What's Happening Now Enoch is a type of the Bride a pyramid city is being built yet is being built in silence praise the Lord stones that weigh tons and tons and tons stands way out in the air so put together that even a thin razor blade could not and they're not cemented remember now they're not even cemented they are just placed there and just so cut so that they Join one another that's the way the body of Christ should be so cut by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah cut by the Holy Ghost amen what is the Holy Ghost God's Great instrument and tool that we be joined as one person we're not divided we should be one person we should be of one mind one Accord amen no mechanics of organization no lodges none of these things could ever do it as good as their intentions are they could never do it because that takes God to do it the Holy Spirit oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I say we open up ourselves to the holy spirit amen God's Great tool amen hallelujah let the holy spirit amen take on flesh thank you Lord Prophet goes on to say according to the prophecy there will come the edstone remember we're speaking on multiplication of Grace The Headstone will come crying Grace Grace amen and I want you to know notice when The Headstone come the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace what I'm trying to show you is this is not a future event the prince that's going to cry out Grace has already Cried Out amen hallelujah I'm trying to shake us this morning to realize we've been called into the shout message amen for the marriage of the Lamb amen we have been called into the most amen wonderful amen marriage ever amen amen the marriage of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords amen he has a selected people he won't just choose any prostitute he won't just choose any Harlot but he's chosen the cream of the crop and if we can believe and receive the message of the hour God has chosen you God has unpicked you to believe the message of the hour and to respond to the shout the message going forth to gather the living Saints amen hallelujah thank you Lord he says here in the latest Church age they that hear this Prophet now this Prince crying out will be blessed and become part of that Bride of the last day who are mentioned in Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the Bride come right these are some of the quotes we were going to read last week to show you Jacob coming to Perfection the seed coming to the full maturity here's where we were getting it the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at NAA has to come back to the original word grain again amen you see why Jacob would type Grace had to come back to Perfection praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age amen amen I'm going to say it again listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age don't listen to our own opinions listen to the prophet of God amen amen what he says comes from God yes praise the Lord the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing praise the Lord and what they will say will have already been said in the word because we are word bride we had a word Prophet amen they are saying it now come out from among another now and be separate the cry has gone out the cry is going out oh Hallelujah the cry has gone out in Revelation 10:7 the cry is going out under Revelation 10:11 amen how long will the cry voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long but this is the last age I say we are living in the brink of time even now amen amen yeah Amen in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we're in the end time the glory has gone back to the grain again oh Hallelujah can you see the glory of my father upon me the glory has come back to the grain again amen hallelujah the glory that was Upon Jesus is in me and unless we start to walk with that confidence unless we start to see ourselves that way amen we are going to make the blood of Jesus Christ and the work of Jesus Christ for 2,000 years of non effect we've got to see oursel coming to that position amen like God reminded Jacob of his name amen the fivefold ministry is reminding us who we are walk in Perfection walk in the Glorious Liberty that was given to us through the message of the hour praise the Lord the glory has come back to the grain again turn to your neighbor tell him can you see my glory oh the glory of the father is upon me amen hallelujah amen the glory of the father is upon me you may be using time to shine something on your face but that's not the glory we're talking about amen hallelujah we're talking about the glory of the father sh kind of Glory coming down upon his people you praise the Lord watch now Glory has come back to the Grain and the church is making herself ready to stand on her feet come on stop sitting around laying idle you know preparation what it means brother Brandon when he's detailing this this uh bride that was given given a promise by that rich Rancher son she wasn't sitting inside the house when the time came near she was amen at one time she was taking dishwash out because she knew the time wasn't near she was still doing the chores of the house and the cousins were mocking and teasing her did he really give you the promise but when she knew the time was near she got dressed in the Royal apparel amen the garments that were given to her and she was waiting by the roadside she didn't want the bridegroom to come into the house even amen she was waiting there brother Brandon says The Chariot stopped she jumped in and she was gone amen praise the Lord so the church is on her feet I say the Bride of Jesus Christ is on her feet amen we are not bound amen we're not chained down we are not in the house of denominations but the bride is on our feet amen marching to the pat of Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to war praise the Lord am we believe him to be here Jesus in the shout am hey they sing Jesus in the mountain Jesus in the street Jesus over valleys every we sing Jesus in the shout hallelujah but remember when it went down the grain began to ripen there you find it before the grain can ripen everything in the store talk has to be dead you see why it was the most convenient time for Joseph's message to come to Jacob he was completely like dead now he couldn't have his own opinion now he was exposed to the message of Joseph he saw the Chariots of Joseph this Transportation that's able to take me from this land of famine amen into a land of promise where they telling me I'm going to meet my dead loved one Hallelujah I know Joseph is dead but they're telling me if I jump onto this message of the hour I can see my dead loved one yes amen hallelujah amen you know the guide is here now amen praise the Lord he says can't you see where we are standing life is in the grain again just exactly like the same grain that went down in the ground the same Jesus in the bright form same power same church amen same thing same word amen hey that's a nice chance to sing into a song same vision same word same power same character same name amen praise the Lord the same word sucked up through these come out here again come to the head and all the life was come through here picked up its people now it's forming into the head for the Rapture oh praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen two more quotes amen now to the perfect after the stock has been formed after the tessel is formed after the great grain has come into the cop then it has come to Perfection back to the regular grain again remember the grain must be dramatized you see why we need the marriage hey you can't have a baby through artificial exmination you can't reproduce The Life of Christ through artificial examination praise the Lord the seed must be dramatized so you got to come into a union with Christ am that's why he's saying it here now this grain must be dramatized if it don't it won't live none of that was outside of the messengers will ever come to life oh yes yes outside of Matthew 2510 all that's shut outside the door will never come to life am if they want to make it on the other side they must go by the way of tribulation it has to be gerz but remember the same life that was in the stock is in the grain it's maturing itself right back he revealed himself what son of man the grain that went into the ground get the message amen here in Israel and the church the prophet is saying election in Abraham justification in Isaac Grace in Jacob and perfection in Joseph there's not one thing recorded against Joseph that's the Perfection the three Earthly stages of the pilgrimage of the children of Israel and the fourth was when they went into the promised land Hallelujah am amen can you say Amen to that the fourth was when they went into the promised land which was the Millennium and the three stages of the Gentile church this week the Lord willing I will bring it out through the Bible and show that we in our third stage now ready to go into the Millennium in the time of Joseph now I'm going to ask you how do we get to the Millennium there's an order of things to happen in order for us to get to the Millennium according to Bible prophecy Dimensional Doors must open up to us praise the Lord we must go from this Dimension to the seven dimension for the marriage supper everyone can say Amen to them am praise the Lord so Dimensional Doors must open up to us so how does he do it he starts to open up I'm saying this again as I'm closing now God opens up the dimensional door of the shout that they don't know nothing about it's a complete mystery secret yes yes sir remember this pyramid city is being built in silence he opens up the door of the shout which is the message going forth amen he pulls us into into the marriage and we are now United with the word flesh is becoming word and word is becoming flesh that's how we get to the Millennium we've got to enter the shout amen like we were saying last week if you don't enter the shout you can't get to the Trump our part is the shout so which means the Trump is the changing of the body there's no changing of the body without coming to the shout amen hallelujah and we can't access the next realm which is to see our loved ones for 40 days which is the voice of the Resurrection without being in the shout so God has an order of events that's happening and already transpiring now and I tell you again this is no ordinary thing that we are called to the message of the hour we've got to Value it amen we've got to place Great Value upon this P of great price we've got a value that God has seen it fit and that's Grace what I'm talking about we have called into the message because of Grace not by our own works not by our own merits amen nothing that we have done yes but God in his grace God rich in his Mercy said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to dwell in here he her amen hallelujah now when you are calling to the shout that's when you can hear the love secrets that's when your seat is being dramatized remember in in Shan Glory now there's no other light there yes praise the Lord you're not walking on your own light Hallelujah the priest if he was carrying any light had to leave it yes in the inner Court when he went into the holiest of holies there was no artificial light no lamp light so I'm asking you again which part of the journey are we at are we still wise virgins carrying oil in L here or have we come into the secret chamber of the Shina glory and caught up into that realm where there's no other light but his light that's the light when we sing We Walk In The Light beautiful light walk where the D drops of mercies are bright why don't we need you say you may be saying now listen to what you may be saying but brother brother brandham says that the light in the lamp is the Holy Ghost you're saying we don't need that no I am saying the Holy Ghost has personified himself in US Christ won't open the door to us to someone who is imperfect who has not become the word so when he opens up the door to the bride you are the Holy Ghost made flesh amen it might sound strong language now but remember Redemption is to bring back that which was lost hallah yes yes praise the Lord am I've got another I want to close with this I've got some time I'm finished with my message just give the Lord a good an clap of Praise amen so I'm saying a multiplication of Grace God's number for Grace is five yes if it's going to be a multiplication of Grace over your life for God to remind you amen who you areall it's God's grace Upon Our Lives amen I've got some other notes I just want to throw this out here very quickly because in your study I want you to look at this amen I found some interesting things here and I thought I'll just share it with you for those of you are students of the word you want to share you want to go look into this this isn't a very nice thing amen you got the it's full history repeating itself praise the Lord this four there amen we'll try and get through this very quickly I want to be very careful with this carefully and see this God promised at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled has to be right right it's just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus come all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be in its last Church age when the messenger of Malachi comes he will be right to the word take the whole Bible from Genesis Revelation start at serpent seed carry on to the message of the last latter rain this is where I want to get to he has to be for history is repeating itself from the time of a pay attention to his words now very particular from the time of a Israel history under a is happening right here where in South Africa in where when the prophet where the prophet of Malachi appears now I also want to place a timeline right there I'm showing you how to study the word he never had a message before 63 all the time he's saying I'm waiting for a message I'm waiting for a message I'm waiting for a message right so he only got the message in 63 that's when Malachi 4 now had a message to turn the heart of the children to the fathers can you say amen amen right that's the part I wanted to get to so what history are you talking about brother brandham that will repeat itself in America this is it as Israel Left To Worship in Freedom pushed out the natives raised up a nation with great leaders Etc this is it put an aab on the throne with Jezebel behind him right so we have done the very same in America aab was set in the presidential chair with a jezebel behind him to direct him it's such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come Hallelujah right then we want to get to this very quickly condemnation by representation brother gr is confirming woman given to the right to vote elected President Kennedy was the woman's vote wrong man which will finally lead to full control of the Catholic Church Catholic Church is the Jezebel behind a right pay attention then the bomb comes that explodes her hey that's going to happen now if a prophet speaks they done for right there are seven things predicted all five of them already happened we can say six is already happened now you can judge for yourself how far away we are we at the end if them five things happen these other two things are bound to happen it's got to happen right now this is where I want to get to because remember he says from the time of a history will repeat itself so in timeline of Prophecy when when did he say a will appear when the prophet of Malachi 4 comes so who was president in 1963 Kennedy am so we are saying Kennedy was the 35th President so we are counting from there I'm not going to say anything else but show you the fact you can study it he says I do not think that Mr Kennedy will have much effect now he'll make a wonderful pres president in order to bring in the to get a scen just like they have in England like they got in Mexico what scene Catholic Church like they did everywhere else and American people so unstable not spiritually they're smart but not too smart for their own good intelligence swings backwards sometimes backfires right then I got this church here to show you the Kings amen from a now these are all the [Music] kings right and it ended and O after o There's No More Kings right I'm bringing this for a purpose you go scroll down there and you'll see there amen go back to the notes thing he all scrambled praise the Lord so if we are counting there we you delete Dr not amen just show show that Word document okay this make that back going to reading more it's fine so if a is typing J JFK is the 35th I didn't have time to number it I just went straight to show you that mayor name is Obama which was the 44th Pia was trumped as the 45th president Pekka was Biden as the 46th and it ends with this guy OA who was the 47th after that after King OA Israel went into captivity now I'm not saying the prophet is saying history is repeating itself from the time of air this is just something for you to go and study and look at and see that there was no king after the 47 let's stand together and give God [Applause] praise amen glory Lord Jesus thank you Jesus Hallelujah give me a pleas [Music] I'm [Music] only in this
