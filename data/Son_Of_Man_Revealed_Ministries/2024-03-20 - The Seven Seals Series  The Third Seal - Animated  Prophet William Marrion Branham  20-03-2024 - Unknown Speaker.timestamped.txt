[0:00] we have come again tonight Lord to
[0:02] attempt uh this meeting and to pray thee
[0:07] to open to us Lord this uh third seal of
[0:12] this book that it might be uh known to
[0:16] us that we would know what to do and how
[0:19] to live and how to be better
[0:23] Christians now tonight we're going to
[0:26] read uh from this blessed old word again
[0:30] in the sixth chapter and we start
[0:33] tonight with the third seal and that is
[0:37] the fifth verse the fifth and sixth
[0:39] verse now in the fifth
[0:42] verse and when he had opened the third
[0:46] seal I heard the third Beast say come
[0:50] see and I beheld in LW a black horse and
[0:53] he that said on him had a pair of bces
[0:56] in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the
[1:00] midst of the four Beast saying a measure
[1:02] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[1:05] of barley for a penny but see thou hurt
[1:09] not the oil and
[1:11] wine and there was no man in heaven no
[1:15] man on Earth no man beneath the Earth or
[1:19] nobody was even worthy to look at the
[1:23] book see now just think of that then the
[1:26] lamb comes forward and he takes the book
[1:29] now
[1:30] John was asked not to weep anymore he
[1:32] said behold the line of Judah has
[1:37] prevailed and and he can take the book
[1:40] and open it so he turned to look for a
[1:43] Lon and he saw a
[1:45] lamb the Elder called said a Lon has
[1:49] prevailed but when he come and looked it
[1:51] was a lamb coming out from the throne
[1:54] for he was bleeding for the people
[1:59] intercessing
[2:00] for the people until the
[2:03] last soul that was put on the Lamb's
[2:06] Book of Life before the foundational
[2:08] world come in there just going to be so
[2:13] many of them there and that's it that's
[2:16] all the others won't even want to come
[2:18] in have no desire to come in and so then
[2:23] when that last Soul comes in then the
[2:26] time of redemption is
[2:28] finished then the lamb comes forth to
[2:31] claim his rights to what he has
[2:36] redeemed and that's all
[2:38] creation then he said he is worthy to
[2:41] take the book of redemption now it
[2:44] doesn't belong back to the judge anymore
[2:48] belongs to the Redeemer and he's done
[2:51] done the work of redemption down comes
[2:54] Christ you seen in the 10th chapter of
[2:56] Revelations this rer let's this discuss
[3:00] him if you notice the first writer who
[3:04] he was and we found out last night
[3:07] scripturally that the second rider was
[3:10] exactly the same man only he on another
[3:14] heart what happened he changed his
[3:17] ministry see right we found out he was
[3:20] an
[3:21] antichrist and it changed his position
[3:25] now watch where we're at tonight that
[3:26] other Church AGS
[3:28] now we're coming down to the Third
[3:30] Church age now just that Zach the Third
[3:33] Church age is this Zac was third
[3:35] horse this riter is a same one but
[3:39] another stage of his ministry now John
[3:42] sees him on a black horse he changed
[3:47] something
[3:49] else he has started riding
[3:53] him in the time of the Dark
[3:56] Ages that's what the dark harsh repres
[3:59] in it the dark ages for it was a time of
[4:03] midnight to the True Believers amen that
[4:06] was
[4:06] left his balances are his scales in his
[4:10] hand you
[4:12] see calling out measure of wheat for a
[4:15] penny and three measures of barley for a
[4:18] penny see actually that is wheat and
[4:23] barley is natural staff of life that's
[4:27] what bread and stuff's made from but you
[4:30] see he was charging for this yeah what
[4:34] it means that he was charging his
[4:39] subjects for the kind of the hope of
[4:42] life that he was sending out to them by
[4:45] making he started in that very time of
[4:48] making them pay for
[4:52] prayers charging for prayer they still
[4:56] do it no venience because what was doing
[5:00] capturing the wealth of the
[5:04] world the
[5:06] scale weighing out measure of wheat or a
[5:10] penny three measures of barley for a
[5:11] penny the rider on a black
[5:14] horse see he was making stripping his
[5:19] subjects of their money when the Bible
[5:22] predicts that he holds about the wealth
[5:24] of the world now notice you see where
[5:27] that old money taken in church comes
[5:29] from
[5:31] away to build an organization a big
[5:33] something million dollar here charging
[5:35] for Prayer by the priest to pray people
[5:39] out of purgatory charging I'm taking
[5:41] this right out of the history charging
[5:43] for I guess it's novenia I guess
[5:46] everybody noia I guess that's something
[5:49] you have to do you know some penants
[5:50] somebody at to charge for
[5:56] that
[5:58] notice here's a good part now
[6:01] notice see that thou hurt not this wine
[6:08] all just a little bit of it left but
[6:11] don't you touch
[6:15] that now oral is symbolizes the spirit
[6:19] the Holy Spirit I'll give you a few
[6:22] verses if you want to through scriptures
[6:23] Leviticus 8:12 where Aaron before he
[6:26] went had to be Anointed with all you
[6:27] know and and Zechariah 4 12 of oil
[6:30] coming pouring through the pipes and
[6:32] said this is my spirit oil and another
[6:34] thing if you want to see Matthew
[6:36] 14:25 there was a foolish virgin 253 the
[6:40] foolish virgin had no ARL no spirit and
[6:44] Matthew 254 the wise virgin had or in
[6:47] her land
[6:49] Spirit now or typifies spirit and
[6:56] wine
[6:57] symbolizes stimul ation of
[7:04] Revelation oh I like to run all over the
[7:06] place want didn't wake up the
[7:08] neighborhood when the Lord show me
[7:10] that
[7:12] stimulation of
[7:15] Revelation oil and wine in the Bible is
[7:19] associated together
[7:22] always I got the concordians look the
[7:24] streak of that like like that where wine
[7:27] and oil goes together all of night see
[7:30] because when the Revelation has been
[7:34] given of a
[7:35] truth of God and the True Believer
[7:39] filled with oil and the Revelation is
[7:42] revealed the stimulation becomes so
[7:45] great that he makes him behave himself
[7:48] [Music]
[7:57] unnormal Hall
[8:00] see that's what's matter with him
[8:02] now then what does it
[8:06] say to this Rider in Black don't you
[8:10] hurt my wine and my oil don't you touch
[8:15] it my y or I've got just a little bit of
[8:20] it down there but he's still a little
[8:21] bit
[8:22] [Music]
[8:24] there now you can go on through and
[8:26] measure out all that kind of Life at
[8:28] you're putting out that up to you you're
[8:30] going to pay for it down there but when
[8:32] you come across that wine or you leave
[8:34] it
[8:35] alone now listen here and I and I Heard
[8:38] a Voice in the midst of the four Beast
[8:42] what was it the
[8:44] [Music]
[8:44] [Applause]
[8:45] [Music]
[8:50] lamb what's the four
[8:53] Beast the lamb said
[8:55] it
[8:57] wow go take his own that belongs to
[9:00] him amen don't you touch that or I sir
[9:05] not the four beast but the lamb was the
[9:07] one that said it oh my
[9:11] amen the lamb not the four Beast didn't
[9:14] announce this the lamb said itself well
[9:16] to the best of my understanding and the
[9:21] best of that I know I and with all that
[9:25] I believe in my heart that's the true me
[9:29] meaning of those three seals I want to
[9:33] thank God for it I'll say this that it's
[9:36] a
[9:38] revelation that he gave
[9:40] me he gave that to me the revelation of
[9:45] and I do believe that we're living in
[9:48] the last
[9:49] days he's the
[9:52] [Music]
[9:54] word
[9:58] wonderful
