========================================

fight with some little temporal blessing that's falling for the bride amen the letter rain is falling for the bride amen but they are feeding of it amen because the wheat and the tears were sewn together right amen so we shouldn't be impressed let them carry on we have a much greater work Hallelujah you know I was thinking about the scripture Revelation 10 and what you try and do is you prophesy again to people and what you're really showing them is an open book yes and you tell them look here look here what are you showing them look for your name in the family album amen and then they look and they say no I can't see it they can't find the name in the family album amen but it's only the predestinator that will see the name in the family album amen so then you don't waste much time with them you go on to the next person can you see your name in the family album some say no I see I'm a chicken yeah but I was reading and they say yes I'm an eagle amen but we got to keep searching amen hallelujah amen Let's uh turn to Revelation chapter 10. amen who speak a little thought on the word plus spirit in the midst of his super Church amen amen we must have both the word plus spirit in the midst of a super church amen so Revelation chapter 10 verse 8 familiar portion of scripture we're going to read it again amen and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the end of the angel with standard upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book amen and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in the amount sweet as honey now this is really a revelation we've got to get if we don't get this revelation we are going to be like the scribes and the Pharisees who when the manifested word was in their midst Jesus Christ they kept saying we have Moses and the law we have the written word so this is now a new change in Revelation 10 it's moved from a one-man scripture of the Prophet he's off the scene and the word that he spoke is now ought to be manifested in a people and if we are not looking for the Fulfillment of everything brother Branham said in our lives then we are looking like the prophet says in a review mirror in a day gone by amen so this is a changing dispensation we are in the midst of it 10 10 says I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it up my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen now if you go to Revelation 13 you'll know that he is oppressing people's Nations tongues and kings that's why your prophecy is to those Nations amen tongues and Kings amen let's bow for prayer Lord we come before you now and we thank you Lord for the reading of your word and Lord we bless your Holy Name father what a privilege and an honor father it is to come into the house of the Lord and Lord to be gathered together with Believers of Life precious Faith oh God lord we rub shoulders of the world and worldly people during the course of the day because of our jobs and circumstances Lord but father Lord if we count as a privileged Lord to be gathered with people who believe the same word the same Revelation law and father whose names are in the family album Lord Jesus father God and Lord we come now Lord you sit around your word in the evening time and Lord just Fellowship around your word and father to be encouraged with your word Lord Jesus we see Lord nations are shaking oh God and the economies are shaking Lord Jesus and Lord you said everything that can be shaken will be shaken oh God but we know Lord your word Will Never Be Shaken oh god father Lord all foundations will shake father the Lord on Christ the solid rock we stand and all other ground is sinking sand Lord Jesus we thank you Lord that you have called us opened up our eyes of our understanding Lord Jesus father even as we sit around your word now father Lord I pray Lord that we bind and we come against every Spirit that's not of you Lord Jesus every tiredness every Spirit Lord of sleepiness and father we come now Lord sit around your word and may you open up your word to us we ask it in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated amen Hallelujah amen how many of you were blessed on Sunday with the service yeah amen so we were just wondering on this you know the angel of the Lord came to the prophet on 7th of May you know that 1946 right and Israel apparently celebrating the 17th seventh year anniversary because they became a nation right and uh I didn't actually forgot it was the 7th of May on Sunday it was only on Monday that I realized that that was the day that the angel of the Lord came into the cave and met the prophet but you know God knows how to fix things sometimes amen because Sunday we were speaking about the eleventh hour Gentile workers in partnership with the angel of the Lord amen and think of it the same day seventh may he came to the prophet and he formed a partnership with the prophet and look at how God tied it up on the 7th of May I've completely forgotten and the title is amen what was our title the eleventh hour Gentile workers in partnership with the angel of the Lord so you can see even he fixes things amen I was talking to a few people and they're saying wow they were astounded and even my wife might mention do you think that was like a sign you know because that's how God fixes things amen amen the same way now you walk through the prophet like we read Revelation 10 sequence he's now coming to partner with the bride that's what that 11 23 was all about amen you can see that the 11 is the 11th Hour Gentile workers and we're in partnership with the angel of the Lord amen amen and that's going to give you the ability to speak amen yes amen he never the prophet in his ministry was to get the rainbow trout the only thing that could produce and make him catch the rainbow trout was the third pool first to pull he couldn't produce that yes but he said at the third pool amen and what was the third pool you know you went to Sabino Canyon amen we'll make touch on a few things there amen but let's go to one of the first things brother Branham tells us now he says in the last stage are we living in the last age amen no more ages after us yes amen what a glorious time to be living in amen amen there will be a group rise up can we make a present tense is a group risen up the true Bride of the last day and she will listen to the holy spirit amen now there's many voices in the world right now like there were voices in Eden the voice of the serpent amen there was the voice of Adam there was the voice of Eve amen even now there's the voice of the Beast to Beast there's the voice of the church world there's a voice of Amen a politician politics demon powers so many voices but whose voice is the one who is rising up the Bride of Jesus Christ she will listen to the holy spirit amen amen and how is the holy spirit speaking he is pouring himself out through the faithful Ministry now you may get upset with that you may be uneasy with that you may not want to accept it but that is God's plan yes amen he said through the fight for Ministry if you read Ephesians 4 you'll see that God is working through the faithful Ministry amen you know there's a quote the way the prophet says that's God's dress with yes amen Hallelujah I don't hear everybody saying amen amen hallelujah just check if your neighbor is okay check if there's a pulse amen and Hallelujah amen now here's the first commandment I mean if you know what the first commandment is if you write the scripture down amen this is the first commandment Mark 12 29-30 Jesus is telling us what the first commandment is and Jesus answered him and said the first of all the Commandments is Yo Israel the Lord our God is one Lord amen right and then Jesus further goes on to say and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind amen amen and with all thy strength amen and in reaffirms this is the first commandment amen so you have to love the Lord your God with all thy heart all thy soul with all thy mind and with all thy strength amen now if you love the Lord that way amen if not then that's what we should desire Lord help me to Love You This Way amen amen that's your entire being now now the prophet of God tells us that love and faith has to go together right we just showed you there that you have to love the Lord your God and when you love the Lord your God he says love produces faith amen so the first and foremost thing before you can have faith you've got to have love for God Amen you've got to have love for his word then it won't be Grievous to you to spend time with him because you love him your love his presence your love is word amen amen and that love starts to produce a fruit in you because you know that God is his word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and then the word became flesh yes yes so God is no different from his word amen amen God is his word so the love for God's word produces faith amen the love for God's word is producing faith in you and me amen Faith cometh by the sharing of the word hearing the word of God Amen so perfect Faith you can see is coming when you see yourself in the word yes yes perfect Faith doesn't come when you see John's Ministry perfect free doesn't come when you see the disciples Ministry perfect faith comes when you see yourself in the word and you recognize your part of the word amen amen amen right now I am manifesting scripture amen I am fulfilling scripture you are fulfilling scripture amen that's how Jesus was walking while they were reading from the Scrolls and the text Jesus was the manifested word walking in their presence living out the scriptures yes amen so when we recognize ourselves as being part of the word that is producing a perfect Faith within us amen amen Hallelujah and perfect Faith remember came to this boy looking at the mirror remember he's looking at himself in the mirror and Revelation struck and he said Mama that's me amen he says Mama that is me and if the bridegroom is a god of the I am the bride his wife who's a part of him he's also has a I am word amen hallelujah so when we look into the word the mirror of God's word you see yourself in Revelation 10 8 to 11 and you say I am John when you look at Revelation 19 amen you say I am the bride who has made herself ready you look at Malachi 4 5 and you say I am the you that Elijah is sent to these scriptures are written for me if there was no you there was no purpose to send Elijah there had to be a you because the prophecy is directed to you the prophecy is not directed to William Branham he doesn't say behold William Branham I'm going to send you to a people he says behold I send you Elijah the prophet yeah amen so that word is written directly to you so we see ourselves in the scripture and this is producing a perfect Faith within us because others read that scripture and it is foreign to them yes nobody can personalize your scriptures like you can amen nobody can personalize the scriptures like I can amen I am John where do you know of beside the message of the hour that came by the prophet message that the people stand up and recognize themselves as being John of Revelation 10. you show me a church outside of the message of the hour you show me a church that can say that they understand revelation 19. amen the marriage of the Lamb is come and his bride has made herself ready and to her was given amen robes amen garments find linen they don't have fine linen out there in the churches amen amen they are filthiness amen they have brought amen willingness into the church you're going to the church and it's like a disco in there amen amen and I saw I was telling amen some of the brothers here amen I saw that when it was there in seed form and another Pastor the other day I was shouting to him and he confirmed the same thing Amen in seed form and you'll remember this there was a song and you know the prophet always tells you the spirits attached to things there was a song that came in on the scene that changed the entire way that the church started to worship and the way they started to amen bring things into the church and that song was a song called Stomp because Stomp past the Christian World they call it cross it crossed over into the secular world and they started to play it in nightclubs such was the beat so enticing was the wrapping and the lyrics that it engross the entire world and the demon that was in Kirk Franklin is another shell out like Elvis Presley amen hallelujah Spirits don't die yes amen amen and I remember I was working at King's Music and these denominational passages used to come over there and tell me we don't know what we're going to do because we are losing our young people to the world they're going into the clubs and they're hearing the songs there so what we're going to do and this is exactly I'm quoting now they said we'll we'll buy some light because they should sell lights there they started to bring those lights into the church and they said we'll play stomp in the church why should our young people be dancing out there when they can be dancing in the church and that's how they brought the worldliness into the church tell me before that time you went to do most churches denominational churches and there was a reverence about them then there was another spirit that entered and it was a through a lady called Darlene prior to that there was no woman worship leaders you know it yeah but through satility they started to introduce this thing you know that back in the day too even though there were a few women preachers it wasn't in the mess hmm help us amen but these things started to you're not whole the prophet had some Choice words for the church back then he was living now oh my my my my mind Hey man Hallelujah amen amen here's what brother Neville says in this message a true sign that's overlooked this is not the prophet speaking now brother never is speaking and I found this there and he says determined to display your faith in a manifest fashion you see even back there brother Neville was getting it don't just leave it in a written form determined to display your faith in a manifest fashion faith is never work don't think of Faith as something tedious Faith spoken of is no good higher faith I have faith I have faith but Faith demonstrated is the order of the Bible amen your faith in action amen oh bless the name of Jesus and you're the prophet of God in the church is booked now he says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst amen are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst yes amen we are sufficiently impressed with the word but now catch a revelation of what I'm saying of the word in our midst amen are you happy with yourself is what I'm asking you if you are the manifested word right now are you happy with yourself is God happy with you that you are living a manifested life amen that every day when you get up and you step out of your house amen you become a living word that's walking around you become the hands of God you become the feet of God you become the the ears of God amen amen are you impressed with the word in our midst amen now I want to bring it back to the written word and I want to bring it back to the revealed word of the hour because that's what came down in Revelation 10 the opening of the word are we sufficiently impressed with the opening of the world because this word is not out there yes yes the word that is found in the message of the hour that came by the prophet William Branham is not out there it's rejected out there but are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst [Music] word in our midst the message of the hour is going to produce in you and I a Rapture rapturing faith faith for your body change yes people read first Thessalonians 4 and the expecting a body change but they do not understand the scripture amen they are never going to have a body change the body changes only for the people that have the Holy Ghost and how is the holy ghost coming oh if you think you can get the Holy Ghost and without pouring out the denominational world and my friend you are blinded right because the message of the hour lose the Holy Ghost amen amen you know they came to the prophet you can read it in sorry to Jesus Jesus was a prophet they came to Jesus in mark 9. and there were some people that were casting out demons and they wanted to know should we stop them and Jesus says no leave them alone because they're casting out in his name as long as they're using the name he says they are not against us you read mark 9. right yes and if you want to see what verse 23 says you go mark it down and you go read it at home amen because Mark 9 verse 23 is a third full scripture amen hallelujah so he says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst now the reason why some of us will not be impressed is because that word is not manifesting in our lives not manifesting so the power of the message is not displayed in US amen what is stifling it what chokes it could read the soul cares of this life choking this is choking that is joking you have a genuine desire but this is choking and that's catching you up and this is catching you up before you know it the month is gone you did nothing before I know it three weeks he's gone four weeks is gone a month two months yeah amen and that's how he's deceiving us amen making us believe that those things are also of importance and of value then you know what months turn into years turn into decades and when you look at yourself in the mirror I once was young but now I'm old now you got a Zeal to do something for the Lord but you don't have the energy [Music] amen maybe you don't have the health the same way that you used to when you were young Hallelujah amen now you know what the prophet says when the word comes amen he says in that day of gross darkness is this the day the light the let come the pillow fire will return by what the pure word did we have the pure word amen amen and we will return to the power of Pentecost amen amen yes I don't know what some people believe about Pentecost because when brother Brahm is talking about Pentecost he's not talking about the Pentecostals that came out to Wesley he is talking about the true Pentecostal are pouring in Acts chapter 2. amen amen now remember in the book of Acts they didn't have a Bible to refer to they have the words of Jesus and Jesus told him when the Holy Ghost comes he will bring things to your remembrance the word that I have spoken amen so they were so dependent upon the holy ghost amen Stephen even then which is standing there and he's being stoned and he begins to speak the Holy Ghost to him he's speaking and why are they are stoning him he breaks out into a vision and he sees the Lord Jesus standing in heaven amen the power of Pentecost amen the power of the Holy Ghost brother Branham says he set the heart to light amen is your heart set a light amen amen I know you now and again you get a burst of Faith you get a burst of the Holy Ghost amen but amen carry 12 and remain within us all the time that we want to turn by the pure word return to the power of Pentecost and welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen when he went away amen he told them Terry here in the city of Jerusalem until you endured with power from on high amen and when the Holy Ghost came the Holy Ghost came amen with power and it came with fire amen amen amen we need some fire in our lives amen amen amen we need some Holy Ghost Fire yes Lord amen amen so with the pure word expect the return of the power of Pentecost the power of Pentecost made them speak in a language that wasn't even their own language yes yes the prophet says the Holy Spirit got a hold of them and they began to speak in a language that all men understood so what you're hearing out there is not the Bible language it's an impersonation it's another genus and generous amen Hallelujah the prophet says it's another Babylon they Babel amen but he says what the pure word we want to turn to the power of Pentecost amen amen are you the living epistle can you see the power of Pentecost can you see the light over the prophet's head on his shoulder amen the supernatural life for the first time amen you don't find this over Billy Graham you don't find us over Oral Roberts you don't find us over a Allen we don't find us over here House born but one man amen amen hallelujah amen amen yes Lord thus shall it be in the day of the son of man amen amen so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed hallelujah amen amen Dynamic power Pentecost hallelujah thank you amen God identifying himself with his Prophet yes and right now I'm telling you once you identify himself with you amen amen yes Lord help us but the difference is we are not as committed as a prophet we are not a sold out as a prophet amen we are not willing to leave our families with that 23 dollars and say I'm going to the cave and I may not come back until I hear from God yes amen I'm asking you in the 23rd year of this millennium will you connect with the angel of God will you partner with the angel of God I don't know how many more sermons he must ask you to partner with him well how much more he must reveal himself to you amen but what is he telling you here if you partner with a pure world you shall see a return of the power of Pentecost amen um amen yes amen you're in another message he says now in this age that we're now living this age it's beyond Pentecost but the church has moved on it's gone into greater more powerful why Amen in Pentecost they didn't have the opening of the word in Pentecost John even wasn't taken up and seen the heavens he wasn't asked to come up higher amen John was one of the Apostles or somebody walk with the prophet chair now and when he is telling you he says the church has moved on Amen High Revelation greater revelation amen the opening of the word the full Plan of Redemption revealed to you and I am en they didn't have an unsealed book to read from they didn't have him and all of these Mysteries yes yes they were walking in the revelation of the son of man yes Hallelujah amen but here he says it's beyond Pentecost but the church has moved on it's gone into greater more powerful amen can I get some witnesses here amen are you believing for it say I am greater and more powerful amen amen amen yeah it's the restoration of the same kind of grain that went into the ground at the beginning what is it the spoken word the prophet now will break it down there what is the original sin what is his title he gives it away there the spoken word is the original sin what is Mark 11 23 if not the spoken word amen amen it's the restoration of the same kind of grain that went into the ground at the beginning bringing back all the fullness of the power of Pentecost by how amen who is the Holy Ghost amen the angel of the Lord amen manifesting himself the fullness of his power of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Ghost see in the last days amen it's even more last days now than in the days of the prophets the closing of we're at the end of the last days we can put it that way amen but he says the same seed spoken word seed is coming back to the fullness of his power amen Sunday we were able to tell you amen that Jesus that God in the beginning said let there be and as long as there was no manifestation it remained when he said let there be light you have to wait to see the manifestation of that spoken word amen the prophet when he spoke you've heard that message he said I wanted to turn and go away the pro the Lord told him but you spoke it yes how long did he wait he said he was three hours late picking up those Brothers but he had to wait amen you see it's not in the speaking and instant do you have free to wait yes we read the quote that sometimes one grain of sand begins to move in their own Mountain yes one grain of sand but because you cannot see it you say oh nothing happened you turn and walk away you disbelieve your own word amen but Mark 11 23 says if you say to this mountain amen be thou removed and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said shall come to pass amen amen speaking is one thing let me be light but you've got to believe your own word what is he trying to teach you how to operate in sonship authority Jesus believed his own word amen you've got to believe your own word amen but sometimes we are looking for instant things afraid to hold on to your spoken word amen free to hold on to the promise and how is he bringing the fullness of the power of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so if you want the fullness of the power of Pentecost what do we need to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and didn't he say the Dynamics of this shirt will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost so every day our cry is refill me Lord amen amen amen Bless The Name of Jesus amen amen he says it's all coming forth of the Holy Spirit oh brother I thought you you know you don't I preach a prophet's message Moses and Aaron stand together yes amen amen amen hallelujah it's overcoming forth of the Holy Spirit what's coming some of it he says all are coming forth of the Holy Spirit until when until the great church is being filled of the great powers of almighty God Amen what's making you a super Church the word and the spirit in the midst of the super church amen amen every other Church oh you know you go to these car shows some of your car enthusiasts and you see these supercharged cars you'll even pay money to go to these shows because you are sufficiently impressed about those cars but now you as an individual form part of the super church amen there's no super church out there yes yes the super church is in the message of the hour amen amen stop letting Satan take you to the bad parts and making you look at the back parts of Israel and you're getting despondent because you're looking at the back parts of Israel hey man come to line up with God's view of the Bride look at her through the blood look at her through the Holy Ghost amen yes amen thank you Lord amen oh he says it's got to a place until the very works that Jesus done is manifesting itself right in the church now amen yes amen amen amen amen I don't believe it's just back there but now it's coming to a place where the very works of Jesus Christ he's being manifested in the church now you believe that now he's being manifested yes amen amen you are the manifestation amen now the prophet will tell us here that how is he manifesting himself now I didn't grab the story here but he takes you to adoption and he tells you about the person that don't have time to train his child but sends them to tutors right so how is he pouring out himself he's looking for somebody who's now gone through their training you've had years of training in the message of the hour God wants to bring you to adoption full adoption he says when a man proves and he just he just finished talking about how God took Jesus on the mountain and he adopted him and he said this is my beloved Son hear he him right so he says when a man proves and God loves him I mean if you believe God loves you amen if you believe you've been proven and God loves you hey man they're in front of angels he does something for him in the presence of his angels he does something for you the individual he lifts him up there in the presence of God and gives him and fills him and sets him out that's the age we are living in amen amen hallelujah amen how many of you can see yourself in that scripture coming to full adoption where the father is pleased with you and he says this is my beloved Son this is my beloved daughter here he him amen amen hallelujah we are in the brink of it and you know what the final stage of adoption is the body change amen amen the final stage is the body change he says when we need it the spirit of God raises the standard what is it he is pouring in his spirit amen catch this now you may not catch this but I want you to catch it it's always at all times that this power wants to go amen he says when we need it the spirit of God raises a standard do we need it now yes do we need the spirit of God now more than ever before just a deception all around without the spirit of God we will also be deceived amen the spirit of God Amen is is coming upon the word and he's giving us Revelation amen how to identify Satan's schemes he says he's pouring in his spirit that those who are resting yearly in the grave or under the altar of God as the scriptures say our crying how long Lord how long how much longer hmm God is waiting on you and me yes all mine who's God waiting on amen pay attention there now what's he saying how long Lord how long how much longer does that ring a bell amen I want to finish the quote First let's just go back to Isaiah right notice there now he's saying when the spirit and the church comes together there's no more scripture for you and I to fulfill next is the only thing left is for the sleeping Saints to come out amen so if we can Unite with the word and fulfill every promise there's nothing left but the resurrection of the Saints amen amen that's why I said slow it down read it properly he said he's pouring itself out in his Spirit now then those who are resting out John in the grave under the altar as the scripture says they're crying how long God is waiting on you and me amen come in line with your scriptures come in line with your part of the prophecy peace who United God fulfill all part of your scriptures then the dead in Christ shall rise amen Hallelujah he says the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power is resurrection that's when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible amongst us amen amen amen you can switch for the Caleb amen amen amen I mean if you are looking for that amen I tell you we're on the brink of this yes I really believe that we are on the brink of this I don't type and now God is pouring in his fullness now as I'm saying this really you know what we're saying when the world is being preached you should be out there receiving it you should be saying Lord pour yourself out in your fullness pour yourself out in your power pour yourself out in your Resurrection Lord Make Me and you sow alike so close together he says to Christ becomes visible amongst us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture amen so after Revelation 10 comes Revelation 11 which is to the Jews so if we are the final part of Revelation 10 and we can identify ourselves as being that John what's left it's only for us to come into alignment with him and as in the spirit being crying even you responded to the spirit's call to align yourself to God in this hour isn't that an expectation in our hearts now that any moment something can happen yes I am amen I have to be consecrating ourselves to the Lord to say Lord we want to walk so close with you amen because the coming of the Lord is so soon amen now if you go back one slide there let's see not there why go back how long how long isn't that fulfilled right so as I'm studying this thing these things connect that's the fifth seal yes the souls under the altar crying how long how long amen so it's not only the souls under the altar crying out long but those in the sixth Dimension are also crying out because that's a temporary Dwelling Place in a temporary party where they don't eat Don't drink don't sleep they know it's a temporary body and why are they crying all along because even there even though your denominational pastors tell you that they are resting in the arms of Jesus um there in the sixth dimension so they are also Longing To See Jesus so they are also crying out how long because can you imagine they are one step closer to us one dimension away from Jesus and they're crying out along but who's holding up ask your brother why are you holding us up now see you don't want to talk to one another ask your brother why are you holding us up God is waiting on you okay maybe you don't want to say that way tell them God is waiting on you and me tell them wake up God is waiting waiting amen God puts a responsibility back on us amen now Something Told me go to the fulfill amen so I go to the fulfill and I come across this because here in the fulfill he says I'm going to speak in the revelation of my faith what happened in Supino Canyon the other day I believe the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored amen amen and the glorious power of the creator Hallelujah but you've got to be the one to produce it what is he tying this now now if you're really spiritual I'm gonna break it down in a minute or two what happened in Japan came into his hand he says it's leaking sword what is it he says it's the word and he says this is the third pool so he is telling you here I believe that the owl is approaching when missing limbs will be restored amen and the glorious power of the creator amen will be seen in you and I yes you are going to be able to speak these things that's right Jesus spoke to the man with with that hand the power of the spoken word but you've got to recognize yourself as being the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you've got to recognize yourself it's he in you greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world amen he says I'm speaking the revelation of my feet the Yahweh is approaching why is he saying it in The Sixth Seal fulfill that's the seal that's uncovering the mystery of who is saying how long but in that seal where he says how long he's revealing this the power of the spoken word tying it to the third pool amen now many times we preach unto you and we tell you these Mysteries beneath it sealed you've got to be able to catch it amen these are some of the things he's pouring there nuggets nuggets nuggets but if your Source focused on the opening of the seal itself to you know to uncover the rider to uncover this you're going to miss the Mysteries beneath the seal amen amen he says now yes a quote we're ready before I'm going to read it again the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for two thousand years can we close with the generator noise amen the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years who found it denominations bounded amen and it's to be loosed where in the evening time is it the evening time amen so who lost it he says by the evening time message they didn't know about the Holy Ghost and how its operation till William Branham came in on the scene that's why they still regard him that's why they still study his ministry his life is because through his ministry the Holy Spirit was left loose amen and the Holy Ghost was let loose for who for William Bradham alone but to everyone that followed the evening time message amen the Holy Ghost is an access to you amen desire the Holy Ghost amen seek after the Holy Ghost oh you see why do you say that I'm telling you we need to enter more deeper and deeper and deeper and say more and more and more and more of you Lord yes my cup fill me up Lord until I overflow amen I'm not satisfied with the poor partial outpouring but I want more can I get somebody to testify that they want more amen more Lord more power more anointing more of you Lord yes amen amen amen don't settle for just a little outpouring don't settle for amen for for half a cup yes say Lord fill me up Lord Jesus amen amen I wanted Lord Jesus yes you know sometimes you apply for jobs and they tell you you're not qualified amen tell the Lord Lord I'm qualified for this amen amen you chose me for this end time age yes you don't choose Paul for the end time you don't choose Martin irenius and Columba and Luther and Wesley and all of these people you chose me to peer at the coming of the Lord Lord you have some confidence in me Lord whatever you saw in me let me see it in myself Lord Jesus let me see my myself in your word yes amen the Lord chose you for this hour the Lord called you for this hour the Lord elected you for this hour oh somebody ought to praise the Lord yes Lord thank you Lord thank you thank you amen amen thank you amen Hallelujah now this is an important quote because let's skip one slide and go to the next one skip this yeah then it's important not to place and how you place the manifestation right the problem is going to teach us some things here he says you can't claim that the manifestation is the evidence follow now because he's building to something you can't claim the manifestation is the evidence of being Spirit born spirit filled no sir because gifts and callings are without repentance right I will admit that the true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing Mighty Acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being Spirit-filled even though that that individual as an abundance of those manifestations right right this is deep teaching now but I want you to get something here he says the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of Our Lord it is receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word and The Works would follow now for all the people on the Earth right now who has the word amen amen so that's why we are looking for the second part it's because these signs shall follow them they believe amen we are the one with the true word we are the one with the true opening of the word and those words must follow the believer amen yes Lord got you yes amen thank you we've got to place it in the right order out there they chase the works first they leave the world they reject the word they hate the word amen are we forgetting that they don't but they believe in the trilogy of gods are we forgetting they don't even have water baptism right yes are we forgetting they reject the very scriptures that we show them but we have a general message of the Hour the full restoration of the word amen and when the word comes amen and we align ourselves with the spirit it makes us a super Church makes us a super race yes amen and produces the super faith in us amen he says I am the word if you want deity in your midst amen welcome and receive the word amen amen I know every one of you have received the word for your day you've recognize the word for your day dear T is in our midst yes not only is deity now deity unveiled that we are amateur gods deity told us we are Sons and Daughters of God amen don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word not your wife not your husband not your children not your girlfriend yes young man young girl if your girlfriend or your boyfriend I'm talking gender stranger now right please take it in line what I'm saying go es now man well girl if your boyfriend is taking you away from the word leave them leave them yes in the in the first place you shouldn't be with the Jezebel yeah amen I like the way she makes me color her toes sure you know the prophet says oh he's got two toes the girl couldn't leave the boy he's got such curly hair going after kind of things I don't tell if the boy looks as ugly as me it's okay amen if you want deity in your midst welcome and receive the word amen amen don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and the word why what did we say in the beginning who is the word god love God Amen love is word that word will produce faith faith will produce the works right this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that he's talking about Jesus Christ now right Jesus is telling them they're in the Pokemon Church age I am the word so in his word he's giving us a revelation of Jesus Christ but you cannot tell me that you got a complete revelation of Jesus Christ without having a revelation of yourself because having a revelation of Jesus Christ gives you the and the Mystery secret that was locked up inside of him which is the revelation of the Bride that's the true revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen Jesus is incomplete without his bride that's right amen like Eve was taken out of Adam the full revelation of Jesus Christ is you amen for the complete revelation you become part of that story he says Let me give your thoughts here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name and there isn't any answer yet 1 John 5 14 we are told this is the confidence we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he here with us and we know that he hears whatsoever we ask we know that we have our petitions we decide of him now a lot of you have asked maybe you haven't seen it come to pass it is coming amen believe it is coming amen you ask the Lord yes you didn't ask him a closer you didn't ask fail on Service delivery do not equate my god with the anti-government until he failed in Service delivery he says whatsoever you ask we know that we are petitions that we decide of him amen now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God Amen if it isn't in the word you can't have it ah all right [Music] if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the world and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name amen there it is again Jesus the name is the word amen and he puts in Brackets the will Jesus is the will right of the father of the Sun of the Holy Ghost know what they say in Catholics hey but in his name Jesus the name is the word is the will you can't separate God in the word they are one amen amen now I'm gonna tell you that you can't separate you and the world impossible if it's really reveals you can't surprise separate from the word Hallelujah you are the word made flesh today so heavens and earth may pass away but you the word will never pass away amen you've got eternal life okay we're heading up to now to a conclusion here now the word that he left behind on us in the printed page is part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life and I pray that we are laboring to enter into a spiritual life now watch what we said the spirit and word right that's what he's bringing it down to now the word coming into a spiritual life he said that his word was life he gives you the scripture right I am the way the truth in life if any man if not the spirit of Christ he is none of him so if you don't have the Holy Spirit you are none of him no rapture there it is he is the spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is exactly what Jesus is is the word so when is Spirit born this is what I'm getting to know when his Spirit born spiritual man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is same as deity speaking amen amen Every Mountain has got to go yes amen amen you can't climb the mountain speak to the mountain amen maybe you turned and walked away I want you to go back to that mountain amen say listen yeah I come back with more faith in fact this time I'm coming back with perfect faith Mountain to stand before the Aruba Bell hmm Thou shalt be made a plane amen if you turned away and walked away from your situation if you turn and walked away from this mountain I want you to go back he says remember the title now the word plus spirit amen in the midst of a super Church here's the word coming to his Spirit born spirit for man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips where must you what is he telling you come back to the spoken word amen come back to the third pool anointing if you're going to be chasing first pool second pool not going to work in this time come back to your authority sonship authority and I'm empowered to speak place the word upon your lips why it's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go amen amen amen stay there till it goes don't leave till it goes Satan cannot stand before that man amen stop telling me Satan is always before you you know what you're telling me the word hasn't come into your spirit born Sunday oh Satan is on my back what are you doing on your bed you know we used to call it balata eh they call it what's he like piggyback why are you giving him piggyback right Satan cannot stand before that man yes amen the other walk into the room and people get uneasy demons start to manifest that's why Satan cannot stand before that man why did he say Satan is powerless before you because of your Revelation amen you know all of his games you know it's nothing but a bluff amen that's why even in your home when you see him coming in you the priest of your home Authority cast The Demon out Satan cannot stand before that man you are an adopted son of God Satan cannot stand before you Satan is powerless before you don't go there and whomper somebody in authority you ever saw a policeman come here a man in authority speaks with authority if the church the church way back then that third age only and only held on to the revelation of the Living Word in their midst the power of God would not have faded as he did in those Dark Ages why I'm reading this we can see this pattern people are not holding on to the revelation of the Living Word in this hour and you can see the power of God fading don't let it be us hold on to the revelation of the Living Word that's in your midst God in you you know you know sometimes and I'm saying this now you don't even believe that God is in you you don't have a revelation of yourself it's like you can Rejoice with it but when you walk away from you do you really realize that you are God on the Earth God in the midst of you the power of God will not have faded if you see the power of God fading from your life know that you are not holding to the revelation of the word in your midst get back to reading his word amen build yourself upon the most holy word yes amen amen come on super Church come on super race amen and right today we're gonna close now and right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without a doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again amen amen I'm telling you we are building up to something and right now you may be tied in your body maybe right now it's going over your head what I am telling you but when the church returns to the word in faith amen if you left your first love for the word if it's become stale and boring to you return to the word in faith amen come back to the word amen and you shall see the glory of God in your life amen amen you shall see the wonderful acts of God in your midst again amen yes amen hallelujah he says I believe if he can make a squirrel appear here is the man or woman just call him missing punch and that's a complete animal in itself he is God I love him this is the second part of the quote that he spoke about the missing limb he said if you can make an entire squirrel appear out of nothing what is a missing limb to him he says but I believe we are living in the hour where missing limbs will be spoken back amen and you know what I've seen it you've seen it yes how did you see missing limbs I'll give you a testimony one time there was a church went into complete blackout and the church is the body of Christ and he spoke the missing limbs back you are one of those limbs you were one of those limbs that's come back into the body you are with it in your denomination you're with it in your tradition yes yes with it in your religious thing but when the world came the opening of the world you know the opening of the word is the third pool amen that's the first part of the word the third pull the opening of the word when he began to call your name [Music] that's in the spiritual sense now every limb came back to the body is now fitly framed amen he had come down upon the body amen but now in the physical sense you stand up to your Authority recognize who you are as the son of God amen amen and I tell you when the church Rises to our full potential I know right now we are not at our full potential
