[3:53] amen you've got your Bible to return to
[3:56] the Book of Genesis chapter 18.
[4:04] foreign
[4:08] remember before God deals with
[4:13] abrahamia
[4:15] we know in the Book of Genesis we also
[4:18] doubted Noah
[4:19] he had to give him a visitation to tell
[4:22] him about the oncoming storms of
[4:24] judgment
[4:25] and he had to reveal to Noah what he was
[4:27] going to do to the Earth
[4:29] and by divine inspiration
[4:34] instructed Noah what to do and how to
[4:36] prepare for the flood that was coming
[4:38] yes
[4:39] but prior to that God had in our country
[4:43] and God revealed to Enoch what he's
[4:46] going to do and Enoch walked with God
[4:52] in other words
[4:54] the level that he walked were not in
[4:57] man's level
[4:59] he walked with a level that that please
[5:02] God
[5:03] he walked with a level where he
[5:05] understood the ways of God
[5:07] amen he understood the plans of God he
[5:10] understood what God wants amen
[5:13] amen he didn't look at eyes through the
[5:15] wisdom of man he looked at life and the
[5:18] Earth at that time he looked at it to
[5:20] God's eyes yes amen because he was a
[5:22] prophet
[5:23] and God took him away amen and God did
[5:27] the same thing to Noah
[5:29] when Noah began to
[5:31] prepare the ark
[5:33] you're looking at what's going to happen
[5:35] not to the scientific age that he lived
[5:38] in yes because the scientific gate was a
[5:40] negative age right the scientific age
[5:42] would have took him away from God's plan
[5:45] but he persevered with God's plan
[5:48] and he continued preaching the same
[5:50] gospel amen absolutely the flood came
[5:53] amen
[5:55] the Book of Genesis chapter 18 verse 16.
[5:59] and then man rose up from dance and
[6:02] looked towards Elementary and the men
[6:04] rose up on theirs and looked towards
[6:07] Sodom and Abraham went with them to
[6:11] when with them to bring them on the way
[6:15] and the Lord said shall I hide from
[6:18] Abraham the thing which I do
[6:20] seeing that Abraham
[6:23] shall surely become a great and mighty
[6:26] nation amen and all the nations of the
[6:30] Earth shall be blessed in him
[6:33] for I know him
[6:36] you see godhead the Gentiles in his
[6:38] thoughts at the same time
[6:42] for I know him that he will command his
[6:46] children
[6:48] does God know us this morning amen amen
[6:50] that we will command our households
[6:54] and he's our Lord after him in other
[6:57] words are you going to pass this message
[6:59] on that will become an heritage
[7:05] and they shall keep the way of the Lord
[7:09] what is the way of the Lord in this hour
[7:11] to believe the message of the hour to
[7:15] believe what God has done in this hour
[7:17] than to believe what he's going to do
[7:19] amen
[7:21] hello
[7:25] and they shall keep the way of the Lord
[7:27] to do justice and judgments that the
[7:31] Lord may bring upon Abraham that which
[7:34] he had spoken of him
[7:38] and the Lord said because the Cry of
[7:40] Sacrament tomorrow is greatness
[7:43] and because their sin is very Grievous
[7:48] do we see let us believe us today let
[7:51] the Cry of Sodom is great
[7:53] do we see that the sun is Grievous
[7:56] do we see there is that by the
[7:58] revelation of the word we cannot digest
[8:00] that
[8:01] as a Believer born and now that your
[8:04] part of God you you won't be able to
[8:06] digest what is happening in the certain
[8:09] condition
[8:12] I will go down now
[8:14] and see whether they have done all
[8:17] together according to the Cry of it
[8:19] which is common to me and if not I will
[8:22] know and the men tender faces from the
[8:24] end then went towards Sodom but Abraham
[8:28] stood yet before the Lord amen
[8:32] homosexual Revelation chapter 11 verse
[8:35] 14.
[8:39] Revelation 11 14. the second war is
[8:41] passed
[8:43] old the third world cometh quickly
[8:47] amen thank God for the reading of his
[8:48] word
[8:51] the second war is passed
[8:55] two world wars are gone all right
[8:58] beyond the Third Woe cometh quickly yes
[9:03] all right
[9:04] yes Second World War I finished
[9:09] in 1945
[9:12] from then to now
[9:14] we had rumors of wars we have the cold
[9:17] Wars
[9:19] that was going on for so many years
[9:22] but we're living in an hour
[9:24] where there's not going to be a cold war
[9:27] this is going to be a real war
[9:31] and the third world war has dawned upon
[9:34] the people and they not sensitized to it
[9:38] because man has become desensitized amen
[9:42] imagine that this morning we're going to
[9:44] speak on the world's perception of
[9:47] modern day events
[9:49] as influenced by the media we know the
[9:52] media is
[9:53] through the fourth dimension
[9:55] and contrast the faith civilization
[9:59] which is being influenced by prophecy
[10:03] amen you believe this morning you're
[10:04] part of the faith civilization amen
[10:07] I mean God is not going to come and
[10:10] reveal his word to us
[10:12] and show us that this world is going to
[10:15] be destroyed and there's going to be
[10:18] another new Earth created for us if it
[10:21] first didn't have a people have subjects
[10:24] for that Civilization amen amen he had
[10:27] to come and reveal to us that you are
[10:29] none of those ones
[10:31] you have to come reveal to us that your
[10:33] nature is your friends
[10:36] that you are part of me there's a gene
[10:39] that a place within you and when this
[10:41] word has come to you that Gene now
[10:43] Springs forth to life and
[10:45] and he began to develop and you started
[10:48] your spiritual journey
[10:50] from justification to sanctification to
[10:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:56] and then when you got the baptism of the
[10:59] Holy Ghost you are now being influent
[11:02] from another world
[11:04] but here we find the world's perception
[11:07] of all the things that are happening
[11:09] right now
[11:11] he's influenced by media and we know the
[11:15] media the mainstream media they are
[11:18] influenced From Another Dimension
[11:20] because why it's a scientific influence
[11:29] people underestimate the power of the
[11:31] media
[11:35] despite the fact that he's been used to
[11:37] overthrow governments
[11:40] do you know the media is more powerful
[11:42] than a nuclear bomb
[11:44] right the nuclear bomb is a destroy
[11:46] everybody but the media is so powerful
[11:50] then you can overthrow a government
[11:52] you saw what happened in Arab Spring
[11:55] to take this dictator so many years from
[11:57] being there nobody could touch them
[12:00] but he took social media
[12:03] to destroy the those dictators
[12:07] the major can break summer break the
[12:10] influence of somebody
[12:13] he can kill somebody's character
[12:17] the media can start and end the war
[12:24] the media
[12:25] can help or in the economic growth
[12:30] that's right
[12:33] it imposed modern time this is the time
[12:35] we're living now with advancement in
[12:38] media and especially with the majority
[12:40] of the world's population online because
[12:43] almost everybody is online you can't do
[12:45] any business you can't do any stuff you
[12:47] can't do anything without being online
[12:49] now
[12:50] it's almost impossible to find people
[12:53] who are not being influenced by what
[12:55] they view in the media
[12:59] from your latest fashions
[13:03] because you find the latest trends going
[13:05] on yeah
[13:07] whatever they use the latest Trend
[13:08] people follow it
[13:10] that's how people find the fashion
[13:13] your interior and actually in your home
[13:15] design so there's nothing that we can do
[13:16] if we don't see something that we we
[13:19] noticed on the media and the media can
[13:21] be used for good or you could be used
[13:23] for that right we get our ideas from
[13:25] there
[13:26] yeah
[13:28] oh intuitive destinations if you want to
[13:30] go for a holiday you will be influenced
[13:32] by what you see in the media before you
[13:34] go on holiday something got your
[13:36] attention something had to be advertised
[13:38] through the media and you decide this is
[13:40] a place I want to go
[13:44] that your career choices
[13:46] when you choose a career choice you'll
[13:47] see what is the best careers what is the
[13:49] latest career Trend what is the creators
[13:51] needed
[13:52] it's through the media
[13:56] somehow somebody is being influenced by
[13:59] the media
[14:02] but what I'm talking about now in the
[14:04] context
[14:05] of the modern day events
[14:08] we're talking about the wars that are
[14:10] happening right now right
[14:13] people's perception
[14:16] of what's taking place right now in
[14:18] Ukraine and Russia people's perception
[14:21] are what's taking place in the economic
[14:24] crisis
[14:25] people's perception of what's taking
[14:27] place with the oil
[14:29] all being influenced by the media
[14:33] but when God went to Abraham
[14:36] he revealed him why he was going to
[14:38] destroy Solomon tomorrow
[14:40] amen he revealed to him because of the
[14:43] condition
[14:44] [Music]
[14:49] no matter becomes so desensitized
[14:53] and been influenced by the way they've
[14:55] been fed through the medium of the
[14:57] fourth dimension
[14:58] that they wouldn't take
[15:00] the word of God and and see what God's
[15:03] word says about it
[15:05] now nowhere in the world or in the
[15:09] church world or in any religious World
[15:11] they will understand these things
[15:13] outside the message of the hour amen
[15:16] amen because God come and brought down
[15:18] the seals and already revealed what's
[15:21] going to happen
[15:22] yes amen he reached to us every nation's
[15:26] part in Prophecy yes
[15:28] yes we know where America's place is
[15:32] that you will speak after the Dragon
[15:34] she will become the mouthpiece yes
[15:37] we know that she ran away
[15:39] from Europe so freedom of religion yes
[15:43] and she was a great it was a great
[15:45] beautiful country typing Israel
[15:48] but they come an hour where she now must
[15:51] speak be the mouthpiece for the dragon
[15:53] amen and then she will go and persecute
[15:56] she will be the influence to go and
[15:59] persecute the true Christian amen
[16:03] America has become the police of the
[16:05] world
[16:06] but through the media and to propaganda
[16:09] America seems like the heroes of the
[16:11] world
[16:12] whenever there's a war whenever there's
[16:14] a conflict America want to go and
[16:16] interfering
[16:17] but if people can understand through the
[16:19] world that he was trying to control
[16:21] things
[16:22] and there was reason why they were
[16:24] trying to control things
[16:27] that's why the prophet said what when
[16:29] Russia goes down there and get control
[16:32] of the oil
[16:34] now Russia is not the Antichrist
[16:38] but the media puts it as Russia is this
[16:41] horrible person this horrible country
[16:43] and horrible Nation
[16:45] but Russia is only a tool in the hand of
[16:48] God Amen
[16:49] the prophet of God said
[16:52] before in World War II
[16:55] he spoke about France he spoke about
[16:57] them he said
[17:06] he said notice in France
[17:08] they started all their rottenness
[17:11] and going on the way they lived over
[17:14] there
[17:15] and then God sent Germany into them
[17:19] see their condition wasn't right
[17:22] then there had to be a tool
[17:24] to beat them up a little bit
[17:27] then we went over there to save their
[17:29] eyes and as soon as we done that and won
[17:32] the war send the Germans back at peace
[17:35] of France
[17:37] did they jump to God no sir woman why
[17:41] debauchery send them folks to the guilds
[17:46] then what do they do what happened yeah
[17:48] is where it started the devil set up his
[17:52] headquarters day
[17:53] [Music]
[17:54] there he there is where he started right
[17:58] there to demoralize the world from Paris
[18:01] and France right but we know also in
[18:04] that wow what happened there the Jews
[18:06] were interfered with because God had to
[18:09] also use that to get Jews back to the
[18:11] Homeland yes right because every wise
[18:14] dealing with the Jews
[18:16] even in the third world wow we know
[18:18] what's going to happen there
[18:19] you must come back to the Jews
[18:23] but we thank God
[18:24] that between that second world war and
[18:26] the Third World War
[18:28] a mysterious thing took place upon the
[18:30] Earth amen amen
[18:32] amen
[18:33] [Music]
[18:34] and therefore we are now being
[18:37] influenced
[18:38] by prophecy in this hour
[18:41] we are being influenced by what's been
[18:43] revealed in this hour
[18:45] and when we are being influent but then
[18:47] I become part of that word we become
[18:49] that prophetic voice in this hour amen
[18:52] amen we become that prophetic voice with
[18:54] prophetic actions with thus save the
[18:57] Lord
[18:58] that we are told that this very Russia
[19:01] is going to be used as a tool in the
[19:03] hand of God and it will destroy amen
[19:06] amen America it will destroy Vatican yes
[19:09] because that is prophesied amen
[19:14] no matter what the picture the media
[19:16] paints
[19:18] we know that America leaves NATO
[19:21] she is the leading nation in nature and
[19:23] now she got upset because Saudi Arabia
[19:26] wanted to manipulate the oil prices she
[19:29] wants to control the oil prices
[19:33] she wants to control all things
[19:36] and because why she if she wants to
[19:38] apply sanction from somebody she will do
[19:40] that
[19:42] and that's why when she goes into
[19:43] Washington running after oil or control
[19:45] of resources
[19:47] that's what Y is about
[19:49] when the world first World War I took
[19:51] place it was to reshape Europe the
[19:53] second world war the same thing it was
[19:54] to reshape Europe but the third world
[19:57] war he's gonna put the wall out of keita
[20:00] he's gonna he's gonna reshape the entire
[20:03] world Amen
[20:08] because why
[20:09] God is preparing a fake civilization
[20:12] amen amen a people that don't influenced
[20:15] by the Scientifics of civilization God
[20:18] is preparing a people he has subject
[20:21] upon the Earth that will believe every
[20:23] word of his amen that will take his
[20:26] words
[20:27] we're not debate with his words yes you
[20:29] want to take his word we'll never
[20:30] consecrated life
[20:33] because why nothing in this world can
[20:37] give them what he's offered them he's
[20:41] offered them eternal life he's offered
[20:43] them an eternal home
[20:45] and there's one in this day who's made
[20:48] up in the time of this great astronaut
[20:51] age yes yes amen he passed through and
[20:54] he went to the other dimension and he
[20:57] saw what it's like amen
[21:00] okay
[21:06] he says at the evening time events are
[21:10] made clear by prophecy what's taking
[21:13] place in the modern hour
[21:15] can be easily identified if you'll just
[21:19] believe the prophecy of the hour amen
[21:23] but do men want to believe prophecy
[21:25] they want to run to the media
[21:27] you don't want to know what's happening
[21:28] to one around and see what the news is
[21:30] saying
[21:32] yes
[21:33] why can't they go and see when the field
[21:36] was open that thing was already spoken
[21:38] about amen when this word was become an
[21:42] open book to us all these things
[21:44] that are taking place on the Earth all
[21:46] these modern day events was already
[21:48] spoken of Amen amen when you see it now
[21:51] you must just know he's just been
[21:54] prophecy being fulfilled yes amen
[21:57] don't go and look the media as a
[21:59] prediction
[22:00] um
[22:01] huh
[22:03] you know that this Global recession
[22:06] that's coming upon the earth now
[22:09] it was all manipulated
[22:12] it has to be manipulated
[22:14] because they have to come out
[22:17] they all have to go into this new world
[22:19] order
[22:20] and they have to share their
[22:21] commonwealths come into one system then
[22:24] they can trade because
[22:26] in order for Satan we have full control
[22:28] people must be able to have one form of
[22:31] trading one form of Commerce
[22:34] that was the start of globalization
[22:37] and who will reach the globalization
[22:38] it's America because America is the
[22:41] mouthpiece for the Dragon
[22:51] says
[22:53] looking around at the nature of the
[22:55] people
[22:56] seeing that we're in the spirit of the
[22:59] last days
[23:00] they had to get in the spirit of the
[23:03] angeluvian world before they could be
[23:05] destroyed
[23:07] they have to be in a spirit of War
[23:09] before they can have War yes
[23:12] and what's influencing that it's through
[23:15] the media yes right
[23:16] you provoke you provoke the nation
[23:21] what's gonna happen is going to raise
[23:23] your wall um
[23:25] we know that before World War II started
[23:30] Italy went in the next Poland
[23:34] he didn't whether he had intention of
[23:36] way to the world wow
[23:37] two or not but the health relations are
[23:40] interfering it led to World War II
[23:45] we know that Putin went in the next this
[23:47] country maybe he never he didn't have an
[23:49] intention of War
[23:50] but as nations are moving in and gearing
[23:53] in
[23:54] Japanese and and giving sanctions you
[23:57] tell me this country you don't get
[23:58] provoked and one man man property would
[24:02] press one of his buttons
[24:04] yes that's right someone that has access
[24:06] to the atomic bombs it's going to take
[24:08] provocation
[24:11] he said they had to be in the spirit of
[24:14] War before they can have War
[24:17] and he said God let us be in the spirit
[24:19] of Christ tonight amen amen so we can
[24:22] have Christ amen let us be the spirit of
[24:25] repentance and spirit of faith
[24:27] give it to us tonight Our Father
[24:29] the great Treasures of life amen they so
[24:33] freely just by asking realizing that the
[24:36] greatest things of life and the only
[24:38] real lasting things are the Unseen
[24:44] but weekends we can see with our
[24:47] spiritual life amen
[24:49] the things that the world can't see that
[24:52] the angel of God is here amen
[24:55] amen fixing things around because why he
[25:00] didn't really come and show us how that
[25:01] we must live a good only Keen life yes
[25:04] he didn't come and just tell us that you
[25:06] need to to go to church every week and
[25:10] quote the prophet and things like that
[25:12] no
[25:12] you come to show us firstly
[25:15] that we are not of this world Amen
[25:19] we have another species yes we are free
[25:22] Supernatural race hallelujah amen we
[25:25] belong to a different gene pool
[25:28] our genetics are different amen
[25:31] our makeup is different yes and that is
[25:34] why when you got the baptism of the Holy
[25:36] Ghost you cannot adjust this age that
[25:39] you're living in yeah this age where the
[25:42] media has influenced the people to
[25:44] accept all this LGBT groups and so forth
[25:47] when they make it seem like it's part of
[25:50] life where they make it seem that it's
[25:52] part of your ordinary life it's not
[25:54] ordinary to the believer yeah
[25:56] these things are not normal these things
[25:59] are not in the natural cause of man
[26:00] because the Bible says they will lose
[26:02] their naturally fiction yes
[26:07] these are abnormal things because why
[26:10] those demons that lost their first
[26:12] estate are on the Earth right now
[26:15] influencing man and all those filthy
[26:18] Spirits upon people
[26:21] that is why you need to have your
[26:23] spiritual eyes open in this hour amen
[26:26] it's either you're influenced by
[26:28] prophecy or either you are influence
[26:31] through the media
[26:32] I'm just using the word medium you know
[26:34] it's a fourth dimension but I'm using
[26:36] the word media because that's what we
[26:37] understand
[26:39] and one of the most common forms of
[26:41] media is social media
[26:44] because even your mainstream news when
[26:46] you come down as a thread it goes
[26:47] through social media faster
[26:50] and it spreads like wildfire
[26:56] so they have to be in a spirit of War
[26:59] before they can have a wall
[27:01] and we can see right now
[27:03] everybody becoming the nations are
[27:06] coming into a spirit of War
[27:09] because why at first they started trying
[27:12] to have negotiation
[27:13] trying to have talks out you can step
[27:15] out of this wall but you can see slowly
[27:18] but slowly becoming more tense yes
[27:23] and Russia is getting provoked Biden is
[27:25] provoking
[27:27] you can see what's happening
[27:29] and slowly it will increase the pressure
[27:41] he said this modern event is slipping by
[27:43] us truthfully
[27:45] and one day we're going to find out
[27:47] we'll be left behind without nothing and
[27:50] be caught sealed into the mark of the
[27:52] beast before we know it so he's speaking
[27:54] at a time because why
[27:55] [Music]
[27:57] speaking to those that
[27:58] just to the public out there
[28:01] to those that wouldn't receive this
[28:02] message
[28:03] they're going to be left behind
[28:06] those that feel it is coming to a messy
[28:08] Church
[28:09] and not interested in getting the
[28:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not
[28:13] interested in coming to the real message
[28:15] itself yeah you have the message within
[28:17] them
[28:18] and becoming the manifested word in his
[28:20] hours
[28:21] they're going to be left behind you have
[28:24] to become the manifested word in this
[28:26] hour
[28:27] you can't come by this message by
[28:29] tradition yes amen you cannot come in
[28:31] this message because somebody your
[28:33] parents told you about it you've got to
[28:35] have your own experience amen
[28:40] it takes every boy and girl every man
[28:42] and woman to have their own personal
[28:44] experience
[28:46] you don't mean nothing to me if the
[28:48] prophet came and I heard just heard the
[28:50] prophet talking about his experiences
[28:52] and about meeting the pull of fire it
[28:54] don't mean nothing to me if I didn't
[28:56] feel that same pull from within me if I
[28:59] didn't have a deep calling Within Me
[29:01] amen everything that he's saying to me
[29:03] will just be like a story to me it'd be
[29:06] like someone relating a story but there
[29:08] had to be a deep within amen thank you
[29:11] there had to be something to respond to
[29:12] the call yes amen something to amen that
[29:15] word like to study right when he spoke
[29:18] that squirrel and just told him about
[29:20] the squirrel there was something when he
[29:21] died that could say amen amen thank you
[29:25] don't let the message become a story to
[29:27] you amen don't let his experience about
[29:29] beyond the curtain of time be just some
[29:33] incident that you're talking about it's
[29:35] a reality yeah he went to that Dimension
[29:37] he come to testify I believe what it is
[29:41] and what it's like there he saw the
[29:43] people there amen thank you amen thank
[29:46] you
[29:47] hmm
[29:48] thank you
[29:51] speaking about
[29:54] this influence about demoralizing he
[29:57] said then if you notice he couldn't get
[29:59] in here through the ministry so the
[30:01] thing he done was come into early
[30:03] without you
[30:05] he set up his headquarters over here in
[30:07] Hollywood
[30:08] the devil landed back here a few years
[30:10] ago
[30:11] 15 or 20 years ago with his great Army
[30:13] and ready to hit in Hollywood California
[30:17] and he had invaded in the United States
[30:19] with his demon powers sure
[30:22] well the United States had a role to
[30:25] play they had to be invaded
[30:28] because
[30:29] they had to be an influence they come
[30:31] from there because United States had to
[30:33] be part of this prophecy amen
[30:38] right all of our Fashions come from
[30:41] Paris they get into Hollywood under the
[30:43] screens these little girls the little
[30:45] boys that think get out here they watch
[30:47] them stream please
[30:49] so he's talking about their time
[30:52] how it starts today our men will be
[30:54] influenced
[30:56] and we can see now a man is so influent
[30:58] that they will not listen to you telling
[31:00] them if you can generate let me show you
[31:03] what the prophet said that's going to be
[31:05] boring to them
[31:06] they would rather listen to what was on
[31:10] media
[31:12] it's more exciting for them
[31:14] that will have more of an influence to
[31:16] them
[31:19] but what the devil don't realize that
[31:22] he's using that same fourth dimension to
[31:24] influence people
[31:26] God can use that same dimension amen
[31:30] to influence people as well
[31:32] because in that same media
[31:35] or the same for
[31:37] same devices that captured the pull of
[31:40] fire same devices that capture the
[31:42] clouds yes
[31:46] yes amen
[31:48] and
[31:49] when we leave the earth when Moses and
[31:51] Elijah is on the scene the same media is
[31:53] in the captured and lying in the city
[31:55] amen and now they're raising up amen
[32:00] so in the same media is going to play in
[32:03] the day of judgment
[32:04] the same media that we're influenced by
[32:07] then he wouldn't believe what you are
[32:08] saying yes you wouldn't believe what the
[32:10] message of the hour says for this day
[32:12] yes he's gonna play on the day of
[32:14] judgment amen such and such a thing you
[32:17] love this media so much now watch it
[32:19] yeah but such a such a day this brother
[32:22] came and told you he warned you about
[32:25] the oncoming storms of judgments
[32:28] warned you about what is happening if
[32:30] you don't believe the word of God for
[32:32] your day if you don't believe this
[32:34] prophet's message for your day you're
[32:36] going to be left behind
[32:39] amen play for them yes
[32:43] the very media that they love so much
[32:45] and they will take it rather than what
[32:47] you tell them
[32:53] now we know under that the trumpets you
[32:55] know what he's trying to prevail
[32:57] we know we have to get you know through
[32:59] the trumpet the Jews got back in the
[33:00] Homeland
[33:02] because Jews have been part to play amen

[33:15] worldwide to push it even further
[33:18] worldwide three were pushed out of cater
[33:20] amen
[33:24] and that's what the wars was bringing
[33:25] he's trying to bring the bird paints and
[33:28] the example of purifying the Earth
[33:30] and we know World War III will ushering
[33:32] to the millennium
[33:35] the very Earth that man destroyed God
[33:38] said he'll destroy those that destroyed
[33:40] the Earth amen
[33:42] they pollution the Earth
[33:44] they're destroying creation with the
[33:47] scientific
[33:49] experiments and so forth with all the
[33:52] chemicals that they're using they put
[33:54] these gases into the air and he causes
[33:55] cancer and so forth
[33:58] destroys the environment around them
[34:00] that's why the second time you'll find
[34:02] birds are dying just fishes are dying
[34:05] from the water because the water has
[34:07] become become contaminated it's polluted
[34:10] with all the chemicals a mess
[34:13] destroying the marine life
[34:16] destroying the life on the Earth
[34:18] agricultural life
[34:20] all the life that you got is being
[34:22] destroyed because of man and his greed
[34:26] to advance in science
[34:29] because of his grief
[34:33] are we living in the time of a man has
[34:35] taken agriculture out and he's put
[34:37] buildings buildings buildings remove all
[34:40] the forestry destroying the Earth and
[34:43] now he doesn't have he can't make enough

[34:49] process food yeah
[34:51] going to food to to to use things
[34:55] scientifically producers
[34:58] to create for the methods but what he
[35:00] doesn't really is killing himself again
[35:03] how long can we carry on this Earth
[35:09] are we building our futures here knowing
[35:11] that God is going to destroy this us
[35:14] we should be shaping ourselves and
[35:16] getting ourselves into a condition
[35:20] then we'll get out into the Rapture amen
[35:22] amen we should be shaping ourselves to
[35:24] become sensitized to the word of God
[35:27] Amen Richard becomes sensitive train out
[35:31] here to be sensitive to the leading of
[35:33] the holy spirit amen amen that every
[35:36] move we make in our life whether it's in

[35:41] matter where we are become sensitive to
[35:43] the leading of the spirit amen train
[35:46] your ear to spiritual things

[35:54] people you'll be influenced by the way
[35:56] they speak yeah
[35:58] you know your language
[36:00] and your the way you you pronounce your
[36:02] words you can be influenced if you spend
[36:04] a long time with people right I know
[36:07] when I I used to live
[36:10] without schooling a lot of people speak
[36:13] slightness and you know you live in
[36:15] Phoenix a lot of things so when you're
[36:17] around them too much you end up speaking
[36:19] slimes yes you don't realize it you
[36:21] unconsciously
[36:23] speak those slang
[36:28] and he happens in our work environment
[36:29] you know you get used to you just pick
[36:32] up a slang you don't realize it but
[36:35] but if you want to learn spiritual term
[36:37] spend more time with the word amen then
[36:41] you will understand spiritual
[36:42] terminology
[36:43] let the word like Seven Seals jump with
[36:46] all these things become your terminology
[36:47] yes
[36:50] let them become yours let them be
[36:52] something that you will always want to
[36:54] say amen amen practice it yes amen
[36:59] and what you confess
[37:02] because there's power in your confession
[37:04] confess that you are a son of God Amen
[37:06] confess that you are born again he
[37:09] confess that you are part you are you
[37:11] you are you are part of the inheritance
[37:13] of God yes amen you're part of the
[37:15] economy of God Amen you are rightful he
[37:18] is to that inheritance amen
[37:21] confess that every promise in the book
[37:23] belongs to you yes amen
[37:26] that must be your influence tonight this
[37:29] morning amen
[37:30] be influenced by the word of God
[37:33] being fluent that you are told in this
[37:36] hour that you have become the manifested
[37:38] word in this hour
[37:39] you are to be the one that must go and
[37:41] prophesy again the nation to turn to
[37:43] King
[37:45] don't leave for another day believe that
[37:47] if this is part of your prophecy amen
[37:49] yes
[37:50] and keep exercising that word and as you
[37:54] exercise that word before you know it
[37:55] you have to workplace somebody is
[37:56] talking then you're telling them about
[37:58] God Amen then you're telling them about
[38:00] modern day events yes amen they're
[38:02] telling you about the media they're
[38:04] giving you the perception that they
[38:05] believe through the media
[38:07] then you tell them but to properly
[38:10] who is that now you are becoming the
[38:12] final voice amen you're echoing that
[38:16] say man
[38:18] that you see the bus
[38:21] everyone said look at his bomb look at
[38:24] what Russia did now the killing
[38:25] civilians they're getting one side of
[38:27] the story
[38:28] then go and tell him
[38:30] how was how these things how the media
[38:33] puts what they do in certain places
[38:37] it creates a perception
[38:39] it makes you believe a certain story
[38:41] that one day what they want you to
[38:42] believe
[38:46] because we know we are living in the
[38:47] living in the day that God promised to
[38:49] reveal the entire mystery
[38:53] not some mystery the entire mystery of
[38:56] the book
[38:58] he didn't show us what is required of us
[39:00] to live a pleasing life
[39:02] because that will just make us a normal
[39:03] fundamental Christian and God loves them
[39:05] he wants us to live a pleasing life
[39:08] but he shows all that he had in his
[39:11] hands shall I hide from Abraham what I'm
[39:13] about to do
[39:15] we are part of the royal seal of Abraham
[39:17] because why
[39:20] Abraham was justified through faith and
[39:23] we are part of that fake civilization
[39:26] and he showed Abraham all he's going to
[39:28] do in his heart he's showing us all that
[39:30] he wants to do he's not what he's
[39:32] showing us here he's showing us what's
[39:34] going to happen when we leave here how
[39:36] we will come and work with the Jews
[39:38] always bringing them back in the
[39:40] Homeland yes he's showing us how he's
[39:42] going to renovate the Earth amen he's
[39:43] showing us how we are going to a wedding
[39:45] supper how we are going to come and Rule
[39:48] and train yes
[39:51] all the way from the time man fell in
[39:54] the Garden of Eden
[39:56] right to where we are now right to the
[39:58] opening of the sea God has revealed all
[40:00] these things what a privileged people we
[40:02] are to be amen
[40:05] imagine you would owe nothing from us in
[40:08] this hour
[40:11] and then what did Abraham do next when
[40:14] God showed him the condition of Sorrow
[40:18] Abraham began to intercede
[40:21] you see what I'm getting at
[40:23] um
[40:26] if you are influenced by modern day
[40:27] events to prophecy
[40:31] then you should be recognize the
[40:33] seriousness of the hour that you're
[40:34] living in you're right amen
[40:36] don't be like the people of the whole
[40:38] thing yeah just just in one of those
[40:40] conflicts that will be resolved
[40:42] you know what they think
[40:44] they think the United Nations will
[40:46] resolve their problems
[40:48] we know that a proper tunnel does just
[40:50] say puppets yes the United Nations you
[40:53] know what the United Nations come to an
[40:54] age countries we had them the other day
[40:56] yeah but in Durban
[40:58] I think everyone is afraid you know like
[40:59] everyone like given that respect that
[41:01] all of them
[41:04] they owe them at the highest team but
[41:06] they're just couples
[41:07] they can do nothing
[41:10] they expect the United Nations to bring
[41:12] sanctions and
[41:14] upon this Russia and with all the
[41:16] conflict why they don't realize
[41:19] the day when it land exploded
[41:23] and it was the first of September at
[41:25] that time
[41:28] and then I think he was on the 3rd of
[41:30] September
[41:31] they declared war
[41:33] Britain declared war Britain and France
[41:35] declared war on Germany
[41:38] it wasn't immediate it wasn't the same
[41:39] day
[41:42] so watch our things are unfolding now
[41:45] it might not be declared wise yet
[41:49] but behind the scenes
[41:52] what do you think they're doing why are
[41:54] they preparing the hair strikes and
[41:55] things
[41:56] preparing for what
[42:03] they don't realize they're not fighting
[42:05] with Germany who's lost the world
[42:07] this time
[42:09] prophecy has spoken yes
[42:13] God's word must come to pass amen amen
[42:16] this is not a prediction though this is
[42:19] prophecy human right
[42:21] so they you know you you go to people I
[42:24] understand every America is the hero in
[42:25] the united they feel little is strong
[42:27] NATO is led by America and everyone
[42:29] feels like strong
[42:31] but they don't realize that this nation
[42:32] has atomic bombs
[42:35] they don't have to even move the Army
[42:37] out there
[42:38] they don't need maybe they're losing in
[42:40] the troops but they don't need to use
[42:41] the truth the only reason uh Putin was
[42:44] using his troops that he didn't want to
[42:45] kill somebody
[42:48] if they go and use the bombs that they
[42:50] got they'll destroy the whole place but
[42:52] it wasn't the intention they wanted they
[42:54] wanted certain resources so nature would
[42:56] interfere with them
[43:03] so it's reaching a climax now
[43:06] and now we are one of those what are we
[43:08] doing
[43:10] we got a quick shot what to do
[43:14] because the hour is coming we must leave
[43:15] the Earth
[43:17] so we need to do what we need to do
[43:21] amen
[43:23] we know all these things are happening
[43:25] we know it's leading to World War III
[43:28] then we need to do what we're supposed
[43:30] to do amen amen Thomas prophesy again
[43:33] yes
[43:34] get the people ready
[43:37] try and win snatch somebody's Throne Out
[43:40] of Hell amen we don't have not
[43:42] everybody's meant to go in the Rapture
[43:43] but you can save the soul from hell
[43:47] because John saw a great multitude
[43:50] coming out of tribulation
[43:56] if you are really convinced
[44:00] because those that are full were the
[44:02] Holy Ghost
[44:03] cry and shy for the abomination of the
[44:06] Lost amen
[44:07] because this world
[44:09] back from each other he's not going to
[44:11] repent
[44:13] no the world is not going to reprint
[44:15] from the certain condition
[44:17] because that's what it said it would be
[44:21] and if they actually depend on God can't
[44:24] destroy the Earth
[44:26] and if it doesn't destroy the Earth then
[44:28] you have to
[44:29] go and say to Sodom and gomoro I
[44:32] shouldn't have destroyed you too
[44:35] he's a just God
[44:37] his judgments are just amen
[44:40] amen
[44:43] so we see all the nationally part of
[44:45] Prophecy we see all the the the parts
[44:48] they play
[44:53] foreign
[44:58] times
[45:00] if you look at the spiritual type or the
[45:02] natural type in Israel
[45:04] every time Israel went away from God
[45:06] what happened to them
[45:09] first time you ever can never came in
[45:12] next time after the time of day Maya and
[45:14] he is they came back again
[45:17] then they rejected the Messiah he was
[45:20] kept into all the nation of the Earth
[45:23] every time
[45:25] they turned away from God that's what
[45:27] happened yeah
[45:30] so he'll go into our personal lives
[45:33] you find a situation in your home
[45:36] go and re-evaluate your life yeah don't
[45:39] let the devil come and take you into
[45:42] captivity
[45:44] you will snatch you away so fast yeah
[45:47] yeah you'll influence your life because
[45:49] of the media and through this one
[45:52] dimension you influence your life and
[45:54] take away your faith and bring doubt yes
[45:56] amen
[45:59] he'll make you try and think like a
[46:02] natural man who thinks systematically
[46:04] think try to put something logically and
[46:07] logically explain something
[46:11] but if you open your mind and have a
[46:14] mind and allow the spirit of God to work
[46:16] in
[46:17] you might not be able to explain it in
[46:18] logical sense
[46:20] but with the wisdom of God you'll be
[46:22] able to see it from Genesis to
[46:25] Revelation because you'll see it light
[46:27] upon life amen precept upon precept yeah
[46:31] another word in that book a little in
[46:33] this book a little there is a little
[46:35] amen upon this preaching a little upon
[46:38] their preaching a little amen
[46:41] amen that's how the word of God is yes
[46:45] it's a mystery and you got to put it
[46:47] together amen
[46:50] it's not something for it's not
[46:52] something you just open there and you
[46:53] expect to just read it with logical sins
[46:55] you want to understand it is that the
[46:57] case you don't need a prophet you don't
[46:59] need the Holy Ghost you don't need a
[47:01] faithful Ministry
[47:02] God has put this thing
[47:05] this thing God has put his gifts in
[47:07] places so they can come and bring his
[47:10] word together to make you understand his
[47:12] great mystery to make you understand his
[47:15] plan
[47:16] and I and I need to understand why are

[47:22] so he sifted you out and now he's
[47:25] working with you
[47:26] amen because he's preparing you for
[47:29] because he's gonna destroy me showing
[47:30] you now through his word that he must
[47:32] destroy this Earth he's showing you
[47:35] again that when you are prepared people
[47:37] you're gonna come and live in his faith
[47:39] Civilization now The Lion and the lamb
[47:41] can't be together but when you come back
[47:43] that lion and lamb would fit together
[47:45] [Music]
[47:48] because of sin the world is what is it
[47:51] what it is today
[47:55] amen can you believe this this entire
[47:58] Bible
[47:59] was written by the Jewish Prophets
[48:02] [Music]
[48:03] and all these Mysteries were healed
[48:06] but he took a gentile prophet in this
[48:08] day
[48:09] amen come and reveal the mercies that
[48:12] was hidden in the Bible they were
[48:14] written by Jewish Prophets
[48:15] you take a gender Prophet come and
[48:17] reveal all these mercies that were
[48:19] written by Jewish prophets and telling
[48:21] you what's going to happen to the Jews
[48:22] yes and to us
[48:27] so then Happening by gender of profit
[48:29] and he'll take a gentile bride
[48:32] Amen to understand all these things that
[48:35] no one can understand in this hour amen
[48:37] you know take a gender but like how you
[48:39] had a major prophet and you had a minor
[48:41] prophet
[48:42] you have one proper that goes off the
[48:44] scene then you have someone like Micah
[48:45] come and Echo to the world of prophet
[48:47] now you have this Gentile property scene
[48:50] there must be a gender of right to go
[48:52] and prophesy again
[48:54] not another word but the same words
[48:57] of the prophets but to make sense to it
[49:00] to place it in modern context
[49:03] to place it in your modern times
[49:06] and showing you all the manipulating the
[49:08] money system
[49:10] you're wondering why you're looking at
[49:11] the news every day oh inflation rate is
[49:13] rising inflation ready that's all you're
[49:15] getting worried about don't get worried
[49:18] amen you shouldn't be getting worried
[49:20] because you knew that's going to happen
[49:21] yes yes you know that you will have to
[49:23] manipulate the money system
[49:27] and you know all the wealth of the world
[49:29] all the wealth of the world goes to the
[49:31] Vatican and the Jews don't know the
[49:34] paper and they know that eventually
[49:36] they'll have to bring the Jews in
[49:37] together
[49:42] but you don't worry about those things
[49:43] he said don't you take part of what food
[49:45] you've been amen what clothes you're
[49:47] gonna wear
[49:48] in that hour when these things happen
[49:50] watch the third pool then
[49:58] you can see they're applying sanctions
[50:00] now
[50:01] that's what they do extensions
[50:04] you remember Church you're living in the
[50:06] best day
[50:08] that you will ever live in
[50:11] you'll say how can this be the best day
[50:14] right now
[50:16] because everybody waited for this hour
[50:17] yes
[50:19] until Jesus come it shall gradually
[50:23] not gradually say but rapidly get worse
[50:26] and worse yes and how long will it take
[50:30] this amen from this very poor but how
[50:32] long were you indigenous we didn't say
[50:34] it will get better we didn't come pray
[50:36] God is gonna make everything okay
[50:39] God is going to turn the situation
[50:41] around did we say that
[50:43] he said it's going to get worse amen and
[50:45] worse
[50:46] and what they did they call us prophets
[50:47] of Doom
[50:49] are we just telling you what the prophet
[50:50] is saying that's right because we must
[50:52] prophesy again amen
[50:55] he said when Russia goes down there to
[50:57] get that oil look out
[50:59] then all she needs yeah
[51:02] that's how the applied sanctions are
[51:03] going to go take away your resources
[51:05] your oil Integra but she needs that oil
[51:09] then what the prophet said he would do
[51:11] ready for it then
[51:15] but at the end time you know that
[51:17] there's an atomic bomb hanging out
[51:19] yonder in Russia with their names on it
[51:21] Jamaica because he came to a stage where
[51:24] he couldn't pray for him anymore he said
[51:26] America is doomed yeah
[51:29] right here in sex cartoon and you know
[51:32] that so that's the real rest of the
[51:34] world know it there'll be
[51:36] in the nation one of these days you know
[51:39] it's not far off
[51:40] it's just the end of a God holding it
[51:44] what's going to happen what did our
[51:47] presence say to the other night we want
[51:49] to keep strong let our aggressor know
[51:51] that whenever he drops a bomb is going
[51:53] to destroy himself too sure
[51:55] planes and great chains and great lines
[51:57] without gender with guns string right on
[52:00] the whole world every thing that person
[52:02] when he's influenced by that spirit
[52:03] because he's a truly man of God he's not
[52:05] what he wants that happened to him
[52:08] he's not interested in that
[52:15] amen
[52:17] so God is giving us braces our amen amen
[52:28] he said now remember
[52:30] they'll never be impersonation of that
[52:34] so he says and and that is the thing
[52:36] that we have looked for so long
[52:41] that's why I said this is the best day
[52:43] and you'll see why not for at least many
[52:46] years four or five years or maybe Long
[52:48] Island third pool has no now will be
[52:50] Vindicated and I'm sure you all know
[52:52] what it is
[52:53] now remember they'll never be in
[52:56] personation of that
[52:58] because it can be
[52:59] it cannot be now it's in existence
[53:04] and I am warned of this that soon all
[53:07] right it is time now it just happened so
[53:10] it could identify its presence among you
[53:13] but it will not be used in a great way
[53:15] until the council begins to tighten up
[53:21] and when he does
[53:23] now how did it influence the people to
[53:25] come again to you this very word through
[53:28] the media
[53:29] they will create that perception amongst
[53:31] the people amen
[53:38] the media can kill an influence of
[53:41] something the media can cause somebody
[53:43] so badly
[53:45] you can you can come and destroy
[53:48] somebody so badly
[53:50] the Pentecostal and so forth can almost
[53:52] impersonate it anything can be done
[53:54] but when the time comes when a squeeze
[53:56] comes down then you'll see what you see
[54:00] in temporarily being manifested in the
[54:02] fullness of its power
[54:09] amen
[54:11] so what is God doing now he's training
[54:13] us for Supernatural things yes amen
[54:16] he's training a supernatural race
[54:19] he took us all along this journey amen
[54:21] from the time becoming a message from
[54:23] the time we get cleaned up out of Egypt
[54:26] take the whole of Egypt out of us take
[54:29] out all the legacy of spirits amen and
[54:32] takes out of that spiritual amnesia
[54:35] because it was that word that comes to
[54:37] awaken us yes now the seven Thunders
[54:40] come to awaken us
[54:41] from that spiritual sleep that we was in
[54:44] amen
[54:46] that now you in the message knows that
[54:50] you can't call
[54:51] one of those denomination churches
[54:54] because you know they are Christians to
[54:56] you
[54:57] that's just religion to you it's
[55:00] because Christian is Christ's life some
[55:03] other will keep Christ's word amen
[55:06] so God is training us amen all is just
[55:10] been treating us with Supernatural
[55:11] things
[55:16] has been Supernatural yes even your very
[55:20] the very way you receive this message
[55:22] was Supernatural yes that's right
[55:25] and that's why if you want to see me
[55:26] supernaturally nobody can take it away
[55:28] amen and we've come now into the program
[55:31] of God
[55:33] we're becoming tune to God
[55:36] so much so that no matter what we see we
[55:39] can see through the eyes of God's word
[55:40] amen
[55:42] that is why you can't be deceived in
[55:43] this house right amen he said
[55:46] he will cut these shorts but for the
[55:49] elixir
[55:50] sorry for the electric you cut it short
[55:52] because everyone else will see but they
[55:54] just they elect will not be this
[56:00] so God is keeping us in his program so
[56:03] we won't be out of land of his word amen
[56:06] because he saw it in a vision he said
[56:08] stay in line stay in line
[56:10] what's keeping them in line it's a fight
[56:12] foreign
[56:14] keep them in line that's why you find
[56:16] those that wouldn't come under a
[56:18] fightful Ministry they fall they find
[56:20] themselves in a taxable condition but
[56:23] they wouldn't recognize it because
[56:24] they're not under five four minutes amen
[56:26] because once you're out there you only
[56:28] see it
[56:30] and they become influenced by the by the
[56:33] world and but when you come under the
[56:35] faithful Mercy you come under a
[56:36] conviction
[56:37] you come under an Egypt amen
[56:41] and then you become under Authority when
[56:42] you subject yourself to Authority then
[56:45] you're under a protection you come out
[56:47] of authority the order of protection
[56:49] that's right
[56:51] and in scripture because even Paul said
[56:54] why would Paul make a statement if
[56:55] somebody doesn't if a brother got a
[56:57] phone or a certain thing you want to
[56:59] speak to the brother doesn't take a
[57:01] witness he doesn't listen to that
[57:04] we now expelling more of the church it's
[57:06] communicating
[57:08] and you leave them into say to them
[57:10] because he knows when he's under the
[57:12] church he's under protection yes
[57:15] but you leave him there so Satan can
[57:17] deal with him yeah and then he can
[57:19] repent and come okay like The Prodigal
[57:21] Son
[57:23] right
[57:25] but
[57:26] why would Paul make just him he's trying
[57:28] to say that if you're under Authority
[57:31] and you subject yourself to it not just
[57:33] under Authority you subject yourself to
[57:35] Authority or under protection because
[57:38] The Authority that you under must be
[57:40] firstly a god-ordained Authority
[57:43] it must come under the message of the
[57:45] hour and it must be the 500 God has
[57:48] called amen
[57:50] amen and if God has called it then God
[57:52] must protect you amen you you come under
[57:54] the covering that'll be why he says if
[57:56] my brother be a fault pray for their
[57:58] brother amen lift him up for you too
[58:00] will be tempted amen
[58:04] and happy why you say if you're sick
[58:05] call the others of the church
[58:09] under the authority of the church
[58:13] so all these things putting you playing
[58:15] together
[58:17] all these modern day events are made
[58:19] known to us by prophecy amen the way we
[58:23] should live why we must do that why we
[58:25] come under the street civilization what
[58:28] God is planning to do to his Earth
[58:31] there must be disturbed worldwide
[58:34] but what the media has done
[58:38] desensitize the people he doesn't want
[58:40] to make the people who believed in the
[58:41] world
[58:42] maybe the people who believe that
[58:44] confidently can be resolved we can
[58:45] negotiate it out
[58:47] you can go laptops and solid out and
[58:50] they'll go back to normal
[58:51] what he said is going to get worse then
[58:53] worse and he said rapidly did we not see
[58:58] it from 2020 outing wrapping rapidly now
[59:04] so where we are now
[59:08] it's giving us rapturing Faith amen for
[59:10] his word amen
[59:13] because why he has to give us absolutely
[59:15] faith is about his world is going to
[59:17] burn up
[59:19] is going to purify it
[59:25] but we are happy amen
[59:27] we are looking up our Redemption is
[59:30] drawing by
[59:31] a man you're excited this morning amen
[59:34] you're excited that you are not being
[59:36] influenced
[59:38] to this fourth dimension amen
[59:41] to the influence of the media
[59:44] but you are being influenced by the word
[59:46] of God Amen you are being influenced to
[59:48] the spirit of Prophecy
[59:50] because you have become the prophetic
[59:52] voice in this prophetic age the final
[59:55] voice
[59:56] in this final age you must Echo again
[59:59] the work of the Prophet you must Echo
[1:00:02] these words of Prophecy again amen
[1:00:04] the world is in a certain condition
[1:00:07] and you must be able if you can't see
[1:00:09] that
[1:00:10] where the sound of conditions hidden
[1:00:12] right now
[1:00:13] we see them through the media in
[1:00:15] everything you see in the media is being
[1:00:17] influenced by the LGBT groups
[1:00:21] if you got spiritualized you'll be able
[1:00:22] to pick it up
[1:00:24] the entire media is being influenced by
[1:00:26] that you can't speak against them
[1:00:28] they've got more rights
[1:00:31] you've got no rights to tell them about
[1:00:34] the things that you believe in
[1:00:37] but they've got more rights than you
[1:00:40] he said
[1:00:42] TV programs oh female flesh and blood
[1:00:45] they are not Gods they're not goddess
[1:00:47] but it sets American Executive Order to
[1:00:50] fulfill the scripture America's number
[1:00:52] is 13 America's Shrine is a woman
[1:00:56] and you can see now the influence of
[1:00:58] women you've even given them holiday a
[1:01:00] woman's day a movement you see it in the
[1:01:02] workplace they have to employ more
[1:01:04] females
[1:01:05] they're males the employment Equity Act
[1:01:07] is there to suit the females
[1:01:09] and where it all started from America
[1:01:11] 's Shrine is a woman always it's our
[1:01:14] money it's on everything and now it
[1:01:17] certainly brings it to a time that we're
[1:01:20] going to have American goddess too not
[1:01:23] too far away you can see the handwriting
[1:01:25] on the wall oh what are we going to do
[1:01:29] you can't even walk out upon the street
[1:01:33] look out on the street start downtown
[1:01:35] and just see at the display of woman how
[1:01:38] that they make themselves with clothes
[1:01:40] on that
[1:01:43] honest to goodness
[1:01:45] a woman ought to be ashamed to stand in
[1:01:47] the dressing room like that walking out
[1:01:49] upon the street so tight a little bitty
[1:01:51] clothes
[1:01:52] and all these bathing beaches with his
[1:01:55] little thing whatever they call it and
[1:01:58] such things are dead and not knowing
[1:02:00] that in them is a spirit of evil
[1:02:03] with many of them singing employers
[1:02:05] that's what Jesus said will take place
[1:02:08] female flesh they are flesh and blood
[1:02:11] they are not Gods to my opinion God
[1:02:12] forgive me if I'm wrong it's the
[1:02:15] wholesale subtitles you cannot you blame
[1:02:18] a man if he's not a Christian but what
[1:02:21] would fall and fall into Temptations and
[1:02:23] to such a place that he would do
[1:02:25] something wrong till he could not hold
[1:02:27] himself it's amazing that there is not
[1:02:30] more ravages goes on because so many of
[1:02:33] it woman is in it
[1:02:34] but if it wasn't how could you blame the
[1:02:36] man
[1:02:37] put blame where blame belongs
[1:02:41] so a woman says the brother Brandon I'm
[1:02:43] just as moral as I no doubt about that
[1:02:46] but my sister do you know
[1:02:48] that you're going to answer the day of
[1:02:50] judgment for committing adultery when
[1:02:52] you throw yourself out there and men
[1:02:55] look upon you he said whosoever looking
[1:02:57] upon a woman to lust after has committed
[1:03:00] adultery when they are already in his
[1:03:02] heart and will have to answer for him
[1:03:05] now the way I'm getting it with this I
[1:03:08] want you to look at the spiritual
[1:03:10] the protests and churches have thrown
[1:03:13] themselves
[1:03:15] into such adulterous conditions
[1:03:18] in other words they they put themselves
[1:03:22] out there to go into the system
[1:03:27] that they could be ravished the mother
[1:03:29] called him back they could be ravished
[1:03:31] by the system and taken back
[1:03:34] because why they couldn't have virtue
[1:03:36] like this bride amen
[1:03:38] this Bride As a butcher she wouldn't
[1:03:40] just go out there she totally know what
[1:03:43] amen amen she had no words to quote
[1:03:45] herself she was naked
[1:03:47] rich and
[1:03:50] spiritually naked
[1:03:52] she wasn't stupid
[1:03:55] that's why he spoke about them the
[1:03:56] modern day many rock and roll Church
[1:04:00] but this bride has got virtuous amen
[1:04:02] this bride is clothed with the word yes
[1:04:05] yes this bride wouldn't just go and
[1:04:07] smile and show us seeds yeah
[1:04:09] foreign
[1:04:22] any man
[1:04:24] it's so easy for a woman to entertain
[1:04:25] men now laugh and joke at them
[1:04:28] you find a woman on the phone they're
[1:04:30] laughing and joking men
[1:04:31] but
[1:04:33] it just shouldn't be that way
[1:04:35] married woman should be loyal to the
[1:04:38] husband loyal woman should be fit
[1:04:40] married woman should be faithful to your
[1:04:41] husband amen foreign
[1:04:43] but that's the modern day you're living
[1:04:45] in
[1:04:47] you know as you would
[1:04:49] I don't definitely I don't deal with
[1:04:52] divorce cases but we help people when
[1:04:54] they
[1:04:55] especially we're getting traditions
[1:04:57] where you find the woman has committed
[1:04:59] adultery and relieving the man so that
[1:05:02] God want to take everything from the man
[1:05:03] so we just help them in case we had to
[1:05:05] do settlements
[1:05:06] so you see the condition of how these
[1:05:09] things take place so we know
[1:05:11] a woman entertainment
[1:05:15] now the devil does the same two sons of
[1:05:18] God today that's right watch our
[1:05:20] businesses most of our business is
[1:05:22] controlled by women lots of them that's
[1:05:24] right look at our churches look at our
[1:05:26] nation how the sons of God bow lowered
[1:05:28] the shine of these things these women
[1:05:30] when they are to me it's no more than
[1:05:32] public holidays
[1:05:34] that's an awful thing to say but it's
[1:05:36] the naked Church
[1:05:38] I know that people hear these children
[1:05:40] things will say these things but how can
[1:05:42] you do it if you present yourself like
[1:05:44] that and man look upon you as Jesus said
[1:05:47] you have committed the Lord
[1:05:50] so we see the size of the time
[1:05:53] if we see all these things that it's so
[1:05:55] relevant to now
[1:05:57] the work condition we are to put
[1:05:59] ourselves in amen
[1:06:01] we are to put ourselves in a rapturing
[1:06:02] condition because the only thing left
[1:06:04] now
[1:06:05] is for him to come and take away right
[1:06:09] amen we should be fulfilling our part of
[1:06:12] the scripture
[1:06:13] and at any time it should be now
[1:06:16] fulfill our part of the world Amen and
[1:06:18] get ourselves in that direction again
[1:06:20] get sensitized to the spirit while the
[1:06:23] world is desensitized to the media
[1:06:26] we should be sensitized and sensitive to
[1:06:29] the still Small Voice to the meaning of
[1:06:31] the spirit in all aspects of our life
[1:06:33] amen God needs to bless you understand
[1:06:37] [Applause]
[1:06:56] [Music]
[1:07:01] so there will be three consecutive
[1:07:02] services
[1:07:12] amen you believe that God Can Make A Way
[1:07:15] in our lives
[1:07:16] even when it seems to be no way amen
[1:07:19] and you believe that the grace of God is
[1:07:21] still out there yeah the fact that his
[1:07:23] word is being preached
[1:07:24] the fact that it reveals that things
[1:07:28] he still could pray
[1:07:30] he could still could claim his family
[1:07:35] we still could intercede on the Bell
[1:07:37] from his family we can still do the same
[1:07:39] thing don't you know you could be saved
[1:07:41] for the time as this
[1:07:43] Madagascar
[1:07:45] be there to intercede and be awful for
[1:07:47] people
[1:07:48] put in the palace for a time like that
[1:07:52] okay but she didn't go haphazardly and
[1:07:55] intercede but he registered to eat the
[1:07:58] seat she had to fast and pray she had to
[1:08:01] consecrate herself and she had to wear
[1:08:03] on the Royal parallel

[1:16:17] is timely and it's in season amen coming
[1:16:20] to remind us amen of the present hour of
[1:16:22] the present condition and the influences
[1:16:24] Upon Our Lives amen hallelujah and
[1:16:27] aren't you glad that we can feel to
[1:16:29] everything that's happening Through The
[1:16:30] Eyes of God's word amen all of these
[1:16:33] things were laid up and stored up for
[1:16:34] the bride to prepare us for this hour so
[1:16:37] that we will not be taken unawares yes
[1:16:39] can you imagine when the prophet was
[1:16:41] having seven major visions and when he
[1:16:43] was coming out that one Vision he had
[1:16:45] that voice screaming watch Russia watch
[1:16:48] Russia King of the North amen and here
[1:16:51] we are the old world is watching Russia
[1:16:53] right now amen amen you see Econo
[1:16:57] economies are crashing every day you
[1:17:00] look through Europe you look through the
[1:17:01] U.S inflation is skyrocketing they don't
[1:17:04] know what to do
[1:17:06] amen that's why they are fixing the
[1:17:08] prices in fact the true situation of the
[1:17:11] oil is is that they are pumping too much
[1:17:13] of oil
[1:17:14] so remember with this new green peace
[1:17:16] deal they need to get away from oil
[1:17:20] and all of these things so Saudi Arabia
[1:17:22] and them were pumping too much of oil so
[1:17:25] they decided to pump lesser oil
[1:17:27] and increase the price of their oil
[1:17:29] that's what the current conflict is
[1:17:31] about in the US is not happy about that
[1:17:33] because no you're still producing so
[1:17:34] much of oil and then nobody's using it
[1:17:37] we know there was a shortage of cooking
[1:17:39] oil
[1:17:40] if you go into your shops now see the
[1:17:41] prices are coming down
[1:17:43] so if the prices are coming down which
[1:17:45] means the oil is being increased amen
[1:17:47] the supply of it so you find amen after
[1:17:49] covet everything shifted they realized
[1:17:52] they needed a a control over this world
[1:17:54] systems so you'll find economies
[1:17:56] crashing the prophet says they will
[1:17:58] eventually crash that dollar
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] Hallelujah whoever all those bonds has
[1:18:04] control over America
[1:18:06] because they own America amen so we find
[1:18:09] scripture you find the seals becoming
[1:18:11] alive if amen if you want to go through
[1:18:13] those seals again the seals are coming
[1:18:14] alive again amen we can see the prophecy
[1:18:18] through that amen and the Seven Seals
[1:18:21] were given to us you know no other
[1:18:22] Church world no other church beside the
[1:18:24] message church has the revelation of the
[1:18:26] Seven Seals that's what was given to us
[1:18:29] when that Mighty angel came down amen
[1:18:32] amen so we should never forget those
[1:18:35] seals and the what the impact of it is
[1:18:37] to us we see amen six trumpets had to
[1:18:40] blow
[1:18:41] to get the Jews back to the Homeland
[1:18:43] right right you know they're not going
[1:18:45] to get what they want what are they
[1:18:46] crying for you'll hear the year
[1:18:50] 5783 I think it is according to their
[1:18:53] calendar they are wanting to see Messiah
[1:18:55] I don't know if you know they won't see
[1:18:57] Messiah
[1:18:58] what they're going to see next
[1:19:00] two prophets come to them
[1:19:02] the expectation is not realistic and one
[1:19:06] of the true prophet's going to tell them
[1:19:07] you missed him back there he already
[1:19:10] came
[1:19:11] and then he's going to tell but there's
[1:19:12] been two thousand years of church
[1:19:14] history that's what they're going to
[1:19:16] preach to these Jews there's been two
[1:19:18] thousand years seven churches have come
[1:19:20] up and in fact there was a group of
[1:19:22] people just now amen amen all seven
[1:19:25] Church ages they've been raptured to
[1:19:27] Glory
[1:19:29] amen and that's what the day that Feast
[1:19:32] of atonement is about the trumpets amen
[1:19:34] the Tabernacles amen and you finally
[1:19:37] just went to the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:19:39] now
[1:19:39] all through each all through Israel they
[1:19:41] set up these little boots trying to
[1:19:44] recreate that Feast amen and just the
[1:19:48] other day I was watching they're trying
[1:19:49] to now slowly take vessels put water and
[1:19:53] they gathered in the lines
[1:19:54] of Israel and they're trying to perform
[1:19:57] certain rituals back again amen the
[1:20:00] things that they used to carry out
[1:20:01] you'll see they live with their trumpets
[1:20:03] you'll see them there filling the
[1:20:05] vessels with water
[1:20:07] so what are they doing what am I trying
[1:20:08] to tell you they are preparing
[1:20:10] they're getting ready because they can
[1:20:12] sense the hour and I want you to know
[1:20:15] that the bride will not be taken
[1:20:16] underwears God is fixing this bride God
[1:20:19] is preparing this bride she'll be the
[1:20:22] most prepared people in this hour
[1:20:23] because she has sent a word for this
[1:20:25] hour amen amen amen let's bow our heads
[1:20:29] amen sing one song is going to be
[1:20:30] dismissed amen God bless you amen
[1:20:34] Hallelujah I'm only in this message by
[1:20:37] grace
