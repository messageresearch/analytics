The revealed word of the hour. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet says, "What a resurrection that was &gt;&gt; and what a resurrection this is &gt;&gt; to be quickened to life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody knows about this resurrection of the bride of the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. The lovely wife of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; She's sinless. She's spotless. She's without blame. &gt;&gt; She's without wrinkles, without any spot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm talking about all of us. Amen. And our Lord Jesus Christ has done that when he rose triumphantly from the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know the blood speaks of better things. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated for a moment. Greet everyone in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to see everyone in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we get together like this. Amen. I was just thinking of the song. I love that thrill when I &gt;&gt; that I feel when I get together with &gt;&gt; God's wonderful people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And can you imagine what heaven's going to be like? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not only going to see one another, &gt;&gt; we're going to see the saints down through the ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. People that we read about in the Bible, the apostles, Amen. The Apostle Paul and all of these seven church age messengers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know they are unknown to the church world, but the prophetic eye of this prophet identified each church age messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the same way Joseph identified those uh brothers and he seated them according to Amen. the the years of birth, &gt;&gt; our prophet brought them all the way from Paul &gt;&gt; all the way up, Amen. to Wesley. &gt;&gt; And then identified himself in scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then he also prophesied about a super church and a super race and an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was us. &gt;&gt; So we are thankful. Amen. For this prophetic gift. If it had not been for the prophet, believe me, we wouldn't be gathered together like this. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will be gathered in our own denominations and in our own sex and our own way of doing things. Amen. But we have come under the revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So always good to see our pastor Tony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our pastor Mvin. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our pastor Leon here, &gt;&gt; our pastor Eshko. Amen. Let's give these wonderful men of God a hand. [applause] Praise the Lord. Amen. And we also want to express our appreciation to pastor MV for arranging for our pastor Moses to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. To minister for us at this time. &gt;&gt; And we know it's ordained of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It has to be because scripture can't fail. The Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered. &gt;&gt; Do you know what an order is? &gt;&gt; That's a military term. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. So be an expectation because the captain of the host is here. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he makes all things beautiful. Amen. So be an expectation. And you know whatever you are desiring for it's in an unseen realm. &gt;&gt; But faith can reach to that unseen realm and pull it into the seen realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it takes faith. &gt;&gt; Faith can do impossible things. &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever you're expecting the Lord for, Amen. Whatever you're believing the Lord for, believe that before you leave this place. &gt;&gt; In fact, believe right now, you have already received it. That the word is coming. I will water that by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, we have some apologies. Amen. From our dear pastor Rodney. Amen. Sister Pam wasn't too well. So, he couldn't make it for this uh service this evening. So, he asked to extend his apologies. And he also asked the church to remember Sister Pam in prayer, &gt;&gt; which we are going to do. Amen. So, amen. We won't waste too much of time. We know our pastor Moses is no stranger to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to get him a a visa or what? Permanent residency here in South Africa. &gt;&gt; So it'll be easy for him to just travel like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is his second home. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the first time I saw him, I told him, "Welcome to the land of the angel of the Lord." &gt;&gt; I told him it's important because the prophet was reprimanded and he was told, "Get to Devon. Get to Durban. He was in Johannesburg. He was in Bloom Fontaine. But the angel said, "Get to &gt;&gt; Dan." &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know when the prophet saw a 10 vision where he was looking? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said he was taken back to this land. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many you know, the prophet says it could be a little black boy that's the last seed. &gt;&gt; And he says this gospel must get back to Africa. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are perfectly on time. So your pastor, welcome. &gt;&gt; We're under great expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's no stranger to us. Also, thank you, Pastor Paul. Amen. For the songs. I mean, brother Paul, we were &gt;&gt; blessed with that singing. Amen. How many of you under expectation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So before we uh hand over the service, Amen. Let's just pray for our sister Pam. I believe there's enough faith in this room. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and that the hand of the Lord will be able to touch her and deliver her right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, we're going to just call our pastor Tony to bring this request before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want all of us to begin to join our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says just one of us can put a thousand to flightmen &gt;&gt; and two of us can send a legion flame. &gt;&gt; If two or more shall agree upon anything, &gt;&gt; shall be done. Amen. and our dear pastor Tony. Shall we pray church? &gt;&gt; Gracious God, eternal father, &gt;&gt; thank you father, &gt;&gt; we bow before your throne of grace, mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; your word says that whatever we shall say, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; we come tonight upon the authority of your word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, we speak as elected sons. [singing] We speak as adopted sons. &gt;&gt; We bring our dear sister before you in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Gracious God, we know that this is the season &gt;&gt; for your bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the season for this this anointed woman to speak. &gt;&gt; We speak strength into sister. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. Speak healing into sister. Father, I remember watching the video on Sunday when your servant went down and he laid hands on our sister and he prayed so passionately. Tonight, we are just joining hands in that prayer. &gt;&gt; We believe that God heard that prayer. We believe that God heard every other servant who ever prayed for Sister Bam because it's not the first time she's been prayed for. So, we are joining hands tonight with every other prayer. In the name of Jesus, we claim our healing because healing is the children's bread. And we know that children don't beg for pray. They take what has been provided by father. So tonight, we are accepting our healing because it's been provided in the name of Jesus. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's stand as we receive our dear pastor. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's sing. I'm only in this message by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I'm only [singing and music] in this message by grace. [music] [singing] It [music] is only by grace [singing and music] that I [music] know [singing] I know what I'm [music] [music and singing] in the blessing. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I need &gt;&gt; one more time. Let's sing it. I'm only in the [singing] message. [music] blessing [singing] my praise. [music] He is [singing] only my [music] praise that I need. [music] I don't know [music] how I chose [singing] [music] any [singing] way I [music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; greet you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Lord, &gt;&gt; how many men are happy with me? &gt;&gt; I'm happy to see my friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Familiar faces. &gt;&gt; So, we want to appreciate Pastor Adrian. So I did not think that I'll come back again &gt;&gt; before pastor Adrian comes with him &gt;&gt; because as human beings I had arranged for pastor Adrian to come end of October. &gt;&gt; So I spoke to the church. I also spoke to some pastors because my intention was to revenge. So I had lined up many sermons, many churches. So then it did not work out. &gt;&gt; Not that there was politics or what. But at work, he could not be granted leave. But everything was. But I said, "No, you are still not off the hook. We will try next year." Amen. So because I was there when pastor Adrian preached at East Taberno the church of former of pastor chaser. So it was such a blessing. &gt;&gt; So you people you are so privileged. &gt;&gt; Is it you brother Luke? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you people you are so privileged to have a pastor like pastor Adrian. &gt;&gt; Such a gifted man of God. Wonderful spirit. And this time it was pastor me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who brought me here because I had come to for the funeral of pastor. &gt;&gt; So then pastor me hallelujah organized for me to be down here. So may God brother may God bless pastor me. How many love pastor me? &gt;&gt; He's a kind gentleman. [applause] Hallelujah. He's a straightforward person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He does not indicate right and turn left. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He means what he says and he says what he means. &gt;&gt; And I'm happy to see Pastor Tony. Thank you for the prayer. Pastor Tony is also a bosome friend of mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I also saw Pastor Eshko. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Pastor Eshko. &gt;&gt; And if I leave out some pastors, oh my friend, brother Adrian, are you there? He's also a friend. Hallelujah. So, without wasting much time, h let's read 2 Corinthians chapter 2. I'll try not to be long. &gt;&gt; Is it still okay? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I think Are we hearing one another? &gt;&gt; Yes. So we can still continue before we sit down. 2 Corinthians chapter 2. 2 Corinthians chapter 2. 2 Corinthians chapter 2. God bless you Pastor Tony verse 11. Let's just read verse 11. I also see the sister elder sister for pastor Ho. When I came for the first time from the airport, I went to brother Esho's house and she was there &gt;&gt; and she really took care took care of me. May God bless you my sister. So second 2 Corinthians 2:1 the Bible says lest Satan should get in advantage of us &gt;&gt; for we are not ignorant of his devices. &gt;&gt; How many appreciate that? &gt;&gt; Can I read it again? &gt;&gt; Amen. Lest Satan should get an advantage of us &gt;&gt; for we are not ignorant of his devices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We may be seated. You know h I was battling uh of what to preach. Pastor me, I did not know, you know, it's not easy to to come and stand before God's children. &gt;&gt; So, you want to make sure, Pastor Tony, that you are in the will of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Bible says, "A word spoken in due season, how good it is." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A word spoken in juices in brother how good it is. &gt;&gt; So brother Adrian that one who fellowships with pastor me my friend we met him yesterday. God bless you. So how many have prayed for me? &gt;&gt; My desire I always want to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So me coming here to preach to youh it does not mean that I know more than pastor Adrian. I know more than pastors in De say are we together we are just here for fellowship &gt;&gt; that's why I also want to invite some of you are we together to also come and preach for us &gt;&gt; because I am not a messenger we that you always come you want to preach alone no you know there are some pastors like that that they always just go and preach to others but they themselves they don't believe that someone can teach them. &gt;&gt; It's not the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; We are not ignorant of his devices. &gt;&gt; Even pastor me, I believe that he has got something that he can help me as well. &gt;&gt; So the Lord giving us grace. Even pastor Tony has got something that he can preach for us. &gt;&gt; Are we together friends? &gt;&gt; Because iron sharpened iron. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we you know brother Brhamam said when he used to preach he would preach one message. &gt;&gt; So brother Neville would preach one message and brother Brham would get inspiration &gt;&gt; for 10 message &gt;&gt; 10 messages out of one sermon that was preached by brother Neville. &gt;&gt; You remember when he spoke about the restoration to say to restore &gt;&gt; brotherham took it from brother Neville. So can you imagine a prophet, he would also sit down and hear other preachers preaching. Oh, &gt;&gt; that's the spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. So I just want to read a quotation here. I don't have many quotations. It's a familiar one where I'll get my my message in the exposition of the seven church edges. He says here, I think you can just pick it up. You know it. &gt;&gt; So when I say a quotation that you know, don't worry because Jesus used to say, "Verily, verily, I say unto you." &gt;&gt; So if I read this quotation and you know it, you must know it's the second. &gt;&gt; This what I'm reading is the second what? Because Jesus always said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor me, may God bless you. He says, "Now, Brother Brandham says right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire." I just put it. I just He says he fights that. &gt;&gt; So, the devil fights Revelation. &gt;&gt; So, that's what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; The devil has two books. &gt;&gt; The book of Genesis and the book of Revelation. &gt;&gt; Because the book of Genesis shows us how he began. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; His deception. &gt;&gt; And the book of Revelation shows us his end. &gt;&gt; How he's going to be thrown into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; So the devil hates two books. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we thank God because of revelation. &gt;&gt; Don't underestimate the power of revelation. &gt;&gt; Are we together, friends? In as much as we can pray, in as much as we can fast, but we defeat the devil by revelation. &gt;&gt; If you don't know who you are, the devil take advantage. &gt;&gt; If you don't know the devil's devices, &gt;&gt; you will be defeated. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW how the devil operates. &gt;&gt; So I'll be preaching on those lines. &gt;&gt; How many can say brother Andrew? So, brother Brandham says, "Brother Luke, we must know, &gt;&gt; are we together? How the devil operates &gt;&gt; in the message, [clears throat] you know, contest." &gt;&gt; He says, "You must know whether he uses the right hand or the left hand." &gt;&gt; Otherwise, if you don't know how the devil operates, you will be in trouble. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Esho, do you see? We must know in the contest because you cannot go into war &gt;&gt; without studying the Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor, YOU MUST STUDY WHAT? YOUR enemy &gt;&gt; and you know how he maneuvers, how he does his things. So when you hear Paul say we are not ignorant of his devices. So it means you must know &gt;&gt; the tactics of the devil. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul will come and say the devil &gt;&gt; is he has transformed himself &gt;&gt; as an angel of light. &gt;&gt; He is roaring like a lion. &gt;&gt; BUT HE IS NOT A LION. SO MY FRIENDS, in as much as we can fast, &gt;&gt; in as much as we can pray, are we together? And we don't know how the devil operates, are we together? We will always be on the losing side. &gt;&gt; That's why even people who play soccer, are we together? &gt;&gt; Before they go to a a soccer major, are we together? Like when South Africa is playing against Zimbabwe, &gt;&gt; the coach of South Africa will take the videos of the Zimbabwean players to see their strength, to see their weaknesses, to see the danger and they study them &gt;&gt; so that when they come now to play that they'll be knowing how many you can say to avoid whether the counter attacks or whatever they will study the enemy. So you you cannot just go into this great warfare without knowing the devil, &gt;&gt; without knowing how we attack. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when you know &gt;&gt; to be for to be forewarned is to be for armed. &gt;&gt; How many have seen that? &gt;&gt; We are in war. &gt;&gt; So today we want to see. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me read quickly. God bless you. And I feel here that you are a well taught church. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You know exactly what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he says here, let's go quickly. He says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is &gt;&gt; ah what she stands for and and she cannot do. It says what she stands for and that she can do the greater works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you need revelation to know that you can do the greater works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then he says she will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; How are we going to be an invincible army? &gt;&gt; The revelation of knowing who we are [laughter] &gt;&gt; and who the enemy is. And I want to tell you friends, do you see that the rider is only one rider? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He changed. He started on a white horse. &gt;&gt; From the white horse, he jumped to the red horse. From the red horse, he jumped to the black horse. &gt;&gt; Then the fourth stage, it was a pale horse. &gt;&gt; A mixture. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Of white, red, and black. And we know that when he was only what? on a white horse. The devil was using religious power. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? [laughter] &gt;&gt; The devil was using what? Religious power. &gt;&gt; Pastor me. And then he saw that people discovered him. Then he dumped into a red horse. &gt;&gt; He was now changing tactics. He was now using political power. He was now holding assault. &gt;&gt; BUT IS THE SAME DEVIL. &gt;&gt; Are we together? When the B the prophet tells us that when the enemy comes in like a flood, &gt;&gt; the spirit of God [laughter] raises a standard. &gt;&gt; So when the devil came on a white horse using religious power, &gt;&gt; God raised an anointing of a lion &gt;&gt; to combat religious power. &gt;&gt; And the DEVIL JUMPED AS WELL. ARE WE TOGETHER into the red horse? He was now using political power. God raised the standard in the form of an ox. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To combat political power. &gt;&gt; And when THE DEVIL WAS DEFEATED, HE CAME using a black horse for a penny. Are we together? How many remember that? &gt;&gt; And God raised a standard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IN THE FORM OF A MAN. YES. &gt;&gt; So this is these are the days now of Martin Luther when they interpreted the Bible. So they were defeated the devil by revelation &gt;&gt; by the word. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the devil saw that hey I'm being defeated. And then on that fourth stage now it was now a mixture. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; Of white, red and black. a mixture of religious power, political power and demon power. It was now dead. [laughter] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; And God raised a standard. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; IN THE FORM OF AN EGO, &gt;&gt; so you and me, we are under the ego anointing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And I want to tell you my friend, I used to think that the believers who were in years gone by in the days of of Job, in the days of the Old Testament, Abraham, Solomon, David, I used to think that, how many can say amen? &gt;&gt; They are so powerful &gt;&gt; than we. &gt;&gt; Brother, I used to think that David hear me. Don't take me for what I I say. Take me for what I mean. &gt;&gt; Do you know that this brother here is more powerful than Solomon? &gt;&gt; Can I tell you &gt;&gt; we are in the greatest battle that has ever been fought. &gt;&gt; WE IN THE GREATEST BATTLE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN you hear says HELL IS ON EARTH. IF WE go to hell right now, there's no demons because THE LID OF HELL HAS BEEN OPENED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Do you hear my brother &gt;&gt; and we ARE WE ARE FELLOWSHIPPING you know we are going to school with demons. We are working with demons. It's hell all over. &gt;&gt; Do you hear? &gt;&gt; Run for your life. &gt;&gt; Hell is on the &gt;&gt; How many believe that? So I want you to see why I said this brother is powerful. Amen. &gt;&gt; The believers of the of the days of of the white horse rider, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; They were contending with only religious power. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; But pastor Maven and Pastor Adrian and me and Pastor Tony, we are now contending with all the demons &gt;&gt; that they fought in those ages. All the demons which were fighting Paul, the demons in the dark ages, they've all conglomerated, united &gt;&gt; to fight us. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Others were just fighting political power. &gt;&gt; In the days of the white horse, &gt;&gt; in the days of the black horse, they were just fighting demon power. But you and me, &gt;&gt; we are fighting religious power, political power AND DEMON POWER. &gt;&gt; SO God trusted brother Edin, trusted my friend here, trusted brother Luke to be in this age. &gt;&gt; Are you here? &gt;&gt; Listen, the best runners, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; they are put in the beginning and in the end. When people play when people running for the best runner is in the beginning and the RACE &gt;&gt; THOSE WHO ARE IN BETWEEN they are average. &gt;&gt; Why do they put the first runner in the beginning so that he can open the gap? HE CAN LEAVE THE COMPETITORS OPEN A big gap and then maybe the number two or number three when they slow down a little bit and the enemy catches up the last one &gt;&gt; we take the patterns there &gt;&gt; and finish them touch &gt;&gt; so we now &gt;&gt; but it's not easy &gt;&gt; to be a minister &gt;&gt; in the bride age and in the last age &gt;&gt; where there is A MIXTURE OF POLITICAL POWER, DEMON POWER. HOW MANY CAN SAY &gt;&gt; AMEN? &gt;&gt; AND RELIGIOUS POWER. &gt;&gt; It's not easy. &gt;&gt; So God said whom can I send &gt;&gt; in the last chapter. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; And God said pastor let him go and preach. &gt;&gt; God trusted you. &gt;&gt; Father, do you know that even women? How many can say amen? In the days of brother Brham, he said, "Hey, the flashing red lights of the son of his coming." He says, "Do you know that the beauty of women, it's a sign?" How many can say it's a flashing red light of his coming? &gt;&gt; So, brother days, he was saying the the Miss America of today. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; how many you can't compare with the Miss America of long day? &gt;&gt; So, what about now? Amen. &gt;&gt; When you see the beauty of women and God trusted you brother to [clears throat] stay in this age [laughter] &gt;&gt; where you can't hardly find an ugly woman and God says go stay there go worship there. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Solomon &gt;&gt; who had 1,000 wives? &gt;&gt; If Solomon had an iPhone with internet, he was going to fall. God did not but God trusted brother but God trusted pastor Tony someone IS SAYING NO I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT CHEAP &gt;&gt; EVEN MYSELF I know TO PREACH HOW MANY CAN say amen in this end time in the greatest OF BATTLES SO IT MEANS GOD HAS TRUSTED you &gt;&gt; can someone say &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT CHEAP. &gt;&gt; EVEN you sisters, can I give you the quotation for that? Brother Brham says, "You sisters, you what sisters, do you realize that your daughters are receiving 10 times temptations &gt;&gt; than you were?" Can you imagine you mothers? &gt;&gt; Hey, with all the internet, with all these things. So our daughters of today, my brother, they are facing a lot than what you mothers face. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, but it shows if you are a young man listening to me, you must thank God that God trusts you &gt;&gt; in this age &gt;&gt; with all the entertainment with all the world. God has brought you here &gt;&gt; because the best one is saved at the end. Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine David who fell with Ba if he stayed and lived in in Phoenix? Uhhuh. My brother. [laughter] My brother. Yes. I'm unapologetic. I mean what I say. How many can say amen? I want to show you that the best one is saved at the end. And the devil is so vicious in this end time. &gt;&gt; He knows HIS TIME IS UP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S NOT EASY. We are LIVING IN A TERRIBLE hour &gt;&gt; where we need the word of God &gt;&gt; to stabilize us. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD IS OUR DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; Can someone say hallelujah? &gt;&gt; SO WE MUST KNOW the tactics of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor, how many are enjoying that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you seen that &gt;&gt; pastor Adrian is powerful? &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm being honest &gt;&gt; that the pastor's gone by in ages gone by cuz what we are facing, what pastor me is facing is too much &gt;&gt; compared to the pastors gone by in the dark ages and things. So when you see Malachi 4, he was so powerful. God trusted him to STAY TO COME AND PREACH in the Laudian church age &gt;&gt; where IT WAS SO EVIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Ah my brothers &gt;&gt; I did not go I did not want to go into that but it's in line with what we are saying. How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So how many are going to read the word? &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us that you are as strong as the amount of word that is in you. You are as strong as the amount of word that is in you. &gt;&gt; So you must eat the book. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Someone you know was sick. Someone was sick. They took him to many doctors &gt;&gt; and then they could not diagnose what was the problem. Then they took him to an old experienced veteran. Can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; The veteran just asked him one question. in this talk says my friend when last did you eat a real meal? &gt;&gt; He said 3 days ago that doctor said you are not sick you are just hungry. [laughter] Doctor said okay do you have a wife? Says yes. Says let him go let her cook for you a real biryani a real nice one or you can just take a bunny a big one and eat it. You'll be okay. And then when he took the bunny he was okay. He was up and about. So but he had symptoms you know of being sick but he was not sick brother he was. So when you see brothers and sisters in [laughter] the message with symptoms of missing service being by small demons and how many can say amen just ask them when when did you last did you really pray &gt;&gt; pastors hear me pastor when you see brothers and sisters in the church which are so problematic. Just ask them when last did you eat a real meal? &gt;&gt; When last did you listen to the tape? When last did you read the Bible? WHEN LAST DID YOU REALLY FAST? HOW MANY SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; So if you are like that, I'm giving you the prescription. You are not sick. Go eat. &gt;&gt; How many? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And people are not sick. How many tell your neighbor you are not seeking &gt;&gt; you are just hungry. &gt;&gt; How many say amen? &gt;&gt; You need spiritual food in [laughter] juices. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There were two dogs which were fighting. Two dogs were fighting. Are we together? The black one and the white one. &gt;&gt; And the the the black one was always being defeated. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; And then they asked why is it this one is winning the white one? They said, "Ah, it's always being fed. [clears throat] It's always fed. It's always eating." How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; So listen, someone asked brother Brandham, Pastor Ishko, he says, "Pen of God, what must I do so that I become spiritual? I want to be spiritual." Brother Brham said, "Read the Bible and pray every day." &gt;&gt; The ingredients. [cheering] If [applause] you want to be spiritual, read your Bible &gt;&gt; every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, you think uh a part-time Christian can defeat a full-time demon. &gt;&gt; Forget demons ARE FULLTIME. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY CAN say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say, Pastor Tony, a part-time Christian will never defeat a full-time demon. &gt;&gt; Demons are fulltime. Tell your neighbor and say you must be full time this morning &gt;&gt; in the way of God. &gt;&gt; You must be full time &gt;&gt; fasting &gt;&gt; reading. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are on internet utilize it when you're on YouTube to hear the word when you're on Facebook, WHEN YOU'RE IN TWITTER, USE ALL THE SOCIAL PLATFORMS. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; for the word. &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed? Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many are going to eat double? &gt;&gt; You need to eat &gt;&gt; so that you become strong. &gt;&gt; You develop spiritual muscles. &gt;&gt; You are as strong as the amount of word that is in you. &gt;&gt; Even Satan when he came to fight Jesus, Jesus did not use any of his gift. &gt;&gt; He said it is written. &gt;&gt; He used the water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I read quickly? Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Today I don't want corruption today. But how many are being blessed so far? &gt;&gt; You people are wonderful people. May God bless you. Amen. Listen, let's finish this quotation. So he says if they can get a true revelation of the two spirit, this is where this is my message now. He says if they can get a true revelation. Okay, let's start here. He says what she stands for and that she can do the greater works. Is that right? &gt;&gt; She will be an invincible army. Then he says if they can if they get a true revelation of the two spirits &gt;&gt; within the framework &gt;&gt; within the framework of the Christian church &gt;&gt; and by God's spirit &gt;&gt; design and withstand the antichrist spirit. So I just want to give a title, small one. &gt;&gt; Discerning the two spirits, &gt;&gt; working in the framework of the Christian church. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; That's so important. &gt;&gt; That's why the devil is doing as he please &gt;&gt; because we can't discern &gt;&gt; the two spirits that are working in the framework of the Christian [clears throat] church. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you friends that devil pastor me operates the way the devil operates. He operates by infiltration. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; The devil destroys us &gt;&gt; from within. That's why Paul says there are someh who have crept in among unaware &gt;&gt; to spy our labor. &gt;&gt; Then he says there are some I don't know how they were. They seemed somewhat to me. How many can say but they profited nothing. &gt;&gt; There are some people who seem somewhat. How many have seen such brothers &gt;&gt; that you know can I want to be honest today? You &gt;&gt; you are a child of God. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about you. &gt;&gt; We are talking about the devil. Do you hear sister? &gt;&gt; Paul says we must discern. &gt;&gt; The two spirits which are working in the framework of the Christian Christian church. &gt;&gt; Brother look. Are you ready for this? &gt;&gt; How many are ready for this quotation? &gt;&gt; Can I read this quote? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope I won't be stoned. How many can say amen &gt;&gt; in the message power of transformation. &gt;&gt; Hey Pastor Adrian, may God bless you. &gt;&gt; You know I was saying what must I preach? &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that the devil right now as I continue is done with the be is done with the soccer stadiums and rugby fields. is done with the brothel and cinemas and beer. &gt;&gt; If you are looking for the devil, &gt;&gt; don't go to the beer house. &gt;&gt; Don't go to the protest. Don't go to the nightclubs. &gt;&gt; The devil, &gt;&gt; he comes in church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you my friend, &gt;&gt; listen, &gt;&gt; the spirit will be so close &gt;&gt; that if it were possible, &gt;&gt; it will deceive the very elect. &gt;&gt; Can I say, brother Luke? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Me, can I shock you? &gt;&gt; It will take a pastor to deceive another pastor. &gt;&gt; It takes a prophet to deceive another prophet. &gt;&gt; It takes a sister to deceive another sister. It takes hallelujah &gt;&gt; a brother to deceive another brother. &gt;&gt; I cannot be deceived by bush. &gt;&gt; I cannot be deceived by Joshua. No, no, no, no. I can be deceived by someone who says he's in the message. &gt;&gt; Putting a pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; putting pillars of fires and everything and saying shalom, shalom. How many can say I'm being honest? BUT YET IT'S THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; DO YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? &gt;&gt; The devil is inside. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor and say it's not you, but it's being referred to. You are not the devil that I'm talking about. But you will see what I'm saying. Hey, brother. Can I be honest with you? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Most of my hardest times &gt;&gt; in the ministry, I say this so bad. I was not I did not receive it from drunkards. &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; My most terrible moment I received in religion, it was in the message &gt;&gt; brother. Do you hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the devil uses infiltration. &gt;&gt; He comes in the framework. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Sometimes I am more comfortable with Pentecostal pastors than message pastors because message pastors will finish you. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I thank God for pastor Adrian, Pastor Johnny. Do you do you know why I also come here? Because I know that they love me because there are others who want to finish me. &gt;&gt; So you must go where you are appreciated, not where you are tolerated. &gt;&gt; How many I'm being honest? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who killed? Who killed Jesus? &gt;&gt; It was not prostitute. &gt;&gt; Jesus was comfortable with prostitute. &gt;&gt; Those who killed him. It was pastors. It was religious people. &gt;&gt; You must have two spirits which are working in the [applause and cheering] framework. Do you think you are outside? NO. FORGET THE DEVIL IS INSIDE. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL COMES &gt;&gt; IN THE REVEALED WORD. &gt;&gt; WHERE THE REVEALED WORD IS, THAT'S WHERE THE DEVIL COMES &gt;&gt; IN THE FRAMEWORK. &gt;&gt; CAN SOMEONE say amen? &gt;&gt; Can I tell you the truth, the sons of God, they came, pastor me, to present themselves before the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the devil came right there. You think he was in the P &gt;&gt; right there? &gt;&gt; Can someone say &gt;&gt; where did sin start? &gt;&gt; Where did sin start? &gt;&gt; Sin did not start in the world or in the ship beings. Sin started in heaven. &gt;&gt; How many can say &gt;&gt; hallelujah? You see, but today I promise you, how many can say amen? I'm watching my time because I fear corruption. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; And if I quickly finish, I don't blame Pastor Adrian &gt;&gt; because Pastor Ed never told me time &gt;&gt; to say preach for 1 hour or what, I won't abuse that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you tell your preacher take your time, ah, you will see 11:00. Then shall we continue [laughter] but look so I don't want to abuse the lians &gt;&gt; don't worry we will still be gone but [clears throat] how many are enjoying &gt;&gt; how many are enjoying &gt;&gt; you will see what I want to say &gt;&gt; but brother is who had a wife with a birthday yeah yeah is that your wife &gt;&gt; yeah I remember when we came there bless you yes so listen pastor me in the message power of transformation. We are moving so well. I'm watching my time. How many are happy so far? &gt;&gt; How many mean you say a little bit? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You must mean what you say [laughter] and say what you mean pastor. Amen. But there's something which I want to say pastor me. Is it right now? And I want to tell you that the people that fights you, &gt;&gt; the people that wants to destroy you, it's people who are so close to you. &gt;&gt; How many can say it? You're going to see that principle. Maybe before I do this, can I read is h let's read h proverbs chapter 17. Just want to go quickly. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know pastor Adrian is a great teacher. is going to take this as well and expound it. So, God bless you, Pastor Adrian. I am so free here. &gt;&gt; So, it's Proverbs chapter uh 17 verse 17. Listen to this. The Bible says, "A friend &gt;&gt; loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity." &gt;&gt; Do you see my brother, my sister? A brother is born for &gt;&gt; who sold Joseph to Egypt. &gt;&gt; A brother is born for &gt;&gt; who killed Jesus. &gt;&gt; Was it prostitutes? &gt;&gt; Was it drunkards? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about discerning the two spirits working in the framework of the Christian church. Don't look at the devil &gt;&gt; outside. Wait, wait, wait, wait. He says here, when I go home, how many can say amen &gt;&gt; in the message, the power of transformation 65 10:31, this is where I took my inspiration. Pastor Maven, he says paragraph 136, I know he says this in many quotations. He says, "When I go home this time, I'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent." &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; the trail of &gt;&gt; it says the beast at the beginning. &gt;&gt; And the beast at the end. &gt;&gt; So you see that the beast was operating in the beginning and he says the beast in the end. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; He says and the beast at the end and he says and trail him &gt;&gt; right through the Bible. &gt;&gt; So this is where I got my inspiration to see we want to see how the devil operates. &gt;&gt; He says through the training through the [clears throat] Bible &gt;&gt; and show how he heads up. &gt;&gt; I mean do you see that? You must study your enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must study the devil. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the devil will have an advantage over you. You must know how. Listen, when you hear when we talk about the antichrist, &gt;&gt; if I can ask someone here, what is the antichrist? You know, you know, sometimes friends, I know it's good like to come and say, receive your desires, receive your car, receive fees, but once in a while, we must also teach these things. Amen. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; To to to establish us, &gt;&gt; pastor me. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; you will, you know, there are some people don't be like, you know, that paper fire. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; That when you light a paper fire, it can it can quickly light off. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; But sometimes we have to be grounded. &gt;&gt; Have you seen that the churches that are well taught, how many can say amen, they overcome the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are solid. &gt;&gt; There's no doctrine, false doctrine that can come. &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; But otherwise, sometimes people just jump up and down and what when strange strange doctrine comes, it takes them. &gt;&gt; But when you see people who are solid, people who are taught, how many can say amen? Brother Brandham says teaching establishes the believer and shows him his rightful position. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Says teaching &gt;&gt; goes beyond &gt;&gt; preaching. &gt;&gt; Brother, do you hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; THAT I CAN EVANGELIZE AND YOU CAN JUMP UP AND DOWN. But when pastor comes &gt;&gt; establishing you in the faith by the word I can see people are happy. Now listen I always say to my church &gt;&gt; many people when you say receive your house receive your car receive your healing people jump and reach the ceiling. &gt;&gt; Do you hear? But when you come now and say the seventh seal brings him back on earth, they look at you. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong. &gt;&gt; The same way you jump when you are given a car, when you are given a house, &gt;&gt; you must also make a lot of noise. &gt;&gt; Just giving about adoption. &gt;&gt; That's a real believer. Because the power is in the word. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Are you preaching right now? &gt;&gt; This thing that what I'm preaching, how many can say amen? &gt;&gt; You will find yourself healed. &gt;&gt; You will find yourself at a place. [cheering] You find yourself set free. Brother Luke, &gt;&gt; can someone show me &gt;&gt; where brother showered John Shar &gt;&gt; and say, "Brother John Shar, receive your millions." Can anyone show me where brotherham said that? But brother Brham said, John Shar came to the meeting. He did not have children. He was poor. HE WAS GETTING 20 CENTS AN HOUR TO BUST CONCRETE. and he he came and believed every word that I preached. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what made John Shar to be a millionaire? He believed the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU HEAR PASTOR PREACHING THE DEEP MESSAGES the word, it [laughter] is an indirect way of showering you. &gt;&gt; How many? &gt;&gt; How many? Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no way when we preach the word, you will go back the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can say &gt;&gt; I was talking one time with Pastor Adrian. I'm telling you that when we preach the word, the signs and miracles and wonders will follow. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; And it is it [laughter] is the season now. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. We can't just continue coming and say brother Brham says brotherham SAYS BROTHERHAM SAYS NO. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO SEE THE MANIFESTATION of what brother say &gt;&gt; and WE WON'T STEER YOUR EMOTIONS. &gt;&gt; IT WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY. &gt;&gt; BROTHER CAN shock you. Brother says &gt;&gt; this divinely revealed mystery truth. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; He says the divinely revealed mystery truth &gt;&gt; will literally &gt;&gt; will literally &gt;&gt; turn the hands of the children back to THE PENTECOSTAL FATHERS. &gt;&gt; WHO ARE THE PENTECOSTAL FATHERS? &gt;&gt; It was the Peters. &gt;&gt; What was happening in Pentecost? &gt;&gt; Peter's shadow WAS HEALING THE SIEGE. Peter will come by the BEAUTIFUL but such as I have arise and go. &gt;&gt; They prayed and PETER WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY can say amen? SIGNS AND WONDERS AND MIRACLES TOOK PLACE. Can someone say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; But now, pastor me, how do we go back to Pentecost? Let's say we want to experience that. Can I be honest with you? &gt;&gt; Yes, it's good to pray. Yes, it's good to fast. But brother Brandham says this divinely revealed mystery truth will literally &gt;&gt; turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecable. &gt;&gt; As pastor Adrian is preaching the divinely revealed miss truth, you'll find yourself healed. You'll find yourself promoted. YOU'LL SEE FIRE COMING DOWN. YOU SEE miracles &gt;&gt; we don't how many can say amen &gt;&gt; steer people's emotions we don't propagate how many can say amen &gt;&gt; Jesus did not stress the importance of works as he did the word &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF PEOPLE GOT the word WOULD FOLLOW that so when we preach the When WE PREACH THE WORD, IF IT IS THE REAL WORD, &gt;&gt; we speak like the Greeks to say WE WOULD SEE JESUS. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Says they were tired &gt;&gt; of lecturers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They wanted to see who is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Even this is high time, brother Luke, we see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many &gt;&gt; even right now? As I preach, I DON'T CARE WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION. &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE? &gt;&gt; AS I just preach the word [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; as we preach discerning the two spirits in the framework of the Christian church, you find yourself WITH THE HOLY GHOST. YOU FIND yourself healed. You find YOURSELF SET FREE. I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; I'm talking ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; GOD, A POWERLESS RELIGION. Someone say amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Can someone SAY brother Tony? &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT CATHOLIC BISHOP. &gt;&gt; COME ON. You know if we are not CAREFUL PASTOR IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL &gt;&gt; WHEN A DEMON manifest we will call police. &gt;&gt; You [laughter] hear a pastor saying demons can we call the police brother? It's I'm telling you you are laughing &gt;&gt; but some people THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; They say what is this now brother? Do you have a number for the police? &gt;&gt; Because we DON'T HAVE THE POWER. &gt;&gt; WE ARE JUST TALKING. HOW MANY CAN SAY AMEN? But if you continue listening to the word, listening to the word, ONE OF THESE DAYS, &gt;&gt; ONE OF THESE DAYS, &gt;&gt; but do you see how it happens? &gt;&gt; You don't propagate it. &gt;&gt; You don't steal people's emotions. You just preach the word. &gt;&gt; You just preach the word. &gt;&gt; And if it IS THE TRUE WORD, HOW MANY CAN SAY &gt;&gt; MIRACLES WILL HAPPEN. Even right now, &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT TELL ME THAT PASTOR, I'M ALREADY BLESSED. &gt;&gt; I'M ALREADY set free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John, &gt;&gt; can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; John Charlott just became a millionaire &gt;&gt; by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God will defeat Satan anytime, any place, under any circumstance. [laughter] Even here in Phoenix, even today &gt;&gt; the devil can go. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; So that what was I saying, Pastor M? &gt;&gt; When sometimes &gt;&gt; we need to teach people, &gt;&gt; people need to be grounded, &gt;&gt; people need to be solid. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because brotherham says an evangelist they water the seeds that the teachers has already planted. &gt;&gt; So the teacher and the evangelist they work hand in hand. So if pastor does not plant the seeds &gt;&gt; even if an evangelist comes how many can say amen. The seed won't germinate because it's not planted. says preaching, it's watering the seeds that has been planted. &gt;&gt; So don't underestimate &gt;&gt; when you see pastor me planting the seeds, planting the seeds. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; The rain will come &gt;&gt; to quicken what has been planted. &gt;&gt; So we are both working together. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; So can I just see how I wind up? How many we blessed? &gt;&gt; How many [applause] blessed? blessed. &gt;&gt; How many are going to hold on to the word &gt;&gt; because the real word &gt;&gt; has got power? The real word has got healing. The real word has got miracles. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; DON'T UNDERESTIMATE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY can say amen? &gt;&gt; When your pastor is preaching, just teaching, I'm being honest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will find yourself set free. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? When God allows me to run around and evangelize, I will do it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But we should not be people who are one-sided. &gt;&gt; The power what what you understand. There's also others as well that also want the the teaching alone without also the miracle good. &gt;&gt; Can I also give you the quotation for that? Brother says some people have got the word only without the spirit. Some people have got the spirit only without the word. So we must mix the B and [cheering and applause] the spirit. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY CAN say amen? &gt;&gt; The mechanics and the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So if we just continue on the word only. Oh, I see that church. I'm not talking about you. You see that right? You see what what and people are seeking. People want brother. We want. How many say amen? &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; So God to come down &gt;&gt; to manifest his power. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. Sometimes I feel like evangelists must go and preach and teachers churches and teachers must go and teach evangelist. How many are saying? &gt;&gt; I'm being honest. &gt;&gt; We need one another. &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Do you love him, brother? &gt;&gt; How many say amen? &gt;&gt; Listen now, pastor. He says here, how many were blessed? He says here, I'll preach. He says, and we see how he heads up. &gt;&gt; See, pastor Ed, he says, and you get that on the telephone. You see, he says now, if the Lord permits us to do it. So, brother Brana wanted to preach betrayal of the serpent. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He wanted to look for a hole to preach that. Listen. And then he says, "If the Lord permits us to do it." And now just watch how cunning that fellow is. Listen, I'm telling you, brother Brham is bringing some of the contents &gt;&gt; of the trail of the sand of what he wanted to preach. If he was get if he was if he got the opportunity, no, let watch. He says, he says, "And you you all get okay." He says, "And now you just [clears throat] watch how cunning that fellow is. &gt;&gt; How he is just exactly well. They hey they are just like Judas &gt;&gt; and Jesus there. both brothers in their tribe &gt;&gt; like Esau and Jacob, &gt;&gt; the crow and the dove &gt;&gt; sitting on the same roost and everything is a twin &gt;&gt; in this great warfare that we are in. Brother, when I saw this, &gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying? So I see an idea. I'm I'm not preaching the trail of the seven. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching the two spirits that are working within the framework &gt;&gt; of the Christian church. So brother and pastor listen be honest. Me I want people who are honest. &gt;&gt; Don't say pastor Moses is making up things. This is it. How many can [laughter] say amen? &gt;&gt; Huh? He says here how cunning the fellow is. Number one, he is coming. Are we together? Number two, he says Judas and Jesus there. So in other words, where Jesus is, &gt;&gt; Judas will also be there. &gt;&gt; Where Isa is, Jacob will also be there. And brother Brham comes as well and says a revival produces twins. So in other words, do you see friends as I close how the devil operates? &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? He comes within &gt;&gt; even in the garden of Eden you will see that there was the tree of of life &gt;&gt; and besides that there was the tree of the good and evil &gt;&gt; of the knowledge of the good and evil so they are always twins &gt;&gt; when Jesus comes on the scene Judas also comes on the scene &gt;&gt; when Jesus left the scene and he was hanging on the cross we see Judas as well he's hanging on on a tree as well. So brother, if you are honest, you will see these clues. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; But it's a twin war. &gt;&gt; These are twins. So the battle he says here, pastor, he says, and everything is a twin in this great what? Warfare that we are in. So you must KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. &gt;&gt; So the battle is inside. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Hey, when there is Moses, there is Ramses. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Where there is Moses, can I read this quickly? &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Can I read this? Numbers chapter 16. Pastor me, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Numbers chapter 16. &gt;&gt; Pastor Johnny, are you there, my friend? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many? Yeah. Listen. Numbers chapter 16 verse one. Now, Kora, the son of Each, &gt;&gt; the son of Kath, the son of Levi, and Datan, and Abam, the sons of Elab, and on the son of Pale, sons of Reuben, &gt;&gt; took men. &gt;&gt; How many can say you hear here that says sons of what? Levi. &gt;&gt; So, you see that this was a family affair. &gt;&gt; A brother is born for adversity. So you see that these people that were fighting Moses, it was men of renown, &gt;&gt; famous in the congregation, &gt;&gt; and can we read again in in what? Revelation 12, you are going to see something. Revelation 12. Pastor Adrian, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Revelation 12 verse 7. The Bible says, "And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought he with his angels &gt;&gt; and [singing] prevailed not so I can't continue but watch in this warfare &gt;&gt; there is this that I want to close with the principle of the rightand man &gt;&gt; can someone say the principle of the rightand man &gt;&gt; the devil how many can say amen he will use something that is close to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why sometimes you see that you hear a pastor's daughter was impregnated, a pastor's son did this. Can I tell you today it's not the problem of the pastor. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to attack the what? The pastor and he he fails and he will use something close. He knows that if the pastor is drugs, it will affect the devil uses the principle [clears throat] of the right hand. &gt;&gt; And please listen to this. I'm serious. Now, if you are serious, let's pray &gt;&gt; for all [singing] the right hand men of our pastor. &gt;&gt; I mean it. Amen. &gt;&gt; People who are close to our pastors, &gt;&gt; let's pray for them. &gt;&gt; Brother Luke, do you know why? Because the devil uses people who are close. He can Oh, brother. Do you hear what I'm saying? Many people they say Peter was so weak. Peter could do this. You know, sometimes you ask as you think maybe foolish questions. Sometimes he's found only what in a river in without clothes and what and people say hey Peter needs grace. &gt;&gt; Some people think that James and John they were so powerful more than Peter. That's a lie. &gt;&gt; It's only that John and James they were not where Peter was. &gt;&gt; Do you hear? If they were where Peter was, do you know that Peter was the right hand man? He was given the keys. So the devil will come using something which is close. That's why Jesus when Peter came now and said no no no he cut someone's ear. He says you can't go there. You can't die. Do you know he was against the will of God? It was the devil that was using him. And Jesus said get thee behind Satan. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you? He says we want to trail him. How many? So when you hear about the trail of the serpent, &gt;&gt; we are not talking about seven seat. &gt;&gt; Hear me? &gt;&gt; What is a trail? A trail is a path. &gt;&gt; A trail, how many can say amen? Is a road. So when we talk about the trail of the serpent, we are not preaching serpent seed. We know what is happen but we are saying WE WANT TO KNOW the road which the serpent &gt;&gt; uses &gt;&gt; when you know that &gt;&gt; can I say this can I say this a person how many can say can how many are being blessed &gt;&gt; listen [clears throat] we want to we are not in ignorant of his devices we are saying we are saying the trail of the what of the serpent he says We want to train. We want to see his Can I say Can I say this? People who work in zoos or in the national parks there, &gt;&gt; they are now experienced those guides. &gt;&gt; When they see the trail, &gt;&gt; the marks of the animals, they know this is a lion. &gt;&gt; This is a &gt;&gt; this is a leopard. Do you know why? If you don't know the trail, &gt;&gt; the foot marks of a leopard, &gt;&gt; you will go where it is &gt;&gt; and you will die. &gt;&gt; But if you know that these are the trails of a leopard, you change direction. SO THIS WHAT I'M PREACHING, &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO see the trail of the enemy &gt;&gt; so that YOU DON'T NEED HIM. SO THAT YOU CHANGE DIRECTION. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; You can go [applause] exactly WHERE THE LION IS, &gt;&gt; WHERE THE DEVIL IS. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; So we are saying you must know that what my brother. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So when I was seeing as I close I saw pastor Adrian that oh the devil uses this principle &gt;&gt; of the right man in heaven. How many can say amen? Satan was almost equal with God except creation. Do you know that? And he is the one who was listen again when we go down here. The devil used the serpent which was so close &gt;&gt; to mankind. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Look at brother Brana when he made one of his most fatile mistakes here in South Africa. It was his right hand man and those ministers they said no no no no you must go to CL stop. You must go there. Brother says no. The angel said I must go to Junior Sydney Jackson's farm for 10 days and go to job then after that I must go to Deb. &gt;&gt; But the man of God I'm talking about that trail not that they wanted it but they did not know that they were listen Mr. Schum and those ministers they were just in the trail. &gt;&gt; How many say? &gt;&gt; How many are saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at Judas. He was just in the trail. He was the right man. So all the arrows just came to him. &gt;&gt; That's why you see even we pastors we are always in trouble because smite the shepherd and the sheep will scatter. So all the dads they come to us because we are the right hand men of God. &gt;&gt; Who organized the coup? How many can say amen? Ah was the counselor of what? Of David &gt;&gt; and he teamed up with Jonathan. But I'm TALKING ABOUT THE TRAIL. HOW MANY can say amen? &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm saying pray &gt;&gt; for the ministers &gt;&gt; in your assembly. Pray for the associate pastors. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not it's not that they are evil, but they are right in the trail. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; He uses the principle of the right hand man. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Even when we cast out a demon right now, I have cast out some demons. You will see a demon speaking. It's me. I'm the auntie. She won't survive. She won't progress. Is someone close &gt;&gt; is the one that wants to finish you. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Look at Look at how many can say amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the people even right now. How many who are destroying this message? Men of &gt;&gt; can I shock you the people who are doing more to this message. I'm sorry to say this. It is not young ministers like us like this but no it is men of renown. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? In the congregation people who study funny things. How many can say amen? It's men of renown listed upon our feet. How many can say amen? How many? [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Look at Job. &gt;&gt; His wife said kiss God. &gt;&gt; She was close says you speak like one of the foolish woman. &gt;&gt; He never said you are foolish. You speak like &gt;&gt; how many can say amen. Moses who was fighting him. Hey pastor Le. May God help us. And I thank God that it moved so well. &gt;&gt; Was anyone offended? &gt;&gt; Was was anyone offended? &gt;&gt; Let's pray for our &gt;&gt; pray also for your wife. &gt;&gt; The devil can also use your wife &gt;&gt; to take you out of God's will. Look at William Brham when he was called to organize that for him to preach in Mishawak and then his mother-in-law came and said don't take my daughter to thrash like that &gt;&gt; someone was so close and brother Brham lost his wife &gt;&gt; lost his daughter because of that many times we get in trouble because of people who are so &gt;&gt; so but what am I saying this warfare the devil uses infiltration He comes inside. So the people who want to destroy this message, they are in the message. &gt;&gt; People who are preaching polygamy in the message. Funny doctrines. People who say the rapture has already happened. &gt;&gt; People who are saying we are now in the millennium defend the two spirit which are working in the framework of the Christian church.

Hallelujah. speaking to us, Lord God, and interpreting your word, Lord God. And ab father, we know, Lord God, that your word has fallen on good ground, Lord God, that it will take root and bear fruit, Lord God. Father, what a Lord, an encouragement, Lord God, Lord, to know that you are mindful of us, Lord God. And our father, in this world, that we would have trouble, Lord God, even as we sit in our closest friend, a brother would deceive us. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But we thank you, Lord, that you said that you'd [singing] stick to it close. We promise, Lord God, that you'd not only be with us, but you'd be in us, Lord God, even until the end of the world, Lord, that you would go before us, Lord God. And if you are for us, who can be against us, Lord, Lord, and therefore, as your bride this evening, Lord, we know that your bride cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; And our father, we are a type of people, Lord. We are a people that cannot be deceived. And our father what a comfort that it is Lord God and Lord God we haven't come this evening Lord God with vain repetition of words Lord God we know Lord God that that many Lord God with their lips they profess so many things but their heart tells something else Lord God. Therefore, we want to make sure that our approach is right, Lord God. That our attitude is right, Lord God. For that alone, Lord God, will bring every promise of yours into manifestation, Lord God, because you are the word, Lord God, and our father, every need here this evening, Lord God.

We got the word Lord God in spirit and in truth God. Aba Father, we have all of thee, Lord God. And our father, we pray, Lord God, that Lord, you will be our portion and be our guide. May your blessings go over each one that's gathered here, Lord God, this evening, Lord God.

Oh, and they're going out, Lord, looking for something, Lord. But in that time, the bridegroom came, Lord God, and they want to be left behind, Lord God. For our greatest desire, Lord, is to make heaven our home, Lord God. And as your prophet said, it is only by the grace of God. And we pray now this evening, Lord God, even as we close, may that grace of God, Lord God, that surpasses all human understanding, Lord God, may it be now showed upon your children that they have no room to contain what you have for them, Lord God.
