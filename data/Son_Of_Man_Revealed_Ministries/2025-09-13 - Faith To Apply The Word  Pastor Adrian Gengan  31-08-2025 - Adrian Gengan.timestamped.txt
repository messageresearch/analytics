[0:02] always.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to his name.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; It's time to give God glory.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[0:17] I don't want to miss this opportunity.
[0:18] You know, when God does something, you
[0:22] need to give him glory.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; When God does something, you need to
[0:26] honor him. Amen.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; When God does something, you need to
[0:30] praise him.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; And that is what if you go through the
[0:35] Bible, you'll see everybody praise the
[0:38] Lord
[0:39] &gt;&gt; when something happened.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; No matter how big.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; No matter how small.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; God must be glorified.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Because he is the only hope that we
[0:52] have.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the hope of glory that we
[0:56] share
[0:57] &gt;&gt; together as believers.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; And we have to encourage one another.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Through this journey. We have a journey
[1:07] that is full of storms. We have a
[1:09] journey that is full of uh troubles and
[1:14] winding roads and gravel roads and
[1:16] mountains. We need to climb.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; But we will climb it together.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23] That's the God that we serve.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; We need to honor you.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; This morning, I greet you in the name of
[1:32] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; It is a privilege this morning to stand
[1:37] before you
[1:39] and say thank you, Lord.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Going back to 2020,
[1:48] I had no hope.
[1:50] There was no hope.
[1:54] But we thank
[1:56] the Lord that he is the hope that we can
[1:59] take.
[2:04] And at that time I said, "The Lord
[2:08] there was no purpose for me to be on
[2:11] earth.
[2:13] I've served you honestly with everything
[2:16] that I have."
[2:18] It was wind, rain or storm.
[2:21] There were times that I preached
[2:24] in the open air at 32° 33°.
[2:29] Although I was a hard patient, you would
[2:32] say,
[2:35] but
[2:37] I said, Lord, if you if there is a
[2:40] purpose for me on earth,
[2:43] I am prepared to stay.
[2:46] But if there's nothing, Lord, take me
[2:49] home
[2:52] because
[2:54] it was so much too bad
[2:58] that my body just couldn't take it.
[3:03] When I heard the nurse say, "I don't
[3:05] know whether this uncle will make it."
[3:09] As she closed the door to another nurse,
[3:12] and that was I think it was about 1:00
[3:14] in the morning.
[3:16] And that's when I cried out to the Lord.
[3:20] I said, "Lord,
[3:22] you are my only hope.
[3:26] And as I lay in this bed,
[3:34] as you said, you will not leave me nor
[3:37] forsake me until the end of this world."
[3:43] I said Lord I will not stop serving you
[3:49] but if it means that I need to come home
[3:53] please.
[3:57] And then it was 1:00 in the morning when
[3:59] I never had a bit of sleep.
[4:03] I slept like a baby.
[4:06] The doctors came. They said let him
[4:10] sleep. They told the necessity
[4:13] they went away
[4:17] and coming back
[4:20] and I could see there was like you know
[4:22] the prophet says when God is going to
[4:25] heal you the situation becomes worse.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you must know that the healing
[4:33] is taking place. And you know when you
[4:36] read the prophet's message
[4:39] and you live the prophet's message,
[4:42] there is nothing that you will forget in
[4:45] the time of trouble.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Nothing. You can't forget nothing.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; And this thing came to my remembrance. I
[4:53] said, "Lord, you told the prophet before
[4:56] there's a healing, there's going to come
[4:59] a time of worsening."
[5:03] Anyway,
[5:05] I went to the doctors this week.
[5:11] I saw the phmologist.
[5:14] He had a look at me
[5:18] and you know he was just so happy
[5:21] and he said you are strong man. You know
[5:24] he said you are strong.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; And I sat there and he said you know
[5:28] what
[5:31] you are one of the most fortunate people
[5:34] that are around.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; I said it's the grace of God.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; I said it's the grace of God.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; I said with lung cancer, you only have
[5:51] 12 months.
[5:53] Said with lung cancer, it's 18 months
[5:56] maximum.
[5:58] You'll be gone. But he said, "Look at
[6:01] you."
[6:05] I told him, "Just God's grace."
[6:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; I'm stud. It says 5 years.
[6:11] He said, "We got steps and I'll show you
[6:13] the steps."
[6:16] I said, "The Lord has done the work."
[6:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:27] And on Thursday, I had an M and I
[6:30] scanned them
[6:34] and I thought, Lord, I don't think so
[6:37] the devil has got any more
[6:40] any more chances in my life.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; He tried it. He did it to Job. He did it
[6:50] to all the servants of God.
[6:52] But he's finished.
[6:55] I had my scan and Friday I went for the
[6:58] results
[7:00] and the ancologist said, he looked at me
[7:04] again. He said, you know, he just smiled
[7:07] and he said, you know what, you are
[7:08] strong.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; He said, you know, it's just because we
[7:12] caught it early and and all that. And he
[7:16] says, you know, I said, but it's the
[7:19] grace of God.
[7:21] and he looked at me and he said, "We
[7:24] will only do blood tests
[7:28] once a year
[7:30] and we'll do MRI
[7:33] twice a year." I mean, two every two
[7:36] years. It says,
[7:40] "I think this is over." I don't think
[7:44] so. After 5 years, we never saw anybody
[7:46] having it.
[7:49] And I just want to encourage you this
[7:51] morning.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you this morning.
[7:56] Whatever you are looking for this
[7:58] morning in your life. Whatever it is, no
[8:02] matter how small, no matter how big,
[8:06] we have a great God.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; We want to give him glory.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; For the great things he has done.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Not only in my life,
[8:16] &gt;&gt; I think in many of your lives also.
[8:18] And I want to say to God be the glory.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Great things he has done.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; And there is, you know, I can give you a
[8:28] testimony. It can go for hours.
[8:31] But I want to tell you this morning,
[8:33] this God is a never failing God.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; He is never late.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; He is always
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; on time.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; He will turn the thing around. Amen.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; He can even turn the clock around.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; That's him.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; And nothing can change.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; He is the same
[8:55] &gt;&gt; yesterday,
[8:56] &gt;&gt; today, and forever.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Lay your burdens at the cross.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Lay your burdens there,
[9:02] &gt;&gt; and God will make a way where there seem
[9:04] to be no way.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; The turns will be very great. The
[9:08] mountains may be high. The seas may be
[9:11] deep, but our God can go anywhere. I was
[9:15] just reading this morning, you know,
[9:18] when
[9:19] Ezekiel asked, "Can these dry bones
[9:22] live?" If the dry bones jumped up and
[9:25] lived in that senior and everything,
[9:27] what about us this morning?
[9:30] &gt;&gt; We have flesh, we have blood,
[9:33] &gt;&gt; we have voice, we have breath,
[9:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Who I am, Lord.
[9:45] Who I am.
[9:47] [Music]
[9:49] I can see now.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Who I am.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; You see, I'm part of my savior.
[10:01] I'm part of his word.
[10:06] It's a revelation.
[10:10] It's predestination
[10:14] of who I am.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, who I am, Lord.

[10:54] Oh, glorious victory.
[10:59] That day he set me free
[11:02] and made my heart.
[11:07] is very tall.
[11:11] My life is no longer mine.
[11:15] I'm a prison of life.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; And now I live
[11:22] to praise his name.
[11:25] Who I am. Oh, I have
[11:31] who I am.
[11:35] I can see now. I can see clear who I am.
[11:41] He opened the book and he saw me. I'm
[11:43] part of my savior.
[11:47] I'm part of his word.
[11:51] It's a revelation
[11:56] [Music]
[11:59] of who I am.
[12:03] from Calvary.
[12:05] He died
[12:07] to redeem his lost bride.
[12:11] The King of Kings, the King of Kings,
[12:15] became my Savior.
[12:19] This is God's great mystery
[12:23] of his love for you and me
[12:27] that Christ and I
[12:30] might be made one who I am. Oh I am
[12:37] Lord.
[12:40] Who I am.
[12:44] I can see now just who I am. who I am.

[13:31] I'm part of his work.
[13:35] It's a revelation

[13:39] predestination
[13:42] [Music]
[13:43] of who I am.

[24:26] God has sent a message to prepare us for
[24:28] that body change.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the message that's
[24:32] going to change our bodies.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.

[24:36] on the brother Brandham says our new
[24:38] body will materialize around that word
[24:39] because this word has strengthening
[24:41] power.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Brandham calls the
[24:43] message the shout he calls it the living
[24:46] bread of life.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Not just ordinary bread. Yeah.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; We eat bread that's not living.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; But he calls this the living bread of
[24:54] life.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So a living bread
[24:59] of life to a living people.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And one of these days his body has
[25:03] got to give way to the word that we are
[25:05] feeding on.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Amen. But in the days of the
[25:09] voice of the seventh angel
[25:13] &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery of God should be
[25:18] finished as he had declared to his
[25:21] servants the prophets. Now people are
[25:24] confused with that scripture. They think
[25:26] that that is the seventh trumpeting
[25:28] angel.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; But if you read the book of Revelation,
[25:34] when an angel is sounding, it will say
[25:35] the angel sounded.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's saying when he shall begin to
[25:40] sound.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; So the seventh angel is a he, not a she.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. The seventh angel is a man from
[25:47] the earth. The prophet says the seventh
[25:48] angel is on earth at the time of the
[25:51] coming of revelation 10 angel.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; So when he shall begin to sound the
[25:55] mystery of God should be finished as he
[25:58] had declared to his servants the
[25:59] prophets. The Lord had blessings through
[26:01] the reading of his word. You may be
[26:02] seated.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:12] Amen. So I also want you to remember
[26:14] Amen. Uh
[26:17] I forget the name of family. Amen. But
[26:20] if you know brother Clive, that's s's uh
[26:23] father.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He passed away yesterday.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; And so we pray that the Lord will be
[26:27] with the family.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember them. He was just 61
[26:30] years of age.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; But he was a man who stood for the
[26:33] message of the hour.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; He believed the word.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh that's if you know Pastor
[26:38] Trish. Amen. From Kumas, that's his
[26:40] brother. So we remember the family in
[26:42] prayer. Amen. even as they go through
[26:44] this time of grieving and loss in their
[26:47] family. Amen. We pray that the Lord will
[26:49] be with them. So, amen. So, we want to
[26:52] get into our message this morning and
[26:56] maybe for a simple title,
[27:02] call it faith to apply the word.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Faith to apply the word. Amen.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; We have faith to believe the word.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; We all have faith to believe the word.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; We have faith to receive the word.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; But do we have faith to apply the word?
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; So we want to see where we are currently
[27:29] &gt;&gt; and see what is required.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Because if I ask all of us, we all
[27:34] believe the word.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; So we don't need faith to believe.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[27:40] Amen.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; We all have received the word.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; We don't need faith to receive the word.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; But where we are lacking is the
[27:49] application of the word.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Faith to apply the word.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that in our kingdom now
[27:58] in in our first port here, we'll go to
[27:59] Christ the mystery of God. Just to lay
[28:01] our background, we are talking about a
[28:03] headship
[28:05] and we are the lively stones that are
[28:07] connecting with Christ the word. Amen.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are here to welcome back Christ
[28:13] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; So our headship is Christ and he says
[28:17] our headship is a kingdom.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; So the kingdom of God is within you.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; That's not foreign to us because it's
[28:26] Christ in us.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; So he's just putting it another way
[28:31] saying the kingdom of God is within you.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; So when Christ is in you, you become the
[28:37] kingdom of God. Amen.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; So kingdom has laws, kingdom has
[28:41] principles.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus said the kingdom, we are not a
[28:47] denomination. We belong to a kingdom.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the kingdom is the word of
[28:53] God.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not lose sight of the simple
[28:58] statement. The kingdom is the word of
[29:00] God which the prophet brought to us to
[29:03] put the word of God in us. To put the
[29:05] kingdom of God within us.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Now, what he's saying, the kingdom is
[29:12] the word of God and it's to be made
[29:14] spirit and life in our own life.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; So, when the word comes inside of us, it
[29:21] must becomes because Jesus said, "My
[29:23] word is spirit."
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; And my word is life.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; So, that word that's within us becomes
[29:29] spirit and life. It becomes a living
[29:30] word.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; And when that word starts to push out,
[29:35] it's going to push out unbelief. It's
[29:37] going to push out doubt. It's going to
[29:39] push out reasoning.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've got to allow the word to
[29:42] have effect on our lives.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] Bringing to pass every promise in this
[29:50] day.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Now, when I'm saying in this day, I'm
[29:52] talking about August 2025.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. To the day and to the hour.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want yesterday's promises.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Yesterday's promises were good for
[30:04] yesterday.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want the promises for today.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Bringing to pass every promise in this
[30:15] day as it did in that day when the word
[30:18] and God was one. And the word and God is
[30:21] one in his church today.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; The word and God was one in Jesus
[30:25] Christ. The fullness of the God dwelt in
[30:27] Jesus Christ.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; He's saying that was that day. Yeah.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; But when Christ comes in you,
[30:33] &gt;&gt; he says the word and God is one in his
[30:35] church today, making it the headship of
[30:38] the body that is redeemed to bring the
[30:40] message in the last day and be taken
[30:43] from the dead in the resurrection. So
[30:45] Christ has come in you, the spirit of
[30:48] Christ has come in you to bring a
[30:50] resurrection in you.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; God don't want you to remain trapped in
[30:54] a flesh body. But the message of the
[30:57] hour, the word of God has come now to
[30:59] translate our bodies.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; If I can use this as a measuring line.
[31:05] Jesus Christ died. He rose again. And he
[31:08] has set it up here.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; It's been 2,000 years. People think that
[31:14] things are still continuing the same,
[31:16] but time has moved on.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; We are not here anymore.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Neither are we here.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; We are almost right here. If I can put
[31:24] it right here. We are ending finishing.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; But just because we can't see through
[31:29] God's eyes in the timeline, we may be
[31:31] thinking we somewhere here and there's
[31:33] still far more time for us.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Don't be mistaken and
[31:38] don't be left behind.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be when the message is urgent, we
[31:42] ought to get into the things of God. We
[31:44] ought to make sure that Christ is living
[31:46] within us because the only provided
[31:48] place of worship is Christ in me. The
[31:51] hope of glory.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Where he put his name. Yes.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; God hasn't put his name on a church
[31:56] building, but God has tabernacles of the
[31:58] living God. God has put his name on me.
[32:01] I'm a branded ambassador of Jesus
[32:03] Christ. Amen. People brand Catholics.
[32:06] People branded property. Amen. But I'm
[32:08] branded by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Christ has put his personal seal upon
[32:16] me.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Watch now. and be taken up from the dead
[32:22] in the resurrection to go back and will
[32:24] restore again as Adam and Eve in the
[32:27] beginning in the Garden of Eden. The
[32:29] three-fold mystery of God, his body. Oh
[32:32] my.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Now, watch what he's trying to do. He's
[32:35] trying to bring the mystery down to show
[32:37] you that you are a part of the mystery
[32:38] of God.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Do you know the mystery ends in you?
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, church of God.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not God above us. It's not
[32:50] God will. Amen. With us. It's God in us.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; God in us.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. What he says now continuing. And
[32:59] when Christ takes you over, he'll
[33:02] express that word right through you.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yes, Lord.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Through you.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to see the word
[33:09] fly past you. The word is coming through
[33:11] you.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Because it's him. He is the word. And
[33:15] then you can see the expression of
[33:17] Christ. Not some illusion of some sort,
[33:20] but a real genuine Christ expressing
[33:22] himself right through you.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; How will the world see Christ right
[33:28] through you?
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, how can we stay silent?
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Christ must be expressed through us.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. People think that
[33:40] Jesus is Amen. Christ is walking through
[33:42] a great group of people. No. Listen to
[33:43] what he says. He says, "Who do you say I
[33:45] am?" He's asking the church. He's 12 out
[33:48] of millions that day he asked 12.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; His church in the day he says in
[33:54] millions in the days of Noah he asked
[33:56] eight.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; And he said as it was in the days of
[34:00] Noah so will it be in the coming of the
[34:02] son of man. See where eight souls were
[34:04] saved. I don't say there's going to be
[34:06] eight saved. Now don't get that all
[34:09] wrong. I never said that. I don't know
[34:11] how many is be going to be saved. He
[34:14] says that last moment to rapture that
[34:17] little group.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; It'll be a small group. I tell you that.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; For straight is the gate and narrow is
[34:24] the way, but few there'll be that find
[34:27] it.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm one of the few.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can testify. I'm one of the few
[34:35] that has found it.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to go in any broad way.
[34:38] I want to stay in the straight way. No
[34:40] matter how narrow it gets, I want to
[34:42] stay in the narrow way.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Now, how many of us can say we've been
[34:50] in the message and we don't know the
[34:51] word?
[34:52] &gt;&gt; We all know the word.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. How much more of the word must
[34:57] teachers and preachers come to explain
[34:58] to us?
[34:59] &gt;&gt; I don't think it it's more of the word
[35:01] that we need. I think that people are
[35:03] failing to apply the word.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; We know how to do things. We know what
[35:09] the word says about us. We know what's
[35:11] to be done with the word. But we are we
[35:13] don't we maybe don't have a don't care
[35:15] attitude that we not interested to apply
[35:17] the word.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know the word but we don't
[35:22] practice the word.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Oh help us Lord. Yeah.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; We are hearing.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are recognizing.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; We are believing.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; But we are not acting.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; But true believing will make us act. Now
[35:38] if there's no acting, if there's no
[35:40] action, our believing is in vain.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; We will not see any results of our
[35:45] faith.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Now in this time and season, the word
[35:48] that's been put into us is producing
[35:50] perfect faith.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Don't be expecting with this end time
[35:57] message. Don't be expecting a weak
[35:59] faith.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; With this end time message, we ought to
[36:04] be expecting perfect faith to be
[36:05] produced through us. Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray that you hear what I'm saying
[36:09] this morning. We are not looking for
[36:11] some kind of mustard seed faith.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour didn't come to
[36:15] produce mustard seed faith.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to produce
[36:19] perfect faith, a faith in a walk like
[36:22] Enoch had. Amen. To change this old vile
[36:24] modies.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; And I say it's based on expectation. If
[36:30] you are expecting, Amen. a little bitty
[36:32] fade out of this message, you're going
[36:34] to be sorely disappointed. But if you're
[36:36] expecting, amen, a changing of the body,
[36:39] if you're expecting, amen, the
[36:40] resurrection of the sleeping saints,
[36:42] that's what this message has come to
[36:44] produce.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to act on our faith. We
[36:50] will not see any results if we don't act
[36:52] on our faith. And the Holy Ghost is the
[36:55] action of God in you.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; We have to believe the word. Faith to
[37:00] receive the word.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know faith is the
[37:03] revelation of the word. We all have a
[37:04] revelation of the word but free to
[37:06] operate the word.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Abraham had faith to receive the word.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Get thee out of thy country. He received
[37:14] the word.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had faith to follow the word.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; He had faith to let the word lead him.
[37:20] He had faith to believe for the
[37:22] impossible. Even when they told him, you
[37:24] are past the age of childbearing.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Abraham, you don't even have enough seed
[37:28] within you.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Abraham's Amen. Sarah's womb is dead.
[37:33] Amen. But even past these years, he
[37:35] still had faith to believe God's word.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Now, God told Abraham they were going to
[37:40] have a son.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; His name shall be called Isaac. Yet his
[37:43] wife is barren.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; He and and time passes, even in his
[37:49] natural strength, he can't now reproduce
[37:51] his own life.
[37:53] He passed that age of childbearing
[37:55] himself,
[37:56] &gt;&gt; but he still held on to the word. I'm
[37:59] saying your situation,
[38:01] &gt;&gt; it's not too far gone.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Science was even testifying to Abraham
[38:06] and Sarah that you can't have a child
[38:07] anymore. But God goes above and beyond
[38:10] science. Amen. No matter what the
[38:12] doctor's report is, no matter what your
[38:14] situation is, hold on to God's word
[38:16] because God's word will never fail.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; If God has given a promise, heavens and
[38:21] earth will pass away, but his word will
[38:23] never pass away.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; It may sound like a foolish thing this
[38:28] morning that we are talking about
[38:29] preparing for a rapture, preparing for a
[38:31] body change, something amen that the
[38:33] world thinks is impossible. Something
[38:35] they think is a story in the Bible.
[38:37] Maybe it happened to Enoch. Maybe it
[38:39] happened to Elijah. But will it happen
[38:41] to us? I say yes, it shall happen to us.
[38:44] That's my faith. Amen. That's what I'm
[38:46] believing. Amen. I'm not believing this
[38:48] end time message for no reason. Amen. I
[38:50] believe in this message because it's a
[38:52] promised word for a body change. Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; I have expectation for believing this
[38:58] message.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; There's promises attached to believing
[39:01] this message.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not just wandering around idle here.
[39:05] Amen. I have a promise to believe the
[39:07] message.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; The message must produce something.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Otherwise, we can go to
[39:15] just any church and just expect and say
[39:17] maybe one day the Lord will appear in
[39:18] the sky.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; And we'll all be changed. Amen. Every
[39:22] eye will see because every television
[39:23] network will now broadcast. That's what
[39:26] denominations believe.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; But they don't know the hidden mystery.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; That Christ is descended with a shout.
[39:33] Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Revelation 10. The mighty
[39:36] angel has come down with a shout.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; That might sound amen to you. But you
[39:42] know that's a hidden mystery to them.
[39:44] They don't know that the mighty angel
[39:45] has come down in 1963. Amen. They don't
[39:48] know that the mighty angel Christ came
[39:50] down to open up the seven seals.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you go to Romans 4:18 there,
[40:00] you'll see. Amen. The kind of faith that
[40:02] Abraham had who against hope believed in
[40:04] hope.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; That he might become the father of many
[40:08] nations.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, Amen. that you shall become
[40:13] the owner of many business.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes. I don't expect everyone
[40:18] to catch what I'm saying here.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; He was the father of many nations
[40:22] &gt;&gt; even before he could have a child. I
[40:24] said that you shall be the owner of many
[40:26] business. Amen.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; According to that which was spoken, so
[40:35] shall thy seed be. And being not weak in
[40:38] faith. Now listen to this. Faith is now
[40:41] going to become measurable
[40:42] &gt;&gt; in strength.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:46] So there is a kind of a weak faith.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; He's saying he being not weak in faith.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; He considered not his own body now dead.
[40:54] I say don't consider your symptoms.
[40:57] Don't consider the doctor's report.
[40:59] Don't consider your unemployment. Don't
[41:01] consider your current situation.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; He considered not his own body now dead.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; When he was about 100 years old, neither
[41:10] yet the dimness of Sarah's womb. He
[41:13] staggered not at the promise of God
[41:15] through unbelief.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can say the same thing. We
[41:19] are not staggering. Amen. At the word of
[41:21] God. There is no unbelief in this bride.
[41:24] There is nothing in this bride that
[41:25] Satan can work through. There is no
[41:27] unbelief in this bride that Satan can
[41:30] work through.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to
[41:34] eliminate all doubts. Came to eliminate
[41:36] all fears. Amen. There is nothing in
[41:38] this pride that Satan can work through.
[41:40] Yes. Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Satan can only walk through doubt and
[41:43] reasoning. And this message has come to
[41:45] eliminate all doubt and every reasoning.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Listen now. Yes. Here's the opposite of
[41:51] weakness. Being staggered not at the
[41:54] promise of God through unbelief, but was
[41:56] strong in faith.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Giving glory to God. Which means
[41:59] Abraham's faith had muscles. Abraham
[42:02] strength that had chest air on his
[42:03] chest. Amen. Abraham was burly. Amen.
[42:06] Abraham had faith.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:09] Praise the Lord.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; And being fully persuaded what he had
[42:13] promised, he was also able also to
[42:16] perform. And therefore, it was imputed
[42:18] to him for righteousness.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know that God sees you as
[42:21] righteous because you believe his word?
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Because of your faith that you have in
[42:25] this hour, if he imputed faith to
[42:28] Abraham for righteousness, your faith is
[42:30] going to be imputed to you for
[42:32] righteousness.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Now, it was not written for his sake
[42:37] alone. You see?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; But it was imputed to him, but for us
[42:42] also.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Get this now.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; The faith of the hour that you believe
[42:48] in.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; That you have received
[42:51] to whom it shall be imputed if we
[42:54] believe on him that raised up Jesus our
[42:56] Lord from the dead which all who was
[42:59] delivered for offenses and was raised
[43:01] again for our justification.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; So he had to apply his faith. Faith
[43:07] requires application.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say faith requires
[43:11] application.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know where where
[43:15] his faith, he had to apply his faith
[43:16] when God now gives him a son who's about
[43:18] 11 or 12 or 13 years old and he tells
[43:21] him, "Kill that son."
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Kill that son.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; That job you've been praying for and
[43:28] waiting for so long to receive, leave
[43:30] that job. Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; The home you built there in the tents,
[43:37] the finest tent you had in earth, leave
[43:39] that place.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Where he leads me, I will follow.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Where he leads me, I will follow. You
[43:46] invested all your time and energy in
[43:48] this boy and in this girl and he tells
[43:50] you, "Leave that girl.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Leave that boy."
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Application of the word.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Kill your son. Sure.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; And Abraham follows through showing his
[44:02] faith was the faith of God.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "The God that gave me this
[44:06] child when I couldn't have child is the
[44:08] one that can even raise up this boy."
[44:11] &gt;&gt; And he spoke the word even before it
[44:13] even happened. He said, "I and the lamb
[44:16] shall return."
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Even before he went up the mountain, he
[44:21] spoke the word by faith. And the word of
[44:23] God will not return void. Abraham spoke
[44:26] the word and he said, "I and the lamb
[44:28] shall return."
[44:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; The word has got to be in your mouth.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; He This man caught the mind of God. He
[44:37] knew how to speak like God. He started
[44:40] to call those things which were not as
[44:41] though they are.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; He told his servants, "I and the lad
[44:45] shall return."
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; How about our faith?
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have toothache. We
[44:54] tell our wife, "Hey, I don't know if I'm
[44:55] going to make it."
[44:59] &gt;&gt; I and the lad shall return.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. What we're talking about is faith.
[45:07] Amen. That needs to be applied. Faith
[45:09] requires application.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; And to apply something means to practice
[45:13] it.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Joshua and brother Jeff, you got
[45:19] a law firm. It's also called a practice.
[45:22] Is it called practice?
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Because you're practicing the law.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; And the kingdom of heaven also has laws
[45:29] &gt;&gt; that needs to be practiced.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you may not win every
[45:32] court case because sometimes you may not
[45:35] have known a certain law because don't
[45:37] tell me you'll know all the law. You
[45:39] still learning things. Amen. All lawyers
[45:42] still learn things. There's also case
[45:43] law that they can reference.
[45:45] So, amen. Even as we start to learn
[45:48] these things and start to practice the
[45:49] things of God, things start to become
[45:51] more clear to us.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; So the next time we have a situation,
[45:57] the next time we have a case, we know
[45:59] how to apply the law.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; And why do they reference another case?
[46:05] Governor versus Marimut
[46:07] &gt;&gt; is because case law once a court makes a
[46:12] ruling.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. What does it become?
[46:17] &gt;&gt; It becomes a president set.
[46:20] So whatever that judge ruled, you can
[46:22] quote it and say, "But he ruled and
[46:24] found this man in favor."
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you've got to rule the same
[46:27] way.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says it this way.
[46:31] Anytime a son and daughter of God meets
[46:34] the same requirements of God's word,
[46:36] he's obligated to answer that word.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So the word is in
[46:45] the bride. We all know that. That's a
[46:47] powerful quote. The word is in the
[46:49] bride. And he says she knows what he
[46:51] wants done with the word.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; But I'm asking you, do you know what he
[46:54] wants done with the word?
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; He wants you to apply the word.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; He wants us to know what to be done with
[47:00] the word. So the word must be applied.
[47:02] And to apply means to practice.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; To apply what we know is to practice, to
[47:08] put to use.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:11] Now in the in the time of the Exodus,
[47:13] you all would remember the story. They
[47:15] could have had the blood on the eve of
[47:16] the Exodus. How many of you know they
[47:18] could have had the blood?
[47:21] They could have slain the lamb.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; They could have drained the blood into a
[47:24] bucket. They had the blood. Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; They could have been walking around with
[47:30] the blood.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; But having the revelation of the blood
[47:34] was not going to save them.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? Many churches
[47:37] have the revelation of the blood. Yes,
[47:41] &gt;&gt; they know that Christ shed his blood for
[47:43] them.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; But hauling the blood and walking around
[47:46] with the blood on the bucket was not
[47:48] what was the requirement for that day.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; The location and the application of the
[47:57] blood was important.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; The death angel would have slain every
[48:01] firstborn if the blood was not applied
[48:04] correctly.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. They couldn't have waved the their
[48:07] blood to their death angel and say,
[48:09] "Look, I got the blood." But did you
[48:11] apply the blood?
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Did you apply the blood? I know the
[48:19] message. I believe the message. Did you
[48:21] apply the message?
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Let's read Exodus 12 for those that
[48:26] don't read.
[48:27] Exodus 12. Your lamb shall be without
[48:29] blemish, a male of the first year. You
[48:32] shall take it out from the sheep or from
[48:34] the goats, and you shall keep it until
[48:36] the 14th day of the same month. And the
[48:37] whole assembly of the congregation of
[48:39] Israel shall kill it in the evening. And
[48:42] they shall take the blood and strike it
[48:44] upon the true sidepost and upon the
[48:46] upper doorpost of the houses wherein
[48:49] they shall eat.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Very specific.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Where the blood must be applied.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. upon the two side posts
[49:00] and upon the upper doorpost. And they
[49:02] shall eat the flesh in that night, roast
[49:05] with fire and unleven bread, and with
[49:07] bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not
[49:10] of it raw, nor soden at all with water,
[49:13] but roast with fire. Have a nice bri
[49:15] with it. Roast it with fire. Amen. His
[49:20] head and his legs. see some sheep head
[49:27] and legs
[49:29] and with pertinence thereof. And you
[49:31] shall let nothing of it remain until the
[49:33] morning. And that which remained of it
[49:35] until the morning, you shall burn with
[49:37] fire.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Thus shall you eat it with your loins
[49:40] good, your shoes on your feet, and your
[49:42] staff in your hand. What is it? Ready to
[49:45] move out.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Shoes on your feet, loins good, staff in
[49:50] your hand. And you shall eat it in
[49:51] haste.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; The message is urgent.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Soon cometh the body change. Eat
[49:57] the word with haste.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Prepare with haste.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; For soon cometh our king.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:08] It is the Lord's Passover. For I will
[50:10] pass through the land of Egypt this
[50:11] night and smite all the firstborn in the
[50:13] land, both man and beast. And against
[50:16] all the gods of Egypt, I will execute
[50:18] judgment. I am the Lord and the blood
[50:20] shall be to you for a token upon the
[50:22] houses where you are and when I see the
[50:25] blood
[50:27] &gt;&gt; I will pass over you.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the plague shall not be upon
[50:31] you to destroy you when I smite the land
[50:34] of Egypt. Amen. Hallelujah. So what we
[50:38] are trying to establish there where the
[50:40] blood was applied was very important.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; And right now we know the prophet
[50:44] teaches us. Amen. This is one of the
[50:45] mysteries. Amen. that it wasn't just the
[50:47] literal blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[50:49] but the life that was in the blood has
[50:51] come upon the believer. And because the
[50:53] life has come upon the believer, when
[50:55] the death angel is coming now through
[50:57] the latest and age, amen, he's going to
[50:59] pass over you.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Because the life of Christ is found in
[51:03] you.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[51:06] &gt;&gt; now if we start practicing the message,
[51:08] we're going to find the results follow.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; If people are saying there's nothing
[51:13] happening the message, we can't see any.
[51:14] No, you are not practicing the word of
[51:16] God.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; This message is a powerful word. Amen.
[51:19] This is a third power in this message.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Power to create the spoken word. Power.
[51:24] Amen. Hallelujah. To change things.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; He says now many people just call it the
[51:31] word. The word is right. But the signs
[51:34] follow the word.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Paul said the gospel came to us
[51:38] something like this. Not only in word
[51:40] only, but through the power and
[51:41] demonstration of the Holy Spirit. I ask
[51:44] you to challenge ministers in this hour.
[51:45] Tell them, don't only give me the word
[51:47] only, but show me the word in power and
[51:49] show me the word in demonstration. Let
[51:51] me see the God that you serve. Are you
[51:54] just a parrot repeating things? Or do
[51:56] you know this God that you're talking
[51:57] about? Have you had a backside
[51:59] experience? Amen. Experience in the
[52:02] backside of the desert. Do you know this
[52:04] God?
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Bring the trouble.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Bring the blind.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Bring the sick. And let's see the power
[52:11] of the gospel.
[52:13] Yes.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have a mult showdown. Let's
[52:17] root out all unbelief in the message.
[52:19] Amen. Hiding behind quotes. Hiding
[52:21] behind religion. Hiding behind the
[52:23] church. Let's see God on display. Let's
[52:25] see Hebrews 38 again.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Free to operate the word.
[52:31] People have many skills. Amen. People
[52:33] are free to the word.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; People have faith to intellectually
[52:36] represent the word.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But free to operate the word. can
[52:41] say I didn't come with word only but I
[52:44] came with power and I came with
[52:45] demonstration. Amen. The Holy Ghost is
[52:48] here this morning to bring power to
[52:50] bring demonstration.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Now to prove that's what he was speaking
[52:57] of. Listen. Amen. Now he's quoting Mark
[53:00] 16. These signs shall follow them that
[53:02] believe.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; So it takes beyond believing.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Signs must follow the believer.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Otherwise, quit saying
[53:11] that you believe. You are bringing a
[53:13] reproach to the gospel. If signs don't
[53:15] follow you, approach to the gospel.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; You got to fake unbelief.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Watch. In my name, they action. Now, you
[53:26] must go into action. You must apply.
[53:28] They shall cast out devils.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Not just believing cast out devils.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody must go there. That's right.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; A son of God who has authority on the
[53:40] earth. Do you know you control
[53:42] atmospheres? You control. You control
[53:45] the atmosphere of the earth. No demon
[53:47] power want to be able to overpower you
[53:49] because you're a son and daughter of God
[53:51] on the earth right now. You are to take
[53:53] control of principalities of powers of
[53:56] every demon spirit. Amen. And speak to
[53:58] it.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[54:02] the Lord.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; They shall cast out devils. They shall
[54:05] speak with new tongues. They shall take
[54:07] up serpents. All of these things require
[54:09] something that you do as a believer.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; They shall drink any deadly thing. It
[54:14] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[54:16] hands on the sick and they shall
[54:19] recover.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Free to apply the word. Don't be
[54:23] scared to apply the word. Amen. It's
[54:25] God's word. God has to back up his own
[54:27] word. You are just a believer in the
[54:29] word who needs to apply the word.
[54:32] Somebody give God praise. Amen.
[54:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God says, "But God
[54:40] never place signs ahead of the word."
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Signs follow the word.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not a bunch of signing
[54:47] people that just go looking for signs.
[54:49] No, we have established ourself in the
[54:51] word. We stand on the word. Amen. On
[54:54] Christ's solid rock, I stand. All other
[54:57] ground is sinking sand. So signs must
[54:59] follow the word. As when Elijah told the
[55:02] woman to bake the cake first, according
[55:04] to the word of the Lord. Now when she
[55:06] did as the word said, the proper sign
[55:09] came.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come to the word first, then
[55:14] watch the miracle.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Come to the word first, then watch your
[55:18] situation change.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Come Amen. Examine the word.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come to the word first.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Then watch the miracle in your life.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come to the word first.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; The seed word is energized by the
[55:34] spirit.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; That is as good as saying the dynamics
[55:38] are coming upon the mechanics.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; The seed word is energized by the
[55:42] spirit.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we've got to change our
[55:46] confession.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Sometimes there's too much negative
[55:49] talk. Amen. Nothing good will ever
[55:51] happen. Amen. Nothing good ever happens
[55:52] to me. Amen. I am sick. I am depressed.
[55:55] I am Amen. poor. I am down and out.
[55:58] Amen. Amen. Stop. Change your
[56:00] confession.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Change the way you speak over your
[56:03] situation.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Matthew 7, Amen. Ask and
[56:09] you shall receive.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; If you keep asking negativity, that's
[56:12] all you'll receive. Negativity back.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Seek and you shall find. Some of you are
[56:19] only seeking negative things.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Some of you are seeking counsel from
[56:22] unbelievers.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Where are you getting counsel from? Some
[56:25] people's counselors are
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Tik Tok.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Some people's counsel are Dr. Google.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Since when did God place Tik Tok
[56:35] and Google above his word?
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Show me where you're getting your
[56:38] counsel from.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Show me where you're getting the word
[56:41] from. Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Change your confession.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, how come how come Lord we are not I
[56:50] don't have the faith to apply the word.
[56:52] Well, what are you feeding on day and
[56:53] night?
[56:55] You've got a diet.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know they are they are vitamin
[56:58] deficient uh food?
[57:02] &gt;&gt; There are certain foods that have no
[57:04] vitamins in it.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; It's no good for your body.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; It's called junk food.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; So how can you be feeding on a diet of
[57:10] Instagram, Facebook,
[57:12] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Tik Tok
[57:14] &gt;&gt; uh X
[57:16] &gt;&gt; and saying the word is not changing me.
[57:19] No, you are being changed into their
[57:20] image
[57:21] &gt;&gt; because that's what you are feeding on.
[57:23] You are being changed into a worldly
[57:25] image
[57:28] &gt;&gt; because what you feed on that's what
[57:30] you're becoming.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Change your confession.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; You only live as high as your
[57:41] confession.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Change your confession. If you are sick,
[57:48] never confess that you are sick.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[57:51] &gt;&gt; thank you. Thank you, Jesus.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Lucky I didn't wear gloves this morning.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; If you are sick, change your confession.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet told John Ryan, "Go on your
[58:03] way believing
[58:05] &gt;&gt; and keep confessing.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed."
[58:09] &gt;&gt; You know, he came back the next day or
[58:11] so and he said nothing happened. The
[58:13] prophet rebuked him.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; He says, "The vision never lies."
[58:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't care how long it
[58:18] takes. You keep confessing, praise God,
[58:20] I'm healed. Praise God I'm healed.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; This man had a paper business. Amen.
[58:24] That he was selling newspaper and he
[58:26] should go around saying extra extra read
[58:28] all about it. Praise God I'm healed.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God I'm healed.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we may confess it. Now
[58:38] we're getting energized in the service.
[58:39] Yes, my faith is being built up. I'll go
[58:41] out confessing today, but tomorrow comes
[58:44] we change our confession.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; It's not that you got walked up in the
[58:49] service. No, you are changing your
[58:51] belief.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Satan is coming now to pluck out that
[58:54] word. You have got to apply scripture.
[58:56] Jesus said the devil will come now to
[58:59] try and pluck out that word from your
[59:00] soul that's been planted there.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; So the next day you're going to come
[59:03] across worse symptoms. The next day
[59:05] you're going to receive even worse
[59:06] symptoms. Even worse news. Amen. You're
[59:09] going to receive worse news than before.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; You're going to get threatened on your
[59:12] job. You're going to be told this, that,
[59:14] and the other. But God wants to see your
[59:16] faith.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing the fire did to the
[59:19] three Hebrew boys was loose the bands.
[59:22] So trials come your way to loose the
[59:24] bands of unbelief.
[59:26] [Music]
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; You live as high as your confession.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Always negative.
[59:35] Always speaking negative.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Always speaking,
[59:39] I don't know where I'm going to get my
[59:40] next meal. Well, you should know where
[59:42] you're going to get your next meal
[59:43] because God is your source. God is your
[59:46] provider. Amen. I don't know where
[59:48] business is going to come from. But if
[59:49] you are depending on business to come
[59:51] from your own amen strength, you are not
[59:53] going to get it's only a certain level.
[59:55] But if you are depending on God is the
[59:57] head of this business and God is my
[59:59] source and God is aba and I'm believing
[1:00:02] on him. I don't care what the situation
[1:00:04] looks like right now. My bank balance
[1:00:06] maybe is 0 0. Amen. But I want you to
[1:00:09] put a digit in front of it and don't put
[1:00:12] a digit of zero in front of it. start to
[1:00:14] put a one or start to put a two or start
[1:00:16] to put a three or how much you can
[1:00:18] imagine to see there and start to work
[1:00:21] and believe that God is able to bring it
[1:00:23] to pass.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you think I'm lying. The Lord said
[1:00:27] if Etsy right and asked for a million
[1:00:29] dollars, the Lord would have given her a
[1:00:31] million dollars. Don't ask me where it
[1:00:33] would have come from, but a million
[1:00:35] dollars would have been there in that
[1:00:36] home that day. I say he's the same
[1:00:38] yesterday. I say he's the same today. I
[1:00:40] say he's the same forever. Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; What we need to take is shake our feet a
[1:00:46] little bit and get rid of some unbelief
[1:00:47] here.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We put the limits of God on God.
[1:00:51] We put limits on God. We say it's not
[1:00:53] possible. But God's word says all things
[1:00:56] are possible to believe.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Seeing a dead church, seeing a a
[1:01:04] lukewarm church. Amen. Because people
[1:01:05] don't afraid to apply the word.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:01:10] Seeing a stiff neck, we believe the
[1:01:12] word, brother. We have the opening of
[1:01:14] the word. One opening you got.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; The only opening you got is here in your
[1:01:18] mouth. You yap yap the whole day.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Can't see any evidence of what you
[1:01:24] believe.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; They ask you for evidence. You're going
[1:01:27] back to the 60s to bring forth a miracle
[1:01:29] and a sign and a wonder.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; What happened to you?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; You think Christ died when brother
[1:01:33] Brandon went to the grave.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm challenging you now.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; You say you are message believers. You
[1:01:41] say brother Brandon was the first wave
[1:01:42] shift. What about you? If he was the
[1:01:44] first wave shift, which means many
[1:01:46] others are following. Amen. What
[1:01:48] happened to you? What happened to your
[1:01:50] faith? What happened to you? Amen. The
[1:01:52] gospel has only gotten higher and higher
[1:01:54] and higher.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; So where are we supposed to be?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; The problem is we got choked by worldly
[1:02:02] desires. We got choked by the job. We
[1:02:04] got choked Amen. by circumstance.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, sir.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; You live as high as your confession.
[1:02:11] Joel 3:10 says, "Let the weak say, I am
[1:02:14] strong."
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Change your confession.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Even if you're feeling weak, what is he
[1:02:19] saying?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I am strong.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with you? Even in a hand,
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; what's wrong with your hand?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; We're not applying scripture. Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Hey, give me sugar water. I'm feeling so
[1:02:37] weak.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, "Bring me sugar
[1:02:40] water."
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; What is the weak supposed to say?
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; I am strong.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; I am strong.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Let the poor say, "I am."
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Let the blind say, "I can
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; see."
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Let the unemployed say, "I am."

[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Don't limit yourself.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; We put limits on ourselves.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's nothing wrong with
[1:03:13] with progressing in life?
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; As long as your heart doesn't turn away
[1:03:18] from God.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; The problem with Solomon, he asked for
[1:03:22] wisdom,
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; but God blessed him in material things,
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; but he didn't stay there. His heart
[1:03:29] turned away from the Lord. Yeah.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; God will bless you.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; God will bless you in your finances. God
[1:03:35] will bless you. Amen. Whatever your
[1:03:37] desires are if you can apply your mind
[1:03:39] and walk towards it.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; It's not going to fall from heaven.
[1:03:42] God's going to use you to bring it to
[1:03:44] pass.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's going to use you. So don't
[1:03:50] limit yourself.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Don't limit yourself and say, "I believe
[1:03:57] this message." Live the message.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Don't stop at saying, "I believe." Amen.
[1:04:03] But put into practice.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Apply the word daily. Apply the word
[1:04:07] every hour. Apply the word every minute.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Some of you, the reason why your
[1:04:12] friends, your your family, and your
[1:04:14] maybe you're calling somebody can't see
[1:04:16] any difference in you because you live
[1:04:17] like a devil.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; The only spiritual thing you tell them
[1:04:22] come to church.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; That's the most spiritual thing you can
[1:04:26] say. They don't see you reading your
[1:04:29] Bible. Right?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; They don't see you praying.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Yes.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; They don't see you as a believer who is
[1:04:35] fervent in the house of the Lord. I'll
[1:04:37] forsake every other thing, but I must be
[1:04:38] in the house of the Lord.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; No, we'll go out. Uh some people's
[1:04:43] weekend starts on Thursday.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Friday, they'll go out. Saturday,
[1:04:49] they'll go out. Sunday, I'm tired now.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Demon powers whispering in your ear.
[1:04:58] Yeah.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now they play international soccer
[1:05:02] matches all different times. Some people
[1:05:04] can burn the midnight oil
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; to watch a soccer match.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; We have all night prayer meeting here.
[1:05:10] You know,
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; can't make it.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I can't make it.
[1:05:17] Amen.
[1:05:19] Is your life worthy of the gospel?
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Is your life worthy of this gospel?
[1:05:26] Amen.
[1:05:28] Do you know even
[1:05:30] governments
[1:05:32] they call it military exercises,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; military applications?
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; They develop a new warhead.
[1:05:42] They want to test it.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Do you know that the Ukraine war
[1:05:45] provided opportunity for the US and all
[1:05:47] of these other countries to to test
[1:05:49] their
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; the bombs, to test their missiles, to
[1:05:54] test their guns?
[1:05:57] And even in the time of no war, they go
[1:05:59] out into the ocean and they call it
[1:06:02] military exercises.
[1:06:04] War. Amen.
[1:06:07] What do they call it, brother Josh?
[1:06:11] Where they replicate a war scene.
[1:06:14] Amen. They go out there and they test
[1:06:16] their bombs.
[1:06:18] Do you know for the first time if you
[1:06:20] watch when the Russian president came to
[1:06:22] the US
[1:06:24] you watched there was a parade
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; and the US pro uh president made that f
[1:06:31] that stealth yeah that F3 I don't know
[1:06:33] what bomber it's called to fly over and
[1:06:36] you can see even Putin was trying to
[1:06:37] peek at it
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; because only the US has that
[1:06:43] that bomber.
[1:06:45] Amen. You know what that bomber does?
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; That bomber can go into territories
[1:06:52] undetected.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; No radar can detect it.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; That's what they did recently.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; They went in, they bombed, and they came
[1:07:02] out.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; What I'm describing is your prayer.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Your prayer infiltrates places
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; that you can't even get into.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; It goes undetected by the enemy.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And it brings your lost loved
[1:07:15] one back.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; It brings your job back.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; It brings whatever you're praying for
[1:07:21] back.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Prayer shakes heaven and earth.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know prayer is so powerful? It
[1:07:28] can change the mind of God.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's Hezekiah as an example.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; There's Nineveh as an example.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; There's Aab as an example.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; They all walked softly before the Lord.
[1:07:41] They changed. They repented. And God in
[1:07:44] his longsuffering,
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; he said, "I won't bring judgment in your
[1:07:47] time. I'll bring it upon the next
[1:07:48] nation."
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Prayer can change things.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; so so even military exercises, they they
[1:07:56] have military application. Every product
[1:07:59] must go through testing,
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; a period of testing and development
[1:08:04] phase before it can be sold to the
[1:08:05] public. Why? Because the manufacturer,
[1:08:08] they're not concerned so much about you.
[1:08:10] They want to have a product that they
[1:08:12] can have confidence in.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; The manufacturer wants to produce a
[1:08:18] product that will be able to sustain
[1:08:20] itself.
[1:08:22] They're not going to get a whole lot of
[1:08:23] comebacks all the time
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; and they're going to get buyer
[1:08:26] confidence in this product.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the manufacturer
[1:08:31] wants to have confidence in its product.
[1:08:33] So what it does now to attract you as a
[1:08:35] buyer, they attach a warranty or a
[1:08:38] guarantee to their product.
[1:08:41] And the warranty and guarantee is
[1:08:43] showing us that the manufacturer has
[1:08:45] confidence towards its own product. And
[1:08:47] the warranty is there to protect the
[1:08:49] reputation of the manufacturer.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; It's there to protect the reputation of
[1:08:59] the manufacturer.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Because rather than you go on broadcast
[1:09:03] that this is a bad product, they tell
[1:09:05] you within 6 months or a year, bring it
[1:09:07] back to us. We'll repay it for free.
[1:09:10] Don't put it out there in the public.
[1:09:12] You and I, we can sort this out.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Some Christians are like that. The
[1:09:19] prophet says, "Science tell you to go
[1:09:22] take this pill. It doesn't work." Do you
[1:09:24] know there are many doctors who
[1:09:25] misdiagnose?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; They treat you for stuff you don't even
[1:09:28] have.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; He says they give you the wrong pill.
[1:09:31] You take that pill. After 6 months, the
[1:09:33] doctor says, "You know what? We
[1:09:34] misdiagnosed you."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; I was just reading. Amen. There was a
[1:09:37] story of this woman that that do they
[1:09:39] misdiagnosed her having cancer, put her
[1:09:41] through chemotherapy and all of these
[1:09:43] things only to find out years later she
[1:09:46] never had cancer.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Medical malpractice.
[1:09:52] And people don't lose confidence in
[1:09:53] science. They go back to another doctor.
[1:09:56] They say, "Can I have a second opinion?"
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to the word of God,
[1:10:00] you apply the word, nothing happens.
[1:10:01] People lose confidence. Ah, nothing
[1:10:03] happened. Brother Brandham says, "If the
[1:10:05] Lord told me to go pray for the sick,"
[1:10:07] and he says, "If that person died,"
[1:10:10] he says, "I'll go back the next morning
[1:10:12] preaching that Jesus Christ still heals
[1:10:14] a sick."
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't lose confidence in the word
[1:10:20] of God.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Just because you had a bad experience in
[1:10:23] life or a bad situation happened, you
[1:10:25] shouldn't lose confidence in the word of
[1:10:27] God because the word of God is a sure
[1:10:29] foundation. The word of God can get you
[1:10:31] out of any situation. The word of God
[1:10:33] can get you out of depression, out of
[1:10:35] trauma, out of any situation that you've
[1:10:37] been in.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ, Amen. Just like a
[1:10:43] manufacturer gives us a guarantee and a
[1:10:45] warranty. Amen. Jesus Christ also gives
[1:10:48] us a guarantee in his word.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he also has confidence in his
[1:10:53] word. Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; He says if you believe his word and
[1:10:56] apply it by faith, he guarantees you in
[1:10:58] Mark 9:23 that all things are possible
[1:11:02] to them that believe. That's the
[1:11:04] manufacturer of your own body.
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; That is the greatest manufacturer.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He says if you can believe
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; all things are possible. I'm giving you
[1:11:16] this guarantee.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:24] You know the angel of the Lord told the
[1:11:25] prophet, "If you get the people to
[1:11:27] believe you,
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; not even cancer,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; not even cancer will stand in your way.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; That's a guarantee."
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; That's a guarantee.
[1:11:41] Even if you if you have faith to believe
[1:11:44] me, he says, "Not even cancer will be
[1:11:46] able to stand in your way."
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; So what is your situation? What is your
[1:11:50] problem? If you believe, nothing shall
[1:11:53] stand in your way.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; The word of God will defeat Satan
[1:11:59] anytime, anywhere, any place, in every
[1:12:02] circumstance.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Now, do you know that this year?
[1:12:07] Amen.
[1:12:10] This, how many of you know what this is?
[1:12:14] What is this?
[1:12:17] Nobody knows what this is.
[1:12:21] This is a prison phone.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; I'm just using another word for it.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:29] It's called a cell phone, but it holds
[1:12:31] you prisoner.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Can hold you prisoner for hours. Some of
[1:12:41] you don't like to be in prison.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Some of you never like detention. 1 hour
[1:12:46] detention. Now this thing puts you in
[1:12:48] detention.
[1:12:49] You will sit and you will look at me and
[1:12:53] you will scroll.
[1:12:55] 1 hour gone,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; 2 hours gone.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Then they knock you on the door in the
[1:13:00] toilet. Come out.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Prison phone.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Now, do you know that this phone in
[1:13:15] order for it to work, it needs
[1:13:19] applications?
[1:13:21] If I took out all the applications from
[1:13:23] your phone,
[1:13:25] your phone will be useless.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; What you going to do with it? Make phone
[1:13:30] calls.
[1:13:33] Hello.
[1:13:35] People very shy. They act like they
[1:13:36] don't have phones. They got their head
[1:13:37] down now. We don't know what you're
[1:13:38] talking about.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing a point to you.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Without applications,
[1:13:47] this phone becomes useless.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Even the manufacturer puts an operating
[1:13:53] software in here
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; in order for you to start to download
[1:13:56] applications.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:14:02] So without the operating software, your
[1:14:04] phone is useless and applications and
[1:14:07] software needs to be updated all the
[1:14:09] time.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In order to keep up
[1:14:13] with the latest version, why latest
[1:14:16] version? Your phone won't run at optimal
[1:14:18] levels? Because the software and the
[1:14:21] application is always receiving upgrades
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; to fix bugs,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; to fix problems.
[1:14:28] Now, if you got an outdated version,
[1:14:31] your problem won't be fixed.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; You can have the latest phone, but an
[1:14:40] old application.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing a point with this.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You can have the latest phone. You can
[1:14:48] be living in 2025 with Luther's message.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Updated version.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; App has been upgraded. It'll tell you,
[1:14:57] "Please update your app."
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Do you want to update your app or
[1:15:00] continue using it? The Lutherans press
[1:15:04] continue using.
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Same thing with the Wesians.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Do you want to update the app? Continue
[1:15:13] using.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostals.
[1:15:17] Do you want to update the app? No.
[1:15:19] Continue using.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; So, they have all kinds of bugs.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And errors in their doctrine. Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Because they haven't updated to the
[1:15:28] latest version.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; The update fixes bugs and issu and
[1:15:34] problems. Amen. The previous versions
[1:15:35] may have had. The update also
[1:15:39] introduces new features.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; If you go look at the first version of
[1:15:43] uh WhatsApp, it didn't have so much of
[1:15:46] features like you have now.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; So the update also provides new features
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; and new functions. They are always
[1:15:55] improving on the applications.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying stay up to date.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Even with what the spirit is doing, stay
[1:16:04] up to date with what the spirit is
[1:16:06] saying to the church.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even as you heard last week and
[1:16:09] even our brother Sunonny was confirming.
[1:16:11] Amen. After the service, the things that
[1:16:13] they knew and understood back when they
[1:16:15] first came in the message, the
[1:16:17] revelation has progressed.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; So what happens if we stay with just the
[1:16:21] revelation they had back then in the
[1:16:23] 80s? in the '90s, we'll be having an
[1:16:26] outdated version.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; But we need to come now into 2025 where
[1:16:30] God is opening up his word even more
[1:16:32] clearly so that we can have the latest
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; download from the mind of Christ.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Stay up to date. Amen. Hallelujah. We
[1:16:42] have had the revealing of the word, but
[1:16:44] now is not the time of the revealing of
[1:16:45] the word. You can't tell me we're living
[1:16:47] in the time when the word is being
[1:16:48] revealed. The word has already been
[1:16:50] revealed. Now is the time and season
[1:16:52] where we are manifesting the word.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Living out our part of the word.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I ask you if Moses was the
[1:16:59] promised word of his day and Noah was
[1:17:01] the promised word of his day and Enoch
[1:17:04] was the promised word of his day. Elijah
[1:17:06] was the promised word of his day and I
[1:17:08] can take you through Paul, Arinius,
[1:17:10] Martin, Columbus, Luther, Wesley and
[1:17:12] Brandham was the promised word of their
[1:17:14] day. I ask you where is the promised
[1:17:17] word of this day? Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, who is the promised word
[1:17:21] of today?
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Show me the promised word of today.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; I want to see the promised word of
[1:17:26] today. And you can't show me a book. The
[1:17:28] Amen. The promised word was always
[1:17:31] revealed in a person of Paul. Was always
[1:17:33] revealed in the person of Ireneius. Was
[1:17:35] revealed in the person of Brandham. Show
[1:17:37] me the promised word of today made flesh
[1:17:40] in you.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; let's put up the next word, brother.
[1:17:45] Amen. Hear what he says. God stands on
[1:17:48] the promised word of for each new year.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; This is not 2024.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; This is 2025.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; God stands on the promised word for each
[1:18:00] new year. He stands on it this year.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; To fulfill what he has got promised for
[1:18:07] this year.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Come on people of God. God has promises
[1:18:11] for you for this year, but you are still
[1:18:13] trying to mine yesterday's promises.
[1:18:18] Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Are we reading this? Do we believe this
[1:18:21] is shalom 1964? He's saying God stands
[1:18:24] on the promised word for each new year.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; He stands on it. So my expectation for
[1:18:29] 26 is far greater than what for 2025 if
[1:18:32] the Lord carries.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, I want to be right in
[1:18:40] the center of his will in the future
[1:18:42] like David. So for 2026, I want to be
[1:18:45] right in the center of his will. Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Christ living in you.
[1:18:52] Watch now how the prophet brings us
[1:18:55] makes him the center of your life.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] And the key to understanding God's
[1:19:08] revelation, the Bible reveals Christ.
[1:19:11] And when Christ lives in you, your life
[1:19:13] becomes the full expression of God's
[1:19:14] purpose. Yes.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know it was Christ in Moses?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; What made Moses the Christ?
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; It was God in him.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; What made Brandham the Christ? God in
[1:19:27] him.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Now, wherever Christ is, wherever the
[1:19:31] anointing is,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; that becomes the central theme.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham is trying
[1:19:37] to say in Christ the mystery. We become
[1:19:39] the central theme.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:45] Let's just go to the next one there,
[1:19:46] brother. Where the quote is Christ the
[1:19:47] mystery of God revealed 233 there.
[1:19:50] Listen to what he's saying now. Christ
[1:19:52] in you makes him the center of life of
[1:19:56] the revelation. Christ lives in you
[1:19:58] makes him the center of the revelation.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Christ, now watch what
[1:20:05] he's saying. Christ in the Bible makes
[1:20:07] the Bible the complete revelation of
[1:20:09] Christ. So wherever Christ is being
[1:20:11] revealed, that becomes a central theme.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Everyone catching this. I'm going to
[1:20:17] close now.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; In the next 1 hour,
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; everyone catching this.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Wherever Christ is, it becomes the
[1:20:25] central theme.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Moses was a central theme for his day.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Noah was a central theme for his day.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; So I'm asking you, where is Christ in
[1:20:34] this day?
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Because wherever Christ is, that becomes
[1:20:37] the central theme. Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; And he's saying Christ in you makes you
[1:20:41] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:20:44] thing. See what God is trying to do.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; So when when you're reading Revelation
[1:20:49] 10:7, the mystery of God being revealed,
[1:20:52] Christ is revealing you because Christ
[1:20:54] is in you. You become the central theme
[1:20:57] of the revelation now.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you know that
[1:21:02] redemption's plan can't move forward
[1:21:04] without you?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. Redemption's plan
[1:21:08] can't move forward without you.
[1:21:09] Everything in heaven and earth is
[1:21:11] depending upon you.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We in the body of Christ also have
[1:21:15] an operating software. It's Amen. It's
[1:21:17] God's operating software. It's called
[1:21:19] the blessed Holy Spirit. Amen. The Holy
[1:21:22] Ghost was sent to keep our app always
[1:21:24] updated.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; He says, Amen. We can read a few, amen,
[1:21:27] of these scriptures. The comforter,
[1:21:29] which is the Holy Ghost, of whom the
[1:21:31] father will send in my name. He shall
[1:21:32] teach you all things, bring all things
[1:21:34] to your remembrance. Whatsoever I have
[1:21:36] said unto you, peace I leave with you.
[1:21:39] My peace I give to you. Oh, people are
[1:21:42] are troubled in their mind. But Jesus
[1:21:44] said, I'm leaving peace with you back
[1:21:45] then. And peace has never left the
[1:21:47] earth. Amen. For the believer, whoever
[1:21:49] is in Christ remains in peace. Whoever
[1:21:51] is in Christ remains in shalom. So you
[1:21:54] can't tell me that you are troubled. You
[1:21:55] are depressed. Which means you got out
[1:21:57] of Christ. Jesus is saying peace I leave
[1:22:00] with you.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus never took peace from the lives of
[1:22:04] the believer.
[1:22:06] Some people are saying I have no peace
[1:22:07] in my life. Then you left Jesus.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Call Jesus back into your life because
[1:22:12] Jesus is saying peace I leave with you.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Not as the world giveth. The world gives
[1:22:22] but it wants to take it back. He's
[1:22:24] saying no. Let not your heart be
[1:22:26] troubled neither let it be afraid. Amen.
[1:22:28] John 16. I'm just trying to read the
[1:22:30] scriptures to show you the app that came
[1:22:32] for you. The Holy Ghost. Nevertheless, I
[1:22:35] tell you the truth. It is expedient for
[1:22:37] you that I go away. For if I go not
[1:22:39] away, the comforter will not come unto
[1:22:41] you. But if I depart, I will send him
[1:22:43] unto you.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; And when he is come, he watch what the
[1:22:51] Holy Ghost app is going to do now. He
[1:22:52] will rebuke of the world of sin, of
[1:22:54] righteousness and of judgment. Of sin
[1:22:56] because they believe not on me. Of
[1:22:59] righteousness because I go to my father
[1:23:00] and you see me no more. of judgment
[1:23:03] because the prince of this world is
[1:23:04] judged. I have yet many things to say to
[1:23:06] you, but you cannot bear them now. How
[1:23:09] be it, when the Spirit of truth is come,
[1:23:11] he will guide you into all truth.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; He shall not speak of himself, but
[1:23:15] whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he
[1:23:18] speak, and he will show you of things to
[1:23:21] come. He shall glorify me, for he shall
[1:23:23] receive of mine and show it unto you.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to another scripture in
[1:23:28] Acts 18. When this app is coming, when
[1:23:30] this Holy Ghost application is coming,
[1:23:33] you shall receive power.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is bringing power after
[1:23:37] the Holy Ghost has come upon you.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 1:13. In whom you also
[1:23:42] trusted after you heard the word of
[1:23:44] truth, the gospel of your salvation. In
[1:23:46] whom also after you believed, you were
[1:23:48] sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:23:53] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:23:55] possession and to the praise of his
[1:23:57] glory.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. What else can this app do,
[1:24:00] brother? What else can this Holy Ghost
[1:24:01] do for me? Romans 8:1. Amen. Now, it
[1:24:04] says there is therefore now no
[1:24:06] condemnation. You know what that means?
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; It means the case is dismissed.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; It means the judges are dropped. Amen.
[1:24:13] Hallelujah. The the judge is throwing
[1:24:15] this case out of court. He's saying
[1:24:16] there's now no more condemnation. You
[1:24:19] prosecutor who's bringing an Amen. who's
[1:24:21] bringing an accusation. Your case is
[1:24:23] null and void.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We have examined your
[1:24:28] evidence.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And there's no condemnation
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; to them which are in Christ Jesus,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh, but after
[1:24:36] this application called the spirit.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Verse four, for as many as are led by
[1:24:44] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[1:24:47] God. You have not received the spirit of
[1:24:48] bondage again to fear, but you have
[1:24:50] received the spirit of adoption. So this
[1:24:52] application also brings me to adoption.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Whereby you cry aba father,
[1:24:57] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:24:59] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:25:02] God.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; And if you are children and ears of God,
[1:25:05] joints with Christ, he so be that you
[1:25:07] suffer with him, you also may be
[1:25:09] glorified together.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did the Holy Ghost come to
[1:25:14] do? To make us sons and daughters of God
[1:25:16] again.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are to recognize who we are.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to speak what we
[1:25:21] believe.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. The word didn't come in this
[1:25:24] hour to make us mute. The word came that
[1:25:27] spoken word is the original seed and the
[1:25:29] spoken word must come out of your mouth.
[1:25:31] Put up Romans 4:17 there. As it is
[1:25:34] written, I have made thee a father of
[1:25:36] many nations before him who believed.
[1:25:39] Even God, watch how God speaks now. Who
[1:25:41] quicken the dead and call those things
[1:25:43] which were not, which be not as though
[1:25:45] they were. Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; If God spoke that way, calling those
[1:25:49] things which are not as though they
[1:25:51] were, the ones that are created in his
[1:25:53] image and likeness must speak the same
[1:25:55] way. Must speak those things which are
[1:25:57] not as though they were. I don't care if
[1:25:59] your son or daughter is as sick as sick
[1:26:01] can be. You speak it as though they are
[1:26:04] already healed. Amen. Hallelujah. There
[1:26:06] is no sickness, no disease that is not
[1:26:09] covered by the stripes of Jesus. Amen.
[1:26:11] There's no new sickness that can come
[1:26:13] upon the earth that can evade the blood
[1:26:15] of Jesus and the stripes of Jesus. Every
[1:26:18] sickness was paid for.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 10:8. I'm teaching you how
[1:26:24] to speak now. Amen. What say he? The
[1:26:26] word is nye where in the books. No,
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; the word is neither even where in thy
[1:26:32] mouth.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with your mouth? Speak.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And in thy heart.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. That is the word of faith
[1:26:39] which we preach that if you confess with
[1:26:41] thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shall
[1:26:43] believe in thine heart that God had
[1:26:45] raised him from the dead thou shalt be
[1:26:47] saved.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; For with the heart man believeth unto
[1:26:51] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:26:52] confession is made unto salvation. For
[1:26:55] the scripture said whosoever believeth
[1:26:57] on him shall not be ashamed. Proverbs
[1:27:00] 18:21 says death and life are in the
[1:27:03] power of the nose
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; are in the power of the tongue.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people the only power of the
[1:27:10] tongue they have is to taste
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; taste.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Only when they eat eat but taste gone.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Use your tongue for something else.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Use your tongue to speak.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:27:28] Come on church.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Use your tongue to speak.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; We are speaking of faith must be
[1:27:34] applied.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Free to apply the word.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Death and life are in the power of the
[1:27:39] tongue. And watch what it goes on to
[1:27:41] say. They that love it shall eat the
[1:27:43] fruit thereof. Now what in case you love
[1:27:45] death,
[1:27:47] you're going to eat the fruit of death.
[1:27:49] What in case you you love negativity?
[1:27:52] You are going to eat the fruit of
[1:27:53] negativity.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I'm always sick. I'm always depressed.
[1:27:57] I'm always nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
[1:28:01] You're going to eat that fruit.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; But if you love life.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Are you reading the scripture properly?
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; What will you love? Death or life?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; If you are going to love life, you are
[1:28:12] going to eat the fruit of life.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; We all know the scripture Mark 11:23.
[1:28:20] When these disciples see Jesus speak to
[1:28:23] that tree, curse it and it hithered
[1:28:25] away. They wanted to know how did you
[1:28:27] speak to that tree? How come you are
[1:28:29] operating like Adam operated?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Give us the key. Jesus tells them the
[1:28:34] key now. Whosoever shall say to this
[1:28:36] mountain, are you going to pray in that
[1:28:38] time?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That's not your time to pray.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; That's the time for you to stand there
[1:28:45] as a son of God. Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; When Joshua with the sun was going down,
[1:28:49] he didn't say, "Hold on, hold on. I'm
[1:28:50] going to have a prayer meeting." You
[1:28:52] already ought to be prayed up, you
[1:28:54] already ought to be on fire for God. So
[1:28:56] when the situation arise, you can stand
[1:28:58] there and say, "Son, stand still and
[1:29:01] moon, you stay there in that valley."
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't have time to pray there.
[1:29:07] The Bible says if you say not if you
[1:29:09] pray
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; if you say to this mountain be thou
[1:29:14] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[1:29:16] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:29:18] shall believe that those things which he
[1:29:20] say shall come to pass he shall have
[1:29:22] whatsoever he saith
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; when Jesus went to James he didn't start
[1:29:27] to pray he said daughter arise so your
[1:29:30] prayer life must already be in place
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; you must already have connection with
[1:29:34] the father amen you must already have
[1:29:36] connection with the divine supernatural
[1:29:38] power of God.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Afraid to apply the word.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not when you arrive in situation.
[1:29:46] Lord, forgive me all my trespass. Lord,
[1:29:48] forgive me, Lord. Lord,
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; what's wrong with you?
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Speak Lord.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; How are we going to operate as sons of
[1:29:56] God if we keep
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] Do you know it paralyzed the prophet's
[1:30:05] faith once?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He told a white lie. He said,
[1:30:09] "Tell them I'm not in." He stepped out
[1:30:11] the house.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; He couldn't pray for the child.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Could he speak then?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you a practical
[1:30:18] example.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; He couldn't pray for the baby.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; He had to go now and pray.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; I'm saying what's happening with sons
[1:30:26] and daughters of God. When we put in a
[1:30:28] situation, Lord, forgive me. Lord Jesus,
[1:30:31] Father, oh, I'm so sorry, Lord, because
[1:30:35] now you know your life is messed up, but
[1:30:38] the situation requires you for to speak.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Speak.
[1:30:44] If you speak with your mouth, be
[1:30:47] removed. Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in your heart.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Believe those things which you said
[1:30:53] coming out of your own mouth. You got to
[1:30:54] believe the words coming out of your
[1:30:55] mouth.
[1:30:58] He shall have whatsoever he said.
[1:31:01] Amen. What you going to do when you're
[1:31:03] diagnosed with a sickness? Are you going
[1:31:04] to curl up in a corner and die?
[1:31:08] Or you going to take God's word and
[1:31:10] apply it?
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; And you're going to say 1 Peter 2:24
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; as Jesus bore my sins on the cross.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; By whose stripes I am healed.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Here what the prophet is saying. He
[1:31:26] says, "You men and women of tomorrow."
[1:31:28] Now, he's preaching this in 65. So, I'll
[1:31:30] say we are the men and women of
[1:31:32] tomorrow.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; He says, "You men and women of tomorrow,
[1:31:35] if there is a tomorrow,
[1:31:38] you will be there in 2025,
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; God is depending on you."
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, "God is depending on
[1:31:45] you."
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:55] He says in the next message, the
[1:31:56] sweetest words in the Bible, father, I
[1:31:58] sanctify myself that I might sanctify
[1:32:00] them. What was he trying to do? Set an
[1:32:03] example.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; So if Jesus sanctified himself for the
[1:32:06] people, we are to sanctify ourselves for
[1:32:08] the people.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. He was sending
[1:32:11] 12 men out with the gospel that would
[1:32:14] conquer the world. He's depending on you
[1:32:16] and I to do it.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:19] If he could sanctify himself like that,
[1:32:21] why ought we to set aside every failure,
[1:32:24] every doubt, and everything else and
[1:32:26] sanctify ourselves? For we are the seed
[1:32:28] of Abraham through him, that we are more
[1:32:30] than conquerors through him. Go into all
[1:32:32] the world and demonstrate the power of
[1:32:34] the resurrection. He's not dead, but
[1:32:36] he's alive, and he's depending on you
[1:32:38] and I to let him work through us to will
[1:32:42] his will.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Remember, devils never die. Devils
[1:32:48] always live but there will be a time
[1:32:50] when devils will have to die. They will
[1:32:52] become totally annihilated. But now they
[1:32:55] are alive. They walk from generation to
[1:32:57] generation upon human beings. Some of
[1:32:59] them in the form of cancer.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Watch. I'm closing with this now. I'm
[1:33:04] going to bring the main point of the
[1:33:05] message. Now is everybody take a deep
[1:33:08] breath. Let oxygen get to your brain.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:33:13] The main point of the message is to show
[1:33:16] you you are the central theme right now.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; You become the most important figure
[1:33:21] right now.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove it with quotes and
[1:33:24] the scriptures.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; They work from generation to generation.
[1:33:28] So demon powers have trouble generation
[1:33:30] to generation in your family. It's time
[1:33:32] for you to stop it.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; They work from generation to generation
[1:33:36] upon human beings. Some of them in the
[1:33:38] form of cancer. Some in the form of
[1:33:40] epilepsy. Some in the form of
[1:33:42] tuberculosis they get into the flesh
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; but seemingly they are powerless until
[1:33:47] they can get into a person.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; This is the point I'm going to drive
[1:33:51] now.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Everything is hinging upon you the
[1:33:54] person.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Demon powers need to get into a person.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; They have to operate through a person
[1:34:04] which brings another thought that the
[1:34:05] Holy Spirit covers the earth.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; But it's almost helpless.
[1:34:11] until it can get into you and me.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; So, who can make the Holy Ghost
[1:34:16] powerless?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; You and I.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost don't have a body to
[1:34:21] tabernacle, the Holy Ghost becomes
[1:34:23] powerless.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Hey, some of you act like you're not
[1:34:26] reading with me here.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying there's a prophet saying
[1:34:29] it.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; He says, "Amen. The Holy Spirit covers
[1:34:33] the earth and he's almost helpless until
[1:34:35] it can get into you and me."
[1:34:37] Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; God is depending on you and I. The Holy
[1:34:41] Spirit, the earth is full of the spirit
[1:34:43] of God, but it's poured out. It cannot
[1:34:46] operate. It cannot operate. The Holy
[1:34:48] Spirit cannot operate until it comes
[1:34:50] into us. We human beings to operate.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; So which means are you trying to tell me
[1:34:58] that the Holy Ghost becomes a
[1:34:59] personified person?
[1:35:07] And devil wants to take us over to
[1:35:09] operate under him. So when he gets a
[1:35:12] mild form, he starts to sin. If you can
[1:35:14] just get a hold him, just a righteous
[1:35:16] man, a good man, and just let him go
[1:35:17] ahead and try to be good like that. If
[1:35:19] you can hold him like that until he's
[1:35:21] dead, that's just what he wants to do.
[1:35:23] He's got him. Because no matter how
[1:35:25] righteous you are, good you are, how
[1:35:26] moral you are, how clean you are, how
[1:35:29] honest you are, you will never get to
[1:35:30] heaven until you are born again.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. So from that quote I want you to
[1:35:34] take two things. Heaven is depending on
[1:35:36] you.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Demon powers are depending on you.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Everyone establish that in their quote.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; So heavens and earth are depending on
[1:35:43] you. Holy Ghost and demon powers are
[1:35:46] depending on you trying to get access to
[1:35:48] you.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Let's read the Bible and see. Maybe
[1:35:52] there's some other people depending upon
[1:35:54] us. Hebrews 14. Amen. Hebrews 11:40.
[1:35:58] God having provided some better thing
[1:36:00] for us that they without us should not
[1:36:03] be made perfect.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Why? What are you talking about now?
[1:36:07] You're putting too much pressure on me.
[1:36:08] Heaven is depending on me. Demon powers
[1:36:10] are depending on me. Even the sleeping
[1:36:12] saints down through seven church angels
[1:36:14] are depending on me.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; He says, you get it? The people who died
[1:36:20] here in here are depending and waiting
[1:36:23] on us. So this church has got to come to
[1:36:25] perfection
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; in order to bring the resurrection and
[1:36:28] there under souls under the altar
[1:36:31] waiting for the church to come to his
[1:36:32] perfection that when Christ does come.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Oh brother
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; I can only see heaven pointing to one
[1:36:41] person.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Demon powers pointing to one person.
[1:36:44] Souls under the altar pointing to one
[1:36:46] person. Amen. Amen. Seven church ages.
[1:36:49] The sleeping saints pointing to one
[1:36:51] people.
[1:36:53] You mean there's more scriptures? Well,
[1:36:55] let's go to Romans 8:19 and see
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; for the unexpectation of the creature
[1:37:00] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[1:37:02] of God.

[1:37:21] until now. For not only they but
[1:37:23] ourselves also even we groaning.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Which have the first fruits of the
[1:37:28] spirit even we ourselves grown within

[1:38:04] To who will you give your life?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; To who will you allow to possess you?

[1:38:59] further than where ministers have taken
[1:39:01] the people in the kingdom.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Science have taken people much higher.
[1:39:05] He says in the realms of science,
[1:39:07] technology,
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; then ministers have taken people in the
[1:39:11] word.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; But I say we change that.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Let's get up into higher places, higher
[1:39:16] dimensions of the Holy Ghost. The Holy
[1:39:19] Ghost is not pouring right now for a

[1:39:22] pouring out for your season of adoption.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. The time of birth is over.

[1:39:43] responsibility?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; What will you do with this amount of
[1:39:46] pressure?
[1:39:48] You know what pressure does? The prophet
[1:39:50] says pressure letting off the pressure.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; You got to get pressurized with the
[1:39:54] things of God.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together and give him
[1:39:56] praise.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise him. Praise him. Praise him.

[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Right now present is the Holy Spirit
[1:40:39] waiting to gain access to your soul. No.
[1:40:42] No. No. You say brother why you said
[1:40:43] soul. This is not the time for the
[1:40:45] spirit to get on your flesh.

[1:40:58] the third pole came to do.

[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; What we waited for
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; to be that tough storm, to be that
[1:50:46] flange, to be that healer point.

[1:52:05] headstone cannot come upon the body
[1:52:08] except you be there as the connecting

[1:52:13] his headship in the church without you
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; being that flange being that needle
