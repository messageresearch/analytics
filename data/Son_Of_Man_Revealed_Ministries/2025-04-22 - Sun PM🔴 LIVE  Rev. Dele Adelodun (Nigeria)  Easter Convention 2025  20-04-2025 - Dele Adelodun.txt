There's a lot of hard work that goes behind the scenes. So we'd like to propose a vote of thanks this afternoon.

To the various pastors and congregations, worship teams of the various churches in Durban, we want to say to you a very very big heartfelt thank you.

They are um they're not in the message of the hour, but they're believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. They didn't realize that it was a service that was being held and they were just a bit sad that they were missing their church service. But what have they human to understand? They were really touched by the meeting to the point that on Friday when the picture of the pyramid was put up, one of the sisters took it down and she went on her phone to basically uh look at the meanings of some of those things. God works in mysterious way. They really assisted us in such a humble way and we truly want to say thank you to them. We know what the prophet says about that.

Granting, Lord, that your presence will abide with us even till we meet again. Thank you, Father. As we quieten down now, may you open your word unto us. Give us something to encourage us. One word from you will make a difference. And that is why we are gathered. These saints have not come to hear me. They have come to hear you through my vessel. I pray one more time that you will speak on to their situation. You will speak to their needs. You will encourage them that they would go be happy people. Hallelujah. Being fulfilled. Thank you because you will do it. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. [Applause] Lord bless you saints. Yeah. Glad to be in your midst. Uh you we shall read the scriptures when you take your seat then I will appreciate you all. Amen. Given that uh uh tonight is the last night we have it you know. Amen. Uh in this form of a garden like this. Amen. Uh till God give us another opportunity again. Amen. All right. John chapter 11. Just a little word of encouragement tonight. Yeah. Just a little encouragement tonight. John chapter 11. I would like to take from verse 18 to 28. Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 fullons off and many of the Jews came to Ma and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother. Then Ma, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him. For Mary sat still in the house. Then said matter unto Jesus, Lord, if thou had been here, my brother had not died. But I know that even now, whatsoever thou will ask of God, God will give him thee. Amen. Jesus said unto her, "Thy brother shall rise again." Amen. Ma said unto him, "I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day." Jesus said unto her, "What you are looking for in the future is the resurrection, he that believeth in me, though he dead, yet shall be. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die, believe that this." How many believe tonight? Amen. Jesus said unto him, "Yeah, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world." And when she had so said, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, "The master is come and call for thee." Hallelujah. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his holy word. Amen. God bless you. You may please be seated. Like to welcome you all one more time to the house of the Lord again tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. And uh I want to thank everyone of you for cooperating with the meeting and uh like I said your coming is an encouragement uh to me. I am not one of those who will say that whether you come or you don't come preach anyhow. Yeah. Maybe there's a circumstance for that but I love to appeal to you to come. It helps me better when you come. So because you came, I am deeply encouraged you made the trip worldwide. So I want to ask that the Lord bless you richly and all the sacrifices that you have made to be here part of this meeting. May the Lord richly reward you. Amen. And I thank you for coming. I pray the Lord will keep you healthy. Amen. Will keep you strong, more importantly serving the Lord all the days of your life. And uh there's a there's a proverb in my country that says if we are related, we shall meet again. And I know we are related. Hallelujah. I may not be a South African, but we have a better God. Hallelujah. That transcend every nationality. Yes. And that is the blood of Jesus Christ. God has given me the privilege to travel a bit around and uh there's no place I've ever been stranded because my family member my family is a very large family. Hallelujah. Amen. Extremely large. I don't know if your family is as large as but I can tell you for free that you are part of that family or not. [Applause] years ago I traveled uh to Dublin and I with some people and they just wanted me to help attend to some matters for them some years ago. So they were my friends but they don't see this light as such. So I will tell them there's no country I will go I will be stranded. They said, "Ah." He said, "What does that mean?" I said, "Because I have family everywhere." So they didn't get it. He said, "You mean you have family all over the world?" I said, "Preaching all over the world." Amen. So when they took me to Dublin in the island after we finished what we came for, I said, "I want to go and see my family members." They said, "You didn't even hear you have family members." I said, "Don't worry. We wait a little while. They will soon come and pick me here. So as we were talking, we're talking they saw a car park. I said, "My family members have arrived." And they came out. They saw white, they saw black. They said, "Oh, do you have mixed? Do you have all your I said all?" So even in the amazing forest, I have family members. Hallelujah. Amaz family members there. So I'm so glad for this family of God and uh I thank you all. So I know we are related and uh because we are family members there will always be a family meeting. Thank you. We are just trying to finish one now. Amen. So as we expect his physical return, I trust to God we shall have more meetings. And may the Lord keep you healthy. May he keep you established. May he keep you settled and happy watching for his return. And uh he will be with you till we meet again. So once again I thank the pastors. I thank uh all the ministers both the immediate organizers and those who supported them uh even closed down their churches and you know all together they here. May the Lord bless you with I want you to know that you made the job very easy for me in my own little way. It was easy for me to glide because you've laid some foundation and I've come to write on your effort. So I want to thank you for the work you are doing for the kingdom and I pray that the Lord rich to bless all of you in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you all. Thank you Lord. It's been a wonderful time. So on behalf of my wife and myself, we say God bless you. So tonight, the Lord placed uh just a little thought in my heart for an encouragement. Amen. Because I want to believe uh uh I've almost gotten through with the service relative to the convention in the morning. So I was just trusting God for a blessing that he placed this thought in my heart and sometimes God has a way of confirming things to me. So as we were sitting uh waiting for our food at the restaurant some while ago uh brother Andrean started speaking. He just started talking to me and we're talking and he went into those things. I said you see. So the thing came back he said you see I'm confirming it to you. So brother Adrien, maybe I'm fishing in your pond again tonight. So I trust that it will be a blessing to you. I want to speak on the power of his presence just for a little while. Amen. Just something to encourage you and I hope it's a blessing to you. So our sin open up tonight in the family that is like every other message believer's family. We have uh this brother called Lazarus and his two sisters. They used to be denomination believers. Just like many of us started from denomination. But even though they were in the denomination, yet they carried the seed of God's election. Amen. Amen. And uh when God's appointed time came, the light of God flashed across their path and it connected with the seat in there. The one I was trying to show you in the morning. Amen. That little bottle and it began to tumble for life and something registered in their heart. They must follow this pastor Jesus. That's right. So they left their old denomination and came to the message of their hour. Just as you have done I I'm bringing it in the way so that you can connect with it. You know why the the prophet told us no Apostle Paul told us that there are many shadows of the Bible that many of us represent or that represented us he told us about the life of Abraham he called it an allegory and allegory means an event happening not for itself but it's happening as a foretell of the future future events. So the entire life of Abraham as powerful as he was was ordinary shadow a shadow of somebody who is sitting here tonight. That is why when the prophet bring the message identification he said prayer becomes easy when we can locate ourselves in the scripture. Is it going well with you? Amen. It said because when you are able to find your identity in the Bible, meaning all the characters of the Bible played out the life of somebody here. So if you are able to locate your identity in the scripture, it will give you faith. Hallelujah. Brother Aram said once you locate your identity, find out the outcome of the life of that identity and it will give you an idea. how you also will end up. Amen. That was the secret that sister that the prophet prophet said, "Let us call her Auntie Jima." How many ever about that? That was the secret of her victory. And I tell you what, she wasn't even a message believer then. But because she understood the principle, she received the key to unlock her blessing. When she was in a very d need, she began to look at the scriptures. What is going on? Who do I relate to? Then she find out that she was the Shunamite woman. She said I is the Shunamite woman. Because the story of that woman look exactly like her story. Somebody will connect with their identity tonight. Yes, it looked exactly like that. He said, "I never had a child for a long time. God eventually gave me a child." As soon as a woman never had a child, God gave her a child. Then as a child was growing, he said maybe it was a son stroke or whatever it is, the child died. He says, "Sin has struck my womb and is also going to die." Hallelujah. He said, but then if I am that Shunamite woman, There must be an Elijah. Hallelujah. [Applause] And you know what she did? She didn't even pray. She only said, "Lord, where is your Elijah?" It's powerful how she located herself in the scripture. Yes. And that gave her faith to trust God for Elijah because she believed that the picture must be well arranged. The picture must be perfect. And God answered the Shunamite woman. And did you remember the Shunite of our time, the substance of the shadow of the scripture, when the Lord answered her, you know what he did? Elijah was traveling. [Music] maybe with very important VIPs who had serious appointments who are going for an appointment, a program, a business meeting or a government meeting, a meeting, a policy making meeting. But all those things never matter to God. That's right. In comparison to a woman who could locate identity in the scripture. Hallelujah. Amen. You know what happened? God just unpluged a knot in the airplane for the sake of that moment and it's still the same God tonight. I don't know what your needs are, but I'm encouraging you tonight. You have no reason to give up on anything. The strength of Israel can never lie. Only believe all things are possible. Yes. When God unplugged a knot in that aeroplane, God guided the part of the aeroplane and it landed right in the city where that woman lived Memphis Tennessee. That is not a coincidence. That was the harm of God. And the spirit moved the prophet to come down and he thought he was going to do postal service. He packed letters to go and post and the Lord told him I didn't get you down here to post letters. Keep moving. Hallelujah. Brother Abraham asked the officials how long will it take to fix the plane? They said 4 hours. He said that's enough time to post my letter. But as he went about posting letter, God said, "Keep moving." And he kept moving, turning the corner, approaching the streets, not knowing where she was, he was going. But the same God that stopped the airplane when to tell the woman, he said, Elijah you asked for his ear. Because God has got to work on both hands. He's still the same God tonight. Hallelujah. Shortly before day break, he gave the woman a dream of the identity of Elijah. Those of you are doubting Elijah, you got to examine yourself. Those of you are doubting the message, you got to examine yourself. These are memorials, stories that will never die. God has already vindicated Elijah before us. You may have your doubts. We don't know your origin. We don't know your destination. But we are certain that God did us a favor by sending brother. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. And Elijah kept going. The woman was so certain that this was of the Lord till she came out and stood by the entrance of my house watching that for Elijah. I don't know how long she waited. But guess what? Elijah approached. [Applause] And as Elijah was coming, the woman looked at her, looked at him. He said, "Yes, it's got a hat on. It's got that black. It's got the color of the thing. This must be the Elijah. Amen. Elijah didn't know where he was coming. That's right. But the woman to whom she was, he was sent knew Elijah was coming. Hallelujah. And as Elijah was passing by, you remember I said good morning person. You are supposed to come here. Brother said when I looked at her, she looked old enough for me to call her auntie. Yes. And I said, "Auntie, how did you know me?" Then she gave her testimony that this was what God told me. I've been waiting here for you to arrive. Thank God you arrive. He will arrive for you. Keep waiting. Those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. A man with wings as an angel. They will run and not be weary. They will walk and never wait. May the Lord teach you and how to wait upon the Lord. Do you know brother Abraham said I still don't understand but he followed inside. And when he got there auntie Jim said you know this is the boy I raised him up in the right way but he took the wrong road and taking the wrong road I caught up with him. He's got some disease that he may not be able to come out of. I only want one thing. I want him to know God in salvation. Even if God is going to take him, what a man's love. If God is not going to spare him, I just want him saved. I want an assurance that he has settled it with God. Your effort can never be in vain. Let me give you a blessing. You are the nearest kinsmen to those children. Your prayers must avail. That's what the prophet said. When you stand in the gap for those children, don't mind whatever they are doing. They are mere symptoms. Those that observe those symptoms are observing lying vages. We don't live by what we see. We live by what we believe. So even if you pray and things are getting worse with them, hold on to the promise of prayer, it will never fail, you never leave to see them come to God. I give you a guarantee they will still come to God because God is banking your prayers. He's banking your prayers at the appointed time. He will bring it to remembrance and they will find their way to the altar. God himself. I've seen many children, many sons, many daughters come to the altar by the honor that God has over the prayers of their mother who have long gone. The heavens of the heavens that God is going to prepare for us. Prophet Isaiah said is so that we and our offsprings will be there. Hallelujah. Glory. Can I offer you extra blessing on that? I'm just feeling good tonight. It's a night of encouragement. Let me offer you extra blessing on that. There was a sister who came to the prayer line. Amen. I can't remember if it's sister Shepherd or sister whatever it is. Amen. She was the last on the prayer line. Amen. And uh when she approached the prophet with the grandchildren, the prophet had a tough feeling of nostalgia to think about how they all started. He looked at that sister, he looked at himself. They all started as young people. Amen. Amen. Building a church, a kingdom for God. Amen. Amen. And seeing you know how life has transformed them. He was telling that sister, he said, "Do you remember how we all started in the beginning?" And he said, "By the grace of God, today our children came into the light and here you are bringing your grandchildren even to be prayed for." He said, "My sister, let me offer you a blessing." He said, "Do you know it is written in the Bible that thou and thy house shall be saved." Yes. Let me tell you more than any age that promise is our inheritance. And the prophet talked and talked and he said, "Sister, let me pray for you." And he started praying for those children. He said, "Oh God, may all that my sister love and may all that love her be given to her." Do you understand that prayer? Did you know it was only to the prophet the angel of the Lord gave that he said all that you love not that ever love you have been given to you. Then brother Brown extended the blessings of that prayer upon a sister in the church to portress what the scripture said thou and thy house shall be saved. [Applause] Sister, are you right? God's salvation of two boys. Is that right? That's the one we remember so much. But do you know by our own testimony, brother El Doubt in God's salvation of my 11 children? It's in the message. Don't look at me. Is there Brother was giving a testimony of that in the church. And brother in the minister of the gospel sat in the corner and he was saying, "Lord, how about my children?" Amen. Yes. And as the service was over, Amen. Brother Brown was leaving and then God told him, he said, "Go back and give Elant his children." And he went back also and said, "Eldant, receive your children." And the next service, a lot of them were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. This is the blessing of the believers. [Applause] Don't give up on them. So the woman auntie Jamaima told the prophet and brother Abraham said I still don't understand. He said but I said auntie you pray first. And when auntie began to pray the prophet said you can tell that she's used to talking to God. She did it with all her heart. Get used to talking to God, my brother. Get used to talking to God, my sister, and do it with all your heart. God will come through for you. Amen. And when she finished, all the prophet did was to endorse our prayer. And you know what happened? The boy started coming back to life. And by the time the prophet looked at his time, it was about that 4 hours. He started running back to the airport and by the time he got to the airport they were making the final call. Mr. William and he was just on time to catch his light because the purpose for which God brought him was accomplished. So locating our identity is very powerful. Yes sir. It will bring you your blessings. So tonight may be an identity of some people I'm talking about Lazarus and the two sisters we are denominational believers I said but when they saw the message of their day it spark life in their hearts you might have been invited here tonight amen I want you to know that you accepting to come is not a coincidence and it's not a chance event has a purpose for So when the Lord talks your heart, make sure you respond. He said, "Do not hard in your heart." Yes. While it is gone today, when these folks came into the light, they were such a dedicated believer that if this is the truth, we will give our all to him. Amen. Friends, they brought Jesus Christ our Lord home. They accommodated the message of the hour. The prophet said the clothes, the garment of Jesus that the soldiers were parting among themselves were pres was presented by that family. That's right. So they fed the message. They clothed the message. They house the message. And those are the things you must do to your ministers if they carry the blessings of God to you. These people sold out to the message. But I tell you friends, amen. The reason Christ will be comfortable to live in their house was because they created the right environment. [Applause] Christ does not live in a place that is anyhow. He doesn't live in the place where there is trust. He live in a place where there is order. Where the brother has taken his position. His wife is in that position. The children are in their position. The own in order will attract the presence of Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. My brother, my sister, you have too much against you than to be against yourself. You will be so much against yourself. If your atmosphere is not conducive for Christ to live in your house, you are finished. Don't worry. Silently gently and we prove it to you tonight. You love him. and Christ living in their house was not a guest. That's right. The prophet said, "Wherever you put Christ is where he's going to stay." He doesn't force or fuse with you. But have a wisdom tonight. When I pray, I say, "Christ, I don't want you to be an unseen guest at every meal." Amen. I want you to be the householder. Amen. You know why? If he's the householder, he owns the key to the house. And if he owns the key to the door, he takes responsibility for whatever comes in or whatever goes out. The door is less for me. Are you here? Do you know why the prophet said the death that got Lazarus have been loitered around for a long time? That's right. But he couldn't get in because Christ is the householder. So anytime he knocks at the door, it isn't Lazarus that goes to open. Hallelujah. Lazarus became a tenant in his own house and Christ became the landlord. Hallelujah. So anytime Lazarus, you know, hear the knock and he wants to get up, he realizes that he has lost ownership. Amen. And sir, you have a guest. And Jesus will go to the door and open. And when Satan sees Jesus, he will say, "Sorry, wrong address." [Music] As long as the presence of Christ is retained. Amen. There was no evil that could overtake that family. The boat where Christ is whether he's sleeping or awake is unsinkable. You cannot sink his boat. Get Christ in your house. Hallelujah. Get Christ even in your bodily temple. Get Christ in your heart and you will be saved. You will be secure. You will be protected. Amen. Amen. Is it very simple for us? It's a simple gospel tonight, isn't it? But you will find wisdom in it. Amen. All right. So, as long as Christ was there, that death that has been hanging around couldn't enter. But in God's divine providence, Christ was meant to live. Yes, because he's got programs. Amen. But his absence cannot do a collateral damage. If it was in furtherance of his program, but if it was your attitude that sent him back, expect collateral damage. That's right. That's right. You can see that inside church, outside church, it's a responsibility to live a life that is worthy of the gospel. It's a responsibility, my brother. It's a responsibility, my sister. This is no religion to us. It's our way of life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Now, we are coming to things that challenge your followership. M when Christ left, he left on missionary trip. Maybe he started with Peter Mary's book. The moment he arrived there, Lazarus took ill. Brother said when Christ leaves, Satan has a chance. Are you here? But this living of Christ was to bring a greater glory. So don't worry, nothing will be out of g even in the most hopeless situation. But here is it. It was in Peter Marisburg when Lazarus took here and a message was quickly sent to him. That message came like a connected intimate message. Lazarus your friend. Un lovers. Amen. They wrote it in a way to release the emotion of Christ so that he can do something about it. Lazarus your friend whom thou lost is sick. But then it was a great shock of their life. Amen. For Jesus not to respond. Amen. Instead of Lazarus, instead of Jesus coming back, it marries will be maybe about an hour or two from Dan, right? Hour hour. Instead of coming back, he continued forward. The next time they heard of him, he was in Ptoria. And the further he went, the worst Lazarus got. Yes. The next time he was in Jo, the next time he's got into Botswana, Gabboron. Amen. By the time the condition of Lazarus went into ICU, he was in West Africa, Nigeria preaching for us. [Applause] Hallelujah. He was so far away. Amen. Now, this is your test of followership. Amen. Because this action of Jesus Christ, the prophet said attracted opposition. Amen. That's right. And you've got to know where you are standing. Yes sir. In times like this it attracted opposition so much that the whole church denomination that they came out from took an advantage. That's what the review world says to come and show some love but it was a malicious love. Sure. It wasn't a love intended with purity. Sure. It was a love intended in showing how bad Christ is and how good they are. That is a malicious love. But it's okay. Christ will fix it. Hallelujah. Have you called your pastor? We have called him. How many messages did you send? In fact, our emails are full. Uhhuh. So, where is he? What is he doing? We can't say exactly. You told us it was a bit spot the other day. Yes. Where is he now? He's in Nigeria. Not even in south. He crossed the south to the east central and landed in the west of Africa. This is serious. Oh, we told you in the beginning, oh my, that you be careful of these latter day pastors. Could you ever imagine our priest abandoning any of us in times like this? It's not possible. It has never been done and it will never happen. Amen. So what do you say to this that your pastor has done? Do you know they had no answer truly. That's right. Let me tell you church tonight, look at me. God will put you in circumstances that will make it difficult for you to defend him. Yes. Amen. That's right. It's a life reality. So if your Christianity is give and take, you ain't going to last in the church. [Music] If your Christianity is bread and water, amen. The type that needs constant maintenance that hasn't entered the holiest of the holies where the world is shut out and he lived by a constant glow of supernatural life. You won't make it, brother. You won't make it, sister. Let me repeat. Because Christ will put you on the spot. in a situation that defending in will be practically impossible in the face of clear evidence. [Applause] Amen. This is why your followership of Christ must have an anchor. Did you hear me? So beyond every revelation you go get, get this capstone revelation. Yes. That no matter what happened, whether I can explain it or not, get it as a revelation that Christ cannot be wrong. [Applause] Whatever it does, he is never wrong. I may not be able to explain. I may not even be able to defend. But I know he's not wrong. And time will tell it. Can we prove it that he is not wrong? Let there be a revelation in your heart. [Applause] When the Lord said accept you into my flesh and you drinking my blood, no life, no explanation. Did he explain? He never explained. Were some people offended or not? They were. Yes. Majority were offended and they left. Yes. And the Lord thought that all had gone. When they turned back, he saw 11 + one standing. He said, "What are you waiting for? Would you also go?" And Peter said, "Sir, to whom shall we go?" Wait a minute. Peter responded like that, not because he understood. Did you catch that? Yes sir. But because he knew that whatever he says whether we understand it or we don't understand it cannot be wrong. Things will happen in your life that will create an occasion for people to speak blasphemously. Just keep quiet. Just hold on. Thank you, Lord. The strength of Israel can never lie. Hallelujah. Never be wrong. He knows what he's doing. He will come true for you. Hallelujah. The Lord. It was such a great revival for the opposition. Amen. The prophet said they had a great day to show how bad Christ was and how good the old kind priest was. They even took them through memory lane to show the goodness of the priest to their parents before they were married. After they were married, before they gave birth to these children, after they gave birth to Lazarus and the sisters. Yes. Hallelujah. Amen. When the devil is doing that, what is he doing? is to fight with your emotions. He's trying to crush you emotionally. Listen to me. The devil knows that as long as you are in God's presence, as long as you are in God's hands, as long as you are in his environment, he can never tamper with you. Hallelujah. Even if he's throwing afflictions, he's throwing challenges across your path, as long as he cannot isolate you from the commonwealth of Christ, the devil knows in himself is already a failure. That is why you must not allow him to put you in a complex. Yes. Yes. I hope I'm speaking to a soul tonight. When the devil wants to tamp up with your life, he start giving you ideas that you know the problem you are having is so peculiar is a specially designed package challenge that nobody has suffered like that or has ever had such an experience like that in the other in this life. Let me tell you something how to deal with the devil first. The Bible said when he opens his mouth Amen. [Applause] Li another lie lie lie. Hallelujah. Don't ever accept his proposal. The Bible said when he open his mouth, he's lying. There is no truth in him. He likes to associate with light, but he is darkness. He lies with the truth. For he's lying liar, a father of liars. [Music] [Applause] Do you know why he's doing that? He's doing that to buy your attention, to steal your emotion so that you can develop complex against your power base. Satan knew it assured me. If he can't get you out of God's presence, he cannot defeat you. no matter what it brings your way. So don't ever allow him to make you have problem with your power socket. Don't let him break your connection. When he tried Job and he wasn't getting through, he became frustrated. He came to use the body of his wife and speak. Job knew that wasn't his wife speaking. He knew it. He was hearing the voice of his life but the words of Satan and that's the frustration of the devil because his deal with God is that you know what I will make him c you through your face then the wife said why don't you c go and die let's examine the lie you see why Paul told the church he said there is no problem that happens to you that is uncommon Yes. Yes. Amen. You see why he told it. Now that will sound like a callous insensitive statement, but those are the statements that will jolt you out of self-pity. Yes. Amen. Because the tool of the devil is self-pity. [Applause] He wants you to be in the pity party. Then you begin to sing, why me, Lord? If not you, who should it be? [Applause] Do you know if God allows anything to come your way, it's because you have his approval. Listen to me. The Bible said when the sons of God presented themselves, you know what that means? They came to church. We are presenting ourselves with the presence of God. The problem of Job came from the church. Uh-huh. Sure. And you know what was happening? God was, you know, God looked at the congregation. Uh, he said, "Mr. Satan, you are here." You don't believe he's here tonight. And you have to believe the scripture. You have to rise up again. He said, "We don't want him here." Who told you he'll be here? He's here tonight. Yes. The only thing you must do is to put him in the chain of circumstance. The chain of circumstance is a condition that makes him unable to operate. That's what the prophet explained for us. Put him in a condition where he's not able to operate. Whether in our midst or in your heart, when you stay together, when you deny the devil and you accept the word is coming there will be a waste of time. Hallelujah. But since the beginning, he's been attending service. Yes. If the service goes well, it's because we put him in a condition where he cannot operate. Because it's in the Bible that God identified him when the sons of God, hallelujah, presented themselves in the presence of God. When the children of God came for service, he said, "Where are you? Where are you coming from?" He said, "To and the wicked has no peace." Said, "Have you considered my servant?" It was God himself that put Job on the spot. Baby tonight you say, "Have you considered my daughter Jesus?" You don't want Don't be afraid. If God single you out is because he has put what it takes in you that situation. He wants to make you a testimony. He wants to make you a prayer point. He wants to make you an encouragement, a positive influence for somebody who can be in the situation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Some things are just opening up for me. Let me enjoy my liberty. Hallelujah. You know brother said he says sometimes God can allow you to go through a situation or even a sickness not for yourself. He said it's so that you might become the captain for the salvation of another person. Listen to your testimony. One day a sister with a cancer came to the prayer line and the prophet told her you don't need my hand you need the hand of that sister who is by the piano he said because she went through the same thing and she was healed of it now go to her right was standing and the sister went to her and the sister laid out and the cancer [Music] disappeared she was getting in order to be a blessing for this other one. So don't be afraid. God put you on the spot is because he want to single you out for a blessing. So here we have a family that seem to be praying and prayer wasn't answered. That is another way to look at it. The more they pray for their brother Lazarus, the more it got worse. It was as if God wasn't minding them. And how do you explain that? How few different defend God but they get faith. Yes. You must keep faith. When the devil brings all those tough tough thoughts, you say, "I'm a deep thinker." Stop deep thinking. Move your [Applause] mind. That is take over your mind. Stop convicted. Hallelujah. You know if you accept the lie of the devil that you are the peculiar person for peculiar challenge and problem. The devil has one. That's right. But that's not where he's going. But before you accept that light, let me ask you a question. in the neighborhood where you are living. How many homes have you entered? I'm starting from your neighborhood. I'm not saying the whole of your I'm not saying South Africa. I'm saying your neighborhood like somebody who is living in Phoenix here at this clay cent even crescent. How many homes have you entered? Do you know there's a probability that there are many people in those homes you are looking at who haven't seen son for 12 years in their life they've been paid the reading that's right yes sir then when we look at the whole of Phoenix when we move to do and come to South Africa how many of such people do we have the oldest of people have their leg hang that's right for years yes still waiting for recovery Amen. Some have been coma for 2 years. They've knocked on their side and they cannot give them all because symptoms, signs of life are still there. You don't know those things. That's right. But the devil will come to you. You are the only one. You see how much a liar? [Music] [Applause] How many stop accepting his life from tonight? You say it's afflicting my thoughts. Why should you give me your thought? Why? [Music] Why would you like your oppressor? Come to the Savior tonight. Do you know all he's doing? All he's doing is to build a complex in you. Because if you accept that God single you out for a peculiar problem, it will be easy for you to also accept that God must be peculiarly and personally mean to you. Are you catching it? Then if you accept that God is personally mean to you, something will be telling you of what you is mean serving a God. Who would be that mean to me? Am I the only offender? Am I the only sinner on the earth? [Music] Satan is winning. Do you know what he's trying to do? He wants to pluck fellowship away from you. He wants to take prayer away from you. He wants to take the word away from you. Because gradually you start feeling like if God will be that mean to me, why should I listen to him? Then you stop reading the Bible. You stop reading the spoken word. They stop coming to service. Why should I even talk to him? Then you stop praying and this is all it takes to isolate you. In your home body, they said it takes a black sleeping cell. Yes. To create problem for the entire body. If the cells are together, they form a tissue. And when they form a tissue, they stand strong as an army to challenge any invader. That is why when an invader come to your body that's demonology now he's not looking for tissue he's looking for a cell that has vaccinated meaning that have broken off from the rest of the because he knows that as long as that cell is alone it's easy to invade the body it will just attack that one cell and from that one cell it will start his own life to destroy your entire body that is what the devil is doing to you when he's trying to isolate in God's presence. Amenus. When you take a coal of fire from a bunch of cones of fire, the moment you take it, you killed it. But it will still carry some fire for a while. Hallelujah. But that fire will never be rekindled, will never be charged, will never be supported. It is extinguishing gradually it will fade away. This is why the prophet said you can't be as good as a Christian ought to be if you don't come to church because this world is not a friend to grace. They will give all the little light you have. This is why you must have God's presence to get a recharge. Whatever happened, don't leave the presence of God. So all this woman and attention they were bringing to that family was just to get them out of the message to make them doubt the message and embrace the old ways. But I tell you they met a wrong company. Yes. So where is pastor now? Pastor has even left Nigeria now. is in EJ. Ah, and you see the northern part of the country is close to Europe. 5 hours you are in London. So after a while is already in London. So that's like 12 hours flight back to South Africa. So what must we do now? In their eyes, brother Lazarus died. Amen. And the oppositions at the field day. We told them this is the reward of disobedient. We told them on this day things message message message. See where it ended. Okay. Will you please call him to arrange the funeral? Jesus was so far away until he couldn't make the funeral of his own church member. Sure. Amen. It's in your Bible. Did he attend the funeral? He didn't attend the funeral. Maybe the old priest buried Lazarus. Ah, by the time Jesus arrived, he arrived 4 days after burial. Amen. Or four days since he was dead. Now hear what Jesus said for you to know what he did was intentional. He told the brethren he said Lazarus our friend is sleeping. The disciples said let's go and wake him. Some of them already said what kind of sleep I've told brother Lazarus he shouldn't be sleeping to create panic. I don't know why we sleep too sir. What's wrong with this brother? Honestly speaking, when we get back, master, just give me this chance. I'm going to really slap the back. I will slap him from that sleep. Jesus realized they didn't understand. You know, he's a man that switches between two dimensions. Do you realize that? He said the son of man is with them and at the same time is in heaven. So sometime he speaks heavenly language because in heaven nobody dies. You see the language of he is speak when he realized he didn't understand let me come to your level our brother friend is dead let us not die with him Jesus said he said for your sakes it was good I was not there so everything our Lord did was intentional hallelujah do you hear me so it was not a mistake It was not an omission. It was deliberate. And he will do some deliberate things in your life. Sometimes people will say so that we don't create offense. I said come, you can only do your best. Christ himself is a rock of offense. Yes. The message of the hour is a tool of offense. Yes. But Christ said, "Blessed are those who have not offended him." No matter how big the offense is, no matter how offensive Christ is, there is a generation that will still not be offended. Hallelujah. Because they are connected supernaturally. Was it not offensive for a people who stood for God? Even in the Old Testament, they said they esteemed the reproach of Christ's greater riches to be thrown into the fire. Was it not an offense? If you didn't know how the story ended, if you were there the day Shepherd, Me and Abednego were being thrown into the fire, what would be your attitude? God, why? These people stood for you and you are allowing this When you have that, remember what he said. They said, "King, don't give us two or three chances anymore." Because if you give us 10 chances, the result will be the same and the result is that we will not bow down. But let's tell you one thing. We know our God can deliver us. Once they know his ability, you must know his ability. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] Are you with me? But watch what they said again. We know he can. But if he chooses to do, if he chooses not to do what he can do, they know what he can do. They also have the revelation of his sovereignty. Yes. That it is not everything he can do that he does. Do you believe God like that? Even though we know he can, but if he chooses not to, yet we will not bow down. Hallelujah. That is a Christian. Hallelujah. That was why separate us. Bless my brother, my sister, you are planning to spend eternity with those folks. Amen. Your stature cannot be less than that. That's right. Is that for your sakes? I was glad I was not there. You know, if I was there and Lazarus was sick, they will say no. He pretended in order to promote the image of Christ. He wasn't actually sick. So if you say he was sick and he prayed and he get If a man died while he was there, they said he fainted or he pretended he didn't actually die. They are trying to launder the image of Jesus. So he allowed it. They were the one who attended to him when he was sick. They were the one who buried him when he was dead. [Music] But he told the disciples that you might know the son of man has power over life and death. He said, "Let us go and wake him up." Jesus knew what he was coming to do. It wasn't a probability. Lazarus will get up whether the devil likes him or not. That was his recon mission. He said, "Let's go and wake him up." Amen. And here, Jesus was coming. And as they heard the news of his approach, remember the audience were divers. The believers were there. The skeptics were there. As they heard the news of his coming, some were saying, "What was he coming to do? Is it to eat his flesh?" After all, I said, "Except you to eat my flesh, you drink my blood." Is it cannibalist? Joseph was still believe that today. M Joseph was the historian. He said the communion being eaten is the body of Christ that the disciples kept and we are cutting small snow. That body must be a giant of giants to still have remained till now. Amen. Amen. Good. So you can imagine the kind of audience they met and they were saying let's see what he will do. And oh how nearly we deal with this man today. Don't beat him. When matters start dealing with don't beat him. Hallelujah. They were convincing themselves. But when Jesus arrived, hallelujah. Amen. The news of his arrival sprang new faith. In the heart of the believer. Hallelujah. The Bible said matter cut off. Hallelujah. And ran towards him and said, "Master, welcome past. If you have been here, what is death? What is sickness? In other words, she testified to the power of God's presence. If you have been here, my brother will not have died. Oh, when those old church heads that they said, now this one has been brainwashed. Jesus has hypnotized them upon all the preparation we made to get them to attack this man. and they were complimenting him and Jesus hearing that it's a case of despite all yes you can still compliment my presence okay your brother will rise again hallelujah are you here all that the winters of life have frozen in your life they must rise again they must be quickened again. Your brother will rise again. Yes. Yes. You know before you left you taught us on resurrection rapture. So I know on that great day, that great day, that great day that is coming, I shall see my brother Jesus said matter you are not getting it. The one who will bring that great day is stand. Hallelujah. It's like telling that man who was by the pool of Bethesda, the one who sent the angel to trouble the waters, he's by your side. He say, I have no man to throw me inside.

But let me tell you, you cannot be moved as long as you are in Christ. Hallelujah. When they found agreement with these believers, he said, "Where did you leave?" Said, "Master, where will we there?" The Bible said he went there. He went there. When they got there, he said, "Roll away the stone." That is one thing he will not do for you. Yes. He was not the one that put it there. You put it there. Roll it away. Tonight for whatever you are trusting God for roll away your doubt. [Music] Amen. This world must be raising your faith enough to say there's a possibility.

In those you must change the atmosphere. to me because he was determined. He knows he must change without that is why you hear the prophet to say sometimes if you believe it stay if you don't believe it you can go away. He said, "Whatever instruction I give, you must obey." He said, "Because when this spirit leads, they go from one to another." Amen. One day, God was determined to heal a young man. And one man was misbehaving and they were telling him to bow his head. He said, "This is a public place. You can't tell me what to do. I have my liberty." Brother Brown was trying to pray. He wasn't breaking through. Then he said, "Lord, why would you allow the unruly behavior of a man to hinder the healing of this little boy whose parents are interceding for?" He said, "No." He said, "By this I take authority over every spirit. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Mark everything alive. Yes. The Bible said Jesus started weeping and they will tell you the shortest verse in the Bible. Yes. Was Jesus. But you know why he went? He was bringing every spirit under control. He was bringing every spirit in harmony. Amen. In agreement. Read your Bible. The moment he was weeping, all the greetings started changing their mind. He said, "Ah, see how much he loved me. Could this man who can raise the dead even know that this man should not die at all?" They started confessing Christ. Yeah. They were attacking Christ before. Jesus put everything under control by weeping. Hallelujah. So tonight I place every spirit under my control in the name of Jesus Christ. [Applause] Hallelujah. Are we all in agreement?
