[3:12] really want to thank the Lord and we
[3:14] I want to reflect Amen on what the Lord
[3:17] is doing in our lives
[3:19] amen
[3:21] I mean if you can testify that your life
[3:24] is being changed from glory and to glory
[3:26] amen amen your life is not the same
[3:28] again amen amen you are calling things
[3:32] which are not as though they are yes
[3:35] amen as you step into your position of
[3:37] sonship and Daughters of God
[3:39] you're calling things that are not as
[3:41] though they are amen God Gave You
[3:43] Dominion of all things
[3:45] amen yes and when Christ is on the cross
[3:49] what did he say
[3:51] his final words
[3:53] it is finished amen everything
[3:57] now some are trying to attain more
[3:59] righteousness
[4:01] but we already have the righteousness of
[4:03] Christ some are trying to attain
[4:05] Perfection but we are perfected in
[4:07] Christ amen everything we have need of
[4:09] he has already done it so there's no
[4:12] need to try in the flesh to attain it if
[4:15] we try in the flesh that's religion
[4:17] but when we can see that it is a
[4:19] finished work so even healing
[4:22] we've got to approach healing as a
[4:24] finished work amen amen and if something
[4:27] is a finished work then all we can do is
[4:29] receive it yes believe it and thank the
[4:33] Lord for it yes Lord amen and God has
[4:36] put you through individual situations
[4:38] individual trials knowing that you are
[4:41] able to call that situation under
[4:43] obedience amen when it comes to sickness
[4:46] sickness has names they have many names
[4:49] for many sicknesses
[4:51] but there's one name that every other
[4:53] name has Baron too and we have the name
[4:56] the Lord Jesus Christ Give the Lord a
[4:58] good answer for praise amen so apply
[5:00] that in any area of your life that it is
[5:03] finished
[5:05] amen if you don't feel righteous the
[5:09] Bible says our righteousness is a filthy
[5:10] rich but we thank God that we are
[5:12] clothed with his righteousness
[5:14] if you don't feel perfect we thank God
[5:16] for his perfection
[5:17] amen whatever area if there's lack in
[5:20] your life maybe you have Finance
[5:21] problems the Lord says he is our
[5:24] provider that's what Jehovah Jireh means

[5:30] Lord is already commanded a blessing
[5:32] over your life
[5:33] so don't live in lack
[5:35] see the word amen amen amen we've got to
[5:37] come
[5:38] Authority

[5:42] when we change our attitude towards the
[5:45] kingdom and realize that everything was
[5:47] paid or two thousand years ago
[5:50] what do you think Redemption is all
[5:51] about
[5:52] restoring man back to its position
[5:56] where you were given dominion over the
[5:58] Earth amen now a lot of people don't
[6:01] want to swallow that because they want
[6:03] Jesus to do everything for them
[6:05] but he says if you only knew how
[6:06] powerful you were that's why it says if
[6:08] you say Amen if you say amen he puts it
[6:12] back on man I made you back in the image
[6:15] that I created you to be
[6:17] speak the word I gave you dominion over
[6:20] the Earth amen and you notice how quiet

[21:26] amen you may be seated
[21:29] God bless the reading of his word
[21:39] okay
[21:40] thank you Jesus amen remember now
[21:44] we read the book of Joshua there now

[21:48] of the Lord those amen
[21:52] so he made the angel of the Lord
[21:54] amen
[21:55] and now Joshua was instructed
[21:59] and he was led by the angel of the Lord
[22:03] and as long as he stayed with what Moses
[22:05] has given if he didn't turn to the left
[22:07] he didn't turn to right God blessed him
[22:09] yes and God blessed the people with him
[22:19] now let's see what he says in Matthew
[22:21] chapter 5
[22:22] verse 1.
[22:24] and seeing the multitude that went up
[22:26] into a mountain and when he was set
[22:30] his disciples came unto him and he
[22:31] opened his mouth and taught them saying
[22:34] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[22:36] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[22:38] blessed are they that mourn for they
[22:41] shall be comforted blessed are the meat
[22:43] for they shall remember the Earth

[23:01] children of God
[23:02] blessed are they which are persecuted
[23:04] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[23:06] kingdom of heaven
[23:08] blessed are he when men shall revile you
[23:10] and persecute you and shall say oh man
[23:14] oh man for my sake rejoice and be
[23:17] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[23:19] in heaven for so persecuted day the
[23:22] prophet which were before you
[23:25] watch with the 13 now you say ye Are the
[23:28] souls of the Earth
[23:30] but if the souls have lost his Savor
[23:32] where would shall it be salted it is
[23:35] then fought good for nothing
[23:37] but to be cast out
[23:40] and to be trodden under the foot of men
[23:43] ye are the light of the world
[23:46] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[23:49] hid yes now God has let the city up amen
[23:54] God let this body up
[23:57] amen and you are the light of the world
[23:59] yes
[24:00] and this is the time where God has
[24:03] anointed you
[24:04] amen
[24:07] Joshua's call for that hour God has
[24:10] called you in this hour and he will call
[24:12] you he's anointed you for this hour amen
[24:14] amen
[24:16] and if he's anointed you and given you
[24:18] the opening of the word in this hour it
[24:20] means that you are people upon the Earth
[24:22] that's going to be anointed and fruitful
[24:25] yes
[24:26] amen because this is the hour if you do
[24:30] not bear fruit he's gonna cut you out
[24:33] this is an hour you're gonna be chopped
[24:35] down
[24:36] this is where it shows what seed went in
[24:40] the ground amen
[24:43] Because by the fruits you shall know
[24:45] them
[24:45] so it's not good just to be anointed
[24:47] because it also got false anointed ones
[24:50] in the end times
[24:51] but there has to be the genuine anointed
[24:53] ones in the inside amen amen and they
[24:56] shall be fruitful it's not because if
[24:59] they are false anointed ones are bearing
[25:02] for their fruits they are becoming
[25:04] fruitful their type of fruits
[25:07] you're not talking about the evil fruits
[25:09] that they're bearing
[25:11] what's the political system they can't
[25:14] hide anymore they're now becoming
[25:16] fruitful they're not big they now
[25:18] they're showing what the true fruits are
[25:21] so how much more
[25:23] in this darkness in the midst of gross
[25:25] Darkness
[25:26] they are the salt of the earth in the
[25:29] time to be salty so people can become
[25:31] thirsty for the true gospel It's A Time
[25:35] For Us when it's spiritual famine upon
[25:39] the Earth that people reach from a
[25:41] garbage can yes this is the time to now
[25:43] not contain what we have what good we
[25:46] will do
[25:47] what good will it do if we contain what
[25:50] we have but we must be the people that
[25:52] will prophesy again amen before Nation
[25:55] tongues and Kings amen we are given a
[25:57] mandate amen
[26:01] because we are the light on the earth

[26:06] put it on their bushel but on a
[26:07] Candlestick yes and it give it a lot
[26:10] give it light unto all that are in the

[27:31] and if you keep this word this is an
[27:32] hour where the where the anointed ones
[27:34] are becoming prosperous in this hour
[27:38] God didn't just put you in the land of
[27:39] the Holy Ghost just to come and just

[28:05] Nazareth a man approved of God among you
[28:08] by miracles
[28:10] and wonders and signs
[28:13] which God did by him in the midst of you
[28:16] as ye yourselves also know
[28:20] him being delivered by the determinate
[28:23] Council and foreknowledge of God you

[28:32] loose the Pains of death because it was
[28:33] not possible that it should be holding

[29:03] anointed ones

[29:11] it should I perceive that God is no
[29:14] respecter of person but in every nation
[29:16] he that feared him and work at
[29:19] righteousness is accepted with him the

[29:33] From Galilee after the baptism which
[29:35] John preached oh God anointed Jesus of
[29:38] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with

[30:45] same thing happened yes yes his ministry
[30:47] was so prosperous his ministry was so
[30:50] successful people began to become
[30:52] jealous of it
[30:53] and they began to lust after the gifts

[30:58] successful Ministry but he was anointed
[31:01] for that hour amen
[31:08] and we are with sorry and we Are
[31:11] Witnesses of all things which he did
[31:14] both in the land of the Jews and in

[38:57] if it's the work coming up through the
[38:59] roots which he is the root the beginning
[39:02] of time
[39:04] notice
[39:05] but it's what they produce
[39:08] that tells you the difference
[39:11] by their fruits Jesus said You shall
[39:14] know them amen amen you're living in an
[39:18] hour where everything
[39:21] politics religious systems
[39:24] man can upon the Earth you can see the
[39:26] fruits now nobody can hide the fruits in
[39:29] this hour yes amen
[39:31] in the past the world looked at America
[39:34] let's look at one political system
[39:37] as a savior to the nation
[39:40] whenever they want to rescue they go to
[39:42] America
[39:44] because of the propaganda
[39:46] now you can see the true fruits
[39:49] in our when the world is in a certain
[39:51] condition
[39:53] America is stripping to impose sanctions
[39:56] on Nations that do not give Liberty to
[39:59] those people in their certain condition
[40:03] and a good example is Uganda
[40:06] you you
[40:08] Uganda impose sanctions they're saying
[40:09] if you are in this condition that's your
[40:12] condition
[40:13] but if you want to know
[40:15] go and share that condition with others
[40:18] like a virus spreading to others then we
[40:21] will import we will criminalize it
[40:25] or if you want to go and and now take
[40:28] this condition of yours and go and
[40:29] impose it on others we will criminalize
[40:31] it now America is saying because of what
[40:34] you are doing
[40:35] we will now impose sanctions on you all
[40:38] the funding that we used to give you
[40:40] the funding so to help people with HIV
[40:43] and AIDS the funding to help people with
[40:45] tuberculosis there's a big funding
[40:47] we're going to take it away
[40:49] now
[40:51] if you are really worried about people's
[40:53] life
[40:54] for something immoral you're wanting for
[40:57] people to die of TB you're willing to
[41:00] for people to die of HIV you're waiting
[41:02] for people to die
[41:04] because of your you want to allow people
[41:07] to be immoral
[41:10] you see the fruits are showing now
[41:13] the true
[41:15] fruits are showing
[41:17] so nothing no that's what the Bible said
[41:21] don't become a slave to any man
[41:23] the lender now you see what happens when
[41:26] you put when they give you all this
[41:27] money the borrower becomes slave to the
[41:30] yeah lender
[41:32] but you what I'm trying to get to now
[41:35] the world cannot write this condition
[41:36] yes
[41:37] yes religious system cannot hide this
[41:39] condition amen they cannot hide the
[41:41] fruits
[41:42] and you find that people that were
[41:44] starchy and formal and just come under
[41:46] the message by tradition they can't
[41:48] write the fruits either amen
[41:50] because if they had
[41:52] if they met has the gift of the Holy
[41:55] Ghost
[41:56] amen the Holy Ghost himself then there
[41:59] must be an impact on their lives amen
[42:01] because if they are the gift of the Holy
[42:03] Ghost it means they'll be anointed yes
[42:05] and if they are anointed they must
[42:06] become fruitful
[42:08] and if they're fruitful they'll be
[42:10] prosperous and they will have success in
[42:12] their Ministry they will have success in
[42:14] the Holy Ghost
[42:17] amen
[42:23] notice but it's what they produce it
[42:26] tells you the difference but the fruit
[42:28] Jesus said You shall know them
[42:30] man do not gather grapes official even
[42:32] though the two still be right in the
[42:34] Grapevine that could be possible but the
[42:36] fruit will tell it
[42:40] what is the fruits the word
[42:43] fruit for the season the word food for
[42:45] the season that's what it is they're
[42:47] teaching they're teaching of what the
[42:49] teaching of the Season what time is it
[42:51] man's Doctrine denominational Doctrine
[42:53] but of God's word for the season
[42:57] is claiming to have
[42:59] bearing The Becoming being anointed and
[43:01] being fruitful
[43:02] then what word are you preaching in the
[43:04] season
[43:05] what word is being opening up to open up
[43:08] to you in this season
[43:09] because the Holy Ghost must come and
[43:12] open the word in a prison time
[43:14] and can't take you back and look in the
[43:16] review mirror you can't look in a past
[43:18] tense he must bring you in the present
[43:20] tense amen
[43:26] he says
[43:27] now remember that Moses was born for a
[43:30] certain work yes
[43:33] amen
[43:35] but he could not do that work until he
[43:38] had received the gifts which will enable
[43:41] him to do the work
[43:43] how many of us can testify and say Lord
[43:47] we realize what you are doing now
[43:50] we now know Lord
[43:53] that you have ordained us for a purpose
[43:55] yes
[43:56] and therefore now you have been enabling
[43:58] us
[43:59] and enduring us with power from an eye
[44:03] amen amen for the service yes
[44:05] yes amen
[44:07] he had to go out in the desert and went
[44:10] there
[44:13] God at an appointed time amen amen there
[44:16] to be a waiting or period
[44:21] and there to be a back of the desert
[44:23] experience
[44:24] he had to meet the pillar of Fire
[44:27] God had to give the son go to her to
[44:29] anoint him to go and conduct the
[44:32] ministry that you ordained for him
[44:34] amen
[44:35] and therefore God had to bring us in
[44:38] this day in this hour we have to be
[44:40] manifested in this season yes amen and
[44:43] God had to anoint us for this hour amen
[44:45] hallelujah
[44:47] amen and if he has anointed us and he
[44:51] has appointed Us in this hour then he
[44:53] has given us the ability to God and be
[44:56] successful in his hour to be prosperous
[44:59] in this hour
[45:02] amen
[45:04] now every place around the world you
[45:07] take the Bible from Genesis to
[45:08] Revelation you take this word you're
[45:10] going to be prosperous in that because
[45:12] God is going to open it up to you yes
[45:14] amen
[45:15] because the gift that is given unto each
[45:17] one of us amen God has given the
[45:20] five-fold ministry to bring you and
[45:22] direct you amen and channel you amen
[45:25] that you can use the talent that God has
[45:27] given you in this land and you cultivate
[45:30] that gift and you will have good success
[45:32] amen if you stay in your position amen
[45:36] stay in the word amen and stay where the
[45:39] Lord has ordained you you will have good
[45:41] success
[45:45] do not turn from the to eat from the
[45:46] left do not turn to it from the rights
[45:49] now this is dangerous because Joshua is
[45:53] having good success to feeding all the
[45:55] enemies
[45:57] amen
[45:59] but one day
[46:04] there was a family amen
[46:06] that will come and hinder that
[46:12] and then
[46:13] Joshua will lose some battles amen and
[46:16] then he calls the solemn assembly
[46:20] amen he calls the Solomon it is a time
[46:23] for consecration
[46:25] he calls the solemn assembly
[46:27] exposes the sin in the camp amen
[46:31] expose his Aiken and his family and
[46:33] they're still in the camp
[46:35] and then what happens he moves on to
[46:37] Victory next he doesn't stay there amen
[46:41] when you you see
[46:44] a true child of God with the Holy Ghost
[46:46] you don't stay in your circumstances
[46:48] amen you don't you don't look at make
[46:50] your circumstances weigh you down you
[46:53] get up and you move on Amen and you
[46:55] advance amen amen because while you're
[46:58] advancing is one with Christian Soldiers
[47:01] amen you look at the naturally Israel
[47:04] the Jews they come out of the Holocaust
[47:06] they didn't complain and Grumble we are
[47:08] yeah now whatever God put him there they
[47:11] still went and cultivate the land they
[47:12] became prosperous they became successful
[47:14] they never looked back and say look at
[47:16] what these people did to us look at this
[47:18] actually they did to us and they keep
[47:19] grudging and grudging no they moved on
[47:23] they never feel inferior
[47:25] because why they knew to them they still
[47:28] know that God is with them yes amen and
[47:31] because of that they advance and when
[47:33] they do something they don't do it small
[47:35] they do it in big if they want to go
[47:38] into a business they do it big because
[47:40] they're not they they you know why they
[47:41] take their dress because they know they
[47:43] have a backing of God

[49:27] we have a generation of sign Seekers
[49:28] they know little or nothing about the
[49:30] word or a true move of the spirit of God
[49:33] if they see blood oil and fire they're
[49:35] happy that's what's happening all around
[49:36] the world now because they need to to
[49:39] keep people in church

[50:02] Matthew 24 that in the last days the two
[50:05] spirits will be so close together that
[50:07] only their very elect could tell them
[50:09] apart for they alone would not be

[55:22] we want to be ready for the Rapture amen

[55:35] amen Hebrews 6 1 says therefore leaving
[55:38] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[55:41] let us go on unto perfection
[55:45] not laying again the foundation of
[55:47] repentance from dead works and our faith
[55:50] towards god of the doctrine of baptism
[55:52] and of the laying on of ants and of the
[55:54] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[55:55] judgment and this will we do if God
[55:59] permit for it is impossible
[56:01] for those who are once enlightened and
[56:04] have tasted of the Heavenly gifts
[56:07] and were made particles of the Holy
[56:09] Ghost In other words the gift of the
[56:12] Holy Ghost and by May partake is with
[56:14] him
[56:15] and have tasted the good word of God and
[56:18] the powers of the world to come if they
[56:20] shall fall away to renew them again and
[56:23] to repentance seeing They Crucified to
[56:25] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[56:27] him to open and open shame for the earth
[56:30] now this is not for
[56:32] these people that tasted this now is
[56:34] people that tasted this true word
[56:36] amen amen amen those people and and it
[56:38] went away
[56:39] they once were enlightened
[56:41] but they never come to that point where
[56:43] it was it was now where they received it
[56:47] it was deep down in that Soul because
[56:49] once it's there he glided in that Soul
[56:52] amen nothing can take it away amen amen
[56:55] because once it's God it's once it's
[56:57] sealed in there once you are sealed in
[56:59] nothing can take it away yes but they
[57:01] were enlightened they chasted of this
[57:03] they were tasting of this you know the
[57:05] thing that we're hearing about
[57:07] another world and things like that
[57:09] and the powers of the world to come if
[57:11] they shall fall away to renew them again
[57:13] and to repent and seeing they crucify to
[57:15] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[57:16] him to an open shame that is crucifying
[57:19] the word for the Earth would drink it in
[57:21] the rain that cometh oft upon it and
[57:22] bring it forth the meat for them by whom
[57:25] it is dressed receiveth blessing from
[57:27] God but that would bear returns and
[57:30] wrath is rejected and is nigh unto
[57:33] cursing whose end is to be burned amen
[57:36] amen
[57:37] laughs
[57:41] so you see the hour that we're living in
[57:42] now
[57:43] amen this is an hour
[57:46] where the word that was already in you
[57:49] amen is now being manifested upon the
[57:53] Earth yes amen
[57:55] and maybe in the time pass people didn't
[57:58] recognize then look at you because you
[58:01] are just receiving and receiving the
[58:02] word but this is an hour now where you
[58:04] are anointed and when you anointed
[58:07] people must feel that anointing around
[58:09] man you look at the Old Testament when
[58:11] the prophets were anointed when they
[58:12] walked in the winter speed places people
[58:14] knew that those were men of God
[58:16] amen men and women in the in the book of
[58:20] Acts when they Apostles when the
[58:21] disciples when all of them were walking
[58:23] Whenever Wherever they went people knew
[58:25] that they were of God that God was with
[58:28] them because they wasn't Ordinary People
[58:31] they wasn't living their lives like the
[58:33] rest of the world
[58:34] you can't be an ordinary after receiving
[58:36] what you are receiving this hour you
[58:39] can't be walking around like every
[58:40] ordinary person amen that's why the
[58:43] proper preacher message the Oddball amen
[58:45] because people will see the difference
[58:47] in you yes people will recognize
[58:49] something different about you amen amen
[58:51] people who doesn't recognize that hey
[58:53] this is a Christian person
[58:56] and you can't do that without a consist
[58:58] without consistency in your life because
[59:00] people will find that out
[59:02] but when people look at you and come
[59:04] here later and see you only becoming
[59:06] more fruitful yes you're advancing amen
[59:09] you could you can't just remain stagnant
[59:11] now and saying we were people that we
[59:13] believe God sent us the prophet when God
[59:15] sent a pillar of fire God said he came
[59:17] in a Seven Angels Came in a cloud and we
[59:19] believe this message we've got church
[59:21] order and Doctrine no then you are
[59:24] stagnant yes but you must become
[59:26] fruitful amen people must see that your
[59:28] life is becoming prosperous that your
[59:32] life around this world is becoming
[59:34] success you're having success because
[59:35] when you're speaking every time you're
[59:37] speaking by more Revelation Revelation
[59:39] upon Revelation amen the word is
[59:41] becoming more clearer and clearer then
[59:44] you're taking them now to the modern day
[59:46] events making their life prophecy and
[59:48] you're taking them back to the word and
[59:49] saying see what the word says see what's
[59:51] happening here your Revelation is
[59:53] becoming more clearer yes amen you
[59:55] because you're advancing now you're
[59:57] advancing in the word you're becoming
[59:58] fruitful and then suddenly they bring a
[1:00:01] situation to you and you say you know

[1:00:04] follow them that believe when they lay
[1:00:07] hand on the sick they shall recover I am

[1:00:12] believer amen and I'm the one that
[1:00:14] believe in the tower I'm gonna lay hands
[1:00:16] and if I'm laying hands because I'm a
[1:00:18] Believer the science shall follow amen

[1:01:28] challenges came and brought other five
[1:01:30] challenges saying Lord thou delivered
[1:01:32] unto me five talents behold I have
[1:01:35] gained besides them five challenge more
