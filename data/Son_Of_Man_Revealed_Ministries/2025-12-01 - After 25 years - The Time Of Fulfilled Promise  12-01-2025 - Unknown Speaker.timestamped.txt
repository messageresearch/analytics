[0:03] amen I'm going to be speaking on after
[0:06] 25
[0:08] years the time of fulfilled promise amen
[0:13] after 25 years the time of fulfilled
[0:17] promise I'm speaking on high
[0:19] expectations and high Ambitions amen
[0:22] amen hallelujah so we go to Genesis
[0:24] Chapter
[0:26] 18 praise the Lord
[0:31] Genesis Chapter
[0:38] 18 we're going to read from verse 9
[0:41] we'll find from verse 1 to 8 it's it's
[0:44] the Lord coming with the two angels and
[0:47] Abraham getting to work but I want to
[0:50] pay attention on verse from verse 9
[0:52] because no matter what Abraham is doing
[0:55] when the time of Promise is fulfilled
[0:57] God is looking for the one through Whom
[0:59] The Promise will be fulfill yes so
[1:01] Abraham is preparing the FedEd C and
[1:03] he's preparing bread and he's washing
[1:05] feet and doing all of these things but
[1:07] verse 9 says and they said unto him
[1:09] where is Sarah thy wife amen I'm looking
[1:13] for the body through which the promise
[1:15] is going to come
[1:17] through
[1:18] amen now since the promise was given
[1:22] till this time 25 years had left
[1:25] lapsed okay everyone paying attention
[1:27] there and he said behold in the
[1:31] tent under the third pool there's a
[1:34] people in the
[1:35] tent come on you got to know the message
[1:38] not to know where I'm
[1:39] at amen amen there's a little room in
[1:43] the
[1:43] tent and that's where you're going to
[1:45] find the bride of
[1:46] Christ and he said I will certainly
[1:49] return unto thee according to the time
[1:51] of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have
[1:55] a
[1:56] son so expect the promise to be
[1:58] fulfilled in our lives is meaning we are
[2:00] going to come into the image of Christ
[2:03] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[2:06] which was behind
[2:08] him so she hears this now she hears the
[2:11] message now Sarah and Abraham were old
[2:14] and well stricken in age and it ceased
[2:16] to be with Sarah after the manner of
[2:18] woman amen praise the Lord therefore
[2:21] Sarah laughed within herself saying
[2:23] after I am waxed old shall I have
[2:26] pleasure with my Lord being old also and
[2:30] the Lord said to Abraham wherefore did
[2:33] Sarah
[2:34] laugh saying shall I of aurity be a
[2:37] child which am whole is anything too
[2:42] hard for the Lord I'm asking you that
[2:45] this morning is anything too hard for
[2:47] the Lord at the time appointed I will
[2:50] return unto thee according to the time
[2:52] of life and Sarah shall have a
[2:56] son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not
[3:00] for she was afraid and he said nay but
[3:03] thou this laugh thou this laughed
[3:06] right amen the Lord are blessings to the
[3:08] reading of his word you may be seated I
[3:10] don't want to keep you standing for too
[3:15] long now
[3:18] notice like we are
[3:22] saying I want to make the statement as
[3:24] well that and ask you or a question how
[3:27] does God measure faithfulness
[3:33] amen how does God measure
[3:37] faithfulness amen God measures
[3:39] faithfulness by what we've done with the
[3:42] promise of his
[3:47] word what we have done with the promise
[3:49] of his word now notice I'm saying what
[3:51] you have done with it not just that you
[3:54] know the word but God measures
[3:57] faithfulness by what you have done with
[4:00] the promise of his
[4:02] word now I want to go to a cour and uh
[4:05] after 25 years I want to read something
[4:07] here we've been through this I just want
[4:09] to reiterate this brother Bram is saying
[4:12] things happen in cycles of 2,000 years
[4:15] first 2,000 years Noah built an ark
[4:18] flood second 2,000 years Christ come
[4:22] this is the end of the Gentiles another
[4:24] 2,000 years yes sir now at the End of
[4:27] the Age he's got to declare himself the
[4:30] same as he did then or he did
[4:34] wrong so we were expecting something to
[4:37] happen after 2,000
[4:39] years since Jesus died rose
[4:43] again then brother Bram goes in the
[4:45] message Shalom preach 1964 he says
[4:48] Abraham come to his Crossroad and after
[4:51] he had trusted God and had seen all the
[4:53] miracles of god 25 years he waited for a
[4:58] boy a prom son and then God told him to
[5:02] go sacrifice the very thing he had
[5:04] waited
[5:05] for so I'm saying after 25 years the
[5:08] angel comes and he appears to Abraham
[5:11] and Sarah that's what we reading in
[5:12] Genesis
[5:14] 18 God had L them to the point to this
[5:17] point in their
[5:18] life and position them for this
[5:22] visitation I'm saying after people were
[5:25] expecting things in the year 2000 but
[5:27] now it's after 25 years
[5:30] amen amen
[5:33] yes amen and after 25 years when the
[5:38] Lord comes to Sarah he still finds her
[5:40] in unbelief
[5:43] right think of the church now think of
[5:45] the Bride of Jesus Christ is there any
[5:48] hidden unbelief the angel is going to
[5:51] expose that how is it going to be
[5:54] exposed when he's declaring the promise
[5:57] over your
[5:58] life you you yourself your response to
[6:01] the word is going to expose that
[6:03] unbelief because all the Lord did was
[6:06] say Sarah is going to have a son and she
[6:09] laughs we are saying the Bride of Jesus
[6:11] Christ is going to bring forth the Life
[6:13] of Christ what's our attitude are we
[6:16] laughing we are saying we are coming
[6:18] into the image and likeness of Jesus
[6:19] Christ what's our response are we
[6:22] laughing now notice God doesn't deal
[6:25] with the unbelief through judgment God's
[6:28] going to bring it to pass with whether
[6:29] you believe it or
[6:31] not Hallelujah you are the chosen one
[6:34] you are the elected one God has to bring
[6:36] it through your
[6:38] body
[6:39] amen amen hallelujah so which means
[6:44] something must be done to sah and a
[6:46] condition in order to bring the
[6:48] Fulfillment to pass now notice after 25
[6:52] years God is driving out all the
[6:54] unbelief all the laughing at the Angel's
[6:56] message all the laughing at the cloud
[6:59] all the laugh in at the pillar of fire
[7:00] is going to come to an end amen amen
[7:05] amen wonderful what was s supposed to do
[7:08] as soon as the the Lord told her you're
[7:09] going to have a son she's supposed to be
[7:12] like Mary and say be it unto me
[7:14] according to Thy
[7:16] word amen but she laughed about it and
[7:20] maybe people laugh about things for so
[7:22] long you're saying the Lord is coming
[7:24] back but I'm saying after 25 years for
[7:27] so long you've been saying a super
[7:29] Church a super rais Invincible Army but
[7:32] I'm saying after 25 years hallah thank
[7:35] you Lord thank you
[7:37] Lord thank you Lord now if you go past
[7:40] the next verse where we
[7:42] stopped after 25 years comes the
[7:45] Judgment of Sodom and
[7:48] gomorra amen oh yes we started out this
[7:51] year by saying the opening of
[7:53] Dimensional Doors we showed you Matthew
[7:55] 25 how a door was open to the bride
[7:59] under the shout it's a dimensional door
[8:02] that's why the outside world don't know
[8:04] nothing about it they look at us but we
[8:07] are shut in and caught up in a dimension
[8:09] called the shout hallelujah it's a
[8:11] process of the rapture we are in the
[8:14] amen we are in the process of the
[8:15] Rapture but we maybe we've never thought
[8:18] about it that way but we are caught up
[8:19] into a
[8:21] dimension amen a door was open the the
[8:24] Bible says read Matthew 25 again a door
[8:27] was open the bride was pulled in and he
[8:29] shut the
[8:32] door then the the foolish come knocking
[8:35] on the door but they can't access the
[8:37] hidden place yes Hallelujah now after 25
[8:42] years judgment is coming hallelujah what
[8:45] was prophesied over Los
[8:49] Angeles the prophet you know he
[8:51] preaching that message I think it's on
[8:53] the wings of a snow white d one of those
[8:55] messages and he goes out into prophecy
[8:57] and he says capernium capernium
[8:59] you will call yourselves a City of
[9:01] Angels and he declared judgment over
[9:04] that city right
[9:06] amen
[9:08] hallelujah so after 25 years we are
[9:11] seeing amen that that hell is being
[9:13] ported upon the
[9:15] Earth right you are seeing the leader of
[9:17] the Free World amen the new president
[9:19] elect coming in and you going to see
[9:21] doors
[9:22] open listen to what he declared we
[9:24] posted on the group he says all hell is
[9:27] going to break loose over the Middle
[9:28] East though they don't release the
[9:31] hostages I say if a natural man can be
[9:33] so passionate about hostages amen kept
[9:36] in the Physical Realm how about children
[9:38] of God Sons and Daughters of God like
[9:40] Abraham amen become militant about Sons
[9:43] and Daughters of God that are H captive
[9:46] and say all hell is going to break loose
[9:48] over Satan's kingdom if you don't
[9:50] release the captive if you don't let the
[9:53] sick go
[9:54] yes amen thank you Lord
[9:58] Glory
[9:59] hallelujah praise the Lord you know I'm
[10:02] reminded of the story I'll tell you very
[10:04] quickly there was one couple their child
[10:06] was held in in amen with a with a with a
[10:09] life-threatening disease in fact the
[10:10] child was at the point of death but this
[10:13] people this couple was in faith and they
[10:15] would go there and they would sit at the
[10:17] hospital amen outside the hospital and
[10:19] all the parents that would come there
[10:21] they would testify of to Jesus healing
[10:23] power amen and tell them amen God is
[10:26] able to raise up your child if you just
[10:28] believe amen that that by his stripes we
[10:30] were healed amen amen amen yet their
[10:34] child was at the point of death and they
[10:36] started to talk amen and say Satan if
[10:38] you don't release our child and heal
[10:40] that child we are going to St stay here
[10:43] and testify to everyone about God's
[10:45] healing power amen that's how determined
[10:48] they were for the healing of their
[10:50] child what do we
[10:52] do amen praise the Lord now when God
[10:56] calls a man he doesn't call him because
[10:58] he's better than somebody else the
[11:00] prophet is saying now amen but God
[11:02] called him he says now this is for
[11:04] Christian he says the first thing when
[11:07] God calls you he wants you to separate
[11:09] yourself amen amen amen so the first
[11:13] thing we got to do is separate ourselves
[11:16] separate yourself from kindreds people
[11:18] Associates your habits separate from
[11:21] everything and come and stand alone for
[11:27] God he says the first man was called by
[11:30] election talking about
[11:31] Abraham the last man being called to do
[11:35] the same
[11:37] thing separate yourself from your
[11:39] Associates things of the world come out
[11:41] from among them be separate he said then
[11:44] I'll bless you if you want a blessing
[11:47] separate from the things of the world
[11:50] you see people want the blessings of God
[11:52] without the
[11:56] separation so we are learning when he
[11:58] calls a man he asked him to separate
[12:01] himself when that man separates himself
[12:03] the prophet says God calls a man and
[12:06] anoints him for a certain
[12:07] Duty he expects that man to carry that
[12:10] out to the
[12:11] letter so God has an expectation on us
[12:15] to carry out what he has called us to do
[12:17] to the letter amen God doesn't want to
[12:20] give a man a commission and him him more
[12:24] about
[12:25] that amen he doesn't want you to pray
[12:29] like a
[12:32] donkey are you hearing what the prophet
[12:34] is saying God doesn't give a man a
[12:36] commission and him him all around about
[12:39] it he wants him to go straight forward
[12:41] and do exactly what he's commissioned to
[12:43] do don't look to the right or left just
[12:46] move
[12:49] forward when God calls a man to do
[12:52] something he might as well come to do it
[12:54] or he'll be miserable all the days of
[12:56] his life yes sir
[13:01] yeah now when God called William
[13:04] brandham William brandham was not laying
[13:10] idle William gram was
[13:12] preaching he was involved in the things
[13:15] of God
[13:18] Amen but the angel come to the prophet
[13:21] in a
[13:23] cave God called him and commissioned him
[13:25] to do
[13:27] something and he did not not sit idle
[13:29] after the
[13:31] commission he started out on a healing
[13:34] campaign and God showed him his ministry
[13:37] was going to grow in
[13:38] stages the prophet calls it pools but
[13:42] his ministry was going to grow to higher
[13:44] Heights what was this tell me the work
[13:46] of the Holy Ghost so tell me he was
[13:48] growing in higher dimensions of the Holy
[13:52] Ghost praise the Lord now the the angel
[13:56] told the prophet if you'll be sincere so
[13:58] sincerity is very important amen if
[14:01] you're being sincere in what we are
[14:03] doing if you being sincere and get the
[14:06] people to believe so God is revealing to
[14:09] him that there'll be stages of his
[14:10] ministry and God was going to release
[14:13] greater portions to him as time went on
[14:16] from the first to the second to the
[14:17] third pool so if we look at the life of
[14:20] Bram and the life of Abraham God was
[14:22] releasing the blessing to Abraham in
[14:25] stages sir God was releasing it to him
[14:28] little by little
[14:30] amen
[14:32] hallelujah God took the span of 25 years
[14:35] to release until the full fruition of
[14:37] that promise amen so I'm saying don't
[14:41] grow
[14:42] weary God is releasing to the church
[14:44] what's required we read last week that
[14:46] each year God unlocks the promises for
[14:49] that
[14:50] year so God has promises locked up for
[14:53] this year for us
[14:55] amen praise the
[14:58] Lord
[14:59] amen now in Matthew 25 we find that the
[15:03] bride at one stage was moving with oil
[15:09] light she was moving with oil in a lamp
[15:13] can I call it lamp
[15:16] light
[15:19] Hallelujah I'm asking you are we still
[15:21] moving around with lamp light where have
[15:24] we've been pulled in to the presence of
[15:27] the sunlight Hallelujah
[15:29] amen thank you Lord amen he's a
[15:33] brightstor moving around with oil in a
[15:35] lamp trimmed and burning outside the
[15:40] shout amen maybe you must put up the
[15:42] scripture amen Matthew 25 then when the
[15:45] bridegroom came he pulled it in to the
[15:48] marriage am Hallelujah than now why is
[15:52] the prophet preaching invisible Union of
[15:54] the Bride of Jesus Christ why is he
[15:56] preaching the marriage of the Lamb amen
[15:59] is she still is the bride still
[16:01] wandering out in Gross
[16:03] Darkness with the light of the lamp and
[16:05] the Holy Ghost come on H why have we
[16:09] been pulled into the marriage amen amen
[16:13] yes you see why last year was important
[16:16] to share in his glory he opens up the
[16:19] dimensional door to make us share in his
[16:21] glory
[16:22] hallelujah amen and while they went to
[16:25] buy the bridegroom came and they that
[16:27] were ready went in
[16:29] amen went into what the door had to be
[16:33] open because the yeah says went in with
[16:35] him the marriage and the door was shut
[16:38] so the door was open to the bride the
[16:40] sharp message a dimensional door I'm
[16:43] saying it again amen because repetition
[16:45] until it's ingrained in our
[16:49] spirit I tell you again ask somebody
[16:52] else to believe this message tell you
[16:53] they
[16:55] can't that's right something
[16:57] Supernatural is Happ
[17:00] hallelujah amen a dimensional door was
[17:03] open to us praise the Lord so it's not
[17:07] the time when the wise virgin is walking
[17:08] around with lamp
[17:12] light hey somebody say
[17:15] Amen when you get pulled into the
[17:17] marriage of the Lamb you're walking in
[17:20] the presence of the
[17:21] sunlight the full access
[17:25] amen now under the shout she the bride
[17:28] is built up into a Great Pyramid City
[17:30] yes you know that statue of a perfect
[17:33] man I'm going to say every time the sh
[17:36] message went forward a pyramid city was
[17:39] built
[17:41] am praise the Lord amen that was true
[17:45] Amen in the days of Enoch Enoch heard
[17:48] the shout
[17:49] message he had to have heard the shout
[17:51] yes amen because the message was going
[17:54] forth come on now people of God the
[17:57] message was going forth amen there was
[17:59] two messages going forth one for Enoch
[18:02] and one for Noah the prophet is saying
[18:05] that Noah was typing the tribulation
[18:06] Saints but there was a general message
[18:09] that was going
[18:10] forth but the only record you will read
[18:13] in the written word is the details for
[18:15] Noah and his
[18:19] church but for Enoch it's under the
[18:23] silence thank you Lord in Noah is
[18:27] building the ark and it's deep detail
[18:29] there the dimensions the width the type
[18:31] of width amen the it detail
[18:34] sanctification justification and detail
[18:37] every aspect of it you can find the
[18:40] plans there yes in fact people have have
[18:43] actually taken those plans and they've
[18:44] reproduce the ark because it's in such
[18:47] detail so they can reproduce churches
[18:50] because that blueprint was laid open
[18:52] there but under that seven seal amen
[18:54] when he open that seven seal it's in
[18:57] silence Hallelujah amen even up to today
[19:00] all they can see is the Great Pyramid in
[19:02] Giza but there's no blueprint in the
[19:05] Bible recording out God told Enoch to
[19:07] build that pyramid that pyramid was
[19:09] built in
[19:10] silence
[19:13] amen so you are seeing even now amen
[19:16] that was Enoch the 7eventh from
[19:19] Adam Enoch amen hallelujah had to have
[19:22] the Shar message the Thunders were
[19:24] revealed to him and in the Silence of
[19:26] that seven seal he built the Great
[19:28] Pyramid which is called god's second
[19:31] Bible now notice the plans and details
[19:33] given to Noah to build the ark and Noah
[19:36] typed those going in the tribulation but
[19:38] Enoch held the mystery of the Rapture
[19:40] and when a door was opened to him a
[19:42] dimensional door the mystery of God was
[19:44] revealed to Enoch and he built that
[19:46] Pyramid in
[19:49] Egypt Enoch the seventh from Adam was a
[19:51] type of the bride at the end of the
[19:52] seven Church age a shout goes out to
[19:55] call her amen and under that mystery of
[19:57] that seven seal she's being built up
[19:59] into a pyramid City a statue of a
[20:02] perfect man I'm telling you that all the
[20:04] building into a perfect city is here
[20:06] being D on the earth that's why when you
[20:09] see that City coming down in Revelation
[20:10] 20 amen 21 to 22 that city was already
[20:14] built because what goes up must come
[20:16] back down you can't go back up amen
[20:19] unless you are completely built isn't
[20:21] that the Rapture message until amen the
[20:24] church is completely hon to meet The
[20:26] Headstone so she goes up as a pyramid
[20:29] therefore she comes back down as a
[20:30] pyramid City somebody give God an of
[20:33] Praise so it means God's not going to do
[20:36] a certain part of redemption in heaven
[20:38] everything needs to be done on the earth
[20:40] amen the reason the bride is taken to
[20:43] the married supper is because he wants
[20:45] to come now and bring judgment upon the
[20:47] earth and the prophet says any true man
[20:50] who loves his wife will not leave his
[20:51] wife in Tribulation so he takes her away
[20:53] to the married supper for three and a
[20:55] half years he brings tribulation upon
[20:57] the Earth yeah
[21:01] Hallelujah show short message amen don't
[21:04] you love the beautiful type of Enoch
[21:06] Hallelujah not a word recorded all it
[21:09] says that Enoch walked with God amen
[21:11] hallelujah oh
[21:15] yes but now we are finding who built the
[21:17] Pyramid even now if you go Google it
[21:19] you'll see fresh videos yes they're
[21:22] wondering how was the pyramid built it
[21:24] was done in
[21:26] silence amen you are seeing big fans
[21:28] churches a big Ark being
[21:31] built to take those Saints into
[21:34] tribulation but there's a bride called
[21:36] opened a dimensional door to her amen
[21:39] hallelujah under the shout am yes praise
[21:42] the Lord so I'm saying that the Rapture
[21:46] is going to open up in dimensional
[21:47] stages to the bride the shout has been
[21:49] opened to her next will come the voice
[21:51] of the Resurrection now if you don't
[21:54] believe that the prophet of God says
[21:56] this that the bride will be taken from
[21:59] the earth and they won't know a thing
[22:01] about
[22:02] it they'll go on preaching they'll go on
[22:05] having church so I am saying think of it
[22:08] and a
[22:10] more in God's way of thinking it means
[22:13] he's opening up the Rapture in stages
[22:15] he's opening it up to her in Dimensions
[22:17] he's opened the dimension of the shout
[22:19] all that are called amen every
[22:20] predestinated seed will come in under
[22:22] the shout amen waiting now amen for the
[22:25] voice of the Resurrection Amen to call
[22:28] those sleeping Saints
[22:30] amen but can you see how through the
[22:33] carnal eye it will seem like you're are
[22:36] just another
[22:37] church to the kind eye it will seem like
[22:39] you are just another
[22:41] church but we have been caught up
[22:43] dimensionally amen thank
[22:46] you thank you amen praise the Lord so
[22:50] God opened up the door to the bride and
[22:52] pulled her into the shout Dimension the
[22:54] shout Dimension is only for the bride
[22:56] the shout is the rapture the sh is a
[22:58] call for the living Saints under the
[23:00] Shar Dimension the bride is in the
[23:02] process of perfection by the word amen
[23:05] the word is revealing to her a true
[23:07] identity a purpose and the Seven
[23:09] Thunders which are the Mysteries
[23:10] contained in the Seven Seals are
[23:13] preparing her for great translation
[23:15] Faith amen yeah the prophet of God now
[23:17] I'm trying to show you don't be without
[23:19] purpose the prophet is saying amen that
[23:22] he's talking about a
[23:23] boy and notice this boy I just picked
[23:26] this up now or maybe I never knew that
[23:28] this was here I was focusing more on
[23:30] this boy that didn't have any ambition
[23:32] but watch what he says here I was
[23:34] thinking of the story some time ago a
[23:36] colored boy he was about 25 years old
[23:39] you that part I never read
[23:42] before are was speaking about up to 25
[23:45] years the boy was 25 years he was kind
[23:47] of a
[23:49] floater he was a
[23:51] gentleman not a fugitive or Renegade he
[23:53] was a gentleman just a guy that likes to
[23:56] float around no place to go nothing to
[23:58] do do that's a horrible way to take life
[24:01] right I gave a man his dinner some time
[24:04] ago was a bum what did you start this
[24:08] when did you start this about 20 years
[24:11] ago where are you going he said nowhere
[24:14] I said then where did you come from he
[24:15] said oh
[24:17] nowhere I said how long do you expect to
[24:19] keep this up he said oh I don't know now
[24:22] what's a prophet no
[24:25] Ambitions why the Christian ought to be
[24:27] the most ambitious person in the
[24:33] world bring this glorious Gospel of
[24:37] eternal life to a dying and perishing
[24:39] world we should be up and at it amen
[24:42] tell your neighbor be up and at it
[24:46] Hallelujah he says no Ambitions the
[24:49] Christian ought to be the most ambitious
[24:50] person he says sometime ago I read the
[24:52] story of the noble one of the greatest
[24:55] presidents I think the nation ever had
[24:56] was Lincoln
[24:59] not because he come from Kentucky but
[25:01] because he was a great man he was
[25:03] deprived of an education but yet was
[25:06] something in his heart some purpose now
[25:09] here's the quote that we always read so
[25:11] maybe you must memorize this doors
[25:12] indoors paragraph
[25:15] 87 I like a man of
[25:19] vision I like people that's got
[25:21] something they're fighting for
[25:23] amen just not lay around
[25:28] whatever will come will be all right oh
[25:31] be up and at
[25:33] it and Lincoln never let his education
[25:36] stand in the way so I don't care amen
[25:38] about your education God don't care
[25:40] about your
[25:41] education God didn't care about Moses
[25:43] education God didn't care about the
[25:45] prophet's
[25:47] education he had something to do I think
[25:50] every Christian ought to be that way
[25:53] find your purpose and go do it
[25:58] find your purpose and go do
[26:01] it every member of this chapter just not

[26:30] placed you here do something about it
[26:33] now I want you to know that God likes a
[26:35] highly ambitious church but I also want
[26:37] to remind you God says God don't deal
[26:39] with the church as a group God deals
[26:41] with the church as an individual
[26:43] everybody know that the prophet of God
[26:45] says that it deals with you as an
[26:47] individual so what does that mean every
[26:50] IND individual needs to be ambitious
[26:53] come on now cuz God don't deal with the
[26:56] church as a group
[26:58] it deals with individuals so if God

[28:00] is saying when God calls a man to do
[28:02] anything he completely equips him to do

[31:52] that this church needs to be an highly
[31:54] ambitious church we are talking about
[31:56] after 25 years the time of f full
[31:59] promise
[32:04] Hallelujah the prophet is saying all
[32:07] Abraham's life he was a pilgrim stranger
[32:09] to the world for his one ambition was to
[32:12] find what was his one ambition to find

[32:20] Fai in that God that he fora the New
[32:23] Jerusalem and he was and he was put his
[32:26] pack on his back and became a wander not

[32:35] City he had a purpose in life to find
[32:38] that
[32:39] place Moses had an ambition Never Was

[32:51] people he wasn't concerned amen long as
[32:55] he was getting along all right what he
[32:57] cared about the those people laying down
[32:58] their suffering and God said I've heard
[33:01] the cries of my people I remember my
[33:03] promise which I had spoken with
[33:06] Abraham we know that our lord Jesus was
[33:08] ambitious and packed with purpose of the
[33:10] will of the father amen yeah the prophet
[33:13] is saying God selected the man for the
[33:15] age selected the message even the nature
[33:19] of the man and what would go over in
[33:22] that age what could put over amen the
[33:26] nature of a certain man he could blind
[33:28] the eyes of others the words of that man
[33:30] the way he acted would blind others and
[33:32] open others eyes he dressed the man in a

[49:54] be your ambition must be the Rapture the
[49:58] body change the kingdom of God the
[50:00] things of God if somebody's sick my
[50:03] ambition must be the healing of the
[50:05] body if somebody's bound the Deliverance
[50:08] of my loved one have an
[50:12] ambition he knew his father was a king
[50:15] so he carried himself out as a son of a
[50:18] king so I'm saying don't let your
[50:20] current situation dictate to you how you
[50:23] should what your
[50:25] ambition don't let your current
[50:27] condition where you are and the lowliest
[50:29] state that you find yourself in dictates
[50:31] your
[50:34] ambition I put out that picture the
[50:36] other day on the group showing you this
[50:38] boy dressed in ragged clothes but when
[50:41] he sees himself in the mirror he sees
[50:43] himself dressed in a suit he sees
[50:45] himself
[50:46] differently what's our ambition how do
[50:49] we see
[50:53] ourselves amen we're almost coming to an
[50:55] end now he he says my highest ambition
[50:58] and only ambition is to see Jesus Christ
[51:01] glorified I live for
[51:05] that but now I want you to pay attention
[51:08] what I'm saying I am laying these things
[51:09] in there because we are setting up the
[51:11] church for a time of fulfilled promise
[51:15] amen but we can't receive it without an
[51:18] expectation right so I'm laying in the
[51:20] expectation and telling you to realign
[51:22] your sight because this is the year amen
[51:26] amen for the release
[51:29] Hallelujah when the spirit is saying
[51:31] it's an opening of Dimensional Doors you
[51:33] are starting to see Dimensional Doors
[51:35] Open on the earth we just read in
[51:38] Genesis 18 Dimensional Doors were open
[51:40] for Abraham and Sarah for them to
[51:42] receive the promised sand but
[51:44] Dimensional Doors were also open for
[51:46] judgment to come upon Sodom and gomorra

[51:51] already amen did we see judgments coming
[51:54] upon the Earth yes sir you're going to
[51:57] see
[51:58] more so meaning all that was
[52:02] promised whether to the believer or the
[52:05] unbeliever both are going to receive
[52:07] their promise amen that's what Genesis
[52:10] 18 is
[52:11] about solom and gomorra are receiving
[52:14] their
[52:15] promises the bride is receiving their
[52:22] promise hallelujah
[52:24] amen thank you Lord I'm going to
[52:27] continue
[52:30] reading I'm going to continue reading
[52:33] because I don't want it after the
[52:34] service to say that I preached my own
[52:36] message
[52:40] here because I want you to see what the
[52:43] prophet is saying how this church must
[52:46] be now watching all of these things he's
[52:49] not saying that God is highly ambitious
[52:52] and God is doing things we know God is
[52:54] highly ambitious but he works through
[52:56] his
[52:58] body if if he's if our hands don't move
[53:01] he's got no hands if our feet don't move
[53:03] he's got no
[53:05] feet we are the body let's just make it
[53:09] our purpose in life to see that we are
[53:12] the Church of God let's have ambition

[53:31] Jeff normally a CH a service goes into a
[53:35] pendo but as the responsibility is being

[53:43] church
[53:47] am yeah he says if they don't do it let
[53:50] us do it anyhow if the rest of the
[53:52] nation wants to sing that's up to them
[53:55] in Phoenix we stand for God Amen we want
[53:59] to achieve we want to have faith we want
[54:02] to have ambition let's believe on the

[54:17] said I believe with all my heart you
[54:19] believe that and today when the church
[54:21] is sick the sickness is piled on yes and
[54:26] because people because of intellectual
[54:27] Pride he's getting away from Divine
[54:31] Healing that's right we in the third
[54:37] po under the third
[54:39] pull the prophet saw people go into this
[54:43] little room sick stretches wheelchair
[54:46] and they came out
[54:51] healed that's right amen we should not
[54:54] use the third pole as an excuse
[54:57] to say that we have the opening of the
[54:59] word because the power of God not
[55:01] flowing through your
[55:03] ministry you want to shun the power of
[55:08] God amen amen praise the lord
[55:14] lord what is he
[55:18] saying people are getting away from
[55:20] Divine
[55:21] Healing and when they do that what are

[55:28] Spirit God still hears the Cry of his
[55:31] people somebody has got to
[55:35] go thank you Lord hallelujah amen watch
[55:39] that same person who's saying that when
[55:41] they get sick they're going to cry out
[55:43] for Divine Healing and they're going to
[55:45] be praying that there's a man of God in
[55:47] on the scene that can believe that these
[55:49] sign shall follow them they believe if
[55:52] they lay hands upon the sick they shall
[55:53] recover they're going to be believing
[55:55] for a man who is able to speak the
[55:57] spoken
[55:59] word that's
[56:01] right Phoenix let's rise and shine in
[56:04] the name of the Lord Jesus if you're
[56:07] sick you say I'm sick in body God has
[56:09] spoken these signs shall follow them
[56:11] that believe in my name they shall lay
[56:13] hands on the sick they shall recover God

[56:17] ambition so he's saying if you're sick
[56:20] have an ambition to get
[56:22] well don't you say this is my lck that's
[56:24] Fallen to me go re

[57:19] pick with the people as well when he
[57:21] gave that Parable and he

[1:01:16] over your life thank you Lord you know
[1:01:18] if we can start to work for the kingdom
[1:01:20] of God all those things that you are
[1:01:22] laboring for all those things that
[1:01:25] you're going to leave behind and on the
[1:01:26] earth anyway that's
[1:01:30] right praise the
[1:01:33] Lord God will release it to
[1:01:39] you how if you every day your son has to
[1:01:41] come beg you for
[1:01:44] bread your son has to come beg you for
[1:01:47] food amen those things are just released
[1:01:50] naturally because you know your
[1:01:52] responsibility as a
[1:01:54] father God is our father
[1:01:57] how if you know the bird said the bird
[1:02:01] just is a bird the bird goes about doing
[1:02:05] bird things but the bird has never died
[1:02:08] from
[1:02:11] anger that's why Jesus says consider the
[1:02:17] sparrow consider the
[1:02:20] Lily but we are go chasing after money
[1:02:23] thinking that's the source
[1:02:26] money is not the
[1:02:29] source amen
[1:02:35] amen the reason why the bird is
[1:02:37] successful it fulfills its purpose as a
[1:02:39] bird
[1:02:41] amen the reason why Lily is successful
[1:02:44] it fulfills its Lily uh
[1:02:47] purpose the reason why we are not
[1:02:49] achieving what we need to achieve we are
[1:02:52] we have not been achieving our purpose
[1:02:54] but being distracted by trying to find
[1:02:56] something else that's
[1:02:59] right if we fulfill our purpose the
[1:03:02] other things will take care of itself so
[1:03:05] what are we saying a bird is being a
[1:03:07] bird a lily is being a
[1:03:10] lily they are fulfilling their purpose
[1:03:12] so let us be men Hallelujah let us be

[1:03:40] purpose is to rule our purpose amen find
[1:03:43] our purpose and do your purpose am be a
