[1:48] thank you Lord amen I GRE you all in the
[1:50] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:51] Jesus Christ amen isn't he worthy of
[1:53] Praise amen God bless you amen let's
[1:56] turn to our Bibles pray that you
[1:58] rejoicing in the Lord am amen the sub is
[2:02] working at enang amen he wasn't able to
[2:04] come to the service tonight amen praise
[2:07] the
[2:09] Lord amen little thought we speak
[2:12] on Hallelujah from Philippians chapter 4
[2:15] and
[2:17] verse3 amen I want to just title it
[2:20] we're still on the opening up of
[2:22] spiritual Frontiers just want to title
[2:25] this exaltation amen strengthening our
[2:27] borders amen amen amen
[2:30] Hallelujah we've got to strengthen our
[2:32] borders amen as much as we want to
[2:35] advance territory we've got to
[2:37] strengthen our borders amen amen oh yes
[2:40] Lord so Philippians 4 chap uh 4:3 says I
[2:45] can do all things through Christ which
[2:48] strengtheneth me oh yes amen amen I can
[2:52] do all things through Christ which
[2:54] strengthen me amen you may be seated the
[2:57] Lord a blessing to the reading of his
[2:59] word amen hallelujah thank you
[3:03] Jesus amen so we are coming into a time
[3:06] and season now where we've got to be
[3:09] moving from Faith to perfect Faith amen
[3:16] amen and that's not going to be an easy
[3:19] thing to do if we are not taught well
[3:23] yes amen because there was a word
[3:27] released to us to bring us into perfect
[3:29] faith amen amen amen now a word
[3:33] released
[3:35] for 50 years 60
[3:38] years and have no effect where you can
[3:41] see the sons and daughters in perfect
[3:43] Faith then something is
[3:46] wrong not with the word but something is
[3:50] wrong with the hearer of the word amen
[3:52] because Faith cometh by the hearing of
[3:54] the word so somebody is not hearing
[3:57] correctly amen a perfect message was
[4:00] sent now the message came the perfect
[4:03] word came in
[4:04] 1963 the opening of the seals which was
[4:07] the opening of spiritual Frontiers for
[4:09] us to move
[4:11] ahead amen amen so to strengthen our
[4:14] borders means to reinforce it yes to
[4:17] increase it to improve it amen
[4:21] hallelujah so the Apostle Paul is saying
[4:23] I can do all things through Christ which
[4:25] strengthened me now I like the way he
[4:28] starts it
[4:30] amen he says I can amen amen and that is
[4:35] you've got to have faith in what the
[4:36] word says about you yes you've got to
[4:38] have confidence in yourself thank you he
[4:41] says Jesus knew what the word said about
[4:43] him he had confidence in what the word
[4:45] said about him so he knew that whatever
[4:48] he spoke must come to pass because he's
[4:51] operating out of the word he's operating
[4:53] out of the scriptures amen amen people
[4:56] can be down and depressed and and maybe
[4:59] the care of Life coming over them but
[5:01] you
[5:02] can overcome yes Lord but you've got to
[5:06] say it oh yes amen amen we can't be
[5:10] allowing situations to get the better of
[5:12] us and remain in the humanistic realm
[5:15] when we are in the message of the hour
[5:17] when we are Sons and Daughters of God
[5:19] and then we say things of the world are
[5:21] weighing me down you need to have
[5:23] dominion over that oh thank you Lord
[5:25] thank you Jesus Hallelujah so you need
[5:28] to have dominion over the flesh you need
[5:30] to have dominion over your mind you need
[5:32] to have dominion over your thoughts amen
[5:35] amen even now Satan is coming we got to
[5:38] keep reminding the church that there are
[5:40] spirits hanging around to get you
[5:41] distracted from the
[5:43] service
[5:45] Hallelujah so I can start with I can yes
[5:49] amen amen you've got to have faith to be
[5:52] able to say you can that's right amen
[5:54] amen amen so faith is a positive
[5:57] confession amen I can wake up in the
[5:59] morning and say I can amen amen he's not
[6:03] saying lord I can't do it you know some
[6:05] Christians like to pray like that Lord I
[6:08] I can't do it lord I can't I
[6:11] can't is Paul saying I can't I can't is
[6:14] Paul saying I can't do it Christ come do
[6:17] it for
[6:19] me God didn't make you a puppet yes put
[6:23] you on the earth and pull strings go
[6:26] this way my
[6:27] son go this way
[6:31] no oh thank you Jesus God put you he
[6:35] called you in the end time he gave you
[6:38] his word so that you can come to perfect
[6:41] Faith he gave you his word for a reason
[6:43] he gave us his word for a reason the
[6:45] question is are we doing what we
[6:48] supposed to do with the word so faith is
[6:50] a positive confession he's not saying
[6:52] lord I can't oh he knows his position
[6:56] he's not saying Lord you come do it for
[6:58] me
[6:59] he knows that there's a law on the earth
[7:02] that if he puts his hand if he does a
[7:04] certain thing the Lord will go
[7:07] ahead amen and strengthen his position
[7:10] amen so I can means that he has
[7:12] confidence in what the word says about
[7:14] him amen hallelujah how many of you have
[7:17] confidence in what the word says about
[7:19] you is there any doubt amen there's no
[7:21] doubt so notice he says I can do all
[7:25] things yes yes amen so there is no
[7:28] limits there oh yes amen people have put
[7:32] limits people have put boundaries saying
[7:35] we can only go so far we can only touch
[7:38] certain blessings we can only do this
[7:40] this is our limitations certain things
[7:42] were only for this ministry certain
[7:44] things were only for that Ministry don't
[7:47] goast this yes who said that the crowd
[7:52] people around the message said it right
[7:54] amen but God made us to be an invincible
[7:57] Army God made us be able to conquer
[8:00] territories God made us to be able to
[8:02] have dominion over all
[8:04] situations amen hallelujah so there is
[8:07] no limit to what a son and daughter of
[8:09] God can do I say there's no limit to
[8:11] what you can do in Christ amen
[8:14] hallelujah with a positive confession
[8:16] you are
[8:17] Limitless there are untapped resources
[8:19] in the kingdom of God but I want you to
[8:22] be able to tap into those resources tap
[8:24] into the power of God tap into the mind
[8:26] of Christ amen and you can do it
[8:30] amen amen hallelujah we want to move
[8:34] ahead amen we don't just want to stay
[8:36] with the crowd oh this is our this is
[8:38] our territory we want to be like jabz
[8:40] enlarge my borders Lord am amen enlarge
[8:44] my borders I can do all things yes all
[8:47] things amen I say in this natural life
[8:50] whether you are qualified or not you can
[8:52] do all things through Christ amen
[8:55] hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah
[8:58] praise the Lord amen take the limitation
[9:01] off of your mind amen you know where the
[9:03] limitation is in your mind your mind is
[9:07] telling you you can't do it your mind is
[9:09] telling you you're not a son of God
[9:10] you're not a daughter of God it's
[9:12] impossible for you to do it you've got
[9:14] to defeat the mind the Battleground is
[9:16] the mind you've got to take the word to
[9:18] the mind yes Lord yes Lord amen
[9:23] hallelujah Limitless There's No Limit
[9:26] unlimited yeah amen praise the Lord the
[9:31] only limitations are what we place in
[9:33] front of us what other people say about
[9:36] us you know some people respect the
[9:38] opinions of others more you'll find them
[9:40] they're so uh what's the word I'm trying
[9:44] to find they are so polite everything
[9:47] they go to Mama Mama must tell them what
[9:49] to do you know they got big
[9:52] mama not that big mama you think here
[9:55] about but they got one uncle
[9:59] that they must go
[10:01] consult or they got one person they must
[10:03] always go consult never mind they're not
[10:05] in the message never mind they're not in
[10:07] the Christian we must go to Big
[10:12] Mama and ask him what he thinks about
[10:16] this
[10:19] amen but we forgetting the things of God
[10:22] the principles of God am amen they Place
[10:25] limitations on you you have a certain
[10:28] thing to do then they
[10:30] because now they are governed by their
[10:32] limitations because they feel they can't
[10:35] do it they say no I don't think that's
[10:36] good for you you shouldn't go and do it
[10:38] to this they are placing limits upon you
[10:41] that's right the same way the
[10:42] limitations the Catholic Church put
[10:44] limitations of the word of God but
[10:46] Luther said I want to extend my borders
[10:49] I want to go past what you are saying
[10:51] amen I want to read the word for myself
[10:54] the just shall live by
[10:56] faith and Then There Rose a man called
[10:58] lther amen Wesley who says I want to go
[11:01] past what Luther just said amen what the
[11:04] life was moving through the life
[11:07] couldn't be contained in the territory
[11:09] that it was in just in justification
[11:11] alone the life needed to move on and a
[11:14] man extended his borders and went into
[11:16] sanctification the second work of Grace
[11:19] am amen praise the Lord then we know the
[11:23] initial evidence the Holy Spirit was
[11:25] pushing out pushing out the Holy Spirit
[11:28] was now going to birth him the gifts of
[11:30] the church amen amen
[11:33] amen what's his name William Seymour yes
[11:38] a man had a desire to move past what
[11:41] Wesley said
[11:43] sanctification he had a desire and you
[11:46] know theza Street Revival why somebody
[11:49] got consecrated to the Lord and somebody
[11:52] had a desire to extend their borders
[11:54] somebody wanted to strengthen their
[11:56] borders amen amen and I'm telling you
[11:59] that it doesn't matter your reputation
[12:01] in the world it doesn't matter who you
[12:03] are God needs one man surrendered God
[12:06] needs one woman surrendered to him
[12:08] healed to him and there's no limits to
[12:10] what God can do with you Hallelujah you
[12:13] don't need to be a big name amen a big
[12:15] brand name amen be branded by the Holy
[12:18] Ghost amen I say we take some time and
[12:21] spend time with the Holy Ghost we spend
[12:23] spend time with the word we spend time
[12:25] in prayer and say God if you want to
[12:28] shake the world if you want to shake the
[12:30] Nations oh God here's a man who's
[12:32] willing oh God to pay the price for it
[12:35] amen amen amen these the things that are
[12:40] coming into the church amen the opening
[12:42] of the word the power that's associated
[12:44] with it is not going to come
[12:46] easy praise the
[12:49] Lord people think oh God's just going to
[12:51] give me something I'm just going to
[12:52] speak casually no these things come with
[12:56] authority these things come with
[12:57] adoption these things come amen when God
[13:00] has confidence in you and he says this
[13:02] is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased
[13:04] to dwell in so Paul is saying amen I can
[13:08] do all things through Christ which
[13:10] strengthen it me now if we focus on the
[13:12] last part he's telling you where
[13:14] strength comes
[13:18] from amen it is Christ that is
[13:21] strengthening
[13:23] him amen now if we ask ourselves where
[13:26] does strength come from

[15:54] says Be watchful and strengthen the
[15:58] things which
[16:00] amen
[16:01] amen so there are many other things that
[16:04] maybe we were taken away from the
[16:08] church little by little Satan took away
[16:10] things from the
[16:12] church and I'm not talking about back in
[16:14] the day church
[16:17] history I'm talking about now after the
[16:20] word was restored back to the church
[16:23] amen he starts to take away things wants
[16:26] to take away Mark 16 wants to take away
[16:29] amen the gifts of the Spirit wants to
[16:31] take away things from the church brother
[16:33] Bram says I show you where you put it in
[16:36] you show me where he took it out amen
[16:39] amen so little by little taken away but
[16:42] the Lord is saying strengthen those
[16:43] things which remain oh yes
[16:46] amen amen now they gone so far they want
[16:50] to take the fivefold ministry out of the
[16:53] church
[16:55] Hallelujah and this is not coming from
[16:57] denominations yes
[16:59] this is coming from within the ranks of
[17:01] the message they want to take the fold
[17:03] Ministry away from the
[17:05] church
[17:07] Hallelujah yeah it says here in same
[17:11] chapter Revelation 3 and8 I Know Thy
[17:13] Works behold I've have set before thee
[17:14] an Open Door you see all things God God
[17:19] when God opens a door no man can shut he
[17:21] says here and no man can shut it amen
[17:25] amen amen so I'm telling you move ahead
[17:28] move ahead because God is opening every
[17:30] door before you thank you Lord God is
[17:33] opening doors before you but you know
[17:35] something you can't stand far even if
[17:37] it's an automatic door a door won't open
[17:40] if you stand far
[17:41] away if it's got automatic senses I need
[17:44] to walk up to that door
[17:47] amen hallelujah wonderful even Samson
[17:50] walked up to the gate and he broke that
[17:53] gate amen amen so walk up to your
[17:56] situation walk up to your circumstance
[17:58] walk up to the limitation of your faith
[18:01] I challenge you to break your the limits
[18:03] of your faith I challenge you to break
[18:05] it now yes let the roof of your faith
[18:09] become your ceiling and let's keep
[18:11] moving
[18:12] on praise the Lord the Lord it says here
[18:16] I have set before thee an open door oh
[18:18] Lord all the doors is shutting Lord
[18:20] everything I try Lord the doors are shut
[18:23] you then you make this your
[18:25] scripture you know you get the victory
[18:28] you know some people don't know and I'm
[18:29] going to teach you something here
[18:30] because sometimes you sit in the church
[18:32] and and you don't know when the pastor
[18:34] is saying you got to take back
[18:35] everything the devil stole from you and
[18:37] you're shouting amen but now you don't
[18:40] know how to really go and take
[18:43] back because the the Warfare is
[18:46] spiritual you know I suppose if you saw
[18:49] the devil somewhere you can go up to him
[18:50] and slap him around and say give me
[18:53] back in the natural but now you can't
[18:56] see in it's spiritual
[18:59] so the way to take back
[19:02] Hallelujah is the word of
[19:05] God to apply the word of
[19:08] God to find what the word says about
[19:11] something apply the word keep speaking
[19:13] the word keep holding to the word take
[19:15] it to the mind take it to the
[19:18] Battleground so when when you're finding
[19:20] doors that are shut when you're finding
[19:22] that doors won't open to you you take
[19:23] the scripture you memorize the scripture
[19:26] come on you unbeliever I'm telling you
[19:27] to memorize the scripture amen you want
[19:30] to achieve things in life yet when we
[19:32] are here to equip you you're looking
[19:34] down on what we are telling you right
[19:35] now amen amen that's oh thank you you're
[19:40] trying every other thing it's not
[19:41] working listen to
[19:44] me Revelation
[19:47] 3:8 you can go before every door and say
[19:50] Lord your word declares I have set
[19:52] before the an open
[19:54] door this door is shut before me right
[19:56] now but I'm going to stay here and apply
[19:59] this word and take back everything the
[20:01] devil stole from me how you going to do
[20:03] it by applying the word heavens and
[20:05] earth will pass away but my word will
[20:07] never pass away you apply the word Lord
[20:10] you said you've set before me an open
[20:11] door and when you open the door no man
[20:13] can shut it yes amen you keep speaking
[20:16] that word you keep speaking that word
[20:18] until that door blasts open amen praise
[20:21] the Lord then you're going to come here

[20:28] going to come here
[20:29] testify praise the Lord thank you Lord

[20:53] name praise the Lord but you've got to
[20:56] walk up through that door you got to go

[22:07] ability he's saying I can do all things

[23:03] Scripture it says I am crucified with

[26:52] portion of his Spirit upon each one what
[26:56] is the spirit it's the spirit of Christ
[26:59] Christ didn't Jesus say didn't the Bible

[29:51] are and they don't say how many breads
[29:54] you
[29:56] took they
[29:59] close

[30:17] people who believe like you then it's
[30:18] fine praise the
[30:20] Lord so I'm asking you where are you
[30:23] drawing your daily strength
[30:26] from daily strength strengthening our
[30:29] borders now we know strengthening our
[30:31] borders when you wake up your mind is
[30:35] fresh your mind is
[30:39] ready but what do you strengthen it
[30:42] will I'm asking you the question think
[30:45] on your life what are you strengthening
[30:47] it with amen if you're opening your eyes
[30:51] and you are thanking God and just
[30:53] worshiping him yes and you pray yes and
[30:56] you read the word yes word of God then
[30:59] you are strengthening your
[31:01] borders you're fortifying your borders
[31:05] but if you're opening your eyes and you
[31:07] are looking at whatsapp and you are
[31:10] looking at Facebook you're looking at
[31:12] Instagram you're looking at Tik Tok
[31:14] you're looking at some message on
[31:16] Snapchat the first thing you're doing
[31:18] you're giving that Glory first Glory
[31:21] first praise
[31:23] yeah you see the boys and girls like to
[31:26] Bluff one another you are always on my
[31:30] mind you're the first thing I think
[31:32] about when I wake up you're the last
[31:35] thing I think about in I
[31:38] sleep but God that what you are saying
[31:41] that person took first
[31:43] place Hallelujah yes amen so where are
[31:48] you drawing your strength from how are
[31:50] you strengthening your
[31:52] borders amen praise the
[31:56] Lord now the Apostle Paul was seeking
[31:59] the Lord you know he was seeking the
[32:00] Lord for his healing and the Lord spoke
[32:03] to him in the first
[32:06] person and the Lord tells him in 2
[32:08] Corinthians 12:9 he tells him my grace
[32:12] is sufficient for thee but then he goes
[32:15] on he says for my
[32:18] strength is made perfect in weakness
[32:22] amen so Jesus is saying that his
[32:25] strength is perfected in you through
[32:27] your weakness es so don't concentrate on
[32:30] your weaknesses the devil will make you
[32:32] concentrate on your weaknesses that's
[32:35] how you tries to destroy your borders
[32:37] thank you Lord he tries to highlight
[32:39] your weaknesses but Jesus is Str hey
[32:42] give me that strength give me that
[32:44] weakness my strength is perfected in
[32:46] that weakness thank you Lord
[32:48] amen thank you Lord amen so what am I
[32:52] saying we can't rely on the flesh right
[32:56] we still need the Redemption of our
[32:59] bodies amen so we can't rely on the
[33:01] flesh so we can't allow Satan to beat us
[33:04] up based on the
[33:07] flesh we can't rely on ourselves on our
[33:09] own merits on human strengths and human
[33:12] ability but we've got to be able to
[33:14] apply the word amen yeah in 1
[33:17] Corinthians chapter 2:16 how do we
[33:19] fortify our mind how do we strengthen
[33:20] our borders with the word of God notice
[33:23] I'm giving you scriptures tonight and we
[33:26] go to 1 Corinthians 26 16 because when
[33:28] Satan is coming to bombard you and tell
[33:30] you but you got this mind and you got
[33:32] that mind you got to speak the word of
[33:34] God he says amen for who had known the
[33:37] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[33:38] him but we have the mind of
[33:41] Christ that is our absolute now that is
[33:45] our sure Foundation that's not my word
[33:48] that's God's word amen you can go to the
[33:51] to the enemy to Satan Satan no matter
[33:53] what you say in 1 Corinthians 21:16 it
[33:56] says I have the mind of Christ
[33:59] amen amen and we know the prophet
[34:01] further details that and he says the
[34:03] bride has the mind of Christ and knows
[34:05] what he want done with the
[34:07] word so I'm saying let's strengthen our
[34:10] position and I if you know you can only
[34:12] strengthen your position from a high
[34:16] place in most battles amen it's fought
[34:19] in high
[34:20] places that's why the Bible says we
[34:23] wrestle not against flesh and blood
[34:24] spiritual wickedness in high places amen
[34:28] but Jesus Christ also says amen I have
[34:30] come to bring you up to spiritual places
[34:32] Heavenly places and in the Book of joh
[34:35] Revelation chapter 4 come up higher
[34:40] amen why strengthening your position
[34:44] amen because an elevated position can
[34:46] provide soldiers amen using projectile
[34:49] weapons over the enemy more easily such
[34:52] as amen if he's using arrows or pieces
[34:54] of artillery amen The Higher Ground is
[34:57] always the Vantage Point yes that's
[35:00] right therefore Jesus says we are seated
[35:02] together in Heavenly
[35:07] places
[35:11] amen why High Ground is a spot amen of
[35:14] elevated terrain which can be useful
[35:16] fighting from an elevated position is
[35:19] easier for a number of reasons soldiers
[35:21] time more quickly when they're trying to
[35:23] go
[35:26] uphill that's right I'm trying to drive
[35:28] a point here and show you where we are
[35:30] positioned so what am i showing you the
[35:33] bride is positioned on an elevated
[35:35] position and Satan is down and he's
[35:38] trying to
[35:39] ascend but we have the Vantage Point
[35:42] amen
[35:45] amen fighting from an elevated position
[35:48] we are in Heavenly places amen he is
[35:51] trying to move up hill that's why he
[35:53] says I want to go to the sides of the
[35:55] North
[35:58] amen hallelujah and when you are going
[36:00] up here you can't move as fast you're
[36:04] tired and when if you know if you're
[36:06] fighting up here like this you can't see
[36:08] the the who you're trying to attack
[36:10] because the one in front of you is
[36:12] blocking
[36:13] you so your view is
[36:15] obstructed everybody agree amen amen
[36:18] therefore we sing that song Lord plant
[36:20] my feet on High Ground lift me up let me
[36:25] stand now that's why we come to now
[36:27] Psalm
[36:28] 24 who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord
[36:32] who shall get the Vantage
[36:34] Point who shall get the vantage point in
[36:37] the battle who shall Ascend Mount Zion
[36:40] Mount Zion is the showdown in the sour
[36:43] Mount Zion is you and I yes we are the
[36:46] final showdown yes praise the Lord Psalm
[36:49] 24:3 says who shall Ascend into the hill
[36:52] of the
[36:53] Lord who shall stand in his holy place
[36:57] so who's going to go to this High
[36:58] terrain of the battle and strengthen our
[37:02] borders there's a people selected and
[37:04] called for
[37:06] this and the Bible says here he that had
[37:09] Clean Hands and a pure heart that is
[37:13] speaking about
[37:15] consecration yes that is speaking about
[37:18] a consecrated life that is speaking
[37:20] about a hidden life the one that's going
[37:23] to go to the elevated position to
[37:24] strengthen our borders is the one with a
[37:27] con iated life the one with a prayer
[37:30] life Clean Hands the priest had to clean
[37:33] his hands and he had to have a pure
[37:35] heart aren't we priests and
[37:38] Kings amen he says who has not lifted up
[37:42] his soul unto vanity nor sworn de
[37:44] deceitfully watch now this man he shall
[37:47] receive the blessing from the Lord and
[37:50] righteousness from God of his salvation
[37:53] how do we strengthen our defenses then
[37:55] we've got to ascend the hill of the Lord
[37:59] is it why we took Psalm 24 this
[38:02] year we shall Ascend the hill of the
[38:06] lord we sing that song out of Zion's
[38:08] Hill salvation
[38:10] comes amen praise the Lord you among
[38:13] Zion amen you are here for the final
[38:16] showdown praise the Lord so we are here
[38:19] to receive the blessing of the Lord we
[38:21] find in 1 Kings chapter 20 we know that
[38:24] the the the prophet came to the king of
[38:26] Israel and said unto him this is now in
[38:29] 1 Kings
[38:31] 20:22 the prophet comes to the king of
[38:33] Israel and said unto him go strengthen
[38:39] thyself they had just fought a
[38:42] battle they just fought a battle on the
[38:45] hills and they won the battle they
[38:49] defeated their
[38:50] [Music]
[38:53] army he says go strengthen thyself and
[38:57] Mark and see what thou
[39:00] doest for at the return of the year the
[39:03] king of Syria will come up against
[39:05] thee so I'm telling you at every high
[39:08] place at every Victory don't think that
[39:10] this adversary the devil is going to
[39:12] back down that's right like the king the
[39:15] prophet is telling the king go
[39:17] strengthen yourself and see what thou
[39:19] doest what he's telling go strengthen
[39:21] your position and take note of what you
[39:24] must do next

[39:28] that yes strengthen our position come to
[39:31] get amen battle plans battle amen attack
[39:34] plans we strengthen our position he says
[39:37] for next year the king of Syria will
[39:40] come up against thee I'm telling you
[39:42] amen that Satan is not going to let you
[39:43] go Satan's always going to come up
[39:46] against you amen you are the people that
[39:48] he wants the most you are the sides of
[39:51] the north that he wants to sit
[39:52] upon praise the Lord
[39:58] you see Satan knows if he got Eve he got
[40:01] the kingdom Satan knows if he gets you
[40:03] the Bride of the Lord Jesus he's got
[40:07] Jesus so he wants to sit on the sides of
[40:12] the
[40:13] north but the prophecy is you want to
[40:16] sit on my queen you want to sit on my
[40:19] hill you want to sit on my elevated
[40:22] position he says you'll be brought down
[40:24] to the sides of the pit
[40:26] [Music]

[40:33] the prophet is telling the king go

[40:35] position I'm asking you strengthen your
[40:38] position strengthen your borders take

[43:00] tries to bring you low Satan tries to
[43:03] pull you down you fight him thank you
[43:07] amen so fighting from an elevated
[43:09] position like we said is easier holding
[43:12] the higher ground or offers us the
[43:14] vantage point so let us stay in Heavenly
[43:16] places what I'm trying to tell you amen
[43:18] let's not come down to the things of the
[43:20] earth amen it gives us a wide view of
[43:24] the field it gives us amen it can we can
[43:27] survey you know the Watchtower is up on
[43:30] the he up on the tower The
[43:35] Watchmen now in closing I'm going to say
[43:38] this because you want to strengthen
[43:40] yourself but strength comes from food
[43:43] right how do you strengthen yourself you
[43:46] get it from food we eat in the
[43:48] natural so therefore if we want to
[43:50] strengthen ourselves spiritually
[43:52] strengthen ourselves our borders
[43:54] spiritually we've got to eat the right
[43:56] diet the right food so yeah the prophet
[43:59] of God is saying talking about the Good
[44:01] Samaritan he says when the Good
[44:03] Samaritan come by he poured oil into the
[44:06] wound right he says he took you and he
[44:10] wants you to get into one of those hins
[44:12] that are closest to you watch how he
[44:13] tells us now he says he's done paid the
[44:16] pastor to take care of you so he's paid
[44:19] he's received the Holy Ghost got the
[44:21] blessings of God and health and
[44:22] Revelation he can just feed your soul
[44:26] yes so you can come now and join one of
[44:28] the churches it'll be the best thing you
[44:31] can do to keep your spirit fed and
[44:33] moving
[44:35] on praise the Lord now if you want to go
[44:38] according to God's provided way then you
[44:40] got to follow this so somebody's going
[44:42] to feed your soul you're drawing
[44:44] strength from
[44:46] somewhere praise the Lord amen he says
[44:49] here you've got to have confidence in a
[44:51] man you're dealing with or it won't do
[44:53] you any good to do any dealing you got
[44:56] to believe your your pastor he's a God
[44:58] saved man preaching the gospel stand
[45:01] behind him with everything you've got if
[45:03] he isn't go somewhere where they can
[45:05] where they do it so he's not saying you
[45:08] must be without a pastor he's saying if
[45:10] he isn't go somewhere where you can get
[45:13] somebody right he says now that clears
[45:15] it up for both sides remember if he
[45:18] preaches the gospel stay with him cuz
[45:20] he's a man saying sent from God ordained
[45:22] to feed your soul yes that's the main
[45:25] thing now because we want to strength
[45:27] ourselves what you're being fed then he
[45:29] says they have pastors to feed you and
[45:32] Shepherd you until Jesus
[45:35] comes they the care take at the end
[45:38] Jesus give them two pence talking about
[45:40] the Samaritan still now he says he gave
[45:43] the pastor two pence word and
[45:47] spirit if they need anything more he
[45:50] will give it when he returns you know
[45:52] the parable of the Good
[45:54] Samaritan amen so we know that faith
[45:57] if we want to strengthen ourselves Faith
[46:00] strengthens us amen Faith actually fast
[46:03] tracks you to the promise of
[46:05] God the more faith you have you fast
[46:08] track the promises of God in your life
[46:10] Faith actually activates the promises of
[46:12] God in your life the way to enlarge
[46:15] yourself and fill out is to be full of
[46:17] Faith amen you know if you want to fill
[46:19] a
[46:20] container you can't f it halfway for if
[46:22] you want it to
[46:24] expand how many if you follow what I'm
[46:26] saying
[46:28] like Enoch he reached Faith levels that
[46:31] were so great that this world his body
[46:34] couldn't contain him he had to enlarge
[46:37] and push out into a new body
[46:40] amen you can get so full of the Holy
[46:43] Ghost so full of the power of God so
[46:46] full of the anointing but the thing is
[46:48] do we want it or is it just something
[46:50] that somebody else is Desiring amen do
[46:54] you know in a car faith is the
[46:56] accelerator
[46:58] faith is the
[46:59] accelerator if you want to go faster you
[47:02] got to push the
[47:03] accelerator and what is the fuel the
[47:06] word is the fuel because faith comes by
[47:09] the hearing of the word so if You' got
[47:12] enough fuel in your tank you don't have
[47:14] to be afraid to push the
[47:17] accelerator you don't have to worry
[47:18] about if you've got enough fuel in your
[47:20] tank you've got the word of God Amen so
