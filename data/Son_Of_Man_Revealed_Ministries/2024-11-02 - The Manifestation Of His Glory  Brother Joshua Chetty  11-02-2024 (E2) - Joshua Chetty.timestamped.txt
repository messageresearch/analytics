[1:00] like hilarious to some people but it's
[1:03] the same
[1:04] Spirit yes saying the same body the same
[1:08] thing amen so it's not not a separate
[1:11] Spirit yes which means we all in one
[1:14] mind one body one Spirit come into the
[1:18] unity of the faith and when we come into
[1:21] that oh my then watch the glory of the
[1:24] Lord come down hallelujah
[1:26] amen Satan can't stand then amen amen
[1:32] turn to the Book of Genesis
[1:34] 1:26
[1:39] amen might seem verbatim
[1:44] but Genesis 126 let's stand and read
[1:50] this amen the thank you brother Jeff
[1:53] that was that was wonderful we could
[1:54] actually close the service by singing
[1:56] and go home amen amen we've been blessed
[1:58] to that amen amen
[2:01] Genesis 1 126 and God said let us make
[2:05] man in our image after our likeness and
[2:10] let them have dominion over the fish of
[2:13] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[2:17] over the kettle and over all the Earth
[2:19] and over every creeping thing that
[2:20] creeped upon the Earth so God created
[2:23] man in his own
[2:26] imageen so watch now the way Adam is
[2:29] created
[2:31] God's image is the same right am in the
[2:33] image of God created he him male and
[2:36] female created is them there's the image
[2:40] of God yeah with the feminist part of
[2:43] God uh femin part of man locked up in
[2:47] man and God blessed them and God said
[2:51] unto them see God is not speaking to
[2:52] Adam alone he's speaking to the to the
[2:55] also speaking to the feminist part of
[2:58] Adam cuz he he said said unto them be
[3:00] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[3:04] Earth and subdue it and have dominion
[3:06] over the fish of the sea and over the
[3:08] fowl of the air and over every living
[3:11] thing that moveth upon the Earth amen
[3:13] you may be seated amen so watch now God
[3:18] is blessing man yes because that's his
[3:23] image but he's saying be fruitful and
[3:26] multiply and replenish the Earth now God
[3:31] made Man In His Image yes thank you Lord
[3:34] and God had to do a certain part but he
[3:38] also had to have the feminist part
[3:40] unlocked of him to the other parts he
[3:44] cannot be fruitful and multiply if she
[3:46] still locked in him oh yes amen amen
[3:49] hallelujah he only can man can only be
[3:52] fruitful and multiply when that part the
[3:54] feminist part is unlocked out of man and
[3:58] then we go to Genesis 22 1 and the Lord
[4:01] caused God caused a deep sleep to fall
[4:04] onto Adam and he slept amen and he took
[4:07] one of his ribs and cloth up the flesh
[4:10] instead thereof and the rub which the
[4:12] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[4:15] woman and brought her unto the man and
[4:18] Adam said this is now bone of my bone
[4:21] Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[4:24] woman because she was taken out of
[4:27] man therefore shall man leave his father
[4:30] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[4:32] wife and there shall be one flesh and
[4:34] they were both naked and the man and his
[4:36] wife and we're not ashamed so she was
[4:40] made an help meal for him as we heard in
[4:41] the morning because now when she's taken
[4:44] out of him now they can be fruitful and
[4:47] multiply now Adam can fulfill the god of
[4:51] the earth now Adam cannot proper
[4:53] Dominion because prior to that Adam was
[4:56] looking at everybody being fruitful and
[4:58] multiplying bringing a of his kind but
[5:00] Adam couldn't do that while she was
[5:02] locked in him Christ couldn't fulfill
[5:05] his word while she was locked in him
[5:07] amen God had a great
[5:09] plan amen we come back now to that to
[5:12] that question what is a woman
[5:16] Satan saw the glory of God he he he just
[5:21] wanted to have this Glory because he was
[5:24] right there made a great sherub amen
[5:27] yes right there in the trone room of God
[5:30] but he couldn't have that Glory yes
[5:32] Hallelujah yes but he didn't know yes
[5:36] God's mystery amen amen that locked up
[5:39] in God was the feminist part of him amen
[5:43] the one that is going to share his glory
[5:45] with amen amen but Satan wanted that but
[5:49] Satan couldn't have that because it
[5:51] wasn't revealed to him the mystery that
[5:54] God had amen and then when he said when
[5:56] he saw God man on the earth and now man
[5:58] the son of God another Son of God upon
[6:00] the Earth and God is given instruction
[6:02] to the son you must be fruitful and
[6:06] multiply Satan saw that amen but he
[6:10] couldn't do anything yet because why she
[6:12] was locked up in him but when she comes
[6:14] out of him Satan now says let me pervert
[6:18] this now let me go and Mar the plan of
[6:20] God because why I don't want it because
[6:24] if they be fruitful and multiply in that
[6:27] condition in that perfect condition
[6:29] there's another son and daughter of God
[6:32] upon the Earth they going to have
[6:34] dominion over the
[6:36] Earth but Satan now he was cast out of
[6:38] heaven now he wants to have dominion
[6:40] over this Earth he had a plan to become
[6:42] God of this evil age so he's going to
[6:44] come now and interfere with that plan
[6:48] because remember the time when they
[6:50] reproduce is already after the fall but
[6:54] if they are reproduced by the spoken
[6:56] word before the fall Satan is finished
[6:59] amen
[7:00] Satan cannot have dominion of the earth
[7:02] yes but God allowed all these things to
[7:05] happen in his Tender Mercies now going
[7:08] back to that question what is a woman
[7:10] now Satan from there he saw that the
[7:13] feminist parts of God was locked in man
[7:16] the famish part of of Adam was in sorry
[7:19] the famish part of Adam was locked up in
[7:21] him so he comes and perverts that now
[7:24] and he shows man that you canot be a
[7:27] male and a female is locked up in you
[7:30] but what he didn't realize that's in his
[7:32] perversion now he's trying to say in you
[7:34] is also a feminist part in a man he a
[7:37] famish part or in a woman is also a male
[7:40] part you see how it's perverting men's
[7:43] God's word
[7:44] yes but God had to take the family part
[7:49] out because he had to live out it has to
[7:52] be
[7:53] manifested Eve had to come out of Adam
[7:57] yes it couldn't be together amen when
[8:00] Christ come on the earth he had to do
[8:02] his part but the feminist Parts the body
[8:05] parts he didn't do that he fulfilled his
[8:09] scripture yes he fulfilled all that
[8:11] pertain to his part yes but on Calvary
[8:15] amen when he goes to Calvary Hallelujah
[8:18] out of his Sid comes the
[8:21] church and then Satan tries to M that as
[8:25] well amen but he laid asleep d but in
[8:30] seven Church ages God is forming her
[8:33] he's bringing his
[8:35] Masterpiece right to the center of the
[8:37] end of the seven Church age when he
[8:39] produces this masterpiece amen and then
[8:42] once again amen she will come and
[8:45] fulfill their parts yes amen that's the
[8:48] body part that's the body from Seven
[8:50] Church ages hallelujah amen when Christ
[8:54] was on Earth he was the flesh part amen
[8:56] amen but he comes to Abraham he comes m
[8:59] the theop parts yes and just like that
[9:02] his body amen his body must have a flesh
[9:06] part right yeah manifested right now his
[9:09] flesh must have a theop parts on the
[9:11] sixth Dimension amen and then his body
[9:14] on earth when Christ died what happened
[9:16] on the third day he rose again flesh and
[9:19] theophany comes together in the
[9:20] glorified Parts amen just like that his
[9:23] body will come in the glorified
[9:26] States yes every that Christ did the
[9:30] body must do amen amen if Christ come in
[9:34] the flesh but he also was theophany and

[22:49] God could do that by the blood of bull
[22:51] and goats and Bulls that only covered
[22:54] sin and made a propitiation for the sin
[22:57] but but the sin was still there what can
[23:01] he do through the blood of his son yes
[23:03] that omit sin and God has not
[23:06] manufactured but he created a blood that
[23:09] takes away all sin amen amen don't you
[23:12] love that amen your sin is completely
[23:14] taken away amen when he's under the
[23:16] blood what are you talking about you

[24:40] across this Chasm it takes man back in
[24:42] the presence amen of his creator and
[24:46] makes him a Son of God amen
[24:50] amen amen so everybody in the people
[24:53] want to become Christian just want to be
[24:56] a church goer or want to just say I I
[24:58] Believe In Christ I'm a church goer but
[25:00] no God wants to take us back out of all
[25:04] this Amnesia that we had through the
[25:05] world Amen to show us that you a son and
[25:08] daughter of God yes that you are part of
[25:11] me yes that that the gene the soul that

[25:28] you stepped out of Eternity in the back
[25:29] part of God's mind you always were there

[25:33] out of Eternity to come into time into a
[25:36] time element amen into a time zone and
[25:39] you stepped into time but we are going
[25:41] back with him
[25:45] amen you don't realize that confess
[25:48] confess sorry he says he that believeth

[26:01] believe that what you said will come to
[26:03] pass you can have what you said glory to
[26:07] God it's my God revealing himself in
[26:10] humility prise the Lord amen hallelujah
[26:13] we living the hour of the thir pool amen
[26:15] yes amen he said why cry
[26:18] speak and now not everybody can just
[26:21] speak yes firstly you got to identify
[26:24] that you're a Son of God yes you got to
[26:28] identify that you're the body of Christ
[26:29] upon the Earth you got to identify that
[26:32] you're the feminist part of Christ doing
[26:35] the parts that he did and you got to
[26:37] recognize that now you have authority to
[26:39] speak yes because Esther he said speak
[26:43] now even off of the Kingdom you can have
[26:46] it she couldn't just do it before that
[26:49] amen but now when she put a royal
[26:52] apparal on when she come and recognize
[26:55] who she is amen and she recognize The
[26:57] Authority that she has she could speak
[27:00] she could even write her own decree amen
[27:02] amen so when you come to that stage you
[27:04] realize now you can speak amen can I
[27:08] water the
[27:16] king amen
[27:19] hallelujah praise the
[27:22] Lord praise be to God amen
[27:26] amen
[27:30] so now you have the authority behind you
[27:33] you can speak speak to your situation
[27:36] speak to your circumstances amen you
[27:40] know you are privileged people we don't
[27:43] realize what we got Amen on Friday I was
[27:47] there at my dad's place and they had
[27:48] some visitors
[27:50] there and I wasn't really in a mood to
[27:53] speak to anybody I said no don't
[27:56] introduce me to your Vis my mom said no
[27:57] no I must introduce you so they came
[28:01] there they need some prayer and
[28:03] help and I started to speak a few
[28:07] words and you know sometime when you
[28:10] speak the Holy Spirit can discern
[28:12] people's hearts and he knows the needs
[28:14] so I just had to speak a few words I
[28:15] don't know what it infiltrated them but
[28:17] I could see the reaction the
[28:20] continence people you are so privileged
[28:23] to receive the word that you receive you
[28:25] know people are dying yes yes for
[28:29] truth you think that all the people in
[28:31] the church world don't want to hear the
[28:32] truth no the leaders have deceived them
[28:35] yes right and they've now led into a
[28:38] delusion and they there's such spiritual
[28:40] famine that they will eat out of the
[28:42] garbage can because they spiritually
[28:44] they will die otherwise they know they
[28:46] spiritually dead they and they starving
[28:49] so they will eat anything so when you
[28:51] give a trip to them they appreciate it
[28:54] the little nuggets that you have to
[28:56] share they're not going toat anywhere
[28:58] else yes no other denominational
[29:00] preacher going to tell him the things
[29:02] that you're going to tell him yes no one
[29:04] is no one else is walking in Revelation
[29:06] like you amen am no one else is carrying
[29:09] the anointing like you yes yes amen you
[29:11] might not
[29:13] be how should I say attractive to look
[29:16] upon to be looked upon you might not
[29:19] have the alent
[29:21] words you might not have the right
[29:23] manner of speech or the powerful speech
[29:27] vibr
[29:28] speech but you're carrying an
[29:30] anointed praise the Lord and when you
[29:32] open your mouth as a Son of God yes as a
[29:36] daughter of God as the feminist part of
[29:39] Christ amen when you open your mouth the
[29:42] anointing that comes from you from
[29:44] within you it breaks the Yoke of
[29:48] bondage you go speak to people that are
[29:51] in bondage right now watch them break
[29:53] down in
[29:55] tears watch them break down in tears
[29:57] because why Satan's got them bounds but
[30:00] the demon powers that's holding them in
[30:02] bondage can recognize yes this is not
[30:05] normal
[30:06] people this sounds
[30:08] familiar amen this happened in the days
[30:12] of the Apostles because remember demons
[30:13] are the same Spirits demons don't die

[30:17] ages same Spirits these this we heard
[30:22] this in the days of Jesus we heard this

[30:40] other they're throwing bombs one after
[30:42] the other they're not giving her the

[30:58] realization because she recognized God
[31:00] in the hour that she's living in yes
[31:03] that's what we're calling people that's
[31:04] what this message is doing now I want a
[31:06] message of this hour
