========================================

me here in the world 's way to believe one impossible oh [Music] God not seen Amen brother [Music] [Music] [Applause] by step into walking dead episode [Music] [Music] glad to go back to me man I could have just say I mean they didn't carry on because he's saying things that are so inspiring yeah things that are paradoxes amen hard to believe but it's true amen yes in fact he's not even giving you a quarter of all the evidence that we've already gathered but as he said we can't mention everything people need to catch it amen and this is Sovereign God Sovereign choosing God's Sovereign Grace of how he wants to reveal these things because it's the evidence actually is phenomenal there's too much available amen amen is that even he didn't even give you a quarter of all the evidence that we've gathered thus far there's so much of things that the Lord is doing that it becomes unbelievable to the people if you're not walking in that Dimension amen Iman unrealistic and unbelievable to you amen but I believe as you're gonna see it in your life yes when you see him working in your life remember we're talking about the angel of the Lord amen we're not talking about numbers man yes when you see him working in your life yes and remember he's not only associated with our lives if you you find his Prince even in politics yes in all these things yes in everything he is fixing things amen amen amen and just to compliment what brother Adrian just mentioned now this is not my message I'm just going to read the scripture Psalms of 77 19. it says thy ways is in the sea and thy part in the Great Waters and I footsteps are not known um amen you see that thy way is in the sea and I part in the Great Waters and I footsteps are not known amen so these things are not going to be revealed to this is unlocking these are mysterious things that is unlocking now amen amen hallelujah these things were encrypted in scripture amen his Footprints are encrypted and only he himself can come and reveal it to you amen amen so his Footprints are everywhere because he's in he's doing everything amen amen yes amen everything that we see is according to his blueprint amen but his footsteps were encrypted but he takes the Holy Ghost to come amen hallelujah amen we got your Bible this morning please excuse my voice of telling about us recovery from the flu and you know the last thing she left to bear with me we'll take our reading from The Book of Matthew chapter 20. reading from verse one for the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which went out early in the morning to Aya liberals into his Vineyards hmm where when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day we send them into his Vineyard and he went out about the third hour and so others standing idle in the marketplace and said unto them go ye also when she was the vineyard and whatsoever is right I will give you and they went their way it's five and again he went about the sixth and ninth hour ended live quiet six it's about the 11th hour he went out and found others standing either and said unto them why stand here all day Idol is it under him because no man is amen no man did I realized no man-made system amen and he said unto them go away also into the vineyard and whatsoever right that day that shall you received so when even was come the Lord of The Vineyard sentences to it all the Liberals and give them their Ayah beginning from the last and to the first when they came they were hired about the 11th Hour they received Every Man a penny when they first came they supposed that they should have received more likewise to see every man in a penny a man maybe see that amen that's great father we come to you this morning in that precious and Wonderful Name of Jesus Lord even as we have read the scriptures Lord we know only you can come and unlock it to us father Yes scriptures better have been written many years ago but if I started for a certain time in a season ago and we believe that one of you can come and show us what it means in the hour that we're living in Lord we're done looking at a time in the day going by but we want to look here the scriptures for the hour that pertains to us oh God yes we want to see ourselves walking out in the scriptures amen you want to see our part of the prophecy yes slow I'm gonna speak to her this morning and Feed Us Lord you know the needs of your people whatever the needs may be this morning each one deferring one from another but I pray that you will come and meet them at the point of need we pray and ask it now in Jesus name amen amen Chloe go back to the same structure again we see that he says for the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which went out early in the morning to hire his laborers in the vineyard amen and see each time he's asking that he's looking at them standing idol God doesn't like anybody standing either yes amen amen amen God like liberals he wants you to be a laborer in his Vineyard we don't want you to be standing either and he went about the third hour and so understanding either in the marketplace and said unto them go yeah also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right I will give you when they went their way now if you turn your Bible quickly to the books of Acts chapter 2 verse 14. X 214 . he says but Peter's standing up with with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them a man of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem bead is known unto you and Arkin to my words for these are not drunkenness suppose seeing it be bad third hour of the day so you know what then our resembles Pentecost amen because they had an upper room experience to see the baptism of the Holy Ghost they would they were to carry there they had to wait there until they were enjoyed with power from one eye and the Saint Peter that denied Jesus the Saint Peter that was afraid to be identified with Jesus he is now standing boldly and proclaiming the same Jesus amen amen because why he's endured with power amen verse 5 of that scripture and again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise so you can see he's working amen amen is working from the day of Pentecost he's working all the way through all this now if you take the scripture Matthew 27 45 and put it there let's look at Matthew 27 45. foreign there was Darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour amen what that what's that typing now that 69th I was typing the Dark Ages it's typing the time that when the church went into a apostasy and the Dark Ages but God was still working amen he still were packing his people yes amen he still picked out his Messengers such as Columbus and so forth amen and we know at the end of the Dark Ages people who came forth it was Luther yes yes God called you the amen yes and then Wesley came forth on the reformers amen but who is working it's the same Holy Ghost working through every age amen amen verse 6. and about the 11th hour he went out and found other standing Idol and said unto them why stand ye all the day I look you say unto him because no man at either yeah aren't you glad that no man in iron aren't you glad that we are here today because he divinely by his grace has called us amen amen he is the one he's the one that called us to work in his Vineyard he's the one that called us because he said all that the father has given to me will come unto me which one of us can say about our own intellect by our own intelligence that we better understand what was happening in this hour amen but God had a selected people scattered all over in all the nations amen amen amen death in his 11th Hour he could call the people out amen so we're speaking this morning on the 11th Hour workers called under the third pool amen amen amen because we know the first two fools couldn't call you out yes because it was an ordinary fish amen amen the first two pool was calling small fish yes yes amen you was a rainbow trout took a special type of fishing to call you out amen amen this couldn't be a public show yes you may hear what brother Eden said there's certain things here we can't play out there amen that's right there's certain things that is Sovereign amen God in his Sovereign choosing will divinely reveal it unto you yes and that's God Sovereign choosing yes amen and a certain thing when he came to the third pool the angel said the prophet you can't teach these things yes you can't teach Pentecostal babe these things amen people have to come up to a certain level amen there's a special class of people that need to hear these things amen yes that's why you finally even when I was first came in the message I tried to win everybody for Christ and we go we we we're taking them to slip and see taking them to also this all to the things that we've heard in a message expecting them to to be rejoicing with us yeah but he takes a special class okay to receive this thank you Lord amen the makeup the gene of God already had to be in you amen you already had to be part of the vine oh thank you Lord one day they came to the prophet and said tell me something so all these other churches this church world they're producing these things are they influenced by what are they influenced by the sectors of the vine he's speaking about the sacrament of divine amen he said no then he was telling them no no the drawing from the same life yes but they cannot produce the same fruits amen amen because of you today upon the Earth because you are becoming appointed time in the season God at the sin of the prophets yes amen and from that same Reign that was falling there to be people like Billy Graham Arnold Roberts going out to Sodom yeah drawing from the same Vine but they produce their own denominational fruits yes because there wasn't of the original you are part of the original amen you will have to produce only of the original amen in all these years they could hide the seed yes but they cannot add the food because now is the time when the fruit is on the tree in the time of the lettering every now this time amen the fruit is on the tree and therefore in this hour it is it was in this hour there to be the falling away yes there will be a shaking up of the tree and everything that is not of it had to come out amen amen so we find that in this 11th Hour a people is called out yes now what these people are associated with Mark 11 23 amen amen amen because that's that Mark 11 23 is the third full scripture amen amen hallelujah amen open to put that up there Mark 11 23. foreign well verily I say unto you that whatsoever shall then whosoever shall see unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe yes that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says amen yes Hallelujah it had to be stored in there at Mark 11 33 It's associated with 11th Hour workers amen because he's the third pool scripture amen and that's why he couldn't preach this until the time of the thakur amen amen under the first to pull he couldn't Bridge it yes he was walking in it yes yes hallelujah amen amen and now we have ended a season whether where you have identified who you are in the scripture and now you are working under this third pool amen at one stage he was prophecy that there will be a people yeah but you are now not prophecy you are walking out of that scripture amen amen amen there's too much of vindication now to deny that this is that amen that which William Graham spoke of amen amen yes thank you let's also turn our Bibles too because let me just give you this quote here look for the quote not the seventh Angels message and uh recognizing your daily message from paragraph to YouTube now the seven angels message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the leaven our Gentile workers to receive the same pay that the first workers got amen amen now Jesus taught it he said there were some people who went into the Harvest they were hired when they did off early in the morning they received a time of penny for the day and then a new time someone else came in and went to work and then in the 11th hour that's the last hour of the today the 23rd up amen amen that someone come in and receive the same kind of pay that they did at the first of the day last hour it so perfectly how the first our messages with the word with the gospel with the truth they came in at the day of Pentecost then there was a dockage that blocked them out then at the middle of the day do then Wesley then and then came in and then there is to be an evening time message amen and to receive the same thing that they did at the beginning the evenings are messy to stop back to bring back that same thing again amen they were sealed with the Holy Ghost in the first day first is the same Holy Ghost must come and seal you yes amen hallelujah not a different Holy Ghost then the that's why he said they will write another book of Acts yes now watch this at the 11th Hour the 23rd hour these people are called but who's calling them out the prophet came preached a message but who's going who went around and said I'll run this Trail again amen yes to call it in the 23rd hour to call the 11th Hour workers the angel of the Lord amen amen amen who was the one that called you to give you your true identity amen what did the seven titles come to do come to take you out of Amnesia yes amen because you kept all from the time you're born you were lied to you're in this entire world system is alive yes it's just the entire world system is designed to keep you thinking in a certain way the entire world system your educational system is alive because it's designed to make you think in a certain way it makes you think according to the world agenda do you know that and that is why education is always changing yes because each time they change the the methods of education is to make you think according to the world's agenda why do you think you got all these feminist movements in our love yeah it's all in your education system they make you they make you believe a certain thing yes and how they do it they influence you through Hollywood so the media to the mainstream media they make you believe things a certain way yeah yeah and then they lie to you they keep putting emphasis on global warming global warming and all these things but when you really do a research on it you'll find that they got another agenda behind it they're pushing money they're pushing all these things they make you understand life in a way that you didn't understand but the angel of God comes to make you understand your misunderstood life amen he comes to give you skill and understanding yes amen he comes to give you a true identity yeah yeah that you thought your you were you were just there you're by your mother and father your mother and father was just there to produce the Earth body that because you needed a body to dwell in yes you are a supernatural being amen you needed a body and at a certain time and season dare to be carriers of the seed and then that body had to come forth on the Earth but your identity wasn't that human identity you are a supernatural being amen amen when the word came in make you realize where you truly come from amen and yeah you are grumbling oh I'm just a person living around here I've got a simple job and I can't make it in life but when you come to realize that God is your father Yes amen you're talking about if a person born in the royal family a child born in royal family he's not worried about money you know he belongs to the royal family a person born in one of the areas or something born in The Bolognese children they're not worried about money they're not worried about all these things because they know all these things are taken care of how about you yes amen when you come to have the two identity that you have the dean of God and you men that you always was part of God hallelujah that you never just began here amen that you was part of God in the back part of God's mind he took a profit to go there yes yes amen now when you when these things when when these things are made known unto us then it gives us a perfect faith it makes us live in a world of perfect Faith because it shows us through the scriptures amen that's why the scripture says Ephesians 4 30 and Grave not the holy spirit of God whereby your seals amen until the day of redemption if the first workers were sealed if the oil from Pentecost they were sealed at every age they were sealed away so you are sealed receiving the same pay as them amen but you need to identify who you are amen because right now the angel of God is a daily fight in this hour in this Third Exodus that while Israel is going to the Homeland natural land you are in your homeland of the Holy Ghost amen and it is the angel of God that is leading you while you are thinking you in your darkest hour you don't know what to do it is in you the property in the darkest hour that Jesus came he will drive out all these in your life amen you're not natural genocide revised and so forth but 200 million demons are upon the Earth influencing mankind their Spirits all over you know you're actually walking around and you're talking to people but you don't you need to have spiritual yes I used to realize that people are possessed with their powers amen if you hear people talking and you are the things that they are saying you will under you're able to contact the spirit right you said if you spend more than five minutes on someone they don't contact the spirit then you need to really get the Holy Ghost and have discernments to contact what type of spirit that people got yes and you'll see that those spirits will not cannot stay wrong with you if you don't talk about God it's fine but if you if you speak about the things of God they can't stay long with you yeah yeah but man is gone so insane he's imagining all of all things that even you say and human cannot imagine because why is in because of the imagination of his heart and the influence of demon power upon him is now giving to everything that is ungodly now he says in the message the mark of the beast and the seed of God paragraph 51. he says now notice he's talking about now he's talking about uh the world war one now right talking about the world war the first World War he said all the nation Ally Gathering and he was writing on the decline of the first World War so I was wondering what happened how does war stop now he said nobody knows today whoever made the issue of peace he said no General City said he didn't do it but notice how strange it was now watch this now we're talking about World War one now this is World War one ended suddenly you know it was on November the 11th at 11 o'clock in the day in the 11th day of the month [Music] in the 11th in the 11th month in the year and in the 11th Hour of the day and 11 minutes 11. he said what was it he said watch did it God issue when fought all the Four Winds amen wins win means why and strife now we know World War one was 1918. and it stopped right there on the 11th Hour because remember Jesus speaking of the 11th Hour people and the one that come in on the 11th Hour so what was happening here World War One Stop mysteriously why dare to be stopped because God had to deal at that time God had to deal with the Jews it was kept in All Nations but even from 1918 till 1946 that's when the angel of God came in the cave in 1946 the angel of the Lord appeared visibly to the prophet Town amen appeared in this Dimension where he could see him and and talk to him appeared to him in a cave in 1946 and gave him his commission at the same time he is being commissioned he's telling him now but Israel is becoming a nation danger of the Lord what was that Naomi coming back in the Homeland after World War II and so we find that the reason is that to be done because I go there let's turn to the Book of Revelation verse 10 chapter 10. let's read that very slow Revelation 10 verse 8-11 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel would stand upon the seed upon the Earth and I pray that we've been laboring on this scripture for many years now I pray that you identify yourself with the scripture amen let's take into the book I pray you don't just look at that as a symbol and John taking the book and you have to see yourself that John is part of the Bride and I went unto the angel and said unto him give he said unto me take it and eat it up and he shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in their mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I eat in it my belly was bitter look at verse 11 now here's a lemon hour working why is on Lebanon he said unto me thou must prophesy again amen before many people and nation and tongues and King you see that wage fit perfectly in the scripture that you've got to work to do Amen in the 11th Hour in the 23rd hour before midnight it so there's a quick short work amen you don't have much time left amen amen there's a quick short work for you to do yes yes there in verse 11 and he says prophesy again amen but for many people and nation and tongues and kings do not stay idled do not check from your responsibility amen so wait there until you enjoy with power from an eye and then that is why the Holy Spirit has taken us from from step onto step yes amen where did you take us first back to repentance amen when you take us back to the altar amen back to consecration yes amen back to prayer back to wait wait for what till he enjoys with power from an eye and then when he drops down which is already doing right now amen then he will give you the ability to operate the gift within you amen and then you will go out with bonus because what happened to the first Pentecostal church when they began to Proclaim Christ when he came out of the upper room boldness Came Upon them amen no fear upon them none of them was worried about whether they should save his life or not because you realize that this life was just a temporary life yeah and therefore we are not here to build our Empires upon the Earth because everything around here is temporary yes amen amen do you know that man is trying to seek intelligence and say I've got this degree I got this qualification but what you don't realize soon that qualification will be nothing yes right do you know now people they have identified people Joshua was telling me people have been doing their phds master's degree to artificial intelligence in fact our University Center sent us a warning the other day and they got now a software that can pick up if we have used artificial intelligence in time because matters become lazy now dependent on the artificial intelligence because it's more intelligent than men so you think you understand what I'm saying you he's trying to acquire this as soon as I say we don't need your degree we don't need that the computer you've got no more knowledge than you yeah yeah but thank God for Spiritual wisdom amen it supersedes the wisdom of man amen the wisdom of God supersedes the wisdom of man because intelligent men can't understand simple things yes amen he still doesn't know where he began from how does that begin he's still trying to fed him death he's still trying to he's still trying to fed them what happened in inexperiment yes yes yeah how the pyramids were Bulls but all his secret was revealed to us amen they are so caught up in the system they don't realize that Rome is controlling all his world powers and they don't realize us all these economies are gonna soon crash and what is happening around that everything is controlled but it must happen and it must come a time amen the why is the holy spirit taking us to this because they're coming a time where you're gonna have to now you don't know what to do you don't have you have me amen you're gonna have needs you're gonna have a need for medication but you can't get it you're gonna have to speak the word that's right amen you're going to need for finance you don't know what to do with it there's gonna be a need for it amen amen and you're going to speak it yeah he's preparing us for the time amen yes now he says now there have been sorry it is quoting in the message they're recognizing your day and his message 62. now they had been scattered blinded and are far in the third day you see it they were scattered from Palestine throughout the world they were blinded to reject the Messiah and now they have been gathered in their own land ready for the trumpet to recognize the atonement so let me so remember now we have a very short work to do yes yes and they showed you there in Revelation 10 8 to 11 Dharma prophesy again amen what follows after Revelation 10 8 to 11 the 11th birth it goes to Revelation 11. amen watch in Revelation 11 it's Moses and Elijah coming down yes to call out just to preacher the Jews yes because why we were called under it seven seal amen and they are called under that seven trumpets yes what did seven some would cause them to do to recognize to come to the Feast of atonement to recognize the atonement to recognize the Messiah that was rejected yes amen therefore you find now that is why for this quick short work you find here now the angel of God suppressing the powers the earth and the Sea yes suppressing the power because they got the atomic Powers amen they got everything to escalate into their final world war three nothing else is stopping them the only thing that's stopping them is the Angel of the Lord amen because we are here and amen and we find that all is part of when when World War One stopped in 1918 it was because God had to also seal their Jews amen and eventually he had to use Mussolini Hitler Stalin to get them back into their Homeland and therefore all those things were used to get the Jews back into the Homeland the start of this Russian war what came out from what was one of the things that was seen to die from the spirit that the Jews was going back amen why every time you mention a war this major was now the Jews is World War One Jews are going back World War II Jews going back coming to world war three Jews are going back yes amen you see what I'm saying so on this Exodus on this Third Exodus Journey amen some have gone Souls under the altar gone off the scene but there are people right here now who left who are in now in that land in the land of inheritance amen but they have to now cultivate that land they have to prosper in the land amen because we don't God don't want stagnant Christian amen you know you become stagnant you leave the Holy Ghost outside he said no no I've settled now for message theology yeah I've settled now that I've received this word I'm I'm satisfied that all this world has been opened I'm satisfied we have the opening of the word but what are you doing with it amen you're in the land you're in the land of the Holy Ghost enjoying the word yes yes but are you cultivating the land is the land becoming fruitful yes yeah amen [Music] I say the Jews now in the Homeland waiting for the Feast of trumpets recognizing the atonement and to wait for the coming to mourn for the rejection of the first time they rejected it in the Homeland for that waiting everything is positionally pleased he says that in recognizing your day and message another quote he says now to see whether this message that we got is connected with it or not the very hour for him quoting from the 10 virgins and 144 000 joules in paragraph 94. Telegraph 93. now to see whether this message that means god is connected with it or not they're very hours that Israel was signed in to be a nation is it was the very same hour very same day very same month everything else I was a Green Mill Indiana when that angel there appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this after he had met me down in the river and told me what would take place then commissioned me 11 years later at the same hour that Israel was signing as a nation it's all connected together see the angel of the Lord is on earth now amen he's moving around fixing everything yes amen for the coming of the Lord so he's not only dealing with us he is dealing with politics he's dealing with Nations all those things and it's the same angel that heard the sin when they went down to Sodom yes the father said we've come down to see if these things are so what we have heard now the prophet after the opening of the world and the message was rejected and the people you know he said he could just go away and just live away you know away from the people he was disappointed because all the people stopped giving him invitation Stop opening doors because it was the opening of the world and he just wanted to go be in the wilderness and then one day he had this dream and when he had that he had the dream and uh he saw his brother-in-law who was like you know they call him a bum and by the end of the dream he realized that he was there too because the brother was saying we were saying him you did all this for me you took care of my children and everything now I'm you are here now let me look after him you know and the Lord was showing him that you lost your heart for the people you know and then he realized he said if you stay here you live you lose everything and the Lord rebuked him today and he had to go back amen and do the work of the Lord because he said now till he died he will do the work of the Lord because he said he said but Lord we got you know the opening of the word everything he said no no I must find the support I want to give it to you as he said yeah he said but that was the prop sorry he said you called me to be a prophet I want to live in the wilderness like the prophet you can go to the message standing in the gap paragraph paragraph 121 3120 and I said I don't want to have to live like that want to do something different he said and I want you to live in the world and I want to live in the wilderness like the prophet but I was using my own excuse so I could honest my own good 121 And he said but then what the prophets of the Old Testament you've been called to be there in a much higher office than that he said you have more gifts besides that he said you were called to pray for the sick and to preach the gospel and in the apostolic form people are still looking for one man Apostle to rely on you see what these Ministry was done and in the apostolic form you know of greater thing many great many great gifts he said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where is your reward you know said do you remember I told you do you remember what brother Robertson told you in your dream in his dream or vision that you had done like Moses you forgot the feeling of your people you forgot the call that I called you to I let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to that's wrong I had built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and God forbid that I'll try to compare the life of Moses like now but it's exactly what Moses did the people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver them so he just left them alone and went into the Wilderness but God turned him around and he had long forgot the suffering people and I said Lord I'll put this right with no education with a grammar school education and the people would stand in rows and everywhere to hear the simple gospel the greater now that under the whole Covenant he said on eye and gave gifts unto men Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he's talking to bully Paul or whatever in 126 he said he said then he's talking about the dream now about having a dream about his and he looked at me kind of he talking about Billy Paul is telling him but and he said oh I want to tell you something I Dreamed a Dream not long ago you remember seeing that guy that looked like me and pledged ask Mother whether you could go you get back to Tucson I told her this dream and Bully there is something happening it's going on now something was talking to me I thought it was you he looked at me kind of strange I waited a little bit we were driving on so a few minutes he went back to sleep and I was driving along thinking about what could that mean driving along Riding Road and all at once he ate come talking to me again and he said return did not I tell you in the beginning to do the work of an evangelist when I called you down on the river did not I say as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming wasn't John more than a prophet Jesus said so himself what to go on to see a prophet more than a prophet then it began to come to me he reminded me again of the people so you see what happened there so what I'm trying to tell you in this now we have the opening of the word I mean you fail the regard enough and we feel that now we we're just waiting now for under our ministry under the third pole but he's saying he's saying to the prophet you are more important more than that all these things are given to you and because you got Pentecost plus amen amen so we can't be satisfied say we got the opening of the world will wait for the Lord to say move but there's other things to do all the gifts to operate in the church all these things are given unto us because he who receive the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward yes amen amen and some sometimes you feel that we we have an air of ourselves God has shown us all these things and we are saved we wait in the Rapture and we lose the compassion for the loss yes God is speaking to us in this eleventh hour yes this 11th our workers do not lose your compassion for the loss amen yes right till the day go on the cross even on the cross spoke to the game the opportunity for the person on the cross to come with him in Paradise the prophet till they leave the scene amen continued the work of the Gospel tell me where one quote where the Prophet said we must stop going out and evangelizing tell me where the property must stop praying for the sick because we have now I have the opening of the world tell me where he said we must stop it but look at what the Lord said to him but the angel of the Lord said to him you are not just like the normal Prophets amen you are dead but you have all these gifts amen and now all what did Jesus say greater things than this ye shall do amen that's all for the 11th Hour this is for the body of Christ because Christ now is Christ now is represented by a body amen Christ is here on Earth again represented by a body but if the body doesn't produce Jesus Christ then how is the people going to see the power of the Resurrection because that is the testimony of Jesus Christ here he rose again yes there is not dead there is a living God Amen and the testimony of the Resurrection is to say that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Unleashed upon the Earth upon people and we're walking around and those demons are not feeling nothing amongst us those demons need to leave you say whatever you bite on Earth shall be bound on every amen whatever you lose an Earth shall be loosed in heaven you're speaking about this guy Danny Henry one time and one day he started to he came to the prophet and he and he just started speaking in tongue he threw his arms around the prophet he said God bless you brother Branham he said I hope this don't sound direct sacrilegious but my way of seeing it that message could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation and when he said that he started speaking tongues amen and a body would never even heard of such a thing because he was a Baptist there by denomination you know the battles don't believe in the gifts of the Holy Spirit and he turned white and looked at me he didn't know what to do these men sitting here was there so you know they will interpret the word what it meant it said now here is what he said because Dao has chosen the narrow part the other way that always walked in your own children now I can see Moses had to make his choice too now that has picked me precise and correct way correct decision and it is my will underline my way the Holy Spirit speaking back yeah so this is not an easy way to come back to the altar again to come back under consecration to come back under his way I'm not talking about I'm talking about the Holy Spirit now under to fall under his way not the easy way is not the easy Road but you got to make the choice each one of us going to make the choice individually amen the pastor might preach it preachers May preach it but they can't make the choice for you yeah in your home your parents can't make the choice for you amen amen you gotta make the choice individually whether you're gonna take this way to go with the Lord despise you because in this way you're going to be mocked I'm talking about now when you got Bowlers now and you prophesied again now in the 11th Hour when you're prophesying of who you are amen where you come from yes what type of people you are and you're walking and you're telling the people what food they're living in the world when you have that bonus you're going to be mocked you're going to be scorned and the coming a time where the living shuttles down because we're going to speak things against the certain condition because right now America becomes you know America is the mouthpiece for Rome [Music] you know what the what what the pope said recently the the gay rights and so forth must be legalized and what is America doing they're going on to other nations African nations and so forth and criticizing them for bringing laws against these things they are forcing their laws onto other nations who don't want to have these things in a country yes amen and while they're doing the treating them with sanctions yeah and they can do that because why who controls all the wealth Rome controlled all the wealth and right now the other nations are they realize that these are ungodly things we don't want these things but they forcing them they're trying to now Flex their muscles and tell them you don't do this we will give you sanctions the indirectly they're telling them we will give you sanctions we won't give you funding and so forth so you see whatever we're living in [Music] now you know the prophet now he was Associated his life in his own life he was associated with God showing this the Seven Peaks amen he saw the mountain and he saw the caps on it the white kept on the mountains amen he said he stopped and looked and he seen seven years he said there were Seven Peaks on top of the mountain one mountain that ran from several miles and he said the last Mountain before you go okay let's go let's get the quote so you can all see it standing in the Gap let's take it from [Music] let's take it from 139 telling the gift from paragraph 139 he said now when is Billy and I started on down the road started going down the road but he went to sleep again and he and he said I'll give you an everlasting sign yes and I said Lord what I waited a little bit and nothing happened I said what is the Everlasting sign Lord and I waited a few minutes and just did I looked over to see Billy he was asleep and he said I'll give you an everlasting sign he said look Westward from where you're at and I turned my head like this in the trunk in the trunk to look slow down you know and oh my the spirit of the Lord I felt like I could scream and cry you know when the spirit of the Lord comes in you know you know that feeling you can't contain yourself and I looked and I just saw a mountain or white caps on it I said I don't know see no Everlasting sign about that he said your name is wrote all over it okay I thought what is that and I got real weak and I started stopping and Bully raised up and said what's the matter with you and I pulled my my hands like this perspiration dropping off my hand and it's snowing I said bully something is happening and at one time I know we have done wrong I know that I feel God and looked like I could hear that song being sung and see thousands of mixed people lame or blind with it here they call your voice of some great renowned Voice singing unclean unclean the evil spirit drove drove him then Jesus came the capital city I could see the sick line laying everywhere I had to stop bully didn't know what was taking place and I look up and I stopped and I looked up on the mountain and I saw those Seven Hills now yeah if you want to see something there were Seven Peaks on top of a mountain one mountain that ran for several miles the last Mountain before you go into the other country no more Mountains after that and it was running from east to the West the mountain said it was no kept on top the first two small pigs and then a large Peak and then another small Peak and then a larger Peak and then a small Peak and then a great large Long snow-capped Mountain and I said Lord I do not understand what it means he said how many Peaks there I said the seven how many letters in your name seven right and then there was three outstanding Peaks he said those three picks are the first second and third pull yes the first one of your first part of your ministry is smaller in your first pool pretty high you know sign in the hand then there was a little interval in there the time that I was taken off from being too tired many of you remember it and then come the discernment the second port now add another about a few years of just kind of little Peak sea that like in Ministry wasn't here and then come the third one three is a number of completion the third one the next Peak was five names Grace and the next was seven the number of perfection six days shall you labor the seventh is the seventh the end of the week now what he said here after the seventh after that seventh week it was no more Mountains it takes you to another country amen amen the other there's another code where he says it takes you into eternity amen the Continental Divide amen so there was from the last Mountain he takes you to another country in the 11th Hour Work is associated with the third pool amen amen speak to the mountain Amen in that time there's no other pool there's no other Mountain amen because from there it's gonna take you to Eternity amen yes amen amen there's no pool after that this is the hour of the Deadpool amen and from here it takes you now to the land that we all been waiting for amen the land that we're preaching about amen take you from this Dimension to the other dimension to come into that mountain that last Mountain what fit you're gonna have hallelujah amen you've got to have rapturing faith amen that's what the seven Thunders come to do to give you rapturing faith because under this third pool comes the opening of the word yeah without Revelation you cannot do nothing yeah without Revelation you might come and believe this message come in you might die you might go under the altar but without whatever without this Revelation you can't have that body change you can't go into the rapture so understandable comes the opening of the word it comes to Spirit speaking to the souls that are lost in prison now because it's our way he that is Holy be holy still he that will be filthy be filthy still and he's also preaching it also to the power of the spoken word that's the hour that we're living in the 23rd hour on the clock amen call and seal in this hour amen amen with the same pay as the first workers amen must produce that that person said the property to produce the 23rd book chapter of Revelation but we are said to produce another book of Acts amen amen that is scripture that is what the prophet said there must be another amen because to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever

such a marvelous calling amen amen amen amen no man has called us here but he has called us here amen the one that's come and received the king's sword amen so when you saw the changing in this in the season amen when you saw the beat changing amen you began to follow yes the beach amen there was there was a changing of the beach amen amen but this beat is coming to make us produce another book of Acts amen he said he said in one time he said about the third pool how it would come by this way knowing the heart and then the spoke with Jesus said greater things than this you will do so I go into my Father John 14. the work that I do shall do to also greater things than this I go on to my father a little while ago when Mary tried to identify him as Joseph said he corrected her his words cannot fail he said so Heaven and Earth will fails but my words will not amen when we hear the symphony be changing fixing to change it's a junction time what did you hear on first January 2023 amen it was

with you now in my closing I was on my way with the wife to the shop and the next day we we had a dog that was going to come home and this dog is a regular dog that we've kept for many years and is

our house he passed Union amen the first thing he started working his tail then he started eating then he started drinking water amen so I think she was trying to phone the lady to tell her what happened she didn't get all about you today and she came on before we could get home and she saw the dog is perfectly fine well I think I took a picture of the dog I think we must mention that it was a time there right yeah okay I think I was I think I was talking to brother even telling him the Testament then while he was telling me the testimony of the Joshua said ask him for a picture at home they sent me a picture why did I send me the picture then he identified the time with the picture hmm I can't remember now but it was associated with the 23 right the time was associated with that he was sending it to me I mean I just sent him the picture of the dog I didn't see it he saw it and he sent it to me he said did you see this and then yeah so now the lady took the dog home she's and she's the first thing she do she thanking God but you don't know what happened then the wife was telling you what happened so you see these are not things that we're talking about the time gone by
