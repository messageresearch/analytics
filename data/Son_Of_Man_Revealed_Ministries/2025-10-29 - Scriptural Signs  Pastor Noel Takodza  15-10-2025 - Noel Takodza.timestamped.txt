[3:50] want to sing this song. This is a very
[3:51] recent song and uh I know Adrian and his
[3:56] team, they play very good music and they
[3:57] sing well. But I know they could have
[3:59] done the song, but I'm going to sing it

[9:20] shalom, it's the rising of the Amen.
[9:22] It's a new day. It's a dawning of a new
[9:24] day. Amen. So we greet every one of you
[9:26] in the mighty name of our Lord and
[9:27] Savior Jesus Christ.

[10:18] behind.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; And you know, there are millions of
[10:21] people that have already sealed their
[10:23] fate.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; When they reject the message of the

[21:32] going to do a good job.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was telling him, "Yeah, you're
[21:37] going to work there."
[21:39] &gt;&gt; I've been there five times.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; He's good. Let him go. Pray for him.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; He's going to do a good job.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; So, even also the pastor, I believe when
[21:50] he comes back, he must go.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; But at the moment, we want him to come
[21:55] to Zimbabwe
[21:57] &gt;&gt; to finish his assignment.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; By God's grace, I believe you're happy
[22:03] to be in the house of the Lord. Amen.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, since it's midweek,
[22:07] we won't say much, but some few things
[22:09] just to encourage one another.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Since also I'm on holiday with my wife,
[22:14] if I preach something about holiday,
[22:17] &gt;&gt; just forgive me.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Elder, thank you for singing. I heard
[22:21] it. It was very good.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Keep on singing.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; I like good singing myself. You see,
[22:28] sometimes when I'm studying, if I hear
[22:29] somebody singing, I'll leave that one.
[22:31] Then I'll dance a little bit because I
[22:33] like singing.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you. May, let's stand as we
[22:38] open our Bibles. Matthew chapter 24.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Matthew 24.
[22:46] Your pastor is a very good pastor. He
[22:48] came to Zimbabwe. He preached very well
[22:51] in our churches. So they're still asking
[22:54] to come back to finish.
[22:58] Not to finish. You can't finish to
[23:00] preach Jesus Jesus Christ.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Just come and continue.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; When he's tired, he comes back and after
[23:08] some months you come back again. So we
[23:12] really appreciate his ministry. H we
[23:16] northerners. I don't know you sers but
[23:19] we northerners there. We really
[23:21] appreciate his ministry. Please when you
[23:23] hear him saying I'm going to Zimbabwe,
[23:25] please tell him go go quickly.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; We'll pray for you.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; So as the prophet says, if you pray for
[23:32] me, it's you who are who benefit.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; You see, if you pray for me, you'll be
[23:38] benefiting.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; So why can't you pray for me?
[23:41] &gt;&gt; You benefit. If you pray for him, it's
[23:43] who is benefiting.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; That's why you can hear the the the
[23:48] Bible says always let's pray for one
[23:49] another. Yes.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; So it's actually for you who be
[23:53] benefiting.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Are you there? Matthew 24.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. So the brothers, I didn't give you
[24:00] some my notes because I'm going to pick
[24:02] them there. So you have to forgive me.
[24:04] But I know you are a star
[24:07] to pick those quotations. You know,
[24:09] &gt;&gt; I won't preach anything else but what
[24:12] you believe here.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see remember your your
[24:19] the old pastor pastor Ron Genkin he used
[24:22] to be my friend.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; I always testify you know that.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; And
[24:27] my first reading classes is the one who
[24:31] what
[24:33] who who bought them for me.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; They're still there. You see?
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. Fine. Are we there? Amen.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Matthew 12:1.
[24:44] And Jesus And Jesus went out and
[24:47] departed from the temple, and his
[24:50] disciples came to him for to show him
[24:54] the buildings of the temple. Verse two.
[24:57] And Jesus said unto them, "See you not
[24:59] all these things? Very I say unto you,
[25:03] there shall be not be left here one
[25:05] stone upon another,
[25:07] &gt;&gt; that shall not be thrown down." Yeah.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Verse three.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; And as he sat upon the mount of olives,
[25:15] the disciples came unto him privately. I
[25:20] like that.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; They came to him
[25:23] &gt;&gt; privately.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Others they've gone.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; But they said let's go to him privately.
[25:30] They wanted to ask other things. Now he
[25:33] says tell us saying tell us there there
[25:37] are three questions there as you see
[25:40] &gt;&gt; they wanted to ask these three
[25:41] questions. He says tell us when shall
[25:44] these things be? First question.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Number two. And what shall be the sign
[25:51] of thy coming?
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Question number two. Question number
[25:55] three. And of the end of the world.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless these word. You may
[26:03] take your seats.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; You can hear no uh these disciples
[26:12] asking these three questions.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; I was telling where I preached on Sunday
[26:17] about this that I I had some months
[26:21] preaching about the three questions.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to preach about three
[26:25] questions.
[26:26] I'm just going to let's fellowship all
[26:29] of us together about the scriptural
[26:31] signs.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[26:33] &gt;&gt; you see about the scriptural signs. We
[26:35] might not finish but I'll pick there
[26:37] what the prophecy about the scriptural
[26:39] signs but basing on these questions
[26:43] maybe you can base on one of it. What
[26:45] shall be the sign of thy coming? Not
[26:48] exactly on into that
[26:51] &gt;&gt; but just to look into scriptural signs.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Either of our DAY OR WHATEVER ANY
[26:59] scriptural sign
[27:01] &gt;&gt; the meaning of the meaning of any
[27:03] scriptural sign.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; How do you interpret it?
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; How do you view it?
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Because there are many signs. But as a
[27:14] Christian or AS A MESSAGE BELIEVER, YOU
[27:17] MUST BE IN A position
[27:19] &gt;&gt; to interpret any scriptural sign.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; EITHER IT'S OF GOD OR IT'S NOT OF GOD.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SUPPOSED IN A position
[27:28] &gt;&gt; to interpret.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; That's why the disciples came to him
[27:32] privately.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; ASKING THOSE THREE QUESTIONS
[27:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY they were they are very
[27:38] important questions here.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this?
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. When shall these things be?
[27:46] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT SHALL BE THE SIGN OF THY
[27:48] COMING?
[27:49] &gt;&gt; YES.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; But he was there.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU REMEMBER HE WAS PREACHING ABOUT
[27:53] HIS COMING.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; YES.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; His death and resurrection.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; And his coming.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; But they asking, "What is the SIGN OF
[28:02] THY COMING?"
[28:04] &gt;&gt; BUT WERE THEY NOT WITH HIM?
[28:07] &gt;&gt; They were with him.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; YES.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IS THE SIGN
[28:10] OF THY COMING. YOU SEE AND THE END OF
[28:14] THE WORLD.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; YES,
[28:16] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE END.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOING TO BE THE SIGN? THE SIGN OF
[28:20] the end of THE WORLD. THEY WANTED TO
[28:22] KNOW ALL THOSE THINGS.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; YES.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; As I was saying
[28:26] on Sunday,
[28:28] &gt;&gt; you know in our country maybe you have
[28:30] heard also here the audio that was going
[28:33] on around on this social media of that
[28:36] is it a prophetist whatever she was
[28:38] telling people about the end of the
[28:40] world. Yeah,
[28:41] &gt;&gt; in 3 days whatever darkness whatever
[28:43] what you are saying but I'm still here
[28:46] &gt;&gt; and you still there
[28:50] &gt;&gt; so that's why I'm saying HOW IMPORTANT
[28:52] THESE questions were. Yes.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Because the
[28:58] CHRIST KNEW THAT ALL THESE PERSONS you
[29:00] are going to meet them.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU GO down
[29:05] with this chapter
[29:07] &gt;&gt; of Matthew 24 FROM VERSE ONE UP TO THE
[29:11] END,
[29:12] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE WHY the disciples they asked
[29:15] these questions.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; And after that Christ, HE WAS TELLING
[29:19] them
[29:20] &gt;&gt; about false Christ.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; False prophets,
[29:25] &gt;&gt; isn't it? So,
[29:27] &gt;&gt; yes.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; AND ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT THE END,
[29:31] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE CAREFUL. AND ALSO, IF you
[29:34] &gt;&gt; if you read
[29:36] &gt;&gt; the sixth seal,
[29:38] &gt;&gt; OUR PROPHET,
[29:40] &gt;&gt; HE WAS PARDONING MATTHEW 24 with the
[29:43] sixth seal.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, what was happening here?
[29:46] &gt;&gt; You can see it in the sixth seal.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yeah,
[29:51] &gt;&gt; I I don't have time to go there,
[29:53] &gt;&gt; but I'm just trying to tell you
[29:55] something about the signs
[29:57] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; As I'm standing here, I'm a sign.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; You have teachers here. If you got a
[30:09] teacher,
[30:10] &gt;&gt; when a teacher stand in front of
[30:13] students,
[30:14] &gt;&gt; according to the students is a sign.
[30:17] Yeah.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; They're expecting something from a
[30:20] teacher, A VOICE
[30:22] &gt;&gt; FOR HIM TO STAND THERE IS A SIGN.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; IF A TEACHER JUST GO AND stand like
[30:28] this,
[30:29] looking the students like this,
[30:34] &gt;&gt; what going to be the answer of the
[30:35] students?
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; According to them is a sign.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; They want to write exams. They want to
[30:42] pass. But they they went to school and
[30:46] the sign is dumb. He can't speak
[30:51] that. Amen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's start our thing. I I just
[30:57] give you some few tips so that we won't
[30:59] finish in the message scriptural science
[31:02] of the time. Brother uh let's go. That
[31:05] was pre 1964 7410
[31:08] paragraph 22. You see what the prophet
[31:12] is saying about these signs?
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Ah thank you Esther. I told you
[31:22] &gt;&gt; God gives signs.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? Scriptural
[31:26] &gt;&gt; signs.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Scriptural signs of a voice. You see
[31:31] remember when Moses Was
[31:35] WAS A SIGN GIVEN FOR? WHAT? What's a
[31:38] sign given for? What was a sign given
[31:40] for?
[31:42] The the PURPOSE OF A SIGN. WHAT IS THE
[31:44] PURPOSE OF A SIGN IS IS TO attract
[31:47] &gt;&gt; attention.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Any sign either natural
[31:52] &gt;&gt; or spiritual
[31:54] &gt;&gt; is there to attract your attention.
[31:59] If you are driving, even if you see a
[32:01] natural billboard,
[32:04] &gt;&gt; yes,
[32:04] &gt;&gt; telling you that there's stairs 5
[32:08] kilometers
[32:10] &gt;&gt; is there to attract whose attention?
[32:12] &gt;&gt; YOUR ATTENTION.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SIGN.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Like if you IF IF YOU GO IF YOU KNOW
[32:18] WHAT THE dictionary says
[32:23] describing a sign says it's an event. M
[32:27] &gt;&gt; that is experienced as indicating
[32:30] important things
[32:32] &gt;&gt; to come.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; It was A SIGN FROM GOD.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; IT WAS A SIGN FROM HEAVEN.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; YES.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; That's a sign.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER A SIGN YOU MIGHT SEE
[32:46] &gt;&gt; EITHER NATURAL or
[32:49] &gt;&gt; scripture
[32:52] &gt;&gt; is there to draw your attention. Yes.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT ATTENTION MEANS A LOT.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; YES.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY EVEN IN THE SCRIPTURES,
[33:06] &gt;&gt; you know, there was a scripture says how
[33:09] retest
[33:12] &gt;&gt; you MUST KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THOSE
[33:14] SIGNS.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Especially scriptural signs. You must
[33:19] know HOW TO INTERPRETATE.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; HOW DID THE STAR message believe us?
[33:23] &gt;&gt; How did the star bride? Amen.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Says is to ATTRACT
[33:27] ATTENTION. A SIGN IS TO ATTRACT
[33:30] ATTENTION.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; BUT IF THE SIGN DOESN'T HAVE ANY VOICE,
[33:34] &gt;&gt; THEN THE SIGN is not right.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; It might be a GOOD SIGN, BUT WITHOUT A
[33:41] VOICE,
[33:43] &gt;&gt; without a message,
[33:45] &gt;&gt; THAT SIGN IS NOT GOOD.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S SOMETHING DUMB.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST IGNORE THAT. YEAH.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; You see, THEN THE SON IS NOT LIKE AND IF
[33:58] THE SON GIVE THE SAME ODD ECCLESIASTICAL
[34:02] VOICE,
[34:03] &gt;&gt; that sign isn't from God.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; IF THAT VOICE HASN'T GOT a change,
[34:08] &gt;&gt; and that change must be scriptural sign.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Must be scriptural voice.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Let's go to part four. Our pick out of
[34:24] 40 super sign
[34:26] super the super this super sign that was
[34:28] pre 1963
[34:32] 1129. Amen. You you you have heard the
[34:35] prophet say about a sign.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Is that so attractive attention?
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's see here
[34:45] what about in the message super sign
[34:48] paragraph 40. Let's see what the
[34:50] prophecy about these signs where
[34:52] remember let's concern about scriptural
[34:54] signs
[34:54] &gt;&gt; you see sometimes we waste our time by
[34:59] going to the negative all of THE TIME
[35:01] SAYS PROPHETS ARE THE CHIEF
[35:03] &gt;&gt; SIGN
[35:04] &gt;&gt; AMOS 3
[35:06] &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT DO ANYTHING
[35:08] &gt;&gt; UNLESS HE REVEALED HIS SECRET TO
[35:11] &gt;&gt; THE 70 PROPHETS
[35:13] &gt;&gt; SO AS WE ARE SPEAKING PROPHETS ARE THE
[35:16] CHIEF side
[35:18] &gt;&gt; is So
[35:21] &gt;&gt; CHIEF GOD'S CHIEF SIDE IS A PROPHET.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; NOW I'M GOING TO SPEAK A FEW MINUTES
[35:26] ABOUT THAT. BUT HIS WORD MADE manifest
[35:29] &gt;&gt; for that age.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; And that's THE REASON A PROPHET IS
[35:33] ALWAYS GOD'S CHILDREN SHINE.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY EVEN MALACHI 4 AS WE ARE
[35:38] SITTING HERE
[35:39] &gt;&gt; IS IT CLEAR TO US?
[35:42] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID I
[35:46] &gt;&gt; WILL SEND
[35:48] &gt;&gt; YOU
[35:49] ELIJAH.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; YES.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; He's not sending to everyone.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; To you.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; It's you and your prophet.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet to you.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Behold, I sent you.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; A chief sign.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; That chief sign must be scriptural.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF THAT CHIEF SIGN IS NOT
[36:14] SCRIPTURE THAT'S WHY MATTHEW 24 IF YOU
[36:16] GO DOWN WITH it as I said you can HEAR
[36:20] CHRIST SPEAK ABOUT FALSE Christ
[36:24] &gt;&gt; as you know all the prophet teaches when
[36:26] you hear the word Christ means anointed
[36:29] &gt;&gt; don't a false
[36:32] &gt;&gt; A FALSE ANOINTED ONE FALSE CHRIST IS
[36:34] SOMEBODY WHO IS ANOINTED
[36:36] &gt;&gt; YES
[36:37] &gt;&gt; IT IS A SIGN TO THE PEOPLE
[36:38] &gt;&gt; YES
[36:39] &gt;&gt; FOR FALSE ANOINTED
[36:41] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A SIGN IS ATTRACTING PEOPLE.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT SIGN IS IN SCRIPTURE.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; YES.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Are you GETTING THAT NOW?
[36:50] &gt;&gt; FALSE PROPHETS. HOW MANY PROPHETS YOU
[36:53] HAVE TODAY?
[36:54] &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SIGNS ALL OVER
[36:56] &gt;&gt; ATTRACTING PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ARE
[36:59] FOLLOWING THAT.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SIGN TO THEM.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; BUT WE WE ARE MEASURING TONIGHT ON THE
[37:07] SCRIPTURAL SIGNS.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE. WE ARE HERE
[37:11] BECAUSE OF A SCRIPTURE SIGN.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; GOD SENT A PROPHET IN OUR GENERATION.
[37:17] [Applause]
[37:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[37:28] here because of the shout.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Together the what?
[37:33] &gt;&gt; SAINTS, HERE WE ARE BECAUSE OF THE
[37:35] SHOUT.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD SENT A PROPHET.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ACHIEVE SIGN
[37:41] &gt;&gt; IN OUR DAY WITH A SCRIPTURAL VOICE.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; AND WE could see
[37:46] &gt;&gt; that sign it attracted
[37:49] &gt;&gt; our attention.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we are here.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Because you have been attracted by that
[37:57] sign.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; SEE, THERE ARE HIS WORD MANIFEST.
[38:03] Where are we?
[38:05] Okay, let's go. And that's THE REASON A
[38:08] PROPHET IS ALWAYS A CHIEF SIGN. HE HAS
[38:10] NEVER SENT A judgment upon the earth
[38:12] without first sending a prophet.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Just see and search the scriptures.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; A prophet is the chief sign OF GOD TO
[38:21] HIS PEOPLE that he has sent
[38:27] this person.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; This certain person like Noah, like
[38:31] Moses, and Elijah and the prophets. HE
[38:34] SENT THEM TO MANIFEST THE WAY FOR THAT
[38:39] &gt;&gt; TO GIVE HIS PEOPLE A
[38:41] &gt;&gt; WARNING.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER MOSES? WHAT HAPPENED TO MOSES?
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Moses saw the burning bush.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; It was a sign.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; The bush was burning
[38:54] &gt;&gt; but not being consumed.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; It was a sign.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; But behind that sign,
[39:00] &gt;&gt; there's a voice.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WAS A SIGN FIRST.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES WHEN HE SAW THE SIGN WHAT HIS
[39:09] ATTENTION
[39:10] &gt;&gt; YES.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; was what?
[39:13] &gt;&gt; It brought his attention.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; And he looked at that sign.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; He was waiting FOR SOMETHING.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; A SCRIPTUAL SIGN.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; OKAY. Let's go, brother. Let's go. Let's
[39:24] go. First one, brother. Let's go. This
[39:26] one. Christ is identified
[39:30] the same in all generations.
[39:33] 64 0415
[39:36] you see
[39:38] let's go 21
[39:44] AND THEN EVERY son
[39:48] has a voice oh brother this one hey you
[39:50] must come to my church my brother why
[39:53] are you here brother
[39:56] you want me to hire you
[40:00] listen to thism
[40:02] Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; AND THEN EVERY SIGN HAS A VOICE BEHIND
[40:06] IT.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES
[40:09] SAW THE SIGN,
[40:11] &gt;&gt; HE WAS WAITING FOR THE VOICE.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY YOU YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT
[40:16] YOU HAVE READ BEFORE. A SIGN WITHOUT A
[40:18] VOICE. WHAT DO you
[40:20] &gt;&gt; It's not good.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MOSES SAW THE SIGN, HE WAS
[40:26] WAITING FOR THE VOICE.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; AND THE VOICE CAME.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; YES.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:32] AND THE VOICE CAME
[40:34] &gt;&gt; AND MOSES WAS COMMISSIONED BY GOD
[40:36] &gt;&gt; TO GO TO
[40:39] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A VOICE.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; I have come
[40:44] &gt;&gt; to deliver my
[40:45] &gt;&gt; people.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; That's why Moses
[40:48] &gt;&gt; when he saw the sign and the voice spoke
[40:52] &gt;&gt; when he went to Pharaoh
[40:53] &gt;&gt; he was so courageous
[40:55] &gt;&gt; because he knew that that was a
[40:57] scripture.
[40:59] And when when he was talking to Pharaoh,
[41:02] &gt;&gt; he didn't say please, please. He says,
[41:04] "No, no. Let my people
[41:09] &gt;&gt; because he knew what he was doing. It
[41:11] was scripture."
[41:12] &gt;&gt; He had a voice. He saw a sign, a script
[41:16] sign. And behind THAT SCRIPT SIGN, THERE
[41:18] WAS A VOICE.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY TONIGHT, BROTHER, SISTER,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; WE HAD THE VOICE. AMEN.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE GATHERED US HERE.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE CAN SHOUT AND DANCE.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Are you following that? THE SAME IT MUST
[41:41] BE A SCRIPTURE SIGN AND THEN THE SIGN IS
[41:44] ACCOMPANIED BY A VOICE LIKE MOSES
[41:47] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WENT DOWN IN EGYPT. THE VOICE OF
[41:49] THE FIRST SIDE, THE FORCE OF THE SECOND
[41:51] SIDE, AND EVERY GREAT thing that happens
[41:54] with God that gives a sign,
[41:57] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A VOICE FOLLOWS THAT SIGN.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; SCRIPTURAL,
[42:03] &gt;&gt; NOT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT SCRIPTURAL.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL DO HAVE ALSO SIGNS,
[42:07] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SIGN OF THE DEVIL THOUGH PEOPLE
[42:10] ARE BEING ATTRACTED, BUT THEY'RE NOT
[42:12] SCRIPTURE.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; YES.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; They're not scripture.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE
[42:21] &gt;&gt; AS GOD CALLED US,
[42:23] &gt;&gt; WE MUST BE IN A POSITION TO DISCERN.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; YES.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; And to know
[42:29] &gt;&gt; this is scriptural signs
[42:32] &gt;&gt; and scriptural voices.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Like Jonah when he was delivered from
[42:40] the battle of of the world, that was a
[42:43] sign.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; THEN HIS VOICE WAS REPAIRED. YEAH.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; IN 40 DAYS YOU YOU PERISH.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS ALWAYS A VOICE GOING WITH
[42:54] THE
[42:56] &gt;&gt; A VOICE GOES WITH THE
[42:57] &gt;&gt; SAME.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Brother
[43:03] 110.
[43:05] Let's just skip a lot of things. The
[43:07] voice of the sign 64 0214
[43:12] 0214
[43:15] 110. Let's go. They see Jonah there.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; And the prophet say Jonah was a sign.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; See, let me go FOR ONE THING. JONAH THE
[43:26] PROPHET WAS A SIGN.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; HIS SIGN WAS WHEN HE spit the world spit
[43:33] him out
[43:34] &gt;&gt; upon the bank.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; That was a sign.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Then people were he
[43:40] &gt;&gt; fished for a living.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Are you getting that?
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SEEN THE WORLD GOD COME IN
[43:48] &gt;&gt; THIS GOD OF THE SEA
[43:50] &gt;&gt; AND TAKE THE PROPHET AND SPIT HIM OUT
[43:53] upon the BANK
[43:55] &gt;&gt; TO GIVE THE MESSAGE
[43:57] &gt;&gt; AND DOWN THE BANK HE WENT
[44:00] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS THE signh the fish was the
[44:03] sign
[44:04] &gt;&gt; coming.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; They used to worship a ship a a fish
[44:08] god.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY SAW THAT SIGN COMING
[44:11] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE VERY HAPPY. BUT BEHIND EVERY
[44:14] SIGN THERE'S a
[44:16] &gt;&gt; that THERE'S A
[44:17] &gt;&gt; THE VOICE MUST BE
[44:20] &gt;&gt; the voice must be
[44:22] &gt;&gt; scripture.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Are you getting that?
[44:24] &gt;&gt; SO THEY SAW THE SIGN COMING
[44:27] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE HAPPY BECAUSE THEY USED TO
[44:29] WORSHIP A FISH GOD.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THEM IT WAS A SIGN
[44:34] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE WAITING and that sign
[44:36] attracted them.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; YES.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT BEHIND THAT SIDE THERE WAS A
[44:43] VOICE.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE VOICE? REPAIR AND PER OR
[44:51] PERISH
[44:52] &gt;&gt; BEFORE GOD STRUCK THAT NATION
[44:55] &gt;&gt; TO TEAR IT TO PIECES AND sing it beneath
[44:58] the sea.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; HE SENT A PROPHET WITH HIS VOICE. HE
[45:02] GAVE A SIGN, A SUPERNATURAL
[45:06] SIGHT.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; They repented. All of them. M
[45:12] &gt;&gt; because of the scriptural sign

[45:21] voice.

[45:32] &gt;&gt; but are they scriptural?

[54:30] &gt;&gt; But if are you scriptural
[54:33] &gt;&gt; or you're just a sign,
[54:35] &gt;&gt; a false one,

[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Beware of him.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Blah blah blah. You can go go ahead
[1:08:17] brothers.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT WHAT ARE WE SAYING?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[1:08:23] There
[1:08:25] there is sign
[1:08:27] 167 brother 167. Okay brother let's
[1:08:30] let's go two 224 2 41 2 41 2 41 brother
[1:08:37] uh the spoken word is the original seed.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not explaining much.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the original seed.
[1:08:49] Amen. Listen to this now.
[1:08:52] What is the city?
[1:08:59] The spoken word is original city.
[1:09:02] Uh I think brother it might be a
[1:09:05] different um
[1:09:09] this 62 0318 the spoken word is what
[1:09:14] part of 241 according to my mind here
[1:09:18] says now there's been three different
[1:09:21] kinds of seed planted
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; are getting that now
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; right let's go a denominational
[1:09:31] there
[1:09:33] different of course.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; See now there's been three different
[1:09:38] kinds of seed planted
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; A DENOMINATIONAL
[1:09:43] by Billy Graham.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; He was a sign
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; to this denominational system
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; and THE PROPHET SAYING HE WAS THE HEAD
[1:09:52] PLUNDER.
[1:09:54] HE'S A
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; A BIG FOLLOWING AND THERE'S A BIG
[1:09:58] FOLLOWING BUT HE WAS THE HEAD PLUNDER of
[1:10:00] this denominational system.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? Was it not a sign?
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And with a voice behind
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; that's why it was blinding. You see
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; he was hit by all over us for the
[1:10:16] Pentecostals SINCE PENTECOST HAS BEEN
[1:10:19] ALSO PLANTED.
[1:10:24] I'M TALKING ABOUT ORGANIZATION NOW.
[1:10:26] SINCE THEN THE WORD HAS BEEN ALSO
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; PLANTED.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; PLANTED.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; There are three seats. That's why THERE
[1:10:33] ARE THREE SEEDS.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THOSE HEAD PLANTERS.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; The one who PLANTED THE DENOMINATIONAL
[1:10:39] ONE is
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; the ONE WHO PLANTED THE PENTECOSTAL IS
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO PLANTED THE WORD IS who
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; William
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; but must have fition time or heaven's
[1:10:54] time.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Could have been planted.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; I see. AMEN.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; THOSE WERE SIGNS. YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE
[1:11:03] SAID? PROPHETS ARE CHIEF
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; SIGNS. BUT WHAT WAS HE NOT A SIGN TO THE
[1:11:08] DENOMINATION?
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Was he not?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; ROBERT WAS SIGNED TO THE PENTECOSTAL.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; UP TO NOW THEY DOING WONDERS. WHATEVER
[1:11:17] ALL THOSE THINGS,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Behind every
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; scriptural
[1:11:25] behind every sign, there's his voice
[1:11:28] behind.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:31] You see now let's go. I'm talking. Okay,
[1:11:33] let's go. See, say stop. You have two.
[1:11:36] Understand, folks. I am saying this no
[1:11:40] more unless God tells me.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to get this good and clear.
[1:11:45] Three seeds have been
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; planted. Let's go, brother. Next
[1:11:48] chapter. THAT'S THE REASON THE PLANTING
[1:11:51] IS ABOUT OVER. SEE, IT'S ALL OVER. SEEDS
[1:11:55] MUST BE planted before rain falls. Yeah,
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; that's right. Say otherwise THE SPIRIT
[1:12:02] NOW YOU ARE GOING TO disagree there but
[1:12:05] hold on just a minute seeds must be
[1:12:09] planted and then the rainforce
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; to water the seed. Is that right?
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; I think you can see what happened now.
[1:12:18] IS THERE ANYBODY IN HERE THAT
[1:12:21] UNDERSTANDS Hebrew laws Hebrew words?
[1:12:25] All right. You you look it if
[1:12:30] you want to. Now we are hearing so much
[1:12:34] and so many organizations
[1:12:36] and everything else talking about we are
[1:12:38] in the larger ring.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; This is nonsense.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; No such a thing. Oh, something is
[1:12:45] happening. I can just see it passing
[1:12:49] before me. IT'S DONE. CAUGHT THE SPIRIT.
[1:12:51] SEE, I MEAN, I know this is the truth.
[1:12:54] IT'S THUS SAYS THE LORD BY VISION. SEE,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; JUST MOVING
[1:12:59] COMING HARD LOOK DOWN HERE. NOW, you can
[1:13:03] see what the prophet is saying here. I I
[1:13:05] don't have time to go over all those.
[1:13:07] What what's next? Uh let's you see you
[1:13:11] can read it on your own. But what you
[1:13:13] are to see here, the seeds that have
[1:13:17] been planted, you've seen the way
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; some the denominational seed,
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal seed
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; and the word.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; who planted they were chief planters
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; who planted those seeds
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; AND WITH A VOICE BEHIND.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; NOW, HERE WE ARE. GOD SENT A PROPHET TO
[1:13:43] US
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; WHO PLANNED the word
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; the message of OUR DAY.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS ASSIGNED TO US
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; WITH A SCRIPTURE VOICE BEHIND.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; THAT'S why now we can see
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; the seed
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; is back again.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; The spoken word
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; is the original seed.
[1:14:07] What was there in the beginning
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; is speak again.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. What started in the beginning
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; is speak again.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; What was what Adam lost
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; is back again.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Because this message
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; is a message of restoration. Not a
[1:14:28] message of replacing. It's a of
[1:14:30] replacement. It's a message of
[1:14:33] restoration.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Jews wanted to see the
[1:14:39] sign. Oh, let me finish friends. Wow.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; How many minutes friends? 5 minutes.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; 5 minutes.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Sure. 5 minutes. We have got a lot of
[1:14:54] things. We can't finish this message.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Either I've got more whatever I can't.
[1:15:01] That's why we have five ministry.
[1:15:04] This one will preach whatever this one
[1:15:06] this one also comes. I'm not here to
[1:15:09] finish everything. You can't finish to
[1:15:10] preach Jesus Christ.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let me just this one
[1:15:15] then you see a super sign.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hey super sign you see. Okay
[1:15:24] still internal sign. Brother let's just
[1:15:28] find this one in the message 610117.
[1:15:31] Let me I'm just reading. I don't want to
[1:15:34] to to explain. Now, I BELIEVE THAT IN
[1:15:36] ISAIAH 9:6, WHEN ISRAEL had asked for a
[1:15:39] sign, God said, "I'll give them an
[1:15:42] everlasting sign,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; A SIGN, AN ETERNAL SIGN,
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; ONE THAT WILL be forever." SEE, A VIRGIN
[1:15:49] SHALL conceive
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; that will be a sign, and that one that
[1:15:56] will be born of her, his name shall be
[1:15:59] called counselor, the prince of peace,
[1:16:02] the mighty God, and the everlasting
[1:16:05] father. AND I BELIEVE that Jesus MET
[1:16:08] EVERY DESCRIPTION OF EVERY PROMISE THAT
[1:16:12] JEHOVAH made as the coming king and
[1:16:15] messiah.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE HE WAS A SIGN.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE JEWS ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR A
[1:16:21] SIGN.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; THE SIGN OF THE coming of the Messiah.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A SUPER SIGN. HE
[1:16:28] POSSESSED THE GATES.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; He possessed the gates. The super sign.
[1:16:33] He possessed the gates.
[1:16:36] Not only did he
[1:16:38] he he that but those who had died in
[1:16:42] faith he had he led captive captive
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; ascended on high
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; and gave gifts unto men.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; That's Abraham's super seed.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; That's the royal seed. JESUS CHRIST THE
[1:17:03] SUPER SIGN.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; YEAH. REMEMBER IT WAS AN EVERLASTING
[1:17:07] SIGN, A supernatural everlasting sign.
[1:17:10] Jesus was
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; he arose from the dead.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; They could not hold him. Death, hell, or
[1:17:18] the grave could not hold him.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; as I say, he is the same yesterday,
[1:17:25] today, and forever
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; to show
[1:17:29] this SUPER SIGN IN THIS AGE.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:34] AMEN.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Behind every sign there's a voice.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Let the voice be scripture.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; We are living in the age of science.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; For signs,
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; BUT MAY GOD HELP US.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO KNOW how to read and to
[1:17:56] interpret
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; these signs. Lord,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Which is scriptural voice. AMEN.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; SIGNS THAT CAN TAKE US TO THE WORD.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; VOICES THAT CAN TAKE US BACK TO THE
[1:18:11] WORD.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY EVEN THE PROPHET IN THAT
[1:18:14] VISION,
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; he screamed.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; HUH? THE BRIDE WAS DRIFTING.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; I believe THEY WERE LISTENING TO THAT
[1:18:22] OTHER VOICES.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SCREAMED. WHAT DID HE SAY? STAY
[1:18:27] IN LINE.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; STAY IN LINE.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ONCE IN LINE. BUT THEY STARTED
[1:18:32] DRIFTING. YOU KNOW THE WORD DRIFTING IS
[1:18:35] YOU CANNOT EASILY BE AWAY FROM THE LINE.
[1:18:39] No
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; you can go little by little.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT NOTICE IT.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE DRIFTING
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BRIDE WAS DRIFTING
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET IS OH STAY IN LINE.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Stay in line.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; We are in the time.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; We're in the end time.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; There are many signs.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. eh trying to deceive people.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; But we thank God in Matthew 24
[1:19:05] Jesus Christ with his disciples, what
[1:19:07] did he say?
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; If it were possible,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; the elect would be deceived. But it's
[1:19:13] NOT POSSIBLE.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; ALL THE SIGNS will come.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY WILL COME THE SIGNS
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER. BUT we have to know our
[1:19:24] we
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; as the prophet says,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; you as a message believer
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; part of six
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; in the message the ark.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; He said as amen
[1:19:39] we live in three elements.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; The humanistic element
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; the divine revelation.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the vision one
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; brother
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; the humanistic we don't want to stay
[1:19:54] there
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; oh thank you brother is him well now
[1:20:00] there's three element I've closed mine
[1:20:02] but he put it directly
[1:20:05] now there's three elements that people
[1:20:07] live in first is the humanistic
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; second is divine revelation
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; and the third is vision
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; brother you can dwell the whole night on
[1:20:17] the divine Revelation.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR WHEN YOU SEE A SIGN,
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; THAT SIGN whatever
[1:20:27] it might say that voice THAT SIGN MUST
[1:20:30] BE SCRIPTURE
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN A DIVINE REVELATION STRIKES
[1:20:34] YOU,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; you are part of that.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; WHEN A SCRIPTURE VOICE SPEAKS TO YOU,
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOD.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; HUH? WHEN
[1:20:46] GOD SPOKE TO MOSES,
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; HUH, WHEN HE SAW THE SIGN AND THE VOICE
[1:20:52] OF GOD SPOKE TO MOSES, WHAT HAPPENED?
[1:20:55] MOSES, HE KNEW THAT THIS IS GOD, nothing
[1:20:57] else.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE ALSO WITH THE BRIDE.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; We can't be deceived.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; In this day and age,
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; many voices are going over.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Some are even up to the extent of say,
[1:21:12] do you believe this sign? M
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; maybe you've heard of that
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; some going to that extent why do you
[1:21:21] BELIEVE THIS SIGN
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER I SAY
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; BEHIND EVERY SIGN
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; THEY say
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; a VOICE LET THAT VOICE BE SCRIPTURE
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; LET THAT VOICE BE IN LINE WITH THE WORD
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; FROM THE BIBLE FROM COVER TO COVER IF IT
[1:21:37] IS NOT PLEASE
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; WASH YOUR hands
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; and run away
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; run for your Yes.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Believe the sign. Tell me. Yes, I
[1:21:48] believe the chief sign
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; with a scriptural voice.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; What Moses saw
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; what happened to Jonah? What happened to
[1:21:56] Elijah? What happened to those who saw
[1:21:59] the signs and God spoke?
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; You see, not this make up many many
[1:22:04] things. What is going on now?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; You see, because of this fourth
[1:22:08] dimension, these YouTubes and so forth,
[1:22:10] they're giving us a lot of voices. Yes.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; A lot of signs which ARE NOT SCRIPTURE.
[1:22:16] DON'T FOLLOW THOSE THINGS.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Don't follow those things.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; They will GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DOUBT.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE says don't doubt.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; If you are doubt, you must doubt your
[1:22:27] doubts.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:56] Amen. God bless for you. Blessed for the
[1:22:58] word.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a good act of
[1:23:00] praise. Amen. Praise the Lord. You got a
[1:23:03] picture of the club.
[1:23:05] Amen. You know, the brother ended on
[1:23:09] that cloud.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; That was a sign.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; It's a sign, a true sign that's
[1:23:17] overlooked.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; And they say believe the sign. They
[1:23:23] started off with on a good note and they
[1:23:27] really believed the sign at that time.
[1:23:29] So here we got alpha cloud.
[1:23:32] Anyway, we need to get a full picture.
[1:23:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:36] But was it a scriptural sign?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; That's a question in line with the
[1:23:41] message. Now,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; this was a sign. It
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; was thrown up.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Remember, they add it the other way.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; There's the ground there.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; But was it a scriptural sign?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; But it takes a prophet to interpret that
[1:23:54] sign.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; So, being a scriptural prophet, he goes
[1:23:58] to the word to interpret that sign.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And he did this in 1962 before
[1:24:05] this picture was ever taken.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; So the sign that he sees in a vision is
[1:24:12] seven angels coming.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; In the form of a pyramid.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; So interpret that to interpret that
[1:24:18] seven angels coming in the form of a
[1:24:19] pyramid. He goes to Revelation 10.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; So he goes to Revelation 10 to interpret
[1:24:28] the sign of seven angels coming in the
[1:24:30] form of a pyramid.
[1:24:32] And then in 1963, this picture is taken.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; But it's an unfolding revelation.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; But now ask yourself the question, if
[1:24:41] it's a sign, where is the voice of the
[1:24:43] sign?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; A voice must follow the sign.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And if you go to Revelation 10, you'll
[1:24:49] hear voices.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; You'll hear one voice like a roaring
[1:24:53] like a lion and then seven voices
[1:24:55] follow.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; But that's a mystery to us. Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; So, we've heard the sign and the voice
[1:25:02] of the sign.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:25:07] the voice of the sign finally told the
[1:25:08] prophet, "Turn the picture to the
[1:25:11] right."
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And it is the rising of the sun.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; That's how we got this.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Turn the picture to the right. And what
[1:25:19] did he finally declare?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; That's our Lord.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; So the voice behind the sign declared
[1:25:27] that's the our Lord.
[1:25:29] Come on.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we as the bride become the
[1:25:35] final voice.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; This final age
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; to the final age.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; So who's the final sign in the final
[1:25:42] voice?
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; It's us.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. He says the
[1:25:46] prophet, he says the spirit, the prophet
[1:25:49] and the bride will be saying the same
[1:25:50] thing.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; The bride under a messenger becomes the
[1:25:53] final voice. Let's stand together. Give
[1:25:54] him praise. Give him glory.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Enoch.
[1:26:02] Sorry I didn't see you there. You're
[1:26:03] hiding all the way in the back. But
[1:26:04] thank you for the sacrifice for hosting
[1:26:06] our dear pastor and for bringing him to
[1:26:08] the service tonight. We pray the Lord
[1:26:10] will continue to bless you. Amen.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah. Let's just bow our heads and
[1:26:16] we sing. Have we got that song? Uh,
[1:26:19] signs of the time are everywhere.
