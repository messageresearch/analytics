[10:19] of this service it strengthens
[10:22] [Music]
[10:23] preparing us for what is to come yes
[10:26] what you have promised we accept it and
[10:29] we believe it in the wonderful name of
[10:31] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[10:39] like to invite you to go with me to the
[10:42] Book of Exodus
[10:45] chapter 14 I'd like to read
[10:51] from verse 13
[10:54] up to verse 15.
[10:57] so that's
[10:59] chapter 14.
[11:02] this is
[11:04] 13 to 15. amen amen
[11:09] um
[11:11] the Bible says
[11:13] from verse 18.
[11:16] and Moses said unto the people
[11:19] fear not
[11:21] stand still and see the salvation of the
[11:25] Lord hallelujah which he will show to
[11:27] you today for the Egyptians whom we have
[11:31] seen today ye shall see them again no
[11:35] more forever
[11:37] the Lord shall fight for you and ye
[11:40] shall hold your peace
[11:42] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[11:46] Christ thou unto me yes take unto the
[11:49] children
[11:50] that they go forward
[11:53] amen you may be seated amen
[11:58] may the Lord of his word amen
[12:02] we were reading Exodus 14 verses 13 up
[12:07] to 15. so I would like to kind of
[12:11] encourage one another yes as we wait for
[12:15] the change of our body
[12:17] but they are things that the prophet
[12:20] says we uh is Believers we should be
[12:26] able to come to that level before we can
[12:29] talk about the same
[12:31] hallelujah amen yes so we are going to
[12:35] be trying to dis to encourage one
[12:37] another
[12:38] so that you know because brother says
[12:40] God doesn't work with cowards yes
[12:42] absolutely amen so is we as the Church
[12:48] of God are cowards then we are
[12:51] guaranteed God is never going away with
[12:53] us amen
[12:55] so now we have a scenario that our
[12:58] brother or the prophet of that age Moses
[13:02] um is rebuked by God on verse 15. amen
[13:06] yes but um
[13:09] what surprised me with this one is that
[13:13] now God predicts brother Moses on verse
[13:16] 15. after the same brother Moses had
[13:20] encouraged the people on this 13 and 14.
[13:26] so how come
[13:29] that after he had preached A good sermon
[13:32] to encourage the church
[13:35] amen then he finds himself in an awkward
[13:39] situation where he's now scared of the
[13:43] same situation that he was encouraging
[13:44] that believer
[13:46] many a times that happens yes because
[13:49] God does test each and everyone I was
[13:54] telling Pastor Denzel that these days I
[13:56] I'm trying to be very careful in the
[13:58] sermons that I preach
[14:00] because I have discovered that God test
[14:04] me on every sermon that I preach every
[14:09] one of them absolutely so I better know
[14:11] what I'm talking about
[14:13] because after you preach about it yeah
[14:17] God is gonna make sure that you leave
[14:20] that way because the brother says I
[14:23] would rather you leave me a sinner than
[14:25] to preach me one yes amen I'd like to
[14:29] start by taking you to my first
[14:31] quotation which is found down in the
[14:34] book in the message why cry uh speak tip
[14:39] number six three zero seven one four m
[14:43] I'm in paragraph it's quite a long but
[14:46] I'm gonna be following it paragraph by
[14:47] paragraph I mean so that we don't get
[14:50] lost
[14:51] because
[14:52] um
[14:53] our Moses
[14:55] had already encouraged other believers
[14:58] but now God comes and say why are you
[15:01] crying yes he was now crying yes and God
[15:05] doesn't want to cry baby
[15:10] God does in one cry babies amen and it
[15:15] doesn't work with cowards yes and they
[15:18] say
[15:19] when the going gets tough yes the tough
[15:23] gets going
[15:25] so in this
[15:29] it's an hour
[15:30] is there are so many problems
[15:34] hair has been broken loose
[15:37] amen but the Bible says
[15:40] when the enemy comes in like a friend oh
[15:43] yes my spirit Hallelujah not your spirit
[15:47] his spirit is going to raise that place
[15:51] so there is no standard that we're gonna
[15:54] be raised by the enemy that God has not
[15:57] gotten a solution then he is already
[16:00] prepared for his people amen so he must
[16:04] not complain we must not cry we must
[16:08] never complain amen and says we must not
[16:11] complain amen now we find brother Moses
[16:16] [Music]
[16:17] here we see Moses expressing fully Human
[16:22] Nature
[16:23] always wants God to get behind you and
[16:27] push you into something
[16:30] now that's us today
[16:33] you want God to ask her after you will
[16:36] have seen you all we have seen
[16:40] after seeing the pillow fight amen after
[16:43] seeing the crowd
[16:45] we still want God to push you to do
[16:48] something
[16:49] he says you see Moses said just relaxed
[16:53] around
[16:54] which is what we've done relaxing
[16:57] God I will go ask you
[17:00] see what you say yeah yeah you say it
[17:04] well all right I will say it too
[17:06] Moses is waiting to say if God speaks
[17:10] then I'm gonna speak
[17:12] that may sound very scriptural yes
[17:16] but it's not
[17:18] amen
[17:19] now brother says here
[17:22] it's actually Human Nature
[17:25] to be lazing around and waiting for God
[17:29] to do everything
[17:30] amen we want God to push us into sin we
[17:35] want God to push us into our Solutions
[17:37] we want God to push us into our
[17:39] blessings we want God to push us into
[17:42] the things that we are wanting in our
[17:44] hearts
[17:46] but God doesn't work like that
[17:48] we are told by the Bible we are
[17:50] co-workers Jesus said the father worked
[17:54] at the hither to end I work so you have
[17:57] to work yourself God is going to do
[17:59] something and he expects you to do
[18:01] something as well he's not going to be
[18:03] doing anything because he is not a
[18:06] dictator
[18:07] he's a co-worker you know when he
[18:10] created the heavens and the Earth and he
[18:12] put Adam and even the Garden of Eden the
[18:15] Bible says when he created the animals
[18:17] you know what he did yes yes the Bible
[18:20] says he left the animals without names
[18:22] not because he was confused because he
[18:25] was overawaked no not because he was
[18:28] tired or not because he didn't know
[18:31] that the seals of the names inside of
[18:34] him but the Bible says he left them
[18:37] without names he wanted to see what Adam
[18:40] would name them
[18:41] because he's counting on you he wants
[18:43] you to do something
[18:45] in the kingdom of God so he wants you to
[18:48] to make a decision yeah
[18:53] and he told his angels
[18:55] watch my boy yes yes amen he is good my
[19:00] mind
[19:02] he is good access to the secrets of my
[19:05] heart
[19:06] what I know he knows you know what the
[19:09] Bible says
[19:11] [Music]
[19:19] we have the mind of the Lord
[19:22] [Applause]
[19:32] that he was with him and he is the
[19:36] circumstance comes up and then he begins
[19:39] to cry What Can I Do Lord what can I do
[19:43] yes so Moses had already been ordained
[19:46] by God for the job that God wanted him
[19:49] to do but somebody got in a complex yes
[19:52] these begin to be not confident about
[19:55] his calling one problem that we have as
[19:58] message Believers we don't have
[20:00] confidence in what we are doing
[20:02] Hallelujah we don't have confidence in
[20:04] our position as the bride of Christ amen
[20:07] but Jesus when he came you know what he
[20:09] told the Pharisees when they were trying
[20:11] to disapprove his ministry he says you
[20:14] know what
[20:15] before Abraham was I am
[20:19] hallelujah amen and he told them you are
[20:23] searching the scriptures because in them
[20:25] we have eternal life but if you read
[20:27] them scriptures they are pointing back
[20:29] to me you are gonna come back to this
[20:31] ministry because I am the interpretation
[20:34] of the way down that you are eating at
[20:37] home let me tell you something that
[20:39] tapes that you are going to they are
[20:41] testifying of the five-fold ministry
[20:43] they are testifying of the power of the
[20:45] Holy Ghost operating in the church
[20:47] Hallelujah
[20:51] thank you Lord because the bride
[20:55] the prophet says
[20:56] she is a Ministry
[20:59] amen somebody asked in the question and
[21:01] answer said shall the bride have a
[21:04] Ministry before the Rapture yes before
[21:08] the Rapture Amen in the prophet says yes
[21:12] she does he says that is what is
[21:16] happening now
[21:17] consisting of what the apostles
[21:20] pastors evangelists in teachers
[21:37] and the mind of Christ to know what he
[21:40] was done by his way
[21:43] and she is the final voice to the final
[21:47] age
[21:49] so we are ordained already Yes Moses was
[21:53] already ordained
[21:55] but here he was crying paragraph 205.
[21:59] the prophet says now you remember
[22:02] he had to already prophesied he for he
[22:05] said this Egyptian that you see today
[22:07] you will see no more
[22:11] he was under the anointing yes and then
[22:15] immediately
[22:16] after prophesy
[22:19] he begins
[22:21] to cry
[22:23] in as much as it may sound funny but
[22:27] this is exactly what is happening in our
[22:29] lives every day as Believers yes yes if
[22:33] you
[22:36] [Music]
[22:40] we live a life that is contrary to what
[22:44] we are praying for
[22:48] that's what Moses was doing
[22:50] after pointing out the children of
[22:52] Israel I say yeah these people that we
[22:55] are seeing you are going to see them no
[22:57] more God is going to deal with them and
[22:59] eradicate them Hallelujah and the people
[23:01] say the amen soon after that he's crying
[23:07] why because after prayer after speaking
[23:11] the word that devil is gonna be waking
[23:13] yes against what you are speaking about
[23:16] and remember because you most of our
[23:19] prayers we do them loudly amen
[23:23] yes when he was talking about the
[23:26] savoring the seal yes they say when
[23:29] you're talking about that that has our
[23:30] silence he said God is hiding the the
[23:33] details of his plan from the Devil
[23:37] he says because any sound has got a
[23:41] meaning in the devil to take that and
[23:43] you know what is being talked about
[23:45] so the silence was Information
[23:47] Management so God that any would not
[23:50] know the plan of God Amen
[23:53] Hallelujah yes so most of our prayers
[23:57] the devil hears them yes and the moment
[24:00] you do that
[24:01] the devil is also planning against what
[24:05] you are praying for against what we have
[24:07] spoken
[24:08] that is why many times when you are
[24:10] prayed before soon after you get worse
[24:13] that's what bottom says yes I mean so
[24:17] many times as Believers we forget yes
[24:20] when we pray for something
[24:23] soon after prayer we find that things
[24:25] are going contrary to our prayers and we
[24:28] break down yes because
[24:30] when God is about to bless you the Devil
[24:34] comes into frustrate you Amen to push
[24:37] you away from your testimony that is
[24:39] supposed to come after your prayer you
[24:41] back off and live a life contrary to
[24:44] what you were praying about
[24:46] what am I talking about
[24:49] one day we were having a campaign in one
[24:53] of the suburbs in Zimbabwean
[24:56] in one of the areas so we pitch the
[24:58] attendant for one week Sunday to Monday
[25:02] so as we I mean Monday to Sunday so as
[25:05] we preach the word from Monday Tuesday
[25:08] and it was rain season
[25:10] amen now
[25:14] on Friday
[25:16] who will take our services from start
[25:18] preaching around six
[25:20] so around six on Friday it started
[25:23] raining
[25:24] amen and now when it started raining
[25:28] the brother who was responsible for that
[25:31] area he came to me and he said brother
[25:35] you see what is happening if the rains
[25:38] persist
[25:40] the Sinners for whom we have put the
[25:43] tent will not come
[25:45] and you'll be busy preaching to
[25:47] ourselves yeah
[25:49] we have not achieved anything
[25:51] so I said what so what he said you
[25:56] you pray for the rains to stop amen
[26:01] praise the Lord
[26:05] amen
[26:07] amen so I looked around and I'm like
[26:10] this brother is making life difficult
[26:13] for me so I looked for that for our
[26:16] roundings I saw his car parked maybe a
[26:18] few meters from the kingdom
[26:20] behind and I said can we go into your
[26:23] car
[26:24] himself and his wife and little children
[26:27] so he walked up there
[26:29] and then we will get into this car and
[26:32] then I'll begin to pray
[26:34] so I say
[26:36] I was Moses that day I say
[26:40] father
[26:42] for sure as my brother says if the rains
[26:46] continue
[26:48] the Sinners are not going to come out of
[26:50] their house
[26:51] so we will give wasted resources for
[26:54] nothing
[26:55] but anyway this is the rain season maybe
[26:58] there is a farmer somewhere who is
[27:01] requested for the range from you
[27:04] we don't want to interfere with them but
[27:08] here we are notifying crops we are
[27:12] preaching the question
[27:14] so I pray that the rain stop so that we
[27:19] can preach the gospel
[27:21] amen and they say the amen now what I'm
[27:24] talking about what causes what Moses did
[27:27] many times after prayer after speaking
[27:30] things still against you yes
[27:34] so the moment we finish prayer his wife
[27:38] steps out of the car and he follows and
[27:41] I'm behind so the moment we walked out
[27:44] as we were heading towards the tent the
[27:46] rains increased
[27:48] and then everyone begins to walk I mean
[27:52] run towards the tent
[27:54] is a man I also crushed my Bible under
[27:58] my armpit and begin to run towards the
[28:00] tent
[28:02] is I was two meters from the tent Dome
[28:06] I had a voice I was so embarrassed
[28:09] the voice said to me
[28:12] you have prayed for the rain to stop why
[28:16] are you running amen
[28:19] I sometimes thinking aloud
[28:22] but he came back and said
[28:25] you have prayed for the rain to stop yes
[28:28] why are you running
[28:32] so I stood there with my Bible under my
[28:36] armpit I went two steps backwards
[28:40] where I was coming from and I stood in
[28:42] the rain and everybody was inside
[28:46] for two three four five minutes the rain
[28:50] stopped
[28:52] we preached Friday Saturday amen Sunday
[28:55] I went to preach about 30 kilometers
[28:57] away from that area and I asked them
[29:00] when did the range stop they said on
[29:02] Friday evening amen Brethren if someone
[29:06] was knitting the rain I'm sorry I
[29:09] stopped it
[29:11] amen
[29:14] not because I'm special no
[29:20] I'm just a believer I'm just a Christian
[29:23] because I've received a commission from
[29:25] the Bible I have received a commission
[29:27] from this spoken word the Bible says go
[29:30] here and preach the gospel
[29:32] and that commission comes with the power
[29:35] of the Holy Ghost
[29:38] so brother Moses was now discouraged
[29:42] something had happened now he's looking
[29:45] at the enemy he says he goes to God in
[29:47] Christ Bible said he says what can I do
[29:50] after he had been commissioned after he
[29:53] had been ordained
[29:55] you forgot about all that yes Hallelujah
[30:00] why was he crying
[30:02] amen so when God is about to bless you
[30:06] God is gonna the devil is going to come
[30:08] and frustrate you
[30:09] so that you're running away from your
[30:11] promise but what I'm telling you now
[30:13] after you pray for something
[30:15] stay with your prayer amen after you've
[30:19] prayed for something you send your
[30:21] prayer to the last energy ever
[30:24] foreign
[30:38] amen hallelujah
[30:41] yes
[30:43] amen
[30:45] amen now once this was supposed to be
[30:48] remembering
[30:51] brother is saying Moses had already been
[30:54] commissioned Moses had already been
[30:56] ordained but he was afraid yes yes with
[30:59] all that he experience Moses calling was
[31:03] actually a supernatural one when Moses
[31:06] was called when he was heading laban's
[31:09] ship what happened the pillar of fire
[31:11] came down and he saw the pillar of fire
[31:14] on top of the bush
[31:16] and the voice spoke to him yes amen when
[31:21] the voice spoke to him
[31:22] he had the opportunity to see the
[31:25] supernatural
[31:26] he had an opportunity to hear the voice
[31:29] of God in the days of the voice of the
[31:32] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[31:34] sound the mission of God shall be
[31:36] finished the end time message people we
[31:39] have heard the voice of God in this hour
[31:42] in the power of the Holy Ghost says come
[31:44] down what are we waiting for stand up
[31:47] and put away down and go forward
[31:49] something else to happen but it takes
[31:52] you to claim the scripture
[31:57] [Music]
[31:58] if you wait
[32:00] for God to do everything nothing is
[32:03] going to be done
[32:04] amen hallelujah so God had already
[32:08] performed the miraculous in the life of
[32:10] Moses he had the sin the pillar of fire
[32:12] he had to sin the cloud he had heard the
[32:15] voice but still he was a coward still he
[32:18] was afraid still he was crying sometimes
[32:21] you wonder that message people after we
[32:23] have seen the witness of the clouder
[32:25] after the pillow fights come among we
[32:28] still crying and we are still covered
[32:31] possible
[32:35] how much more should God do amen
[32:39] listen to this
[32:41] he says now remember
[32:42] he had already prophesied okay after he
[32:46] done a pretty good job in prophesying
[32:48] there you see he then told them what
[32:52] would happen if the word of God was in
[32:55] him it was in him yes and when he was
[32:58] telling that it actually come to pass
[33:01] yes what he said was already going to
[33:06] happen to come to pass so after you've
[33:10] spoken you are currently what you have
[33:13] spoken is going to come to pass but your
[33:15] problem is before it comes to pass you
[33:17] run away you chicken out
[33:21] and you rob yourself of the testimony of
[33:24] the power of the Holy Ghost
[33:26] stay with your request amen don't
[33:30] chicken out he says what he say to us
[33:33] already going to come to pass and here
[33:36] he was crying amen what am I going to do
[33:39] he says oh if that isn't human beings if
[33:43] that isn't me
[33:45] that isn't me see he had already proved
[33:48] what you say will happen yes I am with
[33:52] you oh yes and here a circumstance Rose
[33:55] in a moment
[33:57] what must I do
[33:59] what must I do Lord hey Lord where are
[34:03] you at yes
[34:10] for the people
[34:13] he says and yet
[34:15] he said hey do you hear me he's talking
[34:18] to God what must I do and he had already
[34:21] ordained him and they Vindicated him and
[34:25] he proved and worked everything through
[34:27] him and hear God oh my fully expressing
[34:31] men was to rest and let God do the
[34:34] abortion
[34:36] and yet he knew that God anointed him so
[34:40] he was anointed he was commissioned he
[34:44] was ordained he had the pin of her
[34:46] experience he had the cloud experience
[34:48] but still he was becoming a coward
[34:51] that's why God was rebuking him
[34:54] he says oh my
[34:56] and proved and worked everything through
[34:58] him and here got all my fully expressing
[35:01] man was to rest and let God do the
[35:03] pushing and yet he knew that God had
[35:07] anointed him for this job to do this yes
[35:10] now remember
[35:12] God is never going to ask the church to
[35:15] do anything that he had not prepared us
[35:17] to do
[35:20] when God descends a man
[35:23] he jumps into him yeah and he does the
[35:27] job himself inside the man he is sent
[35:30] even this Precious Blood that most is
[35:33] when you are saved when the pure face
[35:35] stopped when the voice stopped talking
[35:37] to her brother from the pillar of fire
[35:39] in the bush what happened
[35:42] you didn't go back to Heaven no no no
[35:44] that pillow fight jumped into Moses and
[35:48] soon after that then you hear God
[35:50] telling more say hey now you are a God
[35:52] so you need a prophet I'll give you
[35:54] Aaron Hallelujah and from there you
[35:57] watch Moses
[35:59] the Pharaoh when he stands in front of
[36:02] Arrow when you are talking to God you
[36:04] are saying your people but when you
[36:06] stand before father he says hello let my
[36:09] people go
[36:11] I don't know because the pillow fire was
[36:14] inside of him the owner in the run of
[36:17] the church the pastor of the Church of
[36:20] the two million treasure was inside of
[36:22] Moses now he is crying what has happened
[36:25] he has forgotten the miraculous but
[36:28] something happened before God and proved
[36:30] to him that he was ordained let me tell
[36:33] you something that people of the legend
[36:34] of the hour you are already or danger
[36:36] you are ruined them you have been
[36:39] commissioned God the Holy Ghost of the
[36:42] hour is in our midst of operating the
[36:44] church inspiring somebody
[36:51] thank you
[36:53] the processes
[36:56] he says it was time for the people to be
[36:59] delivered yeah God through his miracles
[37:03] and Oneness it droved them all together
[37:06] in one group you follow me brought them
[37:10] all together in one group Vindicated
[37:12] these claims scripture said so he was
[37:16] the son he was the evidence he
[37:19] everything that he said then he come
[37:22] among them
[37:24] is a prophet ever whatever he said God
[37:28] honored it even to create
[37:31] and to bring up flies yes and the good
[37:34] things in existence and everything that
[37:37] he had promised him he he done it yes
[37:40] man yes
[37:42] Moses said created his life yes in Egypt
[37:46] do you see how we forget testimonies in
[37:49] our history yes when we Face some
[37:51] situations we forget what God has done
[37:54] he last week we forget what God did last
[37:58] year we forget what God did the last
[38:00] month we begin to cry
[38:03] amen
[38:04] but he wanted to wait on that says there
[38:09] is our issue and when you're dealing
[38:11] with the prophets that used to thus say
[38:14] is that otherwise they are not
[38:16] comfortable without that says the Lord
[38:18] they are not comfortable going forward
[38:20] yes
[38:21] yes Hallelujah
[38:23] he says he was waiting on that says the
[38:27] Lord you see issue he should have known
[38:29] that the very Vindication of his call
[38:33] was that stays the Lord hallelujah
[38:38] so he's waiting for that says the Lord
[38:42] but he already has the Sea of the Lord
[38:46] that is where our problem is the message
[38:49] people in this hour they are still
[38:50] waiting for that says the Lord but the
[38:52] pillow fire is Right amongst them they
[38:55] are still waiting for the center but the
[38:57] commission is amongst us we are still
[39:00] waiting for the same the Lord but we
[39:02] have the promise of the hour we have the
[39:04] Holy Ghost amongst us what are we
[39:06] waiting for amen
[39:13] his job that he was ordained to was thus
[39:18] says
[39:20] can you get it he says why did he wait
[39:24] on that says the Lord
[39:27] I mean oh
[39:30] the pillow fire
[39:31] was in him
[39:33] he had the voice of God and he had been
[39:37] given the commission but he was still
[39:39] waiting for that says the Lord but he
[39:42] himself was actually exhausted the Lord
[39:45] the commission was that says the Lord
[39:48] his calling was that says the Lord what
[39:51] are you waiting for Mozilla come on
[39:55] somebody must know that the pill of fire
[39:58] is a man
[39:59] says wherever this message is going to
[40:02] be preached is
[40:07] Amen to me yeah
[40:10] that is that says
[40:14] don't believe in this hour don't now let
[40:16] me make with you wait a minute
[40:19] if you remember that window in zaripas
[40:22] yes
[40:24] after God spoke to Elijah and told him
[40:28] that you go to that to zalipat I have
[40:30] commanded the woman there to to sustain
[40:33] thee
[40:34] now that's all right that's
[40:36] straightforward in God he's not a liar
[40:37] but if you go in the message brother
[40:39] says commanded there but she didn't know
[40:42] yeah
[40:44] yes absolutely
[40:46] so if she didn't know it how did God
[40:50] command him to sustain the men of God
[40:54] it means she never had a dream about it
[40:57] she never saw a vision about it she
[41:00] never had an audible voice about it but
[41:03] let me tell you the minister of the
[41:05] Gospel she felt like doing it and she
[41:08] did it but when she done that that is
[41:10] exactly the perfect story of God can
[41:12] containing his life her life
[41:14] what are you waiting for you're waiting
[41:16] for a dream we are waiting for a vision
[41:19] we are waiting for an audible voice
[41:25] that says the Lord with you the pill of
[41:28] fire is a testimony that The Testament
[41:30] is ensued oh amen hallelujah thank you
[41:34] Lord
[41:35] but we are still crying amen we still
[41:39] want another
[41:41] [Music]
[41:45] they are waiting for them
[41:54] God is never used them in a dream but
[41:57] they are waiting for the day
[42:00] but when you have a scripture when you
[42:02] have a quotation he says that says the
[42:05] Lord why am I saying that remember how
[42:08] the commission came to the prophet my
[42:10] people this message did not come from
[42:12] America no absolutely
[42:15] did not come from California or or
[42:18] Jefferson if you know that's cooking
[42:21] where it came from the presence of God
[42:22] you know what happened when he was in
[42:24] the Clinton Indiana how the message
[42:26] became the commission you know what
[42:28] happened
[42:30] this message is a supernatural message
[42:34] before we talk about it before we caught
[42:37] it before we read it it's a supernatural
[42:40] message so when you read it and compare
[42:43] with it that's Supernatural is gonna
[42:45] happen hallelujah amen amen
[42:48] when the commission came

[43:22] God is the owner of the flying saucers
[43:25] you know what the Bible say you know
[43:26] what the prophet says that 200 pound men
[43:29] stepped out of a ball of fire
[43:32] Hallelujah the commission came by the
[43:35] power of the Holy Ghost the commission
[43:37] came by the power of the presence of God
[43:39] it's a supernatural message on its own
[43:42] amen
[43:47] [Music]
[43:50] Glory
[43:52] and
[43:54] he told
[43:55] the prophet he says
[43:59] if you can only meet the people to
[44:02] believe you amen amen
[44:05] [Music]
[44:09] thank you Jesus
[44:12] nothing shall stand in your way and the
[44:16] person you remember what you were
[44:18] talking about when the Bible says behold
[44:21] I send you Elijah the Bible remember the
[44:24] scriptures are of comfort meaning it was
[44:26] not just telling you that is going to
[44:27] send you William Branham but after that
[44:30] departure of William the church is
[44:32] arranged by the speak of Elijah and that
[44:35] God is saying I send you now you are the
[44:38] Elijah that speak of Elijah is upon you
[44:41] that's why Elijah raised up and say
[44:43] where's the god of Elijah
[44:47] thank you Lord amen the ten division you
[44:50] remembered yes huh you know what brother
[44:53] never said I'm gonna rest yes he never
[44:56] said I want to rest but he says is the
[44:59] prayer line was going on
[45:01] the nice gentleman comes and cuts him
[45:04] off and says is brother Branham is
[45:07] resting we will continue with the prayer
[45:09] amen
[45:12] oh my God
[45:14] amen amen amen it was not the choice of
[45:18] brother Branham to rest no but the angel
[45:21] cut him off amen his time was up
[45:27] [Music]
[45:39] the prayer line is not going to stop
[45:42] it's going to continue that power of the
[45:45] Holy Ghost continues with a church we
[45:47] are not to say
[45:49] we have to see the power and the glory
[45:52] of the same God that brought upon them
[45:57] the bride is supposed to continue under
[46:01] now remember brother Bonham says this he
[46:04] says when you are saying she's the final
[46:07] voice Amen to the final age he says
[46:12] a message to the spirit of Elijah
[46:16] Hallelujah continues with the change
[46:19] continues in the brighter that's why
[46:21] brother was expecting you to do
[46:24] everything that you did
[46:27] amen yes
[46:29] and you know what he says now Paul if I
[46:33] go back to Paul Paul when he was talking
[46:36] about the grace of God he says the grace
[46:37] of God
[46:39] revealed unto me
[46:42] to you what yes
[46:45] did you hear them
[46:48] the grace of God
[46:50] revealed unto Paul
[46:53] to you
[46:54] so the final destination of the grace of
[46:59] God as it came from God through Paul the
[47:02] final destination is you amen that's why
[47:05] the same Bible says when God is looking
[47:07] at what he says my word is not going to
[47:10] come back to me void without
[47:12] accomplishment that we shall save it for
[47:14] when you sleep just were eaten Brothers
[47:17] says they were pushing for each
[47:20] generation yes
[47:22] when God was chopping Church edges these
[47:26] foundations he alluded the scriptures
[47:29] to say these scriptures we allude them
[47:32] for these brothers and sisters in giving
[47:35] between 1909 to
[47:38] 2025. these are the brothers who are
[47:41] going to meet these scriptures
[47:42] [Music]
[47:45] amen amen
[47:47] we have got a problem which we said
[47:51] now in English
[47:54] it means if you meet once
[47:58] you will always meet
[48:01] amen
[48:03] that if you meet once you always what
[48:07] and predestination tells us we
[48:11] are in God before the foundation of the
[48:15] world
[48:16] and we were actually in good and we were
[48:19] not just in good we were God we were
[48:23] part of God Amen
[48:29] that was actually used for the bride is
[48:32] the same material that is making the
[48:34] pride Hallelujah because Adam was Adam
[48:38] in Israel
[48:40] ease was just received inside of Adam
[48:43] what was left now was the cause of
[48:46] Calvary to pull out the life to pull out
[48:48] the woman to pull out the bride
[48:52] but when she comes out brother but I'm
[48:54] saying she is him she she power of his
[48:57] power bone of his bone flesh of his bone
[49:00] she is
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:04] yes so amen
[49:07] what we are waiting for you know one
[49:10] time
[49:11] he
[49:13] found a situation there was a baby
[49:16] that was sick very sick
[49:18] and you know men of God they are easily
[49:20] touched like that they are Shepherds you
[49:23] know so his shout is very big
[49:26] and he decided to confront God he said
[49:29] Lord if he were here
[49:34] and you see this child in this condition
[49:36] what were you going to do yes
[49:44] and the voice spoke to him and said I'm
[49:48] also waiting to see what you are going
[49:50] to do about it Hallelujah
[49:53] [Music]
[49:57] most of the things you are waiting for
[50:00] God to do he is waiting for you to do it
[50:02] amen yes yes you've got to make a
[50:07] decision like the like that we do it is
[50:10] Harry Potter without a dream yes without
[50:14] a vision without an audible Voice
[50:17] without nothing
[50:19] just to make a decision because you are
[50:21] inspired you know who you are Hallelujah
[50:25] the problem is our identity confusion
[50:29] we don't know who we are and represent
[50:31] the moment the bread comes to know who
[50:33] she is
[50:35] yes yes amen I hate this story
[50:41] of one of the dictators in Africa his
[50:44] son went out of the country
[50:46] I mean that was a circle is the sun went
[50:50] out of the country and he came back with
[50:52] a lot of goods and uh that that the
[50:56] immigration here they didn't really know
[50:59] this boy
[51:01] huh yes so he had a lot of things and
[51:04] they wanted him to to pay Duty
[51:07] and uh he didn't have so they tossed him
[51:11] about and took his stuff and pushed one
[51:13] side and you are not going you have to
[51:15] pay Duty they didn't know who he was
[51:19] so he decided no I think I needed this
[51:23] help so he goes to a telephone
[51:26] then he calls his father the president
[51:30] and he explains his situation he thought
[51:33] hey that he's gonna come with a
[51:35] helicopter to rescue him
[51:37] what we are doing with God yeah
[51:41] when the boy finished explaining his
[51:44] situation said what is your name
[51:48] and the boy was
[51:54] that he said I said what is your name
[51:58] and he said yet his name blah blah blah
[52:01] says
[52:07] yeah
[52:08] yes before he hanged the phone he said
[52:12] use your name amen
[52:15] hallelujah
[52:18] from that phone call that that young boy
[52:21] come from the phone booth with red eyes
[52:24] like a cake that is drink wine from the
[52:27] out of God facing the enemy amen
[52:30] hallelujah
[52:36] [Music]
[52:41] follow me Hallelujah
[52:47] because he came to a realization of who
[52:50] was
[52:52] and that is our problem is that right we
[52:54] are in a complex we don't know who we
[52:57] are we are refusing us to accept
[52:59] scriptures and quotations that are
[53:01] talking about that we are that
[53:05] we are the brighter
[53:08] amen
[53:10] oh yes so the message we have is that
[53:14] this is the Lord
[53:16] amen so sometimes we have to come up to
[53:20] our to our things and accept the
[53:23] responsibility that we have been given
[53:25] by God and believe in who we are yes and
[53:28] that's how Jesus overcame because he
[53:31] knew when it come to confrontations he
[53:34] would do claim and tell them hey I came
[53:36] from God and that's where I'm going
[53:39] Hallelujah
[53:40] amen speaking to a Pentecostal one-time
[53:43] Angels you know I told him I'm going to
[53:46] heaven
[53:49] I understand your questions yes
[53:53] I said I'm going to heaven
[53:58] amen
[54:01] and he was shaking see how do you know
[54:05] amen that's what the Bible tells me yes
[54:08] that's where I came from amen so that's
[54:12] where I'm going yeah
[54:14] he said ah you you are alive
[54:18] we will meet you in here
[54:25] now that's a man who is going to church
[54:28] singing in church clipping hands saying
[54:31] amen but he's saying I'll meet you in
[54:33] here
[54:35] you know like I told you I said to him
[54:38] you know what if it happens
[54:41] I'll give come for a short sermon and
[54:44] they'll be passing by
[54:51] [Music]
[54:53] Hallelujah
[54:56] doesn't matter
[54:58] preach the gospel anyway
[55:01] when you come to realize who you are
[55:03] sometimes even in prayer is not
[55:06] necessary you speak that way anymore
[55:08] that's what the Bible is that don't
[55:10] worry me don't bother me speak the way
[55:13] amen
[55:15] because they're spoken word is the
[55:17] originals
[55:19] says something
[55:21] he says
[55:23] when a man
[55:24] who has got the Holy Ghost yes takes it
[55:27] away from his heart and he speaks it
[55:31] through his lips he says it's in nothing
[55:34] but the deity
[55:38] so all that you need with you like the
[55:42] woman in zaripat is the word and the
[55:45] Holy Ghost
[55:47] because the woman is
[55:50] in the mirror and the meal is the word
[55:54] of God the oil representing what the
[55:56] Holy Ghost
[55:57] that's what she needs
[55:59] she needed and the miraculous happened
[56:01] because Elijah was there so what are you
[56:03] waiting for Elijah has come you have the
[56:07] weather you have the Holy Ghost so the
[56:09] miraculous mother happy what are you
[56:12] waiting for speak and go forward
[56:19] so she had uh she had the oil in the
[56:24] meal and the prophet came and he spoke
[56:27] Amen on those things and the miraculous
[56:30] happens
[56:32] listen to this last quotation
[56:35] amen
[56:37] brother Brown says
[56:40] uh
[56:42] in the message the junction of time
[56:44] tip number five six zero one one five
[56:48] amen
[56:50] he says um
[56:52] paragraph 107 a leper full of leprosy
[56:56] went to him one day said Lord thou came
[56:59] if thou will can make me clean
[57:03] he touched you
[57:05] said I will
[57:07] be thou clean
[57:09] is that a prayer
[57:11] no
[57:14] he touched you
[57:15] and he spoke to him
[57:17] you see that was not a prayer
[57:21] the Bible simply says he touched you
[57:25] and he said I will be down clean and
[57:29] when omnipotence speaks that's why
[57:33] amen when only putting this speaks
[57:37] miraculous takes place
[57:39] yes he says hallelujah his leprosy
[57:44] vanished
[57:45] like a Sun flying from behind a Cloud
[57:48] Sure omnipotent speaks paragraph one
[57:51] order and says he promised in this last
[57:54] days that he used to speak again
[58:01] Jesus threw the bride the Holy Ghost
[58:04] through the bride is nothing but the egg
[58:08] is speaking if you have the baptism of
[58:10] the Holy Ghost and you have the spoken
[58:12] word speak the word and when you speak
[58:15] is nothing but God himself and when you
[58:18] speak you are actually the heavens
[58:20] [Music]
[58:28] he was hunting with
[58:31] the cancer on the ear
[58:33] in discovered it when they were handing
[58:36] so he looks at it he looks at this
[58:39] princess brother do you realize what you
[58:42] have on the Eastern idea
[58:45] cancer yeah he said why why didn't you

[58:57] they come to church they go back home
[59:00] the pastor is there they sing they go
[59:03] back home with their problems six months
[59:06] imagine
[59:10] sometimes you know about things when
[59:12] couples have divorced and
[59:17] and tell us yes
[59:20] but at the time you know they have a
[59:22] problem that the brothers
[59:26] interface
[59:28] they've already fought and beaten one
[59:30] another why didn't you approach the
[59:33] pastor they are quiet there are people
[59:35] like that
[59:39] no matter how much they've been
[59:42] okay that's not what I'm talking about
[59:44] he says
[59:46] how long have you had this it's about
[59:48] six months
[59:50] then says
[59:52] he went and took the brothers hint
[59:55] and said God bless my brother he didn't
[59:58] pray for him
[1:00:00] and then
[1:00:02] they left they contained what they
[1:00:04] whatever they were doing the following
[1:00:06] day I can't remember following week the
[1:00:09] cancer had disappeared and brother
[1:00:12] Barnum says when he was now talking
[1:00:14] about that he says remember the
[1:00:16] scripture says they shall lay hands on
[1:00:19] the sick
[1:00:21] he didn't say they shall pray Lord that
[1:00:25] praying his birth their situations where
[1:00:27] under
[1:00:30] and you speak the word amen
[1:00:35] praise the Lord
[1:00:38] there was a sister one time
[1:00:41] there is a sister in our church yes and
[1:00:43] the husband works outside of town so
[1:00:46] there was a problem and the husband
[1:00:48] asked me to go to a workplace I went
[1:00:50] there she's a teacher and she comes out
[1:00:53] of the classroom and she's sick
[1:00:55] in the school children are there in
[1:00:58] another teacher
[1:01:00] so I begin to wonder
[1:01:03] where can I pray for you in the
[1:01:06] classroom yeah should I get out here
[1:01:08] with all the teachers roaming around
[1:01:10] what what should I do I can't take a
[1:01:13] privately somewhere I can't
[1:01:16] well at least I was wondering
[1:01:18] something reminded me of this quotation
[1:01:22] the scripture said they shall lay hands
[1:01:25] on the sick they shall recover
[1:01:29] then I I say to the sister
[1:01:32] I'm going into bokeh
[1:01:35] and then I straight down my hand and I
[1:01:38] greeted there she shook my hand I said
[1:01:40] God bless you and I went home
[1:01:44] now she had requested for me to pray yes
[1:01:47] so she told me I was going to go home
[1:01:50] and pray I didn't pray
[1:01:52] the following day she sent me an SMS
[1:01:56] she says Pastor thank you for your
[1:01:58] prayers
[1:02:03] I never explained to him it's not
[1:02:05] necessary yeah sometimes you confuse
[1:02:07] people yes
[1:02:10] what
[1:02:11] is scriptures meet the believer amen you
[1:02:16] recognize one another because you were
[1:02:19] there together in good you were part of
[1:02:22] the word in the beginning so they
[1:02:25] attended the spoken word Wendy is the
[1:02:27] word in the holy ghost things must have
[1:02:29] happened was that's the only person who
[1:02:32] can speak and then the miracle has
[1:02:34] happened amen hallelujah
[1:02:36] my last
[1:02:38] uh testimony with a young brother in the
[1:02:42] church
[1:02:46] he was young in the faith I had baptized
[1:02:48] in
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:50] like recently and he was young in the
[1:02:52] faith and then he got a job in a certain
[1:02:55] company and
[1:02:56] he was a hard worker
[1:02:58] so
[1:02:59] they came a vacant
[1:03:02] and the owners of the company promoted
[1:03:06] him
[1:03:07] and then explains on the old timers
[1:03:13] you remember when he was coming to
[1:03:16] Africa he was requesting for prayers in
[1:03:18] the pranam Tabernacle he says I need
[1:03:21] your prayers where I'm going there which
[1:03:22] doctors yes and it's there in the
[1:03:25] scriptures
[1:03:27] so I don't know what they've done on him
[1:03:31] so he got sick as a young brother
[1:03:34] you know
[1:03:35] then
[1:03:37] one month
[1:03:39] is going to doctors nothing is working
[1:03:42] two months
[1:03:43] doctors are trying this one twice this
[1:03:45] nothing is working three months until
[1:03:48] he's sick leave I mean uh where you they
[1:03:52] pay you when you are sick it should be
[1:03:54] three months it elapsed you went into
[1:03:56] the fourth month 50 months
[1:04:00] 60 months you could not walk
[1:04:03] and all the medication which the doctors
[1:04:05] will try nothing was working and they
[1:04:08] had the grand thing like a stick
[1:04:12] 70 months
[1:04:13] is baked rhythm
[1:04:17] one Saturday he receives a call
[1:04:21] and uh the screen shows private number

[1:04:27] and the voice said to him he recognized
[1:04:30] The Voice
[1:04:31] between belong to one of these workmates
[1:04:34] and Old Men
[1:04:36] the voice said to him don't waste your
[1:04:40] money
[1:04:40] on daughters and the prescriptions
[1:04:43] because those things are not going to
[1:04:45] work on you what we did on you cannot be
[1:04:49] undone by medical doctors you are not
[1:04:53] coming back into this office
[1:04:57] Direct
[1:04:59] so the young man was shaking
[1:05:02] God doesn't work with comments yes right
[1:05:05] yes I understand him he was young in the
[1:05:08] faith
[1:05:09] he was shaking so he calls me his
[1:05:12] parents were not believers

[1:06:03] testament which is so Silas okay

[1:06:12] deportation with the prophets which is
[1:06:14] which doctors

[1:06:25] Bewitched
[1:06:28] you shall not the truth the truth shall
[1:06:31] set you free
[1:06:33] man says
[1:06:36] to overcome is to be able to identify
[1:06:39] the devil if you fail to identify him
[1:06:42] you are not going to overcome it so I
[1:06:45] said this is your issue
[1:06:48] so I said but today
[1:06:51] brother I'm not going to pray for you
[1:06:53] yes
[1:06:55] Christian sometimes are difficult to
[1:06:57] deal with
[1:06:59] they work with inspiration yeah
[1:07:02] remember Jesus as he was going away
[1:07:07] so I said today I'm not going to pray
[1:07:09] for you

[1:07:14] that have done on you they are enough
[1:07:17] the scriptures that I have given you in
[1:07:20] the quotations
[1:07:22] you remember brother says the word of
[1:07:24] God overcomes the enemy anyway
[1:07:28] any type any circumstances
[1:07:32] so I said my prayers plus quotations
[1:07:35] plus the Bible verses is enough I am
[1:07:39] done away I have concluded I've dealt
[1:07:41] with your grace is defeated
[1:07:44] amen the Bible speaks about vain
[1:07:47] repetition brother would wrote One
[1:07:49] people there you he prays for them they

[1:07:56] queue again we don't do that in the
[1:07:59] messenger we play once and that's it

[1:08:09] said go home I'm done with your question
[1:08:11] yes
[1:08:13] I said brother your problem is you are
[1:08:16] afraid and God doesn't deal with the
[1:08:19] coward as long as you're in this
[1:08:21] condition you will die die We will bury
[1:08:23] you I'll preach on your funeral
[1:08:25] I was very rough yeah I knew where I was

[1:08:32] not going to pray for him I'm done
[1:08:36] brother Branham says when he talks about
[1:08:39] the system of being healed in church
[1:08:41] without prayer without learning he said
[1:08:43] when I was preaching the word when you
[1:08:45] fall so the word goes from the preacher
[1:08:49] to your situation to your life
[1:08:53] the word when you first
[1:08:55] he went home
[1:08:57] when he arrived home
[1:09:00] he vomited
[1:09:03] now that doesn't faced him
[1:09:06] after vomiting
[1:09:08] on Saturday another man calls him from
[1:09:11] the same company
[1:09:14] someone whom he knows

[1:10:02] miraculous is supposed to happen the
[1:10:04] omnipotent speaks he speaks what the

[1:10:13] quotation take the verse and push it on
[1:10:15] the devil and claim your Victory
