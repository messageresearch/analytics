eternity soon will unfold come on let's sin the day of redemption is near and men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with heaven's powers but god's church is the power that's shaking this hour the day of redemption is here for the day of redemption your redemption is here you see the fig tree is growing jerusalem's restoring a national life today she's calling a latter range falling return or disperse to your own the day of redemption is false prophets are lying thoughts should they deny jesus the christ is our god and though this generation spurs god's revelation we'll walk where the prophet has strong oh the day of redemption is [Music] or the day of redemption is near church amen we ought to keep our lamb shrimp and burning amen hallelujah amen let's prepare our hearts now as we hear the word of the lord oh how we love the word of the lord amen it is sharp it is powerful the word of the lord is quick can discern our hearts amen oh we bless the name of jesus in his holy presence nothing can be hid from god even as the world is being preached you can discern our hearts and speak right to our very need amen some things we may feel are not needful but the holy spirit knows what is needful for us it's like a good heavenly father who knows what to give his children so even as the spirit is speaking this morning say lord i receive in jesus name oh god i just want to eat of your word this morning and growing the statue of a perfect man oh we bless your name lord jesus [Music] more than ever before lord i love you [Music] more than ever before lord i need you more

[Music] i love you now more than ever one more time let's sing to the lord more than ever before lord i love you more than ever more than ever before i want to tell you [Music] i love you now more than ever before as possible let's sing it out oh more than ever [Music] now [Music] foreign i love you the world is waiting for a superman right now amen isn't it the world is waiting for somebody to come and rescue them right because a lot of nations are seeking for answers and they got no answers to what's happening so you know the prophet tells us in the book the seals they're waiting for a superman somebody that can come and uh give them assurance rescue them take them out of the crisis that's what the prophet said say that's the world but we thank god that we have once rescued us he came to our rescue long ago praise the lord and we know where we are heading for yes ma'am where is the lord so the world is in uh actually in a confusion nations are actually now prepared for war if you really follow the news of things you'll see they are bringing out all the rockets and missiles and all these things creating it on the trucks see so i think some place a prophet said just take one man that just goes crazier that time is press the button and the rockets will go off i mean china can do that right now isn't it just press the button send the rockets to america and america can send to them so all the nations are racing and it's a it's a very tense time also for israel right now we just had news this past week that the uae is right they made a treaty with israel to be friendly with them so all the other arab nations are not happy about it and then i think somebody posted a jeffers the airport is on fire to burn the airport see so all these tensions are coming there and israelis in the situation but we know these things happen according to the word of god and uh all the nations will gather uh jerusalem will be surrounded right we know it's gonna happen right and when your tribulation is gonna set in the bride is gonna go amen amen three and a half years the wedding supper man praise the lord and then we go to the millennium we got we actually got a bright future there not here yeah it's gloomy but we got a bright future there see and we got to look forward to that amen and god has made a way seeing for us to get there so we i think part of the message is going to be centered on that are we going to get it because god has made a way for us amen so just thank him and uh appreciate him and uh love him you know i'm just thinking while you're singing more than ever before uh i was just thinking how the prophet loved the lord amen he loved the lord jesus amen and he expressed it amen you know the way he says he loved jesus we never hear anybody say that no and we have a personal relationship a personal encounter with the lord and he and he really loved him then that's why when he saw reality he made uh you know he said i'm gonna fully surrender amen his whole life to look for the lord amen and he did that seem to look at real life so thank god for a man like that but really love the lord and express the lord jesus christ and he had to be a special person because uh you know he was a son of man revealing these son of man amen and to have that special bond praise the lord i'll be glad for them amen praise the lord so we thank god so uh yeah our health will be gloomy and all these things that but we've got a bright future out of this world amen raise them up that's what we're looking for see we're looking for escape there so today god will break away from us and uh we'd like to uh have a brother's fellowship amen on thursday night not a brother's meeting [Music] just fellowship right so just come on on thursday if you can make it yeah as early as possible so we don't go very late the careful is still on they said they uh be level two but they still got carefully from ten i think to five in the morning so you can't travel after 10. so we can get here we'll try and get you about 6 30 and just a fellowship general discussion we haven't uh met for a long time and you know i just a general fellowship and things like that there's certain things we want to just discuss and things like that so so every brother should be on thursday and we pray you know it's our fellowship the time of fellowship i mean uh you know i think we don't we don't find uh any better reason to gather household other people we are gathered for a brother's fellowship okay so just come so it's not a meeting to discuss any church matters or anything just a general fellowship and uh as we start you know we can see what what the fellowship is about so pray god will make a way for us praise the lord return to our bible this morning the book of genesis chapter one so i pray this morning that the word of god will speak to our hearts and we need something uh something solid you know something uh scriptural something word based right now when everybody is in a doubt what's happening even children may not understand what's happening they might have a lot of questions of what's happening and you know in the world here and all these things that so let's find some bible assurance something to give us reason not to say listen yeah we don't have to worry because the word of god is telling us something and we're going to look forward to that so we just pray for them also see as young people that we can have questions and all these things so we pray god will speak to us we also remember the uh the live stream uh audience out there we got to bless them and go to make our way and we are level 2 but they still got restrictions of 50 but a few more can still come i think we're getting here about 35 40 35 40. so we can still actually get everybody back so they shouldn't stay too wrong especially if they've got children because the children will get used to not coming to church and then others wouldn't get into them so once they lose that interest and they'll be drawn away see we don't don't want that to happen to them somebody said strain of the child in the ways of the lord amen so don't let some other influence come and say no you know we don't have to really go to church and we don't have to really serve god there and things like that because that's unscriptural and bible says we must gather as often as we can as we see the days fast approaching see so that's very important so we pray god will bless them and also brother sunny is uh spoke to him this friday is recovering quite well from a few days and then uh they're still draining the water from his lungs he's got a bag there that the water drains and they're gonna monitor and see how flight clears up but they said no they don't want to keep him also too long in hospital because it's uh it's not a place where he should be with all these viruses and all that they are willing for him also to go home so hopefully one of these days he should be back home and uh so every day he's gonna you know it's uh it's gonna get used to having one land and breathing on one run and also they say the lung also starts to expand and take another portion of the place where the other one was so all that process is going to take some time and uh it's going to be so pray for him that god will make him happy with all amen amen that's our prayer and our desire you look to the book of uh genesis this morning chapter one genesis chapter one reading from verse 24 genesis 1 24 and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping king and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and god made the beast of the earth after his kind the cattle after their kind and everything that creeped upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good and god said let us make man in our image amen after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the falls over here and over the cattle and over all the earth and every creeping thing that creeped upon the earth so god created man in his whole image amen in the image of god supply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish on the sea or the falls of the air and over every living thing that movement upon the earth praise the lord let's just let us pray if you have a need this morning whatever it may be just make it known unto the lord now whatever it is we just pray god and make a way and then as the word is preached and that we pray your endurance lord jesus we thank you this morning lord for your grace and mercy and lord even as we read the scriptures here lord we know even as we stand right here we are creatures of time but lord we know one day we're going to be creatures of eternity and that's what we are looking for and lord you will put us here for the purpose that god is therefore and serving and we pray lord that your will be done we want to say not my will but your will be done therefore we are looking for this glorious promise and this glorious hope even as the word is promised us and lord when you start today in the garden of eden give you exactly what you agree for you had a plan and lord you want to fulfill all your plans and and all your desires when you started mandate the garden of eden and lord we see where we have ended right today but we still have your promise and we are looking forward to the promise amen has said uh the prophet said yeah for a purpose each and every one of us here for a purpose see and our life didn't stop when our parents brought us here on earth our life never started there we were in god's talk long before that amen so god made a way for us to come here through our parents so he had a purpose for us to be here amen now if each and every one of us can trace back our dna amen even we can go trace back up they got memes today if you got your real names your real names your surname you know like i was saying now it's a confusion after they came here you know all different surnames and we don't know what's going on but if you got your real surname at all they can trace you right back they can trace each and every one of us back to india amen and from india they can trace us back right to where we came in the beginning even right to the garden of eden amen see so we never came here just when we were born [Music] you can trace our theology like the phrase jesus right back there see so the bible says now god created us in his image amen you see what i'm saying now what is the image of god god is the spirit amen so god made man in his image so what is that image a spirit amen so god made us a spirited man before we became flesh like adam was a spirited man see now adam was created on the sixth day of god's creation after god created everything you can read on the back there in the bible and the evening and the morning were the sixth day that's genesis 1 31 see god created man on the sixth day the last day of his creation so that was a spirit man wasn't in the flesh later on he put him in the flesh maybe was the dust of the earth and he breathed the breath of life into him and he became a living soul see so now each and every one of us here is a spirit we are living in a flesh body but each and every one is a spirit amen now if uh if i talk to you or we talk to one another who do you think we are talking to see that hello brother caleb how are you you okay are you happy praise the lord now who did i talk to i spoke to the spirit these bodies that's the body he never answered me from his heart or any other organ he never even answered me from his brain amen i mean all those there the facilities are there for us to think at all but the real response was the spirit amen so each and every one of us is the spirit and the prophet tells us and the word tells us that this spirit is immortal immortal immortal means can never die amen god cannot die right but when god has made a plan of salvation and all those that were disobedient and when they come to the final white throne judgment then god is able to destroy the body and the spirit completely see so we know that this body now is uh he's a spirit is the spirit in us see always have that in your mind and thought now if he if the spirit leaves his body what happens to us falls down although we've got a skeleton here holding us up we've got skeletons we've got muscles and everything else he's holding us up but let the spirit leaves his body will just fall down so there's a spirit in there that what god he put us in his body here but that spirit will continue to live amen amen and then god has made another body for us it's not a flesh body we're going to go back to our word body amen that's what we're looking for is to go back to our word body and in that word body right we'll come back we will live there in the millennia praise the lord we love bodies and the prophet tells us there we can eat and live like normal human beings amen but yet we won't be in the flesh we can have a body change praise the lord right so now there's a spirit in us right now the bomb says cream not the spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption amen sorry grieve not the spirit so when we do something wrong that we should not do right then the spirit get greed the body doesn't get grieved no ways the body is going to get greed the spirit get greedy amen when something happens some disaster or something strikes you your spirit is troubled isn't it you get down at it you are troubled in your spirit see sarah the spirit is there right so that will go back to be in the garden of eden before like adam was put into the flesh before ellie was put in the flesh he had dominion he had control over everything in the garden of eden he was an amateur god amen and god gave him authority amen name all the animals everything that he named and whatever it was uh whatever it did in the garden animate control amen he gave him complete control so we are going back to that amen and god showed us some of these things here in the life of the prophet amen how the word can be spoken like god spoke there he said let it let there be so i wonder when the brothers are going in there i think for squirrels there was no squirrels so he didn't know you were like in those girls sitting by the tree there then the holy spirit came and told him you know what what the scripture says if you speak to the mountain amen then the prophet says you know what i never really understood this and that's why i never preached it and he says now what he says is speak to the mountain amen whatsoever you have need of you came to out squirrels why don't you speak amen and brian's sisters he was doubting he thought he was in a dream he thought he was in a vision he put his fingers to make sure he's alive and awake and he was then he said okay let the school come there and it came let it come in another place it came let it come in three squirrels he shot one time and another time was five spoilers amen he took that all many surely to the brothers and he ate it so we are going back to that speak the word amen now the prophet in the message say why can't i speak that's what we ought to be when we come to a situation we are not to be in despair we must speak amen we must speak the word and move on imagine joshua there fighting the battle there and uh you need to finish up the enemy and i tell you what he was just so busy and an inspiration struck him and he said son stand still amen and he also spoke to the moon not to move they obeyed grand sisters it was not actually the sun should still i mean the earth rotates and revolves around the sun so actually the sun the earth stopped moving the sun was still there the sun doesn't move but he said son we say the sun rise the sun doesn't rise we say the sun sets the sun doesn't sit if you look at the dirt going round right during the day faces the sun when it's gone the other side it's got nighttime so all the inspiration is spoke now there was no time to think about it there was no time to pray about it in that in the crucial hour he spoke and it happened francis said that's what's going to happen amen so don't cry speak when we have a need amen speak to god amen and he says that my people shall humble himself and pray i will yeah amen so we must speak the word amen amen so that's what we're going to go back to really when we get back to healing again but right now in this form god showed us he's given the power to speak amen if you drink any deadly thing you don't come here amen if you tap on on the serpent he won't harm you paul was there busy preaching the gospel and he ended up on an island and uh you know those people were living there and uh while he was there by the fire it was cold and the youth serpent came and put him in amen and those people who were waiting for him to die fell not dead they know the snakes were deadly but paul just caught him you just shook it off his hand and he called you praise a lot so there is power in the word of god but we are going back to that again the spirit man we're gonna be like god again right now we are we are also amateur gods we are gods amen amen that the prophets were gods see but not not the little eternal god but they have moses wasn't god to the people see when god said to the prophet he's a god coming to the people amen to bring a message because the mock peace of god amen so now just put it in us there's a spirit in us now how many of you know that that spirit can come out of your body not only when you die while you're living you can make the spirit come out of your body and people are doing that and it's not very difficult the train they just sleep there and they're trying to be still and just you know be motionless something this pull actually comes off and travels around and when it comes out the body it can see he can hear he can move around and the people that have done that the spirit came out of the body and they moved around the neighborhood they can fly over the area and look everywhere and things and come back into the body so they practice and then then they go a little farther maybe go around the neighborhood then go right around phoenix then they can go to government come back i tell you it sounds good and they come back into the body now that is called astral projection how many have you heard of that astro projection it is real see you're gonna check it out and see it's real and then people do it but there's going to come a final time when this body you know god is ready to take us away the spirit will leave the body right i think science has also done experiments but a person is dying and they had cameras there and all this thing and they actually saw the time when the spirit leaves the body see by scientific means they saw the spirit leave the body see so remember our real self is a spirit this body is only a tabernacle it's a dwelling place right so we find in uh in genesis verse 31 it says and the evening and the morning were the sixth day and then we go to genesis chapter 2 we're going to read from verse 5 there and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was no man to to the ground so god made man in the spirit form but he said there was no man to till the ground amen so if harry was just like a man he was already there so why god said there's no man to to the ground but they went up a mist from the earth and water the face the whole face of the ground and the lord god formed then of the dust of the ground [Music] and breathe it into his nose clothes the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man who he had formed see so we find first god made man in his image a spirit man that just because nobody through the ground he formed him out of the dust of the ground and he breathed the breath of life right so that god god is a spirit anybody can say amen to that god he says create it but god has also got a man form amen god is a spirit but he's also got a man form you say why do you say that now in the book of ezekiel ezekiel 1 26 and 28 when ezekiel was seen you know the four beasts like creatures that were in the prince of god and he was describing these four creatures are they aware and the bible tells us here now it came a time when they stood they always had their wings up but they stood the wings were down and when the small creatures were still then the battle tells us here while these four creatures were standing stroke ezekiel 126. i begin up there and above the firmament over the heads the the beast right was the likeness of a throne in likeness like unto sapphire stone and the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man i above it now ezekiel is looking into heaven at the throne of god now what he says if he sees that the appearance of a man ezekiel is looking right there in the friends of god where this beast and all these creatures are he sees the appearance of a man [Music] right now when moses wanted to see god god moses saw that burning bush and it was not burnt and he turned aside and then he heard the boy speaking it was god speaking to him i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob right so abraham uh moses was hearing the voice but he decided to see god amen i'm hearing this voice and i'm speaking and it's reply but now i want to see i want to see you lord he said god i want to see you [Music] and then it is exodus 33 19 look what moses sees you want to see god exodus 33 19-23 and he said i will make my goodness fast before you and will proclaim before you my name the lord and i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy or whom i will show mercy that you can go read back in romans chapter 9 god can do what he wants amen he can show his mercy and grace on whomsoever he will that's why we ought to be so thankful to god that he chose us amen many other people have not chosen amen oh we have to thank god for that that many other people are to see the things that we see many other people ought to believe the things that we believe but we are seeing things that they can't see we have seen the supernatural of god amen coming in our day and it's timely revealed to us that this is god again with us amen a lot of people are not privileged to see that so you don't blame them one day when they question and they uh you know and they say things because they don't understand it well god has revealed it to us so we thank god for that so it says that in romans 9 who can say to the vessel why you made me what you made me god will do what you want amen so we thank god he made us you know we're not talking about the flesh we talk about the spirit amen what he made us because everybody walking around is a spirit also everywhere you walk into the plaza as you walk everywhere those are spirits see god is a spirit and uh we know the bible says the holy spirit might be believing in us and if people don't want to understand and believe that how come evil spirits dwell in people how come a person can be possessed with an evil spirit and those evil spirits can uh you know manifest themselves the very same way god's spirit dwells in us see evil spirits are dwelling in people so people are walking in the shopping malls and all all type of spirits but we thank god what he made us amen not that we are any special or you know something better for us i mean some of us are worst off and god i say people that you know we we may not have a good uh uh you know attitude of fine manners and refined ways but god made a way for us amen he saved us amen not be glad for that amen so god knew exactly what he was doing when he made us he knows how god knows how poor we must be i mean if you made us all very rich we won't be here honestly if you made us a multi-billions in our way you'll be in the world there not serving god so god knew exactly and yet god blesses people to have wealth like abraham was a very wealthy man job was very wealthy and they served god amen so god knew exactly what he gives us exactly what we need not what we want put us in our exact place and he blesses us amen so what he says there now i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy unto whom i will show mercy but he said you cannot see my face for man shall not see me and drive and the lord said there is a place by me where you should stand on the rock and while my glory passes by i will put you in the cleft of the rock i will cover you with my hand until i pass by then i will take away my hand and you shall see my back but my face you shall not see so when god god passed by moses saw the back parts of a man amen so god has got a body also moses saw the back parts of a man and he said no man shall see me and look but when he came as jesus christ we can see him amen amen we can look at him and not live not die i am the bread of life if any man believe in me he shall never die i will raise him up at the last day so in jesus christ we can see god amen so that's why the world in that day stumbled so much that he was so much man and he was so much gone francis the bible tells us the fullness of the goddess what is that father-son holy spirit the fullness of the godhead dwelt in the body can you make it more plain now so jesus was god walking amongst them those crimes and pharisees now he couldn't go and tell them i'm god i'm god i'm god i'm god no he walked amongst them he was promised to come to do the work of redemption see before it became dead in the flesh man he was the logos local spirits came out of god amen a part that came out of god the logos was made flesh which is the word so jesus was flesh man but he was word also amen in the beginning was the word the word wasn't god the word was god and the word became flesh so we are flesh but we are not word but we are coming to that place to be word see are we going to go back now he became us that we will become him amen there's an invisible union taking place amen amen so we are going to become word it started now amen now everything about jesus is just word word word word word so that's why people are going to miss out they are not going to be connected with him being the word amen and we're gonna be word in the flesh we go back to being word he was word became flesh amen why that it might do the work of redemption amen so it was a logos coming down and not really not you from the message the deity of jesus christ so listen carefully now an eternal what is a logos that came out of god what is the logos now he says this is a description of the logos an eternal an unchanging truth present from the time of creation available to every individual who seeks it so the logos is that that came out of god amen and he says available to every individual who seeks it we can be part of him i mean who is the bride now the pride is part of him he is the world so you are part of him amen if he is worth we are worth praise the lord but the prophet talking about abraham he says god couldn't take sarah because she was part of him amen now god can't take us we are part of him amen amen we're going to be part of him the word amen so we thank god for that right i said that someone was speaking the other day and he said god what was he when he was back yonder billions and billions years ago when it was just like the space here and then it gathered up into the logos and then it came from the logos down into christ the lord is christ god the lord was carried from from god and into christ from the form of the logos came into the form of christ amen see is just god coming down like this to the earth then going right back again to god again amen don't you see what i mean just revolving coming into the logos from logos into the man that returning back again for one purpose to redeem that man they have to follow them well branson how much of time he took for us amen amen that's what we must appreciate amen he became from god to the romans right a blood of fire came out of god into christ to do the work of redemption amen amen to take on the form of a man amen he had to become what kingsman redeemer he had to be king's faults with us amen he became relationships amen like naomi somebody had to do the work of redemption amen and who does that christ did the work of redemption amen took the gentile bride amen thank you amen and connected to the jewish church the army praise the lord so what we are then god made away for us the logo is coming down so people doesn't understand who this jesus is and they all said you being a man you're making yourself work and all these things that took up stones to destroy him amen they never understood and they never accepted as as as they anointed on the messiah they rejected him and up to today people's hearts are being open to who the messiah is there's thousands and thousands of jews in israel and other parts of the world that now see that jesus is a messiah the gospel is preached to them isaiah 53 is one of the key chapters here and there in the book of isaiah they're telling the people they ask them first please read yeah isaiah 53 and tell me who it's talking off describes jesus christ perfectly coming to die and give his life then they realize you know what we see it that was the messiah amen so thousands of people are coming and becoming christian jews but believe that jesus was the messiah and the others are still hard and the word accepted no no no if he was a messiah he's supposed to be a adult from here he's supposed to be destroyed you know he's supposed to do it with the romans and there's no peace here amongst us but jesus said my kingdom is not of this world if it was of this world my subjects will fight for it amen but he never come for a kingdom yeah john the baptist came prepared for the kingdom of god is at heaven see so they reject not jesus messiah i mean the romans here they ruling and controlling us and everything else and so but hundreds of them thousands of them are now seeing who jesus was amen and even in the muslim world in iran right now thousands of uh iranian iranian muslims are becoming christians see so what it says here for one purpose to redeem the man then the troll now that's what he came for to be a redeemer and god before he could be a redeemer he had to be according to the law a kinsmen redeemer he had to be kings folks to us in relation a kingman redeemer can't just be any foreigner must have some relationship with the one he's going to redeem and the bible tells us we were created in the image of god amen amen then because of disobedience in the garden of heaven we falter and the only way he can bring us back himself god was in christ reconciling aspect to himself thank you lord amen praise the lord i'd be glad for that amen so we can see now who we are the spirit god never redeemed the flesh now you amen amen the spirit this flesh is going to die this flesh is going to go to the dust it's going to go to every element there it's in the face of the earth we know we are made what prophet said 16 elements and all that's going to go back to the ground but the prophet said whether we get cremated whether you are fed behind whether you are uh drowning the sea in that time when we're going to be resurrected we will come forth amen so if anybody got questions about remember cremating some people got questions you know hey if you burn me up i'll be completely finished the brother said i'll read the code just now even if you are cremated if they don't cremate you you're still going to go there if the fires don't get you their insect is going to get you there ants skin worms can you eat this bunny up that's why if they don't freeze your quickly now within four days your body is start rocking and they say now they find bodies you know maybe somebody got killed or something when they come to that body it stinks amen terrible stink see so that is what this body is yes this body gonna rot it's gonna go to the ground if it's not buried it's going to stink but he came to redeem the spirit amen that was part of him amen and that's why we are kids folks [Music] relationship with him praise the lord that's what we are excited about not just being an organization or going to a church and thinking now you know when you're saved no redemption he came to redeem us praise the lord okay ah he goes on and god in the beginning made his first man he made him out of spirit and spirit is the invisible part of man that you don't see like a corporate caleb jenna the invisible part of man amen that we don't see so just remember this every time you talk to a person you are talking to the spirit if your husband and wife are talking at home you are talking to the spirit when you talk to your children you're talking to the spirit just dwelling in the body amen and if something happens to his body and instantly if he dies in an accident or something let's put it leaves i'd like you to go check out that astral projection and see not only christians non-christians they can practice to come out of this body girlfriend find books on it and and you'll see i read one book wrong many years ago and the guy trained in practice and he came under the body and flew over the neighborhood and he came back into the body slipped in now that's what happened to our prophet when he went beyond the captain of time amen his spirit left his body and caring and when he went beyond they recognized him amen our precious brother but his body was lying there on the bed but he said our precious brother if he had not come he wouldn't have been yet he recognized him amen and the angel told him he asked why are you because he was a leader on earth amen and these are all your people and people you mean these are all branhams there was not so many granites no these are all your converts see and the body of 190 year 90 years old was so much changed and looking young and beautiful you never recognize them amen thank you sir do you know her oh when she was 90 you led her to christ praise the lord so his body was there but his footed left amen and yet he was in a body there and he says he look he was young again amen praise the lord i'll tell you what we got to be excited here don't worry about corona virus or any sickness or any other jesus let anything take place we got the word of god amen amen we know we're not going to be here forever anyway amen we're going to step into the new body amen we're going to step into the theory amen praise the lord i'll be glad for that so stop worrying now about all these things what's going to happen what's not going to happen things going to happen quickly then we can go quicker amen i tell you brother and sister if you can look at this and all god's plan and everything i'll tell you what we don't have to be flustered here we don't have to worry about you know what am i living for and having all this problem now god put us in the flesh shall be tried and tested amen every son of god must be tried every son of god must be tested god i don't know he takes pleasure in that he likes it to test us to put us into a fix to put us into a situation amen god intended it like that and after we had tried and tested to see what we are made of all this goodness and mercy see now a lot of people when they come under this testing and trial and they're going through you know some problem and don't know what's happening and god not undertaking for them maybe their children out of hand the children not serving god the children are taking drugs they're mixed up in the world they want to know what's happening i don't believe in god amen i can't serve this god look what's happening to me but there's others that hold on they know they're going through a test they never going through a trial and and god has given us in the word to show us job was tested amen job was right and he came forth victorious wasn't god putting him to a trial tested him so much brought him to the gutters took away his wealth took away his family that he was the most respected place man in the place they all now walked away from him and then turned away what do we for he didn't want to know job you see what the testing did but he held on he had faith in god amen then he believed that's why i said even if the skin worms destroy this body yet i will see god again francis we've got to be tried and tested see the bible tells us that he says no parents will have children they won't discipline them correct them warn them amen that's what god is amen testing us warning us and putting us to this place okay so he made man out of spirit and spirit is the invisible part of man that you don't see and god made man in his own image are you listening to me are you listening to me he's asking the communication right all right god made man in his own image amen and god is the spirit said the bible and the first man that was made at the government over all creation amen just like the holy spirit has government over the church today he left the creation he led the animals but there was no man to tone the soil so god made man out of the dust of the earth and that man he might have given him a hand like a monkey he might have given him feet like a bird whatever he did he just thrown it together and made a man amen but this man he put this immortal spirit that never dies into this man and he become more than a brute he become a man amen now they talk about the serpent there the serpent was the highest form of all the beast amen the serpent was intelligent the serpent can talk and god created him for a purpose see that he'll be active in fulfilling god's plan amen just like judas was active in fulfilling god's plan because as the serpent never did what he did he wouldn't have become a kinsmen redeemer amen there will be no fall amen so god plant it like that when god put them in the flesh body he knew that he was gonna fall he knew it because he is god amen but wait for him to bruise the head of the serpent amen amen this man did that's what i think that atheists and some of them standing around arguing but the hour has come when god sheds what is light there is an hour there that when god is doing things that's right so when they argue well he sweet looks like a bear and his hands look like a head a monkey and so forth and they try to say try to say his original origin come to them that has nothing to do with it this is a body of flesh that he's just living in like a house it's going back to the dust of the earth but the spirit is immortal it comes from god that's the image of god amen god is a spirit amen that man lost his origin in the garden of eden his relationship communion with god was cut up there because of sin and unbelief see unbelief in what the word of god amen praise the lord now that is what christianity about it's not just one religion it's all to do with the original plan of god it's not to say we gotta belong to an organization or some system and we're gonna get our life no it all goes back to the garden of eden amen praise the lord so god became a man from spirit to man we from man to spirit one day we're gonna have a body and finally when we go to eternity amen you know we're gonna be like the angels amen are the angels do you think angels got blood in the body do you think angel got organs like us huh no we're gonna be like the angels am i amen we're not going to have organs that's going to fail we're not going to have a heart attack i mean i've never heard anywhere where the angel architect can fell down yet they've got no problem they're there for eternity and they were created before us amen they're still living and looking the same today gabriel came to mary fianna upset from the presence of almighty god to tell you the holy ghost is going to overshadow you and you're going to have a baby and you must call his name jesus be savior he will save the people from the sins amen see it all goes down to the fall the gabriel came to john's father zacharias they were holding no children came there while he was doing the office of priesthood in the temple and told him you know what you're gonna have a son you must call his name john amen god was preparing special people to come on the earth and that angel gabriel looked to say when he was created millions and millions of years ago amen and gabriel will come and announce his coming again the prophet said i don't know how it's going to happen but gabriel going to announce his coming amen so be prepared for the supernatural amen if he came to murray don't be type don't marry or we type mary mary types us be it unto me according to thy word amen so don't come and ask me how enough because the prophet said gabriel announced his first coming april runs his second coming i don't know what's going to happen but it's going to happen praise the lord okay time is going let's just look at the scripture here now that god came from from logos the spirit coming into a word body that jesus was the word amen i said we bypass our three of neutralia jesus never bypassed he was word and flesh amen that's why everybody got confused they never saw a man like this before and if you looked at uh you know you've got some movies today many movies are made about jesus there i mean he's just one of the men taking the character of jesus and you know we look at it you know what he looked like everybody else and what really attracted the people to him there was something in him that attracted him the bible says when he called nephew come and follow me nephew went straight away all the other disciples peter and they were fishing his brother andrew they were fishing come and follow me your name is simon the son of jonah you never said you know what nobody ever even told me that before so there was something different about here although he was a man and all the rest of the people jesus had many sisters following him faithful sisters mary there was about two or three marys amen many of them salome and one he cast seven demons out of them amen mary magdalene they were there something attracted them but the others never got affected see there was something special about jesus and yet the other people couldn't see that the priest had said ah you know what through this guy you're coming to stay up the people and start another religion and all smack him on the face but when they come to the judgment all this is going to play back those soldiers there crucifying him and after the spirit left him the thunders rode the earthquakes the rocks fell off the mountains it got dark and their soldier came and stood by the cross truly this was the son of god see so he came god came as a son amen praise the lord that's why talk you like you know i'm going back from where i came yet the flesh was born here okay let's read the hebrews here quickly the book of hebrews hebrews chapter one let us follow the scripture a little bit and then you see who jesus won and how he came to make a way for us it's god coming as a man praise the lord now the bible tells us hebrews chapter 1 god who had saturday times and diamonds matters spoke in times past unto the fathers by the prophets and in his last days spoken unto us by his son whom he had appointed here of all things for whom also he made the walls who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person look what the bible is saying about jesus who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power where he had by himself first our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty and i being made so much better than angels as he had my inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they for unto which of the angel said he at any time thou art my son this day i have begotten thee and again i will be to email father and he shall be to be a son but let's look at this relationship further verse six and again when he bring it in death begotten into the world the first begotten of the world he said let all the angels of god worship him amen who's that muslim worship jesus now tune his people huh generous witness let all the angels worship in amen god yet god said i will not share my glory with anyone amen but i said let all the angels worship him and jesus when he stood on the earth he said if you believe in god believe also in me know what a big statement that is you believe in god believe also in me that's why people are blinded this friend is body and three days i will raise her up again and the bible says god raised his body up matthew's twenty four jesus said that destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up amen i will raise you up at the last day i am the resurrection and the life amen see i am the way the truth and the life amen so there is no other faith otherwise you know nothing i am the way i am the truth i am the life if any man come to me i will not cast out i will raise him up in the last days amen praise the lord okay so now let all the angels worship him and of the angels he said who make it his angel spirit and his minister is a flame of fire but unto the sun he's saying look what onto the sun is saying you're hearing follow me but under the sun he said thy throne oh god is forever in heaven a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom amen thomas love righteousness and idioliquity therefore god even die god and anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows amen him as a man and also referring him to be heir of all things question and now lord in the beginning and laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of their hands they shall perish but our remains remain and they all shall wax old as got a garment as a wester not that it's a piece of clothing shall fold up pull them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail amen talking about jesus christ but to which of the angels said me at any time sit on my right hand until i make thy enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering spirits and form to minister for them we shall be heard of salvation praise the lord so from from spirit god to logos the word to man he became man from spirit we from flesh go back to the spirit that's already in us now god is not going to change the spirit the prophet said we take the same character we are with us the spirit is the nature of the soul the prophet said that isn't it the spirit is the nature of the soul so if you talk to a person another friend mention you talk to a person for a few minutes you can see what type of a person they are you know what they're from spirit some people you don't even have to talk to them maybe just look to them look at them or maybe pass it by you can see what type of person they are amen you know i mean the look is on the face like that you can tell the type of people there see because of the spirit in them praise god so we can you know there's so much here to go now see so what we do we go back to our word bodies amen we'll have all the same uh you know what we have now we can see we can hear we can talk we can do everything in that word body ebay came us so we can become in we are tested and tried here all for god's glory amen see we are not tested for our glory how many of us want to be testable no we we don't want to go through the testing it's yeah it's a hard time see when god is going to put the test upon you sometime and and everybody's going to turn against you and everything else yeah the prophet somebody said bad things about the prophet and and you know they took off with him and picked on him and something the brother can say you're staying quiet why are you you know he said oh brother that was predestinated before the foundation the lord put to put me through a test he's not going to go fussy with a hug you know see sometimes we go through a test the church believers will go through a test see some people will turn against the pastor they'll turn against his wife the prophecy now they can't finish with that apostle then define the fault of the dog yeah they find your fault and you'll wonder you know what they're so good people now whatever why they tend against you that probably said why should i care they can trample you they can kick you dead men don't respond let them kick you a little bit you're dead let them trample you let them say all men other things and you wonder why it happens you know people look at the church this church other churches they'll turn against one another why oh the problem said no people come under the uh you know pretense of being church fellowship there that the devil will use the same one to talk about use the same one to target the pastor put you through a test now you said now is that true i tell you what one time david king david his men were there and uh i think he's put on david's face the king saw his man standing there his body god he said shall that man spit on my king he said let me go and chop his head off there he said no no no god told him to do that god told him to put on david that's what david said put her into a test show you know what this is the stage you come to and god said god said was put on him was god showing david what he even thought of him they could have killed it do you know that in the nations here other countries you know you speak one word about the president you'll go to prison yeah you can zimbabwe you talk openly about the prisoner president prison so that's why they said to death now we're going to chop his head off he's putting on the king god told him to do that sometimes god is going to tell people to turn against you god is going to tell your wife to turn against you god is going to tell the husband to turn against you ah you know what no why is this happening lord will you you're going through a test raise the road i think we're going off there but i've got so much more we can go through here you know every time i think i print there's so many quotes and everything else but we don't really finish everything see we talk talk and inspiration come in and and all this thing so we thank god so don't be in despair you're not you know in this flesh bodybuilders can come in this flesh body our lord what's going to happen and yet he told us also don't take thought for tomorrow what you're going to eat and what you're going to wear and yet we do that and why i was going to come to the world tell me what we're going to have this

is redeemed so let us walk in the spirit see and not fulfill the desires in the lust from the flesh the bible says there's a war going on if you're a spirit man and a flesh man there's a war going on you want to serve god but the spirit man comes he stumbles you the flesh man stumbles you that's why you get grieved here when when you know you've done something and you should do you get greed you feel sorrowful see so there's a wall going on amen so which one is going to win the one you feed the most [Music] you feed the spirit man the word of god he's gonna win the freshmen can't win but if
