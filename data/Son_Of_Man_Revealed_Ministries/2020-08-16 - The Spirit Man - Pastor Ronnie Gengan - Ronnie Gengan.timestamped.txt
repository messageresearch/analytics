[20:45] i love you now
[20:48] more than ever
[20:51] before as possible let's sing it out
[20:56] oh more than ever
[21:06] [Music]
[21:14] now
[21:20] [Music]
[21:28] foreign
[21:30] i love you
[21:53] the world is waiting for a superman
[21:56] right now amen
[21:59] isn't it the world is waiting for
[22:02] somebody to come and rescue them
[22:04] right because a lot of
[22:09] nations are seeking for answers
[22:13] and they got no answers to what's
[22:14] happening
[22:16] so you know the prophet tells us in the
[22:19] book
[22:20] the seals they're waiting for a superman
[22:24] somebody that can come and uh give them
[22:26] assurance
[22:28] rescue them take them out of the crisis
[22:33] that's what the prophet said say that's
[22:36] the world
[22:38] but we thank god that we have once
[22:40] rescued us
[22:42] he came to our rescue long ago praise
[22:45] the lord and
[22:46] we know where we are heading for yes
[22:47] ma'am where is the lord
[22:49] so the world is in uh actually in a
[22:51] confusion
[22:53] nations are actually now prepared for
[22:55] war
[22:57] if you really follow the news of things
[23:00] you'll see they are
[23:02] bringing out all the rockets and
[23:04] missiles and
[23:05] all these things creating it on the
[23:08] trucks
[23:10] see so i think some place a prophet said
[23:14] just take one man that just goes crazier
[23:18] that
[23:19] time is press the button and the rockets
[23:22] will go off
[23:23] i mean china can do that right now
[23:27] isn't it just press the button send the
[23:30] rockets to
[23:31] america and america can send to them
[23:37] so all the nations are racing and it's a
[23:40] it's a very tense time also for israel
[23:42] right now we just had news this past
[23:46] week
[23:47] that the uae is right
[23:51] they made a treaty with israel to be
[23:54] friendly with them so all the
[23:57] other arab nations are not happy about
[23:59] it
[24:00] and then i think somebody posted a
[24:02] jeffers
[24:04] the airport is on fire to burn the
[24:07] airport
[24:09] see so all these tensions are coming
[24:12] there and israelis in the situation
[24:14] but we know these things happen
[24:17] according to the word of god and uh
[24:19] all the nations will gather uh jerusalem
[24:22] will be
[24:23] surrounded right we know it's gonna
[24:25] happen right
[24:27] and when your tribulation is gonna set
[24:29] in the bride is gonna go amen
[24:31] amen three and a half years the wedding
[24:34] supper
[24:35] man praise the lord and then we go to
[24:37] the millennium
[24:39] we got we actually got a bright future
[24:41] there not here
[24:44] yeah it's gloomy but we got a bright
[24:47] future there
[24:48] see and we got to look forward to that
[24:51] amen and god has made a way seeing for
[24:55] us to get there
[24:57] so we i think part of the message is
[24:59] going to be centered on that
[25:01] are we going to get it because god has
[25:02] made a way for us amen
[25:04] so just thank him and uh appreciate him
[25:07] and uh love him you know i'm just
[25:09] thinking while you're singing more than
[25:10] ever before
[25:12] uh i was just thinking how the prophet
[25:14] loved the lord amen
[25:16] he loved the lord jesus amen and he
[25:18] expressed it
[25:19] amen you know the way he says he loved
[25:22] jesus we never hear anybody say that
[25:24] no and we have a personal
[25:28] relationship a personal encounter
[25:31] with the lord and he and he really loved
[25:34] him then
[25:35] that's why when he saw reality
[25:38] he made uh you know
[25:42] he said i'm gonna fully surrender amen
[25:45] his whole life to look for the lord
[25:49] amen and he did that seem to look at
[25:53] real life
[25:56] so thank god for a man like that but
[25:59] really love the lord
[26:01] and express the lord jesus christ and he
[26:04] had to be a special
[26:06] person because uh you know he was a son
[26:08] of man
[26:09] revealing these son of man amen
[26:14] and to have that special bond praise the
[26:17] lord i'll be glad for them
[26:18] amen praise the lord so we thank god so
[26:21] uh
[26:23] yeah our health will be gloomy and all
[26:26] these things that
[26:27] but we've got a bright future out of
[26:30] this world amen
[26:32] raise them up that's what we're looking
[26:33] for see we're looking for escape there
[26:36] so today god will break away from us and
[26:38] uh
[26:39] we'd like to uh have a brother's
[26:42] fellowship
[26:43] amen on thursday night not a brother's
[26:47] meeting
[26:47] [Music]
[26:48] just fellowship right so just come on
[26:52] on thursday if you can make it yeah as
[26:55] early as possible so we don't go very
[26:57] late the careful is still on
[26:59] they said they uh be level two but they
[27:01] still got carefully from ten
[27:03] i think to five in the morning so you
[27:06] can't travel after 10.
[27:09] so we can get here we'll try and get you
[27:11] about 6 30
[27:13] and just a fellowship general discussion
[27:15] we haven't uh
[27:16] met for a long time and you know i just
[27:19] a general fellowship and
[27:20] things like that there's certain things
[27:22] we want to just
[27:24] discuss and things like that so so every
[27:27] brother
[27:28] should be on thursday and we pray you
[27:30] know it's our fellowship the time of
[27:32] fellowship
[27:34] i mean uh you know i think
[27:37] we don't we don't find uh any better
[27:40] reason to gather household other people
[27:43] we are gathered for a brother's
[27:44] fellowship okay so just come
[27:48] so it's not a meeting to discuss any
[27:50] church matters or anything
[27:52] just a general fellowship and uh as we
[27:55] start
[27:55] you know we can see what what the
[27:57] fellowship is about
[27:58] so pray god will make a way for us
[28:00] praise the lord
[28:02] return to our bible this morning the
[28:04] book of genesis
[28:06] chapter one
[28:10] so i pray this morning that the word of
[28:12] god will speak to our hearts
[28:15] and we need something uh something solid
[28:20] you know something uh scriptural
[28:23] something word based
[28:26] right now when everybody is in a doubt
[28:29] what's happening
[28:31] even children may not understand what's
[28:32] happening
[28:34] they might have a lot of questions
[28:37] of what's happening and you know in the
[28:39] world here and
[28:40] all these things that so let's find some
[28:43] bible
[28:44] assurance something to give us reason
[28:48] not to say listen yeah
[28:50] we don't have to worry because the word
[28:52] of god is telling us something
[28:54] and we're going to look forward to that
[28:56] so we just pray for them also
[28:59] see as young people that we can have
[29:01] questions and all these things
[29:03] so we pray god will speak to us we also
[29:06] remember the uh the live stream uh
[29:09] audience out there we got to bless them
[29:12] and go to make our way and we are level
[29:15] 2 but they still got
[29:16] restrictions of 50 but a few more can
[29:19] still come
[29:20] i think we're getting here about 35 40
[29:23] 35 40.
[29:24] so we can still actually get everybody
[29:26] back so they shouldn't stay too wrong
[29:29] especially if they've got children
[29:31] because the children will get used to
[29:32] not coming to church
[29:35] and then others wouldn't get into them
[29:38] so once they lose that interest
[29:41] and they'll be drawn away see we don't
[29:44] don't want that to happen to them
[29:46] somebody said strain of the child in the
[29:48] ways of the lord
[29:49] amen so don't let some other influence
[29:52] come and say no you know we don't have
[29:53] to really go to church and
[29:55] we don't have to really serve god there
[29:57] and things like that
[29:58] because that's unscriptural and
[30:01] bible says we must gather as often as we
[30:04] can as we see the days
[30:06] fast approaching see so that's very
[30:08] important
[30:09] so we pray god will bless them and also
[30:12] brother sunny is uh spoke to him this
[30:14] friday is recovering quite well
[30:18] from a few days and then uh they're
[30:20] still draining the water from his lungs
[30:23] he's got a bag there that the water
[30:24] drains and they're gonna monitor and see
[30:26] how flight
[30:27] clears up but they said no they don't
[30:30] want to keep him also too long in
[30:31] hospital because it's uh
[30:33] it's not a place where he should be with
[30:35] all these viruses and all that
[30:37] they are willing for him also to go home
[30:40] so hopefully one of these days
[30:42] he should be back home and uh so every
[30:45] day he's gonna
[30:46] you know it's uh it's gonna get used to
[30:48] having one land
[30:50] and breathing on one run and also they
[30:52] say the lung also starts to expand
[30:55] and take another portion of the place
[30:57] where the other one was
[30:59] so all that process is going to take
[31:00] some time and uh
[31:02] it's going to be so pray for him that
[31:04] god will make him happy with all
[31:06] amen amen that's our prayer and our
[31:08] desire you look to the book of uh
[31:12] genesis this morning chapter one
[31:15] genesis chapter one reading from verse
[31:18] 24
[31:24] genesis 1 24
[31:35] and god said let the earth bring forth
[31:38] the living creature after his kind
[31:42] cattle and creeping king and beast of
[31:46] the earth
[31:47] after his kind and it was so
[31:50] and god made the beast of the earth
[31:53] after his kind
[31:55] the cattle after their kind and
[31:58] everything that creeped
[31:59] upon the earth after his kind
[32:03] and god saw that it was good
[32:06] and god said let us make man
[32:09] in our image amen after
[32:13] our likeness and let them have dominion
[32:17] over the fish of the sea and over the
[32:20] falls over here
[32:22] and over the cattle and over all the
[32:25] earth
[32:27] and every creeping thing
[32:30] that creeped upon the earth
[32:33] so god created man in his whole image
[32:36] amen in the image of god
[32:44] supply and replenish the earth and
[32:48] subdue it
[32:49] and have dominion over the fish on the
[32:50] sea or the falls of the air
[32:53] and over every living thing that

[33:19] jesus we
[33:20] thank you this morning lord for your
[33:22] grace and mercy
[33:24] and lord even as we read the scriptures
[33:26] here lord
[33:28] we know even as we stand right here we
[33:30] are creatures of time
[33:33] but lord we know one day we're going to
[33:34] be creatures of eternity and that's what
[33:38] we are looking for
[33:40] and lord you will put us here for the
[33:42] purpose
[33:48] that god is therefore and serving
[33:51] and we pray lord that your will be done
[33:55] we want to say not my will but your will
[33:57] be done
[33:58] therefore we are looking for this
[34:01] glorious
[34:02] promise and this glorious hope even as
[34:04] the word is promised us
[34:07] and lord when you start today in the
[34:09] garden of eden
[34:11] give you exactly what you agree for you
[34:14] had a plan
[34:17] and lord you want to fulfill all your
[34:19] plans and
[34:20] and all your desires when you started
[34:23] mandate the garden of eden
[34:26] and lord we see where we have ended
[34:28] right today
[34:29] but we still have your promise and we
[34:32] are looking forward to the promise
[34:35] amen has said uh the prophet said
[34:38] yeah for a purpose each and every one of
[34:42] us here for a purpose
[34:44] see and our life didn't stop
[34:48] when our parents brought us here on
[34:50] earth
[34:52] our life never started there
[34:55] we were in god's talk long before that
[34:58] amen so god made a way for us to come
[35:00] here
[35:01] through our parents so he had a purpose
[35:04] for us to be here
[35:05] amen now if each and every one of us can
[35:08] trace back our dna
[35:10] amen even we can go
[35:13] trace back up they got memes today
[35:17] if you got your real names
[35:20] your real names your surname you know
[35:23] like i was saying
[35:24] now it's a confusion after they came
[35:27] here
[35:28] you know all different surnames and we
[35:31] don't know what's going on
[35:33] but if you got your real surname at all
[35:35] they can trace you right back
[35:38] they can trace each and every one of us
[35:40] back to india
[35:42] amen and from india
[35:45] they can trace us back
[35:49] right to where we came in the beginning
[35:52] even right to the garden of eden amen
[35:55] see so we never came here just when we
[35:57] were born
[35:58] [Music]
[35:59] you can trace our theology
[36:02] like the phrase jesus right back there
[36:05] see so the bible says now god created us
[36:09] in his image
[36:10] amen you see what i'm saying
[36:13] now what is the image of god
[36:17] god is the spirit amen so god made man
[36:21] in his image
[36:23] so what is that image a spirit amen
[36:26] so god made us a spirited man
[36:31] before we became flesh
[36:34] like adam was a spirited man
[36:38] see now adam was created on the sixth
[36:42] day
[36:43] of god's creation after god created
[36:46] everything
[36:47] you can read on the back there in the
[36:49] bible
[36:51] and the evening and the morning were the
[36:52] sixth day that's genesis
[36:55] 1 31 see god created man on the sixth
[36:59] day
[37:00] the last day of his creation so that was
[37:02] a spirit man
[37:05] wasn't in the flesh later on he put him
[37:08] in the flesh
[37:11] maybe was the dust of the earth
[37:15] and he breathed the breath of life into
[37:17] him and he became a living soul
[37:22] see so now each and every one of
[37:25] us here is a spirit
[37:30] we are living in a flesh body
[37:35] but each and every one is a spirit amen
[37:39] now if uh if i talk to you
[37:42] or we talk to one another who do you
[37:45] think we are talking to
[38:01] see that
[38:04] hello brother caleb how are you
[38:09] you okay are you happy
[38:13] praise the lord now who did i talk to
[38:20] i spoke to the spirit
[38:23] these bodies that's the body
[38:27] he never answered me from his heart
[38:30] or any other organ he never even
[38:34] answered me from his brain
[38:36] amen i mean all those there the
[38:39] facilities are there for us to think at
[38:40] all
[38:41] but the real response was the spirit
[38:46] amen so each and every one of us is the
[38:48] spirit
[38:50] and the prophet tells us and the word
[38:52] tells us
[38:53] that this spirit is immortal
[38:57] immortal immortal means can never die
[39:01] amen god cannot die
[39:05] right but when god has made a plan of
[39:08] salvation
[39:09] and all those that were disobedient
[39:12] and when they come to the final white
[39:14] throne judgment
[39:16] then god is able to destroy the body and
[39:18] the spirit
[39:20] completely see
[39:23] so we know that this body now is uh he's
[39:26] a spirit is the spirit in us
[39:30] see always have that in your mind and
[39:32] thought now
[39:36] if he if the spirit leaves his body what
[39:37] happens to us
[39:39] falls down although we've got a skeleton
[39:43] here holding us up
[39:45] we've got skeletons we've got muscles
[39:47] and everything else
[39:49] he's holding us up but let the spirit
[39:53] leaves
[39:54] his body will just fall down
[39:58] so there's a spirit in there
[40:02] that what god he put us in his body here
[40:04] but that spirit will continue to live
[40:07] amen amen and then god has made another
[40:09] body for us
[40:10] it's not a flesh body we're going to go
[40:13] back to our word body
[40:14] amen that's what we're looking for
[40:17] is to go back to our word body
[40:21] and in that word body right we'll come
[40:24] back we will live there in the millennia
[40:28] praise the lord we love bodies and the
[40:29] prophet tells us
[40:31] there we can eat and live like normal
[40:33] human beings
[40:34] amen but yet we won't be in the flesh
[40:38] we can have a body change praise the
[40:41] lord
[40:42] right so now there's a spirit in us
[40:45] right now the bomb says
[40:48] cream not the spirit of god
[40:53] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[40:57] redemption amen
[40:58] sorry grieve not the spirit
[41:01] so when we do something wrong
[41:05] that we should not do right
[41:09] then the spirit get greed
[41:12] the body doesn't get grieved
[41:16] no ways the body is going to get greed
[41:18] the spirit get greedy amen
[41:21] when something happens some disaster or
[41:25] something strikes you
[41:27] your spirit is troubled
[41:31] isn't it you get down at it you are
[41:33] troubled in your spirit
[41:36] see sarah the spirit is there
[41:40] right so that will go back
[41:45] to be in the garden of eden before like
[41:48] adam was put into the flesh
[41:52] before ellie was put in the flesh he had
[41:54] dominion
[41:56] he had control over everything in the
[41:58] garden of eden
[42:00] he was an amateur god
[42:04] amen and god gave him authority
[42:08] amen name all the animals
[42:13] everything that he named and whatever it
[42:15] was uh
[42:16] whatever it did in the garden animate
[42:18] control amen
[42:19] he gave him complete control so we are
[42:22] going back to that
[42:23] amen and god showed us some of these
[42:25] things here in the life of the prophet
[42:27] amen
[42:29] how the word can be spoken like god
[42:32] spoke there
[42:33] he said let it let there be so i wonder
[42:36] when the brothers are going in there
[42:38] i think for squirrels there was no
[42:40] squirrels
[42:42] so he didn't know you were like in those
[42:44] girls sitting by the tree there
[42:46] then the holy spirit came and told him
[42:47] you know what what the scripture says
[42:51] if you speak to the mountain amen
[42:55] then the prophet says you know what i
[42:56] never really understood
[42:58] this and that's why i never preached it
[43:01] and he says now what he says is speak to
[43:02] the mountain amen
[43:04] whatsoever you have need of you came to
[43:08] out
[43:08] squirrels why don't you speak amen and
[43:11] brian's sisters
[43:12] he was doubting he thought he was in a
[43:15] dream
[43:16] he thought he was in a vision he put his
[43:18] fingers to make sure he's alive
[43:20] and awake and he was
[43:24] then he said okay let the school come
[43:25] there and it came
[43:28] let it come in another place it came
[43:31] let it come in three squirrels he shot
[43:34] one time
[43:35] and another time was five spoilers amen
[43:40] he took that all many surely to the
[43:42] brothers and he ate it
[43:45] so we are going back to that
[43:48] speak the word amen now the prophet in
[43:51] the message say
[43:52] why can't i speak that's what we ought
[43:56] to be
[43:56] when we come to a situation we are not
[43:59] to be in despair
[44:00] we must speak amen we must speak the
[44:03] word and move on
[44:05] imagine joshua there fighting the battle
[44:08] there
[44:09] and uh you need to finish up the enemy
[44:11] and i tell you what
[44:12] he was just so busy and an inspiration
[44:15] struck him
[44:16] and he said son stand still amen
[44:19] and he also spoke to the moon not to
[44:21] move
[44:24] they obeyed grand sisters
[44:28] it was not actually the sun should still
[44:31] i mean the earth rotates and revolves
[44:33] around the sun so actually
[44:36] the sun the earth stopped moving
[44:39] the sun was still there the sun doesn't
[44:42] move
[44:44] but he said son we say the sun rise the
[44:46] sun doesn't rise
[44:51] we say the sun sets the sun doesn't sit
[44:56] if you look at the dirt going round
[45:00] right during the day faces the sun
[45:04] when it's gone the other side it's got
[45:06] nighttime
[45:09] so all the inspiration is spoke
[45:12] now there was no time to think about it
[45:14] there was no time to pray about it
[45:16] in that in the crucial hour he spoke
[45:21] and it happened francis said
[45:25] that's what's going to happen amen so
[45:28] don't cry
[45:30] speak when we have a need amen speak to
[45:33] god
[45:33] amen and he says that my people shall
[45:35] humble himself and pray i will yeah
[45:37] amen so we must speak the word amen
[45:41] amen so that's what we're going to go
[45:43] back to
[45:44] really when we get back to healing again
[45:48] but right now in this form god showed us
[45:50] he's given the power to speak
[45:52] amen if you drink any deadly thing you
[45:55] don't come here
[45:56] amen if you tap on on the serpent he
[45:59] won't harm you
[46:02] paul was there busy preaching the gospel
[46:04] and he ended up on an island
[46:06] and uh you know those people were living
[46:08] there and uh
[46:10] while he was there by the fire it was
[46:11] cold and the youth serpent came and put
[46:14] him
[46:14] in amen and those people who were
[46:16] waiting for him to die fell not dead
[46:18] they know the snakes were deadly but
[46:21] paul just caught him you just shook it
[46:22] off his hand and he called you
[46:25] praise a lot so there is power in the
[46:29] word of god
[46:30] but we are going back to that again the
[46:33] spirit man
[46:36] we're gonna be like god again
[46:39] right now we are we are also amateur
[46:42] gods
[46:44] we are gods amen amen that
[46:47] the prophets were gods
[46:51] see but not not the little
[46:55] eternal god but they have moses wasn't
[46:58] god to the people
[47:00] see when god said to the prophet he's a
[47:03] god coming to the people amen
[47:05] to bring a message because the mock
[47:08] peace of god
[47:10] amen so now just put it in us
[47:14] there's a spirit in us now how many of
[47:16] you know
[47:17] that that spirit can come out of your
[47:19] body
[47:21] not only when you die
[47:26] while you're living you can make the
[47:28] spirit come out of your body
[47:31] and people are doing that
[47:34] and it's not very difficult the train
[47:37] they just sleep there and they're
[47:38] trying to be still and just you know
[47:43] be motionless something this pull
[47:45] actually comes off
[47:47] and travels around
[47:50] and when it comes out the body it can
[47:53] see
[47:56] he can hear he can move around
[48:01] and the people that have done that
[48:05] the spirit came out of the body and they
[48:08] moved around the neighborhood
[48:10] they can fly over the area and look
[48:12] everywhere and things
[48:14] and come back into the body
[48:17] so they practice and then then they go a
[48:20] little farther
[48:23] maybe go around the neighborhood then go
[48:26] right around phoenix
[48:29] then they can go to government come back
[48:34] i tell you it sounds good and they come
[48:37] back into the body
[48:40] now that is called astral projection
[48:45] how many have you heard of that astro
[48:48] projection it is real
[48:54] see you're gonna check it out and see
[48:58] it's real and then people do it
[49:03] but there's going to come a final time
[49:05] when this body
[49:07] you know god is ready to take us away
[49:09] the spirit will leave the body
[49:13] right i think science has also done
[49:16] experiments but a person is dying
[49:20] and they had cameras there and all this
[49:22] thing
[49:24] and they actually saw the time when the
[49:26] spirit leaves the body
[49:29] see by scientific means they saw the
[49:32] spirit leave the body
[49:34] see so remember our real self is a
[49:39] spirit
[49:42] this body is only a tabernacle
[49:46] it's a dwelling place right so we find
[49:49] in uh
[49:49] in genesis verse 31 it says
[49:54] and the evening and the morning were the
[49:55] sixth day and then we go to genesis
[49:58] chapter 2
[49:59] we're going to read from verse 5 there
[50:03] and every plant of the field before it
[50:05] was in the earth
[50:06] and every herb of the field before it
[50:09] grew
[50:10] for the lord god had not caused it to
[50:12] rain upon the earth
[50:13] and there was no man to to the ground
[50:18] so god made man in the spirit form but
[50:20] he said
[50:21] there was no man to till the ground amen
[50:26] so if harry was just like a man he was
[50:29] already there
[50:31] so why god said there's no man to to the
[50:33] ground
[50:36] but they went up a mist from the earth
[50:38] and water
[50:40] the face the whole face of the ground
[50:44] and the lord god formed then of the dust
[50:47] of the ground
[50:48] [Music]
[50:50] and breathe it into his nose clothes the
[50:53] breath
[50:54] of life and man became a living soul
[50:59] and the lord god planted a garden
[51:01] eastward in eden
[51:03] and there he put the man who he had
[51:06] formed
[51:09] see so we find
[51:12] first god made man in his image
[51:15] a spirit man that just because nobody
[51:19] through the ground he formed him out of
[51:22] the dust of the ground
[51:24] and he breathed the breath of life
[51:28] right
[51:31] so that god god is a spirit
[51:35] anybody can say amen to that god he says
[51:37] create it
[51:40] but god has also got a man form
[51:45] amen god is a spirit
[51:48] but he's also got a man form
[51:51] you say why do you say that now in the
[51:55] book of ezekiel
[51:57] ezekiel 1 26 and 28
[52:00] when ezekiel was seen you know the four
[52:02] beasts like creatures
[52:04] that were in the prince of god and he
[52:07] was describing these four creatures
[52:09] are they aware and the bible tells us
[52:11] here now
[52:12] it came a time when they stood they
[52:15] always had their wings up but they stood
[52:16] the wings were down
[52:18] and when the small creatures were still
[52:20] then the battle tells us here
[52:23] while these four creatures were standing
[52:25] stroke ezekiel 126.
[52:28] i begin up there and above the firmament
[52:31] over the
[52:32] heads the the beast right was the
[52:34] likeness of a throne
[52:37] in likeness like unto sapphire stone
[52:40] and the likeness of the throne was a
[52:44] likeness
[52:45] with the appearance of a man i
[52:48] above it now ezekiel is looking into
[52:52] heaven
[52:54] at the throne of god
[52:59] now what he says if he sees that
[53:04] the appearance of a man
[53:10] ezekiel is looking right there in the
[53:12] friends of god
[53:13] where this beast and all these creatures
[53:15] are he sees the appearance of a man
[53:20] [Music]
[53:22] right now when moses wanted to see god
[53:30] god moses saw that burning bush
[53:34] and it was not burnt and he turned aside
[53:37] and then he heard the boy speaking it
[53:40] was god speaking to him
[53:45] i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[53:49] right so abraham uh moses was hearing
[53:52] the voice
[53:53] but he decided to see god amen
[53:57] i'm hearing this voice and i'm speaking
[54:00] and it's reply
[54:02] but now i want to see i want to see you
[54:04] lord he said god i want to see you
[54:07] [Music]
[54:08] and then it is exodus 33 19
[54:13] look what moses sees you want to see god
[54:18] exodus 33 19-23 and he said
[54:22] i will make my goodness fast before you
[54:26] and will proclaim before you my name
[54:29] the lord and i will be
[54:33] gracious to whom i will be gracious
[54:36] and will show mercy or whom i will show
[54:39] mercy
[54:40] that you can go read back in romans
[54:42] chapter 9
[54:44] god can do what he wants amen
[54:47] he can show his mercy and grace on
[54:49] whomsoever he will
[54:52] that's why we ought to be so thankful to
[54:54] god
[54:55] that he chose us amen
[54:59] many other people have not chosen amen
[55:03] oh we have to thank god for that
[55:06] that many other people are to see the
[55:08] things that we see
[55:11] many other people ought to believe the
[55:12] things that we believe
[55:16] but we are seeing things that they can't
[55:18] see
[55:21] we have seen the supernatural of god
[55:24] amen
[55:25] coming in our day
[55:28] and it's timely revealed to us that this
[55:31] is god again with us
[55:32] amen a lot of people are not privileged
[55:36] to see that
[55:38] so you don't blame them one day when
[55:40] they question
[55:42] and they uh you know and they say things
[55:45] because they don't understand it
[55:49] well god has revealed it to us
[55:53] so we thank god for that
[55:56] so it says that in romans 9 who can say
[56:00] to the
[56:00] vessel why you made me what you made me
[56:05] god will do what you want amen
[56:09] so we thank god he made us you know
[56:11] we're not talking about the flesh
[56:13] we talk about the spirit amen what he
[56:16] made us
[56:18] because everybody walking around is a
[56:20] spirit also
[56:22] everywhere you walk into the plaza as
[56:24] you walk everywhere
[56:26] those are spirits
[56:29] see god is a spirit and uh
[56:32] we know the bible says the holy spirit
[56:34] might be believing in us
[56:35] and if people don't want to understand
[56:37] and believe that how come
[56:39] evil spirits dwell in people
[56:43] how come a person can be possessed with
[56:45] an evil spirit
[56:48] and those evil spirits can uh you know
[56:51] manifest themselves
[56:54] the very same way god's spirit dwells in
[56:56] us
[56:59] see evil spirits are dwelling in people
[57:01] so people are walking in the shopping
[57:02] malls and all
[57:03] all type of spirits
[57:06] but we thank god what he made us amen
[57:09] not that we are any special or you know
[57:11] something better for us i mean
[57:13] some of us are worst off
[57:16] and god i say people that you know we
[57:20] we may not have a good uh uh you know
[57:24] attitude of fine manners
[57:28] and refined ways
[57:32] but god made a way for us amen he saved
[57:35] us
[57:37] amen not be glad for that amen
[57:42] so god knew exactly
[57:45] what he was doing when he made us
[57:49] he knows how god knows how poor we must
[57:52] be
[57:55] i mean if you made us all very rich we
[57:57] won't be here
[57:59] honestly
[58:03] if you made us a multi-billions in our
[58:06] way
[58:07] you'll be in the world there not serving
[58:10] god
[58:12] so god knew exactly and yet god blesses
[58:15] people
[58:16] to have wealth like abraham was a very
[58:18] wealthy man
[58:19] job was very wealthy and they served god
[58:23] amen so god knew exactly what
[58:28] he gives us exactly what we need not
[58:30] what we want
[58:33] put us in our exact place
[58:37] and he blesses us amen
[58:41] so what he says there now i will be
[58:45] gracious to whom
[58:46] i will be gracious and will show mercy
[58:49] unto whom i will show mercy but he said
[58:53] you cannot see my face for man
[58:56] shall not see me and drive
[58:59] and the lord said there is a place
[59:02] by me where you should stand on the rock
[59:06] and while my glory passes by
[59:09] i will put you in the cleft of the rock
[59:12] i will cover you
[59:13] with my hand until i pass by
[59:18] then i will take away my hand and you
[59:20] shall see my back
[59:22] but my face you shall not see
[59:27] so when god god passed by moses saw the
[59:30] back parts of a man
[59:34] amen so god has got a body also
[59:38] moses saw the back parts of a man
[59:42] and he said no man shall see me and look
[59:45] but when he came as jesus christ we can
[59:48] see him
[59:49] amen amen
[59:52] we can look at him and not live not die
[59:58] i am the bread of life if any man
[1:00:01] believe in me
[1:00:02] he shall never die i will raise him up
[1:00:06] at the last day
[1:00:08] so in jesus christ we can see god amen
[1:00:11] so that's why the world in that day
[1:00:14] stumbled so much
[1:00:18] that he was so much man and he was so
[1:00:19] much gone
[1:00:21] francis the bible tells us the fullness
[1:00:25] of the goddess
[1:00:27] what is that father-son holy spirit the
[1:00:30] fullness of the godhead
[1:00:32] dwelt in the body
[1:00:36] can you make it more plain now so jesus
[1:00:39] was god walking amongst them
[1:00:43] those crimes and pharisees now he
[1:00:45] couldn't go and tell them
[1:00:46] i'm god i'm god i'm god i'm god no
[1:00:49] he walked amongst them he was promised
[1:00:52] to come to do the work of redemption see
[1:00:56] before it became dead in the flesh man
[1:01:00] he was the logos
[1:01:04] local spirits came out of god amen
[1:01:07] a part that came out of god the logos
[1:01:10] was made flesh
[1:01:12] which is the word so jesus was flesh man
[1:01:16] but he was word also
[1:01:19] amen in the beginning was the word the
[1:01:21] word wasn't god the word was god and the
[1:01:24] word became flesh
[1:01:27] so we are flesh but we are not word but
[1:01:30] we are coming to that place
[1:01:33] to be word
[1:01:36] see are we going to go back now he
[1:01:39] became
[1:01:39] us that we will become him amen
[1:01:43] there's an invisible union taking place
[1:01:47] amen amen
[1:01:51] so we are going to become word it
[1:01:53] started now amen
[1:01:55] now everything about jesus is just word
[1:01:57] word word word word
[1:02:01] so that's why people are going to miss
[1:02:02] out they are not going to be
[1:02:04] connected with him being the word amen
[1:02:08] and we're gonna be word
[1:02:11] in the flesh we go back to being word
[1:02:15] he was word became flesh amen
[1:02:18] why that it might do the work of
[1:02:20] redemption amen
[1:02:22] so it was a logos coming down
[1:02:25] and not really not you from the message
[1:02:29] the deity of jesus christ so listen
[1:02:32] carefully now
[1:02:34] an eternal what is a logos
[1:02:38] that came out of god what is the logos
[1:02:40] now he says
[1:02:41] this is a description of the logos
[1:02:45] an eternal an unchanging truth
[1:02:49] present from the time of creation
[1:02:52] available to every individual who seeks
[1:02:54] it
[1:02:56] so the logos is that that came out of
[1:02:58] god
[1:03:00] amen and he says
[1:03:05] available to every individual who seeks
[1:03:08] it
[1:03:10] we can be part of him
[1:03:14] i mean who is the bride now
[1:03:18] the pride is part of him he is the world
[1:03:22] so you are part of him amen if he is
[1:03:25] worth we are worth
[1:03:28] praise the lord but the prophet talking
[1:03:31] about abraham
[1:03:32] he says god couldn't take sarah because
[1:03:34] she was part of him amen
[1:03:36] now god can't take us we are part of him
[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:39] amen we're going to be part of him the
[1:03:41] word amen
[1:03:43] so we thank god for that right
[1:03:46] i said that someone was speaking the
[1:03:48] other day and he said
[1:03:50] god what was he
[1:03:53] when he was back yonder billions and
[1:03:55] billions years ago
[1:03:57] when it was just like the space here
[1:04:01] and then it gathered up into the logos
[1:04:05] and then it came from the logos down
[1:04:08] into christ
[1:04:12] the lord is christ god
[1:04:16] the lord was carried from from god
[1:04:19] and into christ from the form of the
[1:04:22] logos
[1:04:23] came into the form of christ amen
[1:04:28] see is just god coming down like this
[1:04:32] to the earth then going right back again
[1:04:35] to god again
[1:04:36] amen don't you see what i mean just
[1:04:40] revolving
[1:04:41] coming into the logos from logos
[1:04:45] into the man that returning back again
[1:04:49] for one purpose to redeem
[1:04:52] that man they have to follow them
[1:04:55] well branson how much of time he took
[1:04:58] for us amen
[1:04:59] amen that's what we must appreciate amen
[1:05:03] he became from god to the romans
[1:05:07] right a blood of fire came out of god
[1:05:11] into christ to do the work of redemption
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] amen to take on the form of a man amen
[1:05:19] he had to become what kingsman redeemer
[1:05:23] he had to be king's faults with us
[1:05:27] amen he became relationships
[1:05:31] amen like naomi somebody had to do the
[1:05:35] work of redemption
[1:05:37] amen and who does that christ
[1:05:41] did the work of redemption amen took the
[1:05:44] gentile bride
[1:05:45] amen thank you amen and connected to the
[1:05:49] jewish church
[1:05:50] the army praise the lord so what we are
[1:05:53] then
[1:05:54] god made away for us the logo is coming
[1:05:56] down so people doesn't understand
[1:05:58] who this jesus is and they all said you
[1:06:01] being a man you're making yourself work
[1:06:03] and all these things that took up stones
[1:06:04] to destroy him amen
[1:06:07] they never understood and they never
[1:06:10] accepted
[1:06:11] as as as they anointed on the messiah
[1:06:13] they rejected him
[1:06:17] and up to today people's hearts are
[1:06:21] being open to who
[1:06:22] the messiah is there's thousands and
[1:06:25] thousands of
[1:06:26] jews in israel and other parts of the
[1:06:29] world
[1:06:30] that now see that jesus is a messiah
[1:06:33] the gospel is preached to them isaiah 53
[1:06:36] is one of the key
[1:06:37] chapters here and there in the book of
[1:06:39] isaiah they're telling the people they
[1:06:41] ask them first
[1:06:42] please read yeah isaiah 53 and tell me
[1:06:45] who it's talking off
[1:06:48] describes jesus christ perfectly coming
[1:06:51] to die
[1:06:52] and give his life then they realize you
[1:06:55] know what we see it
[1:06:57] that was the messiah amen
[1:07:01] so thousands of people are coming
[1:07:04] and becoming christian jews
[1:07:07] but believe that jesus was the messiah
[1:07:10] and the others are still hard and the
[1:07:12] word accepted no no no
[1:07:14] if he was a messiah he's supposed to be
[1:07:16] a adult from here
[1:07:17] he's supposed to be destroyed you know
[1:07:19] he's supposed to
[1:07:20] do it with the romans and there's no
[1:07:22] peace here amongst us
[1:07:25] but jesus said my kingdom is not of this
[1:07:27] world
[1:07:31] if it was of this world my subjects will
[1:07:33] fight for it amen
[1:07:35] but he never come for a kingdom yeah
[1:07:40] john the baptist came prepared for the
[1:07:43] kingdom of god is at heaven
[1:07:47] see so they reject not jesus messiah
[1:07:50] i mean the romans here they ruling and
[1:07:52] controlling us and everything else and
[1:07:54] so but hundreds of them thousands of
[1:07:56] them
[1:07:57] are now seeing who jesus was amen
[1:08:00] and even in the muslim world in iran
[1:08:04] right now thousands of uh iranian
[1:08:06] iranian muslims are becoming christians
[1:08:11] see so what it says here
[1:08:14] for one purpose to redeem the man then
[1:08:17] the troll
[1:08:18] now that's what he came for to be a
[1:08:20] redeemer
[1:08:22] and god before he could be a redeemer
[1:08:25] he had to be according to the law a
[1:08:28] kinsmen redeemer
[1:08:30] he had to be kings folks to us
[1:08:36] in relation a kingman redeemer
[1:08:39] can't just be any foreigner
[1:08:43] must have some relationship with the one
[1:08:46] he's going to redeem
[1:08:48] and the bible tells us we were created
[1:08:50] in the image of god amen
[1:08:52] amen then because of disobedience in the
[1:08:56] garden of heaven
[1:08:57] we falter
[1:09:00] and the only way he can bring us back
[1:09:02] himself
[1:09:04] god was in christ reconciling
[1:09:08] aspect to himself thank you lord amen
[1:09:10] praise the lord i'd be glad for that
[1:09:12] amen so we can see now who we are the
[1:09:14] spirit
[1:09:16] god never redeemed the flesh now you
[1:09:17] amen amen
[1:09:19] the spirit this flesh is going to die
[1:09:23] this flesh is going to go to the dust
[1:09:26] it's going to go to every element there
[1:09:28] it's in the face of the earth
[1:09:31] we know we are made what prophet said 16
[1:09:33] elements
[1:09:36] and all that's going to go back to the
[1:09:39] ground but the prophet said
[1:09:44] whether we get cremated whether you are
[1:09:47] fed behind
[1:09:49] whether you are uh drowning the sea
[1:09:52] in that time when we're going to be
[1:09:54] resurrected
[1:09:55] we will come forth amen so if anybody
[1:09:58] got questions about remember
[1:09:59] cremating some people got questions you
[1:10:02] know hey if you burn me up i'll be
[1:10:04] completely finished
[1:10:07] the brother said i'll read the code just
[1:10:09] now
[1:10:10] even if you are cremated
[1:10:13] if they don't cremate you you're still
[1:10:15] going to go there
[1:10:17] if the fires don't get you their insect
[1:10:20] is going to get you there
[1:10:22] ants skin worms
[1:10:27] can you eat this bunny up that's why
[1:10:31] if they don't freeze your quickly now
[1:10:35] within four days your body is start
[1:10:37] rocking
[1:10:39] and they say now they find bodies you
[1:10:42] know maybe somebody got killed or
[1:10:43] something
[1:10:44] when they come to that body it stinks
[1:10:46] amen
[1:10:48] terrible stink
[1:10:51] see so that is what this body is yes
[1:10:55] this body gonna rot it's gonna go to the
[1:10:56] ground if it's not buried it's going to
[1:10:58] stink
[1:11:03] but he came to redeem the spirit amen
[1:11:07] that was part of him amen
[1:11:10] and that's why we are kids folks
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:13] relationship with him praise the lord
[1:11:16] that's what we are
[1:11:16] excited about not just being an
[1:11:20] organization or going to a church
[1:11:22] and thinking now you know when you're
[1:11:23] saved no redemption he came to redeem us
[1:11:28] praise the lord
[1:11:32] okay
[1:11:36] ah he goes on and god in the beginning
[1:11:38] made his first man
[1:11:40] he made him out of spirit and spirit
[1:11:44] is the invisible part of man
[1:11:48] that you don't see like a corporate
[1:11:50] caleb jenna
[1:11:51] the invisible part of man amen that we
[1:11:54] don't see
[1:11:56] so just remember this every time you
[1:11:58] talk to a person
[1:11:59] you are talking to the spirit
[1:12:03] if your husband and wife are talking at
[1:12:05] home you are talking to the spirit
[1:12:09] when you talk to your children you're
[1:12:11] talking to the spirit
[1:12:16] just dwelling in the body amen
[1:12:19] and if something happens to his body and
[1:12:21] instantly if he dies in an accident or
[1:12:23] something let's put it leaves
[1:12:26] i'd like you to go check out that astral
[1:12:28] projection
[1:12:29] and see not only christians

[1:12:52] came under the body and flew over the
[1:12:53] neighborhood
[1:12:56] and he came back into the body slipped
[1:12:57] in
[1:12:59] now that's what happened to our prophet
[1:13:02] when he went beyond the captain of time
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:05] his spirit left his body
[1:13:09] and caring and when he went
[1:13:13] beyond they recognized him amen
[1:13:16] our precious brother
[1:13:20] but his body was lying there on the bed
[1:13:23] but he said our precious brother if he
[1:13:26] had not come he wouldn't have been yet
[1:13:29] he recognized him
[1:13:31] amen and the angel told him
[1:13:34] he asked why are you because he was a
[1:13:36] leader on earth
[1:13:37] amen and these are all your people
[1:13:40] and people you mean these are all

[1:14:31] of god amen
[1:14:33] amen we know we're not going to be here
[1:14:35] forever anyway amen
[1:14:37] we're going to step into the new body
[1:14:40] amen we're going to step into the theory
[1:14:44] amen praise the lord i'll be glad for
[1:14:46] that
[1:14:47] so stop worrying now about all these
[1:14:49] things
[1:14:50] what's going to happen what's not going
[1:14:52] to happen things going to happen quickly
[1:14:56] then we can go quicker amen
[1:14:59] i tell you brother and sister if you can
[1:15:01] look at this and all god's plan and
[1:15:03] everything
[1:15:04] i'll tell you what we don't have to be
[1:15:07] flustered here
[1:15:10] we don't have to worry about you know
[1:15:12] what am i living for
[1:15:14] and having all this problem now god put
[1:15:16] us in the flesh shall be tried and
[1:15:18] tested
[1:15:19] amen every son of god must be tried
[1:15:24] every son of god must be tested
[1:15:28] god i don't know he takes pleasure in
[1:15:30] that
[1:15:34] he likes it to test us
[1:15:38] to put us into a fix to put us into a
[1:15:42] situation
[1:15:44] amen god intended it like that
[1:15:50] and after we had tried and tested to see
[1:15:52] what we are made of
[1:15:56] all this goodness and mercy
[1:15:59] see now a lot of people when they come
[1:16:01] under this testing and trial
[1:16:03] and they're going through you know some
[1:16:05] problem and
[1:16:06] don't know what's happening and god not
[1:16:08] undertaking for them maybe their
[1:16:09] children out of hand
[1:16:10] the children not serving god the
[1:16:12] children are taking drugs they're
[1:16:14] mixed up in the world they want to know
[1:16:15] what's happening i don't believe in god
[1:16:18] amen i can't serve this god
[1:16:22] look what's happening to me but there's
[1:16:25] others that hold on
[1:16:27] they know they're going through a test
[1:16:29] they never going through a trial
[1:16:32] and and god has given us in the word to
[1:16:35] show us
[1:16:36] job was tested amen job was right
[1:16:40] and he came forth victorious
[1:16:43] wasn't god putting him to a trial
[1:16:48] tested him so much brought him to the
[1:16:50] gutters
[1:16:52] took away his wealth took away his
[1:16:54] family
[1:16:57] that he was the most respected place man
[1:16:59] in the place they all now
[1:17:01] walked away from him and then turned
[1:17:03] away what do we for
[1:17:06] he didn't want to know job
[1:17:09] you see what the testing did
[1:17:12] but he held on
[1:17:16] he had faith in god amen
[1:17:20] then he believed that's why i said
[1:17:23] even if the skin worms destroy this body
[1:17:27] yet i will see god again
[1:17:30] francis we've got to be tried and tested
[1:17:34] see the bible tells us that
[1:17:37] he says no parents will have children
[1:17:41] they won't discipline them correct them
[1:17:46] warn them amen that's what god is
[1:17:49] amen testing us warning us
[1:17:53] and putting us to this place
[1:17:56] okay so he made man out of spirit and
[1:17:59] spirit is the invisible part of man
[1:18:01] that you don't see and god made man in
[1:18:03] his own image
[1:18:04] are you listening to me are you
[1:18:06] listening to me
[1:18:10] he's asking the communication right all
[1:18:12] right
[1:18:13] god made man in his own image amen and
[1:18:16] god is the spirit
[1:18:18] said the bible and the first man
[1:18:22] that was made at the government over all
[1:18:25] creation amen just like the holy spirit
[1:18:28] has government over the church today
[1:18:31] he left the creation he led the animals
[1:18:36] but there was no man to tone the soil so
[1:18:40] god made man out of the dust of the
[1:18:41] earth
[1:18:43] and that man he might have given him a
[1:18:46] hand like a
[1:18:47] monkey he might have given him feet like
[1:18:49] a bird
[1:18:50] whatever he did he just thrown it
[1:18:53] together and made a man
[1:18:55] amen but this man he put
[1:18:58] this immortal spirit that never dies
[1:19:04] into this man and he become more than
[1:19:08] a brute he become a man
[1:19:11] amen now they talk about the serpent
[1:19:15] there
[1:19:15] the serpent was the highest form of all
[1:19:17] the beast amen
[1:19:20] the serpent was intelligent the serpent
[1:19:22] can talk
[1:19:25] and god created him for a purpose
[1:19:28] see that he'll be active
[1:19:33] in fulfilling god's plan amen just like
[1:19:36] judas
[1:19:37] was active in fulfilling god's plan
[1:19:41] because as the serpent never did what he
[1:19:43] did he wouldn't have become a kinsmen
[1:19:45] redeemer
[1:19:47] amen there will be no fall
[1:19:52] amen so god plant it like that
[1:19:56] when god put them in the flesh body he
[1:19:58] knew that
[1:19:59] he was gonna fall he knew it
[1:20:03] because he is god amen but
[1:20:06] wait for him to bruise the head of the
[1:20:08] serpent amen
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:14] this man did that's what i think
[1:20:17] that atheists and some of them standing
[1:20:20] around arguing
[1:20:21] but the hour has come when god sheds
[1:20:24] what is light
[1:20:27] there is an hour there that when
[1:20:30] god is doing things that's right
[1:20:34] so when they argue well
[1:20:37] he sweet looks like a bear and his hands
[1:20:39] look like a head
[1:20:40] a monkey and so forth and they try to
[1:20:43] say
[1:20:45] try to say his original origin come to
[1:20:48] them
[1:20:49] that has nothing to do with it this is a
[1:20:53] body of flesh
[1:20:55] that he's just living in like a house
[1:20:59] it's going back to the dust of the earth
[1:21:02] but the spirit is immortal it comes from
[1:21:06] god
[1:21:07] that's the image of god amen god is a
[1:21:10] spirit amen
[1:21:12] that man lost his origin in the garden
[1:21:14] of eden
[1:21:16] his relationship communion with god was
[1:21:19] cut up there
[1:21:20] because of sin and unbelief see unbelief
[1:21:23] in what the word of god
[1:21:25] amen praise the lord now that is what
[1:21:27] christianity about
[1:21:28] it's not just one religion it's all to
[1:21:32] do
[1:21:32] with the original plan of god
[1:21:35] it's not to say we gotta belong to an
[1:21:37] organization
[1:21:38] or some system and we're gonna get our
[1:21:41] life
[1:21:42] no it all goes back to the garden of
[1:21:45] eden
[1:21:47] amen praise the lord
[1:21:51] so god became a man from spirit to man
[1:21:55] we from man to spirit
[1:21:59] one day we're gonna have a body
[1:22:02] and finally when we go to eternity amen
[1:22:06] you know we're gonna be like the angels
[1:22:08] amen are the angels do you think angels
[1:22:11] got blood in the body
[1:22:14] do you think angel got organs like us
[1:22:19] huh no we're gonna be like the angels am
[1:22:23] i
[1:22:25] amen we're not going to have organs
[1:22:26] that's going to fail
[1:22:28] we're not going to have a heart attack i
[1:22:31] mean i've never heard anywhere where the
[1:22:32] angel
[1:22:33] architect can fell down yet
[1:22:41] they've got no problem they're there for
[1:22:44] eternity
[1:22:45] and they were created before us amen
[1:22:49] they're still living and looking the
[1:22:50] same today
[1:22:52] gabriel came to mary fianna
[1:22:56] upset from the presence of almighty god
[1:22:59] to tell you the holy ghost is going to
[1:23:02] overshadow you
[1:23:03] and you're going to have a baby
[1:23:07] and you must call his name jesus
[1:23:10] be savior he will save the people from
[1:23:14] the sins
[1:23:15] amen see it all goes down to the fall
[1:23:19] the gabriel came to
[1:23:23] john's father zacharias
[1:23:27] they were holding no children
[1:23:30] came there while he was doing the office
[1:23:32] of priesthood in the temple
[1:23:36] and told him you know what you're gonna
[1:23:37] have a son
[1:23:40] you must call his name john amen
[1:23:43] god was preparing special people to come
[1:23:46] on the earth
[1:23:49] and that angel gabriel looked to say
[1:23:51] when he was created millions and
[1:23:52] millions of years ago
[1:23:54] amen and
[1:23:57] gabriel will come and announce his
[1:23:58] coming again the prophet said
[1:24:00] i don't know how it's going to happen
[1:24:03] but gabriel going to announce his coming
[1:24:05] amen so be prepared for the supernatural
[1:24:10] amen if he came to murray
[1:24:14] don't be type don't marry or we type
[1:24:16] mary mary types us
[1:24:19] be it unto me according to thy word amen
[1:24:23] so don't come and ask me how enough
[1:24:24] because the prophet said
[1:24:26] gabriel announced his first coming april
[1:24:29] runs his second coming
[1:24:32] i don't know what's going to happen but
[1:24:34] it's going to happen
[1:24:36] praise the lord okay time is going let's
[1:24:39] just
[1:24:39] look at the scripture here now that god
[1:24:42] came from
[1:24:44] from logos the spirit
[1:24:47] coming into a word body that
[1:24:51] jesus was the word amen
[1:24:54] i said we bypass our three of neutralia
[1:24:58] jesus never bypassed he was word and
[1:25:00] flesh amen
[1:25:02] that's why everybody got confused they
[1:25:05] never saw a man like this before
[1:25:09] and if you looked at uh you know you've
[1:25:10] got some movies today
[1:25:12] many movies are made about jesus there i
[1:25:14] mean he's just one of the men taking the
[1:25:16] character of jesus
[1:25:18] and you know we look at it you know what
[1:25:20] he looked like everybody else and
[1:25:22] what really attracted the people to him
[1:25:25] there was something in him
[1:25:27] that attracted him the bible says
[1:25:31] when he called nephew come and follow me
[1:25:35] nephew went straight away
[1:25:39] all the other disciples peter and they
[1:25:42] were fishing his brother
[1:25:43] andrew they were fishing come and follow
[1:25:46] me
[1:25:51] your name is simon
[1:25:56] the son of jonah
[1:26:02] you never said you know what nobody ever
[1:26:04] even told me that before
[1:26:07] so there was something different about
[1:26:09] here although he was a man
[1:26:12] and all the rest of the people jesus had
[1:26:15] many sisters
[1:26:17] following him
[1:26:21] faithful sisters
[1:26:24] mary there was about two or three marys
[1:26:29] amen many of them salome
[1:26:35] and one he cast seven demons out of them
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:38] mary magdalene they were there
[1:26:43] something attracted them but the others
[1:26:45] never got affected
[1:26:48] see there was something special about
[1:26:49] jesus
[1:26:53] and yet the other people couldn't see
[1:26:54] that the priest had said ah you know
[1:26:57] what
[1:26:58] through this guy you're coming to stay
[1:27:00] up the people and
[1:27:01] start another religion and all smack him
[1:27:03] on the face
[1:27:07] but when they come to the judgment all
[1:27:08] this is going to play back
[1:27:12] those soldiers there crucifying him
[1:27:17] and after the spirit left him the
[1:27:20] thunders rode
[1:27:21] the earthquakes the rocks fell off the
[1:27:23] mountains
[1:27:25] it got dark and their soldier came and
[1:27:28] stood by the cross
[1:27:30] truly this was the son of god
[1:27:34] see so he came god came as a son
[1:27:38] amen praise the lord
[1:27:42] that's why talk you like you know i'm
[1:27:45] going back from where i came
[1:27:48] yet the flesh was born here
[1:27:52] okay let's read the hebrews here quickly
[1:27:56] the book of hebrews
[1:28:02] hebrews chapter one let us follow the
[1:28:05] scripture a little bit
[1:28:06] and then you see who jesus won and how
[1:28:08] he came to make a way for us
[1:28:10] it's god coming as a man
[1:28:14] praise the lord now the bible tells us
[1:28:16] hebrews chapter 1
[1:28:18] god who had saturday times and diamonds
[1:28:20] matters
[1:28:21] spoke in times past unto the fathers by
[1:28:24] the prophets
[1:28:26] and in his last days spoken unto us by
[1:28:29] his son
[1:28:31] whom he had appointed here of all things
[1:28:37] for whom also he made the walls
[1:28:43] who being in the brightness of his glory
[1:28:48] and the express image of his person
[1:28:53] look what the bible is saying about
[1:28:54] jesus
[1:28:57] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:29:03] and the expressed image of his person
[1:29:07] and upholding all things by the word of
[1:29:10] his power
[1:29:11] where he had by himself first our sins
[1:29:15] sat down on the right hand of the
[1:29:16] majesty and i
[1:29:18] being made so much better than angels
[1:29:22] as he had my inheritance obtained a more
[1:29:25] excellent name than they
[1:29:29] for unto which of the angel said he at
[1:29:32] any time
[1:29:33] thou art my son this day
[1:29:36] i have begotten thee and again
[1:29:39] i will be to email father and he shall
[1:29:43] be to be a son
[1:29:46] but let's look at this relationship
[1:29:47] further
[1:29:49] verse six and again when he bring it
[1:29:53] in death begotten into the world the
[1:29:55] first begotten of the world
[1:29:57] he said let all the angels of god
[1:30:01] worship him
[1:30:02] amen who's that muslim worship jesus now
[1:30:07] tune his people huh
[1:30:12] generous witness let all the angels
[1:30:15] worship in
[1:30:16] amen god yet god said
[1:30:20] i will not share my glory with anyone
[1:30:22] amen
[1:30:24] but i said let all the angels worship
[1:30:26] him
[1:30:27] and jesus when he stood on the earth he
[1:30:29] said if you believe in god
[1:30:30] believe also in me
[1:30:34] know what a big statement that is
[1:30:37] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:30:42] that's why people are blinded
[1:30:45] this friend is body and three days i
[1:30:47] will raise her up again
[1:30:49] and the bible says god raised his body
[1:30:51] up
[1:30:53] matthew's twenty four jesus said that
[1:30:56] destroy this temple and in three days i
[1:30:58] will raise it up
[1:31:01] amen i will raise you up at the last day
[1:31:06] i am the resurrection and the life
[1:31:10] amen see i am the way
[1:31:13] the truth and the life amen
[1:31:17] so there is no other faith otherwise you
[1:31:19] know nothing
[1:31:22] i am the way i am the truth i am the
[1:31:25] life
[1:31:27] if any man come to me i will not cast
[1:31:30] out
[1:31:33] i will raise him up in the last days
[1:31:34] amen praise the lord
[1:31:37] okay so now let all the angels worship
[1:31:39] him
[1:31:41] and of the angels he said who make it
[1:31:43] his angel spirit
[1:31:45] and his minister is a flame of fire
[1:31:48] but unto the sun he's saying look what
[1:31:51] onto the sun is saying you're hearing
[1:31:56] follow me but under the sun he said
[1:31:59] thy throne oh god
[1:32:03] is forever in heaven a scepter of
[1:32:06] righteousness
[1:32:08] is the scepter of thy kingdom amen
[1:32:12] thomas love righteousness and
[1:32:15] idioliquity
[1:32:16] therefore god even die god and anointed
[1:32:20] thee
[1:32:20] with the oil of gladness above thy
[1:32:22] fellows
[1:32:23] amen him as a man and also referring him
[1:32:27] to be
[1:32:28] heir of all things
[1:32:32] question and now lord in the beginning
[1:32:35] and laid the foundations of the earth
[1:32:38] and the heavens
[1:32:39] are the work of their hands they shall
[1:32:41] perish
[1:32:42] but our remains remain and they all
[1:32:45] shall wax old
[1:32:46] as got a garment as a wester
[1:32:50] not that it's a piece of clothing shall
[1:32:53] fold up
[1:32:55] pull them up and they shall be changed
[1:32:57] but thou
[1:32:58] art the same and thy years
[1:33:01] shall not fail amen
[1:33:05] talking about jesus christ
[1:33:08] but to which of the angels said me at
[1:33:10] any time
[1:33:12] sit on my right hand until i make
[1:33:15] thy enemies thy footstool
[1:33:19] are they not all ministering spirits and
[1:33:21] form to minister
[1:33:23] for them we shall be heard of salvation
[1:33:27] praise the lord so from from
[1:33:30] spirit god to logos
[1:33:33] the word to man
[1:33:37] he became man from spirit
[1:33:42] we from flesh go back to the spirit
[1:33:46] that's already in us now
[1:33:49] god is not going to change the spirit
[1:33:51] the prophet said
[1:33:52] we take the same character we are with
[1:33:54] us
[1:33:56] the spirit is the nature of the soul
[1:34:00] the prophet said that isn't it the
[1:34:02] spirit
[1:34:03] is the nature of the soul
[1:34:07] so if you talk to a person another
[1:34:09] friend mention
[1:34:10] you talk to a person for a few minutes
[1:34:12] you can see what type of a person they
[1:34:14] are
[1:34:17] you know what they're from spirit
[1:34:20] some people you don't even have to talk
[1:34:22] to them maybe just look to them look at
[1:34:24] them or maybe pass it by
[1:34:26] you can see what type of person they are
[1:34:28] amen
[1:34:30] you know i mean the look is on the face
[1:34:34] like that
[1:34:35] you can tell the type of people there
[1:34:39] see because of the spirit in them
[1:34:42] praise god so we can
[1:34:46] you know there's so much here to go now
[1:34:50] see so what we do we go back to our word
[1:34:52] bodies
[1:34:54] amen we'll have all the same
[1:34:58] uh you know what we have now we can see
[1:35:01] we can hear we can talk we can do
[1:35:03] everything in that word body
[1:35:06] ebay came us so we can become in
[1:35:10] we are tested and tried here all for
[1:35:12] god's glory amen
[1:35:17] see we are not tested for our glory
[1:35:20] how many of us want to be testable no
[1:35:23] we we don't want to go through the
[1:35:25] testing
[1:35:27] it's yeah it's a hard time
[1:35:30] see when god is going to put the test
[1:35:32] upon you sometime and
[1:35:33] and everybody's going to turn against
[1:35:35] you and everything else
[1:35:38] yeah the prophet somebody said bad
[1:35:41] things about the prophet and
[1:35:43] and you know they took off with him and
[1:35:46] picked on him and something
[1:35:47] the brother can say you're staying quiet
[1:35:49] why are you
[1:35:51] you know he said oh brother that was
[1:35:54] predestinated
[1:35:55] before the foundation the lord put to
[1:35:57] put me through a test
[1:36:02] he's not going to go fussy with a hug
[1:36:03] you know
[1:36:05] see sometimes we go through a test the
[1:36:08] church believers will go through a test
[1:36:11] see some people will turn against the
[1:36:14] pastor
[1:36:17] they'll turn against his wife
[1:36:20] the prophecy now they can't finish with
[1:36:22] that apostle then define the fault of
[1:36:24] the dog
[1:36:28] yeah they find your fault and you'll
[1:36:30] wonder you know what they're so good
[1:36:32] people now whatever why they tend
[1:36:34] against you
[1:36:36] that probably said why should i care
[1:36:38] they can trample you they can kick you
[1:36:41] dead men don't respond let them kick you
[1:36:45] a little bit you're dead
[1:36:48] let them trample you let them say all
[1:36:51] men other things
[1:36:54] and you wonder why it happens
[1:36:57] you know people look at the church
[1:37:01] this church other churches they'll turn
[1:37:04] against one another
[1:37:06] why oh the problem said no people come
[1:37:09] under the uh you know pretense of being
[1:37:12] church fellowship there
[1:37:15] that the devil will use the same one to
[1:37:16] talk about
[1:37:18] use the same one to target the pastor
[1:37:21] put you through a test
[1:37:24] now you said now is that true i tell you
[1:37:25] what one time
[1:37:28] david king david his men were there
[1:37:34] and uh i think he's put on david's face
[1:37:37] the king saw his man standing there his
[1:37:41] body god he said shall that man spit on
[1:37:44] my king
[1:37:45] he said let me go and chop his head off
[1:37:49] there he said no no no god told him to
[1:37:52] do that
[1:37:56] god told him to put on david that's what
[1:37:59] david said
[1:38:01] put her into a test show you know what
[1:38:05] this is the stage you come to and god
[1:38:07] said god said was put on him
[1:38:11] was god showing david what he even
[1:38:13] thought of him
[1:38:15] they could have killed it do you know
[1:38:18] that
[1:38:19] in the nations here other countries you

[1:38:33] we're going to chop his head off he's
[1:38:35] putting on the king
[1:38:39] god told him to do that sometimes god is
[1:38:42] going to tell people to
[1:38:43] turn against you
[1:38:46] god is going to tell your wife to turn
[1:38:48] against you
