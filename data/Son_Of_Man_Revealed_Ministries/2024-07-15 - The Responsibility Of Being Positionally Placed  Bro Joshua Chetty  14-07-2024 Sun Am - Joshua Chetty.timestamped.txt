[3:52] amen we know
[3:54] that God has ordained us for the season
[3:57] for this time that we living in
[4:00] uh we could have come out in the first
[4:01] church age we could have been born there
[4:03] we would have been anointed for the age
[4:05] we could whichever age we was born in we
[4:07] would have been anointed for the age but
[4:09] God has anointed us to be Overcomers in
[4:11] this age amen amen in the darkest of all
[4:14] ages amen the prophet had to put light
[4:17] there because why he knew there to be a
[4:20] people that will come forth in this hour
[4:22] amen amen in the hour of gross Darkness
[4:25] light has come our way amen he said
[4:28] Shalom arise and Shine the Light is come
[4:32] amen this light is not for the whole
[4:33] world Amen this light is given unto you
[4:37] amen so you are empowered so you will
[4:40] impact amen with you will shake Grace
[4:42] upon the Earth amen and I believe that
[4:45] we are on a spiritual battle this
[4:47] morning I believe that we are here on
[4:49] the earth we're not here in the
[4:51] Millennium as yet amen we are here in
[4:52] the land of the Holy Ghost and in the
[4:55] land of the Holy Ghost was typing when
[4:57] Joshua had given the inhabitance to the
[4:58] children of Israel they have to go and
[5:01] Conquer territory yes amen they had to
[5:03] go and fight amen they had to go and
[5:06] defeat the enemy to take what rightfully
[5:09] belong to them amen amen and we come as
[5:12] Sons and Daughters of God we are ear to
[5:15] the kingdom amen amen and this Holy
[5:18] Ghost Kingdom that is given unto us we
[5:20] have we have to take on territory amen
[5:22] because why in this hour we are fighting
[5:25] demon
[5:26] powers hell is Unleashed upon the Earth
[5:30] amen you you got to be sensitive to this
[5:32] amen the word has come to sensitize us
[5:36] that Al is been Unleashed on the earth
[5:39] Satan found a way to the fourth
[5:41] dimension he's found a portal to bring
[5:43] the fourth dimension to influence the
[5:46] fourth dimension and bring hell upon the
[5:48] Earth therefore you find 200 million
[5:51] demons in different places amen into
[5:53] your governments into your scientific
[5:55] into your Educational Systems into your
[5:58] everyday life you find you are faced
[6:00] with demon powers so as much as you
[6:03] faced with that God has got his army
[6:06] upon the Earth amen God has got his
[6:09] generals he's got his he's got his
[6:11] special uh special type of uh equipment
[6:15] that he's given us which is his word
[6:17] amen and he's given us all his equipment
[6:20] to equip us to prepare us for every
[6:22] onslaught of the enemy so we can be we
[6:25] can be satisfied like the other people
[6:27] said you know what we are don't those
[6:29] are giants in the land we are like
[6:31] grasshoppers to go and defeat these
[6:33] enemies or we can be like Joshua and
[6:35] Caleb and say this is our land this is
[6:37] our inheritance we are more than able
[6:39] amen amen amen if you got your Bible
[6:43] this morning you turn to the book of
[6:45] Galatians read from chapter
[6:51] 4 amen you happy to be the house of God
[6:54] this morning
[6:56] amen book of Galatians chapter 4
[7:01] now I say that the
[7:03] heir as long as he is a
[7:07] child defer nothing from a servant
[7:12] though he be Lord of
[7:15] all so he is Lord of all right but he
[7:22] defer nothing from a servant as long as
[7:24] he remained a child now we know even in
[7:27] the natural a child cannot remain a
[7:29] child amen a child has to grow yes now
[7:33] for the child to grow you got to give
[7:35] him natural
[7:37] food and to give him natural food and
[7:39] stimulation and he will
[7:42] grow so he cannot remain remain the same
[7:46] amen there has to be a progression in
[7:47] his life but he under chors and
[7:51] governors until the time appointed of
[7:53] the father now the chers and governors
[7:55] in this for us is the Holy Ghost that's
[7:58] our guide
[8:01] amen even so we when we were children
[8:06] were in bondage under the elements of
[8:09] the world so we have the guide that is
[8:11] tutoring us and the guide is working
[8:13] through the five4 ministry amen amen
[8:15] amen so even so we when we were children
[8:20] were in bondage under the elements of
[8:22] the world so when we come new babies in
[8:25] Christ drinking the sincere milk we also
[8:28] were in b AG because while we had this
[8:31] we kept asking ourselves H what is our
[8:34] identification are we eternally saved
[8:37] are we do we have the Assurance of what
[8:39] is like on the other side that's why
[8:41] when we were babes coming into the
[8:43] coming into Christianity amen being
[8:45] first
[8:47] saved and then what happened you was
[8:50] kept in bondage all the time until they
[8:52] come a time there's a progression in
[8:55] your Revelation yes where you know as
[8:57] you were known amen will you now know as
[9:01] you were known oh yes amen and when you
[9:04] have that perfect love casted away all
[9:07] fear amen now you are no longer in
[9:09] bondage amen amen but when the fullness
[9:13] of the time was
[9:16] come God sent forth his son made of a
[9:20] woman made under the law to redeem them
[9:23] that way under the law that we might
[9:25] receive the adoption of sons amen and
[9:29] because he are son God had sent forth
[9:31] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[9:33] crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no
[9:37] more a servant but a son and if a son
[9:40] then an heir of God through Christ amen
[9:43] you may be amen we also turn quickly to
[9:46] the Book of Romans 12 reading from verse
[9:49] 4 and
[9:53] 6
[9:55] for Romans 12: 4 and 6 for we have many
[10:00] members in one body and all members have
[10:03] not the same office so we being many are
[10:08] one body in Christ and everyone members
[10:13] one of another having then gifts
[10:16] deferring according to the grace that is
[10:18] given to us where the prophecy let us
[10:21] prophesy according to the procreation of
[10:24] Faith so just showing that once that
[10:27] scripture there Romans 12: 4-6 there's
[10:31] many we are many members but we are
[10:34] forming one body amen and we all don't
[10:39] have the same office but we all have our
[10:42] inheritance
[10:44] amen and we are here coming under this
[10:47] message to what to be positionally
[10:50] placed amen the Holy Ghost has come like
[10:54] how Joshua types remember in the Old
[10:57] Testament Joshua is positionally placing
[10:59] the children of Israel according to how
[11:02] they were birthed amen amen when the
[11:04] mothers when the Israelite mothers were
[11:06] giving birth to them they gave birth to
[11:10] them and na them according to their
[11:12] inheritance amen and then Joshua comes
[11:15] and he places them according to their
[11:18] births so just like that the Holy Ghost
[11:20] comes and places us according to what
[11:23] our bir because why we were
[11:26] predestinated God already for knew all
[11:28] things and he predestinated according to
[11:31] his purpose each one of us we're
[11:34] predestinated according to God's purpose
[11:37] amen and there comes a time when the
[11:39] Holy Ghost comes and positionally places
[11:43] us
[11:44] amen but this morning we speaking on the
[11:47] responsibility of being positionally
[11:50] placed amen they come the
[11:53] responsibility to be positionally placed
[11:56] amen a lot of us can say we have
[12:00] a lot of us can say we receive this
[12:01] message we receive all the word but they
[12:05] come the
[12:06] responsibility amen and not many people
[12:09] are willing to take on that
[12:11] responsibility amen many want to shy
[12:14] away from that responsibility because in
[12:17] this hour you are not a called to just
[12:18] be a church member yes amen this is not
[12:21] an hour to call you call upon and say I
[12:23] I believe God sent a prophets oh God
[12:26] sent us the pull of fire God sent us the
[12:29] opening of the word this is not the hour
[12:31] for that amen we have received that we
[12:34] have received God sent a prophet God
[12:36] sent a prophet for a
[12:38] purpose he sent a prophet so there can
[12:40] be a people on the Earth that will come
[12:43] to adopted Sons and Daughters of God
[12:46] Amen there will be a people on the Earth
[12:48] that will take on the
[12:50] responsibility of having proper sunship
[12:53] amen they will come of full age they
[12:56] will come to maturity amen because why
[12:58] we have speaking to a Corinthian Church
[13:00] here amen we are speaking to an Ephesian
[13:03] Church yes amen we're not speaking the
[13:06] time of having your air long and and
[13:08] wearing those long dresses those things
[13:10] were to pull you out of Egypt those
[13:12] things were cleaning you out of Egypt
[13:14] this is a time now when you are taken
[13:16] out of unbelief when you are totally
[13:18] separated from all unbelief and now when
[13:21] you are totally separated from all
[13:23] unbelief now you can come in the
[13:25] presence of God and receive from the
[13:28] heavenly manner amen that which was
[13:31] hidden from the from the world that was
[13:33] hidden to everybody else is come to the
[13:36] children amen because why is that me to
[13:38] give the children's bread to others
[13:42] amen so it comes with responsibilities
[13:46] we are called to be faithful stewards of
[13:49] what God has given us amen sometimes
[13:53] this message has become too common to
[13:55] people but we're forgetting there's a
[13:57] sacred trust that church is a female and
[14:01] there's a sacred trust upon her amen
[14:03] she's required to have a certain virtue
[14:05] about her she's required to have a
[14:07] certain character about it amen God has
[14:11] not called us to be sful in this hour
[14:14] God has not called us to be AIT about
[14:16] the things in his kingdom amen because
[14:19] why we are representing the kingdom of
[14:21] God and if you are an ambassador of a
[14:24] country the prophet of God said if you
[14:26] are an ambassador you will go and
[14:28] represent every about your country now
[14:31] if you are ambassador of your country
[14:33] you can't go to a foreign land and
[14:37] represent another
[14:39] country amen you got to represent your
[14:41] very own country so we are an ambassador
[14:44] of the kingdom of God we can't be living
[14:47] here in this foreign land right now in
[14:49] Satan's kingdom and represent the world
[14:52] yes amen amen we can't be representing
[14:55] Satan's kingdom we are representative of
[14:58] the Heavenly Kingdom amen father as it
[15:01] is in heaven so let it be on the earth
[15:03] amen may may they be one even as we are
[15:06] one there must be this Oneness there
[15:09] must be this Union there must be an
[15:10] Harmony between God the father and US
[15:13] amen there must be this on with us amen
[15:17] you must become because remember we
[15:19] bypass the word but we are becoming the
[15:21] word we become so much the word of the
[15:23] word that the people will eventually see
[15:25] Jesus Christ walking again in human
[15:28] flesh
[15:30] amen amen amen the Bible in Luke 48
[15:34] 12:48 says For unto whomsoever much is
[15:37] given much is
[15:40] required now there's never been any
[15:42] other age where much was given there's
[15:45] never been any other age where the
[15:46] fullness of the word has come down where
[15:49] no stone has been untouched amen and he
[15:52] given us all the land to inherit but yet
[15:56] there's much territory to regain to gain
[15:59] amen amen because why
[16:04] between the time between now of
[16:07] receiving spiritual adoption in this
[16:08] hour and between the changing of the
[16:11] body amen there has to be a people that
[16:14] will come and represent Jesus Christ
[16:18] upon the Earth there will be a people
[16:21] that will have signing power they will
[16:23] have there will be a people will say
[16:26] this is my beloved Son this is my
[16:29] beloved daughter
[16:31] yeah because why Revelation 10811 said
[16:35] thou must prophesy again before Nation
[16:38] tongues and Kings now who are those
[16:41] people there must be a people that will
[16:43] prophesy again yes amen that's why he
[16:45] can say this is my beloved Son this is
[16:48] my beloved daughter yeah amen because
[16:52] why she becomes the final voice in the
[16:55] final age who this bride under a
[17:01] messenger
[17:02] amen but he can't just say
[17:06] yeah if there's no you not taking the
[17:10] responsibility if you there's no growths
[17:12] amen if you're going to remain stagnant
[17:14] in your work you still confused about
[17:17] your
[17:18] identification you're still confused
[17:21] whether you are saved you're still
[17:23] concerned about whether you got a place
[17:25] in heaven no these things should be open
[17:28] to you amen
[17:29] there must be a personal revelation of
[17:31] who you truly are that the Gen of God
[17:35] was placed in you
[17:39] amen that you are part of him that you
[17:42] always been a part of him that you are
[17:45] the representative on the earth amen and
[17:48] then you come to know him the
[17:53] way the way he operates amen and how
[17:56] does God operates watch him through the
[17:58] world word watch him through the
[18:00] scriptures he doesn't change his ways
[18:03] amen he's the same yesterday today and
[18:06] forever therefore if the church started
[18:10] at a certain time this in the alpha
[18:12] church amen they were there in the upper
[18:15] room amen the because that was the
[18:19] Jewish church amen that's how it started
[18:20] off but when it moved to the Gentiles
[18:23] God was moving one by one individually
[18:26] and that's how he's moving with us right
[18:28] now amen we are not just gathered in one
[18:31] place and we expecting now the Holy
[18:33] Ghost just to come down in one place God
[18:35] is dealing with individuals amen amen
[18:39] God is dealing with individuals in that
[18:41] way get a man set apart here get a
[18:43] daughter set apart yeah amen God is
[18:46] dealing with you in that way amen and
[18:48] then God said this is my son now the
[18:51] Holy Ghost is shoing him he said right
[18:53] this is the son that's responsible he
[18:55] knows how to handle my word he know
[18:57] what's what I want done with the words
[18:59] yes amen and now I can give him that
[19:02] responsibility now when he speaks the
[19:04] word it must be according to as he
[19:06] spoken amen amen yes that's why he could
[19:09] say his Prophet you spoke it you speak
[19:12] it amen he said I don't go you already
[19:15] spoke it amen wait there till it come to
[19:19] pass amen
[19:23] amen so the prophet emphasized the
[19:26] importance of understanding our position
[19:28] in Christ
[19:29] he thought that adoption is not merely
[19:32] something theological amen like how the
[19:35] how the how the church World sees it but
[19:40] it is a something
[19:42] transformative it's a
[19:44] transformation that's taking
[19:46] place amen you always you remember
[19:50] nothing can change your
[19:53] sunship that's something that's already
[19:56] predestinated the gene of God was in you
[19:59] amen if you got the god gen in you it
[20:01] mean the DNA is within you amen but now
[20:05] to come to
[20:06] adoption it's a transformative
[20:09] process amen there's a process where you
[20:13] as a Son of God are walking in the
[20:16] things of God amen amen when you first
[20:19] come in you'll have all the you come in
[20:21] with all your sin you come in with the S
[20:23] of the world you come in speaking lies
[20:25] you come in smoking your cigarettes you
[20:27] come in still drinking you're coming
[20:29] still using V languages you'll do all
[20:31] the things but there's a transformative
[20:34] process for in this word there's a power
[20:37] of transformation thank you God is able
[20:40] to change the violence that's why you
[20:42] don't write anyone off amen thank you
[20:44] Lord God can take the violent Sinner and
[20:46] transform their lives than that's when
[20:49] the prophet went he lost the the field
[20:51] for the people and he went off the scene
[20:54] God had to show him back amen he said no
[20:57] you lost the feeling for the people
[20:58] people amen then he had to get the
[21:01] feeling for the people again and then go
[21:02] back on the field because why God was
[21:05] still dealing with people the fact that
[21:07] we are here upon the Earth right now it
[21:10] means the grace of God is still upon the
[21:12] Earth amen Grace will leave the Gentile
[21:17] dispensation when his bride leaves the
[21:19] Earth and then moves on to the Jews but
[21:23] between then and now God is dealing
[21:27] positionally placing his sons in the
[21:31] Kingdom amen now each one of us had
[21:34] different purposes to play in his
[21:36] kingdom each one of us there a different
[21:38] parts yes don't be jealous of your
[21:41] brother's
[21:42] Parts cuz God is dealing with people at
[21:45] a different level now if God dealt with
[21:47] your brother and brought him to maturity
[21:49] and he's progressing the things of God
[21:51] don't be jealous about it be be be glad
[21:54] and say God is with my brother look at
[21:57] God in that man that God is that sister
[22:00] amen and then you pray for them and then
[22:03] you'll see your part being fulfilled
[22:05] amen stay within your position oh thank
[22:08] you Lord amen and what God put you in be
[22:10] faithful in it he is a little thing when
[22:13] God say right this brother this sister
[22:16] this son and daughter of mine they've
[22:18] been faithful in this now I can give
[22:19] them something else I can place them to
[22:21] something else now they must go into
[22:23] another Frontier amen they passed this
[22:26] battle they pass this Battle Ground let
[22:28] me let me take them to a bigger
[22:29] Battleground thank you Lord amen let me
[22:31] take them to conquer more territory now
[22:33] thank you Lord amen so it's a
[22:36] transformative process amen it's the
[22:40] power of

[22:46] changing from Mortal to immortality but
[22:49] it's happening From the Inside Out amen
[22:52] there's something taking place on the
[22:53] inside and this transformative thing
[22:56] that is taking place each time we are
[22:58] getting more and more in tunee with it
[23:01] we are getting less Earthbound
[23:03] Hallelujah he taking away the magnet
[23:06] that's keeping us the gravitational
[23:07] level that's keeping us grounded upon
[23:09] the Earth amen why we are seated in
[23:11] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are
[23:14] now soaring into the heavenli amen we
[23:17] are looking at things to
[23:19] spiritualize amen we are looking to at
[23:21] things from above we are not looking at
[23:24] things through Satan's hidden we are not
[23:26] looking at things through the five
[23:27] senses because why we defeated the five
[23:30] senses you bring it under subjection
[23:32] amen as you coming now to a mature Son
[23:35] of God you bring your senses to
[23:37] subjection amen because why you're a
[23:40] faith-based person amen yes
[23:45] amen so we find that as galatian 4:47
[23:48] says when the fullness of time was come
[23:50] God sent for his son made of a woman
[23:52] made under the law to redeem that we
[23:55] under the law that we might receive the
[23:57] adoption of
[23:59] sons and because you are Sons God has
[24:01] sent for the spirit of his son into your
[24:03] hearts crying ABA father wherefore thou
[24:06] no more a servant but a son and if a son
[24:09] then an heir of God through Christ amen

[24:17] of our father's
[24:19] inhabitance amen amen who can take that

[24:26] change let every man's word be a lie but
[24:29] my word be the truth no one shall add to
[24:32] this no one can take us from that so you
[24:35] an A so why are you worried now that's
[24:37] right you can't be walking in this hour
[24:39] living in fear you can't be walking this
[24:42] hour living in
[24:43] anxiety living underneath your
[24:46] privileges Satan wants to keep you that
[24:49] way Satan doesn't want you to know who

[24:55] have a revelation of your true
[24:57] inheritance amen they you an a of all

[25:14] fussing he wants you to be murmuring he
[25:17] wants you to pick on this brother pick
[25:18] on this thing pick on that and brings
[25:20] you all confusion of doctrines taking
[25:24] away from the true word of God taking
[25:26] away from the leadership of the Holy
[25:27] Ghost the true guid in his hour amen
[25:30] who's leading you to the promise amen
[25:32] who's leading you to a land of
[25:33] inheritance am keep your eyes fixed on
[25:37] Jesus amen amen he's the author and the
[25:40] finisher of our
[25:41] [Music]
[25:44] faith so we find that we are actually
[25:48] transitioning right we don't realize
[25:51] that but we are
[25:53] transitioning because every day you find
[25:56] that your your Chase B already changed
[25:58] correct yes you you see I can't be
[26:01] trapped in this pest anymore Lord amen
[26:04] you you see the things around you you

[26:09] everyone is uh in fear everyone is
[26:12] panicking with the economy everyone is
[26:14] panicking with the the walls on the
[26:16] earth everyone's panicking with the
[26:18] political situations and the crisis
[26:21] around the
[26:22] world you know that you are
[26:25] transitioning see for God to set up his
[26:29] kingdom there has to be an end of
[26:31] another kingdom right so you see the
[26:34] ending of this
[26:35] Kingdom right now you find things
[26:38] happening around the world Russia is
[26:40] getting triggered by NATO and so forth
[26:43] all these things are happening why but
[26:46] everyone's wondering why the tension is
[26:48] so high but everybody is wondering why
[26:51] it never lead us yet to World War II
[26:53] that's because when the mighty Angel
[26:56] comes down he suppressing the powers yes

[27:03] because you are on the earth yes amen
[27:05] there's a quick short work for you to do
[27:08] before you leave the
[27:12] Earth amen so we find that this as we
[27:16] come into this process of adoption
[27:18] people don't want to take the
[27:20] responsibility of taking going and
[27:22] studying the word for himself going and
[27:24] spending time surrendering thems to God
[27:27] now if you going to partake of all the
[27:29] garbage of all temporal things how are
[27:31] you going to absorb Eternal things amen
[27:34] where you going to have time for the
[27:35] Eternal things how are you going to grow
[27:38] you I mean a lot of people are
[27:39] interested in in growing the
[27:42] Flesh in progressing in material things
[27:45] in progressing in how they can advance
[27:47] in this life in everything else but how
[27:50] many people are really interested in
[27:52] spiritual maturity in spiritual growth
[27:56] because everything else in this life is
[27:59] yes amen amen all your riches where are
[28:01] all the great Empires where are the
[28:04] great pharaohs where are the great
[28:06] Napoleon and so forth all the great
[28:09] Europe and all his kingdoms yes where
[28:13] are
[28:15] they everything is temporal amen but we
[28:19] have received
[28:20] something Hallelujah that this world
[28:23] knows nothing about amen yes that we can
[28:26] hold to cherish to our hearts because we
[28:28] know these are Eternal things
[28:31] amen but it has
[28:33] substance amen faith is a substance
[28:36] Hallelujah of things hopeful the
[28:38] evidence of Things Not Seen amen and
[28:41] therefore when the doctor come and give

[28:45] substance amen you are giving a medical
[28:48] report I've got substance amen you give
[28:51] me bad kidneys in your report my father
[28:54] says he can take the kidneys out and he
[28:57] can put a new kidney in because whatever
[28:59] I loose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven
[29:01] so I loose that bad kidney and I now I
[29:04] put now you speak a new kidney there
[29:07] amen what is impossible with our
[29:10] father it will be according to Thy word
[29:12] that's right amen even as you speak it
[29:15] will be according to your
[29:16] word amen for as many as are led by the
[29:21] spirit of
[29:22] God now how can you be led by the spirit
[29:26] of God if the there's no room for the
[29:29] holy ghost in your life if you never
[29:32] create an atmosphere for the Holy Ghost
[29:34] to be in your life you made him
[29:36] unwelcome in your life how can you be
[29:38] led by the spirit of God Amen if you
[29:41] want the Holy Ghost to work in your life
[29:43] create an atmosphere yes you know the
[29:45] prophet said he's a gentleman amen the
[29:48] minute you think bad thoughts the minute
[29:49] you do evil things he takes away his
[29:51] flight so you know how to bring him back
[29:53] pray him back let there be an atmosphere
[29:56] in your in your life let the hly Holy
[29:58] Spirit lead you let the holy spirit
[30:00] guide you
[30:03] amen amen can you believe can you
[30:05] imagine a life without the Holy Ghost
[30:07] then you need to think back before you
[30:10] received this word amen what a miserable
[30:13] life that was what a terrible life that
[30:16] was how your life was just you you it
[30:20] was you can't explain there was an
[30:22] emptiness there wasn't vacuum in your
[30:24] life but when you receive the Holy Ghost
[30:27] amen and you know Satan is so clever
[30:29] thank you Lord Satan is so you know what
[30:31] Satan does he knew you was having the
[30:33] craving for something he knew you had
[30:35] his vacuum so what he did he brought
[30:36] every other thing he brought every other
[30:39] fleshly desire the lust of the Flesh and
[30:41] the lust of this life he brought all
[30:43] those things front of you that's right
[30:46] amen but we thank God for his grace amen
[30:50] amen that now when he bring this what he
[30:52] takes out it burns out everything burns
[30:55] out all the drust burns out everything
[30:56] that is not of God Amen
[30:59] that's why we lay aside every weight of
[31:01] sin everything that the enemy brings in
[31:04] amen and that's why now we are able to
[31:06] resist the devil the Bible says resist
[31:09] the devil and he shall flee so we find
[31:12] that as many as are led by the spirit of
[31:15] God they are the sons of God for you
[31:19] have not received the spirit of bondage
[31:21] again to
[31:22] fear amen so why you see what what what
[31:27] we had before for we had a spirit of
[31:29] bondage so when you find that in people
[31:31] are in fear and anxiety they still have
[31:33] a bondage upon them people are the devil
[31:36] still wants to oppress them and you know
[31:39] what what is the greatest
[31:41] fear when people are not
[31:44] sure they they know that their life is
[31:46] temporal right and they know there's the
[31:48] ending of their life and they're not
[31:51] certain and they don't have a revelation
[31:53] of what happens when this life
[31:55] ends but you know that you always was
[32:00] amen that you never began in the first
[32:02] place you was always in the thoughts of
[32:03] God you you was in Eternal thoughts of
[32:06] God hallelujah
[32:09] amen and if you never began in the first
[32:11] place you can't
[32:13] end because you an eternal son and

[32:29] people can take that
[32:31] responsibility then there must be
[32:33] manifestations of Sons and Daughters of

[43:08] has went started the Plan of Redemption
[43:10] immediately amen amen he killed the lamb
[43:13] there he know to be blood amen he
[43:15] started the work of redemption because
[43:17] why he needed to draw his sons back to
[43:19] him he wanted that Fellowship so badly
[43:23] amen and you think God is happy with us
[43:25] with this right now God wants his sons
[43:28] and daughters to have fellowship with
[43:30] him to come and commune with him amen
[43:32] yes amen that's why he says God in us we
[43:36] can't make that statement God in us but
[43:39] there's no atmosphere for God in us amen
[43:42] if it's God in us then people must see
[43:44] God in us amen amen when you got the
[43:47] Holy Ghost people must want to be around
[43:50] you that's right amen people must be
[43:52] attracted to you you must be like a
[43:54] magnet you know when you walking with
[43:55] the Holy Ghost the there's such an
[43:58] anointing around you that people notice
[43:59] there's something peculiar about you
[44:01] there's something different about you or
[44:03] you can be like every other negative
[44:05] human being that's what a human beings
[44:07] are right now you're not just like every
[44:09] other human being you're a spirit being
[44:11] you hous in a flesh body amen amen your
[44:13] house in a pestil in a in in a body
[44:16] that's rotting
[44:17] amen
[44:20] hallelujah so you find
[44:23] that we're living now like in this flesh
[44:27] our flesh the same as everybody else's
[44:30] it's every others it's same as your
[44:32] neighbors same as your your workmates
[44:34] your colleague mates your family members
[44:37] but
[44:38] inside inside there the great planter
[44:42] amen yes
[44:44] Hallelujah the great s
[44:47] amen he came he
[44:49] predestinated inside of you because why
[44:52] there was a bing ground inside
[44:54] there amen like how Mary
[44:57] had to have a bedding ground and said be
[45:00] unto me according to th word inside here
[45:02] there was a bedding ground for fate to
[45:04] fall in the sour now Faith couldn't fall
[45:07] anywhere else the beding ground had to
[45:09] be right amen because everywhere else
[45:12] there was a beding ground for
[45:14] doubt everyone else out of the
[45:16] predestination there was a beding ground
[45:18] for doubt but you had a beding ground
[45:20] for
[45:21] Faith amen
[45:24] and we had the beding ground
[45:27] in this hour so this Faith seed could
[45:29] grow the promises could grow amen the
[45:32] seed of promise that was within us it
[45:34] could grow amen that's the difference
[45:37] from every other human being and how did
[45:39] God know that but
[45:41] predestination amen he predestinated us
[45:44] because he said in his word whom he
[45:46] predestinate he justified and whom he
[45:50] justified he also
[45:52] glorified that's God's
[45:54] purpose that was God's plan
[45:58] amen but every time we had a revelation
[46:02] of this it wasn't easy you had to go to
[46:05] pain and suffering it's just like birth
[46:08] pains every time you had to go get a re
[46:10] every time there was a progression of
[46:11] the word it come with pain and suffering
[46:14] when God brought the prophet on the
[46:15] scene before the prophet could go out he
[46:18] had to go to pain and suffering he had
[46:20] to
[46:21] lose his wife he had to lose his
[46:24] daughter amen but God was calling him
[46:27] out amen because why a new chapter was
[46:30] taking place Hallelujah upon the Earth
[46:33] and therefore in your life you have to
[46:34] give away the things of the world you to
[46:37] die to self you had to be expelled from
[46:39] your family members you had to be hated
[46:42] amongst your work colleagues you had to
[46:44] be persecuted for the for the things
[46:46] that you were
[46:47] believing when you first were coming in
[46:49] because remember there was a transition
[46:50] taking place you are to now change
[46:54] change your lifestyle change the way you
[46:56] think
[46:57] and you began to get persecuted you
[46:59] began to be mocked you began to now bear
[47:02] the cross for Christ amen
[47:06] yeah amen and then we find that as we
[47:09] come in the word now it can't remain the
[47:11] same each time there has to be a
[47:14] progression remember we we are drinking
[47:16] from the inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[47:20] amen the the person that says they know
[47:22] it all there's something wrong with them
[47:24] then they denominated if some person and
[47:27] tell you we've got everything open to us
[47:29] we know everything the whole word yes
[47:30] the whole word is open to us the word is
[47:33] open it's already open portal is open
[47:36] but the Holy Ghost comes amen and we
[47:40] draw from this inexhaustible Fountain of
[47:43] Life his mercies are renewed every day
[47:47] amen
[47:48] amen so we find that this word is not
[47:50] stagnant it just progresses and
[47:53] progresses amen one bomb drops there
[47:55] from there drops to to another bomb to
[47:57] another bomb to another bomb amen it's
[48:00] like the splitting of atoms amen
[48:04] so so there's a crying out there must be
[48:06] a crying out you find that even here we
[48:09] know that we we there came a time where
[48:13] we realize we couldn't remain the same
[48:15] there was something wrong but there was
[48:17] we didn't realize there was a craving
[48:19] within us for more amen because why Holy
[48:23] Ghost must full on Holy Ghost amen yes
[48:26] but there was a claiming for more we
[48:29] were wasn't just satisfied with saying
[48:31] hey now I I received this message I'm
[48:33] I'm happy now I'm just going to church
[48:34] every week no we want to be a people
[48:38] that will have an impact on the earth
[48:40] amen we will be the they need to be a
[48:42] people and we are Believing by faith we
[48:45] are that people that Moses and Elijah is
[48:49] going to testify about that there the
[48:52] people that met the Rapture there were
[48:54] the people that walked with God Amen
[48:56] people that had an Enoch work amen in
[48:58] this hour there were the people that was
[49:00] one with God there were the people that
[49:02] displayed Christ upon the Earth there
[49:04] were the people that when they spoke
[49:06] things came to pass yes hallelujah amen
[49:10] because why this is the hour of the
[49:12] third P amen this is the hour when the
[49:17] anointing comes upon us that now we are
[49:21] known as we were known amen am
[49:25] [Music]
[49:26] so we find that when every time God is
[49:28] doing something God was meeting your C
[49:30] God was meeting your desire so if you
[49:32] want more of God if you have the desire
[49:34] God will meet the desire that's right
[49:36] amen but if you want to keep God limited
[49:38] no I'm just happy I'm just happy with
[49:40] that I'm just happy with that I don't
[49:42] want to progress anymore Lord you stay
[49:43] with it true amen but he blessed us with
[49:47] all spiritual blessings amen the prophet
[49:49] of God said is is a code where he says
[49:52] God don't want us he want us to live
[49:54] abundant lives he doesn't want to
[49:56] deliver underneath our privileges yes
[50:00] the reason why you don't have because
[50:03] you don't ask and when you ask you ask
[50:05] in other words you're asking in doubt
[50:07] you ask without believing that it will
[50:09] happen but you forget what you ask
[50:11] there's a substance amen
[50:14] amen but when you come into maturity you
[50:18] when you ask when you speak it's God
[50:22] speaking it's the same as God speaking
[50:26] because why you have that signing Powers
[50:29] now amen because this is the Holy Ghost
[50:31] saying this is this son of yours he's
[50:35] done the work he's passed the test and
[50:37] he says this is my beloved Son I will
[50:40] honor his words amen amen hallelujah

[56:08] amen
[56:09] amen so the placing of a son takes
[56:13] responsibility Amen to be positionally
[56:16] placed it takes a
[56:18] responsibility takes a responsibility of
[56:20] a surrendered life it takes a respons
[56:24] being separated from the sins of the
[56:25] world Amen
[56:26] it takes a responsibility to go and pray
[56:30] to study the word yes a lot of people
[56:33] like to there's nothing wrong to have
[56:35] fellowship with the word with the people
[56:37] I love that I love to have fellowship
[56:39] with people I love to have hear the
[56:40] preaching of the word but there comes
[56:42] the time when you need to be alone
[56:44] that's
[56:45] right and if you don't have that alone
[56:48] time with
[56:49] Christ he's going to be you're going to
[56:51] be one of those and says depart from me
[56:52] now workers of inqu I know you not
[56:57] it means you don't know him you don't
[56:59] have a personal relationship with him
[57:01] you haven't become one with him they
[57:03] must come the time where you don't want
[57:05] to be around people you must become
[57:07] educated there have to be that personal
[57:09] time where I have to have a closet time
[57:12] amen I just don't want to be around
[57:14] anybody I need to be I need to be synced
[57:16] with him
[57:17] amen amen and trust me if you want to
[57:21] benefit spiritually that is your best
[57:24] time that is your best time when you
[57:26] have that a long time you don't have to
[57:28] shout and pray you don't have to scream
[57:30] and Hollow and let everybody hear you
[57:32] amen amen I'm telling you now you'll see
[57:35] the greatest testimonies is that secret
[57:38] prayers amen that secret time with God
[57:41] you'll get the best revelation of the
[57:43] word you have a better understanding of
[57:44] the word amen is a secret time with God
[57:48] then you come out and have fellowship
[57:50] and be a blessing unto others amen you
[57:52] come and have fellowship and share your
[57:54] light with others that's why before the
[57:56] service on the Sunday morning people
[57:58] should be having their quiet time with
[58:00] God Fellowship in prayer with God prayer
[58:03] fellowship with the word and then we
[58:04] come there's a mighty outpouring of the
[58:06] holy spirit amen we each one coming with
[58:08] a licks of fire amen amen each one
[58:11] coming is an anointing that comes over
[58:12] the service amen and then whatever comes
[58:15] in if there now there's a brother or
[58:17] sister down whatever Spirit they become
[58:19] with that Spirits can't car in the
[58:21] presence of God it must depart amen yes
[58:24] amen now that's the church that that's
[58:27] that's the continuity of the book of
[58:29] Acts hallelujah
[58:33] amen so in this age what a privilege we
[58:35] are Imagine seven Thunders come to
[58:37] literally turn our hearts back to the
[58:39] Fai of the fathers why it couldn't
[58:41] happen in other age why they happen in
[58:44] this age because why you see Sun like
[58:48] like the plant right the sun just can't
[58:50] come and Scorch this the plant the seed
[58:54] it'll it'll with
[58:57] but the sun has to come in progression
[58:59] am just like that light had to come in
[59:04] progression if the opening of the word
[59:06] come in lud's day they would have died
[59:08] out in W's age they would have died out
[59:11] but they had to come little by little as
[59:13] light was needed light was given and now
[59:16] it's come oh I tell you now it's coming
[59:19] now in its fullness am amen that's why
[59:22] the because now it's a time of maturity
[59:25] in the time of M the Sun comes amen and
[59:28] it come in his brightness amen amen
[59:32] making the word clear to us clear to us
[59:36] but that's why even when you were first
[59:37] coming in everything couldn't come to
[59:38] you you didn't understand the thing you
[59:40] couldn't you could say I came I knew
[59:42] everything no every day we learning
[59:45] every day we progressing because why God
[59:47] knows how to give light as light J amen
[59:51] he doesn't want to scat you out and just
[59:53] push your way out you might have just
[59:54] left the message there
[59:57] he knew how to bring his word how to
[59:59] share light to you amen he knew how to
[1:00:01] open up his word to you so we find
[1:00:04] that as life was coming in we had a
[1:00:08] little life when
[1:00:10] fought in uh in Luda amen a little
[1:00:14] tessel the stock began to grow and then
[1:00:17] the tessel and then the Shar amen but
[1:00:22] then when when now the Sun watch out the
[1:00:26] Shar life had to go from because the
[1:00:29] life must go back to the grain now amen
[1:00:32] as life was coming into the Grain and
[1:00:34] the grain was drawing the life the Shar
[1:00:37] had to die out yes that's why there was
[1:00:39] a time still tearing there was still
[1:00:41] some movement in the Pentecostal World
[1:00:44] there was still some Crusades and all
[1:00:45] going on but now the shack died out
[1:00:49] there's no life there amen don't be
[1:00:51] deceived there's no life at all amen sir
[1:00:53] because the life is fully in the grain
[1:00:55] amen amen now you are drawing from the
[1:00:58] life amen you are drawing completely
[1:01:00] from the vine now amen because why you
[1:01:03] are part of the vine Hallelujah you are
[1:01:06] drawing the full life of the vine so
[1:01:08] that life that in Christ is also in you
[1:01:10] amen it's his blood your blood of his
[1:01:12] blood his DNA everything about him is in
[1:01:15] you his makeup is in you you can't you
[1:01:18] can't have another DNA it is DNA
[1:01:20] completely in you amen and now you have
[1:01:24] the life amen you have his nature you
[1:01:28] have his characteristics then it must
[1:01:30] come with power and
[1:01:31] demonstration amen if you have a life
[1:01:33] because he Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:35] yesterday today and forever amen so all
[1:01:38] these things the supernatural must take
[1:01:40] place amongst you because this is a
[1:01:41] supernatural God the thing we try to
[1:01:44] understand God to Natural Things
[1:01:47] sometime we read read our Bible to the
[1:01:48] Western idea of reading the Bible maybe
[1:01:51] you need to look at it through the
[1:01:52] Eastern I Eastern way because the Bible
[1:01:55] is written the east
[1:01:56] yes that's right so that's that's the
[1:02:00] way we look at things we look at things
[1:02:02] through what we T by
[1:02:05] science and we look at things naturally
[1:02:08] you can't be carnally minded with the
[1:02:09] things of God because it will bring
[1:02:11] forth this amen but you got to be
[1:02:14] spiritual minded amen so these are the
[1:02:18] responsibilities that it is it takes now
[1:02:22] to bring forth to embrace our positions
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:26] and to be good stewards of what's given
[1:02:28] to us to be faithful in what's given to
[1:02:32] us and then to
[1:02:34] impact to have an impact Amen to take
[1:02:37] what's given to us and have an impact
[1:02:39] yes now you can't have an impact we are
[1:02:42] just here together and you don't talk
[1:02:44] about God to the people of the
[1:02:46] world we are talking about God all the
[1:02:48] time those people now who's going to
[1:02:50] talk to them about God we just said the
[1:02:52] Shar is no life anymore there's no life
[1:02:55] only you have the life so who's going to
[1:02:59] give him life then
[1:03:01] yes so if we don't talk about God we
