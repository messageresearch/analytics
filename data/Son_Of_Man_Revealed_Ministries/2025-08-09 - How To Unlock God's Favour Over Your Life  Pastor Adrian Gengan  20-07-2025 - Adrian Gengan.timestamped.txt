[6:58] &gt;&gt; saved by the Lord Jesus Christ precious
[7:00] blood?
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; I owe it all

[7:11] &gt;&gt; I owe it all to Jesus.

[7:50] This song of love from deep.
[7:55] Say I owe it all. I owe it all
[8:00] to him.
[8:02] [Music]
[8:05] If I've been used in some small way
[8:11] [Music]
[8:13] &gt;&gt; to help someone, you need to
[8:17] &gt;&gt; if any good is found in me.
[8:21] If any good is found in

[9:21] song of love from deep within.
[9:25] [Music]
[9:28] I owe it all
[9:31] to him. Music play softly.
[9:35] Make this your prayer. I owe it all to
[9:39] Jesus.
[9:40] Just begin to thank him. Lord know I

[10:35] Amen. Father,
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, from the depths of our hearts, we
[10:39] say we owe it all to you.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; When we fell, oh God,
[10:45] &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden, there was no way
[10:46] back.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; We had lost fellowship.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; We had lost relationship.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; There was no way back to you.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; But Father, you came running to express
[10:59] your attribute.
[11:00] [Music]
[11:02] &gt;&gt; And as a savior, you came and you slew
[11:04] the lamb.
[11:06] paid the price.
[11:09] It was a partial atonement for the shed
[11:11] blood of that innocent lamb.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; But how we thank you, Lord, 2,000 years,
[11:16] 4,000 years later, oh God,
[11:18] &gt;&gt; you will come on the cross.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; The perfect bloody bleeding lamb,
[11:25] &gt;&gt; bled for our sins.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; We are washed in the blood of Jesus. Oh,
[11:30] I am so glad that the blood, oh God,
[11:34] &gt;&gt; that I can have forgiveness of sin.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; I can have fellowship back with God
[11:39] &gt;&gt; and I can have my relationship back.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; I give you glory, Lord. I give you
[11:44] glory, give you praise, give you honor
[11:46] this morning. Oh God,
[11:48] &gt;&gt; we thank you for every soul that has
[11:50] come into the house of the Lord this
[11:51] morning. I pray Lord that you would
[11:54] speak to every heart and meet them at
[11:56] the point of their need. Oh God, each
[11:57] one has come, Lord, with a burning
[11:59] desire to meet with you, Lord, to come,
[12:02] Lord, into a union with you, Father. I
[12:04] pray, Lord, that even now, oh God, your
[12:06] great Holy Spirit will come and
[12:08] tabernacle you, son and daughter of God.
[12:12] Even as your word comes forth, I pray,
[12:13] Lord, you'll break the bread of life to
[12:15] our hungry souls. We thank you for the
[12:17] songs of Zion. We thank you, Lord, for
[12:19] the music. We thank you for the singing,
[12:21] oh God. We thank you for each item, oh
[12:23] God. We Lord, everything was done to
[12:25] give you glory, Lord.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; But come and be pleased, Lord, and share
[12:29] your word with us, Lord. Be with us even
[12:31] in the meeting. Let your angels move, oh
[12:33] God, all across this place. I'm praying
[12:35] even now, they will surround us, oh God.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; We ask your blessings in Jesus name.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we give God a good anchor of
[12:45] praise?
[12:46] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. Amen. Amen.
[12:50] Amen. The angels bow before him. Heavens
[12:53] and earth adore him. What a mighty God
[12:57] &gt;&gt; we serve. Amen. So it's good to be in
[12:58] the house of the Lord this morning. I
[13:00] greet you all in the precious the holy
[13:02] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[13:04] Christ. Amen. One of these days we are
[13:06] going to see him face to face.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what a beautiful picture that
[13:10] will be to see our Lord face to face.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So Amen. I also want to
[13:16] greet Amen.
[13:18] Pastor Denzel's mom is here with us
[13:20] again. I didn't get your name, sister.
[13:22] Amen. Caleb, sister Sarah, you need to
[13:25] tell me the name,
[13:27] find out the name of sister and tell me
[13:29] loudly.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Sister Premier, let's welcome her this
[13:35] morning. Amen.
[13:38] You know, God can use women
[13:41] &gt;&gt; to raise up godly men to preach the
[13:44] gospel.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's her part of the
[13:47] ministry
[13:48] &gt;&gt; to have raised a godly son
[13:51] &gt;&gt; who is now a minister of the gospel of
[13:52] Jesus Christ. So the Lord reward you
[13:54] dear sister. Amen. We be blessed in his
[13:56] presence. Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles
[13:58] this morning.
[14:01] Amen.
[14:04] Don't forget, Amen. the combined service
[14:06] at 400 p.m. The Durban Girl Secondary
[14:09] School. Amen. Of pastor Moses Jova. It
[14:11] will be his final meeting. Amen. So come
[14:14] expecting a blessing.
[14:16] Amen. And you shall receive.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; You know, the Christian life is all
[14:20] about expectation.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; You get what you expect.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll turn to second Peter
[14:25] chapter 1 verse 11. This is the third
[14:27] part of our series. We were talking
[14:29] about a door being open to us.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we found the key to the door
[14:32] was revelation given to us.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone familiar with that?
[14:36] &gt;&gt; And then we found sometimes like last
[14:38] week's message now you can get into the
[14:40] kingdom but not have power. You can be
[14:42] the queen with no authority.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you need another ministry of
[14:47] attack to take you into the king's
[14:49] chamber.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; So it says in one uh second Peter 1:1,
[14:54] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[14:57] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[15:00] kingdom.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Now when when Peter is writing this, it
[15:07] is prophecy. If we are standing here in
[15:10] 2025, we can say an entrance has been
[15:13] ministered unto us abundantly.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; There is no ministry coming after the
[15:17] rapture.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to agree that the ministry
[15:21] has already been that the entrance has
[15:23] already been ministered to us via an
[15:25] anti-profit.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; And where is this everlasting kingdom?
[15:30] You'll find it in Ephesians. It's
[15:32] heavenly places. So the ministry is
[15:35] designed to pull us out of the lenian
[15:36] age,
[15:37] &gt;&gt; out of the chicken yard
[15:39] &gt;&gt; and put us
[15:41] &gt;&gt; into the bride age.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; It's called the everlasting kingdom
[15:45] because it's the blending of time and
[15:48] eternity.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; You remember the angel put up his hand
[15:50] and he said, "Time shall be no more."
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; So where we are placed positionally
[15:55] right now is in a place where we are
[15:57] blending into eternity into heavenly
[15:59] places.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Psalm 45 and verse4, mark this
[16:06] down. Make it your own if your
[16:07] scriptures you remember. For thou, oh
[16:09] Lord, will bless the righteous.
[16:13] With favor will thou compass him as with
[16:16] a shield. That word compass means to
[16:18] surround you. So he's saying the Lord's
[16:21] favor will surround us like a shield.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's favor is surrounding us
[16:29] like a shield.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Everywhere you go, you have favor.
[16:35] You turn to the left, favor surrounds
[16:37] you. You turn to the right, favor
[16:39] surrounds you. You go forward, favor
[16:41] surrounds you. You move backwards, favor
[16:44] surrounds you because it surrounds you
[16:46] like a shield.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:52] Esther 5 and two. Praise the Lord.
[17:00] And it was so when king the king saw
[17:03] Esther
[17:05] the queen standing in the court. What a
[17:07] beautiful sight this must have been.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible records Esther as being the
[17:11] most beautiful woman
[17:13] &gt;&gt; in all the land.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; So imagine the king beholding the most
[17:20] glorious bride in Revelation 19:7. The
[17:23] marriage of the lamb is come. His bride
[17:24] had made herself ready and she's clothed
[17:26] in fine linen. And so he's looking at
[17:27] you right now. And the king saw Esther
[17:30] standing in the court that she obtained
[17:33] favor.
[17:35] So favor is going to surround Esther
[17:36] like his shield.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Now remember what favor is. It's grace.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Grace is unmmerited favor.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Nothing we have done. Oh, somebody can
[17:48] thank the Lord.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; So favor surrounds Esther. She finds
[17:53] favor in his sight. And the king held
[17:56] out to Esther the golden scepter that
[17:58] was in his hand. And Esther drew near
[18:01] and touched the top of the scepter to
[18:04] say, "The grace you the favor you're
[18:06] extending to me, I accept it.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; There's a part for you to play.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; Don't just stand there in the presence.
[18:12] Go and reach and touch the scepter,
[18:15] &gt;&gt; showing that you're receiving whatever
[18:16] the king is giving us." One more portion
[18:18] of scripture before we se it. Zechariah
[18:20] 4:7.
[18:26] This is prophecy also of an end time
[18:28] people and where we are currently. Who
[18:30] art thou oh great mountain before
[18:33] Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain
[18:37] and he shall bring forth a headstone.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Thereof with shoutings.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; The headstone is shouting.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Somebody say the headstone is Christ.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; And what is he shouting?
[18:52] Unmmerited favor.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; He is shouting unmmerited favor.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Shouting grace. Grace.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; A double portion. Grace.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated. So I'm
[19:09] speaking this morning and an entrance
[19:11] has been ministered unlocking God's door
[19:15] of favor.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:24] In a normal love story, there's only one
[19:26] woman that can unlock the door to a
[19:28] man's heart.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; A man might meet many women along the
[19:33] way. Now, I'm talking about a straight
[19:36] man.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; A man who is committed to one woman.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about many women
[19:47] unlocking the door to your heart. And
[19:50] it's very important that the way you
[19:53] start is you either finish better and
[19:55] not worse.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Because if you read about Solomon,
[20:00] &gt;&gt; we are impressed that he asked God for
[20:02] wisdom.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; We are impressed that God blessed him.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; We're impressed that for thousand years
[20:08] there was peace.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; But how did Solomon end?
[20:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that Solomon's heart was
[20:15] turned away from God. Amen.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Because of the idols,
[20:20] &gt;&gt; so it's not tell your neighbor, it's not
[20:21] how you start,
[20:23] &gt;&gt; it's how you finish.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; So in 1970, 1980s, you were praying in
[20:29] the beach. Good.
[20:31] It's how you end.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; In the 80s and the '9s, and the 2000s,
[20:39] whenever you came across a message, you
[20:41] read the Bible, you were praying.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; What about now 2025?
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not going to attribute what
[20:48] you did in the past if you finished
[20:50] badly.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Help us.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; So we're speaking on unlocking God's
[20:59] door. Favor and entrance has been
[21:02] ministered to us.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you Lord.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Now if we are not aware of the time and
[21:09] season that we are living in
[21:12] we are not going to be able to meet what
[21:14] is required of us for the hour.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now the word favor
[21:20] means approval. If I give you my favor,
[21:23] you got my approval. You got my support.
[21:27] Amen. So God's favor is surrounding us
[21:30] like a shield.
[21:32] Now many of you, many of us probably
[21:35] don't even know that we haven't fallen
[21:37] because of God's favor.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Every day we are coming under demonic
[21:44] attack,
[21:45] &gt;&gt; spiritual attack,
[21:47] &gt;&gt; physical attack,
[21:48] &gt;&gt; and we are not standing on our own
[21:50] strength.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; I want you to know, no human strength
[21:53] can stand this test of time.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; It's got to be God's unmmerited favor
[21:58] upon our lives. Amen.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; That is why you and I are standing. So
[22:02] get this idea and this notion that we
[22:04] are big people and we are proud people.
[22:06] No, it's because of the favor of God.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; It's because of the mercy of God.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; I can't even walk without you holding my
[22:15] hand.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; The mountains too high. The valley is
[22:20] too wide.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; So it is God's favor surrounding us. We
[22:26] could have died in an accident, but
[22:28] God's favor was protecting us.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the Bible saying? The
[22:32] angel of the Lord and camp around them
[22:35] that fear him.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were trying to express to you
[22:39] that generally when you go camping, you
[22:41] have to take your tent.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; You have to take your necessary things
[22:45] to go and set up camp. But here the
[22:47] angel of the Lord is doing all the work
[22:49] because wherever you are moving, he is
[22:51] moving with you with his camp.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; He's setting up camp where you are.
[22:55] Amen.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's divine protection.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Do you know that every nation must
[23:04] protect its citizens?
[23:06] &gt;&gt; So when we come into the kingdom of God,
[23:08] it is no different. The kingdom of God
[23:10] has a highest standard.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; He takes care of our daily needs because
[23:14] in this kingdom, he doesn't leave us to
[23:17] fend for ourselves. But because we are
[23:18] the children of the king.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes care of our daily
[23:22] provision. Therefore, he said when you
[23:24] come into my kingdom and you seek my
[23:26] kingdom, don't even worry about food.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Don't even worry about clothing because
[23:30] that is my basic necessity that I will
[23:32] take care of.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; I will take care of your protection.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; I will take care of your daily needs.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; But if we you know sometimes there are
[23:42] grants unlocked to us
[23:44] &gt;&gt; and you don't go and apply for it and
[23:46] you're living under your privileges.
[23:49] For example, if you turn 60
[23:53] and you're not earning a income, the
[23:56] government has a provision for you to
[23:59] get assessor grant.
[24:02] How many of you aware of that?
[24:04] &gt;&gt; If you're 60 and you didn't aware of it,
[24:07] now you're aware of it. There's a sassa
[24:09] grant.
[24:11] Amen. And they pay you that money every
[24:14] month.
[24:15] Now imagine you're sitting in your
[24:17] house, you turn 60, you got no work, and
[24:19] you're starving, you're going asking
[24:20] everyone for money, but you never
[24:22] applied for the grant.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Whose fault is it?
[24:29] &gt;&gt; It's because of ignorance.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; You don't have the knowledge.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and how many of you know that
[24:37] in this time and season, you must have a
[24:39] concern for your own soul?
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You must seek out your own
[24:44] salvation with fear and trembling.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, do you have a concern
[24:48] for your soul?
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Young people, do you have a concern for
[24:51] your soul?
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know where you're going to go
[24:54] when you die?
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And don't leave it to chance.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election
[25:04] show.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Know for a certainty that if I had to
[25:07] breathe my last right now, I will be in
[25:10] the presence of God.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't leave it to chance.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Don't be like that rich young ruler
[25:18] &gt;&gt; who turned away from Jesus. You say, "I
[25:21] would never turn away from Jesus." But
[25:23] then you turn away and walk away from
[25:24] this preacher.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know you are turning and walking
[25:28] away from Jesus?
[25:30] &gt;&gt; When you tell me, "I'll hear you
[25:32] tomorrow," you are telling Jesus, "I'll
[25:34] hear you tomorrow."
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Some of you tell me you will never lie
[25:38] to Jesus, but you lie to me. Mhm.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[25:42] &gt;&gt; you lie to your brothers and your
[25:43] sisters.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, but now it's different.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; We forget that we are living in
[25:52] apostolic times again.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Where somebody lied to Peter.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody lied to Peter and Peter as why
[26:02] did you lie to the
[26:03] &gt;&gt; ghost?
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; People lie easily.
[26:09] People lie like what knife throw a
[26:12] butter.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; People give the lamest excuse. I I'll
[26:17] just quote the prophet the way he says
[26:19] it. You can let the chips fall where it
[26:22] must. The prophet says not to come to
[26:24] church on a Sunday is a
[26:27] &gt;&gt; s i
[26:30] &gt;&gt; sin.
[26:33] Why is it the same word that e was
[26:35] caught in?
[26:38] same word.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; So which means you're equally as guilty
[26:41] as Eve, but you keep picking on Eve.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; S I N.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; And in this time and season, I want to
[26:53] tell you, not only on a Sunday,
[26:58] &gt;&gt; if you're supposed to be in church, it's
[27:00] your duty. The prophet says, if the
[27:02] doors of the church are open, it is your
[27:04] duty.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. to be found in fellowship with
[27:08] believers of like precious faith.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; That's the prophet.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Now, we can't claim to be saying we
[27:16] believe a prophet. We believe a prophet
[27:18] only in word.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to find ourselves like I
[27:22] think it's Isaiah 4 if you put it there.
[27:24] It could be Isaiah 4. If it's not, I'll
[27:26] maybe try seven.
[27:29] Amen.
[27:32] Yeah. This is what people want. In that
[27:34] day, seven women shall take hold of one
[27:36] man.
[27:37] They want the name of Jesus.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; They want to be associated with the name
[27:42] of Jesus.
[27:45] Seven men, seven women shall take hold
[27:47] of one man, saying, "We will eat our own
[27:49] bread.
[27:51] Wear our own apparel and only let us be
[27:54] called by thy name to take away our
[27:57] reproach."
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they want the name of Jesus
[28:02] which is a blas amen names of blasphemy.
[28:04] They got the name of Jesus on their
[28:05] churches but they don't want his word.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; So they are saying
[28:14] the shoes on my feet I bought it.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; The car I'm driving I bought it.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Hey they're independent women.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Do you know something? You can't be an
[28:26] independent woman in the kingdom of God.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:30] Yes.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Go read the opening chapter of Esther
[28:33] and see what happened to independent
[28:35] woman.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Vasti.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Vasti was an independent woman.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; She was having she was in the kingdom
[28:47] having the king's name but having
[28:49] private functions.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; The king calls.
[28:56] She is so disobedient. She doesn't even
[28:58] respond to the king's word.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; People want the name of Jesus.
[29:07] They want to say we go to a message
[29:09] church. They want to say we believe in
[29:12] time prophet. They want to say I believe
[29:14] Jesus, but then they deny the word.
[29:16] Jesus said
[29:19] repent and be baptized in the name of
[29:22] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, people don't want to be
[29:25] baptized in his name.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; People want to believe in a trinity of
[29:32] gods.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; When when even Israel had the revelation
[29:38] here, oh Israel,
[29:39] &gt;&gt; the Lord thy God is one Lord.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this scripture is becoming more
[29:47] of a reality
[29:49] and people are looking for that time for
[29:51] the fulfillment of the scripture
[29:53] physically. But they don't know it's a
[29:55] spiritual application.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual application.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So when now
[30:06] remember what Jesus said, seek first the
[30:08] kingdom and his righteousness, all these
[30:10] things shall be added. Here they are
[30:11] saying we don't even want the provisions
[30:13] within the kingdom.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Because our denomination is so great, so
[30:19] powerful, we bring in millions,
[30:22] &gt;&gt; thousands.
[30:24] we are able to take care of ourselves.
[30:27] Only give us your name so we can operate
[30:29] under your name
[30:33] &gt;&gt; and collect the funds every week.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; That's what they're doing. They're
[30:38] operating under the name of Jesus Christ
[30:42] to collect funding.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; How many of you are seeing that?
[30:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. They are using the name of
[30:51] Jesus Christ to collect funds,
[30:55] charitable organizations. Amen.
[30:58] So what we have learned like we I'm just
[31:01] going to summarize this very quickly.
[31:04] Jesus is the door, right? John 10:7.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; John 10:7. Jesus is the door. Jesus
[31:10] said, "I am the door." And then we found
[31:12] Revelation 10:7 is the key to unlock the
[31:16] door.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:21] Because you can't understand who Jesus
[31:23] is, who Christ is. Christ is the mystery
[31:26] of God revealed. And you need Revelation
[31:29] 10:7 to unlock John 10:7.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; We've been through that message two
[31:33] weeks ago.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to have the key of
[31:36] Revelation to unlock Jesus. You need a
[31:38] prophet. You need a pastor. You need a
[31:40] minister to minister this entrance into
[31:43] you to unlock this door.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; We found that every kingdom must have a
[31:47] queen. And we have been selected as the
[31:50] royal
[31:51] &gt;&gt; queen of heaven.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; As the most beautiful queen,
[31:54] &gt;&gt; but I'm saying that the Lord is taking
[31:56] us now from just queen
[31:59] &gt;&gt; and he's establishing us as super queen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; As a queen without authority
[32:05] and now placing us as a queen with
[32:07] authority.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; How do we know? Character building.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's been building up our
[32:13] character, taking us through stages in
[32:15] his word to show us, I need to develop
[32:17] your character in order for you to be
[32:20] able to handle the authority.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[32:31] Now, people have responded to the
[32:33] prophet's message. We believe the
[32:34] message. Amen. We believe this message.
[32:38] How many of you have responded to the
[32:39] prophet's message? Yeah.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; How many of you here because of your
[32:42] mother? How many of you here because of
[32:44] your father?
[32:46] &gt;&gt; How many of you here because of your
[32:47] brother, your sister or friend?
[32:52] &gt;&gt; We ought to be here because of our own
[32:54] personal relationship with the Lord
[32:55] Jesus.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know there can be no context?
[32:58] People like context.
[33:01] Time come for rapture, there will be no
[33:02] context.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; The rich young ruler didn't have a
[33:08] context. He saw Abraham, but he realized
[33:11] this contact to Abraham would not work.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; You don't make the rapture finished.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; There's a word we use. It's called
[33:19] kaput. You know the word kaput.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Finish and cloud.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that word?
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So when the
[33:37] mystery of God is revealed, we are
[33:40] finding that part of the mystery of God
[33:42] being revealed is a door to marriage was
[33:44] open to us.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Remember we showed you brother
[33:51] Brandham's commission was to find a
[33:52] bride like Eliza found a bride.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; So door to marriage was open to us. So
[33:59] this entrance being ministered to us is
[34:00] the door to marriage. And the only way
[34:03] the door can be opened is after
[34:05] denominational ages have run out.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; You see, we got too many people that
[34:11] have accepted the message
[34:13] &gt;&gt; of the hour, accepted the end time
[34:15] prophet, but are stuck in
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Leia.
[34:19] Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; But the prophet says at the top at the
[34:22] seventh step,
[34:24] &gt;&gt; there's somebody there to meet you, a
[34:26] messenger
[34:27] &gt;&gt; to lead you to the king's chamber.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; the king's chamber is not in the seven
[34:34] church age.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; The king's chamber is in the headstone.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Nobody saying amen.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, don't sleep.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Sleeping must endure for the night.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; You must sleep at home. You can't come
[34:57] in the church and sleep. Amen. Today I'm
[35:00] being nice. I'm telling you nicely. Next
[35:02] week I will say, "Brother way, wake up."
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Why? We only here and and you can't
[35:13] accuse me of being a long preacher.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; So there's no reason why you should be
[35:19] asleep.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I try and condense a message
[35:25] so you get as much message content as
[35:28] possible
[35:29] &gt;&gt; in the short period of time. But I need
[35:31] you to retain it in your knowledge and I
[35:33] need you to be awake.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Next time if I see you sleepy I'm
[35:37] going to say I five your neighbor. Then
[35:38] you know why. Praise the Lord.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; So we're finding Amen. that the door to
[35:44] marriage is open. And how did we become
[35:47] aware that the door to marriage is open?
[35:49] It was under the seventh seal. Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; It was a mystery.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet would say it like Romeo
[35:58] coming for Juliet,
[36:00] &gt;&gt; like a thief coming in the night.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery under the seventh seal
[36:04] that he takes a bride.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; He marries her
[36:08] &gt;&gt; and he puts his seed word in her.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Why? His end goal is for restoration of
[36:14] relationship which is sons of God.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember it's a very simple story.
[36:22] What was lost must be restored.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Sunship was lost. So what must be
[36:27] restored?
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Sunship.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; And God is not somebody who won't walk
[36:31] in order. In order for him to get a son,
[36:33] he needs a wife.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; So he takes us collectively as a wife.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; And he reproduces his life in us to
[36:39] bring us back to sunship.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the opening of the
[36:45] door, like we're saying, has only
[36:46] happened now
[36:49] &gt;&gt; after denominational ages have run out.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; The opening of the door to marriage
[36:54] wasn't opened in the time of Luther.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; In the time of Wesley,
[36:59] &gt;&gt; in the time of restoration of the gifts,
[37:02] &gt;&gt; I'll show you even had gifts because a
[37:04] guy gives her gifts to go before the
[37:06] king.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; So she had restoration of gifts,
[37:11] &gt;&gt; but she didn't have the give of the
[37:12] gifts. Amen.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you see it?
[37:14] &gt;&gt; There's a separation line.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; You can't enter into the presence of the
[37:18] king.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; There isn't. So, you can come so close
[37:21] to the message. You can come so close to
[37:23] receiving the prophetic word.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; But you got no relationship with the
[37:27] king.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; So, in the book of Esther, we seeing
[37:35] she's called, she's chosen for marriage,
[37:37] but she's a queen without power under
[37:39] Agi. But an entrance was ministered unto
[37:41] her via a tech and she had a choice to
[37:44] make. Now listen, this is very important
[37:47] because I can't come and force you into
[37:49] the presence the shakina glory of the
[37:51] Lord.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; That's not the ministry of
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Ach.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; As much as we would like to pull you and
[37:57] push you into the presence, it's only a
[38:00] ministry to tell you that you can go in
[38:04] &gt;&gt; that that's your ought to be
[38:05] conditioned.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; But Esther herself had to make up her
[38:08] own mind. Amen.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; You'll find there she finally sends word
[38:14] if you want to read it in Esther chapter
[38:16] 4.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:24] Okay, let's read verse 11. I want to get
[38:26] this point in as well.
[38:34] All the king's servants and people of
[38:36] the king's province do know that
[38:39] whosoever whether man or woman
[38:43] shall come unto the king into the inner
[38:46] court. You see we're talking about three
[38:48] courts here.
[38:50] Whoever comes into the holiest of
[38:52] holies. Whoever comes into the shik of
[38:54] glory,
[38:57] there is one law of his is to be put to
[39:00] death except such as to whom the king
[39:03] shall hold out the golden scepter
[39:05] &gt;&gt; that he may live. But I have not been
[39:07] called to come in unto the king these 30
[39:10] days.
[39:13] 30 days.
[39:15] She didn't see the king. Now pay
[39:18] attention to that because the message is
[39:21] not
[39:24] to the public.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Under the seventh seal, the message is
[39:30] not to the public.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; So to the public, you are not allowed to
[39:35] come into the king's chamber.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; But only one who bears his name
[39:42] &gt;&gt; has the right.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Let me put it this way. Moriah was not
[39:50] contacting any other individual to go
[39:52] and speak to the king.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; There is only one woman designed
[39:56] &gt;&gt; to go and speak to the king.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Wonderful.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I mean, I was speaking
[40:06] to some brothers here and they was
[40:07] rereading the book of Esther and they
[40:10] were telling me they're unlocking
[40:11] nuggets in there.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Because they can see our story in there.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. Remember there's only two books
[40:17] named after woman in the Bible.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; One is Ruth which speaks about
[40:21] redemption.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; And the other is Esther who speaks about
[40:24] being a queen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; So from redemption to queen and that's
[40:29] how we end.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Redeemed at the cross
[40:32] &gt;&gt; standing here as the queen.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Having I'm saying this somebody please
[40:37] get me. Having already overcome
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Leosia.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[40:45] I already overcame Lisia.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But tomorrow I may
[40:50] fall. I don't care about tomorrow. I'm
[40:52] telling you, I already overcame it here.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; It's a finished work.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ has made provision for me
[41:01] because I'm not living on my own
[41:02] strength. I'm living on what his word
[41:04] said for me.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; He says, I will present you
[41:11] &gt;&gt; without spot. Amen.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. Right now, you may be
[41:15] sitting here with spots, but the Lord
[41:16] Jesus Christ is saying, "I will present
[41:18] you without spots,
[41:20] &gt;&gt; without wrinkle."
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Christ sees you as perfect.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Stop depending upon our
[41:28] own human strength
[41:29] &gt;&gt; upon even upon our own human emotion.
[41:32] Oh, I don't feel. Amen. You need to
[41:34] squash your feelings.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; You need to operate by the Holy Ghost.
[41:37] Amen.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; So Esther had a choice to make. Now
[41:46] watch, she makes her own mind up here.
[41:49] Now watch in Esther chapter Amen 4:1 16.
[41:54] Now after speaks to her, the words of
[41:57] Modiah, listen, I'm I'm bringing this
[42:00] because it's up to you. Now
[42:05] go gather all the Jews that are present
[42:07] in Shusham and fast you for me. She's
[42:11] now making this commitment.
[42:15] And neither eat nor drink three days,
[42:18] night or day. I also and my maidens will
[42:21] fast likewise.
[42:24] So will I go into in unto the king which
[42:26] is not according to the law. And if I
[42:29] perish, I perish.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Now watch Modiah. He's not alarmed
[42:37] &gt;&gt; that this woman might die. So Mori went
[42:40] his way and did according to all that
[42:42] Esther had commanded him.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; You as Esther
[42:54] must consecrate your life.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; We're missing this part of before she
[43:00] appears before the king.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; She consecrates her life.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me tell you the access to
[43:06] divine power is a life of consecration.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; The access to the divine power must be
[43:15] accompanied by consecration.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; If you want to operate in the greater
[43:20] things that Jesus did, you must match
[43:22] Jesus surrender.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; You see, people are not here now, but
[43:32] people don't like this kind of
[43:33] preaching. It's too close to home.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Why don't tell us about how we are
[43:38] saved?
[43:39] &gt;&gt; I'm asking about your prayer life.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Tell me how Jesus loves me. Do you pray?
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Tell me about how we are the wife of the
[43:50] Lord Jesus Christ. Do you read your
[43:52] Bible?
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Why you keep changing the topic?
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We claim to be Christians without
[44:02] Christ.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; You see, I'm giving you a break this
[44:07] week. Every Christian ought to carry his
[44:11] &gt;&gt; and come to church.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Come to church. Carry your what?
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Bible. And come to church. This is not
[44:20] your Bible.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; What is this?
[44:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take all we're going to go
[44:26] on excursion.
[44:27] We're all going to go on excursion.
[44:29] We're going to go to the court, brother
[44:31] Joshua.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; They allow you this in court.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; They don't.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; You go to school, they allow this in
[44:41] school.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; No,
[44:42] &gt;&gt; they don't.
[44:45] But how come in the higher kingdom?
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; The greatest kingdom,
[44:52] &gt;&gt; we treat God anyhow.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; If you got money to buy takeaway, you
[44:56] got money to buy yourself a Bible.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Ask your neighbor, "Where's your Bible?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Where's your Bible?" You can buy every
[45:07] other thing.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Where's the most important thing?
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Abu, preach us the greatest. I'm giving
[45:13] you the greatest thing here.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; I want you to have the greatest thing in
[45:16] your hand. How many of you can't afford
[45:18] a Bible?
[45:21] You putting your hand up?
[45:26] Who can't afford a Bible?
[45:28] with the Josh. You got a Bible. I saw
[45:31] you got a Bible at home or you got it
[45:33] there, right?
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Bible first.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; How many of you will comment to bring
[45:40] your Bible to church?
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Now, don't only bring it to church. Read
[45:44] it before you come to church.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, this is not only I'd rather
[45:50] be honest, it's not only for the
[45:51] congregation. It's for musicians as
[45:53] well.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Musicians must read their Bible.
[46:00] And all our musicians said
[46:03] &gt;&gt; so all musicians will bring their
[46:05] &gt;&gt; because when when we are reading the
[46:07] scripture now you will take your Bible
[46:09] and you will make notes mark this is the
[46:11] scripture we read. Amen. Praise the
[46:14] Lord.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Hey I can sense the atmosphere getting
[46:18] sour here.
[46:20] People don't like this kind of
[46:21] preaching.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But today we are at your doorstep.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We first got going to unlock your
[46:28] door
[46:29] &gt;&gt; and see what kind of skeletons are
[46:31] behind your door.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Why can't we be people of integrity?
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Why can't we be upright people?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Righteous people.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christians that are God is not
[46:44] ashamed of.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; But God is proud to say that is my son
[46:48] and daughter.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, we're not here playing church.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; We are here getting ready for a rapture.
[46:55] Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; We here to get ourselves ready.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; You know, people will go to great
[47:00] lengths.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; They can't come to church, but we let
[47:02] them get sick. They can get to hospital.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; They'll make their way to get to the
[47:08] clinic.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Even if they have to go there 4:00 in
[47:12] the morning,
[47:14] &gt;&gt; because they are so confident an earthly
[47:16] doctor can help them.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; But the prophet says the church, the
[47:20] body of Christ is the sickest body.
[47:24] And this is a hospital.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; But we come here 10.
[47:30] The doctor available.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; We we laughing now, but check what time
[47:37] you came to church
[47:38] &gt;&gt; today. And nobody's excluded. Not even
[47:41] me.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Check what time you came. In fact, the
[47:44] only person that could have come late is
[47:46] me.
[47:51] How come you start work at 8:00 you can
[47:53] make it on time by 10:00 you can't make
[47:55] it.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to everyone.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; How come we don't prioritize church?
[48:06] How come we are late for church?
[48:09] And we're wondering why the atmosphere
[48:11] is like this. People can't sing.
[48:14] People can't sing. They were watching
[48:16] movies last night.
[48:19] They were having brides. They were
[48:20] having lots of things
[48:22] &gt;&gt; and were not preparing themselves to
[48:24] come to church to hear from heaven.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; We're coming here up as it. I'll be
[48:37] honest. We're coming here uphazard.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; We are not coming here realizing that
[48:43] this is the entrance to the king.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; So I'm coming early.
[48:49] My quiet time. Now your quiet time is
[48:52] even if your wife shouted at you in the
[48:54] car, you can now your spirit
[49:01] because now you're standing next to in
[49:02] the church. You finish shouting at you.
[49:03] Now you're going to worship.
[49:05] So you need to read your Bible. You need
[49:08] to pray.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to get your spirit right.
[49:14] We need to get rid of all that demons.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:26] Lord met Rebecca at the well. He went
[49:29] half an hour before Eliza.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; So the angel of the Lord is here
[49:33] already.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord is here already.
[49:43] Are you coming at 10?
[49:48] Some of us know we got responsibilities
[49:50] in the church,
[49:52] but we will not even make an effort. I
[49:56] was hearing one preacher, Brother Steven
[49:58] Shemble. He says, "If your parents are
[50:00] late, get in your own car and get to
[50:02] church." Or even tell them, you can tell
[50:04] them other things, but you can't tell
[50:05] them, "Mom and dad, why are we going
[50:06] late to church?"
[50:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know. It sounds like sourdough
[50:16] bread today.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, that's a good bread.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Sourdough bread is very good
[50:24] &gt;&gt; for your gut. Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Because they say you your healing is in
[50:29] your gut.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; So tell your neighbor today is sour
[50:32] bread.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; We're cleaning our guts.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; It's okay if we don't get through the
[50:37] sermon.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; It's not so much about his sermon.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; It's about getting ourselves right with
[50:42] God.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:53] So what does Eston need to do? The king
[50:55] is the head. He's the headstone.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; She needs to get to the headstone. And
[50:59] as she nears him, she's coming into his
[51:02] image. That's a quote. As she nears him,
[51:05] &gt;&gt; she'll be so much like him. How? Through
[51:07] prayer.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Through consecration.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; She'll be so much like him that heaven
[51:13] won't even know whether it's Jesus
[51:15] praying or you praying.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That's a direct quote, too.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:24] How many of you know that in a natural
[51:26] birth there's a timeline given?
[51:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; You only got 9 months now. You can't
[51:33] love being pregnant more than bringing
[51:35] forth that child.
[51:38] You can't say, "Hey, for 9 months,
[51:41] whatever I told my husband, he just
[51:42] bought it.
[51:44] So, I'm going to try and keep this
[51:45] baby." See, now
[51:49] sister Colleen will be the perfect
[51:50] example. She probably can't wait for the
[51:54] baby to come.
[51:56] So, there's only a timeline given for
[51:58] you to bring forth the life of Christ.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Some people want to bring forth the life
[52:02] of Christ after the rapture. No, now is
[52:05] the time.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Now are we the sons of
[52:08] God."
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know what happens when you go
[52:11] overturn? Emergency procedures must be
[52:14] taken. Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Emergency procedures must be taken.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; I know some of you feel like you're
[52:22] having a C-section right now.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; But that's what we're trying to do.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; We are performing emergency procedure
[52:30] even now. Trying to perform a C-section
[52:33] to get the life of Christ out of us.
[52:36] [Applause]
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; We don't want stillborn babies.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want people who can't say
[52:45] a good hallelujah, a good praise the
[52:47] Lord, a good amen. Holy Ghost have
[52:49] filmed religion. Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Uh let's get to that quote. I think it's
[52:57] the first quote there. Amen. Praise the
[52:59] Lord. Talking about it says just
[53:02] previous of this chapter.
[53:04] Amen. Now, watch. But
[53:07] I promise you, I won't go over time,
[53:11] right? We'll get to as much as we can.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; But please take something with you.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Just the previous chapter, we find one
[53:22] place where the son of God spends so
[53:24] much time in prayer.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And if Jesus had to spend much time in
[53:29] prayer
[53:32] to stay in fellowship with the spirit.
[53:34] Oh, so now I know why I need to pray.
[53:38] Now I know why I feel so disconnected
[53:40] from the spirit because I haven't prayed
[53:42] for the whole week.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; And you know how it starts? It starts
[53:46] where you miss a day.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Then you miss two days.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; You see remember the frog in the
[53:53] &gt;&gt; tub.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; If you put hot water, it jumps out
[53:59] slowly.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; He makes you
[54:04] ticky talk.
[54:07] Tik Tok is better than praying
[54:13] because you scroll mindlessly. Facebook
[54:15] is better than praying. WhatsApp status
[54:20] is better than praying. I'm not saying
[54:22] it is, but that's how Satan sells it.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Before you know it,
[54:29] it used to be maybe 5 minutes in the
[54:31] toilet.
[54:33] Now
[54:36] 1 hour.
[54:39] Hey, am I speaking truth?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not you. Maybe it's your
[54:43] neighbor.
[54:46] 1 hour gone.
[54:48] You know everyone's story now.
[54:52] Okay. Everybody's story. The Bible says
[54:55] in the last days, people will be lovers
[54:57] of their own self.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. People
[55:06] will be lovers of their
[55:08] &gt;&gt; own selves.
[55:10] Heavy highminded.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Is that the Bible?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why you think they call it
[55:17] YouTube?
[55:19] &gt;&gt; It's all about you.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. YouTube.
[55:25] Any of you can start a YouTube channel.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Any of you can start a Tik Tok channel
[55:30] and it's all about you.
[55:33] Amen. So, let's finish reading this
[55:35] quote. The son of God spends so much
[55:38] time in prayer. And if Jesus had to
[55:40] spend much time in prayer to stay in
[55:42] fellowship with the spirit that was in
[55:45] him, how much more do you and I have to
[55:47] spend in prayer?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes I know that we'll forget
[55:52] the quote. So, I want us all to read it.
[55:55] When you read something, you retain it
[55:56] in your knowledge. So, let's start. And
[55:59] if Jesus had to spend much time in
[56:02] prayer to stay in fellowship with the
[56:04] spirit that was in him, how much more do
[56:08] you and I have to spend in prayer?
[56:11] Right. Next one.
[56:14] Much time in prayer. If you only knew
[56:16] what time in prayer meant.
[56:20] Sometimes when you're in prayer, God
[56:23] changes the complete destination of
[56:25] different things that's going to happen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:29] Hallelujah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; So prayer can change
[56:35] &gt;&gt; so prayer becomes a
[56:37] &gt;&gt; key.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Hezekiah, you're going to die.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Prayer can change it.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Jonah speaking to Nineveh, you're going
[56:50] to die.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; But repenting sackloth and ashes and
[56:53] prayer can change it.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:59] Ahab, you're not walking. But Aab walks
[57:02] softly.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; And God said, look how Ahab has turned
[57:06] and he's walking softly before me. I
[57:08] won't bring judgment in these days. I'll
[57:09] bring it upon his son.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; You mean prayer can change the heart of
[57:14] God?
[57:17] &gt;&gt; So prayer is communication.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; So you mean a man loves communication?
[57:25] the complete destination of different
[57:27] things. Now watch, he says different
[57:28] things. Whatever your situation is,
[57:31] &gt;&gt; prayer can change it.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Even now,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; I know some of you have been praying for
[57:37] a year, for two years for things, I'm
[57:39] saying even now,
[57:41] prayer can change it.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Prayer can change it. Young people, hear
[57:47] me when I say the value of prayer. What
[57:50] is prayer for? To connect with the Holy
[57:54] We just read that prayer can change
[57:56] things in your life. Young people, if
[57:58] you ever going through things in your
[58:00] life, you don't know who to turn to,
[58:03] pray.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Pray.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; You may not have access to Ramapoza,
[58:12] &gt;&gt; but you got access to the King of Kings.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; You got access to the Lord of Lords.
[58:20] So he says when you're in prayer, God
[58:22] changes a complete destination of
[58:25] different things that's going to happen.
[58:27] Do you believe that?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading.
[58:31] Might be something fixing to happen and
[58:33] your prayer could change the whole
[58:35] situation.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Now listen, your prayer could change the
[58:40] whole situation.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So yes, you may be able to phone
[58:45] brother Romesh and say, "Brother, pray
[58:47] for me." But he says your prayer
[58:52] &gt;&gt; could change the whole situation.
[58:56] Well, you're saying if God knows it's
[58:58] going to happen, what would my prayer do
[59:03] right now? Maybe that's a question among
[59:06] the young people. What purpose is my
[59:09] prayer?
[59:10] What would my prayer do? You remember
[59:13] now he's talking about Jesus. You
[59:15] remember when Jesus was standing there
[59:16] looking upon the harvest, he was the
[59:18] Lord of the harvest.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; He said the harvest is ripe
[59:23] &gt;&gt; and the laborers are few. So Jesus knew
[59:26] there were people to be saved
[59:28] &gt;&gt; and Jesus knew that the laborers are
[59:30] few. But what does he do? He doesn't
[59:32] just automatically sends them. What does
[59:34] he say?
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Pray.
[59:37] I know there are people to be saved and
[59:39] I know there are few laborers but I need
[59:41] to connect with the body.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; To pray.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Is this Bible?
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Pray ye the Lord of the harvest that he
[59:54] will send laborers into his harvest. So
[59:57] if people didn't pray, would laborers go
[59:59] forth?
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; I wonder if that's why there are very
[1:00:02] few evangelists on the field today
[1:00:04] because people have stopped praying.
[1:00:06] Hallelujah.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; We have made up our minds
[1:00:12] that outreach doesn't work. We made it
[1:00:14] up.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Voice of God made up their mind. We
[1:00:20] won't print books anymore.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody made up their mind that their
[1:00:26] method and their idea of things is the
[1:00:29] way it should be.
[1:00:31] But here, okay, let's break this down.
[1:00:35] Your prayer activates Jesus to sends out
[1:00:39] evangelists.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Is that what the scripture is saying?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Your prayer pray the Lord of the harvest
[1:00:46] which is Jesus that he will send
[1:00:49] laborers into the harvest.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Am I reading wrong?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; So is it depending on your prayer? Let's
[1:00:56] continue reading. You'll see what the
[1:00:57] prophet is saying. In other words, pray
[1:00:59] to me that I will send laborers into my
[1:01:01] harvest which I'm just telling you it's
[1:01:04] such a needy thing.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; So Jesus recognizes the need for lost
[1:01:09] souls and he's saying but it's connected
[1:01:11] to your prayer. Is somebody getting
[1:01:13] this?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet even says if you
[1:01:19] can't go
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; he says sometimes you got an evangelist
[1:01:23] he says you can pray for him. He says
[1:01:25] sometimes if you got a dollar you can
[1:01:27] give him so he can go.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; He says maybe you can't go.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But we know these things but do we do
[1:01:32] it?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus says happy are ye if you do it.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Right. Let's just keep reading. We're
[1:01:38] going to close on this. You can see I
[1:01:39] closed my laptop. This is the last quote
[1:01:41] we're reading. But now watch I'm just
[1:01:45] I've just explained it but watch how the
[1:01:46] prophet now further is going to confirm
[1:01:48] what I'm saying. Part of it lays in
[1:01:52] somebody say me. Part of it lays in me.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Do you believe this? The kingdom of God
[1:01:58] lays within the human.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in one place, I am the vine.
[1:02:07] You are the branches.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; The vine can't bear fruit.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; The branches in the vine bear fruit.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; God cannot bear fruit of himself.
[1:02:24] Wow.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; But I thought all things are possible.
[1:02:29] God works according to his law.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; God works according to his nature.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; God works according to his
[1:02:34] characteristics. So he won't bypass the
[1:02:36] law.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a quote in the in the
[1:02:39] rapture message. Jesus wants fruit for
[1:02:41] himself.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Right now here this quote is saying God
[1:02:47] can't bear fruit of himself. It's got to
[1:02:50] take the
[1:02:53] Somebody say me. It's got to take me.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; It's got to take you branches to bear
[1:02:59] fruit.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; And when you branches are yielded to the
[1:03:02] vine, then fruit can come.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Fruit comes forth. See what I mean?
[1:03:08] God wants. Somebody say, "My hands."
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; My hands.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; He wants my eyes. Somebody say, "My
[1:03:14] eyes."
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; My eyes.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; He wants your tongue. Somebody say, "My
[1:03:17] tongue."
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; My tongue.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; He wants your lips. Somebody say my
[1:03:20] lips.
[1:03:21] He wants your ears. Somebody say, "My
[1:03:23] ears."
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; My ears.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Wants your hands and feet
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; so he can bring forth fruit through
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; me.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to We're going to close now.
[1:03:38] Let's all stand.
[1:03:40] We're going to read this together and
[1:03:42] we're going to replace all the times it
[1:03:44] says yours with mine.
[1:03:47] Right. And the last word, you to me.
[1:03:53] Easy enough. Let's read. God wants my
[1:03:56] hands. He wants my eyes. He wants my
[1:04:00] tongue. Wants my lips. Wants my ears.
[1:04:03] Wants my hands and feet so he can bring
[1:04:07] forth truth through me.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a good hand of
[1:04:12] praise.
[1:04:15] I know I didn't really get into much of
[1:04:17] it. Amen. But I believe the Holy Spirit
[1:04:20] has spoke what is needful for the
[1:04:22] church.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we needed a little scrubbing
[1:04:26] this morning.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe we needed a bit of shaking up.
[1:04:35] Maybe we needed sourdough bread
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; to clean the gut.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Go and read about about the gut
[1:04:44] that you can heal your body if you heal
[1:04:46] your gut. Yes.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Because sicknesses and diseases come
[1:04:50] through food.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; If you really want to
[1:04:56] cleanse your body of toxins and
[1:04:58] sicknesses, you need to fast.
[1:05:01] Fasting has healing properties.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; I know some of you feel like I'm telling
[1:05:10] you to die.
[1:05:12] I'm telling you to fast, not to die.
[1:05:14] Fasting will get rid of things in your
[1:05:17] body you never knew was there.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Esther said, "I'll fast three days
[1:05:24] and three nights." She was wanting to
[1:05:26] get rid of anything,
[1:05:29] any hindrances in the flesh.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to say, "Lord,
[1:05:35] I surrender this morning.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; I come, Lord, and I want to
[1:05:41] change my ways.
[1:05:43] I want to change my heart.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Let's sing. Change my heart. Oh God,
[1:05:47] from D. Amen.
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You believe he's the potter.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; We're just the clay.
[1:05:59] Change my heart, oh God,
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:06] and make it ever true.
[1:06:10] Make this your prayer. Change my heart.
[1:06:14] Change my heart. Oh God,
[1:06:19] make this person now. May I be like you.
[1:06:21] May I be like you.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Sing it again. Change my heart.
[1:06:28] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:35] Make it ever true.
[1:06:42] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:06:46] May I be like you.
[1:06:49] May I be like you.
[1:06:53] Sing. You are the potter.
[1:06:56] Oh, you are the potter.
[1:07:01] I am the clay. I am. How many of you are
[1:07:05] molded, broken this morning?
[1:07:10] Mold me and make
[1:07:13] me.
[1:07:16] This is what I pray.
[1:07:22] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:07:29] Make it ever true.
[1:07:35] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:42] May I be like you. One more time. You
[1:07:46] are the potter.
[1:07:49] You are the potter.
[1:07:55] I am the way.
[1:08:02] Hold me and make
[1:08:05] me.
[1:08:08] This is what I pray.
[1:08:14] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:21] Make it ever true. It's the need of the
[1:08:24] change of hearts.
[1:08:27] Change my heart. Malachi 4 has come to
[1:08:31] turn your hearts
[1:08:34] and may be.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; While the music is playing, I want you
[1:08:37] to talk to the Lord. Amen. If you need
[1:08:39] to make yourself right to the Lord, you
[1:08:40] can go ahead and just talk to him. If
[1:08:42] you want to thank the Lord, thank him.
[1:08:44] Thank you for favor that surrounds you
[1:08:45] like his shield. Thank him. Amen. For
[1:08:47] his goodness. Thank him for his mercy.
[1:08:50] Amen. I want everyone to start to pray
[1:08:51] now. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. This is a
[1:08:55] time for you to worship. The prophet is
[1:08:56] after the preaching of the word through
[1:08:58] worship follows. Amen. Hallelujah. God
[1:09:01] is waiting on you now to hear from you.
[1:09:05] Be on speaking terms with God.
[1:09:10] Oh, tell him how much you love him. Tell
[1:09:12] him how much you appreciate him. Tell
[1:09:15] him how much Amen. Oh, it means the
[1:09:17] world to you.
[1:09:21] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:09:25] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:09:27] Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's just
[1:09:30] drop the music. Drop the music. Amen.
[1:09:33] There's a resentful spirit here. People
[1:09:35] don't want to surrender. I want you to
[1:09:37] open up your mouths. Start to pray.
[1:09:39] Amen. Pray. Pray. Pray. Break free in
[1:09:42] the spirit. The flesh shadow is
[1:09:44] resisting the words you heard.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that the enemy comes in to
[1:09:51] take away the word that was sown. Don't
[1:09:53] allow the enemy to work right now.
[1:09:55] Say, Lord, be it according to me,
[1:09:57] according to thy word. Be done unto me
[1:09:59] according to thy word, oh God. Lord,
[1:10:02] where I need molding, mold me. Where I
[1:10:03] need shaping, shape me, oh God. Father,
[1:10:06] I don't want to miss the rapture. I
[1:10:07] don't want to miss, Lord, thy presence,
[1:10:09] the purpose of the ministry. Oh God, I
[1:10:12] want to get in you. Oh God, I know,
[1:10:14] Father, I can't get into shakana glory
[1:10:16] if I don't consecrate my life. I can't
[1:10:18] get into shakana glory without praying
[1:10:20] and fasting. I can't get into the
[1:10:22] presence of the king without a
[1:10:24] consecrated life. That's my desire is to
[1:10:28] be hallelujah. Walk in your presence.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Speaking in your word, God speaking your
[1:10:35] word in spirit and in truth. Thank you,
[1:10:38] Father. That's our desire this morning.
[1:10:40] That's our need this morning, Lord. We
[1:10:42] need to let go, Lord. Let me have your
[1:10:44] wonderful way, God. Lord, if we have
[1:10:46] heard your word, Lord, that we may be
[1:10:48] thankful.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory, glory. Praise his
[1:10:51] name. Praise his name.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; And right now, I know the hungry are
[1:11:04] being filled. The thirsty are being
[1:11:07] filled right now. The desperate are
[1:11:09] being filled right now.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost, pour out to God. Oh,
[1:11:15] hallelujah.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] Lord, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[1:11:24] Lord,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; come Lord Jesus. Even so, come Lord
[1:11:27] Jesus. Use my feet, use my use my
[1:11:30] finances, everything, Lord, I
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; hear the cry, hear the cry, Lord, hear
[1:11:35] the cry, oh God, that you may use it for
[1:11:37] your
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; if my people who are called by my name,
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, to
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; will humble themselves and pray.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, I
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; will hear from heaven.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; I will come and I will heal their land.
[1:11:47] Amen.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, you said what will a prophet have
[1:11:50] to gain the
