[9:10] i'm if you know every day with jesus
[9:13] is sweeter than the day before
[9:15] hallelujah
[9:17] amen let's turn to our bibles in the
[9:19] book of uh ephesians
[9:22] amen
[9:26] amen
[9:27] we'll speak this morning on the love
[9:29] covenant
[9:30] between mr and mrs jesus christ
[9:33] the love covenant
[9:35] between mr and mrs jesus christ
[9:38] amen ephesians 2 and 4 says but god who
[9:42] is rich in mercy
[9:44] amen for his great love
[9:47] wherewith he loved us hallelujah now
[9:50] there's no ordinary love
[9:53] the bible says great love
[9:56] wherewith he loved us and you know
[9:58] there's a connecting scripture that says
[10:00] greater love at no man than he that
[10:02] would lay down his life
[10:05] amen
[10:07] we see adam in the garden of eden now he
[10:09] laid down he was prepared to lay down
[10:11] his life for eve
[10:13] and he was
[10:15] locking up a secret about god's great
[10:17] love for us so for his great love
[10:20] wherewith he loved us
[10:22] and he didn't love us when we were
[10:23] perfect yes he didn't love us when we
[10:26] were polished up
[10:27] born again filled with the holy ghost
[10:29] let's read why we loved us even when we
[10:31] were dead in sin
[10:34] and quickened us together with christ by
[10:37] grace are he saved and hath raised us up
[10:40] together and made us sit together in
[10:43] heavenly places in christ jesus the
[10:47] bride is not seated alone
[10:49] the bride is seated with a bright groom
[10:51] amen
[10:52] listen to 1 john 4 16
[10:56] amen 1 john 4 16 hallelujah
[11:00] amen
[11:05] thank god for his greatness and his
[11:06] mercy amen
[11:09] yes amen
[11:10] 1 john 4 16
[11:12] amen
[11:16] and we have known and believed the love
[11:18] that god had to us
[11:21] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[11:25] dwelleth in god and god in him amen
[11:28] [Music]
[11:29] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[11:32] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[11:36] because as he is so are we in this world
[11:40] so we are god's representative here in
[11:42] the world right
[11:44] there there is no fear in love
[11:48] but perfect love casted out fear
[11:51] because fear had torment
[11:54] here that feareth is not made perfect in
[11:57] love
[11:58] we love him because he first loved us
[12:04] if a man say i have loved god and hated
[12:07] his brother
[12:08] he is a liar
[12:10] for he had not loved his brother whom he
[12:13] had seen how can he love god whom he had
[12:16] not seen
[12:18] and this commandment have we from him
[12:21] that he will love with god love his
[12:24] brother also
[12:26] now who is our brother
[12:29] is it just us
[12:31] in the message
[12:33] let's turn quickly brother caleb to
[12:34] genesis 4 9.
[12:36] now this you cannot dispute because we
[12:39] know that cain and abel did not come
[12:42] from the same father
[12:43] amen
[12:44] right but look at how god is addressing
[12:47] cain and the lord said unto cain where
[12:50] is abel thy brother
[12:52] amen
[12:53] is king serpent seed
[12:56] but god is saying where is
[12:59] abel thy brother and he said i know not
[13:02] am i my brother's keeper
[13:04] and again the lord is saying what hast
[13:06] thou done the voice of thy brother's
[13:08] blood cried unto me from the earth yes
[13:13] amen
[13:14] why
[13:15] all life comes from
[13:18] god is the giver of all life
[13:20] amen hallelujah so when we are
[13:22] projecting love
[13:24] it's not to be selective yes amen we are
[13:27] to love all men amen because even though
[13:30] the book of redemption is open to us and
[13:32] the seven seals are open to us how many
[13:34] of you have the lamb's book of life to
[13:36] see every name that's on the book
[13:38] amen
[13:39] we don't
[13:41] so we gotta preach the gospel
[13:43] and spread the gospel myth
[13:45] amen god add blessings to the reading of
[13:47] his word you may be seated amen
[13:50] so we're looking at the left covenant
[13:52] between mr and mrs jesus christ
[13:56] notice they are a married couple
[13:59] mr and mrs jesus christ
[14:01] now the bible is written on words
[14:05] the prophet says
[14:06] but the bible is a love story to the
[14:09] church
[14:10] amen
[14:12] the bible is a love story
[14:14] in fact it is the greatest love story
[14:20] brother brandon goes on to say love in
[14:22] his great bosom went out to adam's
[14:25] fallen race and redeemed them through
[14:27] his son christ jesus
[14:31] amen
[14:32] now
[14:34] he says that a covenant is a strange
[14:36] thing
[14:37] amen when we make a covenant with one
[14:40] another in our modern day we shake hands
[14:45] amen that's a covenant then he goes on
[14:48] to explain that in the eastern orients
[14:50] how they institute when they made a
[14:52] covenant they killed a beast
[14:55] and they split the beast open
[14:58] and they stood between the dead beast
[15:01] and they wrote out their covenant
[15:04] i hereby say a certain certain thing
[15:07] then they take this agreement and they
[15:10] tear it
[15:12] into two pieces
[15:14] one piece is given to one man and the
[15:16] other piece is given to another man
[15:18] i know you're thinking about the chinese
[15:20] laundry man right now but this is
[15:21] brother brandon is giving us another
[15:23] illustration
[15:24] right he's talking about how you kill a
[15:26] beast and in the midst of the blood you
[15:28] ride out the covenant you tear it you
[15:31] give one to one man and you keep the
[15:32] other part
[15:34] so he says they take an oath over this
[15:37] dead beast
[15:38] to say let my body be as this dead beast
[15:41] if i don't keep this covenant
[15:45] now god was then in spirit
[15:47] how could god tear the spirit apart he
[15:50] couldn't but one day god was made flesh
[15:53] and dwelt amongst us
[15:55] amen the lord jesus christ emmanuel and
[15:58] then there calvary the covenant wrote
[16:01] with us amen with jesus own blood
[16:05] he took christ to calvary and tore him
[16:08] apart
[16:09] soul and body and he took his body and
[16:12] set it at the right hand of his majesty
[16:14] and sent the spirit on the earth to make
[16:18] a covenant to carry out the gospel
[16:22] amen
[16:23] so he goes on to say here that he's the
[16:26] same yesterday today and forever and the
[16:28] church is given a covenant
[16:31] and that covenant he says is the baptism
[16:34] of the holy ghost
[16:38] which is the seed of abraham bringing to
[16:41] us and god is making this covenant that
[16:44] every man that's called into the grace
[16:46] of god
[16:48] by the holy ghost
[16:51] amen we are called into this message by
[16:54] the grace of god
[16:56] through the holy spirit
[16:58] amen sometimes we wonder i don't know
[17:00] why jesus loved me
[17:03] i don't know how my lord god chose me
[17:06] but i'm thankful anyway
[17:08] but i'm only in this message by grace
[17:12] amen it's not him that willeth or him
[17:15] that runeth but it's god that showed
[17:17] mercy
[17:19] amen
[17:20] then he says amen
[17:24] you can have a piece of paper that just
[17:26] impersonates it so you can have a
[17:28] portion of that paper
[17:30] a portion of the holy spirit to
[17:32] impersonate the holy spirit that's what
[17:34] he's trying to convey
[17:36] but he says the same spirit that was on
[17:38] jesus christ has come back on his church
[17:41] doing the same signs the same wonders
[17:44] the same holy ghost the same power
[17:47] it's the covenant that god has given to
[17:49] them
[17:50] and jesus died in the evening time when
[17:52] the sun was going down confirming this
[17:55] covenant and the holy ghost is on the
[17:57] church tonight leading the church just
[18:00] like he did when he was here he was
[18:02] leading christ the same way
[18:05] the same ministry christ had is in his
[18:08] church tonight
[18:10] when jesus christ was on the earth the
[18:12] holy ghost could not be split into many
[18:14] member bodies
[18:16] the holy ghost tabernacled jesus alone
[18:19] he was the fullness of the goddess
[18:21] bodily
[18:23] amen there was none of the disciples
[18:25] that could receive the holy ghost when
[18:27] jesus was around
[18:29] and jesus commissioned him when he was
[18:31] going away stop preaching
[18:35] go to the upper room
[18:38] but for now stop preaching
[18:40] get to the upper room
[18:42] until you endure with power from one eye
[18:46] amen hallelujah sometimes that's what we
[18:49] need to do
[18:50] get away with god amen amen that's what
[18:53] we are searching after we
[18:57] in the backside of the desert and we
[18:59] know without a shadow of a doubt that no
[19:02] scoffer can shake us away from
[19:04] present-day truth and present-day
[19:06] reality
[19:08] [Music]
[19:16] amen
[19:19] hallelujah
[19:20] what is it it's
[19:22] our time it's true time
[19:24] amen they are just displaying what's on
[19:26] the inside of them
[19:28] amen hallelujah
[19:30] amen is lamb trimming time what are they
[19:33] doing when they are saying about the
[19:35] cloud about the pillar of fire they are
[19:37] telling you i have no oil in my lamp
[19:40] [Music]
[19:41] amen how do you see that
[19:44] give me some of your oil not so
[19:47] amen
[19:49] go to smiley joel and go to tv snakes
[19:52] amen and buy from them
[19:56] amen
[19:59] hallelujah amen
[20:01] so he says here in 113 now watch what
[20:04] how the devil tries to got the
[20:05] pentecostal people he says pentecostal
[20:08] people don't you see that you
[20:12] these others can't believe in that
[20:14] there's nothing in them to believe with
[20:16] but the trouble of it you've got it i
[20:19] want to say this morning message people
[20:21] you've got it
[20:24] amen and don't know it
[20:28] if the devil if you can't get it he can
[20:30] hide it from you and let not let you
[20:33] know you've got it he's got you licked
[20:35] [Music]
[20:36] see you can't fail
[20:39] hello
[20:40] you cannot fail
[20:42] jesus christ took of your care of your
[20:44] sins past present and future
[20:49] hallelujah did you hear what is here
[20:51] there's nothing you can do that can
[20:54] separate you from the love of god
[20:56] because jesus knew you your end your
[20:59] beginning to your end
[21:01] and he took care of the sin question
[21:04] amen as long as we have faith in the
[21:06] lord jesus christ
[21:07] you believe in his blood amen that
[21:10] cleanses us from our sin
[21:12] you keep walking with god amen
[21:15] hallelujah there's no way of failing
[21:19] you're abraham's seed god is sworn with
[21:21] an oath he takes you in
[21:24] there you are he's made his covenant
[21:26] hallelujah jesus christ he's his
[21:29] covenant he tore him apart at calvary
[21:32] received the body up and sent the holy
[21:34] ghost and when the resurrection come the
[21:37] same spirit that was in jesus christ is
[21:39] the only thing that will raise the body
[21:41] up to go to meet that one there
[21:45] that makes them husband and wife you see
[21:48] what i mean
[21:49] the bride is a covenant people
[21:52] unconditionally
[21:53] yes amen you are the only people that
[21:55] carry a
[21:57] a man like abraham one man alone in his
[22:01] generation had a covenant
[22:03] he had i will covenant
[22:06] you are the only people in this age that
[22:08] carries a covenant
[22:10] it's a love covenant
[22:12] amen
[22:14] you may say it's a blood covenant the
[22:16] love covenant made a way for the blood
[22:18] covenant
[22:20] amen
[22:22] the bride is a covenant people
[22:24] unconditionally god called you out of
[22:26] the world gave you the holy ghost the
[22:29] seed of abraham you are tonight
[22:31] with a blessed promise that if you are
[22:34] abraham's seed you have this promise in
[22:36] you you believe god regardless what
[22:39] takes place the holy ghost makes you
[22:41] believe it anyhow
[22:43] the spirit was upon christ is upon the
[22:46] church because there's the bride and the
[22:48] groom
[22:49] a little while and the world me no
[22:51] more yet you shall see me for i'll be
[22:54] with you even in you to the end of the
[22:57] world
[22:58] the spirit and the body is taken up
[23:02] now he says if that same spirit that was
[23:04] in christ has to be new or it won't
[23:07] compare with this covenant
[23:09] he says aren't you happy tonight that
[23:11] you're baptized into the church of the
[23:13] first born of the living god that the
[23:15] very spirit that was in in christ is in
[23:18] the church tonight
[23:20] and you are a part
[23:22] of it by the holy ghost being dead in
[23:24] christ
[23:25] take on abraham's seed
[23:27] and that is according to the promise he
[23:29] says what are you scared about all
[23:31] devils in hell couldn't shake you
[23:33] nothing can shake you we receive a
[23:36] kingdom that cannot be shaken
[23:40] now there's a difference between
[23:41] covenant love
[23:44] covenant love is what a person
[23:45] experiences
[23:47] as he enters into a relationship with
[23:49] god we call it in our human way of
[23:52] saying it unconditional love
[23:54] but it is god's covenant love
[23:57] there's a difference between a contract
[24:00] and a relationship
[24:03] amen
[24:04] there's a difference between a contract
[24:06] and a covenant
[24:08] a contract is a mutually beneficial
[24:11] relationship while a covenant is
[24:14] something you fulfill
[24:17] a contract is legally binding
[24:21] amen
[24:22] that's what the law was
[24:24] god's contract with man
[24:26] it was legally binding
[24:29] if you disobeyed what was in the
[24:31] contract you were doomed
[24:34] you could experience the wrath of god
[24:36] but aren't you glad for the love
[24:38] covenant
[24:39] the grace covenant amen
[24:42] so a contract exchanges one good for
[24:45] another while a covenant is giving
[24:47] oneself to the other
[24:50] so even in a marriage contract we don't
[24:53] focus too much on the marriage
[24:55] certificate itself
[24:57] even though some of us study day and
[24:59] night looking for the expiration date
[25:05] amen
[25:07] when love projects
[25:10] amen it overtakes every contract
[25:14] even if you're sad you know
[25:16] because of business and things like this
[25:18] people sign a
[25:20] what they call it lawyers help me
[25:23] what do they sign
[25:25] the lawyers don't want to help me
[25:28] a prenuptial
[25:31] what's it called
[25:32] anti-nuptial contract
[25:36] hey
[25:38] an anti-nuptial contract
[25:40] i think that's why they named themselves
[25:42] a and c
[25:45] they do not serve the people
[25:50] but a and c
[25:52] what is that
[25:54] that is not in it yes you sign it for
[25:56] the legal purposes
[25:58] but the law
[26:00] the love covenant in your relationship
[26:03] overrides every contract
[26:05] you are not focused and take this
[26:07] contract to your wife every time she
[26:09] displeases you
[26:11] look here missus
[26:12] what we signed
[26:15] how many of us do that
[26:17] we don't concentrate on the living law
[26:20] but love projects
[26:22] through that relationship
[26:25] amen when god is speaking to his prophet
[26:29] and he's blasting these denominational
[26:31] people for rejecting the word that is
[26:34] not directed to you his bride
[26:40] because you have not rejected him
[26:43] you have opened up the door
[26:45] amen and you have opened up and you have
[26:47] received his word into your heart
[26:50] amen what kind of a marriage will it be
[26:54] if the husband is constantly rebuking
[26:56] his wife
[27:00] amen
[27:02] oh we're gonna get lots of amens now
[27:06] what kind of a marriage will it be if
[27:08] the wife is constantly bickering
[27:11] nagging
[27:14] but love
[27:16] covers a multitude of sin amen amen even
[27:20] though the wife is terribly angry with
[27:22] you
[27:23] because she asked you to do something
[27:25] three weeks ago
[27:27] but she still makes your favorite meal
[27:31] she still treats you kind she still
[27:33] loves you
[27:34] amen
[27:36] even though when you fight she reminds
[27:38] you of what you did five years ago
[27:43] amen
[27:45] but love covers a multitude of sin amen
[27:49] the strength to hold on to your part of
[27:52] the promise
[27:55] get divorced
[27:57] amen
[27:59] let's start the song of solomon
[28:01] chapter 8 and verse 6.
[28:04] chapter 8 and verse 6 says set me as a
[28:07] strong heart now some of us may be able
[28:10] to understand that
[28:12] we know how strong death can be
[28:16] right
[28:18] he says love is as strong as death
[28:22] jealousy is cruel
[28:24] as the grave
[28:28] the calls thereof are called the fire
[28:30] which has a most vehement flame
[28:34] many waters cannot quench love
[28:37] neither can floods drown it
[28:40] if a man would give all his substance of
[28:43] his house for love
[28:44] it will be utterly content
[28:48] amen
[28:52] now god's covenant towards us is love
[28:54] covenant
[28:56] we know that in ephesians
[28:58] if we go to ephesians chapter 5
[29:00] amen let's go there quickly
[29:03] ephesians chapter 5
[29:05] as we take off in our sermon now amen
[29:08] ephesians chapter 5
[29:10] he's telling us that christ is the head
[29:12] of the church right we know all of that
[29:14] we want to get to verse 25
[29:16] he says husbands love your wives even as
[29:19] christ also loved the church and gave
[29:23] himself for it
[29:26] that he might sanctify it and cleanse it
[29:28] with the washing of water by the word
[29:31] that he might present it to himself a
[29:34] glorious shirt not having spot or
[29:37] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[29:40] should be holy and without blemish so
[29:43] are meant to love their wives as their
[29:45] own bodies
[29:46] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[29:51] for no man ever hated his own flesh but
[29:54] nourish it
[29:55] and cherished it even as the lord of the
[29:58] church
[30:00] amen
[30:02] now when a young man and a young girl
[30:05] a young couple
[30:06] they fall in love with one another
[30:09] there is a mutual attraction
[30:12] they fall in love with one another amen
[30:14] they begin to get to know one another
[30:16] more
[30:18] amen the prophet says their hearts start
[30:20] to beat as one
[30:23] amen
[30:26] i know some of you going back in memory
[30:27] like trying to go back and
[30:29] remember that feeling
[30:32] you want to sing that song when i
[30:33] remember
[30:37] amen
[30:39] they fall in love
[30:40] their hearts beat as one
[30:42] they want to know more about one another
[30:46] amen but they're not husband and wife
[30:48] yet
[30:49] but their love binds them together they
[30:51] have confidence in one another
[30:55] now if they really have confidence in
[30:57] one another you have faith in one
[30:59] another then they get married if you
[31:01] didn't have confidence in one another
[31:03] you'd better not marry her
[31:06] so very important you must have
[31:08] confidence in the woman that you are
[31:10] marrying
[31:12] you gotta have faith in her
[31:14] and here he says in the message perfect
[31:16] faith you can separate them
[31:18] put one extreme south one extreme north
[31:22] but that's
[31:24] still the love beats for one another
[31:26] no matter where they're at
[31:29] they're just as true to one another as
[31:31] they can be because they love one
[31:33] another
[31:34] and if you love the lord
[31:36] just not trying to dodge hell but you
[31:39] love the lord then you have faith in god
[31:44] amen
[31:46] so here's this young couple
[31:48] they meet one another
[31:51] the circumstances doesn't seem conducive
[31:54] for them to meet
[31:55] amen
[31:56] this is a man who is ready to get
[31:58] married
[32:00] and his father is looking for a bride
[32:03] for him
[32:06] now he owns a ranch and he owns oil
[32:09] wells he's a rich wealthy man
[32:12] he owned the kettle on a thousand heels
[32:15] amen
[32:17] his riches are unmeasurable
[32:19] immeasurable
[32:21] amen
[32:23] but they came one day to this little
[32:25] ranch
[32:27] and he came looking for a wife for his
[32:30] son
[32:31] now all the girls in the ranch got
[32:33] excited because this man came
[32:37] all the churches got excited
[32:41] amen they want you to attract the
[32:43] attention of this young man
[32:46] so they dressed up in their western
[32:48] outfits
[32:49] now you would know how the western
[32:51] outfits were
[32:52] amen you you women will probably know
[32:55] better
[32:57] this thing was nice and like whoa what
[32:59] they call it
[33:01] ballroom gowns
[33:03] they had the best designer clothes made
[33:08] amen but there was in this ranch a
[33:11] little cousin
[33:15] and she was an orphan
[33:18] she just done all the work for these
[33:20] other girls
[33:24] because they had to have their
[33:25] fingernails fixed
[33:27] and they didn't want to wash the dishes
[33:30] so she did the real hard work
[33:35] there's only one wife in this end time
[33:37] one woman who's doing the real true
[33:39] commission
[33:40] doing the real hard work
[33:42] the rest are in it further
[33:47] amen
[33:49] and finally when the sun came they went
[33:51] out and got an old western way shooting
[33:54] guns and carrying on and that night they
[33:56] had a great big dance
[33:57] this went on for two or three days then
[34:00] one night the boy stepped out of the
[34:02] place
[34:04] he went to rest a while from the dance
[34:07] from all the noise of the worship
[34:11] and this one girl kind of ragged looking
[34:13] she had a dish pan full of water she
[34:15] washed the dishes and he said i i don't
[34:18] think i've seen this girl before
[34:21] and he wonder where she comes from
[34:23] so he he tries to make his way towards
[34:26] her he sneaks out the back way and he
[34:28] gets down to where she was
[34:30] she was barefooted she stopped she held
[34:33] her head down
[34:35] she seen who it was and she was very shy
[34:38] she knew this great person and she was
[34:40] just the cousin to these other girls
[34:42] their father was the foreman on this big
[34:45] armor outfit she kept looking down she
[34:47] was ashamed of being barefooted
[34:51] he said what's your name she told him
[34:53] says why aren't you why ain't you out
[34:56] there where the rest of them and she
[34:58] kind of made excuses
[35:00] so the next night he watched fuller
[35:02] again
[35:05] god is watching your character
[35:08] amen god's not looking for flirters
[35:10] god's looking for real
[35:13] what you're carrying on everything
[35:28] amen he says i find a character in you
[35:32] that they don't have
[35:35] amen
[35:36] god don't waste time
[35:40] when he finds a character
[35:42] amen he asked the question
[35:46] amen
[35:47] all the young guys are paying attention
[35:49] here
[35:52] otherwise you're too slow
[35:54] you're what brother john smith
[36:00] brother branham he says i didn't know
[36:02] who brother branham was i went straight
[36:03] up to the father and i spoke to him and
[36:05] i asked him
[36:08] what they say you snooze you
[36:10] lose
[36:12] he says i find character in you that
[36:14] they don't have will you marry me she
[36:16] said i can't think of such a thing me
[36:20] said yes
[36:21] i couldn't find one in
[36:24] chicago i want a real life
[36:27] i want your wife with my character
[36:30] and the thing that i'm looking for i see
[36:33] it in you
[36:38] i'll get you and take you away from you
[36:40] you won't have to work like this no more
[36:42] i'll take you i'll go to chicago i'll
[36:45] build your home like you've never seen
[36:47] sounds familiar
[36:49] say john 14.
[36:51] she said i never had a home i'm a orphan
[36:54] he said i'll build your home a real one
[36:56] i'll be back
[36:58] now listen what he says he kept in track
[37:01] with him
[37:02] when did jesus make the promise before
[37:04] his ascension how did he keep in
[37:06] interact with us through seven
[37:08] messengers
[37:12] each one giving a word of warning to her
[37:15] and vanishing up
[37:18] amen
[37:20] it says he kept in track with her during
[37:22] the time a year she worked everything
[37:24] that she could saved enough money
[37:27] so
[37:28] what's his faith expressed
[37:31] if she really believed that he was
[37:33] coming back for her she had to get ready
[37:36] and
[37:37] herself
[37:44] it's ready and you know when she just
[37:45] played the wedding garment
[37:47] a cousin said why you poor silly kid you
[37:50] mean to think a man like that would have
[37:53] anything to do with you
[37:55] she said but he promised me
[37:57] that's where the church is standing this
[37:59] morning
[38:01] but he promised me he's coming back amen
[38:04] he promised me i believe his word
[38:07] oh it's just making a fool of you
[38:09] there's no literal coming of the lord
[38:11] jesus christ
[38:16] [Music]
[38:18] others believe that they have another
[38:19] gospel the seven pillars you must have
[38:21] heard about the seven pillars
[38:23] that you need to take
[38:25] strategic positions on the earth because
[38:28] when god sets up his kingdom on the
[38:30] earth you must have an influence over
[38:32] governments
[38:34] over the in the medical field
[38:36] in every high ranking field
[38:39] christians must go and study
[38:41] and become great intellectual people in
[38:43] the world so then when christ come back
[38:45] you can rule and reign with him sure
[38:50] if he'd have got somebody he would have
[38:53] got one of us
[38:57] with our fine polish buildings
[39:07] he will take us
[39:09] that's what
[39:10] looking for it
[39:14] amen
[39:15] people are not looking forward to it
[39:18] amen the apostle paul says looking for
[39:20] that blessed hope and glorious appearing
[39:23] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[39:27] what are you looking for
[39:29] amen are you looking for your name
[39:30] looking for
[39:32] and that will be preparing for the
[39:34] coming of our great and
[39:36] amen our great king who loves us
[39:42] he says so kept getting later and later
[39:45] the day finally arrived certain hour he
[39:47] was to beer so she dressed in a garment
[39:50] and that's where the bride
[39:52] don't like it
[39:54] amen why are you wearing your so hi
[40:03] look at
[40:07] seeds of discrepancy
[40:10] the invisible union of the bride
[40:15] amen
[40:17] the rapture things that are to be
[40:20] what kind of garment is this
[40:25] you don't have anything like seven steps
[40:31] we got it it's called statue of a
[40:33] perfect man
[40:34] but i don't like that one
[40:37] that one is not telling me any money
[40:39] better for them
[40:43] we got seven steps as well
[40:47] but they don't want it
[40:49] amen so she's dressed
[40:51] in the wedding clothes got things ready
[40:54] but they really did laugh there the
[40:56] girls heard nothing about it so it just
[40:58] was all mysterious thing to them
[41:02] can you see what he's saying
[41:06] he says it's a mysterious thing to them
[41:12] but this girl just in the face of all of
[41:14] it upon the basis of his word that he
[41:17] would be back for her they got you
[41:19] laughing they put their hands around one
[41:21] another and dancing
[41:24] you know poor little silly kid she just
[41:27] stood there not a bit of blush in her
[41:29] she was holding her flowers
[41:33] are you holding your flowers
[41:35] you got your bouquet
[41:38] you got your wedding dress on
[41:40] you got your bouquet
[41:42] now some of you are visually
[41:44] imagining this
[41:46] and it sounds
[41:48] laughable to you as well
[41:50] that the bride is dressed in the
[41:52] garments of the world
[41:55] for transportation
[41:56] [Music]
[41:58] the driver is not late
[42:00] wait
[42:14] the first part of
[42:20] she didn't listen to them
[42:21] i got five more minutes
[42:24] he'll be here
[42:26] or they just laughed and about the time
[42:28] the old clock ticked up to five minutes
[42:31] they heard the horses galloping
[42:34] amen amen stand rolling under the wheels
[42:38] the old bug board stopped the party
[42:40] stopped
[42:42] she jumped from between there
[42:45] amen
[42:46] out the door she went
[42:49] amen and she jumped out of the carriage
[42:52] and flew into his eyes
[42:55] go home the prophet says i know of
[42:57] another great promise like that i've
[42:59] gone to prepare a place for you coming
[43:01] back to receive
[43:03] he's saying
[43:06] now this time ticks away into eternity
[43:09] there i can almost see the angel
[43:11] standing there with his hands raised to
[43:14] the heavens amen
[43:19] shall be of these days be taken to the
[43:22] father's house let us think of these
[43:24] things as we go along now
[43:27] amen
[43:28] hallelujah
[43:30] now we said wouldn't jesus take one of
[43:32] these fine churches
[43:34] polish programs
[43:37] he goes on to say here if you're the
[43:38] right kind of husband and jesus is the
[43:40] right kind of aspirin
[43:43] he says there is no woman in the world
[43:45] you would love like your wife
[43:48] now these are love secrets that the lord
[43:50] is whispering to us this
[43:52] morning we're talking for the brand
[43:55] maybe referencing a natural
[43:57] love between a man and a woman
[44:01] but it's a spiritual meaning
[44:04] there's no woman in the world that he
[44:06] loves like you there might be other
[44:08] women might be fairer they might be
[44:11] prettier and so forth if you really love
[44:13] your wife there's something in there you
[44:15] don't notice what she looks like you
[44:18] love her
[44:20] you don't know why but you love her and
[44:23] women
[44:31] that you know
[44:33] something in you you know you love them
[44:37] well that's the same thing it is about
[44:39] faith
[44:40] you know it's going to happen that's not
[44:42] a shadow no matter how many would say
[44:44] contrary you still believe the same
[44:46] thing because that's genuine real faith
[44:51] amen
[44:53] now when we're talking about the love
[44:55] covenant between mister and this is
[44:58] jesus christ
[45:00] now any love
[45:03] want to have fellowship
[45:06] you can't keep them apart
[45:10] so the caleb don't look like you don't
[45:12] understand what i'm saying
[45:16] you know what it was like hey
[45:19] you didn't worry about your friends
[45:21] anymore
[45:26] all you knew was when she calls me
[45:37] [Music]
[45:43] do you know the feeling i'm talking
[45:44] about in love do you know that's divine
[45:46] love
[45:47] it's one of god's attributes
[45:49] that you are expressing on the earth
[45:52] god placed that love there
[45:53] [Music]
[45:56] amen
[45:58] they want to have fellowship
[46:00] your friends are complaining you don't
[46:02] spend time with us anymore
[46:09] but now when you watch your friend the
[46:11] same friend who's complaining when he
[46:13] meet someone
[46:14] nobody like him
[46:16] okay
[46:19] he forgot about his friends
[46:25] and you waiting there now you're saying
[46:26] even if i'm a lone ranger
[46:28] i'll arrange alone
[46:31] but wait till you see her
[46:33] that one
[46:35] amen all the talk will be forgotten
[46:40] he says before now they want to have
[46:42] fellowship but before they can enter
[46:44] into any contract
[46:46] there's got to be an agreement to the
[46:48] fellowship
[46:50] and it's based upon their pledges to
[46:52] each other
[46:53] they enter into a lifelong fellowship
[46:56] but before they can enter into a
[46:58] friendship there has to be an agreement
[47:00] first
[47:01] so
[47:02] he said all of that to say this when
[47:04] fellowship was broken between god and
[47:06] man there had to be some sort of
[47:08] agreement some sort of arrangement to
[47:12] restore again that lost fellowship
[47:14] and god found the plan
[47:16] it was through the blood of an innocent
[47:18] victim that god restored man back to
[47:21] fellowship with him again
[47:23] amen
[47:24] there have been many substitutes tried
[47:27] you'll find them in religions today they
[47:29] are called substitutes
[47:31] adam tried it we've tried to educate
[47:33] people we've tried all different forms
[47:36] but there's nothing that brings man back
[47:38] into fellowship with his maker but the
[47:40] blood of his son jesus christ
[47:44] it's the only appropriation god has is
[47:47] his blood
[47:49] an innocent victim died for a guilty
[47:51] person
[47:52] that brought fellowship back to god and
[47:55] man then adam covered by his blood could
[47:58] stand in the presence of god and worship
[48:00] again he says there's something about it
[48:02] when you speak of blood blood is life
[48:05] without the shedding of blood there's no
[48:07] remission of sin you can have everything
[48:09] in the world you can have any kind of
[48:11] thing you always wish to any object to
[48:14] worship any creed
[48:16] amen to live by
[48:18] but you can never come into fellowship
[48:21] divine fellowship with god until you
[48:23] first come under the blood
[48:25] that's god's holy and ordained provided
[48:28] way for human beings to fellowship with
[48:30] him through the blood of his son the
[48:33] lord jesus christ
[48:34] that was his plan it's still god's plan
[48:37] it will forever be god's plan amen no
[48:40] other plan but through the shedding of
[48:42] blood
[48:46] amen so people have lost sight of god's
[48:50] plan and he says that's what's the
[48:52] matter with some families around here
[48:54] and everywhere else
[48:56] we think we can roll
[48:58] the sea of life without jesus
[49:01] without being in god's plan
[49:04] he says but you'll find out there'll be
[49:05] trouble in the little bark before you
[49:07] get too far you can't stem the tides of
[49:10] life without christ
[49:14] young people establish this in your
[49:15] heart
[49:16] you can never go through life without
[49:18] jesus christ
[49:21] make it the central theme of your life
[49:24] the first thing in the morning
[49:26] the last thing in the
[49:28] night amen
[49:31] he says
[49:32] put you out somewhere
[49:34] and give you some disease or sickness or
[49:36] your backslid something like that but
[49:39] remember he planned the rampance of
[49:41] glory sitting on high his eye is on the
[49:44] sparrow and i know he watches me
[49:48] amen
[49:50] believe me
[49:51] if god affection he said to you this
[49:53] love covenant
[49:55] he's got his eye on you
[49:57] nothing can harm you
[50:00] amen without him knowing about it
[50:03] satan may want to test you satan may
[50:05] want to try you but he's got to ask god
[50:08] permission first
[50:13] he is from everlasting to everlasting
[50:15] god he steps up and he watches you
[50:18] he sees where you're at he knows we're
[50:21] having this meeting he knows how
[50:23] concerned each one of us about it he
[50:25] knows your interest in him he knows your
[50:28] interest in the kingdom he knows where
[50:30] your heart is so he watches over his
[50:32] word
[50:37] it
[50:38] says you don't know what a heritage you
[50:42] have we're talking about this word of
[50:44] god
[50:45] the message of the hour we don't know
[50:47] what an heritage we have he says protect
[50:50] this
[50:51] protect it
[50:52] don't let anything
[50:57] keep
[50:59] amen
[51:01] amen
[51:03] now are we in love with jesus
[51:05] do we keep in love with jesus
[51:11] let's see how brother branham brings it
[51:13] down to test if you are really jesus he
[51:16] says now in this
[51:21] [Music]
[51:23] so let me give you context he was
[51:25] talking about the children of israel and
[51:27] they were complaining about the manna
[51:30] they wanted the garlics of egypt
[51:34] right they didn't value their present
[51:36] day message so now he's saying in the
[51:38] modern day
[51:39] it would be the complaints would be oh
[51:42] every wednesday night
[51:44] prayer meeting
[51:47] every sunday morning back to the church
[51:51] what do we hear the same thing the
[51:53] preachers stand up and preach songs go
[51:55] on back
[51:56] see then you're just going as a line of
[51:59] duty you're not a worshipper
[52:04] let's not beat around the bush
[52:07] some of us are not worshipers yet
[52:10] you serve god in your own terms
[52:13] when it's convenient for you
[52:20] can you hear the horses coming
[52:25] you can hear the horses coming but you
[52:27] don't want to come into the house of the
[52:28] lord to worship him
[52:30] the horse is going to ride right past
[52:31] you
[52:33] you're gonna run after the chariot
[52:37] you're gonna be singing swing low speed
[52:38] chariot
[52:40] that shout it's not gonna swing low for
[52:41] nobody
[52:46] house of correction
[52:50] checking up time
[52:53] i'm tired you tired
[52:56] you think jesus wasn't tired on the
[52:58] cross after carrying the cross
[53:02] when chapter gold gathers here
[53:05] being crucified
[53:07] you're a pen pusher at work
[53:09] doing admin work doing light work not
[53:12] even a construction worker
[53:15] [Music]
[53:26] a worshiper goes there to worship to
[53:28] express himself i don't want to express
[53:30] myself
[53:38] let's all stand up
[53:41] let's all raise our hands
[54:08] a worshiper goes there to worship to
[54:11] express himself before his god to praise
[54:13] god for his goodness
[54:15] to every word he hangs on to it
[54:18] just like a love affair
[54:21] if you're going with a girl because you
[54:23] knew it was a duty
[54:25] or going with a boy when you were young
[54:27] mama wants me to go with this guy but i
[54:29] just can't stand it
[54:33] how many of you like to be in a
[54:34] relationship like that
[54:37] your mother is forcing you to let this
[54:38] girl
[54:42] or your mother is forcing the boy or the
[54:45] girl to like this boy
[54:48] that's how he is equating it when you
[54:50] don't want to come into the house of the
[54:51] lord
[54:52] your mother is forcing you and bringing
[54:54] you to church
[54:55] your father forcing you bringing you to
[54:57] church
[54:58] your husband forcing you and bringing
[55:00] you to church
[55:03] he says you don't get nothing of him
[55:06] coming to see you
[55:07] in fact
[55:11] you don't want to clean up so even when
[55:13] she comes around you don't want to clean
[55:15] yourself
[55:16] because you're not interested
[55:18] you don't want to go see her why it's a
[55:20] horrible thing
[55:22] and when he's coming to see you you just
[55:24] wish he would hurry on
[55:26] go home
[55:27] that's the same way it is when
[55:29] why does he preach so long
[55:33] what about all the stuff and everything
[55:35] see you're not in
[55:37] love
[55:42] when you really hang on to every word as
[55:44] the spirit gave you warning this morning
[55:47] that might be what he's been talking to
[55:49] you about
[55:50] holding on it's eternal life to every
[55:52] word of god it says
[55:54] to go to
[56:01] lord
[56:02] can somebody say a man this morning
[56:05] then you're in love with christ
[56:07] you love to go
[56:09] well honey
[56:10] sunday morning again
[56:14] and get
[56:25] got to get down with them
[56:27] and leave the people
[56:29] they don't bore you why they're your
[56:32] brothers and sisters
[56:33] amen you get a sticker short gun
[56:36] molasses on a cold morning you don't run
[56:39] it just stays together clings tight
[56:42] right he says you stick together the
[56:45] colder it gets the tighter they stick
[56:48] and that's the way it ought to be with
[56:50] us
[56:50] when earthly friends forsaken still more
[56:53] closely to him clean
[56:55] and what we love
[56:57] it's not because we're somebody
[56:59] but christ in one another that we love
[57:02] you see
[57:03] it's the god in our beings that we love
[57:06] we love to come together
[57:09] right so you can read now
[57:12] we know that part of the third pull was
[57:14] in an unknown language
[57:16] you remember
[57:18] he says one part went off in an unknown
[57:20] language
[57:22] but love is an unknown language
[57:28] remember he said it won't be a public
[57:30] show
[57:31] right if we read first corinthians 13
[57:34] and 1 i i'm going to read it because i
[57:36] know if i tell you to go read it at home
[57:39] some of the younger people won't go and
[57:41] read it at home
[57:42] so while they in church and i got the
[57:43] attention i speak with tons of men and
[57:46] angels some speak for tons of devils
[57:52] some got their own unknown language
[57:57] but he says though i speak with tongues
[57:59] of men and angels and have not love
[58:02] i am become a sounding brass or a
[58:05] tinkling symbol
[58:08] though i have gift of prophecy
[58:10] and i understand all mysteries
[58:12] and all knowledge and though i have all
[58:14] faith so that i can remove mountains
[58:17] that sounds like the bride right
[58:19] that has the ability to do all of this
[58:22] and have not love i am
[58:25] nothing
[58:27] though i bestow all my goods to feed the
[58:29] poor even charitable words now
[58:32] and though i give my body to be burned
[58:34] and martyred and have not love your
[58:37] prophet did me
[58:39] nothing
[58:41] what is love
[58:42] love suffered long
[58:44] is kind
[58:46] love envied not
[58:48] love wanted not itself is not puffed up
[58:52] does not behave itself unseemingly
[58:56] secret not our own is not easily
[58:58] provoked thinketh no evil rejoice it not
[59:02] in
[59:02] iniquity but rejoice it in the truth
[59:06] bear with all things believeth all
[59:08] things hope at all things endure with
[59:10] all things
[59:11] love never fail it
[59:13] where there be prophecies they shall
[59:15] fail
[59:16] where there be tongues they will seize
[59:18] where they be knowledge it will vanish
[59:20] away
[59:22] but we know that love will never fail
[59:24] that's the definition of true love
[59:27] and that's the love covenant between mr
[59:29] and this is jesus christ
[59:31] what is he doing
[59:36] lovers
[59:37] husbands and wives
[59:41] young boys and young girls when they
[59:43] have an attraction to each other they
[59:44] have an unknown language
[59:47] they have a love language
[59:49] you must have heard about the language
[59:50] of love
[59:52] some of you know you know your wife give
[59:53] you that one look
[59:55] you know exactly what she means
[59:59] it's the love language
[1:00:01] but did she say anything
[1:00:03] it's an unknown language
[1:00:08] yeah he says now
[1:00:11] so we know
[1:00:12] nobody else knows what this love secret
[1:00:14] is
[1:00:16] but he says god's great mystery
[1:00:20] what the eternal god had as a mystery
[1:00:22] has now been unfolded in jesus christ
[1:00:25] given down to his church what was once
[1:00:27] in god's mind is now in the body of
[1:00:30] christ
[1:00:33] jesus making love to the church
[1:00:36] his bride
[1:00:37] whispering secrets to her
[1:00:42] when you whisper to somebody nobody else
[1:00:44] can hear
[1:00:46] if they can hear you then you're not
[1:00:47] whispering
[1:00:50] he is whispering love secrets to you
[1:00:57] it's a whisper
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:02] remember particle third pool not a
[1:01:04] public show
[1:01:05] he's whispering love secrets to you
[1:01:07] he's telling you that you are a hidden
[1:01:09] mystery locked up in the back part of
[1:01:12] god's mind
[1:01:13] he's telling you just as how eve was
[1:01:16] taken out of adam's side
[1:01:18] you were taken out of the side of the
[1:01:20] lord jesus christ
[1:01:22] and he's telling you that even as i am
[1:01:24] in the father the father in me i in you
[1:01:27] and you in me
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:32] you see
[1:01:33] you know how you tell your wife things
[1:01:35] you know the little girl you're going to
[1:01:37] marry you love her so much you just tell
[1:01:39] her the secrets get up next to you and
[1:01:42] love you and everything you know how it
[1:01:44] is that's what god christ is doing to
[1:01:46] the church
[1:01:47] he is letting her know the secrets
[1:01:50] marriage and divorce
[1:01:52] who is this malteser
[1:01:56] letting you know the secrets
[1:01:59] just the secrets
[1:02:01] not the flutters
[1:02:03] i mean his wife
[1:02:04] knows by having the revelation of his
[1:02:07] secret made known to them by his grace
[1:02:10] how is the sikh revelation of his secret
[1:02:12] made known
[1:02:13] by his grace
[1:02:15] how the grace of god
[1:02:20] now let's close with this
[1:02:22] god requires our response to his love
[1:02:25] covenant
[1:02:28] right
[1:02:29] he says if god when i was an alien from
[1:02:31] him so loved me till he stooped down to
[1:02:34] get me and pick me up
[1:02:36] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:02:38] to use me
[1:02:42] he's got a purpose in doing it
[1:02:45] he has seen something in me
[1:02:48] god seen something in you
[1:02:52] he has a reason to save you
[1:02:55] look at the people that's unsafe today
[1:02:58] look at the millions you could have took
[1:03:00] beside you but he took you
[1:03:03] the prophet says amen
[1:03:07] can you say amen he took you
[1:03:11] no one can take your place
[1:03:16] in god's economy
[1:03:17] no one can do it that is love to you
[1:03:22] no one can take your place
[1:03:24] you're in god's economy
[1:03:26] no one can do it that's love god's love
[1:03:29] covenant
[1:03:31] then won't you love write reach
[1:03:34] won't you love reach right back to him
[1:03:38] and there's a love affair no matter what
[1:03:41] the situation is it's circumstances
[1:03:44] by this love that creates faith that god
[1:03:47] loves you and you love god
[1:03:50] mister and this is jesus christ
[1:03:52] in a love relationship amen
[1:03:55] you love one another and that brings the
[1:03:57] faith
[1:03:59] it can't keep from bringing out just
[1:04:01] exactly what god promised he would do
[1:04:04] perfect faith is pure just as perfect
[1:04:07] love is now when you love somebody you
[1:04:10] love your husband or you love your wife

[1:05:36] the law part of the message
[1:05:39] the written contract

[1:06:01] you love jesus christ
[1:06:03] that's your response back to god for his
[1:06:06] love to you and i
[1:06:09] now when we can accept that love
[1:06:11] covenant
