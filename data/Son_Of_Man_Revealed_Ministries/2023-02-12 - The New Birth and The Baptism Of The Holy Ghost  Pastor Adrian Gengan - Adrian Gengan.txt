don't always walk down to valleys we walk up mountains as well amen Hallelujah but through every step of the way he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you I will be with you I will be even in you amen hallelujah amen welcome our sister Raj ready this morning [Music] [Applause] may you be blessed in the house of the Lord to heal at home amen hallelujah amen this morning in return I was attention to the scriptures amen just speak a little thought this amen the spirit is moving in a way and I think it's needful for us to speak on a few things Amen to re-examine our lives we'll speak this morning on the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so let's turn to our scripture reading let's start off and we all know the famous scripture of John chapter 3. and let's start then amen my aim and attention is to capture every one of us and to see where we are in the walk with God let's not assume amen let's not assume things let's look into the word and see how the Holy Ghost was moving and what's the expectation of the Holy Ghost and what he is coming to do and our part what we need to do amen so John chapter 3 says and you know this is a scripture dealing with you must be born again so there was a man of the Pharisee his name Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him and Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so there's our first key we must be born again Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born again when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God pay attention to that verse now because there's two baptisms there amen amen one is the baptism of water and all of us most all of us in this church have gone through baptism of water but there's another baptism that's required and it's of the spirit amen and without that he says he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit amen Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth Wade listed and thou hear us a sound thereof and cannot tell when to cometh where they go is so is everyone that is born of the spirit amen and then we'll go Amen to our next scripture let's turn to the book of Acts so I said pay attention to the one scripture where our lord Jesus was telling us that we need to be born of water and a spirit but can we be in the church and only have one baptism amen it is possible for us to be in the church and have only experienced the baptism of water like we're going to read in the scripture now it says now when the apostles which were Jerusalem uh that to Mary had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who then when they will come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost now watch this next verse it says for us yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus amen then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost amen right now this morning's message will be for us to examine our lives and no one should feel ashamed or condemned if we find ourselves in a position where we say I've only received the water baptism amen amen the spirit wants to help you to be baptized in the Holy Ghost amen amen and let's read Acts chapter 10. because this was an important Revelation that was unlocked to the first church the Jews just thought we became Christians the apostles thought that it was only for the Jews but yet God unlocks a revelation to them and tell them the Holy Ghost is for the Gentiles as well we're going to pick it up from verse 44 where while Peter yet speak amen the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word amen this morning you're going to hear the word of God and if you can receive the holy ghost from Fall while the word of God is being spoken this morning amen Beyond expectation this morning amen amen and they are the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost if we did it for those Gentiles he can do it for us for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God now we know those are gifts of the Holy ghosts taking it straight to the water baptism amen that he should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we so it's also possible for you to receive the Holy Ghost and not gone through water baptism and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then he prayed they him to tarry certain days one was scripture before you seated and many maybe you're young and you don't know the scripture you're asking how can I be found in the body of Christ First Corinthians 12 and verse 13. very familiar scripture in fact you should buy after amen this is one scripture you should buy heart you'll find the prophet Time and Time and Again recite the scripture he says for one by one spirit are we all baptized into the body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have we all been made to drink into one spirit amen you may be seated may the Lord and blessings to the reading of his word amen Hallelujah I'd like to start out with a question and we can all examine ourselves and ask ourselves why did we come to church if you had to think quickly ask yourself why did you come to church amen some might say I came to the resurrection some might say I came because my parents brought me they won't let me stay at home [Music] some may say I came to worship God some may say I came to hear the word of God amen I came in obedience to the word that says forsake not be ascending together of ourselves some may say I'm seeking a closer walk with God some may say I need a touch from Jesus I need healing now we may have come for various reasons some may have hidden agendas why they came amen you know the prophecy some come just to find faults and now the idea like a CCTV camera waiting some are like voice recorders waiting amen but everyone that came into the house of God this morning will God receiving exactly what you came for yes you go out receiving what you expected from the service because we get what we expect and if we expect nothing will God having received nothing right so there's one thing for sure that all of us will leave this place either better off or we leave this place worst off will either be filled with his presence with his anointing or we are going to leave this place first off and it says yes for demon foreign [Music] Tabernacle for the devil question and answers amen how many of you want to go to heaven I want to see Hands how many of you want to go to heaven well everybody wants to go to heaven amen Hallelujah we all want to go to heaven isn't it now we can't go to heaven relying on our first birth amen we must be born again amen amen God has provided a way for us to get to heaven but it that way begins on the Earth don't think when you die suddenly God's gonna make all things right and take you to heaven we have choices to make like they say the ball is in your court you try to keep the ball away from the and the Holy Ghost trying to kick it back to you you keep kicking away keep kicking it back in your court right amen and we can either come the hard way or we can come the easy way that's right if you choose to come the hard way you're going to pay great prices on Earth amen you're going to go through trials and situations yes but the Holy Spirit desires surrender amen now you cannot join a particular Church to get to heaven denomination thing join our church to get to heaven you'll find even something a message saying come to our church and this is happening you'll go to heaven it's by one Spirit we are born into the body as an individual there's no individual rupture for you God's going to empty our breath the sixth Dimension bring that body of Believers to meet with this body of Believers and as one body we are going to be Resurrected so stop walking with your nose in the air I'm thinking you're the only one saved more amen God's not going to Rapture the tall only see how you can call me the tone nothing wrong with the toe you're still thickly framed in the body David said I'd rather be a door mat in the house of the Lord amen amen hallelujah now you cannot join we said by joining Church you cannot enroll in the best Bible school to get to heaven amen you have to get to heaven amen please don't encounter experience and you must be born again now in the Nashville our parents can enroll Us in the best school sometimes they fight to get us into the best school sometimes they fight to get us for the best subjects they get you the best uniform they want the best teachers for you but after you get the uniform after you get the teacher you must go to school yeah yes you can't burn classes like some of us do in the church [Music] your banking class all right the spirit how many of you alone that's not my father amen so you the teacher can't come in the exam and write your exam neither can your parents who fought to get you in the school come there and write your exam you must go it through it on your own and what does it take you going to classes you making notes you're studying you're burning the midnight oil you are toiling in the spirit you are twirling why because at the end you want to receive a reward of past amen amen so if we want to get to heaven we are going through life's journey now We Are Spiritual Beings having an Earthly encounter stop living like a devil amen I'm getting tormented by the devil and thinking oh I'm just you're being tormented all the time you are bringing it upon yourself imagine God is the provided way for you and for your life but you keep running away from the presence of God and because you're a son and daughter of God is going to put you into an unpleasant experiences so that you come in line with his word amen hallelujah so we know that the Holy Spirit when it comes amen it starts now every individual every individual here in this church must be born again amen it starts with a new birth and when we have a new birth if we have a new nature amen so the Holy Spirit we know is not a filthy spirit amen amen the Holy Spirit won't an angry in person the atmosphere must be right amen amen so we could have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but how we feel through the Holy Spirit I could ask you to raise your hand right now but I don't want to do that how many of you have the Holy Spirit amen but there is an Evidence of the holy spirit amen amen there is fruits of the Holy Spirit if I can talk to somebody for two minutes and I'll tell you if they got the Holy Spirit or not amen amen unfortunately we are not living in the age of sanctification we are not living in the age of justification we are living right in the age of the Holy Ghost [Music] things could not be preached and the ages gone by because it was not time and season amen amen but now at the opening of the world he says when denominational Rivers had the Holy Ghost bound he says but now at the preaching of this message it loose the Holy Ghost so let him that's filthy be filthy still oh yes but let him that's holy be holy still amen now the Holy Ghost is coming upon the person that's already been Justified and Sanctified yes he's not going to come on somebody who's unclean amen amen there are three stages to the spiritual New Birth just as they are stages to the Natural birth amen now you know in the natural birth first there is a conception takes place in the whom of the mother right and then the baby starts to grow in the womb then do you find all the organ stops to form the bone starts to form the skin and everything where is all that's being formed on the inside amen amen amen and when the baby is fully formed after nine months the mother starts to it and is ready to be delivered in the world has to experience nothing more intense sisters forgive me if I'm not saying the right words or using the right terminology I was only a casual Observer when these things were happening right you that have given childbirth you know what I'm talking about Hallelujah so the mother is experiencing birth pains she knows she is ready to deliver the child amen the first thing experience amen any birth is a mess so too is the new birth you cannot say you've had a new birth and you know nothing about it God does not conduct C-sections God does not give you painkillers puts you to sleep and get him and makes you wake up having a new birth and a new nature amen you must bring forth the Christ in your life and it takes both pains you will know when something is happening inside of you amen amen what do we spend our times doing what do we spend our time doing what music do we listen to Young People old people what music do we listen to pop music ungodly music amen what kind of atmosphere we're creating we want to be cool and hip with our friends it won't be cool in hell in fact if some of us died right now we would open our eyes in hell but God has given us this morning to make things with the Lord amen amen where would you amen where would you end up right now amen oh no uh when last did you praise the Lord when last should you sing I don't sing okay you don't sing when last would you praise the Lord uh I didn't praise the Lord I like one thing brother I like to admire your nature hey every woman I like to I I admire is the highest form of going to the brothers and our other sisters some only love to admire God in his Nation hey I'm appreciating God's Beauty you're lusting after woman I gotta spell it out because some didn't get it still right man some don't know what the highest form of God's grace okay some have a string eye still have to overcome that a small man some even say Lord oh I thank you for your creation oh we gotta Focus the flesh is weak we're not saying these things are not going to count Temptations not going to come but train yourself [Music] spiritually disciplined amen some Never sing some level worship when's the last time uh I didn't come last week so I think it was the other weekend I read the Bible when you passed you read the Bible this verse I forgot what verse it was but I know you read it when last did you pray no I didn't pray that other brothers praying in the church they don't make me pray in the church why why they don't make you pray in the church amen God wants to be involved in your everyday life God wants you say I want to hear the voice but God never heard your voice calling out to him you call your mother you want something from you calling your father you calling your brother you're calling your sister you're calling the boss but you never call on Jesus everything in your life is designed to cater for the natural there's no room for the spirit of God to move oh then he says let me come into your office let me see what you got hanging on your walls let me see what friends you join flock together [Music] if you are still hanging around with worldly friends and you are comfortable in the setting you are comfortable around that kind of conversation then I ask you to re-examine your spirit because the spirit Is possessing you is not the holy spirit amen amen some of us the only tongues we speak is in a filthy town you know Jesus was at the confidence to ask this question whom do men say that I the son of man am en we are free to ask them if we are to ask a question who do men say that I am [Music] he walked around the road scraping his Bush knife says he'll sort everyone out who's that person who do men say I am yeah I don't know that that man always shouting at his wife eh he's always singing at the children and eating them who do men say that I the son of man am what's my testimony amongst the people what's your testimony amongst the world friend do they even know you're a Christian no something there 007 on a secret mission in the kingdom of God covert operation what we call them brother Joshua playing clothes officers roaming the streets nobody must know you're a Christian amen some people leave the house in a dress and go change before they go to work the bag is packed with the makeup they can put it on on their way to work they wash their face before they come home but some are so bad they don't even care right amen we've got to move along hey man I'm just trying to show you some things amen that we've got to examine Our Lives amen because we can't hit ourselves the Lord can take our breath right now where will we end up amen now we can't base our experience with the new birth and the Holy Ghost based on family you cannot go in on your father's experience mother's experience individual experience young man younger you must be born again amen so we know that after the shedding of blood the mother is now pushing out their baby and when the baby comes out he takes his first breath and with that first breath the spirit enters the body and comes to life now we don't want stillborn Birds right no stillborn birds in the kingdom of God now the day you were born is known as your birthday and each one of us has a birthday every one of us have a birthday none of us are angels have been dropped down from heaven yeah we love our birthdays we think highly of this important day amen we think highly of this day we think highly of ourselves and so important that we want everyone to wish us we want people to spoil us and we want to be treated well on our birthday this is my day amen but we should Rejoice even more at the new birth amen because the natural birth can only inherit Earthly things but the spiritual blood Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom inherit the kingdom of God the new birth will make you inherit the kingdom of God Amen [Music] amen Hallelujah now this is a very marvelous thing and I want to bring it very quickly I don't have time to go and teach it right now but you know that the new birth consists of three stages justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost right I'm gonna jump ahead these three stages where events we can probably throw up those notes then you'll find some of it there amen [Music] because it was signified by Three Angels message you know the Three Angels flying in the Book of Revelation The Three Angels message each stage because the church had come through seven Church ages and the restoration were just amen amen amen you find the prophet of God laboring to bring the things out but it was also signified on the Earth by other three things three distinct things that are called will remember the email you find this in the Book of Revelation chapter 7 where he says hold back the winds amen so what is this three words signify the prophet says it signifies the birth Prince and the Earth he's going through amen amen he says here [Music] the first if in the first book sorry the first world war they had certain type of weaponry everyone following now so think of it as three stages now justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost right Three Angels messages but three Wars also signifying the three birth pains that the Earth is going through he says under the first birth pain we had bombs machine guns and poison gas mustard and chlorine gas that would burn up the world and these winds were blowing on the Earth and everyone was scared to death under this great weapon now I'm trying to hopefully you can see what I'm trying to present to you in the spirit world because in the natural if they produce Weaponry that was able to annihilate the kingdom of the Earth in the spiritual under justification there were weapons released to the church that will annihilate Satan's kingdom amen amen and each pain produce greater weaponry amen so true that each stage of the Holy Ghost gives the church a greater power and an action amen each stage the church in the greatest amen this church is not empowered the same way that Wesley was but this church has received the fullness of the power amen amen to overcome and withstand it's tactics the Holy Ghost has come to wanted to bring that and we could have labored on that point but I want you to understand each blood pain produce greater Weaponry second world war produce the atomic bomb a greater weapon amen he says could have been finished in the second world war but they were Angels holding back the winds yes but now they is coming forth one more bird pain lightning is coming forth one more pain in this bride amen then we're gonna push out amen hallelujah yes thank you let's go to those notes amen let's go up there first one he says here I want you to see this now because some they don't believe in certain things yes the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost Shield may say can I receive the Holy Ghost here's what the prophet is saying he's ready to fill any heart that's empty of the world Amen the reason why the Holy Spirit may not be able to fill you is because we are so full of ourselves we are so full of our own ideas right now say holy spirit I Surrender I don't want you to wait till you're home now right now say holy spirit I surrender all my thoughts all my plans I empty out Lord I don't want to leave this for tomorrow amen do it now it's ready to fill in any heart that's empty out the world oh nonsense say I cement it now whatever it be lying cheating gambling stealing amen whatever your problem is leave now amen empty out he says Christ for coming in the form of the Holy Ghost and you'll be saved and have peace and if you want that amen let's go on he says the Holy Ghost priesthood of circumcision of the heart so here he's talking about the circumcision sign that was given to Abraham but he's saying the holy ghost is now in the priesthood of circumcision of the hearts and not the flesh what is circumcision taking away the excess flesh it is signed to the believer the Holy Ghost is here to perform to take away the excess flesh then you can offer praise to God sacrifice your limb you never sing you never worship because they amen the Bible says let everything that has breath praise the Lord amen don't live and steal we praise let everything that I need the Lord amen each one fasting fighting stewing this death right that's not how the Holy Ghost works it says when they were in one man yes you'll never be sings lightly even in the church you'll never be saved and receive the Holy Ghost unless you believe the word of God and the man that's preaching it not who you think he is right right the properties you respect the office of demand amen and there's nothing wrong if you respect the man as well some people are so arrogant in the message oh he's lucky he's a pastor I'll respect him but what's wrong what's wrong why are you so upset [Music] about things which are fighting we're against flesh and blood never be saved am I you'll never be saved keep the Holy Ghost unless the word of God and the man that's the gift of healing if you get the people to believe you isn't that what the angel told the prophet nothing important because people don't like to do this sometimes I like to do practical things he says right after the healing service I want each of you that raise your hand to come to the altar personally kneel down and pray because the prophet of the age telling you to do something amen yes he said no now this is my religious voice we don't know now we have the opening of the world people must just receive it they in the morning but not everyone is enjoyable brother the person preaching that never ever receives let me tell you that when he's sitting there you don't have a receipt he only preaches it but it doesn't experience it why doesn't he receive it the way he's saying he was receiving yes the prophet he says come to the Altar and kneel down and pray raising your hand does that do anything yes sir amen certainly he does yeah sometimes all we need in the house of the Lord is some good old-fashioned repentance cause I'm crying out to the Lord I am weighed in the balances and I have far wanting he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me had everlasting life amen makes you a new creature then your fruits will prove it amen after you've done that after you've done what come to the alt and repent you know I said that some people are secret covert agents some people also see forgive me we started out by saying that some people were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you remember but they didn't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what do we always say at baptism it's an outward show that an inward walk has been done [Music] it's a public declaration in the house of the Lord there should be no one feeling ashamed in fact if somebody is looking down on your ashamed you bring them with they need to repent pray with you amen hallelujah thank you amen hmm it says by one spirit will be baptized into the body of power and service amen amen he never said you'll receive the new birth after the Holy Ghost come upon you you see what some people are looking for some people are looking for the new birth after the Holy Ghost comes you can't have it that way you've got to have a new birth first then the Holy Ghost said you know after the whole upon you but you baptized with the Holy Ghost until power powerful service amen Hallelujah amen let's turn to Luke chapter 1 verse 35 I just want to lay some scriptures here very quickly while you're turning to that scripture there and it's not Acts chapter two like some of your thinking I think I've preached enough now I want to lay some scriptures so that you look 135 says the angel answered and said unto her come upon thee first time the Holy Ghost then there's a promise given in Matthew 3 and 11. where they asked the Apostle John the Baptist and he's telling them I indeed baptize he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost amen Jesus is coming to baptize you with the Holy Ghost amen and with fire yes amen Matthew 12 and 31. this is what happens when people don't reverence the Holy Spirit now he says all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men verse 32 whosoever speaking the word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speak it against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come right you understand the severity of them you can speak Jesus we ghost and let me bring this more clearly how is the Holy Ghost appearing the whole amen okay we need to move quickly now amen to get to a few more scriptures yes the Apostle the John the Baptist 9 Luke 1 15. so Acts chapter 2 is not when the Holy Ghost first fell that's when it first fell after Jesus left but yet Luke one until it says talking about God he shall be in the sight of the Lord give me the wine and he shows but notice the Holy Ghost we sing in the mothers who we can actually identify the time period there to find in Luke 1 41 when he actually received the Holy Ghost it says it came to pass when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary The Babe left you to whom and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost amen So Not only was John Field Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost Not only was Elizabeth filled but you'll read in Luke 167 and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and one that only goes to prophesy amen then you go to Luke 2 and 25 you'll see here is a man by the name of Simeon and the Bible says he's a man that was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and the Holy Ghost is a teacher now is revealing it revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ amen Everybody follow him amen then in Luke chapter 3 and verse 22 the Holy Ghost now is descending Upon Jesus and it says and behold and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice Came From Heaven which said thou what my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and Jesus sorry Luke 4 1. it says and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness so the spirit will lead you to your quiet times the spirit will lead you why was he going there he was going to fast the spirit will lead you to fast the spirit will lead you to pray amen John 7 and 37 yeah Lord Jesus now he's talking about the Holy Ghost baptism that will come upon us it says in the last day are we living in the last day amen the Great Day of Defeat Jesus stood and cried If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture says out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters amen but this speakey of the spirit which they believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified amen so what are we finding here Jesus was dealing with individuals that was going to bring the promise to pass he was dealing with Mary Elizabeth John Zacharias because and Simeon because they were instrumental in bringing the promise to pass John 14 and 25 says these things I have spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter here's the Holy Ghost now he's a comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name yeah what is the name of the Holy Ghost Jesus amen the father shall send in my name what is the name of the Holy Ghost some don't believe that some say these two Jesus I'm showing you this three Jesus in in their terminology there's only one Lord Jesus Christ in their reasoning Jesus said I came in my father's name so his name was Jesus so the father's name is Jesus there's a father Jesus there's a son Jesus now we've got a problem here because Jesus is saying I'm going to send the comforter the Holy Ghost and I'm going to send him in my name amen the Holy Ghost is going to be named Jesus so now they've got three Jesus but the Revelation is in this hour the father Son and Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] what is he gonna do he shall teach you all things he shall bring things to your remembrance now very important is this next line whatsoever I have said unto you so if you don't know what Jesus said how can he bring things to your remembrance if you don't read the word how can he bring those things to your remembrance if you don't spend time how can you bring those things and teach you amen let's drop to verse 15 the same chapter amen he says here if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever now here's another thing he is the spirit of Truth right it says the world can't receive him it's yet him not neither nor with him but you know him for he dwelleth with you you know and shall be in you amen amen hallelujah the Holy Spirit dwells with you and he dwells in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while in the world see at me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also amen at that day you shall know that I am in the father and you in me and I knew he that had my Commandments and keepeth them is he that loveth me who are the ones that love him that keep his Commandments and he that loveth me shall also be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas now asks a question how will you manifest yourself he says if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our board with him some of us are feeling very uncomfortable right now important to us not one to accept and this is where we're gonna kill the flesh now we do not want to accept that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost people that was given to us is for the indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever things I have said
