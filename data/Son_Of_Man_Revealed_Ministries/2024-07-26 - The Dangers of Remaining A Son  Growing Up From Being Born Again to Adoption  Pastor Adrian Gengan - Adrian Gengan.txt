TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen hallelujah amen father we thank you for the word of God yes word of God is our life oh God word of God for our comfort father Lord is our source of strength oh God we cannot live without your word oh God we know Lord that you said that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God we thank you Lord that you have revealed your word to us in this day Lord we know your word hasn't come Lord to make us part of a religion oh God but your word has come Lord to restore us as Sons and Daughters of god father I pray Lord that you will take your word and Quicken it to our hearts and souls oh God and I pray Lord that you'll meet the need tonight of every believer that has come into the house of the Lord I pray you'll bless everyone Lord Jesus whatever they need is Father meet them at the point of their need if they have a question Lord I pray you'll answer it Lord Jesus I pray Lord that we submit ourselves to the leadership of your spirit now and we pray Lord that the great angel of God will come and be in our midst father we ask His blessings in Jesus name amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah I soon coming King amen what a great day it'll be when we see the Lord Jesus Christ face to face amen what a day that will be amen so greet you and I pray that you all being blessed in the house of the Lord amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles even as we read amen praise the Lord Let's uh turn to Ephesians chap 1 and: 3 Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3 reads blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us not will bless bless us he had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ amen according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself so adoption of children is coming by Jesus Christ to himself because the Redeemer needs to come to adopt us according to the good pleasure of his will then we'll turn to Romans chapter 8 and verse1 17 amen these are very important scriptures for us amen so make note of these scriptures he predestinated us for one purpose remember collectively we call ourselves the bride the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ but individually we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 reads I'm reading from the Amplified but you can read from you your King James and if we are his children then we are his heirs also HS of God and fellow HS with Christ sharing his spiritual blessings and inheritance if we indeed share in his suffering so that we may also share in his glory amen you may be seated we'll continue reading just need to lay some scriptures down in Galatians 4 and verse 1 Galatians ch 4 and verse1 says now I say that an heir as long as he is a child defer nothing from his servant though he be Lord of all now I don't have time to read it but you remember in Luke chapter 15 when the prodigal son left the home when he came back he was adopted amen but there was one son who remained in the house though he was a of all he wasn't he didn't know how to function in his authority I'm going to read another version of that same verse because I want you to understand what this verse he saying if a father dies this is another version now if a father dies and leaves an inheritance for his young children those children are not much better off than slaves until they grow up even though they actually own everything their father had yes amen hallelujah amen that's right so in Ephesians 4 and verse1 15 speaking the truth in love that's what we are doing we are speaking truth in love people may not like what we are saying but we are speaking the truth in love amen let's we also fall into a deception that we have the opening of the word eve had the opening of the word but she didn't know what to do with the word amen so we don't want to fall into Satan's devices remember he deceived her he was the most subtle Beast yeah he still subtle he'll still come in and try to infiltrate yeah to make you think Pat you on your back don't worry you're okay you're in the message you're safe yeah the point of this message is we don't want you to remain just a son yes amen so there's a danger here now all of us can say we in the message all of us can say we sons of God yes you won't lose your salvation but you can't be a son without Authority yes without being able to advance the kingdom amen without being an effective son in the Kingdom you can be just like the boy who was upset that the prodigal son had now been adopted yes speaking the truth in love may grow up that's why sand I told you turn to your neighbor and tell him grow up amen May grow up into him in All Things amen what are he saying I want you to be like your father grow up amen which is the head even Christen amen now here what the prophet of God is saying in the adoption message I believe that we all baptized with the Holy Spirit and brought into the body and then we become Sons so that's all fine that's your birth he says but then after Sons there's a placing of sons or the adoption of sons amen because remember your birth is not your adoption amen we can't be in the message so long and not understand the new birth we fuss about baptism not realizing the revelation of baptism came to show us the correct birth because Jesus in John chapter 3 is teaching us about the New Birth he says except a man be born of water and of spirit amen so notice water is for the birth spirit is for your placing amen amen so the spirit comes at both times because it's in Jesus there the Holy Spirit comes at the Jordan River for his birth and then he comes in Matthew 17 Cloud overshadows him for his adoption everybody understand that so there there's two works that the holy spirit will do the holy spirit is not pouring out now for your birth the holy spirit is pouring out in this time and in this season for your adoption that's right yes amen amen God is looking for spiritually mature Sons amen amen now I'm going to say this that we have a responsibility we have a responsibility to carry our anointing yes yes amen amen amen because when we are fighting there's only one war being fought and it's against the kingdom of God we are Waging War you know in a in a battlefield there are certain soldiers that take strategic positions that go conquer strategic territory and when they conquer that territory they call to the rest they word back home we have conquered nandi yeah we have uh we have come through the beach yeah and because they conquer certain territory they make way for the other troops amen so when we are advancing the kingdom when we are amen advancing the kingdom and you know the prophet says there's much even Joshua says there's much more land that's not taken up there remain it much more land what he saying I'm saying it another way that they we need to Ascend the spirit realm yes amen we need to go into higher dimensions of the holy spirit because the land is your inhabitance which is the Holy Ghost so when we saying there's much more land that remains there's much more Holy Ghost That Remains we are saying come into higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen yes Lord amen amen don't be a son only yeah I I know many people preach it this way oh just Keep On Believing the message Just Keep On Believing the message one day God's going to open up a portal to you and you're going to be able to speak I say speak now yes amen I say you have nothing to lose I say take God by his word and speak now yes amen wonderful thank you Lord amen the reason why they say that way they are scared something won't happen and their reputation is at stake I say it's not my reputation at stake it is God's reputation at stake if he says ask anything in my name I don't have to wait for a certain time and a season for it to open up to me I can speak now as a Son of God amen amen people are afraid like the son they don't realize they speaking like that son father I was in your house how come you never killed a fatted cal for me the father says son you were in my house all the time you had access you could have made a feast for yourself how about we make a feast for our elves amen hallelujah amen how about we exercise some of our Authority that's right amen amen and I say that because when we are operating under our commission the commission is to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem amen that is not to rebuild the walls of Son of Man reveal Ministries amen hallelujah when the Bible is talking about the Church of Corinth the church at this amen it is just to give you the IDE of who they are referring to but it is one Church it is one body amen so when we win battles here we are winning battles for the body of Christ amen amen oh hallelujah amen we having some good Fellowship earlier brother Joshua amen hallelujah because this is not just a church move this is a body move amen when you see that we advancing certain territories and advancing the kingdom and defeating the enemy you are finding other churches following suit because somebody is opening the portal yes amen yes that's right that's why I say it's one Warfare they some people are taking strategic positions some people are taking their place some people are taking back what the devil stole from them amen so don't just think that we a small group of people and we are ineffective in the body of Christ I tell you we are an Elite Force amen Hallelujah we are special ops amen yes that's right Hallelujah blessed be your name so now he says now what is adoption your adoption is not your birth so many people he says like the Pentecostal Church thought they were adopted when they were born at the New Birth the prophet is now saying your adoption is not your birth turn to your neighbor and tell him your adoption is not your birth your son is born is he adopted can he speak will you give him your card will you give him your car keys no because your adoption is not your birth you've got to wait for a time of maturity amen so the prophet is saying your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing amen when you were born again John 1:17 I believe when we were born of the spirit of God we are sons of God but we were predestinated now here what I'm trying to get to you for this sons of the last day we were predestinated unto adoption Hallelujah so we are going somewhere amen amen yeah what he says now about the church he says we're groaning waiting for that time of adoption ion and we believe that one of these days the holy spirit will move in not with a new birth for we receive that to Christ but you'll adopt your church then now we saying that years ago I believe the time is now Hallelujah he's saying there we believe one of these days the holy spirit will move in can you identify the Holy Spirit has moved in amen not with a new birth now but we have received that through Christ but you'll adopt your church then I'm so glad this is them this is that which the prophet brandham had spoken about amen them shall be clothed with the power of the resurrected Lord amen amen hallelujah not in this days before the crucifixion but in the power of the resurrected Lord amen will I leap through walls leap over walls come on now here what the prophet of God is saying they'll be res they'll have the power of the resurrected Lord amen not just the Lord before the crucifixion will they be able to pass through walls then yes amen will they be able to move like a thought yes Lord will they be able to change Dimensions amen yes well that's the power of the resurrected Lord amen and father we now watch most people are saying this I'm going to say it openly they are preaching that this is in a future time that it's only when the squeeze comes why afraid looking at what he will do talking about what he has done afraid of what he's doing now yes now here the prophet's prayer this is a prayer Watch what he's saying we pray father that you'll do this quickly amen for the days look so dark and evil ahead we pray you'll adopt us now if you pray adop us now I pray adop us now Lord Jesus into your family give us the authority that we need father to make the gain here keep still Hallelujah that's from the message the believer's position in Christ now how if you believe that the Lord Jesus Christ came in and gave us an inheritance amen amen all right everybody said amen I want to show you what the prophet of God says that Jesus didn't give us any inheritance he's talking about here in the adoption message inheritance by predestination he says I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance amen your inheritance was given to you before the foundation of the world but through the fall you lost your inheritance but Jesus Christ came to pay the price for for Redemption so that you can have access to your inheritance come on you're a Son of God Amen because how can one son give another son inheritance it's got to be the father who gives the inheritance so the father already gave us the inheritance but he sent his son to pay the price of redemption so that you can be restored back to your inheritance somebody give God praise why do you think we sing that we just read the verse now we are joint years yes amen hallelujah amen now think of it in your home brother Joshua you got a father there's two brothers here Joshua and Jaffer if your father passes away can you give him an inheritance whose inheritance is it the father's inheritance that's why he's quoting this Jesus never left us in inheritance Jesus came to restore us and reconnect us with our inheritance amen Jesus never left you an in if you want that it's an adoption part three he never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first first amen amen thank you Lord Jesus didn't come to do a new thing Jesus came to be the sacrifice to take you back to the original amen hallelujah hallah amen praise the Lord now just to go into this quickly he's talking about a son who's bornn in Israel after 8 days he was circumcised and become an Israel Israelite but he was born of the father and if that child was given a tutor Galatians teaches us after he was raised up to a certain age became very faithful to the father's work and everything he was a fine boy now the father didn't know what he would be when he was born he might be a gangster he might be slothful in the father's business he couldn't turn Kingdom and things his work over to that boy right even though he fell air to the kingdom of his father or The Possession the first that son had to be raised and tried he had to be found out whether this son was true son or he was just simply a roused about and this son would never be an heir if he wasn't qualified to take his father's place but if he was qualified and took the father's place then the father then all the that the father had had was given to his son now if you had wondered why there was a stretch since 65 the father was putting us through tutors there was a time where you were trained the father wanted to see whether you're a witch or a tear so he put you through a tutor ship put you when when when the when when they were rocking and shaking amen the winds were blowing against the cloud and the winds were blowing against the pillar of fire the winds were blowing against his Prophet to see what kind of material You're Made Of amen amen amen but now that you can go through that place of trying the holy spirit is here for your adoption amen thank you Lord so he says as soon as the child was born the father being so busy with other things he sought out a tutor or he raised off his child him not knowing that him knowing that this child was in line of air of everything he had his property his good name everything that he would go had would go to his son he sought the very best school teacher you could find to teach that child the father would not seek a man who would try to get a feather in his hat right so he will the sun Renegade he says it come up oh son you're doing very well he wouldn't do that so he's not going to compliment you if you're not doing well he's got a man who tell him the truth and we are the spirit of Truth the Holy Ghost is our tutor for you wanted to know just exactly the welfare of that boy at all times now even while you are being trained trained the Holy Spirit was giving a report some of you were were falling and backsliding and going back into the world the Holy Spirit was giving a report because he wants to know the welfare of the boy amen thank you Jesus but he also wants to see if you remain in that condition in your pig pin and are content with that style of life or if you're going to come back to father's home amen thank you Lord amen now here's an important part we want to get to then if this tutor brought word to the father that the child was worthy and all all right he was then adopted into that family right he was adopted into the family but if he wasn't he still remained a son but he wasn't adopted this is the dangerous part of the message of the hour now that's right because the message is for the adoption yes amen so in your life now when we asking you to write the vision and we asking you what do you want for your life I don't want you to only think carnally what do you want for your life spiritually amen young man what do you want to grow up you are already at an age where you're already supposed to be involved spiritually in the things of God but how do you see yourself spiritually growing do you want to remain a son or do you want to have some responsibility placed upon you we can all Rejoice yes I want to be an adopted son but what does it mean that I want a responsibility placed upon me so I'm asking you to think soberly now sisters what do you want for your life do you want to be a son and daughter of God or do you do you just want to be a son do you just want to be a daughter with no inheritance then every time you need something who do you need to go to you need to go to the adopted son because the adopted son is air of all things amen now I'm having a mature conversation with you I'm having a serious conversation with you how do you envision your life we are now in the father's Kingdom the kingdom is within us amen but we can remain a son with no Authority we can come into the church we can go home we can come into the church say we're part of the messy Church remain a son remain a daughter go home just be happy with this I not happy with this amen amen I am not happy with this I want my portion amen yes Lord so and then if he was adopted he was taken out in the public square and a purple robe was put on him and there was a law of adoption and that boy was adopted by the same father who gave him birth amen I'm reiterating that Point most people are satisfied with a new birth are you born again born born born again thank God I'm born again born born born again thank God I'm born again are you adopted no amen what Ephesians says grow up yes come to adoption amen amen hallelujah amen come out into the Public Square get a purple robe put upon you get the ring upon your finger there was a law of adoption and then that boy was adopted by the same father who gave him birth and he was brought into the family I thought I was I love the family of God you're only in the family when when you're adopted amen ah how many people are adopted then one of them hallelujah amen amen so you see how dangerous it is you see how close those two Spirits can get right that you can be have the family name even you can even have the family name but when you speak nothing moves why you don't want to follow the instruction you you are so enthused after the service I'm going to speak to my Mountain you speak nothing moves why father can't trust you you haven't passed the training you haven't passed the test amen hallelujah born again on a Sunday but gone again on a Monday amen Hallelujah and then he was brought into the family and then he wasn't only a son but then he was an heir coair with the father of every possession he had and then this boy signature on the check meant just the same as his daddy's just the same for he was adopted into full Fellowship of the family amen that's the place I want I want to sign like Daddy and I want you to know a son the one who wasn't adopted can fake the signature but nothing will happen that check is going to bounce we are not here supposed to be faking signatures yes Lord amen meaning that we can't Venture without Authority amen we can be in the church trying to speak trying to do things and nothing is happening what are we doing faking the father's signature but an adopted son is one when he speaks it's as good as the father signing it meaning that when he speaks demons start to ask where must I go that's right amen yes amen demons are even fearful of your Shadow that's right amen church I want you to know that if you're an adopted son and daughter of God you carry a you possess the anointing of the Holy Spirit within you God Almighty within you and when you carry demons start to tremble amen you've got to real if you don't walk around with his Consciousness if you don't walk around with his authority I tell you you're living under your god-given privileges it's time you rise up and realize what we are called for in this hour we are not called to be another church we are not called to be another movement amen we are called to be Sons and Daughters of the most high God we have a sacred responsibility with the anointing we carry amen yes hallelujah amen now he says that's what the matter with the when I'm saying Pentecostal church I want you to understand we're talking about message church too because the next move after the Pentecostal outpouring was the message church right now that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal church tonight too much differences as soon as you got saved you start this way a little trial comes along you fall off you go this way and that way ups and downs fusses and fights oh it sounds so familiar fusses and fights and Carries On until how could God trust you with those things to adopt you into the kingdom of God into his possession give you give you air to all the spiritual benefits if the church would only held together and quit fasting and splitting up and arguing over little baptisms oh 2024 20 we still splitting up he's saying if they can only hold together quit fasting splitting up arguing over little baptism and things like that you'd be a lot better off and one Church against the other that isn't Sons that's right God can't trust you divine gifts are very sacred see why I'm saying we have a responsibility that's right Divine gifts are very sacred and remember a person could send their soul to hell with one if you'll notice on the platform on my cases my patience I'm very careful of what I say I weigh every word I find the condition of that Soul before I say anything amen so just want to reiterate this now if he was a trusted son there came a certain day I want you to listen real close now there come a certain day in that young fellow's life after he became illegible after after he was well trained after he became a certain age this is dropped down to me why is it every every denominational service they have an alter call for New Birth only how many if you want to be born again Born Again born again you see they keep reproducing re keep reproducing but nobody comes to adoption how about taking those same people that came and wanted to be a born again and now have a second ceremony there was a time that the father adopted that child that he gave birth to into his own family that was the placing of a son to your ministers the same son that was born into the family had to be placed into the family or had to be the law of adoption okay everybody gets the point in the message everlasting life and how to receive it in paragraph 110 there let's keep one 109 let's go to 110 now when the Pentecostal church and these people in the last days are we the people in the last days here has begin to find the new birth being born again they thought they had settled it no sir your ups and downs your ins and outs and things like that God can't place you as a son how many of you know what the prophet is talking about you had ups and downs in your life ups and downs you see why Peter had to get out the boat because in the boat there was ups and downs the boat was going like that what is he saying but when you stay in the Kingdom stay in the gospel stay right one of these days God will call you out and set you aside adopt you as his son before the people and give you something that will shake the Nations amen see what I mean is the adoption into the family amen how many of you want to prophesy again how many of you want to shake the Nations amen yes see he's reiterating again that's where I think many of us made a mistake we think as soon as we become sons of God we that settles it amen hallelujah doesn't amen now here what he says now this is now the the one that remains a son very important I'm bringing this because I believe at this time and season some are going to remain Sons but some will go on to adoption amen let him that's filthy be filthy still and let him that's holy be holy still now we we saying that these people are not good people no the son that stayed at home with the father was a good man he followed all the teachings of the message but he didn't have an inheritance he didn't know how to live in The Inheritance here what the prophet is saying now and this little razor this tutor was supposed to come and bring word to the father how the child was progressing and how the tutor must have blushed If the child was misbehaving itself how the little boy was not interested in the things of his father's Farm or Kingdom how the Holy Spirit must feel today when it goes before God with a bowed shame face as it was to take a report of our indifference in the church today how we laid aside all the baptism of the spirit and how that the church are having a form of godliness and denying the power amen some of you know what I'm talking about amen we went to a service recently I don't believe in the third pool of 1959 you got a few screws loose in your head what is he saying we've laid aside denying the power do you know what 1959 is speaking squirrels into existence they say they don't believe that third pool we not preaching the third pool of 959 when the prophet spoke that fish back to life you know why you remain the son oh I feel a backbone now hello are we going to call a spade a spade or we just going to listen to any nonsense that comes forth saying boldly boldly we are not preaching the third pool of 1959 can you speak a squirrel into existence can you speak a fish back to life can you speak to the Beast can you speak to the bull so you're saying you're not preaching the third pool of 1959 because you carry no power No Authority anytime let me tell you what the teaching is we believe the opening of the word brother so anytime it comes to a physical manifestation where you speak into the wind you speak into the storm they're going to get exposed because they carry no power so they rather hide behind see how well we can operate the word brother we can bring out the word with this type and this Shadow but you carry no power your letter is killing the people rather close your Bible and sit down Amen Let the sons of God Arise yes Lord right right never heard such Awash in my life we not preaching the third pool of 1959 amen hallelujah this one you must clip and put it on there I'm not afraid of anyone amen you can send it to Zimbabwe wherever you want to send it amen hallelujah we're not in the gospel for fame we're not in this gospel for Association we're here to preach the truth amen we're here to position the people of God and not take away your inheritance yes amen hallelujah he's saying how he must blush so they denying the power speaking to the fish speaking to squiddles that's power they denying the power thereof how you must blush today your sons your daughters are dressing immorally how you must blush his children can't even agree with one another long enough to have a meeting how that they're making fun of your people that's been called out and filled with the Holy Spirit you see people even in the message have been so long they even ashamed to be identified with the message they ask you why you dress like that you're so shy you can't tell them with authority the word of God declares that this is the way a woman should dress yes you're compromising with your family you're compromising with the friends you're compromising with work colleagues when you ought to be standing for the word of God yes amen everything is so wishy-washy some are so afraid of the word of God they say my husband don't allow me to wear this then you don't have a revelation of the message not your husband doesn't allow you to do it God's word doesn't allow you to do it amen how that they're making fun of your people that's been called and filled with the spirit how the Holy Ghost must feel to go before God with such messages as that I'm trying to show you the ones who are just Sons coming back saying they have a form of godliness they don't believe in the Supernatural no more they won't even go to church on Wednesday night they stay home what some favorite television program and your gifts that you send down to your church to confirm your word you promise people walk away and call it works of the devil now remember the holy spirit's got to bring to God everything that you're professing Christians say about it did you try did you knock at the heart's door I knocked night after night they wouldn't listen how you must feel he trusted us like he did Adam and Eve he trusted us with the opening of the word he trusted us with the greatest revelation we have amen he trusted us now what are we saying now strike take this off like he did Adam and Eve put them in the Garden of Eden trusted them to be right the father is trusting you church amen to obey his word they fell as soon as man gets his things get things in his hands he will fall every time he cannot hold it himself it takes God to hold us yes amen hallelujah let's go down to uh let's skip the next quote there the next paragraph there's another quote in make the valley full of ditches and I'm going to try and close you now wait you got there in 33 it's starts at paragraph 33 the yes so you can miss your adoption and remain a son across the river they said well what will you ask I wish we'd have time to take this up before the law of adoption Pentecost was born like his son and that same son was born into the family had to be adopted also that's where you missed your calling friend when the adoption time come if the tutor raised the child found the child not worthy they absolutely still remained a son but missed their adoption but if they were adopted into the family then they had full fellowship with any check they wrote just as good as what their daddy wrote that's what's the matter today the church ought to be adoption right now amen the church ought to be in adoption right now amen bringing in the full favors of God hey I like these quotes I like to snipper these quotes and read every day the church ought to be in adoption now amen bringing in the full favors of God but the thing is we're ups and downs ins and outs ups and downs ins and outs till God can't trust us with nothing amen amen so I'm not going to go into this you know the tutor given to us was the Holy Ghost so we must have the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is our guide he's our teacher he's a spirit of Truth he's a spirit of wisdom hallelujah praise the Lord amen bringing this to a close now amen there's so much here the prophet speaks about okay let's go down to that very last uh this the very last highlighted section there so the prophet of God would go on he says when you in when you're now adopted as a son he says as much as you're taking far care of the father's business you can write checks in his name he says if you fire somebody they are fired yeah yes how about we fire the devil right how about we fire all of his imps right how about we fire every Spirit that's against the body of Christ amen yes Lord amen let's fire them praise the Lord we'll read from maybe uh you got 39 there so I'm write down I'm write down it's like the last quote there literally amen yeah there but I want to start maybe Midway uh let's see let's go to the next next one so let's start at the bottom everything the father had was his we're talking about a place Sun now right everything the father had was his let's go to the next one read the old right a son could not walk down the street wasn't doing right yeah straighten up okay that meant so if he fired the man he was fired what is he saying go back there I don't think we got that he says that son could walk down the street and this fellow wasn't doing right he could say yeah straighten up hey it sounds like what I'm doing tonight if I see somebody not doing right I tell him hey straighten up and then he goes to say that meant that meant so if he fired the man he was fired if he wrote a check and paid this off the bank will recognize the cheick just his name was as good as his father after he'd been adopted not because he was born because he was adopted or placed so you see why we can't just Rejoice that we were born again amen we must now Rejoice that we are adopted sons of God and God's trying today to make his shirt stand still long enough that he could place them into their position right but men teachers are making it oh Hallelujah we all this we all that we have the opening of the word oh my what a conglomeration a mess it's a placing amen amen let's just leave it there now so I'm asking asking you not to remain a son not to remain a daughter yes Lord what am I asking you to do I'm asking you to come up higher yes amen I'm asking you to leave the boat amen I'm asking you to step out on the waters amen come where Jesus is come where Jesus is it may look like uncharted waters it may look like not familiar territory why don't we stay in the safety of what we know for the last 40 years the last 40 years what has he done for you you were under tutors you were under the guide you are being tested brought through your place of trying I'm asking you now to come to your adoption I'm asking you to come now to your full ceremony how get the Holy Ghost in the Holy Ghost is outpouring filling in this time why do you think he says the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost yes you had it at the birth but the Holy Ghost you know the Holy Ghost has an attribute and it does two things it comes to birth you and he comes to adopt you the attribute of the Holy Ghost and who is he doing this the C genin the ones whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life he comes to give them a birth and then now he's coming for the adoption ceremony why do you think he's revealing himself in the way that he is doing why do you think we are seeing his digital footprint Prince why do you think we are seeing all of these things why do you think we are seeing that the angel of God Amen Hallelujah is going before you amen why for the adoption ceremony now I know this kind of message maybe 50% will say yes this is me this is what I'm called for this is what I step into the others probably will say no and they will remain as a son and a daughter of God I'm asking you what do you want for your life amen amen who is going to light up Romans 8 who's going to light up Mark 11:23 amen who's going to light up Mark 16 yes amen only an adopted son Hey I was talking to a pastor today and he was telling me this humor this humorous thing and he was telling me that how this uh this like a bishop he went to the Catholic church and he he saw all the wealth of the church and he said well we can't preach like Peter and them and say Silver and Gold Have we none because they got it right and then the other guy says well you also can't preach pick up your bed and walk why they don't have the power and authority let's not be like that the message didn't come to make us puffed what they call it a stuffed shirt to walk around like we are better than you the message came to place us as adopted Sons and Daughters of God the message didn't come for us to go and criticize and condemn everybody else the message came to place us as sons in our position am yes amen hallelujah you know just reflecting on last week Wednesday the Lord ordained for that meeting when we had that meeting at the house of my aunt brother Joshua brother Jeff's gr the Lord ordained that meeting and the Lord operated in more ways than you can understand amen maybe you didn't speak to the people there but there were so many needs there and one of the first person that came to speak to me told me this and this is from a pastor's home pastor's wife comes to me now remember what we always say that denomination only pre salvation they only preaching the cross and they're preaching this she comes to me and runs to me says it was so refreshing to hear about salvation it was so refreshing to hear about these things in my mind I'm thinking what are you all preaching then because we are thinking that's their message and then I think it was there was like I don't know how many people kept coming brother Josh you were keeping I don't know if you were keeping count but people kept coming there I'm talking about not you message people people now none of your message people came to me you're all used to this kind of preaching everybody else was commenting on those things even a pastor that was there needed prayer amen so we he got shocked that we prayed for him right there because we don't preach the old word only but in power and in demonstration in fact he was going to his car what's he going for what transplant he's going for a kidney transplant when I heard that I said well if the angel of the Lord is here what better opportunity it is he was on his way to his car and said brother Joshua call him back here and right there we prayed for him amen I started to minister him and tell him how that God that any manufacturer carry spare parts amen he looked at me shocked I said any manufacturer carry spare parts and who who created you you created in the image and likeness of Goden and we're going to call on the manufacturer right now to give you a new kidney amen amen can we be bold it's our father's kingdom yes didn't he say it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom I must wait for what the bride is thus say the Lord yes what are you waiting for you remember how the Lord rebuked Brother Bram he says why must you wait for a vision how long must I he says you have the word the word is higher than a vision the word is higher
