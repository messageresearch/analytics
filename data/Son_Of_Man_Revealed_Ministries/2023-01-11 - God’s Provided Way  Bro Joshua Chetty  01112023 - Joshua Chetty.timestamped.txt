[0:24] and father come and mold us and shape Us
[0:26] One More Time Lord until we come into
[0:28] your Perfect Image oh God I pray Lord
[0:30] for every believer that is coming to the
[0:31] house of the Lord may you bless each
[0:33] every one of them and Lord meet with
[0:35] their need father I pray Lord God even
[0:37] as the word comes forth Lord that your
[0:39] word will meet the need and father bring
[0:41] the result oh God because your word is
[0:43] powerful it's sharp it's quick oh God we
[0:45] come the service into your hands of
[0:47] everything that will be said and done we
[0:48] ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless
[0:51] you you may be seated praise the Lord
[0:55] amen everybody feeling good in the house
[0:57] of the Lord amen it's a good thing to
[0:59] serve the Lord amen it's a good thing to
[1:02] come into the house of the Lord to
[1:03] worship him you know David was saying I
[1:06] was glad when they said unto me let us
[1:10] go into the house of the Lord am amen so
[1:13] you can see it wasn't a ritual yes amen
[1:18] because if it was a set thing then David
[1:21] would have known he was going but they
[1:23] came and told David let us go into the
[1:26] house of the Lord amen and he said I was
[1:28] glad when they said unto me let us go
[1:30] into the house of the Lord amen so we
[1:32] haven't come out of religion or out of
[1:34] just uh amen just a set program please
[1:38] dogmas and just trying to serve the Lord
[1:40] in the flesh but we are come here under
[1:42] a Divine mandate amen hallelujah because
[1:45] heaven has come down to connect with the
[1:48] body amen Heaven has come down to
[1:50] connect with us so we appreciate the
[1:52] Lord amen you may have seen the
[1:54] announcement earlier so that's sister
[1:56] Rosemary that's my aunt amen that was
[2:00] Pastor Ronnie's brother's wife amen you
[2:03] know Sister Rosemary amen so she passed
[2:07] on Monday and uh faithful sister loved
[2:10] the Lord amen been many years serving
[2:13] the lord and it was a time when the Lord
[2:16] would call her home amen
[2:19] so it's not that we didn't have faith
[2:21] and didn't pray and we didn't believe we
[2:23] believed we had faith we prayed amen
[2:26] amen but the Bible says to everything
[2:29] there is a season
[2:31] a purpose under the heavens amen amen a
[2:34] time to be born and a time to die amen
[2:38] so nobody knows that time that we're
[2:40] going to go into that sixth Dimension
[2:43] because death is not a thing not for the
[2:47] old death is when your time is up when
[2:51] he calls me I will answer amen amen so
[2:54] you find many people of many age groups
[2:56] go on to be with the Lord amen so we
[2:59] just have to be constantly ready
[3:02] constantly serving the lord that is the
[3:04] key to be ready at all times amen so
[3:08] none of us know if we're guaranteed to
[3:10] wake up in the morning so that is why
[3:12] when we come into the house of the Lord
[3:14] amen every night we come ourselves
[3:16] before the Lord amen and trust that he
[3:18] will undertake for us so the funeral
[3:20] will be on
[3:22] Saturday amen you would see the notice
[3:24] there and you'll see the address and
[3:25] everything that you need if you're
[3:27] coming to support amen so there'll be a
[3:29] service also at the house on Friday if
[3:32] you want to come amen it's number three
[3:34] bmal Road in D North amen
[3:38] hallelujah
[3:39] so you know death is never an easy thing
[3:43] especially when it's the lady of the
[3:45] house the mom of the house amen and it
[3:48] leaves a void am and uh you remember
[3:52] Pastor Ron are telling you many times
[3:54] that if the father
[3:57] dies it's not as effect well not not
[4:00] effective what word am I looking
[4:03] for you saying it
[4:06] right but really when Mom leaves a home
[4:09] it's leaves a big void because what does
[4:13] Mom represent love amen she nurtures the
[4:16] family amen sometimes she's the go
[4:19] between in the home some sometimes maybe
[4:22] dad may be hard in a hard line but Mom's
[4:24] the one more soft and can bring the
[4:26] balance in the home amen it's a place
[4:29] where children get married they go but
[4:32] they come back home maybe weekends
[4:34] whatever it's like gather around there
[4:37] Fellowship amen so you know what I'm
[4:40] talking about so just pray for the
[4:42] family amen the Lord will give them
[4:44] strength at this time give them Grace at
[4:46] this time amen hallelujah because it
[4:48] won't be easy days ahead you know these
[4:51] days here it'll just be they still like
[4:53] trying to process what has happened but
[4:56] let the funeral finish once they get
[4:58] some closure there
[5:00] then the real Journey Begins the Journey
[5:02] of healing amen hallelujah so we just
[5:05] want to remember them in prayer as well
[5:07] that the Lord will be with them also
[5:08] remember the the funeral service that
[5:10] will be uh done there amen the Lord will
[5:13] be able to speak in a way amen that will
[5:15] bring Comfort to them
[5:17] hallelujah amen let's all stand together
[5:19] for the word of the Lord amen you're
[5:21] under expectation tonight amen amen
[5:24] hallelujah so you know you look around
[5:26] and you think where is the year
[5:28] gone we already in the 11th month amen
[5:32] so where has the year
[5:33] gone amen we had so much to do so much
[5:37] plans we maybe wanted to achieve but the
[5:40] year's gone
[5:42] by
[5:44] amen
[5:46] so even as we reflect on the year and we
[5:50] see it's the 11th month amen it's not
[5:53] the
[5:56] end maybe you've been trusting the Lord
[5:58] for something believing the Lord that
[6:00] it's going to happen this
[6:02] year amen there's still
[6:05] time maybe you haven't had the faith
[6:07] maybe you haven't had the belief amen
[6:09] but now is the time Amen to rise up I
[6:12] believe that numbers mean
[6:15] something amen amen we're in the 11th
[6:18] month of the 23rd
[6:20] year amen and you know what Mark 11:23
[6:23] says if you say to this
[6:25] mountain amen so that can only work
[6:29] because Jesus is's trying to teach you
[6:31] how to operate in your sunship Authority
[6:33] amen amen and he tells you if you
[6:36] believe what you say yes amen amen did
[6:41] Jesus say if you believe what I
[6:44] say what did Jesus say if you believe
[6:47] what you say everybody believes what
[6:50] Jesus
[6:51] says but man finds it so difficult to
[6:54] believe his own word that he has power
[6:56] he's a God over the Earth so he's coming
[6:59] to put you back in your sunship
[7:00] Authority amen let's just uh sing a song

[16:09] 2023 special time we know as the set man
[16:15] of the house the pastor of the church
[16:17] has said that this will be the most
[16:18] Supernatural year amen but it wasn't
[16:24] words it wasn't something just
[16:27] said you got to understand who said
[16:31] it all of us sitting I mean here tonight
[16:34] would say we'd love to hear Jesus speak
[16:37] directly to us or maybe Prophet William
[16:40] brand was speaking directly to us but
[16:43] God as his provided way of
[16:45] working amen amen and you've got to
[16:48] understand the hour when he's using a
[16:50] certain way and what he's working
[16:52] with because if you don't recognize that
[16:55] then you're missing
[16:57] God yeah
[16:59] you worshiping God where God was but
[17:02] you're not worshiping God where God is
[17:04] yes amen amen so you got to worship God
[17:07] in the way he is working in the now yes
[17:10] amen not in the past tense but in the
[17:12] present tense amen amen so when that

[17:22] believe the testimony amen amen go and
[17:25] see the works that was done amen you

[17:34] we know what happens after the ninth
[17:35] month there had to be a birth of
[17:37] something and then we've now entered the
[17:40] 11th month of the year and you know what
[17:42] happened with the what the 11th month si
[17:45] yes amen so this is the end time
[17:47] evangelism of the 11th Hour workers this
[17:50] is now because Christ is Christ already
[17:52] being reproduced so now it's time for
[17:54] the Greater Works am amen it's time for
[17:57] the end time evangelism for the quick
[17:59] short work amen amen it's time for the
[18:03] supernatural to take place it's time to

[18:08] there was a time for teing amen there's
[18:11] a time to obey and T and to receive
[18:14] power amen but now it's time to take
[18:17] that power amen and have an impact amen
[18:20] with that power to become a powerful to
[18:22] become a power to reckon with to become
[18:25] a powerful force upon the
[18:27] Earth
[18:28] amen you got your bibl let turn to the
[18:30] book of Acts chapter 1 reading from
[18:32] verse
[18:37] 4 amen amen you love the Lord amen

[18:55] that took that anointing and went and
[18:57] anointed your work places hallelujah

[19:03] you left there and then people wondering
[19:04] what's wrong with you why you can't stop

[19:11] we got this special type of wine amen
[19:14] amen amen well fermented amen and new

[19:31] right acts 1 ver4 and being assembled
[19:35] together with them commanded them that
[19:38] they should not depart from
[19:41] Jerusalem amen but wait for the promise
[19:45] of the father yes thank you Lord which
[19:47] say ye have heard of
[19:50] me for John truly baptized with

[20:12] asked of him saying Lord will thou at
[20:15] this time restore again the Kingdom of
[20:18] Israel and he said unto them it is not
[20:21] for you to know the times or the
[20:24] seasons yes so when we was walking in
[20:27] his life and we received the the message
[20:29] of the hour we we didn't know how God is
[20:33] going to work we knew that he's going to
[20:35] do certain things we knew there certain
[20:37] prophecies still to be
[20:39] fulfilled but it wasn't for us to know
[20:41] the time and season because God as his
[20:43] ways of bringing his season in his time
[20:46] in his time he make all things amen amen
[20:49] come to
[20:54] pass which the father put in his own
[20:57] power but ye shall receive power after
[21:02] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and
[21:07] ye shall be Witnesses amen amen you have
[21:12] to be a witness yes amen and to be a
[21:14] witness it means you have to you had to

[21:25] incident took place you couldn't hear it
[21:27] from somebody else amen you had to be

[21:36] amen
[21:37] amen and ye shall be Witnesses unto me
[21:41] in
[21:42] Jerusalem in the message amen right
[21:45] there where he's talking now and in all
[21:47] Judea and in Samaria and to the
[21:50] uttermost part of the earth that's where
[21:52] you go now and thou must prophesy again
[21:54] before Nation tongue and King amen
[21:58] thank you amen you may be seated
[22:04] amen also turn to the book of Acts
[22:06] chapter

[30:27] the Son of God unto a perfect man and to
[30:31] the measure of the stature of the
[30:33] fullness of
[30:34] Christ that we end forth be no more
[30:37] children tossed to and fro carried about
[30:40] with every wi of Doctrine yes there was
[30:43] an age there was a season for
[30:46] that there was a season where people
[30:49] were focusing on every where people were
[30:52] carried away with every wi of Doctrine
[30:54] and what did it do it brought a
[30:56] separation amen yes he brought Discord
[30:59] amongst
[31:00] Brethren it took away brotherly love it
[31:04] people lost Fellowship yes and when that
[31:08] happened when that happened the the Holy
[31:12] Ghost couldn't work freely right and the
[31:14] church became stagnant yes and then it
[31:17] wasn't producing the results because it
[31:19] wasn't God's provided way Amen to come
[31:23] under Doctrine and to be tossed to and
[31:25] fro when man is taking his own Doctrine
[31:27] and denominating around the doctrine
[31:29] that's not God's provided way and it
[31:32] stifles the move of God and then it
[31:34] wasn't producing the same
[31:37] results amen yes but when now the the
[31:40] but the true father Ministry says till
[31:43] we all come in the unity of faith and of
[31:45] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[31:47] perfect man andto the measure of the
[31:49] stature of the fullness of Christ then
[31:52] we end forth being no more
[31:55] children this is an efficient Church a
[31:57] mature Church yes tossed to and fro and
[32:00] carried about with every wind of
[32:02] Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning
[32:04] craftiness whereby they lie in waight to
[32:08] deceive but speaking the truth in
[32:11] love may grow up into him in all things
[32:16] which is the head even Christ from whom
[32:19] the whole body fly joined together and
[32:26] compacted
[32:27] by that which every joint Supply it
[32:32] according to the effectual working in
[32:34] the measure of every part make it
[32:37] increase of the body unto the edifying
[32:40] of itself in
[32:42] love now could you imagine when God
[32:45] called the children of Israel and said
[32:47] to Moses that they must go forth and the
[32:49] Commandment was given to Joshua that you
[32:51] must go and take the people over to
[32:53] Jordan now God said to Joshua that the
[32:57] he's given the land into the for the
[32:58] people and all the enemies and all the
[33:01] heite the jebusite the parasite he given
[33:03] them to In His Hands yes there was but
[33:07] God provided way that they had to go
[33:08] fight every inch for the land yes yes
[33:12] they still had to go and fight for it
[33:14] amen now Joshua made the captain of the
[33:16] host the angel of God was with him yeah
[33:19] they had the Ark of the Covenant going
[33:21] before them in other words they have the
[33:23] word before them amen but they had to
[33:26] take the word
[33:27] and now be practical about the word amen
[33:30] amen they are to now act upon the word
[33:33] amen they had the word they believe the
[33:35] word but they are to act upon it and
[33:38] they are to go and drive out physically
[33:41] drive out the nation physically fight
[33:44] amen yes and just like that we have all
[33:47] the promises of God's word but God
[33:50] provided where is God preach the gospel
[33:53] amen if you lay hands on the sick they
[33:56] shall recover amen
[33:59] amen God preaching the gospel that is
[34:02] God's provided way Paul said I do not
[34:05] come to you with enticing words amen but
[34:09] with the foolishness of preaching the
[34:10] gospel
[34:12] amen so that is God's provided way it's
[34:15] always been God's provided way for each
[34:19] of us to come in we all had to have a
[34:20] personal experience with God Amen you
[34:23] can bring a sinner in the church you can
[34:26] you can tell him everything and try to
[34:29] to to give him theology around salvation
[34:32] try to give him a nice theology upon
[34:34] upon the Plan of Redemption that's not
[34:36] going to change him right because that
[34:39] man's heart need to be
[34:41] changed and it is with anointing that
[34:43] will break the Yoke of bondage amen amen
[34:47] it takes the anointing of the word to
[34:48] come forth and break that turn that
[34:51] Stony Heart to Heart of Flesh amen yes
[34:54] Lord and when that when that hardened
[34:56] heart is changed by the power of God and
[34:59] the preaching of the Gospel then you
[35:01] watch the Power of transformation amen
[35:04] preach under the corrected word amen
[35:06] under God's provided way then you watch
[35:09] the Power of transformation amen because
[35:12] if you don't have the correct word and
[35:13] if the people come because of the music
[35:15] oh yeah maybe they got they came under
[35:17] the the when the music was being plain
[35:21] and it suited them and then it it it
[35:23] brought some kind of a comfort to them
[35:25] like in the bully gram meetings and so
[35:26] forth remember bully was giving the
[35:28] illustration when he went out he
[35:30] preached people come to the altar call
[35:32] and then when he go back you can't even
[35:34] find
[35:36] 30 it's because you have to have the
[35:39] right word and only this word has the
[35:42] power to
[35:43] transform amen because this is not a
[35:46] candy coded gospel this word does
[35:49] introspection this word divides the bone
[35:51] and Marrow amen it comes into it cuts
[35:54] the Thunder amen it goes under is earn
[35:57] the secrets of the heart oh yes Lord
[36:00] amen and intense of the heart nothing
[36:01] could be hid front of this word yeah it
[36:04] cuts it slays but it does its job it
[36:07] doesn't doesn't do a petual from the top
[36:09] it goes from the inside out
[36:12] amen you now that's the power of the
[36:15] Gospel that's why it's always the gospel
[36:18] it's always the preaching of the Gospel
[36:25] amen amen
[36:27] amen if you want to see true Holiness
[36:30] you can go and tell people why you
[36:31] shouldn't cut your hair why you
[36:33] shouldn't that's not going to help
[36:35] them they need to have a change from the
[36:38] inside out amen amen amen and then watch
[36:41] the God's power of transformation then
[36:43] you can use the scripture be not
[36:45] conformed any longer to the pattern of
[36:46] the world but be transformed by the
[36:48] renewing of your mind amen amen when
[36:52] conviction is brought then you watch
[36:54] justification then they come with true
[36:55] repentance right and when they come with
[36:57] true repentance then God will sanctify
[36:59] them fill them up with his holy ghost
[37:02] but you got to still feed them you still
[37:04] got to feed them it's a process it's a
[37:06] process amen because while the process
[37:09] is going on they got to be under
[37:10] covering if they're not under covering
[37:12] and they out there then they Satan's
[37:15] territory that same spirit that left
[37:17] them is going to come seven times worse
[37:19] it's going to bring a
[37:21] reinforcements and because now it's the
[37:23] Sanctified you're going to come and for
[37:25] and come for them
[37:27] so you see why brothers and sisters that
[37:30] are back we need to go yes and bring
[37:33] them back to the F
[37:37] amen amen but if you convince you'll be
[37:40] concerned amen
[37:42] amen he says God always made has made a
[37:47] provided
[37:48] way sometime he don't lead through
[37:50] Pleasant things yes yeah sometime it
[37:54] goes through the hardships
[37:57] but it's God's provided way God makes it
[38:00] anyhow you know I was 18 years old just
[38:04] 18 years old when I
[38:07] was there one day in one of the
[38:10] denomination churches the faith Revival
[38:13] Church in Phoenix and my granny forced
[38:17] me to go for prayer because I didn't
[38:19] have a job at the time and she pushed me
[38:21] to said go pray they had an alter call
[38:24] and that church when they have alter
[38:25] call about 500 people people there they
[38:28] had a guest speaker from the United
[38:30] States he left the entire 500 people now
[38:34] watch I'm showing you how God works now
[38:35] for he predestinated
[38:38] C and you might be wondering why I'm
[38:40] talking about a denomination church God
[38:42] can use a donkey to speak to
[38:46] balum now this person left 500 people
[38:51] and he came to
[38:52] me and he spoke to me that God will call
[38:55] me out to go
[38:57] and things like that I was only 18 years
[39:00] old and uh the first that brought this
[39:03] guest speaker and oh this is what he
[39:04] said he said I don't prophesy he said
[39:06] I'm not a prophet I don't prophesy but
[39:08] this is the first time that God is
[39:10] giving me a dust say the Lord for this
[39:12] young man he said I'm not a problem I
[39:14] never did this in my life it's the first
[39:16] time this happening I don't know you but
[39:18] it's the first time I got to just say
[39:20] the Lord for his young man amen and I
[39:22] was 18 years
[39:23] old now you think somebody is telling
[39:26] you that that's going to change your
[39:27] life that's not going to change your
[39:29] life yes you need the true preaching of
[39:32] the word the true gospel to change your
[39:34] life you need an experience I never had
[39:36] an exper I'm talking about somebody else
[39:37] is prophesying over me that's not my
[39:39] experience he's just telling me what God
[39:41] told him about me but that's not my
[39:46] experience you understand what I'm
[39:48] saying you follow what I'm saying
[39:50] amen then the the the pastor that
[39:53] brought this person
[39:55] said you you need to speak to this young
[39:57] man don't leave him oh yeah sorry the
[39:59] preacher said that don't leave this
[40:00] young man this preacher from America now
[40:03] go and fund him you must you all need to
[40:04] send him to Bible College go and find
[40:06] him send him to Bible College whatever
[40:09] so they said they want to see me at a
[40:10] certain time they called me the first
[40:13] time I went there there was the pastor
[40:15] wasn't there the second time he was
[40:18] there and then he called me I wasn't
[40:19] there and then it so happened that I
[40:21] went into the world and I properly went
[40:23] into the world
[40:24] now when I say I went to the world I
[40:26] really experien the world now so when I
[40:29] went into the world and always asked
[40:31] myself but why Lord if I you call me at
[40:33] that time why did I why you allow me to
[40:34] go into the world cuz nobody when they
[40:36] saved now likes the things that they did
[40:37] in the past nobody because you remember
[40:39] your taste bar changed now when you have
[40:42] your experience with God and God does
[40:44] his power of transformation you have a
[40:46] only man's taste you can't even imagine
[40:48] the life that you lived you know and the
[40:50] company that you kept you can't even
[40:51] imagine how could I be seated with that
[40:53] kind of company how could I been seated
[40:55] with this type of people people you know
[40:58] so I always question why Lord but then
[41:01] the scripture say all things work
[41:02] together for the good to them that love
[41:05] the Lord and are called according to his
[41:07] purpose amen the reason why the Lord
[41:10] showed me why are why you didn't use me
[41:13] at that time because if I went under Day
[41:16] Bible
[41:17] College I would have been influenced
[41:19] under their system yes I would have been
[41:21] saved under their system under the
[41:24] dogmas under the creeds but I was a
[41:27] child of God I was predestinated before
[41:30] the foundation of the world he wanted me
[41:32] a virgin bride amen I might I might have
[41:35] been living in the world on the outside
[41:38] but in the inside the seat of God it's
[41:40] perfect spotless sinless amen he already
[41:44] died for me amen am he said this is my
[41:47] Virgin bride no man can soow seed there
[41:49] amen amen this is my bride only I will
[41:51] put my seed in there you wouldn't allow
[41:54] me to go to the dogmas and creeds and in
[41:56] an appointed time and season I went to
[41:59] another non-denominational Bible college
[42:01] but there I would hear the name William
[42:03] Branham for the first
[42:06] time apart from hearing from I'm talking
[42:08] about outside now I'm talking from
[42:09] teaching now I heard the name William
[42:11] Bram and his teachings about Divine
[42:13] Healing sorry about his ministry about
[42:15] Divine Healing and God will orchestrate
[42:18] these things together because why he
[42:20] would want me to come under his provided
[42:22] way
[42:24] amen so you see how God work
[42:26] so now you look at your life and say
[42:30] these things are supernaturally orated
[42:32] that's right amen God puts things to he
[42:35] fixes things he brings you onto certain
[42:38] points of life to meet certain things
[42:40] amen he does these things for a reason
[42:42] yes thank you and then I said Thank You
[42:44] Lord thank you Lord now I appreciate
[42:48] going into the world it's better than
[42:49] going to the world and being stuck in
[42:51] dogmas and Creed and not receiving this
[42:53] beloved this beautiful message of the
[42:55] hour amen because this is the pearl of
[42:59] great price that I could give everything
[43:01] else up to can buy of this pearl of
[43:03] great price amen am amen so he says the
[43:09] church got to a place where they was
[43:12] kind of cowardly they climbed up in the
[43:14] upper room and stayed up there until 10
[43:17] days at night and suddenly there came a
[43:19] sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty
[43:21] Wind not a preacher walking up the road
[43:23] saying now we'll go take you in by
[43:26] membership not in a Catholic priest to
[43:28] say well we'll give you the Holy
[43:30] Eucharist but the same God's provided
[43:33] way the Holy Ghost came down from heaven
[43:36] like a rushing Mighty Wind it f all the
[43:40] house where they were sitting they
[43:42] didn't walk up and say I want to put my
[43:44] name on the church book they did it

[50:59] men into church is giv him a letter
[51:01] sorry I was read this part God is a way
[51:03] to support a church not making blankets
[51:05] and having soup suppers but every man
[51:08] paying his tithes and offering into the
[51:12] church doing the way God said so said do
[51:17] and that scripture comes with a promise
[51:19] or with
[51:20] a where he said a challenge to God he
[51:23] said prove me yeah and then he also said
[51:25] I'll remove the Devourer from you that's
[51:27] right so if the Devourer devour you he

[51:34] ti that's God's provided way for that
[51:37] God's got a provided way for a man to
[51:39] come into the church today the way we
[51:42] bring men into the church is give him a
[51:44] letter and bring him into the church the
[51:46] right end of Fellowship I had people
[51:48] telling me Oh I like the way my past
[51:52] visit me all the time the way you know
[51:54] they like the good old
[51:56] priest but they also don't know realize
[51:59] what the prophet said the man of God
[52:00] must be set apart giving time to the
[52:02] ministry giving time to prayer there
[52:05] will be a time where the pastor need to
[52:06] counsel with you Pastor needs to pray
[52:08] with you the pastor saw the certain need
[52:10] your need to come and do it but if you
[52:12] are relying on having your Christian
[52:14] work to be comforted all the time with
[52:16] the good old priest coming home then
[52:18] you're not in the right place because
[52:20] that's not going to happen here then you
[52:22] rather go join the Catholic church or
[52:23] the denomination

[52:29] prophet saying he said God's got a
[52:31] provided way for a man to come to the

[52:35] church is to give him
[52:39] a the right and of Fellowship sprinkle
[52:41] little salt shaker full of water on top
[52:43] of his head and bring him into the
