ask these things in Jesus precious name amen amen hallelujah wonderful God hallelujah amen you're glad to be back in the house of the Lord amen a double portion amen it's good to receive a double portion amen from the Lord when know when we know that he wants to speak yes amen and we know that the Bible says as you see the days fast approaching we should gather more often amen and these are not just services that are just said just for any coincidence or any ordinary reason but amen it's the Lord that's moving us the Lord that's drawing us closer to him amen we can turn to First Corinthians chapter 11 amen amen hallelujah amen once again I like to thank our pastor for the opportunity to share the word of the Lord amen and I pray you be blessed in the house of the Lord amen amen amen now you know that in the morning amen we heard the message that was preached amen and it was preached out of first Corin Corinthians chapter 11 amen and this is how I can tell you that amen when Pastor decided to have a second service to out of the ordinary it wasn't just Pastor out of his own desire asking that but it was God leading God orchestrating Amen I had my notes prepared last night and this is the exact same scripture that my message was based on when Pastor opened the scripture in the morning I started to get anxious and I was saying Lord please let him close quickly I don't want him to go into any more of my message amen but it's to show you amen that how can two different people in two different areas tap into the same anointing amen amen why because the Holy Spirit wants to lead us in a certain direction and the Holy Spirit is trying to tell us something and when that happens we got to pay attention amen amen so we don't miss what he's trying to do yes amen so I hope I don't steal any more of brother Joshua's message amen amen you'll see some of the things that we say here was exactly word for word spoken in the morning and I was thinking then should I change my message and then the holy spirit said no he's fixing to do something something there's a reason why he's allowing this so he wants us to stay in this amen so Hallelujah let's just be blessed in his presence thank you amen reading from verse one be a followers of me even as I also am of Christ I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them unto you but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man amen and the head of Christ is God yes every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesied with her head uncovered dishonor her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be sha and the prophet said that word Shan means to Shear it means to cut but if it be a shame for a woman to be Shor or shaven let her be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God so man is the image and glory of God Amen but the woman is the glory of the man we heard that this morning amen amen so this morning we heard that the glory of the man is the woman woman amen but today tonight now we're going to talk about the glory of the woman for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman all things of God judging yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered do not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering so when a woman has long hair and doesn't cut her hair it's a glory unto her amen then Paul goes on to say but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the Churches of God Amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word amen you may be seated amen now we know that the male types the Lord Jesus Christ yes and the female always types the church the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen in verse seven when we read there and I'm going to try and go very quickly because I I've also got to give time to brother Joshua as well but thankfully the foundation was already laid this morning so I don't have to labor on any certain points I can go very quickly so verse 7even says for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and Glory of of God right so man is the image and glory of God and man types Jesus Christ the book of col Colossians chapter 1 says the son is the image of the invisible God the firstborn over all creation for in him all things were created things in heaven on Earth visible and invisible whether Thrones of powers or rulers or authorities all things have been created through him and for him he is before all things and in him all things hold together and he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy so we see that the son is the image of the invisible God Amen just like how man is the image and the glory of God he's typing Jesus Christ who is the image and glory of the invisible God who has made flesh and manifested here on the earth you see God told Moses that no man can see my face and live but Jesus now could come and say no man had seen the father only I have seen the father and I declaim unto you why because Jesus himself is the image and Glory that was expressed in a body of Flesh yes yes but for the woman she has to come under Authority and a headship and when she comes under this headship of a man and under the authority of a man and she Honors that she honors her head amen so we know the Bible tells us when she does not cut her hair she honors her head yes yes and in so doing her very Act of honoring her head and being under the authority of her head by letting her hair grow out this is her glory yes amen so her glory is being under subjection and being under the authority of our headship yes now Jesus Christ we know types the sunlight and the church types the Moonlight and we know that the moon does not have its own light but the moon reflects the same light as the sun in the absence of the sun Hallelujah so if Christ is the image of the invisible God if Christ the image and glory of God being expressed amen and if the church reflects the same light in the absence of Christ physically here on the earth why is she reflecting she's reflecting the same image and glory of God now expressed again in human flesh you see God laid out his pattern in the Garden of Eden God created we know God created Adam first and in Adam was locked up Eve yes and God created Adam in the image of God Amen So Adam was reflecting the glory of the Lord upon the Earth yes amen absolutely and whilst he was reflecting the glory of the Lord upon the Earth locked up inside of him was Eve amen amen amen Hallelujah if you can turn to Genesis 1: 26 you see Eve was not part of the original creation we know that yes and we only know that because the prophet revealed that to us amen she came as a byproduct and now the byproduct itself was not the image and glory of God Adam was made after the image and glory of God Amen if you read Genesis 1: 26 it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness you remember we heard in the morning his glory is his character God made man after his own likeness his own character his own nature and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and the cattle and so forth so why did God make man in his own image in order for man to have dominion over the Earth Hallelujah so if man now wants to have dominion over the Earth how does he get there he has to come back into the image of the glory of the Lord because that is why God put man after his own image after his own likeness after his own attributes after his own nature because God said let there be and there was amen Adam could speak and it happened amen So Adam was a spirit man before he has made flesh right he has made in the image of God but then in Genesis 2:7 now God makes Adam into a flesh body he puts Adam into a flesh body amen and then after that in Genesis 2:22 then Eve was formed as well from the dust of the earth God took out the r from the side of Adam and he made Eve so Adam as the man was in the glory and image of God now coming from Spirit man to flesh man amen just as Jesus Christ who is the glory and image of God came from Spirit body theophany to flesh body amen amen and Eve not being in in the original glory and image of God she was instead made in the glory and image of man yes amen amen she was made in the glory and image of Adam that is why Adam could not say you are bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh you see now and then Evena had to come under subjection to Adam's headship and when she did this this was glorious in the sight of God amen amen God was so pleased now with his family on the earth that every day he would come in the cool of the day amen and have fellowship with him sh Glory came down every day why because man was under the headship of God Eve was under the headship of man everything was working well according to the plan of God and when that happens sh Glory can come down amen yes amen but now they come a time when Eve was deceived by the serpent oh yes you can see now how the foundation was laid in the morning Hallelujah and when Eve was deceived by the serpent she started to dishonor her head yes we know what happened by a prophet amen and an act of adultery was committed amen and she Dishonored her head and when she Dishonored her head what does Corinthians tell us when a woman cuts her hair and dishonors her head she does not have any Glory she cuts off her glory amen so when Eve Dishonored her head she was cut off from her glory amen and now comes Eve here no no more Glory no power she presents this to Adam now many people will say Adam then committed sin the denominational church will tell you Adam then also fell Adam also committed the same sin he's just as guilty as Eve but a prophet then comes and tells us no Adam was not deceived amen we heard this in the morning amen Adam was not deceived he loved e so much and he knew that God would kill her for it because that's God's law amen so he partook of it with her to spare life now watch the type Eve Dishonored her head and left her headship and in so doing she was stripped of her glory yes she cut off her glory but Adam who was perfect and in the image of the invisible God and the glory of God he gave up his glory to save Eve amen amen hallelujah who was his own Glory as we had in the morning amen so amen when I heard this last night you know I was typing on my laptop and this inspiration fell on me and I was just rejoicing with it so when I heard Pastor say the exact same thing in the morning I was rejoicing amen hallelujah because then it's not just the thoughts of man but it's God revealing something to us you see Adam did not fall yes but to go after Eve he left his glory like Jesus Christ left his glory and came down to SP e hallelujah hallelujah because he had another glory in mind he wanted Eve yes amen hallelujah and Jesus Christ knew that when he is put to the grave and Rises up amen out of his side comes a spiritual Eve amen thank you Lord hallelujah yes Lord you say Adam sinned no Adam became Sinn so that Eve might be saved and Jesus Christ hanging on a tree amen became sin cursed and judged upon a cross so that you and I can be saved amen amen hallelujah so you see Eve had to be under a headship and as soon as she came out of a headship she lost her glory amen now the prophet tells us now I know you ladies don't like this kind of preaching but sister you are dead wrong in what you're doing the Bible forbids you to cut your hair God gave it for a covering he gave a command for you to wait long it is your glory when you cut your hair you signifi that you left the headship of your husband like Eve you walked out and went on your own you got the vote you took men's jobs you left off being Fe you see when you leave the headship the woman now starts to have her own way like Queen vasti We heard in the morning and the prophet says you ought to repent and come back to God a man that's ashamed to stand in the pulpit and tell God's truth when he knows that it's an immoral thing now watch the kind of words the prophet uses he says it's an immoral thing for a woman to cut her hair the Bible a man's got a right to leave his wife and give her a divorce when she cuts her hair so you say it's not serious the prophet says a man is entitled to divorce his wife if she cuts a hair why because when she cuts a hair she dishonors her head and the prophet said no dishonorable woman should be lived with because she cuts off her glory see it's a serious thing now I don't want you to focus so much on the natural l I'm I'm trying to type it out with the spiritual and when the church has cut off her glory notice I said when the church has cut off her glory because in the book of Acts God sent his glory down amen the Holy Ghost fill the church amen so the glory came down in the book of Acts it was a glorious Church yes amen the holy ghost in a glorious Church operating at such a glorious height it was almost as every believer was like a William br in that day amen that's at what level that church was operating at but then the church was stripped of its glory in NAIA and how was she stripped of her glory when she replaced the Holy Spirit who was the headship of the church with a pope and in so doing she Dishonored her head and she was stripped of her [Music] glory and then what what happened when she was stripped of her glory there was a thousand years of Dark Ages and church history no power no glory in the church only church religion church denomination Church organizations but no glory in the church but then comes the last day messenger amen and in an age of gross darkness by faith he draws a little light on the drawing board yes amen when he sees an age of gross darkness when there was not even any light he draws a little glimpse of light on the board and he prophesies that this will be a glorious church amen a super race an invincible Army Amen in his ministry he introduced back the shakina glory into the church amen and why did he do this because remember the prophet was like Moses then the angel tell him as Moses was given two signs so you are given two signs am wasn't Moses given the word just like the prophet was given the word the pull of fire followed Moses just like the prophet so it was only F if Moses saw the Shak glory of the Lord that William gram also in the end time could reveal the sh glory of the Lord amen did not the prophet preach a uh the message are greater than Solomon is here and if the sh Glory could fill the temple in the days of Solomon how much more now and a greater than Solomon is here in fact when Shak Glory himself has come down yes amen you see Paul said I espouse you as a chased virgin to Christ and he thought us the headship who is the head of the church and William brandom come again and he showed us that we should not follow the leadership of man of denominations of the Pope and all of these systems he exposed the systems and he introduced us back to our headship amen he said that's our Lord up there am Hallelujah he brought us back to our right headship why it was the head coming down to unite with the body amen because when the wife comes under her proper headship again and she honors a headship then the glory returns amen you see the glory of the church has returned yes it was lost but it but it has returned why because we are not coming under the right headship the body is foly framed uniting with the head amen the prophet say she'll be so much like him yes as she approaches his coming amen now if you're not under headship if you are not being led by the angel of the Lord who is the Holy Ghost in Angelic form then you are dishonoring your head amen you have no glory you are cutting off your glory like Queen vasti was cut out from sharing in his glory because she Dishonored her head you see people are not connected with the Holy Ghost and if you're disconnected with the from the Holy Ghost how how then can you be a glorious Church how then can you live a glorious life if the glory itself is not living in you you see many people are still under the headship of a prophet or under the headship of some man or some pastor but you got to come under the headship of Christ am you see 60 years ago when the prophet was here it was okay you say you know being under the prophet is the same as being under the under Christ no no sir 60 years ago when the prophet was here then you could say that because Christ was veiled in a prophet 60 years ago it was the a son of man revealing the son of man so 60 years ago you look to the prophet you see Christ expressed but now when the prophet has put off mortality and has put on immortality and he cross Dimensions Christ now has to change form yes God is in Mor always changing his M hallelujah amen you see God takes away his man but never the spirit so if God took William brandom away guess what William brandom is no longer expressing Christ upon the Earth am Hallelujah now I want that to I want that to soak in in his proper context amen God takes away the man but never the spirit the spirit has moved on to where to a many membered body Hallelujah now I hope I'm saying that in the right way amen I believe in the prophet I love the prophet amen amen I thank God for the prophet but he is no longer veiling Christ to me amen I'm not come I'm not going to come here week in and week out and try and preach a sermon showing you types and shadows in the Bible of how the prophet was Vindicated amen can you imagine if we came every week here and try to preach and show you how the Bible said Jesus was going to come and die for us you would say brother we already already know that amen you would say brother I already Believe In Christ I've accepted him what good is that going to do for us now you see we know he was the prophet we know he has Vindicated we know he that he revealed the secrets of the Seven Seals and all of these things but what about me I want to hear about me I want to hear what the promises of God says about me I especially don't want to hear about the denominations amen we know they cursed there's no hope for them we heard in the morning queen V could no longer come into the presence of of the king hallelujah amen the prophet said I think it was in 55 or 54 he said I refuse to pray for America anymore they gone amen so we want to hear about us why because God is in Mor he's changed masks he's not in a many membered body amen you see we want to hear about the super race yes we want to hear about the super church that I'm a off Hallelujah you know when you're witnessing don't go tell people the first thing do you know that God sent a prophet because then they asks you okay where is this Prophet from you say no he's from America okay and where can we know he he died about 50 years ago the people will think you mad in your head but you should rather start off by telling them this did you hear that God has a body upon the Earth amen did you hear that God has a super race that's not expressing his glory upon the Earth that's expressing the very image of God that's how you start off not with history with present tense amen hallelujah amen God is revealing his glory to a people because a people has come under the right headship amen amen you see the church as we said is the female under the headship and if we are not under the headship and if we are not LED of the Holy Spirit we cut off our glory amen notice the scripture says in in in Corinthians uh that we read 11: 10 for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels so when a woman has long hand she has a glory she's under the headship she has of Glory it's linked to a realm of the Unseen World amen it's link linked to a realm where there's Angels at attendance didn't we speak a few weeks ago in Isaiah when he has caught up into the glory Realm of the Lord God and he seen the glory of the king he said he's trained fill the temple amen he started to see Holy Angels amen why because he saw the glory of the Lord and where the glory of the Lord is the angels of God are present amen the angels of God are in attendance and we've heard and we've preached through the weeks that God sends his angels as ministering Spirits Hallelujah he sends Raa he sends you need healing he sends an angel to offer that to you if you need provision he sends an angel to attend to that need amen amen but to those who are under headship and under a glory anointing yes you see when the church is filled with the glory the Unseen World is at attention amen why because here stands a woman under the correct headship filled with glory amen you think the Lord has not given his angels charge over you ministering Spirits it amen amen hallelujah you see we we have to stop reading our Bible like a closed book we read chapters like First Corinthians we only think about the woman and condemn the woman but what is the hidden meaning amen you see but you sisters amen also pay attention because as we said before it's not a small thing you think it's a small thing if you just Trim in your hair here and there but the prophet says a man can actually divorce his wife for it and angels are at attendance when you have your hair long that's what the Bible says amen so don't think you can get away with it amen now I'm not preaching to the sisters yeah now we got good sisters here I'm preaching to the streaming audience you see it doesn't matter now who you s to me whether you saw some pastor's family trim their ha or you saw the prophet's family do it it doesn't matter this is the standard no one's family is the standard this is the standard hallelujah amen why it's typing the church yes under headship now you know all that was just to build a foundation because here's where where I want to get to to try and build up to a climax let's let's just go to the story of Samson for a while and we know Samson lived in the days of the judges right yes and he was the seven judge and we know that there were seven Church ages and whenever each each messenger sounded his trumpet we know it declared why the prophet tells us because to those who received the message it was mercy and Grace to those who refused to receive it it was judgment amen you see the days of judges and we know in the days of the seventh angel when the mighty Angel descends seven angels form the week of his judgment amen yes the age of the Supreme judge now Samson was a Nazarite and a to be a Nazarite means they were separated for a holy consecration unto the Lord you see we are separated for a holy consecration unto the Lord number six tells us in verse 5 all the days of the vow of his talking about a Nazar right now all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be filled in the which he separated himself unto the Lord He Shall Behold holy and shall let the locks of his hair of his hair grow and remember we laid the foundation in Corinthians the hair types the glory and by keeping the hair was a glory unto a woman a sign of submission to headship but to and to Samson it was a sign of his Consecration and vow to his God so long as he kept his hair and no razor came upon his head it was a sign of his Consecration and to God and so long as he was separated and consecrated unto God he is full of glory amen full of Power full of the anointing and notice what the prophet says he says and also Samson when he met those Philistines did you ever think of that why Samson they've gotten pictured as a man having shoulders like bondor well it wouldn't be no secret to find a man like that could pick up a lion and tear him in two you see the denominational world but Samson and the prophet says forgive me for this expression I'll just make it like he was a little curly haired shrimp just a little mama's boy seven little curls hanging down and you remember he was a weakling until the spirit of the Lord came upon Him amen you see the church is weak until the spirit of the Lord comes upon it amen the prophet says did you ever think take that old dry Jawbone off the desert there and strike one of those helmets why that jawone would go into a thousand pieces but he stood there and threw them steel helmets them with Spears just beat them right and left till he beat down a thousand the rest of them he run in the Rocks what was it as long as he could reach back there and F them Seven Locks that was God's covenant there wasn't nothing going to bother him as long as he had the Covenant promise amen and nothing can bother the Church of the Living God as long as we can feel the Holy Ghost the Covenant of God's word in our hearts the Pentecostal blessing for the works that I do shall you do also the life that's in me will be in you as the father had sent me so sent I you the father that sent him come in him then the Jesus that sends the man goes in the man it isn't the man it's Jesus it wasn't Jesus it was God as the father sent me so send I you amen going on down as long as I can feel the spirit of God around something is going to happen I can see people that will believe it that will reflect the Praises and glory of God now are you one of them he says I can see people that will believe it and that will reflect the Praises and glory of God you see Samson where he got his power from where he got his glory from he was consecrated he was a Nazarite consecrated unto a holy consecration to God thank you and his hair was a sign of his glory now the prophet says Samson was weak in stature But Not only was he weak in stature Samson was also weak in the flesh you see Samson was a man of many failures we don't sometimes we don't look at that because we always looking at the great things that Samson did but you if you read in the Bible there it talks about Samson Samson would go in the night and sleep with a harlot and the next morning he will go and he will take the gates and carry all those mens with the anointing and so long as he was doing that Samson was starting to get away from his Nazarite vow he was supposed to be a holy Nazareth consecrated unto God but he started to get away from that he started to sleep around the very Philistines that he was meant to destroy Samson started flooding with them and when Samson started do to do this God just never leave him stay at same the same time you see you see gifts and callings are without repentance amen Samson still have the power now I want to show you the point while Samson was failing in his flesh most probably every day he would realize that he he made a mistake and he would repent and he would confess and the glory never left him as yet but one day when Samson was with Delila now he already knew that dala tried to deceive him three times she tried to trick him trick him three times so now Samson knew what he was doing he was not deceived he knew Delilah was trying to do this but because of his love for Delilah he loved deila more than his secret power you see he started to love Delilah more than his consecration to God yes all along he has failing in the flesh but now he started to betray his own secret power until he gave up his own secret power and when Samson did this he his glory was cut off he sold his butt right oh like Jacob and Esau for a few moments of pleasure he sold his birt right he sold out his glory but you see Jacob was not so yeah Jacob knew what the birthright meant he knew with the birthright come the blessing come the glory come the anointing and Jacob even though he was a deceiver he did everything he could to get the birth right to get the glory to get the anointing amen and when he did that amen he is able to wrestle with angels coming from Heaven amen hallelujah you see when you go after the birth right and you get the glory then you are now negotiating with an Unseen World amen hallelujah so much so that Jacob didn't even want to let go of the Angel amen he wrestled all night with the angel amen you see that is why we need rugged Christians amen they can wrestle with angels amen you need someone who is able to be bold and go into the presence of the King amen you need someone who's be who's able to be bold and go to the mighty Angel and say give me the book amen you see this is the kind of character that God is looking for amen you see everyone else was scared to come into the presence of the king but Esther came amen boldly before the king Jacob was able to wrestle boldly with the angel amen amen but Samson he sold amen his secret power his secret Glory and you see God will be merciful unto you until you cross that line one too many times and then the doors of Mercy are shut you cut off the glory you cut off the presence now I want you to hear that amen maybe God is speaking to someone here today amen stop doing what you're doing God will only let you go by with it for so long but there comes a time when God has to cut the line amen amen don't let it come to that don't sell your secret Glory don't cut off your glory because when you do that what happened as soon as Samson's Glory was cut off the first thing they did was take off his eyes soon as you let your glory get cut off the first thing that happens you start to find fault with the prophet you start to find fault with the message then you want to leave the message why the eyes are taken off amen hear the whining of the Lord whoever this is stop what you're doing come back to the glory of the Lord don't sell your glory short you see I wonder if we in the message if we've allow the glory of the Lord to be cut off and whether we whether we've come out from the right headship what is the headship the headship is the holy spirit in the church again and if the holy spirit is not leading the church you're under the wrong headship you most probably under the headship of a of a man and so long as you're not under the headship of the Holy Spirit there is no glory in the church yes amen he forsook his Nazarite vow but very quickly coming to a conclusion if you read numbers I want you when you go home read number six which talks about a Nazarite and it says when a Nazarite is consecrated unto the Lord and for some reason he is defiled for any some reason he is defiled with sin or inequity or something that is Unholy there's a process to come back read number six it says that as soon as this happens he's now his head must be shaven he must reconsecrate his life back to God the priest need to offer up the sacrifice for him there must be a sacrifice he must reconsecrate his life back to God then now he can be a Nazarite again consecrated unto God so you see the church that has cut off the glory now if we want to come back under the right headship we got to come under the consec now what did we do last year you got to come back to consecration you got to come back to the right headship for the glory of the Lord to come back amen and when Samson did this now whilst he's in in the house of the Philistines now he started to remember who he was he started to remember who he was and he started to consecrate himself again he said Lord he started to repent he said Lord if I could just put my hands on these pillars and now he started to remember what his purpose was see before he forgot his purpose his purpose he was born to slay the Philistines but he started to fraize with the Philistines but now he's remembering his purpose and you see we we were born to be powerful people in the end time to slay every demon power Amen to bring bring everything under subjection to the power of our word but now we find ourselves Straton ising with the things of the world but now remember our Consecration and say once more just once more Lord amen if I could just put my hands back on the two pillars of the Old Testament and the New Testament of the oil and the wine amen oh Lord if I can just do that I can slay the fullest times amen and L Samson said I will die with them Lord I will die to this flesh and in so doing I can slay every demon power amen when the glory of
