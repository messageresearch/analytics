amen get you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen good to see everyone it's just two maggies [Music] before you leave amen so good to see everyone back in the house of the Lord amen no other visitors we have here amen we're all part of the family of God this morning you can get everyone is well hey man I'd like to speak this morning on the angel of the Lord is on earth now amen amen amen that's a direct quote the angel of the Lord is on earth now amen Hallelujah we are fixing and moving into a time now forget about the commercialization of Christmas yes forget about all of those things Christ was born and the court goes on to say the angel of the Lord is on earth now fixing everything for the coming of the Lord amen everything now if you can see him working in Russia if you can see him working with the United Nations you can see him working with the Pope he is working with his people above measure than them because destruction is waiting to hit the earth and he must move us and fix us into a place where we are ready to leave the Earth a many many men so amen Hallelujah maybe asking something wrong am I missing something show me something in the scripture Jesus Christ just like our Elita was hunting a prophet is led by the angel of God amen amen I'm gonna read everything amen he's not coming before the bride and let's read from verse 27. amen listen Lord that's the Abraham were not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth I being in the way the Lord led me to the house of my Master's brethren and the dancer ran and told her mother's house these things so she's running back amen and it came to pass when he saw the earrings and bracelets upon his sister's hands and when he heard the words of Rebecca's sister saying that's the man does make the manner to me that came unto the man and behold well and he said come in it's not without for I am for the camels I'm trying to get to the point where I want to read okay let's go to verse 40. so now Abraham is trying to explain Eliza is trying to explain today's journey and all of these things this is the verse I want to get to and he's telling Laban and the bread now he's telling the denominations right that's what he's doing because what did Rebecca try to do initially she told him in verse 25 we have enough straw and preventing enough and room to for you to Lodge him she was trying to get Elisa to join the lodge all right to come in and take part of the denominational affair but he said let the woman become with me release her immediately so then they go now and they asked the brother and now in verse 40 we read this and he said unto me the Lord before whom I walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shall take your wife my son of my king and of house right so they the Lord sending that is a very you may be Civic sorry amen a very important scripture because it's deep [Music] the exact same scene Jesus Christ again sent a prophet a mighty prophet in this age to hunt him a bride one that's coming out of denominationalism one out of the latest Union Church age okay now we're going to background this and we're going to show you amen how the angel of the Lord fixed things for the first coming amen because we are at the second coming no the angel of the Lord remember four to five hundred years at the past since Malachi's prophecy that I'm going to send Elijah the prophet so four to five hundred years passes by and they silence no moving of God nothing but suddenly the angel of God comes to a priest in the temple Zacharias now remember God always has a nature and the way he does things so this is the same yesterday today and forever because he could have allowed Mary and Elizabeth to produce children without informing them or telling them anything the Holy Ghost could have been overshadowed Mary she would have wanted on Earth did I get pregnant he didn't have to reveal and fix things for the first coming of the Lord but the angel of the Lord appeared and was fixing things for the coming of the Lord so he comes to Zechariah in the temple and he tells him that Elizabeth is going to be a son first he's fixing the Forerunner hmm amen he's setting into motion because John the Baptist was a son of man and when he's standing at the bench of Jordan he's revealing thee son of man Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world so he is fixing things he's coming to zechariah's in the temple and he's revealing to him that you're going to have a son Elizabeth in our old age is going to Bear son and you're going to call his name John and he gives them a sign because Zechariah didn't believe it he said you're going to go down right I'm trying to refresh your memory with all of these events but it's the angel of the Lord fixing things for the first coming then he comes to Mary Angel of the Lord comes to Mary and he greets her you know he greets a hell Mary blessed are thou amongst all women and he tells her now what is this he is modern events are going to be made clear by prophecy the angel coming to Mary was a modern day event but he's going to make it clear by bringing to pass a zionized prophecy that a virgin shall conceive [Music] amen Now watch how the angel of the Lord appears in different ways to different people he comes to zecharias in the temple he comes to Mary physically but do you know the angel of the Lord can appear to you in another form because the angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream okay you'll find that in Matthew 1 20. it says while he thought of these things the angel of the Lord appeared upon him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for death which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost now yes we really need to get spiritual it's because we are going to bed dreaming about the KFC that we got left over in the fridge and now we nobody else must take it when we wake up in the morning if we want to experience the spiritual things of God we must anticipate it yes did you have you got all the scripture what does it start with while he taught on these things you're going to bed young men and you're thinking I wish I get a chance to kiss this girl maybe kiss is going too extreme right we don't believe in kissing maybe I wish I get a number a phone number but what is Joseph thinking about amen why he thought on these things amen behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him no doubt other angels can appear to you if you think on worldly things they are demon Spirits they are Fallen Angels you think on worldly things those demon powers will come to you as well they'll come to you in a dream as well they'll come to oppress you sometimes they come and try and choke you know amen so we're watching the nature of this Angel and the way he was fixing and moving things for the first coming of the Lord so notice now we said he is appearing to them physically he's appearing to them in a dream amen then we learn that he also can appear and reveal something to you personally that's not even in Scripture [Music] you will have no scriptural backing to tell the world exactly that you're waiting for the coming of the Lord and my type for that is similar in the temple Simeon had a personal word from the Lord that you will not see death until you see the Lord's Christ amen he had no scriptural begging to tell him hey get into the scripture I'm not gonna die it was revealed to him personally amen the same way this message is revealed to you personally that this is your guaranteed ticket out of this world how do you know this message is going to take you out and give your body change it's been revealed to me personally I shall not see death until I have my body changed amen thank you amen many many men oh bless the name of the Lord amen hallelujah now we know the angel of the Lord is fixing things and then he sends them on the way with these messages one is going to conceive of the holy ghost Elizabeth is going to conceive yes Simeon he's not going to see death till he sees the Christ also Anna in the temple all waiting for the coming but the angel is fixing things now it comes to pass that Elizabeth conceives she Bears John and six months later here Jesus is born our lord Jesus you know the story how he is born in a sinking stable but watch how they now watch how the the angel is moving and fixing things he wants Jesus to be born in Bethlehem amen so he raises up a decree he causes a political disturbance you watch how the angel is fixing things now because of the a a a religious disturbance a political disturbance that they must go into a specific every man was going to the town that he was born to be taxed amen but it's still the same Angel fixing things amen amen so now they leave and they go to Bethlehem then Jesus is born in a stable it was the angel who fixed that there wasn't any room in the Inn right because he needed the lamb to be born where Lambs are born amen the same angel that fixed that appeared to the shepherds in the field and what was the shepherd's message when they finally went the Bible says they went through the stable and they saw the Lord's Christ over there brother Brandon preaches why it had to be Shepherds only Shepherds could identify the lamb amen high priest would not want to go down to that stinking stable it would have been too undignified for him to go there he would have said I am a priest that must be adorned in in the most glorious apparel of the day and no unclean thing must touch me because I need to go into Temple worship so it had to take shepherds in the field who knew how to identify lamb [Music] amen amen he was not afraid of that smell and when they saw it the Bible says the Shepherds got to work and they began to testify and tell them around of this great and glorious events and why what was the angel what was the shepherd's message the prophet tells us their message was Messiah is on earth now amen amen they began to Proclaim that message this Messiah that you are looking for the great deliverer is on earth now the one that Moses prophesied is on earth now it was a modern day event and they were making it clear by Vindicated prophecy but the message was not heard by the religious people we find two years later wise men following the star Jesus is now two years old they inquiring they're making an announcement where is he born King of the Jews no doubt this message was alarming to everything and the religious leaders and even probably the citizens of the country because they were unaware that the promised Messiah was on Earth at the time amen what is all this commotion what is all this noise talking about a messiah amen but here they are angel of God fixing things throws up a star leads the wise men all the way to Jesus and you know that they offer him amen gold frankincense and Mum now along the way we tried to get to this point on Wednesday that we should never stop and put a full stop when God is fixing things and moving us to take us away from this Earth [Music] amen Mary could have denominated around the idea when Jesus was born in that stable that this is the coming of the Lord and put a full stop right there but Jesus in a in a form of a baby was not what was prophesied when I'm talking about Redeeming the world paying the price for Redemption he wasn't going to do it as a baby but that was the first process of the coming of the Lord amen follow my thought now when he was two years old those wise men could have denominated form the denomination we have found the Messiah this is the coming of the Lord they could have denominated around that idea when they found him preaching in the temple at 12 years old wasn't all this the coming of the Lord 12 years old he's still preaching they could have denominated and said look at the 12 year old boy such intelligence such Brilliance to know the scriptures let's form a denomination he has already come yes amen amen John at the Jordan River when Jesus is a 30 year old man coming and he's saying Behold the Lamb of God John could have said I saw the spirit of God descend upon him I baptized him in fact John tried to start his own denomination the Apostle Paul who came to set the church in order had to find those disciples and re-baptize them because they tried to denominate around an idea John was baptizing unto repentance amen amen they could have said in those days the disciples we have seen him Healing The Sick raising the dead turning water into wine they could have been content with any content amen with any of those stages of Jesus ministry and denominated around it but the complete work of redemption pertaining to the first coming had to be completed what am I telling you there were stages to the first coming yeah amen once the high priest of Israel and the scribes and the Pharisees were preaching Isaiah 9 that a virgin shall conceive the Virgin had already conceived they were preaching it as a future prophecy an event waiting to unfold but this scripture was already fulfilled and it was Now history the Messiah was on Earth amen the first coming was in process everything was that was supposed to happen amen was unfolding he came as a baby he was born amen into this world through a virgin amen the Angel's message declaring that the Messiah is born was not the end of the first coming it's the start or the beginning of the unfolding revelation of the first coming amen Jesus at the temple also didn't tell them put a full stop here when he's reading his eyes 61 that the spirit of the Lord is upon me yes yes amen amen I would like you to when you're talking about redemption's plan there's only one Redemption plan because people get mixed up when you talk about comings it is one Lord Jesus Christ fulfilling the complete Redemption plan okay that's all you got to know he came into the world you know the three times he comes he came to redeem then he comes to take away and then he's coming back with amen so we find here Jesus didn't put a full stop at his eyes 61 he had to go all the way to the cross he had to be resurrected as proof proof Ministry [Music] could have been just a boast yes but he had to prove and back up his word when he said destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up he could have just been opposed didn't the bible say that the other men came and took People Into the Wilderness and they were boasting that they were the Messiah they were final impression Nations rising up amen but early that Easter morning between six and nine amen amen hallelujah there was a Jew sunrise and the SOA Rose from the grave to prove his word amen so true I'm using that as a type and I'm finishing the type now so too the second coming of the Lord has been unfolding the Rapture is a process and the unfolding revelation of the shout the voice and the trumpet of God is still unfolding before us amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen or is worthy to be praised and adored amen now we find a great and glorious event starts the cycle of the second coming amen how does it start there's a lapse again a period of Silence from Azusa Street and then there's no move of God and so one day April amen five o'clock in the morning a baby is born event a type of John the Baptist and the angel of God comes down like to pull our fire into the room to be identified with his prophet amen and he doesn't leave him he's fixing things he's got to have a holy consecrated prophet so as the boy is growing the angel of the Lord comes in a whirlwind in a tree one is carrying water as a seven-year-old boy and he tells him do not drink do not smoke do not commit adultery or defile your body in any way for when you grow up I have a work for you to do what is the angel doing fixing things as a young man when he's tempted to take that cigarette I would take that bottle and drink he would hear that angel come shhh do not smoke do not drink defile your body in any way when you grow older I have a walk for you to do amen so all through his life is hearing the angel of the Lord fixing things preparing for what the coming of the Lord he needs a consecrated vessel because this is a great mystery that son of man was going to be revealed through a human body [Music] God was going to take this man and use him to such an extent that he would confound the religious leaders do you know besides you and I they do not understand his ministry they think he was A Gifted Man which he was but even they testified that there's nobody else who operated in this level they do not understand the son of man was in operation veiled behind a son of man amen so we were looking at now we come to our message are we saying the angel of the Lord is on earth now we know the cycle of the Rapture starts with a shout brother Grandma tell us what is a shout it's a message going forth to gather the living things how is the message coming now this is not a message of a seventh grade education man it's a message from almighty God the world don't know it but the cycle of the Rapture started when Revelation 10 was fulfilled Amen brother Branham tells us that the setting of the scene of the seventh seal is found in Revelation 10. when this Mighty Angel descends from heaven amen this Mighty Angels descends from heaven with an open book with a message with a shout you need to go and read now I think uh says is this the time you need to go read on the wings of a snow white dove you need to go read the seventh seal to understand the property saying the message I've been waiting for all my life he's down at the Ohio river and he hears a voice as John the Baptist was sent to forerun my first coming your message will forerun the second coming so from that was 1933 1933 to 1960 he had no message yet 60 to 63 no message yet until this event happens then he's got a message the opening of the word the revelation of the Seven Seals and he tells you night after night an angel came to me amen if night after night an angel came to me how many seals were there quickly enough Seven Seals how many nights were there seven nights so how many angels appeared to him amen seven angels I'm trying to give you a clue if you can understand what I'm telling you when this Mighty angel Roars like a lion what does the Bible says seven funders uttered their voices is that the scripture amen nobody can identify who those seven Thunders were shame even message people who claim to be going in a Rapture don't know who those seven pandas were when the prophet is clearly telling us these things amen the prophet is telling us in the message but you want it like you want a spoon fed too you don't want to search out the message you don't want to go and read amen let's read now in a time of decision paragraph 27 we'll find here he says now he's taking this type of elieza and he's telling them there it was evening time when he came to the well near the city and it was about that time that Rebecca had to make a decision and he says I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about half an hour no no I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about half an hour how long did the clouds stay up amen was it there before the prophet was there amen amen [Music] come now be spiritual be spiritual about these things I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about half an hour amen firstly to drive over all and believe in the campus morning how many of you believe let's go back to the cloud picture that that's the angel of the Lord what form that cloud seven angels form the hand of Christ he says the seven angels himself was his wig so we know without a shadow of a doubt that with the mighty angel comes seven angels amen [Music] amen some of you feel like you're in higher grade class this morning amen Hallelujah but I want you to know this is the level you ought to be at these things are we ought to know these things it's the most important message denominations cannot preach this message the angel of the Lord is on earth now this was the start of him coming down to the Earth amen so he says he will send his angels before you and make the way clear now listen he says it must have been the angel of God that spoke to Rebecca's heart amen I don't know but in the same scripture Revelation 10 I'm finding an angel of God speak to John amen sing take the book yeah eat the book the same one is telling you how the angel fixed Rebecca's heart to receive Eliza's message is the same one that spoke to us to take Brandon's message amen amen do you think it's because we are smart and educated and we we are super intelligent that we took Brandon's message the angel of God said and he fixed it this is the Vindicated prophet of the age amen let me tell you that's where many people have a problem because if you can accept the prophet of the age you won't have a problem accepting his teaching yes you cannot sympathize with the message and accept certain teachings of the message and finding hard to swallow because you have doubt about the messenger Amen in spiritual food in due season the prophet is telling you the messenger and the message is won yes amen amen that is why it's easy for us to believe that he's the seventh angel message to believe every word that he spoke without doubting or questioning so it must have been the angel of God that spoke to Rebecca's heart and told her go get the water and Rebecca came to the Water of Life at evening time [Music] amen now watch he says here it's the time that the angel of the Lord in his Supernatural is revealing himself to the Rebecca the Bride of Isaac he's saying it's time now it's the time the angel of the Lord in his Supernatural is revealing himself to the Rebecca the Bride of Isaac she moved to the Waters of life now watch you say where is the Angel of the Lord show me yes brother Branham the angels of the Lord the angel singular the angel of the Lord is in the message but I reject the message who you rejecting some of you are cutting the angel of the Lord yeah every week you're cutting it Angel of the Lord you're cutting him you're clipping his wings you think the angel's wings is too Buffy amen what he says here the angel of the Lord in the message [Music] Goes Forth and who's who's you know what booing is is winning a lot Rebecca to come to the Waters of life amen yes moving up the spiritual Supernatural amen that's what it is amen so the angel of the Lord that's no different because if you know who the angel of the Lord is that's no different from saying if you blaspheme the Holy Ghost because the angel of the Lord hears the Holy Ghost amen yes that we are not unitarians we don't believe the angel of the Lord is God Almighty and then we got a Holy Ghost and then we got a father and then we got a son it's the same God changing form facing things amen so the angel of the Lord is in the message watch how we treat the message what is the message the shout what are we saying the angel of the Lord is in the shout amen many many men watch you say can I see the angel of the Lord move he all just heard a testimony a short while ago man he has the prophet confirming this now can I see the angel of the Lord move let's find this now amen you've got time of decision amen amen I want to go to the sports it says here no more than your heart goes to hungering you can find this around paragraph 28 time of decision you got two amen we're not true in this year 11th of the sixth amen left of the sixth you found it let's get to know more than your heart goes to Hungary and thirsty watch now if you don't think the angel of the Lord can move watch how you fix this quote to time with the testimony now okay you'll find it just after paragraph 28 it says yeah I think it's around 28. yeah it is there he says no more than your heart goes to hungering and thirsting for God some kind of a holy ghost Revival will break out somewhere something will take place a neighbor will get healed and come tell you about it amen thank you Lord amen thank you something will take place to let you know that the angel of the Lord is a moving amen amen sister Christina will receive a healing [Music] amen many of you can testify if you're healing a supernatural event happened in your home he says something will take place to let you see that the angel of the Lord is a moving so don't say these guys are Fanatics and weaken and weak out the preaching about an angel of the lord I can't see him moving who do you think is fixing things amen who do you think is there the angel of the Lord and tempered them around them that fear Him yes amen he said we need to get our eyes off of physical things we got to open up our spiritual eyes and understand that we Are Spiritual Beings we are Sons and Daughters of God and the angels of God around us wherever we go smart right it's correct amen you see I'm gonna say it this way even if the people around brother Jennifer even the brother Jeff didn't know anything what was doing the angel of God was fixing them yes amen wonderful thank you Lord he allows you to pray for somebody yes he allows you to speak to somebody amen speak don't know your peace yes you get a pull of God Amen the angel of God wants to use you silence him that's right amen the angel wants to Roar through you thank you 29. why did Rebecca make such a sudden move why are you walking so suddenly why are you doing this participation bring somebody to church last week why angel of God fixing things amen something urged him invite the brother or that brother contacted him I want to come to church amen maybe you heard something that he'll have to testify on the day of judgment because the Bible says that every man must hear the truth or at least once and I think brother sunny dished out some fireworks last week amen amen why did Rebecca make that sudden move why did she go into the Waters of life so quickly why could the Angels speak to her yeah it is she was a blood relation to Isaac that's who the angel can speak to tonight is a blood relation aren't you glad that we have blood relation to the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why we can identify the angel of God is on earth now you say oh you bunch of Fanatics what are you talking about I want to go to the other message Church they don't talk about angel of God and you're trying to create some Supernatural move of God God will die go to some Lodge where they are not expecting the angel to fix things for the coming of the Lord amen not only do they share the same blood the blood of Jesus Christ is Sanctified through the blood amen he says an open vessel for the Holy Ghost to speak to you no wonder she'll come to the Waters of life he that he that here and let him come to the Waters of Life freely watch their language now the bride as a message and she says come just let him come amen blessed are you when you hung your thirst for righteousness you shall be filled amen what are we learning the spirit and the bride are saying come they have the same voice they have the same message they have the same Ministry their messages come amen amen you'll read this impact that this bride Works quickly she made the decision quickly you left your denomination quickly you left all religions quickly amen hallelujah he took you one service and you said goodbye to denominationalism it took you to read one message and you said goodbye oh Hallelujah we can testify every happening here in this church you came to one meeting you didn't go back to your denomination you didn't give the time to reason amen they came to floods with you after death you kissed your mother-in-law goodbye you kiss that old chat system goodbye amen because you representing Ruth other people could have come with you like they went with brother Joshua they went two by two to the library only one received it amen when you can hear my savior calling I can hear my savior calling the strange workings of the angel of God wooing his people fixing them moving them getting them in line amen he says there's something in the message that stirs him that's what stirred Rebecca the message stirred up oh how I want some nice intellectual preaching that will stir my heart the we the brother must take this with this and this and this I like eloquent speech who is this guy I can't destroy your sentence together they want eloquent speech but he says there's something in the message that stirred them the message stirred up and he says Angel was leading up oh can't you see the picture the angel of the Lord leading up then she was stirred and immediately she walked the camel the gift went amen amen [Music] the moment you receive the message of the hour amen you received a gift you received an anointing what is he typing with elieza put the gifts on her he put the gifts on them he put the bracelet he put the hearing he said why why did he put the physical hearings which means Faith cometh by the hearing you see put the bracelets on the bracelets signify the works of your hands he got you ready and as soon as you begin to water give the Waters of Life testify to others get the message out tell them what has happened to you amen amen amen he says brother listen there's no time to linger it's time to make the decision what kind of an effect has the message had on you ask yourself now what kind of an effect has the message made on you let's go to 34. you're hearing the message of the hour preached to you amen by God's help we're trying to preach it in his purity amen that's what the ministry is aiming to do and endeavoring to do preach it in his Purity not to take man's ideal intellectualism not to take a man-made Theory we are trying to stay true to the message of the hour amen he says he's on your your hands tonight like he was on pilot of hold it's later than you think what decision will you make now when you see his Angel moving see the message come Jesus is coming soon amen why are you saying that bro I just got promotion I took a 30-year Bond my son just got married I want to see my grandchildren in some people's hearts no longing to see the lovely Lord Jesus Christ the one who physically hung for them yes they say Lord we just satisfied you again spiritually don't come no more physically they are no better than the Tunis because the tool is saying when they see Jesus Christ with his nails cut hands they'll know he is not God it's the spirit in him I'm gonna say it this way but forgive me some people are going to take the message book to heaven And when they see the Lord Jesus they're going to say I got my message is here they're more in love with the Written Letter than to see the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] I hope you get my thought I'm not mean to be sacrilegious you must love the message of the hour I'm trying to bring a point there is a physical coming of the Lord is a physical uniting yes people want to spiritualize everything he says when you see his Angel moving see the message come Jesus is coming soon it's an angel message they've been preaching it for two thousand years since he left but he is coming amen amen I want you to know he's only been gone two days in his time Jesus has been gone two days watch now quotes I picked up this quote and I was so blessed with this the angel of God is here on Earth going before it the servants performing signs and wonders just like Jesus said he would do and he's here now you see all of you who said amen right now you're about to receive the greatest blessing to ever you desire right now because you are testifying exactly how we actually write testified Society will not come super spiritual woman basically she was saying Amen to brother Brennan when he was testifying about squirrels she said that's exactly right which is another word for amen thank you and the angel of God came down and he said you can ask that you write anything she desires right now the same angel of God that's here right now amen amen Grant you the desires of your heart the sick can be healed that slide is restored amen not only backsliders but if you need the salvation of your loved ones step into the faith of at you right this morning and call for your loved ones amen for the Salvation of your loved ones I give it to you in Jesus name amen yeah amen the angel of God is here on Earth going before the servants performing signs and wonders just like Jesus said he would and he's here now you say oh this angel of God what now what nationality is he is whatever nationality you chooses to speak to you right now he's speaking to you to an Indian man yeah tomorrow you can speak to you through a black man through a white man to a Chinese man makes no difference yes amen Hallelujah amen let's get to 35 now he says oh Lord you see them you know them let the Holy Spirit now bring that Rebecca to the Waters of life where the cooling refreshing comes the presence of God shall bathe their hearts Souls bring them unto their new life A New Hope let the angel of God who has been sent before the message speak the blood relation that's been bought by the precious Christ [Music] don't miss that point now he says let the angel of God who has been sent before the message [Music] you are blood relation he's speaking to you right now you know oh there's there's a lot of us here right now but you know that tag in your heart is speaking to you some of you can feel it right now do you know the angel of God is speaking directly to you you know your blood relation to the Lord Jesus Christ amen now watch he comes denominational world don't know about a shout a voice and a trump being a process over a time and it starts with a prophet's message starts with the angel coming down to give the prophet a message because before Revelation 10 7 is revelation 10 1. the mighty angel coming down he's the one that reveals the mystery secrets to Revelation 10 7. yes we take it now from Revelation 10 7 and we are prophesying again but they don't know that Revelation 10 1 was the shout right they don't know that it started in 1963. I said started in 1963. not finished yet the prophet of God will go on to say now we commend them to thee that are at the meeting time when the church meets Jesus in the way and we believe that is already left the father's house and he's on the road to the Earth he does all three things as he's descending right why are you going quiet you don't like the prophet he's already left the father's house and he's on his Road yes he's on his way and he's in the fields of the great beyond out in the fields meditating and the bride making herself ready and soon should be on her way [Music] the scripture says that we'll meet the Lord in the way amen [Music] somebody will only meet him in the world the scripture says that we'll meet the Lord in the way he's already left and coming after his right let us be ready for this may be the last call the evening time is here I commit them unto their hands and I keep him Lord through Jesus Christ we ask it and give to you the tokens of the message now that's what we are right the tokens of the message amen so if you clock that last point there the prophet says that Jesus had left the father's house already and he started to make his descent he shall descend with a shout so he's descending with a shout and then he said the bride is making herself ready now we're going to go to amen another message here the marriage of the Lamb or maybe we can just go to my slide I think we'll find a day easier paragraph 53 he says we know that there's going to be a bride there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's a sure to be as God is right we know that those things are going to make up that bride is going to be his church they're going to appear before him without spots and wrinkle now here's the point I want to get to let's move up this slide he says they have the material on earth now let's get up to the next slide amen if you got the quote you can get go to the court and move to the next slide amen I need to get this point how do you make yourself ready he says they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice it said she made herself ready hmm let me ask you another way do you do you have we need to move past it sliding man I think uh just back No No Yeah there isn't there and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice it she made herself ready so I'm asking you do you have the material the message of the hour are you using it to make yourself ready amen okay good that you answered 9 54 if you got that quote I want to get to this because this is more to encourage you that sometimes you want to leave things first and we want to fix our lives first and you know many people say that oh when I make myself write to the Lord then I'll serve him yeah you're the prophet now so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or scambling from lying or stealing I'll serve him he says but that's up to you you've got to do something a day that will overcome shall he never to all things they must overcome so you are waiting for the Lord to take away drinking you are waiting for the Lord to take away gambling he says You must do something [Music] because you've got to overcome you've got to apply the token you've got to invite the Holy Ghost in amen he says you have the power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down [Music] she has made herself ready he says I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe put us out the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh then you have nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you have got to make a decision for yourself I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God Amen Abraham was promised a child but he must maintain This Promise for 25 years the ups and the Downs that he had the Temptations in those 25 years but he held to hell to the promise oh glory be to God some of us have been holding on longer some of us have been holding on to the promise for 40 years amen we always admire the faith of Abraham but look how long you've been in in this world and in year in the shout and waiting for the promise coming of the Lord amen waiting for the going away of the church waiting for the body change your years have passed 25 years you've had your ups and downs like Abraham amen you've had your Temptations but you're holding on to the promise of the world Amen he says in 58 Israel was promised that Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of ground whatsoever The Souls of your foot tread that have I given you God said to Joshua the land was there God gave it to them but they must fight for it thank you the whole Windows of Heaven is full of Bountiful blessings but some of you need to open up the windows how you open it up by praying but trusting the Lord fight for every inch of ground it says that's the same way it is about Divine Healing God has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it [Music] but you'll have to fight every inch of the way God has got Amazing Grace to save you he will do it but you'll fight every inch of your way he says I've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly has we must fight if we must Reign so we find that the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight that those so easily beset us we must run with patience yeah in the message a calm down next slide he says Christ is on earth now in the form of the holy spirit in its fullness trying to get you away from these Earthbound things to lift you up into his presence [Music] amen we are looking for a kingdom and a king to come Amen brother Graham says what is the kingdom it's on earth now it's a spirit mystical Body of Christ amen amen he says before the Kings comes he steps us together in Heavenly places in Christ we are lifted above all this Corruption of the world Amen Hallelujah we are like bearers in these last days we are here ready to manifest the promised word of the age amen and let's go Amen to this quote you'll find this in the message of the ten virgins and the 144 000. he says in paragraph 94 amen the angel of the Lord is on earth now is moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord and it's the same angels that heard the sin it's the same Angels that's heard the sin when they went down to Sodom so these angels haven't aged the same one that went back there is the same one that's here today now notice only one Angel went stayed with Abraham one stayed with Abraham and the elect in 9605 but the angel that stood with Abraham at his back turned to the tent we've had that same sign yes yes when you're seeing this Prophet turn his back and discern the hearts it's the angel of the Lord don't be fascinated and think it's a Gifted Man it's the angel of the Lord be able to identify who it is man it's the angel of the Lord the one he says how did he know when Abraham was married how did he know Sarah's name how did he know he had a wife amen he says well I've made you a promise you see who the angel was I made you a promise I am going to visit you according to the time of life who is this Angel we're talking about seeing the sign he gave to the elect Church now watching 101 he says a striking thing here he says look we've had all of these great ministers he says after Billy Graham received the Holy Ghost he did not come into here he didn't come into the message yes you know after Billy Graham received the Holy Ghost he could not come out into here he's talking about the message of the hour it's reserved for the deserved even a great bear like Bully Graham couldn't come into the message of the hour yes amen he says that's his feel down there and he recognizes it and God is holding there amen even if they wanted to it's only for the predestinator all that the father has given me will come to me that's powerful yes amen but in one or two he says here was Abraham and his class and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man in 103 he says see those angels will be here on Earth doing the same thing that's what they're doing right now you see that's the reason bully Graham goes to the bed to so forth now you'll find another Baptist what's his name TD snakes and you'll find this other guy uh movement preacher Smiley Joel amen all of them what are they doing he said Jack Schuler all of these great men out there they have what they're doing they're jerking out they've never done Miracles down there just a few but what is their Ministry what did the Angels do they smoke them blind you see what uh Smith is doing you see what Smiley Joel is doing smiting them blind blind every time they preach [Music] people preaching the gospels might stand blind the Bible says so one of four he says but this fellow out here talking about this angel of God now the prophet had a way you know this Kentucky in English he says but this fellow how cheer he done the sign Supernatural sign to Abraham and his Bunch which is church he left amen amen blessed are your eyes for you see in 105 . oh this is powerful now because this now you can type for the current War he says here now in 1914 the world went to war that's the first war right and they have never been at peace since constantly swinging in swinging in swinging in hope you get this and they when he's saying they he's talking about the angel and they're doing the very same thing yet what they was doing holding who's holding back the wings he says oh god of Mercy holding that great thing that I saw in the vision the whole thing becomes to destruction holding the atomic who's holding that atomic holding the walls that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy it until Israel gets returns back and gets herself together and then the message will go to Israel shall be sealed with that Holy Ghost amen amen do you know we've seen the completion of the document that will unite all world religions they signed it in September the document is complete all things are set in order the Beast is rising up risen up look at the political world is fixing and moving now for the New World Order look at the war in Russia Putin he is longing to press that button believe me he wish he can press a button but there's a strong hand holding his hand don't touch a button who's holding as the prophet says something is holding them back it's the angel oh the pope is saying but I've done all my work I've done all I can I've got everything fixed all religions have signed I've got all I've got the Pentecostal of God denominationalism I've got this great highly Church everything is ready but oh I feel so heavy on my head I wish this angel will take his foot off my head [Music] United States don't know what's happening Republican Democrat Republican Democrat president everything fixing Catholic President in there everything ready Catholic President in the time of the Prophet Catholic President in the town of the Bride [Music] everything ready but oh there's an angel standing on my head the same one that descended put his foot on land and sea on the Beast of the two Hill you can't make a move till I say so it's the same means of God fixing things fixing things for the coming of the Lord and he's moving upon your heart right now he wants you to get in line get the word get the revelation of the word what are we saying I need to say this again because I think some of you may be misunderstanding me embrace the message with all of your heart yes the word coming was the most important coming that we could have had to prepare us for the rapture but it's not the end we don't put a full stop amen without the message of the hour without the spoken word without the message amen the shout we won't have faith for rapture embrace the message with everything we have but I want you to move a step further I want you to be like the disciples who every day was led by the angel of God don't step out of your house without knowing the angel of God is going before me you see they talk about economic hard times right now I'm telling you you shall not struggle amen your business shall not struggle in fact you shall see an increase greater while all other people are talking about a lack you shall see an increase amen when they are talking about economic hard times and they are struggling the Lord will keep you in that hour of Temptation amen let's stand together give the Lord a good example kills amen the angel of the Lord is on earth now fixing things moving things my advice to you is when the angel is moving move with the angel amen you know that man at the water when the angel of the Lord is going to go into that water he wasn't even ready he was waiting for someone to carry him in if he was really serious about his healing he would have waded in the water because he knew the angels of the Lord comes around a specific time in a season take many many men oh I want you to go and pond upon these things now remember how Joseph pointed upon those things and who came to him the angel of the Lord now I challenge you I don't know someone's gonna come back to me and testify about this I challenge you Ponder upon him and say Lord I've heard that you are on earth now the angel of the Lord is on earth now won't you come to me he had come to you in a dream he'll come to you in a vision
