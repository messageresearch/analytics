[12:42] [Music]
[12:47] let's go back to 10 finally my brother
[12:49] and be strong in the Lord and in the
[12:52] power of His might
[12:55] put on the whole armor of God
[12:57] that you may be able to stand against
[13:01] the violence of the devil
[13:03] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[13:06] blood but against the principalities
[13:08] against the powers against the rulers of
[13:12] the darkness
[13:14] and of this world and the spiritual
[13:16] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[13:20] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[13:23] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[13:27] in the evil days and having done all to
[13:31] stand stand therefore having your loins
[13:34] good about good truth and having having
[13:38] on the breastplate of righteousness amen
[13:43] praise the Lord
[13:46] this morning our subject
[13:48] our subject will be
[13:51] who is an extremist
[13:55] a chauvinist
[13:59] is gone
[14:01] oh William Branham
[14:05] now you heard this morning
[14:07] and you hear all the time
[14:10] the people around the world
[14:13] inside
[14:15] to make this message
[14:17] into something like a myth
[14:22] but it is not so
[14:24] we came we have read the scriptures
[14:27] and we found this morning
[14:30] letting the last days
[14:32] meaning
[14:33] they shall become a falling away first
[14:38] and there will be people that will
[14:40] depart from the faith
[14:42] now why would these people depart from
[14:45] the faith
[14:47] and the only reason is they are
[14:49] disgruntled
[14:51] and this kind of people will always have
[14:53] something to say
[14:55] and something not good
[14:58] this kind of people will always have a
[15:00] negative attitude towards anything
[15:03] and we find there's so many discredible
[15:05] people today
[15:07] that had left this message
[15:09] summer has gone said they've been in the
[15:12] message for 10 years some say 12 years
[15:14] some years some say 40 years some say 50
[15:18] years
[15:19] and I want to tell you this morning you
[15:21] can be in this message for 10 years you
[15:24] can sit in this place for 10 years you
[15:27] can sit in this place for 20 years or 50
[15:30] years
[15:33] all you have been told by somebody that
[15:36] this message was the truth
[15:39] and then later on you've been told by
[15:42] somebody that this message is false
[15:45] because you were sitting in this place
[15:47] without a revelation yes amen he was
[15:51] sitting in this place without knowing
[15:54] who you are you were sitting in this
[15:57] place without knowing where you come
[16:00] from
[16:01] all you are doing is to listen to
[16:03] somebody to say this is the truth and
[16:06] then listen to somebody who says this is
[16:08] bonus
[16:10] so what you've been doing you have not
[16:12] been reading
[16:14] you have not been reading your Bible
[16:16] you've never been reading the books
[16:18] you'll never be listening to the tapes
[16:20] but you have been listening to people
[16:22] yes and forming your Doctrine yes and
[16:26] that is why you can say that you know
[16:29] why you were dissatisfied and this is
[16:31] this is not the truth
[16:33] thank you
[16:35] and I can conclude this morning to say
[16:38] if you were living in a garage
[16:41] for 50 years that doesn't make you a
[16:43] Moroccan
[16:46] because we're born in a stable
[16:48] and that didn't make him
[16:50] another makes you a believer
[16:54] so I've seen one clip
[16:57] and when I noticed there very very
[17:00] carefully
[17:01] she's already had a haircut
[17:03] she's already tinted here
[17:06] she's already started using jeans and
[17:08] tackies
[17:10] and she was so disgruntled she said I've
[17:13] been in this message but I've been in
[17:15] this place for 12 years believing this
[17:17] is the truth and somebody comes along
[17:19] and say this is not the truth
[17:23] and then they told her there was
[17:26] something about the cloud
[17:27] the cloud was not real
[17:30] and then there's somebody told her that
[17:32] this Prophet was a false prophet
[17:35] what her problem was
[17:38] because the moment you leave this
[17:40] message
[17:41] you will go into a frenzy and the devil
[17:45] will just take control of you in the
[17:48] message
[17:49] and she went into that mode now to cut
[17:52] her hair change her hair use her pants
[17:54] use the top and stand and say this
[17:57] message is false
[17:59] and then we find
[18:02] that if you find a journalist comes
[18:03] along and say well
[18:06] you know after after examining all the
[18:09] facts
[18:10] and bring through some interviews we
[18:14] find that William Brennan was an
[18:18] extremist
[18:20] and we find William Branham
[18:22] was a chauvinist
[18:26] you know I'll tell you this morning
[18:28] that we will go through the scriptures
[18:30] to find out
[18:31] who was
[18:33] and who is
[18:36] because they will nobody who's there
[18:38] who's a chauvinist he had to defend
[18:40] William Branham neither am I here to
[18:43] defend the gospel
[18:45] because William Branham was born a
[18:47] prophet before the foundation of the
[18:49] world
[18:50] amen he preaches gospel before the
[18:52] foundation of the world
[18:55] and therefore I cannot defend him
[18:58] and you can say how how to how can you
[19:01] say that William Branham was he said
[19:03] before you were formed in your mother's
[19:05] womb
[19:06] I made you a prophet amen
[19:10] and if it was for that Prophet it would
[19:13] be for this prophet
[19:14] because Jesus Christ is the same
[19:16] yesterday today and forever
[19:20] so we find that we cannot defend the
[19:24] Bible is our book like any other thing
[19:27] in the natural a country has its
[19:29] Constitution
[19:30] and the country that has its
[19:32] Constitution will tell you this is the
[19:34] rule
[19:35] and this is a law
[19:37] and if there's no rules and there's no
[19:39] laws there's no punishment
[19:43] there has to be a rule and there has to
[19:46] be a law
[19:47] in order for you to have a punishment
[19:49] so if people tell you now that the Bible
[19:53] because God got lost
[19:55] and God has instructed us to do certain
[19:58] things and not to do certain things
[20:01] if you say the book is not a law
[20:04] then you tell me this morning what is
[20:07] the law
[20:09] thou shall not
[20:10] and thou shalt not you see the cloud
[20:13] people are disputing the cloud
[20:16] they are saying well the cloud
[20:19] was there
[20:20] because some death will pass
[20:24] and that jet went past and made that
[20:26] cloud
[20:27] that was in 1963
[20:30] and in 1963 if that cloud if that jet
[20:33] made that cloud today we have more Jets
[20:37] than 1963.
[20:41] and I've never seen another cloud like
[20:43] that
[20:45] and some people say that Brandon was not
[20:48] there
[20:49] but you find
[20:51] in a quote
[20:58] Robert Brown says
[21:01] and you see
[21:02] where the brand
[21:04] always
[21:05] said something in the presence of two or
[21:08] three Witnesses yes in order to to to to
[21:11] to to to to confirm what he's saying
[21:16] and we find here in the Easter sea
[21:18] you know the funniest thing is
[21:21] you know I Was preparing this message
[21:23] and I was asking the Lord you know what
[21:25] I need to go look for something about
[21:27] the cloud
[21:29] and so I could actually quote
[21:32] and uh while I was thinking about it and
[21:37] I just had this book on the table and it
[21:39] was the Easter seal
[21:42] and then I looked and said no maybe I
[21:45] can find it here yes I did find it there
[21:48] so which means that God Was preparing so
[21:52] I could just find things just easily you
[21:55] know and he said
[21:58] you see I saw seven angels come down but
[22:01] here he says there were other brothers
[22:03] were there you know he said seven angels
[22:06] come down didn't Life Magazine pack it
[22:09] up and ask the Frog of of it floated
[22:12] across yeah 27 miles high and 30 miles
[22:16] across is it not fed short man
[22:21] these others Gene Norman then sitting
[22:25] back there stood right right there when
[22:28] when them seven angels when seven angels
[22:32] appeared right there on the hill it
[22:35] shook the hills for miles around
[22:39] he shook the hill for miles around like
[22:42] that they stood seven angels and throwed
[22:45] a sword in in your hands
[22:48] said go home and open the seven seas
[22:51] that they that are given that are given
[22:55] and there they are
[22:57] true mysteries of marriage and divorce
[22:59] and
[23:01] now you see people don't read
[23:03] and you want to take things from other
[23:05] people
[23:07] and you want to say well
[23:09] it's happening
[23:10] it's happening around us also
[23:13] you see when you start getting involved
[23:15] in gossips when you start getting
[23:16] involved in things like that it becomes
[23:19] a problem because you are not reading
[23:21] the prophet stays saved with the tapes
[23:25] read the books and stay with the books
[23:27] and you will never be wrong
[23:30] I've come into this message in a very
[23:32] very difficult time when there were very
[23:34] few books there were very few people
[23:37] we had to go and search those were
[23:39] difficult times there was no push
[23:40] buttons for us we had no cell phones we
[23:44] had no computers where we could just
[23:47] push there and say okay let's look for
[23:48] this we never had that we came in a
[23:50] difficult time so we had to read and God
[23:53] has blessed us through the Bible says
[23:55] millions of people died
[23:57] people just died
[23:59] young children died
[24:01] babies died
[24:04] with them but the waters covered them up
[24:09] and perish
[24:11] so
[24:12] who was the extremist
[24:15] was no other extremist
[24:17] or was God the extremist
[24:23] you enjoy your conclusion this morning
[24:28] God was giving nobody extra instruction
[24:32] likewise he gave brother Branham the
[24:34] instrument
[24:37] he was given instruction
[24:39] to go out
[24:41] and set the people free
[24:43] Moses
[24:46] we go there to to to to to Exodus
[24:53] Exodus 12.
[24:55] 29
[25:12] foreign
[25:20] Exodus 12 29
[25:26] he came to pass
[25:28] when the Lord smote all the firstborn in
[25:31] the land of Egypt
[25:33] and from the firstborn of pharaoh
[25:36] that sat on his throne
[25:39] and
[25:41] for all the first born
[25:43] imagine the mother is looking at the
[25:45] firstborn child dying
[25:49] we're going to take our uh our talk this
[25:52] morning
[25:53] here was Moses giving the instruction
[25:55] and he was telling them you know what
[25:57] this is what's going to happen
[25:59] and the people refuse to listen to to
[26:02] Moses
[26:03] and then when Moses departed from there
[26:06] when Moses departed from there after
[26:08] that when chepedo eventually set them
[26:11] free
[26:12] I'm sure the people must have been there
[26:15] and say you know Moses Moses Moses was
[26:18] an extremist he killed all our babies
[26:23] that's what he must have told the people
[26:25] must have sent me he was an extremist he
[26:27] killed all our babies
[26:28] our babies all died
[26:30] because of Moses
[26:33] but who is a god of love
[26:36] God is a God
[26:38] that will come to Satan but is a god of
[26:42] wrath also
[26:43] is a jealous God he will not take
[26:46] anything else except what he what he has
[26:50] instructed us to do
[26:51] you cannot even go eat this way or you
[26:54] cannot go that way because God
[27:03] in in the way and when the people head
[27:08] go into the gate through the camp and
[27:11] slay every man his brother word of Moses
[27:14] and they felt of the people that day
[27:17] three thousand
[27:20] now you see when God has given an
[27:24] instruction
[27:25] a people delayed
[27:27] the people saw Moses delay
[27:30] and when people saw Moses delaying what
[27:33] they did they came Falling Away
[27:36] they came falling away because Moses
[27:38] delayed
[27:40] and what the people did they started
[27:41] doing their own things
[27:43] no no no no no no you go into the wrong
[27:46] way
[27:47] and that's exactly what happened when
[27:50] they left when Moses went to bring the
[27:52] Commandments they left the gospel
[27:57] and what happened
[27:58] three thousand
[28:01] men
[28:03] women
[28:04] children
[28:06] everybody
[28:07] oh we're saved
[28:09] oh
[28:12] asleep
[28:15] I want to tell you this morning
[28:17] God's right
[28:20] God is what is dangerous
[28:23] let us not fall into that time
[28:27] and three thousand men die woman
[28:30] who was the next two of us was it Moses
[28:34] was it Moses or was it God
[28:38] it was God's instructions
[28:40] God gave the instruction
[28:42] and it was only carried out by the
[28:45] prophet
[28:47] and so that is why we confirmly stand
[28:50] and say
[28:51] brother Brandon
[28:52] only came the caves
[28:54] is set in the caves
[28:57] set overnight
[28:59] fast to breed
[29:01] came down
[29:03] and opened the word
[29:06] he never just come to the pulpit to
[29:08] preach
[29:09] show me one man
[29:11] show me one man that had such a great
[29:13] ministry
[29:15] one man
[29:16] at that time when brother Brandon was
[29:18] around
[29:19] we are all robots
[29:21] where Billy grabbed him
[29:25] multi-million millions and millions of
[29:27] people were healed
[29:30] millions of souls received
[29:34] but
[29:36] yet you can
[29:38] say
[29:39] that this
[29:42] he died because God called it over
[29:46] to leave the blind
[29:49] to leave the black defend for herself
[29:53] because
[29:54] he was born
[29:56] did he have the premature death he was
[29:59] crucified upside down
[30:03] so let us not play with words
[30:08] God had his work done
[30:10] and it's finished
[30:12] he went home to Glory
[30:15] to meet his wife to meet the Believers
[30:18] out there one of these days we are going
[30:21] to go to Glory
[30:22] are we going to meet
[30:23] [Music]
[30:26] you see that is why sometimes
[30:29] we have to be careful what we do we have
[30:31] to be careful what we say
[30:33] don't get involved with people with
[30:36] unnecessary discussion
[30:38] I've come to a place in my life
[30:41] I said Lord
[30:43] I am here to preach your gospel
[30:46] I'm not here to debate your gospel
[30:50] I'm not here to reason on your gospel
[30:52] I am not here to tell who's wrong and
[30:55] who's right
[30:56] when I finish preaching and let them
[30:59] decide who's right and what's wrong the
[31:01] decision have to be dead
[31:05] so let's move on
[31:09] praise the Lord are you happy that's
[31:12] fine are you with me
[31:14] amen praise the Lord
[31:27] we go to numbers
[31:32] 16 31.
[31:39] you know sometimes the devil
[31:43] he wants to play around
[31:46] especially with the ministers
[31:49] he wants to attack them
[31:52] you want to put them in a frenzy
[31:58] finally always
[32:01] the ministers are attacked
[32:06] and you know when the minister is
[32:07] attacked he knows it
[32:09] he knows because he's being attacked
[32:20] are we find numbers
[32:23] 1631
[32:29] and it came to pass
[32:31] am I right
[32:33] as he had as he had made an end of
[32:37] speaking all these words
[32:40] that the ground claimed in
[32:42] and that was on okay
[32:46] let's go for that
[32:57] okay yeah we find that Moses is now now
[33:01] telling the people listen
[33:03] don't
[33:04] this is dating a quarter
[33:06] right
[33:07] they dated in court
[33:09] they've come in now and they you know
[33:12] started to to to to to start to what you
[33:15] call uh challenge the ministry
[33:19] challenge is the ministry
[33:21] and telling Moses you know Moses you
[33:25] it's not only you that can can can can
[33:28] preach the word
[33:30] it is not only you Moses that can can
[33:34] perform miracles
[33:37] we are from the elliptical order
[33:39] we also can do the same thing
[33:45] and now they didn't call ahead the
[33:47] disagreements
[33:49] you see if I can't sit in a message
[33:50] today we have people have a lot of
[33:52] disagreements
[33:54] but you want to be careful with your
[33:56] disagreements whether they're lining up
[33:58] with the word of God
[33:59] or whether they're lining up with the
[34:01] message
[34:02] or the message in the word of brother
[34:04] Branham you preach the Bible
[34:06] so you've got to see whether you're
[34:08] lining up with your disagreement
[34:11] and here was Dayton and Connor
[34:13] continuing to to fasten and and God is
[34:17] telling him you know what I'll open the
[34:18] ground and swallow these people
[34:20] and mo you see Moses had a spirit of God
[34:24] and you find always the ministers will
[34:26] have a spirit of God in them they will
[34:28] always try to protect you they will
[34:31] always try to stand in the gap for you
[34:34] and that is exactly that was happening
[34:36] and Moses was trying to protect
[34:39] you continue to try and protect them
[34:42] but they wouldn't have none
[34:44] they would have nothing
[34:46] and we find yes see what happened
[34:52] and it came to pass
[34:55] as he had made the end
[34:58] and speaking all these words
[35:00] and the ground cleared asunder
[35:03] and that was under them
[35:05] and the Earth opened up their mouth and
[35:09] swallowed them up and their houses and
[35:12] all the men and all the men and the
[35:18] and all the gods all the goods and they
[35:24] and all that pertained to them went down
[35:28] a light into the pit
[35:31] and the Earth closed
[35:33] upon them and they perished from among
[35:37] the congregation
[35:38] and all Israel that were around about
[35:42] them fled
[35:44] fled at the Cry of them for they said
[35:48] lest the Earth swallow us up also and
[35:51] they came out a fire from the Lord and
[35:55] consumed
[35:57] 250
[35:58] 250 men that offer incense
[36:03] you see
[36:05] they wanted to take the place of the
[36:08] priesthood
[36:12] and that's what happened
[36:14] 250 men God consumed them
[36:18] the rest of them
[36:20] they were called under the ground
[36:22] God swallowed them up
[36:24] and now who
[36:25] Who was the extremists
[36:29] now we're going to call Moses in
[36:30] extremists
[36:34] no
[36:35] Moses was only time to protect him
[36:39] but they wanted to take Moses's place
[36:42] many a time we find the same thing
[36:44] people want to just you see let me tell
[36:47] you something
[36:49] I've been preaching for very very long
[36:50] time
[36:52] and as I'm standing here I'm very
[36:53] nervous
[36:56] I'm very nervous every time I come here
[36:59] I'm very nervous
[37:01] and some people think you know what
[37:04] I can preach better than this mandate I
[37:07] can get there Constantia and could
[37:08] preach
[37:09] I can preach he's losing his words
[37:12] you can't read properly
[37:14] he's losing his words you don't know
[37:16] what to say
[37:17] but I want to tell you something
[37:19] even if you come here to convene for the
[37:22] first time
[37:25] you come here to convey for the first
[37:27] time
[37:28] you're going to have a problem
[37:31] because the spirit of God will never
[37:34] want you to say something wrong
[37:37] and that is why ministers become nervous
[37:40] when they come before the problems when
[37:43] they come to atmosphere
[37:45] so remember one thing amen God is not in
[37:48] the numbers amen God is not in the
[37:51] numbers
[37:53] so we're going to just be careful with
[37:55] that
[37:56] the moment you go in line that is why
[37:58] when the prophet went beyond the curtain
[38:00] of time
[38:01] he went beyond the curtain of time
[38:04] and when he saw the bride going out of
[38:06] lying dead
[38:07] by all winds of Doctrine let us not be
[38:10] shaken by the discounted people that
[38:13] have left the message they have never
[38:15] left the message because they are never
[38:17] part of us all they came in with the
[38:20] intellectual fate yes
[38:22] they never had a revelation of this
[38:24] message and therefore they went out and
[38:27] then they could go to Facebook YouTube
[38:28] wherever they want and to the
[38:30] journalists and whatever whatever place
[38:32] they want to go to time and bring this
[38:35] message down this message will never
[38:37] come down amen this message comes from
[38:40] the Throne of God hallelujah yes amen
[38:44] and the prophet came from the Throne of
[38:46] God
[38:47] he brought the message from there
[38:49] because the Bible says before the
[38:51] foundation of the world
[38:53] he ordained us
[38:56] where we come from where we're going to
[39:01] God is not an extremist
[39:03] God has laid down these laws
[39:06] God has laid down his rules
[39:08] he's not an extremist
[39:11] God laid his rules done for his people
[39:15] not for the whole world
[39:18] for his people
[39:20] and these people will obey the rules of
[39:24] God amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[39:27] yes
[39:29] we go to our next
[39:32] line of thought
[39:37] s have I done
[39:40] and when I saw among the spoils The
[39:43] goodly Babylon garments and the 200
[39:46] seconds of silver and The Witch of gold
[39:49] a 50 second wait then I coveted them and
[39:54] took them and behold they are hidden in
[39:57] the Earth in the midst of my tent and
[40:01] the silver under it
[40:03] so Joshua sent messages and ran into the
[40:06] tent and behold
[40:08] and behold it was hidden in the in his
[40:11] tent the silver under it and they took
[40:13] them out of the midst of the tent and
[40:16] brought them unto Joshua and all of the
[40:20] children of Israel laid them laid them
[40:22] out before the Lord and Joshua and all
[40:26] Israel within took Aiken and Zera and
[40:32] the Surah and the garments and the wedge
[40:34] and the gold his sons and his daughters
[40:37] and his oxen and his acid and his sheep
[40:41] and he's still and that said they had
[40:44] brought them and unto the valley of Echo
[40:47] and Joshua said why Hester traveled us
[40:51] the Lord shall trouble thee this day and
[40:55] all Israel stored him stoned him with
[40:58] him with the stones and built them with
[41:01] fire and after they had stoned them with
[41:05] stones they raised up over him again
[41:08] great heap of stone unto the this day
[41:11] and the Lord and the Lord turned from
[41:14] the fierceness of his anger wherefore
[41:17] the name
[41:18] the name of the place was called the
[41:21] valley of Echo and this day
[41:24] it is
[41:26] yes
[41:28] there is
[41:30] a remembrance
[41:33] there is a remembrance of this
[41:35] it is not there it is there
[41:38] and it could be identified
[41:40] so the Bible is not a myth
[41:42] the Bible is not some solitary
[41:45] the Bible has some great stories
[41:48] it has love stories you've got War
[41:51] Stories
[41:52] he's got hate stories he's got
[41:54] everything in it
[41:56] so if you want to read a book you read
[41:58] the Bible
[41:59] and who was the extremists in this
[42:02] we finish with Moses we finish with Noah
[42:07] now we come to Joshua
[42:09] a man of God
[42:11] prophet of God a leader of God who led
[42:15] the people into a promised land was he
[42:17] an extremist
[42:20] he killed him one man did the sin but
[42:23] the whole family had to die
[42:25] so be careful
[42:28] you see this is where we stand
[42:31] we have a great God
[42:33] and a god with instruction this morning
[42:35] and they can and his family had to be
[42:39] kissed wiped out
[42:41] and that was the instruction of God
[42:44] now
[42:53] you've gone through the motion we've
[42:55] gone through all these things that we
[42:57] see now and placing God and their
[42:59] prophets we place God in the prophets in
[43:03] the two sides to see
[43:04] whose instruction and who wants to be
[43:07] blamed nobody is to blame because God's
[43:09] instruction
[43:14] William Branham
[43:17] did not speak his own words
[43:20] he did not preach his own words he
[43:23] preached the gospel the only
[43:28] he only said what the Bible said and no
[43:31] other point and never pointed anybody to
[43:35] himself
[43:37] he was always pointing people to Jesus
[43:39] Christ
[43:40] at no time
[43:42] he ever said
[43:44] somebody
[43:45] to come to his church
[43:48] he always pointed them to Christ
[43:51] he always said to him stay with your
[43:53] bastard
[43:54] he always say them stay with the church
[43:58] but they had to come a time when he had
[44:01] to say come out of here my people
[44:03] do not be partakers of a plague because
[44:06] there was a plague today
[44:08] now we find
[44:11] brother Brandon would preach
[44:14] you say he was a chauvinist
[44:19] he never hated woman
[44:22] all he did was preach
[44:24] the gospel
[44:28] if you want to look
[44:32] with God
[44:34] said
[44:35] about the trousers
[44:41] that's exactly what he preached it's
[44:42] Abomination unto the Lord thy God for a
[44:45] woman to put on the garments of a man
[44:50] so we can find that in general
[44:52] Deuteronomy 22 5.
[44:57] let's go there for the sake of
[45:07] we get to the other part just now
[45:20] it says the woman shall not
[45:22] wait that would pertain it unto a man
[45:25] neither seven men put on the garments
[45:28] put on the woman's
[45:30] put on woman's gun for all that do our
[45:33] Abomination unto thy Lord thy God
[45:39] have a scripture
[45:41] and that's what he preached
[45:44] so he didn't he existed
[45:46] he all corrected them and told them to
[45:48] do the exact thing
[45:51] and you see today what has happened you
[45:53] know the man that actually put the woman
[45:55] into her pants
[45:56] when he was dying he regretted it
[45:59] he wrote a letter that he regretted it I
[46:02] can't get his name now but he said he
[46:04] regretted the day he put the woman on
[46:06] the pants
[46:07] so he knew in his country that he knew
[46:13] now the woman said no you know what we
[46:15] go there we are so stuck up we can't use
[46:18] our makeups we can't use our things we
[46:21] can't use our pens we can't use our uh
[46:24] uh uh
[46:25] our jewelry
[46:29] and you find it they become so difficult
[46:34] and if you see our sisters they glows
[46:40] just natural
[46:42] I've seen in the news somebody someone
[46:46] of the celebrities
[46:48] said she's not using makeup anymore she
[46:50] want to go natural
[46:52] and then she also realized
[46:55] that makeup makes you look different
[46:58] from what you meant to me
[47:02] let's go to Genesis 35.
[47:08] you just bring this backwards this
[47:10] morning
[47:12] can I go another 20 minutes
[47:22] Genesis 35
[47:26] and Christ go after battle dwell there
[47:30] and make thee and alter unto God
[47:35] that appeared unto thee went down fled
[47:39] from the face
[47:41] from the face of Israel
[47:43] then Jacob
[47:45] said
[47:46] his household and all that were with him
[47:50] put away the strange gods
[47:55] strange gods
[47:57] now you see
[47:58] the problem was not assurance
[48:01] all he was doing is to preach this
[48:03] gospel
[48:05] by going among you and be clean and
[48:09] change your garments and let us
[48:13] rise and go up to battle and I will make
[48:17] thee an altar unto God who answered and
[48:20] said in the day of my distress and was
[48:22] with me in all the way which I went
[48:26] and they gave unto Jacob all the strange
[48:29] Gods which were in their hands and all
[48:33] their earrings which were in their years
[48:36] and Jacob hid them under the oak tree
[48:39] under the oak which was inshakable
[48:43] greatest mistake he made you put it
[48:45] under the tree he should have bend them
[48:47] all
[48:48] you see
[48:50] so you see that is what it is
[48:53] they are strange gods and we put them in
[48:56] the Years people put them in the ears
[48:57] put them in the hands put them around
[48:59] the neck
[49:03] and you say
[49:05] that uh a woman
[49:08] is equal to a man
[49:10] no it can never be that was never the
[49:13] ordinances of God
[49:15] the ordinance of God always
[49:17] you should be under the subjection of
[49:19] your husband
[49:20] you should be under the subjects in the
[49:22] rulership of your of your husband never
[49:25] over that and now now here they say that
[49:28] brother Brendan was a chefiness because
[49:29] he preached this
[49:32] let's go
[49:34] and see
[49:37] let's go to Genesis 3 16.
[49:40] that's where the curse was
[49:43] [Music]
[49:46] and Grace came in John 3 16.
[49:49] Genesis 3 16 took the test John 3 16
[49:52] gave you the grace and the blessing
[49:55] hallelujah amen praise
[50:11] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[50:14] multiply
[50:16] thy sorrow
[50:17] and thy conception in total thou shall
[50:20] bring forth children
[50:22] and the desire shall be to the husband
[50:25] and he shall rule over shall rule over
[50:28] thee
[50:30] because you have to be under the
[50:31] subjection
[50:33] and that is why we got such a chaos this
[50:35] morning
[50:36] because people the the the the sisters
[50:40] want to be above the man they want to
[50:42] take cruel
[50:44] you know sometimes you might say that I
[50:46] am not I don't use the pants
[50:49] says about death
[50:51] he says if you rule over your husband
[50:53] you're already using the pants
[50:56] so always remember if you if you if you
[50:59] if you always nothing your husband and
[51:01] and trying to to get him get him under
[51:04] your control then you got the pants on
[51:06] you can learn to have a nice long dress
[51:08] doesn't make any difference
[51:12] no
[51:13] we find that
[51:15] God is always people
[51:17] so man is always misinterpreting the
[51:21] word of God and therefore we can find
[51:23] ourselves in this situation
[51:26] oh my God
[51:33] you see we find today the present day
[51:36] the present-day evangelists
[51:39] and the Great Men of the so-called Great
[51:42] Men of God
[51:43] today I've misled the sisters
[51:46] and two will invoke them away from the
[51:48] gospel of God
[51:52] we find
[51:53] the day
[51:55] and put it
[51:56] the woman on the pedestal
[52:01] we find
[52:03] The Woman become
[52:06] preachers
[52:07] women become
[52:10] convenience
[52:14] and we've seen this
[52:16] on a regular basis
[52:19] and imagine a convenience coming in the
[52:21] front
[52:22] with a mini skirt
[52:24] to convene
[52:28] I suppose that must be a Christian
[52:29] minister
[52:33] because the only Christian church so God
[52:38] and then you decide find a convener
[52:40] coming up with the jeans
[52:44] and the the talks are gone low
[52:48] preachers say nothing about it
[52:52] that must be a Christian jeans for the
[52:56] woman
[52:59] and then you find them fully painted
[53:03] probably get the Christian lipsticks
[53:07] from somewhere
[53:11] I believe this recently TD Jakes
[53:15] T.D Jakes I want to tell you this
[53:17] morning
[53:18] you're not a minister of the Gospel of
[53:20] Jesus Christ
[53:22] you are just a motivational speaker
[53:26] that is all you are
[53:29] what you said came from the pit of Hell
[53:34] what you just said came from the pit of
[53:37] Hell
[53:39] you cannot release the woman
[53:44] they are under the subject of their
[53:47] husbands
[53:51] anything that is against the word of God
[53:55] and contrary to the word of God comes
[53:58] directly from the pit of Hell yes
[54:02] so therefore sisters
[54:05] don't go into the YouTube and watch
[54:07] these people preaching
[54:08] you have 1200 messages they will destroy
[54:13] your home
[54:16] they say there is no Protestant anymore
[54:21] what did the Protestants die for
[54:25] 68 million Christians died
[54:29] mothers
[54:31] stomachs were opened the babies were
[54:34] taken out
[54:35] they were fed to the Lions
[54:38] they were fed to the drugs
[54:40] ever put out a street balls lighting
[54:44] would turn on the head
[54:46] that died horrible death because they
[54:49] were Protestant protesting against what
[54:52] against the Catholic Church
[54:54] today you Protestant Joel Austin TD Jake
[54:58] whoever you are you are going there and
[55:00] calling him your father
[55:02] [Music]
[55:04] you have denied this faith
[55:06] and you call Brother Branham a false
[55:09] prophet
[55:10] you must get your head turned around
[55:14] God is not a joke
[55:18] if you're in a motivation amen
[55:20] Protestant we are still Protestants
[55:25] we will never join the Catholic Church
[55:28] amen and one is because of the doctrine
[55:32] it's a doctrine of the devils
[55:35] therefore this morning
[55:37] we should know where we're going we
[55:39] should know how we stand this gospel
[55:42] 68 million of them died because of us
[55:46] so we can stand today
[55:50] we find this morning that is why
[55:53] people are saying this morning the world
[55:55] is going into a chaotic mood
[55:59] you know
[56:00] they're saying celebrities
[56:04] saying they have stunned the crowd
[56:07] because they came out unto the podium
[56:10] with a see-through garment
[56:13] where did you see a see-through marriage
[56:16] gown
[56:19] what happened to the men
[56:22] they became so sissified
[56:25] with a see-through wedding gown
[56:29] if you want to see where where this all
[56:32] comes from
[56:34] so those are the demons that sitting on
[56:36] your head
[56:38] so you need to get played up
[56:40] and start covering your body
[56:42] you're talking about cutting your hair
[56:44] you can find it in the book of I'm
[56:46] cutting yeah you can find it in the book
[56:49] of First Corinthians chapter 11.
[56:53] which says the woman shall not cut ahead
[56:57] it's not better the blood who said a
[56:58] woman should not cut it
[57:00] it's the Bible
[57:02] and you know when this happened this
[57:04] happened after 1981.
[57:08] it got worse after 1981. why
[57:12] Princess Diana
[57:15] every pastor's wife cut the hair
[57:17] according to Princess Diana's Style
[57:22] yes
[57:23] the Diana Spirit went through the world
[57:29] president was gone off the scene
[57:32] but he foresaw this
[57:35] I questioned my pastor he said me no how
[57:39] long is long and how short is shot
[57:46] so you got to think about that
[57:50] you go and think about it
[57:52] I see
[57:56] if this was a length
[57:59] if you took out one centimeter it's shot
[58:02] already
[58:04] so don't try your uh your intellectual
[58:08] uh
[58:11] your intellectual feed in this matter
[58:14] and in 1981 that's what happened
[58:18] the whole world went into a frenzy
[58:21] because Princess Diana had a a real good
[58:24] Style
[58:26] and I come to church and and I was in
[58:28] the denomination at that time gone to a
[58:30] church and see my pastor's wife had long
[58:33] hair and the next moment that his style
[58:35] was up
[58:38] but all in my heart I wasn't in the
[58:40] message at the time
[58:41] but I just believed
[58:43] it was wrong
[58:45] I believed it was wrong
[58:48] is it because you're the seed of God
[58:50] you can believe it is wrong
[58:53] and when you believe in something in
[58:55] your heart tells you this is wrong do
[58:57] not do not deny it
[58:59] do not push it aside
[59:01] yes it is wrong accept it and go and
[59:04] search it
[59:07] we find this morning
[59:09] [Music]
[59:10] we find this warning we are in a certain
[59:13] condition
[59:15] serious
[59:18] they have now
[59:19] they have now
[59:21] uh legalize prostitution
[59:26] they have legalized gay managers
[59:31] they have legalized
[59:35] unisex toilets
[59:40] she says you're going to be careful
[59:44] now if I think I'm a lady
[59:47] I can just go into a ladies toilet
[59:51] if the sister thinks she's a below
[59:54] we find it strange
[59:56] that man can accept this
[59:59] find it very very strange
[1:00:03] let us go to the Bible
[1:00:06] let us go to 19194.
[1:00:11] you sit outside
[1:00:14] the Angels decided to sit outside
[1:00:18] but not being a man
[1:00:20] that saw how is is a his uncle uh uh
[1:00:26] conducted himself as a Christian
[1:00:29] he said the Angels no you can't stay
[1:00:31] outside here come we have to go into our
[1:00:34] house
[1:00:36] and he took them into his house
[1:00:39] and then
[1:00:41] he made them rest
[1:00:43] and you see what happened
[1:00:51] but before they lay down
[1:00:53] the men of the city
[1:00:55] even the men of Sodom
[1:00:58] come past the house with me the
[1:01:00] surrounding the house around
[1:01:02] but all men and young men
[1:01:08] both old and young
[1:01:16] and all the people from every quarters
[1:01:19] and they called unto lot and said unto
[1:01:22] him where are the men which came in
[1:01:26] through this through this night
[1:01:29] bring them out
[1:01:31] unto us that we may know them
[1:01:34] and lot went out the door
[1:01:39] and with us a lot went out the door unto
[1:01:44] them and shut out the door after him and
[1:01:48] said I prayed thee brethren do not show
[1:01:51] Wicked behold now I have two daughters
[1:01:56] which have not known
[1:01:58] man let
[1:02:00] not known man
[1:02:02] let me I pray you
[1:02:05] bring them unto you and you do what you
[1:02:08] want to them
[1:02:11] you see this
[1:02:14] it's not putting the brand into it
[1:02:17] he's not his word
[1:02:19] it's God's word
[1:02:22] and yeah
[1:02:25] God destroyed Solomon
[1:02:28] by fire
[1:02:31] and we are in the same condition today
[1:02:34] nothing has changed it's even worse than
[1:02:36] I think that time
[1:02:41] let's go to Romans 24. I mean
[1:02:45] Romans 1
[1:03:02] .
[1:03:26] 24
[1:03:36] recording
[1:03:37] wherefore God also gave them up to
[1:03:41] unclean uncleanliness
[1:03:43] through the lust of their own hearts
[1:03:47] to dishonor their own bodies
[1:03:50] between themselves
[1:03:52] who changed the truth of God into a life
[1:03:56] and worshiped and serve the creature
[1:03:59] more than the Creator
[1:04:01] who is blessed forever amen for this
[1:04:05] cause God gave them up unto via
[1:04:09] depiction
[1:04:10] for even their women did change the
[1:04:13] natural use
[1:04:14] into what into that which is against
[1:04:16] nature
[1:04:18] and likewise also men living the natural
[1:04:22] use
[1:04:23] of the woman
[1:04:25] burned in their eyes
[1:04:27] in their lust one towards another man
[1:04:31] men could men working that in their
[1:04:34] knowledge God gave them up over to
[1:04:37] reprobate mind to do those things which
[1:04:41] are not convenient being filled with
[1:04:43] their unrighteousness
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:47] that's your ceramic conditions today
[1:04:50] it's right here
[1:04:53] and this is not brother branham's word
[1:04:55] he was not a chauvinist
[1:04:57] he was not an extremist he preached the
[1:05:00] gospel as it is bare-handed
[1:05:04] and that is why today we can say truly
[1:05:08] this is the truth
[1:05:11] this is God's word for the day amen this
[1:05:15] is God
[1:05:16] this is God in action once more
[1:05:19] and I want to remind you my brother my
[1:05:21] sister
[1:05:22] I've really took some time to preach
[1:05:23] this gospel to to search this thing
[1:05:26] because you know I I
[1:05:28] I always thought
[1:05:30] that we need to clarify this
[1:05:33] because the people out there don't know
[1:05:35] what the preachers are doing
[1:05:37] they are misleading the people
[1:05:40] and listening the people to believe that
[1:05:42] they can do what they feel like doing
[1:05:44] we're going to close this one
[1:05:47] let us go to truth Timothy
[1:05:51] 2 16.
[1:05:54] closing
[1:05:57] you know when people say they're closing
[1:06:01] we just say the closing
[1:06:48] 2 Timothy two sorry
[1:07:04] it says but San profane and vain
[1:07:06] babbling
[1:07:08] for they will increase
[1:07:10] unto more ungodliness
[1:07:13] you see sometimes
[1:07:15] we get involved
[1:07:18] and we get involved in a debate
[1:07:20] we get involved because you cannot
[1:07:22] change these people
[1:07:24] you cannot change them
[1:07:26] but we get involved in serious debates
[1:07:28] he says forget that for now
[1:07:31] because we are living right at the brink
[1:07:33] of his coming
[1:07:34] let us prepare ourselves
[1:07:36] for our journey
[1:07:38] let us unpack
[1:07:40] all the things that we shouldn't have
[1:07:42] you see
[1:07:44] it says
[1:07:51] they will increase unto more angularly
[1:07:54] and their world will eat
[1:07:57] and don't eat canker of whom
[1:08:01] is
[1:08:02] infinitas
[1:08:05] who concerning the truth third
[1:08:08] saying that the resurrection is passed
[1:08:10] already
[1:08:11] and overthrow the faith summer
[1:08:14] we have the same thing today
[1:08:16] people say the Rapture took place in
[1:08:18] 1963.
[1:08:20] 3 yes and let us stand up for this
[1:08:23] gospel
[1:08:28] that was another one
[1:08:30] which is supposed to have gone first yes
[1:08:32] but LeBron believed the Trinity but not
[1:08:35] the way the Catholic Church believed it
[1:08:40] you see
[1:08:41] and I'm sorry for you that are in the
[1:08:43] denomination
[1:08:45] because you've lost out
[1:08:47] and you've lost her desperately you know
[1:08:50] because
[1:08:52] the Bible says
[1:08:55] I think in James 2 19.
[1:09:02] so he is happy
[1:09:03] because there are people that are
[1:09:05] believing three gods and he believes one
[1:09:07] God
[1:09:09] you see
[1:09:11] let us therefore this morning
[1:09:14] look unto Jesus amen the author the
[1:09:17] finisher of our faith
[1:09:18] he is so good to us
[1:09:20] he's never left us he's never forsaked
[1:09:23] us this message is from the Throne of
[1:09:26] God
[1:09:27] this message is real
[1:09:30] this message is true amen this message
[1:09:34] cannot be
[1:09:36] cannot be exchanged
[1:09:38] for anything in the world
[1:09:40] whether you call it an extremist
[1:09:43] whether you can call it a chauvinist
[1:09:46] whether you can call it whatever you
[1:09:47] want
[1:09:48] this is a Gospel of Jesus Christ amen
[1:09:52] and the prophet just preached that
[1:09:55] he shared that with us
[1:09:57] and that is why today
[1:09:59] we are ready
[1:10:00] to go home
[1:10:02] we are ready to go Within and meeting
[1:10:06] I never come here to defend brother
[1:10:07] Brandon neither defend the gospel never
[1:10:10] did the Bible the Bible is true
[1:10:13] and for you journalists
[1:10:17] and it is
[1:10:19] atheists
[1:10:21] atheists
[1:10:22] have nothing to stand on
[1:10:28] but you generous that are Christian

[1:15:40] Jesus whatever their needs may be this
[1:15:42] morning may you meet each one at a point
[1:15:45] of need father need to believe I don't
[1:15:48] believe that anyone came here in vain
[1:15:50] father they came here seeking your face
[1:15:53] this morning they come here because
[1:15:55] Allah they'll be living in Father we
[1:15:57] need more of you in our life amen and
[1:16:00] amen amen
[1:16:03] Emmanuel blessed this morning amen
[1:16:06] amen the Bible said that Scofield will
[1:16:08] rise up in the last days saying where is
[1:16:11] the promise of his coming
[1:16:12] amen and that's what we had in this end
[1:16:16] time amen we had people getting was
[1:16:19] getting wondering where where is the
[1:16:21] promise William Brandon spoke about the
[1:16:23] coming of the Lord Ray is the promise
[1:16:24] then he started to reason with the word
[1:16:27] you see when you start to use reasoning
[1:16:30] and not Faith you start to bring doubt
[1:16:32] amen right so it's wisdom versus faith
[1:16:35] and that's what we had and therefore we
[1:16:37] had a falling away because we're living
[1:16:40] in a time where by the food they shall
[1:16:42] know them you can hide seed bunch of
[1:16:44] clonides fruits
[1:16:46] and you'll see in the in this hour now
[1:16:48] all the fruits are manifesting amen
[1:16:51] whatever fruit was sold in the ground is
[1:16:53] showing in the sour that's that is why
[1:16:56] in this hour You Can't Hide what you are
[1:16:58] the Bible said he that is Holy will be
[1:17:00] holy still these are he that is filthy
[1:17:02] will be filthy still but the Bible said
[1:17:04] we must contend for the faith amen amen
[1:17:07] but as times where you also can't cast
[1:17:10] your pearls amongst the swine yeah so
[1:17:13] you've got to use wisdom and you've got
[1:17:15] to follow the leadership of the holy
[1:17:18] spirit in all things amen and we thank
[1:17:20] God that we live in our but this is our
[1:17:23] with the holy spirit that is leading the
[1:17:26] church and that is why we're Desiring
[1:17:29] always to be led by the holy spirit
[1:17:31] because the Holy Spirit can discern the
[1:17:33] hearts and intents of the heart and he
[1:17:36] knows exactly what we need to be
[1:17:38] sustained in this hour amen is the holy
[1:17:41] spirit that is going to see us through
[1:17:42] and he's looking through the fivefold
[1:17:44] ministry amen we've got to recognize
[1:17:47] that people come and cast doubt and
[1:17:48] trying to find faults in the prophet's
[1:17:51] Ministry but everything that a prophet
[1:17:53] spoke about and he kept speaking about a
[1:17:54] bride tell him it's too late there's
[1:17:57] already a bride manifested upon the
[1:17:59] Earth and tell him it's too late because
[1:18:01] I am the manifested word in this hour
[1:18:04] yes if you want to say that William
[1:18:06] Branham is false whatever he spoke about
[1:18:08] I manifest the word is manifested
[1:18:11] through me in this hour amen you tell
[1:18:13] him he's far too late now we can see the
[1:18:15] scriptures being manifested from Genesis
[1:18:17] to Revelation because why if you were to
[1:18:20] message by intellect you will fall yeah
[1:18:22] but if you had it that's why Jesus said
[1:18:26] unto you unless you are born again you
[1:18:30] cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven that is
