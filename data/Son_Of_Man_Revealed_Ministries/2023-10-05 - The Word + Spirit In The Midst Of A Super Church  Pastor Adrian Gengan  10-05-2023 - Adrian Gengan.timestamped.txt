[0:00] fight with some little temporal blessing
[0:02] that's falling for the bride
[0:04] amen
[0:07] the letter rain is falling for the bride
[0:09] amen but they are feeding of it amen
[0:13] because the wheat and the tears were
[0:14] sewn together right amen so we shouldn't
[0:17] be impressed
[0:19] let them carry on we have a much greater
[0:22] work Hallelujah you know I was thinking
[0:25] about the scripture Revelation 10 and
[0:27] what you try and do is you prophesy
[0:29] again to people and what you're really
[0:32] showing them is an open book yes and you
[0:35] tell them look here look here what are
[0:36] you showing them look for your name in
[0:39] the family album amen and then they look
[0:41] and they say no I can't see it
[0:43] they can't find the name in the family
[0:45] album
[0:47] amen but it's only the predestinator
[0:49] that will see the name in the family
[0:50] album amen so then you don't waste much
[0:53] time with them you go on to the next
[0:54] person can you see your name in the
[0:55] family album some say no I see I'm a
[0:58] chicken yeah
[1:00] but I was reading and they say yes I'm
[1:02] an eagle amen but we got to keep
[1:04] searching amen hallelujah amen Let's uh
[1:07] turn to Revelation chapter 10.
[1:10] amen
[1:14] who speak a little thought on the word
[1:17] plus spirit in the midst of his super
[1:20] Church
[1:21] amen amen we must have both the word
[1:25] plus spirit
[1:27] in the midst of a super church amen
[1:32] so Revelation chapter 10 verse 8
[1:34] familiar portion of scripture we're
[1:36] going to read it again
[1:38] amen
[1:39] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:41] spoke unto me again and said go and take
[1:44] the little book which is open in the end
[1:46] of the angel with standard upon the sea
[1:48] and upon the Earth
[1:50] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:53] him give me the little book
[1:56] amen and he said unto me take it and eat
[1:58] it up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[2:01] and it shall be in the amount sweet as
[2:03] honey
[2:04] now this is really a revelation we've
[2:06] got to get
[2:07] if we don't get this revelation we are
[2:09] going to be like the scribes and the
[2:11] Pharisees who when the manifested word
[2:14] was in their midst Jesus Christ they
[2:16] kept saying we have Moses and the law
[2:19] we have the written word
[2:22] so this is now a new change in
[2:25] Revelation 10 it's moved from a one-man
[2:28] scripture of the Prophet he's off the
[2:30] scene and the word that he spoke is now
[2:34] ought to be manifested in a people
[2:37] and if we are not looking for the
[2:38] Fulfillment of everything brother
[2:40] Branham said in our lives
[2:42] then we are looking like the prophet
[2:45] says in a review mirror in a day gone by
[2:47] amen so this is a changing dispensation
[2:50] we are in the midst of it 10 10 says I
[2:53] took the little book out of the Angel's
[2:56] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[2:58] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[3:01] had eaten it up my belly was bitter and
[3:04] he said unto me thou must prophesy again
[3:06] before many peoples and Nations and
[3:09] tongues and Kings amen
[3:11] now if you go to Revelation 13 you'll
[3:15] know that he is oppressing people's
[3:18] Nations tongues and kings
[3:20] that's why your prophecy is to those
[3:22] Nations amen tongues and Kings amen
[3:24] let's bow for prayer Lord we come before
[3:27] you now and we thank you Lord for the
[3:28] reading of your word and Lord we bless

[3:33] and an honor father it is to come into

[3:36] gathered together with Believers of Life
[3:38] precious Faith oh God lord we rub
[3:41] shoulders of the world and worldly
[3:42] people during the course of the day
[3:43] because of our jobs and circumstances
[3:46] Lord but father Lord if we count as a
[3:48] privileged Lord to be gathered with
[3:50] people who believe the same word the
[3:52] same Revelation law and father whose
[3:54] names are in the family album Lord Jesus
[3:56] father God and Lord we come now Lord you

[4:18] all foundations will shake father the
[4:20] Lord on Christ the solid rock we stand

[4:25] Lord Jesus we thank you Lord that you
[4:27] have called us opened up our eyes of our
[4:29] understanding Lord Jesus father even as
[4:31] we sit around your word now father Lord
[4:33] I pray Lord that we bind and we come
[4:36] against every Spirit that's not of you
[4:37] Lord Jesus every tiredness every Spirit
[4:40] Lord of sleepiness and father we come
[4:42] now Lord sit around your word and may
[4:44] you open up your word to us we ask it in
[4:46] Jesus name amen
[4:48] amen you may be seated
[4:53] amen
[4:56] Hallelujah
[5:00] amen how many of you were blessed on
[5:02] Sunday with the service yeah amen so we
[5:06] were just wondering on this you know the
[5:08] angel of the Lord came to the prophet on
[5:10] 7th of May
[5:13] you know that 1946 right and Israel
[5:16] apparently celebrating the 17th seventh
[5:18] year anniversary because they became a
[5:21] nation
[5:23] right
[5:24] and uh I didn't actually forgot it was
[5:27] the 7th of May on Sunday it was only on
[5:31] Monday that I realized that that was the
[5:33] day that the angel of the Lord came
[5:35] into the cave and met the prophet
[5:39] but you know God knows how to fix things
[5:40] sometimes amen because Sunday we were
[5:44] speaking about the eleventh hour Gentile
[5:46] workers in partnership with the angel of
[5:48] the Lord amen and think of it the same
[5:51] day seventh may he came to the prophet
[5:54] and he formed a partnership with the
[5:56] prophet
[5:57] and look at how God tied it up on the
[5:59] 7th of May I've completely forgotten and
[6:02] the title is
[6:03] amen what was our title the eleventh
[6:05] hour Gentile workers in partnership with
[6:08] the angel of the Lord
[6:10] so you can see even he fixes things amen
[6:12] I was talking to a few people and
[6:14] they're saying wow they were astounded
[6:15] and even my wife might mention do you
[6:17] think that was like a sign
[6:18] you know because that's how God fixes
[6:20] things amen amen the same way now you
[6:23] walk through the prophet like we read
[6:25] Revelation 10 sequence he's now coming
[6:27] to partner with the bride that's what
[6:30] that 11 23 was all about amen you can
[6:32] see that the 11 is the 11th Hour Gentile
[6:35] workers and we're in partnership with
[6:37] the angel of the Lord amen amen and
[6:39] that's going to give you the ability to
[6:41] speak amen yes amen
[6:44] he never the prophet in his ministry was
[6:48] to get the rainbow trout the only thing
[6:50] that could produce and make him catch
[6:52] the rainbow trout
[6:53] was the third pool
[6:55] first to pull he couldn't produce that
[6:58] yes but he said at the third pool
[7:01] amen and what was the third pool you
[7:04] know you went to Sabino Canyon amen
[7:06] we'll make touch on a few things there
[7:08] amen but let's go to one of the first
[7:10] things brother Branham tells us now he
[7:12] says in the last stage are we living in
[7:14] the last age amen no more ages after us
[7:17] yes amen what a glorious time to be
[7:20] living in amen amen there will be a
[7:23] group rise up
[7:25] can we make a present tense is a group
[7:27] risen up the true Bride of the last day
[7:30] and she will listen to the holy spirit
[7:34] amen now there's many voices in the
[7:36] world right now
[7:39] like there were voices in Eden the voice
[7:41] of the serpent
[7:43] amen there was the voice of Adam there
[7:45] was the voice of Eve amen
[7:48] even now there's the voice of the Beast
[7:51] to Beast
[7:53] there's the voice of the church world
[7:55] there's a voice of Amen a politician
[7:58] politics demon powers so many voices but
[8:01] whose voice is the one who is rising up
[8:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ she will
[8:06] listen to the holy spirit amen amen and
[8:10] how is the holy spirit speaking
[8:13] he is pouring himself out through the
[8:15] faithful Ministry
[8:17] now you may get upset with that you may
[8:19] be uneasy with that you may not want to
[8:21] accept it but that is God's plan yes
[8:24] amen he said through the fight for
[8:26] Ministry if you read Ephesians 4 you'll
[8:28] see that God is working through the
[8:30] faithful Ministry amen you know there's
[8:32] a quote the way the prophet says that's
[8:35] God's dress with yes amen
[8:39] Hallelujah
[8:41] I don't hear everybody saying amen
[8:44] amen hallelujah just check if your
[8:46] neighbor is okay
[8:48] check if there's a pulse amen and
[8:51] Hallelujah amen now here's the first
[8:54] commandment
[8:55] I mean if you know what the first
[8:56] commandment is
[8:59] if you write the scripture down amen
[9:01] this is the first commandment
[9:04] Mark 12 29-30 Jesus is telling us what
[9:07] the first commandment is and Jesus
[9:09] answered him and said the first of all
[9:12] the Commandments is Yo Israel the Lord
[9:15] our God is one Lord amen
[9:18] right and then Jesus further goes on to
[9:20] say and thou shall love the Lord thy God
[9:23] with all thy heart
[9:26] and with all thy soul
[9:28] and with all thy mind amen amen and with
[9:31] all thy strength amen and in reaffirms
[9:35] this is the first commandment
[9:39] amen so you have to love the Lord your
[9:42] God with all thy heart all thy soul with
[9:45] all thy mind and with all thy strength
[9:48] amen now if you love the Lord that way
[9:51] amen if not then that's what we should
[9:54] desire Lord help me to Love You This Way
[9:56] amen amen
[9:58] that's your entire being now
[10:01] now the prophet of God tells us that
[10:04] love and faith has to go together
[10:07] right we just showed you there that you
[10:09] have to love the Lord your God and when
[10:12] you love the Lord your God he says love
[10:14] produces faith
[10:16] amen so the first and foremost thing
[10:18] before you can have faith you've got to
[10:20] have love for God Amen you've got to
[10:23] have love for his word then it won't be
[10:25] Grievous to you to spend time with him
[10:27] because you love him your love his
[10:29] presence your love is word amen amen and
[10:33] that love starts to produce a fruit in
[10:35] you because you know that God is his
[10:37] word
[10:38] in the beginning was the word the word
[10:40] was with God the Word was God and then
[10:42] the word became flesh yes yes so God is
[10:45] no different from his word amen amen God
[10:48] is his word so the love for God's word
[10:52] produces faith
[10:55] amen the love for God's word is
[10:58] producing faith in you and me amen Faith
[11:01] cometh by the sharing of the word
[11:03] hearing the word of God Amen so perfect
[11:05] Faith you can see is coming when you see
[11:08] yourself in the word yes
[11:10] yes perfect Faith doesn't come when you
[11:13] see John's Ministry
[11:15] perfect free doesn't come when you see
[11:16] the disciples Ministry
[11:18] perfect faith comes when you see
[11:20] yourself in the word and you recognize
[11:22] your part of the word amen amen amen
[11:25] right now I am manifesting scripture
[11:28] amen I am fulfilling scripture you are
[11:30] fulfilling scripture
[11:32] amen that's how Jesus was walking while
[11:35] they were reading from the Scrolls and
[11:36] the text Jesus was the manifested word
[11:39] walking in their presence
[11:41] living out the scriptures
[11:43] yes amen so when we recognize ourselves
[11:47] as being part of the word that is
[11:49] producing a perfect Faith within us amen
[11:52] amen
[11:54] Hallelujah and perfect Faith remember
[11:56] came to this boy looking at the mirror
[11:58] remember he's looking at himself in the
[12:01] mirror and Revelation struck and he said
[12:03] Mama that's me
[12:06] amen he says Mama that is me and if the
[12:10] bridegroom
[12:11] is a god of the I am
[12:14] the bride his wife who's a part of him
[12:17] he's also has a I am word
[12:20] amen hallelujah so when we look into the
[12:23] word the mirror of God's word you see
[12:25] yourself in Revelation 10 8 to 11 and
[12:27] you say I am John
[12:30] when you look at Revelation 19 amen you
[12:33] say I am the bride who has made herself
[12:35] ready you look at Malachi 4 5 and you
[12:38] say I am the you
[12:40] that Elijah is sent to
[12:42] these scriptures are written for me if
[12:45] there was no you there was no purpose to
[12:47] send Elijah
[12:49] there had to be a you
[12:51] because
[12:53] the prophecy is directed to you
[12:55] the prophecy is not directed to William
[12:57] Branham
[12:59] he doesn't say behold William Branham
[13:01] I'm going to send you to a people
[13:03] he says behold I send you
[13:05] Elijah the prophet yeah
[13:08] amen so that word is written directly to
[13:10] you so we see ourselves in the scripture
[13:13] and this is producing a perfect Faith
[13:15] within us because others read that
[13:17] scripture and it is foreign to them yes
[13:20] nobody can personalize your scriptures
[13:23] like you can amen nobody can personalize
[13:25] the scriptures like I can amen I am John
[13:30] where do you know of beside the message
[13:32] of the hour that came by the prophet
[13:34] message that the people stand up and
[13:36] recognize themselves as being John of
[13:38] Revelation 10. you show me a church
[13:42] outside of the message of the hour you
[13:45] show me a church that can say that they
[13:47] understand revelation 19.
[13:50] amen the marriage of the Lamb is come
[13:52] and his bride has made herself ready and
[13:55] to her was given amen robes amen
[13:57] garments find linen
[13:59] they don't have fine linen out there in
[14:01] the churches amen amen they are
[14:04] filthiness amen they have brought amen
[14:07] willingness into the church you're going
[14:09] to the church and it's like a disco in
[14:11] there amen amen and I saw I was telling
[14:14] amen some of the brothers here amen I
[14:17] saw that when it was there in seed form
[14:20] and another Pastor the other day I was
[14:22] shouting to him and he confirmed the
[14:24] same thing Amen in seed form and you'll
[14:27] remember this
[14:28] there was a song and you know the
[14:30] prophet always tells you the spirits
[14:32] attached to things there was a song that
[14:34] came in on the scene that changed the
[14:36] entire way that the church started to
[14:38] worship and the way they started to amen
[14:40] bring things into the church and that
[14:42] song was a song called Stomp
[14:47] because Stomp past the Christian World
[14:50] they call it cross it crossed over into
[14:52] the secular world and they started to
[14:54] play it in nightclubs
[14:56] such was the beat
[14:59] so enticing was the wrapping and the
[15:01] lyrics
[15:02] that it engross the entire world
[15:06] and the demon that was in Kirk Franklin
[15:08] is another shell out like Elvis Presley
[15:13] amen hallelujah Spirits don't die yes
[15:16] amen amen and I remember I was working
[15:18] at King's Music and these denominational
[15:20] passages used to come over there and
[15:22] tell me we don't know what we're going
[15:23] to do because we are losing our young
[15:25] people to the world they're going into
[15:27] the clubs and they're hearing the songs
[15:29] there so what we're going to do and this
[15:31] is exactly I'm quoting now they said
[15:33] we'll we'll buy some light because they
[15:34] should sell lights there they started to
[15:36] bring those lights into the church and
[15:39] they said we'll play stomp in the church
[15:41] why should our young people be dancing
[15:43] out there when they can be dancing in
[15:45] the church and that's how they brought
[15:46] the worldliness into the church
[15:49] tell me before that time you went to do
[15:51] most churches denominational churches
[15:53] and there was a reverence about them
[15:56] then there was another spirit that
[15:58] entered and it was a through a lady
[15:59] called Darlene
[16:01] prior to that there was no woman worship
[16:03] leaders
[16:04] you know it
[16:08] yeah but through satility they started
[16:10] to introduce this thing you know that
[16:12] back in the day too even though there
[16:15] were a few women preachers it wasn't in
[16:16] the mess
[16:20] hmm help us
[16:22] amen but these things started to you're
[16:25] not whole the prophet had some Choice
[16:27] words for the church back then he was
[16:29] living now oh my my my my mind Hey man
[16:34] Hallelujah
[16:36] amen
[16:38] amen here's what brother Neville says
[16:41] in this message a true sign that's
[16:43] overlooked this is not the prophet
[16:45] speaking now brother never is speaking
[16:47] and I found this there and he says
[16:49] determined to display your faith in a
[16:52] manifest fashion
[16:56] you see even back there brother Neville
[16:57] was getting it
[16:59] don't just leave it in a written form
[17:02] determined to display your faith in a
[17:04] manifest fashion faith is never work
[17:07] don't think of Faith as something
[17:08] tedious
[17:10] Faith spoken of is no good
[17:13] higher faith I have faith I have faith
[17:17] but Faith demonstrated is the order of
[17:20] the Bible amen your faith in action
[17:24] amen
[17:26] oh bless the name of Jesus and you're
[17:29] the prophet of God in the church is
[17:30] booked now he says I wonder if we are
[17:32] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[17:35] our midst
[17:40] amen are we sufficiently impressed with
[17:44] the word in our midst
[17:46] yes
[17:47] amen
[17:49] we are sufficiently impressed with the
[17:52] word
[17:54] but now catch a revelation of what I'm
[17:55] saying
[17:57] of the word in our midst
[18:03] amen are you happy with yourself is what
[18:06] I'm asking you
[18:07] if you are the manifested word right now
[18:09] are you happy with yourself
[18:13] is God happy with you
[18:16] that you are living a manifested life
[18:18] amen that every day when you get up and
[18:21] you step out of your house amen you
[18:24] become a living word that's walking
[18:26] around
[18:27] you become the hands of God you become
[18:29] the feet of God you become the the ears
[18:32] of God amen amen
[18:36] are you impressed with the word in our
[18:37] midst
[18:40] amen now I want to bring it back to the
[18:42] written word
[18:43] and I want to bring it back to the
[18:45] revealed word of the hour because that's
[18:47] what came down in Revelation 10 the
[18:49] opening of the word
[18:50] are we sufficiently impressed with the
[18:52] opening of the world
[18:54] because this word is not out there yes
[18:58] yes the word that is found in the
[19:01] message of the hour that came by the
[19:03] prophet William Branham is not out there
[19:05] it's rejected out there
[19:08] but are we sufficiently impressed with
[19:11] the word in our midst
[19:15] [Music]
[19:16] word in our midst the message of the
[19:19] hour is going to produce in you and I a
[19:21] Rapture rapturing faith
[19:24] faith for your body change yes people
[19:26] read first Thessalonians 4 and the
[19:29] expecting a body change but they do not
[19:31] understand the scripture
[19:33] amen they are never going to have a body
[19:35] change
[19:37] the body changes only for the people
[19:39] that have the Holy Ghost and how is the
[19:43] holy ghost coming
[19:45] oh if you think you can get the Holy
[19:48] Ghost and without pouring out the
[19:50] denominational world and my friend you
[19:51] are blinded right
[19:54] because the message of the hour lose the
[19:56] Holy Ghost
[19:58] amen
[19:59] amen you know they came to the prophet
[20:02] you can read it in sorry to Jesus Jesus
[20:05] was a prophet
[20:07] they came to Jesus in mark 9.
[20:10] and there were some people that were
[20:11] casting out demons
[20:16] and they wanted to know
[20:17] should we stop them and Jesus says no
[20:20] leave them alone
[20:22] because they're casting out in his name
[20:25] as long as they're using the name
[20:27] he says they are not against us you read
[20:29] mark 9.
[20:31] right
[20:32] yes and if you want to see what verse 23
[20:35] says you go mark it down and you go read
[20:37] it at home
[20:38] amen
[20:39] because Mark 9 verse 23 is a third full
[20:42] scripture
[20:44] amen hallelujah
[20:46] so he says I wonder if we are
[20:48] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[20:50] our midst
[20:53] now the reason why some of us will not
[20:56] be impressed is because that word is not
[20:59] manifesting in our lives
[21:01] not manifesting so the power of the
[21:04] message is not displayed in US
[21:08] amen what is stifling it what chokes it
[21:11] could read the soul
[21:13] cares of this life choking this is
[21:15] choking that is joking you have a
[21:17] genuine desire but this is choking and
[21:20] that's catching you up and this is
[21:21] catching you up
[21:23] before you know it the month is gone
[21:25] you did nothing
[21:27] before I know it three weeks he's gone
[21:29] four weeks is gone a month two months
[21:31] yeah
[21:33] amen and that's how he's deceiving us
[21:37] amen making us believe that those things
[21:40] are also of importance and of value
[21:43] then you know what months turn into
[21:45] years
[21:49] turn into decades
[21:52] and when you look at yourself in the
[21:54] mirror I once was young but now I'm old
[21:58] now you got a Zeal to do something for
[22:00] the Lord
[22:01] but you don't have the energy
[22:02] [Music]
[22:05] amen maybe you don't have the health the
[22:07] same way that you used to when you were
[22:09] young
[22:10] Hallelujah
[22:12] amen now you know what the prophet says
[22:14] when the word comes amen he says in that
[22:18] day of gross darkness is this the day
[22:21] the light the let come the pillow fire
[22:25] will return by what the pure word did we
[22:28] have the pure word amen amen and we will
[22:30] return to the power of Pentecost
[22:34] amen amen yes
[22:37] I don't know what some people believe
[22:39] about Pentecost
[22:41] because when brother Brahm is talking
[22:43] about Pentecost he's not talking about
[22:44] the Pentecostals that came out to Wesley
[22:49] he is talking about the true Pentecostal
[22:52] are pouring in Acts chapter 2. amen
[22:57] amen now remember in the book of Acts
[23:00] they didn't have a Bible to refer to
[23:04] they have the words of Jesus and Jesus
[23:06] told him when the Holy Ghost comes he
[23:08] will bring things to your remembrance
[23:10] the word that I have spoken
[23:13] amen so they were so dependent upon the
[23:16] holy ghost
[23:17] amen Stephen even then which is standing
[23:21] there and he's being stoned and he
[23:22] begins to speak the Holy Ghost to him
[23:24] he's speaking and why are they are
[23:26] stoning him he breaks out into a vision
[23:28] and he sees the Lord Jesus standing
[23:31] in heaven
[23:33] amen the power of Pentecost amen the
[23:37] power of the Holy Ghost brother Branham
[23:38] says he set the heart to light amen is
[23:41] your heart set a light amen amen I know
[23:44] you now and again you get a burst of
[23:46] Faith you get a burst of the Holy Ghost
[23:48] amen but amen carry 12 and remain within
[23:51] us all the time that we want to turn by
[23:54] the pure word return to the power of
[23:56] Pentecost and welcome back the Lord
[23:59] Jesus Christ amen
[24:01] amen
[24:02] when he went away
[24:04] amen he told them Terry here in the city
[24:07] of Jerusalem until you endured with
[24:09] power from on high amen and when the
[24:12] Holy Ghost came the Holy Ghost came amen
[24:14] with power and it came with fire amen
[24:17] amen amen we need some fire in our lives
[24:19] amen amen amen we need some Holy Ghost
[24:21] Fire yes Lord amen amen so with the pure
[24:26] word expect the return of the power of
[24:28] Pentecost
[24:30] the power of Pentecost made them speak
[24:32] in a language that wasn't even their own
[24:34] language yes
[24:36] yes
[24:37] the prophet says the Holy Spirit got a
[24:40] hold of them and they began to speak in
[24:42] a language that all men understood
[24:45] so what you're hearing out there is not
[24:47] the Bible language
[24:49] it's an impersonation it's another genus
[24:52] and generous
[24:55] amen
[24:56] Hallelujah the prophet says it's another
[24:59] Babylon they Babel
[25:01] amen but he says what the pure word we
[25:03] want to turn to the power of Pentecost
[25:05] amen amen are you the living epistle can
[25:09] you see the power of Pentecost can you
[25:11] see the light over the prophet's head on
[25:13] his shoulder
[25:14] amen the supernatural life for the first
[25:17] time
[25:19] amen you don't find this over Billy
[25:21] Graham you don't find us over Oral
[25:23] Roberts you don't find us over a Allen
[25:25] we don't find us over here House born
[25:27] but one man amen amen hallelujah amen
[25:32] amen yes Lord thus shall it be in the
[25:34] day of the son of man amen amen so shall
[25:38] it be when the son of man is being
[25:40] revealed
[25:41] hallelujah amen amen Dynamic power
[25:45] Pentecost hallelujah thank you amen God
[25:48] identifying himself with his Prophet yes
[25:50] and right now I'm telling you once you
[25:52] identify himself with you amen amen
[25:55] yes Lord help us but the difference is
[25:58] we are not as committed as a prophet
[26:01] we are not a sold out as a prophet
[26:05] amen we are not willing to leave our
[26:08] families with that 23 dollars and say
[26:10] I'm going to the cave
[26:13] and I may not come back until I hear
[26:15] from God
[26:17] yes amen I'm asking you in the 23rd year
[26:21] of this millennium
[26:24] will you connect with the angel of God
[26:26] will you partner with the angel of God I
[26:29] don't know how many more sermons he must
[26:30] ask you to partner with him well how
[26:32] much more he must reveal himself to you
[26:34] amen but what is he telling you here if
[26:37] you partner with a pure world you shall
[26:39] see a return of the power of Pentecost
[26:41] amen
[26:44] um
[26:45] amen yes amen you're in another message
[26:47] he says now in this age that we're now
[26:50] living this age it's beyond Pentecost
[26:53] but the church has moved on it's gone
[26:55] into greater more powerful why
[26:59] Amen in Pentecost they didn't have the
[27:01] opening of the word
[27:03] in Pentecost John even wasn't taken up
[27:06] and seen the heavens he wasn't asked to
[27:09] come up higher amen John was one of the
[27:11] Apostles
[27:12] or somebody walk with the prophet chair
[27:14] now and when he is telling you he says
[27:16] the church has moved on Amen High

[27:24] Plan of Redemption revealed to you and I

[27:35] walking in the revelation of the son of
[27:36] man yes
[27:38] Hallelujah
[27:40] amen
[27:42] but here he says it's beyond Pentecost
[27:44] but the church has moved on it's gone
[27:46] into greater more powerful amen can I
[27:49] get some witnesses here amen are you
[27:51] believing for it say I am greater and
[27:55] more powerful amen amen amen yeah it's
[28:00] the restoration of the same kind of
[28:02] grain that went into the ground at the
[28:04] beginning
[28:05] what is it the spoken word the prophet
[28:07] now will break it down there what is the
[28:10] original sin
[28:11] what is his title he gives it away there
[28:15] the spoken word is the original sin
[28:18] what is Mark 11 23 if not the spoken
[28:21] word
[28:22] amen amen it's the restoration of the
[28:25] same kind of grain that went into the
[28:27] ground at the beginning bringing back
[28:29] all the fullness of the power of
[28:31] Pentecost by how
[28:36] amen who is the Holy Ghost
[28:39] amen the angel of the Lord

[28:44] his power of Pentecost by the baptism of
[28:47] the Holy Ghost see in the last days amen
[28:49] it's even more last days now than in the
[28:52] days of the prophets
[28:59] the closing of we're at the end of the
[29:01] last days we can put it that way amen
[29:04] but he says the same seed spoken word
[29:07] seed is coming back to the fullness of
[29:09] his power amen
[29:12] Sunday we were able to tell you amen
[29:14] that Jesus that God in the beginning
[29:16] said let there be
[29:18] and as long as there was no
[29:20] manifestation it remained
[29:24] when he said let there be light
[29:26] you have to wait to see the
[29:27] manifestation of that spoken word
[29:30] amen the prophet when he spoke
[29:34] you've heard that message he said I
[29:36] wanted to turn and go away the pro the
[29:38] Lord told him but you spoke it yes how
[29:41] long did he wait he said he was three
[29:42] hours late picking up those Brothers
[29:45] but he had to wait amen you see it's not
[29:48] in the speaking and instant
[29:53] do you have free to wait yes

[30:04] because you cannot see it you say oh
[30:06] nothing happened you turn and walk away

[30:15] this mountain amen be thou removed and
[30:18] cast into the sea and don't doubt in
[30:20] your heart but believe that what you
[30:22] have said shall come to pass amen amen
[30:27] speaking is one thing let me be light
[30:30] but you've got to believe your own word
[30:33] what is he trying to teach you how to
[30:35] operate in sonship authority
[30:38] Jesus believed his own word amen you've
[30:41] got to believe your own word amen but
[30:44] sometimes we are looking for instant
[30:46] things
[30:48] afraid to hold on to your spoken word
[30:51] amen free to hold on to the promise and
[30:53] how is he bringing the fullness of the
[30:54] power of Pentecost by the baptism of the
[30:57] Holy Ghost so if you want the fullness
[30:59] of the power of Pentecost what do we
[31:01] need to have the baptism of the Holy
[31:03] Ghost and didn't he say the Dynamics of

[33:09] place where the very works of Jesus
[33:11] Christ he's being manifested in the
[33:13] church now
[33:14] you believe that now he's being
[33:17] manifested yes amen amen you are the
[33:21] manifestation amen now the prophet will
[33:23] tell us here that
[33:26] how is he manifesting himself

[33:31] takes you to adoption
[33:32] and he tells you about the person that
[33:35] don't have time to train his child but

[33:40] pouring out himself he's looking for
[33:42] somebody who's now gone through their
[33:44] training
[33:48] you've had years of training

[34:02] how God took Jesus on the mountain
[34:05] and he adopted him and he said this is
[34:08] my beloved Son hear he him
[34:10] right so he says when a man proves and
[34:13] God loves him I mean if you believe God
[34:15] loves you amen if you believe you've
[34:18] been proven and God loves you
[34:20] hey man they're in front of angels he
[34:24] does something for him
[34:26] in the presence of his angels

[34:31] he lifts him up there in the presence of
[34:33] God and gives him and fills him and sets
[34:36] him out that's the age we are living in
[34:38] amen amen hallelujah
[34:44] amen how many of you can see yourself in
[34:46] that scripture coming to full adoption
[34:48] where the father is pleased with you and
[34:51] he says this is my beloved Son this is
[34:53] my beloved daughter here he him
[34:57] amen
[34:59] amen hallelujah
[35:02] we are in the brink of it and you know
[35:04] what the final stage of adoption is the
[35:06] body change
[35:09] amen amen the final stage
[35:12] is the body change
[35:15] he says when we need it the spirit of
[35:16] God raises the standard
[35:18] what is it he is pouring in his spirit
[35:23] amen catch this now you may not catch
[35:26] this but I want you to catch it it's
[35:28] always at all times that this power
[35:29] wants to go amen
[35:32] he says when we need it the spirit of
[35:35] God raises a standard do we need it now
[35:38] yes do we need the spirit of God now
[35:40] more than ever before
[35:42] just a deception all around without the
[35:44] spirit of God we will also be deceived
[35:46] amen the spirit of God Amen is is coming
[35:49] upon the word and he's giving us
[35:51] Revelation amen how to identify Satan's
[35:54] schemes he says he's pouring in his
[35:56] spirit
[35:58] that those who are resting yearly in the
[36:00] grave or under the altar of God as the
[36:03] scriptures say our crying how long Lord
[36:05] how long how much longer hmm
[36:10] God is waiting on you and me
[36:13] yes all mine who's God waiting on
[36:18] amen pay attention there now
[36:21] what's he saying
[36:24] how long Lord how long how much longer
[36:27] does that ring a bell
[36:30] amen I want to finish the quote First
[36:35] let's just go back to Isaiah right
[36:37] notice there now he's saying when the
[36:40] spirit
[36:41] and the church comes together there's no
[36:43] more scripture for you and I to fulfill
[36:47] next is the only thing left is for the
[36:49] sleeping Saints to come out amen
[36:53] so if we can Unite with the word and
[36:56] fulfill every promise there's nothing
[36:58] left but the resurrection of the Saints
[37:00] amen amen that's why I said slow it down
[37:02] read it properly
[37:04] he said he's pouring itself out in his
[37:06] Spirit now then those who are resting
[37:08] out John in the grave under the altar as
[37:10] the scripture says they're crying how
[37:11] long God is waiting on you and me amen
[37:13] come in line with your scriptures come
[37:16] in line with your part of the prophecy
[37:18] peace who United God fulfill all part of
[37:20] your scriptures then the dead in Christ
[37:22] shall rise
[37:25] amen
[37:27] Hallelujah
[37:28] he says the church is waiting on me and
[37:31] you adoption time when God can pour into
[37:34] us his fullness
[37:37] his power
[37:39] is resurrection
[37:41] that's when the church in Christ becomes
[37:43] so close together till Christ becomes
[37:45] visible amongst us amen amen amen you
[37:48] can switch for the Caleb amen
[37:52] amen
[37:54] amen
[37:57] I mean if you are looking for that amen
[37:59] I tell you we're on the brink of this
[38:02] yes I really believe that we are on the
[38:05] brink of this
[38:08] I don't type
[38:10] and now God is pouring in his fullness
[38:13] now as I'm saying this
[38:15] really you know what we're saying when
[38:17] the world is being preached you should
[38:18] be out there receiving it you should be
[38:20] saying Lord pour yourself out in your
[38:22] fullness pour yourself out in your power
[38:24] pour yourself out in your Resurrection
[38:26] Lord Make Me
[38:28] and you sow alike
[38:30] so close together he says to Christ
[38:32] becomes visible amongst us and raises
[38:35] the dead and we go into the rapture
[38:40] amen so after Revelation 10
[38:44] comes Revelation 11 which is to the Jews
[38:48] so if we are the final part of
[38:49] Revelation 10 and we can identify
[38:52] ourselves as being that John
[38:55] what's left
[38:58] it's only for us to come into alignment
[39:00] with him
[39:03] and as in the spirit being crying even
[39:05] you responded to the spirit's call to
[39:07] align yourself to God in this hour
[39:10] isn't that an expectation in our hearts
[39:12] now that any moment something can happen
[39:14] yes I am amen I have to be consecrating
[39:17] ourselves to the Lord
[39:19] to say Lord we want to walk so close
[39:21] with you amen because the coming of the
[39:22] Lord is so soon
[39:25] amen
[39:28] now if you go back one slide there
[39:31] let's see
[39:33] not there why go back
[39:36] how long how long
[39:38] isn't that fulfilled
[39:42] right so as I'm studying this thing
[39:46] these things connect that's the fifth
[39:47] seal yes
[39:50] the souls under the altar crying how
[39:52] long how long
[39:54] amen
[39:57] so it's not only the souls under the
[40:00] altar crying out long
[40:03] but those in the sixth Dimension are
[40:04] also crying out
[40:06] because that's a temporary Dwelling
[40:08] Place in a temporary party where they
[40:11] don't eat Don't drink don't sleep
[40:16] they know it's a temporary body
[40:18] and why are they crying all along
[40:20] because even there even though your
[40:23] denominational pastors tell you that
[40:25] they are resting in the arms of Jesus
[40:28] um
[40:30] there in the sixth dimension
[40:34] so they are also Longing To See Jesus
[40:38] so they are also crying out how long
[40:41] because can you imagine they are one
[40:43] step closer to us one dimension away
[40:46] from Jesus
[40:48] and they're crying out along
[40:50] but who's holding up
[40:55] ask your brother why are you holding us
[40:57] up
[40:58] now see you don't want to talk to one
[41:00] another
[41:01] ask your brother why are you holding us
[41:03] up God is waiting on you okay maybe you
[41:07] don't want to say that way tell them God
[41:08] is waiting on you and me
[41:12] tell them wake up
[41:15] God is waiting
[41:17] waiting amen God puts a responsibility
[41:19] back on us
[41:21] amen now
[41:22] Something Told me go to the fulfill
[41:26] amen so I go to the fulfill and I come
[41:29] across this
[41:30] because here
[41:32] in the fulfill he says I'm going to
[41:34] speak in the revelation of my faith
[41:37] what happened in Supino Canyon the other
[41:39] day I believe the hour is approaching
[41:41] when missing limbs will be restored amen
[41:45] amen and the glorious power of the
[41:47] creator
[41:50] Hallelujah
[41:54] but you've got to be the one to produce
[41:56] it
[41:58] what is he tying this now now if you're
[42:00] really spiritual I'm gonna break it down
[42:02] in a minute or two what happened in
[42:04] Japan came into his hand
[42:07] he says it's leaking sword
[42:09] what is it he says it's the word
[42:12] and he says this is the third pool
[42:16] so he is telling you here I believe that
[42:19] the owl is approaching when missing
[42:21] limbs will be restored amen and the
[42:24] glorious power of the creator
[42:28] amen
[42:30] will be seen in you and I yes
[42:33] you are going to be able to speak these
[42:35] things that's right Jesus spoke to the
[42:37] man with with that hand
[42:39] the power of the spoken word but you've
[42:42] got to recognize yourself as being the
[42:44] wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[42:46] you've got to recognize yourself it's he
[42:49] in you greater is he that is in me than
[42:52] he that is in the world
[42:54] amen he says I'm speaking the revelation
[42:58] of my feet
[43:00] the Yahweh is approaching
[43:03] why is he saying it in The Sixth Seal
[43:05] fulfill that's the seal that's
[43:07] uncovering the mystery of who is saying
[43:10] how long
[43:13] but in that seal where he says how long
[43:16] he's revealing this
[43:19] the power of the spoken word tying it to
[43:22] the third pool
[43:24] amen now many times we preach unto you
[43:27] and we tell you these Mysteries beneath
[43:30] it sealed you've got to be able to catch
[43:32] it
[43:33] amen these are some of the things he's
[43:35] pouring there nuggets nuggets nuggets
[43:37] but if your Source focused on the
[43:39] opening of the seal itself to
[43:42] you know to uncover the rider to uncover
[43:44] this you're going to miss the Mysteries
[43:46] beneath the seal amen amen
[43:50] he says now yes a quote we're ready
[43:54] before I'm going to read it again
[43:56] the Holy Spirit
[43:58] has been bound by these denominational
[44:01] Rivers for two thousand years can we
[44:03] close with the generator noise amen the
[44:05] Holy Spirit has been bound by these
[44:07] denominational Rivers for almost 2 000
[44:10] years
[44:11] who found it
[44:15] denominations bounded
[44:19] amen
[44:22] and it's to be loosed where
[44:25] in the evening time is it the evening
[44:27] time
[44:30] amen so who lost it
[44:32] he says by the evening time message
[44:37] they didn't know about the Holy Ghost
[44:39] and how its operation till William
[44:40] Branham came in on the scene
[44:44] that's why they still regard him that's
[44:46] why they still study his ministry his
[44:49] life
[44:51] is because through his ministry the Holy
[44:54] Spirit was left loose
[44:57] amen
[44:59] and the Holy Ghost was let loose for who
[45:02] for William Bradham alone but to
[45:05] everyone that followed the evening time
[45:07] message amen the Holy Ghost is an access
[45:10] to you
[45:11] amen desire the Holy Ghost amen seek
[45:15] after the Holy Ghost oh you see why do
[45:18] you say that I'm telling you we need to
[45:20] enter more deeper and deeper and deeper
[45:22] and say more and more and more and more
[45:25] of you Lord yes my cup fill me up Lord
[45:28] until I overflow amen I'm not satisfied
[45:31] with the poor partial outpouring but I
[45:33] want more can I get somebody to testify
[45:35] that they want more amen more Lord more
[45:39] power more anointing more of you Lord
[45:42] yes amen amen amen don't settle for just
[45:45] a little outpouring don't settle for
[45:48] amen for for half a cup yes say Lord
[45:50] fill me up Lord Jesus amen amen I wanted
[45:53] Lord Jesus yes
[45:56] you know sometimes you apply for jobs
[45:58] and they tell you you're not qualified
[46:00] amen tell the Lord Lord I'm qualified
[46:03] for this amen
[46:05] amen you chose me for this end time age
[46:08] yes you don't choose Paul for the end
[46:11] time you don't choose Martin irenius and
[46:14] Columba and Luther and Wesley and all of
[46:16] these people you chose me to peer at the
[46:19] coming of the Lord Lord you have some
[46:21] confidence in me Lord whatever you saw
[46:24] in me let me see it in myself Lord Jesus
[46:27] let me see my myself in your word yes
[46:30] amen the Lord chose you for this hour
[46:33] the Lord called you for this hour the
[46:36] Lord elected you for this hour oh
[46:38] somebody ought to praise the Lord yes
[46:40] Lord thank you Lord thank you thank you
[46:45] amen amen
[46:47] thank you amen
[46:52] Hallelujah
[46:55] now this is an important quote because
[46:58] let's skip one slide and go to the next
[47:00] one skip this yeah then
[47:03] it's important not to place and how you
[47:07] place the manifestation
[47:09] right the problem is going to teach us
[47:12] some things here
[47:13] he says you can't claim that the
[47:15] manifestation is the evidence
[47:19] follow now
[47:20] because he's building to something
[47:23] you can't claim the manifestation is the
[47:25] evidence of being Spirit born spirit
[47:26] filled no sir because gifts and callings
[47:29] are without repentance
[47:31] right
[47:32] I will admit that the true manifestation
[47:34] is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing
[47:37] Mighty Acts
[47:38] but it is not the evidence of the
[47:40] individual being Spirit-filled even
[47:43] though that that individual as an
[47:45] abundance of those manifestations
[47:49] right right this is deep teaching now
[47:52] but I want you to get something here he
[47:54] says the evidence of receiving the Holy
[47:55] Ghost today is just the same as it was
[47:57] back in the day of Our Lord it is
[47:59] receiving the word of Truth for the day
[48:02] in which you live Jesus never did stress
[48:04] the importance of the works as he did
[48:06] the word he knew that if the people got
[48:08] the word and The Works would follow
[48:11] now for all the people on the Earth
[48:13] right now who has the word amen
[48:17] amen so that's why we are looking for
[48:20] the second part
[48:22] it's because these signs shall follow
[48:25] them they believe amen we are the one
[48:27] with the true word we are the one with
[48:29] the true opening of the word and those
[48:31] words must follow the believer amen yes
[48:34] Lord got you yes
[48:37] amen thank you we've got to place it in
[48:40] the right order out there they chase the
[48:42] works first they leave the world they
[48:45] reject the word they hate the word
[48:47] amen are we forgetting that they don't
[48:49] but they believe in the trilogy of gods
[48:51] are we forgetting they don't even have
[48:53] water baptism right yes are we
[48:55] forgetting they reject the very
[48:56] scriptures that we show them
[49:00] but we have a general message of the
[49:02] Hour the full restoration of the word
[49:05] amen and when the word comes amen and we
[49:08] align ourselves with the spirit it makes
[49:10] us a super Church makes us a super race
[49:13] yes amen
[49:15] and produces the super faith in us
[49:19] amen he says I am the word if you want
[49:22] deity in your midst amen welcome and
[49:27] receive the word amen amen I know every
[49:29] one of you have received the word for
[49:31] your day you've recognize the word for

[49:37] only is deity now deity unveiled that we
[49:41] are amateur gods

[49:45] of God

[49:50] between you and that word not your wife
[49:52] not your husband not your children not

[50:31] I like the way she makes me color her
[50:33] toes
[50:35] sure
[50:37] you know the prophet says oh he's got
[50:40] two toes
[50:44] the girl couldn't leave the boy he's got
[50:46] such curly hair
[50:48] going after kind of things
[50:50] I don't tell if the boy looks as ugly as
[50:53] me

[50:58] amen
[50:59] if you want deity in your midst welcome
[51:02] and receive the word amen amen
[51:04] don't ever let anyone or anything get
[51:06] between you and the word why what did we
[51:09] say in the beginning
[51:10] who is the word god
[51:12] love God Amen love is word that word
[51:16] will produce faith faith will produce
[51:18] the works
[51:20] right
[51:21] this which I am giving you the word is a
[51:24] revelation of myself I am the word
[51:26] remember that
[51:28] he's talking about Jesus Christ now
[51:31] right Jesus is telling them they're in
[51:33] the Pokemon Church age I am the word
[51:37] so in his word he's giving us a
[51:38] revelation of Jesus Christ
[51:41] but you cannot tell me that you got a
[51:43] complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[51:45] without having a revelation of yourself
[51:49] because having a revelation of Jesus
[51:52] Christ
[51:53] gives you the and the Mystery secret
[51:56] that was locked up inside of him which
[51:59] is the revelation of the Bride
[52:01] that's the true revelation of Jesus
[52:03] Christ amen amen Jesus is incomplete
[52:06] without his bride that's right amen like
[52:09] Eve was taken out of Adam the full
[52:12] revelation of Jesus Christ is you amen
[52:16] for the complete revelation you become
[52:18] part of that story he says Let me give
[52:21] your thoughts here how do we pray we
[52:24] pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer
[52:26] is in his name and there isn't any
[52:28] answer yet
[52:30] 1 John 5 14 we are told this is the
[52:33] confidence we have in him that if we ask
[52:35] anything according to his will
[52:39] he here with us and we know that he
[52:42] hears whatsoever we ask we know that we
[52:46] have our petitions we decide of him
[52:49] now a lot of you have asked maybe you
[52:51] haven't seen it come to pass it is
[52:52] coming amen
[52:54] believe it is coming amen you ask the
[52:56] Lord yes you didn't ask him a closer
[53:00] you didn't ask
[53:02] fail on Service delivery do not equate
[53:04] my god with the anti-government until he
[53:06] failed in Service delivery
[53:09] he says whatsoever you ask we know that
[53:12] we are petitions that we decide of him
[53:15] amen
[53:17] now we ask what is the will of God there
[53:20] is only one way to know his will and
[53:22] that is by the word of God Amen if it
[53:25] isn't in the word you can't have it
[53:28] ah all right
[53:31] [Music]
[53:39] if it isn't in the word you can't have
[53:41] it so we can't ask unless it's in the
[53:44] world
[53:48] and we can't petition or ask unless it's
[53:51] in his name
[53:52] amen there it is again Jesus the name is
[53:56] the word
[53:57] amen and he puts in Brackets the will
[53:59] Jesus is the will
[54:03] right
[54:05] of the father
[54:06] of the Sun
[54:08] of the Holy Ghost
[54:10] know what they say in Catholics
[54:13] hey
[54:15] but in his name
[54:18] Jesus the name is the word is the will
[54:21] you can't separate God in the word they
[54:24] are one amen
[54:26] amen now I'm gonna tell you that you
[54:29] can't separate you and the world
[54:33] impossible
[54:36] if it's really reveals you can't
[54:38] surprise separate from the word
[54:41] Hallelujah
[54:43] you are the word made flesh today
[54:47] so heavens and earth may pass away but
[54:49] you the word
[54:51] will never pass away amen you've got
[54:54] eternal life
[54:55] okay we're heading up to now to a
[54:58] conclusion here
[54:59] now the word that he left behind on us
[55:02] in the printed page is part of him when
[55:04] you accept it by faith into a
[55:06] Spirit-filled life
[55:08] and I pray that we are laboring to enter
[55:10] into a spiritual life now watch what we
[55:13] said the spirit and word right that's
[55:14] what he's bringing it down to now
[55:16] the word coming into a spiritual life
[55:20] he said that his word was life he gives
[55:23] you the scripture right I am the way the
[55:26] truth in life if any man if not the
[55:28] spirit of Christ he is none of him so if
[55:30] you don't have the Holy Spirit you are
[55:31] none of him no rapture
[55:35] there it is he is the spirit and he is
[55:38] life that is exactly what the word is
[55:40] exactly what Jesus is is the word so
[55:43] when is Spirit born this is what I'm
[55:45] getting to know when his Spirit born
[55:47] spiritual man in faith takes the word
[55:49] into his heart and places it upon his
[55:52] lips
[55:53] why that is same as deity speaking amen
[55:56] amen Every Mountain has got to go yes
[56:01] amen amen
[56:06] you can't climb the mountain
[56:09] speak to the mountain amen
[56:13] maybe you turned and walked away
[56:15] I want you to go back to that mountain
[56:17] amen say listen yeah
[56:21] I come back with more faith
[56:24] in fact this time I'm coming back with
[56:25] perfect faith
[56:27] Mountain

[56:34] shalt be made a plane
[56:36] amen
[56:40] if you turned away and walked away from
[56:42] your situation
[56:44] if you turn and walked away
[56:46] from this mountain
[56:48] I want you to go back
[56:52] he says
[56:53] remember the title now the word plus
[56:56] spirit amen in the midst of a super
[56:58] Church here's the word coming to his
[57:01] Spirit born spirit for man in faith
[57:03] takes the word into his heart and places
[57:05] it upon his lips
[57:09] where must you what is he telling you
[57:11] come back to the spoken word amen come
[57:14] back to the third pool anointing
[57:17] if you're going to be chasing first pool
[57:18] second pool not going to work in this
[57:20] time
[57:22] come back to your authority sonship
[57:24] authority and I'm empowered to speak
[57:28] place the word upon your lips why it's
[57:31] the same as deity speaking
[57:33] Every Mountain has to go amen
[57:37] amen amen
[57:39] stay there till it goes
[57:41] don't leave till it goes
[57:44] Satan cannot stand before that man
[57:47] amen stop telling me Satan is always
[57:50] before you
[57:52] you know what you're telling me
[57:53] the word hasn't come into your spirit
[57:55] born Sunday

[58:15] Satan cannot stand before that man
[58:18] yes amen the other walk into the room
[58:20] and people get uneasy demons start to
[58:23] manifest
[58:27] that's why Satan cannot stand before
[58:30] that man why
[58:32] did he say Satan is powerless before you
[58:34] because of your Revelation amen you know
[58:37] all of his games
[58:39] you know it's nothing but a bluff
[58:41] amen that's why even in your home when
[58:43] you see him coming in you the priest of
[58:46] your home
[58:47] Authority cast The Demon out
[58:53] Satan cannot stand before that man
[58:57] you are an adopted son of God Satan
[59:00] cannot stand before you Satan is
[59:02] powerless before you
[59:04] don't go there and whomper
[59:07] somebody in authority
[59:10] you ever saw a policeman come here
[59:17] a man in authority
[59:19] speaks with authority
[59:25] if the church
[59:27] the church way back then that third age
[59:28] only and only held on to the revelation
[59:31] of the Living Word in their midst the
[59:33] power of God would not have faded as he
[59:36] did in those Dark Ages why I'm reading
[59:38] this
[59:40] we can see this pattern people are not
[59:43] holding on to the revelation of the
[59:44] Living Word in this hour
[59:46] and you can see the power of God fading
[59:50] don't let it be us
[59:52] hold on to the revelation of the Living
[59:54] Word
[59:57] that's in your midst
[59:59] God in you
[1:00:03] you know you know sometimes and I'm
[1:00:04] saying this now
[1:00:06] you don't even believe that
[1:00:09] God is in you
[1:00:10] you don't have a revelation of yourself
[1:00:14] it's like
[1:00:17] you can Rejoice with it but when you
[1:00:19] walk away from you do you really realize
[1:00:21] that you are God on the Earth
[1:00:24] God in the midst of you
[1:00:28] the power of God will not have faded if
[1:00:30] you see the power of God fading from
[1:00:33] your life know that you are not holding
[1:00:35] to the revelation of the word in your
[1:00:36] midst
[1:00:42] get back to reading his word amen build
[1:00:45] yourself upon the most holy word yes
[1:00:47] amen amen come on super Church come on
[1:00:50] super race amen
[1:00:55] and right today we're gonna close now
[1:00:57] and right today when the church returns
[1:01:01] to the word in faith
[1:01:04] we can say without a doubt that the
[1:01:07] glory of God and the wonderful acts of
[1:01:09] God will be in her midst again amen amen
[1:01:16] I'm telling you we are building up to
[1:01:18] something
[1:01:20] and right now you may be tied in your
[1:01:21] body
[1:01:23] maybe right now it's going over your
[1:01:25] head what I am telling you
[1:01:27] but when the church returns to the word
[1:01:29] in faith amen
[1:01:31] if you left your first love for the word
[1:01:34] if it's become stale and boring to you
[1:01:36] return to the word in faith
[1:01:39] amen come back to the word amen
[1:01:42] and you shall see the glory of God in
[1:01:44] your life amen amen you shall see the
[1:01:47] wonderful acts of God in your midst
[1:01:49] again amen yes amen hallelujah he says I
[1:01:54] believe if he can make a squirrel appear
[1:01:56] here is the man or woman just call him
[1:01:59] missing punch
[1:02:00] and that's a complete animal in itself
[1:02:03] he is God I love him this is the second
[1:02:05] part of the quote that he spoke about
[1:02:07] the missing limb
[1:02:08] he said if you can make an entire
[1:02:11] squirrel appear out of nothing
[1:02:13] what is a missing limb to him
[1:02:16] he says but I believe we are living in
[1:02:18] the hour
[1:02:19] where missing limbs will be spoken back
[1:02:21] amen and you know what I've seen it
[1:02:24] you've seen it yes
[1:02:31] how did you see missing limbs
[1:02:34] I'll give you a testimony
[1:02:36] one time there was a church went into
[1:02:38] complete blackout
[1:02:40] and the church is the body of Christ
[1:02:43] and he spoke the missing limbs back
[1:02:47] you are one of those limbs
[1:02:51] you were one of those limbs
[1:02:56] that's come back into the body
[1:02:59] you are with it in your denomination
[1:03:01] you're with it in your tradition yes yes
[1:03:04] with it in your religious thing
[1:03:07] but when the world came the opening of
[1:03:10] the world
[1:03:11] you know the opening of the word is the
[1:03:12] third pool
[1:03:15] amen that's the first part of the word
[1:03:16] the third pull the opening of the word
[1:03:20] when he began to call your name
[1:03:23] [Music]
[1:03:28] that's in the spiritual sense now
[1:03:31] every limb came back to the body
[1:03:37] is now fitly framed
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:43] he had come down upon the body
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:51] but now in the physical sense
[1:03:53] you stand up to your Authority
[1:03:55] recognize who you are as the son of God
[1:03:58] amen
[1:04:00] amen and I tell you
[1:04:03] when the church Rises to our full
[1:04:05] potential I know right now we are not at
[1:04:07] our full potential
[1:04:09] right now you're building up amen amen
[1:04:13] there's only so so much you can speak
[1:04:16] there's only so much you can speak
[1:04:19] there's going to come a time when there
