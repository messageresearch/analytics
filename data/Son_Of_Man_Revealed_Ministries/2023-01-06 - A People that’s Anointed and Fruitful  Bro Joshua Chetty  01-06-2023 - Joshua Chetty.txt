final words it is finished amen everything now some are trying to attain more righteousness but we already have the righteousness of Christ some are trying to attain Perfection but we are perfected in Christ amen everything we have need of he has already done it so there's no need to try in the flesh to attain it if we try in the flesh that's religion but when we can see that it is a finished work

our attitude towards the kingdom and realize that everything was paid or two thousand years ago what do you think Redemption is all about restoring man back to its position where you were given

some spiritual blessing oh with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ amen amen this is in this age amen all spiritual blessing all of the word amen everything has been unlocked amen amen we have the secret to the excess amen according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world he has chosen Us in him that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen you may be seated God bless the reading of his word okay thank you Jesus amen remember now we read the book of Joshua there now remember Joshua had to meet the captain of the Lord those amen so he made the angel of the Lord amen and now Joshua was instructed and he was led by the angel of the Lord and as long as he stayed with what Moses has given if he didn't turn to the left he didn't turn to right God blessed him yes and God blessed the people with him now let's see what he says in Matthew chapter 5 verse 1. and seeing the multitude that went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meat for they shall remember the Earth blessed are they which do anger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be full yes thank you thank you blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure enough for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are he when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say oh man oh man for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted day the prophet which were before you watch with the 13 now you say ye Are the souls of the Earth but if the souls have lost his Savor where would shall it be salted it is then fought good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under the foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid yes now God has let the city up amen God let this body up amen and you are the light of the world yes and this is the time where God has anointed you amen Joshua's call for that hour God has called you in this hour and he will call you he's anointed you for this hour amen amen and if he's anointed you and given you the opening of the word in this hour it means that you are people upon the Earth that's going to be anointed and fruitful yes amen because this is the hour if you do not bear fruit he's gonna cut you out this is an hour you're gonna be chopped down this is where it shows what seed went in the ground amen Because by the fruits you shall know them so it's not good just to be anointed because it also got false anointed ones in the end times but there has to be the genuine anointed ones in the inside amen amen and they shall be fruitful it's not because if they are false anointed ones are bearing for their fruits they are becoming fruitful their type of fruits you're not talking about the evil fruits that they're bearing what's the political system they can't hide anymore they're now becoming fruitful they're not big they now they're showing what the true fruits are so how much more in this darkness in the midst of gross Darkness they are the salt of the earth in the time to be salty so people can become thirsty for the true gospel It's A Time For Us when it's spiritual famine upon the Earth that people reach from a garbage can yes this is the time to now not contain what we have what good we will do what good will it do if we contain what we have but we must be the people that will prophesy again amen before Nation tongues and Kings amen we are given a mandate amen because we are the light on the earth amen neither do men light the candle and put it on their bushel but on a Candlestick yes and it give it a lot give it light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good words and glorify your father which is in heaven what's that saying now how do they glorify the father when they see the resurrected Jesus Christ when they see that the Jesus that was spoken of that raised from the dead is here again upon the earth when he's got vessels on the earth amen foreign so he's speaking tonight a people anointed and fruitful in this hour amen it's not good just to say I'm the anointed one in this hour God has anointed me as our but bearing not forth fruits amen because now this is the people that adding to the faith virtue adding to the faith patient adding to the faith knowledge Temperance godliness brotherly kindness all these things we're adding and adding we're becoming fruitful right there in the beginning when Jesus has given the Commandment he's speaking God is speaking to the Earth he's saying to man when he's treating man he said be fruitful and multiply so now that you have anointed in this hour you become fruitful yeah amen amen and if you keep this word this is an hour where the where the anointed ones are becoming prosperous in this hour God didn't just put you in the land of the Holy Ghost just to come and just stay in that land and say right you've got a little place there you got the word no he's put you in the land to be prosperous amen you put in the land to have success amen got your Bible said to the book of Acts 2 22. amen of Israel hear these words G Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinate Council and foreknowledge of God you have taken and by Wicked end they've crucified and slain whom God had raised up having loose the Pains of death because it was not possible that it should be holding of it so you see if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there must be miracles signs and wonders now a wicked in adulterous generation secret of the science but signs and wonders follows the believer amen amen we don't seek out the science but the signs are one of the must follow the believer and if you look throughout the Bible signs and wonders must follow the anointed ones acts 10 34 then Peter opened his mouth and said of it should I perceive that God is no respecter of person but in every nation he that feared him and work at righteousness is accepted with him the word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ that word I say ye no which was published throughout all Judea and began From Galilee after the baptism which John preached oh God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power so you see Jesus was anointed who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him so when Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost he be his ministry was successful yes amen his ministry was prosperous amen amen his ministry was fruitful amen that it impacted the entire place amen they said they never saw a man such as this yes amen it caused an impact it causes stirring it caused a religious stirring up that everyone was even the Pharisees said he says they always shake it up because they never saw a Time such as debts yes amen when God called the apostles the same thing happened amen when God called William Branham the same thing happened yes yes his ministry was so prosperous his ministry was so successful people began to become jealous of it and they began to lust after the gifts because they knew this it was a successful Ministry but he was anointed for that hour amen and we are with sorry and we Are Witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem and him God raised up in the third day and showed him openly not to all the people hey man when the word is open amen under the stuff but it's not to all the people but unto Witnesses chosen before of God Amen amen here's the word there God raised up the word amen amen God broke the seal the seal was broken and he comes out of the Tomb amen the word is raised up but it's not shown to everybody amen the word is not exposed to everybody amen when the seal was broken understood pool it was not for everybody it wasn't a public show yes but unto Witnesses chosen before of God Amen before the predestination amen amen you might want to take this word and explain it to everybody but when God broke the seals and the word comes what amen the opening of the word amen is not for everybody amen it was a rising of the sun Amen in this hour say amen amen but it wasn't for everybody chosen before of God Amen then we read that God has predestinated us and blessed out with all spiritual blessings yes in Christ Jesus even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that he which was ordained of God to be the to be the judge of quick and dead amen when he turned the picture to the right did you see what did you see there the judge of all the Earth amen to him give all the prophets witness that through his name Hallelujah they tried to steal that name for two thousand years amen but they couldn't do it they try to steal the name in this day amen but they can't do it they take they tried to take away Mark 16 as well because you're going to use the name there but they can't do it because you're going to have to use his name demons must tremble as that name amen you go try and cast The Demon Spirit without the name you've got to use the name amen that demon will obey demons will tremble yes that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remissions of sin amen amen and while Peter you expect this word the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word and they of the circumcision would you believe were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentile also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost amen not gifts the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then answered Peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then pray they him to tell him certain days amen and we find we are living in the hour now with the great holy spirit amen the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord is amongst us amen pouring himself out of all the amongst us amen we're not just talking about like how the the denominations we know the rain falls on the just and the unjust we're not just talking about the movie or the spirit with the the spirit falling down and having the gifts but we're talking about the Holy Spirit himself the gift of the Holy Ghost amongst us living in US amen and showing us all these Supernatural things that we've been witnessing now the thing that we are testifying in our home the thing that we are justifying in our daily lives yes the things that we can we can't deny that these are Supernatural things we can't deny that God is amongst us we can deny that Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever we can't stop bragging about it because why these are not normal things amen amen these are not just things these things were there in what form these things were there in the mechanics but now we sing it being manifested amen amen all these promises were laying there but now we see the application of these promises yes amen amen in our daily lives amen he says anyway Church says they believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and deny is power denies Works denies what the church that believed in Jesus Christ will do the works of Jesus Christ then the Bible says that when his ministry was on Earth it was with signs and wonders amen then if Jesus Christ is on the Earth again there must be signs and wonders amen to vindicate this ministry to vindicate that what we are saying is a reality yes amen amen amen so when you are there professing Jesus Christ amen because you are anointed in this hour hey man you're going to be fruitful in this hour because you anointed every place that your foot shall tread upon that place will have great success that place will prosper amen amen yes amen when you go now and you take all the all the promises of God's word and you apply to needs where the holy spirit is leading you remember this is the hour where the angel of God must lead you and when you are led by him amen then there must be a backing amen and he must come to back his word and he'll be leading you into a hospital room to pray for the sick then he must come and back his word and you will have good success there because you are being obedient to his voice amen amen and how you do how you become a pigeon to him first you surrender yourself to him yes then you take his word you meditate upon his words and his word become part of your life amen amen then your nature changes you don't love you no longer look after the old nature you don't want to want to do the things that you used to do because why you are so conscious of him amen you are so sensitized by the holy spirit in your life amen amen all you want to do you want to make sure that you nurture the spirit amen that you do the things that you create the atmosphere you created the atmosphere in your personal life you create the atmosphere in your work life you create the atmosphere in your home because why you want the Holy Spirit to work you are the only Spirit to manifest himself you want him to move amen amen hallelujah so that's what we are called for it is our amen and if it isn't no matter if the life is pouring into it if it's predestinated from The Roots it'll bear grapefruit every time amen or something different body which predestinated life in the roots in the same yesterday today and forever amen if it's the work coming up through the roots which he is the root the beginning of time notice but it's what they produce that tells you the difference by their fruits Jesus said You shall know them amen amen you're living in an hour where everything politics religious systems man can upon the Earth you can see the fruits now nobody can hide the fruits in this hour yes amen in the past the world looked at America let's look at one political system as a savior to the nation whenever they want to rescue they go to America because of the propaganda now you can see the true fruits in our when the world is in a certain condition America is stripping to impose sanctions on Nations that do not give Liberty to those people in their certain condition and a good example is Uganda you you Uganda impose sanctions they're saying if you are in this condition that's your condition but if you want to know go and share that condition with others like a virus spreading to others then we will import we will criminalize it or if you want to go and and now take this condition of yours and go and impose it on others we will criminalize it now America is saying because of what you are doing we will now impose sanctions on you all the funding that we used to give you the funding so to help people with HIV and AIDS the funding to help people with tuberculosis there's a big funding we're going to take it away now if you are really worried about people's life for something immoral you're wanting for people to die of TB you're willing to for people to die of HIV you're waiting for people to die because of your you want to allow people to be immoral you see the fruits are showing now the true fruits are showing so nothing no that's what the Bible said don't become a slave to any man the lender now you see what happens when you put when they give you all this money the borrower becomes slave to the yeah lender but you what I'm trying to get to now the world cannot write this condition yes yes religious system cannot hide this condition amen they cannot hide the fruits and you find that people that were starchy and formal and just come under the message by tradition they can't write the fruits either amen because if they had if they met has the gift of the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost himself then there must be an impact on their lives amen because if they are the gift of the Holy Ghost it means they'll be anointed yes and if they are anointed they must become fruitful and if they're fruitful they'll be prosperous and they will have success in their Ministry they will have success in the Holy Ghost amen notice but it's what they produce it tells you the difference but the fruit Jesus said You shall know them man do not gather grapes official even though the two still be right in the Grapevine that could be possible but the fruit will tell it what is the fruits the word fruit for the season the word food for the season that's what it is they're teaching they're teaching of what the teaching of the Season what time is it man's Doctrine denominational Doctrine but of God's word for the season is claiming to have bearing The Becoming being anointed and being fruitful then what word are you preaching in the season what word is being opening up to open up to you in this season because the Holy Ghost must come and open the word in a prison time and can't take you back and look in the review mirror you can't look in a past tense he must bring you in the present tense amen he says now remember that Moses was born for a certain work yes amen but he could not do that work until he had received the gifts which will enable him to do the work how many of us can testify and say Lord we realize what you are doing now we now know Lord that you have ordained us for a purpose yes and therefore now you have been enabling us and enduring us with power from an eye amen amen for the service yes yes amen he had to go out in the desert and went there God at an appointed time amen amen there to be a waiting or period and there to be a back of the desert experience he had to meet the pillar of Fire God had to give the son go to her to anoint him to go and conduct the ministry that you ordained for him amen and therefore God had to bring us in this day in this hour we have to be manifested in this season yes amen and God had to anoint us for this hour amen hallelujah amen and if he has anointed us and he has appointed Us in this hour then he has given us the ability to God and be successful in his hour to be prosperous in this hour amen now every place around the world you take the Bible from Genesis to Revelation you take this word you're going to be prosperous in that because God is going to open it up to you yes amen because the gift that is given unto each one of us amen God has given the five-fold ministry to bring you and direct you amen and channel you amen that you can use the talent that God has given you in this land and you cultivate that gift and you will have good success amen if you stay in your position amen stay in the word amen and stay where the Lord has ordained you you will have good success do not turn from the to eat from the left do not turn to it from the rights now this is dangerous because Joshua is having good success to feeding all the enemies amen but one day there was a family amen that will come and hinder that and then Joshua will lose some battles amen and then he calls the solemn assembly amen he calls the Solomon it is a time for consecration he calls the solemn assembly exposes the sin in the camp amen expose his Aiken and his family and they're still in the camp and then what happens he moves on to Victory next he doesn't stay there amen when you you see a true child of God with the Holy Ghost you don't stay in your circumstances amen you don't you don't look at make your circumstances weigh you down you get up and you move on Amen and you advance amen amen because while you're advancing is one with Christian Soldiers amen you look at the naturally Israel the Jews they come out of the Holocaust they didn't complain and Grumble we are yeah now whatever God put him there they still went and cultivate the land they became prosperous they became successful they never looked back and say look at what these people did to us look at this actually they did to us and they keep grudging and grudging no they moved on they never feel inferior because why they knew to them they still know that God is with them yes amen and because of that they advance and when they do something they don't do it small they do it in big if they want to go into a business they do it big because they're not they they you know why they take their dress because they know they have a backing of God yes they believe they actually have their genuine faith that if they go into business they have the backing of God so how much more us amen you might see a big set oh the person has cancer the person is dying the person is in the dead bed but you got the backing of God amen amen why are you freeing for little things when you have the god that created every cell the god that said the enemy is defeated yes amen amen why do you fear cancer why do you fear other ailments amen that the doctors have given up on the doctor has given up because his signs can only take it take him to a limited knowledge amen he's learning from the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil amen and he's and his education is limited but you got from a limitless God amen amen you got the wisdom of God and you got the backing of God the backing of Heaven he said now if you say if you get the people who believe you and especially in the circumstance of cancer if you get the people to believe you amen nothing can stand in your way not even cancer that's what the angel of God told the prophet amen make these things like him say Amen recognize your position recognize your backing amen recognize that you are anointed in this hour amen he said but what do we have in this our day multitudes are working signs until we have a generation of sign Seekers they know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of God if they see blood oil and fire they're happy that's what's happening all around the world now because they need to to keep people in church they need to keep people to to to so the the church Gatherings are not scattered and they have their wealth how else are you going to keep the wealth and the the lifestyle that they accumulated it matters not what is in the world they will support any sign even unscriptural ones God has warned us about that he said in Matthew 24 that in the last days the two spirits will be so close together that only their very elect could tell them apart for they alone would not be deceived how can you tell the spirit of the spirit and it works every time every time people will come jumping shouting hollering shouting the name of Jesus jumping up and down but take them back to the word and see how much shouting and jumping but when a person loves the word when a person is one with Christ another true revelation of word then he should be the one that's jumping and shouting because he is truly liberated Amen in spirit and in truth if those people can jump I know they have truths amen how about you that have truth amen how about you that knows how about you you that know what is happening in this hour amen that know that where you are going from here know that you have received the word that's gonna change this muscle

denominations will hate him his words may be harsh as John the Baptist are called them vipers but the predestinator will hear and be ready for the Rapture that's what we want yes amen we want to be ready for the Rapture amen the Royal seat of Abraham would like Faith as Abraham will hold the word with him for they are predestinated together amen amen Hebrews 6 1 says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and our faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism and of the laying on of ants and of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gifts and were made particles of the Holy Ghost In other words the gift of the Holy Ghost and by May partake is with him and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again and to repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to open and open shame for the earth now this is not for these people that tasted this now is people that tasted this true word amen amen amen those people and and it went away they once were enlightened but they never come to that point where it was it was now where they received it it was deep down in that Soul because once it's there he glided in that Soul amen nothing can take it away amen amen because once it's God it's once it's sealed in there once you are sealed in nothing can take it away yes but they were enlightened they chasted of this they were tasting of this you know the thing that we're hearing about another world and things like that and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again and to repent and seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame that is crucifying the word for the Earth would drink it in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bring it forth the meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that would bear returns and wrath is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned amen amen laughs so you see the hour that we're living in now amen this is an hour where the word that was already in you amen is now being manifested upon the Earth yes amen and maybe in the time pass people didn't recognize then look at you because you are just receiving and receiving the word but this is an hour now where you are anointed and when you anointed people must feel that anointing around man you look at the Old Testament when the prophets were anointed when they walked in the winter speed places people knew that those were men of God amen men and women in the in the book of Acts when they Apostles when the disciples when all of them were walking Whenever Wherever they went people knew that they were of God that God was with them because they wasn't Ordinary People they wasn't living their lives like the rest of the world you can't be an ordinary after receiving what you are receiving this hour you can't be walking around like
