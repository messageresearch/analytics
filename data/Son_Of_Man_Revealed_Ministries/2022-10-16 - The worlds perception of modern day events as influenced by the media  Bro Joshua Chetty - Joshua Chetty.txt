Lord as we look at this hour and all of Jesus and we look at the days gone by we could be grateful for the for where we are right now and we look at the Modern Day events and falling before our very eyes to the prophecy that has been revealed to God we are so glad to know the hour that we are living in our God while the world world is in fear while the world is in panic we are rejoicing yes oh one of these days you don't belong a lot oh Father this very word that came this world this people that he call it a lot they're wondering what are these under identified flying sources what if these days your property will pick us up out of here oh yes Hallelujah yeah they all realize what you have done amen amen but we are grateful of God for your revealing and debate such as would learn about amen amen and Lord we know that you're worth doing that's what is our lord Jesus we pray last morning that you'll be upon every believer in this place anoint our heart to receive from your thoughts amen anoint your words the believer this morning pray that you will and your Divine hands will be upon Me O Lord as standing over and bless you from your God those that are sick and Afflicted yes we ask you mercy and Grace upon us as we further carried your presence in Jesus name amen amen praises the Lord has been with us this morning amen as I Was preparing planning this excited to prepare for this weekend coming bring this blue Affliction upon me and we prayed the Lord's friend you know when you've got this condition you just want to be in bed and then in my in my home now but what boys are laid in bed the flu as well they can't even get out of it but we pray for the grace of God amen amen you've got your Bible to return to the Book of Genesis chapter 18. foreign remember before God deals with abrahamia we know in the Book of Genesis we also doubted Noah he had to give him a visitation to tell him about the oncoming storms of judgment and he had to reveal to Noah what he was going to do to the Earth and by divine inspiration instructed Noah what to do and how to prepare for the flood that was coming yes but prior to that God had in our country and God revealed to Enoch what he's going to do and Enoch walked with God in other words the level that he walked were not in man's level he walked with a level that that please God he walked with a level where he understood the ways of God amen he understood the plans of God he understood what God wants amen amen he didn't look at eyes through the wisdom of man he looked at life and the Earth at that time he looked at it to God's eyes yes amen because he was a prophet and God took him away amen and God did the same thing to Noah when Noah began to prepare the ark you're looking at what's going to happen not to the scientific age that he lived in yes because the scientific gate was a negative age right the scientific age would have took him away from God's plan but he persevered with God's plan and he continued preaching the same gospel amen absolutely the flood came amen the Book of Genesis chapter 18 verse 16. and then man rose up from dance and looked towards Elementary and the men rose up on theirs and looked towards Sodom and Abraham went with them to when with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation amen and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him you see godhead the Gentiles in his thoughts at the same time for I know him that he will command his children does God know us this morning amen amen that we will command our households and he's our Lord after him in other words are you going to pass this message on that will become an heritage and they shall keep the way of the Lord what is the way of the Lord in this hour to believe the message of the hour to believe what God has done in this hour than to believe what he's going to do amen hello and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgments that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he had spoken of him and the Lord said because the Cry of Sacrament tomorrow is greatness and because their sin is very Grievous do we see let us believe us today let the Cry of Sodom is great do we see that the sun is Grievous do we see there is that by the revelation of the word we cannot digest that as a Believer born and now that your part of God you you won't be able to digest what is happening in the certain condition I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which is common to me and if not I will know and the men tender faces from the end then went towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord amen homosexual Revelation chapter 11 verse 14. Revelation 11 14. the second war is passed old the third world cometh quickly amen thank God for the reading of his word the second war is passed two world wars are gone all right beyond the Third Woe cometh quickly yes all right yes Second World War I finished in 1945 from then to now we had rumors of wars we have the cold Wars that was going on for so many years but we're living in an hour where there's not going to be a cold war this is going to be a real war and the third world war has dawned upon the people and they not sensitized to it because man has become desensitized amen imagine that this morning we're going to speak on the world's perception of modern day events as influenced by the media we know the media is through the fourth dimension and contrast the faith civilization which is being influenced by prophecy amen you believe this morning you're part of the faith civilization amen I mean God is not going to come and reveal his word to us and show us that this world is going to be destroyed and there's going to be another new Earth created for us if it first didn't have a people have subjects for that Civilization amen amen he had to come and reveal to us that you are none of those ones you have to come reveal to us that your nature is your friends that you are part of me there's a gene that a place within you and when this word has come to you that Gene now Springs forth to life and and he began to develop and you started your spiritual journey from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are now being influent from another world but here we find the world's perception of all the things that are happening right now he's influenced by media and we know the media the mainstream media they are influenced From Another Dimension because why it's a scientific influence people underestimate the power of the media despite the fact that he's been used to overthrow governments do you know the media is more powerful than a nuclear bomb right the nuclear bomb is a destroy everybody but the media is so powerful then you can overthrow a government you saw what happened in Arab Spring to take this dictator so many years from being there nobody could touch them but he took social media to destroy the those dictators the major can break summer break the influence of somebody he can kill somebody's character the media can start and end the war the media can help or in the economic growth that's right it imposed modern time this is the time we're living now with advancement in media and especially with the majority of the world's population online because almost everybody is online you can't do any business you can't do any stuff you can't do anything without being online now it's almost impossible to find people who are not being influenced by what they view in the media from your latest fashions because you find the latest trends going on yeah whatever they use the latest Trend people follow it that's how people find the fashion your interior and actually in your home design so there's nothing that we can do if we don't see something that we we noticed on the media and the media can be used for good or you could be used for that right we get our ideas from there yeah oh intuitive destinations if you want to go for a holiday you will be influenced by what you see in the media before you go on holiday something got your attention something had to be advertised through the media and you decide this is a place I want to go that your career choices when you choose a career choice you'll see what is the best careers what is the latest career Trend what is the creators needed it's through the media somehow somebody is being influenced by the media but what I'm talking about now in the context of the modern day events we're talking about the wars that are happening right now right people's perception of what's taking place right now in Ukraine and Russia people's perception are what's taking place in the economic crisis people's perception of what's taking place with the oil all being influenced by the media but when God went to Abraham he revealed him why he was going to destroy Solomon tomorrow amen he revealed to him because of the condition [Music] no matter becomes so desensitized and been influenced by the way they've been fed through the medium of the fourth dimension that they wouldn't take the word of God and and see what God's word says about it now nowhere in the world or in the church world or in any religious World they will understand these things outside the message of the hour amen amen because God come and brought down the seals and already revealed what's going to happen yes amen he reached to us every nation's part in Prophecy yes yes we know where America's place is that you will speak after the Dragon she will become the mouthpiece yes we know that she ran away from Europe so freedom of religion yes and she was a great it was a great beautiful country typing Israel but they come an hour where she now must speak be the mouthpiece for the dragon amen and then she will go and persecute she will be the influence to go and persecute the true Christian amen America has become the police of the world but through the media and to propaganda America seems like the heroes of the world whenever there's a war whenever there's a conflict America want to go and interfering but if people can understand through the world that he was trying to control things and there was reason why they were trying to control things that's why the prophet said what when Russia goes down there and get control of the oil now Russia is not the Antichrist but the media puts it as Russia is this horrible person this horrible country and horrible Nation but Russia is only a tool in the hand of God Amen the prophet of God said before in World War II he spoke about France he spoke about them he said he said notice in France they started all their rottenness and going on the way they lived over there and then God sent Germany into them see their condition wasn't right then there had to be a tool to beat them up a little bit then we went over there to save their eyes and as soon as we done that and won the war send the Germans back at peace of France did they jump to God no sir woman why debauchery send them folks to the guilds then what do they do what happened yeah is where it started the devil set up his headquarters day [Music] there he there is where he started right there to demoralize the world from Paris and France right but we know also in that wow what happened there the Jews were interfered with because God had to also use that to get Jews back to the Homeland yes right because every wise dealing with the Jews even in the third world wow we know what's going to happen there you must come back to the Jews but we thank God that between that second world war and the Third World War a mysterious thing took place upon the Earth amen amen amen [Music] and therefore we are now being influenced by prophecy in this hour we are being influenced by what's been revealed in this hour and when we are being influent but then I become part of that word we become that prophetic voice in this hour amen amen we become that prophetic voice with prophetic actions with thus save the Lord that we are told that this very Russia is going to be used as a tool in the hand of God and it will destroy amen amen America it will destroy Vatican yes because that is prophesied amen no matter what the picture the media paints we know that America leaves NATO she is the leading nation in nature and now she got upset because Saudi Arabia wanted to manipulate the oil prices she wants to control the oil prices she wants to control all things and because why she if she wants to apply sanction from somebody she will do that and that's why when she goes into Washington running after oil or control of resources that's what Y is about when the world first World War I took place it was to reshape Europe the second world war the same thing it was to reshape Europe but the third world war he's gonna put the wall out of keita he's gonna he's gonna reshape the entire world Amen because why God is preparing a fake civilization amen amen a people that don't influenced by the Scientifics of civilization God is preparing a people he has subject upon the Earth that will believe every word of his amen that will take his words we're not debate with his words yes you want to take his word we'll never consecrated life because why nothing in this world can give them what he's offered them he's offered them eternal life he's offered them an eternal home and there's one in this day who's made up in the time of this great astronaut age yes yes amen he passed through and he went to the other dimension and he saw what it's like amen okay he says at the evening time events are made clear by prophecy what's taking place in the modern hour can be easily identified if you'll just believe the prophecy of the hour amen but do men want to believe prophecy they want to run to the media you don't want to know what's happening to one around and see what the news is saying yes why can't they go and see when the field was open that thing was already spoken about amen when this word was become an open book to us all these things that are taking place on the Earth all these modern day events was already spoken of Amen amen when you see it now you must just know he's just been prophecy being fulfilled yes amen don't go and look the media as a prediction um huh you know that this Global recession that's coming upon the earth now it was all manipulated it has to be manipulated because they have to come out they all have to go into this new world order and they have to share their commonwealths come into one system then they can trade because in order for Satan we have full control people must be able to have one form of trading one form of Commerce that was the start of globalization and who will reach the globalization it's America because America is the mouthpiece for the Dragon says looking around at the nature of the people seeing that we're in the spirit of the last days they had to get in the spirit of the angeluvian world before they could be destroyed they have to be in a spirit of War before they can have War yes and what's influencing that it's through the media yes right you provoke you provoke the nation what's gonna happen is going to raise your wall um we know that before World War II started Italy went in the next Poland he didn't whether he had intention of way to the world wow two or not but the health relations are interfering it led to World War II we know that Putin went in the next this country maybe he never he didn't have an intention of War but as nations are moving in and gearing in Japanese and and giving sanctions you tell me this country you don't get provoked and one man man property would press one of his buttons yes that's right someone that has access to the atomic bombs it's going to take provocation he said they had to be in the spirit of War before they can have War and he said God let us be in the spirit of Christ tonight amen amen so we can have Christ amen let us be the spirit of repentance and spirit of faith give it to us tonight Our Father the great Treasures of life amen they so freely just by asking realizing that the greatest things of life and the only real lasting things are the Unseen but weekends we can see with our spiritual life amen the things that the world can't see that the angel of God is here amen amen fixing things around because why he didn't really come and show us how that we must live a good only Keen life yes he didn't come and just tell us that you need to to go to church every week and quote the prophet and things like that no you come to show us firstly that we are not of this world Amen we have another species yes we are free Supernatural race hallelujah amen we belong to a different gene pool our genetics are different amen our makeup is different yes and that is why when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you cannot adjust this age that you're living in yeah this age where the media has influenced the people to accept all this LGBT groups and so forth when they make it seem like it's part of life where they make it seem that it's part of your ordinary life it's not ordinary to the believer yeah these things are not normal these things are not in the natural cause of man because the Bible says they will lose their naturally fiction yes these are abnormal things because why those demons that lost their first estate are on the Earth right now influencing man and all those filthy Spirits upon people that is why you need to have your spiritual eyes open in this hour amen it's either you're influenced by prophecy or either you are influence through the media I'm just using the word medium you know it's a fourth dimension but I'm using the word media because that's what we understand and one of the most common forms of media is social media because even your mainstream news when you come down as a thread it goes through social media faster and it spreads like wildfire so they have to be in a spirit of War before they can have a wall and we can see right now everybody becoming the nations are coming into a spirit of War because why at first they started trying to have negotiation trying to have talks out you can step out of this wall but you can see slowly but slowly becoming more tense yes and Russia is getting provoked Biden is provoking you can see what's happening and slowly it will increase the pressure he said this modern event is slipping by us truthfully and one day we're going to find out we'll be left behind without nothing and be caught sealed into the mark of the beast before we know it so he's speaking at a time because why [Music] speaking to those that just to the public out there to those that wouldn't receive this message they're going to be left behind those that feel it is coming to a messy Church and not interested in getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not interested in coming to the real message itself yeah you have the message within them and becoming the manifested word in his hours they're going to be left behind you have to become the manifested word in this hour you can't come by this message by tradition yes amen you cannot come in this message because somebody your parents told you about it you've got to have your own experience amen it takes every boy and girl every man and woman to have their own personal experience you don't mean nothing to me if the prophet came and I heard just heard the prophet talking about his experiences and about meeting the pull of fire it don't mean nothing to me if I didn't feel that same pull from within me if I didn't have a deep calling Within Me amen everything that he's saying to me will just be like a story to me it'd be like someone relating a story but there had to be a deep within amen thank you there had to be something to respond to the call yes amen something to amen that word like to study right when he spoke that squirrel and just told him about the squirrel there was something when he died that could say amen amen thank you don't let the message become a story to you amen don't let his experience about beyond the curtain of time be just some incident that you're talking about it's a reality yeah he went to that Dimension he come to testify I believe what it is and what it's like there he saw the people there amen thank you amen thank you hmm thank you speaking about this influence about demoralizing he said then if you notice he couldn't get in here through the ministry so the thing he done was come into early without you he set up his headquarters over here in Hollywood the devil landed back here a few years ago 15 or 20 years ago with his great Army and ready to hit in Hollywood California and he had invaded in the United States with his demon powers sure well the United States had a role to play they had to be invaded because they had to be an influence they come from there because United States had to be part of this prophecy amen right all of our Fashions come from Paris they get into Hollywood under the screens these little girls the little boys that think get out here they watch them stream please so he's talking about their time how it starts today our men will be influenced and we can see now a man is so influent that they will not listen to you telling them if you can generate let me show you what the prophet said that's going to be boring to them they would rather listen to what was on media it's more exciting for them that will have more of an influence to them but what the devil don't realize that he's using that same fourth dimension to influence people God can use that same dimension amen to influence people as well because in that same media or the same for same devices that captured the pull of fire same devices that capture the clouds yes yes amen and when we leave the earth when Moses and Elijah is on the scene the same media is in the captured and lying in the city amen and now they're raising up amen so in the same media is going to play in the day of judgment the same media that we're influenced by then he wouldn't believe what you are saying yes you wouldn't believe what the message of the hour says for this day yes he's gonna play on the day of judgment amen such and such a thing you love this media so much now watch it yeah but such a such a day this brother came and told you he warned you about the oncoming storms of judgments warned you about what is happening if you don't believe the word of God for your day if you don't believe this prophet's message for your day you're going to be left behind amen play for them yes the very media that they love so much and they will take it rather than what you tell them now we know under that the trumpets you know what he's trying to prevail we know we have to get you know through the trumpet the Jews got back in the Homeland because Jews have been part to play amen yes but also part of the same example the Earth was going to Mercury World War One put it pushed it out worldwide to push it even further worldwide three were pushed out of cater amen and that's what the wars was bringing he's trying to bring the bird paints and the example of purifying the Earth and we know World War III will ushering to the millennium the very Earth that man destroyed God said he'll destroy those that destroyed the Earth amen they pollution the Earth they're destroying creation with the scientific experiments and so forth with all the chemicals that they're using they put these gases into the air and he causes cancer and so forth destroys the environment around them that's why the second time you'll find birds are dying just fishes are dying from the water because the water has become become contaminated it's polluted with all the chemicals a mess destroying the marine life destroying the life on the Earth agricultural life all the life that you got is being destroyed because of man and his greed to advance in science because of his grief are we living in the time of a man has taken agriculture out and he's put buildings buildings buildings remove all the forestry destroying the Earth and now he doesn't have he can't make enough food to sustain the population so what they're doing now they're going to process food yeah going to food to to to use things scientifically producers to create for the methods but what he doesn't really is killing himself again how long can we carry on this Earth are we building our futures here knowing that God is going to destroy this us we should be shaping ourselves and getting ourselves into a condition then we'll get out into the Rapture amen amen we should be shaping ourselves to become sensitized to the word of God Amen Richard becomes sensitive train out here to be sensitive to the leading of the holy spirit amen amen that every move we make in our life whether it's in our workplace whether it's our home whether it's among our neighbors no matter where we are become sensitive to the leading of the spirit amen train your ear to spiritual things you know if you spend a long time with people you'll be influenced by the way they speak yeah you know your language and your the way you you pronounce your words you can be influenced if you spend a long time with people right I know when I I used to live without schooling a lot of people speak slightness and you know you live in Phoenix a lot of things so when you're around them too much you end up speaking slimes yes you don't realize it you unconsciously speak those slang and he happens in our work environment you know you get used to you just pick up a slang you don't realize it but but if you want to learn spiritual term spend more time with the word amen then you will understand spiritual terminology let the word like Seven Seals jump with all these things become your terminology yes let them become yours let them be something that you will always want to say amen amen practice it yes amen and what you confess because there's power in your confession confess that you are a son of God Amen confess that you are born again he confess that you are part you are you you are you are part of the inheritance of God yes amen you're part of the economy of God Amen you are rightful he is to that inheritance amen confess that every promise in the book belongs to you yes amen that must be your influence tonight this morning amen be influenced by the word of God being fluent that you are told in this hour that you have become the manifested word in this hour you are to be the one that must go and prophesy again the nation to turn to King don't leave for another day believe that if this is part of your prophecy amen yes and keep exercising that word and as you exercise that word before you know it you have to workplace somebody is talking then you're telling them about God Amen then you're telling them about modern day events yes amen they're telling you about the media they're giving you the perception that they believe through the media then you tell them but to properly who is that now you are becoming the final voice amen you're echoing that say man that you see the bus everyone said look at his bomb look at what Russia did now the killing civilians they're getting one side of the story then go and tell him how was how these things how the media puts what they do in certain places it creates a perception it makes you believe a certain story that one day what they want you to believe because we know we are living in the living in the day that God promised to reveal the entire mystery not some mystery the entire mystery of the book he didn't show us what is required of us to live a pleasing life because that will just make us a normal fundamental Christian and God loves them he wants us to live a pleasing life but he shows all that he had in his hands shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do we are part of the royal seal of Abraham because why Abraham was justified through faith and we are part of that fake civilization and he showed Abraham all he's going to do in his heart he's showing us all that he wants to do he's not what he's showing us here he's showing us what's going to happen when we leave here how we will come and work with the Jews always bringing them back in the Homeland yes he's showing us how he's going to renovate the Earth amen he's showing us how we are going to a wedding supper how we are going to come and Rule and train yes all the way from the time man fell in the Garden of Eden right to where we are now right to the opening of the sea God has revealed all these things what a privileged people we are to be amen imagine you would owe nothing from us in this hour and then what did Abraham do next when God showed him the condition of Sorrow Abraham began to intercede you see what I'm getting at um if you are influenced by modern day events to prophecy then you should be recognize the seriousness of the hour that you're living in you're right amen don't be like the people of the whole thing yeah just just in one of those conflicts that will be resolved you know what they think they think the United Nations will resolve their problems we know that a proper tunnel does just say puppets yes the United Nations you know what the United Nations come to an age countries we had them the other day yeah but in Durban I think everyone is afraid you know like everyone like given that respect that all of them they owe them at the highest team but they're just couples they can do nothing they expect the United Nations to bring sanctions and upon this Russia and with all the conflict why they don't realize the day when it land exploded and it was the first of September at that time and then I think he was on the 3rd of September they declared war Britain declared war Britain and France declared war on Germany it wasn't immediate it wasn't the same day so watch our things are unfolding now it might not be declared wise yet but behind the scenes what do you think they're doing why are they preparing the hair strikes and things preparing for what they don't realize they're not fighting with Germany who's lost the world this time prophecy has spoken yes God's word must come to pass amen amen this is not a prediction though this is prophecy human right so they you know you you go to people I understand every America is the hero in the united they feel little is strong NATO is led by America and everyone feels like strong but they don't realize that this nation has atomic bombs they don't have to even move the Army out there they don't need maybe they're losing in the troops but they don't need to use the truth the only reason uh Putin was using his troops that he didn't want to kill somebody if they go and use the bombs that they got they'll destroy the whole place but it wasn't the intention they wanted they wanted certain resources so nature would interfere with them so it's reaching a climax now and now we are one of those what are we doing we got a quick shot what to do because the hour is coming we must leave the Earth so we need to do what we need to do amen we know all these things are happening we know it's leading to World War III then we need to do what we're supposed to do amen amen Thomas prophesy again yes get the people ready try and win snatch somebody's Throne Out of Hell amen we don't have not everybody's meant to go in the Rapture but you can save the soul from hell because John saw a great multitude coming out of tribulation if you are really convinced because those that are full were the Holy Ghost cry and shy for the abomination of the Lost amen because this world back from each other he's not going to repent no the world is not going to reprint from the certain condition because that's what it said it would be and if they actually depend on God can't destroy the Earth and if it doesn't destroy the Earth then you have to go and say to Sodom and gomoro I shouldn't have destroyed you too he's a just God his judgments are just amen amen so we see all the nationally part of Prophecy we see all the the the parts they play foreign times if you look at the spiritual type or the natural type in Israel every time Israel went away from God what happened to them first time you ever can never came in next time after the time of day Maya and he is they came back again then they rejected the Messiah he was kept into all the nation of the Earth every time they turned away from God that's what happened yeah so he'll go into our personal lives you find a situation in your home go and re-evaluate your life yeah don't let the devil come and take you into captivity you will snatch you away so fast yeah yeah you'll influence your life because of the media and through this one dimension you influence your life and take away your faith and bring doubt yes amen he'll make you try and think like a natural man who thinks systematically think try to put something logically and logically explain something but if you open your mind and have a mind and allow the spirit of God to work in you might not be able to explain it in logical sense but with the wisdom of God you'll be able to see it from Genesis to Revelation because you'll see it light upon life amen precept upon precept yeah another word in that book a little in this book a little there is a little amen upon this preaching a little upon their preaching a little amen amen that's how the word of God is yes it's a mystery and you got to put it together amen it's not something for it's not something you just open there and you expect to just read it with logical sins you want to understand it is that the case you don't need a prophet you don't need the Holy Ghost you don't need a faithful Ministry God has put this thing this thing God has put his gifts in places so they can come and bring his word together to make you understand his great mystery to make you understand his plan and I and I need to understand why are you pleased you here so he picked you for a reason yes so he sifted you out and now he's working with you amen because he's preparing you for because he's gonna destroy me showing you now through his word that he must destroy this Earth he's showing you again that when you are prepared people you're gonna come and live in his faith Civilization now The Lion and the lamb can't be together but when you come back that lion and lamb would fit together [Music] because of sin the world is what is it what it is today amen can you believe this this entire Bible was written by the Jewish Prophets [Music] and all these Mysteries were healed but he took a gentile prophet in this day amen come and reveal the mercies that was hidden in the Bible they were written by Jewish Prophets you take a gender Prophet come and reveal all these mercies that were written by Jewish prophets and telling you what's going to happen to the Jews yes and to us so then Happening by gender of profit and he'll take a gentile bride Amen to understand all these things that no one can understand in this hour amen you know take a gender but like how you had a major prophet and you had a minor prophet you have one proper that goes off the scene then you have someone like Micah come and Echo to the world of prophet now you have this Gentile property scene there must be a gender of right to go and prophesy again not another word but the same words of the prophets but to make sense to it to place it in modern context to place it in your modern times and showing you all the manipulating the money system you're wondering why you're looking at the news every day oh inflation rate is rising inflation ready that's all you're getting worried about don't get worried amen you shouldn't be getting worried because you knew that's going to happen yes yes you know that you will have to manipulate the money system and you know all the wealth of the world all the wealth of the world goes to the Vatican and the Jews don't know the paper and they know that eventually they'll have to bring the Jews in together but you don't worry about those things he said don't you take part of what food you've been amen what clothes you're gonna wear in that hour when these things happen watch the third pool then you can see they're applying sanctions now that's what they do extensions you remember Church you're living in the best day that you will ever live in you'll say how can this be the best day right now because everybody waited for this hour yes until Jesus come it shall gradually not gradually say but rapidly get worse and worse yes and how long will it take this amen from this very poor but how long were you indigenous we didn't say it will get better we didn't come pray God is gonna make everything okay God is going to turn the situation around did we say that he said it's going to get worse amen and worse and what they did they call us prophets of Doom are we just telling you what the prophet is saying that's right because we must prophesy again amen he said when Russia goes down there to get that oil look out then all she needs yeah that's how the applied sanctions are going to go take away your resources your oil Integra but she needs that oil then what the prophet said he would do ready for it then but at the end time you know that there's an atomic bomb hanging out yonder in Russia with their names on it Jamaica because he came to a stage where he couldn't pray for him anymore he said America is doomed yeah right here in sex cartoon and you know that so that's the real rest of the world know it there'll be in the nation one of these days you know it's not far off it's just the end of a God holding it what's going to happen what did our presence say to the other night we want to keep strong let our aggressor know that whenever he drops a bomb is going to destroy himself too sure planes and great chains and great lines without gender with guns string right on the whole world every thing that person when he's influenced by that spirit because he's a truly man of God he's not what he wants that happened to him he's not interested in that amen so God is giving us braces our amen amen he said now remember they'll never be impersonation of that so he says and and that is the thing that we have looked for so long that's why I said this is the best day and you'll see why not for at least many years four or five years or maybe Long Island third pool has no now will be Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember they'll never be in personation of that because it can be it cannot be now it's in existence and I am warned of this that soon all right it is time now it just happened so it could identify its presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up and when he does now how did it influence the people to come again to you this very word through the media they will create that perception amongst the people amen the media can kill an influence of something the media can cause somebody so badly you can you can come and destroy somebody so badly the Pentecostal and so forth can almost impersonate it anything can be done but when the time comes when a squeeze comes down then you'll see what you see in temporarily being manifested in the fullness of its power amen so what is God doing now he's training us for Supernatural things yes amen he's training a supernatural race he took us all along this journey amen from the time becoming a message from the time we get cleaned up out of Egypt take the whole of Egypt out of us take out all the legacy of spirits amen and takes out of that spiritual amnesia because it was that word that comes to awaken us yes now the seven Thunders come to awaken us from that spiritual sleep that we was in amen that now you in the message knows that you can't call one of those denomination churches because you know they are Christians to you that's just religion to you it's because Christian is Christ's life some other will keep Christ's word amen so God is training us amen all is just been treating us with Supernatural things has been Supernatural yes even your very the very way you receive this message was Supernatural yes that's right and that's why if you want to see me supernaturally nobody can take it away amen and we've come now into the program of God we're becoming tune to God so much so that no matter what we see we can see through the eyes of God's word amen that is why you can't be deceived in this house right amen he said he will cut these shorts but for the elixir sorry for the electric you cut it short because everyone else will see but they just they elect will not be this so God is keeping us in his program so we won't be out of land of his word amen because he saw it in a vision he said stay in line stay in line what's keeping them in line it's a fight foreign keep them in line that's why you find those that wouldn't come under a fightful Ministry they fall they find themselves in a taxable condition but they wouldn't recognize it because they're not under five four minutes amen because once you're out there you only see it and they become influenced by the by the world and but when you come under the faithful Mercy you come under a conviction you come under an Egypt amen and then you become under Authority when you subject yourself to Authority then you're under a protection you come out of authority the order of protection that's right and in scripture because even Paul said why would Paul make a statement if somebody doesn't if a brother got a phone or a certain thing you want to speak to the brother doesn't take a witness he doesn't listen to that we now expelling more of the church it's communicating and you leave them into say to them because he knows when he's under the church he's under protection yes but you leave him there so Satan can deal with him yeah and then he can repent and come okay like The Prodigal Son right but why would Paul make just him he's trying to say that if you're under Authority and you subject yourself to it not just under Authority you subject yourself to Authority or under protection because The Authority that you under must be firstly a god-ordained Authority it must come under the message of the hour and it must be the 500 God has called amen amen and if God has called it then God must protect you amen you you come under the covering that'll be why he says if my brother be a fault pray for their brother amen lift him up for you too will be tempted amen and happy why you say if you're sick call the others of the church under the authority of the church so all these things putting you playing together all these modern day events are made known to us by prophecy amen the way we should live why we must do that why we come under the street civilization what God is planning to do to his Earth there must be disturbed worldwide but what the media has done desensitize the people he doesn't want to make the people who believed in the world maybe the people who believe that confidently can be resolved we can negotiate it out you can go laptops and solid out and they'll go back to normal what he said is going to get worse then worse and he said rapidly did we not see it from 2020 outing wrapping rapidly now so where we are now it's giving us rapturing Faith amen for his word amen because why he has to give us absolutely faith is about his world is going to burn up is going to purify it but we are happy amen we are looking up our Redemption is drawing by a man you're excited this morning amen you're excited that you are not being influenced to this fourth dimension amen to the influence of the media but you are being influenced by the word of God Amen you are being influenced to the spirit of Prophecy because you have become the prophetic voice in this prophetic age the final voice in this final age you must Echo again the work of the Prophet you must Echo these words of Prophecy again amen the world is in a certain condition and you must be able if you can't see that where the sound of conditions hidden right now we see them through the media in everything you see in the media is being influenced by the LGBT groups if you got spiritualized you'll be able to pick it up the entire media is being influenced by that you can't speak against them they've got more rights you've got no rights to tell them about the things that you believe in but they've got more rights than you he said TV programs oh female flesh and blood they are not Gods they're not goddess but it sets American Executive Order to fulfill the scripture America's number is 13 America's Shrine is a woman and you can see now the influence of women you've even given them holiday a woman's day a movement you see it in the workplace they have to employ more females they're males the employment Equity Act is there to suit the females and where it all started from America 's Shrine is a woman always it's our money it's on everything and now it certainly brings it to a time that we're going to have American goddess too not too far away you can see the handwriting on the wall oh what are we going to do you can't even walk out upon the street look out on the street start downtown and just see at the display of woman how that they make themselves with clothes on that honest to goodness a woman ought to be ashamed to stand in the dressing room like that walking out upon the street so tight a little bitty clothes and all these bathing beaches with his little thing whatever they call it and such things are dead and not knowing that in them is a spirit of evil with many of them singing employers that's what Jesus said will take place female flesh they are flesh and blood they are not Gods to my opinion God forgive me if I'm wrong it's the wholesale subtitles you cannot you blame a man if he's not a Christian but what would fall and fall into Temptations and to such a place that he would do something wrong till he could not hold himself it's amazing that there is not more ravages goes on because so many of it woman is in it but if it wasn't how could you blame the man put blame where blame belongs so a woman says the brother Brandon I'm just as moral as I no doubt about that but my sister do you know that you're going to answer the day of judgment for committing adultery when you throw yourself out there and men look upon you he said whosoever looking upon a woman to lust after has committed adultery when they are already in his heart and will have to answer for him now the way I'm getting it with this I want you to look at the spiritual the protests and churches have thrown themselves into such adulterous conditions in other words they they put themselves out there to go into the system that they could be ravished the mother called him back they could be ravished by the system and taken back because why they couldn't have virtue like this bride amen this Bride As a butcher she wouldn't just go out there she totally know what amen amen she had no words to quote herself she was naked rich and spiritually naked she wasn't stupid that's why he spoke about them the modern day many rock and roll Church but this bride has got virtuous amen this bride is clothed with the word yes yes this bride wouldn't just go and smile and show us seeds yeah foreign any man it's so easy for a woman to entertain men now laugh and joke at them you find a woman on the phone they're laughing and joking men but it just shouldn't be that way married woman should be loyal to the husband loyal woman should be fit married woman should be faithful to your husband amen foreign but that's the modern day you're living in you know as you would I don't definitely I don't deal with divorce cases but we help people when they especially we're getting traditions where you find the woman has committed adultery and relieving the man so that God want to take everything from the man so we just help them in case we had to do settlements so you see the condition of how these things take place so we know a woman entertainment now the devil does the same two sons of God today that's right watch our businesses most of our business is controlled by women lots of them that's right look at our churches look at our nation how the sons of God bow lowered the shine of these things these women when they are to me it's no more than public holidays that's an awful thing to say but it's the naked Church I know that people hear these children things will say these things but how can you do it if you present yourself like that and man look upon you as Jesus said you have committed the Lord so we see the size of the time if we see all these things that it's so relevant to now the work condition we are to put ourselves in amen we are to put ourselves in a rapturing condition because the only thing left now is for him to come and take away right amen we should be fulfilling our part of the scripture and at any time it should be now fulfill our part of the world Amen and get ourselves in that direction again get sensitized to the spirit while the world is desensitized to the media we should be sensitized and sensitive to the still Small Voice to the meaning of the spirit in all aspects of our life amen God needs to bless you understand [Applause] [Music] so there will be three consecutive services amen you believe that God Can Make A Way in our lives even when it seems to be no way amen and you believe that the grace of God is still out there yeah the fact that his word is being preached the fact that it reveals that things he still could pray he could still could claim his family we still could intercede on the Bell from his family we can still do the same thing don't you know you could be saved for the time as this Madagascar be there to intercede and be awful for people put in the palace for a time like that okay but she didn't go haphazardly and intercede but he registered to eat the seat she had to fast and pray she had to consecrate herself and she had to wear on the Royal parallel she had to present herself as the queen thank you present yourself to him with your identity as the queen yes amen and go to him sincerely for the consecrated heart included with that Royal petal the word of God and then when he sees you that virtuous bride you think he's going to reject you it's gonna throw forth and Royal accepted to you he's gonna stretch for his hand with the Royal sector we can offer you

hallelujah amen you appreciate the word of the Lord amen amen I believe the word of the Lord is timely and it's in season amen coming to remind us amen of the present hour of the present condition and the influences Upon Our Lives amen hallelujah and aren't you glad that we can feel to everything that's happening Through The Eyes of God's word amen all of these things were laid up and stored up for the bride to prepare us for this hour so that we will not be taken unawares yes can you imagine when the prophet was having seven major visions and when he was coming out that one Vision he had that voice screaming watch Russia watch Russia King of the North amen and here we are the old world is watching Russia right now amen amen you see Econo economies are crashing every day you look through Europe you look through the U.S inflation is skyrocketing they don't know what to do amen that's why they are fixing the prices in fact the true situation of the oil is is that they are pumping too much of oil so remember with this new green peace deal they need to get away from oil and all of these things so Saudi Arabia and them were pumping too much of oil so they decided to pump lesser oil and increase the price of their oil that's what the current conflict is about in the US is not happy about that because no you're still producing so much of oil and then nobody's using it we know there was a shortage of cooking oil if you go into your shops now see the prices are coming down so if the prices are coming down which means the oil is being increased amen the supply of it so you find amen after covet everything shifted they realized they needed a a control over this world systems so you'll find economies crashing the prophet says they will eventually crash that dollar amen Hallelujah whoever all those bonds has control over America because they own America amen so we find scripture you find the seals becoming alive if amen if you want to go through those seals again the seals are coming alive again amen we can see the prophecy through that amen and the Seven Seals were given to us you know no other Church world no other church beside the message church has the revelation of the Seven Seals that's what was given to us when that Mighty angel came down amen amen so we should never forget those seals and the what the impact of it is to us we see amen six trumpets had to blow to get the Jews back to the Homeland right right you know they're not going to get what they want what are they crying for you'll hear the year 5783 I think it is according to their calendar they are wanting to see Messiah I don't know if you know they won't see Messiah what they're going to see next two prophets come to them the expectation is not realistic and one of the true prophet's going to tell them you missed him back there he already came and then he's going to tell but there's been two thousand years of church history that's what they're going to preach to these Jews there's been two thousand years seven churches have come up and in fact there was a group of people just now amen amen all seven Church ages they've been raptured to Glory amen and that's what the day that Feast of atonement is about the trumpets amen the Tabernacles amen and you finally just went to the Feast of Tabernacles now all through each all through Israel they set up these little boots trying to recreate that Feast amen and just the other day I was watching they're trying to now slowly take vessels put water and they gathered in the lines of Israel and they're trying to perform certain rituals back again amen the things that they used to carry out you'll see they live with their trumpets you'll see them there filling the vessels with water so what are they doing what am I trying to tell you they are preparing they're getting ready because they can sense the hour and I want you to know that the bride will not be taken underwears God is fixing this bride God is preparing this bride she'll be the most prepared people in this hour because she has sent a word for this hour amen amen amen let's bow our heads amen sing one song is going to be dismissed amen God bless you amen Hallelujah I'm only in this message by grace
