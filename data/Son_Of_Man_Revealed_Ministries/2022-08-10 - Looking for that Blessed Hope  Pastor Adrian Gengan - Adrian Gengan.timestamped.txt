[10:40] amen
[10:41] hallelujah
[10:43] amen
[10:46] so for those of you who left your vocal
[10:48] box at home
[10:50] amen
[10:51] bring it back via transportation
[10:54] teleportation
[10:55] and bring your best amen to church
[10:58] amen hallelujah
[11:01] amen let's turn to titus chapter 2 and
[11:03] verse 11.
[11:06] we'll speak a little thought called
[11:08] looking for that blessed hope
[11:10] amen
[11:12] looking for that blessed hope
[11:17] hallelujah
[11:20] ii titus chapter 2 and verse 11 reads
[11:24] for the grace of god
[11:26] that bring it salvation
[11:29] and appeared
[11:30] to all men
[11:33] amen what brought salvation
[11:35] the grace of god
[11:38] that brought salvation
[11:40] and appeared to all men
[11:43] teaching us
[11:44] that denying ungodliness
[11:47] and worldly lust
[11:49] we should live soberly
[11:51] righteously
[11:53] and godly in this present world
[11:57] amen
[11:59] verse 13
[12:00] looking for that blessed hope
[12:03] and the glorious appearing
[12:06] of the great god and our savior jesus
[12:09] christ
[12:11] amen may god add blessings to the
[12:13] reading of his word you may be seated
[12:15] amen
[12:19] hallelujah amen we thank god for the
[12:22] blessings
[12:23] that he has given to us
[12:25] we failed unworthy people
[12:27] amen but the grace of god had appeared
[12:30] unto all men
[12:31] amen and he had redeemed us all together
[12:34] by his grace
[12:36] amen by election of god he has called us
[12:39] into this blessed hope that the apostle
[12:42] paul is talking about here
[12:44] into this blessed hope that we have
[12:46] tonight in christ jesus
[12:48] amen we seated here today we are
[12:51] anticipating
[12:52] the secret catching away of the bride of
[12:55] jesus christ
[12:56] amen and we know that this catching away
[12:59] the rapture to be caught up is a
[13:01] revelation amen we know that faith is a
[13:04] revelation so the rapture is something
[13:07] that has been revealed to the bride of
[13:10] jesus christ alone
[13:13] amen like abraham one man in his
[13:16] generation
[13:19] and like that scripture opens up in
[13:21] verse 11 the grace of god appeared to
[13:24] abraham
[13:26] in fact the grace of god appeared to all
[13:28] men in that day
[13:30] just like i would appear to us
[13:33] but the grace of god appeared to abraham
[13:35] one man in his generation
[13:38] and when the grace of god appeared to
[13:40] abraham he could say like isaiah 60
[13:43] verse 1 says
[13:44] arise
[13:46] shine for thy light is come amen
[13:50] abraham arose soon as coming
[13:53] amen abraham arose to meet the coming
[13:56] messiah
[13:57] the glory of the lord was risen upon
[14:00] abraham and his family
[14:02] amen behold darkness shall cover sodom
[14:09] and gross doctors the people
[14:11] but the lord shall arise upon thee
[14:13] children of abraham and his glory
[14:16] shall be seen
[14:18] somewhere else
[14:20] but his glory shall be seen upon thee
[14:23] amen if we want to see the glory of the
[14:25] lord look at his people
[14:28] amen amen his glory shall be seen upon
[14:31] thee
[14:32] amen now the promise was given to
[14:35] abraham alone
[14:36] he was looking for that blessed hope
[14:39] and the glory is appearing of this great
[14:42] god
[14:43] amen we find the bible tells us in
[14:46] hebrews 11 10 that abraham was looking
[14:50] for a city which had foundations
[14:53] was building and making his god
[14:56] amen he was looking for the king of the
[14:59] city because he met the king of that
[15:01] city
[15:02] amen he was looking for a city which had
[15:05] foundations he met him amen and
[15:08] melchizedek
[15:09] and then he met him at evening time he
[15:12] came to him in the form of an angel at
[15:15] evening time
[15:18] and the purpose of the visit was twofold
[15:23] i don't know what you came to church
[15:24] here tonight for
[15:26] amen by getting involved in the service
[15:29] don't be distracted
[15:31] amen
[15:32] hallelujah he came amen and with a
[15:35] truthful purpose one was to bring a
[15:37] message
[15:38] that it was time for sarah's body to be
[15:41] changed
[15:43] amen because it was the time for the
[15:45] promised sun to come amen
[15:48] amen 28 days
[15:50] according to the time of life
[15:53] it was going to be a changing of sarah's
[15:55] body
[15:56] amen it was going to be a changing of
[15:58] abraham
[16:00] hallelujah abraham was the only one
[16:03] noticed at this dissension only abraham
[16:06] entertained him
[16:08] when he came
[16:10] only abraham welcomed him
[16:13] only abraham recognized him amen to sort
[16:16] of he was the unwelcome christ
[16:19] amen they rejected him but abraham fed
[16:22] him
[16:24] abraham that communion with him at the
[16:26] end in time with his great god at
[16:28] evening time
[16:30] amen how did abraham recognize him
[16:34] amen hallelujah the grace of god had
[16:38] allowed abraham to recognize who was
[16:40] those men coming to him
[16:44] and the final sign that abraham and
[16:46] sarah had received was god in flesh
[16:50] attack of the son of man discerning
[16:53] their hearts with his back turned to the
[16:55] tent we also received the final sign to
[16:59] the gentile age
[17:01] this world will not see another sign of
[17:03] the revealing of jesus christ
[17:06] amen the final sign has been on display
[17:09] but they have rejected it
[17:12] when he stood there night after night
[17:15] with his back turned to them and he said
[17:17] i would turn my back
[17:19] and he discerned their hearts
[17:22] they were looking for entertainment
[17:25] amen the news report is that during
[17:28] brother branham's sermon these
[17:29] denominational people used to be asleep
[17:32] he used to be wandering and walking
[17:33] around but as soon as it came time for
[17:35] the discernment everyone was at
[17:37] attention
[17:40] they thought it was some entertainment
[17:42] but it was god in flesh again
[17:46] but they could not recognize it they
[17:48] thought that this just was just a gifted
[17:50] man
[17:52] and like
[17:53] these jealous type of brothers they
[17:56] wanted to lust after the gift
[18:00] that's what they wanted they wanted
[18:02] popularity they wanted fame
[18:05] they wanted to show like they got some
[18:07] kind of power
[18:09] but the only power that we have is the
[18:12] power of the holy ghost
[18:14] amen hallelujah the second purpose was
[18:17] the time of investigating judgment
[18:20] he come to judge sodom for their
[18:23] wickedness
[18:25] now in that day this was breaking news
[18:27] to sodom
[18:28] and exclusive flash across every
[18:31] publication
[18:32] the most popular magazine in sodom and
[18:34] gomorrah had published pictures of this
[18:37] unusual sighting and they called it a
[18:40] mystic cloud
[18:42] amen they thought it was some ufos amen
[18:46] or some extra terrestrial activity
[18:49] hallelujah
[18:51] wherever god's people are there is
[18:54] always
[18:55] terrestrial activity
[18:57] amen because the bible says in psalms 34
[19:00] and verse 7 that the angel of the lord
[19:04] encountered around them that fear him
[19:07] amen amen
[19:09] amen so there's always going to be the
[19:11] supernatural element attached to the
[19:14] children of god
[19:16] people are never going to understand us
[19:19] because of the supernatural
[19:22] now in the midst of judgment abraham
[19:25] steps into an intercessory role
[19:29] to stop the judgment and the destruction
[19:32] of sodom
[19:34] but notice abraham himself could not go
[19:37] down to sodom and gomorrah
[19:40] amen to plead with lot and his family
[19:44] probably had he gone face to face he
[19:47] might have convinced the entire family
[19:49] to flee from solomon gomorrah but that
[19:52] was not his ministry
[19:54] that part of the ministry was over they
[19:57] now had to listen to the two angels
[20:00] amen i hope we're learning tonight
[20:03] there's stages in the journey the stages
[20:06] in the ministry of the bride
[20:08] amen abraham was having an intimate
[20:12] conversation with god regarding the
[20:15] salvation of lot
[20:17] but he could not physically go down to
[20:19] sodom
[20:21] we cannot go back to egypt
[20:24] we cannot go down to these
[20:25] denominational settings where they have
[20:28] rejected christ
[20:31] they have got to listen now to the
[20:33] angels that were sent to them
[20:37] they have their own angels
[20:41] amen the first time locked in his family
[20:43] were physically captured he raised up an
[20:46] army and deliver them but this was the
[20:49] time when the book is now open amen and
[20:52] judgment is set he cannot do the same
[20:55] because now sodom has souls that are in
[20:58] prison
[21:02] they refuse to believe that this was the
[21:05] coming of the angels and the men of
[21:07] sodom amen refused to believe the sign
[21:13] hallelujah
[21:15] now when abraham looked at this same
[21:17] publication
[21:19] he told sarah look at these pictures
[21:22] that's the same one who appeared to us
[21:25] a man the same one whispered love
[21:28] secrets telling us to turn the picture
[21:30] to the right
[21:32] amen
[21:33] hallelujah
[21:36] let's focus on the
[21:37] 12th verse now teaching us that denying
[21:41] ungodliness
[21:42] and worldly lust
[21:44] we should live soberly
[21:47] righteously
[21:48] and godly
[21:50] in this present world
[21:53] amen we must live in present time amen
[21:57] present time has present conditions that
[22:00] need to be met
[22:02] amen we cannot be living in in 2022 and
[22:06] be trapped back in the 1960s
[22:12] if you were receiving a baptist message
[22:15] you'd be sitting here in 2022 but your
[22:18] mind will be transported back
[22:20] your spirit and your soul will be
[22:22] transported back to a time gone by if i
[22:26] was preaching the message of loser he'll
[22:28] be sinning in 2022 but you'll be
[22:31] receiving a spirit from a time gone by
[22:34] same with the spirit of wesley
[22:37] and that's why the churches have
[22:38] denominated and they cannot progress
[22:42] but the bride of jesus christ is on the
[22:44] move amen we are not stuck in
[22:47] 1965 amen but the bride has been on the
[22:51] move the holy spirit has been leading
[22:53] his church
[22:56] amen
[22:57] hallelujah
[22:59] what we find in the church world in
[23:01] their present world
[23:03] what's their condition
[23:05] in the present world
[23:07] amen we're talking about ii titus 2 and
[23:10] 12.
[23:11] amen
[23:13] says in the present world what is the
[23:16] present world looking for
[23:21] the prophet tells us they are looking
[23:22] for a superman
[23:26] amen
[23:28] but the church is looking
[23:30] for that blessed hope
[23:33] the bride is looking for that blessed
[23:35] hope
[23:36] but the church is looking for a wretched
[23:39] pope
[23:42] someone who can step in on the scene
[23:45] and solve the world problems
[23:48] they're looking for a superman who can
[23:50] solve the economic crisis
[23:53] they're looking for a man who can solve
[23:55] the political crisis
[23:57] looking for a man who can unite the
[23:59] religious crisis that we have
[24:02] but don't you worry they are best
[24:05] equipped with their superman
[24:08] because he was a writer on the scene and
[24:11] he has been riding in deception
[24:13] on a religious white horse so he can
[24:16] tick that box for them a man a deadly
[24:19] red horse
[24:21] to a black horse and is now in a mixed
[24:23] colored horse a pay loss
[24:26] yes
[24:27] amen
[24:28] and he has a name called death
[24:31] and the bible says that hell
[24:33] follow him
[24:36] amen but we also have a superman
[24:41] amen
[24:43] in the beginning was the word and the
[24:46] word was with god amen amen and the word
[24:50] was god
[24:52] and the word became flesh
[24:54] and the word dwelt amongst us amen a
[24:58] superman something that the world had
[25:01] never seen before the only time the
[25:04] world had witnessed this kind of a man
[25:06] was in genesis
[25:10] amen a man with authority
[25:13] a man with power a man with control over
[25:16] the earth like what adam was given
[25:18] control over the earth
[25:21] amen
[25:23] hallelujah
[25:25] our superman has come to equip a super
[25:28] woman in this hour
[25:30] amen to make a super church and a super
[25:33] race
[25:35] and we are clothed with his super grace
[25:38] amen the condition of the bride of
[25:41] christ when he is complete with her she
[25:44] is fully clothed this bride is fully
[25:46] clothed when our superman is finished
[25:49] with us
[25:50] amen she is dressed in royal apparel
[25:53] radiant and beautiful the church is
[25:56] equipped with power holy ghost power
[25:59] resurrection power
[26:00] an invincible army full of revelation
[26:04] hearts turn back to the fathers
[26:07] but the condition of their superman
[26:10] satan's bride
[26:12] is naked
[26:13] he is wretched he is blind and they
[26:15] don't even know it
[26:18] satan's bride is powerless yes
[26:21] less revelation
[26:22] no power but they are well equipped like
[26:25] their husband
[26:26] they have the same qualities of their
[26:28] husband because they can deceive the
[26:30] whole world that they are the church of
[26:32] the living god
[26:36] she took the spirit of her husband
[26:39] and in deception she is deceiving him
[26:42] through the economical move
[26:46] amen
[26:47] equipped like a husband to deceive him
[26:50] equip like a mother
[26:53] amen making people believe that they are
[26:55] the church of god
[26:57] but their hearts have not been turned
[26:59] back to their father
[27:01] their hearts have been turned back to
[27:02] their mother
[27:04] mystery babylon
[27:07] and her daughters
[27:09] amen amen amen hallelujah let's read
[27:13] some about this church amen let's see a
[27:15] prophet with prophetic insight speak
[27:18] about the church
[27:21] let's pick this up brother caleb he's
[27:23] quoting first timothy four and one and
[27:25] he's he's reading here this is in the
[27:27] church age book
[27:29] and he says now the spirit speaketh
[27:32] expressly
[27:34] why are we dealing with this remember
[27:35] what the scripture says
[27:39] deny ungodliness
[27:41] only lust we should live soberly
[27:44] righteously and godly in this present
[27:47] world
[27:48] i'm trying to show you the condition of
[27:50] the present world
[27:51] [Music]
[27:53] first timothy 4 and 1
[27:56] now the spirit speaketh expressly that
[27:59] in the latter times some shall depart
[28:03] from the faith
[28:05] we've seen it
[28:08] amen
[28:10] they are departing from the faith daily
[28:13] you'll see it on youtube daily
[28:15] everyday one popping up why am i here
[28:18] [Music]
[28:20] amen
[28:22] what are they doing
[28:24] giving here to seducing spirits
[28:27] you see what's doing it today
[28:29] seducing spirits
[28:32] amen doctrines of devils
[28:35] now in every case you will notice that a
[28:38] false prophet is one who is outside the
[28:41] world
[28:42] just as we showed you that antichrist
[28:45] means anti-word so these false prophets
[28:48] come perverting the word
[28:51] giving it a meaning that fits their own
[28:53] devilish ends
[28:55] that's the present world we live in
[28:58] have you ever noticed how these people
[29:00] who lead others astray
[29:02] bind them closely to themselves by fear
[29:05] [Music]
[29:07] they say that if the people don't do
[29:09] what they say or if they leave then
[29:11] destruction will follow
[29:15] you'll find that spirit
[29:17] notice it's a spirit we are dealing with
[29:20] even if your message church tells you if
[29:22] you leave the church you're gonna die
[29:27] you leave the shirt
[29:30] you're going to be the accident
[29:33] spirits
[29:34] trying to control the people
[29:36] [Music]
[29:37] amen
[29:41] notice how these people like judas are
[29:43] out for
[29:46] money
[29:47] they get you to sell all you have and
[29:49] give it to them and their
[29:52] schemes let's go preachers in every
[29:54] denominational pulpit
[29:57] the other prophet now
[29:59] discerning it
[30:01] how many of you know spirits do not die
[30:03] same spirits operating back then he's
[30:05] operating in these men today
[30:09] it says they they get you to sell all
[30:11] you have and give it to them and their
[30:12] schemes
[30:15] who wants to fund a bmw
[30:17] who wants to fund a
[30:20] mercedes-benz
[30:22] they spend more time on offerings than
[30:24] the world i mean if you can say amen to
[30:26] that
[30:27] you ever been in one of these services
[30:30] they spend more time on offering than
[30:32] the word
[30:33] is this a prophet or what
[30:36] and i guarantee you it may have not been
[30:39] so bad back then
[30:42] they have gotten progressively worse
[30:47] amen
[30:49] who attempt to operate gifts will make
[30:52] use of a gift which has a margin of
[30:54] error in it then ask for money
[30:58] and neglect the word and call it of god
[31:02] all and people will go to them
[31:06] and bear with them
[31:08] and support them yes
[31:11] yo this will look like it's talking
[31:13] about present present present times
[31:15] telling
[31:16] you they will support it believe them
[31:20] not knowing it is the way of what
[31:23] death
[31:26] yes the land is full of carnal
[31:28] impersonators
[31:30] in the last day they will try to imitate
[31:32] their prophet messenger
[31:35] that's what you are seeing tonight
[31:37] in the world
[31:39] they are trying to imitate him
[31:44] the seven sons of steve are trying to
[31:46] imitate paul simon the sorcerer tried to
[31:48] imitate peter their impersonations will
[31:51] be carnal
[31:53] they won't be able to produce what the
[31:55] prophet produces
[31:58] let me read it again they won't be able
[32:00] to producers to produce what the true
[32:03] prophet produces
[32:07] when he says the revival is over
[32:10] they will go around claiming a great
[32:12] revelation that what the people have is
[32:15] exactly right and god is going to do
[32:18] bigger and more wonderful things amongst
[32:20] the people
[32:22] this is your here
[32:24] this is your season
[32:28] and what does he say
[32:29] and the people will fall for it
[32:33] year after year
[32:36] they are better than noah
[32:41] year after year they can wait for that
[32:42] one promise this is your year this is
[32:45] your season
[32:47] some of them gone old and grey
[32:49] they're still waiting
[32:52] because
[32:52] you cannot reproduce a lie only the
[32:56] original seed can be reproduced
[33:01] you don't believe me
[33:02] look at everything the prophet
[33:04] prophesied about and see it come to
[33:06] fruition i'm talking about the bride i'm
[33:08] talking about your life hallelujah amen
[33:10] i'm talking about the super church the
[33:12] super race
[33:13] everything he said this bride will be
[33:15] she is
[33:19] amen
[33:20] now
[33:21] these same false prophets will claim
[33:22] that the messenger of the last day is
[33:24] not a theologian so we ought not to be
[33:27] heard
[33:29] they won't be able
[33:30] to produce what the messenger can
[33:33] they won't be vindicated by god as the
[33:36] last day profit is but were they great
[33:39] swelling words and with the weight of
[33:41] the worldwide
[33:43] the tory
[33:45] notoriety i can't see it they will warn
[33:48] the people not to hear that man
[33:53] amen
[33:55] and they will say he teaches
[33:58] wrong
[34:00] how can a man prophesy what they're
[34:02] going to say about him
[34:06] they are running exactly true to their
[34:08] fathers the pharisees who are of the
[34:10] devil there is placing them
[34:13] for they claim both john and jesus
[34:15] taught error
[34:16] now why do these false prophets come
[34:18] against the true prophet
[34:20] and discredit his teaching
[34:22] because they are running through to form
[34:25] as did their forefathers when in the
[34:27] days of heir they would stood makaya
[34:31] there were 400 of them and all of them
[34:33] were in agreement
[34:35] and by them all saying the same thing
[34:37] they fooled the people
[34:40] you got school of the prophets now
[34:42] you've got bible schools you've got
[34:44] seminaries
[34:45] amen and all of these cemeteries but one
[34:48] prophet he says now watch remember we're
[34:51] speaking about just one man abraham and
[34:52] his generation
[34:54] he says but one prophet just one was
[34:57] right
[34:58] and all the rest was
[35:00] wrong now when they ask you that
[35:02] question you mean only you're all right
[35:04] yes i say yes
[35:06] amen
[35:09] you know they asked that question
[35:11] you mean to say all the other churches
[35:13] are wrong and only you are right
[35:15] yes
[35:21] just one
[35:23] he says was right and all the rest wrong
[35:25] because god had committed the revelation
[35:28] to only one
[35:31] aren't you glad you're connected to that
[35:33] one yes amen amen why are you connected
[35:36] to that one
[35:37] you were sent to you
[35:39] the old i sent you
[35:41] elijah the prophet
[35:42] he is the one the revelation was sent to
[35:46] and he came to reveal it to you
[35:49] he says beware of false prophets for
[35:51] their ravening wills
[35:53] if you are still in any doubt
[35:56] about this as god by his spirit to fill
[35:58] you and lead you for the very elect
[36:01] can't be full fool
[36:03] did you get there
[36:05] there isn't any man can fool you
[36:08] amen
[36:09] why is he emphasizing this because of
[36:12] what happened in the garden of eden
[36:15] he's saying there's no man that can fool
[36:17] this bride
[36:18] paul could not fool any elect had he
[36:21] been wrong and in the first ephesian age
[36:24] the elect there could not be food for
[36:26] they tried the false prophets and the
[36:28] prophets are found there to be liars and
[36:31] put them out
[36:33] his sheep hear his voice and they follow
[36:35] him he says i believe it
[36:39] amen bringing us now to verse 13
[36:43] looking for that blessed hope
[36:45] [Music]
[36:46] we are not looking at now what
[36:49] paul was telling us there
[36:52] we have to live above the things of this
[36:55] present world
[36:56] and we are looking for this blessed hope
[36:59] and the glorious appearing of the great
[37:01] god
[37:03] and our lord and our savior jesus christ
[37:07] amen
[37:08] just like our abraham was looking for
[37:10] him
[37:11] we are looking for him
[37:14] amen what are we looking for
[37:17] ask yourself the question
[37:20] what are you looking for in this life
[37:24] are you looking for a better bank
[37:25] balance
[37:27] every morning you wake up to see your
[37:29] bank balance
[37:31] and every night you look to see the bank
[37:33] balance
[37:35] amen
[37:38] hoping that somehow
[37:44] it will change but all you have is
[37:45] change
[37:48] amen
[37:49] some are waiting maybe for kaiser chiefs
[37:53] sundowns to win the league
[37:56] some are praying for a miracle that man
[37:58] united is revived
[38:01] and win the league
[38:03] amen
[38:06] you'll have to wait forever for profana
[38:08] bafana
[38:11] to win anything
[38:14] but they think that that's what will
[38:15] bring them satisfaction in this life
[38:19] and that's what they're looking for
[38:21] they will invest time
[38:23] they will invest money
[38:25] they will buy the merchandise
[38:28] because that's where their treasure
[38:31] you'll never see them wear a jesus cap
[38:36] or a cross
[38:38] or something associated with the gospel
[38:41] of jesus christ
[38:46] amen
[38:47] some are looking for a woman
[38:50] to rescue them
[38:52] some are looking for a man
[38:54] to take me out of my misery
[38:57] what are you looking for
[39:02] some are looking for numbers
[39:06] phone numbers
[39:07] lotto numbers
[39:09] powerball numbers
[39:11] some love the book of numbers
[39:16] amen
[39:19] but what ask yourself the question now
[39:21] what are you looking for daily in your
[39:23] life amen
[39:26] a better house
[39:27] a better car
[39:32] amen
[39:33] we have to know what to look for
[39:37] some say some are looking for the wrong
[39:39] things even in the message some are
[39:42] looking for a return ministry
[39:45] some say they are waiting for the
[39:47] physical mark of the beast
[39:49] some are waiting for los angeles to sink
[39:53] some are waiting for the atomic bomb to
[39:55] fall
[39:57] some are waiting for trump to be
[39:59] re-elected
[40:03] but the prophet says
[40:05] that millions
[40:07] will miss it
[40:09] he said millions will go to church
[40:11] thinking they are being saved
[40:14] but he says they will miss it
[40:17] he says it's already coming god and you
[40:19] don't know it
[40:22] why they had the wrong expectation
[40:25] they were looking for the wrong thing
[40:29] what is that blessed hope
[40:31] he says we are looking for that blessed
[40:33] hope
[40:35] what is that blessed hope
[40:37] what is that we are looking for
[40:40] we are looking for glorification amen
[40:44] why because the fall brought sin and
[40:47] death
[40:49] but jesus blood cleanses us from sin and
[40:52] gives us the blessed hope of eternal
[40:54] life
[40:56] amen right now this body is subject to
[40:59] death but our souls have been turned
[41:01] heavenly amen we know that if this
[41:04] earthly tabernacle is dissolved we
[41:07] already have one waiting for us
[41:10] we are eternal as god is eternal because
[41:13] we are from eternity but we stepped into
[41:16] space of time amen to fulfill the
[41:19] purpose of god and amen the most purpose
[41:23] driven people on the face of the earth
[41:26] is the pride of the lord jesus christ
[41:31] amen people talk about a purpose-driven
[41:33] life
[41:34] you know that an author wrote a
[41:36] purpose-driven life
[41:38] a man sold millions and millions and
[41:41] millions of copies but people after
[41:43] having read that book still have no
[41:45] purpose
[41:48] because they have not come from the
[41:50] original source
[41:52] it's come from some man's idea
[41:55] but we have a purpose
[41:57] god has given us our purpose
[42:00] amen we know our commission
[42:03] we know we are the end of the gentile
[42:05] dispensation
[42:06] we know that we are asked to prophesy
[42:09] again
[42:10] amen it's a fresh word of prophecy
[42:14] hallelujah
[42:16] amen
[42:17] the most purpose-driven people on the
[42:19] earth is the bride of the lord jesus
[42:22] christ
[42:22] amen people who possess a gene of god
[42:27] we are not living unfulfilled lives we
[42:30] should not feel hopeless or helpless
[42:33] but god has come to give us a purpose in
[42:36] life
[42:39] amen we have a hope and we have a future
[42:43] we have an expected end
[42:46] amen the end was shown to us
[42:49] we know how it all ends
[42:51] we are at the end we are waiting for the
[42:54] end
[42:56] how is it going to end amen we have
[42:59] heard the shout out
[43:02] amen there's two phases to the shout
[43:05] there's one jesus coming to mary
[43:12] hello
[43:14] and there's one going
[43:17] and calling martha and saying the master
[43:19] has come and call it for thee
[43:25] and she secretly left the house
[43:28] to go where jesus was
[43:32] he is here
[43:35] he is here
[43:36] amen amen he's a monster living
[43:41] and what did he reveal to them that he
[43:43] is the resurrection and the life
[43:46] the shout
[43:48] but he is on his way to the grave
[43:52] with the voice of the resurrection amen
[43:54] he is on his way the shark was his
[43:57] descent amen but he's on his way to that
[44:00] sixth dimension
[44:02] the shark was telling you he is leaving
[44:04] the heavens
[44:06] that's why there's silence in heaven
[44:08] amen amen but he is coming
[44:11] from that sixth from that seventh going
[44:14] to that sixth
[44:16] tying right in line with
[44:18] beyond the curtain of time that jesus
[44:21] will come to the dimension
[44:24] and you'll be judged by what you
[44:25] preached
[44:27] and depending on whether you accept it
[44:29] or not
[44:30] we will amen go back to the earth and we
[44:34] will pick up our bodies
[44:36] amen hallelujah amen we are waiting for
[44:41] the voice of the resurrection and the
[44:43] voice of the resurrection is none other
[44:46] than the voice of the lord jesus christ
[44:50] the bible says that we will not prevent
[44:53] them which are asleep
[44:55] nothing we can do will stop will prevent
[44:58] them will hinder them from coming forth
[45:02] you can go and put concrete over their
[45:03] graves
[45:05] you can go and put a tombstone over
[45:06] their grave but ain't no grave
[45:11] gonna hold this body down

[45:20] when i hear that trumpet sound
[45:24] i'm gonna rise right out of the ground

[45:29] grave
[45:30] gonna hold this body down
[45:33] they are waiting for the voice of the
[45:35] archangel
[45:38] and only christ's voice
[45:41] can do that when he goes to that sixth
[45:43] dimension and bring back the saints from
[45:45] paul and his group to branham and his
[45:47] group
[45:49] amen
[45:50] they will come back to the earth to pick
[45:53] up their mortal bodies and together at
[45:55] the last trump we shall be changed
[45:58] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[46:01] we'll step right in line
[46:04] amen
[46:06] what we are speaking about tonight is
[46:08] not chicken food
[46:10] what we are speaking about tonight amen
[46:13] is eager food this is what we are
[46:15] looking for but this is what has been
[46:18] revealed to us

[49:06] and gave authority to his servants
[49:08] and to every man his work

[50:20] shall he find
[50:22] faith
