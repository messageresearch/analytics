========================================

let me before we go any further go back Genesis 1: 126 I'll pick it up Wednesday when God made man before he made man he called himself l e l l e l h l l oim the word means in the Hebrew the self existence all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence the ever was self-existence on l l Elohim means all sufficient all powerful allm mighty self-existence one Hallelujah but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am y a h u j u v H yahu Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existence one who has created something all for myself to be a son of mine are a temporary are an amateur little one of mine why he gave man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existence anymore he exists with his family Hallelujah el el Elohim now now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family now God made man to be the predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was God over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so amen there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him amen there you are Hallelujah all right brother nille you got first Peter 1: 120 read 119 and 120 but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was for ordained before for the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you when was he for ordained before the foundation of the world brother Pat read Revelation 178 for me the Beast that thou s was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world they behold the be that was and is not yet who's going to be deceived who's going to be deceived by this religious person like Saul was that was just so cunning and so perfect to it would deceive the what very e if possible if possible all right Revelations 13:8 let me read it for you and all that dwell upon the Earth sh all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names were not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slaying before the foundation of the world Hallelujah when was our names put in the Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world when God was Jehovah el el Elohim the self-existence one just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside of this diamond his attributes was a savior Amen in this attributes on the inside of him was a Healer Hallelujah well there was nothing to save and nothing to heal but his ATT produced it election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks the destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is but all of a sudden I become a wheat grain how did it happen uh that what is that election God before the foundation of the world elected that the CER was to become I'm a grain of wheat now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved how do I do it now let's read just a little farther and then we'll have to close pretty sharply according as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what did he do he by for knowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior self-existence but in him was a savior amen well what's he going to say there's nothing lost knowing that then he know that this great attribute in him would project something out under that he could save then when he did that by four knowledge he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it and while he did that he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved saved do you see what I mean by for knowledge amen the infinite God who know all things saw the lamb and he slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and he seen the deceitfulness of Satan what he would do so he put your name on there by election he chose them and by predes destination they know where they are going there you are now who could doubt that that's what Paul said that's Paul's scripture that's Paul's writing that's what he taught his church the church positionally before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body Amen to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that and then on next Sunday morning we're going into the positionally placing the church positionally placing the church where they belong each one how we're called by the adoption God has adopted us Unto the Sons we are Sons by birth adopted and positionally placed by the Holy Spirit
