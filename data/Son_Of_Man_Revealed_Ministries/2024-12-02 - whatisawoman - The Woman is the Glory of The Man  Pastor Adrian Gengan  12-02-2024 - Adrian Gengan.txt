feel hot and bothered amen hallelujah amen we are thankful that we can be associated with one another yes amen yes we are thankful for the band we are thankful we have music yes we are thankful we have good health we are thankful for all things amen you say you're trying to find reasons to be thankful count your blessings name them one by one amen hallelujah you say you have you come for Sunday school yes unless we come with childlike Faith yes amen amen amen praise the Lord amen so when we come into father's house we ought to have a rejoicing time amen we go everywhere else and we have a good time we come into the house of the Lord and we have a good time amen praise the Lord amen don't want to keep you standing for too long we'll turn to our Bibles praise the Lord first uh let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 many times we turn to the scripture to go to the communion but the opening verses of this is what we want to dwell on Amen I'll read the scripture and then we'll make our opening remarks amen praise the Lord from verse one it says be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ amen now he's got a reason for telling you this right if you're going to follow the Apostle Paul he's going to lead you in a journey he says now I praise you brother that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I have delivered them to you amen see so if you're following him you must keep the ordinances we can't say we follow the message of the hour and then we don't keep the ordinances right but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the and the head of Christ is amen praise the Lord now in a 21st century women don't like to read the scripture but the word of God is unchanging amen we can't deviate from the word of God so I want to reiterate you but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God Amen every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head now what is this covering the Apostle Paul Paul will detail that covering in a further verse down and but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with a head uncovered dishonor her head for that is even as [Music] one for that is even all one even as she even as she was shaven right for if the woman be not covered let her also be shown but if she but if it be a shame for a woman to be sha or shaven let her be covered now this is the verse we want to dwell on for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man now you see how in a 21st century they have tried to disassociate them they tried to make them live separately but yet here it's saying the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man amen sisters don't go into your shell amen praise the Lord amen I'm just reading the scripture neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is the man without the woman so man come be reproduced without a woman so they both need each other right neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of God judging yourself is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him so you see what the covering is but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for for her hair is given as a given her for a covering but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the Churches of God Amen you may be seated the Lord at blessings to the reading of his word I'd like to title it what is a woman amen what is a woman you'll know this title if you Google it if you YouTube it you'll know there's a question going on in the world what is a woman I think the man that investigated it or tried to interview people is Matt Walsh am I right brother Joshua is it Matt Walsh what is a woman the reason he's asking that question is because the political world and the secular world don't want to take a position on what is a woman because of the transgender movement and because of all the pressure because Sodom now is at its Glory Sodom is being exalted amen praise the Lord so everything is reaching its Pinnacle and they don't want to Define what is a woman the reason they don't want to Define what a woman is is because of Genesis they don't want to admit that the mystery is between man and woman between Christ and the church so what have they done now they started out with women's Liberation in the' 60s and they've come now and they totally stripped the woman of her identity that they can't even tell you what is a woman if you watch the documentary it's shocking that politicians are not able to take a position and tell you what is a woman they refuse to take a stand on that they will evade the question now if if I had to ask all the menia This Morning Show Me Your Glory what would you show me what would you show me would you show me your muscle would you show me your wealth and all that you accumulated your car your house what would you show me if I asked you to show me your glory because man has Glory right and that's where I get to my subtitle the woman is the glory of the man Hallelujah so sisters you can come back out of your shell because if your somebody ask your husband Show Me Your Glory they must point to the [Music] wife all right brother Joshua we need to put 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 7 again amen because now now the men have gone into their shell you see amen when we were reading the Scriptures it seems like the woman got into their shell but now the men have got into their shell what is the Bible saying men for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man amen amen hallelujah so we got both and men and women out of the shelves this morning amen amen praise the Lord let's take the origin of woman because we asking the question what is a woman we need to go to Genesis CH 2: 18 and see how woman was first created we're going to get along in this message but we just need to lay the scriptures because it's important for the younger people growing up they've got to know these scriptures and we've also got to instill in them because soon they will make choices in life and we have got to instruct them and lead them how to make correct choices many of you would know the choices you made was because of the ministry you were under that constantly told you what to do and how to choose amen so you got it I'm talking about Pastor Ronnie time to time he would speak to the people and tell them what to choose and how to choose and all of those things those things be you become impressionable it ingrains in your mind so when you are making choices you make the correct choices yes amen praise the Lord don't be ashamed to say Amen don't be afraid to say Amen this morning Genesis 2:8 we reading the word of God so we all be excited and the Lord said it is not good that the man should be alone first thing man is lonely without a woman amen praise the Lord it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him and help meet for him so what is woman to man a help meat so I'm going to help you know how to ask your wife for things so instead of asking you for tea can you tell her can you help me make some tea she's a help meat so you ask her can you help me make some tea can you help me do this and what is her job she's a help meat don't instruct a woman come here she is an help meat right and out of the ground so remember now this is after the sixth day creation seventh day the Lord rested so the woman was not in the original creation but she was locked up as a hidden Mystery inside of man okay and out of the ground the Lord formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all the cattle to the fowl of the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an Al meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slipped and he took one of his ribs and he closed up the flesh instead thereof so you see woman is taken from man not from the ground and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man now when he sees his heart starts to flatter he gets butterflies in his stomach come on Brothers amen and I'm giving you some time because some of you have to think way back amen but you know the first time you saw how you felt amen praise the Lord don't get too excited brothers and Shout amen amen what does Adam say when he sees her this is now bone of my bone who is giving her her identity man so what is a woman she's born of his bone it says here Flesh of My Flesh so the only one that can answer the question to what is a woman is man yes amen amen I'm giving you Bible now amen the only one that can tell you and Define what a woman is is man amen this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man that woman is a HED man a woman with a whom okay therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh okay then we'll go to Proverbs 18:22 so you see the origins of a woman Proverbs 18:22 says he who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord so if you're looking for extra favor get married find a good wife amen you see we have favor all the married men all the married men who have favor in the house this morning raise your hand and say I have double favor amen praise the Lord hallelujah see I'm preparing you now for romantic afternoon 4:00 amen you see your wife's going to be very happy with you because all of you raised your hand Proverbs 12:4 says I'm reading two versions here I'll read one version a wife of notable character is a husband's Crown but she who causes shame is like decay in his bones another the King James says a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is as Rott Us in his bones amen praise the Lord one more scripture and I'm reading from the Amplified Bible Proverbs study 1: 10 he says an excellent woman now that excellent woman is one who is spiritual capable intelligent and virtuous who is he who can find her a value is more precious than jewels and a worth is far above rubies or pearls so young sisters don't get excited when somebody gives you flowers and gives you things because you are worth more than rubies you are worth more than flowers all right so we we spoke about what is a woman it's bone of man's bone flesh of man's flesh identity is found in him so she shall be called woman right womed man she's taken out of man and now very important is that the woman is the beding ground for his seed to reproduce himself amen amen yes a man cannot put his seed in another man and reproduce himself right that's what Sodom is telling you yeah right can only do it by putting his seed in the bedding ground of a woman a man has no bding ground I'm going to say it in this way and I hope you understand what I am saying you can't take a seed put it in a trash can and expect it to grow it's got to go into the right Bing ground amen amen so what is a woman a woman is an extension of man and together they possess the power to reproduce another son and daughter of God Amen so ultimate glory is when man and wife come together and the woman reproduces the seed of the man and brings forth a child in his likeness and after his image hallelujah amen amen hallelujah I hope you're seeing the spiritual picture as well here amen hallelujah yeah in the in the choosing of a bride the prophet says now notice again how the natural bride types the spiritual the word says she was made for the man and not the man made for her okay all other females in the original creation Birds male and female animals male and female but in human life God only made a man and he took from him and the woman is the byproduct of a man because God did not Institute such a thing now listen to what he says here but if she can hold herself right the woman what a greater reward she has than man amen she's put on a testing ground and through her Came Death she's guilty of all death but then God turns around and used one one that's Mary now to bring life back again brought his son through the woman an obedient one amen amen amen praise the Lord so what is the meaning of Glory we'll just go through this again it's magnificence it's the Splendor it's the Brilliance it's the Beauty and the Majesty amen amen so I'll say this that the highest form of man's Glory will be found in the woman yes am if you're thinking spiritual now you know what I'm telling you yes amen the highest form of God's glory is found in the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen I'll tell you something now amen praise the Lord I want to get ahead of myself the highest form of man's Glory will be found in his woman that is God's design and pattern that is revealed in Genesis 1 2 and 3 and Ephesians 5 and 1 Corinthians 11 the design and hidden Mystery is that this mystery between Christ and the church Jesus and his bride that is why Jesus is presenting to himself a glorious church amen his glory is reflected in her am the woman is in His image and likeness taken from his very own side will be his greatest Glory that is the mystery of Oneness between man and woman they both shall be one flesh so no matter how great a man is in the Life in this life he is not not crowned with Glory with his Earthly accomplishments with what he owns with his wealth his Prestige his status a man can have all of this but man's greatest glory is found in the woman amen hallelujah I'm goinging Bible again man's greatest glory is found in the woman the most successful men need a good supportive wife loyal wife who stands beside him and supports him puts away because a woman is sacrificial she'll put away her own desires and She'll follow the man like Rebecca did willing to sacrifice everything they have to follow the man but if she is prepared to sacrifice everything and follow the man where are you leading her to amen praise the Lord so we find here that the husband loves the wife that's companion as his own body that's Ephesians chapter 5 now loves his wife as his own body and we know that the Bible is asking for the woman to be submissive to the man who loves her everybody understand a non-s submissive wife can ruin a man and she becomes water in his blood so you he the prophet is saying woman was made for man not man for woman that's just what the devil took the woman in the Garden of Eden for his instrument he is still using her amen now how many of you know that Satan is an original thinker he thinks of stuff original he doesn't counterfeit anything or is he a copycat so if he is still using her why is he using woman yeah absolutely amen you see as this Revelation unfolds we'll start to see our value amen and Christ's greatest Glory will be found in this time yes amen the reason he's using woman to this level and this extent and putting her in the Forefront is because God is putting his woman in the Forefront amenah amen he says not the converted not the converted the woman that's a Christian and a good woman is the best thing that a man could find Outside salvation praise the Lord amen the woman too can say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah you see you need to remind the man I am the best thing given to you outside of Salvation more than your offender more than your piis amen praise the Lord but one that ain't no good is the worst thing you could find Outside Solomon said a good woman was a jewel in a man's Crown but an unrighteous one was water in his blood his blood is his life so how much more could he have could he have than water in his blood it would kill him so we know the saying beside be behind every successful man is a good woman praise the Lord how many successful men we have here praise the Lord praise the Lord I know youve taking time but raise it raise it Brothers raise it I'm trying to help you outside of Salvation the best thing that God gave a man is a good woman Good Wife now have you ever asked yourself or maybe ask yourself now and consider it why did Satan go after the woman you see if you if you want to attack man what will you attack if you want man to fall and if you are jealous of this man you are jealous of his Godlike nature it's Godlike stature because you remember Satan wanted to be like the most high now God created man to be like him yes man is like the most high now this man is now your enemy you're envious of him you jealous of him you want him to fall you plotting his demise what will you do you will go for his glory yeah come on now yes yeah you may not have not seen the scripture in this light but if you want to attack a man you go for his glory yes so he goes after the woman because woman is the glory of man yes you get the woman to fall you take away his glory and Adam can't help it but manifest the attributes of Christ and go after his wife yeah amen amen praise the Lord so this was the glory of man the woman the one carrying his glory is the woman and but now she was easily deceived because she was a byproduct taken out of man now why does Adam ask another question now why does Adam take the woman and covers her by partaking of the fruit he in Christ okay the answer is he is redeeming his glory he's going after his glory yes he wants it back so he tries to redeem His Glory by eating the fruit and protecting the woman but he finds that the consequences are too great The Action the consequences of the actions are against God's word and the consequence is punishment by death and he loses his Godlike nature and Power power and he he loses eternal life fellowship with God power over the earth now this will require a blood Covenant and God responds in the Garden of Eden by coming and slaying a lamb this was typing the Lamb of God Jesus Christ that would come to take away the sin of the world and whosoever believes on him should not perish but have everlasting life can we give God praise for that amen he's redeeming us now I just told there in a very short thing summary that Adam went after Eve because that was her his glory Christ left the glory of Heaven the Splendor of Heaven to come for a greater glory woman is the glory of man Hallelujah yes Lord amen amen amen so the union between man and woman is meant to reflect the union between God and man now listen to this young people and those of you amen that's married or planning to get married man and woman Unite uned as one and this one man and woman under the headship of God that's the order man and woman will come United as one but they as one flesh must be under the covering of God okay therefore the word of God must be the core third core that binds any marriage for it to be successful when you hear Minister say Have Jesus in the center of your marriage don't have an imaginary Jesus this is the Jesus you should put in your marriage amen yes amen this is Jesus in print form amen for the marriage to be successful you must base it on the word of God to put God first in a relationship is to put the written word of God first to love God is to love his word to strengthen your relationship to have a healthy marriage the word the Bible must be the sensual theme you must be able to talk about the word you must be able to Fellowship about the word you must be able to have communion around the word amen praise the Lord don't just talk to your wife about what car you want what this you want what that you want tell her what you read in the word talk to her she'll tell you what she read talk to each other about the word of God if you want to strengthen your relationship read the word of God talk about the word of God Amen praise the Lord and everybody said amen amen amen praise the Lord some of you don't want to say Amen because you say I didn't come here for marriage counseling amen but we want strong marriages amen amen the woman is the glory of the man amen so we know the woman is taken out of man man glory is found in the woman who is under submission and reverence that's what the Bible says now she must not take man's Glory if she is representing man and reflecting man's Glory she can't take it and use it for her own purposes she can't be independent she can't be independent of man neither can the church be independent of the Holy Spirit this is a total violation of scripture when they talk about being an independent woman that's not according to scripture woman cannot be independent but she needs to be dependent on the man the two shall become one flesh the gospel of Independence the gospel of girl power the gospel of woman's right woman's Liberation movement is the gospel of Satan to M and Destroy God's original plan for for the union between man and wom yes Amen to pervert woman and to take away man's Glory yes amen that's right all that woman is is for the man she was taken out of the man so the Magnificent Splendor the majesty and the beauty is not to be used for our own self but it is man's glory amen oh Hallelujah I wish you would help me preach this morning amen Satan has exploited this by exalting the woman to a position where she becomes an idol she makes herself a sex object a symbol and and yes patent her and designed the woman to become an object of lust an object of Desire stri the woman of their decency and stripped her of her morals made her believe that she has equal rights when the Bible in said in Genesis 3 the woman The man shall have rule over you amen amen Satan knows the glory of a man is a woman so if he violates woman he violates man's Glory yes you see when a woman is not submissive to a man and does not reverence him she is taking away his glory and when a woman does not love his wife and give himself for her he is cutting himself off from his own Glory oh I need you to say Amen don't go into your shell amen hallelujah this is going to help you amen when a man doesn't love wife as his own flesh as his own body he is cutting himself off from his own Glory so you see both can cut the glory off a woman who is not submissive can cut the glory yes a man who doesn't love her as his own flesh can cut the glory when a man does not love his wife and give himself for is cutting off himself from his own Glory if a man does not take care of his wife he is not taking care of his glory amen if a man hates his wife he hates himself and hates his own glory amen praise the Lord you see glory is important to a man it's what gives him purpose he's like God yes if I forget the scripture you remind me right that God will not share his glory with any man you'll remind me when I say remind me okay I'm talking to you brother Joshua you'll remind me okay cuz this thought keeps coming in my head and goes away but I don't want to say it now amen glory is important to a man it's what gives him purpose what gives him reason to live God created him that way that is why man will Thrive when he's seen as a hero man will Thrive when he is praised by his wife yes if the wife belittles a husband and calls him names and makes fun of him it bruises his ego it crushes him because of his glory yes she's his glory yes the one that that he wants to admire him the one that he wants to look up to him is not not seeing him as he wants to be seen now this goes with praise and worshiping God as well if we do not praise and worship God we are not seeing him as he wants us to see him we are not worshiping as he wants us to worship him so a man needs praise and adoration because he is like God and the sad reality of it is why so many marriages end in adulteries and Affairs because what they were supposed to be receiving at home they are not getting so they look for it elsewhere man will go searching for it in Other Woman and woman will go find it in another man women thrives on compliments women likes to be told they are beautiful woman likes to be told you're looking good amen praise the Lord I wish I was talking to some married couples here amen hallelujah everyone went single amen praise the [Music] Lord now men and women become super glorious when this pattern and blueprint that God designed is followed and built upon amen married couples are problems when either one are not willing and no longer want to function according to the word of God as one unit with one goal one plan and they start to pursue their own plans yes amen amen praise the Lord you see that's what happened when I said the woman must not take the glory for her own self and exalted that's what happened in the Book of Esther yes amen this King put up es chapter one Hallelujah this King was going to display His Glory Hallelujah he called a feast Hallelujah 180 days 6 months to show the Splendor and the glory of his kingdom amen he showed his wealth he showed his possessions he showed his kingdoms but then when he came you know that that story is typing something very beautiful there yes cuz he called seven chamberlains right and what does he ask the seven chamberlains to do to go call vashi and we got it there right so you can see it's over 127 provinces let's go through it quickly amen hallelujah let's move so he's showing his kingdom we've gone through this he's showing it to the Nobles princes and everyone right he's showing the riches of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his his excellent Majesty many days even 104 score days 180 days right when those days were expired the king made a feast unto the people that were present both great and small seven days in the court of the garden right then he hanging all of these things amen praise the Lord watch what he's giving them now vessels of God I just want to show you the Splendor giving them to drink out of vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another Royal wine is in abundance according to the state of the king drinking was according to the law none did compel so there was no limit on the drinking the king appointed officers so vasti made a feast now she's using his glory she's the glory of the king she's having her own Feast for the woman so she's an independent woman but watch on the seventh day now seven Church age when the heart of the King was married with wine his command Paul Martin amen Columba amen hello amen he's commanding is he coming when is he coming the seventh day yeah does he come to the door in Revelation 3 at the seventh day knocking at the door amen everyone following the story amen so he's looking at Paul irus Martin columber Luther Wesley and Brandon am and he's telling the SA uh chamberlains that served in the presence of the king to bring vasi the queen oh yes before the king with a crown royal to show the people and the princes of Beauty for she was fair to look on he showed his own kingdom but he wants to show them his greatest Glory he wants to put his bride on display he's knocking at the door according to Revelation 3 yes knocking on the door wanting to come in what happens the queen refused to come she refused to open the door at the king's Commandments and by his chamberlains so the king's Commandments are coming via seven Church age Messengers amen the king's commandment by his shambling therefore the King was very rough and anger burned in him yeah what happens so the king said to the wise men which knew the times right now watch he takes another seven seven angels coming down they pick me up from off the ground so he convin a royal Council in the throne room of Heaven seven spirits of God Amen am amen he's Consulting he's having a conference not the seven Earthly Angels now night after night an angel came to me the seven spirits of God he's having a talk with the seven princes of Persia and media which saw his face what shall we do with Queen Bas according to the law okay so they're going to pass a law [Music] now let's go past this so they they admit so this is where we're want to get to for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes you see what's going to happen here now yes they're all going to rebel and act like vashi they're going to be independent and took man of their Glory when it's reported that the king commanded vas to come before him but she came not see there should be contempt let's move quicker than this amen if it please the king let they go forth a royal Commandment that he be written in the laws of Persian and me that it be not altered that vasti come no more before the king and let the King give a Royal Estate to another that is better than she amen I'm better than them you are called to this last day message amen is better than them what is he doing he's cutting Queen vasti from his Glory Hallelujah from his presence sh can of Glory no more you shall never see the king's face Hallelujah that is why we can't go back to them to try and find some presence and Glory there they are cut off from the glory amen hio amen praise the Lord now you know now you what happens the king looks for another wife he go through the story beautiful story you know why denominational people say they can't see God in the story they don't know the message of the hour you know they say this is one book the name of God is not mentioned but they can't see the types and the Shadows there only the message of the hour can preach it this wayah it's a hidden Mystery only two books in the Bible are written after women Ruth and Esther Ruth is being redeemed and Esther is Queen amen after Redemption she shares in his glory NOW Watch What Happens here you find that Aon starts to build his reputation with the King I'm telling summarizing the story Aon starts to build his reputation with the King and he now becomes second in charge the king even gives him his signal to start to make laws and decrees in the land so next in charge to the King after his Splendor and Majesty is Aon right he can do anything in the Kingdom that's why he starts to make this thing where everyone must bow down before him now watch this pattern it was the same thing in Babylon because they made an image and they wanted Shadrach mishak and Abednego to Bon before this image if you read the story you'll find that Moni was also taken in captivity during the same time am yes so they asked Modi why are you not bwing to Amon he says I'm a Jew and I will not bow down to anyone else but God so Amon hears about this and he starts to tell the king that there's a group of people here who don't serve you really well they have no use to you let's k kill them so he devises a plan to kill them right at this time Now esther is already Queen yes I'm going to ahead in the story Now esther is walking in as Queen with a title Queen but she doesn't realize Authority nor is it given to her after Kingdom yet there's a waiting period amen but at a certain time here comes the glory of the Lord why The Story Goes Like This monah goes to Esther or Russia gets word to Esther and tells Esther this is the thing that Aon has done if you don't get to the king and tell him and make petitions on behalf of your people you're going to perish and your people are going to perish yes and don't think you're going to be spared what happens is that Esther tells modah the king has shut his glory off from the people nobody can enter into his presence the one that enters into his presence Uninvited will be killed yes amen so she must make a decision whether she will enter into the glory Realm of the king hallelujah amen amen who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord but he that has C Clean Hands in a pure heart Psalm 24 amen amen She's Got to Now Ascend the hill of the Lord amen she's got to go into the glory realm yes amen he's not coming out she has to get inen come on now he's not coming back to the Earth amen I hope you seeing the message in this now well if you are you ought to start rejoicing right now amen get beside yourself and start to see the hidden Mystery in the story she's got to get into the sh Glory right amen nobody can come into the sh of Glory she has got to enter in because she has rights as the queen yes amen amen so she steps into the glory realm and when the king sees her he sees his glory coming in because the woman is the glory of a man oh I wish I was preaching to some people who was catching the Revelation this morning the woman is the glory of the man so when he sees his heart starts to get excited he sees his glory approaching in amen he sees the queen coming before him he raises his Royal scepter and he says what can I do for you what will you have even to half the kingdom there he gives her identity there he gives her the glory what happens in that instant when she gets into the glory realm she takes the place of amen amen she's now second in charge she's now joint ears amen praise the Lord don't be afraid to enter the glory realm thank you I never told you I want to announce this again I never told you this will be the most glorious year for the church maybe you misunderstood it I said you need to enter into the glory realm to share with his glory it's only for those who will enter into the glory realm thank you Lord that he will say sh in my glory remind me now what I was telling you amen sorry why God won't share his glory with any man because God won't share his glory with any man is because like a woman won't share her husband with any man sorry like a man won't share his woman with any man who's the glory of God Amen I'm I'm giving you another meaning of that scripture now pay attention God won't share his glory with any other amen yes are you catching it if woman is the glory of man and you are the glory of God Amen God won't share his glory with another yes amen yes amen amen praise the Lord oh there's some wonderful things in here amen praise the Lord amen now you know Brothers why I said we don't have enough time and services to preach his glorious Revelation amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah when it opens up it becomes glorious am amen coming out coming out coming out it's like a spring let's let's go to 1 Timothy Chapter 2 amen let's move along praise the Lord hallelujah I'm almost done with my first sermon amen you know the Lord has given us such a cool weather yeah that's right amen and I preached the message of an hour but I know you love double portion am amen praise the Lord 1 Timothy Chapter 2 says I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting right what are the men ought to be doing praying lifting up holy hands in like manner also the women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair gold pearls costly array but which becometh woman prophesying godliness with good works so what have you got to trade let's go back to that verse there you need to trade broided Air Gold pearls and costly array you need to trade that for what good works right that's what the Bible is telling you there now let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to Asser authority over the man but to be in silence for for Adam was formed first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression not withstanding she shall be saved in childbearing some of our women are going to be extra saved here not withstanding she shall be saved in shall bearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness and sobriety so the glory of a man is the woman and the glory now if you're wondering what the glory is the glory is not a natural beauty but it is a character yes here the prophet talking about the Church of Christ now he says may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristics of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in made be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people amen I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty right let me Define this and we can try and find a point of closing if you don't want to close it's also fine I'll see how the Lord leads right now amen so what does it mean to share God's glory how will he share his glory with us is it going to be something that is super duper how is he going to share his glory with us if the inspiration is sharing his glory in 2024 how will we share in his glory a good question right how will we share in his glory you can't be anything out of the word amen so potentially even in Ephesians 1:18 he talking about sharing in The Riches of our inheritance yes right the Greek word dxa means Glory Splendor preeminence and magnificence how can we share this we sharing it God is sharing his glory with us by allowing us to share his character am Hallelujah God's glory is a principal part of God's character yes and his goodness you remember when Moses asked Show Me Your Glory what did he said I'll let all my goodness pass before you right so to share his glory is to share his character and the life that he wants to share with obedient Sons and Daughters of God so the grace that abides in US is the revelation of Christ's good goodness I want you to understand this now I want you to understand this very important if you didn't hear anything I said this morning hear this because of the abundance of your Revelation that's revealed to you in this hour that is God's glory oh thank you Lord hear me again the Hidden Mysteries that are revealed to us is God's glory being revealed to us amen his mind being revealed to us yes amen he's sharing his glory with us amen yes Lord hallelujah the grace that abides in US is the revelations of Christ goodness if you abide in him his revelation will instruct you in holy living it'll teach you Mercy Grace tenderness forgiveness characteristics of Christ am thank you so when God Reveals His goodness he's showing his glory to Moses right similarly when God Reveals His Hidden Mysteries and shows us the thoughts he had in the back part of his mind from before the foundation of the world he is revealing his glory and sharing his glory with us give God praise come on now we become the glory of the Lord revealed in creation what am I saying his glory is spoken of in the word right and His glory is spoken of as Revelation form but the understanding at the end time is that his glory will become personified his glory will be seen yes his glory will become tangible his glory will become manifested and personified in a person called The Bride of the Lord Jes Jesus Christ the church is the bride the woman of the Lord Jesus Christ as a woman who is the glory of God the bride becomes the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ in this time when God ask us to be like him take his nature come into His Image and likeness and have his character that is him sharing his glory with us am no other people have been given this opportunity to have become Divine part become partakers of is divine nature am you got the pyramid picture there it's only 11:23 so it's fine amen praise the Lord hallelujah don't worry sister J I didn't forget to welcome anybody I'm just letting them settle meell amen we're all happy to see amen praise the Lord if you get that picture I just want to get in right but you know what I'm talking about I'm talking about the pyramid the stature of a perfect man right talking about the stature of the perfect man this is the glory of God if you can go up amen if you possess all of these qualities you will fully Express his glory hallu because when you come up he can't help but come down and Capt you yes here comes the glory of the Lord thank you Lord praise the Lord amen let's get back to our notes very quickly now amen hallelujah amen I've got such beautiful advice for the young people here and we'll see if I can get to it very quickly he says the True Church of Christ not this now next the True Church of Christ the bride he so sold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you right this is his glory now his character being revealed in you next he says she's pregnated by the word word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes this one body again like Adam was in the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him she has no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word amen character there was never a character like Jesus Christ it lives in you you see what he's saying the character of Jesus which is his glory lives in you manifest him we see it through it's not worldly beauty of him that attracts the bride his bride it's his character the character of the church that Jesus looks for amen he's looking for her character the character of Christ now just in moment that's it he chooses a bride to reflect his character when he saying character I want you to replace a word with Glory because he's no his glory is no different from his character his glory is no different from his nature I'm trying to show you as well in the natural when you're looking for a wife what to look for character that's your glory he chooses the bride to reflect his character to which the modern Church of today certainly misses his program here a million miles now he's looking for the day for that bride to be formed Hebrews 13:8 just exactly like it like he was it's got to be the same flesh same bones Same Spirit same everything just built exactly built up and then two then become one until the church becomes that they're not one the character of him the word for this age must be molded she must be molded like he is amen amen when we come into his character and likeness and In His Image then we are displaying the glory of God then he will share his glory with us amen now give the Lord a good Anup of Praise because that is the end of that sermon and I will very quickly I have to do this for the young people some people are are hungry now for this word here I promise you I'll go through it very quickly right Hal Hallelujah we started out you can go to the other the other set of notes there there's quotes over there amen I promise you I won't be too long it's now 11:27 so I still got 3 minutes of my old time amen praise the Lord hallelujah so you got the other set of notes hey it's in the folder there it's in there's only three files in that folder Sunday a.m. amen praise the Lord so first thing between man and woman there must be mutual attraction everybody agree there must be mutual attraction remember what we said now when God gave man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give him outside of Salvation right why am I saying mutual attraction it's in the word what the prophet is saying now see what he says first there must be mutual attraction right between boy and girl male and female but the word of God attracts the bride of Christ amen right he's saying the word of God attracts the bride of Christ so what is attracting Us in the spiritual oh yes to him the word and what he saying the bride attracts the attention of God by doing what keeping the word so that you see that mutual attraction amen amen the bride is attracted by the word of God and she attracts God's attention by keeping the word right now he says you know you have to plan look and pray I'm giving you very practical advice from the prophet now you have to do what plan so you must be a man with a plan you you have to look that we don't have to tell them they're very good at that right some people have very good poker faces here for the sub very good poker faces they won't give anything away I don't want to look around amen praise the Lord and pray you see you can't plan and look and then don't pray what is the prophet saying you have to plan look and pray this even though you're handling that computer brother Joshua this is for you as well right you have to plan look and pray okay then he goes on to say the only way in that you can now choose is to look for character and then if you love her amen ah I thought I must L first what is the prophet saying the only way you could choose first look for character then if you L fine I know you're going to be very quiet Young People amen praise the Lord let's all the people who already settled down and already made it and it's until death to you part let's say amen for them amen amen [Music] hallelujah now again the natural bride types of spiritual she was made for the man not man made for her right now he says you can't have all things there might be one girl that's real pretty and the other girl maybe a stature looks better than this one you might have to sacrifice one for the other and I'm thankful yeah the brothers didn't have to sacrifice there they got both and the brother said praise the Lord stay with me you'll get good lunch Brothers come on [Music] now you might have to sacrifice one for the other but if she's not the statue of a lady or a woman I don't care whether she's pretty or not listen young people I don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at a character whether she's pretty or not for nothing you must fight with her Hello to see a character cuz if she's coming there by house with the bush knife you better run [Music] boy don't wait till it's too late right he says don't look that she's just pretty or not pretty right and here the prophet said says now in the message kinsman redeemer When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like so don't think you look too awesome you see what the prophet is giving advice for the woman no matter what he looks like she loves him that's an eternal made in glory death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity they stepped out into space of time and will return back to Eternity eternity dropped down in a body called time then goes right back up to Eternity again it cannot perish praise the Lord don't keep telling your wife you know all wrongs will be made right there because she can tell you the same thing praise the Lord now yeah we're going to end very quickly now I don't have much notes I'm just giving you some practical advice here the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his Ambitions and character very important when brother Bram is referencing this its meaning is Glory will reflect a man's Ambitions and character that's Glory I put that in Brackets if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife it CHS what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he married and then in brackets I put because she is a reflector of his glory right if a Christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine Born Again woman regardless of what she looks like it's what she is what makes her and then again that reflects his own Godly character and reflects what's in his mind what's going to be in the future for his family will be raised by such a woman for the future plans for his home reflects his glory again praise the Lord now very quickly we come back to the spiritual side when you see a church that's in the world acts like the world anticipating like the world partaking of the world counting God's Commandments as he never wrote them you can can imagine Christ ain't going to take a bride like that could you imagine a modern church today for a bride not my Lord I could hardly see that remember man and wife is one would you join yourself to a person like that if you would it would certainly kind of disappoint my faith in you then how about God joining himself to something like that a regular denominational prostitute you think he would do it having a form of godliness but denying the power he would never do it she must have his character in the true genuine Born Again Church must have the character that was in Christ because the husband and wife are one if Jesus did only that which pleased God kept his word and manifested his word his bride will have to be the same kind of character she could not by no means be a denomination no matter how much you want to say no she's controlled by a board somewhere that tells her what to do and can't do right many times a million miles off the true word it's too bad we ever got away from the true leader that God left us to lead the church he never sent State presbyter Bishops Cardinals priests popes he sent the Holy Ghost for the church to lead the church right when the when he the Holy Ghost is come he will lead you into all truth reveal these things to you that I have told you bring them to your remembrance and show you things to come the Holy Spirit was to do that the modern Church hates that they don't like it so how could God how could she be bride of Christ the people today is choosing a modern denomination poor understanding of the word so here I'm closing now this is my last quote do you know the fall came by woman at the beginning the end is going to wind up the same way women coming into Authority ruling over men and so forth you know the scripture says that you know the day she puts on man's clothes Bobs her hair all those things are contrary to God's word you know she represents the church amen praise the Lord when you watch what women are doing you'll see what the church is doing that's exactly right the True Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him as his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in [Music] you now if the sisters are wondering where what part do I play in all of this you only told me about a man choosing yes that's right because a man chooses and you have the right to say yes or no don't just accept the first guy that comes to you check him out ask him how's your relationship with the Lord because that's your spiritual leader now don't let them lie to you after you get married they won't bring you to church after you married you have to come to church alone is that what you want after you married you're sitting and crying now you go make it your parents a day Choose Wisely accept amen wisely make the right choices amen I know all the sisters here can say they made the perfect choice they gave the perfect yes the married sisters amen all the brothers ask the perfect question will you marry me and all the sisters gave the perfect answer and said yes praise the Lord and believe it by faith amen hallelujah amen hallelujah greet your brother sister say God bless you I pray you enjoy the word of God Amen the Joshua looks like I caused more fights here than anything and solving problems here okayy everybody's [Music] got I may have to come do marriage counseling afterwards amen but you appreciate the word of the Lord the word of the Lord is true if we stay according to the biblical pattern I'm trying to show you that man glory is woman man's glory is woman so Brothers we all ought to do better see I'm including myself in this we all ought to do better because woman is the reflector of man's glory and all the men said amen hallelujah so the biblical pattern is wives submit yourselves to your own husbands husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her so it's a sacrificial love let's all stand together not too bad just 10 minutes over hallelujah praise the Lord okay I like happy people amen praise the Lord amen happy people happy Hearts joy of the Lord is our strength we can come before him and worship Him amen what a wonderful God we serve amen praise
