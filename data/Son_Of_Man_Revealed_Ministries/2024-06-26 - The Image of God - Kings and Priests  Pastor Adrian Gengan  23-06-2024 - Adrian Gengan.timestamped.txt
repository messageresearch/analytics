[1:46] the precious the holy name of our Lord
[1:48] and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[1:51] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:53] amen to worship Him amen you know the
[1:56] Bible says let everything that has
[1:58] breath praise the Lord
[2:00] am amen so that's our reasonable
[2:02] sacrifice to come and worship him and
[2:04] give him praise amen so we welcome every
[2:07] one of you in the house of the Lord amen
[2:09] good to see our brother Barnabas
[2:10] sisteron again amen may the Lord bless
[2:12] you amen hallelujah praise the lord we
[2:16] have brother ano ano is not local Amen
[2:19] brother ano Kumar is from India let's
[2:22] give him a hand amen
[2:25] amen amen his dad is a pastor in India
[2:28] so he's here visiting amen been with the
[2:30] Thomas family and now he's now with the
[2:33] David family amen hallelujah so we pray
[2:36] amen you be blessed with the word of the
[2:38] Lord my brother amen do you need an
[2:42] interpreter the only interpreter we have
[2:44] here will be the holy spirit because
[2:45] none of us can speak your language
[2:47] brother amen and then we have brother
[2:49] Wayne Amen let's give brother Wayne a
[2:51] hand amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:54] amen so we're going into the word of the
[2:56] Lord
[2:57] amen we were speaking last time time on
[3:00] the image of the word amen and we still
[3:02] got some thoughts around
[3:04] that because if the image is M then God
[3:06] must bring us back to the
[3:09] image amen praise the Lord so we'll turn
[3:12] to our Bibles in Genesis 126 we'll start
[3:15] there amen praise the
[3:23] Lord and God said let us make man in our
[3:26] image after our likeness and let them
[3:29] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[3:31] and over the foul of the air over the
[3:34] cattle over the Earth and over every
[3:36] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[3:38] Earth so God created man in his own
[3:41] image in the image of God created he him
[3:44] male and female created he them amen the
[3:46] Lord have blessings to the reading of
[3:48] his word you may be seated amen praise
[3:51] the
[3:55] Lord then we can go to Genesis chapter 3
[3:58] and this is now after the four and the
[4:00] Lord is speaking to Adam and
[4:06] Eve and he plants the first seed of
[4:11] Promise he says the seed of the woman
[4:14] shall bruise the Serpent's head the
[4:16] first Prophecy in the Bible making way
[4:20] for the Redemption of man now God is a
[4:22] god of purpose amen when God's God's
[4:25] purpose will never be defeated if he has
[4:28] set man to be in His image amen after
[4:30] his likeness even though sin came in and
[4:32] Mar that plan he's going to bring a
[4:34] Redemption plan to bring you back into
[4:36] the image of God amen amen and I can't
[4:40] believe after seven Church ages and
[4:42] after Seven Seals have been opened the
[4:44] old opening of the word that we find
[4:46] ourselves short of coming back into that
[4:48] image and likeness something is wrong
[4:50] and it is not with God's word it is
[4:53] something is wrong with us and I'm going
[4:55] to be bold and say something is also
[4:57] wrong with the fivefold ministry because
[5:00] they are not positioning the people in
[5:01] the word they got them looking off on
[5:03] this thing and on this thing but they
[5:05] are making a mistake and not focusing on
[5:07] the main thing amen where God wants to
[5:10] find expression amen hallelujah praise
[5:14] the Lord amen don't be don't be alarmed
[5:17] amen you may be thinking why is the
[5:19] ministry going this way if I Am The
[5:21] Shepherd of the church a pastor mean
[5:24] Shepherd amen I must lead the flock of
[5:26] God which means I must be connected with
[5:29] the guide yes I must be connected with
[5:31] the spirit of Truth amen I must be
[5:33] connected with the teacher I must be
[5:35] connected with the angel of God Exodus
[5:39] 23:23 behold I sent my angel before thee
[5:42] to keep thee in the way too many people
[5:44] have left the guide too many people have
[5:46] left the teacher too many people have
[5:48] left the angel of God Amen we want to
[5:51] read in Genesis chapter 3 and show you
[5:54] here what God is saying from verse 20
[6:00] here let's read 22 where the Lord is
[6:02] speaking and the Lord God said behold
[6:04] the man is become as one of us to know
[6:06] good and evil and now lest he put forth
[6:09] his hand and take also of the tree of
[6:12] life and eat and live
[6:14] forever so you see man had access to the
[6:17] Tree of Life this verse is confirming
[6:20] that therefore the Lord God sent him
[6:22] forth from the Garden of
[6:26] Eden to till the ground from whence he
[6:29] was taken so he drove out the man and he
[6:31] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden
[6:34] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[6:37] turned every way to keep the way of the
[6:40] tree of life amen so even if man desired
[6:44] to eat of the Tree of Life there was an
[6:46] angel guiding the way back to the tree
[6:48] of life amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[6:53] so the point we were showing you is that
[6:55] man the image of God the plan got
[6:58] stopped now the only reason God allowed
[7:01] the plan to be stopped is because God
[7:03] had thoughts of being a savior God had
[7:07] thoughts of being an healer God had all
[7:09] of these thoughts amen hallelujah of
[7:12] being a provider and he couldn't do this
[7:14] amen if there was no
[7:16] fall
[7:17] Hallelujah man would have been in his
[7:20] ought to be conditioned in a glorified
[7:22] body and they would have been no need
[7:24] for God to express all of these
[7:26] attributes amen hallelujah but in this
[7:29] logos now in mesic he's locked up all of
[7:32] these attributes that he needs to find
[7:35] expression have you ever wondered why
[7:37] the prophet says we don't see mesic
[7:40] anymore because as the logos is giving
[7:44] expression the only way you can now see
[7:46] the logos mdic is in the expression
[7:49] itself
[7:51] amen amen if you understand what I'm
[7:53] saying if you have thoughts in your mind
[7:56] and then all of your desires are
[7:58] fulfilled you will sort of empty it out
[8:01] into the formed Expressions amen so
[8:04] everything that was in the back part of
[8:06] God's mind will not remain in the logos
[8:08] anymore but it will fully Express itself
[8:11] on the earth amen so when I looking at
[8:13] you I'm looking at the expression of the
[8:16] logos thought of hellim Amen so I must
[8:19] respect you I must reverence you because
[8:21] you carry deity in your body you carry
[8:24] deity in your soul yes praise the Lord
[8:28] amen amen hallelujah
[8:30] amen so what we're trying to do is move
[8:32] the holy spirit is trying to move the
[8:34] Revelation from a revelation now to an
[8:37] experience amen hallelujah to a
[8:42] manifestation manifestation to make
[8:45] known Hallelujah now I I said this the
[8:49] last time what use if we reading the
[8:51] Bible and we see that that God is going
[8:53] to send a deliverer to Egypt to deliver
[8:55] the children of Israel now we come and
[8:58] we read the Bible we we go to Egypt and
[9:00] we say I have come to deliver the
[9:03] people they'll think you gone mad
[9:06] there's no children of Israel
[9:08] there they'll tell you hey Moses came
[9:11] years ago and delivered the
[9:14] people from here so you can't take
[9:17] another man's scripture and try to
[9:19] fulfill that scripture amen is what I'm
[9:22] trying to tell you amen neither can you
[9:25] take Malachi 4:5 and Revelation 10:7 and
[9:28] try to fulf fulfill it Luke 17 it's
[9:31] already fulfilled
[9:33] am amen hallelujah praise the
[9:37] Lord so amen we are not building here
[9:40] our lives on Earthly things we are
[9:42] building our thoughts on Heavenly things
[9:43] amen can you say Amen to that amen so
[9:47] what I'm trying to tell the ministry is
[9:49] designed to bring you to present tense
[9:53] now if you're reading in between the
[9:54] lines you'll know that he's saying a lot
[9:57] am
[10:01] the ministry is designed to bring you to
[10:02] present tense what the Holy Ghost is
[10:04] doing
[10:06] now I can't keep you locked in on a day
[10:08] gone by yes the logos has expressed
[10:11] himself through a
[10:13] Ministry the fullness of God was
[10:15] expressed we know that his back turned
[10:17] to the tent amen he was able to discern
[10:20] the people's heart but he says all of
[10:22] that was for a
[10:24] sign and he says the angel of God is on
[10:27] earth now fixing everything getting
[10:30] things ready for the coming of the
[10:33] Lord amen praise the Lord people still
[10:37] want to come with messages like you know
[10:39] if we're preaching evangelism it's fine
[10:41] I don't mind it but when you're
[10:42] preaching to a church come how can I
[10:45] preach you come out of all my people
[10:47] it's like me going to Egypt and say come
[10:50] out you have already come out yes what
[10:53] we need to do is reposition your soul
[10:56] amen amen people have the word but they
[10:58] don't know what what to do with the word
[11:01] it's like Eve in the Garden of Eden she
[11:03] had the word she knew the word she
[11:05] quoted back the word but she didn't know
[11:08] what to do with the word why she left
[11:10] the guide she left the teacher Adam was
[11:13] a guide amen instead of going back to a
[11:15] guide and a teacher she went onto the
[11:18] grounds of reasoning and she tried to
[11:20] handle the word amen that's why a woman
[11:22] should not handle the word amen your
[11:25] covering is your husband amen your
[11:27] covering is the holy spirit amen
[11:29] Hallelujah
[11:31] hallu so we find here that the Lord is
[11:34] putting a tree a cherub with a flaming
[11:36] sword to guide the way back to the tree
[11:38] of life amen so we are focused on that
[11:40] image now we need to get to Revelation
[11:42] chapter 5 amen praise the Lord
[11:48] amen I am trying to define the image for
[11:51] you that God wanted you to be in because
[11:54] if you're following the messages the
[11:56] prophet is telling you in that state
[11:58] when he said let us
[12:01] let us make man in our own image God had
[12:04] already
[12:05] condescended he had come from Spirit and
[12:08] he said out of the Spirit came the logos
[12:10] he says the logos is called the Son of
[12:12] God the logos is called the word amen
[12:15] and we know what that word body is it
[12:18] has a name and that name is MDC and he
[12:21] says it was in this form that God was in
[12:24] that he spoke and said let there be and
[12:26] it was in this form that he says let us
[12:29] make man in our own
[12:32] image I'm trying to define the image for
[12:34] you so that it'll be clearly identified
[12:37] what you need to become in this day am
[12:40] amen Revelation chapter 5 amen praise
[12:44] the Lord now we showed you where the the
[12:47] book is taken away the inheritance is
[12:49] taken away at the four right and how a
[12:52] flaming sword was put back there amen
[12:54] hallelujah now in Revelation 5 when the
[12:57] book is restored Jesus Jesus now comes
[13:00] to take the
[13:02] book let's see what they say now amen
[13:06] let's read from verse
[13:08] seven and he came and took the book out
[13:11] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[13:14] the
[13:14] throne
[13:16] amen and when he had taken the book The
[13:19] Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders
[13:22] fell down before the lamb having every
[13:25] one of them Harps and golden vials full
[13:27] of oders which which are the prayers of
[13:30] the Saints amen praise the
[13:33] Lord now the last time you remember we
[13:36] defined the 24 Elders the prophet
[13:38] clearly states who those 24 Elders are
[13:41] amen amen hallelujah and and you know
[13:44] now why John is going to be singing and
[13:46] worshiping because part of those 24
[13:48] Elders is John there amen
[13:52] yes so John is seeing John but there's a
[13:55] Chasm there that he can't connect back
[13:58] with that body yes John is seated there
[14:01] as part of the
[14:02] elders and here is John watching the
[14:04] scene
[14:05] unfold and he's watching the lamb come
[14:08] and take the book and that's why brother
[14:09] Brandon in the message says John sees
[14:12] John but he can't connect with John so
[14:14] he starts to cry he starts to weep and
[14:18] brother Bram says that now that there's
[14:20] a there's a voice saying behold the lon
[14:23] of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and
[14:25] he says in the bridge message he comes
[14:27] out looking for his Queen
[14:30] he sees his Queen weeping John is a type
[14:33] of the Bride amen and this husband want
[14:36] to stand to see his bride weeping so he
[14:38] leaves the sanctuary coming out to see
[14:41] what is the matter why is my bride
[14:43] weeping amen thank
[14:46] you when he comes out he finds John
[14:48] wants to be connected
[14:51] back so he starts amen he takes the book
[14:55] from the right hand right hand signifies
[14:57] Authority right hand it signifies power
[15:01] amen he takes it out of the right hand
[15:03] of the one seated on the throne now it
[15:05] is not the Trinity being defined here it
[15:08] is the same God that is changing form
[15:11] the book is not changing hands but the
[15:13] one that is has the book is changing
[15:15] forms amen amen praise the Lord you
[15:17] understand that amen hallelujah so here
[15:20] he says and they sign a new song saying
[15:24] Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to
[15:26] open the seals thereof for thou are
[15:29] slain and has redeemed us to our God now
[15:32] if you understand what redeemed us to
[15:34] our god means it means that everything
[15:36] that was
[15:37] lost to make that statement you have
[15:41] redeemed us to our god means it is
[15:45] finished amen amen God bless you I see
[15:47] brother Samuel also visiting this
[15:48] morning amen praise the Lord amen he has
[15:52] redeemed us back to our god redeem man
[15:55] means you must be brought back to your
[15:57] original condition amen redeemed means
[16:00] you must be the God man on the earth oh
[16:03] yes Hallelujah you say I can't I can't
[16:06] express that the lust wants to find
[16:08] expression through your body the holy
[16:10] thing that you should be short off in
[16:12] this hour this time and this season is
[16:15] the new body but in every other
[16:17] potential you ought to be in that image
[16:19] and likeness come on Church the message
[16:21] of the hour has come to do this for us
[16:24] we need to quit our
[16:26] nonsense amen hallelujah we can't leave
[16:29] the word not to be manifested it must be
[16:32] manifested in you and I now is not the
[16:34] time to have a crisis of Faith amen
[16:37] hallelujah hallelujah people are having
[16:40] crisis of Faith amen people are
[16:42] stumbling around amen the glare the
[16:45] glare of the Babylonian system he's
[16:47] proving too much for some people help us
[16:52] Lord but let the glory of the Gospel
[16:54] come in this morning amen say Lord bro
[16:58] on Me Lord Jesus I don't want to be
[17:00] influenced by the things of this world
[17:02] you say oh I I strug some of us are
[17:04] struggling in our faith amen and and the
[17:07] spirit of God is picking up that up this
[17:09] morning that some people are struggling
[17:10] in their faith they are finding moments
[17:12] of weaknesses in their lives and they
[17:14] are thinking that is the
[17:16] End Amen don't judge yourself by your
[17:19] present condition brother Bram says a
[17:21] son and daughter of God picks themselves
[17:23] up and runs back to the altar runs back
[17:26] to the blood runs back Amen to the of
[17:29] the Altar and says Lord forgive me just
[17:32] once more that's a sign of a son and
[17:34] daughter of God not to lay in your
[17:36] Fallen condition we find people giving
[17:39] expression to rism you say how do I give
[17:42] amen when you paint your face when you
[17:44] put on makeup when you put on a pants
[17:46] when you cut your hair when you act like
[17:48] the world you are giving expression of a
[17:51] Babylonian system you are giving
[17:53] expression to a jezebel
[17:57] system amen people are more afraid of
[17:59] the image of the Beast than of God yes
[18:03] they're more afraid they get terrified
[18:05] when they hear about the mark of the
[18:06] beast but when you tell them the Holy
[18:07] Ghost is here right now they are not
[18:09] moved neither are they concerned about
[18:11] his presence the presence of God is
[18:13] going unrecognized amen the bride on is
[18:15] on the Earth right now amen with the
[18:17] Judgment of God because when she speaks
[18:19] the word of God it his judgment yes yes
[18:22] but people are more scared I'm going to
[18:24] buy or sell yes amen
[18:27] yes don't don't be alive God will not be
[18:30] defeated amen if they are creating an
[18:32] image of the Beast God is making another
[18:34] body in His image it's a form's word
[18:37] image amen an image that will defeat
[18:39] Satan and his armies an image that will
[18:41] defeat the image of the Beast God will
[18:44] not be defeated you are the powerful
[18:46] Army that he's raising up in this
[18:48] hour amen amen the image of the Beast
[18:51] should be like a little mouse to you
[18:53] you're a mighty Army you're a powerful
[18:55] Army you're an invincible Army
[18:59] hallelujah oh praise the Lord praise the
[19:01] Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord amen
[19:04] so redeemed amen when you hear that word
[19:06] redeemed know that you are fully
[19:08] restored in this hour amen you've got to
[19:10] allow the word to have expression amen
[19:13] yes oh hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[19:16] praise the Lord I got to finish this
[19:18] thought amen because this is amen coming
[19:20] strong out don't have crisis of
[19:23] Faith amen people think you know you can
[19:27] be in the very presence of God and still
[19:29] have a crisis of Faith you can be in the
[19:31] service and still have a crisis of
[19:33] Faith amen
[19:36] hallelujah you say what do you mean here
[19:40] was Peter how close do you need to be
[19:42] Jesus to be to Jesus to know or to have
[19:46] perfect
[19:47] Faith because let me tell you you can be
[19:49] in his very own presence and still have
[19:51] a crisis of
[19:52] Faith yes Peter was there they saw Jesus
[19:56] coming on the water he said Lord is it
[19:58] you
[20:00] the presence came near the presence was
[20:02] right next to him he walked on water but
[20:06] then Peter had a crisis of Faith yes yes
[20:09] so being in his literal presence doesn't
[20:11] guarantee you that your faith is going
[20:13] to remain perfect you got to keep your
[20:15] eyes fixed on Jesus amen the Bible says
[20:18] that Peter looked at the waves he looked
[20:20] at his surrounding he looked at his
[20:22] sickness he looked at his circumstance
[20:24] he got his eyes off of Jesus Amen
[20:28] amen and he had a crisis of Faith yes
[20:33] people stumbling around amen can't keep
[20:35] the standard of the word amen that's the
[20:37] problem you are trying to keep the
[20:39] standard of the word when you're

[26:07] we shall come back to reign as kings and
[26:09] Priests on the
[26:11] earth thank you Lord praise the
[26:17] Lord now there must come a time when the
[26:20] angel if he wants us now and he's got
[26:22] the book right the book is the tree of
[26:24] life if I put it that way the way back
[26:27] to the tree of of life then he must come
[26:30] again to take away that flaming sword to
[26:33] allow John to get back to the Tree of
[26:36] Life the tree of life was guarded by an
[26:39] Angel a cherubim is an angel so there
[26:42] must be a point in scripture where the
[26:44] angel allows John Beth access to the
[26:46] Tree of Life am amen I know you're very
[26:49] smart you already know where we're in
[26:51] Revelation 10 amen that's our scripture
[26:54] we can only preach out of our position
[26:57] we can only preach out of our scripture
[26:59] brother Bram never went past the seventh
[27:01] verse because it was not for his time
[27:05] there is a group of people who can
[27:06] Define revelation 108-111 the only one
[27:09] that can give expression to Revelation
[27:11] 10:11 is you and I yes
[27:14] hallelujah praise the Lord amen so let's
[27:17] read Revelation
[27:18] 10 from verse 8 so we find here you know
[27:22] verse 7 says in the days of the voice of
[27:24] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[27:26] sound the mystery of God should be
[27:28] finished as he had declared to his
[27:30] servants the
[27:32] prophets right and now very important
[27:35] now if you don't meditate on anything I
[27:37] need you to meditate on these scriptures
[27:39] amen meditate on Revelation 10:8
[27:42] to11 and say Lord open it up to me what
[27:46] I need to do because this is now going
[27:47] to bring you back to the image that was
[27:50] lost and the voice which I heard from
[27:53] Heaven said unto me again remember this
[27:55] is the second time he hears the voice
[27:57] the first first time he hears the voice
[27:59] he's told not to
[28:00] write what the Thunder said this is the
[28:04] second time he hears the
[28:06] voice and the voice which I heard from
[28:08] heav spake unto me again and said go and
[28:11] take the little book which is open in
[28:13] the hand of the Angel which standed upon
[28:17] the sea and upon the
[28:19] [Music]
[28:21] earth now you may be asking why didn't
[28:24] the angel come to where John is and give
[28:26] him the book there is a part required
[28:30] for you to
[28:32] do the angel is positioned strategically
[28:36] one foot on land one foot on sea yes
[28:40] amen why if you want to find out why you
[28:42] need to read Revelation 133 because
[28:45] there's a beast rising out of the land
[28:46] there's a beast rising out of the sea so
[28:49] he's there to suppress those two Powers
[28:51] because he's bride is on the earth amen
[28:54] why do you think that now they have
[28:56] formed everything do you know they've
[28:57] signed the final Treaty of world
[28:59] religions already signed two years ago
[29:02] yes it is now gone into implementation
[29:05] or can I say gone into expression form
[29:08] right the pope is not going around now
[29:10] trying to make people sign that
[29:12] agreement you go and search it out the
[29:14] final treaty the final uh petition for
[29:17] world religions it was already
[29:20] signed
[29:21] okay so why can't they make anyway in
[29:25] what they are planning to do what is
[29:27] holding them down down what is stopping
[29:30] them why can't amen America Flex its
[29:34] muscle and and do what they want to do
[29:36] why can't Russia who part of Prophecy do
[29:38] what they want to do something is
[29:41] holding back the winds yes amen somebody
[29:44] stopping them there's an angel stopping
[29:47] amen hold back the winds amen that's for
[29:50] the Jews but for the prde Revelation 10
[29:53] is that scripture way suppressing those
[29:55] true Powers they're trying to raise
[29:57] their head but the foot is bringing them
[29:59] down
[30:02] amen so you find those two Powers can't
[30:04] make a move the Catholic church in the
[30:07] USA world religions and the USA image
[30:11] unto the Beast they're trying to find a
[30:13] way but Angel is holding them down so
[30:16] he's telling you get to the angel
[30:18] connect with the angel amen go and take
[30:22] the book now the same the angel came to
[30:27] Mary now we are another Mary right
[30:30] brother brandham says when the word was
[30:33] going to be formed in Mary he said
[30:35] that's when the persecution
[30:37] started when the word image was going to
[30:39] be in put into Mary the persecution
[30:42] started and what did she have to do
[30:45] firstly she had to respond to the
[30:47] Angel's
[30:50] instruction Mary didn't have to give
[30:52] Authority the last time we showed you
[30:54] who has legal Authority on the earth God
[30:57] can't use your body without you giving
[30:59] him permission he tells you the Holy
[31:01] Ghost is a gentleman he will not budge
[31:04] into your
[31:05] life Mary didn't find herself pregnant
[31:08] and the angel coming to explain to her
[31:10] how you got
[31:13] pregnant that's right he comes to her
[31:16] first to tell her that I am Shining
[31:19] Light upon Isaiah 9 and I want to
[31:21] express a n through your
[31:26] body and then she he says be it unto me
[31:29] according to Thy
[31:31] word so she allows now the logos to find
[31:35] expression through her body and we know
[31:37] that she brings forth amen the fullness
[31:40] of the word because this is the logos
[31:42] now condescending into flesh if you read
[31:44] John chapter 1 you'll see in the
[31:46] beginning was the word that word is the
[31:48] logos and the logos was with God and the
[31:52] logos was God Amen and then it goes down
[31:55] and it tells you and the logos the word
[31:57] became
[31:59] flesh that is why brother Bram says
[32:01] after Jesus came you don't see mesic
[32:03] anymore because Jesus is now both King
[32:06] and high priest if you really want to
[32:08] know mzc is the theophonic body of Jesus
[32:14] Christ that's the body he entered into
[32:17] brother brandom says he went back into
[32:19] the form he was before he came on the
[32:21] earth when he went to preach the souls
[32:22] that are in prison that is why Abraham
[32:25] could identify him that is why Moses
[32:27] could identify him that is why Ezekiel
[32:29] could identify him he went back into the
[32:32] form that's why brother Bram is
[32:34] dramatizing it and saying Ezekiel said
[32:36] he's a wheel within a wheel amen
[32:38] hallelujah Abraham is saying that's the
[32:40] one that came to me when I was sitting
[32:42] under that oak
[32:44] tree he returned back to the form before
[32:47] he became Jesus
[32:49] Christ and he went in that body to
[32:51] preach amen because you to go into that
[32:55] realm you need a word body you need need
[32:57] a theophonic body to go amen into the
[33:00] sixth to Paradise to entty out paradise
[33:03] you need a body to get to that Fifth
[33:05] Dimension to preach to souls that are in
[33:08] prison amen then when he rose up again
[33:11] on the third
[33:12] day amen he rose up a glorified body
[33:16] meaning there could be no separation
[33:18] between the the resurrected body of the
[33:20] Lord Jesus Christ and mic the two bodies
[33:24] had to become one to become a glorified
[33:27] body you and I will go through that same
[33:29] process amen the flesh body shall be
[33:31] changed and your theophonic body which
[33:33] is in the sixth Dimension shall come
[33:35] down connect with this body and you
[33:37] shall become a glorified body that is
[33:39] revelation right there give God an an of
[33:42] Praise
[33:44] amen amen so we are looking for the
[33:47] expression of that body amen hallelujah
[33:50] we are looking Amen to enter our
[33:52] glorified body so we find here he says
[33:54] go so what I was trying to tell you Mary
[33:57] had to give him permission Mary had a
[33:59] work to do on her part she had to speak
[34:01] a word she had to do something because
[34:04] what is true
[34:05] believing believing doesn't mean the
[34:07] prophet says hey I'm preaching in the
[34:09] street corner and a drunk man says yes I
[34:11] believe he said that's not true
[34:13] believing believing must result in a
[34:16] corresponding action amen you must
[34:19] repent you must change so if you truly
[34:22] believe the word what I'm trying to say
[34:24] the word must have an effect on you and
[34:26] you must have a correspond responding
[34:28] action so Mary said be it unto me
[34:32] according to Thy word I'm trying to tie
[34:33] it in with this when the angel said go
[34:35] take when the voice said go take the
[34:37] book from the end of the Angel the bride
[34:39] didn't need to
[34:40] move the bride didn't have to respond to
[34:43] that call and I think for many years she
[34:45] didn't respond to the
[34:48] call because why if I keep preaching to
[34:51] you it was all done by the prophetic
[34:55] Ministry all you need to do is believe
[34:57] the message of the hour that God sent a
[34:59] prophet there's no part for you to play
[35:02] it was all done there then you won't
[35:05] move I can keep you locked up in history
[35:09] yes oh yes that's why I say I need to
[35:11] bring you to present tense amen amen I
[35:15] can keep you locked up in history I can
[35:17] keep preaching why God sent a prophet I
[35:20] can keep preaching come out of all my
[35:22] people I can keep preaching don't wear
[35:24] pants don't wear makeup amen don't cut
[35:26] your hair I can keep preaching that and
[35:28] you'll die with them yeah amen sir oh
[35:33] yes you say ah how you say that well
[35:36] I'll show you in the Bible the Pharisees
[35:38] the scribes and everyone came and said
[35:40] we have Moses as our Prophet now you get
[35:42] puffed shirts in the mess we have
[35:44] brandom as our Prophet do you see how
[35:47] God used him mightily but when I go and
[35:49] play his tapes now he's telling me there
[35:52] shall come forth a
[35:53] people a bride will be in his very own
[35:56] image and likeness he says as she nears
[35:58] The Headstone she will be in his very
[36:00] own image and likeness in order to be
[36:02] United with him he says amen hallelujah
[36:05] she amen his life of his life Spirit of
[36:09] his Spirit word of his word amen in fact
[36:12] he says she is him amen now I'm reading
[36:15] all of that but you trying to tell me
[36:18] don't look here look
[36:19] there look there
[36:22] am but I want to look here
[36:26] hallelujah now this needs to be
[36:28] disobedient to this
[36:31] prees when they say don't take of this
[36:34] reel if you get what I
[36:37] mean now they are trying to keep you
[36:39] from the Tree of Life right yes yes now
[36:44] you need to be obedient to the spirit
[36:46] who says go take the book and eat the
[36:49] book everything that Jesus Christ work
[36:51] for go become it yes come into my image
[36:55] amen come into my likeness you know
[36:57] brother br God won't marry anyone that's
[36:58] not of his own image character nature
[37:00] likeness that's what this word is going
[37:02] to do now watch what happens when John
[37:05] goes to take the book now John responds
[37:07] you the bride responds you're going to
[37:09] take the book from the hand of the
[37:12] Angel okay amen it says here and I went
[37:16] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[37:19] the little
[37:20] [Music]
[37:21] book that sounds like a voice of
[37:24] authority yes yes that sounds like like
[37:27] I now recognize that I'm the legal owner
[37:29] of this book amen amen this book belongs
[37:33] to the Earth to a man yes give me the
[37:37] little book
[37:41] amen and he said take it eat it up and
[37:45] it shall make thy belly bitter and it
[37:47] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[37:51] amen hallelujah when the word when you
[37:53] take in the word amen you become the
[37:55] word amen because the word is spirit and
[37:58] it is life amen you know Satan is
[38:00] totally confused how God is using the
[38:03] foolishness of preaching the gospel to
[38:05] bring you back into his word image he
[38:07] can't understand why you love to go to
[38:10] church he can't understand that there's
[38:12] something being done on the inward part
[38:14] of you when you are hearing the word
[38:16] that faith is being created amen
[38:19] hallelujah I have a faith generator
[38:22] which is making me a faith billionaire
[38:24] which is the hearing of the word the
[38:27] hearing of the word generates Faith
[38:28] within the believer and this is no
[38:30] ordinary faith we are moving the church
[38:32] from normal Faith to perfect Faith amen
[38:35] from normal love to agap love we are
[38:37] repositioning the church yes Lord oh
[38:41] thank you taking you from natural to
[38:43] Supernatural yes he says amen when you
[38:46] receive the new birth amen you become a
[38:48] two-fold being one of the earth and a
[38:52] spirit being amen of God praise the Lord
[38:55] so Satan can't understand what's
[38:57] happening it's a mystery to him amen
[38:59] that you are being formed into the word
[39:01] image into priest and Kings by you
[39:03] hearing the word amen he thinks that
[39:06] you're coming in one way and you're
[39:07] going in the same way amen he doesn't
[39:10] know that inside there's a change
[39:12] happening oh yes amen hallelujah there's
[39:15] a change happening amen so what is
[39:18] happening amen that food that word that
[39:21] John eats breaks down into his body goes
[39:25] into the bloodstream and becomes is life
[39:29] yes what am I saying the word is our
[39:32] life the word is our joy the word is Our
[39:35] Truth the word is our absolute we live
[39:38] by the word we breathe by the word amen
[39:41] the word is our
[39:42] life take the whole world but give me
[39:45] the word amen praise the Lord amen
[39:49] hallelujah amen
[39:52] amen it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[39:54] honey and I took the book out of the
[39:56] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[39:59] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[40:01] had eaten it my belly was
[40:02] [Music]
[40:04] bitter right and he said unto me thou
[40:07] must prophesy again before many peoples
[40:09] Nations tongues Kings now last time I
[40:12] was showing you and the prophet showing
[40:14] you how the Holy Spirit comes for your
[40:16] birth and he comes for your adoption
[40:19] amen and the only ones that can give
[40:21] definition to the scripture is the Bride
[40:23] of Jesus Christ this is the bride's
[40:26] adoption ceremony
[40:28] because at the adoption ceremony we
[40:30] showed you in Matthew 17 how God adds
[40:33] words to his first words at Ma Matthew 3
[40:36] in Matthew 3 says this is my beloved Son
[40:39] and he stops in whom I'm pleased to
[40:42] dwell in in Matthew chapter 17 he says
[40:44] those same words but he adds his words
[40:47] hear he him that's the adoption ceremony
[40:51] so you can see the Spirit came at the
[40:53] birth the baptism of Jesus and he came
[40:55] at the adoption ceremony
[40:57] and at the adoption ceremony he's saying

[41:46] want to bring in Kings and Priests and
[41:48] then we can see what the prophet is
[41:49] saying just now to nail it down amen
[41:53] what we've been saying amen hallelujah
[41:55] you love the word amen
[41:57] there's another uh document called Kings
[41:59] and Priests if we can put that up amen
[42:05] hallelujah it says God's intention for
[42:07] his creation man is to express his words
[42:11] in Genesis Adam was given the word to

[43:09] life life was the word of God death was
[43:12] anything that wasn't the word of God she
[43:14] allowed one word to be changed and right
[43:16] then Satan had her right but you can
[43:19] make Satan powerless before you watch
[43:21] how he says you can make him powerless
[43:22] now he says then when you can hit Satan
[43:25] with the scripture he's just as as
[43:27] powerless as he can
[43:28] be that is why you need to take the word
[43:31] into the greatest battle ever

[55:35] mesic I'll just give you the paragraph
[55:37] and that going to be much easier for us
[55:39] to find it amen praise the
[55:43] Lord this is now what I'm saying we are
[55:45] moving the Revelation to an experience
[55:48] we're going to allow the word to have a
[55:50] full effect on us a king has a domain
[55:54] and he establishes laws and decrees
[55:55] that's what you must do in your life

[56:14] [Music]
[56:19] amen let's go to
[56:23] uh I'm just trying to find the main
[56:25] quotes amen praise the Lord there's so
[56:27] much in this message who this mesic how
[56:30] many of you know you got homework to do
[56:32] you got to now go and read or listen to
[56:34] who is this mzd because mzc is your
[56:37] image priest and King amen
[56:42] hallelujah praise the
[56:44] Lord let's read from paragraph
[56:47] [Music]
[56:50] uh
[56:54] 67 now we see
[56:56] the attribute sons of his Spirit have
[57:00] not yet entered into the word form body
[57:02] a theophany this body is subject to the
[57:05] word and Earnest waiting for the earnest
[57:08] now the difference between him and you
[57:10] you see he was in the beginning the word
[57:12] and in morphe body he came in and lived
[57:15] in that in the person of mzd then later
[57:18] we never heard no more of mzd because he
[57:20] became Jesus Christ mzc was the priest
[57:23] but he became Jesus Christ now you pass
[57:27] that because in that form he knowed all
[57:30] things so you see why you need your
[57:32] theopen body in that form you will know
[57:34] all
[57:35] things and you never have been able to
[57:37] know that yet you came like Adam like me
[57:40] you came from the attribute to the flesh
[57:42] to be tempted now hear this church
[57:45] you're going through trials in your life
[57:46] you don't know why these things
[57:47] happening to you it's to mold you and
[57:49] shape you you came here to be tempted
[57:52] when this life is finished here right we
[57:55] have one waiting
[57:57] that's where we go but that is the
[58:01] word right let's go to the next
[58:03] paragraph
[58:04] 69 you will never become the word unless
[58:07] you were thought at the beginning that
[58:08] proves predestination right in order to
[58:12] stand Temptation you had to bypass the
[58:14] the theophany you had to become down
[58:16] here in flesh to be tempted by sin and
[58:19] then if you
[58:20] stand all the father had given me will
[58:22] come to me and I'll raise them at the
[58:24] last days right
[58:27] amen paragraph
[58:29] 70 you bypass your theophany and become
[58:32] flesh man to be tempted if this Earth so
[58:35] he repeats that when this body receives
[58:38] the spirit of God The Immortal Life
[58:40] inside of you throws this body in
[58:42] subjection to God
[58:46] right paragraph 7 73 and then when you
[58:50] become subject to that Spirit it throws
[58:53] your whole being subject to that spirit
[58:55] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[58:58] but the seed word made
[59:00] manifest or quickened Made Alive
[59:06] okay and paragraph 80 says here we are
[59:09] formed into the word image to be
[59:12] partaker of the word feed on the word by
[59:16] being predestinated since the beginning
[59:18] so how are you formed into the image by
[59:20] being a partaker of the word feed on the
[59:23] word hallelujah praise the Lord amen
[59:27] amen
[59:31] 88 88 says after you recognize the very
[59:36] word of God was Eagle food then you left
[59:38] the other thing you have then been
[59:40] formed into the living image of the
[59:43] Living God you heard from your
[59:46] theophany see amen after just before
[59:49] this he taking the eagle and the chicken
[59:51] story and he's saying now when you heard
