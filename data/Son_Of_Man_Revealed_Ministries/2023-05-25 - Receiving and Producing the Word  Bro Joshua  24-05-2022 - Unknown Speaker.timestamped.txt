[3:38] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[3:49] I know that
[3:51] you all come from how tiring days at
[3:54] work and
[3:55] whatever things we're busy with but
[3:58] we all know that we are needful of him
[4:01] amen
[4:02] and we all are facing a time where you
[4:05] go into your work environment to school
[4:07] wherever you may be whatever environment
[4:09] you may face
[4:11] the situation is tense yes
[4:15] in the natural
[4:16] the situation is tense to the next to
[4:19] the normal man amen
[4:22] because
[4:24] everything he's looking at around the
[4:27] world is failing he's looking at a
[4:30] failed political system yes he's looking
[4:32] at a failed economical system he's
[4:35] looking at a fair religious system
[4:38] so men don't know where to turn to yeah
[4:43] yeah and they don't know where to seek
[4:45] the answers from because if you have
[4:48] missed the key to the age
[4:51] if you have missed the prophet of the
[4:52] age email me
[4:55] then no religion
[4:57] no denomination no Organization no
[5:00] politician no world leader is going to
[5:03] have the answer for the current
[5:05] situation the world is facing amen but
[5:08] we thank God that the people upon the
[5:11] Earth
[5:12] a people that was chosen to be born in a
[5:16] certain season amen
[5:17] amen the people that had to be
[5:19] reproduced upon the Earth in this age
[5:22] amen
[5:23] and they are to have
[5:27] the gene of God in them
[5:29] and they have to have a certain makeup
[5:31] for this age amen
[5:33] and yet to be anointed for this Aid amen
[5:36] yes because they are going to carry a
[5:38] special word
[5:40] so it's not to any type of people it's
[5:42] for a special class of people amen amen
[5:45] we used to go around in the early time
[5:47] when you first received this word
[5:49] thinking that we could save everybody
[5:52] with this message but it was for a
[5:54] special class of people amen amen even
[5:59] before the foundation of the world
[6:00] before they were formed in a mother's
[6:02] womb they had to be called that special
[6:04] class of yes amen amen and this word
[6:08] come to show us in the back part of
[6:10] God's mind that we were already there
[6:12] amen and therefore when you see that
[6:15] Revelation thank you Lord nothing can
[6:17] stand in your way yes thank you Lord in
[6:21] respect of making you doubt this message
[6:22] yes nothing can make you reason with
[6:25] this word
[6:26] no no scientific theory
[6:30] or no no intelligence of man can make
[6:33] you now
[6:35] take this word and not understand it
[6:39] you understand what I'm talking about
[6:41] because we're living in an age where
[6:42] people are so engrossed with
[6:45] intelligence yes with intelligence of
[6:48] mankind because as Daniel said knowledge
[6:50] shall increase in the library amen a man
[6:53] has become so intellectual they'll be
[6:55] able to twist the Bible to you and they
[6:57] will show you the Bible and they will
[6:59] take you to the history of the Bible
[7:00] they'll take you to their call
[7:02] archeology of the Bible
[7:04] and they will show you and they will
[7:07] misinterpret things or to make you
[7:09] understand things from the intellectual
[7:11] point of view
[7:12] and make you misbelieve misbelieve God's
[7:15] word
[7:16] but if you have
[7:19] receive this by faith
[7:22] then you will see how inferior mankind
[7:25] is
[7:27] when you receive the wisdom of God is
[7:29] superior to the wisdom of man
[7:31] you'll see how inferior the intellectual
[7:33] man is
[7:36] because you are seeing things yeah
[7:40] amen yes
[7:42] yes that he'll never be able to see it
[7:45] amen you've got your Bibles returned to
[7:46] the Book of Luke
[7:49] chapter 1 verse 26.
[7:52] amen
[7:53] let's see where it all starts the story
[7:55] of Jesus
[8:04] and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel
[8:06] was sent from God unto a city of Galilee
[8:09] named Nazareth
[8:11] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[8:14] was Joseph of the House of David
[8:18] so ready message Believers you're
[8:20] reading this you already can see
[8:22] genology you know where David's coming
[8:24] from you know all the types right
[8:26] and the virgin's name was Mary and the
[8:29] angel came in unto her and said ill Thou
[8:32] Art Ali favored
[8:34] amen amen
[8:37] so she wasn't just any ordinary person
[8:39] amen
[8:41] highly favored she was already
[8:42] predestinated for that position
[8:45] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[8:47] among women
[8:49] amen and the people here that are
[8:51] blessed amongst women
[8:54] and when she saw him
[8:56] she was troubled at his saying and cast
[8:58] in a mind what manner of salutation this
[9:02] should be because he thought it'd be
[9:04] taking it to that you are selected you
[9:06] are a special class
[9:08] you're not just any unordinary person
[9:09] yes this is not a normal salutation
[9:12] this is taking a basically take you to
[9:15] predestination that he was predestinated
[9:16] for this purpose yes you must cut out
[9:19] for this purpose and you are stepping
[9:21] now out of the scriptures amen amen
[9:25] because everything must go back to the
[9:26] word amen
[9:29] and the angels said unto her fear not
[9:34] fear not Mary for thou as found favor
[9:37] with God
[9:39] and behold thou shall conceive in thy
[9:42] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[9:46] call his name Jesus
[9:48] and he shall be great and shall be
[9:50] called the son of the highest and the
[9:52] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[9:55] of his father David and he shall reign
[9:57] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[9:59] his kingdom there shall be no end then
[10:02] said Mary unto the angel how shall this
[10:04] thing this be seeing I know not a man he
[10:07] has the supernatural love and the angel
[10:10] answered and said unto her the Holy
[10:12] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[10:15] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[10:19] therefore also that Holy thing which
[10:22] shall be born of thee shall be called
[10:24] The Son of God so here she is firstly
[10:27] she is walking out of the scriptures now
[10:29] so there was a promise in the scripture
[10:31] back in Isaiah yes yes then there's a
[10:34] word to her amen amen
[10:37] so so here's the word given to her now
[10:39] she received this word and behold thy
[10:41] cousin Elizabeth would shall also
[10:43] conceive a son in her old age and this
[10:46] is the sixth month with her who was
[10:48] called Baron for with God nothing shall
[10:51] be impossible and Mary said behold the
[10:54] handmaid of the Lord be unto me
[10:57] according to Thy word and the angel
[10:59] departed from her
[11:01] so she she's a person that's coming out
[11:03] of the scripture because the scripture
[11:04] spoke about her the angel comes to her
[11:06] amen
[11:08] she receives a promise she receives the
[11:10] word
[11:12] the angel gives a tells her what's
[11:14] happening and she receives this word
[11:15] amen
[11:17] amen and the Bible says the angel
[11:19] departed from a
[11:21] right
[11:22] let's turn to Luke 18 1.
[11:30] and he spake a parable unto them to this
[11:32] end that men always that men
[11:36] ought always to pray
[11:38] and not to things so in this hour when
[11:43] the sphere and anxiety upon the Earth
[11:45] may not always
[11:47] pray and not to things
[11:50] saying there was in a city a judge which
[11:53] feared not God near regard neither
[11:56] regarded man and there was a widow in
[11:58] that City and she came unto him saying
[12:00] event me of mine adversary and he would
[12:03] not for a while but afterward he said
[12:05] within himself though I fear not God no
[12:08] regard man yet because this Widow
[12:11] trouble at me I will Avenger lest by a
[12:14] continual coming she weary me and the
[12:16] Lord said hear what the unjust judge
[12:20] said and shall not God avenge his own
[12:23] elect which cry day and night unto him
[12:27] though he be along with them I tell you
[12:30] that he will avenge them speedily
[12:33] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[12:36] shall he find faith on the earth amen
[12:40] amen you may be seated
[12:43] he's not talking about the time
[12:45] when he's gonna send to heaven and when
[12:49] the Holy Ghost comes down on the day of
[12:51] Pentecost
[12:52] no no because you know what's going to
[12:54] happen at that time
[12:56] but he's talking about before he comes
[12:58] again
[12:59] shall he find favor upon the Earth
[13:03] amen amen
[13:06] we're going to speak tonight a time to
[13:09] receive and a time to produce
[13:13] amen there was a time when Mary had to
[13:15] received the promise amen
[13:18] and she said be unto me according to
[13:20] that word in the Holy Ghost overshadowed
[13:23] but there was a time when the promise
[13:26] was manifested
[13:28] amen there was a time where Mary
[13:31] received that word but she's walking
[13:33] around and nine months later there had
[13:35] to be a manifestation of what she
[13:38] receives
[13:39] amen just like the disciples in the
[13:42] upper room Jesus said to them Terry yeah
[13:45] until the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[13:48] so they were tearing there in the upper
[13:50] room
[13:51] they were preaching to his words they
[13:54] had to obey his word amen
[13:56] and they at the Cherry day in the upper
[13:59] room and what happened on the day of
[14:01] Pentecost the promise came
[14:03] amen and the Holy Ghost came and busted
[14:05] the church
[14:07] amen what a great inauguration that must
[14:10] have been amen
[14:13] amen
[14:15] and we know what happened after that
[14:17] when they received the promise then they
[14:19] became that manifested word in that hour
[14:22] amen
[14:24] what it was showing that Jesus Christ is
[14:27] the resurrected savior
[14:30] what was the manifestation at the time
[14:31] that Jesus Christ is not dead
[14:34] he is risen he's still alive amen amen
[14:37] and now he is working amongst his people
[14:40] he's working amongst the apostles he's
[14:42] working amongst the Believers that the
[14:44] Believers that came on this is the start
[14:47] of his church and this is where he's
[14:49] working amongst his church
[14:52] amen
[14:54] and just like if you turn your Bible to
[14:56] Genesis 18 10 and you say it in Genesis
[14:59] 18 10
[15:01] and he said I will certainly return unto
[15:04] thee according to the time of life and
[15:07] lo Sarah the wife shall have a son amen
[15:12] right
[15:14] so here he goes
[15:15] to tell
[15:17] Abraham I'm gonna Return To Thee but in
[15:19] Genesis 17 5 15 the scripture proceeding
[15:23] Genesis 18
[15:26] he says and God said unto Abraham as
[15:28] foreign
[15:33] but Sarah
[15:35] shall be your name amen
[15:37] and I will bless her Sarah means
[15:40] princess right and I will bless her and
[15:43] give thee a son also of her
[15:49] and she shall be a mother of Nations
[15:52] Kingdom people shall be of her
[15:56] so we see that there was a promise
[16:00] to given to Abraham
[16:04] and then before the manifestation of the
[16:07] promise he comes down
[16:09] amen amen before the manifestation he
[16:12] comes down yes
[16:14] and then when he comes down he said I
[16:18] will return to thee according to the
[16:19] time of life and Sarah their wife shall
[16:22] have a son
[16:24] what happens when he comes down
[16:26] there's a body change takes place amen
[16:29] amen
[16:30] when he comes down in the time when he's
[16:32] coming down there's a body chain
[16:34] so there's a promise amen there's a time
[16:36] to receive
[16:37] and there's also a time to produce
[16:42] amen we can just you just can't receive
[16:46] amen you can't just receive the word
[16:48] word yeah
[16:50] yeah but there is a time when you have
[16:52] to become the manifestation of the word
[16:54] amen amen yes amen because those
[16:57] messages come to produce perfect faith
[17:00] amen and perfect faith is recognizing
[17:02] your position in the words amen and how
[17:05] do you recognize your position in the
[17:07] word when you see yourself in the word
[17:11] oh you see and you see the word being
[17:14] interpreted
[17:15] daily in your own life
[17:19] he's not taking a god of History you're
[17:21] not taking another character yes but
[17:23] when you sing that now manifested in
[17:25] your personal life amen amen hallelujah
[17:29] amen
[17:31] so there was a time for us to receive
[17:34] and we said be it unto me according to
[17:37] Thy word amen just like Mary amen yes
[17:40] yes amen he says yeah
[17:42] in this quote
[17:47] he said the first son Adam was the
[17:51] spoken seed word of God Amen
[17:56] here he was given a bride yes to
[17:59] reproduce himself yes
[18:01] that is why the bride was given to him
[18:04] yes amen so you see the the end result
[18:09] of why the bride or the main
[18:11] reason the bride was given to him so
[18:14] Adam could reproduce himself yes
[18:18] amen
[18:20] not to produce a hybrid but to produce
[18:22] himself yes amen and the only way he
[18:25] could reproduce himself
[18:28] if he stayed obedient to what was told
[18:31] to him
[18:34] that
[18:35] he had to speak the word amen amen amen
[18:39] that's right now if Adam spoke the word
[18:42] the bride it was given to him a makeup
[18:46] was in such a way amen that a body was
[18:49] made in such a way when Adam spoke the
[18:51] word a body would conceive yes and
[18:55] reproduce Adam
[18:57] and that
[18:59] when but when she fell
[19:02] she felt by advertisation and she called
[19:04] him to die
[19:06] Amen in other words now he could
[19:09] introduce himself yes the real Adam now
[19:12] he's producing a fallen race because he
[19:16] came by the spoken word yes he would so
[19:18] he couldn't produce what he came under
[19:21] amen amen
[19:23] now he's producing something by
[19:26] hybridization
[19:27] in a way that gordoned ah and just for
[19:30] him to do yes because if he had to
[19:33] produce himself as a spoken word Son of
[19:35] God he had to speak amen
[19:38] amen amen and therefore now
[19:41] God is proving it by his word that there
[19:44] will be amen amen
[19:48] because when Mary comes on the scene in
[19:50] the natural love Mary's day she's a
[19:53] virgin a spouse to Joseph but Joseph
[19:56] didn't touch her she's a virgin
[19:58] amen and the angel comes to her and
[20:00] gives her the word
[20:02] the word is spoken to her but and she
[20:05] receives that spoken word
[20:07] and what happened she conceals of the
[20:09] Holy One
[20:10] amen the body is already there to make
[20:13] it make that up amen
[20:15] to produce of the Holy One and it just
[20:18] like that with the church
[20:21] amen
[20:23] this bride would be a virgin bride amen
[20:26] she will not be touched by any other man
[20:31] but when she receives that word
[20:35] amen when she receives that word she's
[20:38] already got the makeup amen amen she's
[20:42] already got the gene of God in it to
[20:46] reproduce him
[20:48] amen amen she receives the spoken word
[20:51] about her amen
[20:53] I want you to receive it
[20:56] to make up God already created her in
[20:58] such a way God have made a special class
[21:02] of people yes amen that when she
[21:05] receives this word she will reproduce
[21:07] Jesus Christ again
[21:12] but there was a time to receive
[21:16] yes amen there was a season of receiving
[21:20] the spoken word amen there was a receipt
[21:24] there was a season when the word when
[21:26] the mechanics was here amen
[21:29] and the word had to come first
[21:33] but now is a season to produce
[21:38] and the only way you can produce
[21:42] is if you have come into a union with
[21:45] him
[21:46] if there's been no Union
[21:49] amen
[21:50] you cannot produce nothing amen
[21:53] so don't let all these fall churches
[21:55] come and lie to you that Jesus is
[21:57] amongst them
[21:59] the only parasites because the rain is
[22:02] falling for the Justice
[22:04] he's enjoying the rain yeah the rain is
[22:08] falling for you amen you are the ones in
[22:10] Union with him and you are the ones to
[22:13] produce Jesus Christ on the Earth again
[22:16] because you are the one to produce a
[22:19] Christ that is resurrected again amen
[22:21] you are the type you are the people upon
[22:23] the Earth to say Jesus Christ the same
[22:25] yesterday today and forever amen how do
[22:29] you make him the same today he's showing
[22:31] that he's not a dead God that is risen
[22:33] from the dead that is resurrected Jesus
[22:36] that is yet amongst the people and the
[22:39] same only ghost that fell on the day of
[22:41] Pentecost is fell upon his people again
[22:43] amen amen in the works that he did then
[22:46] he must do it again today amen that's
[22:49] right show me what place when the Bible
[22:51] stopped it show me one place when the
[22:53] prophet said it stops yes
[22:56] amen that's right
[22:59] amen amen thank you so there was a bride
[23:02] because this is an obedient bride she
[23:04] loves his word she'll become so much
[23:06] like him she'll be in his very image
[23:09] amen amen and she left thus said the
[23:14] amen Lord amen amen
[23:16] denominations can't produce that because
[23:19] they are more peace for himself yes
[23:22] but this bride would be his mouthpiece
[23:25] amen when she speaks he's gonna speak
[23:27] through her whatever God is whenever
[23:30] people want to say I want to hear the
[23:32] voice of God in this hour he is speaking
[23:34] to the bride amen through a
[23:37] many-membered body amen yes amen thank
[23:41] you Isaiah chapter 35 amen
[23:50] the wilderness
[23:51] and the solitary Place shall be glad for
[23:54] them

[28:43] amen where
[28:46] where else is the world going to see
[28:48] this amen the church world is not going
[28:51] to produce this
[28:52] you know what happened to Saul when he
[28:54] got in a vaccine condition
[28:57] he tried to there was no prophet Samuel
[28:58] was of the scene
[29:01] he went to the urum tamim he wouldn't
[29:03] there was no answer from the eurom time
[29:05] he wouldn't light up for him
[29:07] there was no word for him there was
[29:09] nothing that he could do
[29:10] from God because God departed from him
[29:14] because he was in a back certain
[29:15] condition God wouldn't speak to him amen
[29:19] God used wouldn't use any method that he
[29:21] used to speak to him
[29:22] but he was he knew that he had to hear
[29:24] from God
[29:26] but he was in a vaccine condition just
[29:28] like this world the church was it
[29:30] wouldn't listen they wouldn't come and
[29:31] accept the true word of God what God
[29:33] Said through His prophets yes because
[29:35] Samuel gave the word to Saul and Samuel
[29:37] Saul wouldn't listen yeah if you only
[29:39] obeyed every word that was spoken
[29:41] through Samuel you wouldn't have been in
[29:43] the condition yes
[29:45] but they wouldn't accept His prophets
[29:47] they rejected God's prophets
[29:51] and now God is not going to speak to
[29:52] them so what did Saul do because Saul
[29:54] know he must hear from God oh you must
[29:56] and the only way you can hear from God
[29:58] was through his Prophet mm-hmm
[30:00] so what he did he went to a familiar
[30:03] Spirit yes
[30:05] yes
[30:06] to try and contact Sam here Samuel the
[30:10] prophet
[30:11] so what do you think these people are
[30:13] doing
[30:13] what what Spirits upon them he looks
[30:17] real
[30:18] you said you might say God is amongst
[30:20] them but they are familiar spirits
[30:23] just like this like how you get a
[30:25] prophet and they call it what they was
[30:26] calling it mental telepathy the reason
[30:28] why they call it that because they got
[30:29] all his familiar spirits they got this
[30:31] fortune tellers and all that
[30:33] but this was the real thing how do you
[30:35] check the real thing take it back
[30:37] together yes take it back to the world
[30:39] so if God is working amongst you and the
[30:43] Supernatural is amongst you take it back
[30:45] to the West yes take it back and see
[30:48] which scripture amen but if I come and
[30:51] tell you oh did the blood come here from

[31:02] with it be afraid of the gifts but he
[31:04] said take it back to the word
[31:06] but if it's from the words if you're

[34:28] the way of holiness
[34:31] it comes back to Holiness what the Holy
[34:33] Ghost brought us to
[34:34] the way of holiness
[34:37] if you want to see God working it's the
[34:39] way of
[34:40] holiness
[34:41] holy living consecrated lives amen amen
[34:48] the earlier scripture I read
[34:51] constantly praying always in prayer amen
[34:55] and the way of the road is the middle of
[34:58] the road he's built like this so that

[35:03] both sides keeping the road clean amen
[35:05] amen amen
[35:08] you don't you have puddles standing in
[35:11] the road all the time if it isn't built
[35:13] rights yes the way is the middle of the
[35:16] road amen now on this side when people
[35:19] get converted their mind is set right on
[35:21] Christ
[35:21] and it is just a little scholarly and
[35:24] don't keep under prayer they'll get real
[35:27] cold
[35:28] stiff starchy and indifferent
[35:32] bring the Baptist Doctrine in the
[35:35] message yeah
[35:39] opthyology in the message
[35:42] scholarly
[35:44] try to bring everything in a scholarly
[35:46] in a theological manner yeah
[35:49] try to denominate around an idea a
[35:52] teaching
[35:53] and what happened to become stiff and
[35:55] starchy
[35:56] can't see the move of God amongst them
[35:59] amen amen because why
[36:04] they gone to one side yeah and if they
[36:07] just a little bit nervous if you don't
[36:09] watch they'll get radical and Wild on
[36:13] this side see they go into Sensations
[36:14] and everything
[36:17] now but the real church is a real same
[36:21] gospel right in the middle of the road
[36:24] amen it's not cold and starchy
[36:28] see he's not saying you was
[36:31] you must go and decide oh that's it yes
[36:35] this church is not cold and starchy
[36:39] but neither is it fanaticism
[36:42] because it's got the word
[36:44] amen he's got the word he's just not not
[36:48] any word it's a fresh word amen it's a
[36:52] fresh word all the time by divine
[36:53] revelation amen amen
[36:56] it's a real good old warm gospel
[37:01] heartfelt love of God Amen bring them
[37:04] back old-fashioned altar bring them back
[37:07] old-fashioned consecrated live bring
[37:09] them back old-fashioned fasting in
[37:11] prayer because it never wears out

[37:17] bring down the Holy Ghost amen it will
[37:20] still produce the results yeah
[37:23] yes amen
[37:25] amen heartfelt love of God going right
[37:28] down the middle of the road calling from
[37:30] both side that's right now and are you
[37:33] going to get the church right out of the
[37:36] word the urum tamam amen yes amen she's
[37:40] going to be produced out of the word
[37:42] because she sees herself in the word
[37:44] amen she sees herself as a people that's
[37:48] carrying out the Mandate in this hour
[37:50] Revelation 10 8 to 11 yes she recognized
[37:54] I have a responsibility
[37:56] man as his responsibility is upon me
[38:02] amen amen
[38:06] so you find that there was a time yes
[38:08] there was a time to receive
[38:11] but now is a time to produce amen by the
[38:15] time he said God sent out the prophets
[38:18] God came down
[38:19] and we saw this beautiful things
[38:21] happening
[38:23] God revealed him Vindicated himself with
[38:25] a pillow of Fire
[38:27] Vindicated himself in a supernatural
[38:29] cloud
[38:31] but now you need to be their testimony
[38:34] that God is vindicating himself amongst
[38:36] you and I amen amen
[38:40] they ought to be a people on the Earth
[38:44] who recognize the call for the hour amen
[38:47] amen and recognize that there's been a
[38:49] slackness yes
[38:52] yes in the message world
[38:57] men have been so happy and fascinated
[39:00] with the way God has shown him the word
[39:02] and they went into theology
[39:06] and there's been somewhere into radicals
[39:08] as well yes
[39:11] but there's got to be a group of people
[39:13] that will be in the middle of the road
[39:15] amen will have the revelation of the
[39:17] word
[39:19] we'll have fresh Revelation as a day is
[39:22] getting closer the world is becoming
[39:24] more clearer because that's part of the
[39:26] third pool yes the third pool is the
[39:28] word the opening of the word amen the
[39:30] power of the spoken word
[39:32] the temple must have all the
[39:34] manifestations yes because the temple is
[39:42] that's right amen absolutely amen as the
[39:47] need arises under inspiration there'll
[39:50] be different needs in every home
[39:53] you go to a house
[39:55] you got you might have a baby you might
[39:57] have different children different size
[39:59] uh different age group in amongst your
[40:02] children
[40:03] then you got the mother you got the
[40:04] father
[40:05] not everyone is the same
[40:08] and everyone would eat a different
[40:10] according to their needs a baby will be
[40:12] different from the from the Teenage
[40:14] children the teenage children might eat
[40:15] different the appetite is different from
[40:17] the parents yes
[40:19] it's just like that in the church
[40:21] that's why you're going to have the
[40:22] German in the church
[40:24] amen amen when the world is coming out
[40:26] the different levels of people in the
[40:27] church
[40:34] so sometimes there might be a need for
[40:36] an article
[40:38] there might be a need for going to the
[40:40] person's house using the scripture
[40:43] call the others yeah he's using the
[40:46] scripture
[40:47] then there will be a need under the
[40:49] anointing
[40:50] which you are not controlling now this
[40:52] is when the anointing drops down and
[40:54] you'll be able to speak that word amen
[40:56] amen when that need arises amen amen but
[41:00] those are not needs you want to go those
[41:02] are happening now behind closed doors
[41:05] those are situations going to be
[41:07] happening when the Lord sees foot for
[41:09] you to happen
[41:11] but there's also a time where now your
[41:13] faith if you believe
[41:16] if you ask anything and you believe it
[41:18] you shall receive what you are amen amen
[41:22] so you've got to have this hour and you
[41:25] need to know how to operate and use the
[41:28] word of God but you cannot do that with
[41:31] intellectual thinking right amen then
[41:34] you're not gonna understand the
[41:35] Supernatural and you're going to throw
[41:36] away the supernatural you're going to
[41:38] take the supernatural put it under the
[41:39] carpet because you're happy with your
[41:40] theology but if you've got the Holy
[41:43] Ghost and you are working with the Holy
[41:45] Ghost
[41:46] man I tell you it becomes a nature it
[41:49] becomes normal to you yes to operate in
[41:51] the spirit amen amen amen because when
[41:54] you're walking in the with the spirit of
[41:55] God Amen moving in you then it becomes
[41:58] second nature to you amen and then
[42:00] you're operating in the spirits yes
[42:02] yes amen I'm not talking about history

[54:32] it was at the Durban boys college and
[54:35] this person escaped from the
[54:38] from the world where they keep mental
[54:40] patients
[54:41] at the independent Hospital
[54:43] and you and he claimed he took a letter
[54:45] and he clamped up a ledge balcony
[54:48] and he was standing on the ledge of the
[54:50] balcony
[54:51] and they call us out there
[54:53] because it was
[54:55] Durban boy's eyes they they stay in it
[54:57] it's called The Domain they got a
[54:58] dominant he was the exactly player
[55:01] and he was a big size guy
[55:04] so when he went there
[55:06] as we have to climb up the ladder so he
[55:09] said when I see police I kill
[55:11] that's what he says
[55:13] so all the policemen now they were
[55:15] fighting the claim of this letter
[55:17] so anyway we managed to claim up the
[55:18] ladder because he went to he moved apart
[55:22] and all went as soon as I went up I said
[55:23] hold your peace in the name of Jesus
[55:25] Amen and he just went like this
