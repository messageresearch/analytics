[2:44] to church amen so that's already having
[2:46] the victory amen amen so let's see what
[2:49] the Lord will speak to us tonight
[2:51] amen hallelujah let's just open you know
[2:54] um with our scripture reading for today
[2:57] just want to open to the book of
[2:59] Ephesians
[3:00] chapter 10.
[3:02] 17 first
[3:20] finally my brethren be strong in the
[3:22] Lord and in the power of His might
[3:25] put on the whole armor of God that he
[3:28] may be able to stand against the vows of
[3:30] the devil for we wrestle not against
[3:33] flesh and blood but against
[3:34] principalities against Powers against
[3:38] the rulers of the darkness of the world
[3:40] of this world against spiritual
[3:43] wickedness in high places
[3:46] wherefore take unto yourself the whole
[3:48] armor of God that yea may be able to
[3:51] stand in the evil day amen having done
[3:54] all to stand yes amen
[3:57] stand therefore having your lines good
[3:59] about the truth
[4:01] having the breastplate of righteousness
[4:03] and your feet short with the preparation
[4:05] of the gospel of peace amen Above All
[4:09] Things The Shield of faith
[4:11] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[4:14] the fiery darts of the wicked amen the
[4:17] enemy is trying with all of his fiery
[4:19] dots amen but we have the shield of
[4:21] Faith amen amen and we can stand strong
[4:24] with the shield of faith that no matter
[4:25] what the enemy throws at our same and
[4:28] we'll be able to withstand yes amen amen
[4:30] and take the helmet of salvation the
[4:33] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[4:34] God Amen and that sword is much more
[4:37] sharper in the end times the word of God
[4:39] has been revealed to us in its fullness
[4:41] amen amen
[4:43] amen we also want to turn to Daniel
[4:46] 12th chapter
[4:58] I'm reading directly from the prophet's
[5:00] quotes here so if I miss out of you
[5:03] scriptures just bear with me
[5:05] and at that time Michael
[5:10] stand up the great Trends were standard
[5:12] for the children of thy people
[5:14] and there shall be a time of trouble
[5:16] such as never was since there was a
[5:19] nation even unto that same time and at
[5:23] that time thy people shall be delivered
[5:25] everyone that shall be found written in
[5:28] the book
[5:29] and many of them that sleep in the dust
[5:31] of the Earth shall awake some to
[5:33] everlasting life some to shame and
[5:36] everlasting contempt contentment
[5:39] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[5:43] brightness of the firmament and they
[5:46] that turn away
[5:47] many turn away many to righteousness as
[5:50] the Stars forever and ever but thou or
[5:54] Daniel shut up the book even to the time
[5:56] of the end
[5:58] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[6:00] shall be increased
[6:03] any man thank the Lord for the reading
[6:05] of his word and maybe seize it may we
[6:09] thank the Lord once again that we can be
[6:10] in his presence amen amen amen
[6:15] he's great amen amen demons are being
[6:19] sick yesterday and today and also
[6:22] Shekinah as well and Kim has also been
[6:26] unwell
[6:27] and I said
[6:29] I'm not going to let the enemy have the
[6:31] big dream man he said no matter what how
[6:33] sick I am I'm going to come to the house
[6:35] of the Lord and I'm going to preach a
[6:37] man like we heard the other week amen we
[6:39] should not shed from our
[6:40] responsibilities amen amen I shocked for
[6:43] my responsibility at work today though
[6:46] should I stand at home
[6:47] I've got a doctor's not but how many of
[6:50] you know that you can't get a doctor's
[6:51] note for church amen amen you can get a
[6:54] doctor's note for today but you cannot
[6:56] stay away from church amen the prophet
[6:58] said that he said you can skip work but
[7:01] don't skip church yeah amen be thankful
[7:04] for that amen because this is where we
[7:06] come to draw strength from
[7:07] amen hallelujah
[7:11] amen so we know that you're only going
[7:14] to receive what you come expecting amen
[7:16] so you're gonna pull tonight you're
[7:18] gonna pull from the gift because amen
[7:21] like a baby if a baby doesn't electron
[7:23] and doesn't pull to draw the milk came
[7:25] and the baby is not going to get any mug
[7:26] so if you don't latch on tonight if you
[7:29] don't pull you're not gonna get anything
[7:30] out of it amen so you pull you draw
[7:32] strength amen like with Abraham Jehovah
[7:35] said I am El Shaddai the breasted wine
[7:37] amen amen could draw strength from him
[7:39] amen amen so tonight we want to speak a
[7:43] little bit on
[7:44] the greatest battle ever fought amen I
[7:47] will just call it the waft the Mind each
[7:51] I will say that this eve shall not be
[7:54] deceived in this age amen amen we know
[7:56] we are living in this age
[7:58] amen this great mind age and we know at
[8:01] this time that there's only two Powers
[8:03] at work it's God's power and Satan's
[8:07] power amen it might be it might be in
[8:10] many different forms you might have
[8:12] different nations different political
[8:14] genes different religious societies and
[8:18] all kinds of powers at work but it's
[8:20] really only two Powers at work amen
[8:22] God's power and Satan's power yes but
[8:25] amen how many of you know that Satan
[8:27] doesn't have his own power amen the
[8:29] prophet says that Satan can only pervert
[8:31] what God has already done amen amen so
[8:34] Satan takes amen the righteous act we
[8:37] know and he perverts it and that becomes
[8:39] his power and when he takes the truth
[8:41] and he perverts it and that becomes a
[8:44] lie and that's Satan's power amen he
[8:46] doesn't have his own power
[8:49] but we see these two Powers at work and
[8:51] these two Powers have been at work from
[8:53] the beginning amen before even the
[8:56] Garden of Eden amen we know that Satan
[8:59] has been uh fighting this war against
[9:02] God and when he come down to the Garden
[9:05] of Eden the prophet tells us that those
[9:07] two Spirits always we can trace those
[9:09] two Spirits right back to the Garden of
[9:11] Eden amen we see them in Cain and Abel
[9:14] amen Jacob and Esau you see them in
[9:17] Judas and Jesus amen and now in the end
[9:19] time we have the true church and the
[9:21] false church but it's still the same two
[9:24] Powers at work amen amen
[9:27] foreign
[9:29] says that
[9:31] amen God is preparing an army yes amen
[9:35] and he says this Army is getting ready
[9:37] for battle
[9:40] amen but he says that before this Army
[9:42] can get ready for battle God has to
[9:45] select his soldiers amen so Satan is
[9:47] selecting these soldiers amen we see
[9:50] them forming together
[9:52] in all of these One World governments
[9:54] and all of these religious movements
[9:56] but at the same time God has been
[9:58] selecting his soldiers throughout the
[10:00] years amen and we know that he sent the
[10:03] shout amen he sent the shout to call out
[10:05] the living Saints the amen to gather
[10:08] them and to prepare them amen for war
[10:10] amen he never just prepares Amen to be
[10:14] on a picnic amen he prepared us for a
[10:16] while amen this is the battlefield
[10:19] God is selecting his soldiers and so the
[10:22] prophet says once God selects his
[10:24] soldiers he's then going to address them
[10:26] amen amen and we know this so these
[10:28] soldiers are dressed by the word of God
[10:30] amen amen we are dressed footly by the
[10:33] word of God Amen and we have the old
[10:36] Hammer Of God Amen
[10:38] amen and then after they are dressed
[10:40] amen they are selected for for better to
[10:42] go to strip training
[10:44] say Amen it's to condition them
[10:47] to them amen the emotions cannot affect
[10:51] them because they have been conditioned
[10:53] for that environment all God is using
[10:55] these things to train these soldiers for
[10:57] the
[10:59] and he's been conditioned before he is
[11:02] now ready to go into action amen and
[11:05] it's not in the end time and ready to
[11:08] start
[11:08] amen and we know that this battle
[11:11] actually
[11:12] in heaven amen and he fought against
[11:15] Michael and Michael's Kingdom amen
[11:18] this battle which was actually
[11:22] the Earth amen did not originate on the
[11:25] earth amen you start a day in heaven
[11:28] amen and then it fell upon the human
[11:30] beings amen the enemy came when the
[11:33] enemy was cast out and it was cast out
[11:35] onto the Earth he then began to start
[11:37] saying many same tricks he'd be getting
[11:40] started down in the Earth
[11:45] now the prophet says before any battle
[11:48] can be put in a ray
[11:49] they've got to choose a meeting place
[11:51] yeah they've got to choose a place where
[11:53] they're gonna fight the battle
[11:54] [Music]
[11:56] hey when the Israelite Army was was one
[12:00] Army the Israel army and One bank the
[12:02] other Army on the other bank and then in
[12:05] the city was where David met Goliath
[12:07] amen so choose a place that will be
[12:09] ideal for their army to win even you can
[12:13] find this in sports you will find that
[12:16] um you have a home ground advantage
[12:19] uh like many sport clubs want to play in
[12:22] their home ground because they have
[12:23] their advantages the same thing involved
[12:25] you would want to choose a place that
[12:27] will be with the most tactical uh
[12:30] benefit to your army to win yes yes amen
[12:33] so Satan and God had to choose a place
[12:36] that Mutual meeting place was the mind
[12:40] the greatest battle being fought is in
[12:43] the mind amen the prophet says when this
[12:45] great battle started on Earth there had
[12:47] to be a meeting place amen there had to
[12:51] be a place selected for the battle to
[12:52] begin yes and for the battle to rage and
[12:55] the Battlegrounds begin in the human
[12:57] mind
[12:58] amen where did that start with Eve in
[13:01] the Garden of Eden amen amen Satan
[13:03] attacked her by coming and influencing
[13:06] and trying to pervert and make a reason
[13:08] through her mind yes
[13:10] and if she he made it to reason with
[13:12] God's word through our mind so that is
[13:14] why the prophet says that's where it
[13:16] began
[13:18] day is where the battle starts the human
[13:20] mind was chosen for the place of the
[13:23] battle the way it was where it began and
[13:26] this is because decisions are made from
[13:28] the Mind amen amen so we know it's like
[13:31] in the end time when
[13:33] Jesus is standing at the door and
[13:35] knocking amen he cannot open that door
[13:38] amen that individual has to make the
[13:41] decision to receive this message of the
[13:44] hour to be baptized in his name to
[13:46] receive the Holy Ghost amen then God
[13:49] comes in and the Holy Ghost comes in and
[13:51] has the preeminence and then you become
[13:53] a prisoner of Christ But first you as
[13:56] the individual has to make the decision
[13:58] amen
[14:02] well until you say come in
[14:06] remember Satan cannot come into your
[14:09] ghost amen the only time Satan can
[14:12] interfere with you then is you go out to
[14:14] be here amen he cannot come and be
[14:17] baptized with the Holy Ghost and have
[14:19] fellowship with you unless you've got to
[14:21] meet him with his five senses see taste
[14:25] smell hear and touch
[14:27] Soul writes on the inside
[14:29] which can either own senses can coexist
[14:34] so you cannot have faith and doubt
[14:37] coexisting you can't have 10
[14:40] 90 faith it doesn't work like that
[14:43] you're a God and we share in the word of
[14:45] God and Faith Comes is where God and
[14:47] Satan is at War now fighting for that
[14:50] sword amen one is Faith and now it's
[14:53] been from the beginning of time amen
[14:56] even when Jesus was on the earth in
[14:59] Jesus in the mind because he said if
[15:02] thou be the Jesus mine and overcome
[15:04] Jesus in the mind but what he didn't do
[15:12] amen Jesus could overcome by the world
[15:15] amen he wasn't Overcoming By the flesh
[15:18] they were coming by the spirit amen amen
[15:21] the prophet says if this church right
[15:24] now could be put together ethnicity
[15:27] trust that every person would be in one
[15:29] Accord but yet Desiring the Holy Ghost
[15:31] but what would receive it if you could
[15:34] just get that certain thing fixed what
[15:36] do it
[15:37] your mind is as we said your mind got to
[15:40] accept it it's got to and what is your
[15:43] mind controlled by the prophet says your
[15:45] spirit controls your mind
[15:47] and when your spirit catches the word of
[15:49] God
[15:50] and the word of God is what life in it
[15:53] then it brings that life into you
[15:57] to receive the word of God it brings the
[15:59] life of God Amen
[16:01] amen and when that takes place when the
[16:04] life comes down into that channel
[16:07] amen then the word of God can be many
[16:09] gotta drop down into your soul and
[16:11] through your spirit and into your soul
[16:12] and then the life of God is manifested
[16:15] in and through you
[16:18] so from the middle of the heart which is
[16:21] the soul it's feeding every channel so
[16:24] in the world word of God is down in the
[16:26] middle of your heart and your soul then
[16:27] it starts to feed these different
[16:29] Outlets it's done the enemy is raining
[16:31] in your soul
[16:32] that's when the finale you start to uh
[16:35] question amen so you gotta let God into
[16:37] the control tower amen amen
[16:40] now the prophet is trying to teach us a
[16:42] principle here
[16:44] amen
[16:46] and the prophet says the trouble of it
[16:48] is we stand in in here with a lot of
[16:50] doubt
[16:51] trying to accept what's out there
[16:54] and he says you've got to stop that and
[16:57] come down that Channel with the true
[16:58] word of God and then it goes out he's
[17:01] saying from the soul another word goes
[17:03] out
[17:03] have automatically It's Working Man and
[17:07] then just believe it outside internal
[17:10] aim and it's got to drop down into your
[17:11] soul amen then it starts to project out
[17:14] and the prophet says he's so anxious to
[17:17] see things done
[17:20] do something for God
[17:23] is no doubt anxious like the doctor the
[17:27] resurrection of the Dead the Great
[17:28] Mighty things that our God has done then
[17:31] we are anxious and the thing of it is we
[17:34] try to do these senses to grab a hold of
[17:37] something here like conscious so the
[17:39] prophet he said many times amen we have
[17:42] all of these great things and we want
[17:44] God to do something for our five senses
[17:46] on the flesh we try to grab a hold of it
[17:48] with our five senses in the spirit amen
[17:50] but the prophet is saying no you've got
[17:52] to come to the so many people lots of
[17:54] times as must construed the word and
[17:57] I've been misunderstood by this
[18:00] that I wasn't the problem brother John
[18:03] you know what me and you being neighbors
[18:05] all this time come up here at the altar
[18:08] get down what's he doing
[18:12] the prophet says I wish I had a
[18:13] Blackboard here I could show you what
[18:15] what he's doing he's trying to work
[18:17] through his soul on infections and that
[18:19] doesn't work and now we see this
[18:21] happening in the denominations all the
[18:23] time amen they try to work on your
[18:25] affections they try to work on your
[18:27] emotions amen they try to work on you
[18:30] weeping and crying and trying to plead
[18:32] with you to come to the altar try to
[18:34] make you feel sorry that Jesus died upon
[18:36] the cross for you amen what are they
[18:39] doing they're trying to walk to the
[18:41] outside sensors they imagine but it's
[18:43] not so here in the bride of Christ amen
[18:45] in the blood of Christ the word of God
[18:48] drops down into the soul amen and when
[18:50] God does something in the soul amen then
[18:53] death drives through repentance amen
[18:56] amen you don't have to work on the emote
[18:58] it's driving through his true repentance
[19:02] amen but they try to work on your
[19:05] emotions amen they try to work on the
[19:07] affections
[19:09] you see or May the prophet says maybe
[19:11] he's working on a memory since
[19:14] of his soul
[19:16] John you had a wonderful mother she died
[19:19] uh maybe your great grandfather was a
[19:22] great Pastor in the message amen you see
[19:25] you working on the five senses of memory
[19:27] now amen you say oh maybe uh they lived
[19:31] at the time when the prophet was here
[19:33] and they could see the Miracles they
[19:35] could see what the prophet was doing now
[19:37] you're working on sight amen that's one
[19:40] of your five senses in the flesh is
[19:41] sight that's not the soul amen so it
[19:44] doesn't matter because you was not there
[19:46] the prophet's meeting but yet you
[19:48] believe it
[19:50] kids you didn't hear it then at that
[19:54] time
[19:55] lay a hold of something there
[19:57] so the prophet says you cannot come
[19:59] through your five senses of the flesh or
[20:02] your senses in the spirit like affection
[20:04] and memory but the prophet says it's a
[20:06] free moral agency amen amen you yourself
[20:09] have to let the word of God in
[20:12] and you don't come in because your
[20:13] mother was a good woman or because your
[20:16] neighbor was a Godly neighbor amen you
[20:19] don't come because someone called you
[20:20] just call you to come to church amen
[20:22] amen but you've got to come yourself
[20:24] amen and receive the word of God Amen
[20:27] you come because that God calls you and
[20:30] you accept him on the basis of his word
[20:33] amen
[20:35] and if you can get everything out of the
[20:38] way all conscious all senses and just
[20:41] let the word come in then the word will
[20:44] produce side and just open up the
[20:45] channel amen and say God is eternally
[20:49] true because I'm taking your word amen
[20:51] and that's the battle Prophet says
[20:53] that's the battle that's the thing
[20:55] that
[20:58] from the inside out
[21:01] fails
[21:05] amen now imagine what kind of a faith
[21:07] that's going to be that the prophet says
[21:10] the prophet that even if God was only
[21:12] going to save one you're going to
[21:13] believe yourself to be the one amen if
[21:17] you if the prophet if God was only going
[21:19] to choose one tonight
[21:21] and you were to say you know what God
[21:24] will choose maybe that brother he seems
[21:26] to be the most Cornelius he seems to be
[21:28] the most righteous then there's
[21:30] something wrong with you
[21:31] it is you supposed to be do you want
[21:33] again you cannot die yeah
[21:36] I think that it's going to be someone
[21:38] else
[21:39] now the problem the problem of it is we
[21:42] doubt ourselves sometimes
[21:44] sometimes the one tonight God loves us
[21:46] amen we start to Face mind battles amen
[21:50] can't you see how you feel daily mind
[21:53] that does not mean he has you beaters
[21:55] yet but if you accept what he says then
[21:58] rattlesnakes
[22:00] the prophets who decide to keep it and
[22:02] receive
[22:09] that's the greatest battle amen
[22:11] hallelujah
[22:13] amen
[22:15] that you're not gonna make ends meet
[22:17] amen the enemy is trying to plan
[22:22] you evil thought might crop up into
[22:25] you didn't even have time to let the
[22:27] enemy are trying to put our thoughts in
[22:28] your head
[22:29] imagine the prophet said and the prophet
[22:32] said you can't stop thoughts you can't
[22:35] stop the birds I cannot stop when the
[22:36] enemy just puts a thought in your mind
[22:38] you don't even have time to think it
[22:39] before you even think the toss is dead
[22:41] those are your thoughts and I rebuke you
[22:43] in Jesus name
[22:45] amen so many times when the enemy puts
[22:47] his thoughts in your mind don't the
[22:50] enemy comes and tells you oh but no the
[22:52] doctor knows better okay just down amen
[22:55] amen the doctor by the prophet said when
[22:57] the tree of knowledge cannot do you good
[22:59] anymore then you come over to the tree
[23:01] of life amen hallelujah
[23:04] amen so what's the matter the prophet
[23:08] Channel first amen you've got it
[23:11] the Holy Spirit placed at the battle
[23:15] Amen to take God's word amen amen you
[23:18] the holy spirit in his position amen
[23:20] right there at the Battlefront to take
[23:22] God's word
[23:24] for he is the word and he stands there
[23:27] and there's nothing going to stop it
[23:29] then why because the Bible says if God
[23:31] before me who can be a prophetess just
[23:34] like an old boiler with the flu stopped
[23:37] you put a fire in it and it'll blow your
[23:39] thing up now for those of you who don't
[23:42] know what a flu is it's like a duct or a
[23:45] way for gas or air to flow through it
[23:48] amen so the prophet is saying now
[23:51] these channels that flow from your soul
[23:54] now when you have the word of God in
[23:55] your soul
[23:56] there's got to be a Clear Channel
[23:58] flowing out now from your soul to your
[24:00] spirit to the flesh to the word of God
[24:02] can project right from the soul and
[24:04] manifest itself on the outside
[24:07] they cannot be
[24:09] blocking those channels amen
[24:12] clear amen so that the word of God can
[24:14] flow through you it's because they don't
[24:16] clean the channels out amen they go down
[24:20] the inside you've got to clean it your
[24:22] conscience your memory your thoughts yes
[24:24] amen you got to come into the house of
[24:26] God even when you come into service amen
[24:29] you cannot come amen with your channel
[24:31] is all clogged up amen you gotta come
[24:33] straight up yeah you're gonna come with
[24:35] a clean mind you gotta come with the
[24:37] right atmosphere you gotta come amen
[24:39] with your conscious clear amen not
[24:41] thinking about what went on at work
[24:43] today amen not thinking about what
[24:46] trials you are facing amen laying aside
[24:48] everything and come from the inside out
[24:51] with the adulterated word of God and
[24:54] that is the truth
[24:57] you see you
[24:59] cha spell
[25:01] amen they all write until they disagree
[25:04] with the word of God Amen so you can
[25:07] rely on your five senses amen you can
[25:09] rely on your spirit amen as long as it
[25:12] doesn't disagree with the word of God
[25:14] but amen once it starts to disagree with
[25:17] the word of God once you start to say
[25:19] I'm feeling too sick to go to church
[25:21] today
[25:22] amen starts to disagree with the word of
[25:24] God because the word of God says forsake
[25:26] not the assembling of the ascent of the
[25:28] Saints amen it starts to disagree with
[25:30] the word of God that's when you put your
[25:32] senses aside that's when you put your
[25:34] feelings aside amen amen amen you take
[25:37] the word of God
[25:39] amen my imaginations conscience memories
[25:43] reasons and affections
[25:45] they're all all right until they agree
[25:47] with the word
[25:48] amen but if fiction doesn't agree with
[25:50] the word get rid of it amen the prophet
[25:53] is you'll blow up the fluke right quick
[25:55] yes amen if your reason disagrees with
[25:58] the word get away from it amen
[26:01] now the prophet goes on to say
[26:04] a man that when God is placing his
[26:06] soldiers amen he's placing his soldiers
[26:08] now in the battlefield
[26:10] and it's just like how God placed the
[26:13] great solar system
[26:15] amen the prophet says that whichever
[26:17] planets God placed there and the stars
[26:20] that he placed there it's still there
[26:21] till this day standing at his post of
[26:23] Duty amen and the prophet Likens it unto
[26:27] God's soldiers standing there they post
[26:28] of Duty even the prophet says that's how
[26:32] we need to be standing at our post of
[26:34] Duty amen and we don't move until God
[26:37] says move amen we just stay there our
[26:39] post of Duty amen God set the stars in
[26:43] order and said hang there until I call
[26:45] you amen they stay there and nothing's
[26:48] going to move them amen and when God can
[26:50] get a man in his hands amen until he can
[26:53] get the senses amen the conscience and
[26:55] everything cleaned out and until it
[26:58] stands with God behind in the spirit
[27:00] then there's not a devil in the world
[27:02] that can poke one word of doubt in there
[27:04] amen when God gets a man in his hand
[27:07] amen
[27:08] amen and the prophet says that the mind
[27:10] is the Gate of the spirit
[27:12] [Music]
[27:13] amen so your mind is the gates Amen to
[27:17] the spirit so whatever you infiltrate in
[27:19] your mind whatever you input into your
[27:21] mind remember that's the gate to the
[27:23] spirit amen so if you put a whole lot of
[27:26] fruit in your mind yes you're gonna have
[27:28] a whole lot of food in your spirit amen
[27:31] but if you fill your mind with the
[27:33] things of God Amen the spirit is going
[27:35] to be well fed amen it's like these two
[27:38] dogs the prophet said whichever you feed
[27:40] the most is going to win the battle amen
[27:43] and your mind opens up and accepts the
[27:46] spirit or rejects the spirit
[27:48] amen you can tonight say amen I accept
[27:51] the Holy Ghost into my life
[27:53] and you can receive the Holy Ghost into
[27:55] your life or you can reject it you can
[27:58] reject the word coming from the pulpit
[28:00] amen and then you'll reject life because
[28:03] God projects life from the pulpit amen
[28:05] that's how he's ordained it
[28:07] amen
[28:10] amen the prophet says you can have all
[28:13] of these little feelings and Sensations
[28:16] amen but it has nothing to do with it
[28:20] when the reality comes amen and your
[28:23] mind opens it up your mind either
[28:25] accepts it or rejects it
[28:27] amen and the prophet says God let none
[28:30] of them miss it why because if you
[28:31] reject it amen you're rejecting
[28:34] basically the spirit of God Amen you
[28:36] cannot receive the spirit of God until
[28:38] you accept it
[28:40] amen so we see that the battle amen has
[28:43] been raging on and we said that in the
[28:45] beginning Satan came to Eve amen and he
[28:49] tried to deceive her in her mind and he
[28:51] tried to change and make a reason with
[28:54] the word of God
[28:55] amen and we know that he's done the same
[28:57] in the end time when you see the church
[28:59] world Amen they have reason to the word
[29:02] of God and they began to add their own
[29:04] ideas amen they began to add their own
[29:07] thinking to the word of God another word
[29:10] and the power of God is none effect to
[29:12] them why because Satan has been defeated
[29:15] in their minds amen
[29:22] and the prophet says but God's Gods give
[29:25] God's word the first place
[29:28] amen the prophet says a man can't sin
[29:32] a man cannot sin until first he cast
[29:35] aside God's word
[29:37] amen you cannot fall in sin until you
[29:39] constantly said God's word amen until
[29:42] you decide in your mind to say that I am
[29:44] going to ignore God's word
[29:47] and you willfully say you know I'm going
[29:49] to ignore what God said about this
[29:52] the prophecy is a man cannot sin until
[29:55] he first cast aside God's word amen
[30:01] amen and we know sin is to disbelieve
[30:04] until first he gets rid of the word of
[30:06] God and the presence of God he cannot
[30:09] sin
[30:10] amen so the prophet said we must just
[30:12] accept God's word
[30:13] Amen on the basis we accept his word on
[30:17] the basis that God said so amen we don't
[30:20] accept his word on the basis that we're
[30:22] going to see a result tomorrow Amen on
[30:24] the basis that we are going to see it
[30:26] come to pass tomorrow but we accept it
[30:28] on the basis that God said so like
[30:31] Abraham amen
[30:32] the prophet always dramatized it and he
[30:35] said Abraham would have asked Sarah amen
[30:37] how are you feeling today honey and when
[30:39] you're feeling any different and said I
[30:41] would say no I'm not feeling any
[30:42] different today but Abraham would say
[30:44] Amen praise God we're going to have the
[30:45] baby anyway amen why because he accepted
[30:48] God on the basis that God said so amen
[30:52] he accepted the word on the basis that
[30:53] God promised it and it must come to pass
[30:56] amen amen it doesn't matter what the
[30:58] doctor says it doesn't matter what
[31:00] anyone else says amen God said so amen
[31:04] and God's word is above all things yes
[31:07] amen and God said amen I wish above all
[31:11] the things that I would Prosper amen
[31:12] amen for good health
[31:14] so the prophet is teaching us here and
[31:17] he says we've got to amen we've got to
[31:19] look at these channels and make sure
[31:21] that they are opened up don't just
[31:22] bypass them
[31:24] amen he says that if Satan can get
[31:27] through there if he can get by these
[31:29] conscience and all these other things
[31:31] and he gets right down here to the end
[31:34] of the soul in the mind
[31:37] and now he can just get you you'll never
[31:40] look at one of them until you first have
[31:42] to let him in here
[31:43] you have to let him in and that's when
[31:45] he gets you he gets into control amen
[31:48] and then what he does he begins to use
[31:50] the conscience amen so when he begins
[31:53] when Satan gets a hold of your soul and
[31:55] he's in the control tower now he starts
[31:57] to use all your senses he starts to use
[31:59] your conscience he starts to use your
[32:01] memory he starts to use your reasoning
[32:04] amen so if you ever find yourself
[32:06] reasoning with God's word you got to
[32:08] watch and make sure that the enemy is
[32:10] not in the control tower amen he is you
[32:13] gotta cast him out amen amen and bring
[32:16] God back in amen bring the Holy Spirit
[32:17] back in amen when you start to listen to
[32:21] all these other senses amen start to
[32:23] take self-introspection amen and cast
[32:26] the enemy out amen
[32:28] amen and when Satan walked up to Eve
[32:30] amen he said you know the fruit is
[32:32] Pleasant
[32:33] she stopped for a moment and the prophet
[32:36] says that's where she made a mistake
[32:37] amen he says don't stop for nothing amen
[32:41] you got the message of the hour Jesus
[32:43] Lives amen God is the Healer he has the
[32:46] message don't stop for nothing amen no
[32:49] reasons nor anything else amen but she
[32:51] stopped for a moment and that's when
[32:54] Satan walked right into the Mind amen
[32:56] don't stop for nothing amen when you
[32:59] come across all these you young people
[33:01] amen I believe this message will also
[33:03] been live streamed or recorded you young
[33:06] people when you start to see all these
[33:08] YouTube videos about people who left the
[33:10] message and people now want to give
[33:13] their reasons of why they left the
[33:14] message
[33:15] if you left the message then just stay
[33:17] away
[33:19] if this is not the truth I don't
[33:21] understand why you got to waste your
[33:22] time coming on YouTube and posting a
[33:24] video about it no one cares amen but you
[33:27] young people don't stop to watch all of
[33:30] those nonsense amen because the moment
[33:32] you stop you're giving the enemy a room
[33:34] to work amen amen don't stop to listen
[33:36] to those reasoning if you are not sure
[33:38] about this message of the hour don't go
[33:41] to anyone else except go to your knees
[33:44] to you amen don't even go Amen to
[33:48] someone to talk to amen go to your knees
[33:50] and take me to the Lord in prayer amen
[33:52] amen don't give the devil room to work
[33:54] amen we know that we are remember we're
[33:56] talking about the Mind age we're talking
[33:58] about this greatest battle that is
[34:00] fought in the mind age and I believe our
[34:02] young people amen they are living in one
[34:05] of the most difficult age because with
[34:07] all of these mediums it's so easy for
[34:09] them to be influenced amen it's so easy
[34:12] for other people to influence their
[34:14] minds amen that is why they're going to
[34:16] be prepared for this battle amen and
[34:19] that is why we're going to keep them in
[34:20] Freya yes we gotta hold them up and
[34:23] parents you've got to hold your children
[34:24] up amen because they are facing these
[34:26] demon powers amen amen and these demon
[34:28] powers want to get a hold of their mind
[34:30] I want to influence them I want to give
[34:33] them all kinds of ideas amen you've got
[34:36] on one end you've got the atheist world
[34:38] who wants to show them amen the
[34:41] evolution process and they want to show
[34:43] them the Big Bang Theory and they want
[34:44] to show them how there's proof that
[34:46] there's no God and then on the other
[34:48] hand you get people who have left the
[34:49] message and I want to show them why this
[34:51] message is not the truth amen they're
[34:53] facing all of these demon powers amen
[34:56] but we have the word of God Amen and
[34:58] we're going to stand with the word of
[34:59] God
[35:00] our young people amen why because they
[35:03] are the ones that are going to be caring
[35:05] amen the Batson Amen to the to the to
[35:08] this last race Amen to the Finish Line
[35:10] amen amen so the devil can try all he
[35:13] wants but the Bible says that this bride
[35:16] will not be deceived amen amen
[35:18] hallelujah
[35:19] so Eve stopped for a moment but this
[35:22] bride will not stop amen this bride will
[35:24] continue in the word
[35:28] and he said the prophet says when you
[35:30] get this battle set in a ray the devil
[35:32] is sitting right at every heart amen he
[35:35] says this morning we can say that
[35:36] tonight the devil is setting right in
[35:39] every heart and he's sitting at your
[35:40] hearts he's sitting all around there
[35:44] and he's saying oh I seen your tribe
[35:46] before I heard that before amen Sprint
[35:49] all kind of doubts in your mind amen
[35:51] even when the preacher is preaching he's
[35:53] putting all kind of thoughts in your
[35:55] mind but remember I said there's a
[35:56] difference between a thought and your
[35:58] thoughts amen reject him tonight amen
[36:01] amen no matter what he says reject him
[36:03] amen
[36:05] amen the prophecies cast him out amen
[36:09] why the Bible gave you the power to cast
[36:11] him out so why not cast him out amen
[36:14] we've been trained amen the prophet says
[36:17] and the prophet says what's the matter
[36:19] with our speeches I wonder what kind of
[36:22] training we had
[36:24] God is training us for this great battle
[36:26] in Matthew 24 said
[36:29] and Daniel also said there would be a
[36:31] time of trouble such as never like on
[36:34] the earth before
[36:35] and we're living in that time when
[36:38] culture and here's what we are talking
[36:40] about just now all of these demon powers
[36:42] that we face in when culture and
[36:44] education and things are smothered over
[36:47] the word of God and got into reasonings
[36:49] and so forth the battle is now amen and
[36:52] the prophecies who will stand amen can
[36:54] we testify that we will stand amen can
[36:57] we testify that we will not be defeated
[36:59] amen but we will fight this battle amen
[37:02] amen amen the battle is ready to go in
[37:05] and she's in a Reign now and look at
[37:08] what a great opposition we got Yonder
[37:11] but God's Army is moving forward amen
[37:13] Men of Valor the prophet says men of
[37:16] Faith men of power men of understanding
[37:19] amen they don't have to be smart they
[37:21] don't have to be educated they have to
[37:24] be channels amen are we the channels of
[37:26] God tonight amen the God has to take a
[37:29] hold of those little channels amen
[37:34] amen the prophet says well if I could
[37:36] feel it if I'd feel the glory of God
[37:39] falling prophecies there has nothing to
[37:41] do with it amen like we said in the
[37:43] beginning of the service amen we don't
[37:45] have to feel a sensation to know that he
[37:47] is yeah
[37:48] amen he's promised to be here amen and
[37:51] if we believe it he is yeah yes amen and
[37:54] the prophet we know that the ministering
[37:56] Angel is here amen because God sends his
[37:59] ministry and Spirits to minister unto
[38:01] the church amen so we know he's here the
[38:04] focus is open up that mind that's the
[38:06] Battleground days where the battle sets
[38:09] in a rain
[38:11] amen open it up and say every doubt I
[38:13] doubt my doubts amen you gotta doubt
[38:16] your doubts amen amen I'm believing
[38:19] God's word yes amen you got to say here
[38:22] I come Satan something is going to take
[38:25] place amen amen you gotta come out from
[38:28] amongst your people like Abraham amen
[38:31] and the thing of is it they all of these
[38:33] peoples are doubters and unbelievers and
[38:36] Abraham had to separate himself from all
[38:38] of these people amen just like we've got
[38:40] to separate ourselves now from all of
[38:42] the doubters amen how can amen we be
[38:45] having fellowship with people of no
[38:48] faith people who don't believe because
[38:51] very soon that spirit is going to get
[38:53] amongst us amen
[38:57] okay
[39:02] so now we know that we are living in
[39:04] this great mind age
[39:06] amen the prophet there is this great
[39:08] scientific age amen we are great men
[39:11] like Albert Einstein
[39:14] amen
[39:16] and if you look at it as great as people
[39:18] like Albert Einstein and all of these
[39:21] great scientists were
[39:23] if you look at how advanced the age is
[39:25] gone now any common University student
[39:28] who studied in the same field is just as
[39:31] good as those great math
[39:33] why because they're not through books
[39:35] and whatever they have done whatever
[39:37] science is like Albert Einstein and all
[39:39] has done now these University students
[39:41] just really learn it in a four-year
[39:43] degree
[39:44] something that they took their whole
[39:46] life to figure out
[39:48] something that they worked hard night
[39:50] and day to try and invent to try and uh
[39:53] discover and figure out all it takes is
[39:56] a four-year college degree now to learn
[39:58] those things in fact you don't even need
[40:01] a college degree anymore because now you
[40:03] have something like YouTube that can
[40:05] teach you almost anything
[40:06] if you don't have any expertise in
[40:08] something all you have to do is go look
[40:10] up a quick 10 minute video on how to do
[40:12] something and you'll learn how to do it
[40:14] while we're living in this great mind
[40:16] age amen it's so Advanced now that you
[40:20] know do you know that Albert Einstein
[40:22] did not use a cell phone a cell phone
[40:24] wasn't invented in that time
[40:25] but yet now we have children who don't
[40:28] even know how to sing a full sentence
[40:30] together that knows how to use a cell
[40:31] phone
[40:33] I know this because she kind of knows
[40:34] how to use a cell phone
[40:37] why because we are living in this great
[40:39] minded and you find people saying hey
[40:41] babies actually are so advanced
[40:43] but it's true because we are living in
[40:45] this kind of an age where everything is
[40:48] Advanced knowledge is increased we read
[40:51] it in the opening scripture in Daniel it
[40:53] says knowledge shall be increased in
[40:55] those days and we are living in those
[40:57] days
[40:59] and that's in the natural world now we
[41:02] look in the spiritual world and we see
[41:04] our knowledge has increased you cannot
[41:06] have in the denominational world you
[41:08] cannot be a pastor unless you have a
[41:10] certain degree you have a certain
[41:12] qualification from Bible School
[41:14] amen they are so Advanced they're so
[41:17] amen they learn all different kinds uh
[41:19] types of translations and the Greek and
[41:22] all of these different translations
[41:25] and it's no coincidence
[41:27] that Satan has introduced this in the
[41:31] most intellectual mind age
[41:33] because at the same time that this that
[41:35] Satan has done this God in God's kingdom
[41:39] the mind of Christ has come down and the
[41:42] intelligence has come down in this last
[41:44] day
[41:45] so on the one hand you've got Seasons
[41:46] Kingdom which is increased in knowledge
[41:48] advanced in knowledge and in God's
[41:51] kingdom you've got the mind of Christ
[41:52] that has come down in the end time amen
[41:55] you got amen the prophet could come and
[41:58] say this morning I'm going to take you
[41:59] way back into the back parts of God's
[42:01] mind amen amen
[42:03] why it's because this Battleground that
[42:06] has been created amen remember we said
[42:08] these two Powers God's power and Satan's
[42:11] power fighting for the Mind amen so
[42:14] Satan as Satan is trying to set his
[42:16] Battlefield by getting this greatest
[42:18] intellectual age but God at the same
[42:21] time he's setting up his Battlefield
[42:22] amen by introducing the mind of Christ
[42:25] the very mind of God to be placed in his
[42:28] people amen amen hallelujah amen this
[42:31] great Battlefield is being set
[42:34] amen
[42:36] amen and that that is why the bride then
[42:38] the prophet could say that the bride can
[42:40] say she knows what what he wants done
[42:43] with his word amen why because she has
[42:45] the mind of Christ amen
[42:51] and we see that this is the climax now
[42:53] we know this is the last time that this
[42:55] battle will be fought amen
[42:58] and Satan
[42:59] has blocked this intellectual mind age
[43:02] to entice you and Captivate your mind
[43:06] and God is brought down his mind to
[43:09] capture those that are his amen amen he
[43:13] came fishing for the rainbow trout amen
[43:15] amen hallelujah amen but you've got to
[43:18] make the choice who to accept yes amen
[43:21] do you accept Satan amen with his this
[43:25] great intellectual age now remember when
[43:27] we say accept Satan we don't mean
[43:28] literally you're going up to Satan
[43:30] himself and you're accepting him but
[43:33] when you accept this age when you accept
[43:35] the spirit of this eight and the things
[43:37] that goes with it you accepting Satan
[43:40] amen or do you accept God Amen do you
[43:44] accept the mind of Christ and you can
[43:45] only accept the mind of Christ if you
[43:47] accept the message of the hour amen amen
[43:50] because the message of the hour is the
[43:52] mind of Flesh that is being expressed
[43:53] out amen amen
[43:57] amen so but we know we have chosen amen
[44:01] we've made our decision we've accepted
[44:03] the word of God amen amen and we've let
[44:06] it drop down in our soul we've let it
[44:08] clear out the channels that God can work
[44:10] through US amen
[44:12] okay
[44:14] so the prophet says that you know you
[44:17] only look at the condition of the church
[44:19] amen we we the church is in this great
[44:22] battle now and the prophet says if you
[44:24] want to look at the condition of the
[44:26] church you got to look at the woman
[44:28] correct
[44:30] and now we always use this and we say
[44:32] you know look at how the denomination
[44:34] Church
[44:35] yes because we can see the condition of
[44:37] the woman they're not dressed right
[44:39] they don't acknowledge a man Authority
[44:43] they're preaching and all of these
[44:45] things
[44:47] and that's great that's uh very well and
[44:49] good amen we can see what the condition
[44:51] of that church is
[44:53] but doesn't it apply also to us in the
[44:57] bride where we say if you want to see
[44:58] what the condition of the message said
[45:00] is we're going to look at the woman
[45:02] because the prophet says if you want to
[45:03] look at the church you look at the woman
[45:06] amen so we're going to look at ourselves
[45:08] now in this great battle amen we got to
[45:11] look at what the condition of the woman
[45:13] I in the message amen are the woman in
[45:16] the message on fire for God amen we're
[45:20] gonna see uh are they the same as they
[45:22] were back in the days of the Prophet
[45:24] when you had this great Trail Warriors
[45:25] woman that could pray amen women
[45:28] remember women are not allowed to preach
[45:31] in the church right and that is as much
[45:33] as we know from the word of God Amen but
[45:35] his sister is not prevented from saying
[45:37] amen amen a sister is not prevented from
[45:40] shouting hallelujah amen amen we know a
[45:43] sister is not prevented from worshiping
[45:45] God and singing out aloud in the church
[45:47] or giving testimonies or amen or praying
[45:52] amen all we know is that she's not
[45:54] allowed to preach the word and she's got
[45:56] a reverence her husband as a Lord amen
[45:58] we know that that much is true
[46:01] but amen but when we look at the
[46:03] condition of the uh of the woman in the
[46:06] church in the denomination we see that
[46:07] they have despised Authority amen we say
[46:11] they have rejected the word of God so we
[46:13] know that that church has rejected the
[46:15] word of God amen but in the message now
[46:18] amen do we have the woman of Faith like
[46:21] we had amen the cinema woman of this day
[46:24] amen you know the prophet spoke about
[46:26] the cinema woman of this day who said
[46:28] Lord I am your woman where is your
[46:30] Elijah yes amen she was so connected
[46:33] with a prayer and in faith to God it was
[46:35] so effective that she could ground the
[46:38] plane amen a big gigantic plane she
[46:42] could ground just by her prayer amen
[46:44] just by our faith amen not only that her
[46:47] signal was so strong she was able to
[46:50] send out a GPS signal Amen to direct the
[46:53] profit amen she sent out a live location
[46:55] amen amen you thought Google Maps
[46:57] invented sharing of a live location amen
[47:00] but yes she was yeah her signal was so
[47:03] strong amen that that person amen began
[47:06] to be sent to the prophet amen and then
[47:08] the spirit of God could tell the prophet
[47:10] amen keep walking amen I can imagine how
[47:12] the prophet must have been walking and
[47:14] that GPS must have been said okay tell
[47:15] him right here amen and as the prophet
[47:18] was walking he says turn left yeah amen
[47:20] keep walking keep walking why all
[47:23] because a sister was so connected to our
[47:25] God Amen all because she had so much of
[47:28] Faith amen amen that she was able to
[47:30] send her that signal amen and amen the
[47:33] prophet was led right to her doorstep
[47:35] amen amen and she was not hoping
[47:39] she was standing there at the doorstep
[47:41] waiting for him to come amen why she
[47:44] knew he was on his way she had that kind
[47:46] of a faith hallelujah amen and the
[47:48] prophet amen the prophet said you pray
[47:50] first and when she began to pray the
[47:52] prophet said when she began to pray I
[47:54] first revived amen hallelujah amen do we
[47:58] have the same kind of woman in the
[47:59] church tonight amen amen how many
[48:02] encouraged his sisters tonight amen to
[48:03] be a good like TD Jakes tonight amen to
[48:06] say women lose amen because for too long
[48:09] in the message I believe we've been
[48:11] hindering the sisters amen by trying to
[48:13] put them down and make them feel like a
[48:15] doormat amen the Bible only said you
[48:17] cannot preach and the Bible only says
[48:19] you're going to respect your husband but
[48:21] other than that you're an equal basis
[48:23] amen because you are you yourself have
[48:25] to receive the Holy Ghost and if you
[48:27] receive the Holy Ghost you are born born
[48:30] again full with the spirit of God Amen
[48:32] so you will react the same way a brother
[48:34] does because it's the same kind of a
[48:36] holy spirit amen it's not going to make
[48:38] a brother act in one way and a sister
[48:40] act in a different way no sir amen it's
[48:43] the same kind of a spirit yes amen that
[48:45] is why amen sometimes amen when the wife
[48:48] at home amen if she begins to pray if
[48:51] she begins to read the word or listen to
[48:52] the tape amen the husband now begin to
[48:55] feel condemned amen you begin to say you
[48:57] know I'm the head of the house if she
[48:58] can do it why shouldn't I amen should
[49:00] begin to revive the husband and then the
[49:03] sermon can look at what she is doing
[49:04] amen and they begin to get influenced
[49:06] amen hallelujah amen and that is why
[49:10] amen even with Mary amen she might have
[49:13] raised Jesus amen she might have been
[49:15] amen the woman that raised Jesus from a
[49:17] baby but Amen on the day of Pentecost
[49:20] the prophet says she too had to receive
[49:22] the Holy Ghost and when Mary received
[49:25] the Holy Ghost she started to stagger
[49:26] like a drunk person as well amen just as
[49:29] much as Pizza amen she said in the
[49:31] speaking tongues just as well how many
[49:33] of you know that in the prophet's days a
[49:36] lot of the sisters used to speak in
[49:37] tongues you get on the tapes amen
[49:40] hallelujah amen now you think I'm only
[49:43] talking about the sisters but remember I
[49:45] said if you watch the condition of the
[49:46] sisters you see the condition of the
[49:48] church amen hallelujah so I'm actually
[49:51] talking about the church tonight amen we
[49:53] if our sisters has the power of God then
[49:56] the church has the power of God if the
[49:58] sisters are powerless in the church then
[50:00] the church is powerless
[50:02] amen hallelujah so let's encourage the
[50:05] sisters tonight amen let's encourage the
[50:07] brothers amen amen let's encourage the
[50:10] young ones yes amen because why when we
[50:13] all comfortably frame together come and
[50:15] standing at our host of gypsy amen the
[50:17] young ones come come in and add your
[50:20] life to the church add in your
[50:21] youthfulness to the church amen the
[50:24] brothers come in and add in your
[50:26] boldness to the church add in your Vigor
[50:28] for God Amen the sisters come in and add
[50:31] in your spirit to the church add in your
[50:33] humbleness to the church adding the
[50:35] characteristics that God bless you where
[50:37] Amen to the church then the church
[50:39] starts to operate together amen
[50:42] hallelujah
[50:43] amen the prophet spoke of great women of
[50:47] his day amen how many have you know this
[50:49] this Prophet spoke of anti-writes Amen
[50:51] who was able to agree with the word of
[50:53] God Amen when she agreed with the word
[50:55] of God it began to activate the third
[50:58] full ministry amen not a brother but a
[51:01] sister amen hallelujah yes
[51:04] so we see amen that the church is in
[51:07] about condition getting ready Amen to
[51:10] fight this Great War amen and the enemy
[51:13] is trying all of his remember the
[51:14] prophet says the enemy has one last blow
[51:16] amen and he's entitled to that one last
[51:19] blow amen and no doubt the enemy is not
[51:22] the enemy is a strategic fighter he's
[51:25] not just gonna take that blood any time
[51:27] he's gonna wait for you to be at your
[51:28] weakest amen he's gonna wait for you
[51:31] when is the right opportune time because
[51:33] the devil is an opportunist amen he's
[51:36] gonna try with that last blow because he
[51:39] knows after the last blow he has nothing
[51:40] left
[51:41] amen but how many of you know that that
[51:44] even the last blow is nothing but a lie
[51:46] because the Bible says amen we are more
[51:49] than conquerors to Christ Jesus amen
[51:51] Christ who defeat the enemy on the trust
[51:54] amen hallelujah
[51:59] amen

[52:21] whether it's through work whether it's
[52:24] to the families whether it's true the
[52:26] world is trying amen but the enemy is a
[52:29] liar amen yes

[52:51] about the solar system and that one of
[52:53] them is out of place everyone keeps its
[52:56] time perfectly God's Great and God's
[52:59] Great Army I thought of the soldiers how
[53:01] that if that Moon would happen to get
[53:03] out of order the Earth would be covered
[53:05] again with WhatsApp just in a few
[53:07] minutes the Earth would be just like it
[53:11] was void and darkness and whatso was
[53:13] upon the breath of the like that has to
[53:16] keep its place everything
[53:18] gets out of order how it throws the
[53:21] whole thing out of cancer how it's
[53:23] important amen you might think now that
[53:25] you staying at home and it's not
[53:27] affecting the church but then everyone
[53:31] we should continually just we should
[53:33] continue to strive to keep the order of
[53:35] the spirit amen
[53:37] and I went to God
[53:40] this tree Harmony that the Holy Spirit
[53:43] would place every member of the body
[53:45] that's if we just hold our position okay
[53:50] that Dr Holbrook was going to take off
[53:53] took the cancer without even leaving his
[53:55] car don't you know that the same God
[53:57] position amen amen like the stars

[54:15] a life amen The Great Battle Is Over Now
[54:18] worldwide God wants his children
[54:21] the sea the the sensation amen the
[54:25] prophet likened it like with that little
[54:27] bird that's in the end
[54:30] the prophet says that
[54:32] there's only one way for that bird to
[54:33] get out of that egg shell is for it to
[54:36] pick its way amen amen now it might be
[54:39] afraid to get out of the eggshell he
[54:41] doesn't know what's on the outside
[54:43] amen all it knows is what's in that
[54:45] shell
[54:46] but it needs to keep on talking until
[54:49] the child lets it out it doesn't matter
[54:52] what voices of fear or doubt it hears or
[54:55] it doesn't matter how much they say
[54:57] there is no more Supernatural it doesn't
[54:59] matter how much they say there is no
[55:01] more helium it doesn't matter how much
[55:03] they say that the circumstances cannot
[55:05] change you have to just keep on picking
[55:07] out of that shell that circumstance that
[55:09] you're in that situation that you're in
[55:11] amen the prophecies with the dusted of
[55:14] the Lord here amen maybe with a little
[55:16] Hebrews 13 8 amen you just keep packing
[55:19] your way out of that condition amen with
[55:22] a little ax anything in my name you keep
[55:24] pecking your way out of that position
[55:26] amen amen and by the way let me tell you
[55:29] something that mama bird amen cannot
[55:32] break that shell from the outside
[55:34] because if it does so it will kill the
[55:36] bird amen the shell is just meant to be
[55:39] that temporary situation but that little
[55:41] bird has to pick itself out of the shell
[55:43] and the prophet says he never goes back
[55:46] to that shall again amen once that bird
[55:49] breaks out of that shell amen he's free
[55:51] oh my the word once it gets sent down to
[55:55] all these senses
[55:56] and Consciousness amen and things to get
[55:59] settled down here and the mind opens up
[56:01] and lets it in Prophet says oh God have
[56:04] mercy there's never nothing to bondage
[56:07] it again amen and that is why the church
[56:09] should not be on the bondage tonight
[56:11] amen because we have broken our way out
[56:13] of the shells of this denominations amen
[56:16] amen and the word of God has settled in
[56:18] our hearts so there should not be any

[56:33] do anything more to you amen so what's
[56:36] the matter with all these people that
[56:37] left the message amen the word never
[56:40] settled in their souls amen
[56:43] Hallelujah
[56:47] amen the prophet says and it's not what
[56:50] the size of the dog that counts amen but
[56:52] it's the size of the fight in the dog
[56:54] that counts amen he says if you're a
[56:57] coward then get back and cuddle in your
[56:59] hole but brother if you're a soldier
[57:02] amen stand out there there's a battle
[57:04] going on Amen right around the prophet
[57:08] says the battle is engaged let's fight
[57:10] amen hallelujah amen I like the story
[57:13] that the prophet tells about pizza
[57:15] Cartwright
[57:17] Pizza Cartwright God told him to go down
[57:19] into a certain place and I'm not going
[57:21] to read the whole story it's quite long
[57:23] so I'm just going to paraphrase it the
[57:24] prophet tells him
[57:26] to go down into uh sorry God tells Peter
[57:29] Cabra to go down into a certain place
[57:30] and have a Revival service so he goes
[57:33] down and I think he gets a place and he
[57:35] starts to clean the place up
[57:36] so in this town There's this bully amen
[57:40] Prophet that I don't think the prophet
[57:41] gives his name but there's this big guy
[57:43] and he walks around with his pistol and
[57:46] he hears that piece of cartridge wants
[57:48] to have a Revival in this place so now
[57:50] this bully wants to go and tell Peter
[57:52] Conrad you can't have a Revival here
[57:54] so he goes up to Peter Cartwright and
[57:57] tells them you can't have a Revival yeah
[57:58] I run this place
[58:00] and he tells pizza cut right
[58:03] if you want to have a Revival here
[58:05] you're gonna have to go through me first
[58:07] so Pizza can't write amen he was in the
[58:11] Battleground amen he know God
[58:12] commissioned him to be there so Pizza
[58:14] Cartwright why is wiping the windows he
[58:16] says okay if I have to go through you
[58:18] next then that's what I'll do next amen
[58:21] Pete the prophecies Pizza Company got
[58:23] down of the chair and he punched this
[58:25] guy to the floor and beats him up and he
[58:27] says amen now I can go on preaching amen
[58:30] I can go on with the mission of God Amen
[58:32] so the prophet says we're gonna be like
[58:34] that amen when the enemy wants to come
[58:36] and put us down and bury us down amen
[58:38] we've got a mission of God Amen we've
[58:41] got to slay every demon amen we've got
[58:43] to fight amen but don't fight the devil
[58:46] on his grounds amen you've got to bring
[58:49] the war image your grounds to God's
[58:51] grounds amen if you try to fight the
[58:53] devil and he's done he's gonna whoop you
[58:55] every time amen like Nelly Sanders amen
[58:58] you know the story of Nelly Sanders the
[59:00] prophet said amen she stopped by that
[59:02] dancing place
[59:04] amen and she just stopped to hear the
[59:07] music she was not in the devil's grounds
[59:09] amen and the D and the enemy had her
[59:11] whipped amen but the prophet says just
[59:14] keep going amen keep chopping with the
[59:16] sword the word of God and he says Don't
[59:18] Stop like when the prophet said to him
[59:21] he said take my stuff and lay it on the
[59:24] child to recover amen he said don't stop
[59:27] for no money if someone greets you on
[59:28] the side don't stop and read them just
[59:30] keep on running with the stuff amen and
[59:32] that's how we're gonna run with the
[59:34] message of God Amen don't stop to anyone

[59:56] that are blocking the channels amen amen
[1:00:00] how many of you know that when the angel
[1:00:02] of the Lord told the prophet something
[1:00:06] amen the devil's the word of God
[1:00:08] amen I'm not talking about now in the
[1:00:10] prophet
[1:00:11] maybe studied something and made a
[1:00:13] prediction or something like I'm sorry
[1:00:14] when the angel of the Lord told the
[1:00:16] prophet to do something it was the word
[1:00:17] of God Amen you believe that
[1:00:20] amen but so when the angel told the
[1:00:23] prophet not to have television
[1:00:25] amen why do we still have it the word of
[1:00:28] God isn't it amen the angel of the god
[1:00:31] the angel of the Lord told the prophet
[1:00:34] not to have it
[1:00:35] amen but we are fighting on the enemy's
[1:00:38] ground we are coming on the enemy stuff
[1:00:39] we allow in all of these things to come
[1:00:42] into our home and now the sword is
[1:00:44] cutting both ways because I'm preaching
[1:00:45] to myself as well amen we allow the
[1:00:48] enemies to come into our homes we allow
[1:00:51] him to infiltrate our minds we are lying
[1:00:53] to shape our minds by all of these
[1:00:55] things that we watch amen begin to be
[1:00:57] desensitized to the presence of God why
[1:01:00] because we are watching the filth of the
[1:01:02] world
[1:01:03] doesn't matter what we are watching now
[1:01:04] the brother the angel of the Lord told
[1:01:06] him don't have television period
[1:01:08] amen you never say okay have television
[1:01:10] watch this don't watch this period don't
[1:01:12] have television
[1:01:13] amen but we allow these things to come
[1:01:16] into our homes
[1:01:17] amen and then now we want to wonder why
[1:01:20] amen the spirit of God doesn't move when
[1:01:22] we come to church on a Sunday we come to
[1:01:24] church on a Wednesday amen the ninth
[1:01:26] spiritual gifts as we've been preaching
[1:01:28] these last few weeks are not operating
[1:01:30] why because the prophet says that
[1:01:33] channels are not cleared up amen the
[1:01:36] word of God was supposed to be in the
[1:01:38] soul supposed to be projected on the
[1:01:40] soul
[1:01:40] write out fun Amen to the outside
[1:01:43] supposed to be manifesting the power of
[1:01:46] God suppose we manifest in the works of
[1:01:48] God because the Bible says these Saints
[1:01:51] shall follow them that believe the Bible
[1:01:53] says the words that I do shall give you
[1:01:55] also that either the word of God or is
[1:01:57] not the word of God and if it's the word
[1:01:59] of God it must be in effect and the only
[1:02:01] time it will not be effect if we are not
[1:02:04] right amen I think many times the
[1:02:07] problem is we schedule much may be wrong
[1:02:10] but we don't want gen between me wrong
[1:02:12] amen we want to
[1:02:14] how uh whatever we want in later this
[1:02:17] year we want to indulge a little bit in
[1:02:19] leaders here we want to have a little
[1:02:20] bit of this a little bit of that and
[1:02:22] then we still want to have the presence
[1:02:23] of God and it doesn't work that way
[1:02:25] because like I said in the beginning you
[1:02:27] cannot have 10 doubt and 90 Faith you
[1:02:30] can only have 100 Faith or 100 doubt
[1:02:34] amen and there's no such thing amen as
[1:02:37] watching a decent family movie anymore
[1:02:39] it maybe could be possible a few years
[1:02:41] ago
[1:02:42] amen because everything you watch now
[1:02:45] has a homosexual couple in it that's
[1:02:47] correct amen everything you watch now
[1:02:50] has something to do that's against the
[1:02:52] word of God there's no such thing as a
[1:02:53] decent thing to watch anymore amen amen
[1:02:56] so
[1:02:58] hey man I'm not done with this demon yes
[1:03:00] amen let's deal with this demon tonight
[1:03:02] amen amen in the army of Israel when
[1:03:05] they were at War yeah amen
[1:03:07] Joshua was victorious in every battle
[1:03:10] amen amen from the time that Moses left
[1:03:14] Joshua's victories in every battle until
[1:03:17] Aiken took up the accuracy that's nice
[1:03:19] amen
[1:03:21] and in this message amen the ministers
[1:03:23] that have gone by amen they started to
[1:03:27] fight victoriously after the prophet
[1:03:29] left they started to uphold the message
[1:03:31] amen they started to win every battle
[1:03:33] amen they started to be victorious but
[1:03:36] somewhere along the line we begin to
[1:03:38] touch on the accurate thing we begin to
[1:03:40] start to take the things of the world
[1:03:41] and bring it into the camp of the Lord
[1:03:43] amen and that is why now we cannot have
[1:03:46] the victory because there's Aikens in
[1:03:48] our camp amen and when I say Akins in
[1:03:51] our camp something that can be ourselves
[1:03:52] as well amen but now we've got to get
[1:03:55] rid of those things amen how long is it
[1:03:58] going to be until we say it's time to
[1:04:00] call a sovereign assembly and when I say
[1:04:02] something is not righteous we need to
[1:04:04] see the moon of God In This Place amen
[1:04:06] and something is not right and maybe we
[1:04:08] are the problem amen what is the problem
[1:04:11] we need to get cleared out we need to
[1:04:13] clear out the channels and let the word
[1:04:15] of God settle in our soul and when the
[1:04:17] word of God is settled in our soul we
[1:04:20] cannot digest any anything else amen you
[1:04:23] cannot feed on anything else amen and
[1:04:26] it's not just television we're letting
[1:04:28] all other aspects of the world into our
[1:04:30] homes amen whether it be amen with all
[1:04:33] of these hairstyles amen used to be a
[1:04:35] man that uh when we when I first came in
[1:04:39] the message I know things were quite
[1:04:40] strict day man but in these days like
[1:04:42] living in the message is easy
[1:04:44] amen there's no strictness
[1:04:47] there's no uh like a certain level to
[1:04:50] keep I know when I first came the
[1:04:51] message you know it was like a level you
[1:04:53] keep in you know you're living at such a
[1:04:55] level
[1:04:55] but why is it becoming so easy to live
[1:04:58] in the message
[1:04:59] we listen on the bar slowly we let you
[1:05:02] down the bars amen and God cannot work
[1:05:04] amongst us amen we've been preaching for
[1:05:07] the last few weeks amen about the about
[1:05:09] the gifts starting to operate again
[1:05:10] about God's power moving again
[1:05:13] but amen when are we gonna start taking
[1:05:15] action amen it's good to hear it in a
[1:05:18] sermon but when we're gonna start taking
[1:05:20] action amen when are we going to begin
[1:05:21] to fast and pray again when we go we're
[1:05:24] going to begin Amen to have those online
[1:05:26] prayer meetings again amen amen maybe
[1:05:29] the brothers get together and go out to
[1:05:31] the beach amen start to have a testimony
[1:05:33] night so that you have a prayer nights
[1:05:35] again amen amen it can only have stopped
[1:05:38] back in that day amen we can do it today
[1:05:40] Nothing Stops us from doing it again
[1:05:42] maybe we need to try something different
[1:05:44] throw in a few extra Services amen we
[1:05:47] got to do something different if we want
[1:05:49] to change the position that we are in
[1:05:51] amen we can't just come in weekend with
[1:05:53] the same kind of tradition amen just
[1:05:55] come to church you're in a sermon and
[1:05:58] there's nothing wrong with your sermons
[1:05:59] don't get me wrong the word of God is
[1:06:01] being treated directly the word of God
[1:06:04] is being preached truly amen but if we
[1:06:06] don't do anything about it then it's
[1:06:08] nothing but a sermon
[1:06:10] amen hallelujah but how many of you
[1:06:12] tonight want to clear out the channels
[1:06:14] amen how many of you want to get rid of
[1:06:16] all of these demon Spirits in our homes
[1:06:18] amen amen these demon spirits that we
[1:06:21] are allowing to infiltrate our children
[1:06:22] amen and remember
[1:06:25] even these little ones amen they get
[1:06:27] accustomed to watching all of these
[1:06:28] cartoons and there might be nothing
[1:06:30] wrong with the cartoons but as they grow
[1:06:32] big now you gotten them accustomed to
[1:06:34] watching TV so as they get bigger they
[1:06:37] want to watch other things and now you
[1:06:39] want to stop them from watching
[1:06:40] television but they say but you was
[1:06:42] making me watch television all along
[1:06:43] what's the difference now
[1:06:46] why are we getting them accustomed to
[1:06:47] all the wrong things and that is why now
[1:06:50] they can't even read you know in in in
[1:06:52] I'll say the olden days but perhaps when
[1:06:55] I was small as well children who used to
[1:06:58] actually read books yeah how many
[1:07:00] children read books these days I'm not
[1:07:02] talking about the message now I'm
[1:07:03] talking about books in general
[1:07:05] don't read books anymore because they
[1:07:07] have a television to visually display
[1:07:10] the info information to their Royal
[1:07:12] phone YouTube Etc but how many of you
[1:07:15] know that as much as those screens are
[1:07:17] feeding your information it's killing
[1:07:19] your brain cells in the natural
[1:07:22] it's scientifically proven it's
[1:07:25] scientifically proven there is much more
[1:07:27] educational to listen to a radio station
[1:07:29] where you're not looking at it visually
[1:07:31] then watching television because when
[1:07:34] you're watching television your brain
[1:07:35] doesn't have to do anything the visual
[1:07:37] aspect is already giving you the
[1:07:39] interpretation of the information
[1:07:41] whereas when you listen to a radio
[1:07:43] station or something your imagination is
[1:07:46] to imagine it so your brain has been
[1:07:48] stimulated
[1:07:49] the same when you're reading now you
[1:07:51] have to imagine it so your brain is
[1:07:53] being stimulated so in the natural their
[1:07:56] brain cells are being killed now what
[1:07:58] about the spiritual because they feed in
[1:08:01] on garbage so their spiritual brain
[1:08:03] cells bear in mind that the mind is
[1:08:05] where the Battleground is the spiritual
[1:08:08] minds are being destroyed
[1:08:10] all because we are letting them be
[1:08:12] destroyed amen but let's change that
[1:08:14] tonight amen let's get rid of the
[1:08:16] accursed things in our homes let's get
[1:08:19] rid of their cursed things in our lives
