[2:40] Jesus Christ amen good to see every one
[2:42] of you amen good job brother Ramesh back
[2:46] hallelujah amen we certainly missed him
[2:49] I was telling you missed him in church I
[2:52] almost missed him again today
[2:54] but amen praise the Lord that he gives
[2:56] us a victory over every circumstance
[2:58] amen hallelujah let's turn to our Bibles
[3:01] Hebrews chapter 11 amen just keep a few
[3:04] Believers that were mentioned in prayer
[3:06] even uh araly amen and Zion
[3:09] amen
[3:11] Hallelujah
[3:14] pray the question for the same schools
[3:18] Pizza amen they request we pray for her
[3:21] as well
[3:21] I believe she's in hospital again with
[3:24] water in her lungs immense will be
[3:27] requested prayer
[3:28] amen listen to Hebrews chapter 11 and
[3:31] verse 1.
[3:32] this would be the name of the Lord amen
[3:36] says here now Faith is the substance of
[3:40] things hoped for amen amen
[3:43] amen so faith is true is there you can
[3:46] find it if you define it faith is a
[3:48] substance one of things hopeful
[3:51] and two the evidence of Things Not Seen
[3:54] amen then we'll go to Second Corinthians
[3:56] 4 18.
[4:06] it says so we fix our eyes not on what
[4:08] is seen
[4:10] but on what is unseen
[4:14] amen
[4:17] we fix our eyes not on what is seen But
[4:20] on what is unseen for what is seen is
[4:23] temporary but what is unseen is eternal
[4:27] amen
[4:30] and then second Corinthians chapter 10
[4:32] reading from verse 3
[4:41] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[4:43] not walk after the flesh
[4:46] Amen in this life we walk in the flesh
[4:50] but we do not walk after the flesh for
[4:53] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[4:55] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[4:58] pulling down of strongholds
[5:03] and this is the verse we want to focus
[5:05] on
[5:06] casting down imaginations
[5:10] and every eye thing that exalted itself
[5:13] against the knowledge of God
[5:15] and bringing into captivity every
[5:18] thought to The Obedience of Christ
[5:22] but that's my focus there bringing into
[5:24] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[5:28] of Christ
[5:29] how we think will determine the way we
[5:31] live in this life
[5:33] amen so we are bringing into captivity
[5:35] every thought is it saying only the
[5:38] spiritual thoughts
[5:39] every thought
[5:42] to The Obedience of Christ
[5:45] and having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[5:47] Disobedience when your obedience is
[5:50] fulfilled amen may be seated
[5:53] the Lord blessings to the reading of his
[5:55] word amen
[5:58] Hallelujah
[6:04] amen for a subject I want to speak on
[6:06] when Sons speak
[6:08] and for title I want to say
[6:12] countering negativity with positivity
[6:17] amen
[6:23] countering negativity with positivity
[6:27] amen amen amen what are we doing in this
[6:29] amen because being a teaching lesson and
[6:32] it's a witness in that Bible study and a
[6:34] prayer meeting
[6:35] hmm and if we were walking this way then
[6:37] sons of God speak a certain way
[6:41] we don't see things the way the world
[6:43] sees things we don't see things the way
[6:45] the normal Christians see things
[6:47] we are not normal Christians amen we are
[6:50] sons of God back in the image and after
[6:52] his likeness
[6:53] amen so we speak differently we speak
[6:57] like God
[6:58] we think like God didn't the Lord say my
[7:01] ways are higher than your ways my
[7:03] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[7:04] amen but now that he's brought us join
[7:07] tears with Jesus Christ we ought to be
[7:09] thinking like Jesus thought speaking
[7:11] like Jesus spoke acting like Jesus acted
[7:15] amen hallelujah so we read here and he
[7:19] says though we walk in the flesh we do
[7:21] not war up to the flesh so we are Waging
[7:24] War against the flesh
[7:28] that's the first battle we got there
[7:29] amen
[7:31] is to wage war against the flesh to
[7:33] bring the flesh man and the subjection
[7:34] amen amen and it says for the weapons of
[7:37] our Warfare not carnal But Mighty
[7:40] through God the pulling down of
[7:41] strongholds meaning we have divine power
[7:44] to destroy strongholds
[7:47] amen through the power of the Holy
[7:49] Spirit we have divine power to destroy
[7:52] struggles there's not a situation you
[7:56] and I should be able to walk in where we
[7:58] leave that place and we are not
[7:59] Victorious
[8:01] amen amen if there's a demon there the
[8:03] demon must leave
[8:05] if there's a sick person there they must
[8:06] be healed amen
[8:08] amen we should walk with such confidence
[8:11] amen we are not at baby church amen come
[8:15] on now amen every situation we encounter
[8:18] did Jesus leave every situation that he
[8:21] was in for the good or better when he
[8:24] came in the presence of sick did he
[8:25] leave them sick or did he heal them
[8:28] amen hallelujah amen when he didn't have
[8:32] means to of a boat to get to the ship
[8:35] where the disciples were did that stop
[8:37] him he began to walk on the water amen
[8:40] amen when he was asleep on the boat and
[8:42] the winds and the waves were raging and
[8:45] Satan was trying to cause his stuff
[8:47] did he allow that storm you were
[8:49] sleeping the disciples woke him up if
[8:51] they didn't wake him up he would have
[8:53] slept through the storm
[8:54] because he was the master of the storm
[8:56] yes amen and then he spoke to the stone
[8:59] yes
[9:00] amen now very very strange but let's
[9:04] just go through the scripture then we'll
[9:05] talk more casting down imaginations and
[9:08] every High thing that exalted itself
[9:10] against the knowledge of God bringing
[9:12] into captivity every thought to The
[9:15] Obedience of Christ now if that thought
[9:17] is a positive thought and it's a
[9:19] faithful thought then do we need to
[9:21] bring it into obedience
[9:24] no right
[9:25] so then that thought must be a negative
[9:27] thought yeah
[9:29] if we have to bring a thought into
[9:31] captivity it must be a negative thought
[9:34] it must be a thought against the word
[9:37] amen so we have to bring even our own
[9:40] speech in alignment with what God's word
[9:43] says you know Jesus encountered every uh
[9:47] attack of the enemy every Temptation Of
[9:49] The Enemy by saying it is written I'm
[9:52] going to give you a common example now
[9:54] when we go to a doctor and the doctor
[9:56] diagnoses the case and cancer of high
[9:59] blood pressure sugar diabetes maybe even
[10:02] heart disease whatever
[10:04] what does a doctor do
[10:07] does he write
[10:09] now you're walking and you're confronted
[10:12] with it is written
[10:14] but there's two it is written
[10:16] there's what the doctor wrote
[10:19] and then it's what God word wrote
[10:21] God word wrote and says by his stripes
[10:24] you were healed amen healing is the
[10:26] children's bread amen amen but the human
[10:30] mind is so conditioned and negativity
[10:33] sets in
[10:34] and you know that even right now you you
[10:36] may be seated here
[10:39] but if your mind is wandering you're not
[10:40] here really yes
[10:43] yes
[10:43] you could be physically in your flesh
[10:45] body but if you could probably be in
[10:48] your kitchen right now
[10:51] that's how powerful your mind is
[10:55] amen
[10:56] Hallelujah
[10:58] some of you guys were in love no
[11:00] you constantly with your girlfriend no
[11:03] matter where you are
[11:04] you thinking of
[11:06] now the Bible says think on these things
[11:08] that are lovely that are pure amen we
[11:11] got to think on the things of the Lord
[11:12] amen
[11:15] so we are we are
[11:17] we have two things that we said now we
[11:19] got the doctor's report
[11:21] it is written you have this and God's
[11:24] word says you do not have it
[11:27] what do you read in second Corinthians 4
[11:29] 18 we fix our eyes not on what is seen
[11:34] we don't look to the symptoms but what
[11:36] is unseen so faith is speaking what you
[11:39] want and not what you see yes
[11:42] yes amen Abraham call those things that
[11:44] are not as though they were yes
[11:46] yes
[11:47] amen now we are Spirit sons of God Amen
[11:51] born son Spirit sons that when we speak
[11:54] our word is backed amen why is our word
[11:57] bad because we are in the image and
[11:59] after his likeness amen we can't help
[12:02] but speak faith
[12:05] amen now sometimes it goes through
[12:07] training training is bringing you up in
[12:09] the sonship now we can try and please
[12:12] many people in this life but you've got
[12:14] to please the Lord Jesus Christ I'm
[12:16] going to remind you of a story now this
[12:18] young man he either was a piano player
[12:20] but some music
[12:21] thing he was doing I think he was a
[12:23] violent play or maybe a music player
[12:26] and he was having this great big
[12:29] audition
[12:31] and he played and after he played
[12:34] everybody was cheering he was getting a
[12:36] standing ovation but his eyes was not
[12:38] fixed on them
[12:40] amen his eyes was not fixed on the
[12:43] standing ovation and the hundreds of
[12:44] people that were standing and applauding
[12:46] him
[12:47] his eyes was fixed up to the balcony
[12:50] and he was looking for the approval of
[12:52] one person
[12:54] his teacher the one who taught him
[12:57] and when he looked up his eyes was fixed
[13:00] on him
[13:01] and when he got the Master's approval
[13:03] amen then he was satisfied in his heart
[13:06] then he took a bow amen Hallelujah so we
[13:10] have got to be fixed from pleasing the
[13:11] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[13:13] amen amen so what am I saying that
[13:15] sometimes in life people may want us to
[13:18] go along with their negativity to go
[13:20] along with their way of life now even
[13:22] scientists testifying that negativity
[13:25] will bring diseases and illness
[13:28] amen and people think that the reasons
[13:30] for the entire body of prolonged eggs
[13:33] have nothing to do with their negative
[13:35] thoughts but even science is saying that
[13:38] if you're constantly negative it has an
[13:40] effect on the body
[13:42] so then the mind that can bring
[13:45] sicknesses upon your body yes you know
[13:47] there's something about Job the prophet
[13:49] says that his faith would have brought
[13:51] him through it and he showed him that
[13:53] not have been destroyed by these
[13:55] negative thoughts brought you to it
[14:00] he was constantly troubled about his
[14:02] children you read that in perfect Faith
[14:05] the prophet will tell you that amen
[14:08] so when someone is a pessimist
[14:11] if someone is in amen constantly
[14:14] negative it has an effect on emotional
[14:17] health
[14:18] amen doctors have found the people with
[14:20] high levels of negativity are more
[14:22] likely to suffer from degenerative brain
[14:26] diseases cardiovascular problems
[14:28] digestive issues recover from sickness
[14:31] much slower than those with a positive
[14:33] mindset
[14:35] now you can't get more positive than the
[14:37] word of God
[14:40] because Faith cometh by the hearing of
[14:42] the word of God
[14:43] amen
[14:44] hallelujah so we have got to commit
[14:47] ourselves to the word and prayer
[14:50] amen we must know the word of God
[14:53] we've got to read the word of God
[14:56] amen then the spirit comes and takes
[14:59] that word and quickens it and when we
[15:01] need that word we can take that word
[15:03] which is building faith in our heart and
[15:05] applying that word
[15:06] amen otherwise if I if if we are not
[15:10] filled with the word of God when we are
[15:12] facing a trouble a circumstance we have
[15:14] nothing in our God no ammunition
[15:19] amen our sword is blood
[15:24] amen
[15:25] so yeah I am reading now from science
[15:27] negative emotions stop us from thinking
[15:30] and behaving rationally and seeing
[15:33] situations in a true perspective
[15:36] when this occurs we tend to see only
[15:38] what we see and remember only what we
[15:41] want to remember
[15:42] you see many times Christians get caught
[15:45] up in this
[15:46] the only concerned about that sickness
[15:48] the illness the lack of finances their
[15:51] trouble
[15:51] they only see what they want to see and
[15:54] they forget the word of God
[15:56] you forget the promises of God that's
[15:58] not walking in sonship that's not
[16:00] walking in authority
[16:02] amen we have got to constantly clothe
[16:05] ourselves with the word of God Amen I'm
[16:08] gonna ask you again do you read your
[16:09] Bible daily amen amen make it there make
[16:13] it a lifestyle to read your Bible and
[16:15] don't just read a verse try and read a
[16:17] chapter in the morning try and read a
[16:19] chapter in the evening amen amen if you
[16:21] get a chance during the day read a
[16:23] chapter yes
[16:25] amen peel yourself on the things of God
[16:29] amen now I'm asking you again how many
[16:32] of you are reading the Bible
[16:35] you say oh
[16:37] now this is for those that really are
[16:38] doing it I know as most people don't
[16:40] even listen to the messages anymore The
[16:42] Prophet's messages
[16:44] but Sam only will listen to The
[16:46] Prophet's messages
[16:47] and they won't read the Bible
[16:50] but the prophet's message came to bring
[16:53] light upon the scripture amen
[16:57] you've got to know the word for yourself
[17:00] amen so we have got I'm saying it again
[17:03] we've got to commit ourselves to the
[17:05] world
[17:06] because when you pray doesn't the Bible
[17:08] says that even ourselves we don't know
[17:10] what to pray but the spirits makes
[17:11] groanings on our behalf what is the
[17:14] spirit doing there is nothing more
[17:16] powerful than bringing back the
[17:17] scripture to God Amen
[17:22] when we pray back his word yes
[17:25] what does it say
[17:27] I think it's Isaiah 55 and verse 11 it
[17:30] says
[17:32] that my word will not return void
[17:35] hey man but it will accomplish the
[17:37] purpose for which you to ascend amen I
[17:40] am telling you if you speak word if you
[17:42] speak a word of healing if you speak a
[17:44] word over your finances if you speak a
[17:46] word no matter what you're speaking if
[17:48] you're playing about faith stand there
[17:50] till it comes back amen
[17:52] the word will not return void
[17:55] amen
[17:58] amen we've got to train ourselves now
[18:00] come on
[18:02] if you're praying maybe you're left home
[18:04] and you prayed for your child who's
[18:06] unwell
[18:08] phone back in us because you're
[18:10] expecting to hear the positive results
[18:12] how's the baby now
[18:15] how's the baby now
[18:17] can't be every time you hear the cough
[18:19] every time you say Thank you Lord
[18:22] she's healed thank you Lord he's healed
[18:24] amen counter every negative thing with
[18:27] positivity bring every thought and
[18:30] opinions and captivity of the Holy
[18:32] Spirit
[18:34] amen
[18:35] hallelujah amen we've got to look past
[18:38] the sea in church amen there's a whole
[18:41] Supernatural World out here amen
[18:43] hallelujah when and amen and kept around
[18:47] by a host of angels
[18:49] amen we can't be walking ignorance of
[18:51] these things not in this time not in
[18:53] this season not in this hour
[18:56] amen hallelujah
[18:58] amen
[19:02] it's yeah he says amen negativity sends
[19:06] our body into stress and you know
[19:08] something called fight or flight mode
[19:10] our body is designed to deal with
[19:12] stressful situations by releasing
[19:14] cortisol into the bloodstream making you
[19:16] more alert and focused though some
[19:18] stress is good for us too much can be
[19:21] detrimental for our health and extended
[19:23] periods of negativity slows down
[19:25] digestion and decreases the immune
[19:27] system's ability to fight inflammation
[19:30] that is also why negative people are
[19:33] more likely to get more sick than
[19:35] Optimus
[19:36] now that is a study done at University
[19:38] it's not even
[19:40] the prophet
[19:45] if human study is telling you what
[19:48] negativity can do to your body
[19:51] amen hallelujah
[19:54] you find sometimes we take certain
[19:57] things and we we think that it's just
[19:58] normal things headaches chest pain
[20:00] fatigue upset stomach sleep problems
[20:03] insomnia anxiety depression social
[20:06] withdrawal drastic changes in your
[20:09] metabolism all of these things are
[20:11] because of the effect of negativity yeah
[20:13] amen I'm sick
[20:15] I got this I got that you're speaking
[20:18] negativity upon your body
[20:22] amen
[20:24] we we spoke this already that prolonged
[20:26] negativity hurts your mental health amen
[20:29] making individuals more likely to turn
[20:31] to smoking substance abuse as a way of
[20:34] coping
[20:36] amen
[20:38] now in the same way negative thoughts
[20:40] create neutral Pathways in the brain
[20:42] positive self-talk and reinforcement can
[20:45] also become a habit
[20:48] now when I'm saying positive talk I'm
[20:50] not talking about worldly positive talk
[20:53] I am talking about applying the word
[20:55] there's nothing more positive than the
[20:57] word
[20:59] amen
[21:01] happiness joy
[21:05] amen being optimistic
[21:07] and let the word influence us amen now
[21:11] in the midst of your problem I want you
[21:13] to be able to practice this in the midst
[21:15] of your trial don't panic
[21:20] today you may say all is well why are
[21:22] you preaching this tomorrow all may not
[21:24] be well for you
[21:25] but still your confession must be all is
[21:27] well
[21:28] amen if you hear somebody say it's bad
[21:31] say it's good
[21:35] if you see somebody just say it's a it's
[21:38] a child that's misbehaving say thank you
[21:41] Lord and thank you for the good behavior
[21:43] don't speak the negative yes amen
[21:47] amen you say oh brother what are you
[21:48] trying to do I am trying to make you
[21:50] change the way you speak
[21:52] because life and death lay in the power
[21:55] of the
[21:56] what is life positive death is negative
[22:02] amen amen
[22:04] let's extend their thought Mark 11
[22:07] 23.
[22:09] 22 he goes to a fig tree
[22:13] right that
[22:15] trigger life
[22:17] but the mountain there's a mountain of
[22:20] life

[22:26] life in the mountain

[22:32] so what did Jesus say did he speak to
[22:35] the Fig Tree which had life
[22:37] and the mountain which which is dead
[22:40] so there's life and death
[22:43] who is the resurrection and the life who
[22:45] has power over the over living things
[22:47] and dead things
[22:49] what is he saying there
[22:51] you can speak to living things and it
[22:53] will obey you and you can speak to dead
[22:55] things and it will obey you
[22:58] man yeah yeah I also got it today don't
[23:00] worry
[23:03] Jesus is telling us as Sons you can
[23:06] speak to living both the living things
[23:07] and the dead things
[23:09] dead things must come back to life and
[23:11] Obey you yes
[23:14] and even living things if they are
[23:16] living growths cancer negative thoughts
[23:19] you can curse it it'll die to the roots
[23:21] we just look at the fig tree
[23:24] you bring your thoughts on the Captivity
[23:26] we let it die at the roots
[23:30] now we're not talking about this I want
[23:33] you to be so conscious of it that even
[23:35] in your own homes when you start to
[23:37] communicate
[23:38] start to change the way we think
[23:41] and if the families can just be
[23:42] sensitive to this and don't take offense
[23:44] when the wife says but let's not speak
[23:46] negative or the husband says let's not
[23:47] speak negative amen what are we doing
[23:50] reconditioning the way we speak as Sons
[23:52] and Daughters of God
[23:54] amen
[23:57] now do you know there's another form of
[23:59] negativity which is subtle and comes
[24:01] into US is that is speaking bad about
[24:04] others
[24:06] how many of you know every time you
[24:07] speak bad of others it just brings a joy
[24:09] in the house
[24:14] such it's exuberant joy that everyone's
[24:16] rejoicing
[24:18] or does it create a spirit
[24:21] a negative attitude that now you're also
[24:24] fast and you sing you're so angry with
[24:26] that person too and the person telling
[24:28] you that you're listening to that story
[24:29] you also become angry because that's
[24:31] your friend and you want to be angry for
[24:32] your friend
[24:37] now you can do it physically or you can
[24:40] do it on the telephone
[24:45] not one amen
[24:48] we can do it on the telephone
[24:51] every time you see this number you know

[25:15] you see this
[25:16] what did the Corinthians say I look at
[25:19] the Unseen not at the scene
[25:22] amen
[25:23] so when we come into a church
[25:25] environment even and you see something
[25:28] the prophet says pray for that
[25:30] but don't wait to go as soon as you get
[25:32] home phone now you saw this you saw this
[25:37] what did the Lord say why don't you take
[25:39] out
[25:41] the beam from your eye
[25:43] instead of trying to take out the mode
[25:44] from somebody else's heart amen
[25:47] hallelujah
[25:49] I'm trying to go slow I'm trying not to
[25:50] get
[25:51] amen I'm trying to bring it out clear so
[25:55] that everybody understands amen amen I'm
[25:57] also going very slow because you see the
[25:58] way Autumn is writing there's so much
[26:00] notes that she needs to catch up amen
[26:03] Hallelujah Give the Lord a good answer
[26:06] for praise amen
[26:09] thank you
[26:11] now when you see something that you're
[26:13] working on now remember you are working
[26:16] on your situation you're working on
[26:17] yourself
[26:19] now when God was working on the Earth
[26:22] and when he was creating
[26:24] did he say it was good
[26:27] when something when Moses was chipping
[26:30] away at this
[26:31] sculpture in his mind every day he would
[26:34] look and whenever he finished he would
[26:36] say it is good
[26:37] you can see it coming into
[26:40] he can see it coming into me to
[26:42] materialize into what's in his mind
[26:47] now there's a powerful thing there hold
[26:49] a picture of what you want in your mind
[26:51] shape it
[26:53] no no not just circumstances and things
[26:55] and material things yes you do that
[26:58] it'll work for you
[26:59] but how about you your image of the Son
[27:01] of God of you amen hold a positive image
[27:04] Lord I thank you Father I am in the
[27:06] Statue of a perfect man I'm in your
[27:08] image and I'm in your likeness and when
[27:10] I speak oh god father even the heavens
[27:12] obey Lord Jesus he said whatever bind on
[27:14] Earth is bound in heaven whatever loose
[27:17] on Earth he's loosed in heaven father
[27:19] amen amen
[27:23] glory be to his name amen amen so every
[27:27] time you're through working on something
[27:28] say it is good it is good
[27:31] amen when you're correcting someone son
[27:34] I don't like what you're doing amen but
[27:36] I see you amen maturing in Christ I see
[27:39] you coming into wisdom I see you coming
[27:41] into understanding speak positivity into
[27:43] that person amen don't say you you can
[27:47] end up a good for nothing person
[27:52] Speak Life
[27:54] amen Speak Life
[27:56] the only time you're allowed to speak
[27:58] negative against somebody is if they are
[28:01] rejecting the gospel
[28:02] that's the only time the gospel the in
[28:04] the Gospels it tells you that's your
[28:06] feet
[28:07] and walk away
[28:09] amen but here we have the time
[28:13] you do good you speak good now Jesus
[28:16] amen the Lord
[28:17] six times five times he said it was good
[28:19] and the sixth time he said it's very
[28:21] good so God has not changed
[28:24] is God working all things together in
[28:27] your life
[28:28] Now The God Who worked to create the
[28:31] heavens and the Earth after each thing
[28:33] he created he said it was good now he's
[28:35] still working on you
[28:39] and that's when the Bible says he makes
[28:42] all things work together for our good
[28:43] amen so you are still a work in progress
[28:47] and God is not finished with you so
[28:49] don't look at your life in a negative
[28:51] way
[28:52] don't get disappointed at your
[28:54] disappointments
[28:56] you are not the sculpture
[28:59] you are not the Potter you are just the
[29:01] clay yes so why do we get negative about
[29:04] our negativity
[29:06] why do we get negative about our
[29:08] thoughts and our failures
[29:11] the Lord didn't need say in his prayer
[29:14] we can come back to him and say Lord
[29:15] forgive me
[29:17] as I forgive those that don't worry you
[29:19] are that are filled with the Holy Spirit
[29:21] you watch how the holy spirit will start
[29:23] to make you change your very own nature

[29:31] bless them and you'll say Lord even
[29:32] bless them Lord Jesus amen amen that's
[29:35] what the Holy Ghost does
[29:38] changing us molding us into the image of
[29:41] Jesus Christ

[29:50] that the person that hurts you and you
[29:52] never spoke to for years you got the
[29:55] Holy Ghost you can pick up the phone
[29:56] inform that person
[29:58] and say brother we have some unresolved
[30:00] issues

[30:05] amen I want to tell you that I'm praying
[30:06] for you and I love you

[30:12] it brings reconciliation
[30:14] amen now these things are foreign
[30:18] these things we don't want to hear but
[30:21] we are bringing every thought
[30:24] captive
[30:28] the Holy Spirit knows how to bring your
[30:30] every thought capture amen
[30:33] even the ones that you're pushed down
[30:35] there
[30:36] in your secret compartment
[30:38] he knows how to bring
[30:40] you think you think
[30:42] you think in your mind what does the

[33:09] pass through and don't let it anchor
[33:12] you can't help it from going through
[33:14] your mind but don't let it stop
[33:21] he says here some people say one day if
[33:23] you call a prayer line one day if God
[33:25] will speak don't think that kind of
[33:28] negative thought don't let it go through
[33:30] your mind make every word positive and

[34:17] level
[34:19] amen
[34:22] he says now now you remember when we
[34:24] come in for healing we come into a
[34:26] situation we need to Center the
[34:28] scriptures around that so if it's
[34:30] healing you need to Center your thoughts
[34:31] around healing yes
[34:33] yes he says I want every person in here
[34:35] to have this in your mind that as soon
[34:37] as your prayer begins to go for the sick
[34:39] every one of you is going to get up and
[34:42] walk out of this building well

[35:14] there be any praise if there be any
[35:15] virtue think on these things

[36:18] with a negative thought
[36:22] he that cometh to God must believe that
[36:24] he is and a rewarder of those that
[36:28] diligently seek him
[36:31] you see when you come to God he must
[36:33] reward you
[36:34] he rewards faith
[36:37] amen glory be to his name
[36:44] the problem of God tells us about Mary
[36:51] amen when he's talking about Mary he
[36:54] says Mary when the angel came to Mary
[36:58] and said
[37:00] behold the animate of the Lord she
[37:02] started rejoicing she was happy God had
[37:05] promised it she knows she was going to
[37:08] have a baby I believe I spoke something
[37:10] about it last night she didn't wait till
[37:12] she felt alive
[37:14] amen she didn't wait till she was
[37:16] positive she didn't wait till any
[37:19] visible sign she just believed what the
[37:21] angel said was the truth
[37:24] even if you get the people to believe
[37:26] you
[37:28] know that doesn't only apply to the
[37:30] prophet
[37:33] the prophet says I'm going to bring it
[37:34] down to you but I want to take the
[37:36] progression of thought now follow me he
[37:38] says if you don't believe the one that's
[37:39] preaching it
[37:41] if you don't have confidence in the one
[37:42] that's preaching it you'll never receive
[37:44] anything from God
[37:45] if you don't believe the one that God
[37:47] has sent
[37:48] how are you going to receive it
[37:50] lovely you take that even further
[37:52] because you also a son and daughter of
[37:54] God Amen you know God has made us all
[37:57] join Jesus with Christ
[37:59] amen do you know that you and I are
[38:02] equal in the eyes of God We're All Sons
[38:03] and Daughters
[38:05] amen
[38:08] so God don't look at us with partiality
[38:12] God looks at us according to our faith
[38:14] [Music]
[38:17] amen
[38:20] so we must believe what the angel said
[38:24] the angel told the prophet if you can
[38:26] get the people to believe you
[38:28] not even cancer will stand in your way
[38:30] and I'm saying to you tonight
[38:33] that if you can get the people to
[38:34] believe you amen amen
[38:37] because I'm believing that you are the
[38:39] word made flesh now amen you are the
[38:41] manifested word in this time in this
[38:43] season if you get the people to believe
[38:45] you not even cancer will stand in your
[38:48] way believe us now this amen amen
[38:52] the problem is there's two things I find
[38:54] one of them is love the other is sweet
[38:56] and they are sweethearts amen and when
[38:59] love gets married to Faith love always
[39:01] accompanies faith when you love God
[39:04] enough to know that he can't lie to you
[39:06] it'll create faith in there that'll make
[39:08] you believe his word and every word he
[39:10] said is positive truth and you accept it
[39:13] with an unadulterated faith that won't
[39:16] say no
[39:18] amen
[39:21] when Jesus says yes nobody can say no
[39:25] nothing can't say no
[39:28] it'll produce that's exactly what he
[39:30] said he would do deep calling to deep
[39:33] forget not all of his benefits who
[39:36] forgiveth all their iniquities who
[39:38] healeth all of thy diseases
[39:41] amen glory be to his name just want to
[39:44] go through a few more quotes here amen
[39:46] just to see what the prophet is saying
[39:47] he says faith it's some direct positive
[39:51] act that you have
[39:52] what are we speaking about countering
[39:55] every negative thought with faith with
[39:59] positivity
[40:01] so he says faith is some direct positive
[40:03] act that you have faith is the only
[40:06] directed positive sense it's the Sixth
[40:08] Sense
[40:10] so your five cents is all negative
[40:15] he says faith is the only positive sense
[40:18] amen it's a sixth sense it's not
[40:20] guesswork
[40:26] amen hallelujah
[40:28] praise the name of the Lord
[40:39] so don't wait amen until you feel a
[40:41] certain way if you don't feel better if
[40:43] you have faith according to your faith
[40:45] say Lord be unto me
[40:47] be that to me according to Thy word Lord
[40:50] amen
[40:52] all seven seals are open
[40:54] all Mysteries are open

[40:58] nothing has been hit from you yes God
[41:01] has taken you to the bad part of his
[41:03] mind reveals him hidden Mystery Secrets
[41:06] there's nobody else who has the Hidden
[41:08] Mysteries like the Bride of Jesus Christ
[41:10] like you the sons and daughters have and
[41:12] he's bringing you to his image and his
[41:14] likeness and he's equipping you and
[41:16] building you up the world is producing
[41:18] faith in us amen and according to your
[41:20] faith so shall it be
[41:22] the circumstance you are in now is
[41:24] because of your faith
[41:30] the level of your thinking right now is
[41:31] because of your faith because you think
[41:34] a certain way
[41:35] amen so no matter how how you feel don't
[41:39] look at how you feel
[41:40] amen look at what God's word says
[41:43] amen
[41:46] if somebody is sick no matter how you
[41:48] feel you're healed anyhow no matter what
[41:50] you see you're healed anyhow you know it
[41:52] there's nothing you take it out of your
[41:54] heart
[41:56] no matter what you are trusting the Lord
[41:57] for
[41:59] see it believe you have received it
[42:04] amen
[42:05] now according to science they say it
[42:09] takes 21 days to break a bad habit
[42:14] yeah
[42:15] amen
[42:17] 21 days to break a bad habit
[42:22] so
[42:24] how many days how many weeks is that
[42:27] three weeks
[42:29] amen
[42:30] to break a bad habit and what is a
[42:33] season three months
[42:36] so you can't be sowing
[42:38] constantly why do you think people are
[42:41] in season after season season after
[42:43] season in the same struggle in the same
[42:46] cycle right if you are not sowing a
[42:49] countering the negativity how are you
[42:52] ever going to reap in hours
[42:53] how is the season going to change you've
[42:56] got to counter the negative season amen
[42:58] the problem God even says sometimes in
[43:00] the daytime sometimes it's a nighttime
[43:03] sometimes we go through a rough catches
[43:05] but in the rough patches so amen
[43:07] positive words of freedom
[43:10] turn that season around
[43:14] amen so no matter what you see it's a
[43:16] positive act right there if you can't
[43:18] have enough God you have what the
[43:20] prophet says now if you can't have faith
[43:22] enough for God to patch up this body to
[43:24] glorify him in how much more are you
[43:27] going to afraid to believe that God will
[43:28] take this whole mortal body
[43:30] and make immortality out of it to take
[43:33] it up that's direct Divine Healing he
[43:36] says it more simply in another way he
[43:38] says if you can't have faithful Divine
[43:40] Healing how are you gonna offer it to
[43:42] the rapture
[43:44] amen
[43:46] if you can't call your situation into
[43:48] obedience
[43:52] you know that everything we are is
[43:54] thoughts
[43:56] everything that we do our actions and
[43:58] everything is based on thoughts
[44:02] amen it's based on thoughts
[44:06] hallelujah amen I don't want to Cloud
[44:09] your mind with too many thoughts let's
[44:11] go back to second
[44:13] Corinthians 4 18 just to reaffirm now of
[44:16] scriptures so that you remember these
[44:18] things
[44:26] so we fix our eyes not on what is seen
[44:30] are you writing these scriptures down
[44:32] are you memorizing it
[44:34] amen I'd like everyone to carry
[44:36] notebooks and note these scriptures now
[44:39] remember the season that we are in now
[44:41] it's equipping you
[44:44] so these scriptures you must memorize it
[44:47] you must lay before you we fix our eyes
[44:50] not on what is seen But on what is
[44:52] unseen for what is seen is temporary but
[44:55] what is unseen is eternal
[44:57] right then I want to get to
[45:00] second Corinthians 10 and verse 5
[45:02] casting down imaginations
[45:05] some people only imagine negative things
[45:07] some people only imagine imagine vain
[45:10] things some people only imagine
[45:14] wicked things
[45:16] some people only have worldly Desires in
[45:20] the imaginations
[45:21] so you got to cast down imaginations
[45:26] some people imagine that people don't
[45:28] like them
[45:30] do you know that
[45:34] luckily we don't have any here
[45:37] some people have mental battles that
[45:40] people don't like them
[45:41] you gotta cast down imaginations
[45:46] what is this High thing that the Bible
[45:48] is talking about you
[45:51] and every High thing that exalted itself
[45:53] doesn't it say we wrestle not against
[45:55] flesh and blood
[45:56] spiritual wickedness in where I places
[46:01] then the Bible says that every High
[46:03] thing will be brought down
[46:06] you see
[46:08] every High thing
[46:11] so Satan exalts his negative thoughts
[46:13] negative thinking every eye thing that
[46:15] is exalted what is the knowledge of God
[46:18] if it's not faith
[46:21] is the knowledge of God faith Revelation
[46:23] is faith
[46:25] what is faith
[46:27] is it a revelation
[46:28] so the knowledge of God is revelation
[46:32] so can you see the negativity and
[46:34] positivity there every I think the
[46:37] negative things that exalted itself
[46:39] against the Revelation the faith of God
[46:42] and bringing into captivity now
[46:45] you know what's captivity when you hold
[46:47] something captive
[46:49] what you doing
[46:51] brother Joshua if you're trying to
[46:53] capture a criminal captivity
[46:56] why do you how you capture them
[46:59] you make sure they are secured in
[47:00] handcuffs
[47:02] if this is a hunting term
[47:04] how do you bring something into
[47:06] captivity you bind them in Chains
[47:09] Satan is trying to hold you down in
[47:11] Chains of whatever thing it is now
[47:14] but you hold him in Chains it says you
[47:17] bring into captivity every thought it's
[47:19] in the Battleground every thought to
[47:22] what The Obedience of Christ what is The
[47:25] Obedience of Christ
[47:26] the word
[47:27] the mind of Christ you bring it back to
[47:30] the word and you make him bow down to
[47:32] the word
[47:33] what is he doing you're bringing the
[47:34] thought to The Obedience of the word you
[47:36] make that thought bow down there we sang
