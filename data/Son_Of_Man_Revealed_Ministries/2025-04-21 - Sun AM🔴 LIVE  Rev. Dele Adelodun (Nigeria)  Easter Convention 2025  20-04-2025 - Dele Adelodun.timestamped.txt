[1:05:58] Gracious Almighty
[1:06:00] God, we thank you this
[1:06:03] morning for another privilege to be back
[1:06:07] in thy house. Yes, Lord. Our soul can
[1:06:10] rejoice this morning. Yes. Because we
[1:06:14] are feeling the victorious vibration of
[1:06:16] heaven. Yes, Lord. That the battle is
[1:06:19] over. Yes, Jesus. And we are thankful
[1:06:22] for the great and mighty conqueror
[1:06:26] who defeated Satan. Yes. Defeated sin.
[1:06:30] Yes. He defeated death. Yes. He defth
[1:06:34] every temptation
[1:06:36] and every powers of hell. The sin shall
[1:06:40] by no means have power over us again.
[1:06:44] Because when he received the victory,
[1:06:47] he gave us the trophy. Amen. And by this
[1:06:50] we are more than conqueror.
[1:06:53] Thank you dear father for what you did
[1:06:56] for us. Our soul will never forget that
[1:07:00] because of this we have brought
[1:07:02] appreciation this morning by way of
[1:07:05] praise and thanksgiving.
[1:07:08] Father may you accept our worship. May
[1:07:11] you accept our praises. May you accept
[1:07:14] all our offerings. May you also accept
[1:07:17] our person.
[1:07:19] And nothing God will stand between our
[1:07:22] soul and our savior. Nothing will hide
[1:07:24] your face from us. Come by one more time
[1:07:29] and bring the bread of life unto us.
[1:07:32] expand it unto us, Lord, like you did on
[1:07:35] the road by us. That our eyes of
[1:07:38] understanding will be
[1:07:40] illuminated and we shall become
[1:07:42] lightfooted by the revealed world having
[1:07:46] the cares and the bodies of life rolled
[1:07:48] away. We shall become lightfooted to go
[1:07:52] the whole stretch of a journey to
[1:07:54] declare that you are indeed alive to
[1:07:57] give the evidence of your resurrection.
[1:08:00] Let our heart come within us one more
[1:08:02] time to take in the service. Lord, every
[1:08:06] need that will be represented or are
[1:08:08] represented in your house this morning.
[1:08:11] Father, I pray that you will minister
[1:08:13] grace. You will minister provision move
[1:08:17] through the audience of your people, but
[1:08:20] please don't pass
[1:08:22] no post of each person. May you discern
[1:08:26] their needs, oh God, and grant to them
[1:08:29] the substance of their requests and
[1:08:31] their desires. Fulfill their joy. Settle
[1:08:35] them. Make them happy and take glory, oh
[1:08:39] God, and give them a testimony. Be with
[1:08:42] us through this service, Lord, both
[1:08:44] morning and evening. And bless all the
[1:08:47] saints wherever they are gathered today.
[1:08:50] Let it not be a time of ritual
[1:08:52] observance. Let it be a time of
[1:08:54] freshness of an encounter with you that
[1:08:57] indeed we all can say from that time.
[1:09:01] Bless your servants. Bless the audience.
[1:09:04] Take over the atmosphere. I think the
[1:09:06] environment will be charged by your
[1:09:08] power. Thank you for the song service.
[1:09:11] Thank you for the song leaders, the
[1:09:13] musicians. Thank you for your children
[1:09:15] who ministered to us by way of special
[1:09:17] numbers and all that have been rendered
[1:09:20] in your presence. Oh God, may you cap it
[1:09:23] up, oh God, with the blessings of your
[1:09:26] word. And we'll be careful to return
[1:09:28] thanksgiving when all shall be over
[1:09:30] today in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:33] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:43] The Lord bless you saints.
[1:09:45] I wish you happy Easter.
[1:09:49] come to somebody and wish them happy
[1:09:50] Easter
[1:09:55] and we pray
[1:09:57] that the hero of God who rise on a day
[1:10:00] like this will give a quick name to
[1:10:03] honor the winters of life had frozen in
[1:10:07] our lives in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:10] Amen. God bless you. Welcome to the
[1:10:13] house of the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:16] Uh if you have your Bibles with
[1:10:19] you so that I don't keep you
[1:10:22] standing, let's turn our Bibles to the
[1:10:25] book of Amos this
[1:10:27] morning. The book of
[1:10:30] Amos chapter
[1:10:35] 4. Amos chapter 4. I just want to read a
[1:10:42] verse.
[1:10:47] Verse 12. Amos 4:12.
[1:10:57] If you are there, say amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:01] Okay. Therefore, thus will I do unto
[1:11:05] thee, O Israel.
[1:11:07] And because I will do this unto thee,
[1:11:11] prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
[1:11:16] May the Lord add his blessings to the
[1:11:19] reading of his holy word. God bless you.
[1:11:22] You may be seated.
[1:11:34] Once again, I would like
[1:11:36] to
[1:11:38] thank the pastors for the privilege
[1:11:42] uh given unto me to come and be of
[1:11:45] service to the people of God.
[1:11:48] And uh I sincerely hope somewhere the
[1:11:52] service can be of a blessing. Amen.
[1:11:54] Amen. And uh I appreciate every one of
[1:11:57] you for coming
[1:12:00] uh to the service.
[1:12:02] Your coming is an encouragement to the
[1:12:04] preacher
[1:12:06] because when the preacher comes to town
[1:12:08] like I said in the first service, our
[1:12:11] expectation is not to come and speak to
[1:12:14] cheers
[1:12:16] and to benches because the gospel is not
[1:12:18] meant for cheers.
[1:12:20] The gospel is meant for human beings.
[1:12:23] Amen. So if the Lord give us people to
[1:12:25] speak to, it's such a privilege. That's
[1:12:28] right. And we will not take that for
[1:12:30] granted. Amen. We will do all we can to
[1:12:34] be of service. And then when the Lord
[1:12:37] bless it, it becomes a blessing. So
[1:12:40] thank you for coming. And uh it's such
[1:12:43] an encouragement.
[1:12:45] The Lord bless everyone of you. The
[1:12:47] sacrifices you are making to sit under
[1:12:50] the elements like this. I can see a lot
[1:12:52] of you already finding
[1:12:55] yourself. Yeah. The Lord will the Lord
[1:12:58] will give you a certain time in his
[1:13:00] presence. Amen. The prophet said the
[1:13:02] reason we endure this heat is because we
[1:13:05] want to escape a greater
[1:13:08] heat. So the Lord bless you as you make
[1:13:12] the sacrifice. And uh he also told us
[1:13:16] that the things that God bless most are
[1:13:19] sac are services that come with form of
[1:13:21] for sacrifice or the other. So when you
[1:13:25] endure the elements like that and you
[1:13:27] travel the far you have come and all
[1:13:31] those things I believe God uh is going
[1:13:35] to bless you.
[1:13:37] So God bless you. You are welcome
[1:13:41] this morning. If the Lord will be our
[1:13:44] help, which he has always been,
[1:13:47] I would like to speak on preparing to
[1:13:50] meet the coming king.
[1:13:53] Amen. Amen. The coming king rose up on a
[1:13:57] day like this. Amen. And uh in the book
[1:14:02] of Acts chapter
[1:14:03] 1, like I said the other
[1:14:07] day, when he was ascending, in his final
[1:14:10] ascension,
[1:14:12] two angels came back to give comfort to
[1:14:15] those who are gazing.
[1:14:17] He said, "Why stand ye gazing?"
[1:14:21] This same Jesus
[1:14:23] as he went, he will return like a man.
[1:14:27] Amen. Amen. And uh I told you yesterday
[1:14:30] that he has started returning
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:35] because we are not uh like the world who
[1:14:38] wait for rapture in the manner they wait
[1:14:40] for rapture. Amen. To us rapture is a
[1:14:43] process.
[1:14:45] And we already process.
[1:14:48] Amen. Amen. The Lord would suddenly
[1:14:51] descend with a shout. That's the
[1:14:54] promise. And we have the shout. Amen.
[1:14:58] And we understood that the shout wasn't
[1:15:00] the the first and the second pool. It
[1:15:04] was the third the reveal word that has
[1:15:08] brought in the bride of Christ. The
[1:15:10] first and the second pool brought all
[1:15:12] kind of congregation
[1:15:14] all manner of people because it was an
[1:15:17] attracting pool. Amen. But when you
[1:15:21] attracted you attracted for the purpose
[1:15:23] of being told something. Amen. So behind
[1:15:26] every sign there must be a voice. So the
[1:15:29] sign could gather everybody but the
[1:15:32] voice will separate
[1:15:34] those for whom it is meant among the
[1:15:37] crowd that is gathered. So that voice
[1:15:40] that is separating is a shout. Amen. And
[1:15:43] we said if you miss a shout in your day,
[1:15:46] you are not going to get the voice if
[1:15:49] you leave before he comes because he set
[1:15:52] the dead in Christ and Christ is the
[1:15:55] reveal word. Amen. The message of the
[1:15:58] hour. Hallelujah. That was why when
[1:16:02] those seven angels formed up there amen.
[1:16:06] Even the prophet didn't uh understand or
[1:16:10] understood the import of the picture,
[1:16:12] the photo he was holding until he was
[1:16:15] explaining all the circumstances around
[1:16:18] it in the church. And the spirit of the
[1:16:20] Lord said, "Turn it this way."
[1:16:23] Brother Brown said, "Only the Lord knows
[1:16:25] the right angle."
[1:16:29] And he turned it the way he was told to
[1:16:31] turn. And by the time he did, there was
[1:16:33] a visible face of Christ.
[1:16:36] And brother Graham said, "Oh, it was our
[1:16:39] Lord all of them." Hallelujah.
[1:16:43] So our Lord has started his descension,
[1:16:46] but ascending is a present continuous.
[1:16:49] So meaning he has not fully arrived but
[1:16:52] he's here with us. And brother Graham
[1:16:55] said the the fullness of his arrival
[1:16:58] will be his corporal body becoming
[1:17:00] visible. His feet will not touch this
[1:17:03] ground. Amen. But there will be a full
[1:17:07] appearance and he appears like a great
[1:17:10] magnet to magnetize those who have
[1:17:13] similar material. The only people that
[1:17:16] have similar material with him are those
[1:17:18] upon whom the shout has walked.
[1:17:21] He has worked upon the atoms of their
[1:17:24] bodies. He has questioned them in his
[1:17:26] likeness. So become of the same
[1:17:29] material. Word of his word, life of his
[1:17:33] life, power of his power. She is him.
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:40] Glory to God. So where are the we are
[1:17:44] those angels of the keeper told our
[1:17:47] sisters who came early morning today and
[1:17:50] uh they said who are you looking for? He
[1:17:53] said they are looking for Jesus of
[1:17:54] Nazareth. He said, "How can you be
[1:17:57] looking for the living
[1:17:59] among the dead?
[1:18:02] He is risen as a
[1:18:06] hallelujah. He is not here." So, but
[1:18:10] today we can say she is risen.
[1:18:14] She's not living among the dead again.
[1:18:18] She's no longer in the economy of this
[1:18:20] year. A dead ground.
[1:18:23] Hallelujah. That was what we tried to
[1:18:26] show you yesterday. That resurrection
[1:18:29] and rapture has its location. Amen.
[1:18:32] Amen. And I hope I prove it to you by
[1:18:35] the scripture. There was no
[1:18:37] resurrection. There was no rapture in
[1:18:39] Egypt. It all took place in Jerusalem.
[1:18:43] So because God has always localized that
[1:18:46] and there's a local spot where it will
[1:18:48] take place again today, not in La this
[1:18:51] year, but in the h of the bride.
[1:18:54] the economy of the reveal world. So if
[1:18:57] you are not him, come inside.
[1:19:00] You are cordially invited.
[1:19:03] Very cordly invited.
[1:19:06] Let's serve be the name of the Lord. Now
[1:19:09] in the message the prepare preparation
[1:19:13] uh
[1:19:15] 53-11
[1:19:17] 1111 paragraph uh 15 if they want to put
[1:19:21] it there.
[1:19:25] Uh the prophet was
[1:19:28] saying what I want to do tonight
[1:19:32] uh by God's help if you will help me is
[1:19:35] to speak his words to you that will
[1:19:38] prepare your heart for the evening
[1:19:40] service. Yes. He was using that message
[1:19:43] as a message of preparation for evening
[1:19:45] service. Amen. Uh there are messages
[1:19:49] that are targeted for certain things.
[1:19:52] Yes. Amen. Sometimes we want to have a
[1:19:55] healing service, there's a way we'll
[1:19:57] bring the message. Even Sunday morning
[1:19:59] messages, sometimes because we usually
[1:20:02] have mixed audience, there's a way we
[1:20:04] bring the message so that everybody can
[1:20:07] get something. Amen. That is just what
[1:20:09] he's saying. Amen. He said, but before
[1:20:13] God does anything, he always prepares
[1:20:17] for it.
[1:20:20] It is man that is always not prepared
[1:20:23] for the consequences of his action.
[1:20:28] But before God does anything,
[1:20:32] he anticipates all that the challenges
[1:20:35] that will come along the way. He looks
[1:20:38] at the end from the beginning. Then he
[1:20:43] gets himself ready. Yes. When man
[1:20:46] speaks, sometimes man is brought to take
[1:20:49] his word back
[1:20:52] because he speaks with the best of
[1:20:54] intention but with the best of knowledge
[1:20:57] of what he knew at that moment. Amen.
[1:21:01] But because he's a creator that learns
[1:21:04] every day. Amen. The moment he knows
[1:21:08] better, Amen. He will come back and say
[1:21:10] what I spoke yesterday needs correction
[1:21:14] or needs editing. Don't blame him. That
[1:21:18] is just man
[1:21:20] but that is what makes God different.
[1:21:22] Amen. When God speaks he cannot take it
[1:21:24] back
[1:21:26] because he speaks with the knowledge of
[1:21:29] the end right from the beginning.
[1:21:34] And sometimes man speaks without even
[1:21:36] thinking. Amen. True. And he's prone to
[1:21:40] take back his words. Amen. But that is
[1:21:43] not God. God cannot take back his words.
[1:21:48] So man is always not prepared for the
[1:21:50] consequences of his speech or the
[1:21:53] consequences of his action. If you look
[1:21:56] at Adam in in the beginning, when Adam
[1:21:59] fell, he wasn't prepared for the
[1:22:01] consequence of his falling.
[1:22:05] That was when the presence of the Lord
[1:22:07] came down.
[1:22:08] Adam couldn't wait for God. Whereas
[1:22:13] before then he was like the resident
[1:22:15] pastor on earth
[1:22:18] and God the invited or the big pastor.
[1:22:21] Amen. It makes everything ready for God
[1:22:24] to come and take over. But this
[1:22:26] particular day
[1:22:29] he wasn't in service. Even the
[1:22:32] congregation was not in service.
[1:22:35] God came. He waited all through the
[1:22:37] waiting period. He met nobody
[1:22:39] and he had to be looking for his
[1:22:41] congregation. Adam where and thou. Amen.
[1:22:44] When Adam realized that there was a
[1:22:46] problem, he invented an idea. He must
[1:22:50] have given comfort to all his members
[1:22:53] from the woman to all the creation said
[1:22:55] don't worry I I'll take care of it.
[1:22:57] Amen. That the Bible said he sold fig
[1:22:59] leaves and covered himself, covered the
[1:23:01] woman. But by the time the presence of
[1:23:04] God arrived, he found himself so
[1:23:07] inadequate
[1:23:09] and God had to be looking for him. So
[1:23:12] Adam wasn't prepared
[1:23:15] and man is always not prepared.
[1:23:20] Amen.
[1:23:21] That is why King David said, "Blessed is
[1:23:24] the man whom thou chooses." Amen. and
[1:23:27] cause it to approach unto thee. God must
[1:23:31] choose you and give you the ability to
[1:23:34] approach unto God.
[1:23:37] Amen. Because man is never prepared.
[1:23:39] Amen. Amen. But the God we serve is the
[1:23:43] God of preparation. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:23:46] The prophet said God does not do
[1:23:49] anything.
[1:23:51] Before he does a thing, he weighs it.
[1:23:54] Amen. And I think he wanted us to have
[1:23:56] such principles. Yes sir. That was why
[1:23:59] when he came in flesh he was telling you
[1:24:02] he said if you want to go to battle
[1:24:04] count the cost.
[1:24:06] Amen. If you want to build a house comes
[1:24:10] the cost. Amen. He said in building the
[1:24:12] house, if you don't count the cost and
[1:24:14] you just jump at it, you may end up
[1:24:17] creating a white elephant project,
[1:24:20] something that will never be finished
[1:24:22] and you become a tool of mockery. He
[1:24:24] said if you know if you want to go to a
[1:24:27] battle, he said prepare. And then if you
[1:24:30] know you don't have what it takes
[1:24:33] to confront the enemy, he said seek
[1:24:36] condition of peace. Amen. Those things
[1:24:38] were taught by the flesh. When you seek
[1:24:41] condition of peace, it doesn't make you
[1:24:43] a weakling, but it reveals that you're a
[1:24:46] person with wisdom. Hallelujah. That's
[1:24:48] right.
[1:24:50] Wonderful. And that is part of the
[1:24:52] preparation
[1:24:54] that you must have. Amen. So it said
[1:24:59] before we go to fight a war, he said
[1:25:02] before God does anything, he always
[1:25:05] prepares for it. Before we go to fight a
[1:25:10] war, first we have to prepare for that
[1:25:13] war.
[1:25:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:18] If you are going to get married, why you
[1:25:22] prepare for that time?
[1:25:26] The prophet is showing that everything
[1:25:28] in life needs a preparation. Amen. In
[1:25:31] the message choosing of a bride, he said
[1:25:34] you think, you plan, you pray and you
[1:25:38] pray true.
[1:25:41] When you are trying to make a choice of
[1:25:42] a woman, you have not even chosen. See
[1:25:45] the preparation level. He say you think,
[1:25:49] you pray, you plan and you break
[1:25:51] through. In making a choice. Amen. And
[1:25:56] you have to even think beyond marriage.
[1:25:59] Amen. Because apart from the spiritual
[1:26:02] requirements, there's also a
[1:26:03] psychological preparation. Amen. You
[1:26:06] say, "What are you saying?" I'm saying
[1:26:08] it from the spoken word. Amen. In the
[1:26:11] message running from the presence of the
[1:26:13] Lord, the prophet said, "We are always,
[1:26:17] it's always prone men to want to dodge
[1:26:19] responsibility."
[1:26:22] He said, "But parent is also a
[1:26:24] responsibility
[1:26:25] and you must prepare for it." Amen. Some
[1:26:29] of you like your wall sleek and
[1:26:31] beautiful, nice, white and fine.
[1:26:34] You must realize that God is going to
[1:26:36] bring some little little beautiful
[1:26:38] things.
[1:26:40] They call them wonderful creatures.
[1:26:43] You love to have them. When you don't
[1:26:45] have them, your chemistry is reversed.
[1:26:48] They are doing prayer requests for you
[1:26:50] night and day.
[1:26:52] But when they come, they come with their
[1:26:55] responsibilities. Yeah, they are going
[1:26:57] to look at your beautiful white walls
[1:26:59] and they are going to put their hand in
[1:27:01] some reddish thing one day and say if I
[1:27:04] could p the wall for my daddy the wall
[1:27:07] will look much more beautiful and they
[1:27:10] going to do it but you are going to look
[1:27:13] at it as something destroying
[1:27:16] and you must be careful not to beat or
[1:27:19] shout on them anyhow lest their guardian
[1:27:23] angel be annoyed with you. Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] That's right. Amen.
[1:27:28] Amen. That is your psychological
[1:27:30] preparation.
[1:27:33] So in everything he said you prepare for
[1:27:36] that time. Amen.
[1:27:39] You prepare for leadership.
[1:27:42] You prepare to be a servant of the Lord.
[1:27:45] Even when God calls you and the call to
[1:27:48] you has been witnessed. Amen. That you
[1:27:51] have the call of God in your life, you
[1:27:53] still prepare for it. Amen. You know
[1:27:55] why? Because behind every call is a
[1:27:58] timing.
[1:28:00] There is a how. There is a where. And
[1:28:03] there is a when.
[1:28:06] Those things must be certain to you.
[1:28:08] Otherwise, you will make a failure.
[1:28:15] Before you come to church, you also make
[1:28:17] preparations.
[1:28:19] Amen.
[1:28:21] What were what are your expectations
[1:28:23] when you are coming? The prophet said we
[1:28:25] must come with expectation.
[1:28:27] No matter how weak your expectation is,
[1:28:30] you must hold it very tight because you
[1:28:33] know why expectation is powered by
[1:28:36] faith. Hallelujah.
[1:28:40] Hallelujah. Even when your expectation
[1:28:42] is skewed, don't worry. God will arrange
[1:28:46] it. We have an advocate.
[1:28:49] But still have an expectation.
[1:28:50] Hallelujah. You remember the guy at the
[1:28:53] gate beautiful, the lady guy? Amen. His
[1:28:56] expectation was just to have few rents
[1:29:00] to take care of himself. Amen. He wasn't
[1:29:04] expecting a permanent solution. He
[1:29:06] wanted temporary relief. But because he
[1:29:10] was expecting anyhow. Amen.
[1:29:14] It is not what you expecting that God
[1:29:16] honors us all as the faith behind that
[1:29:19] expectation.
[1:29:21] When you have that faith that it is
[1:29:23] possible, hallelujah, something can take
[1:29:25] place.
[1:29:28] I hope you came with some today.
[1:29:33] So you can feel the virtue of God. Amen.
[1:29:37] All right. It said the ambulance to
[1:29:40] bring you maybe the sick ones or your
[1:29:42] loved ones to bring you. You had to get
[1:29:44] a certain amount of money ready before
[1:29:47] you could come. It's all preparation.
[1:29:51] And God always prepares the people for
[1:29:54] the events that's just about to happen.
[1:29:59] And church, I want you to know that
[1:30:01] there are events that are just about to
[1:30:03] happen. Amen. When we talk about the
[1:30:06] coming of the Lord, like I said, we
[1:30:09] don't expect the coming of the Lord like
[1:30:11] the world is expected. Amen. Before the
[1:30:15] Lord comes, the this earth, this world
[1:30:18] itself must come to a condition that
[1:30:21] makes the coming necessary.
[1:30:25] The kingdom of God cannot be established
[1:30:28] until the kingdom of the world
[1:30:29] collapses.
[1:30:32] There must be a collapse of a kingdom.
[1:30:35] to give way to another kingdom.
[1:30:39] There must be a collapse of the human
[1:30:42] structure to give way to a structure
[1:30:44] that is in collapsible.
[1:30:46] That is why the prophet said if you see
[1:30:48] a tree struggling to survive is to tell
[1:30:51] you that somewhere trees don't struggle.
[1:30:58] All right, let's go on a little bit
[1:30:59] more. He said, "May I stop right here
[1:31:02] just a minute and say I believe that the
[1:31:05] people are in the preparation of the
[1:31:08] last great destruction this world will
[1:31:11] ever know." I believe we are at the end.
[1:31:15] Amen. You can speak to people. You could
[1:31:19] put a Billy Graham in every city in the
[1:31:21] United States. They will drink whiskey
[1:31:24] and smoke cigarettes and laugh at you
[1:31:26] and everything else just the same. Amen.
[1:31:28] The gospel is meaning nothing to them.
[1:31:31] Amen. They are in the spirit of the last
[1:31:34] days. Now watch this. And God cannot
[1:31:37] send destruction before the people are
[1:31:40] in the spirit for destruction.
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:46] God never did destroy anything. Man
[1:31:49] always destroys himself.
[1:31:54] Yes sir. All these things must happen to
[1:31:57] invite the physical coming of the Lord.
[1:32:01] The world must be in a mode for
[1:32:03] destruction. Amen. The people must be in
[1:32:06] the spirit to be destroyed because it is
[1:32:10] man that will actually destroy himself
[1:32:13] in the judgment of the earth. God will
[1:32:16] be just.
[1:32:18] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So everything
[1:32:21] you are saying the moral bank bankruptcy
[1:32:24] the sodomy and whatever is happening
[1:32:27] it's putting the world in the mode for
[1:32:30] destruction
[1:32:36] conviction will be leaving the Gentiles
[1:32:39] and that conviction will be going back
[1:32:41] to the Jews.
[1:32:44] Amen. You know God does not deal with
[1:32:46] the Gentiles and the Jews at the same
[1:32:48] time.
[1:32:50] Amen. One must give way for the other.
[1:32:54] Amen. Blindness went to them in part
[1:32:58] so that we can have an opportunity.
[1:33:01] But I want to tell the church this
[1:33:03] morning that our opportunity is
[1:33:05] gradually fading
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:08] whether we like it or not. There will be
[1:33:11] an intervention
[1:33:13] soon. Very soon. How close we are, I
[1:33:16] don't know. But I know it is so close.
[1:33:20] And that is why conviction is leaving
[1:33:22] the Gentiles.
[1:33:27] They did a study. They did an
[1:33:28] observation study 2, three years ago,
[1:33:31] maybe getting to third year now. And
[1:33:33] they were saying uh you know they were
[1:33:36] trying to study what in what interest
[1:33:40] gentile young people more on the
[1:33:42] internet in such and they realize that
[1:33:46] there are things that promote morality
[1:33:49] such as pornography and all kind of vain
[1:33:53] things. But then they look beam their
[1:33:56] satellites to Israel and they realize
[1:33:59] that the young people are more
[1:34:01] interested in the idea of the coming
[1:34:03] Messiah.
[1:34:06] It's all over.
[1:34:08] Amen. So conviction is leaving the
[1:34:11] Gentiles and conviction is going back to
[1:34:14] the Jews. The gospel is has turned its
[1:34:17] full cycle and is returning back to
[1:34:20] where it originally came from. Amen. The
[1:34:23] days of redemption are here.
[1:34:27] Amen.
[1:34:28] Praise the Lord. That is why if you
[1:34:30] watch closely today, just this last
[1:34:33] month or January, uh tensions begin to
[1:34:37] rise again in Israel.
[1:34:39] Amen. Amen. Because the the these
[1:34:42] animals, the red ifas they were keeping
[1:34:45] uh that that they raised in Texas and
[1:34:48] now keeping in Israel about five of them
[1:34:51] has met perfectly every Bible
[1:34:54] specification
[1:34:57] of being red ephers. You understand?
[1:35:00] Because they are now 3 years old and all
[1:35:03] the features that qualify them as a red
[1:35:07] eer for sacrifice.
[1:35:09] Hallelujah. Has been met.
[1:35:12] Now today the Zionists are saying that
[1:35:15] they are taking that as a sign that
[1:35:17] their Messiah is ready to come.
[1:35:20] And before Messiah arrives, there must
[1:35:23] be a restoration of temple worship. And
[1:35:26] what is giving them the confidence that
[1:35:28] they are now ready to go back to the
[1:35:30] temple worship is the fact that what
[1:35:34] they need to cleanse the uh the vessels
[1:35:36] of the temple and its worshipper is
[1:35:39] ready
[1:35:41] because the red eers are animals that
[1:35:43] will be killed and burns and the ashes
[1:35:46] of the red eer will be used to clean all
[1:35:50] the vessels of the temple and also used
[1:35:54] to clean sprinkle on the worshippers.
[1:35:57] to prepare them for their temple
[1:35:59] worship. Now that is good.
[1:36:03] Hear me. That is good. If for nothing
[1:36:05] else that is giving an Israel a revival
[1:36:09] that they about receiving their desire.
[1:36:13] The Messiah is not coming to restore the
[1:36:15] whole sacrifice.
[1:36:17] Amen. The Messiah is not coming to uh
[1:36:21] restore the whole sacrifice of lambs and
[1:36:24] so forth. Amen. He's not coming to do
[1:36:26] that. The two messengers that are
[1:36:28] coming, they are coming to preach this
[1:36:30] same message of the hour.
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:34] Are you with me? To bring Israel back to
[1:36:37] the genuine atonement. Hallelujah. But
[1:36:41] that is good enough to call their
[1:36:43] attention
[1:36:45] and prepare them for that. Brother said,
[1:36:48] you know why the tension is rising is
[1:36:51] because if they are going to reestablish
[1:36:54] and restore their temple worship as they
[1:36:57] desire, there is one problem. And what
[1:37:00] is the problem? The problem is that
[1:37:02] there is something standing right on the
[1:37:06] spot where that temple worship will
[1:37:09] begin.
[1:37:11] Amen. And the scripture call it
[1:37:13] abomination that stands in the holy
[1:37:15] place. That's what the prophet said,
[1:37:18] right? And Israel said they are not
[1:37:21] going to take a compromise or a
[1:37:23] negotiation. They want the spot back
[1:37:27] because historically that was where the
[1:37:30] temple stood right from the time of
[1:37:32] Solomon till the time of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:35] And it should be their joy to have the
[1:37:37] temple back again on that spot. But for
[1:37:41] the temple to stand, there must be a
[1:37:43] destruction. Amen. That means there must
[1:37:45] be a destruction of that mosque of Oman
[1:37:48] and the mosque of Omah is the third
[1:37:51] holiest site for Islam all over the
[1:37:54] world. So Islam is warming up for
[1:37:57] tension. Israel is warming up for
[1:37:59] tension. The world is warming up for
[1:38:02] tension and Israel believe they will
[1:38:04] build it. Israel believe they will
[1:38:07] collapse them most. He said because
[1:38:09] their walls and temples have always been
[1:38:12] built at troubles time. They've always
[1:38:15] carried their bridge and water with one
[1:38:17] hand and weapon with
[1:38:20] another ready to do it one more time.
[1:38:28] [Applause]
[1:38:32] Now these things are going on brethren.
[1:38:34] Do you know why we should talk about
[1:38:36] them? Amen. Because the prophet said God
[1:38:38] never gave us a clock
[1:38:41] to watch for his coming but he gave us a
[1:38:44] time piece
[1:38:46] and he call it Israel among many other
[1:38:49] evening shadow signs that are happening
[1:38:52] in our day. These are the things to
[1:38:54] point to us that one of these days
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:01] that same love whom we are expecting
[1:39:03] will return. And we see it playing right
[1:39:06] in our eyes. Amen.
[1:39:09] America then elected a president. They
[1:39:11] call him Mr. Trump. And Mr. Trump sent
[1:39:15] his own before he came into power, he
[1:39:18] sent his own uh defense secretary
[1:39:20] designate
[1:39:22] to where to Israel. And when he got
[1:39:26] there, M the defense secretary begin to
[1:39:29] appreciate like a spiritual man.
[1:39:33] He began to appreciate and celebrate the
[1:39:36] coming to full maturity of the ready.
[1:39:39] They all on the net.
[1:39:41] And he said, well, we are expecting
[1:39:44] another miracle. He said, Israel had
[1:39:47] been associated with great miracles.
[1:39:49] Amen. He said 1946 to 1948 was a
[1:39:53] miracle. Amen. He said 196 that was when
[1:39:56] Israel was declared as a nation. He said
[1:39:59] 1967 6 day war was a miracle. Amen. He
[1:40:03] said another miracle happened under
[1:40:05] President Trump when he declared
[1:40:07] Jerusalem the capital of Israel. He said
[1:40:10] but we want more more miracle and it
[1:40:12] will be the miracle of the temple
[1:40:14] standing again.
[1:40:16] And he said this new government of
[1:40:18] America will give every support that is
[1:40:21] necessary to make it happen.
[1:40:27] These were men that were not Christians
[1:40:30] in the sense that you are Christians,
[1:40:33] but don't forget they will be used as
[1:40:35] tools
[1:40:37] to bring to pass the words of God. And
[1:40:40] scripturally speaking, they are servants
[1:40:42] of God
[1:40:44] because was a servant of God. Even God
[1:40:48] called Nebuchadnezzar my servant because
[1:40:51] he had an appointment. He had a service
[1:40:53] to do for the Lord. That's right. And
[1:40:55] these things are happening before our
[1:40:57] eyes.
[1:40:58] Men, great men are speaking and support
[1:41:02] is being given to the concept of the
[1:41:04] temple. Amen. Whether the temple will
[1:41:06] stand or not is not our business. But
[1:41:09] what our business is is that this thing
[1:41:12] is showing to us that if Israel is ready
[1:41:16] to receive the Messiah, then we are
[1:41:18] ready to live here.
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:23] Hallelujah.
[1:41:26] Do you know humanly speaking they've put
[1:41:29] a timeline
[1:41:31] to when their temple structure will
[1:41:34] begin.
[1:41:35] September, October this year is what
[1:41:37] they call it. They've put a timeline.
[1:41:40] Now the intriguing thing for you and I
[1:41:43] is that the prophet says the temple he
[1:41:46] said that mo of a man will stand till
[1:41:49] Jesus return. Amen. Is that right?
[1:41:52] Meaning that the temple and whatever
[1:41:55] they are going to do will be within the
[1:41:57] last bracket of the end of the 70 weeks
[1:42:00] of Daniel. Amen. Where the earth the
[1:42:03] gentile earth will go into the
[1:42:05] tribulation and where the gentile bride
[1:42:09] will will have gone in the for.
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:14] So could there be a possibility that
[1:42:16] this year we terminate offerings?
[1:42:20] I am not saying it will but when you see
[1:42:23] those things that are happening is a
[1:42:25] wake up call for the bride of Jesus
[1:42:28] Christ that our day of redemption
[1:42:33] is actually here
[1:42:36] Israel prepared to meet thy
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:45] the prophet said three things will
[1:42:48] happened after the opening of the seven
[1:42:53] seals. He said one the world will be in
[1:42:57] the sodom condition.
[1:42:59] I hope you remember that. He said two
[1:43:03] James and Jimus
[1:43:05] will arise.
[1:43:07] He said and three the son of man will be
[1:43:11] revealed.
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:15] Amen. Amen. And the prophet says, "There
[1:43:17] you have it again, your believer,
[1:43:21] your makebeliever and your unbeliever."
[1:43:26] Now, so don't look for all these folks
[1:43:28] outside.
[1:43:31] Look for them within the range of the
[1:43:33] message.
[1:43:35] Hallelujah. Because when the prophet was
[1:43:37] preaching the three kinds of believer,
[1:43:39] Yes. He said, "Even right in my church
[1:43:42] right now, I'm speaking to the three
[1:43:44] categories.
[1:43:46] It will be our desire that everybody is
[1:43:50] a believer. But don't forget light
[1:43:53] attracts all things
[1:43:56] because no life can thrive
[1:43:59] without light.
[1:44:05] There are be and jambers to discredit
[1:44:07] the message of the
[1:44:09] exodus.
[1:44:11] That's right. There will be the word
[1:44:13] going into their moral decay.
[1:44:16] And there will be a believer.
[1:44:18] Hallelujah.
[1:44:19] That is present towards their
[1:44:21] inheritance.
[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:23] And these three things are already
[1:44:25] happening.
[1:44:27] Because the opening of the seals release
[1:44:29] all these spirits. Since the light of
[1:44:32] God for the hour, it must attract every
[1:44:35] character in order to bring them to
[1:44:37] maturity.
[1:44:41] So the things that are happening around
[1:44:43] is not the problem. The clock is ticking
[1:44:46] right. Amen. Amen. But you must watch
[1:44:51] the side you belong.
[1:44:54] Who is on the Lord's side this morning?
[1:44:58] Hallelujah.
[1:45:00] Do not forget
[1:45:03] that James and Jim were actually
[1:45:05] Egyptians.
[1:45:07] Amen. But why were they attributed into
[1:45:10] the
[1:45:12] Exodus? They never left Egypt. They
[1:45:15] never came out of Egypt. But I tell you
[1:45:18] one thing, their effect moved out of
[1:45:21] Egypt.
[1:45:23] The prophet said they represents the
[1:45:25] generation that withstands the message
[1:45:27] of the Exodus. Yes, sir. Amen. Death and
[1:45:32] Coran and Haban walked by the spirit of
[1:45:35] James and James.
[1:45:37] And that was why throughout that journey
[1:45:39] they were in liability.
[1:45:44] There are characters that are
[1:45:45] liabilities.
[1:45:47] And what are they to do? They are to
[1:45:49] destroy the effect
[1:45:54] the influence of the Exodus message in
[1:45:58] the life of those who will not make it.
[1:46:03] James and James left Egypt. They crossed
[1:46:06] the Red Sea.
[1:46:08] They parttook in the mana. They drank
[1:46:11] water from the rock.
[1:46:14] Hallelujah. But as they progress in that
[1:46:17] journey,
[1:46:20] being politically minded or cannally
[1:46:22] minded, never spiritual,
[1:46:25] they could not bring themselves to
[1:46:27] accept the wholesomeness of the message.
[1:46:31] Yeah. Amen. When you see characters that
[1:46:34] are appealing to other books
[1:46:37] and not the spoken word books,
[1:46:40] I'm saying what I'm saying with a sense
[1:46:42] of responsibility. I'm building a
[1:46:44] platform and not the spoken word books.
[1:46:47] They are not preparing you for your
[1:46:50] inheritance.
[1:46:51] Hallelujah. You will perish in the
[1:46:54] wilderness. Hallelujah.
[1:46:57] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:46:59] Amen.
[1:47:02] You know why? There is going to come to
[1:47:04] a junction.
[1:47:06] Unfortunately for Dayton, Coran and
[1:47:09] Abber, they came to a junction. Whether
[1:47:12] they believe that message or not, they
[1:47:14] were tried by that message. Yes.
[1:47:18] Whether you believe the message or not,
[1:47:21] your judgment as far as this age is
[1:47:23] concerned.
[1:47:25] Oh, let me make it very clear is the
[1:47:28] message of the hour.
[1:47:31] Paul said people will realize and be
[1:47:33] judged by the message of my day.
[1:47:36] The message that he preached, we
[1:47:38] received the person in the m of Paul, in
[1:47:41] the m of Moses, people to whom the what
[1:47:44] age came unto your skepticism
[1:47:47] notwithstanding. You will be judged by
[1:47:50] this message.
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:57] Kora, Nathan, and they came and said,
[1:48:00] Moses, you take too much to yourself.
[1:48:03] Amen. Amen. If you think you are holy,
[1:48:05] the congregation is holier.
[1:48:09] When they preach that to you, they just
[1:48:11] trying to buy you. Amen. You will never
[1:48:15] live higher than this message.
[1:48:18] Take it from me. But prophet said, you
[1:48:21] won't live higher than your pastor
[1:48:22] teaches.
[1:48:24] True.
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:26] Oh man, that's true. So you will be
[1:48:29] confined to the level of his teaching.
[1:48:32] Amen. Not to talk of the message, the
[1:48:35] anointing for a generation, for a
[1:48:37] dispensation.
[1:48:39] You will never know better than this.
[1:48:42] Are you listening to me? When we say
[1:48:45] making more sense to it is not to take
[1:48:47] you out of the message.
[1:48:49] Is to bring the unfolding blessings that
[1:48:52] are in the message. God already
[1:48:55] corrected the prophet. There is nothing
[1:48:57] outside of the scriptures. Amen. He said
[1:49:01] what you call backside are the hidden
[1:49:03] truths that are in the scriptures
[1:49:07] and all those hidden truths have been
[1:49:09] brought they became a revelation to the
[1:49:12] bride. Amen. Though it has been revealed
[1:49:15] it must still be personally revealed to
[1:49:17] you.
[1:49:19] When when we can bring you with a grace
[1:49:21] to make you see what God has done that
[1:49:24] is you having more.
[1:49:27] Amen.
[1:49:30] That's right. So no preacher will make
[1:49:32] your reputation greater than the
[1:49:34] prophet.
[1:49:35] As far as this message is concerned, you
[1:49:38] are a time waster.
[1:49:40] [Applause]
[1:49:44] So
[1:49:45] coralant look the congregation. If you
[1:49:48] are holy, the congregation is holy. You
[1:49:51] take too much to yourselves. And you
[1:49:53] know where they took it from. Yeah.
[1:49:55] Sometimes people look at physical
[1:49:57] evidences that you can cause strong
[1:50:00] facts
[1:50:03] and they use it to build false thoughts.
[1:50:08] I'll tell you now when God, you know,
[1:50:12] wanted to make choices, he made Moses
[1:50:15] the prophet messenger. Then he made his
[1:50:18] own blood brother, the high priest. And
[1:50:20] the children of his blood brother, the
[1:50:23] continual priest. Amen. But they were
[1:50:25] not the only Levites. Amen. The Levite,
[1:50:28] you know, functions are divided into
[1:50:30] three. Those who bring the message,
[1:50:33] those who take care of music, and the
[1:50:35] priest who offers the sacrifices on
[1:50:38] behalf of the people. Now Dayton, Quran
[1:50:41] and Amir began to have an idea that this
[1:50:44] priesthood aspect is the is the most how
[1:50:48] do I put it is the richest is the most
[1:50:51] lucrative aspect of the Levitical
[1:50:54] ministry.
[1:50:56] And there are thoughts that that should
[1:50:58] go around. So why will God say Moses be
[1:51:02] the messenger and his brother be the
[1:51:04] priest? Are you seeing how can minded
[1:51:07] you can be? Yes.
[1:51:10] The sovereign God does what he wants.
[1:51:15] Amen. And they couldn't buy that aspect
[1:51:18] of the message. So Dean, Koram and Abber
[1:51:23] were those who believe the message.
[1:51:26] They have the ones they want and they
[1:51:29] reject the ones they don't want. So
[1:51:32] there is nothing new under the sun. If
[1:51:35] you yourself today, you are picking I
[1:51:38] agree with this one. I don't agree with
[1:51:40] this one. You have your family intact.
[1:51:44] You have your family life. The bride
[1:51:46] will be made with the totality of the
[1:51:49] word.
[1:51:50] The bride believes the word without
[1:51:53] question. Hallelujah. Can you hear me?
[1:51:56] Brother said, "What brings perfection to
[1:51:59] the seed of Abraham is a complete
[1:52:01] revelation of God."
[1:52:03] Amen.
[1:52:06] So don't glory in your skepticism.
[1:52:10] Amen. This thing came to climax for
[1:52:13] Kora, Nathan, and Abira. And they asked
[1:52:15] to challenge that openly.
[1:52:18] It's in your Bible. Numbers chapter 16.
[1:52:22] But Moses knew God spoke to him. Moses
[1:52:25] knew God gave him that message. So you
[1:52:28] know what he did? He said, "Well, this
[1:52:30] is what the Lord gave me." He said, "No,
[1:52:33] God can't give you salt." He said, "Then
[1:52:36] let God prove himself. You go do
[1:52:38] contrary to that message."
[1:52:41] Moses fought nobody. He only told them
[1:52:45] if you are convinced of your action, do
[1:52:47] contrary to that message.
[1:52:50] And I tell you, Dan, Coral and Abraham
[1:52:53] were both
[1:52:55] they did contrary to that message. The
[1:52:58] Bible said they went to carry incense.
[1:53:01] In sensor,
[1:53:03] Jan, Quran and Abber were not from the
[1:53:05] line of error. They were the ministers
[1:53:08] to the congregation. Moses warned them.
[1:53:11] He said, "The Lord has given you the
[1:53:13] right of preaching. You handle the word.
[1:53:16] You were even more eloquent than me."
[1:53:20] When they Quran and Abraham are
[1:53:22] preaching, Moses cannot stand them.
[1:53:25] Moses sound like a boring preacher. You
[1:53:27] know why? because it's
[1:53:30] before you finish a sentence maybe the
[1:53:32] congregation is sleeping or when Quran
[1:53:35] and takes the word and connect it from
[1:53:38] Genesis to revelation the church is
[1:53:41] jumping that is why the Bible said they
[1:53:43] are men of renown and that was why their
[1:53:46] influence was so strong to sway the
[1:53:49] people
[1:53:54] but that wasn't enough for them the
[1:53:57] Bible said they indeed actually carry
[1:53:59] sensor and put incense and came into the
[1:54:03] holy place and started waving it. My
[1:54:07] when they were waving it, God started
[1:54:10] pushing them. You know what? The smokes
[1:54:13] of their offering was rising up.
[1:54:17] Go and read your Bible. Amen. So to them
[1:54:20] that was a vindication.
[1:54:23] So they must have been telling Moses,
[1:54:24] "Look at yourself. see what is
[1:54:26] happening. But Moses knew the ground he
[1:54:30] was standing. He waited till they finish
[1:54:33] their drama.
[1:54:35] When they finish all their offerings,
[1:54:37] the only thing Moses said was, "Who is
[1:54:40] on the Lord's side?"
[1:54:42] And everybody was saying, "Amen. Push
[1:54:45] him. Push him." Uh and Quran and Abraham
[1:54:48] when they looked at the countenance of
[1:54:50] Moses, they told themselves, "Anytime
[1:54:52] pastor faces like this, something must
[1:54:55] happen." Amen. So you know what I will
[1:54:57] do for now? I will be on the Lord's
[1:54:59] side. If there's no problem, I will come
[1:55:01] back to your side, brother.
[1:55:04] Bro, for now, you were alone on this
[1:55:06] matter.
[1:55:08] Yes, sir. And those who on the Lord's
[1:55:10] side came to the side of Moses.
[1:55:13] Moses recommended to God the death he
[1:55:17] wanted Kora, Amir, and Dan to die. Read
[1:55:20] your Bible. He said if these men die the
[1:55:24] death of natural human beings then God
[1:55:27] has not called them. But if it shall be
[1:55:31] that the ground will open up and swallow
[1:55:34] them and all that they have then it will
[1:55:37] be established to them that nobody that
[1:55:41] is not of the stock of Aram has the
[1:55:44] right to carry sensor and offer in the
[1:55:47] presence of the Lord. And it happened
[1:55:50] exactly
[1:55:52] as Moses requested.
[1:55:56] Hallelujah.
[1:55:58] But watch
[1:56:00] this. After the event, Moses told them,
[1:56:03] you see the sensors that they
[1:56:06] use, go and take them and put them in
[1:56:10] the holy place. Moses said, because they
[1:56:12] are allowed.
[1:56:15] Meaning that whatever they offer
[1:56:16] actually went up. But where were the
[1:56:19] people who offered
[1:56:22] they were gone. That is why your
[1:56:25] vindication will be to understand that I
[1:56:28] am in the word of God. Amen. Don't even
[1:56:31] take results for vindication. The bride
[1:56:34] is rising out of that race.
[1:56:37] If you say results, there are many
[1:56:39] people who are not believers and will
[1:56:41] tell you we are having
[1:56:42] results. And they can give you evidences
[1:56:44] of results.
[1:56:46] But let your own vindication be that you
[1:56:49] are in the word. Hallelujah.
[1:56:52] [Applause]
[1:56:55] Why were those people there? To
[1:56:58] overthrow the faith of many and prevent
[1:57:01] them from coming into their inheritance.
[1:57:07] All these things will happen in our
[1:57:09] preparation. M and the prophet said if
[1:57:12] you were expecting the rapture when you
[1:57:15] hear him preach the message rapture he
[1:57:17] dealt with scoffers.
[1:57:20] Uh-huh. If you are familiar with that
[1:57:23] spoken word book without someone he
[1:57:26] dealt with scoffers a longer time before
[1:57:29] talking about the rapture because those
[1:57:32] are the things that will confront you on
[1:57:35] your road to meeting the king. He said
[1:57:38] Peter said that day of the Lord will not
[1:57:41] come until scoffers arise fresh.
[1:57:45] Amen. And he said these coffers are
[1:57:48] following the inspiration of that Kora
[1:57:51] and Habira to do what? To discredit
[1:57:55] the message of the Exodus. Amen.
[1:58:00] And he said, "One of the first things
[1:58:02] they did was to tell us that Israel did
[1:58:06] not actually pass through the Red Sea."
[1:58:10] Is a theory today. Amen. That they only
[1:58:14] pass through a bunch of re
[1:58:17] and when they started preaching it, some
[1:58:19] people started believing it. Amen. That
[1:58:22] was discrediting the article of
[1:58:24] redemption in the first Exodus. Amen. If
[1:58:27] you take the crossing of the Red Sea out
[1:58:30] of that Exodus, that Exodus made no
[1:58:32] sense because the prophet told us in the
[1:58:35] message, redemption by blood, redemption
[1:58:38] by power, redemption in completeness,
[1:58:41] three messages. He said redemption has
[1:58:44] two parts. Amen. The redemption part one
[1:58:48] is to save you by blood. Then is to
[1:58:52] redeem you by power. Then he said, "If
[1:58:54] he can save your soul, he can heal your
[1:58:58] body." And when you begin to enjoy these
[1:59:01] two aspects of redemption, redemption is
[1:59:03] coming to you in completeness.
[1:59:07] Hallelujah.
[1:59:09] God allowing them to go through the Red
[1:59:11] Sea is to offer Israel an opportunity to
[1:59:14] enjoy redemption by power.
[1:59:18] But people are coming today to say that
[1:59:20] there was nothing like that. and people
[1:59:23] are believing them.
[1:59:25] So that Exodus, first Exodus redemption
[1:59:28] was discredited.
[1:59:30] In the second exodus,
[1:59:33] they started preaching that Jesus was
[1:59:36] not actually virgin born.
[1:59:42] That it was a ruse. The prophet said the
[1:59:46] days it was first preached 500 ministers
[1:59:49] denounced
[1:59:51] their believer of virgin birth.
[1:59:54] And do you know from that many theories
[1:59:56] have been built that Jesus was is again
[1:59:59] was again that Jesus actually got
[2:00:01] married to Mary Magdalene and some
[2:00:04] people are doing excavations today to
[2:00:06] even tell you of the graves of Christ
[2:00:08] his wife and four children.
[2:00:12] Why are you not believing that?
[2:00:14] Do you have an evidence contrary to
[2:00:16] that?
[2:00:18] Because Jesus was vindicated.
[2:00:21] Are you with me? What was the devil
[2:00:24] doing? Discrediting the article of
[2:00:26] redemption in the second exodus.
[2:00:31] Are you going with me? Now you don't
[2:00:34] take offense. Now you are enjoying this.
[2:00:36] When I come to the third exodus, please
[2:00:38] enjoy it also
[2:00:42] because we on our journey to meet our
[2:00:44] king and we must not be ignorance of the
[2:00:47] devices
[2:00:49] of the evil one. If you take the virgin
[2:00:52] birth out of the second exodus, we are
[2:00:55] wasting our time here. It shows the
[2:00:57] blood we are claiming today as the blood
[2:01:00] of our redemption is a fake.
[2:01:04] It shows we have been deceived all
[2:01:05] along. But I tell you why is Easter?
[2:01:10] Because it was the blood of God.
[2:01:12] Hallelujah. That saved you and her.
[2:01:15] Jesus was not a human. Neither was he a
[2:01:20] and Jesus was not the egg of Mary.
[2:01:25] For a woman to release drop for
[2:01:28] fertilization, there must be a sensation
[2:01:31] and sensations comes by touch.
[2:01:36] If you call it Mary's egg, you are
[2:01:39] saying God had affair with Mary is not
[2:01:42] possible.
[2:01:46] The conception of Christ came from
[2:01:48] heaven. Hallelujah.
[2:01:52] It was like an IVF conception.
[2:01:54] Hallelujah.
[2:01:56] The egg and the jam was all was all
[2:01:59] conceived by God. And God looked for a
[2:02:02] surrogate mother. Hallelujah. Mary was
[2:02:06] actually a surrogate mother. A surrogate
[2:02:09] mother is a woman whose womb was
[2:02:12] borrowed for incubation of already
[2:02:15] conceived creatures.
[2:02:17] Amen. To help carry the baby to town.
[2:02:20] She had no contribution
[2:02:23] into the conception. That was who Mary
[2:02:26] was. And that was why it was difficult
[2:02:28] for our Lord to admit Mary as his
[2:02:31] mother.
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:34] Hallelujah.
[2:02:38] If that is not the case, we are wasting
[2:02:41] our time here. There is actually no,
[2:02:45] it's a ruse.
[2:02:48] But I thank God that is the case.
[2:02:55] Then James and Chambers moved into this
[2:02:58] exodus.
[2:03:00] Hallelujah.
[2:03:01] The third exodus. I hope you realize
[2:03:04] we're in another exodus.
[2:03:06] But this is the final one. That will
[2:03:09] bring the coming of the Lord. The first
[2:03:11] Exodus, God was calling a nation out of
[2:03:14] a nation. The second one he was bringing
[2:03:16] the church out of religion and this
[2:03:19] third one is bringing his bride out of
[2:03:21] the church.
[2:03:26] In this third one also. Amen. James and
[2:03:29] James came back to do what? To discredit
[2:03:33] this exodus. And by that they are
[2:03:35] telling us that seven angels never
[2:03:37] actually came down.
[2:03:42] Is that the ring of mystery?
[2:03:45] was just a smoke of an airplane. Quite
[2:03:48] blasphemous, isn't it? For some people
[2:03:50] are believing the theory today. Amen.
[2:03:54] And God has anticipated their thoughts
[2:03:57] when he spoke through the prophet and
[2:03:59] said that it was confirmed that no clue
[2:04:02] was in that ridge
[2:04:04] at the time of this event.
[2:04:07] Amen. Amen. When the smoke is emitted,
[2:04:12] even if it's emitted by by by a pipe
[2:04:16] that goes up, right, and is coming out,
[2:04:19] where does the smoke go? It comes down
[2:04:23] and evaporate.
[2:04:25] But this smoke went up
[2:04:28] and refused to evaporate and it stood
[2:04:31] there for how many minutes or hours and
[2:04:35] formed such a thick cloud. Amen. Are you
[2:04:38] seeing how senseless your theory is?
[2:04:45] What you call a smoke, even the National
[2:04:49] Space of America called a supernatural
[2:04:51] phenomenon.
[2:04:54] The bride does not even need to fight.
[2:04:57] Amen. It is the word of science against
[2:05:00] the unbelievers. Hallelujah. They call
[2:05:03] it a supernatural phenomenon that is
[2:05:06] hard for them to bring an understanding.
[2:05:08] Amen. Amen. And guess what? In the year
[2:05:12] this thing happened, plane don't fly
[2:05:14] that high. That's right. Go do yourself.
[2:05:18] Go do your research.
[2:05:22] God will always be ahead of the devil
[2:05:25] anytime.
[2:05:26] Planes fly as high as 40,000 44,000
[2:05:30] 45,000 ft today. By technology
[2:05:33] advancement they can actually go to
[2:05:35] 80,000 ft. But they run the risk of
[2:05:38] crash of loss of wealth and many things.
[2:05:42] So by rule of law they confine them to
[2:05:45] 45,000 ft maximum. But I called you to
[2:05:48] check they don't do more than 18,000 ft.
[2:05:51] They were low flyings there. Are you
[2:05:54] still with me? But let's see what
[2:05:56] happened. 30 m wide and 26 m wide. Okay.
[2:06:02] 26 m high and 30 m wide across. Is that
[2:06:05] right? When you calculate 26 miles high,
[2:06:09] it's over 120,000 ft.
[2:06:14] So that platform
[2:06:17] at an altitude where planes still don't
[2:06:20] fly to today.
[2:06:25] So you are going to tell me the smoke
[2:06:27] that rose as much as 80,000 ft to settle
[2:06:35] how dull can human beings be
[2:06:39] and the scriptural since you are not
[2:06:41] ready to retain God in your knowledge
[2:06:44] the Bible said God will give them over
[2:06:46] to a reprobate man to believe what a lie
[2:06:51] and be damned by
[2:06:58] If you take that out of the third
[2:07:01] Exodus, redemption doesn't make sense
[2:07:05] because that was where the prophet got
[2:07:08] the commission
[2:07:10] to open the seals. The shout message
[2:07:14] that prepares you for the rapture. As a
[2:07:16] matter of fact, the first stage of the
[2:07:19] rapture. Amen.
[2:07:21] So if you deny there's no rapture to the
[2:07:24] believer
[2:07:26] and if there's no rapture, no
[2:07:28] resurrection to the saints who have gone
[2:07:30] home because this was our message of
[2:07:33] preparedness.
[2:07:36] Before the commission, what we had was
[2:07:38] signed in the end, an ability to tell
[2:07:41] the secret of the earth which gathered
[2:07:43] all kinds of people. But from among
[2:07:46] those crowds, the elect must be picked
[2:07:48] out. The only thing that can pick the
[2:07:51] elect out is the open words, the
[2:07:54] revealed word. That is the only thing
[2:07:56] that took you out of love this year and
[2:07:59] has brought you into the economy where
[2:08:01] rapture is possible.
[2:08:03] [Applause]
[2:08:07] [Music]
[2:08:09] So on your road to meeting the coming
[2:08:11] king, scoffers must rise.
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:19] But a predestinated bride is determined.
[2:08:25] Nothing will take your attention than
[2:08:28] the word of the Lord. We are the Elijah
[2:08:31] group.
[2:08:33] No matter the destruction,
[2:08:35] we are looking.
[2:08:37] There is a great blessing in keeping
[2:08:40] your eyes on the promise.
[2:08:44] Did you hear me? Don't allow anything to
[2:08:48] turn your attention away from the
[2:08:51] promise. Our Lord will return to this
[2:08:53] earth. For who?
[2:08:57] For those who are looking forward to his
[2:09:00] appearance. The Bible said unto them he
[2:09:03] shall appear. One more time.
[2:09:08] [Applause]
[2:09:10] The schools of the prophet will be
[2:09:12] there.
[2:09:13] Amen. Who by the feel of the moment will
[2:09:16] have an idea that something should be
[2:09:19] taking place but don't stay in their
[2:09:21] camp. Cross over Jordan.
[2:09:25] Hallelujah. Because Canaan bear land is
[2:09:28] after Jordan. Cross over Jordan. Don't
[2:09:31] settle for this.
[2:09:36] After you cross, there's one more
[2:09:37] requirement. Looking requirement.
[2:09:42] Did you hear me? Looking requirements.
[2:09:47] Elijah asked Elisha, "You've been
[2:09:49] faithful this far." All right. Now he
[2:09:52] call that. You've been faithful this
[2:09:54] far. What do you want me to do for you?
[2:09:59] Elijah didn't mean words. He had
[2:10:02] followed long enough. Amen. To know what
[2:10:05] it takes to meet the challenge of the
[2:10:09] hour. Amen. He said I want double
[2:10:12] portion.
[2:10:14] He said that power that said by my word
[2:10:17] there will be no rain. There will be no
[2:10:19] due until I call for it. I want two of
[2:10:23] that power.
[2:10:25] Say ah. He said yes sir that's what I
[2:10:27] want. You ask me. You gave me a blanket.
[2:10:31] You've never limited me. You say I
[2:10:34] should ask what I want. Can you ask for
[2:10:36] big things?
[2:10:39] And you see before Elijah himself could
[2:10:44] get into such a mode he was prepared.
[2:10:47] Amen. You saw his picture appeared in
[2:10:50] first kings chapter 17 as if that was
[2:10:52] where his story began. No sir. The
[2:10:55] prophet came back to tell us that for a
[2:10:57] man to say by my word.
[2:11:00] Remember he was not praying. Oh God let
[2:11:03] there be no rain.
[2:11:05] He said, "By my word." And he didn't
[2:11:08] even say God saved the Lord.
[2:11:13] Did you realize that? He said by my own
[2:11:16] word.
[2:11:17] I like it when the Bible describe it
[2:11:19] like this. He said those who in the days
[2:11:22] of their prophecy have the power. They
[2:11:25] don't even ask God for the power. They
[2:11:27] don't say God do on my behalf. They have
[2:11:30] the power
[2:11:32] to shut the heavens that it rain not a
[2:11:37] church is going to have the power.
[2:11:41] Hallelujah.
[2:11:44] Brother Brown said for
[2:11:46] Elijah to be able to say that it shows
[2:11:50] that he has been somewhere. Amen. He has
[2:11:53] lived so long in the presence of God
[2:11:56] until the messenger has become his own
[2:11:58] messenger.
[2:12:00] Glory. Hallelujah. He doesn't have to
[2:12:02] quote again. He is the messenger.
[2:12:06] He said by my word. Isn't that the
[2:12:09] reason we are sitting here? To lay in
[2:12:11] the presence of the soul.
[2:12:14] Oh my take out all our cleavage or to
[2:12:19] become my wash and become the bread of
[2:12:22] life on God's table.
[2:12:27] Amen. This is why we are here friends.
[2:12:30] Hallelujah. This is what the word is
[2:12:32] doing to us. Amen. And I tell you, let
[2:12:35] me tell you, every time you come into
[2:12:37] service, you are packing virtues.
[2:12:41] You just don't realize it. You are
[2:12:43] actually never the same. You cannot stay
[2:12:47] under this pure review world.
[2:12:50] You cannot say amen to it. You cannot
[2:12:53] accept it and not have a change. Even if
[2:12:57] it's a plane of change, but there is
[2:13:00] something already taking place in your
[2:13:04] life.
[2:13:11] This is not the voice of the man. It is
[2:13:13] the message of the house. It is the word
[2:13:16] of God. It is the man of glory.
[2:13:21] You cannot stay under it.
[2:13:26] [Music]
[2:13:28] You said, "Pastor, I don't realize I'm
[2:13:30] having a dream." You wait for it. You
[2:13:33] wait for it. You think you know
[2:13:34] yourself. You don't know yourself here.
[2:13:37] I say you don't know yourself. You don't
[2:13:40] know what is in you. You don't know what
[2:13:42] you are. But one of these days,
[2:13:46] something is going to
[2:13:49] promote. As you wait for the coming of
[2:13:51] the Lord, there is going to be an
[2:13:54] opportunity to display who you are.
[2:14:04] Don't worry. Don't worry. God knows what
[2:14:07] is going. Let me give you an example.
[2:14:11] Sometimes the Lord who knoweth your
[2:14:13] friend, who knoweth who you are, will
[2:14:16] throw certain challenges in your way.
[2:14:20] And you will tell yourself, I cannot
[2:14:22] handle this. Amen. But do you know the
[2:14:25] scripture said part of God's
[2:14:27] faithfulness,
[2:14:28] faithful characteristics, is that they
[2:14:31] cannot give you a temptation or a
[2:14:34] challenge
[2:14:36] upon what you can bear.
[2:14:40] Now the thing that came your way look
[2:14:43] too much for you. But the one who
[2:14:46] allowed it, he knew he has expressed
[2:14:48] something in you.
[2:14:51] Then ask yourself this morning, ask
[2:14:54] yourself this morning, how did you come
[2:14:56] out? The challenge is gone, but you are
[2:14:59] still standing. The problem is over, you
[2:15:03] are still standing. The one who created
[2:15:06] you what he has put inside of you.
[2:15:13] God, that same God, I said he's working
[2:15:17] upon you. Yes. filled in virtue.
[2:15:21] Brother, look away to Jesus. He began to
[2:15:25] tell us of a tough time that is going to
[2:15:29] come upon the church as we wait for the
[2:15:31] coming of the Lord. Amen. Israel
[2:15:34] prepared to be the king.
[2:15:37] He began to tell us. He said, "There's
[2:15:40] going to be a time of trouble." Amen.
[2:15:43] Jacob's trouble.
[2:15:46] Amen. He said the world is going to have
[2:15:48] it. He said but the bride is also going
[2:15:51] to take their portion
[2:15:53] and in taking this portion he call it
[2:15:56] the squeeze
[2:15:58] and in another place he use the word
[2:16:00] pressure
[2:16:02] and it's just very simple.
[2:16:04] If you want to get a juice out of an
[2:16:07] orange two methods manually you squeeze
[2:16:12] mechanically you press.
[2:16:15] Is that all right? But what is important
[2:16:18] is that juice will come out. Hallelujah.
[2:16:24] Or pressing is to have juice. That juice
[2:16:27] is what you are taking time to pack now.
[2:16:31] Hallelujah. God is packing you juices
[2:16:34] now. So that when they squeeze down, you
[2:16:38] will have something to release
[2:16:41] because there will be a release.
[2:16:43] There'll be a quick short one. There
[2:16:45] will be a
[2:16:46] demonstration. This king must wear his
[2:16:49] bride before this generation before he
[2:16:52] takes you away. Is part of the package
[2:16:55] of the coming of the Lord.
[2:17:06] Amen. And then he told us he said he
[2:17:10] said the the antichrist will tighten up.
[2:17:14] Amen. Amen. Whether your church have
[2:17:16] name or no sign board or nothing, it
[2:17:18] doesn't matter. You already marked. We
[2:17:21] are not marked by sign board. We are
[2:17:24] marked by our belief
[2:17:26] by our faith. Amen. Amen. Amen. In the
[2:17:30] Bible, he was telling King Gazeros,
[2:17:33] he said there are people in this your
[2:17:35] country whose beliefs.
[2:17:38] Haven't you read it in your Bible? whose
[2:17:40] values whose diamonds is different from
[2:17:44] other people and it was describing you
[2:17:47] and I the prophet said we are the one
[2:17:50] who believe odd things yeah and by our
[2:17:53] hotness of belief we are marked
[2:17:58] and they are going to bring pressure
[2:17:59] upon us the pressure will come in
[2:18:02] bringing legislations that are contrary
[2:18:05] to our values
[2:18:08] one of these days we shall be lawb
[2:18:09] breakakers
[2:18:11] I will be happy to break the law.
[2:18:13] Hallelujah.
[2:18:14] No conflict with our values and we break
[2:18:18] it.
[2:18:20] Yes sir. And no matter how tough you you
[2:18:24] pressured us till our time come, you
[2:18:26] will do nothing.
[2:18:28] Yes. Yes sir.
[2:18:31] Hallelujah. That's right. If you want to
[2:18:33] remain simple, you won't be a Christian.
[2:18:35] That's right. That's right. will remain
[2:18:38] civil as as long as civility is broken.
[2:18:42] Is it what's your scripture for that?
[2:18:44] Too many scriptures for that.
[2:18:47] What makes the three Hebrew children a
[2:18:49] memorial today? They broke the law.
[2:18:54] Hallelujah.
[2:18:57] What gives them eternal memorial today?
[2:19:00] They broke the law. Why are you giving
[2:19:02] your children Daniel today? He broke the
[2:19:04] law.
[2:19:09] And we shall break the law that is
[2:19:12] contrary to the law. Hallelujah.
[2:19:17] Yes sir. If you are not ready to carry
[2:19:19] your cross, you are not ready to follow
[2:19:21] Christ. The measure of it is left for
[2:19:24] everybody.
[2:19:29] As long as the law is not contrary to
[2:19:31] the word of God, we are the most s.
[2:19:35] That's right. That's right. I get it
[2:19:37] very clear. That's correct. For when it
[2:19:39] conflict with the word of God, right? We
[2:19:42] will damn your law, you will uphold the
[2:19:45] world.
[2:19:47] Because even the enemy testified about
[2:19:50] us. Do you know why they made the law
[2:19:52] against that name? These guys have been
[2:19:55] trying him in so many ways. They tried
[2:19:58] to keep me with him. It didn't work.
[2:20:01] When they sh him, he will call them
[2:20:02] brother. It's you I'm greeting. God
[2:20:04] bless you.
[2:20:09] When they did everything, Daniel lived
[2:20:12] such a life that frustrated the enemy.
[2:20:16] Yeah.
[2:20:18] Daniel never went on the drawing board
[2:20:20] for one day. It was always them that
[2:20:22] goes back to the strategize.
[2:20:26] Yes, sir. Oh, hallelujah. That's right.
[2:20:28] Then one day they told themselves look
[2:20:30] if we continue like this we won't get
[2:20:33] this man he's too Christianly to be
[2:20:37] corrupted
[2:20:39] then one say you know how to get him let
[2:20:42] us try him by the law of his God
[2:20:46] don't read your Bible is there what were
[2:20:49] they testifying to they knew that Daniel
[2:20:52] will never break the law of his god so
[2:20:56] what the enemy was to go and study the
[2:20:59] law of the God of Daniel not for
[2:21:01] conversion
[2:21:03] but to get something to oppose Daniel.
[2:21:06] You see that why they are stopping the
[2:21:08] message.
[2:21:12] They are not studying it for their own
[2:21:14] salvation
[2:21:16] but to good
[2:21:18] against you and I. So be ready for it.
[2:21:22] It's part of the package of the coming
[2:21:24] of the Lord.
[2:21:28] [Applause]
[2:21:30] And when they studied enough, they said,
[2:21:31] "This is enough." Said, "Thou shall have
[2:21:34] no other god." This is not getting king.
[2:21:38] You are the most successful king we ever
[2:21:40] knew. That's right. We just want to make
[2:21:42] you a god for one month. Nobody should
[2:21:45] pray or bow or worship any other person
[2:21:48] than you. All those lords has only one
[2:21:51] aim. Have only one aim than him.
[2:21:55] Amen. You are the holy him of the devil
[2:21:58] whether you like it or not.
[2:22:01] And they will bring things that will
[2:22:03] bring you under pressure
[2:22:06] that will really give you a squeeze. The
[2:22:08] prophet said many will give in thinking
[2:22:11] that it is better to serve God under the
[2:22:13] framework of an antichrist than not to
[2:22:16] serve God at all. You are deceived.
[2:22:19] There is no service to God using the
[2:22:22] scheme of the antichrist. Yeah.
[2:22:28] And when you refuse to give in, you know
[2:22:29] what will happen?
[2:22:31] Fellowshipping like this will be
[2:22:33] attacked.
[2:22:35] Didn't the prophet said our churches
[2:22:37] will be closed down and turn to
[2:22:39] storehouses for weapons. You see why we
[2:22:43] need to treasure this moment when we
[2:22:46] still have ability of fellowship and
[2:22:48] freedom of fellowship. Let us gather
[2:22:51] everything. That is why the prophet said
[2:22:53] accumulate everything you can when you
[2:22:57] can because there's coming a time that
[2:23:00] you will need every bit of it and it
[2:23:03] will not be available. Our persecution
[2:23:05] is coming from the church not from an
[2:23:09] [Music]
[2:23:12] outer s.
[2:23:14] But let me say it again. You have
[2:23:16] nothing to worry about. Amen. As long as
[2:23:19] you are giving yourself to this word, as
[2:23:24] long as you are accepting it, God is
[2:23:26] backing Jesus.
[2:23:29] God is fortifying you and preparing you
[2:23:32] for that hour. That is why in the
[2:23:35] message look away to Jesus. He said,
[2:23:37] I've taken time to explain all these
[2:23:39] things so that you will know how to
[2:23:41] stand and what to watch out for. We
[2:23:45] don't watch out for God's coming like
[2:23:47] the people of the world. We watch out
[2:23:49] for the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[2:23:53] By the way,
[2:23:57] Hallelujah. I say it's in you. Amen. I
[2:24:00] say it's in you. You just don't realize
[2:24:03] it. Hallelujah. If I tell you if this
[2:24:05] was a
[2:24:07] wall and I tell you jump over this wall,
[2:24:12] you will say why are you trying to
[2:24:13] embarrass me? You can jump this side. Is
[2:24:16] that right? Amen. Now, and I said look,
[2:24:18] it's in you to do it. You can do it. He
[2:24:21] said, "No, I don't believe I can do it.
[2:24:22] I don't believe I can do. I don't
[2:24:24] believe I can do it." And I will tell
[2:24:26] you, look, you don't believe you can do
[2:24:28] it because nothing has provoked it in
[2:24:32] you. If something provoke it, you will
[2:24:35] jump over that wall and you'll be
[2:24:37] wondering how
[2:24:40] because it is you. Then you say, "What
[2:24:43] do you mean?" I said, "Let's lock
[2:24:45] everywhere and let's open here." And 12
[2:24:49] lions suddenly appear.
[2:24:53] You already know the answer. Even
[2:24:56] without seeing the lion, you already
[2:24:58] believe you can do it. Are you saying it
[2:25:01] now?
[2:25:03] The squeeze, the pressure will provoke
[2:25:07] you and you will realize that your days
[2:25:11] in the presence of the Lord has not been
[2:25:13] away from
[2:25:22] But in case you are not sure,
[2:25:26] let me offer you help.
[2:25:28] Be like Jacob. Amen. Don't assume.
[2:25:34] God told Jacob when he was with Lava
[2:25:38] that it is ongoing time.
[2:25:42] Is that right? Jacob was too busy like
[2:25:46] many of us. We get too busy. We don't
[2:25:49] mind fellowship. But God spoke to Jacob.
[2:25:52] It's ongoing time. Amen. When a man
[2:25:56] attempt to leave,
[2:25:58] lover dangle some carrots before him.
[2:26:04] Sometimes you decide this job that is
[2:26:06] taking my fellowship and everything, I
[2:26:08] got to do something about it. And you
[2:26:11] rise one day, you went to reside.
[2:26:14] I'll look for something else because my
[2:26:16] soul is important.
[2:26:18] How many times
[2:26:21] that is when the company will say
[2:26:26] let's say you I don't know how much your
[2:26:27] money is let's say you have 20,000 rand
[2:26:30] that is when they will give you 35,000
[2:26:34] you said maybe it's the will of God for
[2:26:41] because why at this time
[2:26:44] why at this time God must be telling me
[2:26:47] something
[2:26:49] sometimes Satan also knows how to tell
[2:26:51] you something
[2:26:54] because he would rather keep you weak in
[2:26:56] the spirit
[2:26:58] and are strong in your economy. You
[2:27:01] won't be a problem to his kingdom. It
[2:27:03] will not be a
[2:27:04] tra. So Laban came to Jacob and offered
[2:27:08] him more and Jacob changed his mind
[2:27:12] about going
[2:27:14] and by the more he was offered because
[2:27:16] he became like the managing director and
[2:27:19] everything. Jacob became too busy to
[2:27:21] pick the calls of God.
[2:27:24] God will call him. Excuse me. I'm in the
[2:27:26] board meeting now. I'll call you back.
[2:27:29] [Music]
[2:27:31] He will not call. Some of you are like
[2:27:32] that. He will not call back. God will
[2:27:35] look I said this boy that said he will
[2:27:37] call me back it's been two weeks never
[2:27:40] call back and God will pick the call
[2:27:44] again said oh God I'm just about signing
[2:27:49] 10 million rand project let me conclude
[2:27:53] it in in less than 5 minutes I'll call
[2:27:55] you back 5 months never call back but
[2:27:58] let me tell you something if you are a
[2:28:00] seed of God
[2:28:02] God knows how to get you attention
[2:28:04] hallelujah
[2:28:06] You will get it
[2:28:08] no matter how hard out you run. That's
[2:28:11] right. For his presence, he's just
[2:28:13] giving you patience. When he's ready for
[2:28:16] you, he will hold you like this and yes,
[2:28:19] he won't kill you. He will bring so much
[2:28:22] discomfort, but you will get home.
[2:28:26] Hallelujah.
[2:28:30] If you are like that this morning, I'm
[2:28:32] offering you easy access. Amen.
[2:28:35] Back to Christ.
[2:28:37] But if you don't accept my offer, God
[2:28:40] will take it further. You know why? If
[2:28:42] you are a seed of God, God can never
[2:28:46] lose you.
[2:28:47] [Applause]
[2:28:49] And you know why he can never lose you?
[2:28:51] Because he already offered the
[2:28:53] thanksgiving.
[2:28:55] He said, "Father, I thank you that all
[2:28:58] you gave me, I lose except the son of
[2:29:02] provision. Yeah. So Christ couldn't
[2:29:05] attend a thanksgiving on your life and
[2:29:09] with his thanksgiving. It's not
[2:29:11] possible. Whatever it will take,
[2:29:14] listen to me. He has to put you on the
[2:29:17] bed of affliction. He will do it and yet
[2:29:21] you will not die because that wasn't his
[2:29:23] intention. His intention is to bring you
[2:29:26] back.
[2:29:28] That's right.
[2:29:30] Praise God. Let me tell you, is God no
[2:29:33] replacement for any of his children?
[2:29:38] It is you that must sit here and it must
[2:29:41] be you.
[2:29:44] That is the gospel. When Moses failed,
[2:29:47] the job waited till he was perfected for
[2:29:51] the job and came back. He didn't ask God
[2:29:54] anything. Yes. Uh-huh. Amen. Because God
[2:29:58] does not change his mind. It original
[2:30:02] thought remains his only thought.
[2:30:06] Yes sir.
[2:30:08] So if he thought of you to do a thing,
[2:30:10] you must do it. Whether you like it or
[2:30:14] not.
[2:30:15] [Applause]
[2:30:17] Are you with me? So the earlier you
[2:30:20] surrender, the better it is for your
[2:30:21] life because the will of the Lord will
[2:30:24] be done regardless.
[2:30:28] It is the council of God that shall
[2:30:30] stand. So run away son, run away
[2:30:33] daughter. You better come back this
[2:30:34] morning.
[2:30:36] Your father is offering you a
[2:30:39] mouthwatering package. Easy access. If
[2:30:42] you reject easy access, you will still
[2:30:44] come anyhow. By a tough access.
[2:30:48] God will have his way.
[2:30:53] So when God was ready for Jacob,
[2:30:55] friends, you know what he did? All those
[2:30:58] things that constituted value and uh
[2:31:01] appreciation, God turned it around. Read
[2:31:04] your Bible. I think Genesis 31 or 30.
[2:31:08] Laban that made him managing director
[2:31:10] turned against him. All the sons of
[2:31:12] Laban who were on the board turned
[2:31:14] against him. When Jacob looked there, it
[2:31:17] was hostility. When he looked there, it
[2:31:19] was hostility. When there was nowhere to
[2:31:22] turn, he looked away.
[2:31:24] [Applause]
[2:31:26] And God said, "Look at you now. Look at
[2:31:29] you now. You've not been picking my
[2:31:32] course. Now you are calling me. What if
[2:31:34] I don't pick your own?"
[2:31:37] But it's a merciful God. The Bible said
[2:31:40] he will not always charge. Neither will
[2:31:43] he keep his anger forever. Amen. And it
[2:31:45] won't take you know what I was the cause
[2:31:48] of all your problem. I did it to get
[2:31:51] your attention and all I wanted to tell
[2:31:53] you is ongoing time. Hallelujah.
[2:31:56] Church, it's ongoing time.
[2:32:01] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:32:04] And it was a great revival. Jacob said
[2:32:07] told his wife, told his children, "We
[2:32:09] going home. We going home." Everybody
[2:32:11] started singing, "We are going home. We
[2:32:13] are going as they were joined rejoicing
[2:32:16] having revival. Esau
[2:32:19] at the noise of the revival.
[2:32:22] You will love this on your way to the
[2:32:25] rapture.
[2:32:28] Those are the birthright losers.
[2:32:31] That is the antichrist regime.
[2:32:34] They must come your way. It has run
[2:32:37] through the types of the scripture. You
[2:32:40] don't get into your inheritance
[2:32:42] without a fight.
[2:32:45] The reinforces are already there, but
[2:32:48] you must announce it. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:32:53] So the Bible said Esau was warming up to
[2:32:56] meet him. You want to come on, you deal
[2:32:59] with me first.
[2:33:01] When Jacob added that Esau was on the
[2:33:04] way, that revival became
[2:33:07] sober. Amen.
[2:33:11] So, so this problem is still there.
[2:33:15] Oh, for the birthight now for the
[2:33:17] porridge. Oh, for this and that. What
[2:33:19] must I do? Do you know up till that time
[2:33:23] Jacob has survived by tricks?
[2:33:27] A lot of you are surviving by tricks and
[2:33:29] you think you are smart.
[2:33:32] You live your dirty lives. You come to
[2:33:34] the church with clean mouth. You think
[2:33:35] you are smart. Hey, hey, forgive me. You
[2:33:39] are the You know why? How would you ever
[2:33:42] think that God is not seeing what you
[2:33:44] are doing?
[2:33:47] How would you ever think
[2:33:49] that the presence of God does not always
[2:33:52] go with you, the man who enters all
[2:33:54] rooms, the doors being shut,
[2:33:58] whether you invite him or not, he will
[2:34:00] come.
[2:34:02] So stop playing dirty games.
[2:34:06] Hallelujah.
[2:34:08] Amen. From today dirty life say God is
[2:34:12] watching me. I'm conscious of his
[2:34:14] presence. How many do that? How many
[2:34:18] from today? Whether pastor is there or
[2:34:21] not. Whether mama is there or not.
[2:34:23] Whether papa is there or not. There's an
[2:34:25] allse
[2:34:27] watching you.
[2:34:32] [Applause]
[2:34:34] Hallelujah. Now the hen is coming on to
[2:34:37] rose. Amen. Because Esau was on the way
[2:34:41] coming with strong army to confront
[2:34:44] Jacob
[2:34:46] and settle the whole score for the last
[2:34:48] time. Hallelujah. The Bible said Jacob
[2:34:52] talk of what to do. What must I do?
[2:34:55] If Esau could fall for a plate of
[2:34:58] courage, if I send him about 400 cattle,
[2:35:03] something per degree, it will collapse.
[2:35:06] The Bible said Jacob sent the cattle.
[2:35:09] When saw them, he said, "What is this
[2:35:13] one? I have plenty."
[2:35:16] Esau had overgrown covetousness. He was
[2:35:19] a wealthy man himself. So, you couldn't
[2:35:21] move him with that. So the trick failed
[2:35:28] and Jacob said what must I do again? All
[2:35:31] right. Okay. If push come to shove let
[2:35:35] me arrange the family in the order of
[2:35:39] importance
[2:35:42] because some people site chicks today.
[2:35:45] They have no value.
[2:35:47] Do you know the concubines were the
[2:35:49] first one that were rich with their
[2:35:50] children. Yes. Read your Bible. It was
[2:35:54] Bill and Villa, her children first that
[2:35:56] Jacob arranged first. So if what comes,
[2:35:59] let him catch them first before it got
[2:36:02] to.
[2:36:04] Then they put Leah and his and her
[2:36:06] children number three. Then they put
[2:36:08] Rachel and her son the last person. So
[2:36:12] it was in the order of importance to
[2:36:14] him.
[2:36:19] And uh but when he realized what if I
[2:36:25] say he won't kill them all and he wiped
[2:36:29] out everything.
[2:36:31] Then Jacob said,
[2:36:32] "No, let me go and check if I've got
[2:36:36] what it takes." Amen. To confront my
[2:36:40] issue. Amen. This is your own personal
[2:36:44] preparation.
[2:36:46] I'm winding down gradually. But this is
[2:36:49] your prepar. What God will do, he will
[2:36:51] do. The other programs will take care of
[2:36:54] it. But you must not end up a casualty.
[2:36:58] In this journey because God has also
[2:37:01] offered you
[2:37:03] a way of escape.
[2:37:06] Do I have what it takes? Yes.
[2:37:09] Every one of us must come to that
[2:37:11] junction of personal sincerity.
[2:37:17] Hallelujah. Don't deceive yourself. Even
[2:37:20] if you deceive me, it's fine. But not
[2:37:23] yourself. That's right, sir. There will
[2:37:25] be a much more casuality. Yes, sir. I'm
[2:37:28] going to search it this morning to have
[2:37:30] what it takes to confront my Isa because
[2:37:34] Isa will come. That's right. That's
[2:37:37] right. You can preach rapture without
[2:37:40] his suffer. Yeah. That is why the
[2:37:42] prophet told you, you got to have a
[2:37:44] squeeze and a pressure before you enter
[2:37:47] into your blessings, it will come.
[2:37:53] Everything you claim, everything you
[2:37:55] touch, renew, all your whether it's
[2:37:58] intellectual or revelation, time will
[2:38:00] prove it
[2:38:02] because his will be here. Amen. Israel
[2:38:05] prepared to meet your king.
[2:38:09] Hallelujah.
[2:38:11] When Jacob realized
[2:38:14] that he didn't have what it takes,
[2:38:18] he knew it would take more than a
[2:38:20] patched up life.
[2:38:26] To confront Israel. Yeah, you could
[2:38:30] survive with tricks on many things,
[2:38:33] but you won't make it at the time of a
[2:38:35] squeeze. That's true.
[2:38:38] Because squeeze is to bring down
[2:38:40] whatever you are inside.
[2:38:44] Do you see why now?
[2:38:47] Amen. So, who are you this morning?
[2:38:51] I want you to have a personal Easter.
[2:38:54] Can I bring up that picture?
[2:38:59] Jacob
[2:39:03] realized that this was who he was this
[2:39:05] time portion all around.
[2:39:12] But there is hope for Jacob
[2:39:15] if he's ready to accept Christ. You know
[2:39:18] the hope he has
[2:39:20] he's got this tiny button.
[2:39:24] Amen.
[2:39:26] This dark one is the Jacob.
[2:39:30] This tiny one is Israel.
[2:39:35] Did you hear me? I want to make it so
[2:39:36] simple for you. Amen.
[2:39:41] Now this is the re in
[2:39:47] but by natural
[2:39:49] birth because our natural birth was not
[2:39:52] God's own divine prescription.
[2:39:56] True. The process of our natural birth
[2:39:58] was what Satan took advantage to inject
[2:40:02] his nature. Amen. Into mankind. Amen.
[2:40:06] Yes.
[2:40:08] Yes sir. Amen. Because that was how he
[2:40:11] was able to produce a son vicariously.
[2:40:15] Amen. And that was why Cain met every
[2:40:18] characteristic of Satan. Amen. Do you
[2:40:21] know Cain lived in the dispensation of
[2:40:24] innocence
[2:40:26] and corrupted the innocence?
[2:40:29] You didn't catch that. There was never
[2:40:32] an evil done before pain came. My God.
[2:40:35] So everything Ken did, he had no
[2:40:38] example.
[2:40:39] He had no physical influence. It was all
[2:40:42] inherent in him. It was a package that
[2:40:47] came
[2:40:48] as a gym of the devil.
[2:40:54] He didn't need nobody to teach him. It
[2:40:57] was already him there. Nobody has ever
[2:40:59] been hungry before. Nobody had ever been
[2:41:02] jealous. Nobody has ever had a murderous
[2:41:05] thought. Nobody knew that carrying a
[2:41:07] sledgehammer and eating somebody could
[2:41:10] kill another person. It was all
[2:41:12] innocent.
[2:41:14] But Cain did all without seeing an
[2:41:17] example. You know why? Because he was
[2:41:20] born son of Satan. Yes.
[2:41:24] [Music]
[2:41:27] And everybody who came by that process
[2:41:29] of birth
[2:41:31] got this nature imposed on them. It's
[2:41:35] not your fault.
[2:41:37] But it becomes your fault when you now
[2:41:40] know it and refuse to do something.
[2:41:43] That's right.
[2:41:45] Did you hear me? So that black guy was
[2:41:49] Jacob.
[2:41:52] That black guy was Abraham.
[2:41:55] But the little button was Abraham.
[2:41:58] Hallelujah.
[2:42:01] Hallelujah. That black guy was Jacob.
[2:42:05] The little button in there was Israel.
[2:42:10] Two of them don't leave, don't operate
[2:42:13] at the same time. There must be death to
[2:42:16] one
[2:42:18] so that the other can be quickened.
[2:42:21] That will be your personal Easter.
[2:42:24] [Applause]
[2:42:25] Amen.
[2:42:29] Is it simple enough?
[2:42:31] [Music]
[2:42:33] So as long as Jacob was Jacob, he can
[2:42:36] match his own. That's right. Amen. He
[2:42:40] will perish.
[2:42:45] Amen.
[2:42:47] So what must he do? M you must go
[2:42:51] for a process of death
[2:42:54] burial. Are you ready to die? Amen.
[2:42:57] Until you are ready to die. You're not
[2:43:00] ready to live. This nature must die.
[2:43:04] What looks like you wasn't actually you.
[2:43:09] Satan only borrowed your identity to
[2:43:12] commit all the fraud, all the sin. Yes.
[2:43:16] This is the one that is born of God.
[2:43:19] Hallelujah. He cannot sin.
[2:43:22] [Applause]
[2:43:27] In the message invisible union, the
[2:43:29] prophet said, "This is actually you."
[2:43:33] Amen.
[2:43:34] Did you catch that?
[2:43:37] But this was how you look like for now.
[2:43:41] Because by your natural birth this
[2:43:44] nature was imposed and it became your
[2:43:47] identity.
[2:43:48] That is why the prophet said when that
[2:43:51] when that dark soul when it dies.
[2:43:56] Amen. You are not only forgiven,
[2:44:00] you are justified. Hallelujah.
[2:44:04] What is your justification? Is as though
[2:44:06] you never did this.
[2:44:09] Yeah. And actually we never did it.
[2:44:14] It was an
[2:44:17] impossing your intent. Hallelujah.
[2:44:21] Hallelujah.
[2:44:26] [Music]
[2:44:29] Amen. That is why any man be born in
[2:44:32] Christ as a new creature. Amen. Now, God
[2:44:36] does not want this you to separate from
[2:44:38] this one.
[2:44:40] He wants this one to actually die.
[2:44:44] Are you catching it? Are you catching
[2:44:46] it? Because God is not going to marry a
[2:44:48] divorce.
[2:44:50] But Christ can marry a widow.
[2:44:55] [Applause]
[2:44:57] But he won't marry a divorce.
[2:45:00] He can't break his own law.
[2:45:02] Marrying the devil, it will make him an
[2:45:04] adulterer.
[2:45:05] As long a woman is bound by the law of
[2:45:08] her husband,
[2:45:10] as long as he lives,
[2:45:13] the only thing that discharges a woman
[2:45:16] is if her husband is dead. Then she
[2:45:20] become open to be taken by another man.
[2:45:23] That's right. So God will not break his
[2:45:26] own law. This is why he doesn't want you
[2:45:29] divorcing it.
[2:45:30] Amen. He wants it dead.
[2:45:36] You see the way he's redeeming you is
[2:45:39] the way is redeeming the earth. That is
[2:45:42] why before the first quad city can rest
[2:45:44] on the earth, there must be a fire
[2:45:46] innovation.
[2:45:48] There must be a killing. There must be a
[2:45:50] wiping out. And there must be an
[2:45:52] annihilation.
[2:45:55] So this must be completely annihilated
[2:45:58] before this one takes over. Yes sir.
[2:46:01] They are not going to govern your body
[2:46:03] together. No sir. No sir. God will not
[2:46:07] share you with any man.
[2:46:09] [Applause]
[2:46:11] Amen. Hallelujah. Did you hear that?
[2:46:16] So this was the experience Jacob must
[2:46:18] have
[2:46:20] and this is the experience that you must
[2:46:23] also have. Otherwise you can't make it.
[2:46:28] Rapture will be a mirage.
[2:46:32] Amen. So you know what Jacob did? Leave
[2:46:34] the picture there. You know what Jacob
[2:46:36] did? He went to the presence of God
[2:46:40] and he started wrestling it. He was
[2:46:43] confessing. He was repenting.
[2:46:46] He was confessing all. He wasn't hiding
[2:46:49] anything. He was opening all before whom
[2:46:54] can help me. Hallelujah.
[2:46:57] Then God asked him.
[2:47:00] What is your name?
[2:47:04] He said I am Jacob.
[2:47:06] Meaning I'm a deceiver.
[2:47:09] God wanted him to confess. God knew his
[2:47:12] name. Yes, God has called him several
[2:47:15] times. So did he forget? Why was he
[2:47:18] asking what is your name? He wanted him
[2:47:20] to confess his identity.
[2:47:24] When you come before God, say it as it
[2:47:26] is.
[2:47:27] Stop playing with words.
[2:47:31] If you are a thief, say you are a thief.
[2:47:34] If you are an adulterer, say you an
[2:47:36] adulterer. If you're a fornicator, say
[2:47:38] you a fornicator. If you a liar, say you
[2:47:40] are a liar. you will have a better
[2:47:42] chance in the presence of God.
[2:47:46] That's right. Don't be playing with
[2:47:49] words. I am somebody who gets conflrated
[2:47:52] in emotional
[2:47:53] embassy fire. And when the fire gets
[2:47:56] consuming, it makes me do things
[2:47:58] inappropriate.
[2:48:02] You even get before God, you want to be
[2:48:04] stereotyping repentance. you ain't going
[2:48:07] to make it if you are too sophisticated
[2:48:10] for a birth.
[2:48:12] That's right. Don't get pregnant.
[2:48:15] Because birth can be very messy.
[2:48:19] Even if you opt for CS,
[2:48:22] you will still bleed.
[2:48:24] Amen.
[2:48:27] This is come to the savior. Let there be
[2:48:30] a death. Let there be a period. Let
[2:48:33] there be a Hallelujah.
[2:48:37] Yes sir. Yes sir. Don't be different.
[2:48:42] [Applause]
[2:48:44] That's right.
[2:48:45] He said I am Jacob.
[2:48:48] Say you are. So what do you want? That
[2:48:51] is why I came. I'm a deceiver. I'm sick
[2:48:54] and tired of it. I need a change. If you
[2:48:58] need a change, God is ready. Lord, you
[2:49:02] must see your heart and your mouth in my
[2:49:06] Huh? There must be harmony. When there
[2:49:08] is harmony, there is sincerity. When
[2:49:11] there is sincerity, you will get God.
[2:49:15] Hallelujah. He said if this change come,
[2:49:18] you don't walk the same again. You said
[2:49:19] I'm ready. You don't talk the same
[2:49:22] again. I'm ready. You don't dress the
[2:49:24] same again. You said I'm ready. You
[2:49:26] don't associate with the same people
[2:49:28] again. He said I'm ready. And when he
[2:49:32] was truly ready, God was also ready.
[2:49:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:49:39] [Applause]
[2:49:43] And by the time the change came from
[2:49:45] today, you are no more Jacob.
[2:49:48] Hallelujah.
[2:49:50] So Jacob died. Hallelujah. Jacob died.
[2:49:54] Hallelujah. And this one Israel came
[2:49:58] alive and there was no more darkness.
[2:50:01] The the Israel that has come alive has
[2:50:05] come in the middle form.
[2:50:08] But this Israel will go and expand here.
[2:50:12] By what? By feeding on the word.
[2:50:15] Hallelujah.
[2:50:19] Feeding on the word in apostles
[2:50:21] doctrines in fellowship and in breaking
[2:50:24] of bread. Yes sir. Huh? Yes sir. You
[2:50:28] will bring this Israel. Do you have a
[2:50:30] clear without that one now? You don't
[2:50:33] have the one without that one. All
[2:50:34] right. What I'm saying is that he said
[2:50:37] as this little one, this is Christ being
[2:50:40] born in him, formed in him. As this
[2:50:43] little one, Amen, takes over, he keeps
[2:50:47] expanding.
[2:50:49] Amen. By the word, he's got to be fed
[2:50:53] right. Yes sir. When it's taking the
[2:50:55] balance diet, the spiritual seven men,
[2:50:59] it starts growing. It starts expanding
[2:51:03] until it will come to full structure.
[2:51:07] Amen. That is the man, that will survive
[2:51:12] the squeeze. That is the man that is
[2:51:15] preparing for the coming king. And truly
[2:51:20] brethren, as Jacob left the presence of
[2:51:23] God, now Israel, his work has changed.
[2:51:28] The things he used to do, he do them.
[2:51:32] The way he used to walk,
[2:51:35] he no more. The life he used to live, he
[2:51:40] live them no more. It was a great day
[2:51:44] when he was born.
[2:51:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:51:55] When he came out Yeah. And Israel, he
[2:51:59] was ready.
[2:52:01] He told all his family, he said, "Get
[2:52:03] behind me." I've got what it takes now
[2:52:08] to face.
[2:52:09] I will win this battle. And he began to
[2:52:12] go and he began to grow. And when it got
[2:52:16] to Esau, Esau became confused.
[2:52:20] You know why? He was waiting for Jacob.
[2:52:24] It was Israel that appeared.
[2:52:27] [Applause]
[2:52:29] Hallelujah. Now, now, hallelujah. Can
[2:52:32] you hold Israel responsible for what
[2:52:34] Jacob did
[2:52:36] through justification?
[2:52:39] [Applause]
[2:52:39] [Music]
[2:52:42] Will not make it. Yeah. But his made it.
[2:52:48] Change your name this afternoon.
[2:52:51] Change your this afternoon. Lord, if you
[2:52:54] want to meet the coming
[2:52:58] have an
[2:53:00] Easter. I close with this.
[2:53:04] How many know E?
[2:53:08] What a beautiful story that was.
[2:53:12] The king needed a bride. I hope I can
[2:53:15] give him five ter. Is that okay?
[2:53:20] If it's not okay, tell me. We come back
[2:53:21] again.
[2:53:23] It's okay. All right. The king needed a
[2:53:27] bride. Amen.
[2:53:30] And uh 1,000 virgins
[2:53:34] were gathered for the king to make
[2:53:37] selection.
[2:53:39] But these 1,000 virgins, they were all
[2:53:42] virgins. So they all qualified
[2:53:46] at least by the law of purity, isn't it?
[2:53:49] All right. They were all
[2:53:52] taken to be prepared to meet the king.
[2:53:58] Amen. And they were handed over to one
[2:54:01] man
[2:54:04] called a guy. Amen.
[2:54:08] Now that is the angle I want to look at
[2:54:10] it from this afternoon. A guy
[2:54:14] was the king's keeper of women.
[2:54:19] But so that he will not be able to be
[2:54:22] tempted to inject his seed in any of
[2:54:24] them. He was made a healer.
[2:54:35] Oh yes. Every true messengers are
[2:54:41] That is why Paul could say that which I
[2:54:44] received from the Lord the same.
[2:54:47] No addition, no suppression. Are you
[2:54:49] getting it?
[2:54:52] William Ram said, "I was not the one
[2:54:54] that appeared at W River. I was only the
[2:54:57] person name. Yes. You are not feeding on
[2:54:59] me because a man is what we feed. You
[2:55:03] are feeding on the unfailing body of the
[2:55:06] son of man. He was an you.
[2:55:12] Hallelujah.
[2:55:13] So for the first 6 months they were
[2:55:17] undergoing their purification.
[2:55:22] They were to be prepared for a year.
[2:55:24] Then the last six months
[2:55:28] They are to rely on their own knowledge
[2:55:34] and make requests of what they
[2:55:38] think they need to qualify them to be
[2:55:42] the king's choice.
[2:55:44] It's in your Bible. Amen. Amen. But you
[2:55:49] see the the interesting thing is that
[2:55:52] all of these 1,000 virgins will relate
[2:55:55] with only one man relative to their
[2:55:58] needs.
[2:56:01] So whatever your needs are, a guy will
[2:56:04] supply you. Amen. Are you spiritual?
[2:56:10] Thank you, Lord. If it's fault you want
[2:56:11] to find, he will give you plenty to
[2:56:14] find. Hey
[2:56:18] there are some fault finding is their
[2:56:21] preparation.
[2:56:23] Amen. So they will look critical to the
[2:56:25] king.
[2:56:27] Amen. Whatever you need it's available.
[2:56:31] And each virgin was asking give me this
[2:56:34] give me that give me this give me that.
[2:56:36] In fact in fact in fact this was
[2:56:42] but the Bible made a remark.
[2:56:46] And this is what got me. He said when it
[2:56:49] comes to the turn of Esther
[2:56:54] the daughter of Hab the uncle of Modi.
[2:56:59] [Music]
[2:57:02] She did not ask for anything.
[2:57:07] [Music]
[2:57:08] It's like you know everybody come what
[2:57:12] do you need? This is a take. Then Esther
[2:57:15] came and said, "What do you need?"
[2:57:18] I don't need anything.
[2:57:21] But you must go to the king.
[2:57:24] You're going to need something. Say,
[2:57:26] "Yes, I understand that, but I don't
[2:57:28] need anything."
[2:57:30] Said, "So, how are we going to do?" He
[2:57:32] said, "Ear,
[2:57:34] you are the one that is closest to the
[2:57:37] king.
[2:57:40] God,
[2:57:42] you are the one that knows the mind of
[2:57:45] the king.
[2:57:47] God, you are the one that is used to the
[2:57:50] taste of the king. What I need is what
[2:57:55] you give me.
[2:57:57] I will never leave on my own
[2:57:59] understanding.
[2:58:01] I will leave on yours.
[2:58:04] Just give me what you feel it's okay and
[2:58:06] I'll be satisfied.
[2:58:10] Ah, said at last. You got one who has it
[2:58:14] up there.
[2:58:16] So you need me to help you. Okay,
[2:58:20] Esther, you take this. The king's like
[2:58:23] this. You take this. You will take this.
[2:58:27] When you appear, the king will see his
[2:58:30] reflection and you make it.
[2:58:38] Are you spiritual to catch it? Even if I
[2:58:41] leave it as a parable.
[2:58:46] Hallelujah.
[2:58:47] He don't need our understanding.
[2:58:51] God has sent his
[2:58:53] to give us a message of preparation.
[2:58:57] He does everything that we have in Lord.
[2:59:00] He said all you need. Amen. on your
[2:59:03] translation. Your rapturing faith is
[2:59:06] laying the message.
[2:59:10] You need nothing else. Thank you, Lord.
[2:59:12] You don't need extra study. You don't
[2:59:14] need extra food. Be satisfied with the
[2:59:17] message of the hour. Brother Graham
[2:59:19] said, "If you stay by distance, I will
[2:59:22] meet you in the morning."
[2:59:26] I can see Esther
[2:59:29] walking into the palace.
[2:59:32] And the king looked up for the first
[2:59:35] time and the holy time said, "I can see
[2:59:41] my reflection."
[2:59:44] Young lady, who taught you this?
[2:59:47] How do you know what I like? How do you
[2:59:49] know this is my taste? How do you get my
[2:59:52] smell? How do you get this? Where is my
[2:59:56] rod?
[2:59:58] You are the queen.
[3:00:01] and soul shall be the same.
[3:00:04] If you are closed by the message,
[3:00:09] you shall
[3:00:10] God bless you.
[3:00:15] Hallelujah.
[3:00:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:00:34] Praise the Lord.

[3:01:03] service is not
[3:01:04] dismissed. Amen. Deacons, please be at
[3:01:07] your post of duty. We haven't dismissed
[3:01:08] the service. Amen. When we come into a
[3:01:11] combine like this, we ought to obey the
[3:01:13] law of the church. Yes, sir. Amen. There
[3:01:16] is order in God's kingdom. Praise the
[3:01:18] Lord. It's a time of worship after the
[3:01:20] preaching of the word. Amen. and his
[3:01:23] king worship time. Amen. Worship him and
[3:01:26] give him glory. Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:01:33] [Music]
[3:01:36] Oh, can't you
[3:01:39] see
[3:01:41] why I have?
[3:01:44] [Music]

[3:02:00] revealed
[3:02:02] word that was
[3:02:06] spy prophet by the
[3:02:10] prophet of
[3:02:13] Mali. If you identify with that, can we
[3:02:16] raise our hand and sing it out? Oh,
[3:02:19] can't you
[3:02:22] see
[3:02:24] what I
[3:02:27] [Music]
[3:02:30] have? I
[3:02:33] accepted the
[3:02:36] word of the
[3:02:39] Lord. The revealed
[3:02:41] word, the
[3:02:45] revealed way.
[3:02:48] That
[3:02:49] [Music]
[3:03:00] was while the music I want us to worship
[3:03:03] the Lord and give him praise. Amen.
[3:03:05] Thank you. Amen. That he called you,
[3:03:07] that he elected you, that he chose you.
[3:03:10] Amen. Oh, just begin to worship him and
[3:03:13] give him glory. Amen. It's coming down
[3:03:15] to a time of consecration, a time of the
[3:03:18] individual. Amen. Hallelujah. God has
[3:03:22] personalized it. Amen. Personally coming
[3:03:25] to you this morning to speak to your
[3:03:27] heart. To make sure that you make
[3:03:30] preparation to meet the king.
[3:03:33] Oh, if you're not right with the Lord,
[3:03:35] why don't you make yourself right with
[3:03:36] the Lord right now? Let this be your
[3:03:38] altar where you are right now. Say,
[3:03:40] "Father, I surrender, oh God."
[3:03:43] Oh hallelujah. If spirits have been
