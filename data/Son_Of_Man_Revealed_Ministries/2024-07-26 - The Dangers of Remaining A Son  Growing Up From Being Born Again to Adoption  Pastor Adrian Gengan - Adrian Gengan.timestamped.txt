[0:17] alone but by every word that comes from
[0:19] the mouth of God we thank you Lord that
[0:21] you have revealed your word to us in
[0:23] this day Lord we know your word hasn't
[0:25] come Lord to make us part of a religion
[0:27] oh God but your word has come Lord to
[0:30] restore us as Sons and Daughters of god
[0:32] father I pray Lord that you will take
[0:33] your word and Quicken it to our hearts
[0:35] and souls oh God and I pray Lord that
[0:37] you'll meet the need tonight of every
[0:39] believer that has come into the house of
[0:41] the Lord I pray you'll bless everyone
[0:43] Lord Jesus whatever they need is Father
[0:45] meet them at the point of their need if
[0:46] they have a question Lord I pray you'll
[0:48] answer it Lord Jesus I pray Lord that we
[0:51] submit ourselves to the leadership of
[0:52] your spirit now and we pray Lord that
[0:55] the great angel of God will come and be
[0:56] in our midst father we ask His blessings
[0:59] in Jesus name
[1:01] amen amen I greet you all in the
[1:03] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:04] Jesus Christ amen hallelujah I soon
[1:08] coming King amen what a great day it'll
[1:10] be when we see the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13] face to face amen what a day that will
[1:16] be amen so greet you and I pray that you
[1:19] all being blessed in the house of the
[1:21] Lord amen hallelujah let's turn to our
[1:23] Bibles even as we read
[1:26] amen praise the
[1:28] Lord Let's uh turn to Ephesians chap 1
[1:31] and:
[1:49] 3 Ephesians chapter 1 and verse
[1:52] 3 reads blessed be the God and father of
[1:55] our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[1:59] not will bless bless us he had blessed
[2:01] us with all spiritual blessings in
[2:04] Heavenly places in Christ amen according
[2:07] as he had chosen Us in him before the
[2:11] foundation of the world that we should
[2:13] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[2:16] love having predestinated us unto the
[2:20] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[2:24] himself so adoption of children is
[2:26] coming by Jesus Christ to himself
[2:29] because the Redeemer needs to come to
[2:31] adopt us according to the good pleasure
[2:33] of his will then we'll turn to Romans
[2:35] chapter 8 and verse1 17 amen these are
[2:38] very important scriptures for us amen so
[2:41] make note of these
[2:42] scriptures he predestinated us for one
[2:45] purpose remember collectively we call
[2:47] ourselves the bride the wife of the Lord
[2:49] Jesus Christ but individually we are
[2:52] Sons and Daughters of God
[2:55] Amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 reads
[3:01] I'm reading from the Amplified but you
[3:03] can read from you your King James and if
[3:05] we are his children then we are his
[3:07] heirs also HS of God and fellow HS with
[3:10] Christ sharing his spiritual blessings
[3:13] and inheritance if we indeed share in
[3:16] his suffering so that we may also share
[3:19] in his glory amen you may be seated
[3:21] we'll continue reading just need to lay
[3:23] some scriptures down in Galatians 4 and
[3:25] verse
[3:28] 1 Galatians ch 4 and verse1
[3:35] says now I say that an
[3:38] heir as long as he is a
[3:41] child defer nothing from his
[3:45] servant though he be Lord of
[3:48] all now I don't have time to read it but
[3:51] you remember in Luke chapter 15 when the
[3:53] prodigal son left the home when he came
[3:56] back he was adopted amen but there was
[4:00] one son who remained in the house though
[4:03] he was a of
[4:05] all he wasn't he didn't know how to
[4:07] function in his authority I'm going to
[4:10] read another version of that same verse
[4:12] because I want you to understand what
[4:15] this verse he
[4:17] saying if a father dies this is another
[4:20] version now if a father
[4:24] dies and leaves an inheritance for his
[4:27] young children those children are not
[4:29] much better off than slaves until they
[4:31] grow
[4:34] up even though they actually own
[4:36] everything their father had
[4:39] yes
[4:41] amen hallelujah amen that's right so in
[4:45] Ephesians 4 and verse1
[4:48] 15 speaking the truth in love that's
[4:50] what we are doing we are speaking truth
[4:52] in love people may not like what we are
[4:54] saying but we are speaking the truth in
[4:57] love amen let's we also fall into a
[5:01] deception that we have the opening of
[5:04] the word eve had the opening of the word
[5:07] but she didn't know what to do with the
[5:08] word
[5:10] amen so we don't want to fall into
[5:12] Satan's devices remember he deceived her
[5:17] he was the most subtle Beast yeah he
[5:20] still
[5:21] subtle he'll still come in and try to
[5:23] infiltrate yeah to make you think Pat
[5:26] you on your back don't worry you're okay
[5:27] you're in the message you're safe yeah
[5:30] the point of this message is we don't
[5:32] want you to remain just a son yes
[5:37] amen so there's a danger here now all of
[5:40] us can say we in the message all of us
[5:42] can say we sons of God yes you won't
[5:44] lose your salvation but you can't be a
[5:47] son without Authority yes without being
[5:50] able to advance the kingdom amen without
[5:52] being an effective son in the Kingdom
[5:54] you can be just like the boy who was
[5:56] upset that the prodigal son had now been
[5:59] adopted
[6:01] yes speaking the truth in love may grow
[6:06] up that's why sand I told you turn to
[6:08] your neighbor and tell him grow up
[6:10] amen May grow up into him in All Things
[6:16] amen what are he saying I want you to be
[6:18] like your father grow up
[6:21] amen which is the head even Christen
[6:25] amen now here what the prophet of God is
[6:28] saying in the adoption message I believe
[6:31] that we all baptized with the Holy
[6:33] Spirit and brought into the body and
[6:36] then we become Sons so that's all fine
[6:39] that's your birth he says but then after
[6:42] Sons there's a placing of sons or the
[6:46] adoption of sons amen because remember
[6:50] your birth is not your adoption amen we
[6:54] can't be in the message so long and not
[6:56] understand the new
[6:57] birth we fuss about baptism not
[7:00] realizing the revelation of baptism came
[7:02] to show us the correct
[7:05] birth because Jesus in John chapter 3 is
[7:08] teaching us about the New Birth he says
[7:10] except a man be born of water and of
[7:13] spirit amen so notice water is for the
[7:17] birth spirit is for your placing amen
[7:21] amen so the spirit comes at both times
[7:23] because it's in Jesus there the Holy
[7:26] Spirit comes at the Jordan River for his
[7:29] birth
[7:30] and then he comes in Matthew 17 Cloud
[7:32] overshadows him for his adoption
[7:34] everybody understand that so there
[7:36] there's two works that the holy spirit
[7:38] will do the holy spirit is not pouring
[7:40] out now for your birth the holy spirit
[7:43] is pouring out in this time and in this
[7:45] season for your adoption that's right
[7:46] yes amen amen God is looking for
[7:49] spiritually mature Sons amen amen now
[7:53] I'm going to say
[7:54] this that we have a responsibility
[8:00] we have a responsibility to carry our
[8:03] anointing yes yes
[8:05] amen amen amen because when we are
[8:08] fighting there's only one war being
[8:10] fought and it's against the kingdom of
[8:13] God we are Waging War you know in a in a
[8:18] battlefield there are certain soldiers
[8:20] that take strategic positions that go
[8:23] conquer strategic territory and when
[8:26] they conquer that territory they call to
[8:28] the rest they word back home we have
[8:31] conquered nandi yeah we have uh we have
[8:33] come through the beach yeah and because
[8:36] they conquer certain territory they make
[8:38] way for the other troops
[8:41] amen so when we are advancing the
[8:43] kingdom when we are amen advancing the
[8:46] kingdom and you know the prophet says
[8:48] there's much even Joshua says there's
[8:50] much more land that's not taken up there
[8:53] remain it much more land what he saying
[8:55] I'm saying it another way that they we
[8:58] need to Ascend the spirit realm yes amen
[9:03] we need to go into higher dimensions of
[9:05] the holy spirit because the land is your
[9:07] inhabitance which is the Holy Ghost so
[9:10] when we saying there's much more land
[9:11] that remains there's much more Holy
[9:13] Ghost That Remains we are saying come
[9:15] into higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost
[9:18] amen yes Lord amen amen don't be a son
[9:22] only
[9:24] yeah I I know many people preach it this
[9:28] way oh just Keep On Believing the
[9:30] message Just Keep On Believing the
[9:32] message one day God's going to open up a
[9:34] portal to you and you're going to be
[9:35] able to speak I say speak now yes amen I
[9:38] say you have nothing to lose I say take
[9:41] God by his word and speak now yes amen
[9:45] wonderful thank you Lord amen the reason
[9:48] why they say that way they are scared
[9:49] something won't happen and their
[9:51] reputation is at stake I say it's not my
[9:53] reputation at stake it is God's
[9:55] reputation at stake if he says ask
[9:58] anything in my name I don't have to wait
[10:00] for a certain time and a season for it
[10:02] to open up to me I can speak now as a
[10:04] Son of
[10:06] God amen amen people are afraid like the
[10:10] son they don't realize they speaking
[10:12] like that son father I was in your house
[10:14] how come you never killed a fatted cal
[10:16] for me the father says son you were in
[10:18] my house all the time you had access you
[10:21] could have made a feast for
[10:26] yourself how about we make a feast for
[10:29] our elves amen hallelujah amen how about
[10:33] we exercise some of our Authority that's
[10:35] right
[10:36] amen amen and I say that because when we
[10:41] are operating under our commission the
[10:43] commission is to rebuild the walls of
[10:45] Jerusalem
[10:46] amen that is not to rebuild the walls of
[10:49] Son of Man reveal
[10:50] Ministries amen hallelujah when the
[10:53] Bible is talking about the Church of
[10:55] Corinth the church at this amen it is
[10:58] just to give you the IDE of who they are
[11:00] referring to but it is one Church it is
[11:03] one body amen so when we win battles
[11:06] here we are winning battles for the body
[11:08] of Christ amen
[11:11] amen oh hallelujah amen we having some
[11:14] good Fellowship earlier brother Joshua
[11:16] amen hallelujah because this is not just
[11:19] a church move this is a body move amen
[11:23] when you see that we advancing certain
[11:26] territories and advancing the kingdom
[11:28] and defeating the enemy you are finding
[11:30] other churches following suit because
[11:32] somebody is opening the
[11:34] portal yes amen yes that's right that's
[11:38] why I say it's one Warfare they some
[11:41] people are taking strategic positions
[11:44] some people are taking their place some
[11:46] people are taking back what the devil
[11:47] stole from
[11:50] them amen so don't just think that we a
[11:53] small group of people and we are
[11:55] ineffective in the body of Christ I tell
[11:57] you we are an Elite Force amen
[11:59] Hallelujah we are special
[12:02] ops amen yes that's right
[12:07] Hallelujah blessed be your name so now
[12:09] he says now what is
[12:11] adoption your adoption is not your
[12:16] birth so many people he says like the
[12:18] Pentecostal Church thought they were
[12:20] adopted when they were
[12:22] born at the New Birth the prophet is now
[12:25] saying your adoption is not your birth
[12:29] turn to your neighbor and tell him your
[12:30] adoption is not your
[12:34] birth your son is
[12:37] born is he adopted can he speak will you
[12:40] give him your card will you give him
[12:42] your car
[12:43] keys no because your adoption is not
[12:46] your
[12:47] birth you've got to wait for a time of
[12:50] maturity amen so the prophet is saying
[12:53] your adoption is not your birth your
[12:56] adoption is your placing amen
[13:00] when you were born
[13:01] again John 1:17 I believe when we were
[13:05] born of the spirit of God we are sons of
[13:07] God but we were predestinated now here
[13:10] what I'm trying to get to you for this
[13:12] sons of the last day we were
[13:15] predestinated unto adoption Hallelujah
[13:18] so we are going somewhere
[13:20] amen
[13:22] amen yeah what he says now about the
[13:24] church he says we're
[13:26] groaning waiting for that time of
[13:28] adoption ion and we believe that one of
[13:31] these days the holy spirit will move in
[13:34] not with a new birth for we receive that
[13:36] to Christ but you'll adopt your church
[13:42] then now we saying that years ago I
[13:46] believe the time is now Hallelujah he's
[13:48] saying there we believe one of these
[13:49] days the holy spirit will move in can
[13:51] you identify the Holy Spirit has moved
[13:53] in amen not with a new birth now but we
[13:56] have received that through Christ but
[13:58] you'll adopt your church then I'm so
[14:00] glad this is them this is that which the
[14:03] prophet brandham had spoken
[14:05] about amen them shall be clothed with
[14:08] the power of the resurrected Lord amen
[14:12] amen hallelujah not in this days before
[14:15] the crucifixion but in the power of the
[14:18] resurrected Lord amen will I leap
[14:21] through walls leap over walls come on
[14:24] now here what the prophet of God is
[14:26] saying they'll be res they'll have the
[14:28] power of the resurrected Lord amen not
[14:31] just the Lord before the
[14:37] crucifixion will they be able to pass
[14:38] through walls then yes amen will they be
[14:41] able to move like a thought yes Lord
[14:43] will they be able to change Dimensions
[14:45] amen yes well that's the power of the
[14:48] resurrected Lord
[14:51] amen and father we now watch most people
[14:54] are saying this I'm going to say it
[14:56] openly they are preaching that this is
[14:57] in a future time
[14:59] that it's only when the squeeze
[15:02] comes why afraid looking at what he will
[15:06] do talking about what he has done afraid
[15:10] of what he's doing now yes now here the
[15:13] prophet's prayer this is a prayer Watch
[15:15] what he's saying we pray father that
[15:17] you'll do this quickly amen for the days
[15:20] look so dark and evil ahead we pray
[15:24] you'll adopt us now if you pray adop us
[15:27] now I pray adop us now Lord
[15:32] Jesus into your family give us the
[15:35] authority that we need father to make
[15:38] the gain here keep
[15:41] still Hallelujah that's from the message
[15:44] the believer's position in Christ now
[15:46] how if you believe that the Lord Jesus
[15:48] Christ came in and gave us an
[15:49] inheritance amen amen all right
[15:52] everybody said amen I want to show you
[15:54] what the prophet of God says that Jesus
[15:56] didn't give us any inheritance
[16:02] he's talking about here in the adoption
[16:04] message inheritance by predestination he
[16:07] says I inherited something what
[16:09] inheritance there had to be somebody
[16:12] leave me an inheritance why you say
[16:14] Jesus left you an inheritance beg your
[16:18] pardon Jesus never left me an
[16:20] inheritance Jesus never left you an
[16:22] inheritance he only came down and paid
[16:25] for your
[16:26] inheritance amen
[16:29] your inheritance was given to you before
[16:31] the foundation of the world but through
[16:33] the fall you lost your inheritance but
[16:35] Jesus Christ came to pay the price for
[16:38] for Redemption so that you can have
[16:40] access to your inheritance come on
[16:42] you're a Son of God
[16:45] Amen because how can one son give
[16:48] another son inheritance it's got to be
[16:50] the father who gives the inheritance so
[16:52] the father already gave us the
[16:54] inheritance but he sent his son to pay
[16:56] the price of redemption so that you can
[16:58] be restored back to your inheritance
[17:00] somebody give God
[17:02] praise why do you think we sing that we
[17:05] just read the verse now we are joint
[17:07] years yes
[17:09] amen hallelujah amen now think of it in
[17:12] your home brother Joshua you got a
[17:14] father there's two brothers here Joshua
[17:17] and
[17:19] Jaffer if your father passes away can
[17:22] you give him an inheritance whose
[17:24] inheritance is it the father's
[17:26] inheritance that's why he's quoting this
[17:30] Jesus never left us in inheritance Jesus
[17:33] came to restore us and reconnect us with
[17:35] our inheritance
[17:40] amen Jesus never left you an in if you
[17:42] want that it's an adoption part three he
[17:45] never left you an inheritance he only
[17:47] came down and paid for your inheritance
[17:49] brought you to your inheritance but your
[17:51] name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life
[17:54] before the foundation of the world God
[17:56] give you your inheritance your
[17:57] inheritance was first first
[18:00] amen amen thank you
[18:04] Lord Jesus didn't come to do a new thing
[18:07] Jesus came to be the
[18:09] sacrifice to take you back to the
[18:11] original amen hallelujah hallah
[18:17] amen praise the
[18:21] Lord now just to go into this
[18:27] quickly he's talking about a son who's
[18:29] bornn in Israel after 8 days he was
[18:32] circumcised and become an Israel
[18:34] Israelite but he was born of the
[18:38] father and if that child was given a
[18:40] tutor Galatians teaches us after he was
[18:43] raised up to a certain age became very
[18:46] faithful to the father's work and
[18:47] everything he was a fine boy now the
[18:50] father didn't know what he would be when
[18:53] he was born he might be a gangster he
[18:55] might be slothful in the father's
[18:57] business he couldn't turn Kingdom and
[19:00] things his work over to that
[19:03] boy
[19:08] right even though he fell air to the
[19:10] kingdom of his father or The
[19:13] Possession the first that son had to be
[19:16] raised and tried he had to be found out
[19:18] whether this son was true son or he was
[19:21] just simply a roused about and this son
[19:24] would never be an heir if he wasn't
[19:26] qualified to take his father's place
[19:29] but if he was qualified and took the
[19:31] father's place then the father then all
[19:34] the that the father had had was given to
[19:37] his son now if you had wondered why
[19:39] there was a stretch since 65 the father
[19:43] was putting us through
[19:47] tutors there was a time where you were
[19:49] trained the father wanted to see whether
[19:51] you're a witch or a tear so he put you
[19:54] through a tutor ship put you when when
[19:57] when the when when they were rocking and
[19:59] shaking amen the winds were blowing
[20:02] against the cloud and the winds were
[20:03] blowing against the pillar of fire the
[20:05] winds were blowing against his Prophet
[20:07] to see what kind of material You're Made
[20:09] Of amen amen
[20:12] amen but now that you can go through
[20:14] that place of trying the holy spirit is
[20:17] here for your adoption amen thank you
[20:20] Lord so he says as soon as the child was
[20:23] born the father being so busy with other
[20:26] things he sought out a tutor
[20:28] or he raised off his child him not
[20:31] knowing that him knowing that this child
[20:34] was in line of air of everything he had
[20:37] his property his good name everything
[20:40] that he would go had would go to his son
[20:43] he sought the very best school teacher
[20:44] you could find to teach that child the
[20:47] father would not seek a man who would
[20:49] try to get a feather in his
[20:53] hat right so he will the sun Renegade he
[20:56] says it come up oh son you're doing very
[21:00] well he wouldn't do that so he's not
[21:02] going to compliment you if you're not
[21:03] doing well he's got a man who tell him
[21:05] the
[21:06] truth and we are the spirit of Truth the
[21:09] Holy Ghost is our tutor for you wanted
[21:12] to know just exactly the welfare of that
[21:14] boy at all
[21:16] times now even while you are being
[21:18] trained trained the Holy Spirit was
[21:21] giving a
[21:24] report some of you were were falling and
[21:26] backsliding and going back into the
[21:28] world the Holy Spirit was giving a
[21:30] report because he wants to know the
[21:32] welfare of the boy amen thank you Jesus
[21:35] but he also wants to see if you remain
[21:37] in that condition in your pig pin and
[21:40] are content with that style of
[21:43] life or if you're going to come back to
[21:45] father's home amen thank you Lord amen
[21:49] now here's an important part we want to
[21:51] get
[21:53] to then if this tutor brought word to
[21:56] the father that the child was worthy and
[21:58] all all
[21:59] right he was then adopted into that
[22:02] family right he was adopted into the
[22:05] family but if he
[22:08] wasn't he still remained a son but he
[22:12] wasn't
[22:16] adopted this is the dangerous part of
[22:19] the message of the hour now that's right
[22:20] because the message is for the adoption
[22:23] yes amen so in your life now when we
[22:27] asking you to write the vision and we
[22:29] asking you what do you want for your
[22:30] life I don't want you to only think
[22:33] carnally what do you want for your life
[22:35] spiritually amen young man what do you
[22:38] want to grow up you are already at an
[22:40] age where you're already supposed to be
[22:41] involved spiritually in the things of
[22:43] God but how do you see yourself
[22:45] spiritually
[22:46] growing do you want to remain a
[22:49] son or do you want to have some
[22:51] responsibility placed upon you we can
[22:55] all Rejoice yes I want to be an adopted
[22:56] son but what does it mean that I want a
[22:59] responsibility placed upon
[23:03] me so I'm asking you to think soberly
[23:06] now sisters what do you want for your
[23:09] life do you want to be a son and
[23:11] daughter of
[23:12] God or do you do you just want to be a
[23:14] son do you just want to be a daughter
[23:17] with no inheritance then every time you
[23:20] need something who do you need to go to
[23:23] you need to go to the adopted son
[23:26] because the adopted son is air of all
[23:27] things
[23:30] amen now I'm having a mature
[23:32] conversation with
[23:34] you I'm having a serious conversation
[23:36] with you how do you envision your
[23:40] life we are now in the father's
[23:43] Kingdom the kingdom is within us amen
[23:46] but we can remain a son with no
[23:49] Authority we can come into the church we
[23:51] can go home we can come into the church
[23:53] say we're part of the messy Church
[23:55] remain a son remain a daughter go home
[23:58] just be happy with this I not happy with
[24:00] this amen amen I am not happy with
[24:05] this I want my portion amen yes
[24:12] Lord so and then if he was adopted he
[24:15] was taken out in the public square and a
[24:18] purple robe was put on him and there was
[24:20] a law of adoption and that boy was
[24:23] adopted by the same father who gave him
[24:25] birth
[24:26] amen I'm reiterating that
[24:28] Point most people are satisfied with a
[24:31] new
[24:34] birth are you born again born born born
[24:38] again thank God I'm born
[24:41] again born born born again thank God I'm
[24:46] born again are you adopted
[24:51] no amen what Ephesians says grow up yes
[24:57] come to adoption
[24:59] amen amen hallelujah amen come out into
[25:03] the Public
[25:04] Square get a purple robe put upon you
[25:08] get the ring upon your
[25:10] finger there was a law of adoption and
[25:13] then that boy was adopted by the same
[25:16] father who gave him birth and he was
[25:18] brought into the
[25:20] family I thought I was I love the family
[25:25] of
[25:25] God you're only in the family when when
[25:28] you're adopted amen
[25:31] ah how many people are adopted
[25:34] then one of them hallelujah amen
[25:41] amen so you see how dangerous it is you
[25:44] see how close those two Spirits can get
[25:47] right that you can be have the family
[25:50] name
[25:52] even you can even have the family
[25:55] name but when you speak nothing
[26:01] moves why you don't want to follow the
[26:05] instruction you you are so enthused
[26:07] after the service I'm going to speak to
[26:09] my Mountain you speak nothing
[26:13] moves why father can't trust you you
[26:17] haven't passed the training you haven't
[26:19] passed the
[26:21] test amen hallelujah born again on a
[26:24] Sunday but gone again on a Monday amen
[26:29] Hallelujah and then he was brought into
[26:32] the family and then he wasn't only a son
[26:36] but then he was an heir coair with the
[26:39] father of every possession he
[26:41] had and then this boy signature on the
[26:44] check meant just the same as his daddy's
[26:47] just the same for he was adopted into
[26:49] full Fellowship of the family amen
[26:52] that's the place I want I want to sign
[26:55] like
[26:56] Daddy and I want you to know a son the
[26:59] one who wasn't adopted can fake the
[27:01] signature but nothing will happen that
[27:02] check is going to
[27:04] bounce we are not here supposed to be
[27:06] faking signatures yes Lord
[27:10] amen meaning that we can't Venture
[27:12] without
[27:13] Authority amen we can be in the church
[27:16] trying to speak trying to do things and
[27:18] nothing is happening what are we doing
[27:20] faking the father's
[27:21] signature but an adopted son is one when
[27:24] he speaks it's as good as the father
[27:26] signing it meaning that when he speaks
[27:28] demons start to ask where must I go
[27:31] that's right
[27:33] amen yes amen demons are even fearful of
[27:37] your Shadow that's right
[27:40] amen church I want you to know that if
[27:42] you're an adopted son and daughter of
[27:44] God you carry a you possess the
[27:46] anointing of the Holy Spirit within you
[27:48] God Almighty within you and when you
[27:51] carry demons start to tremble amen
[27:53] you've got to real if you don't walk
[27:55] around with his Consciousness if you
[27:56] don't walk around with his authority I
[27:58] tell you you're living under your
[27:59] god-given privileges it's time you rise
[28:02] up and realize what we are called for in
[28:03] this hour we are not called to be
[28:05] another church we are not called to be
[28:07] another movement amen we are called to
[28:09] be Sons and Daughters of the most high
[28:11] God we have a sacred responsibility with
[28:14] the anointing we carry
[28:16] amen yes
[28:19] hallelujah amen now he says that's what
[28:22] the matter with the when I'm saying
[28:23] Pentecostal church I want you to
[28:25] understand we're talking about message
[28:26] church too because the next move after
[28:29] the Pentecostal outpouring was the
[28:30] message church right now that's what's
[28:33] the matter with the Pentecostal church
[28:35] tonight too much differences as soon as
[28:37] you got saved you start this way a
[28:39] little trial comes along you fall off
[28:41] you go this way and that way ups and
[28:43] downs fusses and fights oh it sounds so
[28:45] familiar fusses and fights and Carries
[28:48] On until how could God trust you with
[28:50] those
[28:52] things to adopt you into the kingdom of
[28:55] God into his possession give you
[29:00] give you air to all the spiritual
[29:02] benefits if the church would only held
[29:04] together and quit fasting and splitting
[29:07] up and arguing over little baptisms oh
[29:10] 2024 20 we still splitting
[29:16] up he's saying if they can only hold
[29:19] together quit
[29:22] fasting splitting up arguing over little
[29:25] baptism and things like that you'd be a
[29:27] lot better off and one Church against
[29:29] the other that isn't Sons that's
[29:33] right God can't trust
[29:37] you divine gifts are very
[29:40] sacred see why I'm saying we have a
[29:42] responsibility that's right Divine gifts
[29:45] are very sacred and remember a person
[29:48] could send their soul to hell with
[29:51] one if you'll notice on the platform on
[29:54] my cases my patience I'm very careful of
[29:57] what I say I weigh every word I find the
[30:01] condition of that Soul before I say
[30:09] anything
[30:13] amen so just want to reiterate this now
[30:16] if he was a trusted son there came a
[30:18] certain day I want you to listen real
[30:20] close
[30:22] now there come a certain day in that
[30:24] young fellow's life after he became
[30:26] illegible after after he was well
[30:28] trained after he became a certain age
[30:31] this is dropped down to me why is it
[30:33] every every denominational service they
[30:36] have an alter call for New Birth only
[30:38] how many if you want to be born again
[30:39] Born Again born again you see they keep
[30:43] reproducing re keep reproducing but
[30:45] nobody comes to
[30:47] adoption how about taking those same
[30:49] people that came and wanted to be a born
[30:51] again and now have a second
[30:56] ceremony there was a time that the
[30:58] father adopted that child that he gave
[31:00] birth to into his own family that was
[31:03] the placing of a son to your ministers
[31:05] the same son that was born into the
[31:06] family had to be placed into the family
[31:09] or had to be the law of adoption okay
[31:12] everybody gets the
[31:18] point in the message everlasting life
[31:21] and how to receive
[31:22] it in paragraph 110 there let's keep one
[31:25] 109 let's go to 110 now when the
[31:28] Pentecostal church and these people in
[31:30] the last days are we the people in the
[31:31] last
[31:32] days here has begin to find the new
[31:35] birth being born again they thought they
[31:37] had settled it no sir your ups and downs
[31:41] your ins and outs and things like that
[31:43] God can't place you as a son how many of
[31:45] you know what the prophet is talking
[31:47] about you had ups and downs in your life
[31:49] ups and
[31:51] downs you see why Peter had to get out
[31:54] the boat because in the boat there was
[31:56] ups and downs the boat was going like
[31:59] that what is he saying but when you stay
[32:02] in the Kingdom stay in the gospel stay
[32:06] right one of these days God will call
[32:08] you out and set you aside adopt you as
[32:10] his son before the people and give you
[32:12] something that will shake the Nations
[32:16] amen see what I mean is the adoption
[32:19] into the
[32:21] family amen how many of you want to
[32:23] prophesy again how many of you want to
[32:25] shake the Nations amen
[32:31] yes see he's reiterating again that's
[32:34] where I think many of us made a mistake
[32:36] we think as soon as we become sons of
[32:38] God we that settles it amen hallelujah
[32:42] doesn't amen now here what he says now
[32:46] this is now the the one that remains a
[32:48] son very important I'm bringing this
[32:50] because I believe at this time and
[32:51] season some are going to remain
[32:54] Sons but some will go on to adoption
[32:58] amen let him that's filthy be filthy
[33:00] still and let him that's holy be holy
[33:03] still now we we saying that these people
[33:05] are not good people no the son that
[33:07] stayed at home with the father was a
[33:09] good man he followed all the teachings
[33:12] of the
[33:13] message but he didn't have an
[33:15] inheritance he didn't know how to live
[33:17] in The
[33:18] Inheritance here what the prophet is
[33:20] saying now and this little razor this
[33:23] tutor was supposed to come and bring
[33:24] word to the father how the child was
[33:26] progressing and how the tutor must have
[33:29] blushed If the child was misbehaving
[33:32] itself how the little boy was not
[33:35] interested in the things of his father's
[33:37] Farm or Kingdom how the Holy Spirit must
[33:39] feel today when it goes before God with
[33:41] a bowed shame face as it was to take a
[33:44] report of our indifference in the church
[33:46] today how we laid aside all the baptism
[33:49] of the spirit and how that the church
[33:50] are having a form of godliness and
[33:52] denying the power
[33:55] amen some of you know what I'm talking
[33:58] about amen we went to a service recently
[34:01] I don't believe in the third pool of
[34:06] 1959 you got a few screws loose in your
[34:15] head what is he saying we've laid aside
[34:19] denying the power do you know what 1959
[34:23] is speaking squirrels into existence
[34:26] they say they don't believe that third
[34:28] pool we not preaching the third pool of
[34:30] 959 when the prophet spoke that fish
[34:33] back to
[34:34] life you know why you remain the
[34:44] son oh I feel a backbone
[34:49] now
[34:50] hello are we going to call a spade a
[34:52] spade or we just going to listen to any
[34:54] nonsense that comes forth
[34:59] saying boldly boldly we are not
[35:01] preaching the third pool of 1959 can you
[35:04] speak a squirrel into
[35:05] existence can you speak a fish back to
[35:09] life can you speak to the Beast can you
[35:12] speak to the bull so you're saying
[35:14] you're not preaching the third pool of
[35:17] 1959 because you carry no power No
[35:21] Authority anytime let me tell you what
[35:23] the teaching is we believe the opening
[35:25] of the word brother so anytime it comes
[35:27] to a physical manifestation where you
[35:29] speak into the wind you speak into the
[35:31] storm they're going to get exposed
[35:33] because they carry no power so they
[35:35] rather hide behind see how well we can
[35:37] operate the word brother we can bring
[35:39] out the word with this type and this
[35:41] Shadow but you carry no power your
[35:43] letter is killing the people rather
[35:45] close your Bible and sit down Amen Let
[35:48] the sons of God Arise yes
[35:51] Lord right

[37:06] message they ask you why you dress like
[37:09] that you're so shy you can't tell them
[37:11] with authority the word of God declares
[37:13] that this is the way a woman should
[37:14] dress yes you're compromising with your
[37:16] family you're compromising with the
[37:18] friends you're compromising with work

[37:32] they say my husband don't allow me to
[37:33] wear this then you don't have a
[37:35] revelation of the message not your
[37:37] husband doesn't allow you to do it God's
[37:40] word doesn't allow you to do
[37:46] it

[40:00] will you ask I wish we'd have time to
[40:03] take this up before the law of adoption
[40:05] Pentecost was born like his son and that
[40:08] same son was born into the family had to
[40:10] be adopted also that's where you missed
[40:13] your calling
[40:15] friend when the adoption time come if
[40:18] the tutor raised the child found the
[40:20] child not worthy they absolutely still
[40:25] remained a son
[40:28] but missed their
[40:31] adoption but if they were adopted into
[40:33] the family then they had full fellowship
[40:36] with any check they wrote just as good
[40:38] as what their daddy wrote that's what's
[40:40] the matter today the church ought to be
[40:42] adoption right
[40:44] now amen the church ought to be in
[40:47] adoption right now
[40:49] amen bringing in the full favors of God

[41:48] about
[42:05] okay let's go down to that very last uh
[42:08] this the very last highlighted section
[42:11] there so the prophet of God would go on
[42:14] he says when you in when you're now
[42:17] adopted as a son he says as much as
[42:20] you're taking far care of the father's
[42:22] business you can write checks in his
[42:23] name he says if you fire somebody they
[42:25] are fired yeah
[42:27] yes how about we fire the devil
[42:31] right how about we fire all of his imps
[42:34] right how about we fire every Spirit

[42:50] there so I'm write down I'm write down
[42:53] it's like the last quote there literally
[42:56] amen
[42:58] yeah there but I want to start maybe
[43:01] Midway uh let's see let's go to the
[43:04] next next
[43:10] one so let's start at the bottom
[43:13] everything the father had was his we're
[43:14] talking about a place Sun now right
[43:16] everything the father had was his let's
[43:18] go to the next
[43:21] one read the old right a son could not
[43:24] walk down the street wasn't doing right
[43:26] yeah straighten up
[43:28] okay that meant so if he fired the man
[43:31] he was
[43:33] fired what is he saying go back there I
[43:35] don't think we got
[43:37] that he says that son could walk down
[43:40] the street and this fellow wasn't doing
[43:42] right he could say yeah straighten up
[43:45] hey it sounds like what I'm doing
[43:50] tonight if I see somebody not doing
[43:52] right I tell him hey straighten
[43:55] up and then he goes to say that
[43:59] meant that meant so if he fired the man
[44:02] he was fired if he wrote a check and
[44:04] paid this off the bank will recognize
[44:06] the cheick just his name was as good as
[44:08] his father after he'd been adopted not
[44:11] because he was
[44:12] born because he was adopted or placed so
[44:16] you see why we can't just Rejoice that
[44:17] we were born again amen we must now
[44:20] Rejoice that we are adopted sons of
[44:23] God and God's trying today to make his
[44:26] shirt stand still long enough that he
[44:28] could place them into their position
[44:31] right but men teachers are making it oh

[45:45] Ghost in the Holy Ghost is outpouring

[45:52] a refilling of the Holy Ghost yes you
[45:54] had it at the birth
[45:57] but the Holy Ghost you know the Holy

[46:35] amen
[46:37] why for the adoption ceremony now I know
[46:40] this kind of message maybe 50% will say
[46:44] yes this is me this is what I'm called
[46:47] for this is what I step into the others
[46:49] probably will say no and they will
[46:51] remain as a son and a daughter of God

[46:56] life

[47:09] son
[47:12] Hey I was talking to a pastor today and
[47:14] he was telling me this humor this
[47:16] humorous thing and he was telling me
[47:18] that how this uh this like a bishop he
[47:22] went to the Catholic church and he he
[47:24] saw all the wealth of the church and he
[47:27] said well we can't preach like Peter and
[47:29] them and say Silver and Gold Have we
[47:33] none because they got it right and then
[47:37] the other guy says well you also can't
[47:39] preach pick up your bed and walk why
[47:42] they don't have the power and
[47:45] authority let's not be like
[47:48] that the message didn't come to make us
[47:52] puffed what they call it a stuffed shirt
[47:55] to walk around like we are better than
[47:57] you the message came to place us as
[48:00] adopted Sons and Daughters of God the
[48:03] message didn't come for us to go and
[48:05] criticize and condemn everybody else the
[48:08] message came to place us as sons in our
[48:10] position am
[48:12] yes amen hallelujah you know just
[48:16] reflecting on last week Wednesday the
[48:19] Lord ordained for that
[48:21] meeting when we had that meeting at the
[48:24] house of my aunt brother Joshua brother
[48:26] Jeff's gr the Lord ordained that
[48:31] meeting and the Lord operated in more
[48:34] ways than you can
[48:36] understand
[48:38] amen maybe you didn't speak to the
[48:40] people there but there were so many
[48:42] needs
[48:43] there and one of the first person that
[48:45] came to speak to me told me this and
[48:48] this is from a pastor's home pastor's
[48:50] wife comes to me now remember what we
[48:53] always say that denomination only pre
[48:55] salvation they only preaching the cross
[48:58] and they're preaching this she comes to
[49:00] me and runs to me says it was so
[49:01] refreshing to hear about
[49:03] salvation it was so refreshing to hear
[49:06] about these things in my mind I'm
[49:08] thinking what are you all preaching
[49:11] then because we are thinking that's
[49:13] their
[49:16] message and then I think it was there
[49:19] was like I don't know how many people
[49:20] kept coming brother Josh you were
[49:21] keeping I don't know if you were keeping
[49:22] count but people kept coming there I'm
[49:25] talking about not you message people
[49:26] people now none of your message people
[49:27] came to
[49:30] me you're all used to this kind of
[49:33] preaching everybody
[49:35] else was commenting on those things even
[49:39] a pastor that was there needed prayer
[49:43] amen so we he got shocked that we prayed
[49:45] for him right
[49:46] there because we don't preach the old
[49:49] word only but in power and in
[49:51] demonstration in fact he was going to
[49:53] his car what's he going for what
[49:55] transplant he's going for a kidney
[49:58] transplant when I heard that I said well
[50:01] if the angel of the Lord is here what
[50:04] better opportunity it is he was on his
[50:06] way to his car and said brother Joshua
[50:08] call him back here and right there we
[50:10] prayed for him
[50:12] amen I started to minister him and tell
[50:14] him how that God that any manufacturer
[50:17] carry spare
[50:19] parts amen he looked at me
[50:22] shocked I said any manufacturer carry
[50:25] spare parts and who who created you you
[50:28] created in the image and likeness of
[50:29] Goden and we're going to call on the
[50:31] manufacturer right now to give you a new
[50:33] kidney amen
[50:36] amen can we be bold it's our father's
[50:39] kingdom yes didn't he say it's the
[50:42] father's good pleasure to give you the
[50:43] kingdom I must
[50:45] wait for
[50:48] what the bride is thus say the Lord yes
[50:52] what are you waiting for you remember
[50:54] how the Lord rebuked Brother Bram he
[50:56] says why must you wait for a vision how
[50:59] long must
[51:01] I he says you have the
[51:04] word the word is higher than a vision
[51:07] the word is higher than some dream
[51:09] you've been commissioned go prophesy
[51:11] again you mean me you you you I'm just a
[51:16] young man no
[51:19] you you can light it
[51:24] up amen praise the Lord let's Stand
[51:26] Together Give the Lord hand clap of
[51:27] Praise
[51:30] amen hallelujah so those are some of the
[51:33] dangers that we Face we either come into
[51:36] adoption or we'll remain a
[51:43] son
[51:53] hallelujah thank you Jesus amen
[51:57] let's just worship him now amen after
[51:59] the preaching of the word it's a time of
[52:01] worship amen maybe the word seems like

[52:06] you you're not being shaped you're not
[52:09] being molded amen we're trying to get
[52:11] out everything now you remember the
[52:12] prophet says before as it's nearing The
