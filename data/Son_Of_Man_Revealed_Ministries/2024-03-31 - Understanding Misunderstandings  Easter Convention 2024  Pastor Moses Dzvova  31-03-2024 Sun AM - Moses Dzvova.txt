at eastle Tabernacle in Z in 2011 a year after his ordination he started a church from scratch amen never influence anybody he started from scratch in suburb 10 km from AR that's what the prophet of God said call God will give you somebody to preach to amen the name of the church is called revealed Word Fellowship prior to starting his own Ministry he has been doing a lot of missionary work in various cities and provinces of Zimbabwe including outside the country he's a firm believer of the Bible and the wonderful message brought To Us by Malachi 4 and loves both the mechanics and the

Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ how under expectation Hallelujah are you happy so we just want to go to the word hallelujah so let's read our Bibles under expectation like I was saying when time is prolonged corruption will set in so we we just want to avoid corruption today I want to salute all the ministers in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen amen so we just want to read John chapter 21 John chapter 21 verse 23 John 21 ver 23 John 21:23 God bless you for such wonderful singing am you know that deep goes unto that deep this is what we call Fellowship of K Spirits you know it's like I'm always here in Hallelujah I do not feel any resentment Hallelujah may God really Grant unto you your desires I am the list amen among the ministers in Zimbabwe amen it's just a grace of God that I'm standing here hallelujah so we appreciate all the pastors they've been taking care of me very well and I thank God they did not give me that Che amen so corruption did not set [Music] I but the pastors the organizers have been kind to me amen I really appreciate all of you hallelujah amen so John chter 21 John chapter 21 God bless you we always say Pastor Nami our Elder may God bless him and other Elders also so John chter 21 just want to go quickly while we are standing John 21 verse let's start from want to see let's start from verse 21 Peter seeing him said to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do Jesus said unto him if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow thou me you know there are people are always wanting to interfere with people issues that's why Jesus says what is that to you yes follow me Hallelujah but that's what my message verse 23 then went this same abroad among the Brethren that that disciple should not die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die do you see how many things have gone out in the message because of misunderstanding Jesus did not say that disciple was not going to die but he just said what is that to you if I will Notre till I come what is that to you so you see that is a very bad thing to misunderstand preached the message that God had been misunderstood and the prophet says even the messenger of the AG is going to be misunderstood even with real true ministers you know misunderstanding is a bad thing how many can say Amen there is a lot of sayings in the message but based on misunderstanding does churches movements you know they are many because of misunderstanding so this morning I just want to give a small title understanding misunderstandings how many say Amen we want to understand that misunderstanding can you say amen amen can you say hallelujah hallelujah understanding the misunderstanding do you love him amen so let's finish it says if I will that he T till I come what is that to the this is H the disciple which John which testified of these things and wrote these things and we knew that his testimonies is true may God His blessings to the reading of the word hallelujah do you love him so we just want to like I always say I just want to go straight to the point Hallelujah understanding misunderstandings am praise be to God do you love him you know when you read the Bible sometimes you know you find where the Bible says Jesus you find where the Bible says Judas HED himself and there is also another scripture which says do likewise oh my so you can end up hanging yourself yes life must be upon line precept upon pre and my brother my sister I realize that the evidence that you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a clear understanding of the message of your day how many believe that a clear understanding of the message of the hour is the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost how many say Amen am why am I saying this when he the Holy Ghost is come he will reveal these things that I told told you so the Holy Ghost does not only speak in tongues it does not only hear it does not only serve but the Holy Spirit also reveals the word the holy spirit is a revealer when he the Holy Ghost is come he will reveal these things amen that I told you amen do you love him are we together friends amen yes so you know Jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me so they did not understand it that's why he said pet he says whom to men say I the son of men am some say you are some say you are some say you are Moses you are this and that but he says but you whom do you say I the son of men am Hallelujah and Peter said Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God and you know I realize something when you know who he is he will reveal to you who you are when Peter said come at Christ huh he also said Thou Art Peter what say thou of thyself are you th one or shall we wait for another you know you must know your scriptural identification in the word how many can say Amen when they said who are you are you the one or shall we wait for another you know those people who were asking John the Baptist they knew his identity card they knew he was called John Zariah but when they said who are you are you the one or shall we ask for another they were asking for his scriptural identification are we together so he said I am the voice of one cry in the wilderness are we together my brother so you see that sister maor was more powerful than the Revival of his day are we together did not know the scriptural identification of brother they called him an evangelist they called him father how many can say Amen but one day you know brother did not want to marry sister and you know she was saying he was saying she's too good a woman to waste time with me maybe another brother my Mary and you know sister was not happy she loved brother so much and then she went to God to pray you know sometimes we bring couches in the message how many can say Amen are we together you know sister just came and started praying and said Lord do you see what bil is doing I love him but he's refusing to marry me are we together my brother Hallelujah and then while she was praying God came down and opened the Bible to malach 4 and then when she saw it was said behold I sent you Elijah the so I want you to see nobody can say Amen what is the connection she's praying for marriage she's praying for brother Bram but God refused to the scripture behold I sent you Elijah so sister knew the scriptural identification of William she knew this [Music] [Applause] is do you love him are you happy what sayest thou of thyself are you the one who shall wait for another Hallelujah you must start to show yourself approved a work that needed not to be ashamed rightly to fight in the way of Truth do you love him are you happy my brother my sister so sister who William Bram was yes can I say people in America Hallelujah H they knew William BR they hunted with him they fellowed with him but you and me are we together we did not see will we saw Malachi 4 there is a difference between Willam and Malachi 4 behold I sent you Elijah you see the Disciples of Paul Hallelujah the Disciples of Jesus they did not see they saw Jesus are we together but Paul did not see Jesus in the flesh listen among those disciples who had the audacity to rebuke Peter who was given the keys but Paul was born out of season why Paul did not see Jesus in the flesh Peter and them they saw Jesus the body but Paul saw Christ no God Jesus is only the body but Christ is the [Applause] anointing how many say you believe it friends even the prophet says the one that was talking to Abraham are we together that was not Jesus Jesus was not yet born the one that was talking to Abraham it was hallelujah how Jesus was not yet born the one that was talking to Abraham was Elohim and we don't he ofmore because became Jesus of the old test is the Jesus Christ of the New Testament can you say Amen can you say hallelujah hallelujah what is Jesus all the seals from the first SE to the seventh SE they just reveal Christ can I read that Christ is the mystery of God revealed hallelujah amen BL let with this quation marriage and divorce hallelujah amen 65221 A paragra 233 I like this quotation I know you are familiar with it he says but now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth direct us to the word now that you know that revelation of the seven is like a key it unlocks all the now the are open I can preach I'm now that the seals are open we can preach seven seed so the revelation of the Seven Seals unlocked some doctrinal issues but now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth direct us to the W that explains why all the mistakes has been down through the age Jesus because the seals was not opened this was not revealed yes it's true amen do you love it my brother how many I enjoy hallelujah amen praise be to God in the you see h i i i i i don't see maybe I did not h J it down but let me just qu it do you believe it he says he is the one that open those seals he is those seals so the whole of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals nameing Christ he is those he opened those seals Hallelujah so the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was [Applause] open all the cry the seals they reveal Christ hallelujah amen he say here church now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will take the heart of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven SE so what are the seven they are the revelations contained in the seven seal preaching the seal the revelation of the Seven Seals he was revealing the seven thers Hallelujah brother says here in the first seal okay we finish this he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thers in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be this divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so yesterday we said we are going back to e that's where the fall took place restoration is bringing back to the former state so the fall did not take place in Pentecost it did not take place in the days of Jesus the did not take place in Street the fall took place in Ed so we want to see what Eden was what was happening in Eden before the fallam was not praying in Eden but he was worshiping there is a difference between praying and worshiping when you are praying you are in a fallen state are we together you are begging God you are asking do this for me but when you are worshiping you are redeemed if you see a church of worshipers it's a church that is redeemed was open when John Hallelujah the L broke the SE the 24 and bound down and worship we are not called to pray but to worship father S as worship Him in truth and prayer came after the fall fasting came after the fall but from the beginning it was [Applause] s did not need to pray he was a God he was an am God if he wanted the lion to come he will speak the word will come if he wanted to divert the C of the river he would just say you go there the river will di if he wanted the mountain to move he would not PR Lord he will speak the word this is what we are supposed to do let to we speak word from the beginning it was it for this issue of praying this issue of fasting let's go back to it we are [Applause] God why cry speak and go forward are you redeemed are you redeemed John saw his name in the PO that's why he shouted we preach theal [Music] time Hallelujah there is a difference between praying and worshiping from the beginning it was it s before the four and the prophet says the possession of the book The Possession of the ABS TI It means that you and me how many can say Amen we have the same thing that Adam we possess the same power this is the season of speaking the way I always thought that people who cry too much in church they are spiritual that's what I thought but I realize that people who cry for marriages for jobs how many can say Amen do you believe it come here so one minute run run run run how many can say Amen do you see my brother here how old are your brother1 you see this brother he's 31 years old so if he wants a if he wants shoes if he wants a car from his father and

exactly why we just preaching R Truth you see people being healed you see people beinged you see things happening without steing people's emotions just preaching the word hallelujah the word of God is casting out of evil spirit preaching right now Dem are going evil spirit are going the preaching of the word is the casting out of evil spirit you love him amen hallelujah hallelujah so now what is the brother says the first is SE 263 we find what the thunder means he says that's perfectly we know that see the Thunder was the voice of God when the understanding understand it what is is the voice of God when a SE is open when Moses was talking to God they had Thunders lightning and everything but Moses was hearing a voice what is it's a voice of God when the seal is open and says here in questions and answers paragraph I think is it question 395 or he says if the seven thers which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed someone is asking Mali 4 if the seven what thers which equals seven Mysteries already revealed or were they revealed in the second seals but are yet not known to us as stands yet so the question is were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are not yet known to us as standers yet says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the was about they was to reveal H like I was saying yesterday I say you see a revelation contained in the Seven Seals so Pastor and all our pastors We Don't Preach the seals because a seal is only a container a seal cannot help you the book is not written the SE no is written the revelation of the seven s amen are we together so a seal is like a container right and the water inside is the ther how many can say Amen are we together a seal is a container carrying the th that Dively revealed M truth the seven th which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals like I gave an example to say if you pay 1,000 to Pastor a is your you put it in the envelope and Pastor Adrian prays for the envelope and then he goes to the fuel station to refuel his car yes and then he takes the envelope to give the petrol attendant no is that right no what must he do he must break the se he must break the envelope and take the 1 inside which is the now I want to ask what is important the SE or the what is important the SE or the ther Pastor how much is the bread 18 18 Grand so the bre is 18 so you now if you are hungry and you are holding 18 you value the bra more than 18 you are willing to go to a spor or shop right and forsake the 18 grand for the bread so I want to say you you are more important than the blood of Jesus Christ why because Jesus was willing to lose his own PA for you and me Miss [Applause] Jesus you are more important than the blood of Jesus because he was willing to lose his blood for you and me can you say h hallelujah hallelujah what is important the blood or the blind no some people are not answering can you say hallelujah hallelujah what is important 18 for bre are to love him can you say hallelujah hallelujah you are the Flesh of his flesh power of his power life of his life she is you are how many say you are flesh of his flesh power of his power life of his life you are you believe [Music] it [Music] Hallelujah to God you are not cheap you are Miss Jesus you will never go to hell I think about Hallelujah is that there is a certain I'm thinking of T right now you know T was waiting for his husband and T went to Judah and said no can you give me my my husband and Judah said no no no no no no huh I've got a younger child wait for you and then T waited but Judah did not give him the T said I fix him then T went disguised himself I disguising the truth not lying but disguising the truth so disguised as a prostitute and J is the weakness of women so when Jah passed by did not know that it was what her daughter-in-law and then Tama was pregnant and Tama said I want a kid yes and I don't have go now and said okay I know you man you will go I want my God so T said to prove that you are coming back leave me your Signet leave me your leave me your star and T took the three things yes I think it was the bracelet it was the ring it was the scar and then after some time they realize T is pregnant hey it was a serious issue and J said no no no no no no no we don't want prostitute in my house we must P up and they gathered the fire the day came and T said I don't refuse to be banned and T went there and while they were preparing to B her up th said before you B me up she lifted up the staff the owner of this staff is responsible for the [Applause] P I'm not yet through the of this pres was in trouble the own of this is respon responsible Judah looked at says you are more righteous than me and was paid why didn't she die she was caring Jah St Judah earing so you and me we are pregnant we will never reive any pregnancy we cannot go to hell if Jesus wants to to put us to H we will lift the church edges and say of this is responsible we lift the we will lift to Hallelujah of of is responsible Jesus say you you are more righteous Than Me Do you believe it you are the word you canot go to hell isible [Applause] Hallelujah if you don't have anything for Jesus you are in trouble you ask your do you have even a St do you have even a what what do you have what will save you is Judas St Judas Judas pres of the message of the of the churches the of things that to be hallelujah praise be to God I like I like [Applause] Hallelujah hallu amen hallu love am how many are you I love it amen God bless you Church Hall God bless you Pastor M and all the men of God that are inside there you are helping me it's not easy up here hallelujah if you don't oil the car it will knock so if you don't say amen I knock here I need your amens hallelujah praise the [Music] Lord preaching alone is not difficult preaching alone is very difficult and now if you don't say Amen you make it fair that amen how to make life easier for me you've been wonderful amen what is the a thunder it's a voice of God when a seal is open do you love him because I see there are many things here that are coming up so Jesus says except to eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me Hall so they said ah we are not vampires I'm talking about understanding misunderstanding so they thought Jesus wanted them to drink his blood or whatever so now I want you to see what it meant in the message communion amen 62 0204 paragraph 128 listen to what Malachi 4 says now is explaining why Jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood now let me close in saying this one word now before we go to the communion table he says the blood so now brother is showing us the equation of eternal life do you want to know the equation of eternal life what constitut eternal life says the blood the blood and the body of the Lord yes mixed with faith yes that's the blood and the body that's the spirit and the word mixed with Fai equals eternal life some people got the spirit only without the word it's not enough some people have got the word without the spirit it's not us the represented the word the blood represented the spirit so he says the blood how many say and the body mixed with your faith equals eternal life Hallelujah those who re the of God it did not profit in them because they did not mix the word they received with their Fai so everything that I was preaching from Friday Saturday and today you must mix it with your fa hallelu what is iternal life the word and the spirit mixed with your faith hallelujah hallelujah believe again do you love Mal are you glad do you want etal life hallelujah amen glory the blood yes and the body of the Lord mixed with faith that's the blood and the body that's the spirit and the we mixed with faith equals our life that eats my flesh and drinks my blood that's the real communion when we are partaking of communion we eating the body yes and the spirit yes mixing with our faith amen so in other words when you saying except he was talking about communion hallelujah amen he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood is eternal life and I will raise you up at the last day there you are what is it the communion of the Lord hallelujah the word and the spirit H this is this life is in the blood the word and the spirit equals Life by faith in the Lord hallelujah can I repeat it again the word and the spirit this life is in the pl the word and the spirit equals eternal life by faith in the Lord amen hallelujah praise be to God glory except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no power you have no life are we together amen understanding misunderstanding do you love him the prophet says here says is this the sign yes is this the sign of the Ed say paragraph 26 he says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation yes but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did what a statement huh Hallelujah the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same words and you know this scripture this quotation does not refer to the new bed yes I said said the Holy Ghost it grows from adoption you remember L received the Holy Ghost but it was not in the dep that you and me received it if you are asked to write a a an essay or whatever you are asked what is the Holy Ghost and they say it carries 40 mons if you say the Holy Ghost is justification you get Z you will get 10 justification is the work of the Holy Ghost if you say the Holy Ghost is sanctification you will get 20 you won't fail yes because sanctification it is now going higher the same Holy Ghost go growing are we together if you say the Holy Ghost is the new p h you get PA but if you say the Holy Ghost is adoption the Holy Ghost is the talking it's the clim Hallelujah so when he says the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the work that he did so he refers to listen if you are born again with a new bed every bed is a mess you will cry you will shout do you hear what I'm saying but this quotation is not referring to the new B is referring to the adoption am when you are really mature yes don't Shout say in Jesus come no if you SE Jesus you are seated in the Rock the fullness of God he was anointed with the Holy Spirit without measure but he never shouted to say bless bless no you just saying blessed blessed are you when men revile you real power you don't jump around you don't shout did you seeing lock down you see President Raposa announcing trip Nation to the nation announcing serious things you was shouting to say 6:00 you are going to see who I am you must be in the lock down you start no you say good

your pastors is preaching the way stay there Hall don't look for Fantastics I want to ask you which church was powerful if you were living in the days of Paul which church were you going to choose the Corinthian Church or the Ephesians in the Corinthian Church there was power yes healing Dynamics times and everything and there was also yes sisters also wanted to preach there was also you know TV some saying someone saying I'm of Apollos so Paul did not teach deep things in the Corinthians but when he came to the epesi you was preaching adoption you was preaching predestination you don't know what power is to ask Pastor Adrian which church was powerful in Egypt the Egyptians huh let's say it was their Church in Egypt they they were powerful Miracles one day PL one day PL the whole country are we together and they pray and Moses comes and they they he removes the blood they say oh what a Revival and then they go to the Church of God hble Church in go and they say you people your church is dead man you have nothing you people yesterday we saw frogs the whole country and then we prayed and Moses removed the frogs you you are seeing nothing after some time boils everyone boils and then they pray for a healing and they receive their healing but the children of Israel in caution there was nothing but who was powerful I'm talking about the power of prevention the children of Israel in gotion you don't have to be Seck HH for you to be prayed for but the children of Israel had the power not to be SI we we do not see the boils we do not see all these things how say who was powerful those ones in Egypt the children of you he my brother my sister there was no sickness until the Bible says 40 years with one jacket the power the presence of God was there when someone is putting size

Jezebel called the fire and everything and said Lord hallelujah let me go God said no Elijah you have not yet finished there is still a ordained to be anointed king of Syria there is still the son of n are we together to be ordained Propet to be ordained king in Israel there is Elijah the son of Sha of to be anointed prophet in your state amen so listen friends God told Elijah that you are supposed to and Elijah Elijah anointed Elijah and he went [Music] away so who anointed ja who anointed [Applause] as I'm saying God he said Elijah you must anoint as to be k [Applause] in Israel and you must anoint Elijah the son of Sha of I like the Bible and do you know that eveni was in the Bible I come from Hari I'm a harite sh the son of a right do you believe it I like Bible that be night be night that night go the Bible it says sh the son ofes the son of you love him so let's read here 2 Kings chapter 9 how many been blessed I really fear corruption today but we are going close don't wor I can even Second Kings do you love him a second Kings 9 who anointed and jail the Bible says ver 9 Second Kings 9 and Elijah the prophet called one of the children of the Prophet yeah so Elijah was anointed aah and they were anointed by one of the sons of the prophets so there are some things that say not do that no brother Adrian the son of the Prophet fulf it but when brother adri does it it's good [Music] [Applause] brother son of the Prophet It Was Elijah and the son of the Prophet the spirit of el Hallelujah do you hear my brother my sister do you believe that hallelujah what was the Holy Ghost given for it was given to continue with the work which not left so we are here to finish to complete Hallelujah sometimes you say where did you get that where did you get that way you are going to see there are things that we pre sometimes that we can't even explain yes I want to show you brother Paul God bless you for June 2024 Hallelujah listen he says and Elijah the prophet called one of the children of the prophet and said unto him get up thy Lo and take this box of oil in thine what hand and go to R Gilead listen I want you to see the instruction he's told to go to R Gilead with oil and he says and when thou comest look out there the son of jeos the son of nimi and go in and make him arise up among his Breen and carry him to an inner chamber do you see the exception when you arrive there take jail in the inner chamber verse three then take the box of oil I like this and and put it on his head and say th say the Lord I have Anointed The King over Israel who is anointing the son of the Prophet who is under the anointing and the Hallelujah of [Music] el so who anointed it's not the son of a prophet it's Elijah it's the spirit of Elijah I have Anointed The King over Israel listen to this after you anointed them then open the door and flee and T not but this man instead of opening that door and running away he starts preing his own things he start saying so the young man even the young man of the Prophet went to ra and when he came behold the captains of the host sitting and he said I have been to thee Oh Captain and Je said unto which one of all us and he said to thee o and he arose and went in into the house and ped exactly like the instruction and poured the oil on his head and said unto him thus say the Lord God of Israel I have anointed thee King over my the people of the Lord even over Israel he was supposed to open the door and go after this according to the instructions but verse seven is now under a certain inspiration and he starting to say and th shall SM the house was he told all this no the house of you see so sometimes you hear people preaching and then where are they getting it can I say this the prophet says say what the says saying what the says does not mean repeating word for word it means preach the message but don't change the context youe it in any way so the young man is continuing I you see he's talking about the Judgment the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the Servants of the Lord at the end of Jezebel for the whole house of Shall Perish and our c can you imagine is not about the other prophecies and then verse 10 and he says and the dogs shall eat jeel in the portion ofz there shall be none to Buri and he opened the door and fled Hallelujah so if you ask me where were you getting these things I'll just open the door and go how many amen we are going to close do you love him let me just find how many were blessed amen Hall understanding misunderstandings
