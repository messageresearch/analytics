TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and peace thank you father thank you lord jesus also we think of sean and his family father prayer to bless our dear sister and children amen thank you father for this family i love my brother sean father for the testimony we have of him yet lord i know he is rejoicing on the other side amen you're all god before us [Music] thank you amen amen not be as what i should have been i trust you'll be blessed by some few words i can have my memory back because i get a shot of memory very fast so you please excuse me i'd like to take this opportunity to thank pastor agent for allowing me to share this special moment i would also like to apologize that i was not able to come for the funeral because of the challenges that i was facing at the time i cannot express the pain i started losing so many postures i've been longing to see the believers to express condolences i was born in 1944 i got married in 1963 very young i received the message in 1967 and started the philippines in chapter 23. i got a call from pastor ronnie in 1975 to let you know that actually we are family so at that time i had the opportunity of saying hello and i went wearing a tight pens i said there's only one thing that's going to keep this brother away from the message he's his wife adulties work together i looked at him i said why are you sad he said not again my son baby boy only a couple of days to live i said no don't worry jump into the van let's go didn't worry about lunch or anything he went up there if i make speed face maybe under correction got up to the hospital found him in the incubator [Music] these were my words i said if you the god of elijah the prophet of our day and age for the glory of god hallelujah but he suddenly raised up i think they got discharged passing death on the child with past life amen because of god's powerful word oh thank you lord and we always give the glory to jesus yes amen from then onwards pastor ronnie was very faithful in coming to services another day that we had the real type of team to take that tape and give [Music] [Music] we've got to be a very good family accepting the message and fully surrendering to the world [Music] you didn't break away from me yeah amen i don't like brickworks i don't like dislikes and likes i don't like to inside with anybody i like and i found that he's really sincere with the word i used to go out a lot with him i had campaigns everywhere with the 10th meeting in chatham i went to the father easter east victoria i got a campaign there it was one of the biggest churches and then i went to lodi where the muslims are living i probably think there what a challenge i had from the people [Music] and i preached the message leave not because there was a wealthy man there who said he never played tight for a couple of months he got a big check to give and he felt that i was a young man he'd like to give me the check i said don't give me the check those days we were not in for money no offerings i'll never take an offering around my 10th pt never took one i believed like brother so i said you don't give me any money or any trip or anything just come to the services first that's the night i preached not on your own understanding and he took us for supper he said i'm very disappointed as a young man the way you lashing out the people you're making them instead of coming closer to christ [Music] so that was his end that was the end of him from there you see that my wife and i are alone pitching the tent ourselves i used to go only my wife but god would provide the men michael henry was in the area after i went he said you came you bit me on the drop let me help you for the tent where's your men doing to the tent i said no god in my helper but he did the job with these men put the tent and just left between the wall my wife and i put the walls to the tent and we used to see the power of the message amen if you don't mind [Music] yeah so we got onto the message and started working for the lord i had a hard job at the beginning because i was working for a company that uh gave me the van and the assistant to carry the message around that's how god made it possible i went to townships never fear any blacks you had to township something running for the life you would have told you you've been to townships and we've been to places where it was very dangerous i tried to establish a message in the ultimate parts of the earth and the thing is that we've been so [Music] you're broken down by because of so many things happening in life and when we got to a place we didn't care where we're going to sleep what we're going to eat what we're going to do we always just kept the message alive thank you i remember one of the meetings we got that night and we ended up in a room do you know what what room what place it was my wife and i just was so tired traveling for hours we just parked the combi and we just got into the house and they were shown the room to us with the matters on the floor with holes in the side i don't really know running or what was running because we couldn't feel nothing we were too tired to worry about anything we got up the next morning in london this was my experience we got up the morning then only we found where we were sleeping it didn't bother me i used to sometimes go without meals because i was battling that at that time and we used to just struggle i used to go sometime fast and make an excuse i'm always full i used to fast in a couple of days and then preach the word every night in the tent for seven nights ten nights in a row i used to preach this this particular morning one of the neighbor men came to us and said are you the evangelist from devon i said no i'm just a brother from there and came to share the word [Music] so he says with your luggages i said they're sitting on the corner they're in the room he took it he went there he took the luggages he took us he took us and he gave us his bedroom [Music] and he said don't worry for lunch and supper you'll be supplying food also [Music] i said no don't take that problem please bro i'm well aware god will make your way but he said no that's from my heart the lord told me i'm going to do that for you so for five days he looked after us and he cared for us i'm just showing you how god can care for him and he took care of us sometimes i didn't know if i'm coming back home to durban because i didn't have money for fear [Music] from nowhere somebody would come and give me 58 for fuel 58 fuel that time you could travel from billboard to derby but today with 500 you can't go to even dearly yeah [Music] so when i'm talking he was think of me i'm talking from the old man if you get a chicken to eat it's like you got christmas bonus that's how tough it was life [Music] so when i came back to dublin i intended to do india as a 222 countries in india just getting off the plane and going into the pulpit and getting out of the corporate and going and lying down for two hours and catching the next plane and going to the next place and the brothers all at the books that's how i knew the airport who was waiting for me and i've been through america canada all these places working with the brothers and sisters faithfully not trying to break up the work amen always trying to build up the world yes amen you must look for builders don't look for breakfast amen amen and i trust god who bless us with the same spirit with the same attitude amen amen willing to help each other yes standing by [Music] don't get involved with politics there's too much of politics how did i receive the message i'm going back to front what happened was i was working in the laundry spotless dry cleaners the name is spotless hey man and we kept up to the knee one thing our company did keep up with the name for the well-established company i happen to run the dipole that time when you run the dipole you got to wash the floor polish the floor clean everything all that you gotta do in the job before you get paid [Music] so it's quite a busy laundry depot and when i was busy i had some friends a lot of friends i had and one of them was a mystery i don't know if you know history mishi was a good friend of mine his family was a good family to me he used to come to the depot every time then one day he passed by he said hey look i got some book here he gave me some books and i took it and put it underneath this table [Music] i forgot fasting for seven days and nights we should fast and pray we should not just take things lightly amen like today in the message everything is likely no seriousness you must be serious about this because this is eternal life so i was fasting for seven nights a day and my brother mark you know him he also was fasting with me and they were talking about predestination we were talking about fore knowledge how god knew us before the foundation of the world and when i sat down one day my last day in fasting something said to me take one of these books and then took it i took the book and i looked and i read the ear and their bit i said is this man speaking like our language [Music] i just talked to this man i took him as a man i said he sounds good man looks the the words and everything looks like something here for me you know there's a deep calling behind that so i responded to the call and when i got through with the book i was excited i was so excited that i felt that this is a prophet after that i said amen and they found me and they said to me they brought a film to shirt people call it the deep we added the flip shown in one of the houses on home i think brother mark zone and we had it shown after that they got together and had tea so i asked him they asked me what do you think about the film i said he's standing like noah on the door and warning that god wanting the judgment follow this we don't accept this message i think we're gonna be destroyed funny enough they didn't take it like that so seriously they just showed the film when they went away yeah i agreed to carry on on my own so the first house that i was opening the guy who gave me the book he opened his garage door [Music] wasn't anything i had because i had [Music] [Music] but in the end when i found jesus everything is love my mother used to get the spirits the thing that worried me about the spirits they tried to destroy other people's lives i don't know why i get through this thing testy and dry now you should drink water the water was like [Music] my father used to welcome to my mother while she was in a spiritual mood i was sitting i was a little boy and i was in the temple watching what was going on [Music] they used to say you know what the neighbors are doing this and that you know to get rid of them you must do something you could blow this kind of powder or some kind of ashes [Music] now that got me worried why would god create something to create evil and the head of the ladies had to be worshipped temple i said i saw this you know gave me what is these things that's why when i got to the world and saw the faith of jesus christ i was ready to accept it amen because i saw something really yeah this message is so real my brother my sister you won't be able to contain it before time runs away on me is there anything else you'd like to hear any experiences [Music] i would like to share some scripture with you before an important part of the scriptures i never wanted to believe in a church but the problem was against organizations and churches because the way they were drawing the people drawing lines so in the end i bought a property in hillary with the house on it and i thought what must i do now i literated the house out and i had a piece of ground lying there and one day i was sitting in my lounge something said to me you ain't win damn grand ham why didn't you build a little cottage or some place for the people to fellowship i've blessed you financially i bless you materially but you haven't given enough so i took up on myself to go to the church amen and i built the church i was working day and night at the church site you saw in the payload and everything yes so i got the church completed we had to get together i don't know if i invited all of you i can't do it i must have i couldn't have [Music] people come and go quickly in this message one little thing you say you turn the last stop in a treat they'll get all upset but those days you can ask grace we used to preach hard [Music] hard like a rock right you can't stand anything that's not right yeah i started to work in kongnami amongst the blacks we would work in nagoma we played in nagoma we should sleep in the arts each of the people in the tires sleep in the family and everything our boys here used to go away when they were babies the black sisters used to take them away and only bring them at midnight home we should trust them so much they should bring your children at midnight back to us and knock at the door but by midnight we ship talking those days we used to spend two o'clock three in the morning talking about the message till the morning every day and getting up six o'clock for work but if you get up us four to go to work because you have to open the laundry six o'clock in the morning only one two hours we sleep and we go and we continue with the message like that amen night after night it was sweet like honey in our tongue but today you go a little bit over time people watching the watch 45 minutes is fine but imagine the prophet of god praying for four thousand people in one night because his sock was socks was tired sucked to his feet and he once said one place i heard him say he was preaching for eight nights day and night yeah imagine how prophet really went through and he said he always leaves uh three o'clock to go and pray and never comes back until the meeting is starting lots of things the prophet did amen i'd like to read a scripture it's in john chapter 10. i don't want look at john 10 30. i and my father are one and the jews took up stones man john 10 13 is that right amen right then the jews took up stones you're going to stone me you know there's a new doctrine going about there's two jesuses or something yeah but do you remember god is one amen amen we listen to you amen jesus answered them and said many more good works have i showed you from my father for which of course your works really stoned me so you were doing it really the jews answered accidents said jesus answered saying for a good work we do strongly not but for blasphemy and we because thou being and man because they shall god jesus said to them is it not written in your law i said we are gods [Music] amen now some people think we are going a little bit crazy to the extent that we keep using the brain in the name amen his being is here many people didn't understand what he said amen he was in a different dimension [Music] his dimension caught him to see spiritual things and you would see the presence of the lord right there he's being here how can he have been here unless he has a person a person you've only ever been be a beam b ingb is being in a man anointing is on me on you the writing is in you that day that jesus that day was jesus flesh god redeemer today spirit god in the flesh working through human flesh his being is a spiritual being amen jews killed jesus god made flesh to call out that from them out of jerusalem judaism to the true lamb of god rejected and killed him came to his own and his own received him not same thing today word mean flesh to call the gentile bride for for his namesake what did they do they rejected and killed [Music] the word yes the true word made flesh spiritual bleeding word two comings one in the flesh one in the spiritual accepted dogmas and peace instead of that day god will make flesh amen god manifested in human fish thought working in human being flesh again amen as the son of man amen i will say something but that you must misunderstand me in the unveiling of god which is to disclose our doctor exposed on unreal amen in page 15 i'm reading of god so it was god formed in a man called a prophet see and the word of your lord came to this man so it wasn't the prophet amen the prophet was the real yes but the word was good amen yes the man's word wouldn't act like this see what i mean it cannot act in there in that way many but potentially it was god amen he was the word of god in a form of a man called a man [Music] he never changed his nature how is form amen page 21 and this is the editing part quote movie said the word now remember after the word was made manifest all this was moses again so there was a time where the word was in brotherhood the time of ministry changed that's right god took one redeemed man amen work of redemption has two two words yes one issue one is to clean yes reclaiming ministry was given to over to i'm putting plain to your husband [Music] he had to do the claiming that's why the lamb came and took the book he's no physical lamb at all it's a spiritual happening right taking the book and opening the sea who did that it looks like somebody came from heaven and did that no it was the same man called william made it brand new amen yes but listen to this quote it will help you page 21. after the word was made manifest moses was moses again but while that word was in him to be cured out he was god [Music] right depending on what you can see amen because what i see is different to maybe what you see you're seeing your wheel but like you've got to receive beyond amen who are you dealing with yes you're dealing with god yes right to give out the he was god well he went it wasn't moses no more he had the word of the lord for that age amen nothing could touch him till that word was over had the word with thee so therefore when you come the people tend that their face heads this was the same experience they had with brother brennan understand truly they had been changed he was a he was a different fellow he comes with the word and he put his weight on him the bible said if moses had to put away brother and sister what do you think without message we have to do he had the word and he was the word in them [Music] you are the word to them amen i was preaching in 1992 [Music] from the son of man [Music] god showed me the ministry of the prophet more than a man the other coat is one like he was in moses when the word was in moses he was god in flesh amen so for you to say brother branham was not god in fresh he'd be defeating the purpose because there was a time that he went to the west caught up with the seventh day ministry came down not two angels now one injured only can be done and he was connected with an earthly angel heavenly angel connected with earth amen became one not two then you are believing in two gods again so you have to believe in one god [Music] when it was in jesus it was god in flesh amen not his nature is the same history today and forever he changed from moses to david from david to joseph on down then they came into the fullness of the goddamn body amen amen the bodily the fullness of the goddess couldn't be completed until the ministry of the son of man [Music] you see always brother brandon reading evil chapter one he's going to the beginning before the beginning [Music] was there [Music] this day the scripture is fulfilled you see we gentiles didn't receive a messiah yes the messiah signed was only through yeah calling out a name not under the name of william graham calling it the people out of the gentiles for his namesake was the ministry of the son of man so we become messiahs yes and today halloween was here brother with the bride we were not looking for a messiah see where brother places his ministry but those who claim to be looking for him the church itself when they seen that was done they said he's a devil he's a fortune trainer a baltimore and jesus said that sin will be forgiven there because he hadn't died yet but we need some day when the holy ghost comes see this very being the holy ghost itself had to come and one vindicated ministry and that ministry was only fulfilled by coming back and fulfilling it in the son of man amen amen someday the holy ghost will come and do the same thing and to speak one word against it will never be forgiven amen that's this day with the romans where every word has to be together speak one word against it will never be forgiven in the world to come that was jesus yesterday that's him today [Music] i'll just close now i get very conscious you know worrying about kids and children and babies he's referring to genesis 22. he called this man the name of hillary why did you do it god reprising human flesh i sat down with abraham and ate the sandwich drinking some milk and eating some corn god himself and disappeared right before even the same sign has come back to us the seventh series is coming amen it can't be in a corporate body but he's here in a spiritual body in the form of the holy spirit i would love to see him well now how can you see him the way we can see him is by his works amen no he hasn't come in a cochlear body yet and one is on us he's here in the spiritual body yes you believe that he's feeling that word called the holy spirit he's in the form of amen so there was only one way for the holy spirit to reveal himself was to work through a body of flesh that was the first of the beginning amen that the first sheep will get an idea of what pedestrian ships will get when they win that day it was flesh god today it spirit god in flesh [Music] that's my understanding brother sister yeah in the beginning god was a spirit and all the fountain of the life says from then the lord is that went out of god in the beginning become what we would call a theocra [Music] a supernatural body living in two dimensions while he was on this earth yeah yes amen it's really hard for people to solve that yes because you never even put you down on that brother's brothers yes yeah but they took the hand and fitted it exactly like a glove into them i don't want to say any more things because the spiritual body call you the holy spirit like devils want to work they work through your body yeah that's right so the holy spirit must work through it and the only way we know the holy spirit working through your body i think i'll call it i'm today thankful to be here sad that i can't see pastor ronnie and we'll meet up together amen that's a consolation we have sister grace amen [Music] knows amen we thank god for keeping us thus far yes i cannot believe why i can't do what i used to do i'm such a fit person and i feel discouraged very much um everywhere i went my wife used to go with me gracious amen so thank you mr adrian for this opportunity i appreciate your 70 and the believers for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words but look like i took a long time now please forgive me the venom says you can have every kind of gift but if you haven't got love everything falls apart everything gets broken yes amen just express love from today i'm saying you didn't express love but try to be as kind you can't really personally amen thank you this love is only the real man although you haven't got the opportunity yes god bless amen [Applause] amen you appreciate the testimony amen amen and the encouragement of the word of the lord amen amen let's stand together let's give our brother uh rather applause amen amen being able to stand firm on the word of god never wavering amen so you know that's a predestinated seed but the brandon says once he sees the light of the message nothing can shake him away from it amen hallelujah like the brother said it's deep calling to the deep amen and they've got to be a deep within us to respond to the deep amen aren't you thankful that we came predestinated from heaven amen in the eternal thoughts of god he thought of you and i amen let's sing i'm only in this message by grace it is only by grace that i am standing here in this place amen i don't know why my lord god chose me but i'm thankful anyway amen blessed be the name of the lord amen hallelujah [Music] you know it's something to stand in the presence of great men of god and i don't know about you but that's the way i feel this morning amen being a part of what god has done in durban south africa amen and we are so privileged and honored to have you with us today pastor dan amen will bless you may the lord restore virtue to you [Music] i'm only in this message by grace and it is only by grace i'm in this place i don't know how my lord god chose me but i'm thankful

maggie sachintha and all the saints that have gone before in young bodies the bible says we which are alive and remain our bodies shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen aren't you you know that's something this body is getting old every day it's getting old and decaying you can be hiding it behind a nice perfume and nice clothes but you're getting old every day it's letting you down sometimes you talk to yourself and say what's the matter with you letting me down you try and dye your hair and make yourself look a bit presentable but one of these days we'd only die amen we're going to get a full set of hair again we're going to be back to our youth again amen and that's the promise of eternal life amen that the lord has given to us amen so god bless you you don't

stay here i just want to get some pictures with you with the ministry amen [Music] these are the ministers in our churches amen thank you [Music] okay [Music] praise the lord saints greet you in the lovely name jesus christ our [Music] you know sometimes even when you get emotional you think of the past and you know for men like these who stood the chest of times yes princess gospel night and day and you know i've heard pastor dan preaching many times but the first time i i i went to the service in united i just came into the message at the time and i was all bubbly and you know because it was something that we never had experienced in the denomination it was something that we always wanted you know if you if you had a desire for god there would be a desire in your heart amen you'll always be seeking because he says seek and you shall find amen and nothing can satisfy you if you're the seed of god nothing can satisfy you except you receive the word of god amen and the first day i came into this message and then i heard of so many names and stuff like that and the first time i came to pass the dance church you know i was so happy and you know it was in the classroom then unit three and uh i came with pastor jaggi and all of us were just basically new at that time and that pasta dan is so so right in saying that you know we never ceased we'll never cease to worship god because two o'clock in the morning you would be still sitting and talking the sisters will be so joyful making coffee and scones and the rest of the things you know and we would just go on time was like nothing for us we go to the beach in the night we will pray at the beach for the next morning service we go on the grounds and pray in the ground for the next morning service for the next day and you know like we never felt tired that's true four o'clock three year i used to get up like that and said i used to get up at four o'clock in the morning to go catch a train because we didn't have transport we also came from that same line in those days there were not rich people you know we had hard time like he said if you want a chicken you know that meant christmas came yeah if you had mutton or it made the easter came it was like that tin fish was our delicacy and you know i want to say i went the first time and i tell you i listened to that message it was just so touchy but before that message i got rebuked praise the lord amen you know if you cannot take a rebuke yeah then you must remember there's something wrong yeah and uh you know when you when you first come to the message and you think you're coming from the denomination you know and i want because you know you you're so so waked up now because you've got something new yeah you're like a child when you get a toy you know it's something new in you and you you you plan it and you start to want to to want to show other people you know and then i think i took some of pastor dan's time you know it took so long past the dance time so i sing a song i can still remember you know it was near them i got to leave you know and then the first man came to the pool and he says you know if you want to do an item you're really there at the deacon and the deacon will make you give an item and it was good yeah because when you read the message and you say that's exactly what the prophet said you know and we had a lot of experiences i don't know i mean all of us are getting old and you are 80 years my senior and i don't want to tell you my age so you know we used to go to bdc for the combined meetings and we
