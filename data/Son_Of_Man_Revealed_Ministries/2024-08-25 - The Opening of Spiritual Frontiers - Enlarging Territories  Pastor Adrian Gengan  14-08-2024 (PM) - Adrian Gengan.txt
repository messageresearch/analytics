him a good anle of Praise is worthy amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord to worship him and to give him praise amen hallelujah amen let's turn to our Bibles I greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen I'd like to speak on the opening of spiritual Frontiers amen amen am the opening of spiritual Frontiers amen amen enlarging territories hallelujah amen maybe you settled in the way things are being run amen but we are about to enlarge territories amen you know when you're in large territories you need greater forces to protect those territories amen so we've got to open up spiritual Frontiers at this time hallelujah praise the Lord let's turn to 1 Chronicles chap 4 Hallelujah you don't get nervous amen amen amen you just pull out your weapon of amen amen yes you pull out your praise as the word is being preached amen hallelujah let the captain of the host run tonight amen thank 1 Chronicles 4:9 says and jabz was more honorable than his Brethren and his mother called his name jabz saying because I bear him with sorrow and jabes called on the god of Israel saying oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed oh yes I like this man yes amen yes God doesn't come to him he's calling to God In Prayer but he's got a vision for his life I'm like the prophet I like a man with vision he says oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed and enlarge my Coast amen that word means to enlarge my territory yes amen and that thine hand might be with me and that thou wouldest Keep Me From Evil amen and that it may not grieve me and God granted him that which he requested amen hallelujah amen amen so this man we know found favor in the eyes of God Amen let's turn to Matthew 7 and: 7 to see how God answered his prayer yeah our lord Jesus will tell us how he answers prayer now what did the first thing jbz did he asked of the Lord amen Matthew 7:7 says ask and it shall be given you amen seek you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you yes hey we're knocking on some gates of hell this evening they don't want to open we're going to blast it open yes amen yes Lord and for every one of you that ask it receiveth yes and he that seeketh find it amen and to him that knocketh it shall be opened for what man is there of you whom if he son ask bread will he give him a stone or if you ask a fish will he give him a serpent if he then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him amen so we can see how God answered ja's prayer there one more scripture then you can be seated in 1 John chapter 5 now we can't go ask feebly we've got to ask with confidence amen as this next verse will tell us and this is the confidence that we have in him that we ask anything according according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we have desired of him amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word amen praise the Lord amen amen you just be still and you know that he is God tonight but when I'm saying still I don't mean don't don't say Amen right don't get me wrong Hallelujah if God is going to enlarge our territory I'm asking you tonight to make room oh yes amen hallelujah hallelujah amen sometimes it's not that we need more of the Holy Ghost we need to empty out ourselves yes amen we need to let go of our will amen and then the Holy Ghost can work through US amen hallelujah amen so everyone's at the post of Duty tonight amen we thank God for that amen amen hallelujah amen so we know that our physical lives are interwoven with our spiritual self we are flesh and we are Spirit we are flesh we are spirit and we are soul we are three-part being yes amen but we function as one unit amen amen if your spirit had to leave your body right now you'll be considered dead Hallelujah so we function as one unit amen so if we want to have spiritual victories in our lives how many wants to have spiritual victories in our lives this evening we've got to follow the Holy Ghost who is our leader and operate by spiritual laws amen because in this war that we in There Are Rules of Engagement and we've got to fight according to the rules amen hallelujah we are engaging enemy forces we are going Behind Enemy Lines amen amen and we must possess the authority of the father to engage in Warfare therefore we are seeking adoption because adoption places Us in Authority adoption places us in our sunship Authority amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen so we're going Behind Enemy Lines we must carry the authority of our father meaning we must carry the authority of his name yes amen so though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh and the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 there is no condemnation to us who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen amen now what are the meaning of gates spiritual meaning of gates we know that in the natural a gate is something you enter through amen so a gate can be a portal hallelujah amen amen and in infuence From Another World a Gateway a portal open up to us so gates are something we enter through but it is also for protection and defense amen the same is true spiritually every person has gates to their soul to their spirit and to their body amen amen if we allow Satan to enter through these Gates amen he will have a time with us amen hallelujah the word tells us that when we receive Jesus Christ we are sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise meaning the holy spirit is our gate it's the gateway to our spirit amen and the moment we become vexed in our spirit with evil spirits you must know that something is wrong that our protection is gone our seal is gone amen so the gates to our spiritual realm are closed when our spirit becomes a new creation amen God shut the gates on the enemy amen that's called the Gates of Heaven we are protected by the word we are protected by the Holy Spirit we are protected amen by every force and every weapon that God has given us yes amen amen we will be defeated if we are not staying behind the Gates that's right Hallelujah and the prophet teaches us don't go on the enemy's grounds don't go onto its territory hallelujah amen so we know that the enemy according to St John chapter 10:10 easy scripture to remember John chap 10:10 the enemy comes to steal to kill yes and Destroy so what does he steal first he tactic he steals the word Garden of Eden he steals the word then he can kill because the word is our protection amen so if he steals the word he can kill and once he kills he can destroy yeah you see he's not just happy with killing he wants to destroy the children of God Amen because he knows his success depends on us not coming to the manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God he knows if he keeps us in religion he knows if he keeps us just happy with certain portions of the world that he can still run his kingdom but when Sons and Daughters of God are coming into the position he knows his kingdom is over amen amen yes Lord amen that which she stole from Adam and Eve our father and our mother we as the Sons The Descendants are taking back amen because what was taken from them in the Garden of Eden we have taken it back now in Revelation chap 10 thank you Lord meaning that we have the legal Authority we have the title deed in our hands amen and when we are reading the title deed amen we are reading Adam saying I lost eternal life but I'm giving it to you who are there standing in Revelation 10 amen I lost power over the Earth but I'm giving it to you who are taking it back in Revelation 10 amen I lost amen Dominion but I'm giving it to you my children who are there in Revelation 10 amen hallelujah amen we are reading the title deed oh yes Hallelujah and you know what we are not gloomy about it we see our possession and we are taking back we are taking back Dominion we are taking back our family we are taking back our children we are taking back our loved ones we are saying like lot not one of them will be lost hallelujah amen Matthew 11:12 says the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force don't allow Satan's kingdom to be more violent than you amen the violent take it by force praise the Lord amen the prophet tells us then when all hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose also when you reading there in Revelation chapter 6 verse 8 that under that fourth seal that was ride on the horse is called Death and All Hell Followed him don't be disheartened because Revelation 10 all of Heaven is coming down amen amen Heaven has a host of army it has an angel army yes amen that's why Revelation 8 there is Sil in heaven the battle has now come to the Earth yes Hallelujah the battle is hot and heavy and we must fight if we must win yes amen amen footsteps mean possession meaning our footsteps are not backward but our footsteps are forward amen marching on with Christian Soldiers amen hallelujah so Jesus tells us he says I tell you the truth I am the gate for the Sheep oh what a gate to have amen what a gate to have when Satan comes knocking at your gate he sees Jesus at the Gat amen he says all whoever come before me with thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not listen to them I am the gate whoever enters through me will be saved he will come in and go out and find pasture amen now how many if you know every time Benjamin Netanyahu comes and he gives a speech he has one famous saying Israel has a right to defend yourself amen how many of you heard him saying that you'll hear them saying time after time even you'll find the American president saying that Israel has a right to defend themselves how about spiritual Israel we have a right to defend ourselves amen hallelujah we don't have to give into every attack of the enemy amen so in our Christian Life there comes a time when we are called to stretch beyond our current boundaries our current territories like what's happening now we asking you to stretch beyond your message theology amen we asking you to open up new spiritual Frontiers amen amen praise the Lord and trust God for greater things even in your life and step into the fullness of his promise amen hallelujah so we we're looking at this powerful prayer from J be and we see there how it connects with the principles found in Matthew chapter 7 and 1 John 5 talking about prayer these scriptures are revealing that God is willing and able to expand our spiritual territory when we seek him with faith and Alignment to his will amen amen amen now Jaz is not a popular name we don't know much about it other than these few verses he's not spoken about much so jabz amen is somebody the B declares he more honorable than his Brethren meaning he's not somebody of high rank he's not notable amongst the Kings Hallelujah but the Bible is saying he was more honorable than his Brethren despite his name name meaning sorrow but jabus sought God's blessing with a fervent heart he said oh that thou wouldest Bless Me In did and enlarge my Coast amen amen I'm asking you how about we have a concern for our lives how about we be a man of vision amen amen don't just say the prophet says it this way don't just say oh ever what will be in life will be he says no do something about it amen you're a God of the earth you are given dominion over the Earth set the course for your life amen amen purpose in your heart that I will follow the word of God yes amen I tell you even territories in your natural life you can expand that's right because not only was jabus talking spiritually enlarge my spiritual borders yes he's talking about material things here as well amen amen the person that sitting on your territory maybe in the form of your promotion maybe sitting in your position but God can extend your borders am God can extend your territory yes Hallelujah but it's according to your faith and I can ask for you you be J and you ask God yes you have confidence that he's your father amen I can pray for you sure amen but if you are a son and daughter of God how how about you pray and trust God hallelujah he wants to give it to you more than you desire it so jabus prayer wasn't just only about material expansion but about the growth amen so remember he's asking for the expansion because once you gain territory you gain influence Hallelujah once you gain influence you can have an impact yes amen and then you can truly fulfill God's purpose for your life I don't like things to be dry I don't like things to be Barren I don't like things to be just enough I want a god of more than enough I want a God who does exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ever ask or think the prophet teaches us to ask God for big things so if we ask him for big things and we want him to give to us abundantly where as his sons must reflect his character and we must be a people who give in abundance amen amen praise the Lord remember now as Christians we can't live selfish lives the Bible Propet tells us that eternal life is living for others which means if we value eternal life we'll Place more value on the other person and give even though we require it we'll give something to them because we know that eternal life is living for others and we know how a law works in the kingdom of God that when you give it will come back pressed down shaken together and running over you know at you right what happened she paid Tiding $20 the prophet was actually at a house to give it back to her yeah you go read the story he said I know she's so poor and he said I was going back back to give it to her and he says the Lord spoke to him yes and he said don't do that amen why there's a reward attached to everything you get you can't sww into this Kingdom and not be blessed this is an eternal law of the kingdom of God if denominational world have tapped into that yeah and they are living off it they're basically farming on your land yes how about we be like Mal and say we want the land back am how about we say every promise in the book is mine amen amen praise the Lord right so we must live selfish Liv just for ourselves and my family amen we must be giving people you must be so giving and so blessing people amen that your life is one of abundance amen you find people don't like to give Thanksgiving to the Lord you know every place got a a culture or tradition of the way they give thanks right so it's diff it differs across the nations of the Earth but you'll find some people can never give thanks to God if we are saying okay in our form you know how we give thanks when last did we give thanks when last we make a public declaration that the Lord had blessed me and I want to give thanks to the Lord amen and and if I want to bless people amen I'm going to bless his people hallelujah no but now what happens is we find how we can just satisfy us four and no more there's no blessing attached to them Hallelujah amen but when you can say I want to live a life of abundance Lord amen amen the Christian Life is an Abundant Life Hallelujah if God gives us so freely amen the Bible says freely you receive freely you give in fact the Bible says it is more blessed to give than to receive hallelujah amen I was supposed to be stuck on that point but I think someone is selfish you say Lord is it me maybe it's me I don't know Hallelujah because you know we preach from the pit to the Pew Hallelujah so our desire should be for a greater reach a greater impact a greater influence in the spiritual realm amen that's right not for self Glory now but to fulfill God's kingdom purposes am amen like jabas we must approach god with a sincere desire for his Blessing recognizing that every good gift comes from from above amen as we ask God to enlarge our territory we are asking him to increase our capacity to serve to make a difference for his kingdom can you see that's not a selfish asking we are asking him to bless us so it to increase our capacity to serve the kingdom amen now Matthew here we read in 77 it's showing us the importance of the to ask with persistence and to ask with faith in prayer amen amen knowing that God Delights in answering the prayer of his sons and daughters praise the Lord our expansion is not just uh for a one time request no hallelujah how if you go to work once and that's it you draw One salary and you live the rest of your life no it's a persistent work amen hallelujah so our asking must be cont continual amen amen a continual Pursuit amen for the best things in our lives not only natural things but if you want that fine if you're serving his purpose but I'm saying for the best of his kingdom amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord now John 5 tells us 1 John 5 that his prayer was answered because it was aligned to God's will amen Hallelujah so when we pray to God to enlarge our territory it is crucial that our prayers align with his purpose and his plan for our lives amen amen now if we want to have confidence in our prayers let's have faith in our prayers we must seek to understand God's will amen and his will is his word amen amen praise the Lord and we know that we are led by the Holy Spirit so as we align our desires with his amen we can pray boldly yes amen knowing that he hears us and he will grant our petitions amen praise the Lord so ja is here we find he's not a popular man amen and he's asking for an extension of his territory I say how about we ask for the enlargement of our territories in our life amen your territory could be your family your territory could be your children your territory could be amen your family your children your friend somebody that you love someone in the church but jabz didn't want to be an ordinary man I want you to picture JZ he's sitting there and maybe his territory is only as far as this room he and he's sitting there but he's got a vision for his life am amen he knows he's called for a purpose amen he knows he's called to prophesy to Nations tongues and Kings amen am amen but in order to fulfill his mandate God has got to enlarge his territory Hallelujah in order for you to have an impact yes to have an infuence to enlarge his spiritual Frontiers God has got to enlarge his territory now many people never achieve the things that they could accomplish because they walk through life with no vision yes they have no master plan amen no real purpose no dream that motivates them amen nothing to push them towards their goal yes nothing to push them to amen no courage to to step out of their comfort zone amen amen now if you hear what the prophet is saying I like a man of vision not somebody who just says oh well we'll see how it goes but he says oh get up and be at it amen so I'm going to tell you I'm not happy with ordinary basically I'm telling you my vision nowen I'm not happy with following the crowd right amen I'm not happy with just a certain portion being opened up to us I want to enlarge our spiritual boundaries am I want to open up spiritual Frontiers yes and I'm sharing my vision with you I'm not happy with mediocre I'm talking about all aspects of our lives and maybe maybe it's not even you but I'm not just happy with a mediocre prayer life I'm not happy with a mediocre Bible reading time amen I'm not happy amen with just just go getting by and having small victories I want to see the full power manifest through my life amen can anyone align with that Vision I want to see The Church on the Move I want to see a powerful church I want to see the Army not just quote Invincible Army but I want to see Sons and Daughters of God Rise Up from the church as a mighty marching Army can somebody align with that Vision amen yes Lord thank you Lord yes Lord amen amen we are not called to be ordinary J realized he's not called to be ordinary yes amen I I pray I'm speaking to a j here tonight that after the service when I give you a chance to pray you will say oh Lord that thou would bless me and enlarge my territory amen let me open up spiritual Frontiers for the kingdom of God Amen let me have an impact yes amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen what am I saying step amen enlarge your territory move from faith move your territory from faith move your territory to Virtue amen move your territory from virtue Hallelujah move all seven steps of territory move up to dimensional travel of the Holy Ghost amen salvation is one dimension of the Holy Ghost healing is another dimension of the Holy Ghost amen but I'm saying let's move on to amen higher than those things amen as much as God is pouring out that's as much as I want to receive hallelujah praise the Lord amen so don't walk through life with no vision no purpose no master plan amen nothing to motivate you no goal praise the Lord I don't care if you have one Grand in your pocket right now Hallelujah you envision yourself for the life that you want and don't think small the prophet of God says ask God for big things God likes to challenge don't ask God for five five your brother can give you he says ask God for big things amen Hey Nobody's aligning with this now he says ask God for big things than Lord praise the Lord I motivate you I encourage you why must should live in low arm slanger amen but it's all what you envision it's all what you purpose for your life amen amen hallelujah be a man of vision praise the Lord ask God for big things ask God for things that you think is impossible and watch him get to work amen God likes a man-sized CH challenge my son look at what he's telling me hey he's raising he's here taking care of cattle he's here taking care of sheep but he's got a vision to be a king hey and don't be afraid to tell your dream to people Joseph was not ashamed to tell his dream to people it looks impossible for him to be the ruler of Egypt but the moment moment he spoke his dream he activated Mark 11:23 a man who believes his own word amen praise the Lord as long as you keep the dream silent you don't activate spiritual Frontiers you don't put the laws into motion but the moment that word is released from your mouth by faith and you believe it you start to activate the promise of God Amen maybe you don't even have a degree where you are but you want the highest position maybe one second in charge don't let the dream lie silent amen speak the [Music] word in fact go crazy tell everyone what you're going to be amen you see because when you're that bold you don't care what people say about you they can even Mock You are you studed no so how are you going to get there I have a God the Bible says he sets up Kings and he takes them down he controls the nations of the earth amen he even calls Pharaoh his servant yeah but Pharaoh thought he was a mighty ruler hey Pharaoh didn't even want to be so hard the Bible says God had in these right right don't play with my God Amen so jabz also prayed for God's presence he knew that to live large for God it was going to take more than his own strength it was going to take God's power in his life to accomplish his dream Amen in Ephesians 3 and: 20 it says God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think amen praise the Lord so he's also asking for protection over his life if your borders are small you don't have much to protect amen praise the Lord so jabz knew that God's power and God's presence and God's protection he could face anything amen and the good news was the Bible says God answered ja's request am amen praise the Lord you now you can expand your territory for healing I'll just go through this very quickly and then we'll close now no matter how sick you are what condition you are you can expand the territory of your healing by doing the opposite of what they are telling you you can't do here what the prophet is saying right down to the End of the Road God will be faithful you quit your doubting give over and give up and let God he said I'll not give you the land in one year but if I give you the whole thing in a year the wild beast will come in and consume you but little by little as you are able I will give you the land when I'm talking about land now I'm talking about opening up spiritual Frontiers thank Lord so watch how we are gaining it little by little because we've got to have the faith to match the enemy amen so as your faith is increasing is going to give you dominion over that situation yes oh I pray somebody's listening tonight amen he says little by little just as you kill out this little bunch of amorites I'll let you move in and take over if you kill this bunch of evites I'll let you move in and take over over isn't that what we've been seeing amen we're taking spiritual Frontiers little by little because if God opens up the entire Gates of Hell amen you got to be back in your Adam condition to be able to handle it basically you've got to be Jesus on the Earth right but he says he opens up little by little praise the Lord amen now here's where he gets to the healing he says well somebody I prayed for last night I had a crippled hand and the only thing I can do is wiggle my finger that's just all the farther you spread out and if you spread farther out you'll move your arm you see enlarge the territory of your healing praise the Lord amen do the opposite of what they say you can't do yes they tell you brother rames your need just be careful with it you take your knee by the stripes of Jesus I am healed by the stripes of Jesus I am healed I thank you for new cartilage I thank you for new fluids I thank you the pain is gone thank you Lord hey is somebody hearing me activating spiritual laws by faith amen he says well that's all the father you spread out he says if you spread farther you move your arm and as you spread your faith which is in in your territory God will let you take over the territory it's yours God promised you your he again Hallelujah well I feel good oh God spread me out he says footsteps is Victory he told Joshua everywhere the foot The Souls of your foot trod I'll give it to you yeah amen I know with what Authority we walk yes amen we walk by faith and not by sight amen praise the Lord amen amen we walk into hospital rooms and we we are walking with authority amen that every place the soul of our tread foot H foot shall tread upon we shall possess amen just the presence of us being there people are being discharged people are being healed people are being set free oh but you got to recognize your own authority if you can't have faith in your own self how you expect a sick person to have faith in you praying for them you got to know you carry an authority in fact you got to know that all of Heaven is backing your prayer I want you to snatch your loved ones from the from the Gateway of death yeah but you've got to be bold you've got to explore the spiritual Frontier yes thank you Lord amen and you know what we must not back down amen hallelujah I don't care what the enemy says what he whispers what lies don't look by sight look through the eyes of Faith thank you Lord amen yeah he says if some things are Out Of Reach for you maybe there something things you feel Out Of Reach in your life it's not unreachable you've got to shift your thinking you got to shift the way we think he says I look all around everything the shelves are full nice pretty things everything like that they're all mine each every one of them belongs to me I can go over and take what I want to and Christ is our Variety Store by one Spirit we all baptized into one big Variety Store anything you have need of he will supply it if I need healing I'll take it if I need Joy I'll take it if I need Victory I'll take it it's all hanging around in God's big Variety Store and I am a possessor and you have possession of everything in that Variety Store yes sir don't ever feel you're not worthy of healing don't ever feel that you are not worthy of Joy amen amen explore the boundaries of the Holy Ghost amen amen righteousness peace Joy the kingdom of God explore the fruits of the spirit amen thank you Lord there's nine fruits of the spirit amen we explore the fruits of the spirit praise the Lord amen amen we we are not sad people we are happy people yes the joy of the Lord is our strength amen praise the Lord thank you Lord he says you talk about Elbow Room I don't want just Elbow Room give me space to reach out and grab he says amen let's take over we need healing there is there it is setting for you just reach over and get it sometimes I'm going to say it this way sometimes you need to punch the devil in the face to get it thank you Lord don't go there excuse me sir hallelujah amen act like it's Black Friday it's a Black Friday sale and give him a matching one praise the Lord amen we've got to be bold we've got to be rugged praise the Lord amen you what the prophet is saying amen he says uh you talk about HBO room let's take over we need healing there it is there sitting for you just reach over and grab it you might have to kick over a few things to get it what is he saying there's obstacles on the way you might have to kick yes sir he says you might have to kick a few things here to get it push through a few times to get it what is that push through spiritual Frontiers enlarge your territory amen but go ahead and take it you might have to get a ladder a spiritual ladder amen amen and reach up for it but God's got a letter there if youve interested in getting it he sings Now give me oil in my lamp keep me burning he's showing you the Holy Ghost is the ladder and you've got to climb up to higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost somebody give God praise am the Holy Ghost is our ladder higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost meaning that sometimes if we stay too in too low dimensions we can't achieve what we supposed to reach out at the top so he says get into higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost reach out and grab it the Holy Ghost is the ladder amen praise the Lord thank you Lord he says let every person in here tonight who believes God's will God give us a promise he says I'll take care of you Plum through till the promised land God promised to heal our sickness and give us the Holy Ghost give us happiness give us peace of mind and everything until we cross the Jordan Yonder Amen to enter in to the great Eternal glories of God Amen he says I just
