[0:00] now tonight we are studying this uh
[0:04] second seal and for the first four seals
[0:08] there is four harsh
[0:10] Riders then I grab me a pencil right
[0:13] quick and start writing down as fast as
[0:14] I can while he's there he's doing
[0:18] something real Supernatural now too and
[0:21] so we're just expecting great things now
[0:24] I'll read the third verse now and when
[0:27] he had opened the second seal I heard
[0:29] the second beast say come and see and
[0:32] there went out another horse fourth
[0:35] verse that was red and power was given
[0:38] to him that set thereon to take peace
[0:41] from the earth that they should kill one
[0:45] another and they should kill one another
[0:48] and there was given unto him a great
[0:52] sword and he didn't see what it was he
[0:56] just saw a symbol and that symbol
[1:00] for the reason it was he said come see
[1:03] but he saw a symbol that he was to
[1:06] symbolize it to the church and remember
[1:09] the secrets was to be revealed in the
[1:12] last day and how does he reveal his word
[1:17] is Secrets the Bible notice the first
[1:21] church when the Catholic Church says
[1:24] that they were the first original Church
[1:27] they're exactly right they were they
[1:31] began at
[1:33] Pentecost that's where the Catholic
[1:34] Church
[1:36] began now I once didn't hardly believe
[1:38] that I read history and I find out it's
[1:40] right now let's go to the second
[1:44] seal when the
[1:46] slaying risen lamb opened it and the
[1:51] second uh C like Beast said come
[1:56] see what the seal m stre is now we get
[2:01] it the lamb you remember has to open
[2:03] every seal the second first was a line
[2:06] the next was a was a was like a calf or
[2:10] ox or something he
[2:12] see we find here that he saw what a red
[2:17] horse go forward let's just read and see
[2:21] what he says here and there went out
[2:23] fourth verse there went out another
[2:25] horse that was red the first in his
[2:28] wife and power was given unto him that
[2:31] set there on to take peace from the
[2:34] earth and they should kill one another
[2:37] and there was given him a great sword
[2:41] now there symbols here and we want to
[2:45] look at him real close let us now
[2:48] consider what John saw then of these
[2:51] things what he saw a red horse and his
[2:54] riter Goes Forth power given to him to
[2:58] slay with with a great
[3:02] sword now here's my revelation of it
[3:06] this is Satan
[3:08] again it's a devil again in another
[3:13] form now we know that that U seals
[3:18] pertained as it said the other night and
[3:20] trumpets pertain to to to to Civil Wars
[3:23] you see amongst the people among nations
[3:27] but you find out here that this man had
[3:29] is a sword so he pertains to church
[3:32] political
[3:34] war you might not think that but just
[3:36] watch it a
[3:37] minute
[3:40] notice the change of color of these
[3:43] horses same
[3:46] Rider change of color of horses and a
[3:50] horse is a beast and the Beast in the
[3:52] Bible and her symbol represents a
[3:55] power the same system riding on another
[3:59] color
[4:02] power from the innocent white to a
[4:05] bloody
[4:06] red see watch him now he's
[4:11] coming when he first started he was just
[4:16] well he just a little Doctrine in the in
[4:19] called the nicoladis
[4:21] of course it wouldn't slay anything
[4:24] that's Revelations 2:6 if you want to
[4:25] put it down then after while he was
[4:27] given a crown of course you can't put a
[4:29] crown crown on a spirit's head but when
[4:31] this Spirit become incarnate the second
[4:34] work of his of his dispensation of his
[4:38] Missy the second work he become a
[4:41] crowned false prophet to the working of
[4:46] the Antichrist
[4:48] Spirit now we see now now now he becomes
[4:53] that when he takes that then he uh is
[4:57] already Satan control
[5:00] the political powers of the world now he
[5:04] gets into a place that he's going to
[5:06] make a universal church
[5:08] power taking religious power and do you
[5:13] not understand my brothers that in when
[5:17] this nation appears in the 13th chapter
[5:20] of
[5:21] Revelation this little animal raised up
[5:24] like a lamb and it's got two
[5:27] horns civil and ecclesiastical power but
[5:32] he done the same thing the Beast did
[5:34] before him now when he did that he did
[5:37] not have the ecclesiastical power
[5:40] yet but he started in with a demon of a
[5:44] false teaching and that teaching become
[5:47] a doctrine that Doctrine become
[5:50] incarnate in a false
[5:52] prophet and then he went just to the
[5:56] right place he never went to Israel now
[5:59] he went went to Rome n see of Rome the
[6:02] council was held and they elected a head
[6:07] Bishop amen and then by doing this they
[6:11] United church and state
[6:14] together then he dropped his
[6:18] bow he got off his White Horse he got on
[6:22] his red horse or he can kill anybody
[6:25] that don't agree with
[6:27] him there's your seal
[6:32] same
[6:33] fell watch him right on into eternity
[6:35] under see unites both his powers
[6:39] together now we find out he unites his
[6:43] power then when he become both state and
[6:47] church ecclesiastical then what are you
[6:50] going to do he forms his own religion
[6:54] and now he can do whatever he wants to
[6:56] then he has the right to put the death
[6:58] whosoever not agree with him that's
[7:02] exactly what he did too amen he went
[7:05] back down to hippo and he was a very one
[7:08] that signed that that paper that had the
[7:11] Revelation from God that was all right
[7:14] and pleasing God to put every person to
[7:17] death that didn't believe with the Roman
[7:19] Catholic church now listen I'm quoting
[7:22] from the
[7:23] martyrology from the time of of St
[7:27] Augustine of Hippo until
[7:30] 1586 on the Roman
[7:33] martyrology the Roman Catholic Church
[7:36] put
[7:37] 68 million Protestants to
[7:40] [Music]
[7:42] death was his sword red was he right a
[7:45] red
[7:46] horse what was it the same
[7:50] power the same Rider there's the
[7:54] seal they
[7:56] admit 68 million on the mar Ry besides
[8:00] all that was put to death outside of
[8:02] that oh mercy during the Dark Ages there
[8:06] were Millions fed the Lions and
[8:09] Slaughter and every way because they
[8:11] wouldn't bow down to that Catholic dogma
