[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've always got to keep that in
[13:44] our mind. He's our soon coming king.
[13:46] Amen. I just want to read a scripture.
[13:48] Nehemiah chapter 8.
[13:52] Maybe you're wondering why we stand for
[13:53] the reading of the word or why we say
[13:56] amen in church.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; We'll see in the Bible why. Amen. They
[13:59] did. Okay. See if it's biblical, right?
[14:04] Nehemiah chapter 8 and verse, let's read
[14:06] from verse 5.
[14:11] And Ezra opened the book in the sight of
[14:14] all the people, for he was above all the
[14:17] people. And when he opened it, all the
[14:20] people
[14:21] &gt;&gt; stood up.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; And then now we're going to see why. We
[14:26] say, "Amen." And Ezra blessed the Lord.
[14:30] The great God and all the people
[14:32] answered,
[14:33] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Not one amen. Amen. Amen. So we need to
[14:37] give double portion amens.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; With lifting up their hands. Not just
[14:42] saying amen, but lifting up their hands.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, thank you, Lord.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; And they bow their heads and worship the
[14:49] Lord with their faces to the ground.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; So, all of these things are biblical.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; It's part of worship to God to say,
[14:55] "Amen." To stand up when we read the
[14:57] word of God. Amen. Amen. So, we're very
[14:59] excited this morning to be in the house
[15:01] of the Lord. Amen. Good to see our
[15:03] brother Sebastian, Sister Christina,
[15:04] Brother Jaden. Amen. Brother Matthew.
[15:08] Amen. They're not uh they're back home.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; You see, they're sitting right in their
[15:12] seats, too. We deserved it for you.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many more months left?
[15:19] We're counting down the months. Amen.
[15:21] So, we Amen. We're surprised to see them
[15:23] this morning, but I pray the Lord is
[15:25] keeping you well. Amen. Continue serving
[15:27] him by his grace. They're fellowshipping
[15:28] out there in Emanuel Gospel Center.
[15:31] Newly elected pastor there, Pastor
[15:33] Marshall.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we pray that the Lord will
[15:36] continue to bless him as they fellowship
[15:37] out there and serve the Lord.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very glad to have with us our dear
[15:41] Pastor Rodney this morning. Let's give
[15:43] our pastor Robbie and sister a hand.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. No strangers to us.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are warriors for the kingdom
[15:51] of God. Have been serving the Lord for
[15:53] many, many years in the kingdom of God.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; And Pastor Rodney has a heart for the
[15:58] unity of Durban.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Always striving. We share the same
[16:01] goal is to unite the body of Jesus
[16:04] Christ.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; And he's very giving. He's very
[16:08] generous. He's also a very busy man. So
[16:11] he's got two churches. He's got one here
[16:13] in Durban and one in Peter Merittsburg.
[16:16] Amen. So you know just one church alone
[16:18] can keep you busy. But the Lord has
[16:20] given him grace. That's a grace God has
[16:21] given a man.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know Paul said the grace that
[16:24] has been given to me.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; So grace has been given to our dear
[16:29] pastor. Amen. To shepherd these church
[16:31] churches. And I pray the Lord will
[16:32] continue to strengthen him and give him
[16:34] the strength and grace that he needs.
[16:36] Amen. So we're grateful to have him here
[16:38] this morning. We've been trying to get
[16:40] him here for some time, but uh he's no
[16:42] stranger to us. He's been here before,
[16:44] maybe not at this place, but at this at
[16:46] the school to minister for us. Dad used
[16:48] to enjoy his ministry and invite him
[16:50] quite often to come and share the word
[16:52] for of the Lord to us. Amen. So, we're
[16:54] going to be blessed this morning. How
[16:55] many of you have come under expectation?
[16:58] &gt;&gt; And if you come under expectation, God
[16:59] will meet you.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; How many of you enjoyed Wednesday
[17:02] service?
[17:03] &gt;&gt; If you came with expectation,
[17:05] &gt;&gt; you got to have preparation.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. You got to start to prepare now. So
[17:09] if you come with your pots full, you got
[17:11] to empty out. Start to prepare
[17:13] &gt;&gt; because God can only fill if you empty
[17:15] out.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got this much space left
[17:18] here, see this little space? That's all
[17:20] you're going to get full.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; So we're going to empty out and then
[17:23] say, "Lord, fill my cup."
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we want the Holy Spirit to
[17:26] speak this morning and minister to the
[17:28] needs of the church. And I pray, Amen,
[17:30] even as our dear pastor is sharing the
[17:32] word of the Lord. Amen. that the angel
[17:34] of God can move through this place,
[17:36] &gt;&gt; sweep through this audience and meet you
[17:38] at the point of your need.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the time. Don't wait for
[17:42] tomorrow. Don't wait for another time.
[17:43] Say, "Lord, I've come now. Now I've come
[17:46] to meet with you."
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, dear Pastor, welcome. Thank
[17:49] you for accepting our invitation. And I
[17:51] pray, amen, that even as he begins to
[17:54] minister the word of the Lord, you'll
[17:55] open up your hearts and begin to say
[17:57] amen to the word.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just water that word with your
[18:00] amen
[18:01] &gt;&gt; and watch the Holy Spirit take control.
[18:03] Amen.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's stand together.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; He's worthy to be praised.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I've come expecting
[18:13] Jesus.

[21:46] with faith. Yes, Lord.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; We bind every spirit of fear.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Bind every spirit of doubt and
[21:52] distraction in the name of Jesus Christ.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Let there be freedom of worship.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Let there be liberty to shout Lord
[22:00] &gt;&gt; to shout in the joy of the Holy Ghost.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Let the service, oh God, be a service of
[22:06] encounters with angels, oh God.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Let there be breakthroughs, oh God. Let
[22:10] there be quicken revelation this
[22:12] morning. Oh God, we are not yet to be
[22:14] entertained.
[22:16] We are here to be changed.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; We are waiting for a revival.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Father, we are the revival. God, awaken
[22:23] the gifts in your sons and daughters. Oh
[22:25] God, open up, open the word to us, oh
[22:28] God, not as information, but as a
[22:31] revelation to get us in the rhythm of
[22:33] your father, let your bride, Father,
[22:36] rise in her authority, oh God. Let the
[22:38] voice of the archangel sound in her
[22:40] soul. Oh God, let your word be made
[22:43] fresh this morning, Father. And as we
[22:45] stand under the seventh seal, Christ
[22:47] himself, oh God, Lord, we are living in
[22:49] the day of the third pull. Oh God, so
[22:52] Lord, we are expecting the supernatural
[22:54] to be made manifest once more amongst
[22:56] us, oh God.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, this service is yours, Father.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord Jesus. Be glorified in
[23:04] every moment, Father. And when it's all
[23:06] over and when everything is said and
[23:08] done, Lord, may we say, did not our
[23:11] hearts burn with us while he spoke?
[23:15] with us by the way.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; For we ask it in the mighty
[23:19] &gt;&gt; and wonderful name, the allconquering
[23:21] name, the all sufficient name of our
[23:24] Lord Jesus Christ.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his wonderful name.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; And let's put our hands together.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; And praise his wonderful name.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; I just greet you all in the wonderful
[23:38] name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You happy this morning? Yeah, it's
[23:44] always a privilege. It's always a joy to
[23:47] gather around the word of God,
[23:49] &gt;&gt; the very word that we love, the very
[23:51] word that we cherish. And of course,
[23:53] it's always a blessing to be with the
[23:55] children of like a precious faith. Amen.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; I'm happy this morning.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning?
[24:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; I'm excited this morning. Amen.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; And I really appreciate the um
[24:08] invitation just to come and warm
[24:10] fellowship. And uh I want to just
[24:13] express my sincere thanks and
[24:15] appreciation to my dear brother, my
[24:17] friend in Christ, our pastor um Adrien
[24:21] um Genanon for this opportunity just to
[24:23] come. May God richly bless the assembly
[24:26] &gt;&gt; and bless the government of the church,
[24:28] all the supporters and the helpers. He
[24:30] can't do it himself.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; He he need helpers.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I always say when I when when
[24:37] God called me to the ministry to preach,
[24:39] I said, "Lord, give me good men
[24:41] &gt;&gt; to stand behind me, to support me, that
[24:44] can love me unconditionally, not judge
[24:46] me, but catch the same vision that I
[24:49] have to move the kingdom of God um
[24:52] forward." So may the Lord richly bless
[24:55] um this assembly. Amen. and not
[24:57] forgetting our dear sister Grace
[25:00] &gt;&gt; and also honoring the memory of our
[25:02] pastor Ronnie Genan and to um brother
[25:06] Sha. I'm sure they're looking down from
[25:09] the banister of time this morning,
[25:11] smiling down upon us from eternity.
[25:14] Amen. And no doubt their lives and
[25:16] labors are not forgotten.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Their memories live amongst us. Amen.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his wonderful name. Amen. I
[25:23] would like you to invite your attention
[25:26] to the book of Exodus and then to the
[25:27] book of Numbers. Um I I I want to take a
[25:31] little talk this morning. Uh uh a little
[25:34] subject, you know, sometimes I'm I I I'm
[25:37] a bit of a drawn out preacher, you know,
[25:39] and I can remember, you know, Brother
[25:41] Beck we preach in many places. One time
[25:44] he said to me, Lord, just land this
[25:46] airplane. Just land it. Please, man.
[25:49] Just land this airplane. Amen. So, um,
[25:52] but I pray that God will just give us,
[25:54] uh, grace. Yeah. That, uh, wherever we
[25:57] need to stop, we'll stop.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; And whatever he wants us to say, we'll
[26:01] say.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; If he says go on, we go on. Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; So, I I want to speak on a little
[26:07] subject, the unseen realm.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; The unseen realm. And for a little uh
[26:13] theme this morning, angels to keep us in
[26:15] the way.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in the way. May maybe
[26:18] you'll be seated for just a few minutes.
[26:21] And then maybe uh my brother if you
[26:23] could find that quote from the for us
[26:25] from the revelation the book of symbols.
[26:30] So I want to speak on the unseen realm
[26:33] you know. Amen.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in the way because God
[26:37] has a ministry of angels. Do you believe
[26:39] that?
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; You know something uh it took me time to
[26:43] really understand some of these things.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; You know brother Brandham had the Holy
[26:47] Ghost for sure. You see, and I believe
[26:50] that I have the Holy Ghost. I believe
[26:52] that the congregation, the people that
[26:54] seated here has the Holy Ghost.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham had the Holy Ghost.
[26:58] The believers that were seated before
[26:59] him, they had the Holy Ghost. But if you
[27:02] had noticed in the meetings, Brother
[27:03] Brandham when he would come to the
[27:05] pulpit, he would just talk and talk and
[27:08] maybe even tell some stories and talk
[27:11] and talk and talk and then he would
[27:13] pause and he would just say, um, you
[27:15] know, I'm waiting on him.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Then after a few moments, you know, he
[27:21] would speak and stand. Then you would
[27:22] say, "No, now he's here."
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Now that is a that is a reality.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; That is a supernatural being that sent
[27:33] from the presence of God Almighty that
[27:35] will come down into that meeting. And
[27:38] just as brother Brandham depended upon
[27:40] that angel, we are also depend on that
[27:44] angelic presence this morning because
[27:47] that angel didn't just come for one man.
[27:50] No.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel came with the message.
[27:53] The angel of the Lord is the message.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; He came out to a people. He came to a
[27:58] bride. And he's still here.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Leading us in the way. Amen. And if we
[28:06] have eyes to see this morning and if we
[28:09] have hearts to believe this morning,
[28:11] then we can also say the angel of the
[28:14] Lord is here.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; So let me read this quote for you here.
[28:19] Make a few comments and then we can read
[28:21] our scripture and get into our thought.
[28:23] But this is the crux of what I would
[28:25] like to share with you this morning. The
[28:27] prophet of God says, "Angelic beings
[28:30] associate together."
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. angelic beings associated
[28:35] together. He says, "Oh, I hope you get
[28:38] that. That just dropped down." He had
[28:40] free.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Look, if you've
[28:44] got the Holy Ghost in you, then you're a
[28:46] candidate for association with the
[28:49] unseen world and the supernatural."
[28:52] &gt;&gt; He says, "No wonder people can't believe
[28:54] in those things. They have never come in
[28:57] contact.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; They've got nothing in here to believe
[29:01] with. But when the Holy Spirit comes
[29:03] into the heart quickly,
[29:05] &gt;&gt; he becomes a two-fold being.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; One of the earth to die and one of
[29:12] heaven to live. Amen. He says in his
[29:15] body is still subject to death. But in
[29:18] his soul,
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; In his soul, he's passed from death unto
[29:25] life. In his body, he has earthly
[29:28] contact with his five senses. in his
[29:30] spirit. He has contact with God through
[29:32] the Holy Ghost and watch them. And the
[29:36] angels of God visits them,
[29:39] &gt;&gt; speaks with them.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; And they are messengers sent from God to
[29:43] reveal and to bring messages from God to
[29:47] the individual.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name to the
[29:56] individual. Lord.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; So if you've got the Holy Ghost
[29:59] according to what the prophet says, then
[30:01] you're a candidate. Hallelujah. For
[30:03] association with the unseen world. Amen.
[30:06] Amen. That means if you have the Holy
[30:08] Ghost, you become you have access.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you are eligible. The Holy
[30:14] Ghost makes you eligible for angelic
[30:17] visitations to give you divine
[30:20] communication.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why you know many
[30:24] believers today they walk like tourists
[30:26] in a
[30:27] &gt;&gt; realm
[30:28] &gt;&gt; where they are called to govern.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they don't have
[30:33] their spiritual passports that don't
[30:35] have the Holy Ghost.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Listen the prophet says he says quickly
[30:39] when you get the Holy Ghost he becomes a
[30:41] two-fold being.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Twofold being because the
[30:46] believer is now a mystery to himself.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. He's dying and
[30:51] living at the same time. His flesh is
[30:53] mortal, but his soul is crossed over.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; He walks here in Der. He walks in
[30:58] Phoenix. He walks in in tax. Hallelujah.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; But he's a twofold being. He lives in
[31:04] Christ.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; He eats food for this earth.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; But he feeds on mana from another world.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; That's why the world can't understand
[31:12] you. They confused about you because
[31:14] you're not just human anymore. You are
[31:16] housing eternity in you.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "No wonder people can't
[31:22] believe in those things. They got
[31:24] nothing in here yet to believe in."
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Carnal minds will always scoff at at
[31:32] angelic visitations and visions and
[31:35] angelic healings and supernatural power.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; You you can't expect dead men to respond
[31:41] to a living God.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; You see? Amen. That's why we just don't
[31:46] need we don't need sermons just
[31:48] absolutely
[31:49] &gt;&gt; we need the fire of God to work in our
[31:51] life.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; What we preach must be living in us. It
[31:55] must be seen. It must be in
[31:56] manifestation. We must enjoy divine
[31:59] visitation. We must know that he is
[32:01] here.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; He is not here then this meeting is a
[32:05] waste of time.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; That's why the god says if you could see
[32:08] him he said you run down you fall down
[32:11] and you worship him.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says in his body he has
[32:16] earthly contact with five senses.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Even five senses put for the earthly
[32:22] contact but in the spirit God has given
[32:24] you a dedicated channel
[32:26] &gt;&gt; through the Holy Ghost. You are designed
[32:29] to hear from the author himself.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; But because God has designed his bride
[32:35] to walk under revelation
[32:37] &gt;&gt; not information.
[32:39] And then this last part he says, "And
[32:41] the angels of God visits them and speaks
[32:45] to them."
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you give testimony to
[32:50] that?
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have you enjoyed a
[32:52] visitation from the angels? Have you
[32:55] enjoyed a visitation from the presence
[32:57] of the living God?
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Because the same God who sent angels to
[33:03] Abraham, he sent to Daniel. He sent to
[33:06] Cornelius. He sent to brother Brandon.
[33:09] Amen.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; These are just these are not stories.
[33:11] No,
[33:12] &gt;&gt; this is a divine that is in the Bible.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; You say sometimes no I haven't seen
[33:18] angels. It's because you are insensitive
[33:22] &gt;&gt; because your channel is blocked. Your
[33:23] message is not heed. He's not healed it.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Angels don't waste time with people who
[33:29] flirt with darkness.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Angel says there's an angel standing
[33:33] right by your chair.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's a quote. Hallelujah.
[33:37] They're standing there. They are ready,
[33:39] ready to speak, ready to guide, ready to
[33:42] warn, ready to comfort, ready to confirm
[33:45] his word to those that are walking in
[33:47] the light.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; So from this quote here, we want to just
[33:50] set a little tone so that we can get
[33:53] into our scriptures. So um maybe we
[33:55] could just stand for a moment.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 23 and we want to read
[34:00] from verse 20.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[34:11] He says, "Behold, I send an angel before
[34:14] thee
[34:15] &gt;&gt; to keep thee in the way
[34:18] &gt;&gt; and to bring thee into the place which I
[34:21] have prepared." Praise his wonderful
[34:23] name. You You may be seated. Praise his
[34:26] wonderful name.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; So we are speaking on the unseen ren and
[34:32] angels to keep us in the way.
[34:35] Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name.
[34:39] Hallelujah.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in the way because
[34:43] sheep have to be led.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Sheep can't lead themselves.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; I I I I recently went and I was speaking
[34:51] to some a brother who they didn't come
[34:54] to church for a long time and he says,
[34:56] "God is keeping me. God is keeping my
[34:58] family. God is so wonderful. So good." I
[35:00] I when I when he finished, I said,
[35:02] "Brother, you're backsliding and you
[35:03] don't even know it.
[35:06] You can't lead yourself.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; You need God.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; You need a church. You need a pastor.
[35:11] You need a home because a church is an
[35:13] extended family. It's a support
[35:16] structure for your spiritual walk with
[35:17] God.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; You need church.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need a pastor.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name.
[35:25] So here in Exodus chapter 23, God
[35:28] himself is speaking to Moses.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And who is Moses? Moses is a
[35:33] prophet
[35:34] &gt;&gt; and God is speaking to Moses. He says,
[35:36] "Behold, I send an angel before thee to
[35:40] keep thee in the way."
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; So, if you can picture this, the angel
[35:46] of the Lord going first, Moses standing
[35:49] behind the angel, and the people of God
[35:52] standing.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. An angel before thee to keep thee
[35:59] in the way. You see that angel? This was
[36:03] absolutely necessary because you must
[36:05] remember now this is the first exodus.
[36:07] The path that they were going to travel
[36:09] was unlike any other path that they had
[36:12] traveled before.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; It was more than just a natural train.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; It was not some kind of a detour on a
[36:19] map. You see, no GPS, no G, no Google
[36:22] map
[36:23] &gt;&gt; could guide them to that place.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Because this was more than a natural
[36:29] journey. Yes,
[36:30] &gt;&gt; this was a prophetic journey. This was a
[36:33] transition from one realm to another
[36:35] realm. This was from bondage to liberty.
[36:38] This was from Egypt to the promised
[36:40] land.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; And listen saints, we are all in the
[36:44] same kind of way this morning.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; This we are not here on a on a Sunday
[36:49] religious detour. No, we are here on a
[36:53] journey. We are here on a sacred march.
[36:56] When we are here in the house of God,
[36:57] it's one step closer to eternity.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Because at the end of the road, amen, we
[37:03] will become the word again.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; We become fully restored, fully
[37:07] redeemed. And every stain of sin,
[37:09] everything that is connected to the fall
[37:12] will be completely wiped away.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; We are in a journey.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, I send an angel before
[37:21] thee to keep thee in the way."
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. and to bring thee to the place
[37:25] which I have prepared,
[37:27] &gt;&gt; which God has prepared. So in other
[37:30] words, God has a specific destination in
[37:33] his mind,
[37:34] &gt;&gt; a place he himself prepared to bring his
[37:38] children into.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; It's a place that is connected to the
[37:41] birth.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; It is a place where they'll come to a
[37:44] full realization of who they are and
[37:47] what they are born for.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you can just catch that this
[37:52] morning. Sometimes you look at your
[37:53] life, you look at back at your birth,
[37:55] you look at your upbringing, you say,
[37:57] "Lord, uh why you make me like this?
[37:59] Lord, what I'm doing upon this earth,
[38:01] Lord, why why I'm made like this year?
[38:04] Lord, what is your will for my life?" We
[38:06] ask all these questions, but the word
[38:08] says one day it will be so real.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; It will be so plain, so clear because
[38:12] you shall be known as you were known.
[38:16] Hallelujah. You'll understand that you
[38:18] were in the thoughts of God. that your
[38:20] life has always been part of his eternal
[38:22] plan.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; And this exodus is the journey to that
[38:27] place, to your inheritance, to your
[38:29] originality.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were making a journey.
[38:33] They were journeying to a place where
[38:35] nobody could occupy or take their place
[38:38] there.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; They were journeying to a place that
[38:41] they were born to occupy.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; They were going to a place where they
[38:44] could have all things under their feet.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is speaking about a place
[38:50] in the Holy Ghost. It's speaking about a
[38:52] place in the Holy Spirit. And listen
[38:54] now, for them to make that journey, God
[38:58] prepared a prophet.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; And then God sent an angel.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; That shows you something that these
[39:05] people are highly favored by God.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't let them to navigate this
[39:12] journey on their own.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; God prepared a prophet.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. and sent an angel.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; It is his divine provision. Tell me who
[39:22] can who can who can provide this kind of
[39:25] provision just to make sure
[39:28] &gt;&gt; just to make sure that you're kept in
[39:31] the way.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; He sent an angel then he sent a prophet
[39:35] to keep you in the way.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at the provision
[39:39] because God know what kind of people you
[39:41] are because sometimes you know you you
[39:43] get up to nonsense and now you want to
[39:45] wrigle off. Sometimes you lose your way.
[39:48] Sometimes you lose your bearings.
[39:49] Sometimes you lose your consciousness.
[39:51] Sometimes you lose your focus.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; But he knows how to keep you.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; He knows how to keep you keeping on.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Do you believe this morning you being
[40:03] led into that place?
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Not by might, not by power, not by uh
[40:08] power, but by my spirit. Say the Lord.
[40:12] They that are led led by the spirit are
[40:15] &gt;&gt; sons of God. Hallelujah. Divine
[40:17] leadership, heavenly leadership,
[40:20] &gt;&gt; leadership from above.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; So we are speaking about the unseen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in the way. And we're
[40:29] seeing an angel here that is leading the
[40:31] way.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; And in verse 21, he says, "Beware of
[40:36] him."
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; And obey his voice.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. My hallelujah.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; We must beware and obey because
[40:45] sometimes this angel leads you into
[40:48] strange places.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; This angel sometimes leads you into
[40:53] dangerous places. When the children of
[40:55] Israel was coming out of Egypt and they
[40:57] came he Moses God stepped in Moses to
[41:01] camp between the mountains of at the
[41:03] place called Mikdoll and you and then
[41:05] and then Mikdoll was between two
[41:07] mountains. mountains on this side,
[41:09] mountains on this side, and they were
[41:11] camping here, the Red Sea in front of
[41:14] them.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; And then now when you look at the
[41:16] picture there, yet there's no way to
[41:18] escape. I mean, mountains side,
[41:20] mountains this side, Red Sea this side.
[41:22] Then you turn back, then you see
[41:24] Pharaoh's army,
[41:26] &gt;&gt; racing. Amen.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Coming with full speed for you.
[41:30] Hallelujah. Then you you you feel
[41:32] trapped. You know, there's no way to
[41:34] escape. Then he say, "Oh God, I'm sure
[41:36] Pharaoh is going to get me here. I'm
[41:39] sure I'm going to die here."
[41:43] &gt;&gt; But that's exactly why God doesn't tell
[41:46] us everything up front.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; That's why our life, our earthly life is
[41:52] very mysterious.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; It unfolds day and day by day, moment by
[41:56] moment, second by second.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe some of us won't
[42:00] survive before by the end of the year.
[42:02] Hallelujah. Some of us will go to
[42:04] eternity.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see our our our predestination
[42:08] God is very easy to understand.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; We know we were taught genes in God. We
[42:12] know we can say all of that. We know our
[42:14] final destination. We know our eternal
[42:16] destination. We know what we will be. We
[42:19] know the perfection that's there.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; But the earthly life, hallelujah.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is most mysterious.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why sometimes it's
[42:28] always wise to just look back, see your
[42:30] upbringing, see where God rose you from,
[42:33] see your mother, see your father, see
[42:34] your family. It tells a story and God's
[42:37] divine intervention in our king.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. And God
[42:43] doesn't tell us everything up front
[42:46] &gt;&gt; because God knows when the enemy is
[42:48] coming.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; God knows. God sees the enemy coming.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you something. God
[42:53] is always prepared for the enemy.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Always prepare for the enemy. And when
[42:59] you feel vulnerable, when you feel most
[43:01] exposed, when you feel confused, then he
[43:04] comes sweeping in like mama.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He comes sweeping down from
[43:08] the heights above.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Then you can say, "Where he leads me, I
[43:13] will follow." Amen.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; God is always ready for the enemy.
[43:18] Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name.
[43:21] Because sometimes, you know, sickness
[43:22] wants to destroy your life. Sometimes
[43:25] frustration wants to make you insane and
[43:28] send you to a mad house. Sometimes the
[43:30] devil just comes and he busts up your
[43:32] home. Hallelujah. And you don't know
[43:34] what is happening and you seem forsaken
[43:36] and you and you when you just you just
[43:37] want to give up.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; No, brothers and sisters, you have been
[43:41] led this morning.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; There is an angel. He's keeping you in
[43:45] the way.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; He is saying beware of him and obey his
[43:50] voice.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. M
[43:52] &gt;&gt; he says provoke him not. Hallelujah.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; For he will not pardon your
[43:59] transgressions.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Pardon is in this angel.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; This angel can pardon.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; How many needs a pardon?
[44:08] &gt;&gt; And the prophet always tells us the
[44:10] pardon is not a pardon until it is
[44:12] accepted as a pardon.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Have you heard of the pardoning grace of
[44:16] the living word that comes out of his
[44:18] mouth? Your sins which are many, they
[44:20] are forgiven. Pick up your bed, walk and
[44:23] walk and go. Sin no more.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Pardon is in his word.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for a leader that can pardon.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for a leader who knows the way
[44:35] this morning.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for a leader who's interested
[44:39] in showing me what I'm born for. Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for a leader who's picked me up
[44:44] from the market to put me back in the
[44:46] economy of God where I belong.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he says, "For my name
[44:52] is in him."
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Powerful.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; My name is in him. God is telling Moses,
[44:59] &gt;&gt; "This angel is not just a messenger.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; This angel, this one that is going
[45:04] before you, he carries my identity.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; The one that is going before you, he has
[45:10] my character. He has my attributes.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; He is not coming in his own name. My
[45:17] name is in him. Amen.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; The angel of God, hallelujah, is God in
[45:22] another form.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; This is Christ in another form.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "But if thou shalt indeed obey,
[45:32] obey his voice and do all that I speak,
[45:35] then I will be an enemy unto thine
[45:38] enemies."
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[45:42] &gt;&gt; an enemy.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Unto thine enemies. Hallelujah.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; You don't have to fight your battle.
[45:50] Stand still and see the salvation of the
[45:52] Lord.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; This is the covenant promise.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; He can't go back on his word.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not just protection for
[46:02] you.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; This is warfare on your behalf.
[46:05] Hallelujah.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; I mean, how many of us faced enemies on
[46:09] this journey?
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Enemies. Enemies of the soul. Enemies of
[46:16] the mind,
[46:17] &gt;&gt; enemies of the family,
[46:20] &gt;&gt; enemies of the body,
[46:22] &gt;&gt; how many times there's Amalachites
[46:24] standing there waiting for you,
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Canaanites waiting for you,
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Hitittites waiting to stop you and
[46:29] prevent you from entering
[46:31] &gt;&gt; into your inheritance to stop you from
[46:33] becoming what God ordained you to be.
[46:36] How many time there's cancers and tumors
[46:38] and sickness trying to bring you
[46:40] &gt;&gt; to a premature grave?
[46:42] &gt;&gt; How many time Mr. Frustration is
[46:44] standing there.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Mr. Stress is standing there, they want
[46:47] to kill you and take away your peace and
[46:49] and and fool you with tension.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; But God said if you hear his voice, if
[46:56] you follow the angel, he will be an
[46:59] enemy unto your enemies.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if the enemy comes to
[47:04] steal your peace, to steal your joy,
[47:07] that angel will say, "That's my child.
[47:09] That's my son. That's my daughter. I
[47:12] give them peace. I give them joy. Satan,
[47:15] you get back on them.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; He told Abraham, "I am your shield and
[47:21] thy exceeding great reward."
[47:24] &gt;&gt; That's what he said to Abraham. He said
[47:26] to Abraham, "They that come against you,
[47:28] I will come against them." Are we not
[47:30] the seed of Abraham?
[47:32] &gt;&gt; He said to Abraham, "He that hates you,
[47:34] I will hate them."
[47:36] &gt;&gt; He that comes to fight against you, I
[47:38] will fight them.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; He that blesses you, I'll bless them.
[47:43] Hallelujah. Why? Because Abraham is
[47:47] family.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like he said to Saul, he
[47:55] said, "Why persecute us the why
[47:58] persecuted the thou me?" Saul.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Who was Saul persecuting?
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; He was persecuting the church.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. the genes of God, the attributes of
[48:10] God, the saints in the church.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; But when God shook him off his ass, the
[48:14] angel asked him, "Why persecute thou
[48:16] me?"
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Because if you come against these people
[48:19] who come against thee,
[48:21] &gt;&gt; oh my hallelujah.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "I will be an enemy to your
[48:25] enemies
[48:26] &gt;&gt; and an adversary unto thine adversaries,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; for my angel shall go before thee and
[48:33] bring thee in." Hallelujah.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. to the place that he has prepared
[48:38] into your placing. Hallelujah. If you
[48:40] have not placed this place, this one,
[48:43] this one that we're talking about in
[48:44] place this morning.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Verse 23. Unto the Amorites and the
[48:50] Hittites and the Pyizzes and the
[48:51] Canaanites and the Hivites and the
[48:53] Jebusites, and I will cut them off.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Reading.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; I will cut them off. Hallelujah.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Do you want to see God cut off
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. the enemies in your life.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Do you want to see God cut off the
[49:09] enemies that are trying to stop you from
[49:11] coming into your inheritance?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Do you want to see God break the powers
[49:16] of those things that are hindering you
[49:18] from walking with God?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Or you just want to come here to Son of
[49:22] Man Ministries and be a nice church
[49:24] member
[49:26] &gt;&gt; or do you want to see the enemies your
[49:27] enemies come down?
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "I
[49:32] &gt;&gt; will cut them down. Hallelujah.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning?
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; We are speaking about the unseen heaven.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in this way.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Our thoughts this morning is just to
[49:45] raise your level of awareness. Amen.
[49:48] Because many people uh you know they
[49:50] walk through life unconscious of the
[49:52] unseen world.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; They're not sensitized to that reality
[49:56] that there is another realm more real
[49:59] than what our eyes can see.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like the prophet preached a great
[50:03] message looking to the unseen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; We want to open our eyes to the other
[50:08] world
[50:10] &gt;&gt; because in that realm God has a ministry
[50:13] of angels and they are here to keep us
[50:17] in the way.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Listen to Numbers chapter 22:15.
[50:24] Hallelujah.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; I I have a strong um biblical
[50:29] background, Bible background. always
[50:32] when I first came to the message I I I
[50:34] found it very strange that you know the
[50:36] people were reading quotes and if you
[50:39] came from a biblical background it was
[50:41] very hard for me but when you find that
[50:43] the prophet said everything that I
[50:44] preach is in the Bible then you take
[50:46] what he preached and you'll find it in
[50:48] the
[50:50] &gt;&gt; you see hallelujah that this message is
[50:52] thus said the lord can't shake you can't
[50:55] move you everyone is falling apart can't
[50:57] shake
[50:57] &gt;&gt; hallelujah when you have a personal
[51:00] experience with this message. Can you
[51:03] &gt;&gt; can she? Hallelujah. Let me tell you my
[51:06] own experience. For me, God spoke to me
[51:08] directly.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many of the people that came along
[51:13] in our journey, they've gone back to the
[51:14] world, back into denomination and so on.
[51:17] But for me, it became real and personal.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Let me give you this short testimony.
[51:22] You know it was maybe in ' 81 or ' 82 I
[51:26] was at university and you know those
[51:28] days you just um when you present the
[51:31] gospel you just want to completely
[51:33] annihilate the your opposition women
[51:36] standing in your way you just want to
[51:37] crush them down you just memorize all
[51:40] the scriptures and the quotes and
[51:41] whatever it may be if they're talking
[51:43] about you know the godhead and they're
[51:44] talking about you know baptism and all
[51:46] of those things there you you got the
[51:48] scriptures just flowing like that there
[51:49] and you just crushed them there and
[51:51] there There was this one boy, his name
[51:53] was Mvin and and he he he was he was he
[51:57] was overwhelmed. He comes from a strong
[51:58] Christian, you know, his brothers, his
[52:00] daddy, you know, were pastors in the
[52:02] denomination. And then um he was so
[52:04] excited. He took some message books from
[52:06] me and he went away and I was very happy
[52:08] and I was waiting for him on Monday to
[52:10] come back. So when we got back on Monday
[52:12] at campus and and then he he came to see
[52:14] me and then he began to tell me things
[52:16] that I never knew about brother.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I never knew about the tax case. I never
[52:21] do because now they presented like the
[52:22] man was a thief. He was a rogue. He was,
[52:24] you know, a hocus pocus and all the
[52:26] funny things inside there. And now I
[52:28] never heard of this thing. Sir, I came
[52:30] home. I was asking my wife, she doesn't
[52:31] know. I asked my brother-in-law, you
[52:33] know, I even he doesn't know. I asked
[52:34] the pastor, he was more confused than
[52:36] me. I asked another one, another one,
[52:38] more confused. And it was just my whole
[52:41] foundation under me was shaking. Brother
[52:43] Willie, I didn't know what to do because
[52:46] I'm not getting the answers that I
[52:47] actually need. And at that time I was
[52:51] with pastor Dan Naidu and I used to run
[52:53] the tape service. I never had a car. I
[52:55] so I had a a box I used to put all the
[52:58] tapes inside take it to church with my
[53:00] book and you know write it and you know
[53:02] grew up in a very legalist
[53:04] those days you know. So and then you
[53:06] know like if the tape is not wound to
[53:09] you know I mean personing is not wound
[53:11] it used to irritate me you know. So you
[53:13] know I used to tell people don't buy
[53:15] food buy a tape recorder and all those
[53:16] funny things. So and then um and and I
[53:20] was so troubled by so many things
[53:22] because of what they had shared with me.
[53:25] Then um uh one sister came to me, in
[53:28] fact it was sister muan and they had
[53:31] she's still living. She's at brother
[53:32] Tony uh at Eagle Tabernacle. And then
[53:35] she came to me and said to me, "Pastor
[53:38] Rodney, this tape is not working."
[53:42] &gt;&gt; The message is called All Things Spre
[53:44] 1962. It's not working.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And then you know um for me um I said in
[53:50] my mind I'm saying you need to buy a new
[53:52] tape recorder. you know, nothing wrong
[53:54] with the tape. So, anyhow, I I came home
[53:56] and for me, I'm I'm a person where
[53:58] everything before I go to bed has to be
[54:00] back in place.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; So, I'll never go to bed until I put the
[54:03] tapes back until it's all rewound and
[54:05] put it in. We living in a in a small
[54:07] building there, one room, you know, our
[54:10] bedroom was the bed was here. All the
[54:11] tapes was around us. We used to sleep in
[54:14] the center. We we just had one daughter
[54:16] at that time. And then um uh my wife was
[54:20] making tea for me. You know the lounge
[54:22] and everything's open planned because
[54:24] you you sleep there, eat there,
[54:26] everything is there. And then whilst I'm
[54:29] sitting there and I'm getting all sorted
[54:31] out, I said, "Let me leave this tape for
[54:33] the last."
[54:35] And then when I pressed that tape to
[54:38] play,
[54:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[54:41] What I needed to know,
[54:43] &gt;&gt; God spoke to me directly.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He began to explain the
[54:48] how the text came tax case started what
[54:52] happened all the different things inside
[54:54] there and many other things God gave me
[54:57] and vindicated and proved to me that
[54:59] this message is the same
[55:02] &gt;&gt; more and I can give you countless ones
[55:05] that's why it doesn't bother me when
[55:06] this one says that one that one he's
[55:08] finding evidence he's finding mistakes
[55:10] and so on for me I can see it hallelujah
[55:14] &gt;&gt; this is a profound Hallelujah.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; And when you can see yourself that your
[55:18] message is anointed for you, nothing can
[55:20] sh
[55:21] &gt;&gt; nothing can actually move you.
[55:23] Hallelujah.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. So yeah,
[55:28] Numbers chapter 22 and from verse 15. So
[55:30] I'm just picking up a few scriptures to
[55:32] just dramatize the moment to help
[55:34] crystallize our thoughts and to kind of
[55:36] make this thing real today. Now you know
[55:39] numbers chapter 22 it deals with a time
[55:41] when Israel was marching towards the the
[55:44] promised land and they were on a journey
[55:47] under a pillar of fire they were under a
[55:50] prophetic miss message they were under
[55:52] divine leadership
[55:53] &gt;&gt; and whilst of course they're coming
[55:55] under the lead of Moses and whilst they
[55:58] the uh they are in this exodus and
[56:00] they're coming out of Egypt they
[56:02] encountered Balam
[56:04] &gt;&gt; and Balam was a man was a prophet
[56:08] He was a man with a gift.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; But he was misaligned to the will of
[56:13] God.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; So it is in this chapter that God pulls
[56:17] back the veil and and we will begin to
[56:20] see the how the unseen realm intervenes
[56:24] in earthly matters.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now verses 1 to 14 tells us
[56:29] how saw the children of Israel marching
[56:33] and he became so afraid. He had heard of
[56:35] what had happened at the Red Sea and how
[56:38] they had defeated the Amalachites. He
[56:39] had heard about the prophet Moses. He
[56:41] had heard about the pillar of fire and
[56:44] ba this Moabitete king became terrified.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Now he tries to cut them off from their
[56:51] inheritance. He tried to destroy his
[56:53] people because he feels threatened by
[56:56] them.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Satan sees a
[56:59] church. He sees a bride that is raising
[57:02] up in this hour
[57:04] &gt;&gt; and he wants this earth for his kingdom
[57:06] and he sees a people who has a title to
[57:09] inheritance and he's trying to stop her
[57:12] from going in.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; So Bale now solicits the help of Balam
[57:19] &gt;&gt; and he sends his people and he sends
[57:21] some of his messages. He sends some of
[57:23] his officials to get Balum to come and
[57:26] curse them. I mean you know the story.
[57:28] This is Sunday school. Hallelujah. And
[57:30] Bale means you know um destruction and
[57:33] Balum means the destroyer of the people.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; And Balam lived by along the uh the
[57:40] river Euphrates. And in that hour he was
[57:43] coming up against the church of God in
[57:46] all subtlety to destroy them.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; He was part of a false kingdom that was
[57:51] opposed to God's kingdom. He was under
[57:54] the headship of Bao.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:58] But Moses, a prophet, is led by an
[58:01] angel. I want you to see that.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Moses is led by an angel.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Moses was born a deliverer.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Moses was was Moses met the pillar of
[58:11] fire.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Moses was commissioned by the great I
[58:14] am.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Moses was given the word to break the
[58:17] powers of darkness around the people.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Moses was taking them to an inheritance
[58:23] by divine leadership. Hallelujah. Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. Every
[58:28] true minister, true minister is a Moses.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Every true minister is doing that in his
[58:33] church.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Every true minister has a church. Has a
[58:36] true flock because God gives him the
[58:38] flock. Hallelujah. Every true church has
[58:41] to have a shepherd ministry. That
[58:43] shepherd ministry is to break the
[58:45] bondage. Is to lift the oppression of
[58:47] the people that the task masters of
[58:50] Egypt is putting upon them and to bring
[58:52] them into their inheritance.
[58:55] Hallelujah.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; So watch this now here. Whether it's in
[58:59] the natural or whether it's in the
[59:00] spiritual, there's always conflict in
[59:03] these realms.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; The world we live in is just a
[59:07] reflection of the unseen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; You if you want to know what realm
[59:14] someone is under today,
[59:17] &gt;&gt; watch what comes out of their mouths.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Watch they speak. Watch their speech.
[59:22] Watch where their thoughts dwell. Watch
[59:25] their dress. Watch the their craving in
[59:27] their hearts. Watch the the desires.
[59:30] Watch how they live their lives. And it
[59:32] will reveal where they are being
[59:34] influenced from
[59:36] &gt;&gt; because this is an age of flesh and
[59:39] spirit uniting.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; This is the age where hell is formed on
[59:44] the earth. This is the age where devils
[59:46] are becoming incarnate.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[59:50] &gt;&gt; there are devils. Hopefully not here but
[59:52] there are devils that are sitting here
[59:55] today. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir.
[59:58] Through nicolatanism through paganism
[1:00:00] through Jezebelism devils are becoming
[1:00:03] incarnate through the antichrist spirit
[1:00:06] through the false prophet through the
[1:00:08] beast devils are becoming incarnate.
[1:00:11] But glory to God through justification,
[1:00:13] through sanctification, through the
[1:00:15] battle of the Holy Ghost, God is coming
[1:00:17] down to the hearts of his sons and
[1:00:20] daughters. Hallelujah. While Satan is
[1:00:24] binding the people and conquering the
[1:00:26] lady, God has a message that is washing
[1:00:29] and cleansing his church. Why there is a
[1:00:31] false prophet bringing a corrupt form of
[1:00:35] worship? While there is a doctrine of
[1:00:37] Jezebel that is exalting herself and
[1:00:39] trying to kill the the the true prophet
[1:00:41] and the true word. Whilst that is
[1:00:43] happening, God has a true ministry
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; that can bring the new birth that can
[1:00:48] bring the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; It is happening brothers and sisters.
[1:00:52] Satan incarnate in three stages. And God
[1:00:56] incarnated in three stages.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; The wheat and the tears. Children of
[1:01:00] light, children of darkness, children of
[1:01:02] wisdom, and children of faith.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; The tree of life and the tree of death
[1:01:08] standing side by side.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; The natural church and the spiritual
[1:01:12] church, Israel and Jacob in the womb of
[1:01:15] this age.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Moses is leading the children
[1:01:21] of Israel out of Egypt and he's bringing
[1:01:23] them into their inheritance
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; into the Holy Ghost to place them
[1:01:29] positionally.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But along the way he meets another man.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Who follow me who is preaching about the
[1:01:40] same God.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; In a different way.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; A man who has a ministry but he has
[1:01:47] unclean lips. M
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; and a false doctrine is flowing out of
[1:01:51] his mouth.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; two trees in the garden of
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Eden.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; He He who eats the Balan tree
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; will die.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; But he who eats the Moses tree will
[1:02:04] live.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; One to lead you into your inheritance.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; The other one seek to hybridize and
[1:02:10] destroy the original seed. Amen. What an
[1:02:13] hour we are living.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; What a place to walk with God. Yes.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; May the Holy Ghost enlighten your minds.
[1:02:20] May you understand. Hallelujah.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; What the Holy Spirit is to accomplish in
[1:02:25] our lives.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; What the seven se is to do for us. This
[1:02:30] this isn't small talk here. This isn't
[1:02:32] word play here.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Quickening power is here.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The energize that God
[1:02:38] himself is present letting his people
[1:02:41] into a rhythm of faith. He wants to make
[1:02:44] you faith the children this this
[1:02:46] morning. Why? Because faith is the
[1:02:48] victory that overcometh the world.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; So Moses now is leading his church into
[1:02:54] an inheritance.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Along the way, he encounters a man who's
[1:02:59] operating from a different realm. But
[1:03:02] this man also carries a measure of the
[1:03:06] supernatural. M
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; and when you look at this man Balen very
[1:03:09] carefully from verses 1 to4 um in
[1:03:13] numbers chapter 22
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; we watch him where we going to pick up
[1:03:17] is under temptation. Yes,
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; this prophet of God,
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; he's under temptation and he's going
[1:03:24] through a trial.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; And in that late hour, we find him
[1:03:28] having a desire for popularity.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And in the late hour, he was willing to
[1:03:34] sell and market his gift to the world.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; He was a man who had the measure of
[1:03:41] genuine spiritual manifestations in his
[1:03:44] life.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He was a man who had access to God. He
[1:03:48] he was a man who knew how to approach
[1:03:50] God correctly.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; But now we are watching him in a time of
[1:03:54] temptation.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; First he resists to a degree.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; In verse 12, God speaks to him directly
[1:04:02] and says, "Thou shalt not go with them."
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And he and Balam refuses the first
[1:04:10] offer. And he sends Bailock's messengers
[1:04:13] along the way with all the gifts, all
[1:04:16] the officials, with all the flattery.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; It seems like he's he seems like he has
[1:04:22] victory.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; But here's the teaching.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't back down because you won
[1:04:31] the first round.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Satan does not give up and fold in
[1:04:36] because you resisted once.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah. He studies you.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; He learns your vulnerabilities.
[1:04:45] Hallelujah.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; I always say to the church, if you got
[1:04:49] no problems, you got problems. You have
[1:04:51] a big problem. Hallelujah. If Satan is
[1:04:53] not doing something upsetting your home,
[1:04:56] upsetting your family, upsetting your
[1:04:57] business, upsetting your job, upsetting
[1:05:00] something in your life, something
[1:05:01] otherwise what are you before him then?
[1:05:04] You like a big marshmallow, a big
[1:05:06] lollipop or something like that comes
[1:05:07] and give you a nice good lick. Oh, you
[1:05:09] came Sunday to church so tasty and
[1:05:12] hallelujah.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Satan does not give up and folding
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; because you resisted once.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; He studies you, brothers and sisters.
[1:05:25] He's not worried about the denomination.
[1:05:28] He's got you under his microscope.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And for many, this is where
[1:05:33] deception sets in
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; because it becomes temporary
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; because people have hollow victories.
[1:05:39] They have emotional testimonies. Oh, I
[1:05:41] overcame. Oh, I resisted the devil. Oh,
[1:05:44] they shout and scream. Hallelujah. But
[1:05:46] what they don't realize,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; what they don't realize, this is not a
[1:05:51] one round fight.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, Satan lets you
[1:05:57] throw some punches in the first round to
[1:05:59] see where your strengths are. And it
[1:06:01] gives you a sense of overconfidence
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; because watch the scriptures. Bail
[1:06:08] studied him.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; He studied Balam because watch how Bale
[1:06:13] responds after he says no.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he's going to come
[1:06:18] with the same enticement to you.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Because Bao is a type of Satan. When his
[1:06:24] first attempt fails, he doesn't give up.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; He upgrades his approach.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Watch in verse 15.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; And Bale sent yet again princes more and
[1:06:39] more honorable than they.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. First he sent some
[1:06:44] common messengers and some officials.
[1:06:47] Now you upgrades
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; more and more honorable than they.
[1:06:51] Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; When the devil fails the first time, he
[1:06:54] doesn't stop.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; He's not stopping until you're changed.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He escalates.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And verse 16, and they came
[1:07:05] to Balam and and said to him, "Thus
[1:07:08] sayeth Ba the son of Zapor, let nothing
[1:07:10] I pray thee, hinder thee from coming
[1:07:13] unto me, for I will promote thee unto
[1:07:17] very great honor, and I will do
[1:07:20] whatsoever thou sayest unto me, come
[1:07:22] therefore, I pray thee, and curse this
[1:07:25] people." M
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; watch the evil influence.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; A man trying to pull a prophet to his
[1:07:34] side
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; to express his own will to him.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Bailic is flattery. He's offering
[1:07:41] wealth.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; He's offering position. He's offering
[1:07:45] power, seduction by influence.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Why? so that he can channel his own
[1:07:51] hatred and fear through another man to
[1:07:54] curse a people he feels threatened by.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; And today nothing has changed.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; How many people today fall for the same
[1:08:03] old trick?
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; How many people are gullible who are
[1:08:07] soft and compromising?
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; How many people are so easily seduced by
[1:08:12] position, by praise, by prosperity, by
[1:08:15] money? How many people get tied into
[1:08:17] influences that is bent on on destroying
[1:08:20] the truth?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; How many people get lured into a trap
[1:08:23] only because they have a crave in the
[1:08:25] heart for things that are not theirs and
[1:08:28] they're discontented with their portion
[1:08:30] in life
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; and they lack godliness or contentment
[1:08:34] which is great gain.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; And they get sucked up into uncertain
[1:08:38] riches and pierce the souls with many
[1:08:40] sorrows.
[1:08:44] And Bale is caught up in the danger
[1:08:46] zone.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; And he began to reason, you know, maybe
[1:08:54] God didn't hear me. No.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's a way we can make this
[1:08:58] thing working.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; After God didn't tell me pain, we don't
[1:09:02] go now.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us. And now he begins
[1:09:09] entertaining the thought that perhaps
[1:09:11] God might be okay with this.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And there you find people wrestling with
[1:09:16] their own thoughts and they're trying to
[1:09:18] quote the word not to submit
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; but to justify their desire.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Find people living in limbo, pretending
[1:09:25] it's spiritual,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; but knowing deep inside they're trying
[1:09:29] to get permission to do what they
[1:09:31] already want.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Let's pause for a moment. Let let that
[1:09:38] settle in. Think a little bit. Watch how
[1:09:40] God is defining it for us this morning.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking on the unseen
[1:09:46] angels to keep us in the way because me
[1:09:49] too. I'm looking for that influence.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; I want to surrender. I want to yield to
[1:09:53] that unseen influence. I want to become
[1:09:56] a channel of communication for that
[1:09:58] unseen this morning.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Friends, listen to me. I don't want a
[1:10:01] Holy Ghost that that that just wants to
[1:10:04] dodge hell.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't want a life that is just
[1:10:06] better than a sinner in a nightclub.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost to give me an
[1:10:12] uncction to teach me all things.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Watch how Balam watch how they came unto
[1:10:22] Balam. And they said said unto him in
[1:10:24] verse 16, "Thus said Bale the son of
[1:10:27] Zapor, let nothing I pray thee hinder
[1:10:29] thee for uh from coming unto me."
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:10:34] forceful persuasion.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Thus say not thus say the Lord thou th
[1:10:40] say thus say Satan.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; See let nothing hinder you from coming
[1:10:46] unto me.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Watch now. Now now comes the bait.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; The bait is verse 17. For I will promote
[1:10:54] thee unto very great honor.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Does that sound familiar?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; That is what Lucifer did in heaven. That
[1:11:03] is what Lucifer did in the garden of
[1:11:04] Eden.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; You shall be as God's. You shall um not
[1:11:10] surely die.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Breaking the unity. That is what he did
[1:11:13] in heaven.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; You see, always promising position and
[1:11:18] power
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; while sowing division.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Satan's oldest trick is to elev itself.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Elevate self.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Appeal to ambition. Hallelujah.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; We love him.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; You got nothing to be scared of this
[1:11:38] morning. You're walking for God.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; If you're hungry for God, you got
[1:11:42] nothing to be scared of.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost is finding you, living
[1:11:46] in sin this morning, blood is available.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; There is a fountain open in the house.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; If you confess your sins, he's just
[1:11:53] faithful to forgive your sins.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch this man here with a
[1:12:00] watered down
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; faith lusting for power. Hallelujah.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And Bale sends his ambassadors and they
[1:12:08] plead with him for I will promote thee
[1:12:11] unto very great honor and I will do
[1:12:13] whatsoever thou sayest unto me. Come
[1:12:16] therefore I pray thee and curse this
[1:12:19] people. Verse 18. And Balam answered and
[1:12:22] said unto the servants of Baal, if watch
[1:12:25] now he's answering. M
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; if Bale could give me his house full of
[1:12:31] silver and of gold, I cannot go beyond
[1:12:36] the word of the Lord my God to do less
[1:12:39] or more.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Discern what's happening here.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; It looks like the man is making a real
[1:12:48] stand for God here.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Just like Eve, too.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; We shall surely die if we eat that tree.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; he kept talking.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; He kept talking.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; He kept talking.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; It did not end there.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And then finally, she saw it was good
[1:13:07] for food.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; He saw it was good for food.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Finally, she saw it was a tree designed
[1:13:13] to make one wise.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Too much talking.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Too much talking.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And then living a life of pretense and
[1:13:21] hypocrisy.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:25] Hallelujah.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; But see how Bum starts off. Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] Give me a house full of gold and silver.
[1:13:36] And God help me.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I cannot go beyond the
[1:13:42] word of the Lord my God to do less or
[1:13:44] more.
[1:13:46] Hallelujah.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Watch the very next verse.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Verse 19. when you talk talk talk too
[1:13:53] much. Now therefore I pray thee Terry
[1:13:57] don't go
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; after saying that there hallelujah
[1:14:04] don't go wait your t stay one more night
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; also he had this night that I may know
[1:14:11] what the lord will say unto me
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; no more
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; what the lord will say unto me more
[1:14:19] hallelujah after said to him in verse 12
[1:14:22] thou shalt not go with
[1:14:24] M
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; now Bam is seeking a second opinion.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Not because he's confused,
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; but because he's hoping for a different
[1:14:34] answer that suits his desire.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan found something.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; He found Bam did not have a true
[1:14:44] revelation of God.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Satan found the place that wasn't
[1:14:48] covered up.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Satan found a place where there was no
[1:14:51] evidence of the new birth. Satan found
[1:14:54] the place where this man could halt
[1:14:55] between two opinions because this man
[1:14:57] never really sold out to the true living
[1:15:00] God.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Satan found that place where this man
[1:15:03] just had mental faith.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Satan found that place.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; And you find your place too.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You can't bluff the word.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; You can't bluff the word. You can't
[1:15:20] bluff God's name.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And you can't bluff the devil neither
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; because the devil knows when you are
[1:15:28] bluffing.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; It's like God says, well, you know, when
[1:15:31] you say you believe and you genuine, you
[1:15:33] know, the the ur the yurum lights up and
[1:15:37] and and shows that you have faith and
[1:15:39] that you you are speaking the truth.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Well, the devil has something true. When
[1:15:44] you're bluffing,
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; he knows that it is own self coming back
[1:15:49] to him.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knows that it is his own
[1:15:53] tactic because bluff originated in him.
[1:15:56] God don't
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; bluff.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; It is Satan that has a bow and no hell.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; It is God that has a quiver full of
[1:16:04] arrows. Is the word that goes forth like
[1:16:06] a sharp sword.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Are you following?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hi. Hallelujah.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; This is our life.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We speaking about you.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:16:22] So as we look further here now, we see
[1:16:24] this man is under real temptation. He's
[1:16:27] slipping away from the word of God in
[1:16:29] verse 20. And God came unto Bam at at
[1:16:34] night and said unto uh unto him, if the
[1:16:36] men come to call thee, rise up and go
[1:16:38] with them. But yet the word which I
[1:16:41] shall say unto thee, thou shalt um that
[1:16:45] shalt thou do,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; this is not God going along with B.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; No, this is God exposing him.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Friends, God don't tolerate nonsense.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; God don't tolerate foolishness.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; This is God. Catch me here. This is God
[1:17:05] realizing I have revealed truth to you
[1:17:09] and you don't realize that truth has a
[1:17:11] responsibility.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; When I reveal truth to you, I expect you
[1:17:16] to walk in obedience to truth
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; and I expect you to value the privilege
[1:17:21] of knowing truth.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; You mean you want to play around the
[1:17:27] truth
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; after truth has already been revealed to
[1:17:31] you. You want to play around with truth.
[1:17:33] You want me to give you something? What
[1:17:35] do you ask for? Something more.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; You want me to give you something more?
[1:17:40] You want me to give you something else
[1:17:42] after I've expressed my will and made it
[1:17:44] clear and plain to you? Well,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; I see you've shown me what your real
[1:17:50] desire is.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Your real desire is that you don't have
[1:17:54] a love for the word.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; So now you're going to need a strong
[1:17:59] delusion to believe the lie and be
[1:18:01] damned by it. Yeah.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; So God came and said unto you, okay,
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; since you want your desire more than the
[1:18:13] revealed word,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; since you feel God must deal with you
[1:18:20] differently,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; you find people like that, they want to
[1:18:23] be extra special.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; God must deal with you differently. God
[1:18:28] have one plan for everybody but one
[1:18:31] special plan for you to do what you want
[1:18:33] to do.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; God said okay
[1:18:39] you want to go go ahead go and walk in
[1:18:42] the live and live in the thing that you
[1:18:43] want because you don't want Christ to be
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; and God was giving the man his own
[1:18:49] desire.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But if Bam had any revelation, any
[1:18:54] fear of God, he would have cried out to
[1:18:58] Bailo and said, "What are you trying to
[1:19:00] involve me with?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with you? Are you mad? Are
[1:19:04] you suicidal?
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; You coming up against the kingdom of
[1:19:07] God? You never hear about the slain
[1:19:08] lamb. You never hear about water from
[1:19:10] the rock. You never hear of man from
[1:19:12] heaven. You never hear about the dead
[1:19:13] angel in Egypt. You're coming up against
[1:19:16] God's anointed prophet Moses.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; You want to curse God's people.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Didn't you hear what happened down
[1:19:22] in Egypt? You're not afraid of the
[1:19:23] pillar of fire.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; You're bypassing all of that and you
[1:19:27] come with your evil plan to seduce me
[1:19:29] and make me an accomplice in your
[1:19:31] scheme.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; If you don't love God, I love God.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; That is how the man should act.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; But the man is playing around with
[1:19:41] people who want to curse God's people.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; That's why compromise is always getting
[1:19:47] to someone.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you become a compro
[1:19:51] compromiser, the first thing happens is
[1:19:53] you lose the fear of God.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Then you lose respect for
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Then you start you start to flirt with
[1:20:04] the enemy for personal gain.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is people that are
[1:20:09] walking in the realm of the flesh,
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; just religious in their mind.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But missing the real
[1:20:17] calling.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is people who fail to discern
[1:20:20] the word and the plan of God because
[1:20:22] they're so self-centered and egotistic.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; And they fail to realize that this is
[1:20:28] God's people.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; That's God's servant. Hallelujah. That's
[1:20:32] God's promise that it is God that is
[1:20:34] amongst us that is bringing his word to
[1:20:36] pass.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; My we are speaking on the unseen realm.
[1:20:40] Angels to keep us in the way. I'm I'm
[1:20:43] still reading my my scriptures. I forgot
[1:20:46] what time I started.
[1:20:48] And Bam rose up. What time did I start?
[1:20:51] And B. Okay, we we'll find a place to
[1:20:54] stop. And Bam rose up in the morning.
[1:20:57] Watch now.
[1:20:59] Hallelujah.
[1:21:02] God says, "Okay, you want to go, go.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Go do what you want. If you don't want
[1:21:07] Christ to be your head, go.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Go, go."
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't waste time. If you
[1:21:13] want to go, go,
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; go.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:16] And Bam rose up in the morning and
[1:21:18] settled his ass and he went with the
[1:21:20] princess of Mo of Moab. My now he's un
[1:21:25] unequally yolked.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Now he's in a false union already.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit is checking. You know, I
[1:21:35] wonder how high this promotion is going
[1:21:37] to be.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; I wonder about my new office they will
[1:21:40] give me. Hey, my new car, petrol car.
[1:21:42] Hey, my iMac, my new salary. Oh my. Just
[1:21:46] look at the honor, the respect they
[1:21:48] giving me. What a privilege. What a
[1:21:50] position.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And the man is boasting in his heart.
[1:21:54] And he said, I tell you what,
[1:21:56] if I was not perseverant perseverant, if
[1:22:00] I did not persist, not even God could
[1:22:02] have stopped me.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; I I I get God to change his mind.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He had me go.
[1:22:15] You see, this man is in the permissible
[1:22:17] will of God.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; He's in his own will.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, some people can twist
[1:22:23] the word and live
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; convincingly.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; You better have rugged faith in this
[1:22:29] hour.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; God is looking for real sons and
[1:22:32] daughters of God.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; And God's anger was kindled because he
[1:22:38] went my Hallelujah. God's anger was
[1:22:43] kindled because he went.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Because when God said go, hallelujah,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; he should have fallen on his face and
[1:22:50] said, "Lord, I'm so sorry for thinking
[1:22:53] like this.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You said go because you want to show me
[1:22:56] how far I've gone under that influence
[1:22:59] already."
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; You get that?
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I hope you are catching the
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Of his divine will and
[1:23:07] desire. Let the word stimulate your
[1:23:09] faith. Amen to walk deep with God
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; because there is a conscience
[1:23:13] consciousness where I have to look in my
[1:23:16] own self to see where I am standing
[1:23:19] where my desire is. Hallelujah. I've got
[1:23:22] to see the foundation where I'm standing
[1:23:25] upon.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Can I be easily moved when I'm under a
[1:23:29] little pressure?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Can I be exploited and manipulated
[1:23:32] because I'm gullible and I can't tell
[1:23:34] big high people lay off me. Hallelujah.
[1:23:38] Because pressure moves a lot of people
[1:23:41] out of the will of God.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Pressure moves people into
[1:23:45] false union.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Pressure bursts pipes.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; You better have something in you to keep
[1:23:52] the pressure out of your mind.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Because brother madam tells us this is
[1:23:56] an age of pressure.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; You better have the place to let off the
[1:24:00] pressure.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Is alive. You have all kinds of
[1:24:03] pressure. You have family pressure,
[1:24:05] husband pressure, wife pressure, job
[1:24:07] pressure, church pressure, children
[1:24:09] pressure, school pressure, peer
[1:24:10] pressure, money pressure, all kinds of
[1:24:12] pressure. He's alive.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And don't forget, we got high blood
[1:24:17] pressure, too.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; See, but the eagle is pressurized.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; The astronauts are pressurized in the
[1:24:25] zero hour astronaut faith. They have a
[1:24:28] pressurized suit, the word suit.
[1:24:30] Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his wonderful name.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; So we are seeing through the scriptures.
[1:24:36] We are following a man under temptation.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; We are following the warfare that is
[1:24:41] unfolding in the man's mind. Things that
[1:24:44] war against the man's soul.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; We are seeing that God is watching this
[1:24:48] man under trial. And we read where it
[1:24:50] says obey the angel and provoke him not.
[1:24:54] But we find this man struggling to obey
[1:24:58] the voice of the angel and he's not
[1:25:00] being kept in the way anymore. He's been
[1:25:02] pressured to go another way.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Because the same angel, Hallelujah, that
[1:25:08] was talking to Moses was the same angel
[1:25:10] that was talking to Ba.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. Hallelujah.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Ba Bam did not believe like Janice and
[1:25:16] Jamus.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Bam believed in one God.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Bam offered the same sacrifice just like
[1:25:22] Moses.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's not about being
[1:25:25] fundamentally correct.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's not mental faith that God
[1:25:29] wants us to possess. You need
[1:25:31] revelation. You need God in the control
[1:25:33] tower of your soul.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this man, watch this
[1:25:37] here.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; This man Balen was not void of spiritual
[1:25:43] activity.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Genuine spiritual activity.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; He had visions. He had encounters. The
[1:25:48] angel came to him.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; God spoke to him. Yes,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; this man operated in the measure of the
[1:25:53] supernatural. And then when people look
[1:25:55] at this man and say, "Oh, look how great
[1:25:57] he is."
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; But watch how God is looking at the
[1:26:00] man's heart.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; He's resisting the very angel that was
[1:26:06] sent to guide him.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; How many knows our scriptures are given
[1:26:09] for inspiration?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; How many know laws is given for our
[1:26:13] correction,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; for instruction
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; in righteousness, and it is profitable
[1:26:17] for doctrine?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God's anger was killed
[1:26:21] because he went, not because of the
[1:26:23] people he was going with, but because of
[1:26:25] what was in his heart when he went.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Because the moment he went, the moment
[1:26:32] he became unequally yolked, the
[1:26:34] fellowship between him and God began to
[1:26:36] get interrupted.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Find out find out look at your spiritual
[1:26:43] life and see if your fellowship with God
[1:26:45] has been interrupted. Find out how much
[1:26:48] time that you listen to a tape, how much
[1:26:50] time you spend in prayer, how much time
[1:26:52] you want to read the Bible.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; How much time you want to really
[1:26:56] fellowship.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; And now this this man was unequally
[1:27:01] yolked. And the fellowship between him
[1:27:03] and God began to become interrupted
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; because of a desire
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; that was overriding obedience to God's
[1:27:11] word. Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; And God realized this man can sell out.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; God realized this man can be bought and
[1:27:21] turned around.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; God realized that this man can be
[1:27:24] pressured and easily influenced.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; God realizing that this man wants a
[1:27:29] kingdom here on earth instead of walking
[1:27:31] with God who has a greater kingdom.
[1:27:34] God realizes that this man is not like
[1:27:36] Moses who gets his information and
[1:27:38] instruction from the logos, the angel of
[1:27:40] God,
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; and to follow that angel for that angel
[1:27:44] was to keep them in the way.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; God realizes that this man could argue
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; with that angel
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; and this man resisting the angel all the
[1:27:55] time. He's trying to be compatible and
[1:27:57] nice to an earthly king
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Bao. Hallelujah. That's why you have to
[1:28:02] watch yourself under the light of the
[1:28:03] word.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Watch yourself in circumstances. Watch
[1:28:06] yourself when you pressurize. Watch
[1:28:08] yourself and see.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; And you said, Lord, just order my steps
[1:28:13] in your
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Nearer, my God, to thee angels
[1:28:18] to
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; We're talking about angels to keep us in
[1:28:22] the way.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; This angels could have led Balen
[1:28:25] straight to his destiny.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Straight to his destiny. right to the
[1:28:29] fulfilling of all his potential where he
[1:28:31] could be a blessing and where he could
[1:28:33] be content with his portion in life.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; But he's caught here in a place of
[1:28:38] decision of testing. He's in a trial.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; And he's taking sides against the truth.
[1:28:44] He's making the greatest mistake that he
[1:28:46] could ever make in his life.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; And he's thinking, my
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; that he can outsmart God.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Just like Judas,
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; smart Alex. Hallelujah. Judas thinking,
[1:28:59] you know, he's clever. He's thinking,
[1:29:01] you know, these uh uh Pharisees and
[1:29:05] Sadducees, these are just suckers, you
[1:29:07] know. You know, easy change I can make
[1:29:09] make from them.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; I'll point out Jesus. I'll give him a
[1:29:12] kiss. I'll point out Jesus. And you
[1:29:14] know, Jesus will just disappear into the
[1:29:16] crowd like he always does. You know, he
[1:29:17] just slips slips away. And me, I'll keep
[1:29:20] my cut. There'll be none the wiser. I'll
[1:29:23] keep my part of the bargain. And they
[1:29:24] can't claim the money back. Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; He thought he could manipulate the word
[1:29:30] for profit.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; And you find people like that always
[1:29:34] scheming, always angling to increase
[1:29:37] their earnings, even if it meant
[1:29:39] handling the son of man irreverently
[1:29:41] like him.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; People can't show reverence to the word.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, there too many
[1:29:50] people they are enjoying a spot of
[1:29:52] authority and influence in the message
[1:29:54] of the hour. the same as this man here.
[1:29:58] All the while the angel is watching you.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; And God's anger was kindled because he
[1:30:05] went and the angel of the Lord stood in
[1:30:07] the way for an adversary against him.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My who was his adversary?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; God is adversary. What did we read
[1:30:16] before? Didn't he say I'll be an enemy
[1:30:18] unto your enemies? Didn't he say I'll be
[1:30:20] an adversary unto your adversaries?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now God has become an
[1:30:26] adversary to this man.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Now he was riding upon his ass and his
[1:30:31] two servants were with him. And the ass
[1:30:33] saw the angel of the Lord standing in
[1:30:36] the wind.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; This year
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; the ass gets conscious of the unseen
[1:30:42] world.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; The ass breaks into the realm of the
[1:30:45] supernatural
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; and begins to see in two realms into two
[1:30:49] worlds in the visible and the invisible.
[1:30:51] Amen.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And the prophet who had visions and
[1:30:55] spiritual manifestations, he's so blind.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; One minute he's talking to God the next
[1:31:00] morning, he's getting up early and he's
[1:31:03] riding his ass and he's speeding after
[1:31:05] the lust of the flesh and the pride of
[1:31:07] the life and he's moving along headlong
[1:31:10] into self-destruction. And God is his
[1:31:12] adversary and he don't know it.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; He's out of fellowship, out of position,
[1:31:18] out of the will of God. and he's totally
[1:31:20] unconscious of it.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; He has a memory.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; He has memory of spiritual experiences
[1:31:26] but no present tense awareness of his
[1:31:29] condition.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That's a that's a trouble with a lot of
[1:31:32] people today. They're living on memory.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; They can't see present tense in their
[1:31:38] life.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; They are out of the will of God at
[1:31:41] present. They are bound up in sin. They
[1:31:43] misled. They have been exploited.
[1:31:44] They've been manipulated. And they're
[1:31:46] unconscious of it. M
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; that is the state of Balum but he's
[1:31:50] still preaching
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; and he's still prophesying.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Verse 23. And the ass saw the angel of
[1:31:59] the Lord standing in the way and he saw
[1:32:03] drawn in his hands.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; My the ass realized he has no pardon in
[1:32:09] his hand,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; no mercy in his hand, no grace in his
[1:32:12] hand. He got no open book in his hand.
[1:32:15] He has no seal of God in his hand. But
[1:32:18] he has a sharp sword in his hand.
[1:32:21] Revelation 10:1, he had an open book in
[1:32:23] his hand. Revelation 7:2, he has the
[1:32:26] seal of God in his hand. Revelation 1,
[1:32:28] he has seven stars in his hand. But we
[1:32:31] have the angel stands with a sharp sword
[1:32:34] unshak. Hallelujah. The word going forth
[1:32:37] in judgment.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Like David, you know when he saw the
[1:32:44] angel with a drawn sword, you know what
[1:32:45] David did? He ran quickly and made
[1:32:48] atonement and the angel took the sword
[1:32:50] back. Shields the sword back. Is that
[1:32:53] right?
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Because David went numbering the people
[1:32:57] in the flesh.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Looking for popularity.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Measuring success kindly.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Hear me here. He who marries the spirit
[1:33:09] of this world will become a widowerower
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; in the world to come.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. having a lot of friends and having
[1:33:17] a lot of contacts
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; in this world and making enemies in the
[1:33:23] next world.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you don't walk the
[1:33:26] way God wants you.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; The message don't have the desired
[1:33:29] effect and results it's supposed to have
[1:33:32] in you.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Satan traps a lot of people in the
[1:33:35] mental realm of Christianity, making
[1:33:38] them think that they're having
[1:33:39] fellowship with God in the Holies of
[1:33:41] Holies. But what they have is that they
[1:33:44] don't even know that they're in the
[1:33:45] outer court. They they are just in the
[1:33:47] inner court.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; What they have is information.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; You meet people, they have a lot of
[1:33:52] information.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; They can tell you what's in the they can
[1:33:55] tell, "Oh, there there's the ark of the
[1:33:56] covenant. Oh, there there's the man with
[1:33:58] the golden pot. Oh, there it was Aaron's
[1:34:01] rod that bothered and bloomed overnight.
[1:34:04] Hallelujah. Oh, there the shakina." They
[1:34:06] can tell you a lot of things, but they
[1:34:07] themselves have never been there.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:12] They never entered into real fellowship
[1:34:13] with God. Where the veil of self has
[1:34:16] been rendered and where the veil of God
[1:34:18] has shut the world out and they shut in
[1:34:21] the presence of God.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; For verse 23 and he says, "And the ass
[1:34:27] turned aside out of the way and went
[1:34:29] into the field and balen now watch this
[1:34:32] fellow. He sought the ass to turn into
[1:34:35] the way."
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:39] But the angel of the Lord stood in the
[1:34:40] path of the vineyards, a wall being on
[1:34:43] this side and a wall on that side. And
[1:34:46] when the ass saw the angel of the Lord,
[1:34:48] she thrust herself um into the wall and
[1:34:51] crushed Bum's foot against the wall and
[1:34:53] he smoked her again. Hallelujah. I mean,
[1:34:56] look at this.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Bam full of rage.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; He's like, you know, he's he's trying to
[1:35:02] control this donkey now. What's the
[1:35:04] matter with you?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with you? We finally got
[1:35:09] you want Ba to give this appointment to
[1:35:10] somebody else now.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; You know how many people want this
[1:35:13] position?
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Didn't Didn't you hear the angel say,
[1:35:16] "If I don't get there on time, I could
[1:35:18] lose out on this thing here. What's the
[1:35:20] matter with you now?
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; You slowing me down here? I mean, I look
[1:35:24] after you so well. I give you water. I
[1:35:26] give you food. I give you nice shelter.
[1:35:29] I gave you nice rest last night. And and
[1:35:31] and and this morning you're going slow,
[1:35:34] slow, slow, slow, slow.
[1:35:37] I checked your wounds. Nothing wrong
[1:35:39] with your feet. Your tires are in good
[1:35:41] condition. I'm expected to make so much
[1:35:44] mileage per hour. I'm supposed to get
[1:35:46] that in a certain time and you slowing
[1:35:48] me down here. What's the matter with
[1:35:50] you?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; You know, help us.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; But the ass is sensitive to the unseen
[1:35:57] dimension
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; that has opened up to her.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Angelic beings. She saw an angel with a
[1:36:05] drawn sword, eyes like flames of fire
[1:36:09] and feet like fine brass and an angel
[1:36:12] was counting and shine like the sun in
[1:36:14] his full strength. Hallelujah.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And the ass look at Bale and says, "Oh,
[1:36:20] you can beat me as much as you want. You
[1:36:22] need somebody more crazy than me to go
[1:36:25] in there. You're not going to push me in
[1:36:27] there. You rather beat me and kill me
[1:36:29] here because it's easier to deal with
[1:36:30] you here than to deal with the one that
[1:36:32] is standing there.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may not fear God. You
[1:36:38] might be some big puffed up shirt and
[1:36:40] you might think that you are somebody
[1:36:41] with all your little spiritual
[1:36:42] experiences, but me, I'm just a little
[1:36:45] donkey.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Just a small little donkey, old donkey.
[1:36:50] And and brother, I don't want to die.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't want to die because
[1:36:55] that man with a drawn sword ain't
[1:36:56] looking friendly at all.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. The men of
[1:37:04] Bao seduce him and pressurize him in a
[1:37:08] way that he could not pressurize his own
[1:37:11] donkey.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; The donkey had more resistant power than
[1:37:14] he had to do the will of God.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; The donkey is a type of the unbeliever.
[1:37:19] Is that right? But it's original. It's
[1:37:21] not a mule. is not hybridized. He could
[1:37:24] be redeemed accord according to um
[1:37:27] Exodus chapter 13, but here now he's
[1:37:30] sitting on the donkey is already
[1:37:32] hybridized and seduced.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; You ever see people fight things that
[1:37:42] are trying to help them?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; This angel here is there is to help him.
[1:37:47] He's fighting that angel. Yeah.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; You see people in the church fight the
[1:37:51] things that are trying to help them.
[1:37:52] They fight the wives. They fight the
[1:37:54] husband. They fight this person. They
[1:37:56] fight the pastor. They fight everybody.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; They fight the angel.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he starts to beat this
[1:38:04] donkey.
[1:38:06] He couldn't move the donkey, I tell you.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Verse 26. And the angel of the Lord went
[1:38:11] further and stood in a narrow place. Are
[1:38:14] you catching that? Yes.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; First the angel blocks the field in the
[1:38:18] blocks the path in the field and then
[1:38:20] Bam beats the donkey. Then the angel
[1:38:23] moves and stands in the vineyard at a
[1:38:25] tighter space and Balam strikes the
[1:38:28] donkey again. And now the angel goes
[1:38:31] further still with the sword in his hand
[1:38:34] to a narrow place. No room to turn left
[1:38:37] or to turn right.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; You see what's happening?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:43] And and and I'm telling you, be
[1:38:44] sensitive to what God is doing.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; God is closing the road inch by inch.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; But Bam keeps lashing out.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; You see believers sometime God puts
[1:38:57] roadblocks in their lives.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; God is blocking their way. Hallelujah.
[1:39:02] And sometime things are not working out.
[1:39:04] You know, business is drying up, that
[1:39:06] relationship falls apart, doors keep
[1:39:09] closing and nothing seems to work about.
[1:39:11] And God God just doesn't want you to go
[1:39:13] down the road. He don't want you to have
[1:39:15] that business. He don't want you to go
[1:39:17] with that boy. He don't want you to go
[1:39:18] with that girl. He don't want you to
[1:39:20] have that relationship. He don't want
[1:39:21] you to get involved in those things. And
[1:39:23] God is blocking the way. But all the
[1:39:25] time we are looking for a detour.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; He block your way. You're trying to
[1:39:29] climb over.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at Ben. He's so drunk with
[1:39:34] prestige, with greed, drunk with
[1:39:36] ambition, so gripped for by lust for
[1:39:40] earthly things, and he can't see that
[1:39:43] God is angry and God is blocking up the
[1:39:46] way.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord went further
[1:39:53] and stood in a narrow place. There was
[1:39:55] no way to turn either to the right um
[1:39:57] hand or to the left. Always trying to
[1:40:00] negotiate,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; trying to find a way. He go there, the
[1:40:03] angel is there. He go there, the angel
[1:40:04] is there.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Look at him. Hallelujah. Hellbent,
[1:40:08] hellbent, self-will, greed, lust for
[1:40:10] power. Amen. In the book, Peter says in
[1:40:13] second Peter 2, he says, he said, the
[1:40:15] madness of the prophet, self-will and
[1:40:18] eyes full of adultery, and the dumb ass
[1:40:20] spake with a man's voice.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; See, and Peter said, many have gone in
[1:40:26] the way of Bam in the New Testament. I'm
[1:40:29] quoting that because when you read the
[1:40:30] New Testament, you see Peter walked with
[1:40:33] angels, too.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; The same angel that came to Moses, the
[1:40:37] same angel that came to Balam is the
[1:40:38] same angel that came to Peter.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; He's the same angel that took him out of
[1:40:42] prison. He's the same angel that came on
[1:40:44] the rooftop revealing the vision. It was
[1:40:46] the same angel that brought the Holy
[1:40:47] Spirit on the day of Pentecost. It was
[1:40:49] the same angel that came to Cornelius
[1:40:52] and and told him, "Send for Peter at the
[1:40:54] house of Simon the Tanner."
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like Moses walked with the
[1:40:59] angel in his Exodus journey, Peter
[1:41:02] walked with the a same angel in his
[1:41:05] hour. And just like Moses faced Balam,
[1:41:09] Peter had men in his day going in the
[1:41:12] way of Balam.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Balam is not history.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit that still lives.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; It's still amongst us.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; So catch this now. Amen. In this very
[1:41:27] rhythm here, right here in time, we are
[1:41:30] either being anointed by angels from the
[1:41:33] presence of God or we are being
[1:41:35] influenced by fallen angels and demon
[1:41:38] spirits.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; We walk in this world in this
[1:41:42] three-dimensional world.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; We are influenced from somewhere.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, not one of you are
[1:41:49] walking neutral here.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are walking
[1:41:54] under influence from somewhere.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; You are reflecting something.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Paul says Satan transforms his angels
[1:42:03] into ministers of light.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; But we thank God that Michael has angels
[1:42:08] too.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Anointed messengers who can catch the
[1:42:11] revealed word, who can sound the trumpet
[1:42:14] in Zion, who can wield the sword of the
[1:42:16] spirit, who can lead the bright church
[1:42:19] forward in
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I fought with beasts at
[1:42:25] Ephesus." He wasn't talking about wild
[1:42:28] animals.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; He meant the people who rose up against
[1:42:31] the world.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "We wrestle not against flesh
[1:42:34] and blood, but against principalities
[1:42:36] and powers and rulers of the darkness of
[1:42:38] this world and spiritual wickedness,
[1:42:40] high places." So, who was So, so who was
[1:42:42] Moses really contending with?
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; A king, yes. But more than that, he was
[1:42:51] a ruler
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; of darkness.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; He was a man sitting on a throne
[1:42:56] operating with authority and dominion.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; He was a principality.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; That's not just politics.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; That's spiritual power embedded in
[1:43:05] earthly systems.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing that?
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Can you catch the word?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; That was the Old Testament, but it
[1:43:13] shadows our day.
[1:43:15] Paul takes the same battle and brings it
[1:43:18] into the New Testament. Brings it into
[1:43:21] this generation.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Then we have men that are walking in
[1:43:25] high places. Not necessarily in evil
[1:43:27] form, but driven but driven by another
[1:43:30] spirit.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Look at the modern examples. Men like
[1:43:32] Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, all those
[1:43:34] big names. When the real confrontation
[1:43:37] came, when the challenge came, the word
[1:43:40] challenge came, you find these men
[1:43:42] disappeared, vanished into the
[1:43:43] denominations. Oral Roberts went to
[1:43:46] Australia. They run him out as a fake
[1:43:49] trying to play gimmicks with the word
[1:43:51] touch radio and touch post and
[1:43:53] pretending they had a gift in their hand
[1:43:54] too. Pretenders, imitations
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; and when imitations always fail, the
[1:44:01] real is made manifest.
[1:44:03] Brother Brham went to India and he
[1:44:05] challenged every devil.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham came on to the African
[1:44:10] continent onto African soil and he
[1:44:12] defeated every unclean spirit.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Whilst there were men that were trying
[1:44:17] to rise up and impersonate like Janice
[1:44:19] Jamas, they didn't know where these
[1:44:21] things were coming from.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; They didn't know that this prophet
[1:44:24] William Brandham was moving under the
[1:44:26] pillar of fire. Amen.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; They didn't know that this prophet was
[1:44:29] being led by an angel to hunt out the
[1:44:31] seed of God and to bring sons into
[1:44:34] manifestation.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; My you love me.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going too slow like the donkey.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to hold you here in type
[1:44:49] because the first Exodus is typing this
[1:44:51] age.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Believers are unconscious of the unseen
[1:44:55] world. That's why they live anyhow,
[1:44:58] speak anyhow, say anything.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; But God has a ministry of angels to keep
[1:45:03] us in their way.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; angels took Peter out of prison.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Angels made Paul on the ship.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Angels took Philillip to Samaria.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Is that in the Bible?
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Angelic beings.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Ministers carrying the message of the
[1:45:21] hour.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:24] You need to hear me what I say.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Who Who were they? Hallelujah. Who was
[1:45:29] Philillip?
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Who was Peter? Who was Paul? Who were
[1:45:32] they?
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; They were not Sadducees. They were not
[1:45:34] Pharisees.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; They were message ministers.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; And angels came to shepherd message
[1:45:41] ministers.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; You hear me? What I'm saying?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Angels came to shepherd message
[1:45:48] ministers. God can't break his pattern.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes,
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; watch veil him closely. This man is
[1:45:56] unaware of the unseen world and he was
[1:45:59] making the most disastrous mistake of
[1:46:01] his life. He didn't even realize it. His
[1:46:05] mind was in bondage to the seducer.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; He's going straight into destruction.
[1:46:11] He's been led out of the way into error
[1:46:13] to come against God. M
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; didn't the Bible says in the last days
[1:46:17] that men will give heed to seducing
[1:46:20] spirits
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; and they will turn away from the truth.
[1:46:23] They will give heed to fables and to
[1:46:26] doctrines of devils and then hybridize
[1:46:28] the church.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Didn't Bam didn't Balam end up in a
[1:46:32] false doctrine?
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what is repeating in our day?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was in the first Exodus
[1:46:40] shows up in the second second exodus
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; and is multiplied in the third exodus.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; It's here again.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Go in the Bible and look at the
[1:46:49] procession of that spirit of Balum.
[1:46:51] Peter called it the way of Balum. Jude
[1:46:53] called it the error of Balum. John
[1:46:56] identified it as the doctrine of Balum.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; See, it kept going deeper and deeper and
[1:47:01] deeper.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; You know what Balen Balenism is? It's a
[1:47:05] corrupt form of worship.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; It's men that's puffed up. putting
[1:47:09] confidence in the flesh, making a show,
[1:47:12] marketing their gift. They want a
[1:47:14] following.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; We got many men like this.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about denominations. Look in
[1:47:18] the message.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet God wants men to be a prisoner
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; to his word.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; I tell you, some people are so
[1:47:27] spiritual, they don't even know they
[1:47:29] have been seduced.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Just look at the longsuffering of God.
[1:47:37] He goes this way, God goes there. He
[1:47:39] goes that way, God goes there. He goes
[1:47:41] that way, God goes there.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Verse 27, I think we are here. And when
[1:47:47] the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she
[1:47:49] fell down under Balam. And Bam's anger
[1:47:51] was kindled, and he smoked the ass with
[1:47:53] a staff.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And the Lord opened the mouth of the
[1:47:57] ass, and she said unto Balam,
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; "What have I done to thee
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; that thou has smitten me these three
[1:48:04] times?
[1:48:06] What have I done today?
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; You smitten me these three times. You
[1:48:13] beating me. You beating me.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; And you beating me.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; You can't see the angel.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you something about
[1:48:20] the unseen.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; You can't see the unseen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; There's a man standing there.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Bam. Verse 29. And Bam said unto the
[1:48:33] ass, "Because thou has mocked me, oh my
[1:48:38] who?" Balam said unto the ass,
[1:48:42] "Because thou has mocked me."
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Look, look here. Careful. Look, look,
[1:48:46] look.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; The man is so unconscious.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; He and the donkey having fellowship.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; They are talking.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; They're talking.
[1:48:58] Friends, you think blindness is an easy
[1:49:01] thing.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; What was bringing the blindness?
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Obsession.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Obsession.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Obsession. His mind was captured. It
[1:49:11] shows how he was seduced by Bao.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Bail and his messages had preached him
[1:49:17] to a place where he was blind.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet of God says, "The
[1:49:22] day that you take man as your leader,
[1:49:24] that's the day you die."
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's a quote from leadership. Let
[1:49:28] me tell you something. The bride can't
[1:49:29] be deceived.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; The bride can't be caught up in cunning
[1:49:35] cunningly devised fables,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; man tricks and smart ortors. Hallelujah.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Come back to the word. Hallelujah.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; If you want to enjoy the word before you
[1:49:47] can enjoy the ministry in church, enjoy
[1:49:49] the ministry at home.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Enjoy your fellowship with God.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Enjoy your time in the presence of God
[1:49:54] Almighty.
[1:49:56] Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. If you don't
[1:49:58] listen to a tape at home, if you don't
[1:50:00] pray, if you don't fast, if you don't if
[1:50:02] you don't read your Bible and you come
[1:50:04] to listen in the church, you'll be a
[1:50:05] critic.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; You'll be a critic.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. And the Lord
[1:50:12] opened the mouth of the ass, and she
[1:50:14] said unto Ba, "What have I done to thee
[1:50:15] that thou has smitten me these three
[1:50:17] times?" And Balam said unto the ass,
[1:50:20] because thou has mocked me, and I would,
[1:50:22] catch this, mocked me, I would wear a
[1:50:26] sword in mine, for now would I kill
[1:50:29] thee. Man, this fellow can imagine now
[1:50:32] trying to control this donkey. Yeah. And
[1:50:35] he's now he's boiling with rage. And he
[1:50:38] says, I beat you these three times with
[1:50:40] my staff and you are still so stubborn.
[1:50:43] He says, if I had a sword in my hand,
[1:50:45] you'll be a dead bleeding donkey right
[1:50:47] now.
[1:50:48] He wanted a sword in his hand.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; The angel had a sword in his hand. What
[1:50:52] he wanted to do to the donkey is what
[1:50:54] the angels wanted to do to him.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; How many knows the man's judgment was
[1:50:59] coming right out of his mouth?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; How many knows that Joshua kindled him?
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; In Numbers chapter 31 with a sword.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Verse 30. And the ass said unto Balen,
[1:51:13] "Watch, am not I thine ass upon which
[1:51:18] thou has ridden ever since I was dying
[1:51:21] unto this day."
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; He's like the ass is complaining now.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, you know, have I ever let
[1:51:27] you down? You know, I am not I thine ass
[1:51:31] upon which thou has written ever since I
[1:51:34] was dying until this day." I mean, you
[1:51:37] just hop on, you just hop off.
[1:51:40] I mean, I I've never broken down on the
[1:51:42] road before.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; I'm so reliable. You don't even take a
[1:51:46] maintenance plan for me. You don't even
[1:51:48] take insurance for me.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; And this is how you're treating me.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Treat your transport better than that
[1:51:54] now, would you?
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; God has God has some of your cars
[1:52:01] talking to you
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; and you still can't see him.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, help me here. Yeah.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Let me be a blessing to your children.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Was I ever one to do so? And he said,
[1:52:13] "Nay." Hallelujah. You've never let me
[1:52:16] down.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Then in verse 31, then the Lord opened
[1:52:19] the eyes of Bale.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Just like the Lord opened the eyes of
[1:52:22] Gahazi, Elisha's servant, and he saw
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Another realm,
[1:52:28] chariots of fire, horses of fire, an
[1:52:30] army in the invisible realm.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Verse 31. Then the Lord opened the eyes
[1:52:35] of Balen and Hallelujah and I trust he'd
[1:52:38] open your eyes to this morning.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; And he saw the angel of the Lord
[1:52:42] standing the way and he sword drawn in
[1:52:45] his hand and he bowed down his head and
[1:52:47] he fell flat on his face. Verse 32. And
[1:52:49] the angel of the Lord said unto him,
[1:52:51] wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass
[1:52:53] these three times? My the angel was
[1:52:57] checking every time. Every time he start
[1:52:59] to curse, every time he he he he get
[1:53:02] vexed, every time he get full of rage
[1:53:04] and anger,
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; the angel was marking it down, recording
[1:53:09] every bit of his stubbornness and his
[1:53:10] selfworth
[1:53:12] because the angel knows how many times
[1:53:14] you give him a roadblock. But he
[1:53:16] hardened,
[1:53:18] rebellious.
[1:53:19] The angel is standing in the way not to
[1:53:21] destroy you.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Angel is standing in your way to save
[1:53:25] you.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Behold, I went out to
[1:53:31] withstand thee, because thy way is
[1:53:35] perverse before me."
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; I wonder if some of you could see that
[1:53:41] angel with a sword this morning say,
[1:53:45] "Thy way is perverse before me because I
[1:53:49] find you this morning not walking in my
[1:53:51] word." M
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; I find you this morning in self work,
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; pressured by man, pressured out of my
[1:54:00] way. I find you this morning seduced and
[1:54:02] manipulated and exploited. I find you
[1:54:05] this morning this morning chasing after
[1:54:07] your own lustful desires and ambitions.
[1:54:10] And I find your way perverse before
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; and the ass saw me and turned from me
[1:54:22] these three times. Unless she turned
[1:54:24] from me, surely now also I had slain
[1:54:28] thee and saved her alive.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; God is saying, "I would have killed you
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; and saved the donkey."
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Catch that.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; I would have killed you and saved the
[1:54:46] donkey.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. You see, you might have an accident
[1:54:49] and you may go flying through the
[1:54:51] windshield and lying in some ditch with
[1:54:53] your neck snapped dead
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; and somebody else come, maybe not even a
[1:54:59] saved person will come and push your car
[1:55:01] out of the ditch, knock out the dents
[1:55:03] and send it back on the road.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; God is saying, "I'll save their ass and
[1:55:09] kill you."
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Is that in your Bible?
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Is that in your Bible? Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; I thought I read something wrong here.
[1:55:20] Somebody look, some of you look like you
[1:55:22] seen a ghost.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; I hope it's the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:28] Verse 34. And Bam said unto the angel of
[1:55:31] the Lord, I have sinned, for I knew not
[1:55:34] that thou stoodest in the way against
[1:55:37] me. Look at this fellow now like
[1:55:39] believers pinging ignorance after they
[1:55:41] know the will of God. Oh, God. I didn't
[1:55:44] know that there. Didn't God say the
[1:55:47] angel is to keep you in the way? Obey
[1:55:49] his voice and provoke him not.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; But he allowed himself to be pressured
[1:55:53] and seduced and be taken into separate
[1:55:55] places.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; And now he says, "I have sinned for I
[1:55:58] knew not that thou stoodest in the way
[1:56:01] against me." That's not revelation.
[1:56:04] That's regret because he got caught.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. People repent because they
[1:56:10] get caught.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:15] Yes. Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Look at how many are like Bam today.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; They come to the altar, small tears fall
[1:56:24] down. There's a soft voice. Lord, I'm
[1:56:26] sorry. I didn't mean it. Lord, I was
[1:56:28] confused.
[1:56:31] momentary repentance
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; like Ahab walking softly after the
[1:56:35] prophecy fell
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; like Saul you know after um uh the
[1:56:40] prophet Samuel found him he says I have
[1:56:43] sinned yet he was saying in the next
[1:56:45] verse honor me now before the people
[1:56:50] you see service is going on and people
[1:56:52] get uh uh you know the anointing is
[1:56:55] there and uh people get convicted and
[1:56:58] they get emotionally moved moved
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; and then when they step out of church,
[1:57:03] they step right back into the very
[1:57:04] things that they repented.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Often people repent, but they walk out
[1:57:10] of church with the same appetite,
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; with the same plans, with the same
[1:57:15] secret lust, right back into the thing
[1:57:18] they just said they are leaving behind.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God, let me tell
[1:57:23] you something.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; You might please man here in this realm
[1:57:26] because man is always watching you. man
[1:57:29] is always judging you. But what I'm
[1:57:31] trying to open to you this morning is
[1:57:33] that there is another realm. There is a
[1:57:35] another dimension that there is another
[1:57:38] world right here.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; And the tragedy is that people live
[1:57:43] completely unconscious of the unseen
[1:57:45] world.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; They are so unaware, so insensitive. But
[1:57:50] this morning, this message is designed
[1:57:53] to make you more sensitive to help to
[1:57:56] raise your level of awareness, to make
[1:57:58] you conscious of the unseen world.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; What is the time? Somebody tell me
[1:58:12] when he's saying
[1:58:15] 12:00. Okay. I'm showing you in the
[1:58:17] Bible a man whose way is perverse before
[1:58:20] God.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; God wants to kill him. He's out of the
[1:58:24] will of God.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; He's a man who has had supernatural
[1:58:28] manifestations in his life.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; But God is saying to him, I find your
[1:58:32] way perverse before me.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; You see, he isn't seeing the kind of
[1:58:37] fruit he's bearing.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Because the tree is known by the fruit.
[1:58:42] A good tree cannot bring forth corrupt
[1:58:44] fruit.
[1:58:46] and a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
[1:58:48] good fruit.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Now, let me try and summarize and then
[1:58:52] find a place where we can stop and I'm
[1:58:54] sure your pastor or other brothers can
[1:58:56] pick up these things. There's so much
[1:58:58] there.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Now, everything that you read in the
[1:59:01] Bible, you examine the scriptures from
[1:59:04] Genesis all the way down to Revelation.
[1:59:07] You track every supernatural
[1:59:09] manifestation in the Bible. You look for
[1:59:12] every great act of faith, miracles,
[1:59:15] signs, wonders, deliverances. It's
[1:59:18] always traced back to this one fact that
[1:59:21] it was people who was conscious of the
[1:59:24] unseen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing, hear me? Nothing was done
[1:59:29] outside of that dimension.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Everything came from that dimension.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham had faith to receive a
[1:59:38] promise because an angel called him out
[1:59:40] of Babylon.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; An angel revealed to him the mystery of
[1:59:44] circumcision.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; The angel revealed to him the mystery of
[1:59:48] justification.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; The angel revealed to him the mystery of
[1:59:52] the time and the season when the
[1:59:54] promised son would come.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; It was an angel that revealed the
[1:59:58] destruction that was coming upon Sodom.
[2:00:01] It was an angel that stayed his hand
[2:00:03] when he was about to slay Isaac.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; It was the angel that declared, "Your
[2:00:10] seed shall possess, hallelujah, the
[2:00:12] gates of the enemy."
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Angels, friends, we are speaking about
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Jacob's first experience with God was at
[2:00:20] battle. See, angels ascending and
[2:00:23] descending a ladder.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; God top man at the bottom.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; That's why he could say, "This is the
[2:00:29] gate to heaven. Surely the presence of
[2:00:31] the Lord is in this place.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; God said to Moses, "I send my angel to
[2:00:37] keep the inway."
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; An angel came to Gideon to give him
[2:00:41] assurance when he was hiding at the wine
[2:00:43] press.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; An angel came to Joshua to take people
[2:00:46] into the inheritance. An angel came to
[2:00:48] Daniel in Babylon.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; An angel came to Elijah and give him
[2:00:52] special cakes.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. to take away his frustration and
[2:00:58] to calm him down so that he could go and
[2:01:00] finish his ministry without complaining.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Angels was with Elisha. Angels was with
[2:01:06] David.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Whether it's the Old Testament or
[2:01:08] whether it's the New Testaments. Amen.
[2:01:10] It is angels all
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; angels ministered to Jesus after his
[2:01:15] temptations.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Angels strengthened him. Hallelujah.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Angels with Peter, angel with Philip,
[2:01:21] angels with Paul. And when it comes back
[2:01:24] to the apostolic age,
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; angels come back to a prophet to open
[2:01:31] the Bible.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And began to show him his strange and
[2:01:36] misunderstood life.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; When it came to the opening of the
[2:01:40] seventh seal to call out a bride and to
[2:01:42] set her in order to bring her into an
[2:01:44] invisible union, to bring her into
[2:01:47] rapturing faith. Glory.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Angels came from heaven to
[2:01:52] open up the
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; sea.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Nothing in the entire Bible, the whole
[2:01:56] book of Hebrews chapter 11 is by faith
[2:02:00] angels.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Abraham, Rehea,
[2:02:04] all received angels.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Whether it was Revelation, an angel came
[2:02:08] to Daniel to open up the book. An angel
[2:02:11] came to Paul and open up the book. An
[2:02:14] angel came to Malachi 4 and opened up
[2:02:16] the book.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:19] Whether it was healing, an angel came
[2:02:21] down to the pool of Bethesda.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said that the brass
[2:02:24] serpent never healed nobody.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it was the angel Jehovah
[2:02:30] Rafi the Lord that healed all thy
[2:02:33] diseases. He sended into the pool.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; How many knows this story here? You know
[2:02:41] um brother brother Bossworth he you know
[2:02:44] him and brother Brandon were bosom
[2:02:46] friends and buddies. He had come to
[2:02:48] South Africa and and normally he when
[2:02:51] there was big healing campaigns, brother
[2:02:52] Bosworth would go forth first and he
[2:02:54] would set the platform and set the tone
[2:02:57] and then brother Brandon would come and
[2:02:58] minister and you know have those
[2:03:01] services and brother Boswood had come to
[2:03:03] demon uh come to South Africa and when
[2:03:05] he was in South Africa he got sick.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; He had picked up an amieba
[2:03:11] see and he was dying. So the brothers
[2:03:13] sent a telegram to brother Brham saying
[2:03:16] brother Boswward is dying please pray
[2:03:18] for him.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; See and brother Brandham brother Boswood
[2:03:22] is in South Africa and brother Brandham
[2:03:24] is in America. He was on the hills of I
[2:03:27] think New Albany. He had took his wife
[2:03:29] sister Mina for her drive. See all the
[2:03:32] time the brothers in South Africa are
[2:03:34] saying check if the check check check if
[2:03:36] the telegram has received it.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, it's not like what we
[2:03:40] have today. You know, it's not um you
[2:03:43] know, where we have WhatsApp instant
[2:03:44] messaging and all these different things
[2:03:46] and and you know, uh video calling and
[2:03:49] video conferencing and all of that. No,
[2:03:51] it didn't have anything of that sort.
[2:03:52] Hallelujah.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; See, the brothers are all the time
[2:03:55] checking to see if the telegram had
[2:03:58] reached brother Brandham. Then while
[2:04:00] brother Blan is driving on on the hills
[2:04:02] of New Albany, he breaks into a vision
[2:04:05] and he sees what's happening in South
[2:04:07] Africa that brother Boswood is dying.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; The man says that he was driving for
[2:04:11] more than 10 minutes around around those
[2:04:13] those hills and he says and then he
[2:04:16] stopped the car and he says to sister
[2:04:18] Mira um brother Boswell is dying and
[2:04:20] then he steps out and he leaves and he
[2:04:23] prays for brother Boswell.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; All the time the brothers are checking
[2:04:26] to see if the telegram has reached
[2:04:28] brother.
[2:04:29] You see, and then the brothers all of a
[2:04:32] sudden say, "Don't bother about
[2:04:34] contacting Brother Brandham." Somehow,
[2:04:36] Brother Bosworth is healed.
[2:04:38] Mysteriously,
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; he recovered Philly.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; The next day, Brother Brandham went to
[2:04:45] the Pan-American Airlines to check for
[2:04:47] the telegram. And brother Brandham makes
[2:04:50] this statement here. He says, "The angel
[2:04:53] of the Lord beat the telegram by 24
[2:04:56] hours. Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; I tell you that same angel is writing.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; That same angel knows you got a brown
[2:05:06] shirt, a denim skirt. Hallelujah. That
[2:05:09] same angel is more than able to meet
[2:05:10] your heart's desire.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. This that same angel can change
[2:05:16] your life tonight. Hallelujah.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe it, angels.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. live in the pull pits this
[2:05:24] morning if you have discernment.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Where do we live then, brothers and
[2:05:30] sisters?
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Why is there such an unconsciousness,
[2:05:33] such a lack of awareness?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; The angels. Hallelujah.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Let me give you this last illustration
[2:05:40] and and and then then we'll close. Is
[2:05:42] that okay?
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How how many of you have
[2:05:45] spoken to um someone um maybe overseas
[2:05:49] on the telephone? Mhm.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; It's not a trick question, please.
[2:05:54] So, don't get nervous here. But I want
[2:05:57] to show you something. You you speak to
[2:05:59] people, you know, thousands of miles
[2:06:01] away and you think nothing of it.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; You dial the number with confidence. You
[2:06:06] believe it's a channel of communication
[2:06:08] and once the voice comes through, you
[2:06:10] know exactly who you are talking to.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; But you and that person are in two
[2:06:16] separate locations,
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; two different worlds. Yet you are in
[2:06:20] communion because you have a channel.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; But now man through signs wasn't content
[2:06:29] with just a voice. So what did he do? He
[2:06:33] broke into another barrier.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Opened up another dimension. Now we have
[2:06:38] FaceTime, Zoom,
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; video calls.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Now you don't just hear the voice.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; You see the one that you are speaking.
[2:06:46] Yes.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; You see the image behind the voice.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Are you following?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Like the prophet said, I heard the voice
[2:06:55] in the tree.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; I heard the voice by the river.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; But when I was in the cave,
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; I saw the man.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; He went from hearing the voice to seeing
[2:07:08] the image face to face.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he was just a young boy,
[2:07:13] a reckless sinner, you know, yet God
[2:07:15] gave him access to a whirlwind.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; A voice in nature.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; But after the new birth, God stepped in
[2:07:23] another realm with him and opened up the
[2:07:27] word and unveiled his own presence.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Not a visitation. God stepped into him,
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; used his voice, spoke through his lips,
[2:07:37] moved through his body. Not just a
[2:07:40] communication, but it was an
[2:07:42] incarnation.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Friends, God is raising his church to a
[2:07:48] higher place.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Bringing them to meet him face to face.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; He's bringing them into a oneness, into
[2:07:55] a holy union in this very hour under a
[2:07:59] message ministered by angels.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel of the covenant calling
[2:08:06] the bride into divine fellowship into
[2:08:08] the unseen realm made visible by
[2:08:12] revelation.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Signs opening up a channel.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Opening up realms that was previously
[2:08:19] invisible to man.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; But God in this hour opening up
[2:08:24] mysteries to the church that was
[2:08:26] previously shut up. But an angel opened
[2:08:29] up that angel.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; An angel ministered a new and a living
[2:08:33] way to bring God's people into the
[2:08:36] unfailing realities of his word.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon could say the
[2:08:43] Bible has become the road map to the
[2:08:46] power of God. Hallelujah.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; This morning, Hallelujah. The angel,
[2:08:52] he's saying, I am that angel that can
[2:08:54] change your name.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:59] He changed Jacob's name because Jacob
[2:09:01] needed a new walk.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; And Jacob came into it because he got a
[2:09:06] hold of an angel.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. Jacob say the angel who
[2:09:11] redeemed me. Hallelujah. You say,
[2:09:14] "Brother, I I believe in angels, but I
[2:09:17] don't see them." Hallelujah. People
[2:09:20] don't even think message people were
[2:09:21] supposed to be sensor don't even think
[2:09:23] about angels.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But every time you talk on
[2:09:27] the phone, you don't see the person.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You just know them by voice.
[2:09:31] That's why I gave you that little
[2:09:33] illustration. When the unseen becomes
[2:09:36] visible, when that voice rings in your
[2:09:38] heart, you know, people say, "Oh, my my
[2:09:41] my mind is telling me this thing here."
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you didn't go down that road
[2:09:46] and there was an accident down the road
[2:09:48] and you say, "Oh my." But you don't
[2:09:50] realize that that it was that voice,
[2:09:52] that angel that ministered to you.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Listen, for the past 54 years, God has
[2:10:00] took his earthly angel away.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; But the Lord himself does all three
[2:10:05] things.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord on the earth. He
[2:10:09] hasn't gotten
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Fixing things for us. Hallelujah.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; God is letting us know that he has a
[2:10:18] ministry of angels to keep his children
[2:10:20] in the way.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. a ministry of angels to
[2:10:24] bring messages to reveal things to them.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; The angel came saying, "I will keep you
[2:10:30] in the way. I will bring you." He's
[2:10:32] going to bring us
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; He's going to bring us to the place that
[2:10:36] he has prepared for us.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Just look at the long suffering of this
[2:10:41] angel. My
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Bam goes that way and the angel is
[2:10:45] blocking him,
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; but he can't see. Yes.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like to be a little bit
[2:10:50] more conscious of the unseen?
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like to do that?
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; How many knows angels give you dreams?
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; How many know angels guided Mary and
[2:11:02] Joseph?
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; How many know angels was guiding the
[2:11:05] wise men?
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, they would have made bad
[2:11:08] decisions.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; How many knows that angels are guiding
[2:11:10] you through life's journey?
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Angels appeared to Mary and said, "Go
[2:11:15] tell my disciples, I am risen. I'm not
[2:11:17] dead.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; How many knows that angels foretold
[2:11:21] things to Zachchariah?
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; How many knows that angels stood by Paul
[2:11:26] and said, "You'll be a witness." Amen.
[2:11:28] You must You'll be a witness. You must
[2:11:30] appear before Caesar. You'll be a
[2:11:31] witness for me.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; The ship will be destroyed.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No lives will be lost.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; You're just going to end up on an
[2:11:40] island. The angel wasn't revealing
[2:11:42] everything to him. Hallelujah.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; But the angel is there to guide him.
[2:11:48] Hallelujah. And while Paul is gathering
[2:11:51] sticks, that viper comes and latches
[2:11:53] onto his hands and all the heathens are
[2:11:55] just laughing and waiting for him to
[2:11:56] curl up and die.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; But he just shake that viper into the
[2:12:01] fire. There wasn't any fear.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Because an angel talked to him.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; It did not disturb him. Hallelujah.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; That is when you're walking close to
[2:12:11] God.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One time God had seven
[2:12:15] angels in his hands. Is that right?
[2:12:17] Hallelujah. He sent angel Luther, he
[2:12:20] moved the church up. He sent the angel
[2:12:23] Wesley moved the church up.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Then the Pentecostals came and the
[2:12:28] church rose into another realm.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; But when William Brandon came, a prophet
[2:12:32] angel, hallelujah, more was revealed
[2:12:36] than ever before.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; And the church ascended into heights
[2:12:39] that had never seen before.
[2:12:42] God has opened up something in this day,
[2:12:45] friends, to bring his bride into a more
[2:12:48] intimate, into a more personal contact
[2:12:51] and communication
[2:12:53] with him. Hallelujah.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God opened up things,
[2:12:58] things are mysteries in the Bible.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was never known before.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; But since angels came to him, the Bible
[2:13:06] has become a new book.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:09] Have you ever studied the results of the
[2:13:12] angelic visitations in 1946?
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; It sparked a healing revival the world
[2:13:18] had never seen before.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; But then another angelic visitation in
[2:13:23] 1963.
[2:13:24] This time not for healing.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; This time for the opening of the word
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; to call a bride to set her in order
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; and position her for rapturing faith.
[2:13:35] Amen.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm trying to raise your level
[2:13:38] of awareness of this unseen world where
[2:13:41] the real blessings come from.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; When brother stood there and he spoke
[2:13:46] for nearly two hours testifying of the
[2:13:49] supernatural visitation of angels, how
[2:13:52] they came and commissioned him.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; He was told to consecrate himself for
[2:13:56] the first commission, for the second
[2:13:57] commission. Then the results, follow
[2:14:00] this, I'm closing. Then the results that
[2:14:03] followed the visitation of angels was a
[2:14:07] ministry from body to soul.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Watch this. The same angel performing
[2:14:12] miracles was the same angel revealing
[2:14:15] truth.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; The same angel that was casting out
[2:14:18] sickness was the same angel that was
[2:14:20] pulling us out of organizational spirits
[2:14:23] and bringing us into a world of perfect
[2:14:25] faith.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was set as a prophet
[2:14:29] over this age. He was brought into the
[2:14:32] place ministered by an angel.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; You can find your place stood by that
[2:14:38] same angel.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; You just say, "Lord, open my eyes."
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, open my open eyes.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Let me see angels. Let me see chariots
[2:14:50] of fires."
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, "Lord, if you can change
[2:14:56] seeing, change my seeing so."
[2:14:59] Hallelujah.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Just look at the ministers in the book
[2:15:02] of Acts. Every one of them had angels
[2:15:04] connected.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; If it was in the alpha church like that,
[2:15:08] then it must be in the church again.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; It has to be. Hallelujah.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Angels ministered to Elijah before he
[2:15:15] was translated.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Angels ministered to Gideon and the
[2:15:19] harvest.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "The angel beholds the
[2:15:24] father's face in every living." M
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; people have to be careful how they deal
[2:15:28] with you. You have a guardian angel.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; The beginning and the ending of the
[2:15:33] gentile dispensation
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; is with angels.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Angels in the first exodus. Angels in
[2:15:39] the second exodus. Angels in the third
[2:15:41] exodus. Angels in the first pool. Angels
[2:15:43] in the second pool. Angels in the third
[2:15:45] pool.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Angels bringing healing, bringing
[2:15:48] discernment. And angels opening up the
[2:15:50] mysteries. Yes.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's why said that the angel of the
[2:15:54] swept back wings meant the most to me.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; And he says the bride will be the voice.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Of the archangel.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Angels are ministering spirits sent from
[2:16:11] the presence of God to minister unto
[2:16:14] them who are the heirs of salvation.
[2:16:16] Yes,
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; friends.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; This is the hour to get filled with the
[2:16:21] Holy Spirit.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says when you're filled with
[2:16:24] the Holy Spirit, you become a candidate
[2:16:26] for the unseen, for the supernatural.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Where you can rise up into heavenly
[2:16:32] places.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; In Christ Jesus.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:16:36] [Applause]
[2:16:43] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:50] [Music]
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you were blessed with the
[2:16:57] word of the Lord. Let's give the Lord
[2:16:58] another good praise.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Uh that was wonderful, Pastor.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; It's the best I've heard him preach.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:09] Uh, if you didn't know, that was our
[2:17:12] favorite scripture.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Exodus 23.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; It sets the basis, Amen, for the
[2:17:18] leadership of the angel of the Lord.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, 2023, you've been on
[2:17:22] that line.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "Unless you meet that
[2:17:25] angel of the Lord,
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; you got to know that he's there in every
[2:17:28] exodus."
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure you're glad that you've
[2:17:30] met the angel of the Lord.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Now, if you been sensitive, you know the
[2:17:35] angel of the Lord is speaking through
[2:17:36] Brother Rodney.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. So there's many things
[2:17:39] that were spoken.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; You need to get your life right with the
[2:17:41] Lord.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't miss this opportunity.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; To obey his voice.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Remember what he says. If you'll obey
[2:17:48] his voice,
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; he'll keep you in the way.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; So even as the Holy Spirit ministers to
[2:17:54] your we'll sing one song. Amen. Even as
[2:17:57] we prepare to close the service. Amen.
[2:18:01] But allow the Holy Spirit. Don't have a
[2:18:03] hard out.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; If you need to fix things, fix it. If
[2:18:07] you've been chasing after your own
[2:18:08] dreams, your own ambitions like Balum,
[2:18:10] say, "Lord, let me align with your will.
[2:18:13] Let's say new things are being
[2:18:14] declared." How many of you believe the
[2:18:16] angel of the Lord not seen for 2,000
[2:18:18] years? He's right here.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Until this day, no man could tell us
[2:18:26] just where
[2:18:29] [Music]
[2:18:30] we came from and where we go from here.
[2:18:35] Oh.
[2:18:37] Through the eyes, the prophet God
[2:18:40] revealed to us
[2:18:44] before God was gone. All the way to
[2:18:48] future home.
[2:18:52] New things are being declared.
[2:18:56] I know very soon I'll be raptured out of
[2:18:59] him. Angel bodies here
[2:19:03] leading our souls in truth. The
[2:19:07] invisible, the impartable, the
[2:19:10] inconceivable,
[2:19:12] faith to believe for the impossible.
[2:19:16] Oh, this new day.
[2:19:20] [Music]
[2:19:22] The angel of God not seen for 2,000
[2:19:26] years is right here.
[2:19:30] He's here fixing things for us to leave.
[2:19:34] Oh,
[2:19:37] he's waiting. Amen. And with you visions
[2:19:40] before you this morning
[2:19:43] so we can walk step by step into what we
[2:19:47] behold.
[2:19:50] Oh things are being declared
[2:19:54] and very soon I'll be raptured out of
[2:19:58] you. The angel of God is here
[2:20:02] leading our souls into
[2:20:05] the invisible,
[2:20:07] the immortable, the inconceivable.
[2:20:10] Faith to believe for the impossible.
[2:20:14] Oh, in this new day,
[2:20:18] eyes have not seen.
[2:20:20] Eyes have not seen, nor ears heard the
[2:20:24] things that God has
[2:20:28] prepared for those whom he loved.
[2:20:33] But in this day,
[2:20:35] but in this day, God displayed.
[2:20:39] If you say nothing shall be impossible
[2:20:44] unto you.
[2:20:46] New things,
[2:20:48] new things.
[2:20:52] I know very soon I'll be raptured out
[2:20:55] again. The angel of God is here,
[2:20:59] leading our souls into
[2:21:03] visible
[2:21:05] varable inconceivable.
[2:21:08] Faint to believe for the impossible.
[2:21:12] Oh this

[2:21:17] [Music]
[2:21:23] my praise. Oh sh you hold not back this
[2:21:29] people I want for myself. Oh no you give

[2:21:38] praise.
[2:21:39] Oh sh
[2:21:41] you not back this I for
[2:21:45] myself.
[2:21:49] I know very soon I'll be raptured out of
[2:21:52] you. The angel of God is here
[2:21:56] leading our souls into
[2:21:59] the invisible
[2:22:02] above the inconceivable.
[2:22:05] Faith to believe for the impossible.
[2:22:09] Oh, in this new day.
[2:22:13] In this new day.
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:20] In this new day,
[2:22:25] [Music]
[2:22:27] in this new day.
[2:22:31] Oh, let's just talk to you, Lord. Amen.
[2:22:33] Let's just worship him. Amen. Oh, we
[2:22:35] thank you, Lord, for angelic visitation,
[2:22:37] Lord. We thank you, Lord, for
