[0:00] spirit in the mighty name of Jesus and
[0:02] Lord I pray Lord your holy spirit will
[0:04] have Liberty this morning oh God I pray
[0:07] Lord that your sons and daughters can
[0:08] rejoice in your most holy presence we
[0:10] ask your blessing now in the name of our
[0:12] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for much
[0:14] Thanksgiving
[0:16] amen amen I greet you all in the
[0:18] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[0:21] Jesus Christ amen he's worthy to be
[0:23] praised Hallelujah I can feel the warmth
[0:26] of your love in this place the place is
[0:29] nice and warm amen reach your brother
[0:31] and your sister amen warm them up give
[0:34] them a good God bless you amen welcome
[0:36] to the lion family amen praise the
[0:40] Lord Amen brother Rish is up in
[0:43] Johannesburg visiting with his daughter
[0:46] there and that's the only one I know
[0:49] nobody else told me they're not going to
[0:50] be here so if they're not sure they a
[0:54] wall absent without
[0:57] leave amen praise the Lord let's turn to
[1:00] our Bibles this morning I greet you once
[1:02] again in Jesus name uh to Romans chapter
[1:06] 8 praise the
[1:14] Lord Romans chapter
[1:23] 8 from Verse
[1:25] 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of
[1:29] this present time time are not worthy to
[1:32] be compared with the glory which shall
[1:36] be revealed in
[1:38] US amen the glory is going to be
[1:41] revealed in
[1:43] us for the earnest expectation of the
[1:46] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:50] of the sons of God now that's what we're
[1:52] looking at what does it entail the
[1:55] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:57] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:59] sons of God for the creature was made
[2:02] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[2:05] reason of him who had subjected the same
[2:07] in Hope but because the creature itself
[2:10] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[2:12] of corruption into the Glorious Liberty
[2:14] of the children of God for we know that
[2:17] the whole creation groan and travaileth
[2:20] in pain together until now and not only
[2:23] they so we quote that first part there
[2:27] but the Bible goes on to say it's not
[2:28] only nature that's grown
[2:30] he says we ourselves
[2:34] grown we ourselves also which have the
[2:37] first fruits of the spirit even we
[2:40] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[2:43] for the adoption to the Redemption of
[2:47] our body amen let's turn to Ephesians
[2:49] chapter 1 and verse
[2:51] 5
[2:54] hallelujah amen you love the word amen
[2:57] you love to turn to the scriptures and
[2:58] read the word because because the word
[3:00] is packed with
[3:01] promises amen so when God predestinated
[3:05] us the Bible says he predestinated us
[3:07] from before the foundation of the world
[3:10] but what did he predestinated us to
[3:12] right let's read from verse four
[3:14] according has he had chosen Us in him
[3:18] before the foundation of the world that
[3:20] we should be holy and Without Blame
[3:22] before him in Love Now what did he
[3:25] predestinate us for let's see in verse
[3:27] five having predestinated us unto the
[3:30] adoption of children didn't we read
[3:33] that's what we're groaning for now so he
[3:36] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[3:38] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[3:40] according to the good pleasure of his
[3:42] will amen the Lord had blessings to the
[3:44] reading of his word you may be seated it
[3:46] I'm going to read Revelation 8 and verse
[3:48] one there amen praise the
[3:55] Lord and when he had opened the seventh
[3:58] seal they were silent in heaven about
[4:01] the space of half an hour amen and we
[4:06] know that the prophet of God is teaching
[4:08] us he said the setting of that seventh
[4:11] seal is found in Revelation chapter 10
[4:14] amen amen that's a direct quote there
[4:17] the setting of that seventh seal is
[4:19] found in Revelation chapter 10 and we
[4:22] all know what happens in Revelation 10
[4:24] the mighty Angel descends with the title
[4:26] deed to man's
[4:27] inheritance Hallelujah yeah amen so what
[4:32] we need in this hour and I'm going to
[4:34] say I've been saying it for a while and
[4:36] the prophet has been saying it what we
[4:38] need is the baptism of the Holy
[4:41] Ghost amen we can't progress any further
[4:45] if we do not have the baptism of the
[4:47] Holy Ghost and we can't second guess
[4:50] it amen we've got to have a new birth
[4:54] experience amen and you find you what
[4:56] the prophet of God is saying he says
[4:58] when you receive the holy spirit so I
[5:01] didn't give you the notes yet amen going
[5:04] to catch say I'm a good
[5:08] catch praise the Lord he says when we
[5:11] receive the Holy Spirit everything that
[5:14] you have need of for this Earth's
[5:16] journey is in you
[5:19] then so the holy spirit is coming to
[5:22] equip
[5:23] us amen the holy spirit is coming to
[5:27] equip Sons and Daughters of the most
[5:28] high God
[5:30] so we've got to make sure that we are
[5:32] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[5:34] Ghost it was what was sent to lead the
[5:37] church it's what sent to lead and guide
[5:40] every believer in their life so without
[5:42] the Holy Ghost amen we will be the
[5:44] prophet says we are no better than an
[5:47] animal but the Holy Ghost makes us Sons
[5:49] and Daughters of God hallelujah so he
[5:52] says here when you receive the Holy
[5:54] Spirit everything that you have need of
[5:56] for Earth's journey is in you then
[6:00] he says then turn it loose and let it go
[6:02] to work let your faith loose and believe
[6:05] God that's in the message expectations
[6:08] so some sometimes there can be a hidden
[6:10] power like if power is running through
[6:12] your house but if you never turn the
[6:14] light switch on you'll never get the
[6:16] lights to work if you if you've got
[6:18] appliances connected to the electrical
[6:20] socket there if you never turn those
[6:22] appliances on you will never enjoy the
[6:25] benefits of those appliances amen so if
[6:28] we have the Holy Ghost we've got to turn
[6:30] it
[6:32] loose
[6:35] hallelujah amen so the Propet of God
[6:38] here I'm going to read a lot of quotes
[6:40] because I'm trying to establish this
[6:42] what he is saying what will the
[6:44] manifestations of the sons of God what
[6:46] will it take for sons of God to be made
[6:48] manifest the word manifest means to be
[6:51] made known what will it take for Romans
[6:54] 8:19 to be
[6:56] fulfilled and we'll see as the prophet
[6:58] of God is saying he couldn't have
[7:00] happened in any other
[7:02] time now some of you may say but but
[7:05] didn't it start at Pentecost the Propet
[7:07] is saying it couldn't have happened back
[7:09] there because we were building
[7:13] up so Romans 8:19 is for a specific
[7:16] class of people to manifest amen he says
[7:19] and the sons of God got to be revealed
[7:23] again in the bride in the last day and
[7:26] the quickening power as got
[7:30] to come Quicken them out of dead
[7:32] denominations and Creeds to a Living
[7:34] Word of the Living God Amen has that
[7:38] already happened can we identify that
[7:40] the word has already quickened us from
[7:42] dead
[7:43] denominations praise the Lord amen so he
[7:47] says God since the beginning of the
[7:48] world predestinated us unto adoption of
[7:51] sons we just read that in Ephesians 15
[7:54] he says now the whole creation groaning
[7:57] waiting for the manifestation of the son
[7:59] of God Amen and what is that manifest
[8:03] what is that now he's saying to see the
[8:05] mystery of his coming the mystery of his
[8:07] will the mystery of us sitting together
[8:10] it's a mystery that's been hid since the
[8:13] foundation of the world waiting for the
[8:15] manifestation of the sons of
[8:17] God now here what the prophet is saying
[8:20] here because I just told you it couldn't
[8:21] have happened in any other age but here
[8:23] from the prophet he says tell me brother
[8:26] tell me sister when was the time that
[8:29] sons of God was ever to be manifest
[8:32] outside of this time now
[8:34] am he says when was there ever a time in
[8:38] history there was to manifest the time
[8:41] to deliver all
[8:45] nature nature itself is groaning waiting
[8:48] for the time of the
[8:49] manifestation why before the atonement
[8:51] was made before the holy ghost ever was
[8:54] poured out before the all the Old
[8:56] Testament on down there they couldn't
[8:58] have been
[9:00] manifestations now he says it had to
[9:03] wait till this
[9:04] time I want you to know he's not saying
[9:07] it it started there with the early
[9:11] church he's saying it had to wait till
[9:14] this time why brother brandom now all
[9:16] things has been brought coming shaping
[9:19] up to The
[9:20] Headstone so the manifestation can only
[9:23] come when the bride is in a full statue
[9:25] of a perfect
[9:26] man because the headstone is is the is
[9:29] Capstone of love coming upon the body
[9:32] amen hallelujah we know that Enoch left
[9:36] a literal sign in Egypt Enoch built the
[9:39] Pyramid and he left a sign of his
[9:42] Perfection amen and he was translated
[9:45] but right now God is building a pyramid
[9:47] City God is building a pyramid
[9:49] individual God is building each
[9:51] individual into a stature of a perfect
[9:54] man and we are going to leave a
[9:56] testimony on the Earth
[9:59] praise the Lord amen amen when we coming
[10:03] up now we're coming up to love amen the
[10:06] a higher dimension of the Holy
[10:11] Ghost now remember we're not leaving our
[10:14] thought the holy spirit is taking us
[10:16] through a journey and he showed us how
[10:19] amen Philadelphia means brotherly love
[10:22] but we know that Brotherly Love was
[10:23] found in that seventh
[10:25] age amen but we've got to reach a higher
[10:28] dimension because the pro the Bible is
[10:31] telling us that we need to add to Faith
[10:33] virtue virtue knowledge knowledge
[10:35] Temperance Temperance patience patience
[10:38] godliness godliness brotherly kindness
[10:40] and to God to brotherly kindness
[10:44] charity that's not your ordinary charity
[10:47] that's a gap love that's the love of God
[10:50] coming to cap the believer coming to cap
[10:52] the church so you no longer just operate
[10:54] amen by these other virtues here but
[10:57] you're operating as a kept in individual
[10:59] with the love of God in your
[11:03] heart amen praise the Lord amen amen so
[11:10] I'm saying love is a higher
[11:12] Dimension love is the highest Dimension
[11:15] the prophet of God when he went to the
[11:16] other side he said there was such a
[11:18] feeling in that
[11:21] place and the believer said this is what
[11:23] you preached
[11:25] about amen he says this is what you
[11:27] preached about he says the Holy Ghost
[11:29] being
[11:31] love
[11:33] hallelujah
[11:35] amen now we are not just talking kind of
[11:37] love here this love is a Divine love
[11:40] this love passes all human understanding
[11:43] amen we can't limit God to our own
[11:46] intellect and our own thinking sometimes
[11:48] we try and understand God but we limit
[11:50] God to what we can understand about him
[11:52] amen but amen we need to take the limits
[11:54] off of God God can't be limited to our
[11:57] own thoughts and our own ideas
[11:59] hallelujah
[12:01] amen we can't just expect our human mind
[12:04] with the capacity of thinking that we
[12:06] have to understand God God is
[12:08] magnificent God is mighty God covers the
[12:11] expanse of the universe
[12:14] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen praise
[12:17] the Lord so God in his wisdom revealed
[12:20] to us through his word the things that
[12:22] are necessary for us to understand in
[12:24] this time amen so he says it had to wait
[12:27] till now amen why shaping up to a
[12:30] headstone to the manifestation of the
[12:32] sons of God coming back am Hallelujah
[12:36] now that puts an obligation and a
[12:38] responsibility on every one of us amen
[12:42] hallelujah because seven Messengers and
[12:44] the group are beyond the curtain of time
[12:47] but here we are on the earth we've got
[12:49] to fulfill all scripture amen we can't
[12:52] be laying around idle thinking that all
[12:54] things are continuing the same in the
[12:56] message of the hour all things are not
[12:58] the same amen Sons and Daughters of God
[13:00] are coming up Sons and Daughters of God
[13:02] are building those virtues amen until
[13:04] the Capstone of Love Comes upon us
[13:07] hallelujah hallelujah we will not stop
[13:10] till The Headstone comes amen hallelujah
[13:13] we are building our way up amen how are
[13:15] we building not our own efforts but the
[13:17] Holy Ghost in US amen it's Holy Ghost
[13:20] Faith Holy Ghost virtue amen virtue
[13:23] power coming into the
[13:26] church praise the Lord what is is he
[13:29] saying manifestations of the sons coming
[13:31] back and the spirit of God what is the
[13:33] spirit of God the holy ghost coming into
[13:36] these men Hallelujah the holy ghost
[13:39] coming at this time not for a birth
[13:41] we've already been born again but now
[13:43] coming for the adoption ceremony
[13:45] hallelujah amen we showed you in Jesus
[13:47] own life how the Holy Spirit came there
[13:49] at the Jordan River that was his baptism
[13:52] his birth amen but then the Holy Ghost
[13:54] came again in Matthew 17 amen took him
[13:56] up on a mountain for his adoption cere
[13:59] Hallelujah so the Holy Ghost has two has
[14:02] an attribute Amen to bir sons and to
[14:05] bring them to their adoption
[14:08] yes because the Holy Ghost is the guide
[14:11] the Holy Ghost is the teacher yes amen
[14:13] you say show me the
[14:15] scripture read the scripture
[14:17] slowly because you are Sons God had sent
[14:22] the spirit his Spirit the spirit of his
[14:24] son two
[14:25] sons so the spirit of his son is the
[14:28] Holy Ghost
[14:29] yes the Holy Ghost is a tutor now
[14:32] because you were son God sent the tutor
[14:34] two
[14:36] sons the Holy Ghost is the tutor but
[14:39] people don't want the Holy
[14:41] Ghost why because the Holy Ghost
[14:43] restricts me I want to I want to indulge
[14:46] in things of the world I want to do this
[14:48] I want to do that the Holy Ghost only
[14:50] drives me to the word let me live a
[14:53] little bit we'll find people will do
[14:55] more to satisfy the flesh that's right
[14:59] they can climb high mountains they can
[15:01] swim deep seas to satisfy the flesh but
[15:05] when it comes to the things of God it
[15:07] becomes Grievious to them people want to
[15:09] do the bare minimum to serve God when we
[15:12] ought to be doing our maximum to serve
[15:14] the Lord amen hallelujah
[15:17] hallelujah I wish I was preaching to
[15:19] some people here amen people want to do
[15:22] the bare minimum when it comes to
[15:23] serving the
[15:25] lord and wanting God to do everything
[15:27] for them
[15:29] amen God is equipped you with the Holy
[15:31] Ghost and people don't want the Holy
[15:33] Ghost because they want to live a life
[15:35] stuck in lusia L in conditions they
[15:39] probably sitting on the border of the
[15:41] message of the hour thinking I live in
[15:44] the world but as soon as I see signs and
[15:46] and I see things I'll step over onto
[15:48] this side amen God is now securing those
[15:51] borders there'll be no illegal
[15:53] immigrants coming across this border at
[15:55] this time God is securing the borders
[15:58] amen this is not the USA where the whole
[16:00] south southern border amen there's been
[16:02] an influx of immigrants amen the border
[16:04] is unmaned millions and millions of
[16:07] people have come into the USA illegally
[16:10] no one shall come into the Bride of the
[16:11] Lord Jesus Christ illegally by one
[16:14] Spirit the Bible says we are baptized
[16:16] into the body of Jesus
[16:19] Christ in fact even people love loving
[16:21] Jesus even Jesus said when we had this
[16:24] great wedding Feast somebody was sitting
[16:26] there without the wedding garment and he
[16:28] didn't say oh oh they have such a great
[16:29] desire to come in you're are illegal
[16:31] immigrant he said they were cast they
[16:33] were bound hand and foot and they were
[16:35] taken out because they didn't have the
[16:36] wedding garment church it's time we get
[16:38] the wedding
[16:41] garment God is not a respect of person
[16:44] if you don't come by his requirements
[16:46] this man was sitting there without the
[16:47] wearing garment he was bound hand and
[16:50] foot and he was cast
[16:51] out God has a requirement and the
[16:54] requirement is his word his requirement
[16:56] is the Holy Ghost and we must come that
[16:58] way
[17:02] hallelujah praise the Lord yeah now the
[17:05] prophet is going to Define even further
[17:07] what it's going to take for Sons to come
[17:08] to manifestation and you're going to see
[17:10] now why the opening of the word was so
[17:12] important amen my title I don't if I
[17:15] gave it the seals were open so Sons
[17:17] could come to
[17:19] manifestation amen the seals were open
[17:22] for Sons to come to
[17:24] manifestation
[17:26] Hallelujah now he says God hid it from
[17:28] the the eyes of the wise and prudent and
[17:31] promis to reveal it to sons of God in
[17:33] the last days when the sons of God will
[17:35] be made
[17:36] manifest God's sons that rejoiced even
[17:39] before the foundation of the world now
[17:42] watch when that great revelation of the
[17:45] godhead and things would be brought down
[17:48] in the last days it would made
[17:51] manifest these things through the sons
[17:54] of God Amen now you're seeing the key
[17:59] thank you Lord amen he's going to reveal
[18:01] the godhead he's going to reveal the
[18:04] Mysteries and he's bringing it to the
[18:06] end time people and through this he
[18:09] would manifest these things through the
[18:11] sons of
[18:13] God
[18:14] hallelujah you know the scriptures
[18:16] teaches that and he says and here we
[18:21] are he goes on further that's the reason
[18:24] God is opening these things to US ah but
[18:27] I don't like the seals
[18:29] seven Church ages I must read that I
[18:33] must read the seals I must read the
[18:36] books well if you want to be a
[18:38] manifested
[18:39] son this is the syllabus given to
[18:44] us because Faith cometh by the hearing
[18:46] of the word this is the message sent now
[18:49] watch that's the reason God is opening
[18:52] these things to us God is bringing his
[18:54] sons into manifestation
[18:58] watch he is going beyond the
[19:01] limitations of any human knowledge
[19:05] Hallelujah come on now this message of
[19:08] the hour that we have is gone beyond the
[19:10] limitation of human knowledge that is
[19:12] why denominations and theologians can't
[19:15] accept the message it goes beyond human
[19:19] knowledge the message came from
[19:22] Heaven it came from the back part of
[19:24] God's mind amen therefore only sons of
[19:27] God can rejoice with these truths when
[19:30] you tell them there's not three Gods
[19:32] amen there is one God manifested in
[19:34] Father Son and Holy Spirit they don't
[19:37] want to believe
[19:39] that but we know our father we know how
[19:43] he has manifested himself we know how
[19:45] he's condescended from Spirit to word to
[19:49] flesh praise the
[19:52] Lord the message amen he's going beyond
[19:55] the limitations of any human knowledge
[19:58] when into spiritual Revelations and
[20:01] bring it down haven't we been teaching
[20:04] in the Bible here is to him that has
[20:08] wisdom amen not what you learned in the
[20:10] Seminary Now watch how he brings
[20:12] consecration in now but what he learned
[20:16] on his knees before God
[20:18] hallelujah and what pleased God to give
[20:20] him sons of God made
[20:24] manifest there again people find it hard
[20:27] to spend time in his
[20:29] presence people who claim to be
[20:31] manifested Sons and Daughters of God
[20:34] find it hard to pray find it hard to
[20:37] read the Bible find it hard to be called
[20:40] a Christian in fact some people don't
[20:43] even know you're a Christian you feel
[20:45] like you're an undercover agent secret
[20:48] Ops amen nobody knows you're a
[20:52] Christian sometimes you even make a
[20:54] comment oh I didn't know you were a
[20:56] Christian wow
[21:01] hey because the tongues that you speak
[21:05] they would never have guessed that you
[21:06] were a
[21:07] Christian swear whats fly out of your
[21:10] mouth like butter on a
[21:12] knife on a hot knife not Rama now Rama
[21:16] is hard but of that
[21:20] thing when swear words come naturally
[21:23] that's a sign that there hasn't been a
[21:24] change on the
[21:25] inside the nature on the inside still
[21:28] needs to be changed swear words are
[21:31] coming you don't keep the word of God
[21:34] you don't keep the ordinances of God
[21:37] something is wrong with the
[21:39] nature you know if you see a plant

[23:09] power of the Holy Ghost amen

[23:17] things from the foundation of the world
[23:20] to bring it
[23:22] up

[23:27] this Earth and this atmospheres won't be
[23:29] able to contain Sons and Daughters of
[23:31] God who are being positioned
[23:34] positionally placed right now amen the
[23:37] Earth couldn't contain
[23:41] Enoch this Fallen World couldn't contain
[23:44] a man that was in a perfect stature of
[23:47] Christ the world couldn't contain this
[23:50] man that was so full of
[23:52] faith that the Earth had to give
[23:55] way and it could change dimensions
[24:01] hallelujah
[24:02] amen now when I'm talking about Noah I'm

[24:13] going to change
[24:14] Dimensions people may have heard about a
[24:16] Rapture people may have heard and they
[24:18] think it's a story people may be tired
[24:21] of hearing about it people may accuse
[24:24] you of trying to escape the present

[24:37] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[24:39] of an eye and we find as time is going

[24:45] can't even imagine a change of the body
[24:47] they can't imagine a change of leaving
[24:49] this Dimension and going into another
[24:51] dimension because they are so satisfied
[24:54] with this world so
[24:56] Earthbound you know about Johnny
[24:59] Crow Johnny
[25:01] Crow was that bird that was tied to a
[25:06] post and every time he tried to fly that
[25:08] stringle hold him back until he got
[25:11] accustomed to it and he knew his
[25:13] limitation how far he could
[25:15] go and one day when somebody came and
[25:18] cut the rope Johnny Crow would not go
[25:20] free because he had been conditioned to
[25:23] go so
[25:24] far he had been conditioned to go so far
[25:28] amen amen but the Holy Ghost is coming
[25:30] now amen to recondition you if maybe you
[25:34] thought your limitation was so far God
[25:37] is saying I can do exceedingly
[25:39] abundantly above all that you could have
[25:41] ask or think with your
[25:43] life praise the
[25:50] Lord now the Bible that we
[25:53] have we know the prophet of God says
[25:56] when those seals were open the Bible
[25:58] became a new
[26:00] book
[26:01] hallelujah how many if you can say Amen
[26:03] to that he says the Bible became a new
[26:07] book and I if you know that the prophet
[26:10] of God many times you would say that
[26:12] it's something that's not written in the
[26:14] book but it's something on the back side
[26:16] of the book but then when the Holy
[26:18] Spirit reveals to him he says it
[26:19] couldn't have been something that's not
[26:21] in the book because he won't walk that
[26:23] way he says it's something that's been
[26:25] hid in the book yes
[26:28] amen hallelujah I'm not getting many
[26:30] amens I don't know if you're not reading
[26:32] the message or you're just feeling so
[26:34] cold amen hallelujah ask your neighbor
[26:37] you feeling
[26:39] cold
[26:40] amen praise the Lord tell them don't
[26:44] worry if you say Amen it'll warm
[26:46] up hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen
[26:50] you know sometimes you got to rev your
[26:52] engine with the old cars now you have to
[26:54] rev your engine for a while until the
[26:56] engine warms up
[26:59] amen praise the Lord amen now it doesn't
[27:03] mean that if you sit your cold and
[27:05] statue then I'm going to think it's not
[27:08] you because the spirit discerns even
[27:10] past your
[27:12] emotions the spirit can go into the
[27:14] hidden places and bring out things amen
[27:17] that you yourself don't know about your
[27:19] life amen hallelujah amen now we're
[27:23] talking about this this book of
[27:25] redemption that was sealed with Seven
[27:27] Seals that theologians can read this
[27:30] book and their eyes are blinded to it
[27:32] even
[27:34] now
[27:36] amen he says that this kinsman redeemer
[27:39] he's talking about Revelation 5 how the
[27:41] kinsman redeemer was given the book he
[27:43] went and he took the book right he says
[27:46] we lost it in the Garden of Eden through
[27:48] Adam it went back to the original owner
[27:52] now the original owner was God himself
[27:54] amen now the title deed of man's
[27:56] inheritance means that we had to
[27:58] dominion over the
[28:00] Earth we had eternal life and we had
[28:03] fellowship with God but we lost that
[28:06] when Adam fell right he says there's
[28:08] been a poacher on the land a squatter
[28:11] and that's Satan he come over he's a
[28:14] poacher the Earth don't belong to him
[28:17] belongs to
[28:19] God is the title deed of redemption this
[28:22] seven seal book it's the title deed of
[28:25] our Redemption you wait till we get into
[28:27] those SE seals now what did we just
[28:30] establish in the first opening here that
[28:34] the seals were for specific time for the
[28:37] manifestations of sons of God so this
[28:40] Revelation is going to bring back
[28:42] something to the
[28:44] church it's going to put us back in our
[28:46] all to be
[28:49] condition
[28:51] Hallelujah paragraph 160 there says he
[28:54] breaks the seals reveals gives us his
[28:57] inheritance to his people he gives the
[29:00] inheritance that he inherited becoming
[29:03] kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out
[29:06] to us aren't you glad that our Lord has
[29:08] freely given it to us it all belonged to
[29:12] him he was the one who redeemed it but
[29:15] instead of keeping it himself he gives
[29:18] it back to the people that's his love
[29:20] for us or can we say Amen to them than
[29:24] Lord hallelujah
[29:28] he says now then as the sons of God he
[29:31] inherits all things as son of David is
[29:34] heir to the throne as son of Abraham is
[29:37] heir to the Royal Grant thank you Lord
[29:41] now you know why we are children of
[29:42] Abraham amen how many if you know what
[29:44] the Royal Grant
[29:45] is that's where they keep
[29:47] [Music]
[29:49] the some of you don't know what you
[29:51] think I'm rubbing
[29:52] fingers that's where they keep their
[29:55] wealth Hallelujah
[29:58] the Royal
[30:00] Grant he's air to the Royal
[30:05] Grant and a son of man is air to the
[30:09] [Music]
[30:10] earth a Son of God is air to all things
[30:13] in Heaven and
[30:16] Earth praise the
[30:19] Lord that's Our Redeemer our kinsman
[30:22] redeemer now I don't know about you but
[30:24] somebody's married to this person we
[30:26] just described

[30:32] come into Union with
[30:35] him and we haven't signed any
[30:38] prup
[30:40] agreement everything that's his is given
[30:43] to us the type is in Esther Esther even
[30:46] to ask the kingdom is
[30:48] yours but can we live in our inheritance
[30:51] or are we living beneath our
[30:53] privileges as our faith gotten weak that
[30:56] we can't take God at his word
[31:00] word thank you
[31:03] Hallelujah now remember he's talking
[31:05] about the Old Testament now a man that
[31:07] lost his in inheritance and his quarter
[31:09] comes and he lives on his land but he
[31:12] could only hold it for 50
[31:14] years at the time of Jubilee the Year of

[46:02] paragraph 89 he says these signs shall
[46:06] follow the follow Believers not negative
[46:10] thinkers ah my business doing so bad
[46:14] sure I don't know what I'm going to do
[46:15] your business will do bad then and you
[46:17] won't know what to do
[46:19] right but if you can say the I don't
[46:21] know what is going on with the economy
[46:23] but my faith is not based on the economy
[46:26] shra is my provider I call out to Aba
[46:28] father and he is my
[46:32] source and he shall provide according to
[46:34] his riches in
[46:37] glory praise the
[46:39] Lord amen yeah the prophet now he's
[46:42] saying it maybe you didn't like what I
[46:43] was saying the science of follow
[46:45] Believers not negative thinkers not
[46:48] intellectual church members but born
[46:50] again believers who has come from the
[46:52] intellectual to the heart where God
[46:53] takes throne in his control room to
[46:56] control your emotions control your faith
[46:59] control your character
[47:01] Hallelujah God wants to fill you why
[47:04] does he want to fill you what does he
[47:05] want to fill you with he wants to fill
[47:07] you with himself the holy spirit filled
[47:10] with the Holy
[47:12] Ghost and he quotes Luke 29
[47:14] 2449 you shall receive power after the
[47:17] Holy Ghost is come upon you then you'll
[47:20] be witness of me in Jerusalem Judea and
[47:22] Samaria unto the utmost parts of the
[47:25] earth so what we to do is we've got to
[47:28] speak Faith filled
[47:31] words let our words be packed with faith
[47:35] yes let us be like God the Bible says
[47:38] that Abraham started to act like God and
[47:42] he called those things which are not as
[47:44] though they
[47:47] are what did he say when God told him go
[47:51] sacrifice your son he confessed with his
[47:53] mouth to his servants I am the lad shall
[47:58] return he spoke the word and he returned
[48:01] with his son back praise the Lord now I
[48:05] if you know that we ought to add to our
[48:07] faith faith alone is not what's required
[48:10] in this hour the Bible says add to your
[48:13] faith virtue
[48:15] amen and add knowledge and add
[48:18] Temperance and add patience now if you
[48:21] go and read there how if you read add
[48:25] negativity add
[48:27] fear add just add over there whatever is
[48:30] happening in your life just add it over
[48:32] there
[48:35] no amen so what must we do we must re
[48:38] from the spirit
[48:40] man we must reain amen from the inside
[48:43] out we can't allow the flesh man to to
[48:46] live by sight the Bible says we don't
[48:48] walk by by sight we walk by faith so we
[48:52] have to govern the Earth and control the
[48:54] Earth from our Heavenly influence from
[48:57] high
[48:58] places
[49:05] hallelujah amen we're getting ready to
[49:08] close now praise the
[49:15] Lord let's get to paragraph 75 there
[49:21] amen now we want to know that we were
[49:23] predestinated to an inheritance he says
[49:26] I am have an inheritance an inheritance
[49:28] of eternal life God sent Jesus to make
[49:31] that inheritance real to me because
[49:33] there was nothing I could do to inherit
[49:35] it it was blank there's nothing I could
[49:37] do but in the fullness of time God sent
[49:40] Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation
[49:43] of the world his blood was shed that I
[49:45] might go to my
[49:46] inheritance I'm bringing that because
[49:49] that's a foundational truth about the
[49:50] cross of Jesus and the blood of
[49:54] Jesus what inheritance the
[49:57] sunship to be a Son of God now the
[50:02] prophet like to choke
[50:04] people and these teachings choke people
[50:07] and he says now this just this may just
[50:11] choke you to
[50:12] death and all of the prophet's teachings
[50:15] choke the den
[50:17] denominations they they choke when they
[50:19] hear it they can't handle
[50:23] it but did you know that men as that are
[50:26] of God are amateure gods and everybody
[50:30] said how many know that Jesus said so
[50:33] amen did not your lord say itself that
[50:35] you are gods and if you call them Gods
[50:37] which God said in Genesis 2 that they
[50:39] were Gods because they had full domain
[50:43] over the Dominion of the world he gave
[50:45] him dominion over all things and he lost
[50:47] his godship he lost his sunship he lost
[50:50] his domain and Satan took it
[50:53] over right but that's not all he says
[50:55] but brother we are waiting for the
[50:58] manifestations of the sons of God who
[51:00] will come back and take it
[51:03] over now we just read that the seals
[51:05] were sent to bring Sons to
[51:08] manifestation so I'm saying what are we
[51:10] doing about it what are we doing with
[51:13] the revelation of the word are we using
[51:15] it to equip ourselves to come and take
[51:18] it
[51:19] back amen take back our inheritance
[51:22] waiting for the fullness of time when
[51:25] the pyramid gets up to the top
[51:28] when the full sons of God will be
[51:30] manifested when the power of God will
[51:32] walk out oh brother Bram is getting
[51:34] excited now he says hallelujah amen and
[51:37] what what will he do we'll take every
[51:40] Power that Satan's got away from him
[51:45] Hallelujah I can bring another quote in
[51:47] here now that her revelation will make
[51:50] Satan powerless when she recognizes who
[51:52] she is what she stands for she can do
[51:55] the Greater Works yes Satan will be
[51:58] pished before
[51:59] her so I hope you seeing the picture now
[52:03] the opening of the word came to equip
[52:04] Sons to come to
[52:06] manifestation and when Sons come to
[52:08] manifestation they take
[52:10] back they take back their legal rights
[52:14] and take back every Power from Satan
[52:16] that's right see there we'll take every
[52:19] Power that Satan's got away from him yes
[52:21] sir it belongs to him see now he's
[52:25] talking about God he's the Lord that
[52:27] went out of God that's true that was the
[52:29] son of God then he made man that little
[52:32] God Amen and he said if they call those
[52:35] who the word of God came to the prophets
[52:37] if they call them Gods who was the word
[52:39] of God and God said so himself that they
[52:42] were Gods he told Moses I made you a God
[52:45] and Aaron your Prophet Hallelujah I may
[52:47] act like a religious crank but I'm not
[52:50] and when your eyes can come open and see
[52:52] those things yes amen yeah now let's get
[52:57] to it he made man a
[52:59] [Music]
[53:00] god a God in his domain yes his domain
[53:04] goes from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore
[53:07] he has control of it and when Jesus came
[53:11] being the one God without sin he proved
[53:13] it when the winds blowed he said peace
[53:16] be still oh yes and when the tree he
[53:19] said no man eat from thee verily verily
[53:22] I say unto you you that's little Gods if
[53:25] you'll say to this mountain be moved and
[53:27] don't doubt in your
[53:29] heart but believe that what you've said
[53:31] will come to pass you can have what
[53:33] you've said Hallelujah now that's where
[53:36] the problem is man speaks the thing but
[53:39] he don't believe in his heart what he
[53:40] said that's right he speaks so Wednesday
[53:43] we were trying to to connect that that
[53:45] your words can be full of Faith but your
[53:46] heart is full of fear it won't work your
[53:50] words must match what's in your heart
[53:55] okay go right back so where are we going
[53:57] back go right back to Genesis to the
[54:00] original what is it now the world and
[54:02] nature is groaning crying everything's
[54:03] moving for what for the manifestation of
[54:05] the sons of God watch now when true Sons
[54:09] born Sons filled Sons speak and their
[54:12] word is
[54:14] b so that's what we are laboring for to
[54:17] bring the church into this type of
[54:19] condition to bring the revelation of the
[54:21] word to the people amen hallelujah
[54:24] that's the job of the five-fold ministry
[54:26] amen amen until we all come into the
[54:28] unity of the faith amen until we come
[54:30] into the stature and the image of Jesus
[54:33] Christ
[54:36] amen we are trying to bring a church
[54:38] amen with a with a with the leading of
[54:40] the holy spirit that when Sons and
[54:42] Daughters speak their word is back we
[54:45] are giving you all the keys amen for you
[54:47] to come back to your rightful
[54:49] inheritance so that when you speak your
[54:51] word is
[54:54] b Jesus watch what says now very
[54:58] important I believe we're on the border
[55:01] of it right
[55:03] now but there's been some now who's
[55:06] crossed over
[55:08] Jordan they've crossed the
[55:12] border that that was many years ago that
[55:16] he says we on the border of
[55:18] it I am here to declare the seals are

[55:23] revealed there's no reason for you to
[55:25] live on the board order amen you can
[55:28] enter the promised land you can enter
[55:30] the land of the Holy Ghost where
[55:32] everything is under your
[55:34] feet amen hallelujah amen he says I

[56:01] amateure
[56:04] gods everybody agree you've been reading
[56:06] that the Bible declares you are Gods to
[56:09] whom the word of God comes to you are
[56:11] Gods amen when he made you he made you a
[56:13] little amateure God if you go and type

[1:03:00] only time that the prophet references
[1:03:02] Revelation 10 when John is taking the
[1:03:04] book he says we get over to the 10th
[1:03:06] chapter where this Mighty Angel
[1:03:08] proclaims something he had a little book
[1:03:10] that John had to eat and when he did he
[1:03:13] got it into his belly and it was bitter
[1:03:15] but in his lips it was sweet yes you see

[1:04:18] most unrar
[1:04:20] thing or probably the most misunderstood
[1:04:23] thing that people don't know that this
[1:04:26] word was sent to equip us

[1:04:46] upon somebody else did he say the spirit
[1:04:49] of the Lord is upon John he said the
[1:04:51] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:04:54] had anointed me hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:58] praise the Lord when John the Baptist
[1:04:59] took the book he didn't go there and say
[1:05:03] something else he said I am the voice of
[1:05:05] one crying in the wilderness yes sir he
[1:05:07] went straight to the scripture
