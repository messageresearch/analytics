[0:52] And when I was listening to what uh
[0:54] Joshua was preaching about, I said, "You
[0:57] know what? I'm going to tell the servant
[0:59] of God, Amen, to pray for me. Amen. And
[1:03] believe me, the prophet says when when
[1:06] healing takes place, it's gets very
[1:09] severe.
[1:10] Amen. Because what what happens? It
[1:12] tries to put a doubt in you. Amen. And

[1:31] Because I always go think back about
[1:33] what our prophet said. Amen. Our prophet
[1:36] is just not an ordinary man. Amen. Amen.
[1:40] So because whatever he speaks, Amen. is
[1:42] God speaking. And I said, Lord, you know
[1:44] what? This is what our prophet said.

[2:38] very difficult to get up. And I said,
[2:41] "Devil, you know
[2:42] what? The servant of God has prayed for
[2:45] me. The word of God declares that the
[2:47] prophet has said what I'm going to
[2:49] experience. So you just let go of me.
[2:52] I'm tired of you. And you know when I
[2:55] come to worship here, I don't want to
[2:56] play here. I don't want to play. I like
[2:59] dancing. I like lifting my hands. I like
[3:01] shouting. I like I like because I'm in
[3:03] my father's house. We in our father's we
[3:05] have we have freedom. Amen. Even at
[3:08] home, we have freedom. We can worship
[3:09] him. So I said, you know what? I don't
[3:11] want to stop dancing with with even with
[3:13] those joint pains. I just shake my legs.
[3:16] Amen. Lift my hand. Amen. And you know
[3:19] what? I want to tell you brother, this
[3:20] is you know we can we have changed
[3:23] partners. I've changed my partner. Amen.
[3:26] I dance for the Lord this morning. When
[3:28] I was in my young days, I used to dance
[3:30] for Satan. So tonight, this morning, I
[3:33] just thank the Lord this morning for
[3:35] precious brothers and sisters for also
[3:37] remembering me in prayer because I don't
[3:40] know there's a songwriter says there's
[3:42] somebody praying for you. Amen. Amen. So
[3:44] remember that there's somebody praying
[3:46] for you. So I just love the Lord and

[3:50] you all. God bless you.
[3:52] [Applause]
[3:55] Amen. We going to call our sister Kim
[3:57] forward. Amen. Who's also going to bless
[3:58] the Lord this
[4:01] morning. Amen. So we getting a triple
[4:04] treat this morning.
[4:07] Amen. Song itms and giving thanks to the
[4:11] Lord. Amen. How many of you like to give
[4:12] thanks to the Lord? Appreciate him for
[4:15] his goodness.
[4:38] Amen. I greet you all in the precious
[4:40] name of Jesus. Um it was a while back
[4:43] where pastor mentioned that um if you
[4:46] have a gift you should use it um because
[4:50] um God can easily take it away. So I
[4:53] thought about it and uh I started
[4:55] practicing the song. Not even 2 days or
[4:58] so I ended up getting a very bad throat
[5:00] infection. I couldn't even swallow
[5:03] water. Um and I was like the devil
[5:06] really doesn't want me to sin and
[5:07] glorify God's name. Apostle also
[5:10] mentioned that we like to blame the
[5:11] devil for everything you know. Um it is
[5:14] hard with kids to sing um because they
[5:16] do worry but that shouldn't be an excuse
[5:18] to give God praise and glory. Um I
[5:21] recovered from the throat infection and
[5:24] maybe a week after uh Judah ended up
[5:27] getting a throat infection as well. Um
[5:30] he wasn't eating, he wasn't drinking any
[5:32] milk. The pediatrician actually wanted
[5:34] to admit him in hospital to put him on
[5:36] drips. I said no. He continued to pray.
[5:39] He was on his antibiotics and he
[5:42] recovered. So I said, "Can't be the
[5:44] devil. Maybe it's God's putting me in a
[5:46] test, you know, to see whether I'd give
[5:48] up or continue practicing the song to
[5:51] sing." There after when he recovered
[5:53] from the throat infection, he ended up
[5:55] getting a viral infection which is
[5:57] contagious. Thankfully, he wasn't in so
[6:00] much pain, but I had to stay at home um
[6:03] because you could pass it to your other
[6:05] kids.
[6:06] So he recovered from that and um this
[6:10] week when I was practicing the song the
[6:13] sinuses started to act up nose started
[6:15] to block but I stand here victorious
[6:18] today. Amen. And I don't want to miss
[6:20] out another opportunity give God praise
[6:22] glory for everything he's done in my
[6:24] life and my family's life. Amen. I hope
[6:27] the song is a blessing.
[6:35] Every time I try to make it on my
[6:42] own, every time I try to stand, I start
[6:46] to
[6:49] fall. And all those lonely roads that I
[6:53] have traveled
[6:57] on, there was Jesus.
[7:00] Yes. Yes.
[7:03] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[7:04] Jesus. When the life I built came
[7:08] crashing to the
[7:12] ground. When the friends I had were
[7:15] nowhere to be
[7:19] found. I couldn't see it then, but I can
[7:24] see it
[7:27] now. There was Jesus.
[7:33] [Music]
[7:36] In the waiting, in the searching, in the
[7:40] healing and the hurting, like a blessing
[7:44] buried in the broken
[7:49] pieces. Every minute, every moment,
[7:53] where I've been, and where I'm going,
[7:57] even when I didn't know it or couldn't
[8:01] see it.
[8:03] There was Jesus.
[8:08] [Music]
[8:10] Thank you, Lord.
[8:13] What a friend we have in Jesus.
[8:21] Amen. Grief to bear.
[8:27] What a privilege to
[8:32] [Music]
[8:34] carry everything to God in
[8:40] prayer. In waiting, in searching, in the
[8:45] healing and the hurting, like a lasting
[8:49] buried in the broken pieces.
[8:55] every minute, every moment. Where I've
[8:58] been and where I'm going, even when I
[9:03] didn't know it or couldn't see
[9:07] it. In the waiting, in the searching, in
[9:12] the healing and the hiding, like a
[9:16] blessing, buried in the broken pieces.
[9:22] Every minute, every moment, where I've
[9:26] been, where I'm going. Even when I
[9:31] didn't know it or couldn't see
[9:34] it, there was
[9:41] Jesus. There was Jesus.
[9:47] [Music]
[9:50] [Applause]

[9:59] step of the way. Amen. We're also going
[10:02] to be blessed this morning with a song
[10:03] by Sister Karen.

[10:40] behind the speaker
[10:42] today. Amen. I'm blessed with the
[10:44] testimony and the song. Amen. I didn't
[10:47] know Sister Kim was going to sing today,
[10:48] otherwise I would have not. I was very
[10:51] blessed. I pray that you'll be blessed
[10:53] with a song.

[19:56] our faults, and our failures in word,
[19:58] action, or in deed. If we have
[19:59] displeased you or failed you, we ask you
[20:01] to forgive us, Lord. We ask you Lord
[20:04] Lord to apply the blood of Jesus Christ
[20:06] upon our lives and wash us and cleanse
[20:08] us and purify us oh God. I pray Lord
[20:11] that you would take away everything
[20:12] that's not of you Lord. Lord our own
[20:14] thoughts, our own ideas, oh God. And
[20:17] even as we come around your word to
[20:19] focus on your word now. I pray Lord that
[20:21] you'll speak to us through your precious
[20:23] word. May everything be said and done to
[20:25] bring you great glory and great honor.
[20:27] We ask these blessings now even as we

[20:31] and Savior Jesus Christ with much
[20:33] thanksgiving. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[20:37] Hallelujah. Amen. I greet you all in the
[20:39] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[20:41] Jesus Christ. Amen. It's good to be

[20:47] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Thankful. Amen.
[20:49] For those song items which do you enjoy
[20:51] it? Amen. The song specials. Praise the
[20:54] Lord.
[20:55] If you say amen like that, they will
[20:57] never sing again.
[20:59] Did you enjoy those song specials?
[21:02] Praise the Lord. You need to encourage
[21:03] one another and Amen. They'll prepare
[21:05] more songs for you to sing for you.
[21:07] Amen. And give glory to God. You know,
[21:09] there's something about talents. We were
[21:12] speaking about that last week. Amen.
[21:16] People think that uh whatever God
[21:18] entrusts to us that he want to hold us
[21:20] accountable. But in Matthew 25, he says
[21:23] he's coming to hold us accountable.
[21:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to read
[21:27] something to you quickly if you can find
[21:29] it in deep callth unto the deep.
[21:35] Amen. Deep callth unto the deep preached
[21:38] in 1953
[21:39] 1104. If you get to paragraph
[21:43] 27, Amen.
[21:48] It says there if you given a gift and
[21:52] don't use it for the glory of God, then
[21:55] God's going to make you answer for it at
[21:57] the day of judgment.
[21:59] But I mean the bride, I mean the say
[22:01] he's going to pull you out and call you
[22:03] and ask you why you never use your gift.
[22:05] Hallelujah. Amen.
[22:07] Amen. Amen. If you're given a gift,
[22:09] don't use it for the glory of God. God's
[22:11] going to make you answer for it at the
[22:12] day of judgment. That's also
[22:14] mismanagement of offices as well. That's
[22:16] right. Hallelujah. If God entrusts you
[22:19] with a special office and you you taken
[22:21] the undertaking to do that, we need to
[22:23] fulfill it to the best of our ability
[22:25] and not casually. Right? He goes on to
[22:28] say, he says without any reflection.
[22:30] Now, he's talking about a man that's
[22:32] using his talent for the world. He said,
[22:34] I hear not long ago called peace in the
[22:35] valley. What a mouthless voice. But what
[22:38] is he using it for? God would require
[22:40] that. We had Steuart emblem. Amen. That
[22:43] was singing here. There is no there is
[22:45] it is no secret what God can do which
[22:47] was taken first place in all songs in
[22:49] the nation. Beautiful won many souls to
[22:52] Christ. God makes us answer for our
[22:55] talent. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[22:58] Amen. I thought I'll just read that to
[23:00] you. Amen. To tie in with last week's
[23:02] message because maybe you thought I was
[23:04] just being uh a miserable pastor was
[23:07] asking you to do stuff. Praise the Lord.
[23:10] Amen. Let's turn to the Bible this
[23:11] morning.
[23:13] want to speak uh and just title
[23:16] this I give it to you. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[23:22] Amen. That becomes the language that we
[23:25] ought to be speaking. Hallelujah. In
[23:27] first person,
[23:29] I give it to you. Amen.
[23:33] Praise the Lord. Amen. We go to the book
[23:36] of chapter Acts verse one.
[23:40] Now remember, you can only give what you
[23:43] have. That's right.
[23:45] Acts chapter one. But now our Lord
[23:49] Jesus, okay, let's go to verse seven
[23:51] there.
[23:53] Amen. Our Lord Jesus is fixing to leave
[23:56] the earth. Amen. He's about to ascend to
[23:59] heaven. He's about to change
[24:02] dimensions. And here, maybe go to verse
[24:05] six and see what they're telling Jesus
[24:06] here. Right? When they therefore came
[24:10] together, they asked of
[24:12] him, Lord, what will be at this time?
[24:15] What will thou at this time restore
[24:17] again the kingdom to
[24:19] Israel? What are they looking for? A
[24:22] kingdom in the glory of Solomon and like
[24:23] David and they want a king again. Yes.
[24:27] Imagine Jesus is fixing to to leave the
[24:29] earth and that's the question they're
[24:30] asking him. Watch how Jesus switches
[24:33] their mind and pulls them to what they
[24:36] should be focusing on. Yes. Amen. Next
[24:38] verse. He said unto them, "It is not for
[24:41] you to know the times or the seasons."
[24:44] Why you asking me silly questions like
[24:46] this? Yes. Because redemption was not to
[24:50] restore a king in Israel. They asking
[24:53] when you going to restore a king in
[24:55] Israel. Jesus is telling them that's not
[24:57] for you. Because redemption is not to
[25:00] restore a king in Israel. It's to
[25:03] restore mankind back to its original
[25:05] condition. Amen. So he's going to focus
[25:07] them and tell them what they have really
[25:08] come for. He
[25:10] says which the father put in his own
[25:13] power. And next he goes and he says,
[25:14] "But you shall receive power." After the
[25:18] Holy Ghost has come upon you. Amen.
[25:20] That's what I have come to do. I am
[25:22] going away so that one might come to
[25:24] give you power. Amen. And you shall be
[25:28] witnesses. Now, anybody that's
[25:30] witnessing or evangelizing or going
[25:32] forth can't go without that first part
[25:35] having received power from the Holy
[25:37] Ghost. If he's going out, he's going in
[25:39] his own will. Amen. But he must be an
[25:41] Holy Ghost fil power. Amen. Filled
[25:44] Christian that goes out and you shall be
[25:46] witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, in all
[25:48] Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the
[25:51] uttermost parts of the earth. The Lord
[25:53] had blessings with the reading of his
[25:54] word. You may be seated. I want to get
[25:56] to Acts chapter 2 there. Hallelujah.
[26:06] Amen. Sorry, Acts chapter 3. Let's get
[26:08] to Acts chapter
[26:10] 3. We'll deal with Acts chapter 2 some
[26:13] other time. Amen. Acts chapter 3. Now
[26:15] Peter and John went up together in the
[26:19] temple at the hour of prayer being the
[26:22] 9th hour. And a certain lame man from
[26:24] his mother's womb was carried whom they
[26:27] daily whom they laid daily at the temple
[26:30] which is beautiful. Now if you read
[26:32] further in chapter 4, Amen. It tells you
[26:35] that this man was 40 years old. And
[26:38] we're just reading they laid him daily
[26:40] at the temple. So this man was also
[26:42] laying there when Jesus was around.
[26:46] Everybody understand?
[26:48] This man was there when Jesus was
[26:50] around. But you know like how Jesus
[26:54] healed a man at the pool of Bethesda.
[26:57] There were hundreds of people around but
[26:58] he healed one man because this man was
[27:01] not supposed to be healed under Jesus
[27:03] ministry.
[27:04] He was left for greater works to come.
[27:07] Hallelujah.
[27:09] Okay. So he's laid daily at the temple
[27:12] which is called beautiful to ask arms of
[27:14] them that entered into the temple. So
[27:17] you must ask to receive. That's the
[27:19] kingdom principle. Ask and you shall
[27:21] receive. Amen. Seek and you shall find.
[27:24] Knock and the door shall be open. So
[27:26] there's a part for us to play in
[27:28] accessing kingdom principles.
[27:31] [Music]
[27:33] Seeing Peter and John going into the
[27:36] temple asked and
[27:39] arms and Peter fastening his eyes on him
[27:43] upon him with John said, "Look on us."
[27:47] Amen. Amen.
[27:51] And he gave heed unto them, expecting to
[27:53] receive something of them. Then Peter
[27:56] said, "Silver and gold have I none, but
[27:59] such as I have." Amen. Amen. I'm packing
[28:03] a power. You shall receive power. Amen.
[28:06] I've got this power and I'm sent to
[28:09] release the power. Such as I have. Give
[28:12] I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of
[28:16] Nazareth, rise up and walk. Amen. Thank
[28:19] you, Lord. And he took him by the right
[28:21] hand. Sometimes people need assistance.
[28:24] Amen. Amen. Amen. Don't just speak.
[28:28] Sometimes they need an assistance. Their
[28:31] legs are weak. Amen. You need to go
[28:33] there. Reach out your hand. Pull them
[28:35] up. Don't be scared when you're praying
[28:37] for people. You're praying for a
[28:39] paralyzed person. You're praying for a
[28:41] crippled person. Stand there till you
[28:43] see the power of God manifest. Sometimes
[28:45] we just want to speak the word and walk
[28:47] away. That's not what Peter and John
[28:49] did.
[28:50] They spoke the word and they assisted a
[28:52] man to see the miracle come to pass.
[28:57] Thank you. Amen. I'm speaking this so
[29:00] that we learn these things. Took him by
[29:02] the right hand, lifted him up and
[29:05] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[29:08] received strength. Amen. So there must
[29:10] be an action part to it. Amen. Thank
[29:13] you, Lord. Only when they took him,
[29:15] picked him up, it says immediately his
[29:17] legs received strength.
[29:19] Thank you, Lord. So, I say when we pray
[29:21] for you, check yourself. Thank you.
[29:23] Check your leg. Check your hand. Check
[29:25] the part that you having problem with.
[29:27] Amen. Amen. Thank you. Bring faith to
[29:30] activate. Amen. Let it activate. Amen.
[29:33] Praise the Lord. The word of God is
[29:34] packed with power. Amen. It's packed
[29:36] with promise. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[29:40] And he leaping up stood and walked and
[29:42] entered with them into the temple
[29:44] walking and leaping and praising God.
[29:48] And all the people saw him walking and
[29:50] praising God. And they knew that it was
[29:53] he which set for arms at the beautiful
[29:56] gate of the temple. And they were filled
[29:58] with wonder and amazement at that which
[30:01] had happened unto him. Amen. Now, I want
[30:04] you to know when when Peter, the same
[30:06] Peter preached in Acts chapter 2, there
[30:09] 3,000 souls got saved. Amen. At this
[30:13] miracle,
[30:14] because healing is a bait. Amen. At this
[30:17] miracle, Amen. There was also a number
[30:20] of people that came. Amen. Let's just
[30:22] get to that. We can read it there.
[30:25] Praise the Lord. In Acts chapter 4,
[30:27] verse 4.
[30:29] Amen. Look at this miracle now. How be
[30:33] it many of them which heard the word
[30:35] believed. And the number of men was
[30:37] about 5,000.
[30:40] So 5,000 came to the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:42] because they saw this man get healed.
[30:45] And watch straight after Peter healed or
[30:49] or prayed or spoke over this man and and
[30:52] God healed this man, he starts to share
[30:54] the word because they said by what power
[30:56] have you done these things?
[30:58] Praise the Lord. Amen. Verse seven
[31:01] there. And they that had set them in the
[31:03] midst asked, "By what power or by what
[31:06] name have you done this?"
[31:09] Then Peter filled with the Holy
[31:11] Ghost. Amen. Watch now. Every time you
[31:14] get an opportunity, the healing is for
[31:16] you to share the gospel. Amen. Amen.
[31:19] said unto them, "You rulers and of the
[31:21] people and elders of Israel, if we this
[31:24] day be examined of the good deed done to
[31:26] the omnipotent important man, by what
[31:29] means he is made old, be it known unto
[31:33] you all, and to all the people of
[31:35] Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ
[31:38] of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom
[31:40] God raised from the dead, even by him,
[31:43] do this man stand here before you hold."
[31:45] Amen. Don't just give one word answers.
[31:47] Amen. Who is this man? Jesus. Amen. He's
[31:50] sharing the gospel. You crucified him.
[31:52] Amen. Amen. Amen. And he raised from the
[31:56] dead. Watch in a few sentences. He's
[31:58] sharing the gospel. Yes. Amen.
[32:02] This is the stone. Now watch. We are
[32:04] living in no other age, but this is the
[32:06] coming of the headstone.
[32:08] The age and time we are living now is
[32:10] the coming of the headstone. Amen.
[32:14] This is the stone which was set not of
[32:17] your builders, which is become the head
[32:19] of the corner. Neither is the salvation
[32:22] in any other, for there is none other
[32:24] name under heaven given among men,
[32:26] whereby we must be saved. Now when they
[32:29] saw the boldness of Peter and John, and
[32:32] perceived that they were unlearned and
[32:33] ignorant men, they marveled, and they
[32:36] took knowledge of them that they had
[32:38] been with Jesus.
[32:40] Hallelujah. Glory. Praise the Lord. In
[32:44] verse 22, this is what I was talking
[32:46] about earlier. It tells you, "For the
[32:47] man was above 40 years old." I'd like to
[32:50] tell you, I was telling you this last
[32:51] week, that this was the 41st year of the
[32:53] man. Hallelujah.
[32:57] Amen.
[32:59] Hallelujah. 40 days, Goliath taunted the
[33:02] children of Israel. But on the 41st day,
[33:05] David came into the army. Amen. This man
[33:08] was now 40 years old. But on his 41st
[33:11] year, Peter and John come to bring
[33:13] deliverance to him.
[33:16] Praise the Lord. Yes. Amen.
[33:20] Amen.
[33:24] I want to read 29 because I I this is
[33:26] important for us to go
[33:27] on. And now, Lord, behold their
[33:30] threatenings. So, this is Peter now
[33:32] praying. Grant unto thy servants that
[33:35] with all boldness they may speak thy
[33:37] word. Amen. by stretching forth thine
[33:40] hand to heal, and that signs and wonders
[33:43] may be done by the name of thy holy
[33:45] child Jesus. And when they had prayed,
[33:47] the place was shaken.
[33:50] Oh yes. Amen. I I like to be in that
[33:52] kind of prayer where the praise is
[33:54] shaken. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[33:58] And where they were assembled together
[34:01] and they were all filled with the Holy
[34:02] Ghost and they spake the word of God
[34:05] with boldness.
[34:06] And the multitude of them that believed
[34:08] were of one heart and of one soul,
[34:11] neither said any of them that ought
[34:13] ought of the things which he had
[34:16] possessed of his own, but they had all
[34:17] things in common. And with great power
[34:19] gave the apostles witness of the
[34:21] resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and
[34:23] great grace was upon them all. Amen. I
[34:26] say that the bride of Jesus Christ
[34:28] carries a great grace. Amen. Great grace
[34:32] is upon us all. Amen. because thy
[34:35] headstone has come down with shoutings
[34:36] of grace. Grace. Amen. So I say a great
[34:40] grace is upon the bride of Jesus Christ.
[34:42] Amen. Hallelujah.
[34:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. Everyone feeling
[34:47] good? Oh yes. Amen.
[34:50] So we see that when when Jesus ascended,
[34:53] he told him, I'm going to give you
[34:54] power. Yes.
[34:59] Amen. He was going to give them a power.
[35:02] Yes. Amen.
[35:04] And I want to say this, amen, that what
[35:07] we are talking about, the real question
[35:09] we are asking is, is this the time for
[35:12] sons of God to be manifested?
[35:15] Yes. Amen. When are we going to be
[35:17] adopted and speak with the authority of
[35:19] the father?
[35:21] Amen. No other time or no other season,
[35:24] but now. Amen. Maybe you were excited to
[35:27] be called a bride. Good.
[35:29] Maybe you were excited to call the wife.
[35:31] Good. But you were called to reproduce
[35:34] the life of Christ. Amen. Amen. That's
[35:37] the ultimate goal. We were called to
[35:39] become sons and daughters of God because
[35:41] that's what we were predestinated unto.
[35:45] Amen. It's good to rejoice that we are
[35:47] the bride. I'm happy for you. You were
[35:50] called in. I'm happy for you that you
[35:52] were made part of the marriage ceremony,
[35:55] but that's not it.
[35:57] We must take the seed word.
[36:00] And the seed word is now going to
[36:02] reproduce the life of Christ. God don't
[36:05] want a powerless church. God don't want
[36:07] a defeated church. God don't want to
[36:10] educate the church. God has come to put
[36:12] his power back in the church.
[36:15] Amen. What good it be if we explain the
[36:18] Bible. Amen. But we can't see his word
[36:20] made manifest. They took note that these
[36:23] men had been with Jesus. I said, "How
[36:25] about us?" I say it's time people took
[36:27] note that we had been with Jesus.
[36:30] Lord, let the effect of the opening of
[36:32] the word have its full effect upon my
[36:35] life.
[36:36] I don't want it just for theory.
[36:39] Amen. Hallelujah. So that's what we are
[36:42] asking. When are we going to manifest?
[36:44] When are we going to speak like God
[36:46] speaks? When are we going to walk like
[36:48] God works? When are we going to behave
[36:51] like God behaves? Amen.
[36:54] Amen. Do you know nature itself is
[36:56] groaning? You can read that in Romans
[36:59] chapter 8. Nature is groaning for you to
[37:01] become a son and daughter of God with
[37:03] authority.
[37:05] Because animals are going extinct.
[37:09] Pollution is all over the earth. They
[37:11] are saying free us from this. The
[37:14] corruptness of man, industrialization
[37:16] and and and all pollutions are polluting
[37:19] the earth.
[37:21] So nature is crying out hey what's the
[37:24] matter with you
[37:26] all nature is groaning crying
[37:31] in travail and the Bible says that we
[37:34] grown within ourselves because we can't
[37:37] stand to stay in this kind of an
[37:39] atmosphere we were not built for this
[37:41] kind of an atmosphere an atmosphere of
[37:43] doubt an atmosphere of fear an
[37:46] atmosphere of depression an atmosphere
[37:48] of sickness amen we were built for
[37:50] perfection ction. We were built for
[37:51] perfect climate. We were built for
[37:53] another time and season. Amen. So, we
[37:55] are groaning within ourselves to get
[37:57] back to that condition.
[38:00] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[38:03] Amen. Come on. We got to break through
[38:05] barriers. We got to break through
[38:07] spiritual frontiers. Now, we were called
[38:09] for such a time as this. We were called
[38:11] to position the church on the sides of
[38:13] the north. Amen. We were called to take
[38:15] on invading armies. We were called for
[38:17] this time and season. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[38:20] Hallelujah.
[38:22] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[38:26] People are fearful to speak. Amen. You
[38:28] find people are afraid in this time and
[38:30] season. The prophet prophesied and he
[38:32] said that people will be gone insane.
[38:34] They need to see psychologist upon
[38:36] psychologist until the psychologist
[38:38] needs to see another psychologist.
[38:40] Insanity has Amen. Grasp the old world.
[38:43] Oh yes.
[38:45] That's right. Amen. I say you don't need
[38:47] to see a psychologist. You need the word
[38:49] of God in your life. The word of God is
[38:51] transforming power. My word is spirit
[38:54] and life. Amen. Spirit and truth. Amen.
[38:58] Hallelujah.
[38:59] Amen. So what we are looking at is the
[39:02] headstone age that we are living in now.
[39:04] This is the age of the capstone. Amen.
[39:07] And I don't know if you're believing
[39:08] that the capstone is coming at a future
[39:10] time after the rapture is gone. The
[39:13] headstone is coming now upon sons and
[39:15] daughters of God to fit so perfectly
[39:17] with his bride, to fit so perfectly with
[39:19] his church. Amen. Until you can't tell
[39:22] them apart.
[39:26] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[39:29] It's coming to fit so perfectly.
[39:32] Hallelujah.
[39:35] Praise God.
[39:37] Now, we we can read there in Ephesians
[39:39] chapter 1. I don't want to read it, but
[39:41] it talks about the mystery of his will.
[39:44] It could be one nine. Maybe you can if
[39:46] you can find it where it talks about the
[39:47] mystery of his will. You can put it up
[39:49] so they can see it. So God's will for
[39:52] our lives is a mystery.
[39:56] And I can't come to you and tell you
[39:58] what God's will for your life is. I am
[40:01] not a prophet.
[40:04] Right? But God has a will for each one
[40:07] of you. Amen. God has a plan for each
[40:09] one of you. Praise the Lord.
[40:14] Amen. If you get to my notes, you can
[40:16] probably find where the prophet is
[40:17] speaking about this. He says, "God's
[40:19] will is a mystery." Amen. And each man
[40:23] has to seek out the will of God for his
[40:25] or herself. Amen. That's right. Must the
[40:27] pastor seek it out for you? He's saying
[40:29] each man must seek out the will of God.
[40:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. It's the very
[40:34] first quote there. Amen. God's mystery.
[40:37] How do we find out? Paul, it was known
[40:40] to him. He said he didn't confer with
[40:42] any man, no flesh, blood. He went to no
[40:46] school, no seminary. He had nothing to
[40:49] do with it. It was revealed to him by
[40:51] Jesus Christ. Amen. Who met him on the
[40:55] road to Damascus in a light in a pillar
[40:57] of fire and it called him and he went to
[41:00] Arabia and dwelt there three years.
[41:02] That's right.
[41:04] Hallelujah. Amen. He says God since the
[41:06] beginning of the world predestinated us
[41:09] unto adoption of sons. So watch what he
[41:11] how he progressed so far. Now he said
[41:13] God wants each one of you to find the
[41:15] will of God. Then he's telling you that
[41:18] the will of God is for you to be a
[41:19] predestinated son and daughter of God.
[41:22] Lord,
[41:27] did you get my notes, brother?
[41:30] Amen. It was the very first quote after
[41:32] the scripture.
[41:35] Amen. God since the beginning of the
[41:37] world predestinated us unto adoption of
[41:39] sons. Now the whole creation is groaning
[41:42] waiting for manifestation of the sons of
[41:44] God. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. In the
[41:47] message adoption chapter 4, it's the
[41:50] next quote there. He says, "Now he said
[41:54] he made known unto us the mystery. Get
[41:57] the Holy Spirit on you sometime and
[42:00] start running that and watch how it
[42:02] goes." It's a mystery that's been hidden
[42:05] since the foundation of the world
[42:07] waiting for the manifestation of the
[42:09] sons of God. So once you get the Holy
[42:12] Ghost, the mystery is revealed.
[42:13] Hallelujah. Amen.
[42:17] Do you know that people don't can't
[42:19] understand the question? I'll ask you
[42:21] this question. Why was the Holy Ghost
[42:24] given?
[42:27] What is the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[42:29] for you? Why give you the Holy Ghost?
[42:35] Amen. Why give you the Holy
[42:39] Ghost? You can ponder on that. I want to
[42:42] read in adoption chapter 4 there where
[42:45] he's speaking about from verse 18. Amen.
[42:50] So you you can't find any of these
[42:51] quotes on my notes. Maybe I sent you the
[42:53] wrong notes
[42:56] then. What notes did I send you?
[43:00] Did it start off with uh Acts chapter
[43:03] 1:8?
[43:05] Yeah. So that's the same notes. Amen. So
[43:07] let's get to the quote that I want to
[43:08] read there. It says, "Tell me,
[43:11] brother, tell me my sister,
[43:14] when was the time that sons of God was
[43:17] ever to be manifested outside of this
[43:20] time?" Now,
[43:24] he's asking a question. Yes.
[43:27] And now I know that we only have
[43:28] brothers and sisters here. We don't have
[43:31] inbetweens.
[43:35] So the prophet is asking you a clear
[43:37] question. Tell me
[43:39] brother, tell me
[43:41] sister, when was the time that sons of
[43:44] God was ever to be manifested out of Is
[43:47] this on? Can we take this off here? I
[43:49] think it's squeaking in. Just pull this
[43:51] out here.
[43:53] blood outside of this time.
[43:56] Now, amen. He says, "When was there ever
[44:00] a time for sons to be manifested outside
[44:02] of this time?"
[44:05] Amen.
[44:07] When were there ever a time in history
[44:10] there was to manifest the time to
[44:12] deliver all nature? Yes. Amen. Yes.
[44:19] Don't walk past a sick bird. Deliver
[44:22] nature.
[44:24] Amen. Don't walk past a sick apossum.
[44:27] Deliver nature.
[44:29] Don't walk past a dead fish. Deliver
[44:32] nature. Amen.
[44:38] Amen. Nature. The nature itself is
[44:41] groaning, waiting for the time of
[44:44] manifestation
[44:47] to be made known.
[44:49] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Amen. It
[44:53] had to wait till this time. Amen. Amen.
[44:59] Tell your neighbor this time is not 60
[45:00] years ago.
[45:05] Now all things have been brought coming
[45:08] shaping up to a Watch how it brings a
[45:10] thought now to the headstone. Did I not
[45:12] say we're in the headstone ministry? The
[45:14] coming of the headstone has already
[45:16] happened.
[45:20] Shaping up to a headstone to the
[45:23] manifestation of sons of God coming back
[45:25] and the spirit of God coming into these
[45:28] men. Amen.
[45:32] Hallelujah. Amen.
[45:34] [Music]
[45:35] I pray that we don't have a
[45:38] denominational or let me not say
[45:40] denominational. I pray we don't have the
[45:42] Holy Ghost that fell on Isuza Street.
[45:48] Hallelujah. There's a difference between
[45:50] the Holy Ghost that fell at Isuza Street
[45:52] and the Holy Ghost that's poured out
[45:54] now. Yes. Amen.
[45:57] Amen. Hallelujah. So watch what Holy
[46:01] Ghost you have. Do you have the Isuza
[46:04] Street Holy Ghost
[46:07] 1906
[46:09] outpouring or do you have the Holy Ghost
[46:11] that's come via the end time message?
[46:16] Can you recognize your day and its
[46:18] message?
[46:20] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[46:24] The spirit of God coming to these men so
[46:27] perfectly. Watch now until their
[46:30] ministry will be so close like Christ
[46:33] till it will join him and the church
[46:35] together. Amen. Now if I join something
[46:38] together so perfectly you won't be able
[46:40] to tell it apart. Brother Brandon says
[46:42] you can't even put a razor blade there.
[46:45] That is why they looked at the prophet
[46:47] and they asked him are you Jesus Christ?
[46:49] I say when are they going to ask us?
[46:52] Amen. Amen. Amen. If we are so joined
[46:55] with the headstorm,
[46:57] so joined with this pyramid that's come
[46:59] down. Yes.
[47:01] So joined
[47:03] brothers, I think we need to move those
[47:05] speakers forward. We can't have it so
[47:06] close here. Amen.
[47:09] Praise the Lord. So close. Amen. So
[47:14] fitly joined together that you can't
[47:16] tell it apart.
[47:19] Amen. I must not be able to tell you and
[47:22] Christ apart. Amen. Amen.
[47:27] The works that Jesus did must you do
[47:30] also. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[47:40] What does he say
[47:42] now? So perfectly until their ministry
[47:46] will be so close like Christ. Amen. till
[47:50] it will join him and his church
[47:52] together.
[47:55] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. It will
[47:57] join his church together.
[48:01] Now, if he joins his church and
[48:03] his brothers, can we finish this quickly
[48:05] now? You are disturbing
[48:08] me. If it is joined so closely together,
[48:12] how can we be asking, "Lord, I want a
[48:13] closer walk with
[48:15] you. Lord, come Lord Jesus.
[48:19] Are we praying mindless prayers? Yes.
[48:24] Amen. Amen. We coming to the pastor
[48:26] here. We feel so spiritual. Come in the
[48:29] prayer line. What you need, sister?
[48:30] Brother, I want a closer walk with the
[48:32] Lord. How can I give you a closer walk
[48:35] with the Lord? When brother Brandham is
[48:37] telling you, if you want a closer walk,
[48:38] read your Bible and pray.
[48:41] So, what you are coming and you're
[48:42] telling me to pray over you so that you
[48:43] can read your Bible and pray, I can't
[48:46] force you to read your Bible and pray.
[48:49] Amen. Hallelujah. If I want to spend
[48:51] more time reading my Bible, what must I
[48:53] do? Make time to read my Bible.
[48:57] If I want to pray more, what must I do?
[48:59] Make time to pray.
[49:02] So, I don't want to see any one of you
[49:03] that's sitting here today come into the
[49:05] prayer line and tell me, I want a closer
[49:07] walk with the Lord.
[49:12] Does that make sense?
[49:15] It's your walk. Yeah. In fact, what
[49:19] closer walk you want when he's supposed
[49:21] to be in you?
[49:24] It's funny, Sunny. Yeah. It's not God
[49:28] above us. Amen.
[49:31] People want Jesus and he walks with me
[49:34] and he talks with me. They wanted Jesus
[49:37] of 2,000 years ago.
[49:40] Jesus walk with me. He don't want to
[49:42] walk with you. He wants to be in you.
[49:45] Amen. Amen. Yes.
[49:50] Don't nullify what Jesus did at the
[49:52] cross. Don't nullify what he did when he
[49:55] said, "I'm going to give you power." You
[49:57] know what the people want? They don't
[49:59] want the Holy Ghost. They want this
[50:00] gentle Jesus to walk with them when they
[50:03] seek him as heal
[50:04] them. They want him with them.
[50:08] Hallelujah. But Jesus don't want to be
[50:10] just with you. Jesus wants to be in you.
[50:13] Amen. I say it again. This is not the
[50:15] time of God above us. This is not the
[50:17] time of God with us. This is the time of
[50:19] God in us. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[50:24] Praise the Lord. He says we're at the
[50:26] capping of the pyramid. Amen.
[50:30] We're in the book of Revelation at the
[50:31] last chapter. Science says we are 3
[50:34] minutes to midnight. Amen.
[50:36] I don't know if if maybe we feel like
[50:38] we've got years on the earth.
[50:43] Maybe we feel like, oh, there'll be
[50:45] another generation, maybe multitudes of
[50:48] generations coming after us.
[50:52] How do we
[50:55] feel? He says, you know, the pyramid was
[50:58] never kept, right? Why wasn't the
[51:01] capstone put on it, the headstone on top
[51:03] of it? Because he was rejected when he
[51:06] come. He was a rejected stone, but it
[51:09] will be kept.
[51:11] And then those stones that fit around
[51:13] that head stone and if you can identify
[51:15] that you're one of the stones footing
[51:17] around the headstone, then watch what
[51:19] his expectation is of us.
[51:22] It says when those stones that around
[51:24] the headstone Oh, I'm so glad that I'm
[51:28] one of those stones. Amen. Amen. Where's
[51:30] my picture? Praise the Lord. Amen.
[51:33] Hallelujah. Yes.
[51:36] I am one of the stones that's going to
[51:38] fit this headstone. That's fitting this
[51:39] headstone.
[51:40] I am footing this head stone. Are you
[51:42] part your footing the head stone? Watch
[51:45] what he's saying. Will have to be stones
[51:48] that be so completely like this stone.
[51:51] Amen.
[51:53] Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:58] Thank you, Lord. The mighty angel coming
[52:00] down, shoutings of grace, grace. The
[52:03] stone that's going to unite with this,
[52:05] he said, will be completely like this
[52:06] stone. Amen. Amen.
[52:09] Thank you, Lord. That'll fit, joint, and
[52:12] everywhere. Amen.
[52:15] Praise the Lord.
[52:18] Praise the Lord. Amen. I want you to
[52:21] know adoption is for one day.
[52:24] You can't keep calling yourself adopted
[52:26] son. You always were a son. The adoption
[52:30] ceremony is for one day. After that,
[52:32] your title is back son. Amen. Yes. Amen.
[52:37] Come on, somebody else. Praise the Lord.
[52:40] Yes. If you're calling yourself adopted
[52:42] son, meaning you are either in the
[52:43] process
[52:46] or you only recognize yourself by that
[52:48] title.
[52:49] This adoption is not like me taking
[52:52] somebody else's son. You were born in
[52:54] the house. God placed you under the
[52:56] tutotorship of the Holy Ghost. That's
[52:58] right. He's going to lead you and guide
[53:00] you into all truth. Amen. Then he's
[53:02] going to come and give an account for
[53:03] you. That's right. and say, "This is my
[53:05] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Go
[53:07] to the nations of the world and prophesy
[53:09] again." Amen.
[53:11] After that, you don't go around and they
[53:14] say, "Who are you?" "Me? I'm an adopted
[53:16] son." No, they're waiting for
[53:18] manifestation of sons. It doesn't say
[53:20] they're manifestation of adopted sons.
[53:22] Yes. Like I was telling you, the bride
[53:25] comes into the marriage ceremony, she
[53:27] don't leave there as bride. She leaves
[53:30] there as wife. Amen. So you come to the
[53:32] adoption ceremony for the adoption, but
[53:34] now we are the manifested sons and
[53:36] daughters of God.
[53:39] Hallelujah. G. Praise the Lord. I I I I
[53:43] I don't know. Amen. I can't apologize
[53:46] for the word, but I'm saying if this is
[53:48] not for you, then I don't know what
[53:49] you're doing here.
[53:52] This is not Jesus loves you. Jesus died
[53:54] on the cross for you. This is to bring
[53:56] sons and daughters back to their
[53:58] original condition. I am crying out to
[54:01] get back to my original position.
[54:04] Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord.
[54:07] Thank you, Lord. So, Brother Romesh,
[54:08] when I look at you, I I can't be able to
[54:11] tell you if you are the headstone itself
[54:14] or you're the stone around the
[54:15] headstone.
[54:19] Amen. Is that what the prover is saying
[54:21] here? The stones that around the
[54:24] headstone will have to be stones that'll
[54:26] be so completely like that stone. Yes.
[54:28] Amen. Amen. Perfect. So I can't now now
[54:33] that the headstone is come I can't even
[54:35] if I take a razor blade I won't be able
[54:37] to find the ceiling point.
[54:40] When I'm saying ceiling I'm not talking
[54:41] about this ceiling. I'm talking about s
[54:43] e a l.
[54:47] This is not like tiles where you can see
[54:50] grout.
[54:52] Wonderful.
[54:54] Amen.
[54:57] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord. I pray
[55:00] this is okay this morning. Yes. Amen.
[55:02] Amen.
[55:04] Then he goes on to say, "The pyramid is
[55:06] so perfect. You can't run a razor blade
[55:09] between them where them stones get go
[55:11] together. Such beautiful
[55:16] masonry. Some of them would weigh
[55:19] hundreds of tons up in the air. So
[55:21] perfectly set together. That's the way
[55:23] God is bringing his church. Yes. We
[55:26] fitly join together one heart and one
[55:29] accord. Now, if you know, if you saw
[55:32] yesterday, if you if you're looking at
[55:34] this guy Pierce Morgan
[55:36] uncensored or if you're looking at news
[55:38] in the last week, he just had a story
[55:40] about it. Even now, they are probing
[55:43] about the pyramid of Giza.
[55:45] If you don't know what that is, that's
[55:46] the pyramids Enoch built.
[55:50] Go see it there.
[55:52] They are now saying that there's
[55:54] something there are foundations under
[55:56] the pyramid. Well, we always knew this
[55:59] this gospel is built on the foundations
[56:01] of the apostles.
[56:03] Doesn't the Bible tell us that this
[56:05] pyramid city is built on the foundations
[56:07] of the apostles and the prophets?
[56:10] So, they made a startling discovery that
[56:12] beneath these pyramids could be
[56:15] foundations. I say that's nothing new.
[56:18] That's God's second Bible. Amen. Amen.
[56:23] In fact, we live in a time period where
[56:25] God's three Bibles are visible to us.
[56:27] That's right. We can look up at the
[56:29] heavens. That's his first Bible.
[56:32] We look now at the pyramid of Giza,
[56:35] Enoch's pyramid, second Bible, and we
[56:38] have the written word, God's written
[56:40] Bible. Amen.
[56:42] Praise the Lord. Civilizations will pass
[56:44] away. Yes. But I tell you, he said,
[56:47] "Heavens and earth will pass away, but
[56:49] my word, first heaven, my word, pyramid,
[56:53] my
[56:54] word will never pass away." Hallelujah.
[56:59] So they are talking about foundations
[57:01] beneath the pyramid and the Egyptian
[57:02] government will never ever approve them
[57:05] to dig around those pyramids because
[57:06] they make millions and millions on
[57:08] tourism.
[57:10] Right. But you know how those pyramids
[57:12] came out. That's right. Amen.
[57:16] Two things were being built in that
[57:18] time. One is written in the word and
[57:21] Enoch was given blueprints
[57:24] to build an ark to take them over the
[57:26] tribulation period. But Enoch is a type
[57:29] of the bride. Amen. And the pyramid was
[57:31] built in silence. Hallelujah. Under the
[57:34] silence of that seventh seal.
[57:38] Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:41] They don't know how it's there. Yes. If
[57:44] you go to the church world today, you
[57:45] ask them, "How is this pyramid city
[57:47] being raised up?" It's being built in
[57:49] silence. Amen. Under the silence of that
[57:52] seventh seal, a mighty army is raising
[57:54] up.
[57:56] Oh yes. Thank you, Lord. Praise the
[57:57] Lord. Amen. Let's move. We got to come
[57:59] to our main point. Amen. Praise the
[58:01] Lord. Amen. In the next quote there, he
[58:04] says, "Now notice that the coming of the
[58:05] Lord Jesus is so close at
[58:08] hand." Amen. until the spirit from way
[58:10] down in here just barely justification
[58:13] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[58:15] Ghost. Watch now what's the fourth part
[58:18] I say this is Luther
[58:21] justification sanctification is Wesley
[58:24] baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the
[58:27] sides of the Jordan that's 1906uza
[58:31] street but he says and now
[58:34] right into the time of the coming of the
[58:37] headstone
[58:42] we are now right at the coming of the
[58:43] headstone right Amen Amen. I say it
[58:46] again, not a future coming. The
[58:48] headstone has come. Amen. To unite with
[58:51] the body. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[58:54] Let's move. Amen.
[58:57] Hallelujah. The church has got to be so
[59:00] Am I at the right
[59:03] place? Yeah. The church has got to be so
[59:06] perfectly like Christ until Christ and
[59:09] the church can unite together the same
[59:11] spirit. And if the spirit of Christ is
[59:13] in you, it makes you live the life of
[59:16] Christ, act the life of Christ, do the
[59:19] works of Christ.
[59:21] Thank you, Lord.
[59:23] He that believeth on me, the works shall
[59:25] I do also. See, now we're going to have
[59:29] we got a ministry coming that's just
[59:32] exactly like the life of Christ. Amen.
[59:36] What does that ministry identify? The
[59:38] life, the coming of the Lord. Amen. Pay
[59:43] attention to what he's saying now. He's
[59:45] saying, "Son of man is going to be
[59:46] revealed through a prophetic gift."
[59:49] And he's saying, "What is that going to
[59:51] do?" It's going to tell you that it's
[59:53] the coming of the Lord.
[59:55] Amen.
[59:58] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:05] Then he's also going to go and tell you,
[1:00:07] I'm I'm laying these things because
[1:00:09] we're going to hit our highlight now.
[1:00:11] He's telling you if you have been given
[1:00:13] an inheritance, you can't just go and
[1:00:15] take your inheritance. Somebody has to
[1:00:17] come to lead you to your inheritance.
[1:00:19] Somebody has to come to read the will to
[1:00:21] you. Somebody has to come to detail your
[1:00:24] inheritance and take you to your
[1:00:26] inheritance.
[1:00:27] Amen. Very quickly, let's see how he's
[1:00:29] bringing it out. He says he has
[1:00:31] predestinated us unto this inheritance.
[1:00:34] If
[1:00:36] I if I'm a right inheritance of
[1:00:39] something, if God is knocking at my
[1:00:41] heart saying, "William Brandham, I
[1:00:43] called you a long time ago before the
[1:00:44] foundation of the world to preach the
[1:00:46] gospel. I have an inheritance, an
[1:00:49] inheritance of eternal life. Now God
[1:00:51] sent Jesus to make that inheritance real
[1:00:55] to me." Amen. Because there was nothing
[1:00:58] I could do to inherit it. Yes. Right.
[1:01:03] Even if it was valid, there's nothing I
[1:01:05] could do. But in the fullness of time,
[1:01:07] God sent his in his own good time. Jesus
[1:01:11] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:01:13] the world. His blood was shed that I may
[1:01:16] go to my inheritance.
[1:01:21] Thank you, Lord. To be what? What
[1:01:24] inheritance? The sunship.
[1:01:26] Oh, I thought he was going to say
[1:01:29] bride. I thought he was going to say
[1:01:31] wife.
[1:01:32] He says our inheritance is what?
[1:01:34] Sunship. Amen.
[1:01:38] To be a son of
[1:01:40] God. Now this may choke you to death.
[1:01:44] Please somebody just check that your
[1:01:45] neighbor's not choking there. Just check
[1:01:47] there
[1:01:49] quickly. Everyone's breathing.
[1:01:52] Okay. Tell them say amen. Let me hear
[1:01:54] you breathe. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] But did you know that men that are sons
[1:02:02] of God, how many of you are ready to be
[1:02:03] choked now? Watch. Don't choke me when
[1:02:05] he's going to tell you this. How many of
[1:02:06] you know that men that are sons of God
[1:02:08] are amateur gods? Amen. Amen. Glory.
[1:02:12] Amen. That's right.
[1:02:14] Amen. How many of you ever know that?
[1:02:17] How many knows that Jesus said so? Jesus
[1:02:20] said, "Did not your law say
[1:02:22] that you are gods?" Amen. Amen. God said
[1:02:26] in Genesis 2 that they were gods because
[1:02:27] they were at full domain over the and
[1:02:30] dominion over the world. He gave him
[1:02:32] dominion over all things and he lost his
[1:02:34] godship. He lost his sunship. He lost
[1:02:37] his domain and Satan took it. But
[1:02:40] brother,
[1:02:41] we are waiting. Amen. For the
[1:02:43] manifestation of the sons of God who
[1:02:46] will come back and take it over again.
[1:02:51] Amen. Didn't he just say it's time and
[1:02:53] season now for us to take it back?
[1:02:54] Hallelujah.
[1:02:56] Praise the Lord. He's going to go on
[1:02:58] now. Amen. We're getting into some nice
[1:03:00] stuff here now. Waiting for the fullness
[1:03:02] of time. Now, every time you hear the
[1:03:04] word fullness of time, he's talking
[1:03:05] about the seventh seal. So, under the
[1:03:07] seventh seal is the right time for the
[1:03:09] sons of God to be manifested.
[1:03:13] Amen. When the pyramid gets up to the
[1:03:16] top,
[1:03:17] are we at the days of poor faith,
[1:03:21] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience?
[1:03:23] Are we where at the top? Yes. Have we
[1:03:25] already established we've been united
[1:03:26] with the headstone. Amen. Amen. So then
[1:03:29] we we know where the property is taking
[1:03:30] us now. When the pyramid gets up to the
[1:03:32] top when the sons full sons of God will
[1:03:36] be manifested. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:39] Hallelujah. I the reason why this
[1:03:41] message is coming across we have too
[1:03:43] many delinquents who don't want to take
[1:03:45] on the responsibility.
[1:03:48] So we're coming to shake you. Amen.
[1:03:51] shake you back to position. Shake you
[1:03:54] back to realization. What is this?
[1:03:56] Thundering voices coming to take away
[1:03:58] the amnesia to put you in your ought to
[1:04:00] be condition.
[1:04:02] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:04:05] Brothers who are rejoicing right now,
[1:04:07] keep rejoicing. Amen. We need to take
[1:04:09] the debt out of the church. Amen. We
[1:04:11] need to take the lukewarmness out of the
[1:04:13] church. Amen. We need to position
[1:04:15] people, Amen. Place them in the ought to
[1:04:17] be condition. People may not like it.
[1:04:20] They want the service to end right now.
[1:04:22] But God is coming to position the
[1:04:23] church. Amen. To let you know you're a
[1:04:25] son and daughter of God.
[1:04:29] God is bringing this thing to a climax.
[1:04:31] And at the climax, we can't have
[1:04:32] wishy-washy people. At the climax, we've
[1:04:35] got to have sons and daughters of God.
[1:04:37] We've got to have a super church. We've
[1:04:39] got to have a super race. We've got to
[1:04:40] have an invincible army. Look at the
[1:04:43] word he's describing. The people at the
[1:04:45] top.
[1:04:47] Oh yes. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:50] Amen.
[1:04:52] Amen.
[1:04:54] We will come and take it over again,
[1:04:56] waiting for the fullness of the time
[1:04:58] when the pyramid gets to the top. When
[1:05:00] full sons of God will be manifested,
[1:05:03] when the power of God will walk out and
[1:05:05] we'll take every power. We'll take
[1:05:08] cancer away. We'll take heart disease
[1:05:10] away. We'll take sugar diabetes away.
[1:05:13] We'll take high blood pressure away.
[1:05:15] We'll take leukemia away. Amen. will
[1:05:17] take lung disease away. We'll take
[1:05:19] kidney trouble away. Take it back from
[1:05:21] the devil.
[1:05:23] Yes.
[1:05:26] Now, when I'm reading this, how many are
[1:05:27] saying, "That's me talking about."
[1:05:30] That's me he's talking about. Amen.
[1:05:34] Amen. Take him down. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:05:36] Take every power that Satan's got away
[1:05:38] from him. Yes, sir. It belongs to him.
[1:05:40] Now, he's talking about in the next, if
[1:05:43] you don't catch it, he goes quickly to
[1:05:45] Melzdc. He's the logos that went out of
[1:05:48] God. That is true. That was the son of
[1:05:50] God. Then he made man that little God.
[1:05:55] Amen.
[1:05:57] Turn to your neighbor. Say, "Call me
[1:05:58] little God." God.
[1:06:02] Yeah. I say certain things, certain ways
[1:06:03] for it to stick in your head. Call me
[1:06:05] little God.
[1:06:09] Amen.
[1:06:11] If they call them who the word of God
[1:06:13] came to. If they call them gods, who the
[1:06:15] word of God came to? When you try that
[1:06:16] day, did the word of God come in
[1:06:18] fullness? Oh yes. Did the word of God
[1:06:19] come to you? And you are gods. Amen. He
[1:06:22] told Moses, "I made you a god, even your
[1:06:25] prophet. I may act like a religious
[1:06:26] crank, but I'm not." When your eyes can
[1:06:29] come open and see those things, he made
[1:06:31] man a god, a god in his domain, and his
[1:06:35] domain goes from sea to sea, shore to
[1:06:37] shore, he has control of it. Amen. Now
[1:06:40] let me just get this misunderstanding
[1:06:42] away. You are not a god a capital G to
[1:06:44] be worshiped.
[1:06:46] You are not a capital G to take glory.
[1:06:49] God is manifesting himself through you.
[1:06:51] So he gets the glory.
[1:06:54] And when Jesus came being the one
[1:06:56] without sin, he proved it. When the
[1:06:59] winds blowed, he said, "Peace be still."
[1:07:01] When the tree said, "No man eat from
[1:07:03] thee." Verily, verily, I say unto you
[1:07:05] that little gods, if you'll say to this
[1:07:07] mountain, be moved and don't doubt in
[1:07:10] your heart. But believe what you have
[1:07:11] said will come to pass, you can have
[1:07:13] what you said. Amen. So I'm saying Mark
[1:07:16] 11:23 is to to be operated by little
[1:07:19] gods. Amen. And have not the Holy Spirit
[1:07:22] been laboring since 2023 to establish
[1:07:24] Mark 20 11:23 in the hearts of the
[1:07:26] people. Amen. To operate as a living as
[1:07:29] a little God. Amen.
[1:07:32] Then I love verse chapter 80 there
[1:07:35] paragraph he says go right back to
[1:07:37] Genesis to the original. What is it?
[1:07:40] Amen. Amen. Not the world. Now the world
[1:07:44] and nature is groaning. Everything
[1:07:45] moving for the manifestation of the sons
[1:07:48] of God. When true sons Yeah. born sons,
[1:07:51] Amen. Amen. Phil sons speak and their
[1:07:55] word is bet. Amen. You have the betting
[1:07:58] of all of heaven. Amen. Be words coming
[1:08:01] out of your mouth. Yes, Lord. The words
[1:08:03] is back. I believe we're on the border
[1:08:05] of it right now. Yes, sir. Say to this
[1:08:08] mountain, yes. Amen. Brother, I desire
[1:08:11] so and so certain thing done. Now,
[1:08:13] watch,
[1:08:15] church, we've got to bring certain
[1:08:16] things to manifestation. And in order to
[1:08:19] do that, we've got to allow Amen. and
[1:08:21] have the confidence in what the word is
[1:08:23] saying about us. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:26] Where you
[1:08:27] going? on your knees.
[1:08:31] Because when we realize God has the
[1:08:32] preeminence in his people,
[1:08:35] it's God in us. Yes. He says, "I go to
[1:08:38] my brother." Yes. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:42] Hallelujah.
[1:08:44] I desire so and so a certain thing
[1:08:49] done. I'm a believer in Jesus Christ.
[1:08:52] Amen. What does the brother say? I give
[1:08:56] it to you. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's the
[1:08:59] title of my sermon. I give it to you.
[1:09:02] Amen.
[1:09:05] Oh yes. Now you can never bring that out
[1:09:07] of me if you never ask me. Amen.
[1:09:13] Thank you, Lord. Come on now.
[1:09:20] God and his people a super sign. Yeah.
[1:09:24] Amen. The word made flesh again in you
[1:09:27] and I. Amen.
[1:09:31] Watch. We always wondering what will the
[1:09:34] manifestation look like. If you ever
[1:09:36] want to bring Romans 8 to pass, this is
[1:09:37] how you bring it to pass. Going to read
[1:09:39] it again. Brother, I desire so and so.
[1:09:43] I'm a believer in Jesus Christ. I give
[1:09:46] it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:47] Christ. He says there's a manifestation.
[1:09:52] Hallelujah. Amen. So the reason there's
[1:09:55] been no
[1:09:57] manifestation, who you think he is? I
[1:09:59] must go ask him. Amen.
[1:10:02] Because if you he say I you feel so
[1:10:04] important.
[1:10:07] Hey, why you don't come ask me? Because
[1:10:10] I want my name to be fleshed in lights.
[1:10:12] Yes. You know, we're living in a carnal
[1:10:14] time. Even in the messy circles, it's my
[1:10:16] church and your church. And who can do
[1:10:19] things greater than the others?
[1:10:20] Nonsense. We are one body. Amen. That's
[1:10:23] why we can't see the power of God move.
[1:10:25] There's division and separation and all
[1:10:27] kinds of things. Amen. We need to get
[1:10:29] rid of that nonsense.
[1:10:32] Amen.
[1:10:34] Yes, sir.
[1:10:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:39] How are we going to bring a
[1:10:40] manifestation? By asking somebody.
[1:10:46] Okay, let me bring it another way.
[1:10:48] You're expecting God to ask you
[1:10:50] something.
[1:10:52] I have need of this. Who has needs? Does
[1:10:56] God have needs or people have needs? Did
[1:10:59] the men laying there asked Peter and
[1:11:00] John? They had a need and then they saw
[1:11:04] a manifestation.
[1:11:06] When are we going to learn this
[1:11:07] principle?
[1:11:09] Brother, pray for me. Pray for me. Well,
[1:11:11] why don't you ask me?
[1:11:16] I told you we were there in Zimbabwe and
[1:11:17] his brother. Amen. after preaching the
[1:11:19] meeting, he said, "Brother, I want you
[1:11:20] to pray because I have this, this,
[1:11:21] this." I said, "Brother, do you want me
[1:11:23] to pray for
[1:11:24] you or do you want me to give it to
[1:11:26] you?" Amen. Look at me shocked now
[1:11:29] because I'm activating another
[1:11:30] anointing. Amen. Another gifting. Amen.
[1:11:34] Amen. We can pray for you. No problem.
[1:11:41] But then it's according to your faith.
[1:11:43] Yes. Yes,
[1:11:46] brother. I have need of this.
[1:11:49] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:53] Brother Caleb, I have need of this job.
[1:11:56] Just uh Amen. Janice, I have need of
[1:11:59] this job.
[1:12:02] Well, I give it to you.
[1:12:06] Some of us may stress and worry. Am I
[1:12:07] going to get it this? But did you hear
[1:12:08] what I said? I give it to you. Amen.
[1:12:14] Oh brother, my crops are burning out up
[1:12:18] yonder. I haven't had any rain. So now
[1:12:21] there's fire and no rain. Yes.
[1:12:24] Who is he going to? Fire brigade. 911.
[1:12:27] What is the emergency? My crops are
[1:12:29] burning up. I need some water. Send
[1:12:31] helicopter support.
[1:12:36] Who's he going to? Hey, I'm talking
[1:12:39] about sons and daughters of God here.
[1:12:41] Yeah.
[1:12:45] Who's going to manifest Romans 8? We in
[1:12:48] severe conditions.
[1:12:51] Fire and no water.
[1:12:54] Praise the Lord. Yes. Amen. Now, you
[1:12:56] can't call the Phoenix Fire Station.
[1:12:57] They don't have water in Phoenix. You
[1:13:00] know, be in
[1:13:01] problem. Amen.
[1:13:08] I'll send you rain. Amen.
[1:13:13] Amen. In the name of the Lord, there
[1:13:16] shall come. Oh, waiting, groaning, all
[1:13:19] nature, waiting for the manifestation of
[1:13:21] the sons of God. God ordained it at the
[1:13:24] beginning. He gave man the domain. I say
[1:13:27] if he gave us a domain, how about we
[1:13:29] take control over the domain? Amen.
[1:13:34] He gave Jesus and Jesus gave it in his
[1:13:37] name. Yes.
[1:13:41] With this assurance, ask the father
[1:13:43] anything in my name and I'll do
[1:13:44] it. Waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:13:47] sons of God, the position, the
[1:13:50] church. As I said, the book of Ephesians
[1:13:52] is the book of Joshua. Now watch, he's
[1:13:54] going to detail something here. Now
[1:13:56] Joshua placing the people where they
[1:13:58] belong. Now, if they won't stand still,
[1:14:00] I think that's been the problem. Yes.
[1:14:03] People don't want to be placed
[1:14:04] positionally. They don't want to stand
[1:14:05] still. He says if they don't want to
[1:14:08] stand still, he put Ephraim over here in
[1:14:11] Manessa's
[1:14:15] land.
[1:14:19] Right. And this one would come back
[1:14:21] fussing and stewing. How are they ever
[1:14:23] going to get along when one saying I'm a
[1:14:25] Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal,
[1:14:26] oneness, tunist, thus and thus? How you
[1:14:29] going to do it? Stand
[1:14:31] still. God is wanting to place his
[1:14:34] church, the sons and daughters of God.
[1:14:39] Now, when a tree is growing, you can't
[1:14:41] take a tree when it's outgrown and go
[1:14:43] plant it somewhere else. Cory Tenboom
[1:14:47] said, "Grow where you are planted." Yes.
[1:14:50] You can't take a plant that's half
[1:14:53] mature, fully mature, and try to replant
[1:14:55] it somewhere else.
[1:14:56] It got accustomed to the environment.
[1:14:58] Yes. Amen. So he's saying God is wanting
[1:15:02] to place his church, the sons and
[1:15:03] daughters of God. God let me live to see
[1:15:06] it is my prayer. So close I can feel it
[1:15:09] with my
[1:15:09] hands. Wait for the time when walk down
[1:15:12] the street. There lays a there
[1:15:15] from his mother's womb. Silver and gold
[1:15:18] have I none. Oh, waiting for the
[1:15:20] manifestation of the sons of God. God
[1:15:23] will make himself known. Now watch when
[1:15:26] they'll stop sickness.
[1:15:28] Amen.
[1:15:31] They'll stop cancer. Yes. They'll stop
[1:15:34] diseases. Amen.
[1:15:37] Yes.
[1:15:41] Who will be making themselves known?
[1:15:43] God. Yes. Somebody say after me, God
[1:15:45] will make himself known.
[1:15:48] And I'll stop sickness. I'll stop sick.
[1:15:50] I'll stop cancer. I'll stop cancer. I'll
[1:15:52] stop diseases.
[1:15:54] That's what we are striving for now to
[1:15:57] get in and be positionally placed into
[1:15:59] the kingdom of God before these horrible
[1:16:02] plague strike. Oh God, the dispensation
[1:16:04] of time, fullness of time, the
[1:16:10] inheritance. So what are we saying? We
[1:16:13] need to stop proclaiming we
[1:16:15] adopted because an adopted son writes
[1:16:18] checks like his father. Yes. So I'm
[1:16:20] saying let me see you write a check for
[1:16:21] me. Yes. So I'm saying the adopted son
[1:16:24] fired who he fires and he hires who he
[1:16:27] hires. He starts to operate like his
[1:16:30] father. His word is as good as the
[1:16:32] fathers.
[1:16:34] Yes sir. So I'm saying let's move past
[1:16:36] the adoption ceremony. Let's get into
[1:16:39] operation of the word. Amen. Let's get
[1:16:41] into manifestation of things. Amen.
[1:16:44] Thank you Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:52] I want to get to the next uh thing
[1:16:54] there. But in paragraph 37, the next
[1:16:56] quote, but I want to drop down to
[1:16:57] paragraph 37 there. Right. He says,
[1:17:01] "Jesus proved he was the right kind of
[1:17:03] son. God took him up on the mountain.
[1:17:05] His garment shined. Supernatural thing."
[1:17:08] Yes. Right. He says, "That's the thing
[1:17:10] that God wants to do to his sons here on
[1:17:12] earth someday. He will call you aside,
[1:17:14] church." I say this morning, he's
[1:17:16] calling you aside. Yes. Amen.
[1:17:19] If you'll obey him and stay on the word
[1:17:21] and believe it, he will place into the
[1:17:23] church before the coming of Jesus. He
[1:17:26] will place into the church all the
[1:17:28] powers that Christ had in him will be in
[1:17:30] the church. Amen. Yes.
[1:17:34] Thank you. All that was God, he poured
[1:17:36] into Jesus. All that was Jesus, he
[1:17:38] poured into the church. God wanting his
[1:17:40] work done, he sent it to his son. God
[1:17:43] wanting the work done, sent him to his
[1:17:45] church. At that day, you'll know I'm in
[1:17:47] the father, the father in me, I in you,
[1:17:49] you in me. At that day, because the same
[1:17:51] power of God was in Jehovah God that
[1:17:54] rested in Jesus Christ, the same power
[1:17:56] that rested in Jesus Christ rest in the
[1:17:58] place sons and sons in the body of
[1:18:02] Christ. Amen. Same power. Amen. The same
[1:18:06] power that laid in the Lord Jesus lays
[1:18:07] in you. Amen. Praise the Lord. In the
[1:18:11] next paragraph there, he says, "There'll
[1:18:12] be a power put into the church." Amen.
[1:18:15] Amen. Yes. There'll be a power put into
[1:18:18] the church. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Let's
[1:18:22] move uh to the next slide. Maybe it's
[1:18:24] there. Amen. Praise the
[1:18:27] Lord. There'll be a power put into the
[1:18:30] church and now is coming in that the
[1:18:34] Holy Spirit.
[1:18:37] Okay, we're closing now. Pay attention
[1:18:38] to this. Amen. A power put into the
[1:18:41] church. The Holy Spirit will so anoint
[1:18:44] the people till they speak the word and
[1:18:48] it'll create itself right there. Amen.
[1:18:50] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Yes, Lord. Amen.
[1:18:53] Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, it will create
[1:18:55] itself.
