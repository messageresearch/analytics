[1:48] amen praise the
[1:52] Lord Luke chapter 1
[2:00] amen we'll read from verse 26 and in the
[2:03] sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent
[2:06] from
[2:09] God unto a city of Galilee named
[2:12] Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a
[2:16] man whose name was Joseph of the House
[2:19] of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[2:22] and the angel came in unto
[2:24] her and said
[2:26] hail is this thing on maybe take this
[2:29] people off
[2:31] yeah feed back amen and the angel came
[2:35] in unto her and said hail Thou Art
[2:38] highly favored the Lord is with thee
[2:41] blessed art thou among
[2:43] women and when she saw him she was
[2:46] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[2:48] mind what manner of salutation this
[2:50] should
[2:52] be and the angel said unto her fear not
[2:54] Mary for thou has found favor with
[2:57] God and behold Thou shalt conceive in
[3:00] thy womb and bring forth a son and shall
[3:03] call his name
[3:05] Jesus and he shall be great and shall be
[3:08] called the son of the highest and the
[3:11] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[3:14] of his father David and he shall reign
[3:16] over the house of Jacob
[3:18] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[3:21] be no end then said Mary unto the angel
[3:25] how shall this
[3:26] be seeing I know not a man and the angel
[3:30] answered and said unto her the Holy
[3:33] Ghost shall come upon
[3:35] thee and the power of the high shall
[3:38] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[3:41] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[3:43] be called the son of Goden behold th
[3:46] cousin Elizabeth she had also conceived
[3:50] a son in her old age this is a six month
[3:52] with her which is called Baron for with
[3:56] God nothing shall be impossible and Mary
[3:58] said behold the ID of the Lord be it
[4:00] unto me according to Thy word and the
[4:03] angel departed from her amen may be
[4:05] seated the Lord had blessings the
[4:06] reading of his
[4:08] word amen go to Galatians Chapter
[4:12] 5 Verse
[4:15] 22
[4:18] amen Galatians 5:22 says but the fruit
[4:22] of the spirit is love joy peace
[4:28] longsuffering gentle
[4:30] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[4:35] against such there is no law amen praise
[4:39] the Lord amen now we would know that
[4:43] when we talk about a
[4:44] fruit fruit doesn't just come
[4:47] about there must be a seed amen so if
[4:50] there's a fruit of the spirit there must
[4:53] be seed of the
[4:55] spirit amen hallelujah amen and that's
[5:00] what we are focusing on has the seed of
[5:02] the spirit been swn into our
[5:07] souls
[5:09] amen so we have lots of privileges being
[5:14] in the message of the
[5:16] hour we as the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[5:19] Christ are living Amen in our Privileges
[5:22] and to live beneath our privileges is to
[5:25] not embrace the truths that has been
[5:27] revealed to us under the message of the
[5:30] amen through the prophetic gift of
[5:32] William Mary and brandom am amen he was
[5:35] the Elijah Prophet spoken of in Malachi
[5:38] 4:5 and 6 to turn our hearts back to the
[5:41] faith of the fathers he was also the
[5:43] seven Church age messenger sent to the
[5:46] lestans in Revelation 3:14 amen and he
[5:49] was the seventh angel in Revelation 10:7
[5:52] who was to sound a trumpet message
[5:54] revealing the mysteries of God now one
[5:56] would ask what was the mysteries of God
[5:59] very Brandon will sum it up in this NE
[6:01] in this quote he says now watch in the
[6:03] seven Church age when the seventh angel
[6:05] begins to sound the mysteries of God was
[6:08] to be made known right there and he says
[6:10] the
[6:13] seals so the mysteries of God is in the
[6:16] seals it's contained in the
[6:18] seals amen
[6:21] hallelujah and he goes to the next one
[6:23] and he says we're going to use like a
[6:26] little Sunday school lesson now it's not
[6:28] directed to anything any certain persons
[6:30] just to the church the body of Christ
[6:33] that we're trying to lead to deeper
[6:35] thoughts and higher objectives amen so
[6:38] that's what the message of the hour came
[6:39] to do to lead us to deeper thoughts and
[6:42] higher objectives amen if we take amen
[6:46] just Mary herself here and we're looking
[6:48] at her life the angel came to lead her
[6:51] to higher thoughts amen deeper thoughts
[6:54] and higher objectives notice the mind of
[6:57] Christ was not withheld from me
[7:01] amen he told her everything that was
[7:04] going to happen and there was a dialogue
[7:06] happening between the angel and
[7:09] Mary the same way there's got to be a
[7:12] dialogue between the Angel and the Bride
[7:14] of Jesus Christ now there has to be a
[7:16] connection with the
[7:17] supernatural amen hallelujah he has come
[7:20] to lead us into deeper thoughts and
[7:22] higher objectives amen notice we read in
[7:26] Luke chapter 1 amen the angel coming to
[7:29] Mary also reveals to her about the
[7:32] Forerunner yes sir which church in the
[7:35] end time which Bride of the last days as
[7:37] knowledge of the Forerunner amen amen he
[7:40] not only reveals to you he's going to
[7:42] overshadow you and you are going to
[7:43] bring forth the Life of Christ but he's
[7:46] also told you about the
[7:48] Forerunner amen didn't the angel tell
[7:51] Mary your cousin Elizabeth is going to
[7:53] bring forth the Forerunner yes oh yes so
[7:56] nothing is with from this bride
[7:58] therefore the bride of Christ can see
[8:00] the messenger of the last days amen so
[8:03] to not allow the message of the hour to
[8:05] have its full effect in our life is to
[8:07] live beneath our
[8:09] privilege we can hear about the message
[8:11] of the hour we can sympathize with the
[8:13] message of the hour but not to let it
[8:15] have its full effect is not to live is
[8:17] to live beneath our privilege to come to
[8:19] church out of religion is to live
[8:21] beneath our privilege Amen to live a dry
[8:25] Barren dead life without the baptism of
[8:28] the Holy Ghost is to live beneath our
[8:31] privilege amen hallelujah to live in a
[8:34] world act like a world act like the
[8:36] world Amen have Ambitions like the world
[8:39] flat like the
[8:40] world Amen is to live beneath our
[8:44] privileges to chase after women to chase
[8:48] after men Amen to chase after
[8:51] popularity and fame and desire of
[8:54] Friendship with the world is to live
[8:55] beneath our
[8:57] privileges Lord these are not things to
[8:59] be Amen to Rejoice about to indulge in
[9:02] and to be happy about but that is the
[9:04] bride is living under privileges when
[9:06] she partakes of those things amen amen
[9:10] to chase after money and riches in this
[9:13] life dedicate our time and efforts to
[9:15] make our life more comfortable here in
[9:18] the cycle of 70 years amen is to live
[9:21] beneath our
[9:22] privileges God has opened up so much
[9:24] more to us than to worry about a
[9:26] temporal
[9:28] benefits people focus on the stock
[9:30] markets people amen might spend hour by
[9:32] hour chasing amen cryptocurrencies and

[11:10] telling us you can't serve God and
[11:12] Mammon amen neither can you serve God
[11:15] and and Elevate woman to a place of
[11:18] Godlike status in your
[11:20] life amen men ought to grow a

[11:34] hallelujah
[11:36] amen
[11:38] hallelujah
[11:40] amen men are men are supposed to be
[11:43] raised in a family where they are taught
[11:45] that they are going to be the head of
[11:47] the home leading the home in spiritual
[11:50] things you can't be a
[11:53] jellyfish you got to have a backbone
[11:56] which means you got to know the word
[11:58] amen thank you Lord amen yes don't look
[12:01] at a pretty set of
[12:03] eyes that's what happened to Samson yes
[12:07] Delilah stripped him of his
[12:10] power and if you are not careful a woman
[12:13] can strip you of your
[12:15] power a woman can strip you off your
[12:18] calling the pr of God says amen that he
[12:21] deceived she deceived Samson by
[12:24] flatteries
[12:26] yes show me your strength show show me
[12:29] your
[12:31] power and don't think you are being
[12:33] loving when you revealing your
[12:36] secret you are striping yourself of
[12:39] power if you go and read uh the the
[12:42] message of deceived Church by the world
[12:43] the prophet is teaching you how the
[12:45] church lost its power and how to regain
[12:48] it he tells you the first time she tied
[12:51] his
[12:52] hands he broke those bands and he says
[12:56] Luther came
[12:57] forth breaking the B of the Catholic
[13:00] church amen he says the second time she
[13:03] tied his hands Wesley came forth and
[13:06] broke those
[13:08] bands the third time amen he says the
[13:11] Pentecostal church was supposed to break
[13:13] those
[13:17] bands
[13:19] amen but because she settled for the
[13:22] sides of
[13:26] Jordan the side the banks of Jordan
[13:30] because they settled for the banks of
[13:34] Jordan got dispossessed of power and
[13:38] what happened Samson lost his eyes and
[13:41] we know the eyes of the church is the
[13:44] prophet so when the prophet was taken
[13:47] off the scene that's the state the
[13:49] church is
[13:50] in a people without a prophetic gift in
[13:53] the land right so the bride was found in
[13:57] a lukewarm condition
[14:00] blind wretched miserable being led
[14:04] around the place and going to be M of
[14:08] but brother BR says thank God for a new
[14:11] luck of ha That
[14:12] Grew thank God for a new luck in the end
[14:15] time thank God for people are not
[14:17] settling for religion amen amen but want
[14:20] to see the Promise fulfilled in their
[14:22] own
[14:23] life praise the Lord amen amen a new
[14:27] lock a fresh
[14:29] anting amen hallelujah and he was what
[14:32] what did he call he called a young
[14:35] boy amen hallelujah he needed a fful
[14:39] Ministry Amen to lead him to be the
[14:42] eyesight in this
[14:43] hour praise the Lord because the
[14:45] prophetic gift had gone eyes were
[14:49] gone so he needed to be in the mind age
[14:52] after the eyes comes the mind so the
[14:55] bride has the mind of Christ she knows
[14:58] what he wants done with the word and
[14:59] Samson knew his greatest defeat amen his
[15:02] greatest victory was going to be right
[15:05] there even though he looked like amen
[15:07] Dark
[15:09] Void without form without shape that's
[15:12] exactly the condition Genesis 1 opens
[15:15] with showing you a latery and
[15:18] condition and that's what Zechariah 4
[15:21] says amen that amen gross Darkness shall
[15:23] cover the Earth the people but there
[15:25] shall be light in the evening time amen
[15:28] amen light has come in the evening time
[15:31] and God spoke in the beginning let there
[15:33] be light thank you Lord amen don't
[15:35] accept any dark situation in your life
[15:38] you speak light over your situation you
[15:40] speak light over your
[15:43] circumstance we have not been called
[15:45] Amen to be a people without without hope
[15:47] without power amen we have not been
[15:49] called a people to be
[15:51] powerless this ought to be the Church of
[15:53] the Living God Amen where the power of
[15:55] God flows freely amen
[15:59] amen so we are saying let us not live
[16:02] beneath our privileges but everything
[16:04] that is being opened up to us let us
[16:06] live in the glory of that
[16:09] amen amen to to have a casual approach
[16:12] to the message of the hour is to live
[16:15] beneath our privileges to come to church
[16:17] and sit dead as a door nail is to live
[16:20] beneath our privileges brother BR in
[16:22] that same message says some people come
[16:23] to church they got no Victory they come
[16:26] inside they go outside amen they come in
[16:29] amen without a shout of praise and they
[16:31] go out without a shout of Praise amen
[16:34] but he says amen a Holy Ghost full
[16:36] person can't help but praise the Lord
[16:38] amen when the songs are being sung they
[16:41] involved in the worship amen amen when
[16:43] the word is being preached they amen the
[16:45] word of God thank you Lord yes amen
[16:48] hallelujah glory amen amen no praise
[16:53] sometimes no Hallelujah no joy no amen
[16:57] no fruit of the spirit
[17:00] now you can't get a mango without you
[17:02] having a mango
[17:05] seed so you can't tell me you got the
[17:07] fruit of the spirit without the seed of
[17:09] the spirit amen praise the Lord Lord
[17:15] hallelujah now like we are saying for
[17:18] there to be fruit there must be seed yes
[17:20] but we are living in a time like never
[17:23] before yes now you have fruit without
[17:26] seed
[17:30] right they have seedless
[17:33] grapes that's not the kind of fruit of
[17:36] spirit I
[17:40] want we don't want a seedless Holy
[17:44] Ghost
[17:46] amenl hallelujah amen for for there to
[17:50] be fruit there must be seed if there is
[17:52] no seed it means it's I
[17:55] bread praise the Lord amen seedless
[17:59] fruit genetically modified in a lab
[18:02] anything that anything ibrid cannot
[18:04] reproduce itself we have lots of hybrid
[18:07] fruits in our stores no seed in there
[18:11] that's a sign it was amen developed in a
[18:14] lab it's hybrid and there's no or very
[18:18] little nutritional value to it and and
[18:22] some people like seedless
[18:25] grapes oh I don't like when I'm eating I
[18:27] don't like to bite the seed some people
[18:29] love seedless grapes some people love
[18:32] seedless
[18:33] fruit and some people like boneless
[18:37] meat you go to a restaurant I like a
[18:40] deboned Roy Curry mutton Curry they
[18:44] don't want the
[18:45] bone yeah we serve

[18:57] hallelujah amen amen praise the
[19:01] lord we like the bones amen amen we like
[19:04] the marrow bone some of you call it

[19:10] Lord why amen you like the suul
[19:14] succulent juice of the
[19:15] word praise the Lord I know I'm making

[19:21] you amen we can't have a seedless Holy
[19:26] Ghost come on church we can't be showing
[19:29] then then we are showing manifestations
[19:31] that are not that are
[19:32] hybrid that's why brother Brandon was
[19:34] against Sensations and just jumping and
[19:37] shouting and just emotions and all of
[19:39] these things because that is showing
[19:41] amen amen the fruits of something with
[19:44] no seed in there right and I'm telling
[19:47] you it's the only time in age where we
[19:48] have seedless fruit right because there
[19:52] science has
[19:54] progressed people get less dependent
[19:57] upon God right
[20:01] you watch somebody gets struck with
[20:02] illness the first thing they want to do
[20:04] is run to the doctor and they forget
[20:06] about Dr Jesus they forget about the
[20:08] power that's been released to the
[20:10] church the Bible says call the Elders of
[20:13] the church amen go read that scripture
[20:16] yes sir if any is
[20:17] sick amen among you call the doctor amen
[20:22] does he say that he says call the Elders
[20:23] of the church let them anoint you with
[20:26] oil let them pray over you but what we
[20:29] amen we we depend more on Medical Aid
[20:32] than Miracle Aid yes amen hallelujah
[20:36] thank you Lord we depend more when our
[20:38] finances run low we don't go to Gyra we
[20:41] go to some loan
[20:42] shark we go to some person amen we go
[20:45] Amen to the bank we go on overdraft we
[20:48] go to credit cards why Sciences
[20:51] increased to make life more easy for you
[20:53] so that you don't depend on your
[20:55] original Source ever oh yes
[20:59] ABA is source of healing ABA is source
[21:01] of finances ABA is source of peace amen
[21:04] don't run to a psychologist run to Jesus
[21:07] amen yes thank you Lord thank you Lord
[21:11] praise the Lord so God hates
[21:15] hybriding
[21:17] amen now as much as scientist tapped
[21:19] into God's laboratory like the prophet
[21:22] would tell us they also have tapped into
[21:24] Satan's
[21:25] laboratory science and progress
[21:28] everything is
[21:29] artificial and they celebrate artificial
[21:32] stuff yes amen that's right now they
[21:37] have artificial
[21:38] sweetness and artificial colorance and
[21:41] artificial this and artificial that so
[21:43] much so the man is now G gearing up to
[21:46] rely on artificial
[21:50] intelligence man is glorifying something
[21:53] that's artificial and they have failed
[21:55] because Satan doesn't want them to
[21:57] realize they were created in the image
[21:59] of God amen amen so he's trying to
[22:02] present to them something artificial man
[22:05] thinks they need something artificial to
[22:06] assist man but God sent the genuine Holy
[22:09] Ghost to assist man and they don't want
[22:12] the genuine intelligence they want an
[22:14] artificial
[22:17] intelligence right the seed of the
[22:19] spirit is the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah
[22:24] so God eates anything that's hybrid God
[22:26] EES hybrid religion or water down
[22:28] religion God hat a seedless fruit of the
[22:31] spirit a bunch of carrying on based on
[22:33] emotions amen dry out confessions and
[22:37] and crucifying of the spirit amen They
[22:39] Crucified the son when he came in the
[22:42] flesh yes they crucified the word when
[22:45] it was revealed now they're crucifying
[22:47] the spirit when it is sent to the
[22:49] church

[23:02] Ghost In My Flesh I feel good I got the
[23:05] holy ghost in my spirit not good enough

[23:32] Daughters amen a new birth the baptism
[23:35] of the Holy Ghost but people don't want

[23:43] message values of the message they want
[23:46] morals of the message they

[23:50] message you can impersonate being a
[23:53] message believer you can have all the
[23:55] outward motions and manifestations of a
[23:57] message believer but unless that se Gene
[23:59] of God that has been quickened by the
[24:01] Holy Ghost you will never have a
[24:03] resurrection amen right because the
[24:06] Bible says if the Same Spirit now now
[24:08] now this is a sobering thought the
[24:11] spirit that lived in Jesus yes is the
[24:14] Holy Ghost the Bible says if that same
[24:16] Spirit yes that raised Jesus from the
[24:19] dead dwells in

[25:08] Believer Same Spirit that anointed him
[25:12] on the
[25:13] Jordan amen he coming upon the believer
[25:17] Same Spirit not another spirit amen oh
[25:21] what Eternal value that is yes amen
[25:24] praise the Lord amen so we don't want to

[25:35] what happened to Jesus will happen to
[25:37] you amen the Holy Spirit quickened Jesus
[25:39] mortal body it will also Quicken your
[25:41] mortal body amen amen thank you Lord you
[25:45] what the prophet of God is saying now in
[25:47] the church age book resume of the church
[25:49] ages he says this age started just after
[25:52] the turn of the 20th century as it was
[25:55] to be the age in which the true church
[25:57] would return now get this it's supposed
[26:00] to be the age in which the true church
[26:02] would return to being the bride she was
[26:05] at Pentecost amen yes we know that there
[26:10] must of necessity be a return of dynamic
[26:14] power
[26:15] hallelujah thank you Lord we are not
[26:18] hoping for that we are not wishing for
[26:20] that brother Bram uses the word
[26:23] must there must be a return of dynamic
[26:27] power
[26:29] Hallelujah the Believers sensed this in
[26:32] their spirits and began crying to God
[26:34] for a new outpouring such as was in the
[26:36] first century what seemed to be the
[26:39] answer came as many began to speak in
[26:43] tongues right and manifest gifts of the
[26:45] Spirit you see that's what I'm talking
[26:47] about living on the banks of Jordan they
[26:49] came across Jordan but when you cross
[26:51] any River you must come to the bank of a
[26:54] river come on
[26:57] somebody and living on the banks of
[26:59] Jordan they started to speak in
[27:01] tongues and they settled on the sides of
[27:04] on the banks of Jordan but we don't want
[27:06] to settle on the banks of Jordan we want
[27:09] to go into the land and possess the land
[27:11] amen we want to possess all that
[27:13] rightfully belongs to ours am and God is
[27:16] releasing it to the church little by
[27:18] little because the land is is full of
[27:21] inhabitants and that's why you find
[27:23] going into a higher dimensions of the
[27:24] Holy Ghost the Lord is releasing it to
[27:26] us little by little
[27:28] amen thank you Lord praise the
[27:34] Lord he says amen so don't live on the
[27:36] banks of
[27:39] Jordan don't be happy that you just
[27:41] crossed over
[27:42] Jordan and don't just dwell on the banks
[27:44] of
[27:46] Jordan it was then believed that this
[27:49] was indeed the long awaited restoration
[27:51] it was
[27:52] not for the latter rain came can only
[27:55] come after the former rain very
[27:57] important
[27:58] now the latter rain can come after the
[28:03] former rain which is the spring or
[28:04] teaching rain the latter rain then is
[28:06] the Harvest rain how could this be the
[28:08] real when the teaching rain had not come
[28:11] the prophet messenger who was to be sent
[28:13] to teach the people and turn the hearts
[28:15] of the children back to the Pentecostal
[28:17] fathers had not yet
[28:21] come thus what was thought to be the
[28:23] restoration and final quickening unto
[28:25] the Rapture had not come
[28:28] in it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[28:30] partaking of spiritual blessing and
[28:33] manifesting in the Holy Ghost now what
[28:35] your brother Brandon brings up you would
[28:37] think that partaking of the spiritual
[28:38] blessing and manifesting in the Holy
[28:40] Ghost is a good thing but he is saying
[28:43] the unrighteous partaking of
[28:46] it
[28:49] right in the Holy Ghost as we have kept
[28:52] pointing out to
[28:53] you in it also was the devil power
[28:58] as men were under control of devils now
[29:01] he's not talking about uh other
[29:03] religions
[29:05] yet he's talking about the church under
[29:08] the control of devils yet no one seemed
[29:10] to realize it I I tell you some church
[29:14] is under the control of demon powers
[29:16] yeah in the message right but we
[29:18] recognize it
[29:22] amen then to prove that it was not real
[29:25] these people even before a second
[29:28] generation that appeared organized wrote
[29:30] their unscriptural doctrines and built
[29:32] their own fences as every other group
[29:34] ahead of them that sounds so familiar to
[29:37] me people build fences wrote their own
[29:40] doctrines sent it out organized
[29:44] it amen you get two Jesus
[29:47] doctrines amen you get polygamy
[29:50] doctrines amen you get people that just
[29:54] go off on one tangent of the
[29:56] word praise the Lord now I'm getting to
[29:58] a point here now to show you that the
[30:01] teaching alone is not the only thing
[30:06] required so the prophet had to come with
[30:08] the teaching we just established that
[30:09] now right the early Pentecostals thought
[30:12] they had it but they had to wait for
[30:14] Malachi 4:5 and 6 they had to wait for
[30:16] Revelation 10:7 that's what the court
[30:18] just established now we want to see
[30:20] something here he says preaching usually
[30:23] catches The
[30:24] Sinner brings him under condemnation by
[30:27] the word but teaching places the man
[30:30] positionally what he is am and we can
[30:34] never rightly be able to have faith
[30:36] until positionally we know what we
[30:40] are now for a long time we've been
[30:43] rejoicing under the teaching
[30:45] Reign teaching of the word is the
[30:50] mechanics follow me now am teaching of
[30:53] the word is the mechanics it places you
[30:55] positionally to know that you are a son
[30:57] and daughter of God it teaches us the
[30:59] promises of our age and what we are
[31:01] supposed to be but it is not supposed to
[31:04] just remain a teaching oh yes some of
[31:07] you going to University you are getting
[31:09] the teaching of what's required for you
[31:11] to become that that
[31:13] profession but the teaching is not good
[31:19] enough we have the best of teachers in
[31:21] the message of the hour God ordained
[31:23] gifts we love and appreciate these men
[31:25] of God but we can't stay at teaching
[31:28] Al once you know who you are what you
[31:31] are called
[31:33] for once you
[31:36] graduate there's got to be a spark of
[31:38] Life come over that teaching to make it
[31:42] live the dynamic power coming to the
[31:44] word to make it live and bring you to a
[31:46] fully adopted
[31:48] son being a coworker with the Holy
[31:52] Spirit and taking care of father's
[31:54] business stop showing everyone your ring
[31:58] M stop showing everyone your
[32:01] rope stop telling everyone how the
[32:03] father kissed you and take care of
[32:06] father's business
[32:09] am hallelujah amen stop telling everyone
[32:13] who you are who you are going around
[32:16] telling everyone when the bride
[32:18] recognizes who she is how about you
[32:19] start to live in who you
[32:21] [Music]
[32:22] are
[32:25] amen teaching can only take you so far
[32:30] right amen hallelujah it's time to take
[32:34] control of Father's
[32:36] Kingdom the father did not send the
[32:38] tutor the Holy Spirit to you for nothing
[32:42] the father was a responsible father he
[32:44] didn't send the tutu to you for nothing
[32:47] the tut is the holy
[32:48] spirit amen he knew what you needed to
[32:51] come to full position amen so that you
[32:53] can handle father's business now I got
[32:56] good news for you you didn't come and be
[32:59] born again and saved to escape the
[33:04] Earth Lord as soon as I become a
[33:06] Christian Lord take me away no Our
[33:09] Father who are in heaven Hallowed Be
[33:11] Your Name Your Kingdom come thank you
[33:13] Lord bring your kingdom on
[33:16] Earth let God wants you to manifest his
[33:19] kingdom life on the earth amen that's
[33:22] why he sent the Holy Ghost you looking
[33:24] to run away from the earth you're
[33:26] looking to run away from respons
[33:27] abilities that's been placed in your
[33:31] hands
[33:34] amen somebody who can handle father's
[33:37] business so he send the spirit of his
[33:38] sons the tutor the guide to you his son
[33:41] and
[33:42] daughter to mold you into his image and
[33:45] likeness and he placed you under his
[33:47] syllabus the conduct order and doctrine
[33:50] of the message of the hour
[33:53] amen now I'm going to back up what I'm
[33:56] saying in uh in the next quote seven
[33:58] Church ages he says and in preaching now
[34:01] there is some people that are
[34:03] preachers they can pick up the word with
[34:07] inspiration and swayed out there in
[34:09] places that's watering the seeds that
[34:13] the teacher has
[34:15] taught so we've had the teaching
[34:18] ring we've had great teachers in the
[34:20] message establish the truths
[34:22] positionally place the people where they
[34:24] are but what we need is preachers of the
[34:26] Holy Spirit that can pick up the spirit
[34:29] amen and water the seeds that's been
[34:32] taught amen I if you're getting it
[34:36] that's watering the seeds that the
[34:38] teacher has taught see you've got to put
[34:40] some seed in first then water
[34:45] it oh I just love the teaching of the
[34:47] word some people are ever learning and
[34:51] never able to come to the knowledge of
[34:52] the truth yes amen yes they are leading
[34:55] the people in a de walk in a Wilderness
[34:59] renowned names men who who claim to be
[35:01] eight angels are leading people down
[35:03] dead
[35:07] traps yeah the Bible says no man knowe
[35:10] the day or the hour but these men are so
[35:12] bold to put dates to
[35:14] things and even go to statements like
[35:17] the Holy Ghost has left the
[35:19] Earth then they come around now
[35:21] realizing that it's not so because they
[35:23] missed the date they come around the
[35:24] Lord delayed he's coming
[35:28] let me tell you something that scripture
[35:30] alone condemns them because the Lord is
[35:33] saying a wicked and adulterous person
[35:36] will say the Lord delayed is coming
[35:41] right Jesus said that that it's a wicked
[35:44] person that will say the Lord delayed he
[35:46] coming go read your Bible
[35:51] yes in the context of that of that of
[35:54] that line the Lord delayed it's coming
[35:56] Jesus is saying it's a it's a wicked
[35:58] person that will say the Lord delayed he
[36:01] coming now because they said the Holy
[36:03] Ghost left the Earth they're saying now
[36:04] the Lord delayed is coming Lord delayed
[36:11] nothing you
[36:13] must located the word you dislocated the
[36:17] word hallelujah amen why yeah still
[36:21] trying to teach the
[36:24] people they can't keep the People by the
[36:26] word so they go keep presenting new
[36:28] things new
[36:30] things now I'm hearing amen the latest
[36:33] one they're saying we are going to stop
[36:35] the holy ghost from going over to the
[36:36] Jews we are keeping the Holy Ghost what
[36:41] nonsense you can't stop
[36:43] nothing that's right why to cover up a
[36:46] false
[36:48] teaching we will stop the holy ghost
[36:50] from crossing over to the Jews we
[36:52] keeping the Holy
[36:54] Ghost the Lord helped people and the
[36:58] Lord help us not to get caught up that's
[37:00] right right so let's follow now you got
[37:02] to put some seed in first then water it
[37:04] and the watering comes from the
[37:06] preaching of the
[37:09] word so watch that Spirit now that's
[37:11] coming people are saying we just need
[37:14] the opening of the word we just need the
[37:16] teaching of the word we just need to be
[37:19] taught more what is brother gram saying
[37:22] you need to water what you being taught
[37:25] yes how long you going to be in school
[37:28] how long are you going to be in
[37:31] University how long a normal degree is
[37:33] four years after that you must leave the
[37:38] university some people fail purposely so
[37:41] they can stay another
[37:43] year then some go on to be become
[37:46] academics some go on for their honors
[37:49] some go on for their doctorates I don't
[37:51] know what's uh then I don't know these
[37:53] things maybe
[37:54] PhD they keep studying and studying and
[37:57] studying
[37:58] they never
[38:00] work then they themselves who never went
[38:04] say they were studying to become a
[38:08] engineer not one day in their life did
[38:10] they go and fix anything or do anything
[38:15] but now they become the lecturer in the
[38:16] University why they got the
[38:19] PHD hey they got this thing now they
[38:22] teaching all the other people how to do
[38:24] things but they never fixed an engine in
[38:26] their life
[38:29] amen amen we have Brilliant Minds in the
[38:33] message telling you about the third pole
[38:35] and how it
[38:37] operates and how they disregard the
[38:39] first and second
[38:41] pole and telling you about the the
[38:43] teaching of the word but they never
[38:45] prayed for one person that person got
[38:48] healed that's
[38:50] right so to
[38:52] hide the power of God not moving through
[38:55] them
[38:59] they condemn everybody else where the
[39:00] spirit of God is
[39:02] moving yeah you'll find the spirits
[39:04] you'll hear them making
[39:05] comments amen praise the Lord amen so
[39:08] we've got to uh do we finish see let's
[39:12] see now there's a great vast difference
[39:14] between a teacher and a
[39:16] preacher
[39:18] right right see it's two different gifts
[39:21] of the Spirit all together two different
[39:24] gifts amen and H say say this the
[39:28] prophet really I haven't a gift of
[39:32] either so he is telling you there's a
[39:34] different gift between a teacher and a
[39:37] preacher I say the Lord raise up
[39:39] preachers amen amen amen so we have got
[39:44] to appreciate and realize what we have
[39:46] in the form of the opening of the word
[39:48] we know that the teaching is vitally
[39:50] important to place a Believer
[39:52] positionally to know who we are to take
[39:54] away Amnesia to restore the bride back
[39:57] to
[39:57] condition a church operating under the
[39:59] power of the Holy Ghost now we know that
[40:02] God started the church the way he wanted
[40:04] it now God wants the church the way he
[40:06] started it amen amen praise the Lord and
[40:10] the church we know started on the day of
[40:12] Pentecost full of power the disciples
[40:15] have been walking with the word for 3
[40:16] and 1 half years Hallelujah they which
[40:18] means they had the teaching of the word
[40:21] but the word was crucified and
[40:22] resurrected for a purpose Christ wanted
[40:25] to have the preeminence in those
[40:26] disciples
[40:28] amen not just to be with them but to be
[40:31] in them Glory yes so he went back amen
[40:34] he went back Amen to heaven and he sent
[40:38] back his Spirit on the day of Pentecost
[40:40] now if you read I don't have time to
[40:41] read it now for multiple reasons amen I
[40:44] know you're uncomfortable with the
[40:45] weather but if you read Acts chapter 2
[40:47] there was no ordinary
[40:50] event amen praise the
[40:54] Lord but now we find amen that this was
[40:57] a promise of the scripture Joel had
[40:59] prophesied about it so which means this
[41:01] was a fulfillment of scripture
[41:03] Hallelujah the spirit of God was coming
[41:05] to dwell in The Souls of men amen amen
[41:08] that was God's original design and
[41:09] purpose for man that God would send his
[41:12] spirit that would live in man now how
[41:14] many of you know Redemption is not
[41:15] bringing something new come on walk with
[41:18] me or close now Redemption is not to
[41:21] bring something new so the coming of the
[41:23] Holy Spirit was not something
[41:26] new amen Redemption means to bring you
[41:29] back to your original condition am which
[41:32] means man's original Spirit was the Holy
[41:35] Spirit man's original Spirit was the
[41:38] Holy Ghost In The Garden of heeden God
[41:41] was not presenting something new on the
[41:42] day of
[41:45] Pentecost to redeem means to bring you
[41:48] back to your original
[41:50] condition so now we know why hadam was
[41:52] able to operate and speak to mountains
[41:54] and speak to the winds and speak to the
[41:56] waves and speak amen
[41:59] things because the original Spirit the
[42:02] holy spirit tabernacled in Adam amen
[42:05] amen thank you I'm saying it again the
[42:09] holy ghost coming on the day of
[42:11] Pentecost was not something new added to
[42:13] Redemption yes because the very word
[42:15] Redemption means to bring you back to
[42:17] your original condition from what you
[42:20] fell
[42:22] Allelujah thank you Lord so that's why
[42:24] I'm saying it was no ordinary event that
[42:26] was original Spirit coming back to the
[42:29] church praise the Lord that was a
[42:32] promise of scripture that's what Joel
[42:33] prophesied about amen this was God's
[42:37] original design and purpose for man amen
[42:39] so that the spirit could live in man
[42:41] Redemption is not doing something new
[42:43] amen but to bring it back to its
[42:44] original condition its original position
[42:48] am praise the Lord thank you Lord the
[42:51] prophet of God says but now what about
[42:53] the true seed the people of God are
[42:55] being made ready by the word of truth
[42:57] from the messenger to this age inner
[43:00] will be the fullness of Pentecost for
[43:02] the spirit will bring the people right
[43:04] back to where they were at the beginning
[43:07] and he says that is thus say the Lord so
[43:11] he's just confirming the holy spirit is
[43:13] going to bring you to original condition
[43:14] you were back at the
[43:16] beginning hallelujah amen he says it's
[43:19] thus say the Lord that's what Joel 223
[43:22] to 26 says and then he starts to read it
[43:24] right amen talking about the former
[43:26] Reign the latter rign and he's talking
[43:27] about the wheat and the fat shall
[43:29] overflow with oil and wine we've been
[43:30] through that and I will restore to you
[43:32] the years that the Locust had
[43:36] eaten now just pay attention brother
[43:38] Bram said the latter rain is the hour
[43:40] [Music]
[43:42] rain amen he said the former rain is the
[43:44] teaching rain the latter rain is typing
[43:46] the Dynamics coming to the church the
[43:48] hours rain amen I'm saying that for a
[43:50] reason because we're going to go very
[43:52] quickly and amen so he's restoring
[43:54] through all that the Locust canor C and
[43:57] palmor has eaten now now it says God is
[44:00] going to restore the Lutheran Church age
[44:02] did not restore the church it started a
[44:04] Reformation the wesan church did not
[44:06] restore Pentecostal age do not restore
[44:09] but God has to restore for he cannot
[44:11] deny his word amen this is not the
[44:14] resurrection of the church it's a
[44:16] restoration God will take the church
[44:18] right back to Pentecost of the beginning

[44:23] why we need a restoration the Locust
[44:26] cankerworm caterpillar palor and eaten
[44:28] all by the root and a small bit of the
[44:31] stem now we are told that all of these
[44:33] insects are all one and the same in
[44:36] different stages that's obviously typing
[44:38] your hor Riders it's one but in
[44:40] different stages they are the Antichrist
[44:43] spirit manifested in organization
[44:45] denomination and false Doctrine Through
[44:47] the Ages and that poor little root and
[44:49] stock is going to be restored God isn't
[44:51] going to plant a new church but he's
[44:54] going to bring its original planting
[44:56] back to original seed amen he's doing it
[44:59] as he stated in verse 23 what
