hardly wait to see we've seen him in the world we've seen him made clear to us by signs and manifestations but when we shall behold him face to face then all the toils of this life will be over amen aren't you looking forward to that day amen amen then let's lay aside every weight of sin that so easily beset us let's not be consumed by the things of the world but let's press on this morning amen so greet you once again in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen it's another week another day closer to the coming of the lord another day closer to the coming of another gengar amen so we're still patiently waiting amen to thank the lord for his grace upon sister karen amen this late in the pregnancy she can still come in let me use it to the lord amen amen worship to the lord amen but we pray the lord will continue to be with us amen and uh let's all pray that it's this week amen and everything goes according to god's plan and amen purpose amen so remember brother sebastian and sister christina amen they'll be they are in switzerland so they'll be traveling back home this week we pray the lord give them safe traveling mercies amen and also pray for brother pat nicholson this morning he is preaching out of pasadena this morning amen let's pray the lord bless them there this morning amen so preach your our visitors mommy's normal visitor has been with us for so long amen no stranger so this morning we have a serious question to ask you amen the question you'll find as we read in our scripture and only you can answer the question this morning amen let's turn to our bibles matthew chapter 11 we'll be speaking for a title i want to take from branham to me no not me i'm not making this about myself but you put yourself into me from branham to me a turning point in the ministry and the question we want to ask is are you the one or do we look for another amen we don't come to church to tickle our years amen we come here to check up whether we are right with god so an important question let's read matthew 11 from verse one amen and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed dance to teach and to preach in their cities now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ so there's a ministry being with john's disciples they are taking a word back to john and they are testifying about the works of jesus and his heart is in prison he heard the words of christ notice now the works of christ because christ means the anointed one and christ is still present tense he still has anointed ones in the end time he said two of his disciples and he said unto him are thou here that should come or do we look for another now if if there was a question put to the head there's a question being put to the body this morning are you the one amen or should we look for another this is not playing time and what's your answer and our response the question is not being asked to the church this morning it's being asked to individuals this morning amen now jesus let's watch our lovely lord jesus our head answered and jesus answered and said unto them go and show john again those things which you hear and which you see amen go prophesy back to him amen amen the blind received their sights the lame walk the leopards are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them there must be a physical manifestation jesus is not taking them back to the word and saying look the word is being preached he is showing them the signs and the wonders because these signs shall follow them that believe [Music] amen and jesus is saying and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me amen may the lord have blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated why is jesus saying blessed is he who shall not be offended in me you remember when he went to galilee and he began to do signs and wonders amongst them he went back to his hometown and they were offended and astonished at his doctrine and his teaching and they asked the question isn't this the son of joseph we know his brothers and his sisters amen and the bible says they were offended as he and jesus is saying blessed are you who are not offended in me amen amen now a question like we said now we're taking it from branham to me a turning point in the ministry all things are not continuing the same since branham fell asleep the church is on the move amen the question is are you a part of the church of jesus christ amen or are you stagnant i'm just satisfied with life satisfied with pretending amen satisfied with coming to a message church but no real manifestation no real zeal to serve god satisfied with coming to your sermon we are to be a living sermon amen amen amen hallelujah now just for a little background i want to go into this quote the prophet and watching how he can separate ministries and not take on ministries that are not years this is just for my foundation now brother branham here is telling he was coming in down the road the other day and there was something happened that spoke to me about the thing that i must do and it's not my message yes from verse 8 is not his message 10 7 is his message yes [Music] amen that is why it doesn't go past verse seven amen is everybody in agreement don't sit in one day here this morning amen hallelujah don't i behind i've got the holy ghost without sensation because the same prophet who said that he's the same one who said the holy ghost in you will punctuate every word of god with an amen amen amen hallelujah he says it's not my message amen what she says now leo mercer one of his friends said brother branham the time will come he said about five or six years ago maybe seven the lord is going to change your ministry brother branham sounds like he's prophesying over his life and he says when he does you probably just line up hospitals and speak them out of beds and things sounds like a powerful ministry doesn't it sounds like a thing to attain for but watch the prophet now he says it didn't sound right amen although i believe brother liu was trying to be sincere about it and that's the problem sometimes we are too sincere but it's not god speaking amen amen he says but it didn't sound right because our lord jesus never did that amen amen and he went to the hospitals there was one in that hospital do you remember where it was in the bible the pool of bethesda he said great multitudes of important people laid there amen crippled lame blind wizard waiting for the angel now that was in a spiritual hospital where people waited on divine healing and here the divine healer himself came and healed one and walked out we would have thought jesus was being rude we would have thought we made preparation to come in and yeah he healed one person and walked away we would have got offended at jesus now watch very important statement the prophet makes here you couldn't expect a mortal man or a ministry to come forth that would be greater than that was right hello brandonites in the message hear me well brandon was not greater than christ because the prophet is saying you can't get one greater than jesus christ it says you can't expect a mortal man or ministry to come forth would be any greater than that was see i couldn't agree with it jeffersonville hear me well we can't agree with that but as i started to turn around now watch the holy spirit speak the holy spirit come upon me this is another time he picked up his pen and he wrote he says i asked leo for a pen i got a piece of paper and i wrote it it's in this trailer today if you ever got up where it's at it's an old aluminium trailer where i was low out of the loading outfit just as you go in the door there's a shelf right on the right-hand side right in front of the trailer it's laying under there if that trailer still exists you can find it probably not right they probably made it a rally i laid it up there and said someday you can pull this out watch what he wrote god will never change the ministry but he will change the man with the ministry that's amen make that personal this morning because we are laboring to tell you that you are john who has asked to take the book and if you in your mind you are saying but i'm not i'm not ready to take the book god will change you and make you ready for that ministry because that word must come to pass amen yes hallelujah he says god will never change the ministry revelation 10 8-11 is a ministry yes amen but he will change the man he will change you and i am with the ministry that's what's to be done i know what i've got to do he says i can't do it in the condition that i am now right how many of you can say that this morning hello can you do it in the condition we are in so caught up with the things of life amen the boss asked you to do something you'll ask him how high god asked you to do something you go on a wall like jonah amen he says something has got to happen with me that will take god to do it amen we don't depend upon our human ability we know it's god gonna do it amen but we got to surrender our lives this is no plain thing amen now god rearranged his word for each age how many if you can say amen to them god rearranged the word for each age and he fought against men for each age that through the man the world would be fulfilled in that age amen and every time he sent his word he predestined a man to manifest that word amen if we look at moses in genesis 15 13 yeah the lord is talking to abram and he's telling him he said unto abram no officiality that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs before they even go into egypt god is prophesying god knows what's happening in your life before it happens he's saying they're going to go into a land that's not there that shall serve them and they shall afflict them there 400 years amen now they could have asked moses that question in that day are you the one or should we look for another right i would imagine they were they were there the general calls to ask moses that question because when he slew the egyptian he fled into the wilderness amen they were waiting for the deliverance and moses had shown them signs of being the fulfillment of that word but now moses was gone 40 years but know one thing this morning the prophecy of god will never fail things may be going on for 40 years and the trial is getting harder and under harder under the task masters the situation may be getting more worse in your life but hold on to the promise amen for in the appointed time in the appointed season the world that was promised to deliver you will be made flesh and the deliverance may come in the form of an 80 year old man walking with a stick in his hand a one-man invasion but that's god's chosen way to bring your deliverance amen amen amen that was one of the words that was predestinated god spoken in the time of abram and he said moses was coming didn't isaiah speak about john coming in john 40 and verse 3 isaiah living way before john and he's prophesying through the spirit he's saying the voice of him that cried in the wilderness prepare he the way of the lord how did he know word for word what john the baptist was going to say amen god has already predestinated the things that will be coming out of your mouth don't be afraid to prophesy amen yes thank you god has pre-arranged the words god wrote it verbatim and when john stepped in on the scene he fulfilled that word and he said prepare hear the way of the lord make sweet pots [Music] and he added some grasshoppers and some vipers you snakes in the grass you vipers another prophet by the name of malachi in chapter 3 verse 1 prophesied and he says i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom he seek yes shall suddenly come into his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delighted behold he shall come saint the lord of hosts these men were moved of the holy spirit amen they were tapping into the mind of christ amen and they were writing down prophesying about men who were appointed for an age yes amen even our lord jesus was prophesied by the prophet desire in israel 7 14 he says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive oh what a sign amen never been done before i'm gonna confound this world and bear his son and shall call his name emmanuel for unto us a child is born amen watch now he goes from prophecy to speaking it as if it happened yes amen what are you looking for in your life a healing miracle a touch from god salvation baptism of the holy ghost speak it and then talk it as it's happened now he goes from prophetic to present he says for unto us a child is born he doesn't say a child shall be born a child is born unto us his son is given amen and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be wonderful his name is wonderful amen his name is wonderful hallelujah his name is wonderful jesus my lord amen he shall be counselor hallelujah don't go to no psychiatrist he's the counselor this morning amen the mighty god yes amen not some second person in the trinity he is the mighty god the everlasting father how can the son be the father take away the scales from off your eyes this morning and you'll see it's the condescension of the same spirit of god amen amen he came from spiritual word to flesh yes amen hallelujah shalom this morning and in malachi chapter 4 and verse 5 watch out these two prophets prophesying isaiah and malachi azia's prophesying amen and malachi is prophesying he says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers amen maybe you didn't know who your father is maybe you never knew about the holy pentecostal fathers but when this one comes his ministry is designed to turn your heart back to the faith of the fathers lest they come and smite the earth with a curse amen so what is this elijah the prophet it's william branham and william branham he's a heart turner amen he's a hard turner amen the ministry to turn your heart was given to by one man so to turn your heart it would take something special no other ministry can produce them hello a special class of people and a special man sent to turn your heart amen he was sent to you the bible says behold i send you yes amen you don't have to go looking for him amen i send you amen he will come to you yes amen amen hallelujah hallelujah he may be off the scene right now but if he is sent to you his message will find you amen yes amen amen hallelujah you have a predestinated meeting time and a place amen to hear the message of the hour and the message of the hour is a tailor-made message custom design how many of you like custom design amen you feel like taylormade and if you like unique stuff amen this message is custom made for you amen hallelujah to suit your requirement in order for the germination of the seed gene seed of god within you it's not designed for the flesh man forget about it the flesh man will rebel against this message it's too hard give me some pleasures of his life brother branham why is so hard amen amen it's not designed for the flesh man the flesh man will dislike what he's hearing amen the flesh man we want to put this tape off the flesh man we want to say oh brother brandon wasn't put too but that hard penetrates through the flesh [Music] and it's not even designed for the spirit man the spirit has memory reasoning affection imagination unconscious the message was designed to go past the second pole some of you went by there yes amen hey first pull took you by the hand he took the flesh man by the hand he had a sign in his hand second full he discerned their spirits he designed the hearts you happy with two poles third pool went into the soul amen where the gene of god is yes amen it's designed for them so when he lie to the prophet's message finds you you can rest assured you may be withholding back but if that gene seed is within you you can rest assured that if you receive him and his message with faith yes the result is going to be the same every time you're going to end up when it turned out because that's what his message is designed to do to turn your heart yes you say turn it where to original faith amen yes amen it was the job of elijah the prophet to turn your heart back to the original faith the apostolic faith it's not a manufactured faith amen it's not a replica of faith it's not an impersonation of faith but it's the original faith amen yes so much so that if peter and paul walked into this church this morning they must feel at home amen they must fight the same spirit that was there peter paul is here tonight this morning amen they shouldn't wonder what is the condition of this church but it should be a church on the move amen in fact they should feel like they've missed out on so much when they walk into the shirt they shouldn't feel like [Music] peter paul we got some work to do it should be original faith again hallelujah same signs same wonders same manifestation if it's not then it's not the same yesterday today and forever and then we have made it up in our minds that we are [Music] he neither is or he isn't and i know that he is amen amen without a shadow of a doubt look what the prophet is saying here now he says look here you're you're an outside man maybe we're going through this because i saw some unbelief when we said this just now you have five senses that contacts the outside body god gave you five senses i mean if you got five senses amen to contact your earthly home see chase feel smell here then you have the spirit on the inside of that and it has five outlets conscience love so forth five outlets that can contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit so physical context physical spiritual context spiritual ego is going on now right he says your physical context the physical spiritual context is spiritual but inside of that you got a soul and that soul is that gene that came from god do you have representation this morning amen now any seed needs to be germinated to life amen and the message of the hour is the only thing that can germinate that seed to life it's a ministry to call a pride for jesus christ out of the church world that's why he says come out of all my people and be not partakers of her sins it's a ministry to call you out now people ask can i be a part of the pride without accepting the ministry of william branham we say no if you want to appeal that the answer is still no you know these politicians like zuma and everybody they want to keep appealing you can go to the supreme court of appeal the answer is still no you can't be a part of the bride outside of this message yes and if that hurts you i'm sorry i can't help you i can't change my statement amen the modern preachers of today cannot do it billy graham couldn't do it in his day oral roberts couldn't do it in his day a allen couldn't do it in his day and the modern preachers of today can't do it in this day they can't put you into the bride only one man and his message is designed to do that yes amen amen jimmy swaggart couldn't do it paul washer can't do it hey man james dobson robbie zacharias amen teeny snakes i'm smiling joel joseph prince boshuri whom an angel there's only one man in his message that will call this bride amen like eliezer sent by abraham to find a bride for isaac one man was sent in this day to call out a pride for the lord jesus christ amen now watch eliza was not relying on his own human ability he went to pray immediately he was going to find icky wife but rebecca was already chosen for isaac how many of you know eliza didn't go find her he located her there's a difference between finding and locating if i tell you go and find something you can bring me back anything but if i tell you to go locate this person that person already exists amen why didn't the lord tell elise i'll send my angel before you amen right so through prayer and supernatural assistance from the angel of god that went before him he was led to the well and according to his prayer he located rebecca his prayer was the one which he says the one who give me to drink and my camels to drink she will be the one that you have chosen amen so the one who responds to the message of the hour it's a sign and a vindication that you were already chosen amen to believe it why every time there's a deep there's got to be a deep within you to respond to the deep amen rebecca was not eliezer's choosing i'm saying it again the bride was not brandon's choosing you were not chosen on your good behavior on your moral standing he was just being used by abraham and god to do the work of calling out a bride from the midst of babylon was she in babylon he was calling her from the midst of babylon and providing her watch now he provided her with gifts did he not give her gifts yes hello yes he gave a gift did god not when he ascended i gave us gifts he gave us gifts and what's the second thing he gave up hello god this is a tie this is not just a story he gave her gifts and he gave her transportation amen he's given us the fireform ministry from branham to pass the teacher apostle amen and he's providing us transportation to change dimensions one of these days we shall change dimensions now he says watch now here's the quote if you're wondering why i'm making that statement so strong and so bold he has the prophet himself telling you you can't get into the bride without his message he says that's why this the church age that we live in there's no church no methodist let's get the quote it's in the identified christ of all ages amen oh sorry leadership paragraph 123 have you got it go back you've gone too far you've gone to the end of this but the killer wants to end the service you can find it in leadership paragraph 123 he says that's why this the church age that we live in what church age do we live in right remember the church yet is still going on but we have been called out of the church age and it's called the bride age yes amen he says no methodist baptist pentecostals or anything else you got it so it's the 7th of december paragraph 123 right i want you to catch this now the church age we live in there's no church no methodist no baptist pentecostals or anything else so he's grouping all denominations yes including the denominations in the message two lords and all of these things anything else can ever put this shirt into the bride can you read it can you see it he says none of them can put this church into the bride it'll have to be the answering of who td jake who for god to send a prophet to be revealed to because that's the one of the ways sorry it's the only way give god praise you are not sitting here by chance this morning it is the only way this is the way jesus spoke about when he said i am the way no man can come to my father but through me yes now can the body say that this morning you can't get to the father but through this message yes amen amen let's find the identified christ of all ages paragraph 157 now you we are saying we're just going to read to read this we are saying brother brandon you're telling me brother branham is william branham is the art turner he's going to turn my heart but to what i want to get it straight from the prophet so with younger people who's never seen the quotes you can now see it because this must also be established in your hearts amen paragraph 157 we got it brother caleb okay he says i want to ask you something i said and read out of the scripture that he is the same yesterday today and forever and just temporarily haven't primarily done it yet showed you that he's supposed to get this very same thing again in the last days how many believes that malachi 4 and all of it is supposed to return right back again him again come down and identify himself in a prophetic message to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith then he describes the faith apostolic faith pentecostal faith of the fathers that's exactly what is supposed to be done not some creed but back to the original faith now we believe that with all of our heart amen now if you go to the nigerians and you're buying your levi's even though you've got attack called levi's in your heart you know you are not wearing genuine even when that person compliments your tell you that's a nice genes you got and you're telling him thank you you know you're being an hypocrite because you're taking a compliment based on a fake [Music] am i right but we do not have a duplicate we do not have an impersonation didn't brother graham say there will be no impersonation to this the third poll he said there'll be no impersonation amen now let's get to revelation 10 7. amen so malachi 4 sent to you you can try to hide you can be trapped in some hindu system your national system he was sent to you he will find you that you will find you whether it's through the fivefold he will find you and you will turn your heart back that's his ministry that scripture can't fail then revelation 10 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished and we want to say finish the cloud yes amen it's finish the clown [Music] [Music] amen that scripture is finished amen the mystery of god is already revealed yes amen we know the mystery of god and how he was a the spirit and out of that great eternal function of being went forth in light called the logos amen amen and that logos was called the son of god hallelujah amen and now he further condescended amen became mercy yes yes from spirit he became worth mercy and from kansas he became flesh which is jesus christ but then further mystery remember the mystery of god if jesus christ is a further revelation of the mystery of god then jesus christ has a hidden mystery locked up inside of him some of you need water to swallow that is it too big a pill then you become part of that mystery of god in revelation 10 7 then what is it really telling you that this revelation 10 angel is going to unlock who you really are that you are really a part of the garden because like added eve was locked up in adam and the two were one flesh yes you were taken out of the side of the cross amen so christ is the mystery of god revealed and the bride is the mystery of christ revealed amen amen you're saying brother adrian why are you giving meat this morning chew on it amen yes it may feel like bull tongue but chewing it this morning amen say i like soft meat hey man some of you want tender lamb tonight to this morning we're getting it well done well done a man with no sauce no mushroom sauce on it no pepper sauce no cheese sauce we're giving it to you straight this morning amen and the unbelievers will choke on it the mystery is not finished to jonathan khan hello yes amen come out from under your chair this morning amen the mystery of god is not finished through jonathan khan the mystery of god is not finished through perry's song yes amen or sid roth sid roth knows nothing about the supernatural but it's not a show called it's supernatural listening to these losers why don't you want to listen to the original angel that was sent to you thinking you'll get further life from perry stone you are deceived amen thinking you'll get further alive from jonathan khan or kane whatever his name is why don't you come to the able one hallelujah that's what the bible says the voice of the air seven angel finishes the mystery completes the mystery makes known the mystery of god and the prophet says that is the capstone revelation amen let's get to that quote in the rapture message now what she's saying if god is infinite almighty all powerful omnipresent you believe he's here yes he's omniscient you believe he knows what you have needed why he knows all things from the beginning so we know there's nothing out of cater that sickness came upon you that you may see the glory of god receive it in jesus name amen amen some of you didn't hear me yes yes let go and let god have his wonderful way let go and let god have his way amen your high blood pressure will vanish your sugar diabetes will vanish your heart turns hallelujah if you let go and let god have his way thank you depression yes amen hey man nothing out of cater it's just us thinking it is it's everything run look back at his word and see what he's doing then we'll have an understanding didn't he say he won't give you more than you can handle but with the trial will bring a way of deliverance amen hallelujah watch this right now the next quote in latest cn church age he says after a short powerful work demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with jesus amen and weak demonstration but a short and a powerful demonstration this demonstration of the spirit this little anti-bride yes they are hunting you amen and prosecuting you they make fun amen they don't believe yet they call themselves believe the sign scoffers never risen from within the ranks of the message they went out from us because they were not a part of us amen amen didn't jesus say the next quote didn't jesus say in the last days quoting matthew 24 24 that the two would be so close it would deceive the very genes predestinated the elected ones if it was possible yes yes then you want to rejoice this morning that you weren't deceived some people i see they hanging this thing here this way in their churches they don't like to listen to the angel that's it turn it amen to the right i prefer it this way this may have been the original way the photographer took it but this is the original way the designer designed it to be looked at amen hallelujah what is he saying almost like the real thing so in the last days now you see it's what time now with time [Music] it's getting harvest time yes now remember he's preaching that when it's already i was tired you were not called that time you were called in the other stand what he says this is not lose his age so you can't smoke your pipe you can't drink you can't persecute the jews this is not pentecost age yes hello what age is it this is bright age as moses called a nation out of a nation christ today is calling a church out of a church you see the same thing in type taking them to the glorious eternal promised land amen amen now don't miss this he says to refuse the person that's doing the calling and he comma who christ now christ is the anointed one he is the manifested one so we said god allotted his word for each age at one time it was christ in moses so was he the christ yes come on now yes was moses the christ was john the baptist to christ amen and then jesus was the christ the bible says he was born the christ two lords say he was made lord in christ but simeon when he's there in the temple he said i thank you lord that i have seen christ the lord hello amen so now this is where the slippery slope now watch was brandon christ amen it was not jesus christ but christ means the anointed one so was branham the anointed one yes amen yes so let's read that again he says to refuse the person that's doing the calling christ no matter if you're pentecostal methodist luther whatever you are this angel nothing against them not not at all but in this age now you've got to accept like they did in that day the person of christ which is the word amen now i'm going to break it down for you and bring it further you are christ in this day yes amen now he says they've got to accept you that is why john in verse 11 of revelation 10 thou must prophesy again [Music] thomas watch manchester united lose again don't put your heads down amen i've got a question to ask you this morning time of playing church is over time of playing church is over amen the light is on this morning don't run away like a cockroach stay there you know why people have not progressed when they're supposed to be laying in the presence of the sun to mature that they have gone back to the world ask yourself the life that you are living this is not ended in any individual i'm asking you to each one check their lives what is different from you and a denominational person besides you coming to this church right we live the same like them watch the same movies they do love the same things they do the bible says if you love the world all the things of the world premier league is things of the world no no is there in the seventh seal message believers love soccer message believers and we say that's things of god these are things of god hello now can we crucify those things say i'm watching a 90-minute game i'm going to listen to a 90-minute sermon things are going to get hard and rough now people are looking at their watches saying isn't it about time to close the service but the bible says if you love the world all the things of the world the love of god is not even in you people can fuss and fight but let somebody say something against this message yes amen let them tell something about your team like you amen but what went here to see a man clothing find raymond this morning what came here to see this morning amen amen with soft words but have you come to meet with christ amen amen it says the eighth nothing against them not at all but the age you've got to accept the person of christ which is the word and he breaks it down in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst them i want to tell the people of the world this morning the world is made fleshless today and it's dwelling amongst you but you are rejecting it because a true sign is overlooked because it's in the form of a bride he says what life luther had was justification wesleyan sanctification added to it the pentecost led restoration of the gifts coming back in it added to it but now it's completing in the body you see the three phases of it so there's three phases of it and then he says and out of that that is why we sing that song these three stages changing me into the formed word image coming out of amen that when the resurrection comes the life that lived in them lutherans that went out the life that lived in the methodist went out and the life that went into the pentecostals will all be raptured out of the ground [Music] and this is your reward for being obedient you will be raptured out of the ground amen in the body of the bride to be taken in before jesus christ glory to god he says it's exciting amen do you feel excited amen and he says it's the truth oh listen to the statement now we've turned the corner [Music] lutherans baptist methodists all these full gospel churches are not on our level yes he says we have turned a corner where we going brother branham we're looking towards heaven hallelujah watching [Music] people don't want to say that watching for the what wait the cap on the pyramid as we would say he is coming back the church must be resurrected soon and we must be ready amen are we ready this morning amen amen hallelujah oh we better be ready amen let's move quickly revelation 10 8 let's read this and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the end of the angel would stand it upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel amen and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall be make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as as soon as i had heated it my belly was bitter and he said unto me when you find time in your busy schedule go and prophesy and he said unto me when you have free time and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings hallelujah amen amen amen now closing with this now they asked jesus they have the question are you the one or do we look for another we are saying from branham to me a turning point in the ministry then brother branham says we have turned the corner but the corner didn't go this way the corner went that way [Music] that way he turned the corner upward because this message is taking us up amen did he say when he saw the preview of the bride that this last church when she came on around marching to the peat of onward christian soldiers he said she went about this way and he said she was exactly like that first shirt and he said she went onward and upward did he say that he said we've turned the corner so we are not on the same level as these denominations but we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus now we could have asked brother branham are you the one and that's what they are asking are you the one sent are you elijah the prophet or do we look for another some have left went to look for another because they were not satisfied with what they were hearing that's right and i'm going to use this as a type [Music] but it's no reflection of john john the baptist because john the baptist was saved but spiritually speaking where was john the baptist where was he come on now you know your bible where was john the baptist john the baptist was in prison and they sent message to jesus saying are you the one or should we look for another we read what jesus response was he showed them the physical manifestation of his ministry because works without faith is dead right spiritually speaking now these are souls that are imprisoned and they are asking are you the one is this the one to fulfill revelation 10 or do we look for another mighty angel their mighty angel came down in revelation 9. put it up brother caleb for those that don't know what revelation 9 is why is john saying i saw another mighty angel where did he see another angel hello have you ever thought about that the scripture starts by saying i saw another mighty angel what is he saying here what is it who is that scar come on now people who is that star it's lucifer is lucifer in angel this is not a trick question it's a straightforward question yes he was the eyes of all the angels this is the angel that they saw coming down but he's falling like a star from heaven and through the earth and he's given keys to the bottomless pit they were not satisfied with this angel so they went to look for another angel amen and then revelation 10 7 they're asking him is he the prophet of that was predicted to come and then he says look at the signs i came out amongst you i didn't come for your money i went on healing campaigns sacrificed seven nights at a time 14 nights at a time slept there prayed for people till virtue left his body went into the second pool of his ministry amen they abused his ministry used it for their own gain used it just for the healing but then he turned his back towards them and he deserved their hearts amen and they were astonished at his ministry and many of them walked away because they were offended what do they tell you you are not called to preach amen now here's a question we're going to close with john asked to take the book john ate the book so who holds the evidence of the book the one who ate the book right so the question is being put to the body now are you the one who's got the book yes or do we look for another then what are you going to say like jesus jesus gave them an answer who tells john the sick are healed the dead are raised the gospel the poor have the gospel preached to them the lepers are healed you can't just say yes i'm the one and don't look for another where is the manifestation in your life individual work now where is the manifestation in your life where is the evidence of your life but don't don't be responding now [Music] you are the one that's eating the book remember what we read god will change the man to fit the ministry yes god will change you if you have not been living up to it maybe you got distracted along the way maybe the influence of later sea has got a grip on you but tomorrow if i phone you young man and i tell you i cannot make it brother she's sick or pray for him what are you going to do how are you going to fumble are you going to stumble but these signs shall follow them they believe amen tomorrow if i'm in the hospital and about to have the baby delivered i cannot come to you but one of these brothers yes will be sent yes amen are you prepared to go brothers amen and i'm going to call the least among you because the bible says call the least among you you must be equipped yes amen prepare yourselves because soon if another lockdown comes which they will i'm not saying i'm not prophesying right now the prophet prophesied that they will close these churches they will lock us down and then bro you're the closest one to this brother i want you to go pray hey i'm playing my tv game here now just wait for me to finish this level imagine there's five minutes left for that game you're watching and you get a phone call you need to go pray for the sister urgently what you gonna do firstly you're not in the right condition and atmosphere how are you gonna go pray for somebody why are you praying that you're gonna be praying lord let my team win lord but end time conditions what is the entire condition you see the latest in spirit end time conditions requires a present day message end time condition requires the present day christ this is not just a 70 preacher's morning it's the spirit of god crying out [Music] he says amen because when all hell is being poured on the earth under the sportos rider all of heaven must be on the earth to meet the challenge of the hour didn't we just read that revelation 9 all hell is being poured out revelation 10 all heaven that's why there's silence in heaven when the seventh seal in heaven is silent for about the space of half an hour the setting of that is revelation 10 and let's close with this quote he says listen the end time message should meet end time conditions don't think we are not prepared to meet the condition of legacier the end time message is going to creep us to meet enzyme conditions where they got off the message or to bring it back always end time message meets end time conditions all the way through the scripture you'll have to do the same thing this time a call back to the original word oh my like other messengers during the day the message will have to be the same we are promised that god promised in his word malachi 4 said it would happen and restore the faith of the children back to the fathers promised it and we're living in that day no question about it brother branham you were the one sent to turn our hearts back to the faith of the original pentecostal fathers you were the ones sent to reveal the mystery of god and we were the ones that are taking the book and eating the book and are prophesying again give god praise this morning [Applause] know the certainty in your heart if i ask you the question this morning are you the one yes i am yes i am the one hey man you may not feel it feel like it right now but god's gonna change you yes amen god sees your heart that you desire it amen yes god thank you lord for this meat that you've given out to our god this protein of god to nourish out the god oh to keep us strong to strengthen us to god and one of these days it will change those vile bodies father amen don't be long your promise that this will happen of god we thank your god for your servant that put the faithfully and we have received that word we thank you for your word and we say we receive it and we accept it amen may does the truth just because he has the power to transform because god this is the word from the oracles of the most sight amen thank you lord jesus you have spoken to us this morning we receive your word backstage i mean pray that those right now and have desired the holy ghost may they be full in the name of jesus christ one more time let's give the lord a good anchor maybe see today man so i want you to look at somebody find somebody and lock eyes with them for the same you can look at brother sunny and i want you to repeat after me are you looking at somebody's eyes are you the one they didn't hear you ask them again are you the one or do we look for another so go with that thought god bless you trust you've been blessed this morning were you blessed in the presence of the lord amen foreign [Music] hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] i [Music] [Music]
