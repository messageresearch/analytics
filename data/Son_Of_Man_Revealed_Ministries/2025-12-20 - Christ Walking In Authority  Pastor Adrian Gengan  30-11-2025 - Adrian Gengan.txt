We have come into our God's chosen place of worship this morning. Hallelujah. I was just want to praise him this morning. Oh, I feel really charged up this morning. I'm sitting there. Amen. Amen.

We &gt;&gt; have no fear. He hasn't given us a spirit spirit of fear. Amen. &gt;&gt; So anyway, I just want to share this testimony with you. And last week just after our midweek service, you know, I got home, I was lying in bed and all of a sudden my heart started, you know, thumping, you know, the heartbeat was going very fast. [clears throat] And then I didn't have fear, you know. I didn't have fear because I know who I am standing &gt;&gt; and I know when he calls I will answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just said Lord I don't know what this is but anyway I just got up. I went to the room came back and I start to pray. I said Lord let your will be done. Whatever it is you are the great physician. So the next morning I phone my daughter and uh I told her this is what happened. She said dad you know I told her please do my blood test I just want to check. Believe me brother sister she did all the blood all the blood checks for me. She said dad you know what there's nothing wrong. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; I just want to thank the Lord.

Father Lord, we thank you Lord that we are walking in your light. &gt;&gt; The revelation light of [clears throat] your word, oh God. &gt;&gt; Father [music] Lord, to whom much is given, much is required. Father, &gt;&gt; we thank you Lord that you [singing] bestowed your love upon us, Father. Truly, Lord, we can say you have lavished us with your love, oh God. And Lord, what you have given us, Lord, oh Lord, we cannot measure it with value, Lord Jesus. But Lord, we just treasure it in our hearts, oh God. And Lord, we keep this word in our heart, Lord, knowing that this word will quicken us and change us in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye. We're keeping our eyes fixed on the [music] promise, oh God. And Lord, we are not focused on the things of this world, oh God, but our hearts are fixed heavenly, Lord, and what you are doing for us, oh God. We thank you, the Lord, this morning for every believer that has come into the house of the Lord. I pray, [singing] Lord, that you'll meet us at the point of our need, oh God. I pray, [music] Lord, you'll help us to focus our hearts upon your word. May we find strength from your word. May we [music and singing] find comfort from your word and Lord may your word just illuminate our minds oh God even as we come before you now we submit ourselves under [singing] your mighty hand we surrender to you Lord we surrender every thought every word every action every deed oh God and we place you as Lord now Lord I pray Lord that you'd anoint me and anoint the people oh God even as they hear the word and father I pray Lord that your word will find quickening power in our hearts Lord find that faith in our hearts oh God to make it live oh God we ask your blessings now in Jesus mighty name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; And he's the Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Tim. May good to see you here this morning. Amen. May you be blessed in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 1. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to speak a little bit on Christ walking in authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ walking in authority or if you want to say it, the authority of the believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you focus your word when we sing Christ and if you're thinking of Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago, you're going to miss the message this morning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, let's just read from Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 15. Wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayer. &gt;&gt; So what we're going to look at is two prayers of Paul and see what he's praying for the church. Amen. So we know that Ephesians parallels the book of Joshua. &gt;&gt; This is the land of our inheritance. This is the mature believer. He's saying that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of glory may give unto you. So he's getting something. The spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have to get the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why Revelation 10:7 had to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened. &gt;&gt; Amen. So understanding is likening you to eyes. He wants our eyes to get some light, revelation light that you may know what is the hope of his calling, &gt;&gt; what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. &gt;&gt; Now pay attention there and don't glance over it. He wants your eyes to be opened. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because there's a calling. There's riches of his glory &gt;&gt; and inheritance in the saints. Where's the inheritance? &gt;&gt; The inheritance is in the saints. &gt;&gt; And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us? Where's his power directed? &gt;&gt; What is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe? &gt;&gt; Amen. according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heaven in the heavenly places. Far above principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come. and had put all things under his feet, &gt;&gt; and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that fill it all in all. You may be seated. The Lord had blessings to the reading of his word. Let's just drop down there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we go to Ephesians and verse 14 there. Amen. [crying] I think it's chapter is it chapter 2 or three? It says, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ." So bowing his knee again is a sign of supplication of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he would grant to you again. You want him to give something to us according to the riches of his glory and to be strengthened with might by his by his spirit in the inner man &gt;&gt; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is dwelling in our hearts by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. and to him be glory in the church by Jesus Christ throughout all ages, world without end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the authority of the believer I'm saying Christ walking in authority in me and you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You know they they came to the Lord the Lord Jesus asked the disciples who do men say that I am. &gt;&gt; He wanted to know what was the opinion of the outside world. And they offered him some answer. But then he asked them, "Who do you say that I am?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The world today has an impression of us. They call us all kinds of names. &gt;&gt; They may label us, but I'm asking you, who do you say that you are? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We must have a revelation of who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we're finding the authority of the believer. And it's important. And Paul is saying he wants us to get this revelation because in Ephesians 6:12 he says we wrestle not against flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't be living this life focusing on fighting flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the Apostle Paul saying here? We wrestle not against flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. but against principalities, &gt;&gt; against powers, against rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, it's going to be veiled sometimes in a human flesh &gt;&gt; because demon powers possess men. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he's saying you got to RECOGNIZE YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING THAT FLESH. &gt;&gt; You are fighting, Amen. principalities. &gt;&gt; You are fighting powers. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because where does the final principality and power end up in? It ends up in a man called the antichrist. &gt;&gt; Satan himself becomes incarnate. &gt;&gt; In the pope. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So demon powers are now let loose in bodies of flesh. &gt;&gt; The unredeemed, the lost, and they are making themselves known. But if we are going to try to fight these powers in the flesh, we are going to be defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is a spiritual warfare. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the authority is not just the property of a select few. &gt;&gt; The authority of a believer. Sometimes people think oh the authority lays in a minister. The authority lays in the evangelist. The authority lay in the pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the authority is true possession to every child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every child of God possesses authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can speak to your situation. &gt;&gt; You can speak to your problem. &gt;&gt; You possess the authority. &gt;&gt; Christ made it possible for you to speak over your situation &gt;&gt; and get the victory over your circumstance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ephesians 1:3. Just want to read this again. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. Now that word had is a finished. &gt;&gt; It's a past tense. &gt;&gt; So I am not praying to God for spiritual blessings. &gt;&gt; Oh yes Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am not praying to God for spiritual blessings. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything. You know the prophet of God would say this. Everything that Christ could ever do for us, he already done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's already done it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, he had already blessed us with all spiritual blessings. So, in Christ, all spiritual blessings belong to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some may know about it more than others because some walk with this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some walk with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some live in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some experience it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because having knowledge alone is not good enough. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul is praying that you receive knowledge. &gt;&gt; But if you don't walk in it, it's not good enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If I give you a million rand, who wants a million rand in your bank account? You can go and tell everyone you got a million rand, but you could be starving. &gt;&gt; You've got to go to the bank and withdraw the cash. &gt;&gt; Yes. and make use of the funds. How many of us are withdrawing from the bank of heaven? The bank of heaven has all spiritual blessings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know that there is nothing that can defeat the believer? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing can defeat the believer. &gt;&gt; He says sickness, sorrow, pain, grief, nothing can defeat the believer. &gt;&gt; WE ARE VICTORIOUS IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So having knowledge is not good enough. Knowledge acted upon brings the results. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can teach you week after week, but if you don't go put into practice what you have been taught, nothing will happen. I can tell you about Mark 11:23. If you say to this mountain, be thou removed, cast into the sea. Don't doubt in your heart, but believe what you have said shall come to pass. But if you don't yourself say to that mountain, if you don't speak to your problem, if you don't speak to your situation, nothing will happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus never told, if you put up Mark 11:23, he never told the disciples, pray to me and ask me and I'll speak to your mountain. &gt;&gt; The problem is too many of us are praying to God about our mountains when God said that you must speak to your own mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We want to go and cry. He didn't say cry to the mountain. He didn't say cry about your problem. He didn't say take your situation into your own hands. He said speak to it. Tell it what to do and tell it where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not only he says speak to it, he says be thou removed. That is speak into your mountain, but tell it where to go. Go into the sea. &gt;&gt; Tell your debt where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell your financial troubles where to go. Yes. &gt;&gt; TELL YOUR SICKNESS WHERE TO GO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Speak to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible SAYS ALL CREATION IS WAITING FOR THE manifestation of the sons of God. But the sons of God ARE REMAINING QUIET BECAUSE THEY WANT JESUS CHRIST TO COME BACK physically and do everything for them. But Christ has already risen us up together with him. &gt;&gt; So the dominion and authority now lays in HIS PEOPLE, THE BODY OF CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But that can remain dormant because people are expecting something else which is not in the word. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So knowledge acted upon brings the results and authority belongs to all children of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even a young child can speak to their problem. Even a young child can pray about their situation. Even a young child can speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is no respector of person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan is a deceiver. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's how he works. He come to make you think that you don't have the authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He come and whisper lies to you. &gt;&gt; That you are not you don't have any power, any authority. &gt;&gt; That there's still something further to come. Because as long as he can keep the believer down, defeated. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To make them think that Christ didn't do it all on Calvary, he can now walk with his own authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can walk with some kind of power over you. &gt;&gt; To make you believe. You know, some people believe sickness is a blessing from God. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Because they are not convinced that it's the will of God for them to be healed. &gt;&gt; No. You know, this is my lot in life. just live with it. &gt;&gt; The Bible says by his stripes you were healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God's will for you to be healed. Brother Brandham says unless you have confidence to know what the word is and his word is his will. He says then you can have the confidence to go to God in faith and say Lord this is your word. I'm standing upon your promise and I receive it. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people believe it's God's will for them to be in lack. &gt;&gt; But then we know what we're doing. We are taking Gyra and nailing him to the cross. &gt;&gt; Do you know believers especially in the message only refer to Jehovah Rafa? &gt;&gt; 99% of the time they'll only speak about Jehovah Rafa. But yet there are seven compound names. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham says he reveals himself first as Gyra. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE LORD HIMSELF shall provide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother, it's my lot. You sound like Lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lot was a lukewarm believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing is we don't know our rights. &gt;&gt; We don't know our inheritance. Yes, &gt;&gt; we are thinking just the natural descendants of Abraham are supposed to be blessed. &gt;&gt; Do you know what Satan is doing? He's taking all your funds &gt;&gt; that belongs to the children of God and he's distributing it because you don't know how to use it. &gt;&gt; He's taking all the believers blessings and he's offering all his movie stars money. &gt;&gt; He's [clears throat] offering all of it to the world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is why the kingdom of God can't move forward. Do you know why the kingdom of God can't move forward? God needs people like he told the prophet. The prophet attached himself to the Christian businessman's fellowship &gt;&gt; because they were the ones that could fund the evangelism. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He attached himself to John Shar &gt;&gt; because John Shar was funding him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't even build churches. Help us Lord. My &gt;&gt; Don is the worst. Praise the Lord. Why? We have not been taught kingdom principles. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even healing now, we don't want we don't want Rafa because we got medical aid. &gt;&gt; So, science has made it more difficult for people to have faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because now the first thing they have is they pull out their medical aid card. &gt;&gt; I'm going to see this doctor. And as long as the doctor can relieve the symptoms, they are happy. &gt;&gt; But Jesus doesn't relieve symptoms. Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus paid for your sickness to be healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not looking for symptoms believers here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know in the past if your eyesight was going you had to believe in the Lord and say restore my eyesight? &gt;&gt; Now you go to the optometrist and make him rich. Instead of having the faith to believe that God can restore YOUR EYESIGHT, IF GOD CAN HEAL A BLIND MAN, &gt;&gt; if God can give a BLIND MAN BACK NEW EYEBALLS, &gt;&gt; WHAT IS GOD TO TOUCH FIBERS IN YOUR EYESIGHT, to give light to your eyesight? He said, "Greater works in thee shall he do." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are looking FOR PEOPLE OF RUGGED FAITH. &gt;&gt; I'M not looking for mustard seed faith Christians. mustard seed faith in this time and hour in the hour of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're playing around with the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we're playing around with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T REALIZE THE POWER THAT'S LAYING IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WE DON'T REALIZE THE AUTHORITY THAT'S LAYING IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. WE TALK ABOUT THIRDP but we never see a manifestation. We talk about thirdp and we [applause] referencing the 60s.

HE SAYS, "KNOW THE TRUTH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And knowing THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How come we some some PEOPLE ARE SO BOUND SO BOUND BY SITUATIONS, SO DEFEATED BY SITUATIONS? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The Bible SAYS WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS. &gt;&gt; We are more than conquerors in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are overcomers. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; People think they're going to drag themselves into heaven. Yeah. You're not going to make it into heaven as a survivor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not going to make it into heaven as a survivor. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They're not going to be dragging you through the gates there. We got one survival year out of latest year. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We are going out of here victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the people that were destined in the mind of God to have a body change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were the people of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the people that God has chosen IN THIS HOUR NOT TO BE DEFEATED by the enemy, not to be WEIGHED DOWN BY CIRCUMSTANCE. AMEN. RISE ABOVE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE. RISE ABOVE YOUR PROBLEM. AMEN. RISE ABOVE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE TRYING TO WEIGH YOU DOWN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know what the problem is? We're trying to live by feelings. We were not designed TO LIVE BY FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; FEELINGS are made and designed, Amen. to contact a certainly home. &gt;&gt; You can't move by feelings in the things of God. &gt;&gt; In fact, the things of God will make you act crazy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The things of God will make you do ridiculous things. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. How many of you know the story John Ryan? &gt;&gt; We all know the story, right? &gt;&gt; We all know it worked for John Ryan, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many of us are daily confessing, "Praise God, I'm healed." Yet, you know, you're &gt;&gt; sick. &gt;&gt; How many of us are daily saying it? Praise God, I'm healed. Praise God, I'm healed. But we do it one day, we do two days, but we love John Ryan's story, &gt;&gt; but we never think it will work for us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We never think it'll work for us. We like it as a story. John Ryan said, "Praise God, I'm healed." &gt;&gt; But for us, &gt;&gt; are we applying the word daily? &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed. Say it for one week. Say it for two weeks. Say it for 3 weeks. Say it for four weeks. Say it for 6 months. Say it for one year until you receive it, until you believe in your heart that you ARE HEALED. HOW ABOUT YOUR loved ones? &gt;&gt; Some of you get excited here because I'm forcing you to lay your token over your loved ones, over your unbelieving family, over your daughters, over your sons, over your faith. You get excited in the church only when you go out. Hey, there's counsel. These people, hey, they don't listen. Very naughty people. This &gt;&gt; you're not laying your token. &gt;&gt; What did Raab say? &gt;&gt; I want all my loved ones to come under my token. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, people say, "Oh, brother, you preaching a name it and claim it gospel." I believe a name it and claim it gospel because God named the light and it came. &gt;&gt; God named the sun and it came. &gt;&gt; God named the moon and it [applause] came. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And God told name what you want. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ah, come on somebody. &gt;&gt; Did God tell Abra tellite name what you want? &gt;&gt; She named it and she claimed it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua named the sun. Sun stand still. Moon, you stand still. &gt;&gt; The authority lay in your mouth. But too many people are weighed under the circumstance, weighed by situations that they are defeated. Why? They're operating by the spirit, the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We need to rise above our circumstance. Tell the devil where to get off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. THIS MAN WAS RUNNING AND RUNNING. Says the devil IS ON THE RUN. HE SAID, "WHERE?" HEY, he's chasing me. &gt;&gt; That's the only time people see the devil on the run. The devil is chasing them instead of them chasing the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around. Turn around and face the devil later on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let him recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Devil running rampant in your house. &gt;&gt; Devil running rampant. Did you ever face him and tell him, "Listen here. It stops today. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You've you've handled this thing for too long. &gt;&gt; Today, it stops. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you notice. &gt;&gt; But you got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said, "Whatever you bind on earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You mean you're allowing demon powers, small little powers who have no authority over you to run rampant in your life. When Jesus said, "If you bind it on earth, I'll bind it in heaven." &gt;&gt; "And if you lose things on earth, I'll loose it in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. You mean you can lose the salvation of your loved ones on earth? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 10:19. [crying] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I have given you." Luke 10:19. Amen. Let's read this together. &gt;&gt; Behold, I give unto you power, &gt;&gt; Amen. to thread on serpents and scorpions. Now these serpents and scorpions are not what you are thinking. It's not these animals, right? &gt;&gt; He's going to detail what it is. And over all the power of the enemy. These are demon powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's referring to demon powers. &gt;&gt; And nothing shall by any means hurt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice here, there's two powers there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. the power that Jesus is saying he's giving us. &gt;&gt; And then there's the power of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you go and read the Greek in that, the first word power should be translated as, I have given you authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you go and read other translations, it'll show you there the Greek word. Behold, I GIVE YOU AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY POWER IN OURSELVES. THE ONLY POWER WE HAVE IS THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I give to you AUTHORITY TO TREAD UPON serpents &gt;&gt; and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what he's saying? Trample these enemies. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; These enemies can't hurt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is TELLING YOU TO WALK ALL OVER the enemy. &gt;&gt; Jesus is telling you to crush the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; HE'S SAYING THEY CAN'T HURT YOU. I'VE GIVEN YOU THE AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; How many of you know the bullies in school? &gt;&gt; They come and eat you. &gt;&gt; I know some of you you're digging down memory lanes now. You're getting sad. You're remembering how they caught you and they eat you. Then you ran home to your brother and you told your brother and your brother came there and he held him. He held them &gt;&gt; and he told you to give him. That's what Jesus is telling you here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've held these demon powers. &gt;&gt; You say they're not holding. Yeah, they're holding. Go read Revelation 7. Angels hold back the winds, wars, and strife. &gt;&gt; What are these demon powers? Amen. Hold it back. &gt;&gt; Why? For the Jews. &gt;&gt; That's for the Jews. Where's our one? Our one is Revelation 10. One foot on land, one foot on sea. Because if you read Revelation 13, there's a beast rising out of the land. There's a beast rising out of the sea. So the mighty angel comes to suppress these two powers because the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ IS ON THE EARTH AND NOTHING shall be able to harm her as long as she's on the earth. So he has come and put one foot on land, ONE FOOT ON SEA, SUPPRESS THESE POWERS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; And he's now GIVING YOU THE TITLE TO THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; HE BRINGS IT DOWN SUPPRESSING HIS POWERS. HE GIVES IT TO YOU. HE SAYS, "TAKE THE BOOK. EAT THE BOOK. THE AUTHORITY IS NOW IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've given you authority. &gt;&gt; That authority. If you keep the word power, Amen. Like we said, it's author. The word power, there is authority. You know why? If you say the word power, people say, "Oh, I just feel weak. I don't feel like I got any power." You don't fight him from your flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You fight him from this inner man. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you strengthen yourself on the inner man. You know the if the traffic lights go out, they call a policeman. &gt;&gt; Most of I haven't seen SAPS on on duty at traffic lights. I only see metro. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's only SAPS only metro allowed. So you see even there there's certain jurisdiction. SAPS can't go there the robot and make this like this. Only metro can do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The authority has been given to them. So traffic light goes out. You can't go past the traffic light if the officer raises his hand. &gt;&gt; What makes you stop your car? &gt;&gt; You recognize the authority &gt;&gt; that he carries. &gt;&gt; So you stop your car &gt;&gt; because that police officer has authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all he has to do is hold up his hand and everyone will stop. &gt;&gt; But he don't have power to hold back the cars. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I seen some policemen, these taxis don't listen to anyone. They don't recognize authority. That police officer saying, "Stop. That fell is going, you can't do any. You got no power now to go stop the taxi and pull it back. What it's requiring is for the other person to recognize your authority. &gt;&gt; He's looking for a law-abiding citizen &gt;&gt; who can recognize your authority. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something, the most lawabiding power of force is demon powers. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you tell them go, &gt;&gt; they recognize the authority and they go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Even at your presence coming there, they start to tremble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see, we got to personalize things as well. &gt;&gt; We know that demon powers tremble at the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Where is Jesus? &gt;&gt; Who carries the vested name of Jesus? &gt;&gt; Who carries the married name of Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they recognize you coming. You know, they saw Jesus coming there. those demon powers &gt;&gt; to set that man free. He was bound in chains &gt;&gt; and they said, "Oh, you come to torment us." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you let us go into the pits? &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Go." &gt;&gt; They recognize the authority. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; We need to speak and tell the demon powers, I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I've been washed by the blood of Jesus. Not only I've been washed by the blood, you know, some people like to stay at the cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The cross was no sign of victory. &gt;&gt; The tomb, the empty tomb is a sign of victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to start at the cross. &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] you can't sleep at the cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The gospel must progress. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't stay at the cross. &gt;&gt; You've got to progress. Same way you can't stay at justification. You've got to progress. Yes. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we'll be religious people. Oh, I love justification. I love justification. &gt;&gt; You got to move on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We couldn't stay at the cross. Jesus was not at the cross. &gt;&gt; They laid Jesus in the tomb. &gt;&gt; Then he rose up. I showed it to you. Acts chapter one there. Amen. I think it's verse maybe 5, six, seven, somewhere there. What is Jesus is ascending up to heaven. You think it's a notable thing for somebody to even want to behold these things. Amen. Acts chapter one. You'll think it's it's a MARVELOUS THING FOR US TO BEHOLD this thing and to stay a little while here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why stand Yeah. Uh Jesus is going up to heaven and the angel says, "Why standing gazing?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't this be a marvelous thing to behold? Shouldn't this be something to record? I don't want to miss this event. Jesus ascends up to heaven and the angel, you men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven. The same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall also come in like manner as you see him go to heaven. So he's telling them don't stay at THE CROSS. &gt;&gt; DON'T STAY NOW at the ascension. Go to Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pentecost is the next scene in the drama. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But some people are looking with a rear view mirror. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't stay at the cross. Come to the EMPTY TOMB. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T STAY AT THE EMPTY TOMB. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Go and see HIS ASCENSION. &gt;&gt; DON'T STAY AT THE ASCENSION. &gt;&gt; GO TO PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN DON'T STAY AT PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; Come now to the REVEALING OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Four riders. Amen. Went forth and and ate the tree, the bright TREE DOWN. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAYS, I WILL RESTORE. SAY THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE. SAY THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I gave that word over the church that I will restore, SAY THE LORD. GOD IS RESTORING YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS, your lost family members. But you know what crazy faith will do? Crazy faith will make you go and print that SCRIPTURE AND PUT IT ALL over the place where you can see AND SAY ALL THE YEARS THE LOCUST HAS EATEN, THE POWER HAS EATEN, THE CATERPILLAR HAS EATEN, THE LOCUST has eaten. I WILL RESTORE, SAY THE LORD. THAT'S WHAT FAITH CAN DO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LORD, thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what radical faith will do. &gt;&gt; If you're trusting THE LORD FOR PROVISION, ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE. Seek and you shall find. KNOCK AND THE DOOR SHALL be open. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what you start doing if you're unemployed? You go and apply for every job whether you qualified for it or not. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; because you are saying I must knock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Promotion cometh from the Lord, &gt;&gt; not from any man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Promote. Amen. Radical faith will make you print, ask and you shall receive. If you say to this mountain, it'll make you start to print these things and place it in front of you in your bedroom, in your kitchen, in your lounge. Amen. Hallelujah. You are not concerned about what people think about you. You are only there, Amen. to receive the promised WORD OF THE HOUR AND LET THE promised word of the hour come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is not a complicated thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We make it complicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know God must first reveal his promise in order for you to have faith in it? &gt;&gt; That's why he revealed his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know God must first reveal the promised word. He's not expecting you to believe nothing. &gt;&gt; If you go to uh Genesis chapter 12 there, you'll see God is telling Abraham, "Come, leave your land. I'll take you to a land." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Abraham just sitting one day wake up and say, you know what, I believe there's a God and I believe if I leave my father's house, the Lord will bless me. No, God must reveal himself first. &gt;&gt; God will reveal his word first. &gt;&gt; Then he takes our faith to follow. &gt;&gt; Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get thee out of thy country, &gt;&gt; out of thy kindred." Amen. &gt;&gt; From thy father's house unto a land I will show thee. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, &gt;&gt; and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful promise. &gt;&gt; I ask you, who wouldn't leave and go for this? &gt;&gt; This is the God of heaven making a promise to you. &gt;&gt; He's telling you, leave your father's house. &gt;&gt; Come, I'll bless you. I'll make you a great nation. We hear you worshiping idols. Your name is nothing here. If you follow me, I'll make you a great nation. I will bless you. I will make your name great and thou shalt be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if you wouldn't have followed this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I said raise it if you wouldn't follow [laughter] it. &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't follow this with the jack? Would you follow that? &gt;&gt; What favor? What grace? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you know that you are partakers of this through Christ. &gt;&gt; Through the royal seed of Abraham, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU ARE BLESSED WITH FAITHFUL ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says Abraham believed God &gt;&gt; and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Now God asked you to leave every Methodist church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every Anglican church, &gt;&gt; every Catholic church, every Hindu religion, every Tamil religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. HE ASKED YOU TO COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE and be not partakers of her sins and a place and you listened to that voice and you left it and you followed it and there's a BLESSING ATTACHED TO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'VE GOT TO LIVE IN OUR INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN INHERITANCE. THE INHERITANCE IS IN THE SAINTS. &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE IT AND RISE UP. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know Satan is mad now &gt;&gt; because Satan hates revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what we're doing is we empowering the believer by making us realize who we are in Christ. &gt;&gt; And Satan hates revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's just get to a quote. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you love the prophet of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just read here. Amen. If you can just find this quote for me, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just type up there. Satan will be powerless. Satan will be powerless. That's in the church age book. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's go up a bit. Now remember the Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; To continue from the book of acts means I must go past acts was somebody say pentecost. &gt;&gt; Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everyone everyone agree. &gt;&gt; Nobody's agreeing here. &gt;&gt; Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Acts was Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people feel like I'm going to trap you now. You don't want to answer me. [laughter] Acts was [clears throat] Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now just say Pentecost was Peter Marsburg and your destination is Durban. &gt;&gt; You must continue past Peter Marsburg &gt;&gt; to get to Durban. See already some people don't want to agree. Now you're going into your shell. Please come out. Because people think Pentecost is the end result. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was justification, sanctification, that's Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and then now into the formed word image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I am the formed word image. If you don't want to say it, I am the formed word image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am Christ on display now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, I am &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The formed word image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; I am Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ makes you, the prophet says, Christ in you makes you the central theme of the revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's in Christ the mystery. &gt;&gt; You become the central theme. &gt;&gt; All creation is now &gt;&gt; focused on you. You are the central theme. &gt;&gt; Nothing can happen on the earth without you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's great. So everybody agree that if Pentecost was Peter Marsburg and our destination is Durban, we must continue past &gt;&gt; continue continuation of the book of Acts. Continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come into the church, defile it, making it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. &gt;&gt; It exposes Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. How many of you know the seals exposed Satan? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. So, we're reading with understanding. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It exposed Satan. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Revealing his works. Right. What is his works? His work is to attempt the destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word. &gt;&gt; That's Satan's works. He despis discredits God's word. Right? So he fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get a true revelation, now watch this. Pay attention to this. He is not saying if they get a true revelation of who the Ora is. Hey. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; People have a revelation of who the outright is. They even know the antichrist. &gt;&gt; Probably the pope walking past you will call him names and say you're the antichrist. You're a deceiver. But if you go slightly up there, let's read again. Right. Further, it exposes Satan. But exposing Satan doesn't make him powerless. Read the quote with understanding. &gt;&gt; Four horse riders, four seals were revealed and he didn't make Satan powerless. &gt;&gt; Everybody agree? &gt;&gt; Four stages of the ride. He's riding in the fourth horse doesn't you having the revelation of him riding the fourth horse doesn't make him powerless. &gt;&gt; Can I get somebody to say amen? &gt;&gt; So let's see what makes him powerless. &gt;&gt; Go down now. He cannot stand it. He knows if the people get a true revelation of the true church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So matter no matter what he is doing, &gt;&gt; no matter if you get an understanding of what he is doing, you must get an understanding of what God is doing through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True revelation of the true church and what she is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I am Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; What she stands for. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And that she can do the greater works. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I am here to do the greater works. &gt;&gt; I am here to do the greater works. &gt;&gt; If Jesus said in St. John 14:12, greater works than these shall he do, for I go unto my father, I am destined. My gene seed is designed for me to come and stand here and do the greater works. &gt;&gt; I say IT WITHOUT RESERVATION. I SAY WITHOUT HESITATION, it is Christ in ME THE HOPE OF GLORY. &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; SHE WILL BE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AN ARMY THAT'S UNSTOPPABLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Cannot be defeated. Amen. &gt;&gt; If they get a true revelation of the two spirits &gt;&gt; within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit can discern and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; He will definitely be thwarted as when Christ withtood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. Satan hates revelation but we love it. with revelation in our lives. The gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail OVER THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, SOMEBODY REALLY UNDERSTANDING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOUR LOVED ONES ARE TRAPPED BEHIND THE GATES of hell. &gt;&gt; Is somebody hearing this? &gt;&gt; YOUR LOVED ONES ARE TRAPPED behind the gates of hell. &gt;&gt; Your health is TRAPPED BEHIND THE GATES OF HELL. &gt;&gt; YOUR FINANCES ARE TRAPPED BEHIND the gates of hell. &gt;&gt; But there's an advancing army, an invincible army that are pounding the gates of hell. AND THE GATES OF HELL CAN'T PREVAIL AGAINST YOU. THE GATES OF HELL ARE too weak for you. YOU ARE LIKE SAMSON. YOU PICK UP THE GATES OF HELL AND YOU SAY, "LET MY PEOPLE GO." YOU SAY, "LET MY LOVED ONES GO. LET MY HEALTH GO. [cheering] LET MY FINANCES GO. Let my son go. Speak the word and go forward." [applause and cheering] Hallelujah. God has got his church now. God has GOT HIS CHURCH NOW. HE'S TRAINING THEM. YOU SAY, "GOD IS TRAINING THEM NOW. GOD TRAINS. AMEN. OUR GOD TRAINS US. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T JUST LET THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WALK AROUND JERICHO ONCE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ON THE FIRST DAY IT MUST HAVE SEEMED STRANGE FOR THEM TO walk around Jericho. &gt;&gt; So he make them get accustomed to walking around the wall. &gt;&gt; GET FAMILIAR WITH YOUR TERRITORY. &gt;&gt; GET FAMILIAR with the enemy. &gt;&gt; Walk around it again the second time. BUT ON THAT SEVENTH DAY, [applause and cheering] WALK AROUND THIS wall seven times. Amen. Seven times. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW YOU MUST GO AND CLAIM EVERYTHING that God has given you? EVERY PROMISE IN THIS BOOK, YOU MUST GO AND POSSESS IT. &gt;&gt; When they heard they were coming, Jero didn't open up the gates and put out a welcome mat and say, "Welcome, come take over the city." They had to FIGHT FOR EVERY INCH OF GROUND. BUT they went to take over the land of AI. Amen. And that's what believers in this end time will do. We will take over the land of AI because they are artificial intelligence AND WE ARE SUPREME INTELLIGENCE. WONDERFUL. [applause] AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Artificial intelligence can't defeat supreme intelligence. &gt;&gt; I tell you one of the easiest WAYS TO TO DEFEAT ARTIFIC artificial intelligence no matter how advanced it gets. You want to know? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll turn off the power. &gt;&gt; They are depending on electricity. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Battery power can only last so long. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need God's power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know they can't define what electricity is? &gt;&gt; Yes. Science can't really define what electricity is. &gt;&gt; They know how to harness it power. They know how to use it, but they don't know where it come from. &gt;&gt; How many of you know the word eel means God? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why they named it L. &gt;&gt; Electricity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They know it's God's power. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Oh, wonderful. &gt;&gt; So, no matter how advanced science get, they can't defeat God and his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bring this to a close now. Amen. How many of you enjoying the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say, "Let's give the devil a knockout punch." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Ephesians 6 and 10. So just finishing the thought on the policeman. Where does the authority of the policeman come from? It's delegated to him. &gt;&gt; He's given a badge. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You going to read Ephesians 6, you'll see that finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the power of his might. &gt;&gt; The scripture does not say be strong in yourself. &gt;&gt; Why are we trying to fight our own battles? What is it saying? Be strong in who? &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Lord. &gt;&gt; Be strong in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is the believer? Somebody say in Christ. &gt;&gt; In Christ &gt;&gt; sitting in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's in Christ. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All I have IS THE AUTHORITY. THE POWER IS LAYING IN HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The might is laying in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am not trying to be strong. Amen. Hallelujah. It never said a word about you trying to be strong. &gt;&gt; It never said a WORD ABOUT YOU FIXING your problems. Amen. When you can be strong in the Lord, &gt;&gt; that's God's dedicated authority to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yet bless us with all spiritual blessings in Christ. Be strong in the Lord. The value of your authority depends on the force of the power that's backing you. &gt;&gt; You see, there are many countries in the world But if South Africa try and flex its muscles against the US, &gt;&gt; it doesn't have a good force behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; They can b like a Chihuahua. &gt;&gt; But there's a greater force behind the USA &gt;&gt; in military might. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You you understanding what this is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The value of the authority or the level of authority depends on the forcets behind the user. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The policeman has all the state metro backing him up. &gt;&gt; We have got all of heaven backing us up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know why the Bible says all hell was poured out on the earth? Satan knows if you don't leave hell and come on the earth, he'll never have a chance at you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I defeated certain people." He named names. &gt;&gt; He said, "But there's one group of people." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That that will escape me. Come on, say that. &gt;&gt; There's one group of people &gt;&gt; that will not even taste death. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There there's one group of people &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That the the Bible says they're going to be changed in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got to get to the earth to see these people. &gt;&gt; Satan came on the earth and he brought all of hell on the earth &gt;&gt; to try and have a go at you now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of the promise in the word that you shall not fall as e fell. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will not fall like e fell. &gt;&gt; Your gene seed can withstand the deception. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, amen. The believer is conscious of the divine power behind him and and of his own authority can face any enemy without fear &gt;&gt; or without hesitation. Let's read John 4:4. Let's see what John 4:4 is saying. What? Sorry. One John 1 John 4. You are of God, little children, and have overcome them. Who's the them? Amen. &gt;&gt; You are of God, little children, and are overcoming them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I reading right? &gt;&gt; And are overcoming them? &gt;&gt; Are going to overcome them? &gt;&gt; You are of God's little children and have &gt;&gt; overcome them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU ALREADY HAVE OVERCOME THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Because greater is he &gt;&gt; that is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Than he THAT IS IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I HAVE already overcome autism. &gt;&gt; I have already overcome cancer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have ALREADY OVERCOME HEART DISEASE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Because greater is he that is in me [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Greater is he that's in me. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we've got to exercise. Amen. Praise the Lord. We've got to exercise our faith. He doesn't say you're going to overcome them. He doesn't say, "I'm trying to overcome." &gt;&gt; That's the problem with [clears throat] people. I'm trying, brother. You know, I'm trying because they don't want to surrender. &gt;&gt; So, they keep trying. They keep trying. They think their works are going to gain them something. When Christ already did it FOR YOU, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SURRENDER to his will, to his purpose. Amen. Hallelujah. It is Christ in you. The hope of glory indwelling you. Amen. Through the person and the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He already overcame all of them. &gt;&gt; And he gives you the authority. Somebody say, "Christ gave me the authority." &gt;&gt; Christ gave you the authority. &gt;&gt; Matthew 28:18. Amen. Matthew chapter 28:18. And Jesus came. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power &gt;&gt; is given unto me in heaven and in earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All power. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. &gt;&gt; Now, that same word power is authority in the Greek. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All authority &gt;&gt; is given unto me in heaven and in earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Now immediately when Jesus ascended to heaven, he transferred that authority. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; He transferred the authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the ones who believe in him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People think that we just get salvation. But Christ gave us authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord. So the only authority Christ has on the earth right now is through his body. &gt;&gt; The only authority Christ has on the earth NOW IS THROUGH HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; This is what he was working to achieve. &gt;&gt; Through seven CHURCH AGES, HE HAS BEEN WORKING TO ACHIEVE THAT CHRIST MIGHT HAVE THE PREEMINENCES in a people. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the Bible says Christ is the head. &gt;&gt; Christ is not THE WHOLE BODY. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY TELL ME who's referred to as the body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he is the head and you we are the body. &gt;&gt; The Bible now is using like a human term to say body, human body as an illustration of the body of Christ. Now how much authority can the head operate alone without the body? But is Bible is the Bible saying Christ is the head? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So Christ is the head and there's only so much the head can do. &gt;&gt; The head is the intelligence. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The head can think things. He can want to do things but it requires the cooperation of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. REQUIRES OUR COOPERATION. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WE ARE CO-WORKERS WITH THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if you think you can operate independent of your head, cut your head and leave it next to you. &gt;&gt; We can't operate without Christ is what I'm trying to tell you. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2, sorry, let's Ephesians 1:22. [clears throat] Now, we just read in Matthew 28:18, he says, "All authority has been given to me." Everyone read that? &gt;&gt; And Ephesians 1:22 says, "He had put all things under his feet." &gt;&gt; Somebody show me feet in the head. &gt;&gt; Feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Feet is where? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody say in the body. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. He's put all things under where &gt;&gt; his feet. &gt;&gt; And gave him to be the what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He made Christ the head. &gt;&gt; Bless your name. &gt;&gt; And he put all AUTHORITY UNDER HIS FEET. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY, GLORY, GLORY. &gt;&gt; OH, if we only knew who we are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. gave him to be the head over all things to the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is the head. We are the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Notice Ephesians 1:20. Then which he wrought in Christ when he did this. Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to show you next is oneness. &gt;&gt; Yes. God didn't just take the head of Jesus &gt;&gt; and place it there in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He resurrected the whole body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if Christ THE HEAD IS IN HEAVENLY PLACES, THE REST OF HIS BODY is in heavenly places and we govern AND WE RULE FROM HEAVENLY PLACES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, we love you. Yes. &gt;&gt; He wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say you want to see the scripture. I'll show you the scripture. So, when did he raise Christ? When he raised him from the dead, he set him at his right hand. Somebody say right hand means power and authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 2. I know I'm I'm I'm giving you a lot of scripture, but you got to take your teaching from the word. Ephesians 2 verse 5 and 6. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when we were dead in sins, &gt;&gt; oh, THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; QUICKENED US. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Together with Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he raised up Christ, HE'S SAYING HE QUICKENED US. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD, WE WERE STILL DEAD IN SINS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH. &gt;&gt; But he's saying WHEN HE RAISED HIM from the dead, he quickened us together with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you are reading this? &gt;&gt; He quickened us together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With Christ. Let's go. Six. &gt;&gt; And had raised us up together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And has made us sit together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In heavenly places. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; I may stay in Phoenix. I may stay IN VERUM. I MAY STAY IN RESERVOIR HILLS. I may stay in Hillary. BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE I AM IN CHRIST JESUS. IN CHRIST JESUS, I reign within IN HEAVENLY PLACES. MY POSITION IS heavenly places. &gt;&gt; I reign from this authority. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; HEAVENLY PLACES. &gt;&gt; SATAN IS POWERLESS. &gt;&gt; Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; Oh, is somebody saying this? &gt;&gt; While we were dead in sins, how much more now that we are saved? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that didn't bring Esther to his side, raise the royal scepter and then not give her the opportunity to rule and reign with him? &gt;&gt; Watch after the royal scepter was reign was raised. &gt;&gt; Asus doesn't speak much. &gt;&gt; It is the bride now &gt;&gt; who's speaking &gt;&gt; commanding about a speaking about this concerned about the salvation of the Jews saying let's go and rewrite the laws. &gt;&gt; The bride is now in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say it again. Don't keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Speak and go forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sword of the word is in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Don't think about your problems. Speak to your problems. &gt;&gt; Don't cry about your problems. Speak to your problem. This is the hour of the spoken word. Amen. This is the time for the PREACH. THE SPOKEN WORD IS the original seed. And [applause and cheering] the original seed has been restored back to the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you all. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Some people think the the original seed is God's thoughts in the back part of his minds. No, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham is preaching a message. The spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; Some people say the original seed is a thought of God. No, &gt;&gt; the spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So when we were dead in sins, he had quickened us. That's not something he's going to do. There, there again. He had raised us. &gt;&gt; Had finished together. Made us sit together &gt;&gt; in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, I wonder if sometimes we are sitting together in heavenly places with Christ Jesus, but we crying to God like Moses at the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; But you're sitting in the seat of power. He says, "All power, ALL AUTHORITY IS GIVEN TO ME." &gt;&gt; And you, [laughter] I'm showing you scripture. You are raised up together with him. What are you crying about? &gt;&gt; SPEAK AND GO FORWARD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SPEAK AND GO FORWARD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Wherein in time past you walked. You see, IN THE PAST you walked according to the cause of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air. This is Ephesians 2:1 now. Amen. In time past, you walked according to the cause of the world, according to the prince of the power of the air. The spirit that now workth in the children of disobedience. You see where demon powers must be able to work, not in you. &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible is saying demon powers has legal authority to work in children of disobedience. But children of obedience, demon powers have no authority over you. You give them the legal right, the legal notice. AND YOU'RE A VICTIM NOW. NOT TOMORROW. NOT WHEN YOU GO HOME. YOU A VICTIM NOW. SAY, "SATAN, I EVICT YOU." &gt;&gt; AMEN. Ephesians 1:19. I'm going quick now. Amen. We need to finish. Ephesians 1:19. The exceeding greatness. Amen. The exceeding greatness of his power to us. When the exceeding greatness of his power directed to &gt;&gt; us, &gt;&gt; it's being usward. It's given to us. &gt;&gt; Excing greatness of his power to us would who believe according to the working of his mighty power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In other words, there is PUTTING FORTH A POWER. HE SAYS THERE'LL BE A POWER PUT INTO THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Find that power put into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you'll see the prophet is also saying this. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a putting forth of divine omnipotence. &gt;&gt; God's power working through the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Spoiling principalities, spoiling powers. Amen. Praise the Lord. Christ has been enthroned and we have been raised up together with him and the ruling authority is given to us. Amen. This brings to a close now. But if you find it, just tell me. Amen. Now notice he said there the head and the body is raised together. &gt;&gt; Somebody say the head and the body is raised together. &gt;&gt; The head and the body is raised together. &gt;&gt; Say both are in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Both are in heavenly places. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; My seat of power. &gt;&gt; Somebody say my seat of power &gt;&gt; My seat of power &gt;&gt; is in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; is in heavenly places &gt;&gt; but my authority is on the earth. &gt;&gt; My authority is on the earth. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; You getting that? Yes. &gt;&gt; You are sitting in heavenly places, but your authority is on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There'll be a power put into the church. You just start put into the church. We should get it. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the authority that belongs to Christ belongs to every single member of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 1 Corinthians 12:12 says, "For as the body, you got this." See what he says? He says, "You might think I'm a fanatic. The very same thing I'm speaking of will be done. There'll be a power put into the church." &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "There's no higher power than the revelation of the word." &gt;&gt; We're just preaching the power to you now to show you that it's already given to you. There'll be a power put into the church now coming in that the Holy Spirit will so anoint a people &gt;&gt; that till they'll speak. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; They'll speak and it'll create itself &gt;&gt; right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; They'll speak. The authority is given to you. It'll create itself right there. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We haven't seen powers like this coming to the church. Now I know it for effect. Amen. Praise the Lord. So you can read that at home. Amen. If 1 Corinthians 12:12 says, for as the body is one, all member and many members and all members of that one body being many are one body. So what I'm trying to show you here now is that the head and the body both are Christ. [snorts] &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; For as the body is one, somebody say head and body is one. &gt;&gt; Head and body is one. &gt;&gt; All the members of that one body being many are one body. So also is Christ. &gt;&gt; So when we are referencing Christ now, don't think about Christ 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about Christ the anointed one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we are talking about Christ, we are talking about both head. That's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. and us the body. &gt;&gt; Together we are Christ. &gt;&gt; You can't separate the head and the body and call one Christ and the other something else. &gt;&gt; What is it? Members of one body being many are one body. So also is Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So all the members of one body. Amen. So also is Christ. The church is called Christ. We are Christ. &gt;&gt; Who do men say that you are? &gt;&gt; But who do you say that you are? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you please go. I don't have time to read it now. Go and read Christ the mystery of God revealed where he's talking about Christ being the central theme. &gt;&gt; Christ being the central theme. He says wherever Christ is the anointing, the anointed one, that becomes the central theme of the revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's trying to show you how now you are the central theme. Okay. Let's close with this. Now 1 Corinthians 6:17 you say, "Brother, give me another scripture." But he that is joined unto the Lord is what? &gt;&gt; So there's no two spirits. &gt;&gt; There's no Christ spirit and then the bride spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have we been joined unto the Lord? &gt;&gt; What is he saying? Is one spirit. &gt;&gt; He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So let's let's recap. Let's not stay at the cross. Let's move past the cross, past the ascension, past Pentecost, past Luther, past Wesley, past Amen. Pentecost again. Let's move on to the formed image. Now &gt;&gt; let's become ALL THAT THE WORD SAID WE MUST BE NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Let's move past the mighty angel descending WITH THE BOOK. THAT'S FINISHED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Somebody hear me. Let's move past Revelation 10:7. He's already sounded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's move past. GO TAKE THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I have already taken the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have already eaten the book. &gt;&gt; I am now in Revelation 10:11. Yes, &gt;&gt; I am prophesying again &gt;&gt; before many tongues, many nations, many people. &gt;&gt; HEAR THE WORDS OF MY PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord. &gt;&gt; Wa. We are sitting together. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he died, we died. When he rose, we arose. When he was put ON THE M RIGHT HAND OF THE MAJESTY OF GOD, WE WAS PLACED ON the right hand of the majesty of God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are sitting there a sitting where the head is having control having dominion having all authority. Say Satan &gt;&gt; you are under my feet under my feet. &gt;&gt; All authority that Jesus Christ had &gt;&gt; he has given to me to &gt;&gt; when you are taking the book &gt;&gt; you are taking back authority. &gt;&gt; You are taking back legal rights to the earth. &gt;&gt; So the earth responds to the spoken word. So you've got to speak the word. &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. Give God praise. [applause] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Worship him. Worship him. Give him praise. &gt;&gt; Give him praise. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ wants to finish the walk in you. &gt;&gt; Christ wants to finish the walk in you. &gt;&gt; Christ has no hands but your hands. &gt;&gt; Christ has no feet but your feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. The authority belongs to us God. [singing] We bless your [music] ex. Oh, you have trusted us, oh God. And Lord, help us [music] keep that trust &gt;&gt; for he is Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's just make him Lord now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; He is Lord. &gt;&gt; Make him Lord of every trouble, [singing] every trial, every situation. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He has risen from [singing] the dead and he is [music and singing] Lord.
