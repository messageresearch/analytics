[0:14] that our Bibles returned to the book of
[0:16] second Samuel
[0:18] reading from chapter seven
[0:24] chapter seven verse 1.
[0:32] and it came to pass when the king sat in
[0:35] his house
[0:36] and the Lord has given him rest round
[0:39] about from all his enemies
[0:42] that the king said unto Nathan the
[0:44] prophet see now I
[0:46] I dwell in the house of Cedar yeah but
[0:49] the Ark of God dwelleth within curtains
[0:52] and Nathan set up to the king
[0:55] go do all that is in thine hearts for
[0:59] the Lord is with thee
[1:01] and he came to pass that night that the
[1:05] word of the Lord came unto Nathan to
[1:07] sing
[1:08] go and tell my servant David thus say
[1:11] the Lord shall thou burn me in house
[1:15] for me to dwell in whereas I have not
[1:19] dwelled in any house since the time that
[1:22] I brought up the children of Israel out
[1:25] of Egypt even to this day but I've
[1:28] walked in a tent and in a tabernacle
[1:32] amen and in all the places wherein I
[1:34] have walked with all the children of
[1:36] Israel speak I a word with any of the
[1:39] tribes of Israel whom I commanded to
[1:42] Feed My People Israel
[1:45] saying why not mean House of cedar
[1:49] now therefore so shall thou say unto my
[1:54] servant David
[1:55] thus say the Lord of hosts
[1:58] I took thee from the sheep coats
[2:02] from following the Sheep to be ruler
[2:05] over my people over Israel
[2:08] now we know that the prophet illustrates
[2:10] that but if you want to also want to put
[2:13] that to us from where the Lord has taken
[2:14] us

[2:42] Winters and I've cut off all the enemies
[2:45] out of thy sight and made thee a great
[2:48] name amen amen we are associated with
[2:51] Jesus yes that's why we've been given
[2:53] that name amen
[2:54] and he has taken off all the cut out all
[2:58] our enemies and he kneeling on the cross

[3:33] saved and where even demons the name of
[3:35] Jesus and it allowed us to have that
[3:38] name amen and not only is that he says
[3:42] yeah yeah he's dwelling temporarily it
[3:45] was a type because he already planned
[3:47] God already in his mind that he wants to
[3:50] have this Tabernacle to dwell in amen
[3:53] and that Tabernacle is the body of
[3:55] Christ that body that Tabernacle is
[3:58] amongst his sons and daughters that he
[3:59] wants to come and dwell in amen amen
[4:04] and he showed it when Jesus comes on
[4:06] Earth that was the temple that was the
[4:08] body and now it out of Jesus side comes
[4:11] the bride yes

[4:17] Jesus body the Tabernacle was Jesus
[4:19] himself but out of his side comes the
[4:22] the bride which is part of the the
[4:25] Tabernacle of God Amen and on the day of
[4:28] Pentecost the Holy Ghost comes down
[4:30] gives birth to the church so he can come
[4:32] now and dwell in his body amen but out
[4:35] of the blood of Jesus you couldn't do
[4:37] that amen yes
[4:42] and I was with thee with us whoever thou
[4:45] Winters and have cut off all thy enemies

[6:20] foundation of the world
[6:22] that we should be holy and Without Blame

[6:27] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[6:30] children by Jesus Christ to himself yes

[6:35] will Amen to the praise of the glory of
[6:37] his grace wherein he had made us
[6:40] accepted in the Beloved Amen in whom we

[6:53] wherein he had abounded us towards us in
[6:57] all wisdom and Prudence Abid made known
[7:01] unto us the mystery of his world thank
[7:03] you according to his good pleasure which
[7:06] he had purposed in himself
[7:07] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[7:10] of times he might gather together in one
[7:12] all things in Christ
[7:14] which are on earth even in him yes in
[7:18] whom also we have obtained an
[7:19] inhabitants being predestinated
[7:22] according to the purpose of IMU worketh
[7:25] all things after the Council of his own
[7:27] will that we should be to the praise of
[7:30] his glory yes who first trusted in
[7:33] Christ
[7:34] in whom yeh also trusted after that you
[7:37] heard the word of truth yes the gospel
[7:40] of your salvation amen amen so you have
[7:42] to receive the truth for your day amen
[7:46] in whom also after that she believed so
[7:50] you have to
[7:51] yeah and believe it amen and yeah we're
[7:55] sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise
[7:59] amen which is the earnest of our
[8:01] inheritance
[8:02] until the Redemption of the purchased
[8:05] position unto the praise of his glory
[8:08] amen thank God for the reading of his
[8:11] word
[8:14] also we learned too quickly to the book
[8:15] of Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6.
[8:20] Hebrews 11 6.
[8:25] but without faith
[8:28] it is impossible to please him yes for
[8:32] he that comes to God must believe that
[8:35] he is
[8:37] and that he is a rewarder
[8:40] amen amen don't you love that amen
[8:45] of them that diligently seek Him amen
[8:49] amen you know we always have to sing
[8:51] when you're preaching we say come to the
[8:53] altar and other the minute we say come
[8:56] to the altar you have the concept in
[8:58] your mind that I have to come to the to
[9:00] the front to the altar here because
[9:01] that's the tradition that we taught by
[9:04] but the order is actually the sacrifice
[9:06] the author was meant for sacrifice in
[9:09] other words when you come you when you
[9:11] come to the order you're going to die to
[9:12] yourself amen you've got to sacrifice
[9:14] the flesh man you got to sacrifice the
[9:17] things that are keeping you away from
[9:18] the presence of God yes
[9:21] amen
[9:23] so if you are diligently seeking seeking
[9:27] him it means you are you are forsaking
[9:29] the things that is keeping you away from
[9:31] his presence because you cannot seek him
[9:33] while you are also seeking things that
[9:36] satisfy the flesh man amen because God
[9:39] is his spirit amen and those that
[9:41] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[9:43] and in church
[9:47] so tonight I'm gonna speak on living in
[9:51] my father's economy amen amen amen yes
[9:55] and the only way you can live under your
[9:58] father's economy
[10:00] in this day is under the third pool yes
[10:04] and the third pool
[10:07] I know many are proclaiming they take
[10:09] the scriptures and they take the
[10:10] blessings of the scripture
[10:12] but we're talking about the economy of
[10:14] God that comes through faith amen amen
[10:17] it's a faith economy
[10:19] amen
[10:21] and you find that when God wanted man to
[10:23] live under this economy it was a perfect
[10:25] economy
[10:28] but if
[10:30] if traded this economy
[10:32] for listening to the serpent in the
[10:35] Garden of Eden and traded it for the
[10:38] tree of knowledge
[10:41] and through the tree of knowledge he
[10:43] brought forth deaths he brought for
[10:45] every doubt yes he brought forth
[10:48] everything that's negative upon the
[10:49] Earth
[10:53] and because of that a separation from
[10:56] God it allowed Satan and his demon
[11:00] powers to infiltrate the human race yes
[11:06] but God wants you Insurance to dwell in
[11:09] his presence amen amen and if you are in
[11:12] his presence you are in his economy and
[11:15] you cannot dwell in the presence of God
[11:17] if you miss the message of the hour yes
[11:19] yes amen because the Bible says in Amos
[11:23] 3 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing
[11:26] but he revealed his Secrets unto his
[11:29] servants the prophets
[11:32] amen so when you come if you want to
[11:35] come under God's economy you have to
[11:38] first accept His prophets yes
[11:40] because all the time he was living in
[11:43] Amnesia but the seven Thunders come to
[11:47] awaken you
[11:48] amen amen to where you really come from
[11:51] amen he come to awaken you to show that
[11:55] you are a spirit man trapped in a flesh
[11:58] body yes that you are now trapped in a
[12:01] pest house
[12:02] and because of the fall of Man In the
[12:04] Garden of Eden you are trapped there yes
[12:07] but Jesus come to make a way for you
[12:09] amen amen yes he come out to make a way
[12:12] so once again he can get the other man
[12:14] back on the earth because God was
[12:17] feeling for his Fallen son Adam and now
[12:20] he's feeling for the sons of Adam that
[12:22] were Fallen amen and to live under God's
[12:25] economy you cannot do that not being a
[12:28] Son of God and the only way you can
[12:30] recognize your son of God is come under
[12:33] his calling yes
[12:35] you have to come under sonship
[12:38] amen because when you come under
[12:39] Sunshine being tutored and you come to
[12:41] maturity now you have the keys amen yes
[12:45] and now you can make use of the
[12:47] inheritance
[12:52] amen Jesus said in John 15 5 I am the
[12:55] vine here are the branches he that
[12:58] abided in me and I name the same bring
[13:01] it forth much fruits yes
[13:04] without me can do nothing yeah
[13:07] if a man abide not in me is cast forth
[13:10] as a brunch
[13:11] and he's withered and Men gather them
[13:14] and cast them into the fire and he
[13:16] burned if you ain't abide in near my
[13:18] words abide in you you shall ask what
[13:21] you will amen and it shall be done yes
[13:24] thank you Lord hearing is my father
[13:25] glorified that you ain't bear much
[13:28] fruits so shall ye be my disciple amen
[13:32] so they are principles in living in
[13:35] God's economy amen
[13:37] and the principle firstly is obedience
[13:39] to his words yes because what are these
[13:42] words you cannot have faith
[13:44] and faith is a substance yes the problem
[13:46] of God says not an imagination yes
[13:50] in the message you can put it there in
[13:52] the message perfect faith
[13:54] it says faith it is a substance and not
[13:58] an imagination
[14:00] not an emotion yes
[14:03] but something that you have and it comes
[14:05] to you by hearing the word of God
[14:11] and that only Faith cometh by hearing
[14:14] and hearing the word of God that puts it
[14:16] back to where your feet that is not in
[14:19] some individual
[14:20] it's not in a man
[14:22] it's not in an organization it's not in
[14:25] a group of people it's in God because
[14:28] God is the word yes amen your faith is
[14:31] in God yes
[14:34] amen
[14:35] so God come to us establish Us in this
[14:37] truth because we are living in a Time
[14:40] where man is lying on the natural thing
[14:43] to survive in the economy because under
[14:47] the tree of knowledge they have left
[14:49] Faith they have neglected to to come to
[14:51] the true word of God and they decided to
[14:54] take off the tree of knowledge yes they
[14:56] keep and they're still partaking of the
[14:58] tree of knowledge
[14:59] so if you want to live in God's economy
[15:01] and if your life is partaking of the
[15:04] tree of knowledge and you're not
[15:06] partaking of the things of God then your
[15:08] influence is going to come from there
[15:10] yes yes and your faith is going to be on
[15:12] that economy and that's not a that's not
[15:14] a faith that's a reasoning and there is
[15:17] a doubt that that is why you find now
[15:20] people they have left what God has given
[15:23] them which was a perfect word and they
[15:26] now started to reason they started to
[15:28] dwell on Satan's economy
[15:31] and that is why you find there was a
[15:33] falling away now because they went into
[15:35] the tree of knowledge reasoning and
[15:38] doubts reasoning and doubt and you can't
[15:41] mix death with faith amen you can't make
[15:43] doubt in faith amen
[15:46] but you can't live in God's economy
[15:49] without perfect Faith yeah
[15:53] yeah amen yes because to dwell in God's
[15:55] economy you got to live in a world of
[15:57] perfect Faith amen amen
[15:59] because God's economy is not our economy
[16:03] sting yes
[16:05] a caramel man looks at things by his
[16:08] senses by his five senses but the things
[16:11] of God are based on faith and faith has
[16:14] to be anchored on something and he has
[16:16] to be anchored on the revealed word of
[16:19] God Amen the word given by Revelation
[16:21] yes
[16:23] amen
[16:25] amen and that is why if
[16:28] you have a revelation of the word that
[16:30] is why when you talk about the heaven
[16:31] you have a revelation of Heaven out of
[16:33] the message of the hour you don't have a
[16:35] revelation of these things you don't
[16:36] have a revelation of Hell you don't have
[16:38] a revelation of these horseraders that
[16:40] are writing right now how can you afraid
[16:42] to believe those things I can come and
[16:44] tell you the Bible show you by the Bible
[16:47] but if it's not to revealed to you if
[16:49] the Antichrist Spirit that's on the
[16:51] Earth right now is not to reveal to you
[16:53] how can you have faith then to believe
[16:54] that yes
[16:56] it has to be angered on something
[16:58] amen and it has to be the absolute amen
[17:00] amen and that's the word of God Amen and
[17:03] that is why when you look at a
[17:05] circumstance for example if a doctor
[17:07] give a prognosis and he says right you
[17:10] have sickened with cancer and cancer is
[17:12] in your body it is now first stage and
[17:15] now it is nothing else we can do is
[17:16] being honest to you because he's telling
[17:19] you he's going as far as his textbooks
[17:21] checks him
[17:22] right he's taking you as far as your
[17:24] checkbook and take him yes
[17:27] but as a Believer you have been shown
[17:29] there was a problem that came in the
[17:31] cancer age amen and the angel of God
[17:33] come to insult him to go into not even
[17:36] cancer would stand in your way amen amen
[17:38] yes and then he takes the people back to
[17:40] the to where it originated from
[17:43] he takes him right to the Garden of Eden
[17:45] where sin come from where every disease
[17:47] comes from amen then you open up your
[17:50] spiritual senses to take you to the
[17:52] Realms of demon powers amen amen and
[17:55] show you that what what the doctor is
[17:57] not learning in his in his university
[17:59] that now that cancer is a demon Spirit
[18:03] upon this person and now to to go and
[18:06] and now defeat this cancer you've got to
[18:10] come by the spirit of God to go as a Son
[18:12] of God and know that it's a finished
[18:14] work on Calvary and then you have to
[18:16] know that a sonship I am in God's
[18:19] economy now I am a rightful Heir and I
[18:22] have the right to say these signs shall
[18:24] follow them that believe they shall cast
[18:26] out demons in my name they shall flee
[18:28] amen amen when the land on the sick they
[18:31] shall recover amen yes so you know that
[18:34] the demons are subject to the authority
[18:38] and the demon got it when they recognize
[18:40] that now you know that you are a son
[18:43] this person is walking as a son this
[18:45] person is conducting a himself of the
[18:47] sun those demons know that
[18:50] amen yes but his principles in the
[18:53] kingdom of God Amen you're gonna give
[18:55] your time and dedication to separate
[18:58] yourself from the flesh man
[19:00] you got to sacrifice your time into
[19:02] prayer you've got to separate separate
[19:04] yourself in time into fasting you know
[19:06] there was a time in the
[19:08] there was a case there was a sister
[19:11] there was trouble by this evil spirit
[19:13] and the sister was tormented by the
[19:16] spirit yes and it was tormenting us
[19:21] you just come over there speak to where
[19:23] and do funny things
[19:26] so the sister brought the store
[19:27] attention so I know the scripture said
[19:30] these things come out by fasting and
[19:31] prayer yeah so I went into my study and
[19:34] I fasted and Afraid for the sister
[19:37] and the Very hour that I was fasting and
[19:39] praying
[19:40] that Spirit went to the sister and said
[19:42] there are some brothers that are coming
[19:44] to chase me away
[19:47] I'm not coming back anymore
[19:49] and by the time we went there the spirit
[19:51] already left us
[19:53] I didn't have to go there when I was
[19:55] fasting in prayer because we are doing
[19:57] Warfare Amen in the spiritual Dimension
[20:01] there are dimensions that we can conquer
[20:03] through prayer amen we can conquer the
[20:06] spiritual Dimensions to prayer while
[20:08] Daniel was praying there was a spiritual
[20:10] conflict going on amen amen in every
[20:14] there was a prince that was there the
[20:16] demon of Persia the prince called The
[20:18] Prince of poison it was a demon Spirit
[20:19] there's a witch telling Gabriel to come
[20:21] and give Daniel a message but then
[20:24] Daniel's prayer brought to heaven and
[20:26] Daniel Gable sought refuge and Michael
[20:29] comes and defeats uh the Prince of
[20:32] Persia and then Gabriel comes into the
[20:33] message so that's why when God wants to
[20:36] give you a message sometimes when you
[20:37] come into the service come prayfully yes
[20:40] amen amen pray for the meetings yes
[20:42] because the devil wants to start from
[20:44] the spirits yeah the devil will do
[20:46] everything remember you got to recognize
[20:48] if you understand God's economy he's
[20:51] spiritually economy how it works amen
[20:53] there's also demon powers yes that's
[20:55] trying to stop you from the blessings of
[20:57] God there's demon powers around it when
[21:00] you prevent your blessing
[21:02] you might be have someone sitting in a
[21:04] meeting they might have a need
[21:07] but your wrong attitude will cause that
[21:09] person not to receive the healing amen
[21:12] that's right you may you may you may
[21:15] have a blessed service and leave from
[21:17] the service as soon as you go you just
[21:20] have to think about your work you start
[21:21] to think about tomorrow and all these
[21:23] things and then you lose your blessing
[21:24] yes amen
[21:28] because while you are living in a
[21:30] different economy yes true
[21:36] amen
[21:38] Lord
[21:44] amen
[21:49] so God
[21:52] you say the news message in perfect
[21:54] paragraph 43 he said see if you had
[21:56] perfect Faith you look right straight to
[21:58] God and believe it and walk away amen
[22:01] talk about the person that comes in the
[22:02] prayer line now I've got a ailment
[22:04] whatever

[26:50] a bit further now you might be trusting
[26:53] God for a need
[26:54] now one day there was a woman with death
[26:57] in the land of Israel
[27:01] but it was a prophet on the scene amen
[27:04] and it comes with a word to her
[27:06] and this is you can open up second Kings
[27:08] chapter four one two seven maybe people
[27:11] are worried about their debts tonight
[27:13] let's see what the Lord says here
[27:15] Second Kings
[27:20] now they tried a certain woman of the
[27:22] wives of the son of the prophets unto
[27:24] Elisha saying
[27:26] here's Elisha coming with a double
[27:28] portion amen
[27:31] thy servant my husband is dead
[27:34] and thou knowest that thy servant did
[27:38] fear the lord
[27:39] and the Creditor has come to take unto
[27:41] him my two sons to be born men
[27:44] and Elisha said unto her what shall I do
[27:47] for thee
[27:48] tell me what is Dao in the house
[27:52] and she said that I had made had not
[27:54] anything in the house save a pot of oil
[27:56] you see
[27:58] she's looking at just the physical thing
[28:00] that she now she doesn't have
[28:01] right
[28:05] right she doesn't have that but watch
[28:07] our God the economy is going to change
[28:09] things around now
[28:10] [Music]
[28:12] then he said go borrow the vessels
[28:14] abroad of all our neighbors and empty
[28:16] vessels borrow not a few
[28:21] and when thou art coming Thou shalt shut
[28:23] the door upon thee and upon thy Sons why
[28:26] saying shut the door this is not for
[28:27] everybody this is the third poor
[28:29] manifestation amen
[28:32] and thou shalt pour out into all those
[28:36] vessels
[28:37] and thou shalt sit aside hat which is
[28:41] full that which is full
[28:43] so she went from him and shut the door
[28:45] upon her and upon her sons who brought
[28:49] the vessels to her and she poured out
[28:52] and he came to pass when the vessels
[28:54] were full that she said unto her son
[28:55] bring me yet a vessel and he said unto
[28:58] her there is not a vessel more and the
[29:00] oil stayed amen then she came and told
[29:03] the man of God and he said go sell the
[29:05] oil
[29:06] and pay thy debts and live thou and the
[29:09] children of the rest amen amen that's
[29:12] God's economy why I'm speaking like this

[35:21] tribe you want to say with your
[35:23] spiritual blessing he's blessed us with

[35:27] inheritance within the tribe yes because
[35:29] God has given unique Ministries in the
[35:32] body of Christ and every part of the
[35:34] body has a part to do I'm sure you're
[35:37] God's economy now God wants to work with
[35:39] his body in his economy because God is
[35:41] ready to set up his kingdom now amen
[35:43] there's no way else there's nothing else
[35:44] left for this Earth
[35:46] in the Kingdom of of this world now
[35:48] Satan has come and is being celebrated
[35:50] right now but the kingdoms of Daniel's
[35:54] prophecy must be come to pass amen where
[35:56] the king the Gentile Kingdom must End
[35:58] Amen yes the Gentiles kingdom are soon
[36:00] coming to doom and the gospel must go to
[36:03] the Jews and the and the Gentile bride
[36:06] must leave the Earth yes
[36:08] amen but God is working with his own
[36:10] right now yes
[36:13] amen and he wants to he wants to do that
[36:17] perfect work amongst us this is a quick
[36:18] short work
[36:20] it's not a long work we don't have much
[36:22] time left here yes yes because you can
[36:25] see the the why is now in Hawaii is now
[36:28] advancing
[36:30] but not one nuclear bomb is going to
[36:32] fall as long as we are yeah amen yes but
[36:36] they got the bombs
[36:37] they got the Vatican Mark there and they
[36:39] got America back there because it was
[36:41] dusting the Lord
[36:43] that's why you say watch Russia watch
[36:46] Russia watch Russia you can't be saying
[36:48] you're a Believer and you're not
[36:49] watching what the prophet has told you
[36:51] yes yes
[36:53] these things are happening and you're
[36:55] living a normal life
[36:57] when God wants you to be blessed with
[36:59] all spiritual blessings amen God wants
[37:02] you to enjoy the benefits of his economy
[37:03] that's why we have the harness of the
[37:05] Holy Spirits amen he's showing us
[37:09] listen you you asking God for finance
[37:13] right
[37:14] now you are relying on finance because
[37:17] Finance money if you take money you take
[37:19] physical money it's made of the material
[37:22] of the earth you want to be technical
[37:24] say no my money is an account I work
[37:25] online right
[37:27] online devices all those things were
[37:30] made from things of the Earth the
[37:31] antennas the satellites all were made
[37:33] from things of the Earth
[37:35] right
[37:37] so if you are lying on that
[37:39] and you want that money to come why
[37:42] don't you go to the creator of the
[37:43] material of the Earth
[37:45] they're created the way that money can
[37:46] come through
[37:48] amen why why you want to look at and
[37:52] trying to find it to the way Satan the
[37:54] economy works
[37:56] because he is the God of this evil age
[37:58] you don't believe that you offered it to
[37:59] Jesus yes he said I'll give you all
[38:01] these kingdoms of the world I'll give
[38:03] you all these things okay let's let's
[38:05] take it more Into the Now
[38:09] the very people that you admire your
[38:12] Hollywood stars those singers
[38:15] those big soccer stars those rich people
[38:18] of the world
[38:19] do you know for them to be popular they
[38:22] have to sacrifice
[38:25] what am I talking about
[38:27] they have to make a pact with Satan
[38:31] they have to give their souls to the
[38:33] devil
[38:34] they have to trade their soul into the
[38:36] devil for them to become a superstar
[38:38] that's right
[38:40] for them to become popular they can't
[38:43] have that without giving something
[38:45] without sacrifice
[38:48] and that's why didn't you say that to
[38:50] Jesus bow down to me
[38:53] and I will give you that
[38:57] he's the God of this evil age
[39:03] in Daniel's time
[39:05] he didn't Bow Down
[39:07] he stood for his God yes
[39:10] but these people that are up there
[39:12] because if you're not if you don't sign
[39:15] this pact and don't come into the system
[39:16] they will not make you popular they will
[39:19] use what they control which is the media
[39:20] and so forth to bring you right down
[39:23] you don't join the system they'll put
[39:25] you right down but they can make you
[39:27] popular
[39:28] maybe you don't even sing good but they
[39:31] can make you a star they can make you a
[39:33] superstar
[39:35] amen they got because it's Satan's age
[39:38] yes
[39:39] Satan can do that but it's gonna make
[39:41] your life miserable that's why you find
[39:43] Muslim people getting to drugs to run
[39:45] away from these things because they
[39:46] don't know what to do after the life is
[39:48] given they have to keep giving and
[39:50] giving and then eventually when their
[39:52] body can't take it anymore on their own
[39:54] and Satan bashes them yeah
[40:00] for drugs
[40:03] because they can't take it anymore after
[40:05] he uses
[40:06] they're like an abused woman
[40:08] you know when a woman is used and
[40:10] ravished That's what Satan does and
[40:13] that's what he does to these churches as
[40:14] well
[40:16] they got everything on the outside
[40:19] but maybe you need to go look at what's
[40:21] on the inside yes
[40:23] don't look at someone outside glowing
[40:25] that's why when you see a son and
[40:28] daughter that's full of the holy spirit
[40:29] of God and many people see people the
[40:32] ministry take you up and follow the God
[40:34] and people lust after that they just
[40:35] want to come by the pulpit but they
[40:37] don't realize they took a sacrifice yes
[40:39] yeah yes they all go and see these
[40:41] people to come into God's economy they
[40:43] have to sacrifice the time in dedication
[40:47] people let's see people preaching and
[40:49] say oh I can be like that I can just go
[40:50] preach
[40:51] it doesn't work that way that's right
[40:53] you see a person praying for the sick
[40:55] and Supernatural things are taking place
[40:56] but they don't realize how much time it
[40:58] took in fasting and prayer how much
[41:00] alone time it took with God
[41:04] amen
[41:07] you see when you walk in God's economy
[41:09] your spiritual senses are illuminated
[41:12] and when your spiritual sins is
[41:14] illuminated you can walk talk to a
[41:16] person and you can see the demon Spirit
[41:17] through the person yeah amen and so will
[41:20] that demon Spirit recognize you
[41:23] if you're a son and daughter of God that
[41:25] demon Spirit recognize you and will not
[41:27] even look into you and want to keep away
[41:29] from you
[41:32] what I'm talking about go and go to
[41:34] somebody
[41:36] and you just do a test and you know that
[41:39] someone you you since they got the
[41:40] spirit on them go and speak the word
[41:43] open the words with him and see how long

[49:39] might just charge some that they teach
[49:41] no other Doctrine
[49:43] neither give heed to fables and endless
[49:47] genealogies
[49:48] which minister questions rather than
[49:52] Godly and defying which is in faith so
[49:56] do this is God's economy now
[49:59] rather in Godly refined which is in
[50:05] faith
[50:06] yes God's economy which is in faith
[50:12] amen
[50:15] he says
[50:17] in the message of power of
[50:18] transformation this is what the prophet
[50:20] says
[50:21] in paragraph two double nine
[50:23] he says

[50:44] signed the Declaration of Independence
[50:46] that's right I was at Washington and
[50:48] Valley Forge when he crossed the river I
[50:51] was there that morning I prayed with him
[50:52] I was there you was an American if you
[50:55] were an American you asked for

[56:42] that's when Christ comes into a man's
[56:45] life for he is made in the image of God
[56:49] Amen and he's made in the Statue of God
[56:53] and God didn't give you this trip here
[56:57] on Earth to be this that or the other

[58:00] way of doing it through his word that
[58:03] will hold it together amen and he's
[58:06] preaching this in the message the world
[58:07] is falling apart how appropriate it is
[58:10] now oh yes in the corruptable age that
[58:13] we live in when the time when the world
[58:15] is gross Darkness
[58:17] the only hope that we have is that we
[58:19] are living in our father's economy amen
[58:22] amen and no one else can do that but a

[59:12] and say you are now Mrs Jesus Christ
[59:17] amen
[59:21] Paul said
[59:23] he said and if you salute your brethren
[59:24] only what do you more than others do not
[59:27] even the public and so
[59:28] but be thou perfect even as your father
[59:31] which is in heaven is perfect
[59:36] amen
[59:41] his last quote here the message again
[59:44] perfect Faith paragraph 61 he says I
[59:47] don't know the mechanics of the Holy
[59:49] Ghost
[59:50] but I know it fell on me I can't tell
[59:53] the mechanics of it but I know the
[59:55] blessings of it
[59:57] that's all I know I care to know about
[59:58] is the blessings of the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:01] mechanics he works them that's his
[1:00:03] secret this boy could not be healed
[1:00:06] because the disciples had power Jesus
[1:00:08] gave him power to heal all men of
[1:00:10] sickness to cast out Devils to cleanse
[1:00:11] the lepers and to raise the dead and he
[1:00:13] gave him power but they didn't have
[1:00:15] faith to operate that they had and then
[1:00:18] they questioned Jesus said well now why
[1:00:20] couldn't we do that and you know what
[1:00:22] Jesus give them the answer these didn't
[1:00:24] come by fast again prayer yes so he's
[1:00:27] taking him back to the sacrifice because
[1:00:30] Jesus came and showed servant to it he
[1:00:33] came and showed that he was here on the
[1:00:35] earth the temple of God dwelling on the
[1:00:37] Earth but it come with sacrifice he had
[1:00:40] to go and separate himself right
[1:00:43] yes he was among the public and he wants
[1:00:45] among everyone because that's his
[1:00:46] ministry yeah but they come a time
[1:00:49] where you you and God
[1:00:51] it comes a separation time
[1:00:53] where you have to go hear from God
[1:00:56] he said I do the son of a man can do
[1:00:57] nothing less the father shows him there
[1:01:00] comes a time where you go and commune
[1:01:02] with God amen amen so every time you go
[1:01:05] when you go into your internal source
[1:01:07] that's your refilling amen
[1:01:09] because if you don't do that and you're
[1:01:12] partaking more of the tree of the party
[1:01:13] from the Tree of Knowledge Tree of
[1:01:15] knowledge sea of knowledge it will bring
[1:01:17] doubt
[1:01:18] the minute you are faced with a
[1:01:19] circumstance in your life the tree of
[1:01:21] knowledge will give you doubt
[1:01:23] but the more you partake from the Tree
[1:01:24] of Life
[1:01:25] when the circumstances arise you become
[1:01:28] a master over the circumstances
[1:01:32] Amen in closing scripture Genesis 22 18
[1:01:35] says and in thy seed shall all the
[1:01:39] nations of the earth be blessed because
[1:01:41] thou has obeyed my voice
[1:01:44] amen but we know that he was coming to
[1:01:47] the Royal seed and through the Royal
[1:01:49] seed come the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:01:51] amen he was the first born of the new
[1:01:53] creation
[1:01:54] amen Jesus was the first born of a new
[1:01:57] creation of a new species a different
[1:01:59] species because the world saw just a
[1:02:02] natural man but here comes now Jesus is
[1:02:05] showing us how there's going to be a
[1:02:07] spirit Man
[1:02:08] manifested In the Flesh body amen amen
[1:02:11] and the message of the hour comes to do
[1:02:13] that takes us back to our true identity
[1:02:15] take us back and shows shows us you are
[1:02:19] now in your father's economy amen amen
