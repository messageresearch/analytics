amen praise be to the name of the Lord Revelation chapter 5 amen glory be to his name amen amen the final voice to the final age is here yes yes amen glory be to his name blessed be the name of the Lord every other voice must stay silent okay every other voice must there's a word it's called s-h-u-t it must shut up because they're the people that's called to be the final voice to the final age other people are talking they're blowing off here amen let's turn to Revelation chapter five amen glory be to his name Hallelujah now yeah Revelation chapter five let's just read it from verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice that strong Angel if you click on that it's a mighty angel amen and I saw a mighty Angel a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice amen hallelujah who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven knowing Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look there on including John amen hallelujah including all seven Church age Messengers including you and me none of us was found worthy yes amen and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah amen he's coming amen from the tribe of Judah what's the what's their Beast a lion amen the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof amen amen and to lose the six seals come on and to lose the Seven Seals amen hallelujah some wants you to believe that only six are open but the Bible is saying he prevailed to lose the Seven Seals amen and I be held and low in the midst of the throne in the four peace in the midst of the elders stood a lamp as it had been slain what does that mean it looked like it was slain meaning the lamb was still bloody amen when you looked at it it was full of blood like it had been slain amen hallelujah but you've got to catch it in time now amen Jesus was laying on the cross and his next part of redemption is to go and take the title deep back amen title deed to the Earth title did to man's inheritance that's what Jesus is doing right now amen so the blood is so fresh yes amen having seven arms and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Fourth piece and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Hops and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of the Saints so watch where your praise are going into this Dimension now and they sang a new song straight away there's a vicious cry straight away there's praising straight away there's worship amen amen glory be to his name amen thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals they offered our slain and has redeemed us unto our God by the blood out of every Kindred tongue people and Nation watch now specifically Kindred time people Nations and that was made as what Kings and that's the original image Kings and Priests is the original image Melchizedek was both king of priests amen Genesis 1 26 was made in the image of God at that stage of the condescension he was in the opening form he was melchized so when he said let us make man in our image he made him a king to rule over the Earth and he made him a priest to serve God Amen amen glory yes amen it's only under this message we are restored back to Kings and Priests amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord and we shall reign in heaven and we shall reign in the sixth dimension and we shall reign where on the earth amen amen every so every place the soul of your foot shall tread yes amen it's yours they're fighting for it now but it belongs to you amen Abraham look northwards Southward Eastwood Westwood I give it to you amen so when they're fighting for land amen saying you once land without compensation he's talking about your land let him blow out here it belongs to you yes yes amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen hallelujah and they said and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand and thousands of thousands God still got angels never mind the third left amen amen sing with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing amen all of that is ours amen amen who's the mighty conqueror amen amen hallelujah did he say we are joint yes and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and Under the Sea and such as I in the sea and all that are in there but I saying blessing and honor and glory and power bear to him that sitted upon the throne and up unto the lamb forever and ever and the four B said amen and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever amen now we're going to go quickly to Revelation chapter 10. because this book now that the lamb God it must come down to the Earth and I saw another Mighty Angel here the mighty angel now the strong angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud [Music] amen and a rainbow was upon his and his face was as it was the and his feet has filled up and he had in his hand a little book open amen glory and he had in his and a little book closed open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voices when a lion roaring yes he from the tribe of Judah amen roaring like a lion and when he had cried seven Thunders after their voices and when the seven Thunders had answered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which is and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever which created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are there in that there should be time no longer so that time no longer is delayed no longer it's time for the seventh angel to come in on the scene amen because remember John must seal it up it's not yet time so the angel lifts up his hands to heaven and at work time no longer means there should be delay no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and we are him sound when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as they are declared to his servants the prophecy amen and then just go to that last one when John takes the book now he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and kings who must we prophesied before people Nations sons and kings that was made as Kings and Priests and you remember Revelation 5 you just read the same thing amen give him glory give him praise let's give him a good example praise this morning we may be seated amen amen amen hallelujah let's just put up our announcement quickly so next week we know what's going on Amen blessed be the name of the Lord so today is the 30th so this coming Sunday

we're looking at amen the final voice to the final age and every other voice must stay silent amen and you are not to keep silence yes you are commanded by the voice to go and prophesy again amen glory be to his name amen praise be to his name now if we look at Genesis chapter 12 the pro the the Lord is calling Abram it's the first time God is calling Abram now that's where it all starts in his journey amen we know that this is my point God will always have the final say and you'll always have a people amen amen amen that he can use amen God will always have the final say if we look in Eden when the deception came there were many voices in Eden amen you are the voice of the serpent you have the voice of Adam you have the voice of Eve but then the finality is the voice of God Amen who comes into the garden to strict not all errors amen glory be to his name so God is the one that is the final voice amen you say I I just thought you said I'm the final voice all that was in God God according to Christ and all that within Christ departed to who is church amen so you become the voice of God in this day amen hallelujah not yet we're going to read and I want you to to to understand what we are reading amen I want you to understand what we are reading because this is Abram and out of him would come to our tribes and our those 12 tribes would would camp and the forebearers and the four anointings amen but out of this man came all for anointings oh come on now out of this man team or four anointings glory be to his name out of this man oh Hallelujah blessed be his name you know where I'm going with the same man out of this man this man is the source he's the roots yes amen amen glory so now the Lord so we got Hebrews uh Genesis chapter 12. now the Lord had said unto Abraham get me out of thy country out of thy kindred and thy Father's House unto a land I will show thee amen now at 75 years old most would be preparing for retirement most won't be preparing for a journey most won't be preparing and anticipating for better things in life at 75 most will be preparing for retirement amen but God calls Abram when most will get sentimental and say once I was young now I am old and this is the land of my fathers I was born in the land and I will die in the land you hear people say this I was born a Hindu or die a Hindu I was born a Muslim I'll die a Muslim amen I want you to know no Christian was born a Christian come on now Shake That religious demon off of you you were not born a Christian the Bible says you were born in sin so you were born a sinner amen amen but we need to be born again Hallelujah so nobody was born a Christian every Christian had to be born again amen now when God calls a man he doesn't leave him in the state that he called him from Abram's people was not a great nation Abram's people was not blessed and Abram's name was not great amen and Abraham because of his condition was a blessing to nobody amen let's read verse two then you know what I'm talking about I will make thee a great nation how can you make somebody who's great a great so he must not have been great come on now read with understanding God will not take you and call you to lead you to nothingness unless God will always take you if he called you he's going to bless you hey man yes I will make thee a great nation a great nation with a great name [Music] Hallelujah maybe in times past your family name meant nothing to people but God has called you amen I put you into the family of God and given you the name above every other name maybe the gangan name meant nothing the chitty name amen hallelujah whatever your surname meant nothing to the world but the name of Jesus every knee will bow and every tongue must confess that Jesus Christ is Lord amen amen who are you I am Adrian Jesus that's my surname amen Hallelujah I am not the son and Joe amen I am not the son you are not the daughter of your Earthly parents amen I know who my father is amen amen come on get the carnality off of you amen You Are Spiritual son and daughter of God Amen we need to stop focusing on the flesh amen hallelujah we get too sentimental in the flesh amen you got to know who you are amen so he's calling in I'm gonna make you a great nation and give you a great name and not only that I Will Bless thee and you'll be a blessing amen thank you Lord yes amen hello I know God called me to simple things in life in life what did he say I Will Bless thee yes but we sing Abraham's blessings are mine Abraham's blessings are mine but then we don't see it because we have no hope we have no no imagination we have no creativity in our minds but faith is a substance of things hopeful as long as you have no ambition in life you'll be nothing yes yes you've got to have ambition you've got to have ambition amen Glory the prophet says I like a man with vision amen not somebody who's just laying around yeah amen so God is calling you to bless you thank you Lord oh no only one person wants to receive it right now God is calling you to bless you amen hallelujah you got ahead of me enough come on now God is calling you to bless you and make you a great nation amen a holy nation a royal priesthood amen I Will Bless thee make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing yes amen stop going causing chaos everywhere stop fighting with people you are called to be a blessing amen stop terrorizing people stop telling people you don't know who I am I'll show you I am show them who you are but the blood of the Lamb amen amen stop ruining the family name Hallelujah you are called for a much higher purpose these people haven't seen who I am yet amen get beside yourself and die to yourself die to your fleshly nature amen God won't leave you in the condition he called you out of that's the point of this verses God is not calling you out to live in the condition that he found you God has a vision for you God is a plan for you God has a purpose for you yes amen thank you amen you might people might see you one way people might have an opinion of you when they saw Abram leave isn't that Abraham the idol worship her son they still want to base you of past reputation amen hallelujah even you you mentioned the name or that person you got an opinion of that person already you don't know what the Lord Has Done in their life amen you don't know how God changed them you think God's only working on you amen oh thank you amen oh I know that person is like this he's like that you can't get positive words out of your mouth when you especially when it comes to people critical to the Core amen When you mention a good word they go silent they're like I know better I had different experience amen what are you doing you are magnifying the devil you are calling demons Britain is root of bitterness root of envy amen hallelujah amen we need to move I Will Bless thee make the name great and you shall be a blessing Hallelujah and if you know as long as your seed remains with you you can bless no one because the kingdom principles is sowing and briefing amen amen Hallelujah did Jesus say do unto others as you would have them do unto you you can bless people in lots of ways hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the Lord so so not only does he bless you but anyone next verse now and I will bless them that bless me amen didn't Jesus say that didn't they say a cup of water cold water blessing didn't brother Branham say those who do good to the bride yes Hallelujah now sometimes we don't want to take blessings somebody give you 100 no brother you keep it you need it more than me you don't know what they are trying to do and you are telling them basically take your seed out of my ground don't sow it in me because I don't want you to have a return I hope you're spiritually minded the animals amen now the laws of God oh how many hours we got we got three hours praise the Lord amen amen because when you leave here you'll be more empowered now the laws of God don't operate like the laws of man the kingdom of God operates on a different principle yes like when you go to school they teach you that ABC means A is for come on now let's see all of you all are talking different here when I said when you go to school did I say when you come into the kingdom of God I said when you go to school A is for B is for banana somebody saying ball something banana C is for but in the kingdom of God now you can go to the ramen in the Kingdom of God in your soul he said some of you didn't hear this I always believe and see is the kingdom of God operates differently to men A is for everyone didn't understand that maybe everyone don't know it A is for always Christ always believe Christ now even in the numbers they got it wrong they teach you in school one plus one equals sorry no no no no I'm talking to brother Jaden right I need to make them vocally in the church one plus one equals did you earlier in the back no your father didn't hear you one plus one equals two everyone uh right they teach you that one plus one equals two in the kingdom of God it's not that way Jesus says that this one plus this one these two shall become ah one plus one is one but please don't go write that now in your tears but I'm just showing you the kingdom of God operates differently Jesus said these two shall become one flesh right I'm gonna take you now into a bit more tricky uh equations because if you attend red and you gave me three Ram now please I know some of you are scratching your head already let's make it easy if I gave you 10 grand and you gave me five grand how much you got left okay you got five grand everyone agrees but in the kingdom of God it's not so in the kingdom of God it tells you when you give amen it shall come back to you press down shake it together and running over good that's how the kingdom of God operates now what happens when you hold back your blessing when you hold back to your seat does the farmer ever lose a seed when he puts it into the ground do you think he's oh I lost my seed did Jesus say bless it it's better to what come on now some of you I'm trying to get you to know the Bible too it's better to what than to see that you receive so when a farmer puts a seed into the ground he's sowing it by faith he's putting it there by faith and when he's putting it there by faith he is not looking at the one seed he put into the ground that's right he is looking at hours so the kingdom of God is multiplication the kingdom of God the kingdom of the world tells you that 10-5 is five the kingdom of God tells you that when you give it's multiplication that you lose nothing yes then it must come back to you even your work going forth from your mouth it shall not return void but it must accomplish the purpose what you must send [Music] without an expectation we don't wait there to see that word return to us the farmer doesn't go every day and re-dick the soil to see if the seed is growing you're so in faith amen and you move on hallelujah amen in fact Jesus teaches us even further that when you are helping one another if your brother says uh can I borrow 200 you give him 200. because in your head you don't want to become a slave to that 200 real because every time you see that brother you are thinking when is he going to give me back the 200 Ram so you become a slave to it and he's so friendly when you're talking to you but yet you think you're talking a lot of stories with me laughing and joking where's my 200. but that's a human nature because and you know why you won't receive the result because you haven't sewn it according to the principles of the kingdom of God yes yes you know the the even the Muslim world and all of these people who do good deeds they know that it's a law on the earth they give they sow because they know it's a reward and some people actually give because they know their principle they constantly blessing and giving and giving because they know they see a return they see a return God blesses them God blesses them but we haven't been taught these things we taught that you mustn't talk about money you mustn't talk about finances you mustn't teach the people but Jesus is talking about money Jesus is talking about talents that he gave people and now some just buried it in the ground Jesus said You shall put it to the usury and uninterest even instead of just letting it there amen so son do nothing with it but if you want to understand the kingdom of God you've got to operate in his kingdom now you can so many things you can go just past monetary you can so love to reap love yes you can sow kind words to receive kind words if you know somebody is talking constant ly bad about you you talk the best about them yes you know I never understood many things growing up because sometimes you know you just you just want you as a young person you're growing up and you wonder how the prophet could say like unless you can pray for your worst enemy and don't have that business in them then you realize what level of anointing this man was under that even buddy Paul would say you couldn't tell his enemies from his friends but we are getting to that level now amen amen hallelujah we're the end of all things we are coming to perfection Hallelujah amen glory be to his name so how many of you know what 10 minus five in the kingdom of God is multiplication in the kingdom of God is coming pressed down shaken together and running over amen hallelujah and that is why it says if you want to do good he says do good without sort of Faith first yes sometimes you know there's a need but you hold back you know somebody's in need but you're waiting for them you know it is more blessed to give than to receive even before they ask you you go and give it to them say brother I just the Lord just laid this on my heart this is for you amen amen you got an extra plate of Biryani at home and you you know that thing is going to go in the fridge and the next day there's a possibility of you throwing it away rather pack it in the container and say Brothers there I add some Biryani I thought of you and there's some Biryani for you amen don't think that in the middle of the night you know 12 o'clock come here I'm going to attracted Pizza you already had your portion sow it give it amen amen you shall not lose your blessing you know that's some that's a principle in the in the word of God wherever I read that people came and complained to the Lord and Jesus said no that's fine they won't lose their reward even though it wasn't according to what he was condoning even the when they came to the Apostle Paul did he did he say nevertheless let them go on because the name gospel is being preached amen there's a reward in everything we do for the kingdom of God amen glory be to his name now let's just go here quickly the Bible says there's a curse on the person that curses you right but Jesus says rather bless him to curse you you know why according to the law in the Kingdom they already cursed why do you want to double curse them so Jesus says rather bless them they're cursed him right yeah Jesus the Lord is talking to Abraham so right now all the families of the Earth are blessed because of who no no right now right now all the families on the Earth are blessed Because of You amen amen you are the Royal descendants you should unless you begin to think like this and come up to date we are not reading history we are talking present tense amen All Families on the other blessed because of me amen my presence make a difference wherever I go I walk into a business and the business is blessed yes I walk anywhere and I bless people amen hallelujah hallelujah you keep singing amen amen because you're going to believe that you're going to receive it and you're going to operate in his principles amen glory so right now everyone is blessed on the earth because of you God works with the living didn't the Bible say God is not a god of the Dead he's a god of them living amen you see I'm talking only a Bible this morning because I want you to understand the Bible so everyone is living under the influence right now because of the opening of the word I'm saying it again every religion every denomination every politician everyone even demon powers are operating on the earth now because of the opening of the word if the word wasn't open and it wasn't time and season the photos right I can't write and D L can't be open and Hell follows him come on up please be spiritual and dig deep what I'm telling you we are coming to the climax we are living right at the climax when demon powers religious powers and political Powers upon the Earth and all of them are not in the infancy stage amen they have grown to full maturity yes but all of them can only operate because of the value of the opening of the world because of the word that was opened because of the seals amen amen so what am I saying all of them are living under the influence of the Seven Seals yes yes everyone is living under the influence of the world everyone is prospering amen you say demon powder prospering yes they are waiting waiting war and they are prospering in what they are doing because the Bible says they deceive the entire Earth except those names that are found written in the book in order for them to do that they must be prospering in the Demonic force and attack politicians are prospering Russia is prospering America is prospering all the nations of the Earth are prospering right now August they're fixing to hold brick Cemetery in South Africa bricks currently has five countries hello Rick scandalia five countries you know what brick stands for it's an acronym for Brazil Russia India South Africa and China and South Africa right but if you go and search it out there's another five that wants to join and in August they're going to make a decision whether they're going to let these other five countries become part of brics so then what will they become will there only be five Kings or will there be ten Kings there will be ten Kings so you go read Revelation and you search out the Ten Kings I'm saying considerate I'm saying go search it out for yourself all I gave you was an example you go and see if these things be or not we just come out of what season amen we come out of the pride month July things are heating up this year celebrated across the Earth rainbow amen six and six color rainbow but there's a seventh rainbow over the mighty angel thank you there's a seven color rainbow with these people yes amen so everyone is living and coming to their full potential because of the influence of the opening of The Seven Seals amen after the seals will open the prophet of Revelation 10 sound forth his message and the entire Earth the entire peoples Nations tongues are living under the benefits and influence of the world prior to that nobody had Revelation yeah yeah oh you don't know what I'm telling you right they're all coming out for their interpretation go search Google and see how many hundreds of denominations are telling you who the Antichrist is where did they get that from under the influence of the opening of the world whether they like to believe it or not amen the entire Earth People's National stripes and towns are living under the blessing and influence of the opening of the world that is why you have seen an acceleration in the realm of science amen some of you younger people don't know this but we were 20 years and older would know this that we've seen acceleration in the realm of Science in the last 20 years we didn't have internet laughs we didn't have internet but especially if you tell your son there was nothing such as Internet we didn't have internet we we must take them for to the museum and show them the telephone that we used to use and not even some of us maybe don't even know the other telephones I know the ones where you you know you yeah some know the other one where you are to put this here and they I don't know there's older ones there's older ones right but we've seen an accelerator science the last 20 years why what's happening amen what you see naturally yes is a sign of spiritual that's right amen amen amen hallelujah you've seen an acceleration in science in the last 20 years because there's a rapid acceleration in the spiritual kingdom of God Satan is nothing but a counterfeit yeah why do they accelerate what is what is internet communication information being spread [Music] did he not open up come down to give us communication amen acceleration of communication open communication with the word [Music] that is a counterfeit Revelation 10 the angel comes down to the open book to influence to influence the Earth via communication that is why John is asked to prophesy again through communication and acceleration in communication but now the communication is not from the earth the communication is coming from Heaven to the end so man has been restored back to direct communication like are we finding Abraham and God having direct communication oh come on now we're going back to the root direct communication where we don't have to get the word from denominationalism we can get the word in his purity this is the mind of Christ the message of the hour right amen the message of the hour is not one way one of the ways you can get into the end time prophecies the message of Yahweh is the only way you have to count wire do you think God wasted his time using seven Messengers and now we can bypass the prophet because we understand the opening of the word God is building a continuity building and continuity amen I wish I can get past my second paragraph amen but it runs to a point like you've never seen before like these natural scientists operating on the earth and look at the technology they've given us in order for Rapid communication speech and acceleration in science amen because spiritual astronauts spiritual scientists have gone into the word of God amen and receiving from the mind of God amen what is this amen they are working it's natural scientists are working according to Natural laws but spiritual scientists are working according to spiritual laws amen and what are you doing they are doing the Greater Works so in order to compete now man in this Fallen State that's the rest of the Kingdom now the rest of mankind trying to compare with the Romans 8 19 men put it up trying to compete with this man that all creation is waiting for but they know that man in his normal condition in his Fallen condition can only reach a certain level so they have created something called artificial intelligence yes right now artificial intelligence is a focal point in the scientific world it's because of this sons of God are manifesting on the earth now amen amen come on now yeah because they are trying to compete with the God man they have to get some form of assistance to compete with the God man do you know even right now you can make use of artificial intelligence you can get it to write to an essay you're just gonna put the topic in Chad GP what is it called chat GPT you could put the subject in that thing will type out a word you can tell it how many pages how many words and everything it will write it for you you can even say write it in plain English so they don't know that it was write it in plain English it'll write whatever you say you speak to it you see what I'm saying you speak to it and it will produce back what you said sounds familiar yeah it is a copycat artificial intelligence has gotten the world right now and the world is scared of this technology you'll see even last week the two weeks these uh actors or these scriptwriters were protesting in Hollywood because you can go to chat GPT or there's more maybe there's more advanced AI technology and you can just go type up a product and that thing will produce a script for you so you don't need the imagination of a man to produce a good movie anymore that's what the protest was about that they want to replace them with artificial intelligence so there's no need of scriptwriters and artificial intelligence is progressing to a place where they will replace actors they will take the best features of that person and they will create an artificial person that you will never know that is not a real person acting there so now even the actors are getting worried okay so you're seeing a rapid acceleration an impersonation you're going to see this rapid impersonation in the religious World amongst denominations as well Hallelujah amen amen what are they trying to do trying to compete with sons and daughters who are coming into sonship and Authority now who are coming into the image of priests and kings amen who are having Dominion on the earth now come on now that's about the time you get tired having Dominion on the earth now let me tell you God wants to take care of your situation amen but you keep saying Amen to the word God's going to deliver you right now amen you may feel like you messed up you may feel like you're nothing but God is showing you you all to be conditioned amen creation is even groaning waiting for you amen hallelujah because when God delivers he delivers properly amen thank you when God sets free breaks all chains amen and this artificial intelligence I'm going to say this way is going to impact the world in ways that you and I can't even imagine so they're trying to compete with sons and daughters who are coming upon the earth now amen coming into sonship Authority having dominion over the Earth man in the image and likeness of God and our intelligence is not artificial amen hallelujah you you have got like intelligence not artificial intelligence what's artificial something faith they don't know what to do to compete with this man that's here on the Earth that they have to create artificial intelligence amen why who has the mind of Christ if you think I'm wrong you have Godlike intelligence you tell tell your neighbor now tell them I I have the mind of Christ now when you say that I want you to apply that in everyday life the moment you you operate and you handle any situation from the candle or the flesh point of view you lost the moment you retaliate from the flesh you lost we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness rulers of Darkness where in high places so in the idea in high places can you enter thy place in the flesh how do you enter spiritual places spiritually didn't Ephesians say we are blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places Heavenly places is high places I know we got a lot of students here of the world you'll say brother Brian said Heavenly places believer's position in Christ but the believer's position in Christ is a high place so when we are fighting battles to release words against one another to release words against our children our our brothers our sisters do we release words to fight it or to release words into that atmosphere this is deep teaching now where are we releasing our words where are we releasing the power and the blood of Jesus Amen father I release this word now into the Heavenly atmosphere into spiritual atmosphere and the Earthly atmosphere all around me is changing right now amen amen I know your flesh is not liking this I know your flesh is resisting this but I'm talking to your spirit man right now if you want to operate like this person you've got to operate by the power of your word you've got to break down tear down casting down imaginations amen too many of us have imaginations we think this person don't like me this person said that about me this person this person all focused on what this person said that person said but what we begin to call from is something called a complex so we form a complex about this person and all our interaction and reaction with that person is based out of this complex so we can't get the Victory and we can't get the freedom because out of this complex but you can speak to what you want you can speak what you want to see that's why Jesus says that you do unto others as you would have them do unto amen why are you teaching me the Bible they have the original intelligence they have the mind of Christ and they know what he wants done with the word they have that saith the Lord and the word of God is in there we have the mind of Christ amen I can't be bothered about what you say about me because you are trying to disturb my spirit you are trying to get me out of my heavenly atmosphere you know how much control you must have now I'm going to tell you something right you've seen glimpses of perfect Faith here in this church hello amen you've experienced it this year Glimpse is a perfect Faith now what happens if you lived in the realm all the time not only when you were desperate yes you know what I'm saying amen because the prophet says Jesus lived in this world of perfect faith now most of your testimonies if you go and examine it it was because of its need a situation that Faith rose up in you that you decided to speak to that situation I'm asking you what happens if you lived in that Rhythm all the time oh God yes yes amen forgive me for using you as an example brother Caleb right but here's a brother that saw his car losing oil now because he must have reached a point of desperation to go and find a scripture that wasn't even talking about high engines but it spoke about oil and now the foolish virgins were losing oil and he said Lord I'm not the foolish virgin because how many of you know that not only you are blessed but everything you own the property everything you own in life is blessed I am literally only on my second paragraph but I am going to close right now because I can sense your faith level is high amen but we build it amen now what happens if somebody is in need of spiritual oil what is oil can I have confidence now because my brother has so much of Faith to believe that his car will not lose oil why can't I have confidence in him to use the same faith to pray over you need spiritual oil amen yes see but we think it's beyond us we think it's not it's not true I'm not called for them but but you add a need there you call for it why can't God use you now to touch others amen okay Sisters You prayed over situations you saw the miraculous power of God Amen touch a meal you think God is only limiting you to your husband to your to your own situation God can use you did Paul have co-workers in the gospel we need to fitly frame the gifts in the church that you become a valuable part in the body of Christ that we rely on you we are depending on your prayer right so next time somebody is sick can I have confidence to call you and say right brother lands on this person and pray yes if you've seen the glimpse of Faith once why can't you bring it in operation again yes yes and these were not ordinary miracles hello this is going beyond the ordinary amen yes can I say these are third two manifestations and I'm asking you if you can only live in that world of perfect faith what kind of person will this be the image coming on the earth yes yes not only when there's a need even before there's a need you say how do I do that father your daily prayer Lord even now Lord Jesus I pray for the people in the church they're going through situations trials father I pray Lord and I I start to resist and I bind and I curse some of you have seen situations change in your homes and you don't even know how but there's somebody on the knees praying every night I'm praying for you amen you are praying for one another yes sometimes you don't even have the faith because the situation is so great and so massive in your mind you don't know how you've been dealing with the situation but you've seen stronger with great you've seen chains break yes no that's the power of Prayer I am saying you need to realize your position in the body of Christ you can go read the quote let's just read our quotes and we'll finish I've got two quotes and maybe this will help you amen until we come back again blessed be the name of the Lord look like we have to have church in sessions now we have one session and we break we come back for another session amen so the prophet is talking about the word being restored back to the church now right it's not a Protestant Doctrine a Catholic Doctrine but we as Pentecostals integrated with man-made theology talking about the word how it was into bread that when you show somebody baptism they tell you about our church baptizes this way but our pastor allows women preachers you see what the property is meaning here they've taken the word of God and interpret it with man-made theology right you see where we're getting no wonder God can't set Revival got nothing to build on so here's the important part I want to get to he'll take individuals and build it on them individuals and declare them before the world who stay with us who stay with the word right that's in condemnation by representation preach 1960 then beautiful quotes and the stature for perfect man God never sent me to build organizations God sent me to build who is God building us individually as the focus changed from like just a corporate anointing and the focus of Spotlight has been going into individual lives now God Christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the what and the dwelling place of the Spirit by what amen so can you have the spirit without feeding on the word how is he doing it they are becoming the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the spirit the Holy Spirit by his and then he goes on to say how is he going to build up the individual to the place by his by his word one more and he just continues his quote not build an organization to a greater denomination but build an individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea what's the idea is it an imagination is it in the back the God had this thought in his mind what's an idea it's something in him God gave you an imagination God had imagination God had creativity in him so he's telling you that God's thoughts got the attributes now it was in God's thoughts all along to build you build an individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's the Romans 8 19 man coming on the earth now that's the idea add to your faith virtue to your virtual knowledge well now you're coming to a place let's give the Lord a good angle of Praise And We Stand Together amen amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen so we only went to the third verse of the chapter but you go home and read it amen you go read chapter 12 follow Abraham's Journey it's very beautiful story very powerful story a one-man submission I'm gonna say this maybe it's going to help somebody was God willing to give Abraham everything is everyone paying attention God is willing to give you everything in this life you just read in Genesis chapter 12 right you go read it at home God was willing to give Abraham everything hold nothing back right now if we take in progression of time did God give us his best does God give us his best was Jesus Christ the best right that John 3 16 now ask yourself can I give God my best if he gave me the best if God is not going to hold back anything for me yes why can't I Surrender everything to him yes why do you have to see up seasons of dryness in my life Seasons where I fall and failed why can't I give him everything [Music] can you give God your best God is willing to give everything to you he says in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thee he's talking to a man who can't have children but God is not focused on your situation the problem was Abraham and Sarah couldn't have children but God is looking past your problem and he's saying in multiplying I will multiply you what is your problem what is your situation God is saying I'm going to turn it around amen now God does God make this promise to Abraham in an impossible situation if anyone's looking at Abraham that it's impossible what God is saying that he can't have children God is making these promises in the midst of an impossible situation you see President no matter how hard life gets whatever happens in life no matter how impossible the situation is God is making promises to you in the midst of your impossible situation and he's saying if you trust me if you surrender all to me I will give you everything in this life not only in the materially naturally but I will bless you spiritually you will become a spiritual blessing to others if you can only trust my way now remember what we are saying the final voice listen to the voice of God we didn't even get to the thoughtship but you are the final voice don't shut the voice of God when he's speaking to you you are going to be a blessing to others so God is promising you blessings in a possible situation showing you that God don't look to the scene God looks to the Unseen amen does God look to the scene does God look at the condition and operate according to the condition no now we created in His image and likeness so do we look at the problem and focus on the problem what is seen or do we speak the Unseen amen that's how we operate amen glory be to his name now God wants to deliver you this morning God wants to break chains God wants to break strongholds God wants to change behave real thoughts and patterns yes and the way we've been trained in this life are we willing to surrender and say Lord have you awaited me this morning build me up a calling you said you're going to build an individual you're going to build me to be a Powerhouse a dwelling place for the Spirit by the word Strip Me of everything I know and Build Me Up by Your Word Hallelujah [Music] thank you [Music] what's in one area in your life that you're holding back God wants that area is it your time is it your faithfulness in serving him [Music] I give it all one more time sing I Surrender [Music] yes [Music] I give it all being alone amen amen amen amen hallelujah glory be your name email we can turn the camera off amen God bless you Lord be with you
