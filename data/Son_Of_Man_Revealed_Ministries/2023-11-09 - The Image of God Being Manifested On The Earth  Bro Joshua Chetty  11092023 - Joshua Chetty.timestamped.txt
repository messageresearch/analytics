[18:08] Holy Ghost he's put the life back into
[18:10] the church aren't you glad to be a part
[18:13] of it amen just want to read one quote
[18:14] amen hallelujah amen while you're
[18:17] getting the quote up amen want to
[18:18] welcome amen my father and my mother
[18:21] amen Nicholson let's welcome them in the
[18:23] house of the Lord amen good you have
[18:25] your back amen praise the Lord amen
[18:29] Hallelujah they couldn't make it they
[18:30] were trying to make it for the birthday
[18:31] but they had some engine trouble now I'm
[18:33] going to encourage you with a with a
[18:35] very powerful testimony amen I'd like to
[18:37] call Brother Caleb but I don't know if
[18:39] you might feel a bit uh but let's share
[18:41] it amen on so brother Caleb had engine
[18:43] trouble and he was losing oil in his
[18:47] car so he took it you know you book it
[18:49] into these un to H and there's three
[18:52] test you got to do right three test so
[18:55] he went for the first two test and he
[18:57] confirmed yes your car is losing oil and
[19:01] it's best to get rid of the car so he
[19:03] even spoke to me after one service and
[19:05] he said I'm coming to see your work I
[19:06] think I'm going to trade the sin and
[19:08] probably get a celos or something like
[19:10] that so but you know we've been
[19:12] preaching Faith we've been preaching the
[19:14] supernatural amen and his testimony to
[19:16] me was why is the pastor preaching in
[19:18] this way and you remember I've been
[19:20] telling you find a scripture that
[19:21] pertains to your problem and hold on to
[19:24] that scripture so he very uniquely found
[19:28] the scripture where it talks about 10
[19:30] virgins and he said Lord I'm not the
[19:33] foolish virgin so why is my possession
[19:35] losing
[19:36] oil amen you see he can make the word to
[19:39] work for you
[19:41] practical he says I'm not the foolish
[19:43] virgins so you know everything that
[19:45] Abraham had and all his possessions were
[19:47] blessed so he says why is my car losing
[19:49] oil I'm not the foolish virgin am so he
[19:52] decided to pray over the car amen then
[19:54] he took it so remember he passed the
[19:56] first two pools now the third test it
[19:58] was was go for but under the third pool
[20:00] there's something greater there amen yes
[20:02] so he goes for that test and he put it
[20:05] on all the machines and the mechanic
[20:08] tells him I don't know what you did but
[20:10] this car is not losing oil
[20:11] anymore amen who touched that engine
[20:14] amen who prayed for that engine amen
[20:17] hallelujah how God can work on engines
[20:20] amen how God can restore missing limbs
[20:22] how God can heal he can deliver he can
[20:24] set free amen and he's still driving the
[20:26] car you put any oil in it now
[20:29] running normal amen praise the Lord so
[20:32] amen why I'm saying that the the engine
[20:34] light and everything was coming on and
[20:36] all of these things but we want to
[20:37] cancel those lights amen yes amen yes we
[20:40] are the
[20:41] light amen hallelujah the only light
[20:45] that should be coming on Amen is the
[20:47] Gospel Light amen amen so we want to
[20:49] speak to that engine speak to all of
[20:51] those things and tell it to behave
[20:53] itself amen amen praise the Lord praise
[20:56] the Lord amen so
[20:58] so my announcement here was that brother
[21:00] Caleb is not here but he is here amen
[21:02] praise the Lord amen then brother s is
[21:04] not sure he's got the flu amen we want
[21:06] to remember him in prayer amen that the
[21:07] Lord can touch him deliver him set him
[21:10] free amen hallelujah amen just want to
[21:13] read this quote very quickly and here
[21:16] the prophet is saying
[21:18] now and I was thinking can I read from
[21:21] here or put it back
[21:24] now and I was just thinking a few
[21:26] moments ago upon the subject of Science
[21:30] and I was just thinking out that science
[21:33] how they are taking the natural man and
[21:35] how he's went into research from the
[21:37] fall of the natural and what he has
[21:42] done
[21:45] amen and how little the spiritual man
[21:48] has progressed in the kingdom of God and
[21:51] I was thinking that the natural man went
[21:53] out at the Unseen of his eye and pulled
[21:55] an atom down out of the sky and split
[21:57] that atom in two that destroys human
[22:00] life and if the natural man that knows
[22:02] nothing of God and cannot know nothing
[22:05] of God except he be converted then his
[22:07] soul becomes alive with the supernatural
[22:10] if he could if he could do that in the
[22:12] natural realm what are the man of God to
[22:15] be doing amen yes what are Daughters of
[22:17] God to be doing amen he says my my
[22:20] friends the church is so far
[22:23] behind now I'm reading that as past
[22:25] tense because we are catching up amen
[22:28] amen hallelujah we are progressing in
[22:30] the things of God he said let's pray my
[22:32] that God will move his church up the
[22:35] natural man with the natural resources
[22:37] is getting greater results than people
[22:39] are that call themselves
[22:41] Christian let's press into the Unseen
[22:44] amen the blessings are yours they for
[22:46] you amen I if you say the blessings are
[22:49] for me amen praise the Lord amen
[22:51] hallelujah praise the Lord praise the
[22:52] Lord praise the Lord amen so I just want
[22:54] to call amen for the pet to come forward
[22:56] and greet the church amen hallelujah
[22:59] amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[23:02] amen praise the
[23:05] Lord amen let's give my hand as he comes
[23:07] forward amen praise the
[23:10] [Applause]
[23:12] Lord hallelujah bless
[23:16] you God bless you a God bless you Saints
[23:22] Living God the Lord it set me a
[23:25] privilege to
[23:26] be
[23:32] am I do something wrong
[23:35] no God bless you and um I've just got a
[23:38] quote maybe to share with you amen
[23:41] before the preacher comes I I want to
[23:42] steal these thunder cuz he's got the
[23:45] lightning amen so I trust that God will
[23:48] certainly bless you and
[23:50] U um sorry that I was late for the
[23:54] party but by God's grace all things will
[23:57] work together for the good to them that
[23:59] love the
[24:00] Lord so um I had to go via Samaria
[24:05] Johannesburg before I could come to
[24:08] deran amen Jerusalem Hallelujah so may
[24:12] God richly bless you and I thank the
[24:14] Lord for his grace that he's bestowed
[24:16] upon us that we made it in limp mode
[24:20] amen and uh how many of us are still in
[24:23] LMP mode and by God's grace I trust that
[24:26] we will shut down all the lights amen
[24:30] because every light uh on the dashboard
[24:32] was on as it was coming up and uh the
[24:36] Pastor said that he was so surprised to
[24:38] see me and that must have been by faith
[24:40] that I came up amen and I said well
[24:42] that's what it agitate because the
[24:44] mechanic wasn't available that was
[24:46] promised and then um there was no
[24:49] Diagnostics done and that's why we thank
[24:52] God that he is diagnosed the case amen
[24:55] hallelujah and there's nothing that we
[24:57] have to do yes but just simply cling on
[24:59] to that cross am because the cross is
[25:02] where we have been saved by by grace and
[25:06] His abundant grace and I thank the Lord
[25:08] for that so we we came into Durban Amen
[25:12] on three cylinders Justified Sanctified
[25:17] and baptized with the Holy Ghost
[25:19] Hallelujah so we have to get into step
[25:23] amen amen because if we're not into step
[25:25] we are still chugging on cylinders
[25:27] there's no Dynamics then yes and that's
[25:30] why we just need the Dynamics which is
[25:33] that fire power that ignition to spark
[25:37] whatever is there in that octane or
[25:40] whatever in that fuel that octane needs
[25:42] to be have that spark so that we can
[25:45] vroom out of here hallelujah we need
[25:48] faith for the Rapture amen now friends
[25:51] if we don't believe in Divine Healing
[25:54] it's based on the same thing that's
[25:56] right so if we don't have faith for
[25:58] Divine Healing we cannot even believe
[26:01] for a change of the body and this body
[26:04] needs to be changed not overnight or the
[26:09] next day but it will be in a twinkling
[26:11] of an eye it's not a wink Hallelujah so
[26:15] stop winking at the
[26:17] Devil because winking at the Devil
[26:20] brings your sickness brings in epilepsy
[26:24] brings in all kinds of Mind battles but
[26:27] once you stand on the word of God that's
[26:31] where your faith begins amen it's
[26:33] written amen have you ever told the
[26:36] devil it's written because when you say
[26:39] to the devil it's written he will leave
[26:41] you for a
[26:43] season and that's why we thank God we
[26:47] need to come into that season where we
[26:50] can believe all things are possible
[26:53] hallelujah hallelujah so he's saying now
[26:55] how do you how do you know that brother
[26:57] P you know when God uh comes my way by
[27:03] allowing sickness and diseases upon you
[27:06] you know that's for a reason to glorify
[27:09] God not to glorify your faith but to
[27:13] glorify your faith in God and that's
[27:16] where we need to have our faith today is
[27:19] that we win the Rapture or when the last
[27:22] Trump sounds the dead in Christ shall
[27:25] rise first so doesn't matter if you are
[27:29] dead or alive by that faith that you
[27:31] went in the ground if that seed is alive
[27:34] it must come up amen it's not possible
[27:38] that it must lay down amen praise the
[27:41] Lord so I'm not the preacher here this
[27:43] morning but you know when you get
[27:46] something like this amen and something
[27:49] just kicks in so forgive me amen so may
[27:53] God bless
[27:54] you and I'm going to read the quotation
[27:59] and I trust that the Lord will certainly
[28:00] bless
[28:04] you it's a quotation from the
[28:08] Bible and then uh just a portion uh
[28:12] where the Prophet
[28:18] preaches the Bible says Make a Joyful
[28:22] Noise unto God all he
[28:25] lands sing forth the honor of his
[28:29] name and make his praise glorious
[28:33] amen say unto God how terrible art thou
[28:37] in thy works and through the greatness
[28:40] of thy power shall thine enemies submit
[28:44] themselves unto
[28:47] thee all the Earth shall worship thee
[28:50] and shall sing unto thee they shall sing
[28:53] to thy name Salah and he says come and
[28:57] see the works of God he is terrible in
[29:01] his doing toward the children of men he

[42:29] his path oh yes Lord in the part of his
[42:31] word then he's obligated to fulfill
[42:33] every part of the word amen amen yes

[43:25] context this morning image the word
[43:27] image put the word image in your
[43:30] conscious now God is saying let us make
[43:32] man in our image so that image has to be
[43:36] God amen amen nothing less yes

[43:49] amen over the fish of the sea over over
[43:53] the fowl of the air and over the cattle
[43:55] and over all the Earth and over every
[43:58] creeping thing that creeped upon the
[44:00] Earth so God created man in his own
[44:04] image he never he never took you and
[44:06] said let me make you an image after the
[44:08] Angels or after something else but after
[44:12] his own amen praise the Lord because in
[44:16] the back part of God's
[44:18] mind you always worthy amen he never
[44:21] began in the first place you always was
[44:22] with God in the back part of his mind
[44:25] God had an image of how he's going to
[44:27] project himself through his family
[44:29] through his sons and daughters amen and
[44:32] it was wasn't going to be anything less
[44:34] than God being reproduced amen his own
[44:37] image in the image of God created him
[44:40] male and female created his them and God
[44:43] blessed them and God said unto them be
[44:47] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[44:51] Earth and sub jewi yes and have dominion
[44:55] over the the fish of the sea and over
[44:57] the fowl of the air and over every
[44:59] living thing that moveth upon the Earth

[45:04] dominion you going to now be ruler over
[45:07] all these things yes upon the Earth amen
[45:10] and you're going to be fruitful and
[45:12] you're going to multiply and if you are

[45:21] every if you are you going to be M
[45:23] you're going to multiply through the
[45:24] spoken word yes amen amen hallelujah
[45:27] also turn to the Book of Revelation
[45:36] 13:1 and I beheld another Beast coming
[45:40] out of the earth and he had two arms
[45:42] like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and
[45:45] he exercised all the power of the first
[45:47] Beast before
[45:49] him and causeth the Earth and them which
[45:52] dwell therein to worship the first Beast
[45:55] whose deadly wound was healed and he do
[45:58] doth great wonders so that he make it
[46:00] fire come down from heaven on the earth
[46:04] in the sight of men and deceiveth them
[46:08] that dwell on the Earth by the means of
[46:10] those Miracles which he had power to do
[46:13] in the sight of the Beast saying to them
[46:16] that dwell on the earth that they should
[46:19] make an image to the beasts now you read
[46:22] the about the first image that God want
[46:25] us to In His Image but here now the
[46:28] second beast has to be in the image of
[46:30] the first Beast here Satan's counterfeit
[46:34] now God knew that he's going to have
[46:37] people in His image so Satan must have
[46:39] people in His image as well am man he
[46:41] must have a system in His image and he
[46:44] had to give life unto the image of the
[46:47] Beast that the image of the Beast should
[46:49] both speak and cause that as many as
[46:52] would not worship the image of the Beast
[46:54] should be killed
[46:56] so he wanted to have power yes by
[47:00] speaking and he caus it all both small
[47:02] and great rich and poor free and born to
[47:04] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[47:06] their
[47:07] foreheads and
[47:10] that no man might buy or sell save he
[47:13] that had the Mark or the name of the
[47:15] Beast or the number of his name amen

[49:21] Image in his likeness

[52:31] income to pay those debt which you never
[52:33] will get out of because you got to

[52:52] Earth meant to have authority over the
[52:55] Earth amen and because of the fall of

[53:43] the gift hallelujah
[53:45] amen have we received this all these

[53:56] in the presence of the son to be ripened
[53:59] but there comes a time when you come to
[54:02] maturity there comes a time when you
[54:04] cannot be in infant change anymore
[54:07] because why the image of God must be
[54:10] manifested on the earth and what is the
[54:13] image of God it is Jesus Christ amen
[54:17] because the world need to see the
[54:20] resurrected Jesus Christ amen praise the
[54:23] Lord amen thank you Jesus thank you

[55:47] that raised the Dead the one that cast
[55:49] The Devil where is the god of the Bible
[55:53] Hallelujah then you could tell them
[55:54] about God sent a prophet William
[55:57] brandham this is what he did these are
[55:59] the great Miracles that took place upon

[56:51] scene now what made us believe this
[56:54] message

[1:00:12] things from the land they to go fight
[1:00:14] and slay the enemy they to have no mercy
[1:00:17] for the enemy amen God never called us
[1:00:20] to be mer to be sorrowful for the sinful
[1:00:23] conditions that we had for sinful past
[1:00:25] that we had he never called us to be
[1:00:27] sorrowful over but go and drive it

[1:00:45] and work that land they are to cultivate
[1:00:48] that land but everything they touch
[1:00:51] prospered amen amen yes Lord so when you
[1:00:55] take God's word when you go now into the
[1:00:57] land of his word and you start taking
[1:00:59] the word and you start now utilizing
[1:01:02] that word cultivating that word amen it
[1:01:05] will prosper amen amen you have success
[1:01:08] in his word amen but if you just want to
[1:01:12] sit back and said no I'm happy I'm
[1:01:14] getting fed by the preachers I'm happy
[1:01:16] with that God didn't ask for that yes
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:22] amen the book of Colossians
[1:01:25] 115
[1:01:28] says who is the image of the invisible
[1:01:32] God the first born of every creature for
[1:01:36] by him were all things created that are
[1:01:39] in heaven and that are in Earth yes
[1:01:44] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:01:47] Thrones or dominions or
[1:01:49] principalities or Powers all things were
[1:01:52] created by Him and before him amen and
[1:01:56] he is before all things and by him all
[1:01:59] things consist and he is the head of the
[1:02:02] body of the church who is the beginning
[1:02:04] the first born from the dead that in all
[1:02:07] things he might have the preeminence
[1:02:09] amen for it pleased the father in him
[1:02:12] should all fullness dwell and Romans
[1:02:15] 8:29 says for whom he did for no he also
[1:02:19] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:02:22] image of his son that he might be the
[1:02:25] first born among many Brethren
[1:02:30] yes so you see that God wants us to come
[1:02:35] into this image
[1:02:37] amen and that image is Christ yes yes
[1:02:40] amen because remember
[1:02:43] Mary did not trade Christ she was only
[1:02:47] the carrier yes of the created one God
[1:02:51] created in Mary the complete embryo yes
[1:02:53] she was just the the carrier she's not
[1:02:55] the Creator yes and you are just

[1:03:07] do with your human abilities amen amen

[1:03:22] from within the flesh something must
[1:03:24] burst forth amen oh yes amen Christ must
[1:03:27] burst forth that when the people look at
[1:03:29] you when this world looks at you they
[1:03:31] can't see you amen all they see is
[1:03:34] Christ in you Am Lord the world might be
[1:03:36] so confused amen that when I look at
[1:03:38] this person all I see is Jesus Christ
[1:03:41] everything that the Bible speaks about

[1:04:18] praise the Lord there's going to be a
[1:04:20] resurrection one of these days amen I'm

[1:04:24] days

[1:04:30] are different species Hallelujah that is
[1:04:33] why you have to be born again yes that
[1:04:35] is why we cry out you must be born again

[1:04:43] nature the first Nature by sin it puts
[1:04:46] your flesh body in this earth amen and
[1:04:48] his flesh body is everything against God
[1:04:50] amen amen hallelujah the first the first
[1:04:53] body is a beastly nature amen but when
[1:04:57] you have that new birth amen hallelujah
[1:05:00] oh it brings forth the spirit man and
[1:05:03] now it subdues this Earth amen that
[1:05:06] Spirit man must have dominion over this
[1:05:09] Earth amen hallelu amen that Spirit man
[1:05:11] needs to have dominion that's the image
[1:05:14] amen that's the image of Christ that has

[1:05:27] must become the tail the spirit man
[1:05:29] becomes the head of this body amen
[1:05:32] subdue it amen and then this body is
[1:05:36] being influenced by powers and
[1:05:38] principalities and rules of Darkness
[1:05:41] because Satan have got the medium now
[1:05:43] through the fourth dimension through
[1:05:45] communication Satan has spread forth

[1:05:50] upon the Earth using every communication

[1:09:57] everything that you are

[1:10:02] you're doing you do it heartily to the
[1:10:05] Lord
[1:10:06] hallelujah you know it's like Caleb's fa
[1:10:09] with Joshua and the true meaning of
[1:10:11] Caleb in the Hebrew tongue not that in
[1:10:13] the Greek the Greek means dog but in the
[1:10:16] Hebrew tongue it means wholeheartedly
[1:10:19] yes that is the true meaning of Caleb

[1:10:44] lot didn't bring him his Blessing until

[1:10:54] blessing and every son and daughter
[1:10:58] coming after that must be separated from
[1:11:01] all unbelief
[1:11:03] yes yes
[1:11:05] Lord because the things that you are
[1:11:08] receiving are art for the people of the
[1:11:09] flesh to believe absolutely yes that's
[1:11:12] right because these things are paradoxes

[1:24:43] also a time and
[1:24:44] season when she had to move yes to

[1:34:27] Spirit gets that right down to you amen
[1:34:30] now you're the little flock that's why
[1:34:32] through the week praying and asking God
[1:34:34] I choose the St to show you where we
[1:34:36] stand believing in him amen you cannot
[1:34:40] believe in him until you come in
[1:34:42] him or he comes in you then you
[1:34:45] believing in him then you have eternal
[1:34:47] life you're believing on him until you
[1:34:49] receive eternal life then eternal life
[1:34:51] is gone life in you then you believing
[1:34:54] in amen am Y in me I in you that ye may
[1:34:58] be one father even as you are you and I
[1:35:02] are one God in Christ Christ in the
[1:35:05] church amen just as we are one so they
[1:35:09] be one and how can you be one if you
[1:35:12] abide in me my words in you see abide my
[1:35:16] words in you then ask what you will for
[1:35:19] it isn't you no more it's the word that
[1:35:22] in you and the word is God Amen so when
[1:35:26] you have the word abiding in you which
[1:35:27] is Christ abiding in you when you asking
[1:35:30] now of that same word it will he must
[1:35:33] Grant it to you amen because it's not
[1:35:36] you it's him amen it's his words and
[1:35:40] he's obligated to the words amen that's
[1:35:43] what the proph of God says if you want
[1:35:45] God to do something then you stay in
[1:35:47] God's part that he's obligated to you
[1:35:49] yes but you come out of his part which
[1:35:51] is his word then God is not obligated to
[1:35:54] you amen but if you want something from
[1:35:56] God you stay within his word in the
[1:35:58] confines of his word yes but once you
[1:36:01] come out of his word you already feel
[1:36:03] condemned you won't be able to even ask
[1:36:05] him yes unless you're an unbeliever who
[1:36:09] has no remorse and just once and once
[1:36:11] and once he just like the the
[1:36:14] denomination they just want and want and
[1:36:17] want from God but they don't want to be
[1:36:18] part of him they don't want him in her
[1:36:21] they don't want to take up his name they
[1:36:23] don't want to be obedient to his word
[1:36:25] but they just want the
[1:36:27] benefits of the atonements but they
[1:36:30] don't want to be part of the atonment
[1:36:33] they don't want the the person that gave
[1:36:34] the atonement to be part of them that's
[1:36:37] right but they only want the benefits
[1:36:39] but they are enjoying the benefits
[1:36:41] because the rain falls on the just and
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:44] unjust but why are we
[1:36:47] deprived why are we deprived because
[1:36:49] it's falling because of you yeah yes the
[1:36:51] rain is falling for the just amen so
[1:36:54] don't look at them and say God is
[1:36:55] blessing them yes they are going and
[1:36:57] claiming your blessing right it's
[1:36:59] falling for you because you see some of
[1:37:02] them they learned the law of God yes
[1:37:05] they sold into the kingdom and I'm not
[1:37:07] talking only material sewing they're
[1:37:08] sewing their time they're investing in
[1:37:10] they're taking the right scriptures the
[1:37:12] right things that they need and they're
[1:37:13] using it and they're getting those
[1:37:15] benefits but it's actually meant for you
[1:37:18] amen they are doing it to the wrong
[1:37:20] motives yes
[1:37:21] they are doing it lusting after the
[1:37:23] thing they want to do it to to to follow
[1:37:26] to be blessed only your material things
[1:37:28] to be Covetous right when God wants to
[1:37:30] bless you he doesn't want you to bless
[1:37:32] you to be a Covetous he wants to bless
[1:37:34] you he wants to bless you so you can be
[1:37:36] a blessing and others so that you can
[1:37:39] first bless his kingdom you can first
[1:37:41] bless his people amen because that's one
[1:37:44] of the secrets of God's blessing if you
[1:37:46] want to be blessed he said first bring
[1:37:48] into my store test me amen that's the
[1:37:51] one scripture God say test me then he
[1:37:53] says You must now give unto others he
[1:37:57] said give to the poor give to the needy
[1:37:59] God is showing you the things and
[1:38:01] remember we we taught you the the the
[1:38:03] meth of God when you give it's not
[1:38:08] separating yes when you give it's
[1:38:11] multiplying it's
[1:38:13] multiplication and that goes for
[1:38:15] material things or spiritual things it's
[1:38:18] always multiplying it just when a
[1:38:21] preacher is preaching out putting that
[1:38:23] effort to go and study to to wait upon
[1:38:25] the Lord and pre he's giving out but
[1:38:27] he's actually multiplying because the
[1:38:29] Holy Spirit come down and
[1:38:31] replenishes hallelujah
[1:38:34] amen so it takes a part on you though
[1:38:37] amen you can't just say God has blessed
[1:38:40] me with all his Blessing and I'm not
[1:38:42] taking the step of Faith amen you must
[1:38:44] take that step of Faith to go do your
[1:38:46] part yes it must take a work on your
[1:38:48] part
[1:38:50] yes
[1:38:52] you got a friend that's in hospital you
[1:38:54] got a family member that's sick now you
[1:38:56] you're sitting at home you praying for
[1:38:58] him but the scripture is Mark
[1:38:59] 16 the said go lay hands on the S they
[1:39:02] shall recover am these are unbel your
[1:39:05] family members that unbelievers now the
[1:39:07] reason why that they maybe they in
[1:39:09] sickness but God want to manifest
[1:39:10] himself maybe God want to show it's a
[1:39:13] time now God wants to demonstrate that
[1:39:16] these are people that maybe you didn't
[1:39:17] look at them right maybe you thought
[1:39:19] what they believing but yet I'm going to
[1:39:21] show that I am with them amen amen he
[1:39:23] said if you don't believe these things
[1:39:25] believe the works that amen so maybe you
[1:39:28] never believed all the things they told
[1:39:30] you all these years but now believe the
[1:39:32] works that they do amen so God is going
[1:39:34] to present these opportunities to
[1:39:37] you yes that's right amen yes
[1:39:43] right I'm trying to
[1:39:48] find the quote where he's talking about
[1:39:51] bully Graham got put in the
[1:39:55] situation bully Graham he
[1:39:59] said he's talking about going and doing
[1:40:02] the greater work yes he said the greater
[1:40:04] work wasn't just preaching the gospel
[1:40:06] yes right so buly is preaching the
[1:40:08] gospel people are getting saved but now
[1:40:11] he got confronted with a situation yes
[1:40:13] but someone said right Jesus did this
[1:40:15] things in the Bible now let's see this
[1:40:19] things
[1:40:21] they said you can't just preaching doing
[1:40:24] the Greater Works is now having what
[1:40:26] Jesus did you must do it
[1:40:28] also that is The Showdown yes yes he
[1:40:32] saying you you you are preaching about
[1:40:34] Jesus amen you're preaching about Jesus
[1:40:37] but where is these Greater Works that's
[1:40:39] right oh sorry where is what Jesus did
[1:40:41] in the Bible I can't see it now your
[1:40:43] claim to be have the message of the hour
[1:40:46] we claim to be going in a Rapture but
[1:40:48] where is the work of Jesus Christ amen
[1:40:51] that's right we must see it amen you're
[1:40:53] claim to believe this Prophet William
[1:40:54] brandham yes William brandham all see
[1:40:57] God through him but where are the works
[1:41:00] that William random did where are the
[1:41:02] things
[1:41:04] amen amen praise the
[1:41:11] Lord amen he
[1:41:17] said two lights can shine at the same
[1:41:20] time
[1:41:22] amen there can be a church light and
[1:41:24] God's light shine at the same time it
[1:41:27] got to be God's light putting out the
[1:41:29] church life
[1:41:31] yes so if the church world now is coming
[1:41:34] to the stage
[1:41:36] and expanding we can't be keeping quiet
[1:41:39] that's right God has given us the time
[1:41:41] to say prophesy again amen and that's
[1:41:45] how you put out the church life and
[1:41:47] that's exactly what's taking place today
[1:41:48] God is separating churchism from his is
[1:41:51] light of the promised word of this hour
[1:41:53] that we living in that's the truth for
[1:41:55] you might not want to believe that but
[1:41:58] you just wait and find out if it's so or
[1:42:01] not don't wait you get better in it
[1:42:03] right now until there's a CH chance to
[1:42:06] get
[1:42:06] in the word is light when it's
[1:42:09] Vindicated amen sorry the word is light
[1:42:13] when it's Vindicated until the word it
[1:42:15] promise for the day is Vindicated then
[1:42:18] it's not
[1:42:19] light it cannot be if God said let there
[1:42:22] be light and no sun come in existence
[1:42:25] there is no sign of light but when God
[1:42:27] said let there be light and there was
[1:42:29] light when God promised a messiah
[1:42:31] messiah come then his word was fulfilled
[1:42:34] and he was the light of the hour when he
[1:42:37] promised Noah and he promised the others
[1:42:39] and on
[1:42:43] down there was the light of the hour and
[1:42:47] there is the light of the hour today
[1:42:50] that Jesus Christ is the power of it
[1:42:53] that Jesus Christ in the power of his
[1:42:56] resurrection his word that promised for
[1:42:59] this day am the works that I do shall
[1:43:03] you do also greater than this year shall
[1:43:05] you do for I go to the father Greater
[1:43:07] Works greater things than he do do you
[1:43:10] believe it I believe it seems humble it
[1:43:12] seems like it goes over the top of
[1:43:14] people's head look when he was here on
[1:43:16] Earth how could you do Greater Works he
[1:43:20] said I've trying at that many times more
[1:43:22] by the same thing greater he said in St
[1:43:24] John 14:12 Greater Works than this shall
[1:43:27] you do did you not
[1:43:29] this when he went to make water into
[1:43:32] wine he took water first and already
[1:43:34] created substance and turned it into
[1:43:36] wine when he fed 5,000 people he took a
[1:43:39] fish that once swam in the water broke
[1:43:42] it and in out and multiplied creation he
[1:43:45] took bread at
[1:43:47] once wheat backed into baked into bread
[1:43:50] broke it and H it out to the people and
[1:43:53] it return back again and multiplied
[1:43:55] creation but in the last days where
[1:43:58] there is no sign of creation he speaks
[1:44:01] it into creation am anyhow shows to be
[1:44:05] the same God that was in the beginning
[1:44:07] amen amen he can create squirrels he can
[1:44:10] create whatever he wants to because he
[1:44:13] is God am greater things and this will
[1:44:15] you do for I go unto my father the word
[1:44:18] is infallible and it has to be
[1:44:20] manifested has to be fulfilled greater
[1:44:22] than this shall you do not multiplying
[1:44:25] but speaking out into creation am why to
[1:44:29] come in the hour of the third po
[1:44:31] year because God had to bring man back
[1:44:34] into His Image First and into Dominion
[1:44:36] again and he couldn't bring back to
[1:44:39] Dominion until he went to Calvary yes
[1:44:41] and take off the curse of sin amen and
[1:44:44] then now he bring man into Dominion
[1:44:46] again and he said now you go back to
[1:44:48] what it was in the beginning as in the
[1:44:50] beginning he said let it be let there be
[1:44:53] light and it was light so man can now
[1:44:56] speak into existence and here come a
[1:44:59] prophet of the SC because why the son of
[1:45:01] man ministry again amen amen and now God
[1:45:04] bringing back man into that Dominion
[1:45:07] again back into the correct Adam
[1:45:09] condition that Satan taken away from him
[1:45:11] and he says now speak the word amen amen
[1:45:15] and that was an example in there was
[1:45:17] that son then there must be others
[1:45:18] following amen amen that was a she way
[1:45:21] before us then there must be others
[1:45:23] following that coming back into the
[1:45:26] image again coming back into the minion
[1:45:28] again back into possession again
[1:45:30] speaking
[1:45:32] paradoxes amen amen the power of the
[1:45:35] spoken word which is the Original Seed
[1:45:39] because we come with the original word
[1:45:41] am we have received the original word
[1:45:43] and when we receive the original word
[1:45:45] that is the Original Seed amen and the
[1:45:49] and the Original Seed is the spoken
[1:45:50] spoken word that is the Original Seed
[1:45:52] amen and that is why the sh could not be
[1:45:57] here with the seed because they don't
[1:45:59] want the original it wasn't meant for
[1:46:01] the original word but when you come into
[1:46:03] the original again amen you have the
[1:46:06] power of the spoken word in your
[1:46:08] presence yes but who it is it is Christ
[1:46:10] in you yes it is his word and you are
[1:46:14] just speaking portraying Christ so in
[1:46:16] other words it's not you that speak it
[1:46:18] it's not I that live but Christ live
[1:46:21] so when it comes to the power of the
[1:46:22] spoken word not you that's speaking it's
[1:46:24] that Christ that in you amen that is
[1:46:26] speaking out his own word amen and if he
[1:46:30] speaks out his own word he's obligated
[1:46:32] to his own word he must manifest it must
[1:46:35] come to whatever it said must come to
[1:46:37] pass amen amen CU Christ is one with
[1:46:42] word yes
[1:46:45] amen oh here's the quote here let me
[1:46:47] read it for you how he said
[1:46:49] it he said that's the way it come today
[1:46:53] with many of our people with many of our
[1:46:55] churches we know that the Bible teaches
[1:46:57] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:46:59] today and forever we know that the Bible
[1:47:02] teaches John 14:12 he that believeth on
[1:47:05] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:47:07] Greater Works than this shall you do
[1:47:09] because I go to the father now we've
[1:47:12] been interested in other things not
[1:47:14] taking warning not taking heed we have
[1:47:16] run but not taking heed to the message
[1:47:19] we've gone but didn't know what to tell
[1:47:22] when we get
[1:47:24] there a few days ago when the churches
[1:47:27] of this world when the Christian
[1:47:28] churches were brought to a shame and
[1:47:30] disgrace when the honorable and notable
[1:47:32] and God-fearing servant Billy Graham was
[1:47:35] brought face to face with the Bible he
[1:47:37] had run but had forgotten the message
[1:47:41] when that Madan stood in his face to his
[1:47:43] face and told him if this be the word of
[1:47:45] God let's see you make it manifest he
[1:47:48] had run well great Revival great things
[1:47:51] but when it come to the place he didn't
[1:47:53] have the
[1:47:55] message I am risen from the dead yes I
[1:47:58] am the same yesterday today and forever
[1:48:01] amen we can't be quoting Hebrews
[1:48:04] 13:8 and believing the same message and
[1:48:08] not having the manifestation of it yes
[1:48:11] we cannot say Jesus is the same
[1:48:12] yesterday today and forever and not
[1:48:14] having the manifestation of Jesus
[1:48:17] reproduced through our
[1:48:19] lives Hallelujah so he says running
[1:48:22] physically fine churches many members
[1:48:24] great denomination but that's not the
[1:48:27] key notes Watch What followed and the
[1:48:31] sign shall follow them that
[1:48:33] believe go but didn't know what to
[1:48:37] tell so go into all the world preach the
[1:48:39] gospel right but when you preach the
[1:48:42] gospel signs must follow yes so when
[1:48:45] you're presenting the gospel out to your
[1:48:47] neighbors to your friend to your
[1:48:49] workplace the signs must
[1:48:54] follow God never sent a man L he give
[1:48:57] him something to say God always confirms
[1:49:00] his word go going but not able to tell
[1:49:03] where you get when you get there no
[1:49:06] matter how big your revivals are how big
[1:49:08] your church is how much your
[1:49:10] denomination predominates the other if
[1:49:12] you haven't got something to tell them
[1:49:15] what have you got but a bunch of people
[1:49:17] gathered together like a
[1:49:19] lunch
[1:49:20] we got a message to tell the world Jesus
[1:49:22] is alive he's not dead taking he to the
[1:49:26] message if you don't have that then you
[1:49:29] got a lar yes
[1:49:34] amen he says these works that I do shall
[1:49:37] you do also a greater than this shall
[1:49:39] you do I took a fish to make a f to make
[1:49:42] a fish you don't even have to have a
[1:49:45] fish he's still God he's still the same
[1:49:48] son the same Son of God to take a fish
[1:49:51] of a fish it's the same Son of God today
[1:49:54] these works I do
[1:49:56] shall shall you also even greater than
[1:49:59] this shall you will you do it will be
[1:50:01] magnified yes greater than this shall
[1:50:04] you do and people refuse to see it the
[1:50:07] Greater Works
[1:50:10] amen so look at where we are now amen
[1:50:14] let's
[1:50:15] take diagnosis of ourselves of our own
[1:50:19] selves we received the mechanics all
[1:50:21] these years we received the word all
[1:50:24] these years then go God has come down
[1:50:27] and brought us to a stage where now the
[1:50:29] focus was on us on our own selves yes
[1:50:33] getting our Earth's rights yeah and
[1:50:35] telling us now you need to subdue the
[1:50:37] Earth because the earth now is the
[1:50:40] problem yes you you was meant to have
[1:50:42] dominion over this Earth You was only
[1:50:45] put in this flesh body because of the
[1:50:46] first
[1:50:48] condition but under your new bir words I
[1:50:51] put my spirit in you and my spirit in
[1:50:54] you will make you now bring this flesh
[1:50:57] man under subjection amen bring this
[1:50:59] Earth this nature this old nature the
[1:51:02] sticky nature under
[1:51:03] subjection have dominion over it it
[1:51:07] cannot have dominion over you because
[1:51:09] the moment you let it have dominion over
[1:51:10] you it will bring you in a backl
[1:51:12] condition amen it will it will feed
[1:51:15] itself it'll be it'll
[1:51:17] overpower the spirit man in you
[1:51:21] but you want to feed the the spirit of
[1:51:23] man
[1:51:24] more but God has been taking us through
[1:51:28] these things through these years yes
[1:51:29] through these N9
[1:51:31] months taking us to separate from the
[1:51:34] things of the flesh things that will
[1:51:36] defile this
[1:51:37] body what is that things that take away
[1:51:40] the time of God yes amen your time with
[1:51:44] the worldly thing your time with that
[1:51:47] little has presented to you
[1:51:50] because as we said Satan is working
[1:51:52] through communication he's communicating
[1:51:54] things through the media through social
[1:51:56] networks to the people that surround you
[1:51:59] your educational system he's got your
[1:52:01] mind so
[1:52:03] inre because why he is this got the
[1:52:07] people trapped around the world he's got
[1:52:09] his own to bring his system in place he
[1:52:12] had to bring he to trap everybody
[1:52:14] because why when Nimrod was on the earth
[1:52:17] in the time of Babylon Nimrod come from
[1:52:20] the lineage of M from Kush but we know
[1:52:23] that that that that lineage comes forth
[1:52:26] it was a serpent seed lineage and it was
[1:52:29] serpent Satan's
[1:52:31] lineage to bring forth the and
[1:52:34] infiltrate the human race and he began
[1:52:36] to trap the people in his things so just
[1:52:39] like that now Satan has got the people
[1:52:41] in his
[1:52:43] web he's got you trapped to your in
[1:52:45] everything that you do right now okay if
[1:52:48] the economy crash all your money is the
[1:52:50] bank what's going to happen to your
[1:52:51] money your property will be gone because
[1:52:53] it can take away your property that's
[1:52:55] what the Bible says in the last days you
[1:52:57] can't buy you can't sell you can't trade
[1:52:59] it's coming to the
[1:53:00] time but thank God he's given us his
[1:53:03] promises and before he comes to the Crux
[1:53:05] we'll be gone yes but we are
[1:53:08] experiencing these things we can see the
[1:53:10] things coming in but he's given us the
[1:53:12] promises of his word he said ask what
[1:53:14] you will seek he first the kingdom of
[1:53:17] God and his righteousness yes and all
[1:53:19] the thing shall be added unto
[1:53:21] you when the time was famine was there
[1:53:24] and Elijah was there on the scene then
[1:53:27] he went to the widow woman and he said
[1:53:29] make me make me a bread a cake first
[1:53:32] amen the last bit of substance that she
[1:53:35] had it took it to was obedient to the
[1:53:37] word that came to the prophet and
[1:53:40] because of her obedience behind closed
[1:53:43] doors God blessed the household
[1:53:46] amen so if you are obedient to God's
[1:53:48] word god will bless your household amen
[1:53:52] and that is following God's word keeping
[1:53:54] his
[1:53:55] word
[1:53:57] amen so we find that God has taken us to
[1:54:00] all of this we did all those things on
[1:54:02] ourselves but why was he doing this he
[1:54:05] wanted to he wants to manifest himself
[1:54:07] through US amen so the Bing ground was
[1:54:10] right so when he got the Bing ground
[1:54:13] right he brought us through where we was
[1:54:15] but now it's time for Mary for us to be
[1:54:17] of the scene amen now is the time for
[1:54:21] Christ to be displayed amen let your
[1:54:24] light so shine before men amen take up
[1:54:28] your cross and follow me let Christ be
[1:54:30] displayed upon the Earth through you and
[1:54:33] I let the world see Jesus Christ again
[1:54:36] this world have no hope yes this world
[1:54:39] have no solutions to their
[1:54:41] problems but you have the
[1:54:43] answers you have the one you are the one
[1:54:46] the Bible says when you are filled with
[1:54:47] the Holy Ghost you should be crying and
[1:54:49] sign for the abomination of the Lost we
[1:54:53] read in the starting of how Satan now
[1:54:55] got his image amen the second beast will
[1:54:58] speak for the first Beast amen we know
[1:55:01] that's speaking of America and through
[1:55:04] America comes all the media comes all
[1:55:06] the systems of this world all the laws
[1:55:08] and the land and everything it's coming
[1:55:09] through there cuz she's going to be the
[1:55:11] mouthpiece for the first drag for the
[1:55:14] first
[1:55:15] beast and we can see that all is said
[1:55:18] everything is set now
[1:55:20] everything everything is set for Satan
[1:55:22] to come amen so just like that
[1:55:26] everything must be said for us to leave
[1:55:28] the Earth but before we leave the Earth
[1:55:30] we must pass on the B Because Why Moses
[1:55:33] and Elijah going to come
[1:55:35] down and there must be a people and they
[1:55:38] going to be preaching that there was a
[1:55:40] people that took a Rapture yes they're
[1:55:43] going to believe they're going to be
[1:55:44] preaching this
[1:55:45] message to the people and the people
[1:55:47] must receive the Holy Ghost those Jews
[1:55:49] those 144 Jew th000 Jews must receive
[1:55:52] the Holy Ghost but they won't receive it
[1:55:54] to our preaching They will receive it by
[1:55:56] their own
[1:55:58] Prophet because
[1:56:00] why they calling them to the Feast of
[1:56:03] atonement under that seven trumpet but
[1:56:06] between that six and seven trumpet he
[1:56:08] comes down amen for us amen he comes
[1:56:12] down for us can give us his word and
[1:56:16] they're going to be he's going to tell
[1:56:17] them before the seven trumpeted there
[1:56:19] was a people yes there was a people when
[1:56:22] after World War II when Naomi was coming
[1:56:24] back in Homeland root was also he was
[1:56:26] bringing root yes he brought root along
[1:56:30] and they going to be rejoicing you know
[1:56:31] why they going to Rejoice this time
[1:56:33] because hey you mean to say our
[1:56:34] blindness sa people our blindness in
[1:56:37] part made people get saved amen that's
[1:56:41] true their blindness through day
[1:56:43] blindness we are saved
[1:56:46] amen so you can see where we are now
[1:56:50] and Satan got everything ready now he's
[1:56:52] got all the system the the world is in a
[1:56:54] Sodom condition Sodom is legalized sin
[1:56:57] is
[1:56:58] glorified sin is glorified and things of
[1:57:01] anything of God right now is bad badly
[1:57:03] spoken of ill spoken of in
[1:57:06] fact they they'll speak about religion
[1:57:09] and spiritual things but not
[1:57:12] God because Sin is Sin is actually
[1:57:14] glorified right
[1:57:16] now
[1:57:18] right and even
[1:57:19] even the unbelievers people who don't
[1:57:21] believe sorry people that don't believe
[1:57:23] the message can see there's something
[1:57:25] wrong
[1:57:26] now there going to be time where lot of
[1:57:28] foolish virgins start catching a wake up
[1:57:30] things are happening but it's going to
[1:57:31] be too
[1:57:32] late let's hope the foolish virgins are
[1:57:34] not lying in the message trying to get
[1:57:37] the oil when it's too
[1:57:39] late trying to get enough oil when when
[1:57:42] it's time for them to get the oil and
[1:57:43] keep the oil keep themselves full with
[1:57:45] the Holy
[1:57:46] Ghost they wasn't doing it but when when
[1:57:49] you come to the time of realizing hey we
[1:57:51] can see things around and now when I
