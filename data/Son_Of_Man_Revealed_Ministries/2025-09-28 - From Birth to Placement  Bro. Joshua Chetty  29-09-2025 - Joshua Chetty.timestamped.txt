[23:51] &gt;&gt; It was a true sign overlooked.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; And they didn't have reverence to God's
[23:57] word. what God was doing. They they
[23:59] spoke against it. It spoke harshly
[24:01] against it.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; They was there for the first two pools.
[24:04] But when it came to the opening of the
[24:05] word, it was too hard for them to
[24:06] digest.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; But what he came back and said, the
[24:11] presence of God unrecognized.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; But thank God we have recognized it.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; But all he was doing that time, he was
[24:20] saying that's my Lord up there.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; He was introducing us to the Edstone.
[24:25] Amen.
[24:27] He said when the when the Lord said to
[24:29] him, "Turn the picture to the right and
[24:32] he could see the picture there."
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what it was something that the
[24:37] world didn't recognize. Science had
[24:39] taken a picture of it. They took it as a
[24:41] a phenomenal cloud.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; But they did notice was a supernatural
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; demonstration, a vindication that God's
[24:50] presence was amongst us. Amen.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; That he was here. The headstone has come
[24:55] down to unite with the body.
[24:59] But what it was after seven church ages.
[25:02] Amen. The seven angel, the one that was
[25:06] here. Amen. And he said he must
[25:10] increase. I must decrease.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Because why? It was now the midnight cry
[25:16] going out. Amen. Behold the bridegroom
[25:18] cometh.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the invisible union of the
[25:22] bride. The heavenly bridegroom with the
[25:25] the heavenly bridegroom with the earthly
[25:27] bride. A supernatural event. A message
[25:31] coming from another world. Not an
[25:33] earthly message. Not packed up by
[25:36] theologians. Not packed up by any
[25:38] seminaries.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Not packed up by any denominations.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; People with the doctorate degrees and
[25:45] the great theologies couldn't pack this
[25:47] message.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. It is a supernatural message.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; A man with a seven great education.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who could have the mind of Christ.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where God embodied in human flesh
[26:04] again.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Coming and speaking to the mouth of his
[26:07] prophet the words to us. What it was
[26:10] these words of life of life. Amen.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Then his other preaching uniting time in
[26:15] a sign the marriage of the lamb
[26:18] &gt;&gt; wonders. Amen. What was it? The head and
[26:21] body being united.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:25] What was it? The lamb coming for his
[26:28] bride. But he's coming as a judge at the
[26:30] same time. He's coming as a lion judge
[26:33] to the world. But a lamb to us. Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; That same one coming, the one that did
[26:39] the work of redemption is coming to
[26:41] redeem his bride. Amen. So what? To do
[26:45] what? To bring us a message. A word that
[26:48] will change our bodies. That will take
[26:50] us to the wedding supper. Amen.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Nothing else could do it. Amen.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; He says in the message shalom, it's
[27:00] coming a time when the light and
[27:02] darkness will have to be separated one
[27:03] from another.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Church and its order will take the order
[27:07] of the day and Christ and his light word
[27:10] promise will go into the rapture.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's left for
[27:15] them to do. It's a day today. It's a
[27:18] dawn of a new day for many who are
[27:21] looking for his coming.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not for everybody.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you got your Bibles, just
[27:28] stand and read God's word.
[27:31] So, it's a glorious time. Amen.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Turn to the book of Romans, chapter 8,
[27:42] reading from verse 14.
[27:54] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[27:57] God, they are the sons of God.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; For ye have not received the spirit of
[28:04] bondage again to fear,
[28:08] but ye have received the spirit of
[28:10] adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, Father."
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; The spirit itself be witness with our
[28:18] spirit that we are the children of God.
[28:22] Amen.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; And if children, then hes
[28:28] &gt;&gt; of God and joint hes with Christ.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; If so be that we suffer with him, that
[28:37] we may be also glorified together.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[28:44] present time,
[28:47] there's complainings in the speest
[28:49] house. Yeah,
[28:50] &gt;&gt; the complaining that you go through in
[28:51] his time element are not worthy to be
[28:55] compared with the glory which shall be
[28:58] revealed in us.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation of the
[29:02] creature waited for the manifestation of
[29:06] the sons of God.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; For the create for the creature was made
[29:12] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[29:15] reason of him who had subjected the same
[29:17] in hope. because the creature itself
[29:20] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[29:22] of corruption
[29:23] &gt;&gt; into the glorious liberty of the
[29:25] children of God. For we know that the
[29:29] old creation
[29:31] &gt;&gt; groaned and travail in travailed in pain
[29:34] together until now. And not only they
[29:38] but ourselves also which have the first
[29:40] first fruits of the spirit. Even we
[29:43] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[29:46] for the adoption to what? The redemption
[29:50] of our body.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; So we know that the final part of our
[29:54] adoption is the redemption of our body
[29:58] is the total healing. Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; That's why divine healing is a sign.
[30:03] When you see somebody healed, it's a
[30:05] sign
[30:06] &gt;&gt; that one day there's going to be a total
[30:09] healing of this body.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're not going to leave here
[30:13] with the same type of body. We're going
[30:16] to leave with a healed body. Amen.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Because our theophony is going to align
[30:21] with this flesh body into a glorified
[30:23] body.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just for a little title this
[30:30] morning, we title this message from
[30:32] birth to placement.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; And we call it the sons of God in their
[30:39] positions. Amen. From birth to
[30:42] placement, the sons of God in their
[30:45] position. For we know in Romans 8
[30:48] saying, "For as many as are led by the
[30:50] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[30:53] For you have not received the spirit of
[30:55] bondage again to fear, but ye have
[30:57] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[30:59] we cry, aba, father."
[31:02] So this morning we're dealing with this
[31:05] this topic that we know we we've been
[31:07] speaking about this week after week but
[31:09] just to to give it some context we want
[31:13] to speak on we know there's the prophet
[31:16] have taught us there's a difference
[31:18] between a born child as a being born as
[31:21] a child of God and being placed as a
[31:24] mature son with authority.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says he says it here in the
[31:29] message adoption. He says listen your
[31:32] adoption is not your birth.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Now he's defining from the new birth and
[31:37] adoption. He said your adoption is your
[31:40] placing.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; When you were born again that's John
[31:45] 11:17. I believe we are born of the
[31:49] spirit of God. We are the sons of God.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; But we were predestinated.
[31:54] Now, here's what I'm trying to get you
[31:57] to. For this, sons of the last day. You
[32:01] see, we were predestinated unto
[32:03] adoption.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Now, now here we are. Now, this is what
[32:09] earth Pentecostal a little. They say I
[32:12] got born again. Praise the Lord. Got the
[32:14] Holy Ghost. Fine. You are a child of
[32:16] God. That's right. But yet, that ain't
[32:19] what I'm talking about.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were predestinated unto
[32:24] adoption.
[32:26] It's a pl it's placing a son.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Now we know in the eastern tradition, if
[32:33] a father being a wealthy person wants to
[32:37] hand over his affairs, his business
[32:39] affairs to his son,
[32:41] &gt;&gt; he has to place him to tutors.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Right? And he had to go to a time of
[32:46] tutoring.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Right. And it's a process of time. is
[32:50] not done overnight.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Your Christian walk is a process.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to justification,
[32:57] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[33:00] Ghost. But it don't stop there.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to go through tutors.
[33:04] You've got to have the you got to have
[33:06] the revelation of the word. The word got
[33:08] to be the word got to be taught to you.
[33:11] And you got to come to an understanding,
[33:13] a mature understanding of the word. You
[33:15] got to know how to walk in the things of
[33:17] God.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Your walk got to change you when
[33:21] you first come in and you have a mighty
[33:24] experience with God and you you have a
[33:26] repentance and you you have a conversion
[33:29] that's the one walk you come now you
[33:31] recognize the Lord as your personal
[33:33] savior you accept him as your personal
[33:35] savior then you go through water baptism
[33:37] then you are filled with the Holy Ghost
[33:38] then you started rejoicing you get
[33:40] satisfied and your life changes now you
[33:42] don't no longer desire to do the things
[33:44] you used to do
[33:45] &gt;&gt; amen
[33:47] &gt;&gt; then he fills you up with the Holy Holy
[33:48] Ghost to navigate your life.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; But now there's a time where you must
[33:52] come to maturity to know how to handle
[33:54] his word, to know how to handle the
[33:57] things of God. You you accept your
[33:59] responsibility,
[34:00] &gt;&gt; then I'm placed on this earth for a
[34:02] purpose.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; You accept your responsibility. I accept
[34:07] all of his word.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That if I'm to align with God, I
[34:12] must align, he is the word, I must align
[34:14] with the words.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you become in oneness with him.
[34:18] Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; And then you go through the tutoring
[34:21] which God is using now through the
[34:23] five-fold ministry. Amen.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; The Holy Which is the Holy Ghost is the
[34:27] tutor and the Holy Ghost works with men.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; So he's working through the five-fold
[34:32] ministry to positionally place the
[34:34] people and to bring them to an
[34:36] understanding of their the hour that
[34:38] they are living in and what is expected
[34:40] of them in the hour that they are living
[34:42] in.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this responsibility might seem
[34:45] like a burden at first, but when you
[34:48] become as you're coming mature, you
[34:50] realize the purpose,
[34:52] &gt;&gt; amen,
[34:52] &gt;&gt; of why there to be church order and
[34:54] doctrine, why there to be holiness, why
[34:57] there to be all these things set in
[34:59] place in the kingdom of God is because
[35:02] God has a work for you to do.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; And God want to tabernacle into your
[35:06] body.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; But for it to tabernacle into you, it
[35:12] must be a surrendered life,
[35:14] &gt;&gt; a life of holiness, a life whereby his
[35:17] holy spirit can indwell in you can
[35:20] navigate your life. That he be no longer
[35:22] that you that speak it, but he that will
[35:24] speak through you.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; So when you come to say we say this is
[35:30] my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the level of maturity. Yes.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Then he is now placing you into the
[35:39] body.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; And you know, pastor was going and
[35:43] speaking about the mystery of his will
[35:45] being adoption,
[35:47] right? And when we talk about the
[35:48] mystery of his will,
[35:51] &gt;&gt; now that a will is something not
[35:52] revealed to everybody.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; When a person dies, he has a will.
[35:57] That's his will. His last testament, his
[35:59] will,
[36:01] &gt;&gt; right? and and upon his death
[36:04] the will is now maybe the attorney will
[36:07] call the family the heirs of the will
[36:10] only the heirs of the will know what's
[36:14] contained in the will
[36:16] &gt;&gt; it's not for everybody
[36:18] &gt;&gt; amen
[36:19] &gt;&gt; amen so the mystery of his will is
[36:20] adoption this is not for everybody
[36:23] &gt;&gt; it's only for the air
[36:26] &gt;&gt; wonderful
[36:26] &gt;&gt; amen because why that's the mystery of
[36:28] his will
[36:29] &gt;&gt; that the world knows nothing about that
[36:32] you were hes. Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; So therefore adoption
[36:37] is not for everybody.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Now adoption now these you already was a
[36:44] son. You predestinated unto adoption.
[36:46] Other words you was going through you
[36:48] had to go through the process. Nothing
[36:50] is going to take away your sunship.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; But the process might take time.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's what the five ministry
[36:58] trying to get you up and to standard.
[37:01] Get you now upgraded into the position
[37:03] you ought to be in. Amen.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; You got to come into your placement and
[37:07] position. Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; So that's what we're speaking about from
[37:13] birth to placement. There was a time you
[37:16] come to the birth, but now you must come
[37:17] to placement because God wants his sons
[37:20] in their positions.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Everyone standing at the post of duty.
[37:25] So he can use us. Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; So therefore you find that when the
[37:36] headstone properties was introducing the
[37:38] headstone the time was not the appointed
[37:42] time. There was no people at that time
[37:45] that was now going to be honed.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; But the message was stored up in books
[37:52] and tapes.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But in due time and season,
[37:56] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost will run his trail. Run
[37:59] his trail again.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost will go on the
[38:03] cycle again, bringing this word to his
[38:06] predestinated seed. Amen.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh yes.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Then he's going to bring them into
[38:11] alignment. Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Then he's going to shape them up.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; He's going to hone them.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; When now the capstone can come down.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where they can come up a little
[38:22] higher. Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; They can come out of little because
[38:25] little has already been blinded.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; They can come out of the valley of dry
[38:29] bones.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. They can come up higher into the
[38:33] mountain of God.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where the glory of God is.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Where the shikina glory is there. Where
[38:43] the fresh mana where the mana can never
[38:45] be still.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; The mana is being fresh all the time.
[38:49] Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; The inexhaustible fountain of life.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now, not everybody can come
[38:56] out there.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; It's a horning time.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Many many have come in seed form and
[39:05] could have been hiding amongst them in
[39:07] seed form.
[39:09] But there comes a time where it's fruit
[39:11] form.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; And you can hide seed, but you can't
[39:15] hide fruit.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; By the fruit, you shall know who they
[39:18] are.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; So,
[39:24] Galatians 14:7 says, the book of
[39:27] Galatians in chapter 4 verse 1-7 says,
[39:30] "Now I say that the heir, as long as he
[39:34] is a child, defereth nothing from his
[39:37] servants,
[39:38] though he be lord of all,
[39:40] &gt;&gt; but he is under tutors and governors
[39:42] until the time appointed of the father."
[39:45] Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Even so we when we were children, we
[39:48] were in bondage under the elements of
[39:49] the world.
[39:51] But when the fullness of the time was
[39:53] come, God sent forth his son made of a
[39:57] woman made under the law to redeem them
[40:00] that were under the law,
[40:02] &gt;&gt; that we might receive the adoption of
[40:05] sons. And because they are sons, God had
[40:09] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[40:11] your hearts, crying, aba, father.
[40:15] Wherefore thou art no more a servant,
[40:17] but a son, and if a son, than an heir of
[40:20] God to Christ.
[40:24] Now the prophet said, now when you
[40:26] receive the Holy Ghost, that's one
[40:29] thing. You're born.
[40:32] But now for the ceremony of adoption,
[40:35] then he adopted this boy into his family
[40:38] and they had a ceremony. Now if they
[40:42] would write checks, anything that boy
[40:44] did was just as good. His name was just
[40:48] as good on the checks as his father's
[40:50] after the adoption.
[40:52] He was heir after the adoption.
[40:55] So in other words, he must go through
[40:58] the tutorship.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; And when he's proven to be now a son
[41:02] worthy to continue the father's affairs
[41:06] &gt;&gt; now he can take he can sign and use sign
[41:09] those checks
[41:11] &gt;&gt; using his father's authority.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; All the authority that the father had is
[41:15] vested into the son.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; All that was in God he poured into
[41:19] Christ. All that was in Christ he poured
[41:22] into his church.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; That's why he said greater works than
[41:25] his ye shall do.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not just for any bunch of
[41:29] people.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not for the wishy-washy
[41:32] bunch. It's for those that have been
[41:34] proven themselves.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Those that come into alignment with his
[41:38] word
[41:39] &gt;&gt; come into alignment with his program.
[41:41] That all that understand his affairs.
[41:43] Those that understand the mind of
[41:45] Christ, those that understand the
[41:47] mysteries of his will. Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Those that understand his purpose.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] He said, "Well, that's where the church
[41:56] needs to be tonight. It needs to be to a
[41:59] place that God will call you up
[42:01] somewhere and throw his glory over you."
[42:06] &gt;&gt; That the only time you can have his
[42:08] glory on you, you've got to come up
[42:09] higher where the shakina glory is.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; And experience in his glory. Amen. Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; And then if he's if you are with him and
[42:19] he's holy now, he's tabernacling in you
[42:22] cuz it must be God in bride form. God
[42:24] tabernacling in human flesh again.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; So if he's tabernacling in you then his
[42:29] glory must be shown through you.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz his glory is not going to be
[42:33] shown anywhere else on the earth.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; When you've come united with him when
[42:38] you know how to come now, you are seated
[42:39] now in heavenly places. You are now you
[42:42] are united with him. Amen. You are in
[42:44] oneness with him. His glory must be
[42:46] displayed through you. Then the people
[42:48] will see the resurrected Jesus Christ.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; When they see you walking on the
[42:53] streets, they will see the power of God
[42:55] in you. When they see you speak, when
[42:58] you're speaking to people
[42:59] &gt;&gt; and they start now and speaking about
[43:01] things that happening and you start
[43:02] saying them a few nuggets, they will be
[43:05] astonished at the way you are speaking.
[43:06] Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Because you're not speaking from
[43:08] earthly, you're not speaking from
[43:09] earthly things. Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; You are speaking from things from
[43:12] another world.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Things that the
[43:16] their the knowledge won't give them.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; The knowledge is limited. But you will
[43:20] know now the infinite mind of Christ.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; He's been revealed through his word.
[43:24] Amen.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[43:28] So he says he spread his power upon you,
[43:33] adopt you and place you glory into the
[43:36] body where that when you speak something
[43:40] happens.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; If you say this m to this mountain be
[43:44] thou removed it shall be removed.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the church is needing
[43:50] tonight.
[43:52] But if we our character goes down
[43:55] instead of going up, how is he going to
[43:58] do it?
[44:00] &gt;&gt; We continue to believe every work of God
[44:03] and seek after righteousness and do that
[44:06] which is right in the sight of God daily
[44:08] calling on him daily about his work
[44:11] getting others to come into church. In
[44:14] other words, you must be so thoroughly
[44:15] convinced of this. You you you know what
[44:19] is going to happen on the earth. You
[44:21] want others to to see the things that
[44:23] you believe. You want others to have the
[44:25] same rejoicing that you are rejoicing.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Listen, you found a p of great price.
[44:31] You want to share it with others.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; These are the blessing that the
[44:35] spiritual blessing that you have
[44:36] received. You want to share these
[44:38] blessings with others.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:41] He says
[44:43] we got to to believe every
[44:48] work of God and seek after righteousness
[44:50] and do that which is right in the sight
[44:52] of God daily calling on him daily about
[44:55] his work getting others to come into
[44:56] church trying to get somebody to come
[44:59] serve the Lord.
[45:01] Now if you're going to be around people
[45:03] and you are a negative person, you're
[45:06] always grumbling, you're always moouring
[45:08] about the government, the politics that
[45:10] the currency, about your health, and you
[45:12] you are negative, you you have such a
[45:15] people just don't want to be around you.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; How you going to show and display his
[45:21] glory through you?
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; But if you are in line with him, if you
[45:26] are separated with the Holy Ghost,
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. you people will be attracted
[45:31] around you.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; There'll be an attraction around you.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And it will be the Holy Ghost in you
[45:38] that will be attracting the people.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; It'll be a magnetic force.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; People will be see such a love of Christ
[45:44] in you.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; They will feel that this person I can go
[45:47] to them with my problem because if
[45:49] they're going to tell me something
[45:50] that's going to help me.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; They're not going to bring me more down.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; They're not going to tell me something
[45:55] more negative.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So if you're going to be a
[45:58] person that's grumpy, people want to be
[45:59] around you. They want to run away from
[46:01] you.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; But you need to have a such an
[46:03] attraction that people want to be around
[46:05] you. Amen.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about when
[46:10] you're in your workplace and all that
[46:12] you and people bring up suddenly you
[46:13] bring up a topic and you start talking
[46:15] about things that we believe in.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; They never hear of things like this.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Not from this world.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. and they get astonished and they
[46:24] suddenly start coming around you and
[46:26] they start want to hear more of these
[46:27] things. They might not fully understand
[46:30] but there's something that attracting
[46:31] them.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; What is it? The Holy Ghost in you.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; So he says all the people you work for,
[46:42] the milkman, the postman, the iceman,
[46:45] &gt;&gt; and whoever it is, all you come in
[46:47] contact with, speak to them about the
[46:49] Lord.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] Speak it with seasonable words.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Not just any word. Seasonable words.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, bring it to a current
[47:02] topic. They're talking about the
[47:04] politics. Then tell them, bring the
[47:07] politics in it. Bring God in the
[47:09] politics.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; They're talking about sickness, bring
[47:12] God in it.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Tell him what he's done for them.
[47:15] They're talking about finances. Bring
[47:16] Jehovah Gyra on the scene. Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; They're talking about healing. Bring
[47:20] Jehovah Rafa on the scene.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; They disturb. They got troubled. The
[47:24] mind is troubled. They vex in the
[47:26] spirit. Bring Jehovah shalom on the
[47:28] scene.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Bring him on the scene.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Bring the I am to every situation on the
[47:34] scene.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's got to work through you.
[47:40] You've got to be a person that's going
[47:42] to impact the people around you.
[47:44] He said, "All you come in contact, speak
[47:46] to them about the Lord. Speak it with
[47:48] seasonable words sweetly
[47:52] that don't jump onto them. Don't go tell
[47:54] them now, hey, look at how you dressed
[47:56] up. Look at how you God can't use you. I
[47:59] can't pray for you." No, no, no. Don't
[48:02] jump on them. Speak it with sweetness.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That they'll say, say, say that lady is
[48:10] a real lady. She spoke to me about the
[48:13] Lord. That man, I never seen such a man.
[48:16] He's the nicest man I ever met. You
[48:18] know, I would like to have his religion.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; That's what they think about this
[48:27] religion. But a religion is a covering.
[48:30] That's right. And our covering is not we
[48:32] are Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[48:34] Pentecostal. Our covering is the blood
[48:37] of Jesus Christ. That's our covering,
[48:40] our religion. Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now notice this that when this
[48:45] adoption come, that boy's name was just
[48:48] as good as his daddy."
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; He was heir of all things.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; That all his father had, so did we have.
[48:58] Now Jesus said, "He that believeth on
[49:00] me, the works that I do, John 14:12,
[49:04] shall he do also. He'll be able to do
[49:08] the same things that I do." Now God was
[49:11] proving here what he was doing to his
[49:13] own son. He had pleased him.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; You see every promise is available to
[49:18] us.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; It's how we come to how we align oursel
[49:22] to his word. Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Everything is there. God has not been
[49:27] short of giving us anything any
[49:29] redemptive blessing. It's upon us
[49:31] knowing how to go and grab those
[49:33] blessings. Amen. Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; So we find that in in the eastern
[49:37] tradition the Hebrew father always he
[49:39] waited he waited for a period of time
[49:42] until his son proved maturity under
[49:44] tutors.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; And we know that from the time the
[49:46] messages come there was a period of time
[49:49] God had to put us under tutors. Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And then he publicly placed him giving
[49:55] him the authority of his name.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; So being born again makes you a child of
[50:01] God. Yes. But placement makes you an
[50:04] heir with authority.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; So now when you're adopted, your
[50:10] prayers, your testimony, your words,
[50:13] everything you speak is backed by
[50:15] heaven.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. They have a heavenly backing. So
[50:19] if you say to this mountain, be removed.
[50:21] You said it, it's going to be backed.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; You spoke to that cancer to leave your
[50:26] body, it must leave.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You spoke your situation from a
[50:32] negative situation to a positive one. It
[50:34] must come to pass.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; You spoke that job that you did, it must
[50:38] come. It must be backed by heaven. Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] Let's open to Romans 8:19. Romans 8:19
[50:48] says, "For the earnest expectation of
[50:50] the creature waited for the
[50:52] manifestation of the sons of God."
[50:55] Now, if you got your Bible, just turn to
[50:56] the book of Ezekiel, chapter 37, read
[50:59] from 1-4.
[51:11] The hand of the Lord was upon me, and
[51:13] carried me out in the spirit of the
[51:15] Lord, and set me down in the midst of
[51:17] the valley, which was full of bones, and
[51:21] caused me to pass by them round about.
[51:24] And behold, there were very many in the
[51:26] open valley. And lo, they were very dry.
[51:31] Oh, thank God. We once were dry, but we
[51:34] no longer in the valley. Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Where everything is dry? We no longer
[51:38] seia. Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; And he said unto me, son of man, can
[51:43] these bones live?
[51:45] &gt;&gt; And I answered, Lord God, thou knowest?
[51:48] Again he said unto me, prophesy upon
[51:51] these bones and say unto them, oh ye dry
[51:54] bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus
[51:56] sayith the Lord God unto these bones,
[51:58] behold, I will cause breath to enter
[52:00] into your into you and ye shall live.
[52:04] And I will lay sne upon you and will
[52:06] bring up flesh upon you
[52:08] &gt;&gt; and cover you with skin and put breath
[52:11] in you know
[52:13] &gt;&gt; and ye shall live
[52:15] &gt;&gt; and ye shall know
[52:19] that I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I
[52:23] was commanded and as I prophesied there
[52:26] was a noise and behold a shaking
[52:29] and the bones came together bone to his
[52:32] bone. And when I beheld, and lo, sign
[52:34] you, that the flesh came up upon them,
[52:37] and the skin covered them above, but
[52:40] there was no breath in them. Then said
[52:43] he unto me, "Prophesy unto the wind.
[52:46] Prophesy, son of man, and say to the
[52:47] wind, thus say the Lord God, come from
[52:51] the four wind breath, and breathe upon
[52:53] the slain that they may live."
[52:56] &gt;&gt; So here's the prophecy again. Okay. So I
[52:59] prophesied as he commanded me and the
[53:01] breath came into into them and they
[53:04] lived and stood upon their feet an
[53:06] exceeding great army.
[53:09] Amen. So we find that in in in verse one
[53:12] he's saying the hand of the Lord was
[53:13] upon me. So he's speaking about that we
[53:15] know we was once down. Amen. We was once
[53:17] down in the letter among the little
[53:20] among the chicken biards. Amen. But we
[53:23] were called up to come up higher. Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] We're no longer in a place where it's
[53:28] dry. We're in a place where the shikina
[53:31] glories.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; We're in a place where we have the mind
[53:34] of Christ.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know what he once done with the
[53:38] word. We're in a place where the mana is
[53:40] always fresh.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[53:45] And verse three says, "And he said unto
[53:47] me, oh son of man, can these bones
[53:49] live?" And I answered, "Oh Lord God,
[53:51] thou knowest." And again he said unto
[53:52] me, prophesy upon his bone and said unto
[53:54] him. So it wasn't just prophesying
[53:57] anything.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; It was or he says don't just say
[54:04] anything. You must be particular in what
[54:05] you're saying.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; So God wouldn't just leave you to put
[54:09] your own ideas and think. Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't the prophet say exactly what this
[54:15] is?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; He's given us his words.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; He's given us the word of what to speak
[54:21] in this hour.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; He puts the word in us.
[54:24] Amen.
[54:28] In verse 7, it says, "So I prophesied as
[54:30] I was commanded, and as I prophesied,
[54:32] there was a noise, and behold, a
[54:35] shaking, and the bones came together,
[54:38] bone to his bone." So what was that
[54:42] speaking about? Something happened in
[54:44] the spiritual realm. Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a shaking.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; When this word went forth, there was a
[54:51] shaking. There was a noise.
[54:54] And each bone was coming to his together
[54:57] and the bone was aligning with each
[55:00] bone. In other words, there wasn't out
[55:02] of place. It wasn't a a backbone. Now
[55:05] it's going to be a footbone.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; No, the bones was coming together bone
[55:10] to his bone.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; He couldn't take a leg bone to make a
[55:16] neck bone. Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; The body must be fitly joined and
[55:20] compacted together.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; He said because now every joint supplied
[55:28] for more effectual working didn't Paul
[55:30] say that
[55:31] &gt;&gt; working of the body that every joint
[55:33] supplied for the more effectual working
[55:35] of the body
[55:38] and verse 8 says that when I beheld and
[55:40] lowered the sinus and the flesh came up
[55:43] upon them and the skin covered them
[55:45] above but there was no breath in them.
[55:50] You see?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; So you find that it was a four-fold
[55:55] prophecy. One was a promise of su flesh
[56:00] and skin and then bread.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Now they still need bread to come forth.
[56:04] That's why the second prophecy went
[56:06] forth. Amen. And he delivered. We know
[56:09] what happened here. He says
[56:11] the prophet of God says
[56:14] prophesy son of man. Can these bones
[56:17] live? Wish we had time. I got it wrote
[56:19] down here. But I have to miss that
[56:21] prophesy. Can his bones live? What's the
[56:23] four stages of death coming forth of the
[56:26] church? What's the four stage of
[56:28] Ezekiel's dry bones coming forth?
[56:30] &gt;&gt; But the life only come not when the sign
[56:33] su skin was on them but when the wind
[56:37] blowed upon them.
[56:40] That's when come back that fought
[56:43] message of life. I will restore, say the
[56:47] Lord. Hallelujah. Glory. Praise be to
[56:50] God. The fourth light is to come that
[56:53] will bring forth the same signs.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Justification brought back the pulp.
[56:58] Sanctification brought back the bach
[57:02] doctrine of holiness. What brought back
[57:05] the leaf? Pentecostals.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; What is it? Pentecostal. The leaf clap
[57:11] their hand. Joy rejoicing. Pentecostal.
[57:15] The foot was the word
[57:18] &gt;&gt; itself.
[57:20] The word was made flesh. In other words,
[57:24] he himself is here being manifested in
[57:27] human flesh again.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Being manifested in your eyes.
[57:31] What it is the dynamics of the Holy
[57:33] Ghost coming upon his people.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We had the mechanics. But now this
[57:39] is the word that's coming flesh. The
[57:40] word that's coming to life. It is the
[57:42] endemics coming upon the mechanics that
[57:45] bringing the word to life.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; It is a quickening power.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word that was laying there,
[57:52] now it's coming with a quickening power
[57:54] upon his people.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[57:59] The word was made flesh, fruits of the
[58:02] proof of the resurrection sign that
[58:04] Christ has finally after justification
[58:07] being planted, sanctification being
[58:10] planted, baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[58:12] organization died out and Christ has
[58:15] again sented himself like the cap of the
[58:18] pyramid.
[58:20] M
[58:21] &gt;&gt; first line justification,
[58:23] sanctification, baptism of Holy Ghost,
[58:26] then coming of the cap.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; What is it? The Holy Ghost punch being
[58:32] owned out so that it can fit with the
[58:35] same kind of ministry he had when it
[58:37] went away. That when he comes back,
[58:40] it'll catch the whole thing in the
[58:42] rapture where the justified, sanctified,
[58:45] and baptism of the Holy Ghost, that
[58:47] pyramid will stand again. The house of
[58:49] God will live again. The tree of life is
[58:52] growing again.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; So you see where we are now. You see
[58:56] what the Holy Spirit has been showing us
[58:58] how we are to be honed. It is so that he
[59:01] could come and kept the pyramid. Amen.
[59:04] We have to come into that plan. Amen.
[59:06] Where he can fitly come into us. Amen.
[59:09] So perfectly that you cannot set them
[59:12] apart.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; You can't see anything else.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; You only see oneness.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ, the bride, heavenly
[59:20] bridegroom and the earthly bride come
[59:21] into oneness. That is why after the
[59:24] seventh age, after the church ages, we
[59:27] call into another age.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; It was a dawn of a new day.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were saying shalom. A rise and
[59:33] shine. The light is come.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it? What was the mystery
[59:40] of his coming? It's connected with a
[59:42] shout. It's connected with Revelation
[59:44] 10:1 and the the seven tunnels, the
[59:46] seven seals. What was it? Our light has
[59:48] come.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our light has come. We could arise
[59:52] now and shine.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; For the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[59:56] you.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Now that for you to have the glory of
[59:59] God, you have to come into you have to
[1:00:02] come up
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; to where the glory of God is into the
[1:00:04] mountain of God.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Come up into the headstone.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Come up into the heavenly places. You
[1:00:09] are now seated in heavenly places.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; That is why when you are speaking now,
[1:00:16] you are speaking from heavenly places.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; You're speaking from another world.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; You're not speaking by human intellect.
[1:00:22] You're not speaking by human
[1:00:23] understanding. That is why now when you
[1:00:26] say to that demon, "Be thou removed."
[1:00:28] When you bind that mama, oh, when you go
[1:00:30] now to bind that demon, you know now you
[1:00:33] got the backing of heaven, you're
[1:00:35] speaking with authority from another
[1:00:36] world. Amen. And therefore now if you
[1:00:39] say to your brother I loose you from
[1:00:41] those infirmities in the name of Jesus
[1:00:43] Christ you know you got the backing of
[1:00:45] heaven behind you when you go to your
[1:00:47] brother now that the devil is troubling
[1:00:49] you say I bind you in the name of Jesus
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; you bind that mama that thing that's
[1:00:54] troubling you bind it
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; but you know now spiritually where
[1:00:57] you're getting it from.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. For he said whatever you bind on
[1:01:02] earth I shall bind in heaven. What you
[1:01:04] loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:01:06] heaven.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why he said heaven and
[1:01:10] earth shall pass away but my words
[1:01:12] because these are eternal words
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; shall not pass away. Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; So you find that this Holy Ghost bunch
[1:01:20] being honed out. Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; So what was it? The second prophecy.
[1:01:26] What was it? The dynamics. Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; The breadth that makes the bride rise at
[1:01:31] an exceeding army.
[1:01:33] Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; But the scripture goes on, it doesn't
[1:01:37] stop there.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; It also speaks about in verses,
[1:01:44] let's go to verse 11. He said, "Then he
[1:01:46] said unto me, son of man,
[1:01:49] these bones,"
[1:01:51] okay, let's go to
[1:01:54] verse 10. So I prophesied and as he
[1:01:57] commanded me, and bread came unto them.
[1:02:00] When did the bread came? where this word
[1:02:03] has come down. Amen. What was it? The
[1:02:06] dynamics coming down again.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Bringing it to become an invincible
[1:02:11] army.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Marching. Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; A super church.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; A super race.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Satan can't do anything to her now
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; because Satan cannot get up where he is.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot get up to the headstone.
[1:02:25] Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; He cannot get this revelation. That is
[1:02:28] why he said this is not a public show.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The angel of God told him, "You
[1:02:32] spend too much time dwelling on your
[1:02:34] first to pull explaining these things,
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; but you can't don't explain this one
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; because this was not a public show."
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be locked in and there
[1:02:44] you got to be shut in with God. Amen.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Shut into the heavenly place into the
[1:02:48] heavenly sphere to recognize these
[1:02:51] things. That is why they will never
[1:02:52] understand these things.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Satan knows the Bible, but he doesn't
[1:02:56] have this revelation.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:03:01] And therefore you find now he says we
[1:03:03] become the invincible army. Verse 11 he
[1:03:05] says then he said unto me son of man
[1:03:07] these bones are the whole house of
[1:03:10] Israel. Behold they say our bones are
[1:03:12] dried and our hope is lost. We are cut
[1:03:14] off from our parts.
[1:03:17] Therefore prophesy and say unto them
[1:03:19] thus say the Lord God behold oh my
[1:03:21] people I will open your grave and cause
[1:03:23] you to come up out of your graves and
[1:03:25] bring you into the land of Israel.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see this, it's also
[1:03:29] speaking about redemption, the full
[1:03:31] redemption.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's also speaking of a
[1:03:34] resurrection. We coming out of
[1:03:36] something, but we are going into
[1:03:38] something else. Amen.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; We are now in the land of the Holy
[1:03:42] Ghost.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And in this land, there is no you passed
[1:03:45] from death unto life.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; you've already passed from death unto
[1:03:50] life.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Because you have received the message of
[1:03:54] grace,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; which is the message of life. Amen.
[1:03:57] Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Now you could say, "Oh de, where is your
[1:04:04] sting?
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Oh grave, where is your victory?" It's
[1:04:07] revealed to you. I am passed from dead
[1:04:09] unto life. What Satan can do to this
[1:04:11] body because I know where I go. Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And for those that will not go into the
[1:04:20] grave, they are those that will now be
[1:04:22] translated from from this natural life
[1:04:25] to a spiritual life. Amen.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; From this natural body to a spiritual
[1:04:29] body,
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; from the natural to the supernatural.
[1:04:34] Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; But all nature is groaning and
[1:04:38] surveilling. Even the saints in the
[1:04:40] sixth dimension, they're waiting upon
[1:04:42] us.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; For us to be perfected in this hour.
[1:04:45] Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; That we will come into perfection. Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz they without us cannot be made
[1:04:53] perfect.
[1:05:00] says
[1:05:03] in Ephesians 1:3 and 6 say, "Blessed be
[1:05:06] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:08] Christ, who have blessed us with all
[1:05:10] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:05:12] in Christ, according as he had chosen us
[1:05:15] in him before the foundation of the
[1:05:17] world, that we should be holy and
[1:05:19] without blame before him in love, having
[1:05:21] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:05:23] children, by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:05:26] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:05:28] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:05:30] grace wherein he had made us accepted in
[1:05:34] the beloved.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Second Peter 15:8 says and beside this
[1:05:39] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:05:41] virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge
[1:05:44] temperance to temperance patience and to
[1:05:47] patience godliness and to godliness
[1:05:49] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:05:51] kindness charity. For if these things be
[1:05:54] in you and abound, they make you that
[1:05:57] you shall neither be barren nor
[1:06:00] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:06:02] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Then we speak about in the valley they
[1:06:05] were dry.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Now you are called up to come up higher.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; And when you come, how you come up
[1:06:10] higher? You come to the stature
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; of a perfect man.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you come up higher into
[1:06:15] the headstone, you can't be barren. You
[1:06:18] can't be unfruitful. You must be
[1:06:20] fruitful and multiply.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Because you are eating from the heavenly
[1:06:23] manner. Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "And he made uh
[1:06:30] creatures and creatures fell and then
[1:06:33] God in in a message adoption uh
[1:06:36] paragraph 54 and he says, "And he made
[1:06:40] creatures
[1:06:42] and creatures fell.
[1:06:46] And then God by infinite in infinitity
[1:06:50] looked down through the stream of time
[1:06:52] and saw every man that would be saved.
[1:06:57] Did you get that? Paragraph 54 message
[1:06:59] adoption.
[1:07:05] He knew it by fornowledge that by
[1:07:08] fornowledge knew who would be saved and
[1:07:11] who would not be saved. He could
[1:07:13] predestinate. So the word is not such a
[1:07:15] bad word after all
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; is it? He could predestinate because he
[1:07:20] knew who would and would who would not.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Therefore in order to catch those who
[1:07:26] would he had to make a propitiation for
[1:07:30] their sins.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Or if we can we want to get to it just a
[1:07:37] few verses below. He's predestinated us
[1:07:40] to eternal life
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; knowing that those who would lay aside
[1:07:45] everything.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; When are you becoming an oddball? When
[1:07:49] are you going to be persecuted for his
[1:07:51] word?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Because he said if you Jesus said if you
[1:07:53] love me you will keep my words and my
[1:07:56] words will not be grievious unto you.
[1:08:00] So he said who would lay aside
[1:08:02] everything and no matter how indifferent
[1:08:04] it would look to what the children of
[1:08:05] the world it would mean one thing to
[1:08:08] them because they were children of God
[1:08:10] and he called them.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; So when God places us by his fornowledge
[1:08:19] Amen. and places that man in the body of
[1:08:22] Christ
[1:08:24] we know that no devil can move him
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; because he predestination. Yeah,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; you might even if the man can be
[1:08:31] backslid to he must come up.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; God will find a way of bringing him up.
[1:08:36] Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; No devil can move that man because if
[1:08:39] God predestinated you because it's by
[1:08:40] his forn knowledge he already knew
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; that you will believe his word.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; He already knew that you will live by
[1:08:47] his standards.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; You will love his word.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] So we find that he said the fine line
[1:09:00] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:09:02] of the Holy Ghost, then coming of the
[1:09:04] cap. What is it? The Holy Ghost bunch
[1:09:07] being horned so that he can fit with the
[1:09:09] same kind of ministry he had when he
[1:09:11] went away.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; It must be the same kind. It must be
[1:09:16] Jesus Christ must be seen on display.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It can't be anything short of what
[1:09:22] he what he did on the earth. Amen.
[1:09:29] You know, if you look at life, you can't
[1:09:32] be like me. I can't be like you.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Every one of us are unique.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; But we are supposed to attain to be like
[1:09:39] Christ.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; That's who we attain to be like.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; But if you're like Christ and I'm like
[1:09:45] Christ, then we are one.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And we are the same. Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[1:09:52] But our unique characters in the flesh
[1:09:54] are different. But when we attain to
[1:09:56] Christ, that brings us into oneness.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; It brings us into an harmony. It brings
[1:10:00] us in one mind, one spirit, one accord.
[1:10:03] And when we are there, then watch the
[1:10:06] power of God come down.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Upon his people,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; watch how God works.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Then when you That is why he takes a
[1:10:14] hidden life. A hidden life is when you
[1:10:16] alone you're praying. You alone you're
[1:10:18] fasting. You alone you're meditating on
[1:10:20] the word. Then when you're out there in
[1:10:21] the public, you don't have to scream.
[1:10:22] You don't have to hold up.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; You just go and speak the word.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Because why? In your hidden life, you
[1:10:30] know what you're doing behind the
[1:10:31] scenes. Jesus went every night. He
[1:10:33] departed from the people. He went in
[1:10:34] prayer. Prophet did the same thing. But
[1:10:37] when he come out, you'll see him there.
[1:10:39] He's not screaming. He's not shouting.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; He's just rebuking. He's just praying.
[1:10:43] Receive your healing. Receive your
[1:10:44] healing.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus did the same thing when he
[1:10:47] went there. He just spoke the word. He
[1:10:49] didn't scream at the demon.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Because the demon already knew
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; who he was.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; When you go and a spirit upon a person,
[1:10:57] they must recognize.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; That spirit must have convulsions.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Because they must recognize who you are.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; They must recognize this is a son and
[1:11:08] daughter of God.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; What have I what have I to do with you?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; That you are now coming in my territory.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; You tell him this is not your territory.
[1:11:17] You only You are only a squatter
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; in this place.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; And you give him eviction notice.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; You demon of cancer, we evict you in
[1:11:28] Jesus name.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Whatever the situation is, you give that
[1:11:32] demon eviction notice.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; So we know that the the pyramid when he
[1:11:43] was there when he not build a pyramid,
[1:11:45] the pyramid it didn't have the
[1:11:47] headstone. Amen.
[1:11:50] Like the church, it was incomplete
[1:11:53] until this the fullness of time was
[1:11:55] come, which is now.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Until now, where Christ, the headstone,
[1:12:01] the capstone could come. But he
[1:12:04] couldn't. He had to come to a people
[1:12:06] that had to be home.
[1:12:09] It's coming to such a needle point that
[1:12:12] therefore you find that those that are
[1:12:14] not in alignment with him has to fall
[1:12:16] out on the way side.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; They have to be taken out. Amen. It's
[1:12:20] nothing to do with them.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; It's just by predestination.
[1:12:26] Oh yes.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; It's God divine choosing. Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; It's nothing good to say it's my
[1:12:31] ability. I began to see this. I began to
[1:12:34] see that. No.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; I didn't begin to see that. Had it not
[1:12:37] been for the grace of God,
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; had he not opened it up to us, we
[1:12:40] wouldn't be able to see the things we
[1:12:42] see.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; We won't be able to believe the things
[1:12:45] we believe. Had it not been for his
[1:12:47] grace. Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; So in this adoption process, he is the
[1:12:53] headstone sealing the bride.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; It's a complete seal. Amen. Because
[1:12:58] first you have to be taken out of the
[1:13:00] little sea and age into the bride age
[1:13:02] and then the cap caper to come down when
[1:13:06] the bride are to be owned into a fl.
[1:13:09] Amen. And what it is a ceiling it is
[1:13:13] what showing that's his adoption and he
[1:13:16] can now come when there's unity now
[1:13:18] between the head and the body and it
[1:13:20] comes to such a wonders. Amen.
[1:13:23] So it is what it shows that this church
[1:13:25] has come into the has come to maturity.
[1:13:30] A character has been shaped. A character
[1:13:32] has been molded. She's now the
[1:13:35] manifestation of Christ's very life.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Seated in heavenly places.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; She's immovable. Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; She's becomes immovable. She can't be
[1:13:46] tossed to and fro with every minute of
[1:13:48] doctrine.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; She's immovable.
[1:13:52] She's operating now as the invincible
[1:13:54] army of God.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; So the question was asked in Ezekiel,
[1:13:59] can these bones live?
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; The answer in this day and this hour is
[1:14:04] yes.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Because why? The life is in her now.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; She stands placed in a position.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here. The mighty angel
[1:14:14] is here amongst us.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. who is positionally placed us into
[1:14:19] the place that we ought to be now.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that brought us from
[1:14:23] birth into placement.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the work of a man, but the Holy
[1:14:28] Ghost, the mighty angel that is here
[1:14:30] amongst us, bringing us the living word,
[1:14:33] the living bread of life
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; into our current state of affairs,
[1:14:38] bringing us into our current stage of
[1:14:40] our present ministry.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; This ministry where Christ is in the
[1:14:44] bride. Amen. Christ is in his body
[1:14:48] dwelling in a many membered body. Amen.
[1:14:52] Where sons of God have been tested with
[1:14:55] the word.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; They have been tried but they still
[1:14:58] standing today in 2025 still standing
[1:15:01] and believing this word firmly.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Where many have fallen in the wayside
[1:15:07] but sons and daughters of God being
[1:15:09] tried and tested will still believe this
[1:15:11] word will still amen his word. will
[1:15:14] still punctuate every word. Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Where you can openly believe the word
[1:15:22] because you are now the manifest. You
[1:15:24] have received the bread of life
[1:15:27] and the headstone come
[1:15:30] with love. Amen. Standing and here it is
[1:15:32] now standing as the very image of
[1:15:36] Christ.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; When I see you, I see Christ. When you
[1:15:40] see me, you see Christ. How do you see
[1:15:42] it? The way the word is broken,
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; the way you love the word, the way you
[1:15:48] appreciate the word.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The way you enjoy his word.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; And we fellowship around his word.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:56] In the church age book he mentions he
[1:15:58] mentions they in the bride will be so
[1:16:01] much like him
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; that in the pagan church age he says
[1:16:06] they in the bride will be so much like
[1:16:08] him they will even be in his very image.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; This is in order to be united with him
[1:16:17] they will be one. You see it was the
[1:16:19] owning coming to his image aligning with
[1:16:21] him so we could come in on wonders with
[1:16:23] him. They will be the very manifestation
[1:16:26] of the word of the living God. The
[1:16:28] nominations cannot produce this wrong
[1:16:30] seed. They will produce the creed and
[1:16:32] the dogmas mixed with the word. The
[1:16:35] mongalizing brings forth a hybrid
[1:16:37] product. The first son Adam was a spoken
[1:16:40] seed word of God. He was given a bride
[1:16:43] to reproduce himself.
[1:16:46] That is why the bride was given to him
[1:16:50] to reproduce himself
[1:16:52] to reproduce another son of God. But she
[1:16:54] fell. She couldn't wait for Adam to come
[1:16:56] into full stature. Amen. She couldn't
[1:17:00] wait for Adam to come to full stature
[1:17:02] and now speak Eve. He shall produce.
[1:17:07] But she fell. She fell by hypnotization.
[1:17:09] She caused him to die.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; The second son Jesus also a spoken seed
[1:17:15] word of God was given a rhyme like as
[1:17:17] was Adam. But when he but before he
[1:17:21] could marry her, she also had fallen.
[1:17:25] She like Adam's wife was put to the test
[1:17:28] whether she would believe the word of
[1:17:30] God and live or doubt the word and die.
[1:17:33] She doubted. She left the word. She
[1:17:35] died. She went to Nia Rome.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; And she died right there.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; From a little group of the true seed of
[1:17:41] the word. God will present Christ with a
[1:17:44] beloved bride.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; She's a virgin of his word. She is a
[1:17:49] virgin because she knows no man made
[1:17:51] creeds or dogmas by and through the
[1:17:54] members of the bride would be fulfilled
[1:17:55] all that was promised of God to be made
[1:17:57] manifest in the virgin. The word of
[1:18:00] promise came to the virgin Mary but that
[1:18:02] word of promise was he himself to be
[1:18:04] made manifest. God was made manifest. He
[1:18:07] himself acted at a time and fulfilled
[1:18:09] his own word of promise in the virgin.
[1:18:11] It was an angel that had brought her the
[1:18:13] message.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; But the angel's message was the word of
[1:18:16] God. Isaiah 9:6, he fulfilled all that
[1:18:20] time, all that was written of him
[1:18:22] because she accepted his word to her.
[1:18:25] The members of the virgin bride will
[1:18:27] love him and they will have his
[1:18:29] potential for he is their head and all
[1:18:32] power belongs to him. They are subject
[1:18:35] to him as the members of our bodies are
[1:18:38] subject to our heads.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:18:42] son. Jesus never did anything until it
[1:18:46] was first showed him by the father. John
[1:18:50] 5:19.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; This harmony is now to exist between
[1:18:55] groom and his bride.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; He showed he shows her his word of life.
[1:19:00] She receives it. She never doubts it.
[1:19:03] Therefore, nothing can armor, not even
[1:19:06] death.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; For if the seed be planted, the water
[1:19:09] will raise it up again. Here is the
[1:19:11] secret of this. The word is in the bride
[1:19:14] as it was in Mary. The bride has the
[1:19:17] mind of Christ. For she knows what he
[1:19:20] once done with the word. She performs
[1:19:22] the command of the word in his name. For
[1:19:24] she has thus said the Lord. Then the
[1:19:26] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[1:19:29] comes to pass.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; So you see, you're not just to expected
[1:19:34] just to be nominal Christian. You're not
[1:19:36] expected just to remain born again.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But you are to be play being
[1:19:41] placed as sons of God
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; coming to our position as our what it
[1:19:46] was the headstone has descended. The
[1:19:48] pyramid is complete with us not without
[1:19:54] us. Amen. With every part of the body
[1:19:57] when every part of the body comes into
[1:19:59] its bone upon bone. Amen. Joint upon
[1:20:03] joint then that pyramid is complete. The
[1:20:06] bride is sealed. So this is our way says
[1:20:10] rise and shine.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Walk in your position as sons of God in
[1:20:16] our placement in our
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're moving. The Holy Spirit
[1:20:20] has moved us from birth to placement.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Where sons of God are in their rightful
[1:20:26] position.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Where demons are having demons must have
[1:20:30] convulsions.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Demons must have no place to hide.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Al is unleashed on the earth.
[1:20:37] But God needs his invincible army in the
[1:20:40] force, in the forefront.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has placed a responsibility on
[1:20:45] us.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; To carry out his words
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; where demon powers can't be able to
[1:20:51] stand us, withstand us.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Because right now they're going on a
[1:20:56] rampage upon the earth. There's chaos on
[1:20:58] the earth right now.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Every time you look at the news, it's
[1:21:01] bad news.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; There's murders. Like it's becoming so
[1:21:05] common now to to see murders.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; What is that? Demon power upon the
[1:21:11] people.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Gr darkness upon the earth.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; But sons of God need to take out their
[1:21:18] position.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; And manifest Christ again upon the
[1:21:22] earth.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; So the world will see Jesus Christ the
[1:21:25] same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So these things are doesn't just
[1:21:34] come by
[1:21:36] just saying I'm reading this line or
[1:21:38] following a thought. No, it comes with a
[1:21:40] surrendered life.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; It come with a separate individual life.
[1:21:44] Is that where you're going and praying
[1:21:45] in front of people and showing people
[1:21:47] how old you are? I know it's your Bible
[1:21:49] time of God.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; When you go to the people, they must see
[1:21:52] Christ through you.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; They must experience Christ through you.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you have your alone time,
[1:21:59] when you have the time, you got to make
[1:22:00] time for the things of God. You know, I
[1:22:03] was telling brother, look, you are what
[1:22:04] you eat in the natural.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; So the same thing is you'll you'll you
[1:22:09] will see a person's spiritual growth by
[1:22:12] what they eat
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; in the spiritual.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; If you are what you eat in the natural,
[1:22:17] you are what you eat in the spiritual.
[1:22:20] You eat all your junk food, your
[1:22:22] processed food, you get sick and you
[1:22:23] complain. But you are what you eat.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; But if you eat the right food
[1:22:28] spiritually,
[1:22:30] then you will walk in a with spiritual
[1:22:32] growth.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; So if you partake of the right food, the
[1:22:37] right diet which is given which the Holy
[1:22:41] Ghost is feeding it through the firefold
[1:22:42] ministry

[1:22:47] And you must be spiritually healthy.
