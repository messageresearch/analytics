Church of the Living God let's give the Lord a good answer for praise amen amen if you put up Psalm 97 I'm just going to read the psalm amen hallelujah it's important to stay in the presence of the Lord the presence of the Lord is not only found here in this building here amen the presence of the Lord is within you Jesus said lo I Am With You Always amen amen he said I will never leave you nor forsake you so you're going through the midst of the trial you're going through the fiery furnace you're going into a lion's den the Lord is with you never leaves you nor forsakes you amen and you know we read this Old Testament stories and the power and the presence of the Lord is so powerful before the shed blood how much more up to the shed blood amen so Psalm 97 says the Lord reigneth let the Earth Rejoice let the multitude of Isles be glad thereof clouds and darkness are around about him so people are wondering about clouds what is cloud the Bible is saying clouds and darkness around about him righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne a fire god before him and burned it up his enemies round about amen his Lightnings Enlighten the world the Earth saw and tremble the hills melted like wets at the presence of the Lord at the presence of the Lord of the old Earth the heavens declares righteousness and all the people see his glory confounded be all they that serve graven images that boast themselves of Idols worship Him holy Gods Zion heard and was glad and the daughters of Judah Rejoice because of their judgments O Lord for thou Lord at high above all the Earth Thou Art exalted far above all gods you that love the Lord It's evil he preserveth The Souls of his Saints he delivered them out of the hand of the wicked light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart rejoice in the Lord be righteous and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness amen what a great God we serve amen if your mountain is too hard or true amen wide or too high amen you can speak to your Mountain to move out of the way amen and if you are carrying his presence with you the Bible is declaring that the mountain melts like Wax at his presence amen so never go anywhere without the presence of the Lord amen amen are you joyful this morning the Bible declares let the Saints be joyful amen hallelujah so we love the Lord amen so this morning just remember after the service we let the baptismal service of sister Josephine amen I'm sure they're on the way there was a bad accident on the Intruder that backed up the traffic amen so we'll add the baptism service straight after this uh I mean baptism straight after the morning service amen amen and the Bible declares that the all those of heaven and all of Heaven rejoices when one sinner repents amen give the light to the Lord Jesus Christ makes a decision a public confession that I'm following up to the Lord Jesus Christ amen so we certainly thankful that the Lord the holy spirit is able to work even in the Arts of the young people that they can have conviction in their hearts amen nobody forces them the preaching of the word Goes Forth they get convicted lives are changed lives

only if you're under expectation this morning amen I mean if you know if you didn't even come with an expectation prior to now right now you can create an expectation in your heart amen right now you can create an expectation for what the Lord is about to do amen so I believe the Lord has been using our brother tremendously amen I heard about a testimony and maybe our brother the prayer will share about a testimony of a sister that got healed in India I think I shared the testimony with you but I didn't disclose that the brother was instrumental in that testimony the crippled sister yeah maybe see you can see it's all live this is not course so maybe if you can't share that with us what the Lord did there in that service amen we've seen Mighty Miracles here in the church amen follow the holy ghost moving amongst the people amen and we know that's what is promised to the church yes our hearts being turned back to the original Faith amen your brother Branham say only the teaching only they had knowledge only the revelation faith Amen to operate the same power because the mechanics must be accompanied by the Dynamics amen other than that we are just professing something amen hallelujah amen how many if you know you can send somebody to study to be a cook to be a mechanic but they never fix one car they never prepare one meal so don't be like that in the message of the hour have all of the knowledge in your head but you don't put it to your action you don't put it to practice faith without words is there right amen don't be a hero of the word only be a doer of the word and now Lord commanded us go into all the world preach the gospel amen when he commissioned John again in Revelation 10 he said thou must prophesy again amen so the gospel must be in action must

this morning Amen to be here with our pastor genghen Adrian genghen and not see his dad and see Sean here and so on but if his mom is here sister Grace amen may God bless her this morning amen and God and give oh yes he is may God bless her this morning amen uh strangely Saints about I think more than 30 years ago it must have been in the early 90s when uh oh mid 90s or so uh I was with Pastor Paul I Pastor Paul's house here in Palm View amen and one day we all got late and uh we had to go all the way back to Chatsworth for service and I used to spend weekends with brother Joshua brother links and all the Brethren and Gerard and Julian and uh Paul said you know what we're not going to make it in time let's go to Pastor Genghis church and he used to be in a school there in Unit 17 so we popped in the amen and and had a lovely time brother Ronnie was preaching and we had a great time and it's almost all those years since I've had this opportunity Amen to come among you this morning and it's been a long time seeing the family and seeing the household of faith we see you on the live stream now and again and the family watches the services amen they're in Port Elizabeth so I bring you greetings from my family amen the Saints in Port Elizabeth and it's I believe it's miraculous and uh Supernatural amen and we came for a little bit of holiday to get a some break amen but the Lord purposed that we should pass this way amen and see how you're doing amen amen and this morning I I just have the same message and uh so I'm going to the elders are great the ministers and the trustees this morning and all the helps the song leader amen praise the Lord you know me as a song leader in those days and uh sister Teresa and sister Grace and and so on they were the ones singing the solos and in the early days of the conventions what a time that was amen hallelujah amen so we bless the Lord this morning amen that uh I've been ministering now for many many years amen so when you come to a church you know for the first time uh like this you have lots of thoughts and lots of things going in your head but there's one thing you come through which is your reference point your focal point is Lord what is the needs of your amen yes Lord It's not what I want to say yes but what what is your what does your people need Lord yes because when the Deep calls to the Deep yes yes there must be a deep to respond amen hallelujah yes so that's so if you want to pull this morning and you want to say Lord let this preacher if you can use a donkey one time let this preacher speak to me Lord amen not my neighbor but I've come with the Heat this morning I'm desperate speak to me this morning yes and maybe he will twist my tongue and perhaps a man will go in a direction that you will say hey I feel satisfied amen I've received my satisfying portion yes it's not just another service amen but I've heard from God I think that's your desire it might be your desire when I got caught in the congestion I was saying to the Lord Lord speak to me amen I'm leading this morning more than your children amen rather speak to me first Lord that's my desire so may God bless you and pray for me I'm normally a long speaker but you have baptism and sometimes the Lord will speak for 10 minutes sometimes for an hour or so so you pray for me and and I always boast about our Indian community in Durban so don't let me down now you say Amen amen you say glory to God because you really believe it amen you're not because someone's prompting you hallelujah amen sister Karen this morning God bless you I'm sure you miss home there but home is where your heart is amen and your family so we bring greetings amen this morning God richly bless you like never before is my sincere prayer shall we stand together for the reading of the word as we turn in our Bibles to two portions of scripture Hallelujah yeah I was speaking to a young man uh on Friday we arrived on Thursday night and on Friday speaking to a lovely young man Ezekiel murugan that's been married now for a couple of years and uh this morning by chance at his mom's home there and the Lord put this on my heart to tell you amen as I began to speak to him and the Lord began to unveil something to him as well Revelation chapter 10 and verse number five and six Hallelujah Revelation chapter 10 verse 5 and 6. you love the law this morning amen remember says in Feast of the trumpets he says the seventh Angel's message is revelation 10 1-7 Hallelujah it says the seven angels message which is the seventh seal is revelation 10 1-7 Urban want to know what is the seven angels message except Acts 3 Revelation 3 to verse 20 this there unto the angel of the church on laodicea if you want to know the message for the Rapture it's Revelation 10 1-7 he said it Hallelujah that's the seventh seal amen The Silence of the seventh seal thundering out here in Beauty Hallelujah verse 5 and 6 and the word of the Lord reads Paul on the uh John on the Hall of Patmos Amen in 1896 this is what he says and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand uh to heaven and swore by him that liveth forever and ever who created one number one heaven and the things that they're in are the Earth and things that they're in are and the Sea and the things which are therein and here's my text that time that there should be time no longer can you say after me time no longer no longer hallelujah amen and in Ephesians chapter 5 . so I'll take my time amen amen praise the Lord Ephesians chapter 5 and reading from verse number 14 to 2 verse 17. if you found it can you say amen amen Paul writing to the church in Ephesians which parallels the Book of Joshua he says wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and quench Christ shall give the light amen see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools yes but as wise Redeeming the time amen Redeeming the time because the days are evil amen wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is Father we thank you this beautiful morning long if you could use the stem ring stuttering mouth of Moses to speak the third pool if you could use the weakness of Moses the impediment and the embarrassment of Moses to speak the third pool into existence surely Lord we are needy this morning that the great author of this word could stand by us and bring an interpretation to strengthen Us in the time of trouble there were days that are evil and strengthen US law because we are needed we trust you we depend on you Minister through my mouth Minister into the ears of your people in crying nine years O Lord of your children father and we will give you the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated praise the name of Jesus Amen hallelujah praise the Lord my my title this morning is turning back the clock how do I turn back the clock turning back the clock and my subject is Redeeming the time amen can somebody say amen amen we live in a we live from day to day with our stories of Grace yes and each one of us have got an amazing story of Grace amen and a journey of Grace that is so unique and it's so rich and it's so beautiful that you you can't really compare your story to somebody else yes amen but what you do know is that the amazing grace of God that Reckless Love of God that lavish love of God the prodigal story to me is not about really The Prodigal Son that was in lavishness it was the father's lavishness of his love amen and his prodigal you know Reckless love that the father displayed to his son and I believe in every one of our lives that love of God has constrained itself and the love of God has expressed itself yes in such beautiful ways that you could have died sometime amen you could have been so lost yes amen but God came down and he picked you up from the deep Marine clay amen and Samuel's mom Anna says it took me out of the dung Hill yes and he set me among princes and that's why we could never be boastful about anything else but about the love of God yes amen because it's so unique and so special and so beautiful for each one of you that will open up your hearts and they enjoy and and and and experience is love in a special way and when you have that kind of attitude of gratitude towards God and Thanksgiving in your heart for what he's done for you the real truth is you can't judge no one but yourself amen with anybody else but measure your own self against yourself amen amen and when you do that there can't be envy and jealousy and strife in you because the love of God covers a multitude amen and the Beautiful uh amazing goodness of God as our brother wanted about the the testimony I was speaking about God you know in this Bollywood movies and and all of that that you watch they like to use acronyms so I I they're in a village called panga uh where we took two trains to get to that Village Village in November of last year and the real poverty-stricken place and and when I got there the pastor came with this tactics and collected us he drives one of those little tactics so and my voice was all gone uh by that by that time it was uh because of the climate and so on so they gave me some nice hot chai tea uh you know and put lemongrass in there and so on and and really relieved my throat so when I got to the pulpit there was enough Voice Hallelujah and the people were all sitting on the floor sayings not so lovely like the way you are or you know it's so comfortable with air conditioning and all of that they were just sitting on the floor and right to the back and and so on and uh so I spoke on God grace of divine amen hallelujah and just just enjoy the presence of the Lord this bathing over the people and I got lost in in the in in the preaching and it probably went to about an hour 30 minutes or something and then uh the people were just on fire since amen our own Indian Community yeah me this was like colored Pentecostals amen that that was just wrecked with the with the presence of the Lord because they in poverty where there's a bankruptcy of wealth and where there's poverty the fake banking is very high amen hallelujah and signs and wonders follow the word of God in those kind of times but because we live too soft and we live to convenient don't inconvenience me Hallelujah don't come with your attitude towards me amen I know if we have that kind of attitude amen God can't move in our life but these people are desperate yeah and they extremely dead and Reviving The Message desperate respiration creates love amen he says if you want to be you want to have the love of God God makes you desperate another place he says if you want to have Grace then express love for When Love projects Sovereign Grace takes over so it's there and then just and then at the end of the service the anointing was so tangible Hallelujah I didn't realize what I was saying amen and I said bring me though most hardest case that you have it definitely was not me because I did do something like that Hallelujah I said bring me the hardest case that you have amen and then suddenly the the crowd just moved and I see a bit right at the back and I see a lady laying there you know sleeping Their Eyes Are Open she was hearing the word of God and the pastor comes and takes a little bit of oil it has a bottle of oil and he takes me there because I said give me your other steps hallelujah praise the Lord and then we go to her amen and then I remember telling the people I needed to protect myself now and I said it was the faith of the four friends Hallelujah that took the man on a planet and they took him and they opened the Capstone of the roof yes amen and lay because there was no place to enter and they laid him amen down and they opened up the Capstone open up the Capstone of Charity and amen and the lady the palate where Jesus was was standing but Jesus when he healed the man he said watch this he said it's the faith of your friends amen hallelujah let us heal you amen it's gonna be your faith this morning amen that is going to heal your boy Hallelujah that or daughter that doesn't have for him amen Faith put it there amen when there's nothing there like the fish there was amen Peter fishing the whole night Hallelujah it was Faith amen believing in the Unseen that put that fish there Hallelujah so let me not get carried away get to the actual Miracle this morning amen and and I told the people it's going to be your faith amen that's going to heal the sister I've heard the word of God it's going to be your faith and I tell you what I I in me as a natural human being I was all torn up and nervous now I don't know what to expect amen and I we just anointed her as we touched her she sprang up [Applause] amened from head to toe amen and there she sprang up and there amen this is what faith does you got to leave amen amen and the Brethren they took her they took her and she had strength came into her bones and took her to the front and there there was a riot in the church [Music] people were getting healed all over but I remember Pastor Adrian that I said to them close your eyes before the miracle took place and one young sister amen there was over 30 years old she had did not close eyes and an epileptic devil that perilous devil left the sister and jumped into amen the other sister there and then we saw our whole left side got paralyzed and then they called us and we just said sit there sit there a little bit mice we'll come back to you because there were people that were just pulling all over the place amen and then after about 30 odd minutes we went down to our laid hands and the paralytic devil left the sister so what am I trying to tell you that Jesus Christ it's him that does the word we are just a man we are just a man that box yes the Glorious him until last week the glory of the magnificence of the of the piano in its octaves and in its notes and in its flats and amen of fives and six and and all its tones and and and all its instruments sister Karen me cannot you'll not enjoy the magnificence amen that's how beautiful that's God now that is glory amen but you need a mute speaker and there's no notes that Hallelujah you need a speaker that is properly connected amen there has to be a proper connection there's going to be a Oneness hallelujah amen I know amen vibrations Etc that needs to be connected and you are that speaker amen and that speaker just expresses the music and the glory amen of the one that's playing and the notes that's built in there amen that's what the Creator wants this morning and that's what happened in India all we did was Express his goodness it's all about healing this morning glory amen praise the Lord is there any way that we could tone down this my brother there's this icon here it's gonna get my throat all gone and and I'm mainly going to India this coming Monday again uh Sunday so I need a bit of voice hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen thank you brother God bless you and open the windows you're welcome to do that and so that was the testimony that it's Bible days again Hallelujah thinking amen I was busy thinking and and one message that I ministered of later at Pastor pursani was Caleb Caleb the Giant Slayer I was busy with that on in Hebron and a lovely wonderful you know how the Caleb Ministries the bride's Ministry amen and Caleb how he slayed those giants in Hebron and let an anointing fell on David amen because David was actually anointed in Hebron amen and Mac Palace cave wasn't everyone where the resurrection took place and all those wonderful things so I was thinking on that until the Lord interrupted my thoughts and wrote this message of turning back the clock and why because when I was speaking to this young man there was a heavy cigarette of regrets and disappointment and sadness that I could feel was coming from this young wonderful young man he's also a musician in the Pentecostal church amen and I tell you what and the Lord said and the Lord put upon my heart to tell you this morning that this message and this glorious presence of the Shekinah Glory has come to turn back the clock amen yes in each and every one of your lives from time to Eternity amen while you're living in a body of time amen and as the Holy Spirit from the outward expression of time amen and living from day to day and evening to morning becoming the first day etc etc when the Holy Spirit is baptizes you we thank God for Josephine that's going to be water baptized amen and she's being water baptized just by being identified with the church amen and outward expression of an inward book of Grace but on the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen comes into you Hallelujah when the spirit of God the Zoe life of God comes and takes his habitation in your throne room of your heart Hallelujah and circumcising your heart amen now you are you are you are you are invited now you are part of the mystical Body of Christ you're not part of the amen of the Angelic citizenship amen of Heaven Can somebody say Amen you're no more and it's parallel you're in this world but not of this world you're living in a body of time but eternity dwells inside of you and The Eternity is not about a Sunday morning or a Wednesday at night time that eternity is a 24 7 in everything give thanks actually you come to this understanding that whether it is death whether is grateful or it doesn't matter how bad things are all things are good because all things put [Music] s put hold according to his purpose amen then you realize doesn't matter whether my heart is broken doesn't matter how bad things may be or how good things may be it's all good amen because the Eternal preacher inside of you amen overrides your natural thinking it overrides your natural behavior that people cannot understand you yes yes your family can't understand you there's a Joseph anointing that is upon your life whether you will like it or not you will not be the tale Hallelujah they will see leadership they don't see wisdom they will see understanding they'll see an expression of Eternity why you've come to realize you're just a tourist amen you've got to realize when eternity comes inside of you your application your approval for a Visa has been approved because you said I believe amen hallelujah you said I receive because you said that you have recognized that your name has been written in the Lamb's Book of Life yes from before the foundation of the world Amen otherwise these are cliches yeah seven Thunders become cliche Seven Seals are just nice semantics they're nice words they're nice message terminologies the nice Bible phrases but as soon as eternity drops into your soul and you realize you're a citizen from heaven and all those beautiful songs of a tiny little Million Little Miracles and the goodness of God and and Hallelujah and all those wonderful songs that have inspiration only believe Etc they become real they become a man manifested in your life let me give you a practical example when you realize that you're a citizen of Heaven yes and you are born amen from the bosom of God like they were Abraham amen drank from the pamps amen of al-shaddai and you are strengthened in your inner man despite your body failing and despite amen you're feeling as sick as a dog or as sick as anything but as a resolve inside of you when you know that you are from eternity then the people in the time element and in the second dimension that is controlled by watches and atomic time Etc amen they cannot have an impact on you yeah you'll have an impact amen he makes a mistake let gently it's a wrong decision and he makes a mistake all he's got to do because you're a citizen from Heaven all you've got to do it runs into Heaven's Embassy amen now let's take a brother amen and let's say my brother you are from from India for example amen and you just visiting here and and I got a little work payment and so on and let's say you make some error and if you're in trouble not even the South African police absolutely not even the president of South Africa can touch you when you run into the Indians or the continent in South Africa when you're running there yes you are no more in South Africa amen you are in India yes you are in the city no one can touch it president Modi your president you no more understandable amen so when a child that comes from the kingdom of God who comes to a full realization yes that you're a child no more of Mr and Mrs Ronnie and Grace Gillian only amen but you're a Son of God and manifested spoken word Son of God Amen then my brother you are now in Heaven's Embassy you are under the atonement and nobody can touch you all you gotta do if you make a mistake if you backslide you confess you repent yeah you say father I'm sorry because we backslide every day amen but you don't trample the blood of Jesus Christ under your feet and do despite to the spirit of Grace you'll come to your realization you're no more a little child you come to maturity Hallelujah and when you come to maturity you realize you're in the Shekinah Glory in Jerusalem yes you're in Eternal presence of an eternal blood and doesn't matter what anyone says about you doesn't matter who thinks what about you is what God thinks about you is what he says about you it's his word that comes and nobody's opinion hallelujah amen so that is what I I'm bringing you to this morning is that your pasts can't be deleted amen hallelujah the world says you their loss but your loss come from Heaven you live under Heavenly lost yes you love the time is only a shadow yes of of Eternity to come while eternity resides inside of you amen by the word spoken by the spirit of God into your hearts every time that you receive this word whether you're in a church or whether you're in a car or whether you're in a maid or cleaning in somebody's house when you receive the word of God Amen it's the Eternal past that Gene inside of you Hallelujah that says glory to God amen amen so you live by Heaven's laws yeah you do not live amen so the law of Grace amen the law of time cannot have any impact on you amen yes you'll grieve and you'll be sorrowful when you lose a loved one but you know there's a Heavenly representation you know I'm going Amen to meet Hallelujah my loved one and my family where the circle is eternal amen and the Kink of time amen is no more you are in the presence of the Lord hallelujah brother and told us and I'm just moving my inspiration now brother and told us when he lost amen a little uh Sharon Rose amen and there was one coffin over another hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and he was torn he wanted to commit suicide yes amen but God had a Divine Purpose for him amen and one day full of grief full of Sorrow amen just laying and crying his
