TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen the Lord let's turn to our Bibles I greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Amen let's turn to Ephesians chapter 6 praise the Lord I would have asked you to turn to Ephesians chapter 7 but then you'll have to look to yourselves yes amen amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah we'll read from amen verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord amen God's not looking for weak Christians God is looking for strong Christians amen be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might amen put on the whole armor of God that he might be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood amen yes so you can see it's in warin now we wrestling not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen now why would God call us to counter these forces amen these forces are coming to overtake the Earth but God is calling us to come and counter these forces amen amen God didn't send Angels he's saying we wrestle not against amen not the Angelic world we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in I place places now we need an armor for this wherefore take unto you the old Armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day having done all to stand amen stand therefore having your loins G about with truth and having on the breastplate breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen amen and take the elmet of Salvation And The Sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen as for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the Gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated so we come with the authority of what the Lord has placed in our hearts and we take control of atmospheres amen we take control of principalities and Powers amen amen and when we speak words these are not idle words that we are speaking we are taking control of territories even now as we speak hallelujah amen I don't if you know the Lord is the spirit of Truth he said he'll give us the spirit of Truth amen and when that Spirit of truth comes he'll take away all doubt he'll take away all reasoning and he'll make his word very clear to us amen while it's coming fresh how many of you like fresh food oh yes amen amen you got to like fresh food because nobody likes stale food nobody likes leftovers from yesterday my father was like that he liked fresh food every day so this morning amen we be speaking on the armor of God why are we speaking on the of God we're still dealing with likeness of God now remember we said that the Bible doesn't document that man was created in the likeness it said in the image and likeness but verse 27 of chapter 1 in Genesis said and he created man in his own image right and it doesn't say anything about the likeness so the likeness is the development part where you're going to grow up into Christ you're going to function like Christ you are going to function like Jesus amen amen hallelujah amen amen Amen in every area of your life you ought to be functioning like Jesus meaning we will think like Jesus speak like Jesus act like Jesus he like Jesus amen We Will Walk Like Jesus am amen we will come into His very own likeness now I'm going to put a scripture here for you to understand if you are wondering what does the likeness look like it's exactly what Peter describe when he's telling you to add to your [Music] faith what what Peter is trying to Des describ to us is the likeness of God to have the virtue of Jesus to have the knowledge to have the temperance the patience the godliness the brotherly kindness that is the likeness yes amen and then when we fully have that likeness what is there at the top to meet us at the adoption ceremony amen come on now it's the Holy Ghost Brotherly Love is part brotherly kindness is part of those virtues we need to add before the capsule of love comes down and who is that Capstone of love amen God is love before he comes to cap the individual before he comes to kept the the the the the church there's the Holy Spirit to meet you at the adoption ceremony so the holy spirit that gave you your birth at the beginning amen and put that faith in your heart he here now building you up into the likeness of God into the likeness of Jesus Christ until you come to the top there for your adoption ceremony somebody give God praise amen amen that's the likeness of God Amen that's not a [Music] Doctrine Seven Virtues in the church is not a Doctrine it's the Life of Christ coming to the church to bring you into his likeness amen we know what the image of God is the image of God is priest and King Hallelujah so we can preach the message who is this priest and King because that brother Brandon preached who is this mdic and mdic is both priest and King Jesus is Prophet priest and King while the bride is also given a prophetic Ministry amen she becomes the final prophecy of this age yes amen so she's not only priest and King but she also has a word of Prophecy thou must prophesy again amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen so we are coming now when we are building ourselves up into that very own image and likeness Hallelujah now you say but how does a type I'll show you our types who was Esther was Esther a type of the Bride Hallelujah Esther was a type of the Bride but then who is mesic mesic the Bible says he without father and mother amen but somehow the Bible describes Esther as being without father and mother Esther was without father and mother so she was left to the care of Hallelujah who has she left to the care of under a prophetic Ministry Hallelujah so this bride is without father and mother I'm not the son of Charles and Ella brandham without father and without mother you are not the Son and Daughter of of whoever your parents are amen we are here to Quicken that se genene within you and reconnect you back to your roots amen that your father is god without father or mother without beginning of days without ending of days came to show you amen through the message of the hour that you are in the back part of God's mind amen hallelujah and that you are Eternal as God is his eternal that's why mic is without father and mother you were there in the back part of God's mind without father and mother you were bless in the mind of God Amen praise the Lord hallelujah so amen just to show you something very quickly and now to see the time and season that we are living in and that things happen in the world and it's not appaz it yes am there are things that could happen in the world as a sign post for you yes amen like you know we know these two famous pictures we have and this was at the time when they were doing the study of UFOs they were probing and they were looking for unidentified flying objects and they were beaming out signals into the universe is there anybody out there but God Cales down in a pillow of fire and God is light God is light and brother Bram says when you have a birth there's a light he says the size of my button of my shirt that comes into your soul a light comes into you you that's reading the message know that the prophet is saying when you go for an x-ray x-ray it's not an external light giving that light from the inside he says there's an internal Light Within you that produces that light to give it an x-ray so inside of you there's light do you know in the Demonic World they recognize you because of the light you carry yes amen you are the light of the worldall Jesus said you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hid so there's a PowerPoint there brother Josh amen you can put that up Hallelujah so you'll notice here something that happened last week amen last week Saturday it was July the 13th and 13 is signifying [Music] what it's America and prophecy Revelation chapter 13 is speaking about USA yes so on July the 13th there was something that significant to place here at Butler Pennsylvania now notice and this literally got in the room now in Butler Pennsylvania right you know what a butler does he opens the door a butler opens the door okay you go to the next slide I'm just showing you this picture so you can get a glimpse of what I'm saying so you see they're flying under four banners can see the four Flags there and is the church under four banners amen has the church been under four banners yes praise the Lord and then you find here they took a bullet and you can see how it missed him narrowly and it did his here oh yes amen come on now amen you can see it it is here amen praise the Lord if he had turned his head the other way it would have gone through his head right but this is not an I just a random incident so you find here something very significant it hit him on the air but watch here left ear or right ear hit him on the right ear amen praise the Lord you see he falls to the ground and you see the blood dripping now they they said that he he asked the doctor how come there's so much of blood okay how come there's so much of blood he says when when that's the part that bleeds the most your ear for some reason okay and then you see the next picture that he's there at the RNC convention and he's got a bandage on his ear praise the Lord so I know we all wondering what do this type what is it significant of amen and if you want to find an answer we can only go to the word of God yes amen how me if you can say Amen to that amen amen because we find here this is not this is a sign to the church just as much as this was a sign to the church because if you don't know what this is this is the Judgment signs coming upon the Earth amen investigating Angels coming to judge the Earth yes seven angels form the wig what does a wig represent the judge judge of all the Earth so what is he coming to judge now there's a fresh word coming here at this time to a people amen amen that's what we have in the form of the message of the hour fresh word coming to the people amen so then they must be judged based on the word that they preached but what is this also this is the Year of Jubilee yes amen amen this is Jubilee trumpet being sounded amen this is title deed coming back to the Earth yes amen amen what Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden has come back to the Earth amen the title Deeds of man's inheritance meaning you are now have the right to speak with authority oh yes the message come to take away doubt from your heart so therefore you can speak to a mountain and don't doubt because there's no doubt in your heart therefore amen Satan has got no room to walk with because he can only walk through doubt and reasoning but this bride has no doubt and reasoning because the message of the power came to take away all doubt and reasoning amen so therefore she can speak to a mountain and it can move and she don't doubt in her heart but believe what she has said shall come to pass somebody give God praise yes hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord amen so we've been called for a time and season as this amen hallelujah praise the Lord now if you go quickly brother Josh you can put up the Exodus 21 for those of you who don't want to turn to your Bible but if you want to mark it down you can read it in Exodus chapter 21 we're going to find the reason for this now he that in Year let in yeah amen what the spirit is saying that's right and Faith cometh by the hearing hearing amen so Exodus chapter 21 says let's read from verse one now these are the judgments see talking about judgments now right which Thou shalt set before them if thou buy an Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and in the seventh he shall Go free for nothing meaning no price shall be paid it's the Year of Jubilee He must go free am if he come in by himself he shall go out by himself if he will married then his wife shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife he shall have borne him Sons and Daughters the wife and her children shall be a masters and he shall go out by himself if the servant shall plainly say I love my master Master my wife and my children I will not go free then his master shall bring him unto the judges and shall bring him unto the hello shall bring him where B Pennsylvania amen shall bring him to the door yes amen or un to the door HST and his master shall bore his year through with an all and he shall serve him forever meaning that that that this is a sign that they have now totally rejected the message not just any message the message of Revelation 101 amen the message that we have been prophesying again it's a sign amen hallelujah amen put him out there by the butler at the doorpost yes and drove a sign right through his ear amen hallelujah amen showing that they have rejected the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah here what the prophet of God is saying in this now choosing of a bride there's only one message like that preached 1965 paragraph 42 he says remember when the Jubilee year come and the priest rode with his trumpet sounding did our priest ride without trumpet sounding amen amen hallelujah that every slave Go free but if they refused to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and they all bore him through the air and then he served his master always it was put on his ear as a type of hearing Faith cometh by hearing he heard that trumpet but he didn't want to listen to it amen and many time men and women will hear God's truth see it Vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear it there there some other reason there's some other choosing that they have that then to face up to truth and facts therefore the years can be closed to the gospel they'll never hear it again my advice to you when God speaks to your heart you act right then Elijah gave them a choice you see how Elijah gave them a choice choose in this day whom you will serve if God be God serve him but if Bal be God serve him now we see that all the Natural Things is a type of spiritual things as we went through our lesson this morning amen hallelujah amen now that was for those who believe what I just said amen amen amen for the others it was just a story for you but I'm posting you into the time and season now yes because they rejected brother bram's message remember but now this is a sign that they have rejected the bride's message to prophesy again amen they have totally rejected it yes hallelujah amen a total rejection of the word word so watch now very quickly now what is this guy's name Trump Hallelujah his name is Trump so he could be the last Trump the last time Trump serves a natural typing is spiritual is what I'm trying to tell you amen so pay attention of these things note these things and amen I was just blessed when I read that scripture amen and I saw that the door was there and it was Butler and all of these things and now it's tying up and it's in the right year amen amen as a sign as a mark to show them that they are now been marked and they have chosen to stay with demon powers yes yes yes but we are here to serve notice on the devil amen when I'm reading Revelation 6 and I'm seeing this writer come forth you can throw up Revelation chapter 6 there amen I think it's verse 8 you see this Rider coming forth and the Bible says the rider on the horse is called death yes death is sweeping through the land gross Darkness has covered the people and what does the Bible say death and Hell Followed himen meaning if I took you to the fourth dimension right now you'll see it emptied out because hell is on the earth you look at the insanity of man you look at the insanity how demon powers have invaded the human body and how even at this incident people are laughing and saying how could the shooter have missed They're laughing it reminds me of that story where this girl told this preacher I could see my mother fry in hell and I'll just laugh yeah there's actually a group of people that's laughing people are getting fired from their jobs amen people are posting things on the internet amen de crying AR could the shooter of missed it was the only chance to take out a man talking about killing and calling it normal the imaginations of man's heart is continually evil amen it's a sign of the end time Insanity yes but then on the other side behold they God they hail this man as their savior they hail this man as one to bring solution not realizing that there's a king of kings and there's a Lord of lords and his name is Jesus and he is the only solution Amen to men's problems but they have rejected Jesus Christ yes Hallelujah he has made us Kings and Priests unto our God Amen am amen therefore the Bible calls in King of Kings there's King sitting here this morning oh yes but there's one who's King of Kings there's one who's Lord of lords amen hallelujah praise the Lord you know there's something Esther had a birth Esther had a birth and even killing Aon didn't stop the oncoming persecution meaning there's a further work for the bride to do amen just not killing demon powers and slaying demon powers there's a further work for you to do what is that rewrite the laws of the land rewrite your story rewrite your ending amen Satan may have another ending for your life but you come to rewrite the story out he's given you his Signet he's given you his pen he's given you his ink he's given you a spoken word and he's telling you Sons and Daughters of God speak the word am amen amen what happened to The King The King said I can't even change my own laws what's written is written they coming on a certain day to kill you death and Hell Followed him what do you think they're coming for picnic on the Earth and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth what's given unto them what power is [Music] that somebody tell me demon power yes amen hallelujah that's demon power the name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the SW and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the [Music] earth so they have been given some kind of power amen for this final ride they are not here to play with mankind they want to eliminate you they want to eliminate the gods of the earth they want to eliminate the man that's coming back into his position they want to eliminate the man that's got the title deed amen they are not interested in the denominational World they are interested in Sons and Daughters of God who are coming back into their position amen if you don't come into your position you are going to be swept up of this Army that's right amen that's right our preaching amen if I if if I'm here to prepare you for a Rapture I've got to have a word what word what kind of message must I have I must have the message of the hour amen because the thing that's required for the Rapture is rapturing Faith so the word that I'm preaching to you must give you rapturing faith amen yes Lord thank you Lord hallelujah thank you Lord it must be able to counter these forces yes therefore we're reading EP Ephesians chapter 6 the reason it doesn't go into Ephesians chapter 7 is because an army has risen up an army is on the ride right now countering these forces amen I want you to know that bride of Christ is not on the run from these forces the bride of Christ is not powering down amen trying to evade these forces the Bride of Jesus Christ he's directly confronting these forces and in fact she's got the demon powers on the Run amen how through a revelation Satan becomes powerless before her somebody ought to praise God Amen you are thinking amen oh I got all of this knowledge I got all of this messages what is it used for your Revelation is used for your Victory your Revelation is used for your power your Revelation the word of God becomes your artillery that you use amen thus sayth the Lord becomes Atomic Warfare in this amen yes I don't care what situation you're facing in your life you speak the word of God you say I have th say the Lord Satan you come to me with your sickness you come to me with

told the two spies at the sound of Joshua coming just that they heard that Joshua was coming and the people fearful in their heart amen when they hear the bright coming amen when Satan sees that you woke up in the morning amen he gets the greatest headache of his life amen he sees the Bride of Jesus Christ amen marching on the move he tried to kill you many times but you survived it amen God

themselves to bodies amen they need a body to live in they need a body to live in so therefore they attach themselves in a body they real realiz that man possesses the power of the spoken word so they want to attach themselves to this body amen so they can use that body to speak things death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof that's what the Book of Proverbs chapter 18 says death and life are in the power of the tongue now notice it says they that love it what's the it there's a it there there's death and there's life those that love death will eat the fruit of death those that love life will eat the fruit of Life those that love negativity will eat the fruit of negativity those that eat the fruit of positivity amen those that

Christ is saying put on the old armor you can't fight this battle without some of the armor you can't say this armor is weighing me down now don't say I want to be like David the Bible says put on the whole armor of God put it on don't go onto the enemy's ground without the armor amen have your Shield of Faith have the sword of the spirit the breastplate of righteousness your loins G amen with truth your feet shut with the preparation of the gospel and go forth into the battle you are going into battle daily don't live a mundane life don't live an unfulfilled life amen amen every day you are fighting and overcoming every day you are facing demon powers amen maybe you even in your house you never leave your house but Satan can find a way to come in how are you fighting and overcoming those things amen amen amen brother brandom says amen sometimes this thought just comes to me now amen sometimes amen women present themselves in a way that will cause men to last after them and you could be as innocent as innocent can be but the brandom says you'll stand on the day of judgment and you'll answer for adultery because of the way you dressed because of the way you presented your body maybe you live this life a virgin never been touched by a man but they on the Judgment day maybe there's 10 men who are now to stand and answer for adultery because of the way you dressed you know that's a serious thing Hallelujah you know your Prophet spoke these things am amen then on the flip side what about those men with slick tongues flattering lips call everyone the sugar and their

warning men Against Woman Solomon was really affected after his wife finished him if you read there he's saying flee this woman free them thousand wives how many concubines he had he said this adult's woman fle her don't let her come now and entice you hey men you know I go home as soon as I open that door it's like you unlock when you unlock the door it unlock something else now don't be overcome by that amen know how to handle the situation Hallelujah don't be overcome by flatteries of the W woman now hey you so sweet I can see just a nice guy lunchtime you don't want to go we go there get a bunny don't open yourselves up to these things don't put yourselves in positions of those things amen amen carry yourself as a son and daughter of God Amen you are representing the kingdom your are Kingdom ambassadors amen you are here Amen on a battlefield putting on the whole armor of God now what is his armor all of the Armor All of the dressing all of the authority that's been invested in you is part of your adoption meaning that this is not a bride all uh dainty this Bride is a warrior bride amen this bride of Jesus Christ is a warrior bride I also want you to know that there's no such thing as Message Church there's only the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ there's only one body and you are born into it amen you are baptized into that body by one Spirit we are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen so you may have had your birth we' went through this the other week you may have had your birth the Holy Ghost birthed you but the Holy Ghost wants to see you to your adoption you know the the story there goes that the Father the father gets a report from the tutor and the tutor can say this boy he'll be able to handle your business properly and brother Bram actually says there that if there's checks involved he can write checks now I don't know about you but checks involve what money checks involve money meaning that you have the same Authority as God yes yes so what I'm I trying to tell you he don't be like the boy who stayed home he got upset with his father that his father never killed a fatted cal so you've been for the last 40 years 50 years of your life 10 years of your life I don't know how old you are you go around telling everyone your father owns a cattle on a thousand hills how about you go fetch one of those cattles yes you amen go fetch one of those cattles amen he's given you signing Powers brother Bram says amen if he's got men under him the son has the authority now to walk out there now that he's in authority and he can fire that person if he's lazy he can fire him yes what is that knowing who he is like that African slave now the African slave knew who he was so they didn't give him any other food they gave him the same food that the slaves were eating they treated him the same way as the other slaves he slept in the same place that the other slaves slept the only difference was he knew his identity amen and the message of the hour has come to give you your identity in closing now I'm going to tell you this brother the brandom says Ephesians parallels Joshua and in Joshua they were fighting and taking bacter Rory amen so in the book of Ephesians at first he tells you what you are predestinated unto what God put you on the earth for he says you were put on
