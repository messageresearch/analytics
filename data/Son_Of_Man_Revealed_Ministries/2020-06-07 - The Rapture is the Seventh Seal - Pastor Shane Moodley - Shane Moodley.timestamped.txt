[23:01] just a little something email
[23:03] subscription amen we know that she was a

[23:08] amen and I believe all the believers
[23:10] [Music]
[23:11] appreciated a tenant in the church Amen
[23:16] sister Church there was not one that was
[23:17] demanding required much attention amen
[23:21] she's loved coming to church loved being
[23:23] in the presence of the Lord a man not
[23:26] you know somebody who's overly demanding
[23:27] and wanting attention all the time but
[23:29] she was a woman of great faith no matter
[23:32] the trial the situation and the struggle
[23:35] she went through and the sicknesses
[23:36] she was always one who requested prayer
[23:38] and she always said I know my God will
[23:41] heal me amen and she was she we know
[23:43] she's a time-tested memorial she stood
[23:45] the test of time maybe we went through
[23:48] many trials with the family and you know
[23:50] losing a husband at a pretty young age
[23:52] and then having to take care of the rest
[23:55] of the children and raising up in the
[23:56] ways of the law but a burden has always
[23:58] been that our children serve the Lord
[24:01] amen and I believe that maybe he said
[24:03] somehow God can still have grace and
[24:05] mercy and still the desire for heart
[24:07] amen so we certainly gonna miss her in
[24:09] this fellowship Amen see a cheerful
[24:11] bubbly smile every time she come into
[24:13] the answer the Lord Amen so we just
[24:15] wanted to honor her this morning and say
[24:17] Amen and because we never had that
[24:19] opportunity with all of you here so we
[24:21] just want you to remember her and honor
[24:23] her this morning

[24:44] faithful people we see sister Gandhi
[24:47] sitting here a man they probably knows
[24:49] from the type of little boys growing up
[24:51] in the church and now we see amen we
[24:53] come into a time where you know it's the
[24:56] transition of life we transition from
[24:59] this dimension to the next dimension and

[27:54] [Music]
[28:13] [Music]
[28:19] [Music]
[28:35] [Music]
[28:42] is really of all trades I had to say by
[28:47] heart even if they mention it regarding
[28:52] a sister ship
[28:54] many of us without even privileged to go
[28:56] to the field gather and things like that
[29:03] so the bathroom respect you just gonna
[29:06] have a moment of silence and I believe
[29:09] is she's looking down you know someone
[29:13] with the grace of God she's looking down
[29:14] and and should be rejoicing with the
[29:17] Saints they're saying you know what I
[29:18] would have eating chat this morning
[29:20] she was yeah she's looking down and you
[29:24] know very grateful so just to observe a
[29:28] moment of silence and also sister Gandhi
[29:31] one of her sisters passed away she had
[29:35] was the cancer the amputated Elaine
[29:41] Hogan failure and she passed away and
[29:44] and the same thing they was they had a
[29:46] rushed funeral they didn't even allow
[29:50] them to have a proper funeral just a
[29:52] very very shot that was enough and our
[29:54] sister said yes half an hour only and
[29:57] there you know not many people could so
[30:00] just as a mark of respect they just bow
[30:03] her head and just remember that sorry
[30:07] Joshua's brother also Jonathan passed
[30:10] away and the praying and trusting but we
[30:12] thank God we got a testimony day Amen
[30:15] that he believed and he received and was
[30:17] wanting to get baptized and the other
[30:20] miracle day we can say that Joshua was
[30:23] preparing to pool to baptize him so does
[30:26] he come out of hospital but his other
[30:28] brother what's his name Samuel he saw
[30:33] the light and that we were having the
[30:35] service on the house there that Friday
[30:37] and he got touched to there whatever was
[30:40] said and he got baptized in the pool
[30:42] instead of his brother raised alone so
[30:46] we just sort of remember them
[30:47] the mark of respect this bow head for
[30:49] few minutes
[31:01] amen
[31:02] praise the Lord I'm sure they appreciate
[31:03] that you know the Prophet did that it
[31:08] was a sister by the name of Dell sister
[31:10] Belle that you can be seated
[31:12] I want you to get tired there was a
[31:16] sister by the name of Dell colored
[31:18] system was fellowshipping there and he
[31:21] passed away and there was something
[31:23] strange happened there because then the
[31:25] prophet got the call to pray for the
[31:29] system that's not well and serious in
[31:31] hospital the gamer they gave another
[31:34] name and then you knew that suspend then
[31:38] they were actually praying for for the
[31:40] sister which they gave the name mineral
[31:43] it wasn't that sister it was sister
[31:45] Belle Kali sister was in hospital and
[31:49] she passed away and then the Prophet
[31:52] found out later after that that they
[31:54] gave the wrong name and he made a
[31:57] statement he says you know it may be the
[32:00] will of the Lord because it was the hand
[32:03] of the Lord upon her and God didn't want
[32:06] them to pray for her it was time for her
[32:10] to go home so it was something that he
[32:13] actually mentions it see and then he
[32:16] says as a mark of respect let's stand up
[32:18] and remember sister Belle
[32:20] so we praise God for that and we know
[32:23] that according to the word we are going
[32:25] to see them again
[32:26] all those are passed on we know we're
[32:29] going to see them again as we always
[32:31] pray about it you know that God will
[32:34] make a way for us and there I had
[32:36] opposed to the quote this morning I
[32:38] posted quite a few but there was one
[32:40] talking about the token and the word and
[32:42] things like that and I just picked up
[32:44] this trick again and I just read I says
[32:46] yeah
[32:48] one gone one missing yet those of you
[32:51] want one less if you wonder snakes is
[32:53] played here with it to give up and
[32:55] things like that
[32:56] listen carefully now we have been
[32:59] constantly saying that the true evidence
[33:02] of big baptized with the Holy Ghost is
[33:05] for the believer to receive the word
[33:07] for the hedge it would she lives there's
[33:11] a lot the true evidence is to receive
[33:14] the word in the hedge that he look so
[33:18] let me show you this most clearly so it
[33:21] goes on talking about the church edges
[33:22] there and and now there's gonna be
[33:24] people so we thank God for that see that
[33:27] he has revealed is things to us and and
[33:30] we can believe it see not everybody can
[33:32] believe this word the message for the
[33:35] Aged they reject it it has been rejected
[33:38] the messenger has been rejected the
[33:42] message has been rejected but there's a
[33:44] previous maybe bride or receiver that is
[33:47] the evidence of the Holy Ghost I was
[33:49] about I said when he is come he will
[33:52] teach us all things I was going to teach
[33:55] it he's Holy Spirit so how he's going to
[33:59] teach by the way he has ordained and we
[34:04] thank God we have one prophet messenger
[34:05] for the aged as he states here that's
[34:08] for the aged that brings a word of God
[34:10] and then it is given out to all the
[34:13] people I'd be glad see a true revelation
[34:16] that we have received this word is the
[34:19] evidence of the Holy Ghost can anybody
[34:21] else show us any other evidence he says
[34:24] it's not speaking in tongue and not
[34:27] shouting not jumping and always think
[34:29] say so the true evidence is to receive
[34:33] the word for the Aged and we glad for
[34:35] that
[34:35] praise Lord and we glad to be gathered
[34:38] after so long
[34:39] you know they got all these laws and and
[34:42] regulations that you must do this and
[34:44] you can't do that then and if you really
[34:47] look at it it was a foretaste of what's
[34:50] going to happen in the tribulation one
[34:54] of the main thing is people can't by
[34:56] himself now look at it yet that it's
[35:02] around the world people were not able to
[35:04] by himself
[35:05] companies were closed down people were
[35:09] forbidden to run the businesses so it's
[35:12] going to happen like that in the
[35:13] tribulation if they don't take the
[35:16] system the mark the deeds right and the
[35:20] teachings
[35:21] if they don't take it then they are
[35:23] doomed so by pressure everybody's going
[35:26] to take it but the bride will be gone
[35:29] see somewhat thank God for that that you
[35:32] know yes it's told us they'll take them
[35:34] up so this is a foretaste exactly what's
[35:38] gonna happen
[35:39] see and the monitoring people and doing
[35:43] this and doing that and everything else
[35:45] exactly what's going to happen
[35:47] persecution is going to come it's
[35:51] actually a foretaste isn't when they
[35:54] were dictating now we adorn bail we have
[35:58] to obey so when they're gonna come there
[36:00] and then you'll see some of these things
[36:02] in you know left behind those movies and
[36:05] all maybe other people are going to be
[36:07] treated praise the Lord so this is
[36:10] actually a foretaste of everything the
[36:13] money system business economics
[36:16] everything sanctions are being applied
[36:19] amongst Nations right now all these are
[36:22] going to happen yendo in the world and
[36:23] now also another problem preachers in
[36:26] the seals there we the true people that
[36:29] bribe will be forbidden to preach will
[36:34] be forbidden to preach you can't go in
[36:37] the streets and preach and teach a note
[36:38] you must have a license and where you're
[36:42] gonna get the license they must give you
[36:46] the license you must come under the
[36:50] system and you got a license so right
[36:53] now we were forbidden to preach and all
[36:55] this thing and if they stopped us
[36:57] preaches on the road and you tell them
[36:59] I'm a preacher or pastor they'll ask you
[37:01] for your license what are you gonna do
[37:03] that you got no license they say show us
[37:08] proof see and we find these
[37:12] denominations I've got some of them got
[37:13] licensed preachers and this is a
[37:16] foretaste of all what's going to happen
[37:18] in the tribulation so we thank God that
[37:20] he has shown as this thing now some time
[37:22] believers don't want to listen and then
[37:25] realize you know what these things are
[37:27] true when it's preached and breathing it
[37:29] all this has happened you'd better get a
[37:33] wake up
[38:12] listen to the message the world is
[38:15] following apart again the profit bridge
[38:18] in 1960 all that is taking place now
[38:23] rich in 1960
[38:25] look at the writing man and all the
[38:27] chaos because one policeman kills a man
[38:30] of that of the flow they the whole work
[38:33] is in Oprah England
[38:38] everywhere all these things we have a
[38:52] promise very been believed that we thank
[38:56] God that we have a promise
[38:59] so just remember somebody does not work
[39:01] rather setting stuff up yesterday and
[39:17] you said you wouldn't break
[39:21] this I believe yeah now with this
[39:25] condition how mean over 20 years he had
[39:28] a bypass also and he's going to go
[39:30] through this you know this correctly in
[39:33] obviously so disparate and also system
[39:37] victory is not well I think they
[39:39] mentioned something about the lung
[39:40] program or something and also she's had
[39:43] a new great-granddaughter so I think you
[39:46] must have seen the curriculum and many
[39:50] of them I was not expecting to see
[39:52] brother rod here because he was supposed
[39:54] to get a little blue and study all
[40:09] fellowship that all the road and quite
[40:18] see so we take what we can come in there
[40:24] and there will be a name change
[40:35] okay watch the shame I've listened to
[40:40] the one that have Thursday Wednesday or
[40:43] Friday

[44:43] I I was preparing something in this
[44:48] I brought about three things here this
[44:50] morning but I want to speak about the
[44:54] rapture was the same but before we go
[45:01] into all these I just want to beat your
[45:08] attention in this great dividing lines
[45:14] of how the Superman
[45:17] is being brought to our admission
[45:22] through the Holy Spirit we see that
[45:26] there is a diversity that is going on
[45:29] the message lines but they feel but
[45:40] between the lines to the supernatural
[45:47] that was so so as we have gathered
[46:43] together in this great fashion on this
[46:47] side of eternity amen
[46:49] you have for Dean and people amen that
[46:52] would be called by your name that would
[46:55] be a both father through the influence
[46:58] of your spirit amen
[47:01] Lord just to be that portion of that
[47:04] word choice Oh God
[47:06] yes we did nothing father but you are
[47:09] telling all for us when we realize the
[47:13] simplicity in which you have called us
[47:15] yeah and let me look back in our years
[47:18] life there was nothing good about us hey
[47:22] babe but father greet ya
[47:27] [Music]
[47:51] all the time give to your children the
[48:22] undivided attention they will be
[48:24] superimposed power my god to em across
[48:31] there even as we change you now I just
[48:45] want to read you some culture and then
[48:47] going to go into the word of the Lord
[48:49] oh yeah people brother branham tells us
[48:56] here in the exposition of the summer
[48:57] Church ages for the jump in church age
[49:00] he brings this remarkable and profound
[49:04] statement and he said here oneness of
[49:09] the gut it is all the way from Genesis
[49:12] 1:1 in the revelation 22:20 way below
[49:17] but the people have been blinded by an
[49:20] unscripted and structural dogma of a
[49:24] Trinity and then dogma is so universally
[49:29] accepted that you try to see a one-goal
[49:33] person is all but in
[49:38] if people can't see the truth of the
[49:42] garden but fight it they can't see they
[49:46] can't ever see the rest of the truth
[49:49] because the revelation is Jesus Christ
[49:52] his church and his works in the midst of
[49:57] the church for the seventh agency do you
[50:02] get that now I am sure you understand
[50:10] then he says goes on the exposition of
[50:14] the seven churches the revelation of
[50:17] Jesus Christ he brings this and he
[50:20] brings it to our admonition hey Beth
[50:23] I admit that it takes a river and real
[50:27] revelation from the Holy Ghost to see
[50:31] the truth about
[50:35] we are ever in the midst of the
[50:38] perverting of so much scripture but the
[50:45] prevailing overcoming Church is both a
[50:49] revelation so we can expect God to
[50:53] reveal his you actually don't need a
[51:02] revelation on what about this ahead it
[51:05] is right there staring in your face you
[51:08] write an exposition gotta say the United
[51:19] time in sight yit what a time that we
[51:25] are living this great mystery of God
[51:28] being finished but bringing in the
[51:32] garden showing where it is how these
[51:35] little isms and went off and made him
[51:38] this and somebody made him this and
[51:42] somebody made in that but the angel of
[51:46] the Lord come down and brought up all
[51:49] the isms and pull out the truth out of
[51:53] it and presented it and there is just as
[52:00] perfect as it can be
[52:02] no other way you could go there it is
[52:06] that one he is see the Serpent's eat all
[52:10] these different things that's been so
[52:12] mysterious mysteriously amongst the
[52:15] people see what it is what is it this is
[52:19] the sign
[52:21] to what
[52:34] the greatest Atmos vision the greatest
[52:39] of all revelation is the deity the
[52:43] supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ
[52:48] you can't get to first base and kill you
[52:52] believe that you walk out
[52:55] that's what be the same thing and then
[52:58] see the deity be baptized in the name of
[53:03] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[53:05] sins and then you are ready to go in the
[53:08] spirit hey we need to get in the spirit
[53:12] amen the first thing you have to know is
[53:16] the deity of Christ I am the Alpha and
[53:19] the Omega I am from a there's no more
[53:25] but I was at the beginning I will be at
[53:30] the end I am he that was which is and
[53:35] shall come the Almighty think of it
[53:38] that's what so great you just all these
[53:46] quotes were not here for admission a
[53:52] mornin we end the message years now
[54:10] brother Branham was our prophet whatever
[54:15] he needed to bring is broken right and
[54:20] when he is brought out this great
[54:23] revelation of the message of the hour he
[54:26] brought it to a prophetic ministry and
[54:29] also the seventh the fivefold ministry
[54:33] in the scripture the faithful ministry
[54:38] in the
[54:39] Sturgis is world-renowned Tibet but it
[54:45] will have the same only got to motivate
[54:50] those things that you need to know there
[54:56] won't be a conflict of Scripture
[54:59] there won't be a conflict of disability
[55:02] that Minister whatever because their
[55:05] very life that comes with what you
[55:07] believe will edit your minds a man plays
[55:13] no more
[55:14] so we looked at our speaker this morning
[55:15] the festive solonius for verses 16 and I
[55:19] was subject this morning is not sure
[55:21] what the seven see the Lord for the Lord
[55:33] Himself was 16 for the Lord himself
[55:36] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[55:39] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[55:44] the Trump of God the dead in Christ
[55:48] shall rise first
[55:50] so let me
[55:55] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[55:59] in the air so when we are this is here
[56:05] then okay
[56:17] and so shall we ever be with the stinky
[56:23] wherefore comfort one another
[56:26] [Music]
[56:37] Revelation chapter 8 and the
[56:40] relationship that we need so much maybe
[56:46] take it on so much and when he had
[56:56] opened the Seventh Seal There was
[57:00] silence in heaven about the space of in
[57:05] Revelation 7:1 and I saw another mighty
[57:09] angel come down from heaven clothed and
[57:34] we understand now that the prophecy was
[57:39] fulfilled right by the following
[57:43] scripture in Malachi 4:5 behold I will
[57:49] send you Elijah the Prophet before the
[57:51] coming of the Great and dreadful day of
[57:53] the Lord even the coronavirus can't stop
[57:56] it
[57:56] and he shall tell the heart of the
[57:59] father's to the children and the heart
[58:01] of the children to the father's it
[58:02] doesn't smite the earth with a curse our
[58:05] heart says be changed x3 22 for Moses
[58:10] truly said unto the father's a prophet
[58:13] shall the role of a God raise up unto
[58:14] you of your brethren like unto me him
[58:18] shall you hear in all things whatsoever
[58:21] ye shall say unto you behold I will send
[58:25] you Elijah listen to you listen to the
[58:30] spirit of Elijah but you're making
[58:32] mistake and shall come to pass then
[58:36] every soul which will not hear that
[58:38] prophet he shall be destroyed from among
[58:55] even that's sunny be in the day with the
[58:58] Sun man
[59:16] to many of us we have a tendency a
[59:22] tendency of understanding okay
[59:26] that the second series over the sevens
[59:29] here we know everything about it is open
[59:32] and it's all eternity but we don't see
[59:34] the progression of the showmanship the
[59:40] poison the Champa we don't see the
[59:43] progression so the revelation in
[59:46] progression is happening in the blood of
[59:50] Jesus Christ with the understandable
[59:53] supernatural experience by a word by
[59:58] word prophetic ministry to change the
[1:00:01] hearts and being changed it will be
[1:00:04] changing from the inside so we need to
[1:00:15] see the change now you want to savor it
[1:00:18] posture posture change you come from all
[1:00:21] the way from stanga you're seeing this
[1:00:23] and you're seeing that why these you
[1:00:25] know change what is notice there's no
[1:00:27] that there is you don't see and I was
[1:00:30] thinking about it what the very same
[1:00:32] instant why could you seen happen
[1:00:34] whatever is no results I failed you see
[1:00:37] that there was a business I'm fated to
[1:00:41] see that there was another believer
[1:00:43] there are cancer that kami and he was
[1:00:46] shuffling king edward's thank you this
[1:00:48] way doctor a chemo this way that way but
[1:00:52] just one prayer over a telephone and
[1:00:58] these signs shall follow those that
[1:01:01] believe if they lay hands on the sick
[1:01:03] they shall recover this is a good show
[1:01:06] it is more appreciated understood the
[1:01:12] test of time I'm sure I could it's 1963

[1:01:27] message entitled Christ is the mystery
[1:01:31] of God it was preached in Jeffersonville
[1:01:38] Indiana some five months after brother
[1:01:42] Branham experience with the giant crowd

[1:02:42] are out of this layer Basin H we are
[1:02:44] young mark for the lecture so therefore
[1:02:46] we are here together to invite

[1:03:22] anonymous messages and it has to do with
[1:03:27] a great mystery that been hidden under
[1:03:30] the seventh if study with an open mind
[1:03:41] and with prayer the obedient ones will
[1:03:47] be given the revelation contained in the
[1:03:50] powerful self you give with me
[1:03:55] if the Seventh Seal was open what
[1:03:59] mystery beautiful messages let's
[1:04:18] continue pray and move on the purpose
[1:04:23] subject in this sermon is one of the
[1:04:27] most remarkable events events in all of
[1:04:31] history it is next in importance to the
[1:04:36] first coming of Jesus Christ and to the
[1:04:40] Future rapture
[1:04:43] when we come to a point of memory here
[1:04:46] and I John the Baptist for and the first
[1:04:49] coming of the Lord
[1:04:50] you were four and his second coming come
[1:04:54] on now
[1:04:56] so all these things were done not for to
[1:04:59] show
[1:05:30] we know okay you Saints here every
[1:06:15] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[1:06:18] is come in the flesh our fresh as well
[1:06:23] as in the flesh of the Virgin child is
[1:06:27] of God and every spirit that confesseth
[1:06:33] not that Jesus Christ is come in the
[1:06:35] flesh is not a god I wanna check it out
[1:06:41] as we attempt to enter into the meaning
[1:06:47] of the scripture of first John four to
[1:06:51] three
[1:06:53] remember that we are looking at the
[1:06:56] meaning of his great seven men and the
[1:07:01] mystery has been hiding for the mystery
[1:07:05] has to do with Christ in the flesh of a
[1:07:08] prophet for us but then in the fresh of
[1:07:11] every other bright member a mana church
[1:07:15] you know are important you are here now
[1:07:18] he's right there inside of you
[1:07:21] hallelujah
[1:07:23] that's right word made for my neighbor a
[1:07:25] man the richest God not to say for the
[1:07:30] mystery has to do with Christ in the
[1:07:32] flesh first then in the flesh every
[1:07:35] other pride member the riches of the
[1:07:38] glory of this mystery that is now being
[1:07:41] revealed to how a Gentile is Christ in
[1:07:44] us so Christ in us the way we're up
[1:07:59] today the way we conduct ourselves today
[1:08:03] in the every walk in life he chose us
[1:08:10] what type of spirit is governing us as
[1:08:16] human beings we all make mistakes
[1:08:18] I make mistakes but this message has got
[1:08:27] nothing to do mistakes even this message
[1:08:31] was 14 Satan to kill upon our mistakes I
[1:08:36] am God's property I am God's seventh
[1:08:40] year in the one that God has 14 before
[1:08:45] the foundation of the world I am the one
[1:08:48] that will return
[1:09:11] what about bringing the world into the I
[1:10:03] can do all things through Christ Jesus
[1:10:09] forget the dividing lines that's what
[1:10:13] Satan will do to try and distract your
[1:10:16] mind he may distract your human mind
[1:10:20] but he will never ever distract your
[1:10:24] supernatural members because the blood
[1:10:27] is shed when the supernatural comes in
[1:10:30] that is the mind of Christ so we have
[1:10:34] the mind of the message Christ is a
[1:10:43] mystery of God reveal whether the
[1:10:47] Brandon used Colossians 1:15 g29 has his
[1:10:51] text when reading the scriptures and
[1:10:56] coming to the 26th verse he said now I
[1:11:01] want to read that
[1:11:08] then he repeated it in Colossians 1 1 to
[1:11:13] traditions giving the mystery which had
[1:11:17] been hid from ages and from generations
[1:11:20] but now is made manifest to recent then
[1:11:28] he said I want to title this is the
[1:11:32] mystery of God so don't we have a
[1:11:45] tendency of thinking that we are famous
[1:11:49] every failure is a stepping stone to
[1:11:53] success because the footsteps of the
[1:11:56] righteous and the devil cannot come and
[1:12:00] use his footsteps and take your
[1:12:02] restraint
[1:12:03] hello he will try and try and try and
[1:12:06] try and try he can try he will fail
[1:12:09] Jesus Christ is the mystery of God maybe
[1:12:16] rejection he says now God's secret
[1:12:18] mystery he had before the world began
[1:12:21] now back in the third part of God's mind
[1:12:27] there was something that he was trying
[1:12:31] you gotta be breathing that he was
[1:12:34] trying and was great to achieve he was
[1:12:38] trying and he had a motive in doing it
[1:12:48] okay in order to let himself be
[1:12:54] expressed we look at the concept of
[1:12:58] Michelangelo right you get a time
[1:13:05] emerges that for sculpting came up there
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:10] he did that until he came to its
[1:13:12] perfection and everything was that image
[1:13:14] the great image was so identical but the
[1:13:17] only thing that did not happen was it
[1:13:19] could did you say now he was trying to
[1:13:27] have this in other words he was trying
[1:13:31] to make you into the perfect image of
[1:13:36] Christ and the only way that he could
[1:13:42] help you in the perfect image is for you
[1:13:47] to be in the mind of God before the
[1:13:51] foundation of so therefore he was trying
[1:13:56] to exorcise the terrestial
[1:13:59] to celestia you come into a great
[1:14:02] connection that you are connected to the
[1:14:05] maker in them so that you will have
[1:14:08] peace that passes all human
[1:14:10] understanding and your power and spirit
[1:14:14] the goats would Elijah will be the
[1:14:17] spirit that God has set you follow me
[1:14:32] then he goes on to say here now he says
[1:14:35] now God had a purpose and a hidden
[1:14:38] mystery and that's what I want to speak
[1:14:43] unto the church this money the hidden
[1:14:46] mystery of God that he had in his mind
[1:14:49] before the world ever began and how its
[1:14:55] unfolded itself amen right down to this
[1:15:00] present hour and then you will
[1:15:08] understand clearly
[1:15:12] what is being done God's great mystery
[1:15:15] of how is he taught me the secret nobody
[1:15:21] knows nothing about it
[1:15:23] nobody knows nothing about but somebody
[1:15:29] afternoon a 324 of the churches with
[1:15:32] what was intercepted no one knows like
[1:15:34] we need to know nobody knows nothing
[1:15:42] about giving the Angels didn't
[1:15:44] understand it they just wouldn't
[1:15:47] understand
[1:15:48] David a right they ready he didn't
[1:15:54] reveal it that's the reason under our
[1:15:56] seventh mystery the seventh year when
[1:15:59] the seven she was opened there was
[1:16:01] silence in the please no with me in this
[1:16:07] hole that was that he said when the sea
[1:16:22] was open there was it will be very
[1:16:42] important to us
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:17:25] something to germinate within ourself
[1:17:28] and bringing in glory is a spirit
[1:17:39] I hope different unit different
[1:17:41] everything is different but there is a
[1:17:43] spirit white spirits we are baptized in
[1:17:46] the body white spirit in a mystical body
[1:17:49] there's no difference
[1:17:50] amen so that's one spirit that we have
[1:17:53] you have desperate I am
[1:18:20] Jesus when he wasn't they wanted to know
[1:18:24] when you would come and he said it's not
[1:18:30] even given the Sun himself don't know
[1:18:32] when it's free to happen it has been
[1:18:35] questioned question and answers answers
[1:18:37] that time today it should ask in the
[1:18:40] same question in the messages right
[1:19:10] what them was a mystery that was shown
[1:19:14] in every type in the Bible it was Christ
[1:19:18] come down in flesh in the body form of
[1:19:23] his prospect
[1:19:27] okay and ministering to his people in
[1:19:36] our age it was Jesus Christ back on
[1:19:38] earth in the prophet of Malachi 4:5 they
[1:19:42] were meant to prepare the hearts of the
[1:19:46] bride for the rapture in the following
[1:19:51] code the Prophet will tell us again the
[1:19:54] God's great mystery is Christ has been
[1:19:57] revealed that his greatcoat has been
[1:20:01] accomplished and that all the acts of
[1:20:05] the believers in the Bible expressed
[1:20:09] what God's grow was but he said God has
[1:20:15] revealed it to me saying God revealed
[1:20:18] the mystery under the Seventh Seal me to
[1:20:22] him
[1:20:25] so God reveal the seventh seal to him
[1:20:31] then the seventh seal is already
[1:20:34] revealed to us
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:30] because on to say page 17 therefore the
[1:21:34] entire Bible is a revelation of God's
[1:21:36] mystery in class the entire Bible is the
[1:21:40] expression of one goal that God had one
[1:21:43] purpose we wanted to achieve in the
[1:21:45] entire Bible and all the acts of the
[1:21:48] believers in the Bible has been in tight
[1:21:51] and expressing what God Graco is and
[1:21:55] will be judged and now in the last day
[1:22:00] he has rebuilding and shows us and and
[1:22:03] God's help will see it right here this
[1:22:07] morning what the Lord had in his mind
[1:22:11] although and that's explicitly depo you
[1:22:15] can see the great meaning on what it be
[1:22:18] to know this and then try to bring it to
[1:22:22] the people able to the five minutes the
[1:22:26] posture he will come you'll be under the
[1:22:29] anointing crying out sign the
[1:22:33] abomination looking up know what's good
[1:22:37] for them what you need for them to go

[1:24:08] going to even pay attention what the
[1:24:11] clock says I want you to get this so you
[1:24:17] can see here basically in the beginning
[1:24:20] they very thought that God had is mine
[1:24:24] we need it from all those scholars and
[1:24:28] that's just a number as little
[1:24:32] predestinated number of people
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:18] but all these things God is filtering
[1:25:26] through his precious wood and picking
[1:25:29] man spotter for a holy monster he's
[1:25:32] bringing about people that will be
[1:25:35] subjected under the influence of the
[1:25:39] Holy Ghost in this great time of
[1:25:44] understand now the coming of the Lord is
[1:26:06] a mystery is it mystery we don't know
[1:26:09] when he's coming how he's coming but we
[1:26:13] know he's come see so we show what all
[1:26:19] the mysteries of God waiting for this
[1:26:21] last day at least already been completed
[1:26:26] then he reveals he shows what he's done
[1:26:30] oh oh my never give his mystery info he
[1:26:36] ends the code then we look at the flesh
[1:26:40] on sunset expression who was it coming
[1:26:45] up toward in this spirit in the world
[1:26:49] come into a profit was it coming welcome
[1:26:56] that is not being recognized by the
[1:26:59] world today but only
[1:27:03] Electric amen they are the only ones
[1:27:06] that will see now with this Jesus
[1:27:13] scripture has been fulfilled then what
[1:27:17] they will do they will rush your
[1:27:21] Redemption draweth da so you will do
[1:27:28] something to quicken that spirit inside
[1:27:33] of you out of this Laodicean second
[1:27:37] chances to move to the question what
[1:28:23] coming are you speaking up prophet of
[1:28:25] God it's very very important that we
[1:28:28] understand he was not talking about the
[1:28:30] lecture coming notice in the statement
[1:28:35] just about that he said after the coming
[1:28:39] has already been completed then he'll
[1:28:43] reveal you shoot what is done the
[1:28:47] rapture is that future but sunset
[1:28:51] mountain was this friend a man
[1:28:58] I saw understand supernatural be big big
[1:29:06] manifesting front of us ever prophetic
[1:29:10] ministry faithful ministry coming all
[1:29:14] these things are blending amen to
[1:29:17] cherish so that we could rejoice and say
[1:29:20] Lord I am feeling so good the reason
[1:29:31] that was such a tremendous thing then he
[1:29:34] spoke of it here and showed these seven
[1:29:37] thunders and looking like my life
[1:29:39] magazine day
[1:29:40] carried that circle of cloud and like
[1:29:43] there that they could not understand and
[1:29:46] don't know it yet me what you telling me
[1:29:50] go there and wait for these mysteries to
[1:29:54] be revealed able months before it
[1:29:58] happened and then it happened exactly
[1:30:01] the way so now you see how easily we
[1:30:12] could fall astray so the Lord is the
[1:30:17] future event according to testimonies
[1:30:20] 416 when he comes the dead in Christ
[1:30:24] rise but we will see them will rejoice
[1:30:26] though that a light will be caught up to
[1:30:30] meet him in the air and then we are gone
[1:30:33] so what's your question what's the big
[1:30:36] hoorah here
[1:30:36] did everybody if you keep this way to
[1:30:38] beat that 2000 nucleus up and take the
[1:30:46] imaginary thought and bring it with the
