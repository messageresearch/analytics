[2:19] those Brothers meetings
[2:21] then he got healed amen amen so if you
[2:25] if you got sick people if you got people
[2:28] that need Deliverance amen
[2:30] God has different Messengers on the

[3:44] you say oh but must I bring them just
[3:45] for the healing yes
[3:47] healing is the bait
[3:49] Deliverance is the bait whatever it
[3:52] takes for them to hear the word of the
[3:54] Lord amen hallelujah so
[3:58] amen so that'll be seven o'clock on
[4:00] Wednesday amen so come expecting a
[4:02] blessing and the Lord will bless us amen
[4:04] let's turn to Exodus 23 23.
[4:07] amen just one portion of scripture there
[4:09] and then we'll turn to Genesis 18 10.
[4:13] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[4:17] amen isn't he worthy of Praise amen amen
[4:20] amen amen
[4:22] so we were looking at the life of
[4:23] Abraham and we were there in Genesis
[4:26] amen chapter 18 and we were watching how
[4:28] the Lord was moving and coming to give
[4:31] them a message of a body change
[4:34] amen
[4:36] and you say Amen to them amen that's why
[4:39] he came to them now the Angels visit was
[4:42] for a dual purpose
[4:45] amen he came with a dual purpose
[4:48] when he came to this denote amen when he
[4:51] came there in Genesis 18 he comes with a
[4:53] dual purpose and it extends into chapter
[4:55] 19 the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
[4:58] amen so he first comes there we find to
[5:01] Abraham and Sarah and we'll just pick it
[5:04] up as we go so Exodus 23 23 says for
[5:07] mine Angel shall go before thee
[5:10] amen
[5:12] now that was the first Exodus we know
[5:13] the angel of the Lord was in the second
[5:15] Exodus and he's here in the Third Exodus
[5:18] amen so Genesis 18 10 is a type of where
[5:21] we are now and he said I will certainly
[5:24] return unto thee according to the time
[5:27] of life
[5:28] and Lord Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[5:32] amen and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[5:35] which was behind him amen then we're
[5:39] going to go to Psalm 91 amen Psalm 91
[5:46] Psalm 91 from verse 9 says because that
[5:50] was
[5:51] made the Lord which is my refuge even
[5:54] the most high thy habitation
[5:56] therefore shall no evil befall thee
[5:59] neither shall any play Come night thee
[6:01] neither dwelling for he shall give his
[6:04] angels charge over thee amen
[6:07] to keep thee in all thy ways
[6:11] now many people don't like to quote that
[6:13] scripture because the Satan used that
[6:14] scripture
[6:16] when he took him to the Pinnacle of the
[6:19] Temple
[6:20] and told him but Satan is quoting Psalms
[6:23] amen
[6:25] so people like tend to shy away but what
[6:28] is the word of the Lord telling us he
[6:30] shall give his angels charge over thee
[6:32] amen
[6:34] to keep in all thy ways
[6:37] and they shall bear thee up in their
[6:40] hands lest thou Dash thy foot against
[6:42] the storm
[6:43] so you know there's ministering spirits
[6:45] on the earth yes
[6:48] amen then Psalm 34
[6:50] verse 7 to 8
[6:52] Psalm 34
[6:55] the angel of the Lord encampeth around
[6:58] about them that fear Him and delivereth
[7:02] them
[7:03] oh taste and see that the Lord is good
[7:05] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[7:08] amen one more portion of scripture then
[7:11] we can be seated in Hebrews chapter 1
[7:12] verse 14.
[7:14] amen Hebrews chapter 1 verse 14 reads
[7:18] Hallelujah
[7:20] amen so let's maybe read from 13 to get
[7:23] context he was talking about but to
[7:25] which of the Angels heavy at any time
[7:27] sit at my right hand until I make thine
[7:30] enemies thy footstool right but he's
[7:33] saying now he's talking about the angels
[7:35] are they not all ministering Spirits
[7:37] sent forth to minister for them who
[7:41] shall be Heirs of salvation
[7:45] amen you may be seated the Lord and
[7:46] blessings to the reading of his word
[7:48] amen
[7:50] Hallelujah
[7:54] no we don't believe in worship of angels
[7:58] but yet angels are sent on the earth as
[8:01] what ministering spirits
[8:04] and to who The Heirs of salvation
[8:08] amen now many times if we are unaware we
[8:11] are not conscious of the fact that
[8:14] angels are around us
[8:16] Angelic beings are in our homes
[8:19] Angelic beings are in the church
[8:21] Angelic beings accompany us wherever we
[8:24] go
[8:25] amen
[8:27] but sometimes we don't even
[8:29] amen consider these things but yet we
[8:32] find when the Lord is coming down in
[8:34] Genesis Chapter 18 where those two are
[8:36] the Angels he is coming to give a
[8:39] specific message to a specific woman
[8:42] amen and what message is it it's a
[8:45] message of a new body
[8:47] it's a message of a body change
[8:50] so you can say it's a body changing
[8:52] message
[8:53] the message is coming from the heavens
[8:55] to the Earth
[8:57] amen
[8:59] amen and he's telling Sarah behold you
[9:03] shall have a son talking about son we
[9:05] forgot to welcome amen our new
[9:08] member of the church Judah let's welcome
[9:10] him give him a hand amen Mr King back
[9:13] let's give Sister Kim back a hand amen
[9:15] hallelujah she looks so excited to be
[9:17] back
[9:18] amen praise the Lord
[9:21] amen so it's been a month already that
[9:23] is here on the Earth amen we pray that
[9:25] the Lord will continue to be with him
[9:27] and bless him amen even as he grows up
[9:29] in the ways of the Lord amen
[9:31] so when the Lord is telling now what
[9:33] she's telling I'm coming again
[9:35] I will return amen
[9:38] you don't read off it again
[9:42] if you follow the chapter you don't find
[9:46] that he returns there's no physical
[9:48] writing or record of it
[9:50] amen but he says I certainly return unto
[9:53] thee according to the time of life amen
[9:56] so it's a secret coming
[9:58] to Sarah alone
[10:00] amen and when he speaks that word it's
[10:03] as good as the spoken word
[10:06] when he says you shall have a son
[10:08] he's just waiting to fix it now and
[10:11] bring it to pass amen so we know that
[10:14] amen the translation the prophet will
[10:16] tell us here the translation of the
[10:18] Bride will be the same thing
[10:21] amen the word that's in you so there the
[10:24] Angels spoke the word into Sarah he says
[10:26] the word that's in you the body will
[10:28] materialize around that word the same
[10:31] thing did by Sarah
[10:33] amen when that old body that she had
[10:36] that first body it had to be changed in
[10:38] order to produce a son you get it that
[10:41] body could not do it this body cannot do
[10:44] it so it'll have to be changed the same
[10:46] way to receive they son amen amen amen
[10:52] now the Lord Jesus Christ wants to be
[10:54] made welcome in our lives
[10:57] amen amen
[10:59] yes amen amen
[11:03] now we find one time
[11:05] Simon invited Jesus to his house
[11:08] and the prophet of God tells us that he
[11:10] got into the house without being made
[11:12] welcome
[11:14] amen he says the Pharisee was too busy
[11:17] he was meeting doctors and the favorite
[11:19] celebrities he had too much to do to see
[11:22] Jesus come in
[11:25] he says I wonder if that isn't the case
[11:28] today if we're not too busy with our
[11:30] profession
[11:31] and other things that we fail to
[11:33] entertain him
[11:35] is that
[11:37] is it that way in your home is it that
[11:39] way at your church is it that way in
[11:41] your life you pray Lord Jesus come and
[11:44] when he comes you don't pay any
[11:46] attention to him
[11:47] you see like even now
[11:50] we sang the songs
[11:52] we did what we could right amen but now
[11:54] that he's here we're not paying
[11:55] attention to him amen
[12:00] so don't let's get caught up in
[12:02] religious performance
[12:04] amen amen let's let's be sensitive to
[12:07] the spirit now let's not be having a
[12:09] religious performance going on here
[12:11] man amen hallelujah because when the
[12:14] spirit of God moves when his power
[12:15] sweeps through this place
[12:17] Anything Can Happen amen yes according
[12:21] to your faith Anything Can Happen thank
[12:23] you Lord right now amen so get that
[12:26] Spirit off of you get whatever is off of
[12:28] you right now and get involved in the
[12:30] spirit of God
[12:31] amen just say Lord come and anoint me
[12:34] now amen many many men amen I sense a
[12:37] lot of distraction in the church
[12:40] hallelujah amen because you know as much
[12:43] as there's Angelic beings there's
[12:44] demonic forces here
[12:48] Abraham you see if we could open
[12:50] spiritualize right now you'll see
[12:52] there's a great war going on there's a
[12:54] fight going on there's Spirits reaching
[12:56] out to connect connect connect so some
[12:58] unbelief amen but the angel of the Lord
[13:02] is here amen yes now remember the Angels
[13:05] Came in Genesis 18.
[13:07] but the demons were already there in
[13:10] Sodom and Gomorrah
[13:12] they came in as an opposing Force they
[13:14] Prophet tells us they came in a time of
[13:16] investigating judgment that's what we've
[13:18] had when the amen the cloud came down
[13:22] they came down the cloud was the weak
[13:25] amen the weaked one which was the judge
[13:27] amen let's just move on here
[13:29] so he says amen
[13:32] if I he says when it come you don't pay
[13:35] any attention to him is that the way
[13:37] you're treating my Lord if it is shame
[13:39] on you
[13:40] if I know he was coming I'd be looking
[13:43] for him watching for him so I could give
[13:46] him courtesy and make him welcome amen
[13:48] yes didn't we see that in Genesis 18
[13:50] Abraham running to get water in my money
[13:53] to get the lamb Abraham running Amen to
[13:55] fetching bread making him welcome
[13:59] how do I make him welcome well get the
[14:01] Netflix away get the movies away get the
[14:03] pornography away get your nonsense away
[14:08] [Music]
[14:14] amen it's not too hot it's not rocket
[14:17] science
[14:18] you've got to live a pure holy life
[14:21] a clean life
[14:23] amen hallelujah oh I tell you amen we
[14:27] are in a season now where the angels of
[14:29] God need to connect with men amen you
[14:33] didn't hear me amen amen in order for
[14:36] this move of God to move forward the
[14:38] Angelic beings that are here on the
[14:40] earth now need to connect with men and
[14:42] women of God
[14:46] you think the Angels Came there without
[14:48] connecting with Abraham and Sarah
[14:50] come on now you're reading it in the
[14:52] Bible they're coming to the Earth to
[14:54] connect with men
[14:58] amen the prophet tells us look where
[15:01] Abraham was sitting he was sitting by
[15:03] the tent door he says but if you look at
[15:05] a lot you are sitting by the gate
[15:08] amen
[15:12] so when he went to meet lot he had to
[15:14] meet him at the gate you know the gate
[15:16] is further away
[15:17] but get him to your door oh yes sir amen
[15:21] that's what the prophet is teaching us
[15:23] he says but today we're looking for
[15:25] everything but the Lord
[15:29] we are looking for everything but the
[15:31] Lord
[15:35] that's the reason we miss him
[15:37] and I'm going to show you some of the
[15:39] things the prophet says yet startling
[15:41] and you'll find out how we even miss him
[15:44] even amongst us yeah
[15:46] because his presence is unrecognized
[15:49] amen because we are respecters of
[15:52] persons amen because we don't respect
[15:54] officers right right amen but his
[15:57] presence is unrecognized
[16:00] you see why because he comes and he
[16:02] Tabernacles different men and men have
[16:04] different personalities
[16:06] and because you don't agree with their
[16:08] type of preaching and their type of
[16:10] personalities you're dismissive of them
[16:15] amen
[16:18] he says we're looking for everything but
[16:20] the Lord that's the reason we miss him
[16:21] and there he was unwashed feet sitting
[16:23] back in the crowd in that condition
[16:25] isn't it pitiful but that's the way it
[16:27] was that's the way it is today that's
[16:30] where it's in many of our homes when
[16:32] Jesus comes to your heart do you feel
[16:33] like crying you feel like weeping you
[16:35] feel like praising him even now you feel
[16:37] like doing anything but what do you do
[16:38] with him you put him up in the attic
[16:41] you don't want to be expressive
[16:44] he says oh you take him down in the
[16:46] cellar and you go down there and you say
[16:48] thank you
[16:49] mm-hmm
[16:53] amen
[16:54] he says when the spirit of God is making
[16:56] You Weep when he's making you cry on the
[16:58] inside you are taller praise the Lord
[17:00] amen hallelujah
[17:04] not like
[17:07] I don't want this person to see me raise
[17:08] my hand amen we are not your serving one
[17:11] another we don't care if you raise your
[17:13] hand yes
[17:14] we don't care if you Worship the Lord
[17:17] amen we don't care if we get undignified
[17:20] amen we don't care if you dance in the
[17:23] spirit of God Amen so get beside
[17:25] yourself thank you Lord and when the
[17:27] spirit of God comes upon you then you
[17:29] dance like David
[17:31] in the spirit of the Lord comes upon my
[17:34] heart I will sing like David said amen
[17:38] amen yes amen some of us sing so low
[17:42] amen and so slow amen even the ants can
[17:45] hear us
[17:46] amen hallelujah the prophet you know
[17:49] Allah bring context to a quote the
[17:51] prophet is talking about congregational
[17:52] singing and he says I don't care if you
[17:55] can't carry a tune in a cold bucket he
[17:57] says you sing and you Worship the Lord
[17:59] amen amen
[18:01] yeah
[18:03] now some people have taken that out of
[18:05] context and they make that special items
[18:07] and then what happens they become a
[18:09] spectacles to the people
[18:10] and now they're subject to the service
[18:13] because this person is singing Out Of
[18:14] Tune I'll show you another quote way he
[18:16] says if somebody came singing Out Of
[18:18] Tune he says you'll get to the one in
[18:19] charge and tell them don't let them sing
[18:21] No More
[18:22] because the service must be in order
[18:26] amen
[18:28] so in a congregational sin even if you
[18:30] don't sing in tune sing your heart out
[18:32] to the Lord
[18:34] because singing I'm talking about
[18:36] professionals now is a gift as well it
[18:39] carries an anointing you can't be
[18:41] disruptive to a service and let me tell
[18:43] you something when somebody is singing
[18:44] out of Truth and somebody is singing
[18:46] badly amen nobody's rejoicing out there
[18:51] you're actually dampening the cells
[18:56] okay maybe I just feel that way
[18:59] amen
[19:01] so he says sometimes you feel like
[19:02] weeping feel like crying but you're
[19:03] putting him up in the attic or down in
[19:05] the cellar and you get down there and
[19:07] you whisper thank you Jesus you're
[19:09] ashamed of him before your company
[19:12] right
[19:13] if you are you are to repent today
[19:17] amen amen amen
[19:18] give God first place first place first
[19:21] in your life first your best not your
[19:23] second your first
[19:24] seek ye first the kingdom of God
[19:27] amen
[19:30] I'm not ashamed of the Gospel
[19:33] amen
[19:35] amen I forget the tune amen that my wife
[19:39] was singing last week something about
[19:40] being ashamed
[19:42] amen I'm not ashamed
[19:45] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[19:47] Christ
[19:48] amen we should never be ashamed you know
[19:50] what he says now but do you let him sit
[19:53] back when you're talking to your boss
[19:56] and Jesus comes down and he wants you to
[19:58] testify who comes down
[20:02] you feel that tag you need to tell this
[20:03] person something amen but you feel a
[20:05] little embarrassed now
[20:09] Jesus comes down and tells you
[20:14] that the love of God's in your heart Are
[20:16] you ashamed of him do you give him a
[20:18] little corner
[20:22] now the question may be asked how do we
[20:25] entertain Jesus
[20:28] you say come Lord Jesus Come into my
[20:30] heart I love you Lord entertain him if
[20:32] someone come at your house and you don't
[20:33] entertain them they wouldn't come many
[20:35] times
[20:36] maybe that's what's the matter tonight
[20:38] maybe that's mental what's around in our
[20:40] homes in our churches we're afraid
[20:42] ashamed to entertain Jesus
[20:44] you're afraid somebody will you say Amen
[20:49] you're afraid to raise up your hands and
[20:50] give him praise you're ashamed because

[39:10] the air to live among mankind are you
[39:12] conscious of that
[39:15] you see most of us right now we don't

[39:19] servers to finish
[39:20] and we'll go on with our normal lives
[39:23] and never be conscious
[39:25] of the supernatural
[39:34] he says before God sent Jesus to the
[39:36] Earth he sent an angel and an angel came
[39:38] to a home Zechariah and Elizabeth they
[39:40] were renowned believers
[39:42] amen Christians has to call and that's
[39:45] the kind of home that an angel can get
[39:47] to
[39:49] God always had Angels ministering
[39:52] Spirits do you believe it Angels doesn't
[39:54] die what was happening God was just
[39:57] fixing to do something on the Earth
[39:59] so before he always does something he
[40:01] sends an announcement
[40:02] there's Angels come perhaps the Angels
[40:05] visits me visits you and so forth there
[40:07] might be a mining Angels but when you
[40:09] Heir the angel Gabriel coming you take
[40:12] heat something's taking place Gabriel
[40:14] announced the first coming of Jesus and
[40:16] Gabriel will announce the second coming
[40:18] of Jesus Christ is that right
[40:22] have you have you heard Gabriel sound
[40:27] come on now I'm asking you a question
[40:30] if it's recorded in the Bible that
[40:33] Gabriel came to Mary to announce the
[40:36] first coming of Jesus Christ amen amen
[40:38] he says Gabriel will announce the second
[40:40] coming amen now I'm asking you you
[40:43] believe the Lord Jesus Christ will come
[40:45] even now

[40:51] well as he already sounded
[40:55] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[40:58] my first coming yes down there in 1933
[41:01] on the Ohio River
[41:07] gonna run quickly before Jesus come and
[41:10] announce

[41:47] coming Gabriel will announce the second
[41:48] coming of Jesus

[41:53] know what I think today the reason that
[41:54] we don't have no more Angelic
[41:56] visitations that we do we call ourselves
[41:59] Christians and play cards after night
[42:01] read old true story magazines have beer
[42:04] in the ice box and that's the reasons
[42:06] Angels don't visit us you can't mix oil
[42:09] and water
[42:12] praise the Lord
[42:13] amen
[42:16] amen
[42:17] [Music]
[42:30] he says now Angels coming to these homes
[42:32] when they are renowned homes
[42:35] now I know you have renowned homes I
[42:38] know you have strong believers
[42:40] amen then you are ready for Angelic
[42:42] visitation amen amen
[42:45] look at how the prophets approach was he
[42:47] says I desire the prayer of you all that
[42:49] always within my own side Lord keep me
[42:51] little
[42:53] where I can be where he can use me I
[42:56] want to be a place to where when the
[42:59] Angelic beings come out together hello
[43:02] you really
[43:04] don't miss these things now he's saying
[43:07] I want to be to a place to where when
[43:09] the Angelic beings come out together
[43:12] he can say well I know my servant put
[43:15] your name there will mind me amen that's
[43:18] what I want him to do
[43:24] amen praise the Lord
[43:27] oh Hallelujah
[43:29] he's talking about here Babylon the
[43:32] first Babylon number one in the time of
[43:34] nimrod and he says when they had that
[43:36] great conference and made the people of
[43:38] Babylon come in this great Confederation
[43:41] isn't this the same time now look the
[43:43] time of evil going on between the woman
[43:45] sexually and so forth at the same time
[43:48] God had a witness on the earth Enoch who
[43:50] walked with God blamelessly at the same
[43:53] time that evil was appearing Angels
[43:56] appeared on the earth amen
[43:58] [Music]
[44:00] amen
[44:02] now yes where we're trying to get to now
[44:05] Angelic beings Associated together
[44:08] if you've got the holy spirit in your
[44:10] arm if you've got the holy spirit amen
[44:11] watch what he says then you're a
[44:13] candidate for association with the
[44:15] Unseen World and the supernatural amen
[44:18] yes
[44:20] I don't know if you want to be connected
[44:22] there's nothing more frustrating than
[44:24] you're getting a cell phone contract and
[44:26] you have no connection yeah
[44:31] when they give you a new contract you
[44:33] must wait 24 hours that 24 hours feel
[44:36] like 24 days
[44:39] or you do a Sim Swap and they tell you
[44:41] it'll be available in four hours
[44:44] especially maybe you're a businessman or
[44:46] you got some you know some importance
[44:47] that you really rely on the cell phone
[44:49] there's no connection
[44:54] he said if you got the Holy Spirit
[44:55] you're a candidate for association with
[44:58] the Unseen World and the supernatural
[45:00] amen amen
[45:02] now don't be don't be associated with
[45:05] the Unseen word I'm talking about
[45:06] demonic world yeah yes
[45:10] because demonic world is also
[45:12] Supernatural
[45:14] we're talking about God Amen when the
[45:17] Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly
[45:18] it becomes then a truthful being one of
[45:20] the year to die and one of the heaven to
[45:22] live in his body is subject to death but
[45:25] in his soul is fast from Death to unto
[45:26] life in his body he has his Earthly
[45:28] contact with his five senses in his
[45:30] Spirit he has contact with God through
[45:32] the Holy Ghost somebody say praise the
[45:33] Lord amen amen
[45:37] um
[45:38] and the angels of God visit them speaks
[45:41] to them and they are messengers of God
[45:43] from God to reveal and to bring messages
[45:45] from God to the individual now he's
[45:47] talking here about the ministry right he
[45:50] says Daniel when he was closing his
[45:51] ministry there was an angel who followed
[45:54] him and told him you are beloved before
[45:56] God
[45:57] and now Daniel couldn't talk perhaps
[45:59] face to face with God
[46:01] but God sent an angel as an intermediate
[46:04] between him and God Amen that he could
[46:07] talk between them the very word Angels
[46:10] means messenger
[46:14] now I'm not trying to bring anything to
[46:16] me I'm just reading a quote of the
[46:17] Prophet because you need to understand
[46:18] those principles
[46:20] right this can apply to the ministry he
[46:24] says your pastor when he stands here on
[46:25] the platform ministering the word of God
[46:27] he is God's angel to the church
[46:31] Messenger to the church therefore a
[46:34] pastor should never leave that word but
[46:36] stay straight with the word because he's
[46:38] feeding in the shepherd's place because
[46:41] the word passed him in Shepherd look it
[46:43] up and find out if it ain't right if
[46:45] Pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost
[46:48] has made him overseer over a certain
[46:50] flock to feed them with what the word of
[46:52] God
[46:53] let's follow now you see now he's
[46:56] talking about how we are made right
[46:58] so we know we are a three-part being so
[47:01] in your body inside of you we gotta he
[47:03] says inside of you is a spirit another
[47:06] man the outside of you is one man the
[47:08] inside of you is another man so the
[47:10] inside of you is the supernatural
[47:13] amen thank you amen
[47:17] um
[47:18] if you know your five senses can't think
[47:21] it's a spirit man that does the thinking
[47:23] yeah
[47:24] the spirit man that does all the action
[47:26] that conveys it to this body
[47:28] right
[47:30] the inside of you is another man the
[47:32] inside of you Supernatural the outside
[47:33] of you is the physical if you are Spirit
[47:36] led by God you become a messenger of God
[47:38] amen amen om
[47:43] hello
[47:46] God's messenger God's angel is the very
[47:50] same word can't separate it God's
[47:52] messenger or God's angel
[47:58] he has a very powerful one he's asking
[48:02] does an angel from heaven have Authority
[48:04] or the angel at the pulpit what are you
[48:07] saying and which aim and which has the
[48:09] greatest Authority an angel from heaven
[48:11] or an angel like the pulpit which has it
[48:15] he says the angel at the pulpit amen
[48:21] Paul said if an angel from heaven comes
[48:23] down and preach any other gospel to you
[48:25] then this which I have already preached
[48:27] let him be accursed
[48:29] so the angel anointed of the Holy Spirit
[48:31] and with the word stand next to who
[48:39] you see most times we become respecters
[48:41] of person
[48:43] now you ask yourself right you judge
[48:45] because you've had two pastors
[48:48] right the way you talk to me or the way
[48:51] you interact with me will you interact
[48:53] that way with Pastor Ronnie
[48:57] just ask yourself
[48:59] so we become respecters of persons
[49:03] we may be all wanting more High
[49:05] regarding the other
[49:07] but is it the same office
[49:10] amen he says the angel at the pulpit is
[49:13] more powerful than the angel from heaven
[49:14] amen
[49:16] amen maybe maybe a Bitcoin descending to
[49:19] because somebody is younger
[49:23] maybe you not have the same
[49:25] I am just talking
[49:27] because it could be the way you've had a
[49:29] transition sometimes it's easier to
[49:31] respect the older person
[49:33] than a younger person
[49:36] but what am i showing you
[49:39] the man anointed
[49:42] the man Anointed The Prophet says even
[49:45] if you disagree with the man he said you
[49:46] respect that office yes amen that's
[49:48] right
[49:50] and that just goes beyond this uh
[49:52] pastorship yeah any of the faithful
[49:55] Ministry you watch how you speak to them
[49:56] yes you watch how you address them yeah
[49:59] because what are we reading all of you
[50:01] these people are connected with the
[50:02] angel of God they're connected here now
[50:04] if you could only open your eyes in the
[50:06] spiritual and see them connected you
[50:08] think you'll approach him the same way
[50:09] talk to them the same way
[50:11] you won't
[50:15] he says if an angel comes from Heaven to
[50:17] preach any other gospel to you then
[50:19] which I've already preached let him be
[50:21] accustomed so the angel Anointed with
[50:23] the Holy Spirit and with the word stands
[50:26] next to God Amen
[50:29] amen praise the Lord
[50:34] yeah he goes on again Angelic beings is
[50:37] ordained ministers of God to come to the
[50:39] Earth to Bear record of God and they
[50:41] work through
[50:44] just as it did through Daniel and back
[50:47] through the ages
[50:48] now he's trying to reveal himself today
[50:50] to the sick and to the needy in the form
[50:52] of an Angelic being coming down like he
[50:55] did in the pool of Bethesda but upon
[50:57] mankind to reveal himself by showing
[50:59] signs and wonders let me show you how
[51:01] powerful this concept is
[51:02] if a minister is not connected with the
[51:04] Supernatural and with the move of God
[51:09] you know the pastor can control the
[51:11] service right now I can close the
[51:13] service flat sing one song Pray and go
[51:15] home
[51:16] I can kill the move of God right here
[51:21] I can have no vision for the church
[51:24] I can have no vision for you I can be
[51:27] selfish
[51:29] because the pastor controls the what
[51:32] goes on in the spiritual services
[51:34] so if he is not connected
[51:37] that is why the prophet of God says you
[51:39] can't live higher than your pastor
[51:41] because your pastor is feeding you amen
[51:44] and is highly revelated as he is you can
[51:47] only live up to that revelation
[51:50] that's why he says pray for your pastor
[51:51] amen that the Lord will increase his
[51:54] wisdom and understanding and give him
[51:55] revelation of the word because you are
[51:58] being fed from the pastor now some of us
[52:00] I must say this some of us feed the body
[52:03] three times a day
[52:06] fled the spirit man you feed once a week
[52:09] hello
[52:12] we dedicate ourselves to feed the flesh
[52:14] three times a day
[52:17] two times a day
[52:18] how many times a day but the spirit man
[52:21] sometimes you don't even come to church
[52:23] so the spirit man is only eating
[52:28] fortnightly
[52:31] the spirit of man is eating once a month
[52:37] the spirit man needs a Salvation Army
[52:43] it needs resuscitation
[52:46] the spirit man needs to go on trips
[52:52] amen because we are starving it amen I
[52:55] need to bring this to a close now amen
[52:58] hallelujah
[53:00] but the spirit man that's in tune with
[53:02] God
[53:03] that if you speak to this mountain yes
[53:06] the spirit man that's in tune with God
[53:08] that has the faith of God if you say to
[53:11] this mountain yes and don't doubt in
[53:13] your heart but believe what you have
[53:15] said yes it shall come to pass amen
[53:18] yes
[53:20] amen amen praise the Lord that's right
[53:23] praise the Lord
[53:28] thank you let's go to the next one why I
[53:31] just want to go through this very
[53:32] quickly I may not read all of it the
[53:34] minister now is talking about and he
[53:37] says the ambassadors of the throne
[53:38] absolutely an ambassador of the Christ
[53:40] as Authority everything that Christ owns
[53:42] belongs to the Ambassador the old powers
[53:44] of Heaven is right in your hands oh
[53:46] where do we sit the church is Barren and
[53:49] we accept dormant is because we don't
[53:51] recognize these things
[53:57] amen
[53:59] and right we said their demonic forces
[54:01] coming to block he says when Satan is
[54:03] trying to block you from something
[54:04] that's right keep on going regardless
[54:06] Satan was trying to block Abraham and
[54:08] Sarah because he knew there was Angelic
[54:11] visitation coming
[54:12] and then when everything Rises all out
[54:15] of your order then we know something's
[54:17] wrong now I believe maybe if we would
[54:19] listen to Satan we'd miss seeing it like
[54:21] Sarah did
[54:24] you watch that is why sometimes you know
[54:26] as ministers some of you probably know
[54:29] what I'm talking about it's not that we
[54:31] are trying to be different
[54:33] we are trying to protect the anointing
[54:34] amen so even on the way to church we may
[54:37] not want to have much conversation
[54:39] because we are human beings right you
[54:43] could say something or I could say
[54:44] something
[54:45] that maybe we didn't mean to say but
[54:48] then it interrupts the entire atmosphere
[54:50] now maybe I get upset too you get upset
[54:53] now there's a inference in the spirit
[54:55] now we we enter the entire move of God
[54:58] just because of that
[54:59] right so that is why the prophet of God
[55:01] says that the minister should come into
[55:02] the room and just be there meditating
[55:05] amen praying and getting ready for the
[55:08] song leader to call him out
[55:10] amen
[55:12] Hallelujah now I want to stop right
[55:14] there because there's so much more to go
[55:16] through
[55:17] amen
[55:19] Hallelujah
[55:23] maybe let's just go through this while
[55:25] we're on this point because I don't want
[55:26] to come back to this he says yeah in
[55:28] slide 31 you see what kind of homes that
[55:31] Angels come to is homes that trust God
[55:33] don't matter what kind of a home it
[55:35] could be just as long as you trust God
[55:37] whether it's a little humble or
[55:39] whatever it is if you just trust God
[55:42] that's all right that's the reason the
[55:46] Angels don't visit the churches the
[55:48] reason Angels don't visit homes we've
[55:50] got to get down to deep sincerity of
[55:52] this thing
[55:52] the angels of God on Earth tonight just
[55:55] the same as they always been
[55:58] yes
[56:00] amen there's righteous people walking in
[56:03] all the light of the Lord that's the
[56:05] kind of home that God can get into now
[56:07] if you're serving all kinds of parties
[56:08] and beers and everything in your house
[56:10] God will never visit you there yes but
[56:13] if you've got a home cleaned up and
[56:14] living for God with prayer and the Bible
[56:16] open and a few tear stains on it God can
[56:18] visit you because you've opened up a
[56:21] channel that he can come to and there is
[56:23] where it is
[56:26] yeah what the prophet is praying now and
[56:28] you thinking hey you you're telling me
[56:30] that the yeah the prophet is asking
[56:32] angels to go for May the angels of God
[56:34] come down into the City and the cities
[56:36] around throughout the country visit
[56:38] homes stir people Grant your lord
[56:41] yes amen amen
[56:50] are you telling me that I can uh pray
[56:53] for an angel to come
[56:54] go for it I prayed many times Lord send
[56:57] your angel touch and deliver and
[56:59] heal
[57:00] and you watch the angel of God Goes
[57:02] Forth amen
[57:03] amen amen
[57:06] now the prophet is saying May the angel
[57:08] of God go
[57:10] to the country visit home stop people
[57:12] granted Lord may they be an
[57:14] old-fashioned Revival begin to move Lord
[57:16] that you'll just continue on and on and
[57:19] on and I pray that you'll send the Holy
[57:21] Spirit The Immortal angels from the
[57:24] celestial Realms of glory and may they
[57:26] take their positions tonight at every
[57:28] Row in the building
[57:30] in the balcony on the floor on the
[57:32] platform may they speak to the people's
[57:34] heart as Messengers ministering Spirits
[57:36] sent from the presence of God
[57:40] amen he says God still has Angels they
[57:43] visit the people not worship of angels
[57:45] but Angelic beings who are attributes of
[57:47] God send forth to minister to the church
[57:49] through the people
[57:50] or how short are we of real Apostolic
[57:53] church today of the blessing
[57:56] amen amen
[58:01] amen let's just stop there
[58:04] I want to close with this
[58:07] people were skeptical about Angelic
[58:09] visitation and Angelic association with
[58:12] the prophet
[58:13] and when he told them that the angel of
[58:15] God came to me in the cave
[58:17] and out of this ball of light step to
[58:19] 200 pound man
[58:21] and he told me that I was to take the
[58:23] gift of healing to the Nations
[58:26] they didn't want to believe him
[58:28] in fact he went and he told his Baptist
[58:31] pastor
[58:33] and his Baptist pastor
[58:35] laughed at him
[58:37] told him maybe you had something yeah
[58:39] eat something you mean you why would God
[58:43] angel of God come to you
[58:45] mean he bypass all these theologians yes
[58:48] yes
[58:49] and he come to you meet you in a cave
[58:53] he says yes
[58:56] and then you know he was preaching and
[58:58] he had to end in his solution yeah
[59:00] right to connect with the angel of God
[59:07] but in 1950 all of that changed
[59:11] foreign
[59:13] all this time from 19 he met the angel
[59:16] in the cave in 1946 yeah
[59:19] 1950 there was physical evidence to go
[59:23] to slide number 48. there was meetings
[59:25] taking place
[59:27] amen
[59:30] in Houston
[59:32] Coliseum brother Branham was having a
[59:35] Revival
[59:37] and him and every Bosman were hosting
[59:40] these meetings yes and they were having
[59:42] it in such a Auditorium
[59:44] and on January 20th they were moving it
[59:47] to the Coliseum
[59:48] the Sam Houston Coliseum
[59:51] amen
[59:55] if you can see down there can you see
[59:56] the crowd of people yes
[1:00:00] yes right so this was a big Coliseum
[1:00:04] but you know if you go to the next slide
[1:00:07] there was a Baptist cleric who put out a
[1:00:09] challenge
[1:00:11] and he was a pastor in Houston and he
[1:00:15] was upset
[1:00:17] that these men of God were coming
[1:00:19] with the message of Divine Healing and
[1:00:22] Healing The Sick he probably felt
[1:00:24] threatened by position yes amen amen and
[1:00:27] the Baptist living began to challenge
[1:00:28] these miracle workers he called him he
[1:00:31] called him Miracle Man
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:35] so he began to say things against him
[1:00:37] and you know how the prophet relates it
[1:00:40] amen many of you familiar with the
[1:00:42] message you'll know how if your boss
[1:00:44] would say we ought to go up there and
[1:00:46] say something he's challenging us the
[1:00:47] prophet says I'm not going to debate and
[1:00:49] fuss
[1:00:50] then brother told him okay I'll do it in
[1:00:53] a civil war one yeah I won't do all of
[1:00:55] that the prophet says well if you go
[1:00:56] you're going to do that then it's fine
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:00] but yeah The Showdown came
[1:01:02] yeah you had FM Boswell
[1:01:04] you had William Branham
[1:01:07] and Satan said his best
[1:01:12] what's his name yes
[1:01:15] what's his initials
[1:01:18] they thought we are the best
[1:01:21] his initials is we
[1:01:23] was telling everyone we best
[1:01:27] some of you didn't get it
[1:01:30] they thought they were the best in the
[1:01:32] city
[1:01:33] Satan sent his best
[1:01:36] little did he know that's God's best was
[1:01:39] on Earth amen yes
[1:01:42] amen amen
[1:01:45] he was the Baptist champion
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:51] he was he was telling them that the
[1:01:54] healings now there's a whole article
[1:01:56] there that you can read you probably
[1:01:57] won't be able to read it here but so
[1:02:00] January 20th is the day they're going to
[1:02:02] start the meetings
[1:02:04] at the Coliseum and the expecting
[1:02:06] thousands and thousands of people to
[1:02:07] come and be here
[1:02:09] so they are expecting this meeting to
[1:02:11] take place so they decided seeing that
[1:02:13] we're having it in Sam Houston Coliseum
[1:02:15] with all the debate there
[1:02:17] all the debates in the morning
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:23] and I think the debate lasted for like
[1:02:25] four hours and they told the people now
[1:02:27] every Boston was a smart he started to
[1:02:29] use the audience as testimony
[1:02:33] of the healings that God was doing in
[1:02:34] the meetings
[1:02:36] amen so they asked the audience every
[1:02:39] time they agreed with either minister
[1:02:40] they either said no or they said amen
[1:02:45] so brother would come and he would ask
[1:02:47] him and if you've been healed in the
[1:02:48] meetings and he says Andrews would stand
[1:02:50] up so just for this meeting alone 8 000
[1:02:53] people came to the debate
[1:02:55] all right
[1:02:58] eight thousand came
[1:03:00] and even the sick came because they were
[1:03:02] expecting to be healed
[1:03:03] amen hallelujah you go to the next
[1:03:06] picture here you'll see Dr best
[1:03:09] and there's where the boss was sitting
[1:03:10] there can you see that and now he's like
[1:03:12] pointing to him
[1:03:15] and every time
[1:03:18] if you read the article it became so
[1:03:20] heated
[1:03:22] that the fight broke out at the bottom
[1:03:24] there between two ministers
[1:03:30] yeah
[1:03:31] you see the guy got his court he had to
[1:03:33] take off his coat and he was looking for
[1:03:34] the one who hit him and they were
[1:03:36] fighting
[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:39] so brother this best he is a complaint
[1:03:44] was
[1:03:46] the god
[1:03:48] doesn't work in the same Apostolic way
[1:03:51] men can't heal
[1:03:52] but the prophet of God comes in the end
[1:03:55] and he settles it by telling them I
[1:03:58] never claim to heal anyone
[1:04:01] all right you see there would be a great
[1:04:04] problem in the message today the brother
[1:04:06] Branham was still alive
[1:04:09] hmm because most people would be looking
[1:04:13] to William Branham for the healing
[1:04:15] and not to Jesus Christ
[1:04:20] yes
[1:04:22] it seems like man always wants to look
[1:04:24] to another man
[1:04:26] and that's a denominational idea
[1:04:29] so
[1:04:30] while they were doing this they hired
[1:04:32] photographer and he took pictures
[1:04:35] and he went and he developed those
[1:04:38] pictures after the meeting
[1:04:42] and he says the first one came out blank
[1:04:45] and the next five
[1:04:47] so if the first one came out blank and
[1:04:50] the next five
[1:04:51] so six came out blank
[1:04:54] but he says when I pulled out the
[1:04:57] seventh one amen oh yes
[1:05:00] hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:05:03] connection with the supernatural amen
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:08] now they took it to
[1:05:12] yeah what the prophet says now he says
[1:05:14] God will testify this in fact this was
[1:05:16] the prophet's last closing words
[1:05:18] he said God will testify I shall say no
[1:05:22] more and he didn't even know the light
[1:05:23] was there
[1:05:24] amen the prophet closed that
[1:05:27] Thing by saying God will testify I shall
[1:05:30] say no more
[1:05:31] right so he says here Mr kipperman's
[1:05:34] associate quickly went to work
[1:05:35] developing the pro the the photographs
[1:05:38] he noticed something odd as he drew the
[1:05:40] first photograph from developing
[1:05:41] solution
[1:05:43] it like the next five was blank he
[1:05:45] grabbed his ass and fell forth and when
[1:05:47] he pulled the last which was the seventh
[1:05:49] from the solution there on the
[1:05:51] photograph was the pillar of fire in a
[1:05:54] visible form resting over the head of
[1:05:56] God's Prophet William Marion Branham
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:02] here is the actual document
[1:06:07] I don't think you'll be able to read it
[1:06:09] but this is the official report that
[1:06:11] George J Lacey wrote
[1:06:13] The Examiner of question documents now
[1:06:17] these
[1:06:18] people who don't believe the sign they
[1:06:20] call themselves believe the sign
[1:06:22] they don't believe the sign they are
[1:06:25] putting it up now that this was a light
[1:06:27] in the building
[1:06:29] now you're telling me
[1:06:31] this FBI agent
[1:06:34] Mr
[1:06:38] hey
[1:06:40] it was Gordon Lindsay who took the
[1:06:41] photograph and presented it to
[1:06:44] George Lacy and Tony please
[1:06:47] investigate this picture
[1:06:49] look at the negative tell me if it's
[1:06:51] been tampered with tell me if anything
[1:06:53] has been done to this thing so if you
[1:06:55] read the report it'll tell you the exact
[1:06:57] process and procedures they've done and
[1:06:59] he ends it by saying
[1:07:03] based on the above description describe
[1:07:06] examination and study I am often
[1:07:09] different opinion that the negative
[1:07:11] submitted for examination was not
[1:07:13] retouched nor was it a composite or
[1:07:16] double exposed negative
[1:07:20] but we got some internet detectives
[1:07:24] wasn't even there
[1:07:29] you think was it wouldn't have told
[1:07:30] every brand before there was light above
[1:07:32] your head
[1:07:34] hey
[1:07:38] he says further I am of the definite
[1:07:41] opinion that the light streak appearing
[1:07:43] above the head in the Halo position was
[1:07:45] caused by light striking the negative
[1:07:51] now the accused the prophet of saying in
[1:07:54] Psychology and he told the prophet that
[1:07:57] the camera can't photograph psychology
[1:08:01] so a supernatural being was there
[1:08:04] so we
[1:08:07] are in contact with Angelic beings right
[1:08:09] here where the Prophet would summarize
[1:08:10] it by saying now I say this with
[1:08:12] humbleness I say this with pride
[1:08:15] I see this posting all of you all are
[1:08:18] false
[1:08:23] God is only moving through me
[1:08:27] I say this with humbleness and with
[1:08:29] reference to him
[1:08:30] who is present
[1:08:33] that is the light that I have seen that
[1:08:37] was the light way over my cradle when I
[1:08:39] was born
[1:08:40] that's a light from there came a voice
[1:08:42] and talked to me down through my life
[1:08:43] that stole things by the hundreds of
[1:08:45] things and search out anyone you wish to
[1:08:49] from Africa around the world in my own
[1:08:51] city doctors attorneys Wherever You Wish
[1:08:53] and see if you ever one time it failed
[1:08:56] to be exactly what he said it was
[1:08:58] that's what speaks here at the platform
[1:09:01] not your brother
[1:09:04] did we just establish now that angelic
[1:09:08] spirits come to anoint the ministers he
[1:09:11] says that's the one that speaks now not
[1:09:13] your brother
[1:09:14] amen now I believe with all my heart how
[1:09:15] many of you knows that there was a pull
[1:09:18] of fire that followed the children of
[1:09:19] Israel that guided them in the
[1:09:20] wilderness I don't know if he knows that
[1:09:22] was
[1:09:23] Jesus Christ the Christ the angel was
[1:09:26] the Covenant your teachers and when he
[1:09:28] was you on Earth he was the same God
[1:09:34] so every Exodus must have the
[1:09:37] association with the Unseen World
[1:09:40] every Exodus
[1:09:43] yes amen
[1:09:45] now you've experienced a supernatural in
[1:09:47] your life and maybe you haven't been
[1:09:50] conscious
[1:09:52] that it was
[1:09:53] ministering spirits that he was like
[1:09:56] Angelic beings
[1:09:58] you've had 40 Years of preaching however
[1:10:01] long you've been in the message of the
[1:10:03] hour you've been impacted by the
[1:10:05] preaching your lives have been changed
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:09] what is it you think you're listening to
[1:10:11] words of man you think words of man can
[1:10:13] change people like that
[1:10:17] it's ministering spirits
[1:10:20] it's the Holy Spirit anointing men
[1:10:24] and men have different diversities of
[1:10:26] gifts
[1:10:27] if you read First Corinthians chapter 12
[1:10:30] you'll read how they are diversities of
[1:10:32] gifts in the body
[1:10:36] and there's a quote
[1:10:37] which ties up with First Corinthians
[1:10:40] chapter 12. that the body is fitly
[1:10:42] framed together
[1:10:44] and by one Spirit we are all baptized
[1:10:46] into the body
[1:10:47] now I cannot expect
[1:10:50] you know sometimes people may
[1:10:51] misunderstand this we preach it in such
[1:10:54] a way that all of you will be doing the
[1:10:55] same things
[1:10:57] but the toe cannot perform
[1:11:01] like my thumb
[1:11:04] the tongue
[1:11:05] all have different functions
[1:11:11] push it that way because we want you to
[1:11:13] find your place and your position
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:16] some of you may have a position of an
[1:11:18] intercessor some of you may have the
[1:11:20] position amen where you can fast some of
[1:11:22] you have the position where you can pray
[1:11:23] long hours
[1:11:25] some of you may have diversities of
[1:11:28] gifts
[1:11:29] but it is needed in the body and when
[1:11:32] the body comes together
[1:11:34] it is fatally friend
[1:11:36] everyone functioning everything
[1:11:38] functioning perfectly then there's
[1:11:40] external organs and then there's
[1:11:42] internal organs
[1:11:43] all part of the same body
[1:11:49] the prophet would say they ask him in
[1:11:51] question and answers will everyone heal
[1:11:54] will everyone be able to speak he says
[1:11:56] no
[1:11:58] he says as God gives it lets it out
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:05] has God
[1:12:07] position his body and framed his body
[1:12:12] he says you operate in your position
[1:12:15] you can't be
[1:12:17] a one dollar bill if he's made you a 50
[1:12:19] cents
[1:12:21] that's what he's teaching us
[1:12:23] he says otherwise you become an
[1:12:25] impersonator
[1:12:27] now we don't want to impersonate nothing
[1:12:28] yes
[1:12:30] and say you know I'll try and be like a
[1:12:33] prophet and try to operate a gift of
[1:12:35] discernment
[1:12:36] amen I'm not a prophet the angel didn't
[1:12:39] come to me and tell me that I'll have a
[1:12:41] gift like this
[1:12:44] amen I need to be true to who God made
[1:12:47] me to be true to God who God made you to
[1:12:50] be and never tried to impersonate
[1:12:52] nothing
[1:12:54] amen
[1:12:56] when the spirit of God moves you'll know
[1:12:57] it
[1:12:58] amen like what you've seen
[1:13:01] the spirit of God has moved in your life
[1:13:03] and look at the miraculous that has
[1:13:05] taken place in your life yes thank you
[1:13:06] who did it I don't know if you can
[1:13:08] boasted you didn't
[1:13:11] how if you can boast it you have one
[1:13:13] thing to do with it you know if I could
[1:13:15] heal you I'd heal every one of you
[1:13:18] amen or maybe if I'm selfish and I don't
[1:13:21] like him maybe you are one here but
[1:13:23] that's based on humanneness
[1:13:27] amen but the power of God is not like
[1:13:29] that God is not a man
[1:13:32] his ways are higher than our ways his
[1:13:34] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[1:13:36] amen so we should always always say Lord
[1:13:40] It's Your Grace towards me
[1:13:42] that you choose to use me in this
[1:13:44] measure
[1:13:45] amen it's the grace of the Lord
[1:13:49] it's the grace of the Lord that you and
[1:13:50] I see the message of the hour
[1:13:53] we must never forget that
[1:13:57] did he not say that we
[1:14:00] are saved by grace
[1:14:03] through faith
[1:14:04] it's first his grace
[1:14:07] first his grace amen
[1:14:10] Hallelujah
[1:14:12] so we have an association with an Unseen
[1:14:14] World
[1:14:15] we have the association with the Angelic
[1:14:17] world
[1:14:18] the angels that came to Abraham and
[1:14:20] Sarah that day are the same Angels
[1:14:22] that's here on the earth now
[1:14:24] right between the second war and the
[1:14:26] third world he says there are three
[1:14:28] Angels message going forth
[1:14:32] now the third world
[1:14:35] the cycle of it has already started yes
[1:14:37] amen you know what sapping between
[1:14:39] Russia and Ukraine
[1:14:42] actually because of the years that have
[1:14:44] passed
[1:14:46] Russia has developed in a messed a
[1:14:49] massive amount of
[1:14:50] bombs and ammunition and
[1:14:53] and weapons and they've never been able
[1:14:55] to test it
[1:14:57] because they're never in a war and
[1:15:00] America was always wondering what kind
[1:15:02] of Weaponry they have
[1:15:04] and whether they'll be able to fight
[1:15:05] them
[1:15:06] so they have used Ukraine
[1:15:09] as the battlefield
[1:15:11] so Russia is testing out their best
[1:15:13] military equipment there
[1:15:15] and whose military equipment do you
[1:15:17] think is being used to counter
[1:15:19] it's the USA's because now for the first
[1:15:21] time they can actually see if they send
[1:15:23] a missile can we send an opposing one to
[1:15:25] actually
[1:15:27] it's like what they call it military
[1:15:30] exercise
[1:15:31] a proxy war being fought
[1:15:34] USA
[1:15:36] exercising the power
[1:15:38] amen what you are seeing is Bible
[1:15:40] prophecy yes yes amen amen
[1:15:43] I don't know if you think they're all
[1:15:44] just going to back up and go home
[1:15:48] amen
[1:15:49] so it's building up to something just
[1:15:51] like how the Lord is building us up to
[1:15:53] something
[1:15:54] amen then we always want to stay humble
[1:15:57] want to stay submitted to the Holy
[1:15:59] Spirit want to stay submitted to one
[1:16:01] another and say Lord
[1:16:03] help us amen
[1:16:05] it can be so close because remember to
[1:16:08] be so close that you will deceive the
[1:16:10] very elective possible
[1:16:11] now we don't want to get deceived by
[1:16:14] carrying ons and imaginations
[1:16:18] amen remember when when uh
[1:16:21] was it Martin that wanted to move with
[1:16:23] the spirit of God did an angel come
[1:16:25] before him
[1:16:27] and say I am Jesus worship me so you got
[1:16:31] to be able to have discernment
[1:16:33] not to associate
[1:16:34] for the wrong Unseen World
[1:16:38] check it out by the word is this a move
[1:16:40] of God is this how you're moving God
[1:16:42] Amen
[1:16:44] amen with that said let's stand let's
[1:16:46] just be reverent in his presence
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:54] we have an association with the Unseen
[1:16:56] World
[1:16:57] and I believe even right now they are
[1:16:59] here
[1:17:01] they've been sitting and listening
[1:17:04] the same Angels Wayne Brennan's meetings
