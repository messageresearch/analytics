just keep remembering those prayer requests amen Pastor n is in the hospital as well amen Pastor Ruben Daniels and uh Amen brother raes gave the prayer request hallelujah sister Michelle says must remember daughter Abigail in prayer amen hallelujah so we bring this prayer request after the preaching of the word amen let's turn to our Bibles amen Genesis chapter 1 speak on uh little thought before we get to prayer amen Abstract title Deeds of for adopted Sons amen the abstract title deed are for adopted Sons amen that's not just for anybody Genesis chapter 1 we'll read from verse 28 and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the F of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth of every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree healing SE seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every foul of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so amen let's also turn Amen to the book of Acts Acts chapter 2 amen praise the Lord Acts chapter 2 we'll read from verse 38 then Peter said unto them repent now remember there are some action words here amen repent is an action word baptize is an action word amen then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins so once that is done there's a promise attached and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you now this is a promise how does God measure faithfulness by what we have done with promise for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen one more portion of scripture so that there is a promise that's an inheritance given to us Genesis chapter 13 after his separation from unbelief we'll read amen about Abraham we know we are Seed of Abraham children of Abraham After the Promise so Genesis chapter 13 and verse 14 says now remember he's now separated from lot lot lot is typing the world and the Lord said unto Abraham after that lot was separated from him amen lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art so the place where we are standing positionally now in 2025 let's look from there amen northward Southward Eastward and Westward so God is asking us to look in all directions amen amen because we are to possess all all things so he's telling him to look but let's see why is he telling him to look amen for all the land which thou see to thee will I give it amen and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise and walk through the land now while we are reading this I want you to understand the land is the Holy Ghost so so when he's saying I'm giving you the land I I want you to look northward of the Holy Ghost Eastward Westward and Southward don't be one dimensional of the Holy Ghost we need to get into all dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord walk through the land the length of it the breadth of it for I will give it unto you don't just stop at speaking in tongues yes but move on Amen Hallelujah the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen trust everyone is well amen hallelujah amen when we come into the house of the Lord remember uh we we're not back in the Ford mot days of the early days where they had this crank thing in the front of the car where we have to warm our engines you remember back in the day amen you had to sit in your car a little while and hidle the car now people don't do that anymore praise the Lord amen so I pray uh I am actually speaking about you I pray we don't have to warm engines amen amen but that uh each service is a continuity amen so we are speaking about the abstract titled deed which are for adopted Sons amen hallelujah now we know that God is giving something to Adam right and what he is giving him is an inheritance Adam can't say that he worked for what he received yes God is working through six days of creation what is an inheritance an inheritance is given to you am is everyone paying attention we the things that we work for is not our inheritance we worked for it and inheritance is somebody else gave it to you so God is working through six days of creation and then we read in Genesis 1 from verse 28 he's now saying all all this I have created here on the earth I am giving it to you so inheritance is given for continuity that's right all that God worked to achieve he now placing it in the hand of his son and he wants continuity Hallelujah all of a man's labor all that he works for on the earth is for continuity he builds it up so that the Next Generation can live off the fruit of his labors amen amen amen hallelujah and The Inheritance is not meant to be Grievous The Inheritance is not made to make your life difficult The Inheritance is meant to be a blessing hallelujah amen so the one that is going to receive it is going to be blessed by The Inheritance amen and the one who is going to receive it is remember he has to live in The Inheritance yes so so what we are saying is God is measuring faithfulness now because when when the Lord comes in Matthew 25 and he's you have to give an account for what he's given to you and you don't give him in return he's giving you Revelation and you don't give him the manifestation back he's going to hold us accountable amen so to one he gave talents and the one gave him back he said Lord I've ascended all dimensions of the Holy Ghost yes and he said well done my good and faithful servant now remember why I'm saying that God measures faithfulness by what we have done with the promise so this man handled the promise well so God tells him well done my good and faithful servant so what we have done with what God has given us is how God will measure it back so if we give him that's anything in the gospel now remember we said God's kingdom works by multiplication God's kingdom works by addition yes amen so to inherit anything is not a right to inherit something is a privilege just because we're born into a household doesn't mean we have a right to The Inheritance it is the one the test is he called the testator the one that's given that owns it is it the testator the one that owns everything has a right who he wants to distribute his inheritance to so just because we bear the family name just because we're born in the house doesn't give us a right to The Inheritance hallelujah amen so we must realize that what's been given to us is a privilege hallelujah it's a privilege and something that somebody else toil for it somebody else labored for it price has been paid amen stripping with blood yes dripping with blood the Holy Ghost Gospel stripping with blood so there's a price that was paid yes amen the word that we have the Comfort we have of having the entire book open to us came with a price yes amen think of if you're reading there in Hebrews chapter 11 how they were slaughtered how they were slain how they wandered about in desert in sheep skin and in goat skin and how the gospel progressed yes amen then we come to the New Testament after this promise where the Holy Ghost is poured out that's the land that's being poured out to us now comes Satan with his R and he's trying to take away the word from the people and they gave up their lives yes and now the gospel amen slowly got diluted so I'm saying what we have is an inheritance when brother br came because his ministry was to release the title deed amen so what they toiled for what they labored for think of brother Bram how he struggled Amen in the early years going out into the field of evangelism the time time and season wasn't right yet so he's told do the work of an evangelist so he goes around with an healing Revival yes amen with the first and second pool with the bait Hallelujah trying to get them to come now so they can hear the word of God but at the third pool they all shut their doors he says when I'm preaching the seals he says I'll lose many of my friends yes so the sacrifice and all that he toiled and labored for Amen to get now leave his hometown leave his church and go there Into the Wilderness to receive the revelation of the Seven Seals amen it was a sacrifice it was a labor amen so if we are put on the will if we are put our names are put there it's a privilege amen hallelujah it's an honor yes because the one that is leaving me something they love me brother Bram had a love for the people of God Amen he toiled and he labored because he knew that God was using him to sew a seed so that there would be an Harvest now think of this great God who Who Loved Adam and he all that he created there in Genesis 1 he now gives him as an inheritance and when God gives an inheritance he's expecting multiplication amen didn't we just read that there in Genesis chapter 1 yes multiply yes amen God's first instruction to man is to multiply yes and amen he says multiply and replenish yes so inheritance is for multiplication yes and to be replenished yes Hallelujah so I'm asking again what are we doing with the promised word is it bringing forth multiplication when God is giving us something when God is putting something into our hands when we are are good stewards of the word when we are good stewards of finances God can multiply it yes but what we find is sometimes when it comes into our hand there's subtraction happening there's division happening because we are not operating under Kingdom law and principles we're operating under Satan's law which is subtraction and division yes hallelujah amen amen the Apostle is telling us that in stewards they must be accounted to be faithful stewards amen hallelujah amen so we find here that something was lost in the Garden of Eden we don't have time to go through the entire story it's a Wednesday night but you know that Adam was given eternal life yes Adam was given power over the Earth Adam had fellowship with God and he lost these three things he lost this inheritance the Holy Ghost left Adam yes in the Garden of Eden amen that was his rightful inheritance God in man right God in his people is a super amen amen so the Holy Ghost left Adam yes his inheritance praise the Lord and you know that there was a cherub put around the tree so that to guard the way back to the tree of life and and and brother Bram says that the tital deed now went back to the original owner that's the scene you're finding now that when the kinsman redeemer comes if if you go to Revelation 5 that's the scene you are seeing there the original owner is sitting with the inheritance to the Earth amen but this title deed don't belong in the heavens this title deed was given to man on the earth if you read Genesis 1: 28 and onwards we just read that you will see where the inheritance is given to man yes Hallelujah so that's what was lost eternal life fellowship with God and dominion over the Earth so these are the things we are regaining yes amen hallelujah amen this is what we are striving for when we are talking about John standing there in Revelation 10 8-1 and the angel is asking to take this title deed back what he's asking him to do is to take back his rightful claims to the Earth is to take back dominion over the Earth amen hallelujah is to regain your fellowship with God amen amen and to have eternal life amen praise the Lord so we we knew that there was a price to pay now this book is sitting there but there's a price and only a man from the earth yes the book was lost by a man yes and only a man's blood can redeem us back to our original inheritance so the prophet says that Propet after Prophet amen it looked like they could be the one but in the weakness Hallelujah it exposed their sinful nature so God couldn't God could only use them in a measure they were revealing Christ it was Christ in Moses Christ in Noah Christ in David Christ in Joseph I if you heard the prophet saying this in part in part in part they could only reveal him in part because of the human nature so God needed a perfect Son of God God needed a man with pure blood yes God could couldn't use ibr man to redeem it yes it re quied amen a sinless one a spotless one Hallelujah so God took amen God created the cell and he found a woman was amen able now to comply with the Angel's message she was prophesied in the Bible to come and near in Time season she's now on the earth ready to receive the promise from the angel Gabriel the holy H Spirit shall overshadow you amen I say even tonight the Holy Spirit shall overshadow you you shall bear a son amen and his name Shall be Called Jesus amen when Jesus is reproducing himself all his sons must bear his same name so if his name is Jesus and you are Mrs Jesus Christ if you are going to conceive and bring forth a son you are bringing forth another Jesus amen amen when the devil sees you he's confused yes amen at one time he was only facing one Jesus but now he's surrounded by an army of Jesus hallelujah amen amen he's pouring out his Spirit that's what we read there amen Jesus Christ came now on the earth you know John 3:16 is born on the Earth Hallelujah the sin spotless one and the voice comes at the Jordan there amen when he's older now and says this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased now because Satan Hur heard that he followed into the desert to see if he really believed what he heard at the Jordan yes to see if you really believe you as a Son of God this message came to give you your true identity so Satan follows you every day in your life to check whether you truly believe you are the Son of God yes amen whether you really believe that voice amen but this bride is not a denominational seed Hallelujah so she don't fall amen by Satan's schemes and she goes back to the word to say it is written it is written of me look at how many scriptures we read and it pertains to us it is written this is my inheritance it is written this is my promise it is written that I am here positioned on the earth now to take back my title deed so Satan has to flee amen praise the Lord amen amen so when Jesus he died and he he was buried we know he went to the fourth dimension and he took back the keys to death hell and the grave amen he defeated Satan because he was the one found worthy he's now sacrificing himself and his blood will now make an atonement for all of mankind but he's really after Adam's seed the names that were in the book am cuz Jesus said all that the father has given me will come to me and not one of them will be lost so he's after those names but his blood is enough to save the entire world yes sir amen his blood is enough powerful enough strong enough and brother brandom is saying that the blood of Jesus Christ is just as powerful today as if it was shed 10 minutes ago amen so the blood of Jesus still makes atonement for us hallelujah it still washes white as snow it's still cleanses amen amen oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow amen nothing but the blood of Jesus so when we lost this now Jesus Christ now ascends now this is where denomination stop at the Ascension of Jesus he goes to heaven they don't know where he is Somewhere in Heaven and the Holy Ghost being poured out and their version of the Holy Ghost being poured out is speaking in tongues that's where they stop they have put a full stop the Holy Ghost being poured out he speaking in tongues right they believe in Mark 16 but Mark 16 is before Acts chapter 2 so they believe in Mark 16 because they want physical manifestations amen hallelujah but remember what they are producing is an impersonation of Christianity am so they stop at Acts chapter 2 where they spoke in unknown tongues and they know nothing about Jesus go now the Redeemer now must go to the one who's got the book Revelation chapter 5 and there's only one class of people called to Revelation 5 yes the class that's found in Revelation 4 was called up higher which is John yes amen now everyone knows that in Revelation 4:1 he says I Heard a Voice as a trumpet talking to me saying come up higher right now brother Bram says that's the Rapture everyone agree now we know if that is the rapture brother Brandon is saying Rapture happens in shout voice and Trump so John is caught up where is he caught up in the shout is he caught up in The Voice or is he caught up in the Trump for John to receive that Revelation he's caught up in the shout hallelujah everyone agrees if that is the rapture is's caught up in the shout yes and it's in the shout that the seals are revealed so brother Braham says that this I don't have time to read it you can read it in the breach message he says when when Jesus Christ now ascends to Heaven is the is playing the intercessory role he's now the high priest who makes intercession for seven Church ages Hallelujah you know the high priest went to the temple yes so he's making intercession for seven Church ages and when John gets to Heaven it's about the time of the end of the seven Church ages but he not out of the sanctuary yet that's why they can't find Jesus yes only the high priest could enter the holiest of holies amen so when they look through all of Heaven they look on the earth they look beneath the Earth they can't find one worthy but we know Jesus was worthy but they could not find him because no one could go into the holiest of holies they had to wait for the priest to come back out again amen yes amen so when his time of intercession is over he's coming back out of the sanctuary and now that strong angel that cherub with a flaming sword the one that was guarding the way back to the tree of life he saying who is worthy to take the book and now John starts to weep because no one was worthy but then Jesus coming back out of the Sanctuary they said Johan don't weep because the lion has prevailed praise the Lord yes now they see a lion but right there he changes his mask amen and when John turns to look he sees the one with a chang mask amen amen and he says amen he saw the lamb he says I turned to look and I saw a lamb as though it had been slain amen bleeding bloody yes blood still making atonement amen hallelujah now the I'm giving you a very amen I'm trying to break it down very briefly for you Jesus comes back out and he takes the title deed back brother brandom says that title deed now he sealed with Seven Seals amen so now you need somebody to break those seals amen so he's tying his ministry in with this to show a son of man revealing the son of man that God needs a prophet on the earth amen so the seals in heaven the seals in Revelation is broken in symbol form but the seals now in Revelation must be broken on the earth so that now come 63 when seven angels come down you know this picture was taken amen hallelujah seven angels come meet the prophet and they tell him amen you go back and preach the seals so what he's doing is unlocking the seals to the title deed of our Redemption now so everything that Adam lost is now being regained to us amen hallelujah amen now what is it what is an abstract title deed amen if I can Define it brother Bram says that an abstract title deed takes it all the way to the beginning so along the way it might have had other owners the deed amen let's take a car if you buy a secondhand car maybe you're the fourth owner maybe right now you have an original document with your name on it but on the eat system they can trace it back all different owners praise the Lord but he says what the abstract title did does it strikes off all the previous owners and it takes it back to its original condition praise the Lord so at one time when the word was being restored the Lutheran had claimed to the abstract yes they had one work of Grace yes the wans had another abstract yes sanctification the Pentecostals had another abstract so they they had the abstract being passed to them yes Hallelujah everyone's trying to get the point amen so they can make claims on the word yes but at the opening of that seven seal amen when the seals are now released and revealed to the bride it strikes off all other claims yes they can't make any claims to any part of the promise of God because now Jesus Christ himself comes to marry himself to a bride and he gives them full legal Authority thank you Lord amen so he strikes off every other claim to him and he calls them blasphemous names yes amen he says they are Blasphemous names oh Hallelujah these people put their names on their churches but he calls them Blasphemous names amen he doesn't recognize them he only recognizes those that are able to receive the word praise the Lord so all that we are losing eternal life fellowship with God and power over the Earth we are gaining back what for feated we are gaining back amen so we also know that Satan is called the God of this evil age amen but he is not our God hallelujah he's the God of this evil age amen he's the God of this world but we are not of this world Amen he's the God of this evil age but we are not part of the evil age we are called out into the bright age Hallelujah so Satan is not our God Satan may have control of governments but there is a resistance on the earth hallah he may control the whole Earth but there is a resistance on the earth do you know who forms a resistance an army an army is is forming a resistance remember he is governing the entire Earth he is controlling the entire Earth but there is a group of people on the Earth who he has no control over yes there's a group of people on the Earth who have formed a resistance the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee Hallelujah this is one Army he can't conquer yes this is one Army the Bible says he deceived the nations of the Earth but this is one people he can't deceive can you imagine all that he labored for amen he's being brought to North By God's Army all that he's pursuing on the Earth all that he's working to achieve on the earth one Army is defying him hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Lord well amen if you don't believe it that's why you won't say Amen the reason you won't say Amen is because you know you are stumbling every day you're not having the victory Hallelujah people can't have the victory in their lives why they still sin in their life amen there's still unbelief in their life so you find amen they start to crack amen start had a little pressure brother Rand says somebody's TOS you'll see if they're dead yes amen because he says the spirit of Christ is not one like that so we can't hide fruit yes brother Brandon says you can hide seed but you can't hide fruit he says by your fruits they are known so what we Proclaim God is not interested in what we are proclaiming I'm a message believer I'm a message believer show me amen yes sir how do you show me by the life that I live my everyday life thank you Lord yes amen everyday life how do I live praise the Lord are we cracking under pressure the slightest thing are we cracking pressure at work pressure at home pressure at school amen hallelujah because what's going to come out amen is going to reveal what's on the inside side am if we are finding flaw there's something wrong we need to check our experience brother brandom says now I wish we had the quotes here he says we need to check our prayer life you remember he says now when that when that conductor is coming now to check if that cut is packed properly what he says everything must be packed down tight he says there can't be anything loose there he says then he sees if we little loose about our prayer life if we loose about our Bible reading we little loose about our temper little loose about our patience little loose am he says then you can't seal the cart amen praise the Lord now watch what he said there loose about prayer life people think that's nothing loose about your Bible reading he says loose about your temper Ah that's nothing no God says it's something but the brand says he won't seal the cup praise the Lord now Satan has access to certain Realms of you because the flesh is not redeemed I don't if you think your flesh is redeemed this flesh is our bread yes Hallelujah that's why God is coming if you ever wondered why a body changed God has to change this body this was not our intended way to come so God has to change this body to fully redeem it that's why he says our full maturity is when we receive the body change thank you the full maturity yes amen because we need a new body if we are to operate like Adam we need a new body if we are to pass through walls you can't pass through walls with this body praise the Lord so Satan don't control this church Satan don't control Sons and Daughters of God Amen Hallelujah he may be the God of this world but I say even now even if you don't believe it even if you can't say amen I say you say an amen to itj he don't control this Army he don't control this child of God hallelujah and sometimes we can't be accommodating to the devil the prophet is saying if we receive an inheritance and we go there and we find people there occupying this house occupying our inheritance I say maybe there's occupant amongst your inheritance this night yes demon Power is coming to oppress you and you don't even know it amen demon power is whispering in your ears but you can't take every thought captive Under The Obedience of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen amen he's The God Who has blinded the eyes of the world but he can't blind our eyes yes what are we what am I trying to tell you we are making Satan powerless that's right amen when see you he don't know what to do with you he don't know how to handle you I'm say it again when say I'm I'm I'm speaking to you and you ought to be conditioned when Satan sees you he don't know what to do with you the Bible says just one of us can put a thousand to flight two of us can send a legion flee hallelujah amen praise the Lord so he's the God of this Earth but he's not our God amen hallelujah our god is God Of Heaven and Earth Hallelujah he's just allowing them to run their cause for now because he's unfolding his Redemption plan praise the Lord so what we have got to do now if we find these people that have invaded Our Lives lies treachery amen unbelief cracks in our faith we've got to stand up and fight for what is ours am thank you Lord the Bible says we ought to be of he says the meek shall inherit the earth so we we don't fight he says can you imagine people struggling on the earth to buy a loaf of bread he says yet they own the entire thing Hallelujah he says they're struggling to pay their rent he says yet they own the entire thing he says Abraham was told he owns the entire thing but now he's struggling with cattl men he's struggling with lot he's struggling they're stealing his water they're fighting over water he says though he owns the whole thing yes yet it's a daily struggle he's living in a tent but he's heading towards the promise amen hallelujah so we've got to fight for our god-given rights amen we can't be pushed around by the devil yes amen demon powers coming to oppress us pushing us around pushing the sickness on us pushing this disease on us pushing this problem on us pushing this unbelief on us and we just accept it sometimes we don't even know but we are tools for the enemy why no discernment no spirit of discernment amongst us amen do you know that the Bible says that if you have done wrong against your brother he says you have to leave your gift make right with your brother and then present your gift amen but who does that that's why we talk about picking and choosing we pick and choose what we want so he's coming to push these things on us demon powers pushing amen we we we've got to now push back yes we've got to come to a point where enough is enough I will die to myself I will die to Pride do you know how hard that is that's why Jesus coming there now they think he's he's one coming now to rule on the earth and he's telling them turn the other cheek what we say today they will learn about the name amen where is turned the other cheek where is a man that I'd rather take the wrong I'd rather take the wrong to win my brother but we fight over doctrines divide don't even talk to one another over doctrines doctrines are probably don't even pertain to salvation but we fight you know the Bible talks about being angry Without a Cause praise the Lord so what he wants to do is negotiate Satan wants to negotiate regarding your inheritance I say that the the the the theme of the army of God this invincible Army is that there will be no negotiations yes we don't have hostage negotiators here Abraham was not willing to negotiate regarding his inheritance which was a lot Amen brother Bram says when everything was given to Abraham it included his property it included his relatives it included his cattle it included everything about his life come on I want you to get this everything about your life is included in your inheritance so when Satan is coming against any of those things you have the legal right to pursue and overtake it to regain it so what about your health it's a part of you it's a part of your inhabitance your lungs belong to you your heart Belong To You amen amen every fiber of your body Belongs to You Satan this is my inheritance you can't touch me am thank you Lord the thing is we are too accommodating for the devil because we're relying on science we are relying on Medical Aid instead of Miracle Aid we are relying on the things of this Earth instead of fixing our eyes Heavenly say I refuse to receive this sir amen hallelujah amen so when he's coming brother BR is saying he wants to negotiate you with you and tell you I'll tell you what we're going to do he says we ought to say you ain't going to do nothing am that's the way to talk back to him I know my position in Christ and you just might as well get away I ain't listening to you no more I got an inheritance sometimes the last thing we ever think about is the word of God when we have faced problem after problem challenge after challenge the word of God is the last thing on our mind because we are going into our flesh to think how we are going to solve something yes even if you don't have the scripture yet tell Satan I've got an inheritance in the word hallelujah let him know where your basis point is let him know where you standing on you are standing on the word you might find the scripture later but put him on notice right away Satan I have an inheritance I am not like any other age I am not like any other woman of the church I have the entire word open to me amen so in there I'm am going to find a weapon yes and I'm coming back to you I'm putting your notice now I have an in I've got the promised word I'm going into the word to find something that's going to blow you away but that's if we believe that the answer is in the word yes sir so when the Lord calls us now is's got to give us the abstract title deed so it's taking away every other claim praise the Lord and sometimes people are scared to use their rights what if it don't work no what ifs yes amen no what if when that man who son was uh falling into the fire and those disciples couldn't cast The Demon out he told Jesus if you are able if you are able Jesus said what do you mean if if you believe amen thank you Lord that's where Mark 9:23 comes in there he's trying to put if on Jesus Jesus says don't put a if on me I know my capabilities so he puts it back on him he says if you believe all things are possible to them that believe don't come to Jesus Oh only if if you will only do this no don't put it on Jesus as a if he is saying if you believe all things are possible amen so what we need to say God help us get our faith right because we can't be loing moving in low dimensions of Faith how long we going to walk around oh we have little faith yes we need to raise the standard of our faith we need to raise the level of our faith we also need to raise the level of our expectation you know if we don't expect anything good in this life we will receive nothing good in this life yes brother brand says you re you have not because you asked not am and he says we ask God with limitations praise the Lord yes so he says we got to get our faith in the right place in the right channel let's have high Ambitions to have high levels of faith not oh we have little faith but let's have high Ambitions to say that when Jesus looks at us and he's seeing our faith he says I have never seen such great faith thank you Lord so we if we can get our faith up to a place amen then Satan is powerless Satan is a liar all things are under our feet amen hallelujah so he says if we have illegal occupants illegal Spirits influencing us illegal Spirits coming he says we've got a right to go there and tell them give them marching orders and he says he he says it in a very nice way if they don't want to move praise the Lord he says here God's abstract Deed by his stripes we were healed and if you don't want to believe that there's a holy ghost here the law of God that'll kick him out that'll prove it just ring Jesus Central Jus find out if something doesn't take place the angels of God will take their positions and that devil will get out he goes on to say we got an attorney sitting in glory with the blood sacrifice of his own life not only that but we got an FBI

it he says the title deed of man's Redemption this seven seal book it is the title deed you wait till we get to those seals he breaks those seals reveals it he gives his inheritance to his people amen he remember what we said now an inheritance is given yes it's a privilege he gives that inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it to himself he gives it back to the people that's his love for us amen am amen hallelujah praise the Lord so the point of me telling you all of this is to tell you that the one standing there in Revelation chapter 10 with the abstract title de we've got to know what that is we've got to know what we have back in our hands how it was taken away and how we are the ones positionally placed here on the earth now to receive all that Adam lost amen we've got to know what's in the book we've got to know our inheritance we've got to know our promise

work like that God's kingdom works by multiplication amen now if you give God zero do you know that God is blessing you every day he's multiplying your zero to you is pouring out in multiplication is blessing back to you amen but the problem is we gave zero 0 * 0 is what so God is pouring out we think we're giving him our best we're giving him zero because we haven't come according to his terms and conditions yes we're giving zero and he's pouring it back out in multiplication multiplication give and it will come back to you good measure press down Shakeen to together Lord why aren't you
