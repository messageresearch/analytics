Main Park in Sri Park Phoenix and the time is 400 p.m. that's the combin the monthly combined meetings so tonight uh available to be there and support the services amen also at this time it's like to say happy and blessed birthday to Josephine is God is 15 years ago God has blessed us with his bundle of joy in our home and we thank God for I know when Joshua was born it was like justification when Caleb was born it was like sanctification when Josephine was born it was like the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because when Joshua was born I just had an experience I wanted to know this God I had a contact with this God that we heard about in the Bible and I wanted us to find this God but we were still stuck in the denomination amen and I started to get get the me all of the message and as Caleb was born we already come in the message and then we got baptized and We Know by the time Josephine was born we said now we are ready to cross over jordanah amen so we thank God for the blessings that he's given us amen amen if you love the Lord and you're thankful to God for the things that he's doing and the way world is progressing amen now these things can't come from man because as men we have our own thoughts and our own ideas but it's limited but when we receive from the inexhaustible Fountain of Life his mercies are renewed every day amen and we find that his word comes fresh to was fresh manner every day amen and we thank God for the 54 Ministry and we appreciate the five4 ministry because without the five4 ministry we won't have we won't be receiving because they have the source of communication amen we believe that the angel of God is here and he's speak which is the Holy Ghost and he's using the 54 Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints amen and the five4 ministry has to to bring edification to bring the church into Perfection amen amen and to bring you into the knowledge of Christ and so we appreciate that we appreciate the things that God is doing if if we just say we want to sit at home and we've got the message we'll read our Bibles but we not we don't have not everybody has that gift God has given these gifts in the church for a reason you can be reading your Bible and reading the scripture over and over but there's things there that you will not see because you haven't received that communication but God has anointed men in his hour I mean if God wanted he could have came and spoken directly to somebody but God uses men and that is law amen and God can't change that law now God anoints men and he drops his word down in that man and that man can't speak anything but but the word that God is putting his mouth amen and then when you are connected with that then there must be a change taking place in you you see because if we look at at the veil at the gifts God given us and we look at it carnally then we only enjoy the blessings of God but we got to look at it we got to be sensitized yes to the Unseen World we got to look Beyond the Veil and see what God is using using in the hour when he's using it amen and when we look Beyond the Veil and recognize God is speaking to us and then you can receive of God and then that can transform and change your lives and that can word can do something for you amen remember like Elijah and Elijah said Lord open the boy's eyes because he was looking through the five senses because we all are Tre here in the three dimensional World which is light matter and time but we've got to come to the six s which is through faith we got to look at the Unseen amen amen amen so you've got your Bibles today let's let's open to the book of 2 Kings chapter 1 the book of 2 Kings chapter 1 so we are glad to be found in the presence of God and we can if you look around the world what God is doing amongst the bride it's a glorious time amen and we can see the events around the world what's happening because we know between the second W and the third W something is taking place amen God is dealing with his Gentile bride and also at the closing of the time of him dealing with the Gentile dispensation there must be a Passover a crossover to deal with the Jews amen but this is where we are now amen in our part of the prophecy 2 Kings chapter 1 let's read from second king chapter 1 [Music] okay 2 Kings chapter 2 reading for verses 1 to 11 2 Kings chapter 2 and it came to pass when the the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal you see it came to pass that the Lord would take up Elijah now Elijah decides to go to heaven the Lord would take him up amen and Elijah said unto Elisha terer I pray thee for the Lord had sent me to ble so see God is sending him to this to a location amen and elishah said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to ble and the sons of the Prophet where at ble came forth to elishah and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yeah I know it hold ye your peace and Elijah said unto him said unto him Elisha tell I praise thee for the Lord had sent me to Jericho so the Lord had took him to a certain position and now he's done his the whatever he had to do there now he's taking him to another position he's moving his position now to Jericho and and he said as the Lord liveth and as I so liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho and the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elijah and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he answered yeah I know it all e your peace and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee year for the Lord had sent me to Jordan and and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they went on and 50 men of the sons of the Prophet went and stood to view a far off and they too stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoke the waters and they were divided either and tither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee now remember this Supernatural things that are taking place here you're getting the the Jordan being open they're walking on dry ground and so forth but these things are happening in this Dimension but soon you're going to see another dimension is going to open up amen and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and elishah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has as the heart thing never the L if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be unto thee it shall be so unto thee thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold they appeared a chariot of fire and ERS of fire see so now remember as I said there were Jordan was parted happing the dimension but now another dimension is opened up amen and now now they're seeing this now that they appeared a charot of Fire coming from another dimension to this Dimension amen and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven amen so this Dimension is open up now that Elisha even can see this amen that he's watching Elijah going up into a whirlwind amen so now when we thinking about growing up we're not talking about has we were learned when we were little little children that heaven is somewhere up in the sky we're talking about another dimension the prophet of God taught us that this is a another parallel Dimension amen amen you may be seated open also to the Book of Genesis 5 reading from verse 21 to 24 and Enoch lived 65 years and begat metella and Enoch walked with God after he begat metella 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all of the days of Enoch with 36 and5 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so we find that Enoch had to walk with God before God takes him amen the Bible not say speak about anything about Enoch dying or Enoch being buried doesn't tell you when he doesn't tell you which year all it says that Enoch walked with God and God took him he doesn't say what year it was or how many years he just says and Enoch walked with God so there was a time where Enoch had to have a speci specific walk he's not talking about a natural walk he not walking down the highway and he's walking with God he's talking about a specific walk in other words there to come a time where Enoch walk changed because Enoch was receiving communication From Another Dimension amen he was receiving communication of how he had to build this pyramid amen and how it had to be structured in the center of the earth he had to receive communication from from extraterrestrial beings from the supernatural amen amen and that is why even now scientist cannot fathom and cannot understand how this pyramid was built they cannot understand it with signs there was times when they thought it was a tomb but now they real they thought it was a tomb of one of the Pharaohs but now they realize that this place is empty because why it was made in such a way where Enoch had to climb up that seven step amen amen and Enoch was taken up amen yes amen he was translated from there he had to be changed from Mortal to immortality Hallelujah and therefore you couldn't find Enoch's body anyway so we speaking this morning on moving into position for translation and for the subtitle the bride walking in armony with the bridegroom amen we need to move in into position for translation amen we are put here on the earth for a purpose we are put to live out in this season to make a Rapture amen and this Rapture is a secret catching away if the good man of the house know what hour the thief cometh amen yes that scripture is for us it's not for the Rapture is a secret it's not for everybody amen that is why no one else can preach this Rapture message because they haven't received the message amen that come in this hour the message that come to give us the rapturing faith this message was designed to give you rapturing Faith this message was designed to change the Mortal to immort Immortal and this couldn't be done under the church ages we we crossed over from the seven Church age the lean Church into the bright age amen We've Come to an eternal age we can't be stuck this message couldn't be given to you in the church age if this was given to you in the church age you wouldn't receive the new birth because there wasn't atmosphere for the new birth in the lyan age but you had to come in the bright age and receive this new birth hallah hallelujah amen the atmosphere wasn't right there amen you had to come under the right atmosphere there had to be a cleaning up that's why you find the first group of ministers that received this message and you do a cleaning up because why when we came out of Egypt all the Deeds of Egypt all the ideas of Egypt which was let us here now all the things that will be taken away from us and that's why we have to come under the church order and Doctrine you see that is why Israel was different from Every Other Nation Israel wasn't a lawless Nation God given them a law God positioned them in tribes in drank and in file because God worked in order with Israel and he's given them the different laws and so forth that is why they became a peculiar nation and that is why out of the church age he comes now and he restores all things and he brings Church order and Doctrine that's why we don't come aitly into the house of God God's got a government amen he's got an Administration and he got things in order that is why you go to a denomination chur you find people talking people walking up and down people dressed up anyhow and they got no respect for the things of God because why this Bride is a peculiar people and he's got in rank and file amen he's got different Ministries he's got H in his church amen so we thought we were just in this world and we were just here but we didn't realize we might have been in our denominations we might be in the world system but within us we was designed in such a way that the gene of God was in US amen that God was going to give us a communication at a certain time and season in our life amen and how he was communicating with us when this word came our way amen it began now to trigger that signal you know it's like you know you get the special forces in the military if they have to go do a military operation in a certain country right they'll be dropped off at a certain place but for the extraction after the mission in order for them to be extracted from that country because they went there under a covert operation they went they undetected they did a mission they did a operation and at the end of the mission there's a certain points that they have to go to be extracted and they have to make that point their extraction can only take place at that point and they have to fight their way sometime they're going to go they remember they are Behind Enemy lines and the ground the the fights are the the the terrain is treacherous treacherous difficult to rain but they have to make their way to the extraction point if they don't meet the extraction point there won't be a pickup for them they can't be taken away back to their Homeland amen and we were put on the earth yeah Amen in the mid of Satan's Eden amen taking 6,000 years to Bull his Eden and he thought he got them he got the church ages he thought he he got them when he got him a ni Rome but God had a group of people there and then God put where they said that J shall live by faith then he sealed up a bunch of people then he had wle with sanctification then he had the Pentecostal age and then he thought he got the people naked and blind and miserable in his latest seean age when the Holy Ghost comes down when the word comes down and Christ was put out of the church but there was a bunch of people amen that was put here in the midst of Satan Eden covertly amen God has stor up for the season that we've got a mission on this Earth amen and our mission is to manifest Christ Our mission is to be one with him our mission is to be so much like him that we manifest his life upon the Earth our mission is to become Amen to take the title de book and to recognize that our inheritance has come back Amen to come as Sons and Daughters of God upon the Earth our mission is to come back to the God man amen to be amate Gods upon the Earth our mission is to have dominion over the Earth over sickness over every disease over every circumstance over every every onslaught of the enemy our mission is to express God on the earth amen but when our mission is over they must must come a point where we come to the extraction Point amen and how do we come with the extraction point we are now walking with God when we come and walk in harmony amen like how Jesus walked in harmony with the Father the bride must walk in harmony with him amen hallelujah amen the bride and the bridegroom must be in harmony amen when we in harmony we walk now like Enoch walked amen we walking into translation in this hour amen we are moving into translation we are moving to position and how do we move into position it's the holy ghost that positionally places us and now is the Holy Ghost positionally placing us through the preaching of the word amen he's placing us in our land of inheritance amen he's placing us into what we supposed to be in this hour amen there must be a Harmony between the bride and the bridegroom father May they be one even as we are one and this is that hour amen so you see we could never run away from God he designed Us in such a way he could in such a way that he had this Gene within us anytime any way he can contact us amen you can find yourself maybe going in the world going in a back condition but there'll come a time you can be in a bar you can be in the bar room you can be in the dance hall you can be amongst the world you can be alone in your bathroom but when he wants to contact you he will contact you because he not contacting the body he's contacting the soul amen God is not interested in the Heartwood God is interested in that part of him inside the Gene and he wants to conduct the gene amen and then you and and you didn't realize that you had this contact in you because you thought you just yeah living in this world but he sent the seven Thunders to come and awaken you to come and give you a true identity to come give you the revelation of who you originally were that you always wear a part of him that you come from eternity that you are Eternal being trapped in a temporary time zone amen why you didn't just know that when you were born because you're coming man the first birth you bypassed your theophany you bypass your word body amen amen and then you come under the old ademic nature but you are always where a part of him you come from eternity amen you know God cannot be complete without you God is only complete with you amen because you are the feminist part of God Amen that is why he's the head you are the body the body is the feminist part of God the bride is the feminist part of Christ which is part of his charact which is part of his attributes yes amen and that's why none of you can be lost when you get the revelation of that and you're connected with that then you realize that you can't be lost because he can't be complete without you amen but what happens is Satan tries to disconnect us from these Revelations and now he disconnected us when we don't stay with the word when we don't stay with the word we're not receiving the word in this hour and we are disconnected amen because God connects you through his word and his word must be a word of Revelation because revelation comes fresh and it stimulates you amen that is why in this hour we have received a good reports just like Joshua and Caleb when he went into the land they brought for the grapes and evidence what is that discipling the stimulation of Revelation oh we received a good report the evidence that this land is full of Revelation am amen so we from the time we come we've always been receiving this word amen we've receiving connection with God there was a we thought we can go anyhow but the guide is there to guide us the guide is there to show us the way that this is how you need to walk in the hour of translation this is how you need to be positioned for the translation and the guide that to move us into position amen and how is the holy ghost moving us into position through the preaching of the word amen is moving us into position for translation because there's nothing left for us on the Earth right now that is why we are in between the translation period and the time of manifesting as Sons and Daughters of God so this is the hour where Sons and Daughters of God are being manifested on the earth this is is the hour right now where we are to have dominion on the earth because after this hour is the resurrection and the translation am because first there must be a resurrection and then there will be a translation amen so before the resurrection takes place we are living in the hour where it must be in harmony between the bride and the bride Grom there must be a bride that will carry out the Mandate of a husband am amen we must carry out his mandate he said Greater Works than these they shall do the word must see the impact of the Gospel amen the the world must see these people have been with Jesus the people must say Jesus is with this people they must see say this the Jesus of the Bible the things that we heard of the Bible we can see it now being manifested among these people they might not understand understand the things you are saying they might not believe the things you are saying but they must be able to see the life amen that this gospel is producing a different life that you are not living like the people of the world Amen we are live we are being influenced From Another Dimension we are being influenced from another kingdom we are receiving communication for translation in this hour from another kingdom and that is why when the people are fting when the people are in depression you recognize those are demon spirits and you recognize when the people are in the world and the people are being influenced by sin you recognize his enticing Spirits their Spirit of Oppression the spirit of depression that is why people just speak negative things and people will just be sad but you have a hope you are working in perfection in this hour amen you are walking with a peace oh that surpasses all understanding because you know the the end results you know that you come from another world you know that you're going away from this misery from this world that is decaying and you're going to come back to a renovated Earth amen this is the hour you want to come to the stature of a perfect man and then only coming because the five4 mon is preaching to you not preaching any other word the word that's coming this day amen amen the word that come now to make you perfect to what to be in the image and likeness of God Amen that your brother and sister out there will come and say my dear brother God is with you I know that God be with you I have need of this and you're going to say my brother the things you have need of you have I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen they going to recognize God is with you they going to recognize your communication because why when you are a spiritual person your communication is not like everybody else when you are I tell you it's it's easy to see a person that's full of the Holy Ghost and not the one that's not full of the Holy Ghost is negative about everything in life a person that's not full of the Holy Ghost is fearful a person that's not full of the Holy Ghost and doesn't have confidence in himself they they lack self-confidence they always feel that that they inferior but when you have the Holy Ghost you have confidence because you know who you are you know what the word says about you you know that you are a super Church you know that you are a super race you know that you are an invincible Army you know in the hour when hell is Unleashed upon the Earth Heaven has come down to unite with you amen you know that you are seated in Heavenly places amen that is why you don't talk L language you talk Heavenly language amen and this is hour where you have discernment amen you are able to discern the spirits around you you can't be walking in into position for translation and not discern the spirits L because the biggest demon the biggest demons are where not in the person that's oppressed like when Jesus was casting out that Legion from that man and it went into the pigs not that Spirits the biggest Spirit are your religious Spirits the biggest demons are the religious demons that's the hardest demon to deal with didn't the prophet of God say that when he's speaking demonology the arest demons to deal with are those religious Spirits that's keeping people from the true word of God that's keeping the people from the TR in the hour yes keeping people denominated around a certain Doctrine that's right that don't want them to walk with the guide in the hour because the guide is getting you ready for translation the guide is getting you ready to leave the Earth well they want to be Earthbound they want to build the kingdoms on the earth on temporal things you know when the prophet's Ministry was different from other Ministries at the time yes you you know when when all Roberts was preaching and the prophet was preaching he said I didn't I don't have the faith like AO Roberts it doesn't mean he got little Fai what he meant was UT Robert you tell the people touch the television or touch the radio and receive your healing the prophet of God w't do that because he W take signs to mix with god with is Supernatural amen he based his faith on the word of godah amen he own you signs amen and mixes mix the mix Faith with signs he takes faith and mix it with the word amen so we find this bride as well her faith is mixed with the word of God and nothing else you won't compromise with the word of God Amen even if there comes a time where she have to give up everything she won't compromise with this word she would lose everything else but stay with his word so you find that you walking around this hour with discernment recognizing their Spirits when you're talking to human beings you recognize that you are different from all the other human beings you're not the same like them amen you can't be the same like them because why your your life is different to them you come with two Natures in one body amen the rest of the people didn't come like that you come with a gene of God that you can be quickened when the Holy Ghost was revealed is released Amen on the day when the Holy Ghost was released to you you had the gene of God they don't have that that is why you find that only those that die sleep in the faith in their faith they receive the message of the hour they go to a young body on the other side they only have a theop body the other people go as Souls under the altar if they were saved but without the Holy Ghost only those and they own be in the same young body they will go to whatever they was in because right now on the other side only those with the theop is in the sixth dimension only those that died believing this message amen those that died in the faith the rest of the Saints rest of the Dead raised up after a thousand years so down the altar amen but on the resurrection it's only that die those that died in the faith amen will come up in the resurrection with young bodies again because why they had a theop there their theop will come pick up this Earthly body become a glorified body and that's the hour We're living right now so when people don't have are not connected with his word is because they don't have contact up there yes you have to have a contact from that Dimension amen something that you bypassed amen you have to hear from your from another source you have to have a connection amen so we find in the people are so disconnected because Satan is bringing things that will disconnect you yes amen it's like when you got good uh internet a good Wi-Fi and then suddenly something disrupts the connection it affects everything yes yes so Satan wants to disrupt the connection yes that God is given his hour amen and how does he do that he brings doubt he bring the cares of his life you know when when when Pharaoh wanted to keep the children of Israel from worshiping God what did he do he made the task Masters give them more work amen he made it harder for them to make those the the the clay and the the he took away the straw from them amen and he made life difficult for them that they'll toil all day they'll toil till they go home and just enough to sleep yes they don't have time to do anything they don't have time to even think about God but what he didn't realize that that will make them to cry out to God and when they began to cry to God the Bible says God remembered the Covenants that's what happen when a child of God cries out to him you w forget who he promised to you amen and we have an unconditional covenants so we find that Satan is trying to keep the people busy he tring to keep you busy with the cares of life he tring to keep you busy with all Earthly things with temporal things that you don't have time to worship God you don't have time for the things of God not that you don't want to have the time but you got to recognize that and is Unleashed on the earth and the devil has advanced the devil is not going to come like how he come those many years ago and just possess the people possess the people no now he coming interception he's going to make you come and be influenced by the things around you he going to make you be influenced with the Ral strength he's going to make you be influenced With the Jones it's going to make you be influenced in your workplace to achieve for better a better career a better position and when you take higher position there's more responsibility and when there's more responsibility taking up more of your time and when more of your time is taken up then you have lesser time for God you have lesser time for the things of God but remember this is not living 10 years ago or 20 years ago this is the hour where you are moving to position position for translation this is the hour where it's at your doorstep right now amen this is the hour where this must be such an Harmony between the bride and the bridegroom and this is the hour where the 54 is crying out to keep you connected amen amen because the devil wants to keep you disconnected but the Holy Ghost wants to keep you connected amen so we want to stay connected amen we can see the darkness on the land amen we can see sin being glorified yes amen the things of God are not exalted anymore sin is being glorified yes you'll find that in the the best most prestigious universe verities around the world such as harvest Harvard and so forth sin is being glorified that's right in the most prestigious universities yes amen and there's a say there's a saying that going in universities that you don't have to understand certain things but you just need to have solidarity with certain things without even understanding that's ignorance so you can just be ignorant and just have solidarity with something that's wrong would that something that's against God with something that's ungodly with something that's going against everything that God is showing in the word we are not of the world we are in this world but not of this world we got to be in harmony with the bridegroom We Are From Another World our intelligence is from another world we don't take the intelligence of this civilization because this civilization is being influenced with demon powers this is Satan's evil age and he works through the education system that is why we never knew that we were small we just thought that to get a good job you must work you must study and you get a good job all of us teaching you to be a slave they wanted you to be a slave because they're teaching you to get a better education for a better career and you become a professional when you become a professional you're actually a slave because all you're going to do is work work work that why the Jew the Jews were thought different the Jews said no we must have our own businesses we take a bus we can't work for and be a slave all we work for a certain time but then we become our own Master their mentality was different because they were taught differently and that's why they became so successful around the world but we were taught to be Slaves by our education system which is orchestrated by Satan amen and you find that the most intelligent people on the Earth or so-called intelligent people are the most ignorant people on the Earth amen because they can't understand simple things I me you're getting the most intelligent mind who can't believe there's a God who believes that you Evol from an ape and you call him the most intelligent mind that's how they think so you see without the Holy Ghost you're not on a gravitational level you cannot walk in hour of translation without the guide without having the Holy Ghost in This Hour because without the Holy Ghost you know I mean I'm sure many of you remember the days when you didn't have the Holy Ghost I remember the days when I wasn't born again I never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost the most miserable times of your life because without the Holy Ghost your life is terrible you you have fear you have anxiety you have depression you have doubt but with the Holy Ghost your life is so peaceful you're not stress you do not walk in fear amen you walk in confidence because the Holy Ghost keeps you on a gravitation level so do you realize that in this hour outside of the message of the hour that people have come no one else has the Holy Ghost the only other people that will receive the Holy Ghost is when you leave the Earth the gospel goes to the Jews it's the 144,000 Jews that will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost nobody else will receive the Holy Ghost and right now you're the only bunch of people on the Earth that's working with the Holy Ghost amen there was a time the Bible said the GI for on the just and the unjust amen the workings of the of the Holy Ghost was among the Pentecostals but now the sh the life has completely left it because it must come back to the grain amen there's no life there anymore and they substituted it now for what for entertainment just to keep the people in by entertainment amen because why like Elijah when is walking to battle he saw the sons of the Prophet all those small prophets after the great prophet and what happened they all had their own interpretation yes there were a lot of them there in ble but Elijah was typing us at that time the translate those are going to be translated because remember there's going to be us there going to be some of us who won't see death in the hour there's going to be a group of people that will not see de amen there will be a group of people who's ready now amen who's moving to position for translation in this hour they are going to change Dimensions amen amen and those that slept we shall not prevent them which to sleep because they're going to come here amen the sixth Dimension must empty them out because we're not going to have to dimensional CH without them amen we're going to go as one body amen amen we're going to go into the change Dimensions amen I'm telling you something brothers and sisters do not wait to start receiving faith when you see the resurrection taking place faith is coming now to the preaching of the word you are receiving communication From Another Dimension through the words amen and you're not going to be receiving it staying on your own staying at home you're going to receive it through the 54 Ministry you're going to receive it to the in the present hour with the gift that God has given to the church amen that's how you're receiving communication to give you faith for the change in this hour Hallelujah and that is why when you find when they coming when the resurrection takes place it is typed in the Bible in Jesus time when you come and say Jesus went and appeared disappeared and many and they went the the Believers that rose from the dead after the resurrection they went to Jerusalem to the Believers and what is Jerusalem type tying us amen we are typing Jerusalem the city amen the bride of Christ they won't appear to the other relatives who are not in the word they will not appear to the relatives who are not in the message who are not baptized with the Holy Ghost they only appear to the bride so the resurrection is for when the resurrection takes place those Believers that are gone beyond the cut of of time when the sixth Dimension empty is out they will come and appear only to Believers and when Believers are telling other people they're not going to believe you you not you won't have time to tell other people that's a very serious hour because you are going to glorification in that hour you are no time for mixing up with other social Affairs at that time it's a very serious hour and God works in order amen so when they come in here we are getting ready to go with them we got our social life is over on the earth at that time we're not interested in those things because when we are living the Earth gospel must go back to the Jews Moses and Elijah must come down Satan must come incarnated into the pope you see the hour we're living in that's why we find it even in the Old Testament when they Rose the Bible says they appeared to many in the city in Jerusalem yes Jerusalem is typing the brides amen they never go to people out out of Jerusalem they never go to people out of the city that is why there has to be a meeting point and where we are meeting in the homeland of the Holy Ghost we come in the in the message of the hour we we are meeting in the word amen amen because we all attracted to this one word which is the bridegroom hallelujah amen and there must be such a sweet harmony between the bride and the bridegroom amen she doesn't argue with his words she doesn't fight with the word what did Israel do when they were taken out of Egypt they wasn't they were a few miles away to go into the Homeland but by the grumbling by the moanings by the groaning it took them 40 Years Around The Wilderness and there's been a time where there was a groanings and grumblings and doctrinal disputes but now is a time not to have church politics or message politics now is the time to come into harmony now is the time to come into Oneness with him now is the time to recognize your position and your Authority now is the time to recognize the title deed has come down amen that everything that Adam lost you gain amen yes you come by the first births just like Adam you your first birth was under the first Adam the nature the laws of sin and everything is there but in Jesus Christ come amen and made a way for you through the new births you are delivered from every sin of the first Birth by the new birth your old birth is crept away you just crept in his body but your nature Has Changed by the new birth you are a new species you are a new civilization you're not influenced anymore by scientific civilization you are inuenced by fi civilization hallelujah amen you are a new birth amen and your new birth done away with the own nature if be done away with all nature all the sin all the attributes that brings the curse you are done that's done away with amen that is why every Redemptive blessing Belongs to You amen you know science is trying to now modify the gene for example if you have a family of diabetes they can modify the gene so they don't affect you you have a family with erit line of uh maybe art problems and they can modify the genes they don't affect you trying to scien is trying to do that but yours is already been modified by having the new birs that genetic lines can't affect you what your ancestors did can't affect you those curses are not upon you yes you all came under the curse because of what happened in the E because of your mother Eve in the Garden of Eden but under the new birth under Jesus Christ The Curse is gone amen oh praise the Lord this is the Lamb's wife that is walking this hour nothing can move her amen nothing can take off call that's why he cried out he said stay in line stay in line amen she has to stay in line with the word she has to be connected to the guide because the guide is guiding her through that is why the children of Israel when were leaving they had to have the guide although Moses was there taking wasn't Moses said I will send my angel before you amen they had to have the guide to take them because they was going into place where they never been before those were going on a journey they wasn't going before and that is why the guide is leading us to this journey that we haven't been before amen that is why the the word is being opened up to us now in his hour it's not us that's bringing his word it's the guy that's bringing his words amen so you find that we not coming here to church just for religion we not coming here because we want to satisfy our conscience we not coming here like every other person that's gathering on a Sunday in every other different religious places amen we coming here because we know we receiving communication from another world Amen we receiving communication that you are a supernatural being that you're not like every other human being you come from God and you go back to God we receiving communication that we are Eternal beings you are receiving communication that you are a god species amen and now we have to walk in such a close Union that's what the GU is doing is moving Us in the position that we're walking in such a close Union amen if if the only world that exists to us is our friends out there is our family is our work is how much we can achieve if that's the world that exist to us then there's something wrong with our walk in this hour and that's not the walk that's moving into translation in his hour amen if that's the world that exists to you that only what I'm how much money I'm going to make tomorrow how I'm going to meet my friend tomorrow I'm going to tell him the latest stories I'm going to tell what happened over the weekend if that's the only world that exists to you then there's something wrong about your walk in this hour that is not the Enoch walk that's not the walk that will move you in Translation because there must be another world that exists to you that while you are seated here you can see the other worlds amen I'm not talking about clothing your eyes and imagining and have an imaginary heaven now Heaven is not like that it's just another Di mention amen it's a real place it's in a real existence amen but it must exist from within you amen but there must be a transformation first of this Earth this Earth amen this Earth must be transformed this Earth must be changed am into an Heavenly place that it pushes out this PID City from within you amen each one one of us must push out the pyramid from within us amen we must come to the stature of a perfect man so you find Elijah when he's walking now he knows that he must be taken up and God is Mo speaking to him communicating with him telling him what position he must be then from there he receives more communication you need to leave here and move to another position then from that position he receives more information you need to move to another position that's what we're doing right now week after week as the word is preached to us you are in this position right you have now moved you have now sorted that part of your life out let's move to another position let's come up a bit higher now amen let's come up into the heavenlies amen let's move from Glory unto Glory let's move into the let's leave the Earthly things behind let's move now into the Heavenly things amen let's move where the eagle saw higher than the other birds around you amen am and as you moving into position you find that your spiritual growth you have a better understanding of the word you must be seeing these things in the word you must be so connected with this word amen things that you didn't see but now the Lord is is showing us light is given unto us the Holy Ghost is shining light unto his word amen showing us what the city is about that we are this Eternal City amen we are that City the bride makes up the city am read this quotes open to the message uh uh a guide paragraph 49 when Israel left Egypt for the promised land in Exodus 13:21 God know that they had never traveled that way before it was only 40 miles but yet they needed something to go with him they lose their way so he God send them a guide Exodus 1321 something like this I I send my angel before you the pullow of fire to keep you in the way to guide them to his promised land and the children of Israel followed that guide the pull of Fire by Night A Cloud by day when it stopped they stopped when he journeyed they journeyed and when he got them close to the land and they wasn't foot to go over he led them back into the Wilderness again he wouldn't go with them that's what it is the church today no doubt but what the longsuffering of God today like it was in the days of Noah the church would done been gone if it had just corrected and set in order but he has to lead us around and around and around little did Israel know when they were shouting on seeing dead soldiers of Egypt the drowned ERS Pharaoh's chariots turned up upside down they got their Victory Moses in the spirit singing in the spirit Miriam dancing in the spirit and the daughters of Israel running up and down the bank shouting and dancing they only a few days from milk and honey little do they know it was 40 years because they begin to Grumble against God and the guide amen now the guide speaks to the fivefold ministry the Holy Ghost speaks through the word I mean the word comes which is the Holy Ghost comes through the five4 ministry so it is grumbling and moaning how you expect to see this things but but when there's a Harmony you begin to realize it's just a parallel Dimension it's just another dimension and you've been changing from the inside out yes there's a change taking place you're pushing out your pyramid from the from this Earth you're pushing out a pyramid that you're going to be ready now and you take that step like seven step like Enoch and he was translated you taken away amen so right now you when you come in such a Harmony you begin to see this is just here I'm so connected that is why you find sometimes you feeling the presence of God just taken away because why you're bumping into the dimension amen you're bumping into Angels amen and you feel good in the presence of God sometime even while you're worshiping you feel good because you're bumping into Angels amen paragraph 56 God told them that he would send them a guide he would lead them in the way and as long as they followed that P of fire they was all right he led them up to the promised land gate and that was as far as he would go he was to go then Joshua that great warrior remember the day that he told them sanctify yourself the third day God going to open up Jordan here and we're going across now watch what he said in the scripture he said stay close behind the HK for you not passed this way before amen the ark is the word so what was the ark amen the word don't travel your denominational Roots now stay right behind the words so if you want to have this body this translation work you've got to stay behind the words amen don't travel your denominational Roots now stay right behind the word cuz you hav passed this way before you see that is why when you're walking in this translation walk in this hour you're not coming to your denomination ways of what you thought the Rapture is about they thought that the Rapture is about God is coming and everyone seeing him in the sky no this is a secret catching away it's not for everybody and it's not as you think Heaven is up in the sky it's a dimension it took a prophet to go beyond the curtain of time come to give us back that report amen one who went and testified of the land you have to come this way amen not the way you were thought or not the way it was put in pictures and all the things that you're growing up in in your you know the artist impression of it and things like of heaven and so forth Heaven is not like that amen it's another dimension yes but it's a real ex Dimension Prophet said it's not people playing hops in the cloud it's not just we have real bodies there amen it's a real place he said stay behind the word cuz you haven't passed this way before and brother if there ever was a time that the Christian ought to examine itself it's right now so you see they don't realize that the Rapture cycle already started with a shout a short a voice there must be a resurrection and then the Trump of God then the then the Quicken and those that are raised from the dead and us who are alive and remain will be changed and transformed we will go with them amen they don't realize the process of the Rapture because it's a secret am it's not a public show amen the seven seal wasn't a public show yes the seven seal got to do it is coming but it's a secret amen it's only revealed to us amen [Music] so you see you haven't passed this way before and brother if there was a time that the Christian Church ought to examine itself is right now we right now where this great meeting is going on in Rome right now differences are being made the confederation of churches where all these denominations are confederated together to form the image of the Beast just exactly what the Bible says and you know what we said this morning in the message messages and here we are right everything right at the door and people still following our the Creed you better stay behind the word the word the word would lead you across because the word is Christ and Christ is God and God is the Holy Ghost stay behind the word yes sir stay with that guide stay right behind it don't get in front of it you stay behind it let it lead you don't you don't you lead it you let it go Joshua said now You' never passed this way before you know nothing about the road that's the trouble today you don't need no guy to guide you down the Broadway oh you know all the aliens and everything else you know all the way to sin oh you been around a long time there's no need of somebody trying to tell you about that you know all the shortcuts that's right every sin you know all about it nobody has to tell you how to steal you know that nobody has to tell you how to curse you know that nobody has to tell you how to do this evil thing because it's posted on every tree everywhere it's posted on every social media now on every Network now through the fourth dimension but remember you people that Christian you've crossed over you in another land you are born again you in the land a Heavenly land you were in the promised land praise be to God we're in the land of the Holy Ghost amen we come out of the church age into the bright age amen we receive the new births and now we' come in the promised land in the land of the Holy Ghost so let us be fruitful in this land Amen Let us be fruitful and flourish in this land because why we we we drawing from an inexhaustible Fountain of Life every of blessings belongs to us God didn't deprive us of any blessings amen he blessed abundantly amen with every blessing he didn't withhold anything from us amen all that was lost in the Garden of Eden as being restored to Adam amen this a bride Adam amen back to Dominion again back to sunship again amen second Peter 1 1:2 says knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but only men of God spake as they were moved by the holy ghost that is still the same today amen men of God are moved when they are moved I mean speak when they are moved by the Holy Ghost we don't want theology amen we don't want man-made teachings but we want to be moved we want to speak as we are moved by the Holy Ghost Amen in the message how can I overcome he says we see this age that we're living in is one of the grandest of all ages of all ages the L here in church age is the grandest of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity amen that's why he taking us out of the church into the bright age amen because from the L and church age we come out yes and we go into the bright which is blending of Eternity it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age that's ever been because this is the hour when the fourth of Rider is riding and then the N is following him and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against that it was in any age yeah back there in early ages a Christian could for his profession of being a church of belonging to Christ could be beheaded for it he could be killed and put out of his misery and go to God quickly but now the enemy has coming in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception when Christ said so the true spirits will be so close in the last days till it will receive the very elected if it were possible remember Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day it would receive the very elected if it were possible so close the people so live people can live a clean holy life people can believe this message in terms of when I say believe the message I mean come in the uh the message and have the church order and Doctrine in other words they can live clean lives they can live holy lives they can dress ight and they can go to a messy church but not be connected not be connected with the guide and if you're not connected with the guide how are you going to be translated in to people can be in serving in the message for so many years but the message is not in them the message is the Holy Ghost the messenger of the hate is the Holy Ghost amen they haven't become one with the word there's no Harmony between them and Christ you talk to them all they know of the message is a long ha and a long dress and going to a certain church but they don't know nothing about how the word is changing how the word is now progressing amen the word is becoming more clearer and now the word is transforming you amen and getting you ready for translation amen they can live above that and still not with it amen didn't didn't the Bible say there be foolish virgins as well those that didn't receive the Holy Ghost they didn't want they didn't want to be stimulated by Revelation amen they didn't have they was happy with the Des the wine they had they didn't want new wine they want more wine to to fill bottles up with wine the Holy Ghost in Noah's time time of today Jesus referred to it and said as it was in Noah's time so shall it be in the coming of the son of man in Noah's time so shall it be in the coming of the son of man notice they were they were all that anti anti-an World perhaps of millions of people they were eight Overcomers eight people overcome that was real genuine Overcomers there was Noah three sons and and their wives no one and his wife eight overcome they entered the Ark at the appropriate time how did they do it they listen to the word of God they were caught outside the door they sorry they wasn't caught outside the door they were caught inside the door oh my beloved friends don't let that door shut Jesus said as it was in the days in that day so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so shall it be in the coming of the son man now there's somebody is going to get caught outside that door many of them might have had good intentions and someday if such things happen we'll go in with brother Noah cuz he's a fine fellow but you see it caught just 8 in five now think hard now if you are laying around getting dirty get in hurry quick cuz the door might close at any time and there's always been an ark in God's economy there was an ark in the days of Noah for the saving of his people there was an ark in the days of the law Ark of testimony in the days of the law they followed the ark and there is a third dispensation now like Noah's time lot's time and now this time there is an ark now and that Ark is not a denomination neither it is it a good works that you do it is by one Spirit Romans 8:1 we all baptized into one body in the domain of the the kingdom there's one spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you in the Kingdom buy a holy ghost baptism that's the only way you overcome it's all that is under the shed blood is Overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you you resting amen aren't you glad aren't you glad that we just resting in him amen we know what happened was when the foolish virgin went to buy the oil the door was shut amen and he kned typ the bride Enoch Enoch went to the uh he was translated and taken up amen typing the translated sins Enoch was translated without de typing as himen so there will be some that that who are alive and remain while we are yet live and remain we shall be changed amen but right now we are moving into position for translation through the preaching of the word amen it's the holy ghost that is moving us into position for translation and putting us in harmony the bride and the bridegroom walking in such a Harmony where she become one with him amen as Jesus prayed father may they be one even as We Are One there is a Oneness with the bride and the bridegroom she has become one with the word she's been transformed into the word image and producing nothing else but Jesus Christ being displayed once again
