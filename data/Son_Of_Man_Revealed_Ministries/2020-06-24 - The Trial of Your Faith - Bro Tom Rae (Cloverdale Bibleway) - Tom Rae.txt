gathered is it now much to raise a lot so we left with it now just thinking even better what can separate us from the love of God amen nothing well says nothing nothing at us not what we do that can separate us from the love of God and if you look at his choosing and predestination you've got to choose that's perfect then I don't think any of us have it so he chose us with all our faults amen with all our feelings whatever we go through and see great men in the Bible who did all these spirits anointed of God God who's them and you know there were situations in the life that arose and lot of them fell you look at Samson you look at David you know they were so close to God David a man after God's own heart and I could not using him so much and everything else and you know so nothing will separate us from the love of God it shows us with all praise the Lord and the worst of all first of all he sees our heart I want anything he sees how we feel about anything so I believe is graces with us we're gonna be pledged to the service tonight brother Tong ray Cloverdale Bible in Canada briefs on the 14th of this month for people the thing Father's Day and Skype of something within us and it's something within us that's keeping us amantha something there's a faith within us it will just keeping us amen if I'm especially in this world not at this time people are people are pretty and you wonder what's keeping them so they learn of the Lord and not say the em about faith but we as believers you know faith is keeping us from passing the law from pressing on the metal sea and no matter what we go through amen and God has been gracious to us him in the giving us stroke showing us what he went through and what kept him amen never turned his back against God waits alone so I believe God also sauce like that then and he also predestinated us chosen us and no it's a tremendous thing and glorious thing because not everybody can come and serve it now in the real world of the hour see by his grace he chose our sweetness so nothing can change that see so we just thank you for it so I pray that we'll be blessed to the service and so connecting and we can we can also see what other believers that are just part of the world what they believe what their preaching and what they sing to the congregation especially this time like this you know and everything is getting a why and the world don't know where they are going pray you'll be blessed for the word Disease Center or whatever it's called CDC anything and we've got some orders that we have to abide by but I'm praying how we bind that demon and just bind that spirit so that the Church of God get ya there one more time and you move on the authorities and we as a brother this goal is saying we have a unique situation with the border church is a large part of our church is the US side and so we need the orders open and we need our orders changed so God can do anything and I'm looking forward to having a full search again and worshiping the Lord Jesus so don't let you and that keep everything in that aspect in your prayers this week that as I was joining I tied into the service of brother Ron Spencer's and brother Edgar was announced that next week they get that I have a full church and I think I'd turn green I'll green with envy that they can have the whole church together and they're looking forward to a wonderful time so god bless them and those churches that can gather those that have heard them under the sound of this great gospel message god bless the bride around the world so if you wouldn't mind standing please I like to read out a number of scriptures this morning and I'd like to speak on there's something within there's something more than a man ever brother brother made reference to there's something within if you want to check it out as you do your studies maybe this week you'll find that they capitalize to something because if something is something it's the someone and it's our lovely Lord Jesus so there's something within is our title so I think you to turn please then to Colossians chapter 1 verse 27 Colossians chapter 1 verse 27 and if you don't mind I have a number quotes the scriptures I'll be following along maybe not preaching as much but you never know and Washington's chapter 1 twice happens to pray with me that's where you go along in this service this morning Russians in verse 27 to whom god would make known what is the riches but the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory remember the title now there's something within so now that you determine Galatians chapter 2 verse 1 Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 very familiar description I'm sure for all of us Paul is writing here to the Galatians I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ living in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I want you to notice now I live by the faith by the live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me that's why our heads one more time father we bow in your presence we're thankful for the word of government we pray now for inspiration and guidance and under the anointing of the Holy Ghost that you will need every need in divine presence Lord your prophet said within you come and I believe in your coming something that happens well that's something good happen order to the prodigious how you give us this morning I mean that presidents have got saturate them and make the glory of God fill them in Jesus name Amen amen you may have your seats bless you now I'm going to be following along I think you to follow along with me as we go through number of scriptures here and they also now just the last scripture reading before we start speaking first Peter chapter 1 verse Peter chapter 1 verse 7 first Peter chapter 1 what am i and I always say one of my favorite scriptures but they're all of my favorite so noise will start them on verse 3 down to verse 7 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy have begotten us a game with a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God I want you to notice now again who are kept by the power of God through faith through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time this revelation is going to be revealed in the last time now continue with me please where in you greatly rejoice though now not forth now for a season it may be ye are any heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial here we go to face again the trial of your faith and that's what Peter is now we're honing in on that is the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that perish that would be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ many scriptures that we read make reference to ourselves within the scripture and we need to see if brother Graham said we need to see ourselves in the word so as Paul was writing not only is he writing to the Colossians or typical ations or the Church of Philippi is also writing to the church in laodicea that is in this age not just in Laodicea at the time of the writings the description so we need to look at the Bible when we need to look at the Word of God as though he's ready personally to ourselves he's our in the David he's earning to buy the Michael he's writing to Ben he's writing to us and a speaking the Holy Spirit is speaking through them because the scripture says that were men evolved moved at the Holy Ghost were moved of God to write these scriptures and so we know then that God wrote the Bible and the Bible is our absolute and our absolute is what we stand on but that absolute that we stand on that we have our faith in it's going to be tested so is this a strange thing that we find ourselves in these dire temptations I don't believe so but I believe is the Prophet said to us and we've quoted it through the years and we know it by off by heart that the entire message meets the in kind condition there are many people today that are under under fear they're under the thoughts that we try to torment them and fear actually comes from that word torment and they worry about what is happening to morale but we have to come to conclusions of God that the God that has revealed himself to us is that God that's going to take us from where we were to where we're going and this is what I'd like to look at this morning is that which is in you that's already started this journey and the thoughts of God and have always been declared that we are the sea gene or we are the journey of God and we've come from God and we're going back to God and we thought we thought that but now we we actually understand that by maybe memory he said well I've heard brother Tom picture matter but the visible picture on a different bus bridge on that and when we understand that because we can memorize that or we can actually have an experience of what they're speaking of and that's what I wanted our rest on this morning is that where we're going and what God has done thus far with in our lives it has not been you at all it has been that something in you that is taking you and moving you into heavenly places and so more and more as we go along way more and more even the children of Israel as we we looked at today Old Testament we find it here on the eighth that's an a very powerful very powerful chapter that the children of Israel actually started to say that they got a deliverance out of Egypt by their own personal strength or anything that they had Trant ain't - was because of themselves and we have to start looking back at Nina shadowing types and start realizing it's not what we did to achieve anything is all of what God has already done in for us not going down the paths now but also in the future so there is a reason and you have to it myself we have to understand that what's the reason that God is calling us or dealing with us and showing the Satan number one that this brought will not fail but I want to go back to the scriptures now and fine I want you to follow along with me because the scripture has to be the absolute that you fall back to and those scriptures at the Prophet unveiled to us and God has revealed to us personally are the scriptures that we need to walk in faced by so let's turn to first Peter 1 and 7 again and I'd like you to follow along in that verse with me again but the trial not trials but the trial of your faith a lot of times people take all the trials we're going through but I want you to look at now the way that Peter actually pinned the by the scripture down is the trial of your faith the trial of your faith being more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire so now we understand as we're reading and slowly there's gonna be some trials and the trials that have come it's not you your everyday living trials we're talking about the things that God has revealed to you it's going to be challenged and so then you actually have to understand them than if the God has revealed something to me brother Graham said there's not enough countries in the world that's going to stop me from achieving what God has for me so now God has a purpose in that call and now Satan is going to try your faith as we have seen over the years many people's faith or their revelation has been tried it's been tried by trial and it's been tried by fire and it hasn't stood because sense of God it was a learning and not a revelation and that's what I would like to look at today because once it's revealed to you nothing can shake you from the promise so are you young people when you hear us preaching better job it's not just preaching to preach a message it's to preach a word that will come into your heart that God have happened we'll come and inspire it team up so that when Satan comes he's coming against the word yes and that word cannot be moved it's not learned it's revealed now the trial of your faith Peter is writing the trial of your faith I often have said over the years when Michael was a little boy whenever he had read books which he did often he'd always read the end of the book and obviously the Micah said why are you reading the end of the book he says well I like reading into the book because I like to know how this story comes out and so I like to read revelations because I like to know how the church turns out and I know that there is a church triumphant that's going to overcome and leave the sea you ain't no different than no I think build an ark for the saving of his household it was by his faith that was going to be tested his face the triumph of your faith I would say this cool man is really coming against your face the different ones I have talked to the different ones and we've talked to many they said brother Tom tell the Saints we're standing strong and I and I thought it's not very standing amen but it's the face of the word of God in him that's something in them that's holding them they're not afraid of the virus they're not afraid they're not under fear but they're walking in faith let me read something brother Brown says in the fourth seal he says there was a life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up called death now there he is an Earthbound delegates and Christ now is gathering his heaven-born subjects he's got death Road on him and Christ has got life wrote on him so you see death and life are in the struggle again he said those with him on the white horse are called the chosen before the foundation of the world so it's the chosen that God gives them faith to overcome the world now watch even their faith now that faith that God puts in you is going to be tried and this by being out in Revelation or another under the for sale you have to see yourself with that word in you chosen before the foundation of the world those are the faithful ones by means of a man it's not like that one you're the cult and chosen before the foundation of the world faithful to the work because God has made this weren't real to you so you're faithful to the word so now as we take a look at this I wanted to turn now to Hebrews chapter 4 Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 wonderful scripture Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 that's something that is in you and we'll get into that that's something that is in you is going to be challenged so now the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 for the word of God is what quick the word about quick it's powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the one thought the cerner of the thought and intent of the parts let's take a look at what the Hebrew says here the Word of God is living and it's active and it's full of power so abandon people for the time we are the Word made flesh thing we sing it often I've got that word living in me to see what's that something that is in you that's living its Christ in me the hope of jewelry so now here is Paul writing to the Hebrews for the word of God is living it's active and it's full of power the Word of God it makes it operative it's full of energy it's sharper than any two-edged sword it divides asunder to so much spirit and to devote to both the joint and marrow the deepest part of our nature exposing and judging the very thoughts and intents of our heart so God sees what's in a believer God knows what's in your heart this morning and the Word of God is here too now brother Graham said the word of God faced up by Arian everyone the Word of God so now this word that you're hearing is coming over this Bolton but I want you to hear it from a different place from your ears to your heart I want that word to drop down to your heart there's many people that hear with their ears and hear not Jesus said but there's another people that is here with a different hearing and that word is sharper than any two edges are piercing asunder so now we want that word that is full of power that worth and is living that word that is active we want it now to come to the surface and show to those that are around us we need are standing true to the Word of God but the rent said now I want you to notice here he said notice faith is a revelation and if I ask you this morning how many times that brother branham say faith is a revelation because thing has to be revealed to you how many times brother Brown say that he said my father brother Brown sell a lot of times as we hear it faith is a revelation and so in many times Revelation gets overused but I want you to understand brother Brown says that five times he says it five times once an anointed ones once an invisible Union twice in Martin st. express and once the rock to the Branson revelation is the only thing revelation of the word what is a revelation upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it so faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you the trial of your revelation it is going to come down to your address band it's not something that we just look in the scriptures and we're going to go through trials we're going to go through a lot of trials whether you get a job whether it gets fired whether or not this whole economy is going to crumble but now we have to start to understand then that it's our faith that God is interested in seeing that that same that gets tested is unshakable it's unmovable and we cannot fall brother Brian said so now we look at the word what is that that is unshakable in us the faith that revelation that God's revealed to you let me record another quote faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation the rest of that work sustained Express there's where I want to stay just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by His grace so this word that God has revealed to you has now been revealed to you by what His grace this word is revealed to you by His grace it's nothing Tom did Vincent it's nothing you did you didn't work up to this you didn't work yourself into it you ever had faith it was given to you by the grace of God so this trial of your faith is given to you by the grace of God but he's going to give you the grace to go through that trial did he get that this faith is given to you by Grace and he's going to give you grace to go through the trial of your faith he revealed it to you by His grace God reveals it to you think there's a revelation the whole church is built on now here's the last time he says it in the rapture but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that'll be the grace of God that reveals the rapture to her that the revelation the true bride price will be waiting for the revelation sin of the rapture the true right of price is now waiting for the revelation of the rapture this will be your trial Satan will defeat you he's not buffeting you by here your external or external trials that you have you don't have gasps you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have rent you don't have this is part is not what Peter is writing about he's writing about your faith your faith is what's going to be tested so by faith Abel offered by faith Noah built an army by faith Abraham was called by faith Sarah can see strength by faith Tom received a revelation of this message that's going to put him in the rapture by faith and every one of those that you read in Hebrews 11 it was by faith and their faith was tried to get that their faith was tried it's tried by fire give you imagine coming to church and I look at this church like this pretty false one what there's what half a dozen three full but do you know brother Graham said he said Noah preached four hundred twenty years and only preach to a family can you imagine doing that I can barely get through these last three months pitching to half a dozen people but for a hundred and twenty years by saying Noah was tested my faith Abraham I said a cordon off that promise his promise it was his revelation that I was gonna come a promise and that was his revelation it was going to be trapped by fire giving you by do it Abraham by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice would never been able by saying there is going to be something that's going to be tested and when he went out to the mountain he said the land I shall return he didn't know what God was going to do it the way he did it but God's showing him that that Sun was coming back I don't know how you're going to get into this right sure but I know one thing if you're the call of God God's gonna revel at you and bring you into another revelation and Saints about we're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye by faith I think that's how I'd like you to turn to Hebrews chapter 11 with me I love the scripture here Hebrews chapter 11 just so that you know since of God I don't believe you're gonna get off easy I don't think any one of us is gonna get off easy this is not a silver plate in gospel you're gonna have to fight for everything that's within you but you have to know that there's something in you that's greater than what they can throw at you to keep you from this great revelation hebrews chapter 11 the Bible says here in verse 32 and what shall I say for the time was fail me to tell of gideon barak samson jephthah of david samuel of the prophets who is sure what safe through things the fire escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women sisters received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance sixty-eight million martyrs think about it that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trials of cruel mockings scourgings moreover a bombs and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder what was the enemy fighting he was testing the trial was coming to test their faith can you stand and I want you to say within your heart this morning it's no longer me that standeth but it's Christ in me that's going to stamp the onslaught of the enemy they thought of faith and the Bible says in verse 39 and they all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise go on having provided some better thing now he's talking to you God having provided some better thing for us they went up on us should not be made perfect yes that's incredible look how their faith was tested I don't care if it was Damien and I Murphy spoke so wonderfully about it how did the sword was going to be a picture really this picture it's going to be my store but there was going to be a testing of his faith because the angel told him that he was gonna conquer his enemies you have to believe this anything so it's gonna be by faith the testing of your faith I want you to get that this morning it's the testing of the revelation that you have people fall away after years of coming to back away or coming to churches around the goal they fall away sings about because it has not been a revelation to them it's been something they have learned that from the message now notice here I want you to follow the line in verse 40 with me I'm gonna go to the grief and you follow along in now the King James your Bible says God having provided something better for us the greek says this god had us in his mind he had something better for us so that these men and women of faith would not be made perfect that is they aren't there that is completed in iam apart from us so God had to give on us he had something better for us he had that full word to come on so we also can say by saying brother can conquer to Laodicea by faith man you've conquered the spirits that were trying to bring up people down now I don't know about you but I know as we see this world falling apart its falling apart faster than what we would have give it credit for years ago how did we think that a whole world be crippled by a virus who would have thought that a whole world will bend their knee to a virus I don't know what that demon looks like now where the power of it that it is now in folding a people before in gathering and people support many times a church becomes a support system and they come to church to get their moral support and maybe there's a testing of this faith that God has given us he showed you Satan this bride doesn't matter what virus what spirit what devil like imp would come against her she isn't gonna buckle in she's got something went in that is greater without there's something within us God had us in mind and has something better for us can you imagine God knew that we would need the full unveiling of his word to battle and win this contest he has something better for us we would know that in the evening there was it's not going to be called day nor night but it shall come to pass that in the evening time there would be something better for us there shall be light if we walk that in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin if we walk in the light of the revelation of God's Word that we walk in himself who is the light we walk in Christ we have true unbroken fellowship with him and with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all of our sin so this light that if thought is given us something better this light that is coming as AIDS and it's going to give you the ability this light to shine that's something within to bring for that light this light is living in you it's pulsating its energy it's a work that's active and it's a power and you stood here
