[17:50] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Psalms
[17:53] 107 says, "Give thanks to the Lord for
[17:57] his good and his mercy endures forever."
[18:01] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[18:11] A event and a services of this
[18:15] magnitude doesn't happen just like that.
[18:18] There's a lot of hard work that goes
[18:20] behind the scenes.
[18:22] So we'd like to propose a vote of thanks
[18:25] this afternoon. And we want to thank our
[18:27] Lord Jesus Christ for making it possible
[18:30] for us to have this blessed meeting.
[18:40] To the various pastors and
[18:43] congregations, worship teams of the
[18:46] various churches in Durban, we want to
[18:48] say to you a very very big heartfelt
[18:51] thank you.
[19:01] We um also want to place on record our
[19:03] sincere thanks to the ushers, deacons,
[19:07] and all those brethren who were assisted
[19:09] with the parking, especially on Friday.
[19:12] It wasn't easy with the rain, but
[19:14] everything went through seamlessly.
[19:16] Let's give them a
[19:18] [Music]
[19:23] nice We also want to thank the various
[19:26] brothers that from the various churches
[19:29] that assisted on Friday or early hours
[19:32] of Friday morning to set this place up.
[19:34] We want to say a very big thank you to
[19:37] you
[19:42] together for our service providers. We
[19:45] want to thank Oade and the Taj
[19:47] Convention Center. How many of you
[19:49] enjoyed this
[19:55] venue? But I'd like to give a special uh
[19:58] thank you to sister
[20:01] Nisha and Verona and Julie. There are
[20:06] three sisters that actually work for the
[20:09] uh the hall.
[20:11] They are um they're not in the message
[20:13] of the hour, but they're believers in
[20:15] the Lord Jesus Christ. They didn't
[20:17] realize that it was a service that was
[20:19] being held and they were just a bit sad
[20:22] that they were missing their church
[20:23] service. But what have they human to
[20:26] understand? They were really touched by
[20:27] the meeting
[20:38] to the point that on Friday when the
[20:39] picture of the pyramid was put up, one
[20:42] of the sisters took it down and she went
[20:45] on her phone to basically uh look at the
[20:48] meanings of some of those things.
[20:51] God works in mysterious way.
[20:57] They really assisted us in such a humble
[21:00] way and we truly want to say thank you
[21:02] to them. We know what the prophet says
[21:05] about that. We also want to thank Deon
[21:08] and the team from Rama Security. We
[21:11] thank God thus far we've had an
[21:14] incidentless convention. Let's give the
[21:16] Lord and
[21:20] praise to all the armed and armed
[21:24] security guards. We want to say thank
[21:26] you as well and we truly appreciate
[21:29] their efforts. We want to thank Fahim
[21:31] and Crescent Sound for the song that we
[21:33] had over this weekend. God bless you
[21:35] tremendously.
[21:41] Also these meetings over the weekend
[21:43] were taken all across the world and it
[21:45] would not have been possible had it not
[21:47] been for the teams from the various
[21:48] churches that have been live streaming.
[21:50] God bless you abundantly. Let's give
[21:57] them we also want to thank the pastors
[22:00] and various families that took the time
[22:02] off. many people can contribute and so
[22:05] forth, but very few people today can
[22:07] give their time. So for those people and
[22:10] those brethren and sisters that took
[22:12] time to take our precious pastor dele
[22:14] out for his meals, we want to say a very
[22:17] big thank you to you. Let's

[22:33] tomorrow. The meeting starts at 9:30 and

[22:54] people are at the meeting tomorrow.

[33:57] mighty name of Jesus.
[34:00] You told Moses, "Tell the people to
[34:02] bring a willing offering." And the
[34:04] people brought a willing offering.
[34:07] Father, during this series of meetings,
[34:09] your people had brought a willing
[34:11] offering. I pray that you will bless
[34:13] these offerings that have been taken up.
[34:15] Lord, pray that it will be used for the
[34:18] reestablishment of your kingdom. Father,
[34:21] I pray you will bless those who made a
[34:23] sacrifice to give. Some people have
[34:26] needs, but they have put God above their
[34:28] needs. Even as they have put God above
[34:31] their needs, may he supply their needs.
[34:34] We commit them into your hands, Jesus.
[34:37] Father, we've come to the most important
[34:39] part of your word. This morning you
[34:42] unveiled yourself before us. It was such
[34:45] a spiritual romance took place this
[34:48] morning. I felt like my husband was
[34:51] standing in front of me undressed. It
[34:54] was such an intimate moment as the
[34:56] layers of your word was healed back Lord
[34:59] and you spoke to us Lord. Mercy was
[35:03] extended this morning. I pray oh God
[35:06] that none will leave the service without

[1:01:07] Yeah. Just a little encouragement
[1:01:10] tonight. John chapter
[1:01:14] 11. I would like to take from verse
[1:01:18] 18 to 28.
[1:01:34] Now Bethany was nigh unto
[1:01:36] Jerusalem about 15 fullons off and many
[1:01:41] of the Jews came to Ma and Mary to
[1:01:44] comfort them concerning their brother.
[1:01:48] Then Ma, as soon as she heard that Jesus
[1:01:52] was coming, went and met him. For Mary
[1:01:57] sat still in the house.
[1:02:00] Then said matter unto
[1:02:02] Jesus, Lord, if thou had been here, my
[1:02:06] brother had not died.
[1:02:09] But I know that even now, whatsoever
[1:02:12] thou will ask of God,
[1:02:15] God will give him thee. Amen. Jesus said
[1:02:19] unto her, "Thy brother shall rise
[1:02:23] again." Amen.
[1:02:26] Ma said unto him, "I know that he shall
[1:02:29] rise again in the resurrection at the
[1:02:32] last day."
[1:02:34] Jesus said unto her,
[1:02:37] "What you are looking for in the future
[1:02:40] is the resurrection,
[1:02:45] he that believeth in me, though he dead,
[1:02:50] yet shall be. And whosoever liveth and
[1:02:53] believeth in me shall never die, believe
[1:02:56] that this." How many believe tonight?
[1:03:00] Amen.
[1:03:02] Jesus said unto him, "Yeah, Lord, I
[1:03:06] believe that thou art the Christ, the
[1:03:09] Son of God, which should come into the
[1:03:12] world." And when she had so said, she
[1:03:16] went away and called Mary her sister
[1:03:19] secretly, saying, "The master is come
[1:03:23] and call for thee." Hallelujah. May the
[1:03:25] Lord add his blessings to the reading of
[1:03:28] his holy word. Amen. God bless you. You
[1:03:31] may please be seated.
[1:03:41] Like to welcome you all one more time to
[1:03:43] the house of the Lord again tonight in
[1:03:45] the name of Jesus Christ. And uh I want
[1:03:50] to thank everyone of you for cooperating
[1:03:55] with the meeting and uh like I said your
[1:03:59] coming is an encouragement
[1:04:02] uh to
[1:04:03] me. I am not one of those who will say
[1:04:07] that whether you come or you don't come
[1:04:10] preach anyhow.
[1:04:12] Yeah. Maybe there's a circumstance for
[1:04:14] that but I love to appeal to you to
[1:04:16] come.
[1:04:19] It helps me better when you come.
[1:04:22] So because you came, I am deeply
[1:04:24] encouraged
[1:04:27] you made the trip worldwide. So I want
[1:04:30] to ask that the Lord bless you richly
[1:04:34] and all the sacrifices that you have
[1:04:36] made to be here part of this meeting.
[1:04:39] May the Lord richly reward you. Amen.
[1:04:42] And I thank you for coming. I pray the
[1:04:44] Lord will keep you healthy. Amen. Will
[1:04:47] keep you strong, more importantly
[1:04:49] serving the Lord all the days of your
[1:04:52] life.
[1:04:54] And
[1:04:55] uh there's a there's a proverb in my
[1:04:58] country that says if we are related, we
[1:05:00] shall meet again.
[1:05:03] And I know we are related. Hallelujah.
[1:05:07] I may not be a South African,
[1:05:10] but we have a better God. Hallelujah.
[1:05:13] That transcend every nationality. Yes.
[1:05:16] And that is the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:20] God has given me the privilege to travel
[1:05:22] a bit around and uh there's no place
[1:05:27] I've ever been stranded because my
[1:05:30] family member my family is a very large
[1:05:32] family. Hallelujah. Amen. Extremely
[1:05:36] large. I don't know if your family is as
[1:05:39] large as but I can tell you for free
[1:05:42] that you are part of that family or not.
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:48] years ago I traveled uh to Dublin and I
[1:05:52] with some people and they just wanted me
[1:05:56] to help attend to some matters for them
[1:05:59] some years ago. So they were my friends
[1:06:04] but they don't see this light as such.
[1:06:06] So I will tell them there's no country I
[1:06:09] will go I will be stranded. They said,
[1:06:12] "Ah." He said, "What does that mean?" I
[1:06:14] said, "Because I have family
[1:06:15] everywhere."
[1:06:18] So they didn't get it. He said, "You
[1:06:21] mean you have family all over the
[1:06:22] world?" I said, "Preaching all over the
[1:06:24] world."
[1:06:25] Amen. So when they took me to Dublin in
[1:06:29] the island after we finished what we
[1:06:32] came for, I said, "I want to go and see
[1:06:34] my family members." They said, "You
[1:06:36] didn't even hear you have family
[1:06:38] members." I said, "Don't worry. We wait
[1:06:40] a little while. They will soon come and
[1:06:42] pick me here. So as we were talking,
[1:06:46] we're talking they saw a car park. I
[1:06:48] said, "My family members have
[1:06:51] arrived." And they came out. They saw
[1:06:53] white, they saw black. They said, "Oh,
[1:06:55] do you have mixed? Do you have all your
[1:06:58] I said
[1:07:03] all?" So even in the amazing forest, I
[1:07:08] have family members. Hallelujah.
[1:07:14] Amaz family members there. So I'm so
[1:07:18] glad for this family of God and uh I
[1:07:22] thank you all. So I know we are related
[1:07:25] and uh because we are family members
[1:07:27] there will always be a family meeting.
[1:07:30] Thank you. We are just trying to finish
[1:07:32] one now. Amen. So as we expect his
[1:07:36] physical return, I trust to God we shall
[1:07:39] have more meetings. And may the Lord
[1:07:42] keep you healthy. May he keep you
[1:07:44] established. May he keep you settled and
[1:07:46] happy watching for his return. And uh he
[1:07:50] will be with you till we meet again. So
[1:07:53] once again I thank the pastors. I thank
[1:07:56] uh all the ministers both the immediate
[1:08:00] organizers and those who supported them
[1:08:03] uh even closed down their churches and
[1:08:05] you know all together they here. May the
[1:08:08] Lord bless you with I want you to know
[1:08:11] that you made the job very easy for me
[1:08:14] in my own little way. It was easy for me
[1:08:16] to glide because you've laid some
[1:08:19] foundation and I've come to write on
[1:08:21] your effort. So I want to thank you for
[1:08:24] the work you are doing for the kingdom
[1:08:26] and I pray that the Lord rich to bless
[1:08:29] all of you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:32] Thank you all. Thank you Lord. It's been
[1:08:34] a wonderful time. So on behalf of my
[1:08:37] wife and myself, we say God bless you.
[1:08:47] So tonight, the Lord placed uh just a
[1:08:51] little thought in my heart for an
[1:08:52] encouragement.
[1:08:54] Amen. Because I want to believe uh uh
[1:08:59] I've almost gotten through with the
[1:09:02] service relative to the convention in
[1:09:04] the morning. So I was just trusting God
[1:09:07] for a blessing that he placed this
[1:09:09] thought in my heart and sometimes God
[1:09:12] has a way of confirming things to me. So
[1:09:15] as we were sitting uh waiting for our
[1:09:18] food at the restaurant some while ago uh
[1:09:22] brother Andrean started speaking.
[1:09:25] He just started talking to me and we're
[1:09:27] talking and he went into those things. I
[1:09:29] said you see. So the thing came back he
[1:09:31] said you see I'm confirming it to you.
[1:09:34] So brother Adrien, maybe I'm fishing in
[1:09:36] your pond again tonight.
[1:09:40] So I trust that it will be a blessing to
[1:09:43] you. I want to speak on the power of his
[1:09:46] presence just for a little while. Amen.
[1:09:50] Just something to encourage you and I
[1:09:52] hope it's a blessing to you. So our sin
[1:09:56] open up tonight in the family that is
[1:09:59] like every other message believer's
[1:10:02] family.
[1:10:04] We have uh this brother called Lazarus
[1:10:07] and his two sisters.
[1:10:10] They used to be denomination believers.
[1:10:14] Just like many of us started from
[1:10:16] denomination.
[1:10:18] But even though they were in the
[1:10:20] denomination, yet they carried the seed
[1:10:23] of God's election.
[1:10:26] Amen. Amen. And uh when God's appointed
[1:10:30] time came, the light of God flashed
[1:10:33] across their path and it connected with
[1:10:37] the seat in there. The one I was trying
[1:10:40] to show you in the morning. Amen. That
[1:10:42] little bottle and it began to tumble for
[1:10:45] life and something registered in their
[1:10:48] heart. They must follow this pastor
[1:10:50] Jesus.
[1:10:52] That's right. So they left their old
[1:10:55] denomination and came to the message of
[1:10:58] their hour.
[1:11:00] Just as you have done
[1:11:03] I I'm bringing it in the way so that you
[1:11:05] can connect with it. You know why the
[1:11:09] the prophet told us no Apostle Paul told
[1:11:12] us that there are many shadows of the
[1:11:15] Bible
[1:11:17] that many of us represent or that
[1:11:20] represented us he told us about the life
[1:11:24] of Abraham he called it an allegory and
[1:11:27] allegory means an event happening
[1:11:31] not for itself but it's happening as a
[1:11:34] foretell
[1:11:36] of the future future events. So the
[1:11:38] entire life of Abraham as powerful as he
[1:11:41] was was ordinary shadow
[1:11:44] a shadow of somebody who is sitting here
[1:11:48] tonight.
[1:11:50] That is why when the prophet bring the
[1:11:52] message identification
[1:11:54] he said prayer becomes easy when we can
[1:11:57] locate ourselves in the scripture.
[1:12:01] Is it going well with you? Amen.
[1:12:04] It said because when you are able to
[1:12:06] find your identity in the Bible, meaning
[1:12:09] all the characters of the Bible played
[1:12:11] out the life of somebody here. So if you
[1:12:15] are able to locate your identity in the
[1:12:18] scripture, it will give you faith.
[1:12:20] Hallelujah. Brother Aram said once you
[1:12:23] locate your identity, find out the
[1:12:26] outcome
[1:12:27] of the life of that identity and it will
[1:12:30] give you an idea. how you also will end
[1:12:33] up.
[1:12:36] Amen. That was the secret that sister
[1:12:39] that the prophet prophet said, "Let us
[1:12:42] call her Auntie Jima." How many ever
[1:12:44] about that? That was the secret of her
[1:12:47] victory. And I tell you what, she wasn't
[1:12:50] even a message believer then. But
[1:12:53] because she understood the principle,
[1:12:56] she received the key to unlock her
[1:12:58] blessing.
[1:13:00] When she was in a very d need, she began
[1:13:03] to look at the scriptures. What is going
[1:13:06] on? Who do I relate to? Then she find
[1:13:11] out that she was the Shunamite woman.
[1:13:14] She said I is the Shunamite woman.
[1:13:18] Because the story of that woman look
[1:13:20] exactly like her story.
[1:13:24] Somebody will connect with their
[1:13:26] identity tonight. Yes, it looked exactly
[1:13:29] like that. He said, "I never had a child
[1:13:33] for a long time. God eventually gave me
[1:13:35] a child." As soon as a woman never had a
[1:13:37] child, God gave her a child. Then as a
[1:13:40] child was growing, he said maybe it was
[1:13:42] a son stroke or whatever it is, the
[1:13:45] child died. He says, "Sin has struck my
[1:13:47] womb and is also going to die."
[1:13:50] Hallelujah. He said, but then
[1:13:54] if I am that Shunamite woman,
[1:13:58] There must be an Elijah.
[1:14:02] Hallelujah.
[1:14:05] [Applause]
[1:14:08] And you know what she did? She didn't
[1:14:10] even pray. She only said, "Lord, where
[1:14:13] is your Elijah?"
[1:14:18] It's powerful how she located herself in
[1:14:21] the scripture. Yes. And that gave her
[1:14:24] faith to trust God for Elijah because
[1:14:28] she believed that the picture must be
[1:14:30] well arranged.
[1:14:31] The picture must be perfect.
[1:14:34] And God answered the Shunamite woman.
[1:14:38] And did you remember the Shunite of our
[1:14:40] time,
[1:14:41] the substance of the shadow of the
[1:14:43] scripture, when the Lord answered her,
[1:14:46] you know what he did? Elijah was
[1:14:48] traveling.
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:51] maybe with very important VIPs
[1:14:55] who had serious appointments
[1:14:58] who are going for an appointment, a
[1:15:01] program, a business meeting or a
[1:15:03] government meeting, a meeting, a policy
[1:15:06] making meeting. But all those things
[1:15:08] never matter to God.
[1:15:11] That's right. In comparison to a woman
[1:15:15] who could locate identity in the
[1:15:17] scripture. Hallelujah.
[1:15:19] Amen. You know what happened? God just
[1:15:22] unpluged a knot in the
[1:15:24] airplane for the sake of that moment
[1:15:28] and it's still the same God tonight. I
[1:15:31] don't know what your needs are, but I'm
[1:15:33] encouraging you tonight. You have no
[1:15:36] reason to give up on anything. The
[1:15:40] strength of Israel can never lie. Only
[1:15:44] believe all things are possible.
[1:15:48] Yes.
[1:15:52] When God unplugged a knot in that
[1:15:55] aeroplane, God guided the part of the
[1:15:57] aeroplane and it landed right
[1:16:01] in the city where that woman lived
[1:16:05] Memphis Tennessee. That is not a
[1:16:08] coincidence. That was the harm of God.
[1:16:13] And the spirit moved the prophet to come
[1:16:15] down and he thought he was going to do
[1:16:18] postal service.
[1:16:20] He packed letters to go and post and the
[1:16:23] Lord told him I didn't get you down here
[1:16:25] to post letters.
[1:16:28] Keep moving.
[1:16:30] Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] Brother Abraham asked the officials how
[1:16:34] long will it take to fix the plane? They
[1:16:36] said 4 hours. He said that's enough time
[1:16:38] to post my letter. But as he went about
[1:16:41] posting letter, God said, "Keep moving."
[1:16:44] And he kept moving, turning the corner,
[1:16:47] approaching the streets, not knowing
[1:16:50] where she was, he was going. But the
[1:16:52] same God
[1:16:54] that stopped the airplane
[1:16:56] when to tell the woman, he said, Elijah
[1:16:59] you asked for his ear. Because God has
[1:17:02] got to work on both hands.
[1:17:07] He's still the same God tonight.
[1:17:09] Hallelujah. Shortly before day break, he
[1:17:12] gave the woman a dream of the identity
[1:17:15] of Elijah. Those of you are doubting
[1:17:18] Elijah,
[1:17:20] you got to examine yourself.
[1:17:22] Those of you are doubting the message,
[1:17:25] you got to examine yourself. These are
[1:17:28] memorials, stories that will never die.
[1:17:32] God has already vindicated Elijah before
[1:17:36] us. You may have your doubts. We don't
[1:17:39] know your origin. We don't know your
[1:17:42] destination. But we are certain that God
[1:17:45] did us a favor by sending brother.
[1:17:48] Hallelujah.
[1:17:49] [Applause]
[1:17:52] Hallelujah.
[1:17:54] Amen. And Elijah kept going. The woman
[1:17:59] was so certain
[1:18:01] that this was of the Lord till she came
[1:18:04] out and stood by the entrance of my
[1:18:06] house watching that for Elijah.
[1:18:10] I don't know how long she waited. But
[1:18:13] guess what? Elijah approached.
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:17] And as Elijah was coming, the woman
[1:18:20] looked at her, looked at him. He said,
[1:18:22] "Yes, it's got a hat on. It's got that
[1:18:25] black. It's got the color of the thing.
[1:18:27] This must be the Elijah. Amen.
[1:18:29] Elijah didn't know where he was coming.
[1:18:32] That's right. But the woman to whom she
[1:18:34] was, he was sent knew Elijah was coming.
[1:18:38] Hallelujah.
[1:18:40] And as Elijah was passing by, you
[1:18:43] remember I said good morning person.
[1:18:48] You are supposed to come here. Brother
[1:18:51] said when I looked at her, she looked
[1:18:53] old enough for me to call her auntie.
[1:18:55] Yes. And I said, "Auntie, how did you
[1:18:58] know me?" Then she gave her testimony
[1:19:02] that this was what God told me. I've
[1:19:04] been waiting here for you to arrive.
[1:19:06] Thank God you arrive. He will arrive for
[1:19:10] you.
[1:19:12] Keep waiting. Those that wait upon the
[1:19:14] Lord shall renew their strength. A man
[1:19:18] with wings as an angel. They will run
[1:19:20] and not be weary. They will walk and
[1:19:23] never wait. May the Lord teach you and
[1:19:25] how to wait upon the Lord.
[1:19:30] Do you know brother Abraham said I still
[1:19:32] don't understand
[1:19:34] but he followed inside. And when he got
[1:19:37] there auntie Jim said you know this is
[1:19:41] the boy I raised him up in the right way
[1:19:46] but he took the wrong road and taking
[1:19:48] the wrong road I caught up with him.
[1:19:51] He's got some disease that he may not be
[1:19:54] able to come out of. I only want one
[1:19:57] thing. I want him to know God in
[1:19:59] salvation. Even if God is going to take
[1:20:02] him, what a man's love. If God is not
[1:20:06] going to spare him, I just want him
[1:20:08] saved. I want an assurance that he has
[1:20:12] settled it with God.
[1:20:15] Your effort can never be in vain.
[1:20:18] Let me give you a blessing. You are the
[1:20:21] nearest kinsmen
[1:20:23] to those children. Your prayers must
[1:20:26] avail. That's what the prophet said.
[1:20:30] When you stand in the gap for those
[1:20:31] children, don't mind whatever they are
[1:20:34] doing. They are mere symptoms.
[1:20:38] Those that observe those symptoms are
[1:20:41] observing lying vages.
[1:20:43] We don't live by what we see. We live by
[1:20:47] what we believe.
[1:20:49] So even if you pray and things are
[1:20:52] getting worse with them, hold on to the
[1:20:55] promise of prayer, it will never fail,
[1:20:59] you never leave to see them come to God.
[1:21:02] I give you a guarantee they will still
[1:21:04] come to God because God is banking your
[1:21:07] prayers. He's banking your prayers at
[1:21:10] the appointed time. He will bring it to
[1:21:13] remembrance and they will find their way
[1:21:15] to the altar. God himself. I've seen
[1:21:19] many children, many sons, many daughters
[1:21:23] come to the altar by the honor that God
[1:21:26] has over the prayers of their mother who
[1:21:30] have long gone. The heavens of the
[1:21:33] heavens that God is going to prepare for
[1:21:35] us. Prophet Isaiah said is so that we
[1:21:38] and our offsprings will be there.
[1:21:43] Hallelujah. Glory. Can I offer you extra
[1:21:46] blessing on that? I'm just feeling good
[1:21:49] tonight. It's a night of encouragement.
[1:21:52] Let me offer you extra blessing on that.
[1:21:54] There was a
[1:21:56] sister who came to the prayer line.
[1:21:59] Amen. I can't remember if it's sister
[1:22:02] Shepherd or sister whatever it is. Amen.
[1:22:06] She was the last on the prayer line.
[1:22:09] Amen.
[1:22:10] And uh when she approached the prophet
[1:22:14] with the grandchildren,
[1:22:16] the prophet had a tough feeling of
[1:22:19] nostalgia to think about how they all
[1:22:22] started. He looked at that sister, he
[1:22:25] looked at himself. They all started as
[1:22:28] young people. Amen. Amen. Building a
[1:22:31] church, a kingdom for God.
[1:22:34] Amen. Amen. And seeing you know how life
[1:22:38] has transformed them.
[1:22:40] He was telling that sister, he said, "Do
[1:22:42] you remember how we all started in the
[1:22:45] beginning?" And he said, "By the grace
[1:22:47] of God, today our children came into the
[1:22:49] light and here you are bringing your
[1:22:52] grandchildren even to be prayed for." He
[1:22:56] said, "My sister, let me offer you a
[1:22:57] blessing."
[1:22:59] He said, "Do you know it is written in
[1:23:01] the Bible that thou and thy house shall
[1:23:04] be saved." Yes. Let me tell you more
[1:23:07] than any age that promise is our
[1:23:10] inheritance.
[1:23:13] And the prophet talked and talked and he
[1:23:16] said, "Sister, let me pray for you." And
[1:23:19] he started praying for those children.
[1:23:21] He said, "Oh God, may all that my sister
[1:23:24] love and may all that love her be given
[1:23:28] to her."
[1:23:31] Do you understand that prayer? Did you
[1:23:33] know it was only to the prophet the
[1:23:36] angel of the Lord gave that he said all
[1:23:39] that you love not that ever love you
[1:23:42] have been given to you. Then brother
[1:23:45] Brown extended the blessings of that
[1:23:49] prayer upon a sister in the church to
[1:23:52] portress what the scripture said thou
[1:23:55] and thy house shall be saved.
[1:23:58] [Applause]
[1:24:01] Sister, are you right? God's salvation
[1:24:03] of two boys. Is that right? That's the
[1:24:06] one we remember so much. But do you know
[1:24:09] by our own testimony, brother El Doubt
[1:24:11] in God's salvation of my 11 children?
[1:24:15] It's in the message.
[1:24:17] Don't look at me. Is there Brother was
[1:24:20] giving a testimony of that in the
[1:24:22] church. And brother in the minister of
[1:24:25] the gospel sat in the corner and he was
[1:24:28] saying, "Lord, how about my children?"
[1:24:30] Amen. Yes. And as the service was over,
[1:24:34] Amen. Brother Brown was leaving and then
[1:24:37] God told him, he said, "Go back and give
[1:24:40] Elant his children."
[1:24:43] And he went back also and said, "Eldant,
[1:24:47] receive your children." And the next
[1:24:49] service, a lot of them were baptized in
[1:24:53] the name of Jesus Christ. This is the
[1:24:56] blessing of the believers.
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:02] Don't give up on them.
[1:25:05] So the woman auntie Jamaima told the
[1:25:08] prophet and brother Abraham said I still
[1:25:11] don't understand. He said but I said
[1:25:14] auntie you pray first.
[1:25:17] And when auntie began to pray the
[1:25:20] prophet said you can tell that she's
[1:25:21] used to talking to God.
[1:25:25] She did it with all her heart. Get used
[1:25:28] to talking to God, my brother. Get used
[1:25:30] to talking to God, my sister, and do it
[1:25:33] with all your heart. God will come
[1:25:35] through for you.
[1:25:39] Amen. And when she finished, all the
[1:25:42] prophet did was to endorse our prayer.
[1:25:46] And you know what happened? The boy
[1:25:48] started coming back to life.
[1:25:51] And by the time the prophet looked at
[1:25:53] his time, it was about that 4 hours. He
[1:25:56] started running back to the airport and
[1:25:59] by the time he got to the airport they
[1:26:00] were making the final call. Mr. William
[1:26:05] and he was just on time to catch his
[1:26:08] light because the purpose for which God
[1:26:11] brought him was accomplished.
[1:26:18] So locating our identity is very
[1:26:20] powerful. Yes sir. It will bring you
[1:26:22] your blessings. So tonight may be an
[1:26:25] identity of some people I'm talking
[1:26:26] about Lazarus and the two sisters
[1:26:31] we are denominational believers I said
[1:26:35] but when they saw the message of their
[1:26:37] day it spark life in their hearts you
[1:26:41] might have been invited here tonight
[1:26:44] amen I want you to know that you
[1:26:46] accepting to come is not a coincidence
[1:26:49] and it's not a chance event has a
[1:26:52] purpose for
[1:26:54] So when the Lord talks your heart, make
[1:26:56] sure you respond.
[1:26:58] He said, "Do not hard in your heart."
[1:27:00] Yes. While it is gone today,
[1:27:06] when these folks came into the light,
[1:27:10] they were such a dedicated believer
[1:27:13] that if this is the truth, we will give
[1:27:16] our all to him.
[1:27:18] Amen. Friends,
[1:27:22] they brought Jesus Christ our Lord home.
[1:27:25] They accommodated the message of the
[1:27:28] hour.
[1:27:30] The prophet said the clothes, the
[1:27:32] garment of Jesus that the soldiers were
[1:27:34] parting among themselves were pres was
[1:27:37] presented by that family. That's right.
[1:27:39] So they fed the message. They clothed
[1:27:42] the message. They house the message.
[1:27:49] And those are the things you must do to
[1:27:50] your ministers
[1:27:52] if they carry the blessings of God to
[1:27:54] you. These people sold out to the
[1:27:57] message. But I tell you friends, amen.
[1:28:01] The reason Christ will be comfortable to
[1:28:03] live in their house
[1:28:06] was because they created the right
[1:28:09] environment.
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:14] Christ does not live in a place that is
[1:28:16] anyhow.
[1:28:18] He doesn't live in the place where there
[1:28:20] is trust. He live in a place where there
[1:28:23] is order. Where the brother has taken
[1:28:26] his position. His wife is in that
[1:28:29] position. The children are in their
[1:28:32] position. The own in order will attract
[1:28:36] the presence of Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:28:39] Amen.
[1:28:40] My brother, my sister, you have too much
[1:28:43] against you than to be against yourself.
[1:28:47] You will be so much against yourself. If
[1:28:49] your atmosphere is not conducive for
[1:28:52] Christ to live in your house, you are
[1:28:55] finished.
[1:28:58] Don't worry. Silently gently and we
[1:29:00] prove it to you tonight.
[1:29:02] You love him.
[1:29:04] and Christ living in their house was not
[1:29:08] a guest.
[1:29:12] That's right. The prophet said,
[1:29:14] "Wherever you put Christ is where he's
[1:29:16] going to stay."
[1:29:18] He doesn't force or fuse with you.
[1:29:21] But have a wisdom tonight.
[1:29:24] When I pray, I say, "Christ, I don't
[1:29:26] want you to be an unseen guest at every
[1:29:28] meal." Amen. I want you to be the
[1:29:30] householder. Amen.
[1:29:33] You know why? If he's the householder,
[1:29:35] he owns the key to the house. And if he
[1:29:38] owns the key to the door, he takes
[1:29:41] responsibility for whatever comes in or
[1:29:44] whatever goes out.
[1:29:46] The door is less for me.
[1:29:50] Are you here? Do you know why the
[1:29:53] prophet said the death that got Lazarus
[1:29:57] have been loitered around for a long
[1:29:59] time?
[1:30:02] That's right. But he couldn't get in
[1:30:05] because Christ is the householder.
[1:30:10] So anytime he knocks at the door, it
[1:30:13] isn't Lazarus that goes to open.
[1:30:15] Hallelujah. Lazarus became a tenant in
[1:30:17] his own house and Christ became the
[1:30:20] landlord. Hallelujah.
[1:30:22] So anytime Lazarus, you know, hear the
[1:30:25] knock and he wants to get up, he
[1:30:27] realizes that he has lost ownership.
[1:30:30] Amen. And sir, you have a guest. And
[1:30:34] Jesus will go to the door and open. And
[1:30:38] when Satan sees Jesus, he will say,
[1:30:39] "Sorry, wrong address."
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:45] As long as the presence of Christ is
[1:30:47] retained.
[1:30:49] Amen. There was no evil that could
[1:30:53] overtake that family.
[1:30:56] The boat where Christ is whether he's
[1:31:00] sleeping or awake is unsinkable.
[1:31:05] You cannot sink his boat.
[1:31:11] Get Christ in your house. Hallelujah.
[1:31:13] Get Christ even in your bodily temple.
[1:31:17] Get Christ in your heart and you will be
[1:31:20] saved. You will be secure. You will be
[1:31:23] protected.
[1:31:25] Amen.
[1:31:27] Amen. Is it very simple for us? It's a
[1:31:30] simple gospel tonight, isn't it? But you
[1:31:33] will find wisdom in it. Amen. All right.
[1:31:36] So, as long as Christ was there,
[1:31:40] that death that has been hanging around
[1:31:43] couldn't enter.
[1:31:48] But in God's divine providence,
[1:31:51] Christ was meant to live. Yes,
[1:31:55] because he's got programs.
[1:31:58] Amen.
[1:31:59] But his absence cannot do a collateral
[1:32:02] damage.
[1:32:04] If it was in furtherance of his program,
[1:32:07] but if it was your attitude that sent
[1:32:10] him back, expect collateral damage.
[1:32:13] That's right.
[1:32:16] That's right. You can see that inside
[1:32:18] church, outside church, it's a
[1:32:21] responsibility to live a life that is
[1:32:23] worthy of the gospel.
[1:32:26] It's a responsibility, my brother. It's
[1:32:29] a responsibility, my sister. This is no
[1:32:32] religion to us. It's our way of life.
[1:32:37] Hallelujah.
[1:32:40] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, we are coming to
[1:32:42] things that challenge your
[1:32:45] followership. M when Christ left,
[1:32:49] he left on missionary trip.
[1:32:54] Maybe he started with Peter Mary's book.
[1:32:58] The moment he arrived there, Lazarus
[1:33:01] took ill.
[1:33:03] Brother said when Christ leaves, Satan
[1:33:06] has a chance.
[1:33:08] Are you here?
[1:33:11] But this living of Christ was to bring a
[1:33:13] greater glory.
[1:33:15] So don't worry, nothing will be out of g
[1:33:18] even in the most hopeless situation.
[1:33:21] But here is it. It was in Peter
[1:33:24] Marisburg
[1:33:27] when Lazarus took
[1:33:30] here and a message was quickly sent to
[1:33:34] him. That message came like a connected
[1:33:38] intimate message. Lazarus your friend.
[1:33:42] Un lovers. Amen.
[1:33:46] They wrote it in a way to release the
[1:33:49] emotion of Christ so that he can do
[1:33:52] something about it.
[1:33:54] Lazarus your friend whom thou lost is
[1:33:57] sick.
[1:34:00] But then it was a great shock of their
[1:34:03] life. Amen.
[1:34:06] For Jesus not to respond. Amen. Instead
[1:34:10] of Lazarus, instead of Jesus coming
[1:34:12] back, it marries will be maybe about an
[1:34:15] hour or two from Dan, right? Hour hour.
[1:34:19] Instead of coming back, he continued
[1:34:21] forward.
[1:34:24] The next time they heard of him, he was
[1:34:25] in Ptoria.
[1:34:28] And the further he went, the worst
[1:34:30] Lazarus got. Yes.
[1:34:35] The next time he was in Jo, the next
[1:34:37] time he's got into Botswana, Gabboron.
[1:34:42] Amen.
[1:34:43] By the time the condition of Lazarus
[1:34:46] went into ICU, he was in West Africa,
[1:34:49] Nigeria preaching for us.
[1:34:52] [Applause]
[1:34:57] Hallelujah. He was so far away. Amen.
[1:35:02] Now,
[1:35:03] this is your test of followership.
[1:35:06] Amen.
[1:35:08] Because this action of Jesus Christ,
[1:35:12] the prophet said attracted opposition.
[1:35:15] Amen. That's right. And you've got to
[1:35:17] know where you are standing. Yes sir. In
[1:35:20] times like this
[1:35:26] it attracted opposition so much that the
[1:35:29] whole church denomination that they came
[1:35:31] out from took an advantage.
[1:35:35] That's what the review world says to
[1:35:38] come and show some love but it was a
[1:35:40] malicious love.
[1:35:43] Sure.
[1:35:45] It wasn't a love intended with purity.
[1:35:48] Sure. It was a love intended in showing
[1:35:51] how bad Christ is and how good they are.
[1:35:55] That is a malicious love.
[1:35:58] But it's okay. Christ will fix it.
[1:36:00] Hallelujah.
[1:36:03] Have you called your pastor? We have
[1:36:06] called him. How many messages did you
[1:36:08] send? In fact, our emails are full.
[1:36:12] Uhhuh. So, where is he? What is he
[1:36:14] doing? We can't say exactly. You told us
[1:36:17] it was a bit spot the other day. Yes.
[1:36:20] Where is he now? He's in
[1:36:22] Nigeria. Not even in south. He crossed
[1:36:25] the south to the east central and landed
[1:36:29] in the west of Africa.
[1:36:32] This is serious. Oh,
[1:36:35] we told you in the beginning, oh my,
[1:36:39] that you be careful of these latter day
[1:36:41] pastors.
[1:36:44] Could you ever imagine our priest
[1:36:47] abandoning any of us in times like this?
[1:36:52] It's not possible. It has never been
[1:36:54] done and it will never happen. Amen. So
[1:36:56] what do you say to this that your pastor
[1:36:59] has done? Do you know they had no answer
[1:37:02] truly. That's right. Let me tell you
[1:37:04] church tonight, look at me. God will put
[1:37:06] you in circumstances that will make it
[1:37:09] difficult for you to defend him. Yes.
[1:37:12] Amen.
[1:37:14] That's right.
[1:37:17] It's a life reality.
[1:37:20] So if your Christianity is give and
[1:37:22] take, you ain't going to last in the
[1:37:25] church.
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:30] If your Christianity is bread and water,
[1:37:34] amen. The type that needs constant
[1:37:36] maintenance that hasn't entered the
[1:37:39] holiest of the holies where the world is
[1:37:41] shut out and he lived by a constant glow
[1:37:45] of supernatural life. You won't make it,
[1:37:48] brother. You won't make it, sister. Let
[1:37:52] me repeat. Because Christ will put you
[1:37:54] on the spot.
[1:37:55] in a situation that defending in will be
[1:37:58] practically impossible in the face of
[1:38:01] clear evidence.
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:09] Amen. This is why your followership of
[1:38:12] Christ must have an anchor.
[1:38:16] Did you hear me?
[1:38:19] So beyond every revelation you go get,
[1:38:22] get this capstone revelation. Yes. That
[1:38:24] no matter what happened, whether I can
[1:38:27] explain it or not, get it as a
[1:38:30] revelation that Christ cannot be wrong.
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:39] Whatever it does, he is never wrong. I
[1:38:43] may not be able to explain. I may not
[1:38:46] even be able to defend. But I know he's
[1:38:48] not wrong.
[1:38:50] And time will tell it. Can we prove it
[1:38:54] that he is not wrong?
[1:38:58] Let there be a revelation in your heart.
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:07] When the Lord said accept you into my
[1:39:09] flesh and you drinking my blood, no
[1:39:12] life, no explanation. Did he explain? He
[1:39:17] never explained.
[1:39:19] Were some people offended or not? They
[1:39:21] were. Yes. Majority were offended and
[1:39:24] they left. Yes. And the Lord thought
[1:39:27] that all had gone. When they turned
[1:39:29] back, he saw 11 + one standing. He said,
[1:39:32] "What are you waiting for? Would you
[1:39:34] also go?" And Peter said, "Sir, to whom
[1:39:38] shall we go?"
[1:39:41] Wait a minute. Peter responded like
[1:39:44] that, not because he understood.
[1:39:49] Did you catch that? Yes sir. But because
[1:39:52] he knew that whatever he says whether we
[1:39:56] understand it or we don't understand it
[1:40:00] cannot be wrong.
[1:40:09] Things will happen in your life
[1:40:13] that will create an occasion for people
[1:40:16] to speak blasphemously.
[1:40:19] Just keep quiet.
[1:40:21] Just hold on. Thank you, Lord. The
[1:40:24] strength of Israel can never lie.
[1:40:27] Hallelujah. Never be wrong. He knows
[1:40:30] what he's doing. He will come true for
[1:40:33] you.
[1:40:36] Hallelujah.
[1:40:41] The Lord. It was such a great revival
[1:40:44] for the opposition. Amen. The prophet
[1:40:47] said they had a great day to show how
[1:40:50] bad Christ was and how good the old kind
[1:40:53] priest was. They even took them through
[1:40:56] memory lane to show the goodness of the
[1:40:59] priest to their parents before they were
[1:41:03] married. After they were married, before
[1:41:05] they gave birth to these children, after
[1:41:07] they gave birth to Lazarus and the
[1:41:09] sisters. Yes. Hallelujah. Amen. When the
[1:41:12] devil is doing that, what is he doing?
[1:41:14] is to fight with your emotions.
[1:41:17] He's trying to crush you emotionally.
[1:41:21] Listen to me.
[1:41:24] The devil knows
[1:41:26] that as long as you are in God's
[1:41:29] presence,
[1:41:31] as long as you are in God's hands, as
[1:41:34] long as you are in his environment,
[1:41:36] he can never tamper with you.
[1:41:39] Hallelujah.
[1:41:40] Even if he's throwing afflictions, he's
[1:41:43] throwing challenges across your path, as
[1:41:46] long as he cannot isolate you from the
[1:41:49] commonwealth of Christ, the devil knows
[1:41:52] in himself is already a failure.
[1:41:58] That is why you must not allow him to
[1:42:01] put you in a complex. Yes. Yes.
[1:42:06] I hope I'm speaking to a soul tonight.
[1:42:09] When the devil wants to tamp up with
[1:42:11] your life, he start giving you ideas
[1:42:14] that you know the problem you are having
[1:42:16] is so peculiar
[1:42:19] is a specially designed package
[1:42:22] challenge that nobody has suffered like
[1:42:25] that or has ever had such an experience
[1:42:27] like that in the other in this life.
[1:42:32] Let me tell you something how to deal
[1:42:34] with the devil first. The Bible said
[1:42:36] when he opens his mouth Amen.
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:45] Li another lie lie lie.
[1:42:51] Hallelujah. Don't ever accept his
[1:42:53] proposal.
[1:42:55] The Bible said when he open his mouth,
[1:42:58] he's lying.
[1:43:00] There is no truth in him. He likes to
[1:43:03] associate with light, but he is
[1:43:06] darkness. He lies with the truth. For
[1:43:10] he's lying liar, a father of liars.
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:15] [Applause]
[1:43:17] Do you know why he's doing that? He's
[1:43:20] doing that to buy your attention,
[1:43:23] to steal your emotion so that you can
[1:43:25] develop complex against your power base.
[1:43:29] Satan knew it assured me. If he can't
[1:43:32] get you out of God's presence, he cannot
[1:43:34] defeat you. no matter what it brings
[1:43:37] your way.
[1:43:41] So don't ever allow him to make you have
[1:43:44] problem with your power socket.
[1:43:49] Don't let him break your connection.
[1:43:51] When he tried Job and he wasn't getting
[1:43:54] through, he became frustrated. He came
[1:43:57] to use the body of his wife and speak.
[1:44:00] Job knew that wasn't his wife speaking.
[1:44:04] He knew it.
[1:44:06] He was hearing the voice of his life but
[1:44:08] the words of Satan
[1:44:12] and that's the frustration of the devil
[1:44:15] because his deal with God is that you
[1:44:18] know what I will make him c you through
[1:44:20] your face then the wife said why don't
[1:44:22] you c go and die
[1:44:27] let's examine the lie you see why Paul
[1:44:30] told the church he said there is no
[1:44:32] problem that happens to you that is
[1:44:33] uncommon Yes. Yes. Amen. You see why he
[1:44:37] told it. Now that will sound like a
[1:44:39] callous insensitive statement, but those
[1:44:42] are the statements that will jolt you
[1:44:44] out of self-pity. Yes. Amen. Because the
[1:44:48] tool of the devil is self-pity.
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:52] He wants you to be in the pity party.
[1:44:56] Then you begin to sing, why me, Lord?
[1:45:01] If not you, who should it be?
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:07] Do you know if God allows anything to
[1:45:09] come your way, it's because you have his
[1:45:11] approval.
[1:45:16] Listen to me.
[1:45:19] The Bible said when the sons of God
[1:45:22] presented themselves, you know what that
[1:45:24] means? They came to church. We are
[1:45:26] presenting ourselves with the presence
[1:45:29] of God. The problem of Job came from the
[1:45:32] church.
[1:45:33] Uh-huh. Sure.
[1:45:37] And you know what was happening? God
[1:45:39] was, you know, God looked at the
[1:45:42] congregation. Uh, he said, "Mr. Satan,
[1:45:45] you are here."
[1:45:48] You don't believe he's here tonight. And
[1:45:50] you have to believe the scripture. You
[1:45:52] have to rise up again. He said, "We
[1:45:54] don't want him here." Who told you he'll
[1:45:56] be here?
[1:45:58] He's here tonight. Yes. The only thing
[1:46:01] you must do is to put him in the chain
[1:46:04] of circumstance.
[1:46:06] The chain of circumstance is a condition
[1:46:10] that makes him unable to operate.
[1:46:14] That's what the prophet explained for
[1:46:15] us. Put him in a condition where he's
[1:46:19] not able to operate. Whether in our
[1:46:22] midst or in your heart, when you stay
[1:46:25] together, when you deny the devil and
[1:46:28] you accept the word is coming there will
[1:46:31] be a waste of time.
[1:46:34] Hallelujah.
[1:46:36] But since the beginning, he's been
[1:46:38] attending service. Yes. If the service
[1:46:41] goes well, it's because we put him in a
[1:46:43] condition where he cannot operate.
[1:46:46] Because it's in the Bible that God
[1:46:49] identified him when the sons of God,
[1:46:52] hallelujah, presented themselves in the
[1:46:54] presence of God. When the children of
[1:46:57] God came for service,
[1:46:59] he said, "Where are you? Where are you
[1:47:01] coming from?" He said, "To and the
[1:47:03] wicked has no peace."
[1:47:07] Said, "Have you considered my servant?"
[1:47:10] It was God himself that put Job on the
[1:47:13] spot.
[1:47:15] Baby tonight you say, "Have you
[1:47:17] considered my daughter Jesus?" You don't
[1:47:20] want Don't be afraid. If God single you
[1:47:24] out is because he has put what it takes
[1:47:26] in
[1:47:27] you that situation.
[1:47:30] He wants to make you a testimony. He
[1:47:33] wants to make you a prayer point.
[1:47:36] He wants to make you an encouragement, a
[1:47:38] positive influence for somebody who can
[1:47:41] be in the
[1:47:42] situation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Some
[1:47:46] things are just opening up for me. Let
[1:47:48] me enjoy my liberty. Hallelujah. You
[1:47:50] know brother said he says sometimes God
[1:47:53] can allow you to go through a situation
[1:47:55] or even a sickness not for yourself. He
[1:47:59] said it's so that you might become the
[1:48:01] captain for the salvation of another
[1:48:04] person.
[1:48:06] Listen to your testimony.
[1:48:08] One day a sister with a cancer came to
[1:48:12] the prayer line and the prophet told her
[1:48:15] you don't need my hand you need the hand
[1:48:18] of that sister who is by the piano he
[1:48:21] said because she went through the same
[1:48:22] thing and she was healed of it now go to
[1:48:25] her right was standing and the sister
[1:48:29] went to her and the sister laid out and
[1:48:32] the cancer
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:35] disappeared she was getting
[1:48:37] in order to be a blessing for this other
[1:48:40] one. So don't be afraid.
[1:48:44] God put you on the spot is because he
[1:48:47] want to single you out for a blessing.
[1:48:59] So here we have a family
[1:49:02] that seem to be praying and prayer
[1:49:05] wasn't answered. That is another way to
[1:49:08] look at it. The more they pray for their
[1:49:10] brother Lazarus, the more it got worse.
[1:49:14] It was as if God wasn't minding them.
[1:49:19] And how do you explain that? How few
[1:49:22] different defend God
[1:49:25] but they get faith. Yes. You must keep
[1:49:28] faith. When the devil brings all those
[1:49:31] tough tough thoughts, you say, "I'm a
[1:49:34] deep thinker." Stop deep thinking.
[1:49:43] Move your
[1:49:44] [Applause]
[1:49:46] mind. That
[1:49:48] is take over your mind.
[1:49:51] Stop convicted.
[1:49:56] Hallelujah. You know if you accept the
[1:50:00] lie of the devil that you are the
[1:50:03] peculiar person for peculiar challenge
[1:50:05] and problem.
[1:50:07] The devil has one. That's right. But
[1:50:10] that's not where he's going. But before
[1:50:12] you accept that light, let me ask you a
[1:50:14] question. in the neighborhood where you
[1:50:17] are living. How many homes have you
[1:50:20] entered?
[1:50:22] I'm starting from your neighborhood. I'm
[1:50:24] not saying the whole of your I'm not
[1:50:25] saying South Africa. I'm saying your
[1:50:28] neighborhood like somebody who is living
[1:50:30] in Phoenix here at this clay cent even
[1:50:34] crescent. How many homes have you
[1:50:36] entered?
[1:50:39] Do you know there's a probability that
[1:50:41] there are many people in those homes you
[1:50:44] are looking at who haven't seen son for
[1:50:46] 12 years in their life they've been paid
[1:50:48] the reading that's right yes sir then
[1:50:51] when we look at the whole of Phoenix
[1:50:53] when we move to do and come to South
[1:50:55] Africa how many of such people do we
[1:50:58] have the oldest of people have their leg
[1:51:00] hang that's right for years yes
[1:51:05] still waiting for recovery Amen. Some
[1:51:08] have been coma for 2 years. They've
[1:51:11] knocked on their side and they cannot
[1:51:13] give them all because symptoms, signs of
[1:51:16] life are still there. You don't know
[1:51:19] those things. That's right. But the
[1:51:20] devil will come to you. You are the only
[1:51:22] one.
[1:51:24] You see how much a liar?
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:26] [Applause]
[1:51:30] How many stop accepting his life from
[1:51:32] tonight?
[1:51:35] You say it's afflicting my thoughts. Why
[1:51:36] should you give me your thought?
[1:51:40] Why?
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] Why would you like your oppressor?
[1:51:47] Come to the Savior tonight.
[1:51:50] Do you know all he's doing? All he's
[1:51:52] doing is to build a complex in you.
[1:51:55] Because if you accept that God single
[1:51:58] you out for a peculiar problem, it will
[1:52:02] be easy for you to also accept that God
[1:52:05] must be peculiarly and personally mean
[1:52:07] to you.
[1:52:10] Are you catching it? Then if you accept
[1:52:12] that God is personally mean to you,
[1:52:14] something will be telling you of what
[1:52:17] you is mean serving a God.
[1:52:20] Who would be that mean to me? Am I the
[1:52:22] only offender? Am I the only sinner on
[1:52:25] the earth?
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:28] Satan is winning. Do you know what he's
[1:52:31] trying to do? He wants to pluck
[1:52:33] fellowship away from you. He wants to
[1:52:36] take prayer away from you. He wants to
[1:52:38] take the word away from you. Because
[1:52:41] gradually you start feeling like if God
[1:52:44] will be that mean to me, why should I
[1:52:46] listen to him? Then you stop reading the
[1:52:48] Bible. You stop reading the spoken word.
[1:52:51] They stop coming to service. Why should
[1:52:54] I even talk to him? Then you stop
[1:52:56] praying and this is all it takes to
[1:52:59] isolate you.
[1:53:04] In your home body, they said it takes a
[1:53:07] black sleeping cell. Yes. To create
[1:53:09] problem for the entire body. If the
[1:53:12] cells are together, they form a tissue.
[1:53:15] And when they form a tissue, they stand
[1:53:16] strong as an army to challenge any
[1:53:19] invader. That is why when an invader
[1:53:22] come to your body that's demonology now
[1:53:24] he's not looking for tissue he's looking
[1:53:27] for a cell that has vaccinated meaning
[1:53:29] that have broken off from the rest of
[1:53:31] the because he knows that as long as
[1:53:34] that cell is alone it's easy to invade
[1:53:37] the body it will just attack that one
[1:53:39] cell and from that one cell it will
[1:53:42] start his own life to destroy your
[1:53:44] entire body that is what the devil is
[1:53:46] doing to you when he's trying to isolate
[1:53:50] in God's presence.
[1:53:53] Amenus.
[1:53:55] When you take a coal of fire from a
[1:53:58] bunch of cones of fire, the moment you
[1:54:01] take it, you killed it.
[1:54:03] But it will still carry some fire for a
[1:54:05] while. Hallelujah. But that fire will
[1:54:08] never be rekindled, will never be
[1:54:10] charged, will never be supported. It is
[1:54:13] extinguishing
[1:54:15] gradually it will fade away. This is why
[1:54:18] the prophet said you can't be as good as
[1:54:20] a Christian ought to be if you don't
[1:54:23] come to church because this world is not
[1:54:26] a friend to grace. They will give all
[1:54:29] the little light you have. This is why
[1:54:31] you must have God's presence to get a
[1:54:34] recharge.
[1:54:36] Whatever happened, don't leave the
[1:54:39] presence of God.
[1:54:49] So all this woman and attention they
[1:54:52] were bringing to that family was just to
[1:54:55] get them out of the message
[1:54:57] to make them doubt the message and
[1:55:00] embrace the old ways.
[1:55:02] But I tell you they met a wrong company.
[1:55:06] Yes. So where is pastor now?
[1:55:10] Pastor has even left Nigeria now. is in
[1:55:13] EJ.
[1:55:16] Ah, and you see the northern part of the
[1:55:19] country is close to Europe. 5 hours you
[1:55:22] are in London. So after a while is
[1:55:25] already in London. So that's like 12
[1:55:27] hours flight back to South Africa.
[1:55:33] So what must we do now? In their
[1:55:37] eyes, brother Lazarus
[1:55:40] died. Amen.
[1:55:43] And the oppositions at the field day. We
[1:55:46] told them
[1:55:48] this is the reward of disobedient. We
[1:55:51] told them on this day things message
[1:55:54] message message. See where it ended.
[1:55:58] Okay. Will you please call him to
[1:56:00] arrange the funeral? Jesus was so far
[1:56:03] away until he couldn't make the funeral
[1:56:06] of his own church member.
[1:56:08] Sure. Amen. It's in your Bible. Did he
[1:56:11] attend the funeral?
[1:56:13] He didn't attend the funeral.
[1:56:16] Maybe the old priest buried Lazarus.
[1:56:22] Ah, by the time Jesus arrived, he
[1:56:27] arrived 4 days after burial.
[1:56:31] Amen. Or four days since he was dead.
[1:56:36] Now hear what Jesus said for you to know
[1:56:39] what he did was intentional.
[1:56:42] He told the brethren he said Lazarus our
[1:56:45] friend is sleeping. The disciples said
[1:56:48] let's go and wake him. Some of them
[1:56:50] already said what kind of sleep I've
[1:56:52] told brother Lazarus he shouldn't be
[1:56:54] sleeping to create panic. I don't know
[1:56:56] why we sleep too sir. What's wrong with
[1:56:58] this brother? Honestly speaking, when we
[1:57:00] get back, master, just give me this
[1:57:02] chance. I'm going to really slap the
[1:57:05] back. I will slap him from that sleep.
[1:57:11] Jesus realized they didn't understand.
[1:57:13] You know, he's a man that switches
[1:57:15] between two dimensions. Do you realize
[1:57:17] that? He said the son of man is with
[1:57:19] them and at the same time is in heaven.
[1:57:22] So sometime he speaks heavenly language
[1:57:25] because in heaven nobody dies. You see
[1:57:28] the language of he is speak when he
[1:57:30] realized he didn't understand let me
[1:57:32] come to your level our brother friend is
[1:57:35] dead let us not die with him
[1:57:40] Jesus said he said for your sakes it was
[1:57:44] good I was not there
[1:57:47] so everything our Lord did was
[1:57:49] intentional
[1:57:51] hallelujah do you hear me so it was not
[1:57:55] a mistake It was not an omission. It was
[1:58:00] deliberate.
[1:58:03] And he will do some deliberate things in
[1:58:05] your life.
[1:58:09] Sometimes people will say so that we
[1:58:11] don't create offense. I said come, you
[1:58:13] can only do your best.
[1:58:16] Christ himself is a rock of offense.
[1:58:19] Yes. The message of the hour is a tool
[1:58:22] of offense. Yes. But Christ said,
[1:58:25] "Blessed are those who have not offended
[1:58:28] him." No matter how big the offense is,
[1:58:32] no matter how offensive Christ is, there
[1:58:35] is a generation that will still not be
[1:58:38] offended. Hallelujah. Because they are
[1:58:41] connected supernaturally.
[1:58:48] Was it not offensive for a people who
[1:58:51] stood for God? Even in the Old
[1:58:54] Testament, they said they esteemed the
[1:58:56] reproach of Christ's greater riches to
[1:58:58] be thrown into the fire. Was it not an
[1:59:00] offense?
[1:59:04] If you didn't know how the story ended,
[1:59:07] if you were there the day Shepherd, Me
[1:59:09] and Abednego were being thrown into the
[1:59:11] fire, what would be your attitude?
[1:59:14] God, why?
[1:59:16] These people stood for you and you are
[1:59:19] allowing this
[1:59:23] When you have that, remember what he
[1:59:26] said.
[1:59:29] They said, "King, don't give us two or
[1:59:31] three chances anymore." Because if you
[1:59:33] give us 10 chances, the result will be
[1:59:35] the same and the result is that we will
[1:59:38] not bow down. But let's tell you one
[1:59:40] thing. We know our God
[1:59:44] can deliver us. Once they know his
[1:59:47] ability,
[1:59:48] you must know his ability. Hallelujah.
[1:59:52] [Applause]
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:54] Are you with me? But watch what they
[1:59:56] said again. We know he can. But if he
[2:00:00] chooses to do, if he chooses not to do
[2:00:03] what he can do,
[2:00:07] they know what he can do. They also have
[2:00:10] the revelation of his sovereignty. Yes.
[2:00:13] That it is not everything he can do that
[2:00:16] he does.
[2:00:19] Do you believe God like that?
[2:00:21] Even though we know he can, but if he
[2:00:24] chooses not to, yet we will not bow
[2:00:27] down.
[2:00:29] Hallelujah. That is a Christian.
[2:00:31] Hallelujah.
[2:00:32] That was
[2:00:34] why separate us.
[2:00:40] Bless
[2:00:42] my brother, my sister, you are planning
[2:00:44] to spend eternity with those folks.
[2:00:45] Amen.
[2:00:49] Your stature cannot be less than that.
[2:00:55] That's right. Is that for your sakes? I
[2:00:58] was glad I was not there. You know, if I
[2:01:01] was there and Lazarus was sick, they
[2:01:03] will say no. He pretended in order to
[2:01:07] promote the image of Christ. He wasn't
[2:01:10] actually sick. So if you say he was sick
[2:01:12] and he prayed and he get
[2:01:17] If a man died while he was there, they
[2:01:19] said he fainted or he pretended he
[2:01:21] didn't actually die. They are trying to
[2:01:23] launder the image of Jesus. So he
[2:01:26] allowed it. They were the one who
[2:01:29] attended to him when he was sick. They
[2:01:31] were the one who buried him when he was
[2:01:34] dead.
[2:01:36] [Music]
[2:01:38] But he told the disciples that you might
[2:01:40] know the son of man has power over life
[2:01:43] and death. He said, "Let us go and wake
[2:01:45] him up."
[2:01:47] Jesus knew what he was coming to do. It
[2:01:50] wasn't a probability. Lazarus will get
[2:01:53] up whether the devil likes him or not.
[2:01:59] That was his recon mission. He said,
[2:02:01] "Let's go and wake him up."
[2:02:04] Amen.
[2:02:06] And here,
[2:02:08] Jesus was coming. And as they heard the
[2:02:11] news of his
[2:02:13] approach, remember the audience were
[2:02:16] divers. The believers were there. The
[2:02:19] skeptics were there.
[2:02:23] As they heard the news of his coming,
[2:02:25] some were saying, "What was he coming to
[2:02:27] do?
[2:02:29] Is it to eat his flesh?"
[2:02:31] After all, I said, "Except you to eat my
[2:02:33] flesh, you drink my blood." Is it
[2:02:35] cannibalist?
[2:02:37] Joseph was still believe that today. M
[2:02:40] Joseph was the historian.
[2:02:43] He said the communion being eaten is the
[2:02:45] body of Christ that the disciples kept
[2:02:47] and we are cutting small snow. That body
[2:02:50] must be a giant of giants to still have
[2:02:53] remained till now. Amen. Amen. Good. So
[2:02:58] you can imagine the kind of audience
[2:03:00] they met and they were saying let's see
[2:03:02] what he will do. And oh how nearly we
[2:03:06] deal with this man today. Don't beat
[2:03:08] him. When matters start dealing with
[2:03:10] don't beat him. Hallelujah. They were
[2:03:12] convincing themselves.
[2:03:15] But when Jesus arrived, hallelujah.
[2:03:18] Amen. The news of his arrival sprang new
[2:03:22] faith.
[2:03:24] In the heart of the believer.
[2:03:26] Hallelujah. The Bible said matter cut
[2:03:28] off. Hallelujah. And ran towards him and
[2:03:33] said, "Master,
[2:03:34] welcome past. If you have been here,
[2:03:40] what is death? What is sickness? In
[2:03:44] other words, she testified to the power
[2:03:48] of God's presence. If you have been
[2:03:50] here, my brother will not have died.
[2:03:56] Oh, when those old church heads that
[2:04:00] they said, now this one has been
[2:04:02] brainwashed.
[2:04:04] Jesus has hypnotized them upon all the
[2:04:06] preparation we made to get them to
[2:04:10] attack this man. and they were
[2:04:11] complimenting him
[2:04:16] and Jesus hearing
[2:04:18] that it's a case of despite all
[2:04:23] yes you can still compliment my presence
[2:04:26] okay your brother will rise again
[2:04:30] hallelujah
[2:04:32] are you here all that the winters of
[2:04:35] life have frozen in your life they must
[2:04:38] rise again
[2:04:40] they must be quickened again.
[2:04:45] Your brother will rise again. Yes. Yes.
[2:04:49] You know before you left you taught us
[2:04:51] on resurrection rapture. So I know on
[2:04:54] that great day, that great day, that
[2:04:57] great day that is coming, I shall see my
[2:05:00] brother Jesus said matter you are not
[2:05:02] getting it.
[2:05:04] The one who will bring that great day is
[2:05:08] stand. Hallelujah.
[2:05:14] It's like telling that man who was by
[2:05:17] the pool of Bethesda, the one who sent
[2:05:19] the angel to trouble the waters, he's by
[2:05:22] your side. He say, I have no man to
[2:05:25] throw me inside. You don't need that
[2:05:28] again because the one who does it is
[2:05:31] with you. The question is simple. Will
[2:05:34] thou be?
[2:05:39] Amen. Hallelujah. Matter. I am that
[2:05:42] resurrection. Hallelujah. I am that
[2:05:44] life. Whosoever believeth on me. Even
[2:05:48] though you are dead, yet shall he live.
[2:05:51] And the one that is alive shall never
[2:05:54] die.
[2:05:58] When the
[2:05:59] skeptics were watching that
[2:06:01] conversation, it was too much for them.
[2:06:04] They said matter and her sister they are
[2:06:07] beyond both. You will still compliment a
[2:06:10] man who has done such a meanness in
[2:06:13] neglecting you when it matter most in
[2:06:15] your life. Woe to the pastor that
[2:06:18] neglect their congregation when it
[2:06:20] matter most. They were still saying
[2:06:22] that. Yes.
[2:06:25] But m will not listen to that. And the
[2:06:28] conversation grew on. He said believe
[2:06:31] this. Amen. He said, "Master, I
[2:06:33] believe." Then she went inside to pass
[2:06:36] the message to the sister, and the
[2:06:39] message brought the sister and the
[2:06:41] sister confessed the same thing. Meaning
[2:06:44] that they were united. Hallelujah.
[2:06:48] In their conviction about Christ.
[2:06:52] No matter what happened, don't ever be
[2:06:54] negative. Yes, that's right. Always be
[2:06:57] positive. Hallelujah. Don't allow
[2:06:59] anything to take the praise of the
[2:07:02] redeemer from your knees. Hallelujah.
[2:07:06] You may not be able to explain it but
[2:07:10] believe us. Hallelujah. Confess Christ.
[2:07:12] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:07:15] How many will start doing that?
[2:07:16] Hallelujah. He said though
[2:07:20] yet.
[2:07:21] If a situation present itself and it
[2:07:24] comes so difficult for you to defend
[2:07:27] right, say my Lord is still good.
[2:07:30] I know it will come through for me.
[2:07:33] [Applause]
[2:07:36] Lord, because you go through things in
[2:07:38] life, Amen. that really challenges your
[2:07:40] foundation. But let me tell you, you
[2:07:43] cannot be moved as long as you are in
[2:07:46] Christ.
[2:07:50] Hallelujah. When they found agreement
[2:07:52] with these believers, he said, "Where
[2:07:54] did you leave?"
[2:07:57] Said, "Master, where will we there?"
[2:08:01] The Bible said he went there. He went
[2:08:04] there. When they got there, he said,
[2:08:08] "Roll away the stone."
[2:08:12] That is one thing he will not do for
[2:08:13] you. Yes. He was not the one that put it
[2:08:16] there. You put it there. Roll it away.
[2:08:21] Tonight for whatever you are trusting
[2:08:23] God for roll away your doubt.
[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:28] Amen. This world must be raising your
[2:08:31] faith enough to say there's a
[2:08:33] possibility.
[2:08:35] You don't have a right to give up on any
[2:08:38] matter because cases that are hopeless
[2:08:42] still found remedy. Yes. In God.
[2:08:45] Hallelujah.
[2:08:48] Lazarus
[2:08:49] was not only dead.
[2:08:52] He was already corrupted.
[2:08:56] The most hopeless case.
[2:09:00] But Jesus has come. Hallelujah. When
[2:09:03] Jesus come, the tempter's power is
[2:09:06] broken.
[2:09:08] When Jesus comes, wipe away your tears
[2:09:11] tonight.
[2:09:12] He wipes away the tears. He takes the
[2:09:15] gloom away. Everything is going to
[2:09:18] change when Jesus come to save. No
[2:09:22] matter how dark it gets, don't forget it
[2:09:25] gets the darkest just before the day.
[2:09:29] Your age might have brought you here.
[2:09:31] And you might be in a position to say,
[2:09:33] "I'm giving up. It's getting the darkest
[2:09:35] for you." I want to tell you tonight,
[2:09:38] Jesus is not coming here.
[2:09:40] [Applause]
[2:09:41] Jesus has come tonight and we break a
[2:09:45] temper
[2:09:48] power here tonight for a purpose.
[2:09:52] Allow him a
[2:09:54] chance
[2:09:56] never believe.
[2:10:09] So roll away the stone tonight. If
[2:10:12] something tells you it's not possible,
[2:10:14] tell yourself tonight it's possible.
[2:10:18] Tell your soul tonight, my soul, don't
[2:10:19] worry. The Lord is ready to make a way.
[2:10:23] I am ready to receive it. Be on the
[2:10:26] Lord's side. Hallelujah. Be on the
[2:10:28] Lord's side. Hallelujah. Go away of
[2:10:31] doubt tonight. Go a
[2:10:36] find new faith.
[2:10:37] Can you get new strength? Begin to tell
[2:10:41] yourself, I can I will
[2:10:45] [Applause]
[2:10:51] never lie. Hallelujah. You must take
[2:10:54] something home tonight.
[2:10:57] Hallelujah. Bless the Lord. M turn to
[2:11:00] Christ.
[2:11:02] Pastor 1 2 3 4 96 hours is think by now.
[2:11:08] Jesus said m why are you reversing?
[2:11:12] Didn't you tell me you believe?
[2:11:15] Is there anything too hard for me?
[2:11:17] Hallelujah. I can stinkiness to sweet
[2:11:20] smell. Yeshu
[2:11:23] I can turn death to life. I can turn
[2:11:27] sorrow to joy. Don't doubt me.
[2:11:31] Trust me, matter. M here tonight.
[2:11:41] Trust me tonight, Hallelujah. Amen. Do
[2:11:44] you know why I'm asking you to trust me?
[2:11:47] When a son of God, Amen. puts the words
[2:11:50] of God, Hallelujah, in his mouth, Amen.
[2:11:53] and expresses it in purity. It is the
[2:11:57] same thing that
[2:12:03] they said. Hallelujah. Jesus said you
[2:12:06] believe in God. Hallelujah. I said
[2:12:08] believe also in me.
[2:12:10] You began the prophet. I said believe in
[2:12:13] me.
[2:12:16] [Applause]
[2:12:26] Preaching history.
[2:12:29] [Applause]
[2:12:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:49] [Applause]
[2:12:53] And you know what? Roll it away. Mary
[2:12:58] roll it away. Hallelujah. And you are
[2:13:00] rolling it away because there's a
[2:13:02] possibility.
[2:13:05] Not any rivers.
[2:13:08] You can't come through, not any mountain
[2:13:12] that you are not trying. I present you
[2:13:14] with a Christ.
[2:13:20] [Applause]
[2:13:31] history.
[2:13:34] [Applause]
[2:13:44] I stand as a servant for your condition.
[2:13:58] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:04] [Applause]
[2:14:09] I'm
[2:14:14] sorry. And the savior
[2:14:18] tonight is your blessing.
[2:14:22] Hallelujah.
[2:14:25] Hallelujah.
[2:14:34] when
[2:14:37] because Christ was determined
[2:14:39] to raise Lazarus. Hallelujah. He's
[2:14:42] determined to bless you tonight.
[2:14:46] Don't change yourself.
[2:14:49] He told the disciples before they got
[2:14:52] there that the mission is one. We are
[2:14:55] going to win Lazarus.
[2:14:57] So whether unbelievers like it or not,
[2:15:02] [Applause]
[2:15:04] nothing can change it. And tonight you
[2:15:08] will rise
[2:15:11] [Applause]
[2:15:19] up
[2:15:21] [Applause]
[2:15:23] in the Amen.
[2:15:39] Jesus know
[2:15:42] listen to me. Jesus know
[2:15:46] that if unbelief is too deep, you will
[2:15:49] not be able to do anything. In those you
[2:15:52] must change the atmosphere.
[2:15:55] to me because he was determined. He
[2:15:58] knows he must change without
[2:16:01] that is why you hear the prophet to say
[2:16:04] sometimes if you believe it stay if you
[2:16:08] don't believe it you can go away. He
[2:16:11] said, "Whatever instruction I give, you
[2:16:13] must obey." He said, "Because when this
[2:16:16] spirit leads, they go from one to
[2:16:18] another." Amen. One day, God was
[2:16:21] determined to heal a young man. And one
[2:16:24] man was misbehaving and they were
[2:16:27] telling him to bow his head. He said,
[2:16:29] "This is a public place. You can't tell
[2:16:31] me what to do. I have my liberty."
[2:16:34] Brother Brown was trying to pray. He
[2:16:36] wasn't breaking through. Then he said,
[2:16:38] "Lord, why would you allow the unruly
[2:16:42] behavior of a man to hinder the healing
[2:16:45] of this little boy whose parents are
[2:16:47] interceding for?" He said, "No." He
[2:16:50] said, "By this I take authority over
[2:16:53] every spirit.
[2:16:56] [Applause]
[2:17:05] Hallelujah.
[2:17:07] [Applause]
[2:17:16] [Music]
[2:17:17] [Applause]
[2:17:24] Mark everything alive. Yes.
[2:17:29] The Bible said Jesus started weeping
[2:17:33] and they will tell you the shortest
[2:17:34] verse in the Bible. Yes. Was Jesus. But
[2:17:38] you know why he went? He was bringing
[2:17:40] every spirit under control. He was
[2:17:44] bringing every spirit in harmony. Amen.
[2:17:47] In agreement. Read your Bible. The
[2:17:50] moment he was weeping, all the greetings
[2:17:52] started changing their mind. He said,
[2:17:55] "Ah, see how much he loved me. Could
[2:17:58] this man who can raise the dead even
[2:18:02] know that this man should not die at
[2:18:04] all?" They started confessing Christ.
[2:18:07] Yeah. They were attacking Christ before.
[2:18:10] Jesus put everything under control by
[2:18:13] weeping. Hallelujah. So tonight I place
[2:18:16] every spirit
[2:18:18] under my control in the name of Jesus
[2:18:22] Christ.
[2:18:28] [Applause]
[2:18:36] Hallelujah.
[2:18:38] Are we all in agreement?
[2:18:40] Do we all agree? It is possible.
[2:18:44] Jesus achieved the
[2:18:46] harmony with a
[2:18:49] loveous comfort.
[2:18:54] and corruption.
[2:18:57] [Applause]
[2:19:04] That was that voice. He said the master
[2:19:07] has come and is praying for
[2:19:09] me is
[2:19:11] [Applause]
[2:19:16] your bless.
