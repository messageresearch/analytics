[4:26] everything I know everything I Am Lord
[4:28] I'm emptying out so come and fill me
[4:30] this morning amen praise the Lord amen
[4:32] let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 amen
[4:37] I want to start
[4:39] speaking on faith again
[4:42] it is the most vital most important
[4:45] thing that we need in this life
[4:48] amen a Christian Life cannot be lived
[4:51] without faith
[4:53] [Music]
[4:54] if it's a life lived without faith it's
[4:57] a faith fake life
[5:00] fake Christian Life coming to church
[5:04] amen and doing things out of religion
[5:07] and it's all fake
[5:10] the things of God must be believed by
[5:13] faith everything is faith amen doesn't
[5:17] the Bible says we walk by faith and not
[5:20] by
[5:21] sight amen
[5:23] Hallelujah let's read our scripture and
[5:25] then we can be seated amen and then
[5:27] we'll get into the message Hallelujah
[5:29] everybody love the Lord
[5:31] amen he's worthy to be praised Hebrews
[5:34] chapter 11 and verse 1 reads now Faith
[5:38] is the substance of things hoped for
[5:42] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[5:45] for by it what's the it Faith the elders
[5:49] obtained a good report
[5:53] through faith we understand that the
[5:55] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[5:58] that the things which are seen were not
[6:01] made by of we're not made of things
[6:04] which do appear
[6:06] amen Lord of blessings to the reading of
[6:09] his word you may be seated
[6:11] hallelujah
[6:13] amen praise the Lord
[6:16] Hallelujah
[6:21] the prophet in the message faith is
[6:24] is the first message he ever preached
[6:27] says this
[6:30] it's the first message he says I think
[6:32] real true Ministers of the Gospel
[6:37] now we have many ministers
[6:42] now I remember when I'm speaking I'm
[6:44] speaking within the framework of the
[6:46] message
[6:47] amen
[6:49] that's who we concern ourselves with
[6:51] yeah the days of telling you that
[6:53] denominations are wrong and we are right
[6:55] are over amen amen we need to do
[6:58] introspection
[6:59] we need to bring ourselves into a
[7:01] service and do spiritual Diagnostics
[7:06] I think real true ministers
[7:09] of the Gospel not our own ambition
[7:13] not our own kingdom of what the gospel
[7:18] we got too many people with their own
[7:19] ambition with their own purpose and they
[7:22] have forgotten the kingdom of God
[7:25] they've forgotten about the gospel yes
[7:27] amen I think real true Ministers of the
[7:31] Gospel
[7:32] ought to be up and go
[7:37] and go ought to be giving the people the
[7:38] right things amen amen
[7:43] and what he says meet in due season and
[7:46] this is the first message
[7:48] imagine in 65 we know he preaches
[7:50] spiritual food in due season but this is
[7:52] the first message and he's calling Faith
[7:54] the meat in due season amen amen
[7:58] thank you amen
[7:59] if we go to verse 6 of that chapter
[8:01] brother uh in verse chapter 11. verse 6.
[8:06] we'll find there
[8:08] that faith is being
[8:11] described even further that without
[8:13] faith it is impossible
[8:16] man yeah
[8:18] to please him
[8:21] now Christian Life we ought to be
[8:23] pleasing the Lord
[8:26] it doesn't say Without Love
[8:29] it doesn't say without sacrifice without
[8:31] works
[8:32] without faith
[8:34] it's impossible to please him for he
[8:38] that cometh to God must believe that he
[8:40] is
[8:42] amen
[8:45] an easy rewarder of them that diligently
[8:49] seek him
[8:51] amen amen now we got too many people
[8:53] that are pursuing their own desires on
[8:55] the earth when I'm saying too many
[8:57] amongst us we are pursuing the lust of
[9:00] the flesh when I'm saying lust to the
[9:01] flesh we are pursuing material things in
[9:04] this life with such a passion and a
[9:06] purpose and we are achieving those
[9:09] things but those things you cannot
[9:10] enable the kingdom of God
[9:13] those things will make you comfortable
[9:15] in this life for a season
[9:19] but you are really living a defeated
[9:21] powerless life based on your own
[9:23] strength
[9:24] amen so without faith it is impossible
[9:28] to please God you say brother should not
[9:30] be pursuing a better house a better
[9:32] thing that's your own fleshly desire
[9:35] God has a better house for you
[9:42] for you God has a better car for you
[9:45] and I'm talking about the little things
[9:47] right now
[9:49] but because you went and did it your way
[9:51] you have settled for your house and your
[9:53] car
[9:55] hear me now
[9:57] yes but the Bible says seek ye first the
[9:59] kingdom amen
[10:01] and then all these other things will be
[10:04] added to you
[10:07] when somebody is born into your house
[10:09] that's your kingdom don't you as the
[10:11] father and mother seek the best interest
[10:13] of the child and give them everything
[10:15] even things they don't ask for
[10:18] amen so it's the same way in the kingdom
[10:20] of God we seek his kingdom what does the
[10:23] Bible say to him
[10:27] that diligently seek him how diligent
[10:30] are we
[10:31] how diligently are we seeking him
[10:34] now we got a 24-hour day
[10:38] right
[10:39] how much of time do we spend in that day
[10:42] speaking the word of God Amen
[10:45] no literally now come on
[10:48] when I'm talking about the word of God
[10:51] this is the word of God
[10:53] everybody familiar with this it's called
[10:56] The Holy Bible
[10:57] how much of this is coming out of our
[11:00] mouth
[11:01] let's be honest amen let's record our
[11:03] conversations in a day yes how much of
[11:06] that is coming out of our mouths
[11:10] yes
[11:13] all right maybe
[11:15] you see why we got to reprogram
[11:16] ourselves
[11:18] we speak a lot of other things
[11:21] but we don't speak the word of God
[11:24] because
[11:26] faith is based on what
[11:28] foreign
[11:30] faith is based on the word of God
[11:33] and if you believe that
[11:36] the prophets
[11:38] are the principle or the primary
[11:41] basis for God revealing his word
[11:48] or is the prophet secondary
[11:55] the primary is the word of God
[12:00] I got a quote for that some of you look
[12:01] at me shocked
[12:03] because I know why you do that
[12:05] because you've been programmed with a
[12:06] message that even if you don't
[12:08] understand something the prophet said
[12:09] you believe the prophet's word even if
[12:10] you made a mistake
[12:12] you'll believe the prophet's word over
[12:13] the Bible
[12:15] true
[12:17] come on now
[12:19] you've seen it happen
[12:21] the prophet remind me by the slip of the
[12:22] time you see the impression and answers
[12:24] yeah
[12:25] they started to question the prophet was
[12:28] it really that instead of this
[12:30] he said 700 instead of seven thousand
[12:32] they were prepared to believe that
[12:36] come on now yes
[12:39] the prophet will not reveal anything
[12:41] outside of the word amen if he's a true
[12:44] scriptural prophet what am I trying to
[12:46] tell you that
[12:48] faith is based on the word of God the
[12:51] word of God is our absolute
[12:56] did the bible say that heavens and earth
[12:58] will pass away but my prophets will
[13:00] never pass away
[13:03] water will never pass away
[13:05] the word of God will never pass away
[13:07] amen so the word must be the absolute in
[13:11] our life to live a life without faith is
[13:13] to use live a hopeless life
[13:16] hopeless
[13:18] to live a life without faith is to live
[13:20] a hopeless life
[13:22] amen
[13:24] based on the senses of the body
[13:29] how we feel what we see and most of the
[13:32] time we speak how we feel and what we
[13:35] see you know the most dangerous question
[13:38] you can ask somebody how are you today
[13:42] you are opening up the amounts of
[13:44] Prophecy sure
[13:47] I'm serious now you are opening up their
[13:50] mouths of Prophecy
[13:52] because as soon as they speak
[13:56] they start to speak the negative
[13:59] I'm feeling down I'm feeling this hey
[14:01] this is not right that is not right my
[14:03] back he saw my lung he saw my chest he
[14:06] saw sugar diabetes arthritis
[14:10] what's happening to us
[14:12] we are prophesying over ourselves our
[14:15] words are going and
[14:17] creating the atmosphere around us
[14:21] amen
[14:23] I tell a lot of people that I know are
[14:25] sick the first thing I tell them you're
[14:27] looking good you're looking well
[14:31] I'm feeling so bad this guy is telling
[14:33] me
[14:35] but it makes them feel good
[14:38] I'm with you when you're sick you look
[14:40] you feel me how do you feel better when
[14:42] they tell you you look terrible
[14:46] nobody amen so
[14:49] there's so much of negativity in this
[14:52] world because that's how Satan designed
[14:54] the world yes I'm gonna go slow
[14:57] and I'm going to take this in stages
[14:58] because we need to teach the people amen
[15:01] amen we have the opening of the world
[15:03] but all of that came for a purpose
[15:06] if you think of the end result of the
[15:08] opening of the word is to give us
[15:09] perfect faith rapturing faith
[15:13] amen faith
[15:15] When Faith is perfected
[15:17] so I'm going to say this way when with
[15:19] my vision for you as your pastor
[15:22] is that when we are done with you
[15:24] according to Ephesians 4 the only thing
[15:27] you must be missing is the new body
[15:30] amen amen amen Yes sounds good
[15:35] the only thing you should be short of is
[15:37] the new body
[15:38] [Music]
[15:40] oh thank you amen so if you ask me
[15:42] what's my vision that's my vision for
[15:44] you be so full of the word so equipped
[15:47] through the word amen yes no matter how
[15:49] you feel speak the word
[15:51] so full of the words who empowered by
[15:53] the word
[15:55] that the only thing you are short of is
[15:57] the new body
[15:59] not even sicknesses resigning in your
[16:02] body yes
[16:05] when I'm saying sicknesses I'm talking
[16:06] about all manner of sicknesses I am
[16:09] coming with a spotlight this morning and
[16:11] I'm asking you what are the conditions
[16:13] that you've been living with amen yes
[16:15] thank you sisters suffering with skin
[16:18] problems acne they call it trying all
[16:21] kinds of medication
[16:23] things we got accustomed to living with
[16:26] high blood pressure sugar diabetes
[16:28] arthritis back problems this that and
[16:31] the other that should not exist in your
[16:33] body amen amen amen thank you we've
[16:37] gotten too soft
[16:38] too comfortable when God gave us his
[16:40] word yes amen
[16:44] glory be to his name thank you Lord
[16:47] amen so there's so much of negativity in
[16:50] this world
[16:51] amen
[16:55] much more than positivity
[16:57] amen because this is a foreign world
[17:02] amen
[17:03] and it's based on negativity and fear
[17:05] because that's how Satan designed it you
[17:07] know we just come through this man
[17:09] called right what did you think it do to
[17:11] the rest of the world the same world no
[17:13] well they're all insane
[17:14] but the straight people
[17:16] it dropped panic and fail to them
[17:19] they didn't drive faith into them
[17:21] look at what they're trying to do teach
[17:23] our kids this this Panic fear Panic fear
[17:27] everything is designed for a purpose
[17:31] amen that is how Satan designed Eden by
[17:34] doubt and reasoning and in the Garden of
[17:37] Eden they were singing that song So pass
[17:40] it on so pass it on to everyone passing
[17:44] the blame from this person to that
[17:45] person to this person
[17:51] who did Adam blame
[17:54] who did he blame
[17:56] everything he passed it on
[17:59] pass it on to everyone
[18:02] amen
[18:03] so to live a life In the Flesh and to
[18:05] cater for the flesh
[18:07] we will live defeated lives in the
[18:09] spirit
[18:10] amen
[18:12] and we cannot please God In the Flesh
[18:17] so the Christian Life is a supernatural
[18:19] life the Christian life amen and in
[18:22] order to walk in this world
[18:25] the way we contact it is through faith
[18:27] if we want to tap into that Supernatural
[18:29] world right now the only way you can
[18:31] contact it is through faith we know what
[18:33] the prophets that faith is the sixth
[18:34] sense right amen now
[18:37] if I break this down and I tell you
[18:40] if you put up Hebrews 11 there
[18:42] let's just take this first verse
[18:45] amen
[18:47] when you leave here you must at least
[18:49] understand this first verse
[18:53] so what is faith if I had to ask you
[18:55] what is faith
[18:58] what is faith
[19:02] anybody
[19:06] yes complete Trust
[19:09] or confidence in someone or something
[19:13] that's the definition of faith we'll go
[19:15] through this Bible definition of Faith
[19:17] now
[19:18] but what is the definition of faith
[19:20] complete Trust in someone
[19:24] now we don't have just anyone
[19:27] we have the one complete trust and
[19:30] confidence in D1
[19:32] yeah that's two things someone or
[19:34] something but we do have something as
[19:36] well it's the word of God
[19:39] you say the word is not a thing
[19:42] when you call someone and tell them uh
[19:44] come here I want to tell you something
[19:45] what are you telling them
[19:47] don't you call them and say come here I
[19:49] want to tell you something
[19:54] you tell do you speak like that
[19:58] so it's the word a thing
[20:01] nobody is agreeing with me
[20:06] I want to tell you something
[20:08] is the word a thing
[20:10] the word is a thing so look at the
[20:11] definition of faith itself we are
[20:13] complete trust in the creature of
[20:15] heavens and the Earth
[20:16] and confidence in his word
[20:19] now Faith is the substance
[20:22] so complete confidence right faith if
[20:25] that's what we need right and if you
[20:27] would want to produce Faith within you
[20:28] then the disciples say increase our
[20:30] faith so faith is what we need but you
[20:33] can produce faith
[20:34] Fred coming by then yeah sharing of the
[20:37] word but not hearing alone I can hear
[20:40] the word all day and all night
[20:43] I can hear the word
[20:48] I can hear the word constantly
[20:51] but something was sick much in my heart
[20:53] it was simple because doesn't the
[20:55] prophecy hearing recognizing
[20:58] acting
[21:00] acting yeah
[21:02] so when you put your faith into action
[21:04] you start to speak and you believe you
[21:06] move faith in action amen
[21:08] amen that's what's producing that faith
[21:10] faith right
[21:12] Hallelujah
[21:14] so faith is the substance
[21:17] now if I'm going to break that down for
[21:19] you
[21:20] I'm going to tell you
[21:23] the substance is the raw material
[21:27] right of things hopeful
[21:30] what is Hope
[21:33] hope is your desire
[21:36] hope is your thoughts hope is your
[21:39] imagination
[21:44] so you must in order for Faith to be the
[21:46] substance to get what you hope for what
[21:49] you desire what you will
[21:51] your thoughts
[21:54] faith is going to be the raw material
[21:56] that produces that
[21:58] and brings the evidence of Things Not
[22:00] Seen amen let me explain to you
[22:03] this Pulpit what is the raw material of
[22:05] the spirit
[22:07] so what is the substance
[22:11] is with the substance
[22:14] of the pulpit yes
[22:16] right what is the substance of the
[22:18] spirit
[22:21] so faith is the substance needed for the
[22:25] healing of your body
[22:26] faith is a substance amen that's going
[22:29] to be used to bring to pass that which
[22:31] you desire amen amen yes watch it in the
[22:35] Unseen you're going to use Faith as the
[22:37] substance to bring it into the scene
[22:39] world
[22:40] Amen now brother Jaden can you go to
[22:44] that uh to my the study there on the
[22:47] study you'll see water there can you

[22:55] amen praise the Lord
[22:58] I'm not feeling thirsty I'm showing you
[23:00] an example
[23:01] my watch is in the room
[23:04] I know it's there I am afraid to believe
[23:06] it's there but as long as I stay quiet
[23:08] about it and I didn't speak to someone
[23:10] you didn't see the water there
[23:14] but my faith and confidence knowing that
[23:16] whether Jaden is obedient brought the
[23:19] water to the scene world
[23:23] and I was so thirsty but I left it there
[23:25] for the example
[23:28] amen I don't know if you knew the water
[23:31] was on the table
[23:32] none of you
[23:34] what brought it my faith and confidence
[23:37] to ask someone
[23:38] to go and get the something
[23:40] I brought it into the scene world
[23:44] amen hope you're understanding them
[23:47] faith is the substance
[23:53] faith is the raw material
[23:56] amen faith is the word
[24:00] and the more wood you have the more
[24:02] chairs you can make
[24:04] you can make whatever is in your
[24:06] imagination
[24:07] but if you have no imagination
[24:10] if you have no hope if you have no
[24:12] vision you do nothing with the Wind
[24:18] amen
[24:21] do I need to explain the other part if
[24:23] you have no vision if you have no
[24:25] thought if you have no immense desire
[24:29] for the things of God for bringing to
[24:31] pass in your life what God has laid in
[24:33] his word faith will lay dormant
[24:35] you can have all the wood all the
[24:38] substance being created but Faith Lays
[24:40] dormants
[24:41] free not in action
[24:44] amen
[24:46] Hallelujah so if you want to make a
[24:48] chair where does the chair exist
[24:51] in your
[24:53] thoughts
[24:54] now this is true if you're thinking
[24:55] about the message then the bible say
[24:58] that God existed in the beginning with
[25:01] his thoughts
[25:03] he was alone with this
[25:04] thoughts
[25:06] so everything as long as it remains in
[25:09] your thoughts
[25:10] nothing will happen yeah even you were
[25:13] in the mind of God
[25:15] but unless God got into action amen and
[25:18] he began to believe his own word
[25:22] but Mark 11. amen 23 24 there
[25:27] unless you believe your own word
[25:30] then you can use the substance to create
[25:35] to change your life yeah
[25:37] yeah to heal your body yes
[25:41] faith in what the word of God
[25:43] the scriptures are there by his wounds
[25:46] we were here
[25:47] amen glory be to his name
[25:52] so can if I had a log here
[25:55] Candlewood transform itself
[25:58] into a chair
[26:02] what is needed what is required
[26:05] someone with imagination
[26:08] someone with vision
[26:10] someone with purpose
[26:12] to take that wit the substance
[26:16] and watch it
[26:17] work it yeah
[26:19] work according to the laws of
[26:21] woodworking
[26:23] put it on a lake shape it up get a saw
[26:26] cut it up
[26:28] get your pieces together someone amen
[26:31] with an imagination think of Amen
[26:33] Michelangelo when he when he had a
[26:35] sculpture in his mind and now he's
[26:37] shipping away at the raw material
[26:39] until he chipped away every unnecessary
[26:42] part and only the necessary Parts
[26:44] remained
[26:47] amen
[26:49] so what is in your mind becomes evident
[26:52] in the chair
[26:54] amen
[26:56] without words
[26:59] you see the one the Bible says now I'm
[27:00] trying to bring James into life Elijah
[27:02] now by these practical examples
[27:05] faith without words is there amen so the
[27:09] substance itself all the wind itself
[27:12] without works
[27:14] that he's dead
[27:17] now notice I'm breaching it in a way
[27:19] that even the young people will
[27:20] understand this morning
[27:22] amen
[27:24] why we are building we have a vision
[27:27] because the same faith that you see now
[27:29] in seed form Mustard Seed Faith is the
[27:32] same fate when it's perfected
[27:34] he's going to change your body
[27:37] you can use the same substance
[27:39] faith
[27:40] to change the body yes
[27:43] amen so faith without words is dead
[27:47] amen
[27:49] faith without imagination is dead
[27:53] so what does faith need
[27:55] Faith needs your thoughts to come to
[27:56] life
[27:57] thoughts of healing thoughts of Peace
[27:59] amen
[28:00] thought over your problems thoughts over
[28:02] your circumstance based on the word of
[28:04] God
[28:06] amen
[28:10] so Faith so here is what Jesus said
[28:13] whatsoever things you desire
[28:18] whatsoever things you desire
[28:22] When you pray believe you receive them
[28:26] and you shall have them amen amen now
[28:30] what is he saying that let's go back one
[28:31] verse 23
[28:33] whosoever shall say to this mountain be
[28:36] thou removed
[28:38] so you need to tell it what to do
[28:41] two things here in the scripture
[28:43] what to do
[28:45] and where to go
[28:52] tell your problem tell your situation
[28:54] what to do
[28:56] and where to go
[28:59] be not removed because they need
[29:01] instructions
[29:02] did the pigs need the devils in the pigs
[29:04] need instruction
[29:06] tell us what to do where to go
[29:10] be thou removed and be cast into the sea
[29:12] and shall not doubt in his heart
[29:15] but Shall Believe those things which he
[29:18] said like what the Lord did now we made
[29:20] in His image and likeness believe your
[29:21] own words what you say shall come to
[29:24] pass and he shall have whatsoever he
[29:26] said
[29:28] then we go to the next verse
[29:31] whatever things you desire When you pray
[29:34] now I don't know if anyone who goes to
[29:37] the Lord and prays Lord
[29:40] I'm sick
[29:43] he said how he's asking you to pray
[29:45] you pray what you desire
[29:49] stop telling the Lord oh Lord my husband
[29:51] is so irritating
[29:59] speak what you desire
[30:02] speak what you want
[30:06] is is that word their desire limited to
[30:09] spiritual Geniuses in the message
[30:13] will confine you and and say don't ask
[30:15] for all those things bro
[30:19] whatsoever you desire so if you come
[30:22] against his intellectual John celebrate
[30:23] my desire not your desire leave me alone
[30:26] with my desire
[30:28] amen you don't have a vision for it I
[30:30] have a vision for you
[30:32] yeah right so leave me alone
[30:35] when my desire the Bible is here
[30:38] personally talking to me whatsoever you
[30:41] desire
[30:43] if you desire to be a structured it's
[30:45] fine
[30:49] amen glory be to his name amen so faith
[30:53] is the substance faith is the raw
[30:55] material to bring the Unseen into the
[30:58] same world that's what I'm speaking
[31:00] about this morning faith is the raw
[31:02] material that brings the Unseen into the
[31:05] same world
[31:07] you're gonna do it by your faith amen
[31:11] glory be to his name amen amen
[31:19] so let me just go to some
[31:21] amen glory be to his name Hallelujah
[31:30] let's start to Romans 10 9.
[31:33] amen these are the scriptures I need you
[31:34] to take down
[31:36] and memorize
[31:37] because these are the principles of
[31:40] faith
[31:46] let's go one verse above this to get
[31:47] context
[31:52] the word is near where
[31:56] in my bookshelf
[31:58] the word is near even in that car
[32:02] the word is near even in your mother's
[32:05] lips
[32:06] your father's lips
[32:09] the word is
[32:13] that
[32:14] mouth
[32:16] and in that
[32:18] Hearts so two places in thy mouth and in
[32:22] your heart
[32:22] what is what what is this now any word
[32:25] what word
[32:26] of faith are we speaking about faith
[32:29] this morning
[32:31] is that the raw material
[32:34] is the word producing Faith according to
[32:36] what we understand Faith cometh by
[32:38] hearing
[32:39] we speak only the word of faith
[32:42] which we preach
[32:44] right that if thou shall confess
[32:48] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus now we've
[32:51] had too many people come to Christ
[32:53] without a confession
[32:55] because it's not been taught for you
[32:57] it's not necessary
[32:59] you can think it
[33:02] does the Bible say think
[33:05] you that are babes in Christ that are
[33:06] coming into Christ now you need to do
[33:08] this
[33:10] confess with my mouth
[33:16] that means audibly yeah
[33:18] confess with your mouth
[33:21] confess With Thine mouth the Lord Jesus
[33:24] and thou shalt believe in thine heart
[33:27] so this is in line now with that verse
[33:29] before two places mouth and heart
[33:32] right confess with your mouth the Lord
[33:34] Jesus and believe in that heart that God
[33:36] had raised him from the dead Thou shalt
[33:39] be saved amen
[33:45] now I'm not too much for people who
[33:47] don't understand what the prophet
[33:48] preached
[33:51] because the prophet says the Bible says
[33:54] whosoever believeth on the Lord shall
[33:55] and confess we shall be saved the
[33:57] prophet says that word believe means to
[33:58] understand
[34:03] he says to understand
[34:05] because he says you preach the gospel on
[34:06] the street you're a drunk man there and
[34:08] you ask him hey you believe he said yeah
[34:09] I believe
[34:11] Now watch how they take this one quote
[34:13] and they destroy the scripture
[34:16] they take the quote where brother
[34:17] Branham speaking to Billy Paul
[34:19] and asking Billy Paul did you believe
[34:22] did you understand
[34:24] did you understand
[34:26] and then the prophet says it's not
[34:28] important you understand it's important
[34:29] you believe
[34:30] but the same Prophet when he's
[34:32] explaining the scripture tells you
[34:34] believe means understand
[34:36] why were Seven Seals revealed
[34:40] if we were not supposed to understand it
[34:43] you think God is an author of confusion
[34:45] no
[34:46] no I will hide my word for 2 000 years
[34:49] I will send a Vindicated prophet and he
[34:52] will reveal the mysteries of God
[34:54] but you don't need to understand it
[34:59] then we preach that we have the mind of
[35:01] Christ and we know what he once done
[35:03] with the word how can you preach the
[35:06] mind of Christ nobody wants done with
[35:07] the word when you are saying nobody
[35:09] wants done what the word means you have
[35:10] an understanding of his thoughts of his
[35:12] mind his purpose in this hour
[35:17] amen Glory
[35:20] so every time you open your mouth and
[35:22] confess with your mouth and believe in
[35:24] your heart faith is the substance that
[35:26] is produced
[35:29] when you are saying by your wounds I am
[35:31] healed what are you doing you're
[35:33] producing the fruits for healing the
[35:35] substance for healing yes
[35:38] you're producing the sun you need Faith
[35:40] to bring it from The Unseen World to the
[35:43] scene world
[35:44] but there's so many different areas of
[35:46] your life right now I'm using sickness
[35:48] you need healing of the body but you
[35:50] need to speak the word the scriptures
[35:52] pertaining to Healing to produce the
[35:54] substance to bring healing to your body
[35:56] amen and it's only based on the word
[35:59] stop speaking our own words yeah yeah
[36:02] yes
[36:03] your words are useless yeah
[36:07] speak the word of God back to him amen
[36:10] and his word will not return void
[36:13] it's simple say Lord buy your own time
[36:16] here I claim it in the name of Jesus
[36:18] Lord I Thank You Lord you abundant for
[36:21] my transgressions your proves to my
[36:23] iniquities the chastisement of my peace
[36:25] was upon you and by your stripes I am
[36:27] healed speak the word back to him
[36:32] amen
[36:35] you have need of something else whatever
[36:38] it is
[36:40] amen
[36:42] whatever area in your life now you're
[36:43] lacking
[36:45] say Lord find the scripture and apply
[36:48] the scripture
[36:49] only speak the scripture back
[36:53] God cannot ignore his own word that's
[36:55] right amen
[37:00] so when you got a substance you got to
[37:02] have a desire if you have no hope you
[37:04] have no desire faith is the substance of
[37:07] things before
[37:09] things in your thoughts things in your
[37:11] mind things that you desire
[37:17] like I said if you leave the wood there
[37:19] it'll just remain wood
[37:21] if you leave the faith there you just
[37:23] remain dormant
[37:27] amen so faith is spiritual things of God
[37:30] Are Spiritual amen and faith is an
[37:33] invisible substance that has the power
[37:36] to change invisible imagination or
[37:38] thought into physical manifestation
[37:49] amen so if we had to get an architect to
[37:52] build a building for us

[40:34] performed and miracles and healings are
[40:37] taking place generally people come
[40:39] for the healing for the miracle but
[40:42] remember that's an attraction yeah
[40:44] for the gospel that should never stop

[43:12] last since the prophet went

[43:16] and you'll bear me witness now
[43:18] demons don't worry anyone in the message
[43:26] very few
[43:29] because Mark 16 has become non-existent
[43:33] put up Mark 16.
[43:36] people don't have faith anymore
[43:39] they don't have confidence in that
[43:40] scripture

[44:47] with the Lord
[44:48] we think now
[44:50] you can listen you can I can put you in

[45:13] voice
[45:15] amen
[45:18] so I was telling you about this
[45:20] Minister the church started to grow
[45:23] and
[45:25] probably similar to our situation yeah
[45:28] the parking was the only space they
[45:30] could use to extend
[45:32] so he decided to extend the church
[45:35] and add more and more miracles were
[45:37] taking place
[45:38] what do you think they needed to do
[45:40] extend the church more see I'm giving
[45:42] you a vision now

[45:56] you amen and you shall be healed yeah
[45:59] don't let us come there in the open and
[46:01] then tell them come to church yeah let
[46:04] them hear the word of God
[46:06] you see we have thought that the the
[46:08] gospel is has evolved to a thing and
[46:11] it's only for us believers
[46:15] the gospel is for the preaching of the
[46:17] Lost
[46:18] to the preaching of the laws
[46:20] to show the power of God yeah
[46:22] amen
[46:25] and maybe you don't have confidence
[46:27] start to build your confidence
[46:30] tell them you've tried so many things
[46:31] why don't you come
[46:36] this side shall follow them that believe
[46:38] if they lay hands upon the sick they
[46:40] shall recover they here I was telling

[46:53] powers
[46:54] you know what they are intellectual
[46:56] Giants they say I rather live in with
[46:58] that one devil because I know this fella
[47:00] is not going to make his life right and
[47:02] if a Caster than one devil
[47:04] he won't accept the Holy Ghost so seven
[47:06] was Devils will come upon him so I
[47:08] rather leave him with the one devil
[47:12] that's people's thinking
[47:15] they are using the word of God for their
[47:17] own devices
[47:21] I can handle one devil
[47:23] how am I going to handle it it does
[47:26] become eight because the Bible says the
[47:28] one that left called seven others and

[47:59] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[48:01] amen
[48:05] amen amen
[48:06] so what happened was
[48:09] there was no more space in the parking
[48:11] so they need a parking now
[48:13] and the first people that were in the
[48:14] church the the founders the Elders of
[48:17] the church
[48:18] so I started to feel hey you know what

[48:23] we've got no space But even we come late
[48:25] you know the the people that's long in
[48:28] the church would think they've got
[48:29] special privileges come late to church

[48:53] tell them to do
[48:54] they must stay after school for what
[48:57] they call it
[49:01] so we can have detention class

[49:12] so let's fix those things let's get it
[49:14] right let's move on right amen
[49:19] so what they
[49:20] saw now the only place they had to build
[49:23] a parking
[49:25] was this mountain behind the church
[49:30] amen
[49:34] so there was a quarrel and an argument
[49:35] going on and they said are we going to
[49:37] move that mountain the pastor says next
[49:39] service
[49:40] we are going to come and pray
[49:43] and we're going to pray for the mountain
[49:44] to move
[49:46] how many people you think showed up
[49:49] very few
[49:51] you see like I'll be telling these
[49:53] brothers
[49:54] and I don't know how many of them
[49:55] believe me that I am praying for
[49:57] promotion for this next guy that he
[50:00] could go buy a better house yeah
[50:03] so that we can buy that house
[50:07] you see I'm telling you

[50:12] Unseen World with a substance called
[50:14] faith and I'm gonna bring it into the
[50:16] scene world
[50:19] right
[50:21] so come service very few people there he
[50:24] goes to the mountain and he starts to
[50:25] pray Lord you said in your word
[50:27] according to Mark 11 23 if I say to this
[50:30] mountain be moved
[50:31] tell it what to do and where to go
[50:34] and if I don't doubt but believe in my
[50:37] heart what I said shall come to pass

[50:46] everybody knew now that the praying
[50:48] meeting took place to becoming church
[50:50] Sunday

[50:53] behind the church to see if the mountain
[50:55] is still there
[50:58] and the mountain is still there
[51:00] right the mountain is still there but
[51:03] he had to maintain a positive confession
[51:08] he had to still maintain it because the
[51:10] word of God Falls from his mouth amen
[51:13] yes amen it will not return void
[51:16] you see what the problem is without the
[51:18] word of God if you spoke it stand there
[51:20] and watch it come back

[51:26] so the people that you know kind of
[51:28] people start to laugh at the past he
[51:30] said hey the mountains will move see the
[51:31] mountains still there and we still got
[51:33] no parking we're parking on the road yet
[51:35] some people like to park on the road

[52:16] him and they say you know what we're

[52:40] for it yeah
[52:42] amen
[52:44] amen you see God will use circumstances
[52:46] to move the mountain
[52:48] so they negotiated and he had a timeline
[52:51] so he when the negotiating powers in
[52:54] your hand he said how soon is this going
[52:55] to be done so he told them you know what
[52:57] we have more need of the sand than you
[52:59] so we are going to do it in this week

[53:14] for somebody if you got that property
[53:17] magazine put in the post box next door
[53:18] there let them start looking yeah
[53:24] it can't be that way in green manner
[53:26] number 10. and now verse starts in verse
[53:29] 8.
[53:30] chapter 10 verse 8. in Revelation so we
[53:34] need 10 units
[53:36] amen you believe it yes amen amen
[53:39] hallelujah
[53:43] so they came amazed now Pastor yes we
[53:46] believe now the mountain moved but the
[53:48] pastor not only did they have the
[53:50] mountain move they also got paid for the
[53:52] mountain
[53:53] amen so that's how God can work in our
[53:55] lives amen hallelujah
[53:59] the kingdom of God
[54:02] is about reaping and sowing and reaping
[54:05] anything the principles in the kingdom
[54:07] of God you so doubt you'll read doubt
[54:10] you sow Faith you read Faith amen amen
[54:13] whatever you sow you shall read
[54:16] you sure so negativity you'll reap
[54:18] negativity
[54:19] whatever you saw that's a principle in
[54:22] the kingdom of God
[54:24] you are going to read them
[54:26] so you what is obstructing your faith is
[54:29] your negative confession your negative
[54:32] words
[54:33] is diluting the substance
[54:38] faith is the substance faith is the raw
[54:41] material
[54:42] but now you know they used to use
[54:45] genuine stuff before but now China got
[54:47] involved
[54:49] and they make synthetic stuff
[54:51] it's like the original but it's not
[54:55] so don't let your faith be synthetic
[54:58] let your faith be original
[55:00] amen hallelujah
[55:04] amen
[55:07] so when we speak the word of faith it's
[55:09] not your job to doubt it it's your job
[55:12] to believe it
[55:13] amen what does the Bible say one of us
[55:17] can put a thousand to flight but what
[55:20] can two of us do
[55:21] he said the legion fleeing
[55:23] does the Bible say when two or more are
[55:25] gathered together in my name yes
[55:26] powerful
[55:30] if one can do so much what can do to do
[55:33] when they agree if you shall agree upon
[55:35] touching anything
[55:37] you shall have what you say
[55:41] amen so from now on you are going to
[55:44] have your thoughts your imagination
[55:46] based on the word of God and you're
[55:49] going to bring it to life
[55:50] amen unless you dream unless you have a
[55:53] vision you are going to perish
[55:55] I have a vision for your soul I have a
[55:58] vision for yourself I have a vision for
[56:00] your family
[56:02] I have a vision that not one of them is
[56:04] lost
[56:07] and let Faith go to work let Faith be
[56:10] the substance
[56:12] amen
[56:13] that produces it and brings it into the
[56:15] same world how do you produce it Romans
[56:18] 10 9
[56:19] speak them out believe in your heart
[56:23] speak with your mouth believe in your
[56:24] heart
[56:26] nothing nothing
[56:30] speak the word
[56:32] I was preaching amen about amen
[56:36] about tearing down Satan's kingdom
[56:40] causing war and Devastation and I was
[56:42] showing you how speaking the word causes
[56:44] war and Devastation in the Kingdom of
[56:46] Satan
[56:47] amen don't be idle speak the word of God
[56:51] eat the word of God you've got nothing
[56:53] to do say a scripture amen amen open up
[56:56] the Bible memorize a verse speak the
[56:59] scripture throw poems into heaven and
[57:01] into Satan's kingdom amen
[57:03] [Music]
[57:04] speak the word
[57:06] amen John where where did the word go
[57:08] into the mouth
[57:10] speak the word
[57:12] amen hallelujah
[57:19] praise be to the Lord amen
[57:27] now I'm going to give you an example of
[57:30] another pastor
[57:33] this pasta very poor Church in India
[57:40] amen
[57:42] so you know when the church is small and
[57:44] the past is full time
[57:46] and the tides are small
[57:48] it's not easy for the pastor to live
[57:50] right especially if they're living off
[57:52] that
[57:53] so he didn't even have his table and a
[57:56] chair
[57:57] to put in the office of the church
[57:59] and he says what on foot and come to
[58:02] church
[58:03] and he was telling the Lord I need to
[58:06] get a table and chairs so at least I can
[58:07] sit here and I also need a bicycle
[58:10] so that I can
[58:13] come to church and if somebody is sick
[58:15] call in need again travel a bit faster
[58:18] on the bicycle and get to them so you
[58:20] use Mark 11 23 Behold a man if you say
[58:23] to this mountain be that I'll move
[58:24] custom to the Sea don't doubt in your
[58:26] heart believe those things which you
[58:27] said shall come to pass
[58:29] amen
[58:31] now notice
[58:34] the scripture says believe whatever you
[58:37] said shall come to pass
[58:39] now whatever you said you shall have it
[58:41] I mean if you believe that
[58:43] whatever you say you shall have it
[58:48] so what happens now if you say
[58:51] you know I've got the most rude boss I

[59:13] like this constantly is like this like
[59:15] this like this we even go to God and
[59:17] tell him about our boss

[1:01:08] now two I agree touching that thing you
[1:01:10] shall receive it
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:15] therefore things whatsoever you desire

[1:01:23] 24.
[1:01:25] whatsoever things you desire you know
[1:01:27] what that is blankship
[1:01:32] hello
[1:01:34] it's a blank check
[1:01:36] whatsoever thinks you desire is a blank
[1:01:39] shape
[1:01:40] amen hallelujah
[1:01:43] given by Jesus signed by Jesus
[1:01:47] Blanchard given to you the believer
[1:01:50] whatsoever you desire
[1:01:52] will this check bounce
[1:01:56] whatever you desire When you pray did he
[1:01:59] say
[1:02:01] speak your buttons speak your problems
[1:02:05] did he say speak your sickness
[1:02:07] he said speak your desire
[1:02:11] and when you come to Jesus like this
[1:02:15] amen we come to Jesus and we talk about
[1:02:17] our desires
[1:02:21] I know it's simple
[1:02:23] I know it's plain but that's how Jesus
[1:02:25] taught
[1:02:26] Jesus taught in parables
[1:02:30] so when we come to Jesus we talk to
[1:02:32] Jesus about our desires amen yes
[1:02:35] and the prophet says that many times
[1:02:37] Jesus will talk back to me and if my
[1:02:40] desire is not in line with his word he
[1:02:42] will tell me why you can't bring that to
[1:02:44] pass
[1:02:47] like how you talk to your children and
[1:02:49] tell them why you can't
[1:02:51] Jesus does the same with us
[1:02:53] but he's not telling you shut your
[1:02:55] desires and don't tell me your desires
[1:02:58] whatsoever you desire come talk to me
[1:03:02] come let us reason
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:07] so the Pastor said Lord I believe
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:11] now when you believe that listen to me
[1:03:13] now I'm going to close
[1:03:16] doesn't matter maybe didn't touch a lot
[1:03:18] of the message a lot of the sermon it's
[1:03:20] fine
[1:03:24] the main thing is are you learning
[1:03:28] because this thing must be applied yes
[1:03:31] so you got a week to apply it and then
[1:03:33] you learn new principles
[1:03:35] amen we need to start applying these
[1:03:38] things yes I told you the only thing you
[1:03:40] should be short of is the new body
[1:03:43] you should be the Disciples of the Lord
[1:03:45] Jesus Christ wherever you go yeah
[1:03:48] circumstance and situations arise in
[1:03:50] your way you are the disciple of the
[1:03:52] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:53] you take authority over that situation
[1:03:58] hmm But read James how the Lord presents
[1:04:02] trials
[1:04:03] Temptations to perfect your faith
[1:04:06] and also to produce patience then he
[1:04:09] says my patience is he's perfected in
[1:04:11] you
[1:04:13] then it brings forth the product
[1:04:16] right
[1:04:18] sorry the Lord tells him okay
[1:04:21] you prayed this prayer I want you to go
[1:04:23] before the people and confess him
[1:04:27] thank me start thanking me for it so he
[1:04:29] goes in the congregation
[1:04:31] and he starts preaching and he tells the
[1:04:33] people I want to tell you people
[1:04:34] something

[1:04:43] amen and not only that he's gonna give
[1:04:44] me this bread no bicycle

[1:04:48] so everybody hallelujah
[1:04:51] what did he say he didn't say the Lord
[1:04:53] is going to bless me
[1:04:55] he told him the Lord has blessed me
[1:04:58] the Lord God has given me the time of a
[1:05:00] teacher
[1:05:03] I am healed
