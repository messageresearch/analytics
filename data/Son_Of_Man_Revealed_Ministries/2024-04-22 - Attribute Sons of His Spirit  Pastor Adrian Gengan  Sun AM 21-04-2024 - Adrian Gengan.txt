and also brother seban is away amen also going away to the South poast we pray the Lord will give them safe traveling mercies amen but we are here to Rejoice around the word of the Lord amen and let's turn to Genesis chapter 1 praise the Lord Hallelujah so at this time in season amen we appreciate the way the Lord is working with us we see the way he's working with natural Israel amen you do know that Israel can't continue in that way for much longer without Supernatural help that's right amen and the only way they can get Supernatural help is for the bride to leave the Earth amen because the prophet teaches us he don't work with the Gentiles and the Jews at the same time amen so he's got to fix things quickly now for the Gentiles get them off the scene so that amen he can now walk with the Jews again amen and you can see all nations you know the prophet taught us these things when you see all nations start to turn against Israel amen imagine that somebody attacks you and they tell you don't attack them back that's what they being told don't attack them back amen and you can see the the US who was their biggest Ally amen now also wants to take the breaks of the support of Israel so these are all signs for us it's been spoken in the message for years and years and years we've been preaching about these things the prophet laid in the books and tapes and now we can see it coming to pass before our very own eyes amen it also helps us to see the time and season that we are in amen but we don't use those things to scare us into getting ready amen the angel of the Lord is already here preparing us for the rapture amen hallelujah so we are not troubled or perplexed at wars and rumors of wars we are already ready for the Rapture how many if you can say Amen this morning amen praise the Lord amen so Genesis 1:26 Hallelujah and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them amen amen are you feeling blessed this morning and God blessed them amen praise the Lord and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the sea amen let's turn to Romans chapter 8 these are very important scriptures at this time at this time amen the reason I'm reading Genesis 1 I'm showing you where you're going back to the type of man you're going back to amen praise the Lord amen Romans chapter 8 reading from let's read from verse uh 16 okay maybe from verse 15 there you this the scripture is packed I just want to keep reading and reading amen but let's read from verse let's read 15 for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption amen amen amen have you received that spirit yet amen the spirit of adoption amen amen so adoption is a spirit that will come upon you that groaning for adoption it says we have received the spirit of adoption amen some are satisfied being the son of Mami but the spirit of adoption connects you back with your father amen praise the Lord you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit that's the Holy Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen so what is the holy spirit coming to do identify your give you an identification the holy spirit is here now to tell you that you are the children of God and if children remember being a child brings promises brings inheritance then a a speak of inheritance ears of God joint ears with Christ if so be that you suffer with him that we may also be glorified together amen for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us hallelujah for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope yes because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God aren't you glad that this flesh is going to be delivered this creature here amen is going to be delivered from bondage of corruption for we know that the all creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body amen amen amen one more scripture Revelation chapter 10 praise the Lord Revelation 10 and verse 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise the Lord amen everybody feeling good amen hallelujah amen it's a good thing to be found in the house of the Lord and to be called the Sons and Daughters of God this morning I want to speak on attribute sons of his spirit amen amen attribute sons of his Spirit am that's who we are amen atribute sons of his Spirit now we know an attribute is a quality if I talk about an attribute I'm talking about the quality the character or characteristic ascribed to someone trying to define attribute sons of his spirit this morning amen so an attribute is the quality character or characteristic of someone amen so the attributes of God refer to the character traits of God am amen amen amen hallelujah the character traits of God that are revealed to us in the scripture and as long as God remains a mystery we would not understand the nature of God meaning we wouldn't understand his attributes his nature and his character the way he revealed himself amen so the only way for us to know God's attributes the only way for us to know God's nature and his character is for the mystery of God to be revealed amen amen amen amen amen and we are living in that time Hallelujah we are living in that season where the mystery of God has been revealed the seventh angel has sounded so then now we can identify his attributes we can identify his nature we can identify his character praise the Lord so when the mystery of God is being revealed his attributes are being revealed Hallelujah prior to 107 being fulfilled his attributes were not fully revealed amen sons of God couldn't come to their full potential yes amen amen Luther couldn't operate as a fully as a Romans 8 man right neither could Wesley amen function like a Romans 8 man neither could the early Pentecostals but there's a time and season amen that's been designated for Sons and Daughters to come back to everything that they were in the beginning can somebody say Amen to that amen so with this it was revealed to us that we were in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the earth amen we know we've been reading Ephesians 1 and that confirms it that what we were predestinated to and to adoption of children there amen praise the Lord but this is my point now you and I are not a regular thought of God Amen remember what I'm trying to do this morning I'm trying to take away the Amnesia amen amen when man fell the prophet says we became unconscious of the fact of who we are but the preaching of the word in this end time the fivefold ministry in this end time he's coning out to amen reveal to you and make you known as you were known amen thank amen hallelujah we can't continue in this life living a kind of Life we've got to recognize who we are and what we were put on the earth for amen so when the mystery of God revealed now it takes on a different meaning because that is going to reveal Us in Christen amen it's going to reveal his attributes amen so we are not in regular thought amen hallelujah we are not an ordinary thought of God yes amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen every son and daughter of God every child of God is no ordinary thought oh thank you Lord God meticulously thought about you he planned you amen he shaped you and he formed you he knew which part of the word you would be fulfilling for this age so God's thoughts about you are Eternal maybe now in the body there's some defect in your body there's some sickness amen but you're an attribute of God and your body must come in alignment with God's word amen and must let go of you amen amen demon powers that attach themselves to your body to your children's body to your wife's body body to your son's body amen they are illegally attaching themselves to that body amen but sons of God are coming back into their position and with the authority to tell that demon powers to let God's people go amen hallelujah so Genesis amen Genesis reveals our true beginning and brother Bram took us Beyond Genesis amen before creation Before Time began before Angels were created before creation of the heavens and the Earth he gave us our existence and eternal quality am no other preacher told us that amen but the seventh angel why when he's revealing the mystery of God the attributes of God must be fully revealed so he's got to tell you about yourself if you are an attribute of God yes praise the Lord amen Lord amen hallelujah yes so until that this may seem like a simple thing now but until this is established in your heart drops down from your head into your heart yes it'll be hard for you to reach rapturing Faith perfect Faith yes because perfect faith is knowing who we are what the word says about us and becoming everything the word says about us amen praise the Lord hallelujah if somebody in the natural loses their memory amen you've got to start to remind them of who they were where they come from you remember that soldier that lost his memory in battle he was going on this train and at one of the train stations he jumped off and he was looking and staring out at a hill and he just started to walk and one of the maybe the one of his leaders there started to follow him and this boy started to walk but he was completely lost his mind he started to walk down Pathways started to walk up a hill and down the hill and he got to a little house and he knocked on the door and when the door was opened this man on the other side hugged him and said my son I knew you would come home amen what happened he was walking down familiar Pathways amen and that's what the message of the hour came to do to make us walk down familiar pathways to lead us back to our father's home amen thank you Lord amen now we know the prophet of God tells us that the Holy Ghost does not make us Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah the Holy Ghost cannot make you a son and daughter of God you had to be a son and daughter of God already the Holy Ghost is only coming to equip you now in this time and season amen amen the Holy Ghost comes down to confirm your sunship amen your sunship was something in the back part of God's mind and it took the prophet to tell us where we came from amen so don't tell me we don't need a prophet amen and we know that the seven seal book that came down in this day came back with an abstract title D an abstract meaning something that was searched all the way back to the beginning meaning there's no other claimants on that title deed every other claimant has been stricken off that's what Boaz did amen when he went to the near Kinsman he when he was tracing back the title deed of noom's inheritance elac's inheritance there was a nearer Kinsman they had claims on their title te thank but he gave him an opportunity and the man refused so he struck him off amen praise the Lord amen so the seven seal book came with an abstract title de amen it searched all the way back to the beginning Tracing Our orions all the way from before the beginning don't you love the prophet of God because he gives our existence quality we are not didn't evolve from a monkey he told us where we came from what's our purpose here on the earth and where we are going to he gave our existence quality amen praise the Lord amen everything amen that you see created in heaven in the Earth was they thought of God because of God's omniscience he knows all things even knowing how how many times the prophet says he bets the flea would bet his eye think about this God now he knows how many times if flea bets his eye highs amen that's how complex and that's how great the mind of God is oh yes thank you Lord every little detail that's going on in the world right now God knows about it and God knows every little detail in your life amen maybe you feel like you're forsaken that God has forgotten about you I'm here to remind you that God knows every detail in your life thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord amen God is concerned about you God is concerned about your life amen but God wants you to commit your weary ways your troubles to the Lord Everything To God In Prayer amen amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord we've got to leave it there even if the world from you would old all it's silver and it's gold and you have to get along with Meer fair just remember his word how he feeds the little bird take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there thank you Lord if God won't let sparrows go hungry you're a son and daughter of God David said I've never seen the righteous forsaken amen thank you or seed begging bread thank you Lord amen you got to recognize your father and put a claim on your father you can't be joint tears with Jesus and then still be living beneath our privileges we've got to put in a clim to recognize who we are yes thank you Lord thank you Lord well if you think God's forgotten about you and who you are why don't you remind him who you are yes sir oh thank you go to me in prayer Lord I'm your son I'm your daughter why am I going through the trial why am I going to it oh God deliver me amen amen but the thing is we want to turn and walk away sometimes we want to get upset with god oh you've forgotten about me amen why is this going on in my life I didn't plan this type of life for me but God is building your character amen very important thing I'm telling you now an attribute reveals the character and nature of God but I want you to know that character you don't come with it on the earth you don't come built in with God's character because the prophet says character is not a gift character is a victory amen which means he going to use the trial it's going to take you to your place of trying to build up that character and that place of trying is only going to prove that you have the character of God because you can remain in patience character is not a gift you don't come predestinated from heaven with God given character character is a victory amen somebody say amen amen praise the Lord amen amen so we're talking about all thoughts now that were in God's mind even Lucifer was a thought in God's mind and all the angels that fell was a thought in God's mind but they were not attribute thoughts yes there's a difference with being a thought and there's a difference with being an attribute thought yes what is an attribute determines the nature character of a person you are an attribute thought meaning you are going to reveal the nature and the character of God thank you Lord Lucifer was in God's mind but he not an attribute thought how can he be revealing the attributes of God when he rebelled against God how can those angels be an attribute of God when they rebelled and they left heaven with Satan yes so anything that's not revealing his attributes his nature and his character is not an attribute thought hallelujah amen when a thought is an attribute thought it's a different thought it's a peculiar thought Amen brother Bram revealed that God's thoughts about us amen as an attribute meaning that God's thoughts about us are just not ordinary thoughts but they exist in God's mind but God's thoughts about us were his very nature we are reflecting God's nature that's who we really are that's our identity amen you see people don't like this preaching now because then when you when you realize who you are you can't go living your life the same way amen amen you can't be the same Almighty amen but you've got to be changed amen amen amen they can't constantly think that you are this type of person who just reacts from the flesh all the time amen temper like a buz saw brother brandom even had a temple like a b but his character was molded and shaped Hallelujah now you have a choice to believe this or not whether you're an attribute thought or not you have a choice to believe it you also have a choice to believe that you are in the Eternal section of the book you know in The Book of Life there's two sections there's a normal regular Book of Life and then there's a lamp section of the book of life that's who we are dealing with now that's what the mighty Angel brought down he brought down the lamb section of the book of life every attribute of God that could be redeemed the angel has come down to reveal the names that were found in the book amen come on this is what the message of the hour is amen the message of the hour just didn't come to make us a church member didn't just come to form another church but the message of the hour came to put us in program with God's plan for our lives amen amen thank you Lord we find amen the regular section even in the message there's a regular section in the message Community then there's the Eternal section amen the lamb section the ones that have his own attributes amen thank you Lord yes it is wow GL there are people who are manifesting his attributes right now amen thank you Lord many preachers are preaching from the regular section of the book you listen to them they sound like denominational preachers Hallelujah but then there are those amen that are preaching from the Eternal section of the booken the car are preaching things that pertain to this life how to get along in this life how to be a better me how to be a better you amen seven steps to a better life amen but the ones that are preaching from the Eternal section amen are teaching you about the Eternal part of God's mind and how you existed in the Eternal thoughts of God's mind they're also teaching you about you ought to be conditioned and how you stand here with the authority of God Amen on the earth the power of God to back you up am GL who did this the prophet connected us to this the prophet's message connected us to this Amen to tell us we are Eternal as God is eternal somebody give God praise and believe it shake that unbelief off of you this morning we are Eternal as God is eternal amen amen amen let's read that first quote there in the in Hebrews chapter 5 amen the prophet says God made angels and God made man and what God does is off of God go don't move too fast now he what he's saying God made man but how did he make man he made it off of [Music] God Amen don't read too fast what substance did he go to when he made man he went to his own self he went to his own substance and he made what God does is of of God which is as Eternal as God is oh somebody ought to Rejoice Amen to know that you and I as Eternal as God is meaning they can put the flesh to the ground you may die of some sickness but you are Eternal as God is eternal you shall not die thank you Lord amen you shall not die you are an eternal attribute of God there's no way for you to die amen oh yes they may you may die in the flesh but there's no way for you to be separated from God Amen you're coming back you are coming back Amen in your even Beauty thank you Lord hallelujah yes and man is just as Eternal as his creator because he was made from eternity amen hallelujah amen we were made from eternity amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen you what the prophet now talking in the next quote he's going to detail the scripture in Ephesians chapter 1 and he's reading it he says now predestinated having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will you know that's Ephesians 1 he says what about that brother Mike isn't that wonderful he loved you he loved you before there was a world yes he know your nature he know your weakness he know your abits he know all about you what you was going to be and when he looked all over the great universe as it was he said I Choose You am thank you with your faults I choose you with your weaknesses I choose you and when he did that before there was ever a speck of light then you Eternal with God when you receive the Holy Ghost then you become Eternal because you're with God you're part of God can you see what I mean you are as Eternal as God is because you are now it goes to the Natural I'm as much brandom as my father was a brandom because I'm blood of a brandom I'm a brandom with my father because I was born of my father you are word sorry you are W talking about Banks W there now because of your father being wood you are as much wood as Jim Wood is not you're just Bank Woods you're nille because your father was a nille you're just as much nille as he was nille Glory we just as Eternal as God is because we are part of God Sons and Daughters of God God eternal life can never perish I'll raise it up at the last days amen amen glory praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen now he says here in the next one for those of you that need healing I put this in here healing is of God alone and God alone has purchased for us our healing it's up to us to do everything that we can in our life and in every way that God has give us for our healing but it's God that heals yes amen amen I hope you're reading what the prophet is saying there it's up to us to do everything we can in this life in every way that God has give us so if you need to go to the doctor you go to the doctor because the prophet is teaching us God heals through medicine God heals through music amen yes Hallelujah God heals through his word yes amen so are we going through every area and he says but it's God that heals amen that's right if God calls you to go home tonight there isn't enough medicine in the world will keep you here yes there's nothing going to keep you here and if he determines you to stay on the earth no matter how many Physicians say you're going tonight you're not going so it's just all up to God so you can rest in that that nobody can touch your life amen he says God is life life eternal in the was God he wasn't God at that time because God the English word god means object of worship there was nothing but him he was the Eternal just the Eternal one there was no moon no stars No Angel no nothing but in the beginning when we called God our Father Was attributes in him was an attribute to be father in him was attribute to be God in him was attribute to be son in him was attribute to be savior in name was attribute to be healer and all these things that we see now is just displaying his attributes amen than now if you were in is thinking at the beginning if you've got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning and it has no ending amen so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him your form your shape and what you're in now is just a negative when you come around 22 years old you are a negative and death develops the picture to the positive that when this Earthly Tabernacle dis be dissolved we already have one waiting amen just to display now it shows what's being done like God becoming God when he creates Angels he becomes son when he created Jesus Christ he becomes savior when Jesus died he becomes healer when he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed amen all these things are attributes of God just so that in the end the Bible says you will know that I am in the Father the father in me I in you you in me amen it's God becoming tangible your own wife you and your husband is just a shadow a negative of God and his wife the church amen so ask yourself at any time when was the attribute of God's wife on display amen now amen so God had an attribute to reveal himself in feminine form and locked up in the masculine form of Jesus Christ was the Bride of the Lord Jesus but at the cross they put a spear to his side and water and blood came out that was the birth of the church amuah amen amen why it's enough to set a Act of a beli on fire in these great hours that we're living when all hopes and Nations and everything else is crumbling on us and us we've got a kingdom we are baptized into this Kingdom amen hallelujah praise the Lord so the Lord has come now and he's given us the holy spirit amen but the holy spirit is just a temporal gift to you and I because Ephesians tells us amen grieve not the Holy Spirit until the day of your Redemption amen so yeah let's read the quote for those of you who don't know it amen in things that are to be he says I've got the baptism the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you yes the real gift is your soul down in there so how's the condition of our souls this morning the real gift is your soul down in there cuz remember that's why the Holy Ghost came to connect with your soul yes that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God Amen so if you're not conformed to the word of God and the will of God there's something wrong in your soul you haven't had a born again experience in your soul yes you're a Son of God coming forth and you see the word of God says I should do this I should be born again if you don't line up with that word there is something wrong your real father ain't God I'm trying to show you now whether you're an attribute of God or not the proph is pretty clear here right if you are not lining up with the word of God then it's clear you're not an attribute thought of God but if you are lining up with every word every word that's showing your you're the attribute of God you're the nature of God am because the Holy Spirit cannot deny his own word yes amen amen thank you Lord because that's the real start in your soul before there was ever even a spirit it was your soul that Soul didn't come from God then it wasn't a germ of God to begin with your received that's in things that are to be now one of the last messages he preaches hallelujah it's preached in December 5th 65 and he's preaching real deep things here now so you know amen hallelujah everybody okay amen you are not just a spirit you possess a soul yes amen and you have another body called theophany amen yes Hallelujah yes we may be accustomed to this body but you and I if we are what we just read there now an attribute of God we have a theophonic body amen hallelujah amen a theophonic body even the Apostle Paul says if the Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we already have one waiting amen amen hallelujah God has made preparation for us he's given us another body waiting for us amen hallelujah we step into our theopen body if we die in the flesh we step into our theopen body in that sixth Dimension Hallelujah Lord praise the Lord and what does a theophonic body do a theophonic body gives quality to our soul amen amen it amen it frees a theopen body will free our soul from deception amen will free our our souls amen from ception of the enemy from every false idea aop body knows all [Music] things a theop body knows all things Am Lord now you hear what I'm saying a theop body knows all things and we know that only God knows all things so this body must be an attribute of God thank you Lord amen Amen in order for us to function like God yes you remember what we spoke about when he said let us make man in our image talking image means his character his nature likeness means to function like him in order for us to function like God Amen the the angels that fell were spirits that came from the thoughts of God but they fell and they did not have a theophonic body amen hallelujah if they had a theophonic body they wouldn't have fallen because the theophonic body would have kept them from deception ition amen amen but what did it do it revealed the quality of their Spirit it was not an attribute of God they were not redeemable attributes but thank God you and I are redeemable attributes of God a Son of God can fall a thousand times but if is a redeemable attribute of God Amen God must bring him back to his original position hallelujah thank you Lord [Music] that's right how many of you feel redeemable amen hallelujah you know something break down you have to make a decision whether you're going to fix it or not whether it's worth fixing say ah maybe it's not worth fixing that means it's not redeemable you don't have value to it quality to it but if it's dear to you even if it cost you more than that thing was you will redeem it yes and it cost him his own life hallelujah amen cost him his own life thank you Lord the Mighty God unveiled before us he says but when he come Express exactly The Testament had said he would be expressed then all those who was redeemable believed it because they were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to God as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of God because they were redeemable amen they were from the beginning in the expression if we could stop here for a moment if it would be possible to think of that tonight of the message of the hour they express thought of Jehovah amen amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord the message of the hour is coming to reveal the expressed thoughts of Jehovah before the foundation of the world we were told our names were put on the book of life thank you Lord praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord now you know you got a spirit and a soul and if you want to know the nature of your spirit the soul is the nature of your spirit so if you have a filthy Spirit it tells you the nature of your soul yes if you have a Godly Spirit it tells you the nature of your soul amen amen so if you want to see the condition of your soul check your spirit because the soul is the nature of the spirit thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen let's go to the next quote amen this is the quote I want to dwell on because this is where I got my thought from amen we won't be much longer we're going to close shortly amen so everybody prop yourself up listen good amen amen if you need a change of hearing change your ears praise the Lord say Lord renew my ears yes amen he says now it's this stage of creation later formed into flesh Jesus from what from the great beginning spirit that came down to the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it just spoke out and mor later it becomes flesh Jesus to taste death for all of our sinners now what brother brand is trying to show you here the condescension of God how he came from Spirit to word to flesh right pay attention he says when Abraham met him he was mzc now we know mdic was an a theophonic body yes he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end all are you one of the attributes amen he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely Ely do the same thing amen but I want you to watch how we have to come also we see revealed in Ruth and Boaz the kinsman redeemer how he had to come to be flesh amen now we see the attribute sons of his Spirit right this is the title of my message now attributes sons of his Spirit we see the attributes sons of his spirit is God a spirit amen amen he God a spirit so his attribute Sons must be Spirit Sons that's why he's calling us attribute sons of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word form body a theophonic [Music] now the difference between him and you as his son at the beginning the word and in mhe body he came and lived in that in the person of MDC later we never heard no more of MDC because he became Jesus Christ mezic was the high was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that Hallelujah you bypass your theop body right because in that form he knowed all things so can we say if we in our theop we'll know all things yes cuz we one you just you just established that in that body in that form he know all things and you have never been able to know that yet so what do we [Music] need we need a for any body am praise the Lord you came like Adam like me you came from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we done now we don't understand it we have never become that word we've just become the flesh man not the word but look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning you can never come into your theophany unless you an attribute thought that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you a thought but remember not not a regular thought you have to be in the thinking first you see in order to stand Temptation that's why you can stand in Leia that's why you can stand in the midst of Satan's Eden and you won't be deceived because you're an attribute thought of God and when he had a thought of you he thought of you as somebody who will not fall in his age somebody give God praise that's an attribute God Amen when God thought about you he thought about you as somebody who is Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost coming into the word image again when God thought about you he thought about you as being the feminine part of him a perfect part that's the Eternal quality thought God had about you God saw you as somebody not falling God some saw you as somebody coming back to the God man the god image on the earth amen hallelujah that ought to make us rejoice amen hallelujah forget about your cality forget about the life you're living right now amen step into the rhythm of God step into the program of God God can change your life even now amen God can change your life even now Lord if you are too caught up in the caral say Lord I Surrender my life to you amen if you're too caught up in the Natural Things of Life say Lord I want to subscribe to your word and your program oh God I want to be everything that your word said I would be amen this is not the time Amen to be living a life of sin this is not the time amen when we should be wandering around in the world we should be coming back to Sons and Daughters of God thank you Lord amen this word ought to excite us we shouldn't be bored with the word of God but we should be excited amen the word has come to liberate us the word has come to give us an eternal quality thank you amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord Shake Yourself amen wake up yourself amen because this is talking about your Eternal Parts amen this is talking about you amen Lord thank you amen you say nobody understands you I'm showing you a part of yourself that you don't even understand nobody gets me I get you because I see the word of God Amen Hallelujah stop feeling sorry for yourself stop having a pretty party for yourself amen thank you Lord thank you go around confessing nobody likes you nobody loves you nobody understands me how about you get in line with God's word amen God understands you God knows about you sir amen you go around having a pretty party and telling everyone about your sad life and what a miserable life you have you'll continue living that miserable life because that's what you are confessing amen how about you change your confession amen amen amen praise the Lord you can only live the quality of life you're living is is the amen is reflecting the quality of your thoughts praise the Lord what paragraph we stop brother amen 60 69 okay he says let's see 70 and then you he came right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is to be put on the Lamb's Book book of life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear disappear then he become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in the glorified condition but you bypassed the theophany and became flesh man to be tempted by sin right he quotes the scripture again we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God Amen Hallelujah so I'm going to ask you a question have you received the Holy Ghost since you belied amen thank you Lord because he says here when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you he throws this body in subjection to God hallelujah then watch what it does now he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin yes Romans 8:1 there is therefore not no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit it throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if I could just just get in Christ it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they dead they are dead your sins are buried in baptism you are New Creation in Christ and your body becomes subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of life like you woman claiming you got the Holy Ghost going out there wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be so certainly it can't be he's not a filthy Spirit he's a holy spirit amen and when you become subject to that Spirit he throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest amen quickened made alive when the Bible said don't to this the body quickly turns to it there is no question and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and mire and Corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned Heavenly amen that's the earnest you're going in the Rapture the earnest is a down payment amen when you throw your body subject to the word of God somebody give God praise amen hallelujah so the word is not boring amen the word is something amen I aspire to be amen aspire to be grown into the image of the word thank you Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord why can't you let me live my own life amen why can't God just save me in my own nature God won't save you in your own nature he's made the way of Salvation you've got to come God's way AMJ you Lord people have gone lazy after seven Church ages at the climax of all things people want to live ordinary lives people want to be kindly in their nature people are not looking to be perfected they're not looking to become the statue of a perfect man but the prophet tells us that's the man that's going in the Rapture thank you the moment we got out of here amen we in the flesh again want to pull up our sleeves amen say anything coming out of our mouths amen hallelujah but when you're a holy ghost man when you're a holy ghost woman amen every word coming out of your mouth is controlled the Lord TS your tongue says keep quiet calm down yes I'm molding your character shaping your character a the most powerful man is the man who's in control of his emotions a man who's in control of his thoughts a man is composed control thank you Lord you think Adam was operating like some of us when he saw the lion CH you think he you're stupid thing come here I'll show you who you think you are you know who I am you think Adam was performing like that Adam was in control amen and you know we're in control have you seen these commanders youve seen somebody in top level they don't shout and scream and tell everyone y y he they speak one word you go to them and ask them something they just tell you no and you have to go away they in Authority amen they know the words carry power that's right amen if we are to come back to this man we've got to be in control amen control of your emotions you got to be in control of your faith your virtue your knowledge your Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness holy ghost coming down to seal you Hallelujah and then the Capstone of love comes down to settle upon you amen sometimes you want to say Lord let me step out of the pyramid man I want to show them who I am the pyramid man is restricting me me I'm from the barracks go back into the pyramid amen amen hallelujah amen statue of a perfect man is not the own nature stature of the perfect man is now Christ on two feet let them do what they want let them spit on you let them hit you that's why Jesus said they can Smite you on the cheek give them the other one also amen hallelujah they can kill the flesh but they can never kill that Eternal attribute of God amen amen amen know your worth thank you Amen to summarize now when God created man in a theophonic body that is why Adam could not be deceived yes the theophonic body frees you from deception amen amen the theophonic body gives quality to your soul it frees your soul from deception amen that is why we are waiting for our theophonic bodies to free us from this pest house amen this is our true pedigree our true class of people to be amen back in our word body amen thank you Lord now Adam before the fall had a higher level of Consciousness Adam before the fall had God mind yes higher level of conscious Consciousness amen that word means awareness or realization that means he knew all things that means he had the mind of Christ right God Consciousness amen he functioned like God his nature was like God he led the animals in the garden in that state he had the mind of Christ therefore he could name the Animals Adam was wasn't just naming them according to what he felt hadam at the mind of God Adam named them exactly what God's thoughts about those animals were oh yeah yes amen showing us how we are to function in this time and season if we claim to have the mind of Christ thank you Lord amen even though he was in a flesh body amen hallelujah which was a body like the animals there was something within him this is before the fall now that was higher than the flesh man that was the god part Amen in Adam amen when Adam fell he lost conscious consciousness of the higher part of himself yes brother Bram says he became unconscious to the fact he says all his channels became clogged up he became unconscious that's why we need the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost doesn't come Amen to to lead us to a life of sin but the Holy Ghost comes to Quicken us amen that we can see ourselves amen hallelujah as God sees us the Holy Ghost is a spirit of Truth the Holy Ghost is a guide the Holy Ghost is the teacher not showing you your humanistic realm but showing you God's thoughts about you amen thank you Lord Lord hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord

will you resist the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he's come to set you free amen yes praise the Lord thank you amen hallelujah Glory think about it in a theophonic body Adam had control over all things he was in a perfect condition couldn't sin couldn't fall why he was in a body that was not subject to that oh what a glorious body we're going back to amen hallelujah amen so there's another part of you in you when you got the Holy Ghost you get God's Consciousness back inside of you because what is the Holy Ghost the life of God the Life of Christ come upon the believer So when you say you got the Holy Ghost what are you really saying there's a God Consciousness part inside of me yes amen hallelujah you're a part of God a gene of God Amen you need to experience that part yes you need to experience it you need to know that there's a God part in me oh yes you need to know amen it's a being coming into you amen it's not something to think whether I got the holy ghost or wonder you'll know if you got the holy ghost or not you'll know the god part is within you amen praise the Lord amen the the Holy Ghost comes to connect you with that God part amen if that part is not there you'll live in the humanistic realm you'll die in the humanistic realm amen oh yes I do understand I do understand that there's three types of Believers right now amen hallelujah some of you want to that demon power is saying leave me in my unbelief there's three kinds of Believers leave me I hear you screaming out amen am some of you think this is a joke but this is another right here right now amen why would I say that right now yes amen there's demon power screaming out leave me because there's three kinds of Believers the make believer the unbeliever and then there's a genuine believer the attribute of God that I'm speaking to maybe I'm speaking to just a few here this morning I don't know I pray I'm speaking to everybody but I'm sent to the attribute sons of his Spirit sent to connect you back to your UT to be condition this you won't learn in a science class yes this you won't learn in a psychology class yes this is connecting you back to your original being amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen that is why you must receive the holy ghost at this time when you receive the Holy Ghost you become a two-fold being the holy spirit inside of of you as you receive the instruction from this being you are being led by the guide the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah am the Holy Ghost is the higher realm within you when you get into this realm then All Things become Possible

hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord amen praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen let's go to Revelation book of symbols amen preach 5661 17 Revelation book of symbols amen praise the Lord if you get it amen it's paragraph 55 hallelujah amen amen thank Jesus turn to your neighbor and ask them is he talking about you I'm talking about the attribute son of his Spirit ask him is he talking about you got it what does it say Angelic beings associate together thank you I hope you get that that just dropped right down free see even the property should get fresh anointing Angelic beings associate together and if you've got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural amen yes if you got the holy spirit in you you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural thank you no wonder people people can't believe in those things theyve never come in contemp right they've got nothing in there to believe with but when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes a two-fold being see what I'm telling you you got a higher being in you quickly he becomes a two-fold being one of the earth to die and one of Heaven to live any body is still subject to death but in his soul is passed from Death unto life in his body he has his Earthly contact with his five senses in his Spirit he has to contact with God through the Holy Ghost you see how you contact with God so what happens if you don't have the Holy Ghost you got no contact with God see in his body he has his Earthly contact with his five senses in his Spirit he has a contact with God through the Holy Ghost amen and the angels of God visits them thank you hello and the angels of God visits them speaks with them and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual is out to get the first thing first you can't put the Capa on before the foundation is laid that's

see he goes on in 56 telling you Angel how Daniel connected with the angel amen he'll go on and on and tell you that you are a candidate for association with the Angelic world for the supernatural world how many of you know angels are ministering Spirits sent to the ears of Salvation that's Bible what are ministering spirits to the ears of salvation meaning like when Elijah was out there in the wilderness and they brought him food they are ministering spirits to serve you amen yes you are an higher thought than an angel yes hello I know some of you when you die you think hey you put on Facebook and everywhere ah you got you you were the Angels now God took another Angel home no you are higher than an angel hey you are higher than an angel angels are ministering Spirits sent forth to the Airs of Salvation meaning that when you praying to God God will send his angels to minister to you yes amen so don't look to angels and pray to Angels Angels if I can say it in this way for a lack of a better word are here to serve you ministering Spirits because when Daniel Prayed both Gabriel and Michael came to his attention to his assistance amen praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord when you leave the service you must know who you are you must know you're an attribute son of his Spirit there's an eternal quality to you when you got the Holy Spirit there's another realm in you the higher consciousness of God thank you Lord it's the god part in knew so as long as Adam had this part this higher Consciousness he had unrestricted access to fellowship with God power over the Earth and eternal life and when you reading the gospels about Jesus Jesus came to show us amen the kind of Fellowship that Adam had with God am because when Jesus comes in St John 5:19 he says says the son can do nothing of himself but what he seees the father do that doeth the son likewise he came to show us the fellowship that existed with God in the beginning total Harmony now didn't he say as this fellow and pick up your pen and right doesn't he say as the grw at this fellowship with God so much the bride yes same John 5:19 must be able to say that we can do nothing except we see the father show us am amen praise the Lord amen so our faith will be perfected in this time our faith will be perfected in the season amen our faith is coming now to a level of perfection amen because we are receiving a word that has come to give us perfect Faith the message of the hour came specialized from Heaven Revelation 10 Mighty Angel bringing it down from heaven to give us rapturing faith we are
