[5:42] to be found in the house of
[5:44] God
[5:53] Amen before I go to that scripture let
[5:56] me thank you Lord
[6:02] the Book of Genesis 9:14
[6:07] says and it shall come to pass when I
[6:10] bring a cloud over the Earth that the
[6:12] bow shall be seen in the
[6:15] cloud Revelation 101 says and I saw
[6:18] another Mighty Angel come down from
[6:20] heaven fled with a cloud and a rainbow
[6:22] was upon his head in his face as it wear
[6:24] the Sun and his feet as PS of fire amen
[6:28] man you may be healed
[6:33] also turn to Isaiah
[6:37] 11:10 and in that day there shall be a
[6:40] root of Jesse which shall stand for an
[6:42] ins sign of the people to it shall the
[6:46] Gentile
[6:47] seek and his rest shall be
[6:52] glorious Psalm 64 says thou has given a
[6:56] banner to them that fear
[6:58] thee that it may be displayed because of
[7:02] the truth amen amen amen so tonight
[7:06] we're going to speak a little sermon
[7:08] that a continuation of Sunday's meeting
[7:11] if you call the inspiration on Sunday
[7:13] amen we're going to speak on the end
[7:15] sign and the banner displayed by the
[7:18] bride of
[7:19] Christ amen
[7:23] amen so we know that when God gave his
[7:26] Covenant to
[7:28] Noah what speaks about in Genesis amen
[7:32] and then we see in Revelation 10 he
[7:34] shows his Banner on display amen
[7:37] amen but remember now every time he's
[7:39] giving a covenant a rainbow is displayed
[7:42] amen
[7:44] amen
[7:46] so every time he's meeting his Prophet
[7:48] even when the prophet is going on his
[7:50] hunting and he's and he's having a
[7:52] supernatural experience he sees the
[7:54] rainbow amen you know the story of the
[7:57] storm and so forth
[8:00] so but this Prophet was hunting a
[8:02] rainbow trout yes amen and he's fishing
[8:07] but she's not coming under the first two
[8:09] pools it was the third pool that caught
[8:12] attention amen yes it was the third pool
[8:15] that catches this rainbow trout yes
[8:17] because she's associated with this
[8:19] Covenant amen amen and the purpose of
[8:22] that that Covenant give to knowah about
[8:24] Father's bride yes amen because in this
[8:27] Covenant
[8:29] because remember God destroyed that
[8:32] Earth in the days of Noah that world
[8:35] sorry that world in the days of
[8:38] Noah and then over on to this world
[8:41] now when Noah is coming to this world he
[8:44] gives him a
[8:45] covenant and he say when you see this
[8:47] bow again amen you must that is Covenant
[8:49] yes and there it's on display again in
[8:51] Revelation 10 amen but this time it's
[8:54] coming with a title
[8:56] Deeds because there's going to be a
[8:58] people that's is going to go back to the
[9:01] original condition yes that title was
[9:05] that was forfeit is these people are
[9:07] going to go back to the original
[9:08] condition but this people is a covenant
[9:11] people yes amen therefore the prophet
[9:15] calls them the rainbow
[9:17] trouts and when he's fishing and he's
[9:20] putting the bait the purpose of the bait
[9:22] is catching other fishes not C to catch
[9:24] the other fishes but the bait is
[9:26] catching the other fishes but under the
[9:28] third pool amen comes forth the rainbow
[9:31] trouts yes amen because in the last days
[9:34] there must be an end sign again yes and
[9:37] the banner must be displayed again but
[9:40] this time the banner must be displayed
[9:42] to the bride of Christ yes amen and we
[9:45] know that that Banner was displayed in
[9:48] Jesus Christ that Banner was displayed
[9:51] to the prophets but it must come again
[9:53] because there's a covenant
[9:56] amen and this Covenant is a i word
[9:58] covenant yes hallelujah amen this
[10:01] Covenant is Not By Any man amen but it's
[10:03] by God
[10:05] Amen so we find that the end sign and
[10:09] the banner displayed by the bride of
[10:11] Christ in his last days amen we know
[10:14] Sunday's message the pastor Adan was
[10:17] preaching about how a banner is a
[10:21] visible is a standard raised amen amen
[10:24] is a standard rais to Rally people amen
[10:27] like in a time of War amen
[10:30] and it signifying identity and Authority
[10:34] amen amen so when this Banner was
[10:38] displayed in this time in Revelation 101
[10:41] it was giving us our true identification
[10:44] yes amen amen and when the title of the
[10:47] book comes down is now giving us the
[10:49] authority amen amen that's why the
[10:53] scripture says Thou must prophesy again
[10:55] yes amen because there's names in the
[10:58] book yes right and there's a people
[11:00] that's given an identity recognizing
[11:04] that they have the DNA of God that they
[11:08] are Sons and Daughters of God through
[11:11] spiritual Amnesia they for they didn't
[11:14] realize the true identity they were
[11:16] strapped in the chicken
[11:18] bards but the identity were of the eagle
[11:22] nature it was an Heavenly identity it
[11:25] wasn't an Earthly identity amen amen but
[11:30] your identity that you knew was because
[11:32] to the sex birth brought to an Earthly
[11:35] body to a flesh body a temporary body
[11:39] you recognize that identity all the days
[11:41] of your life until the day Revelation
[11:44] suck you amen amen but when Revelation
[11:47] struck you your life began to change
[11:51] amen because why it was the transforming
[11:53] power of the word that you be not
[11:56] conformed any longer to the pattern of
[11:59] this world but be transformed by the
[12:02] renewing of your
[12:04] mind because now the mind is the
[12:07] betterle ground the mind is no man's
[12:09] land the the the thing that you was
[12:12] craving for the thing that you was
[12:13] always feeling for that was of God but
[12:16] Satan come to play that part of the mind
[12:19] and he give you other things to satisfy
[12:21] your needs yes but those are only
[12:25] temporary satisfaction amen God wants to
[12:29] redeem you from this Earthly nature
[12:32] because you're an Heavenly being amen
[12:34] you are part of him you come from God
[12:37] and you have to go back to
[12:39] God so you got to be the ins sign in
[12:42] this hour and you got to raise the
[12:44] banner in his hour amen amen thank you
[12:48] Lord amen Isaiah 11:10 says in in Isaiah
[12:53] 10 1110 he says we know Isaiah is
[12:55] speaking of Christ as the root of Jesse
[12:58] and he he he's the one would stand as an
[13:01] end sign for the people yeah so we know
[13:04] that scripture is drawing reference to
[13:07] Jesus Christ amen amen because Jesus
[13:11] Christ is the key amen yes he is the
[13:16] image yes and when Christ is on display
[13:19] that's the image we attain to be amen
[13:22] amen because why he was the first born
[13:26] of the new creation yes amen amen amen
[13:30] because he come to deliver you from
[13:32] being in a fallen condition he come to
[13:35] deliver you from being Hur
[13:38] bounden
[13:40] amen we know the prophet of God always
[13:42] emphasize that Christ is a fulfillment
[13:45] of that prophecy yes amen and Christ is
[13:49] the the point of where we as Believers
[13:52] where the elected must be gathered yes
[13:54] and who is Christ Christ is the words
[13:57] and he stands at the as the sign of
[14:00] God's salvation to mankind yes and we
[14:04] are gathered to him amen which is the
[14:07] words so who remains the central focus
[14:10] is always Christ amen amen amen and he
[14:13] is the one in whom the bride must be
[14:15] fully
[14:16] identified we must be identified in
[14:19] Christ it's always the identified Christ
[14:21] in all ages yes so we must be fully
[14:25] identified with Christ and when Christ
[14:28] was on
[14:29] he identif identified himself as the Son
[14:32] of God
[14:34] yes and that's why the Jews sought to
[14:36] kill him yes because he made himself
[14:40] God so if you identified with
[14:44] Christ then what DNA you got amen what
[14:48] power you possess
[14:50] amen so we know the inside is
[14:53] Christ so the bride will be nothing
[14:55] short of
[14:56] Christ because if we come he said many
[15:00] have come to me in that day said Lord
[15:02] have I not prophesied in Your
[15:04] Name Lord have not cast out demons in
[15:06] your name he said depart from me workers
[15:08] of iniquity I know you
[15:10] not this bride must come into Oneness
[15:13] with him his father he said father may
[15:17] they be one even as we are one amen
[15:21] there must be such a oness like how he
[15:23] said he said I've been so long with you
[15:26] Philip and you have not known me yes you
[15:29] have seen me you have seen the
[15:32] father so if the people see you they
[15:35] must see Christ when people have a
[15:38] thirst and anger and crying out for
[15:41] Christ in this dying generation in this
[15:45] generation of gross darkness when they
[15:47] see you they must see Christ the
[15:49] anointed one in this hour amen the
[15:52] anointed people in this hour hallelujah
[15:55] amen yes and that must be the that must
[15:59] be
[16:01] raised amen when you are gathered to him
[16:04] the reveal word in this
[16:06] [Music]
[16:07] hour so we are the ones that are we have
[16:11] the banner of Truth displayed yes nobody
[16:13] else has the banner of truth yes there
[16:15] is no half truths in the gospel amen
[16:18] that's right people might have certain
[16:20] uh fundamental knowledge of the Gospel
[16:24] yes but there is no truth yes all the
[16:28] world has been revealed in this hour
[16:31] amen the seals have been broke the book
[16:34] is opened amen hallelujah nothing is
[16:37] left out
[16:39] yes amen so we are Jesus said the truth
[16:44] shall set you free the word is Tru amen
[16:49] amen so if you are so people are in
[16:51] bondage in this world the reason why
[16:54] they are in bondage the reason why
[16:56] people are have hostage in this world
[17:00] by Satan's domain is because they don't
[17:02] have truths amen but the only thing that
[17:05] can set them free is the truth amen but
[17:09] the bride has that
[17:11] Banner
[17:16] amen and she has to raise that Banner
[17:19] amen
[17:22] yes Psalm 64 says thou has given a
[17:26] banner to them that fear thee
[17:29] that it may be displayed because of the
[17:33] truth
[17:34] amen amen so here's P speaking about God
[17:39] is giving a banner to those that fear
[17:41] Him yes and he displayed because of
[17:44] Truth amen so the bride is also given a
[17:48] banner to wave in his last days yes
[17:50] representing the truth of God's word
[17:53] thank you Lord It's
[17:55] undiluted unpolluted amen amen
[18:01] which she doesn't compromise with the
[18:03] word she holds a banner of Truth High
[18:06] yes she's not going to deny any word
[18:10] amen while the word is while the world
[18:13] is drifting
[18:14] away into
[18:16] confusion while they given into false
[18:19] doctrines while they compromising with
[18:21] the world the bride holds firm and holds
[18:25] the word of God in its
[18:27] purity amen and that's why it's a
[18:31] declaration that she stands for the full
[18:33] revelation of Christ in this hour
[18:35] because she is the mar priest of Jesus
[18:42] Christ amen she's going to be the
[18:44] standard raised in his hour amen I'm not
[18:47] talking
[18:48] about written word I'm talking about a
[18:52] manifested word amen the standard that
[18:55] is raised is the manifestation of the
[18:58] word Upon A people amen thank you Lord
[19:01] amen there must be a manifestation of
[19:04] the
[19:06] word but he has a role to play amen he
[19:09] says yeah yeah it is after he going away
[19:14] he said I will not leave you
[19:16] comfortless I'll give you another ins
[19:19] sign yes if I be lifted from the earth
[19:22] I'll draw all men unto me and the things
[19:25] that I do shall you do even greater than
[19:29] this John 14:12 for I go unto my father
[19:33] and he commissioned human beings to go
[19:36] all the world and preach the gospel
[19:41] amen and
[19:43] demonstrates see what he say he's not
[19:45] just talking about preaching as in
[19:48] talking but he's talking about also
[19:49] demonstration now and demonstrate the
[19:54] power of the Holy
[19:56] Ghost until when until the days of
[19:59] William
[20:00] Brenham no he says until he returns amen
[20:05] as a sign yes is God's provided
[20:10] sacrifice

[20:34] little while and the world will see me
[20:36] no more yet you shall see me for I will
[20:40] be with you even in you Amen to the end
[20:44] of the world yes amen so there's no
[20:47] question there's no there's no stop
[20:50] there there's no full stop there amen
[20:52] it's until the Jesus comes again amen
[20:55] yes and takes away his bride so there
[20:58] must be an end time position for the
[21:00] bride amen there must be a a bride

[24:14] the standard bearer of the Gospel nobody
[24:17] else can claim to be Christians in this
[24:19] hour nobody else can have claim to say
[24:22] that they are have the standard they are
[24:23] the standard bearer of the Gospel do you
[24:26] hear what I'm saying amen is only with
[24:29] the brides she has the only she's the
[24:31] only one with the authority that's why
[24:33] you can say she is the final voice the
[24:36] final age because she's come under a
[24:39] messenger they rejected the messenger
[24:42] they miss the key of the age they cannot
[24:44] become the final voice amen
[24:47] yes that's why she has the standard in
[24:50] this
[24:53] hour that's why we are the call out
[24:55] group and there's a responsibility on us
[24:57] to live this can die amen amen
[25:01] amen there's a responsibility in is hour
[25:05] you know Jesus gave the illustration of
[25:07] the man with with talents yes in Matthew
[25:10] 25 he's speaking about giving them
[25:12] talents amen yes because what he was
[25:15] trying to show you that he left them
[25:17] with a
[25:19] responsibility amen amen that they own
[25:23] sh in that
[25:25] hour the Bible much is given much is
[25:28] requ
[25:31] required so we find that the world will
[25:34] not will now know
[25:36] Christ how by seeing his reflection in
[25:39] the bride yes the very image she must
[25:43] come to that image amen she must be in
[25:46] that image in such a manner that when
[25:48] they look at her they will be so
[25:50] astonished at this people
[25:53] yes you might look like every other
[25:56] human being but I'm talking about when
[25:58] you are now speaking in Authority I'm
[26:00] not talking about your normal everyday
[26:02] conversation now you know what I'm
[26:03] talking about under that anointing and
[26:06] under when you are facing a challenge or
[26:08] somebody is facing a challenge and you
[26:10] are before them and you recognize demon
[26:12] powers or you recognize the need for the
[26:14] day and you are facing the challenge but
[26:16] you are now speaking as one with
[26:17] authority yes amen that's right you
[26:21] understand what I'm trying to say Amen
[26:22] we are living we are in this world but
[26:24] we are not of this world in other words
[26:26] in this world we be like normal c times
[26:29] but there's certain times when the
[26:30] anointing comes on us there's a certain
[26:32] times where we got to now pull our
[26:34] shoulders together we got to stand firm
[26:36] and recognize who we are and recognize
[26:39] what we displaying amen amen we got to
[26:42] face the Enemy by being courageous yes
[26:46] amen we we can't be the one that being
[26:47] afraid of the enemy we got to be
[26:49] courageous in this hour you got to run
[26:51] towards the enemy not run away from the
[26:53] enemy
[26:55] am amen when David fac gol R towards
[26:59] him
[27:05] amen so there's a
[27:07] responsibility Shing is running away
[27:10] from your responsibility yes but if you
[27:13] have responsibility you face the enemy
[27:18] amen so we find that in this hour we are
[27:22] we are called out to have this high
[27:24] standard amen yes and therefore the the
[27:27] word is coming out why we
[27:30] must why we must separate ourselves why
[27:33] we must separate seclude ourselves to
[27:35] fasting to prayer to to the word to the
[27:38] reading of the word of God Amen there's
[27:40] a reason for all of this right because
[27:42] there's a standard that has to be set
[27:45] yes and trust me we're not living in a
[27:47] time where it's easy right in the times
[27:51] when the martys were
[27:53] killed it was easy in that time to go
[27:57] read the word of God to pray to have all
[27:59] the things but say now when you got the
[28:01] all of Hell on the
[28:03] earth and Satan is now advanc himself he
[28:07] knows how to infiltrate you that is why
[28:10] this is the hour to be under
[28:13] covering this is the hour where you
[28:15] cannot be alone and say no I'm a one man
[28:18] man this is the hour to have a body
[28:20] Ministry amen this is the hour to
[28:22] recognize that I'm part of the body of
[28:25] Christ amen I have a different anointing
[28:28] in his body and my anointing can take
[28:30] you to that level but there's another
[28:32] anointing in part of the body goes to
[28:35] another level amen amen God has
[28:36] different gifts in the body yes but the
[28:38] body is fly framed together amen each
[28:41] one needs the other and each one is
[28:44] carrying out the Mandate of Christ and
[28:46] this entire body of Christ becomes the
[28:48] banner of Christ in this hour amen she
[28:50] becomes the inside in this hour yes
[28:53] thank you
[28:54] Lord
[28:56] amen so we find in this hour when the
[28:58] bride is coming to a position we're not
[29:00] going to say when she's going to come
[29:02] into a position she's already coming
[29:04] into a position yes she's now because we
[29:07] can see the season has changed now amen
[29:10] there's a change of seon we got to
[29:12] recognize yes that the bride is now
[29:15] positionally she's in a position now
[29:17] amen we can't we can't use it we can't
[29:20] take it now because it want us prophecy
[29:22] when the Bride Comes to a position but
[29:25] now that the bride is in a position yeah
[29:28] in this hour because the season already
[29:30] opened
[29:31] amen then she must be the true
[29:33] reflection of Christ because she has a
[29:35] quick short work to do yes amen it's not
[29:39] a long work amen it's a quick short work
[29:46] amen and we know that the world was
[29:48] always looking for the inside even in
[29:50] every St in every time even now people
[29:53] are looking for something you find them
[29:55] all over YouTube and so forth they're
[29:57] waiting they look looking at events
[29:58] they're looking at all the things Happ
[30:00] and they know that they don't have the
[30:02] truth but they know that something is
[30:04] taking
[30:06] place and they know that something has
[30:08] to happen but many have missed the mark
[30:11] That's Right amen that it was an
[30:13] invisible Union already taking place and
[30:16] the people was having the mechanics the
[30:18] mechanics the mechanics but what they
[30:20] miss right now the re filling of the
[30:22] Holy Spirit upon the church the Dynamics
[30:25] are here in the church the Dynamics are
[30:28] yeah but it's in such Simplicity that
[30:30] people miss the mark
[30:32] yes amen God has always work in
[30:35] Simplicity yes and people don't like
[30:37] that they like some some big thing to
[30:39] happen but when God is doing the
[30:41] supernatural in such Simplicity they are
[30:44] missing it true
[30:49] amen but the bride must not fail in the
[30:52] responsibility to show Christ to the
[30:54] Nations amen amen through our life
[30:59] through a character yes they identified
[31:01] Christ through the bride the image of
[31:04] Christ

[31:07] must prophesy again before Nation time
[31:11] amen Romans 8:29 says for for whom he
[31:16] did Forno he also did predestinate to be
[31:18] conformed to the image of his
[31:20] son amen so it was God's for knowledge
[31:24] by predestination God already had
[31:28] those that had his DNA those that were
[31:30] in his thoughts he already form you and
[31:33] he predestinated you to be conformed yes
[31:37] why arst can't
[31:39] conform because they don't have the DNA
[31:42] right amen yeah like I was telling
[31:45] brother Adrian if if I am breeding a
[31:48] pedigree

[31:54] pups pups are
[31:56] born people want to see what the parents

[32:59] perfect son yes amen he showed us he

[33:20] of Christ the apostles watched it they
[33:23] knew that he manifested this they knew
[33:24] the types of things he was manifesting
[33:26] and therefore they knew that they
[33:28] Ministry must also have that
[33:31] manifestation they could walk in that
[33:33] confidence because they was walking with

[35:14] identified when we got this
[35:16] identification showing us our true
[35:18] identity yes and giving us the D what

[35:22] change once you were walking in a
[35:24] different way you were walking in the
[35:25] pattern of the world you forming to the

[36:26] bothered about the thing of the world
[36:29] you are no long longer living in fear
[36:31] you no longer living in anxiety you're
[36:33] no longer living how you used to live
[36:35] amen you look at things in the different
[36:37] lives
[36:42] yes we find
[36:44] that Romans 8:15 says for we have not
[36:47] received the spirit of bondage again to
[36:49] fear but we have received the spirit of
[36:52] adoption yes whereby we cry AB father
[36:56] amen
[36:58] now we know the prophet always
[37:00] emphasized the relationship between God
[37:03] and his
[37:04] bride as our father and children amen we
[37:08] know that God had always had in the back
[37:10] part of his mind to have a family yes
[37:13] and right now the family is being
[37:15] displayed amen
[37:17] yes and God is satisfied he must come to
[37:21] a state where God says I am satisfied
[37:23] with my family amen amen I have
[37:26] confidence in my family
[37:28] amen because we didn't receive we have
[37:32] received I mean in this hour the spirit
[37:34] of adoption yes that we no longer a
[37:39] stranger but a child of God amen amen
[37:42] Growing Up From Grace unto Grace from
[37:45] Glory unto glory amen amen thank you
[37:48] Lord and the Holy Spirit bring you into
[37:51] spiritual maturity and how is he doing
[37:53] that to the five-fold ministry Ephesians
[37:56] 4 amen burning up this church for what
[37:59] and how do you do this it's it's an
[38:01] intimate relationship you only can have
[38:04] an intimate relationship because you
[38:06] have
[38:07] Fellowship you have communion amen and
[38:10] the more you spend time with someone you
[38:13] have intimate relationship so the more
[38:14] you spend time with God then only you
[38:16] can have an intimate relationship yes if
[38:19] you are knowing god once in a while and
[38:22] you can't call it an intimate
[38:23] relationship there's no Intimacy in it
[38:26] if there's no prayer life there's no
[38:28] intimacy right you can't be saying you
[38:31] have an intimate relationship with
[38:32] Christ if there's no prayer life that
[38:35] means if there's no prayer life mean
[38:36] you're not even talking to him how do
[38:39] you commun him prayer is a
[38:42] communication prayer is a channel of
[38:44] communication people people look at
[38:46] prayer and they look it at some
[38:48] religious acts but it's a
[38:51] communication it's a communication
[38:53] Channel between you and God
[38:57] and it's also a channel that you use
[39:00] where ministering spirits will take what
[39:03] you're praying and take charge over
[39:04] those things
[39:06] yes and it's also a channel where the
[39:09] devil recognize who's your connection
[39:11] with now yes amen right amen and then
[39:16] when you start giving out command you
[39:17] start casting out spirits and you start
[39:19] dealing with spirits and the angels take
[39:22] charge over those things then you find
[39:24] time demon fing amen yes when the devil
[39:27] recognize these people recognize who
[39:28] they are amen they have a communication
[39:31] with their father I'm in trouble now yes
[39:35] because if I do anything to them they're
[39:37] going to communicate with their father
[39:39] but if the devil know this person don't
[39:41] communicate with his
[39:43] father he hasn't had commun communion
[39:45] with his father in a long time I can
[39:47] take it I can go there and I can
[39:49] interfere with him because he won't even
[39:50] know how to talk to his
[39:52] father because you know what it is when
[39:54] you see someone after one year two years
[39:56] couple of months you don't have a you
[39:58] can't just communicate to them and ask
[40:00] them for something it takes time amen so
[40:04] you see the importance of this of a
[40:05] prayer life you see the important of
[40:07] communication it's intimacy with God
[40:10] Amen then if you don't praise him you
[40:13] don't worship him you don't you don't
[40:16] have this relationship with him right
[40:18] then how can you have confidence to ask
[40:21] him yes amen then you'll be like you
[40:24] just God is just someone you just use
[40:26] give me this give me give me that give
[40:28] me this give me that then you'll be like
[40:30] the
[40:32] denomination we are not called to that
[40:34] we are the standard bears in this hour
[40:36] yes amen we have the standard of we bear
[40:39] the standard of the Gospel in this hour
[40:41] yes amen amen and the standard is not
[40:44] the highest standard is Jesus
[40:46] Christ he was the highest standard set
[40:49] amen glory
[40:51] amen and we found that in this day the
[40:54] person that found that secret and
[40:55] followed the pattern was William
[40:58] amen and therefore he had success in his
[41:00] ministry amen and if you want to have
[41:03] good success at the Book of Joshua says
[41:06] then you must you can't turn to the left
[41:08] you can't turn to the right you keep his
[41:10] word
[41:14] amen so we find that our identity is not
[41:17] just in our
[41:19] position but also in our relationship
[41:22] with
[41:23] God as our father amen because now not
[41:27] just saying I've just got
[41:29] inheritance he not just I got I got I
[41:32] inherited something but you come to
[41:34] realize that he's your father yes it's a
[41:37] relationship of father son father
[41:39] daughter
[41:41] relationship you follow what I'm saying
[41:43] he's not just saying I inherited
[41:45] something but it's come to
[41:47] recognize that God is my
[41:52] father and if God is my
[41:55] father then I must manifest his
[41:57] characteristics yes sir and if his
[42:00] characteristic was fully manifested in
[42:02] Jesus Christ and that was the image and
[42:06] there was a there was a person on this
[42:09] day a Son of God named William brandham
[42:11] who come into that full image into such
[42:13] a way that in such a manner that people
[42:15] must look him for Christ that's right
[42:18] then there must be another people on the
[42:20] Earth that must come into that image
[42:22] amen amen amen and if you come into the
[42:25] image then that same Jesus Jus the same
[42:28] works of Jesus that was there with
[42:30] William brand must be displayed amongst
[42:32] you and I amen amen because he's the
[42:35] same yesterday today and forever
[42:40] am
[42:44] amen aren't you glad that God had to
[42:46] show us an example in this hour yes amen
[42:50] something that a standard that we could
[42:52] look up to amen right but now it's up to
[42:57] us amen that he's given us his open word
[43:00] amen he's given us his entire the
[43:03] entirety of his word he would have
[43:05] nothing from us amen the very book that
[43:09] was no one was even found worthy to look
[43:11] upon you are instructed not to take the
[43:14] book Amen to eat to partake of it yes
[43:19] that the very the very word that you're
[43:21] eating you are coming to an image now
[43:23] yes right all of that word is now
[43:27] within
[43:29] you because you are called to be the
[43:31] Temple of the Holy Ghost in the hour
[43:34] amen
[43:36] amen we must reflect the identify Christ
[43:39] in the hour
[43:42] amen so we
[43:44] must we must reflect the glory of of
[43:47] Christ in this hour because we know sh
[43:50] glory is dwelling now in bright form
[43:53] amen amen yes dwelling in the temple of
[43:56] men dwelling now Christ in bright form
[44:00] the glory must be displayed in his hour
[44:08] yes so you find you know the scripture
[44:11] says as we behold the word the glass
[44:15] amen yes we are changing into His Image
[44:19] as we behold the glass which is the word
[44:21] amen right we are changing into His
[44:23] Image moving from one level of Glory to
[44:26] another
[44:27] amen you cannot stay in yday in the form
[44:30] of Glory you must progress amen amen
[44:33] it's one level of Glory to
[44:38] another so we must reflect Christ in all
[44:42] aspects of our life yes Amen in love in
[44:45] brotherly love amen because why you
[44:50] recognize that I can't do without my
[44:53] brother if if that arm is missing then
[44:55] his body can't function
[44:57] if I'm just the legs I also need the
[44:59] arms right I need the other part of the
[45:02] body I need every part of the body
[45:05] because until we stand as a body then we
[45:07] can't have that Perfect Image with the
[45:09] head yes becoming subject to the head
[45:13] cuz now if you're taking one part of the
[45:14] body out then you can't come subject to
[45:16] the head cuz God doesn't have an
[45:18] abnormal body he has a perfect body amen
[45:22] he has a perfect sinless spotless bride
[45:25] without spot without wrinkle without
[45:27] blemish yes he has got a super Church a
[45:30] super race an invincible Army
[45:33] amen amen so we must display that we
[45:36] must display true Holiness in this hour
[45:38] amen we must display the
[45:40] truth and the power amen amen thank you
[45:44] Lord because many are denying the power
[45:49] amen so this identification is not
[45:52] something superficial we just talk about

[45:57] transformed by amen and he touches every
[46:00] area of our life

[46:05] way that is not something that when we

[46:54] word of life to them amen
[46:57] that's what the world needs now amen cuz
[47:00] they have no hope
[47:02] right Grace upon the Earth is only with

[47:10] depending on you to carry out his
[47:12] business we got to be about our father's
[47:15] business yes I mean God Christ come to
[47:19] do his part because he was the first
[47:21] born of the new creation so he knows
[47:24] that there has to be a people that will
[47:26] continue the work
[47:28] God is not going to come down physically
[47:30] now and do the work
[47:31] himself yes he's dwelling in you his
[47:34] spirit is in
[47:35] you he's relying upon you yes there's a

[49:02] or they need
[49:03] prayer but you got no power because
[49:06] you're not endured with power from an

[59:33] manner spake in time pass unto the
[59:35] fathers by the prophet and in had in his
[59:38] last days spoken to unto us by his son
[59:41] whom he had appointed air of All Things
[59:42] by whom also he made the world who being
[59:46] the brightness of his glory and the
[59:49] expressed image of his
[59:51] person upholding All Things by the word
[59:53] of his power when he had by himself
[59:56] purged our sin sat down in the right
[59:59] hand of the Majesty on high being made
[1:00:03] so much better than the
[1:00:05] angels as he had by inheritance obtained
[1:00:08] a more excellent Name than they then
[1:00:11] whose name do you have right
[1:00:13] now it's a more excellent Name than the
[1:00:16] Angels yes no wonder Satan is jealous of
[1:00:19] you no wonder Satan can't stand
[1:00:22] you when you recognize your true
[1:00:25] identity
[1:00:27] he didn't have a problem with you when
[1:00:28] you had Amnesia when you had you in the
[1:00:30] world but now that you recognize your
[1:00:32] true identity he has a problem with you
[1:00:35] forto which of the Angels said ye at any
[1:00:37] time Thou Art my
[1:00:39] son That's what Satan can't
[1:00:43] stand this day of I begotten the and
[1:00:46] again I will be to him a father and he
[1:00:48] shall be to me a son Satan can't stand
[1:00:52] that that God is telling you
[1:00:56] that I will be to you a father because
[1:00:58] remember he saying this to Christ that
[1:01:00] he was doing to Christ sing it to you
[1:01:02] yes amen and he shall be to me a son he
[1:01:05] never said that to the
[1:01:06] angels only we have that
[1:01:09] privilege amen and again when he bring
[1:01:11] it in the first begot into the world he
[1:01:13] said and let all the angels of God
[1:01:16] worship Him and of the Angel he sth he
[1:01:19] said who make it his Angel spirits and
[1:01:21] his ministers a flame of fire but under
[1:01:24] the sun he said thy throne know God is
[1:01:27] forever and ever a scepter of
[1:01:29] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[1:01:31] kingdom thou has love righteousness and

[1:01:44] thou Lord in the beginning has laid the
[1:01:45] foundation of the earth and the heavens
[1:01:47] are the work of thy hands so you see
[1:01:50] what you see how great this is
