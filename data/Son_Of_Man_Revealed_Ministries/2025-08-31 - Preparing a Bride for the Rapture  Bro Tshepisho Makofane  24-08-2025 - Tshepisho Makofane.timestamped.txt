[0:00] [music]
[0:01] Amen.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Greet you all in the precious name
[0:05] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. You
[0:07] may be seated. The Lord bless you.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know we felt the pull. We felt
[0:13] the tug in our souls, in our hearts to
[0:16] respond to the word of the Lord for the
[0:18] day
[0:19] &gt;&gt; and this time and season. Amen.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, is everyone good in the house
[0:26] of the Lord?
[0:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be back in the
[0:29] house of the Lord to worship him
[0:30] &gt;&gt; and
[0:30] &gt;&gt; give him praise. Amen. You know the
[0:33] Bible says
[0:35] in the book of second Peter chapter 3,
[0:38] just want to read this.
[0:46] It says the second epistle, beloved, and
[0:49] I write unto you in both which I stir up
[0:52] your pure minds by the way of
[0:53] remembrance
[0:54] &gt;&gt; that you be mindful of the words which
[0:56] are spoken before by the holy prophets.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; I want you to include William Brandham
[1:01] there.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; I'm saying that for a reason
[1:06] &gt;&gt; in this church we are under the
[1:09] prophetic ministry
[1:10] &gt;&gt; of William Brandom.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we under our messenger
[1:15] become the final voice to the final age.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "And of and of the commandment
[1:23] of us, the apostles of the Lord and
[1:26] Savior, knowing this first, that there
[1:28] shall come in the last days scoffers,
[1:31] &gt;&gt; walking after their own lust."
[1:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. People not designed and called to
[1:37] be in ministry.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; But they're lusting after things and
[1:40] they're there. So if there were scoffers
[1:42] of the first coming, there would be
[1:44] scoffers of the second coming.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; There must be scoffers of the seventh
[1:48] seal.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And saying where is the promise of
[1:51] his coming? For since the fathers fell
[1:54] asleep, all things continue as they were
[1:57] from the beginning of the creation.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; So we are finding the same pattern
[2:01] again. When history has already
[2:04] fulfilled, scriptures have already
[2:06] passed by. People that were never even
[2:08] born then are now disputing things that
[2:11] happened and now son of man ministry is
[2:13] revealed through the prophet.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; They never got to witness the sign with
[2:17] the back turn to the audience
[2:20] &gt;&gt; discernment.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was that? If you're looking
[2:23] at a man, you missed the picture.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; You had to see Christ veil behind the
[2:27] man
[2:28] &gt;&gt; because no man can do that.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[2:30] &gt;&gt; So people are denominating around the
[2:32] wrong messenger.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. When brother Brandham says I
[2:36] must decrease, he must increase. Christ
[2:39] himself is the messenger that has come
[2:41] to his bride to his people to connect
[2:43] with them.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; So these sculptors are saying where is
[2:46] the promise of his coming? Now in this
[2:48] season I want to bring you up to date.
[2:49] The promise of his coming is the shout.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; The shout is for the living saints.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; You miss the shout, you miss the
[2:55] rapture.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; The voice is for the sleeping saints.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Since the fathers
[3:02] fell asleep, all things continue as they
[3:05] were from the beginning of create
[3:07] creation. For this they willingly are
[3:09] ignorant of that by the word of God, the
[3:12] heavens were whole."
[3:14] And the earth standing out of the water
[3:16] and in the water. Amen. I want to get to
[3:19] verse 9. And I want you to take comfort
[3:21] in his words that the Lord is not slack
[3:24] &gt;&gt; concerning his promise. Amen.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know how close we are to him
[3:29] coming to change our bodies and take us
[3:31] away?
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; More time has passed
[3:38] &gt;&gt; behind us the history and we are this
[3:41] close.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; To that body change. So hold on. The
[3:44] Lord is not slack concerning his promise
[3:46] as some men count slackness but is
[3:49] longsuffering to us would not willing
[3:51] that any should perish but that all
[3:53] should come to repentance. But the day
[3:55] of the Lord, which shall come as a thief
[3:57] in the night, in which the heavens shall
[3:59] pass away with a great noise, and the
[4:01] elements shall melt with fervent heat,
[4:03] and the earth also, and the works that
[4:05] are there in shall be burned up. So what
[4:07] you are seeing now when people are are
[4:08] leaving the message and people are
[4:10] speaking against this. Remember what the
[4:13] Lord says, I'll send the angels first
[4:16] &gt;&gt; and I'll take the tears away first.
[4:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Nobody cla can claim they left the
[4:22] message. What happened was an angel came
[4:24] and plucked the tail.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; So when they post up post there on
[4:30] YouTube why I left the message, they
[4:32] must change those titles.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; The angel pluck me up because I'm a
[4:39] tear.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; That's what they should be saying.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Now scripture can't be broken. The Lord
[4:44] says, "Let them both grow together at
[4:46] harvest time. I'll send my angels and
[4:48] I'll pluck the tears out first."
[4:50] &gt;&gt; So don't be discouraged. You'll hear
[4:51] more and more people leaving and more
[4:53] and more people criticizing and more and
[4:54] more they did it with Jesus. Even
[4:56] through today, they dispute whether
[4:58] Jesus actually came. They dispute
[5:00] whether he rose again.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; So spirits don't die.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; So I I want to encourage you to remain
[5:08] fervent in the faith.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; Don't be slack. Don't be missing church.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Not in this time and season.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're all the way up in the
[5:16] headstone now welcoming the the
[5:18] bridegroom.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember we have to be those
[5:20] connecting stones. Brother Brandham says
[5:22] we are like that flange coming to that
[5:24] needle point.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Uniting with the groom.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; So we are so excited. Amen. That we have
[5:31] recognized the word for our day and the
[5:33] message for our day.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning we want to welcome
[5:37] you and we've got sister Lwanda visiting
[5:39] with us this morning. Amen. Let's
[5:40] welcome our sister Lwanda. [applause]
[5:42] Amen.
[5:46] So bless you sister. Did you come up
[5:47] with a show? Yes.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. God bless you. Welcome. Amen. Then
[5:53] we're happy to see our friend and our
[5:55] brother. Amen. Brothers Sopiso Makuan.
[5:59] Amen. So we met him four years ago.
[6:01] Amen. When he took those Easter meetings
[6:03] there nearbank and uh Amen. The Lord has
[6:06] blessed him tremendously in the ministry
[6:08] and he's here with his family. Amen.
[6:10] Sister I'm going to try and say it. I
[6:12] can't make the the [laughter]
[6:15] sister Seo. Brother Shamba. Amen.
[6:18] Brother Monash and Sister Shante. Let's
[6:20] give them a hand and welcome the family.
[6:22] [applause]
[6:25] It's amazing what four years can do. I
[6:27] know these kids being like very young
[6:30] four years ago, but uh food can really
[6:33] change you, right? Can make you grow.
[6:36] Amen. But we are to grow in the Lord as
[6:38] well. So, welcome family. And we glad
[6:40] that you can pass by our way to share
[6:41] the word of the Lord. Amen. And the Lord
[6:43] I know I've seen the brother you know
[6:45] going around and ministering and the
[6:47] Lord is really blessing his ministry. So
[6:49] he was passing by this way and we are
[6:51] glad that he contacted us to tell us
[6:53] he'll be coming through. How many of you
[6:54] under expectation this morning?
[6:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're under expectation the
[6:59] Lord will meet that expectation.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; How many of you know if you leave the
[7:02] service here and you say I receive
[7:04] nothing your expectation was zero.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So right now while we sing the
[7:10] song I want you to increase your
[7:11] expectation.
[7:13] increase what you are coming here for,
[7:14] what you're believing the Lord for, and
[7:16] the Holy Spirit will begin to minister
[7:17] to your need.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to just come out of
[7:20] church tradition. We have come here to
[7:22] draw closer to the Lord. We have come
[7:23] here now to connect in a deeper
[7:25] relationship with the Lord.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; And how is he whispering love secrets to
[7:29] his bride? Through the five-fold
[7:30] ministry.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; So, we want to recognize the God behind
[7:33] our dear brother
[7:34] &gt;&gt; veiled in human flesh.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; And when we can approach it like that,
[7:38] you'll watch the service will take a
[7:40] different turn.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together even as we
[7:42] receive our dear brother. Amen. Be at
[7:44] liberty to share the word of the Lord.
[7:46] Amen. [music] And you just pull on the
[7:48] word of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[7:52] You just be hungry and thirsting after
[7:54] him. Amen. Let's sing. As as the deer
[7:56] panteth after the waters, my soul path
[7:59] after thee.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon
[8:02] preaches a message called thirst.
[8:04] [music]
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. What thirst is in your soul this
[8:07] morning? Amen. [music]
[8:09] has the [singing] deer
[8:11] planted for
[8:14] the [singing] waters. So [music] my soul
[8:20] you see you alone. [music and singing]

[10:19] Amen.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. [singing]
[10:20] Praise the Lord.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Greetings this morning in the precious
[10:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; A special special privilege to be
[10:28] together this morning.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Really appreciate the Lord who has kept
[10:33] us. The Lord has been good to us.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; And we really just are grateful for the
[10:39] opportunity to be together with saints
[10:41] of like precious [music] faith.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Indeed. It was some four years ago
[10:47] [singing] out in Mang and and now has
[10:49] kept us. Last year we did come visiting
[10:51] the pastor was preaching somewhere. Yes.
[10:53] And [music] and I I got wrapped in the
[10:56] knuckles for sneaking in. And so I
[11:00] thought, okay, I'll repent this time and
[11:02] and let the pastor know that we we are
[11:04] around and so so glad to be together.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; And we just um bring greetings and
[11:12] blessings. We ask that the Lord will
[11:14] just continue to bless you, bless you,
[11:16] man of God, and your family and the
[11:18] ministry down this way and holding on to
[11:21] this great revelation that we have
[11:24] received.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing greater than it,
[11:28] &gt;&gt; this closing minutes and seconds.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Of all of human history.
[11:35] So so glad to be partakers
[11:38] of of that great happening that's
[11:40] happening in the day and age that we're
[11:42] living in.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Let's open our Bibles. We'll read a few
[11:45] scriptures, but let's just start in the
[11:47] book of Genesis 5 verse 22 to 24. I was
[11:52] quite blessed when I had the pastor just
[11:56] touching on
[11:58] something that we want to speak about
[12:00] this morning.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[12:02] And and it really is that time.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; And and our thought this morning is
[12:10] preparing the bride for the rapture.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; We are in that time.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely that. That's all that
[12:16] God is interested in.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else that he's
[12:19] interested in but to prepare us
[12:21] &gt;&gt; for the changing of amen.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; And that's why we just want to read
[12:24] about Enoch a little bit and then we
[12:27] will read other scriptures. But let's
[12:29] just read a familiar scripture. Genesis
[12:32] 5 22- 24. And Enoch walked with God.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; After he begat Methuselah 300 years
[12:41] [clears throat] and begat sons and
[12:43] daughters. And all the days of Enoch
[12:45] were 300 605 years. And Enoch walked
[12:49] with God and he was snot.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; For God took care.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[12:57] [clears throat]
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Most gracious and dear loving heavenly
[13:00] father. Thank you.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; We are so grateful blessed Lord this
[13:04] morning that we can be called your
[13:06] children.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; We can be identified with you father.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; And that's because we were in you before
[13:14] the foundation of the heavens.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Because we are a manifestation of those
[13:20] attributes that
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; And we are so thankful that that it's
[13:24] only those that were in you that can
[13:27] recognize this.
[13:29] And that's why, Father, it's not what we
[13:32] can do and count it such a blessing to
[13:35] recognize who we are.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; By the revelation of the word of the
[13:39] hour.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, you've opened the scripture and
[13:42] we'll be reading the word and reading
[13:45] quotations and just sharing thoughts
[13:48] from this message of Malachi 4. We pray,
[13:51] Father, that the same anointing by which
[13:54] you wrote this Bible and anointed your
[13:57] prophet to reveal this Bible May it be
[14:00] the same anointing this morning.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Speak to us, blessed father, for you
[14:04] alone are worthy to address.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; May you set aside this vessel, Lord, and
[14:09] just use it for your honor and glory.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; We pray, Father, for the local pastor,
[14:14] Lord, with great responsibility over the
[14:16] souls, Lord, [crying]
[14:18] &gt;&gt; blessing, blessed father.
[14:21] Bless his ministry, blessed father,
[14:23] bless his families. I pray as well.
[14:25] Commit his family also to you, oh God.
[14:28] Amen.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; Every brother, sister here, you know the
[14:31] needs of your children and you alone can
[14:34] minister to the most needless man.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Is our prayer father that we do that oh
[14:38] God as we ask father and commit the
[14:40] service commit ourselves to you in that
[14:43] precious blessed name of the Lord Jesus
[14:45] Christ the king. Amen.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. You may be dead.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:52] Before
[14:55] we get into our thought this morning, we
[14:58] just want to read a little quotation and
[15:00] I was just glad again when you know the
[15:03] pastor
[15:05] reminded us and emphasized again that we
[15:08] are under the ministry
[15:10] &gt;&gt; of the seventh angel messenger.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; That's who we are under this morning and
[15:15] that's that's what we believe. Yes.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; And nothing else, nothing new.
[15:20] Not some fantastic new revelation.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; It's the message that God sent us
[15:27] packaged in with a prophet called
[15:29] Millham. Yes.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; But it was God speaking.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what we believe and that's
[15:34] what we have received.
[15:36] and and in in question and answers on
[15:38] Hebrews number 3 paragraph 6:33 the
[15:42] prophet of God says all powers in heaven
[15:44] and earth is given unto my hand and I'll
[15:47] go with you whatever you bind on earth
[15:50] I'll bind in heaven what you lose on
[15:53] earth I'll you lose in heaven
[15:56] &gt;&gt; oh if the great holy church only
[15:59] realized its power
[16:01] &gt;&gt; to do these things
[16:03] &gt;&gt; but there's so much doubt and fear and
[16:04] trembling wondering If it will,
[16:06] &gt;&gt; could it happen? As long as that exists,
[16:09] the church can never stand upright.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; And when every stock of fear is vanished
[16:15] and the Holy Spirit is completely in
[16:18] control of the church, then all fears
[16:20] are gone and that church has the power.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; You see, and when they have everything
[16:26] that heaven owns behind them, what a
[16:29] what a comfort this morning.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. that we have everything that
[16:33] heaven owns behind us.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; And it says there are ambassadors
[16:38] of the throne. And and I just love this
[16:42] concept of ambassador.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; I just love it so much because you know
[16:46] an ambassador of a country represents
[16:49] that country in that foreign land.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; So as ambassadors of heaven, as
[16:53] ambassadors of the throne, we represent
[16:55] all that heaven is.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he says an ambassador of
[17:00] Christ has the authority
[17:03] &gt;&gt; and everything that Christ owns belongs
[17:07] to that ambassador.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; That is the church of Jesus.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; That everything that Christ owns
[17:16] &gt;&gt; belongs to us.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; As representatives, as ambassadors,
[17:21] that's why when he says all power is
[17:24] given unto me,
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know that that means all power
[17:27] is given unto you
[17:29] &gt;&gt; because you are his representative. You
[17:32] are his ambassador. And may may the Lord
[17:35] help us to recognize that position.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; As ambassadors of heaven as ambassador
[17:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ. And that all
[17:43] fear and trembling is removed. All doubt
[17:46] is removed.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; That we can receive this word and that
[17:50] it may anchor in our souls and reveal to
[17:53] us who we are.
[17:55] Because that's really what the message
[17:57] of the hour has come to do. It's come to
[17:58] reveal Christ. And by revealing Christ
[18:01] as we know that he was the mystery of
[18:03] God revealed, we are the mystery of
[18:06] Christ. [applause]
[18:07] &gt;&gt; He has come to reveal himself through
[18:09] the bride.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; And and that's why that you know we are
[18:13] him in blind form.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and that's that's what and
[18:18] it is that revelation that that anchors
[18:22] in your soul and that is it's the power
[18:25] of that revelation that will change your
[18:27] body one
[18:29] and that's that's really what God is
[18:31] concentrating on that's what God is
[18:33] focused on to make us see who we are
[18:36] &gt;&gt; because when that revelation drops this
[18:39] body will just not take it anymore so
[18:42] much of power of this revelation that
[18:45] this body will just not take him. Amen.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; And and we are taught by the prophet
[18:50] that there were three raptures in the
[18:52] Old Testament
[18:53] &gt;&gt; and and and three raptures in the New
[18:55] Testament.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; And and we are taught that in the Old
[18:58] Testament, the three raptures, Enoch,
[19:00] Elijah, and the Lord Jesus Christ and
[19:02] the Lord Jesus Christ as the prophet
[19:04] calls him as the keystone.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Keystone
[19:07] &gt;&gt; linking the Old Testament and the New
[19:09] Testament. and uh and and what we just
[19:12] want to look at this morning, the Lord
[19:13] being gracious to us, is is just to look
[19:16] at what was happening in in in those
[19:19] other raptures
[19:20] &gt;&gt; that are help because we are focused on
[19:22] making sure that we're ready for
[19:24] &gt;&gt; there's nothing else that should we
[19:27] should worry about that we should care
[19:28] about but to make sure that we have
[19:30] everything in us that will change these
[19:32] bodies.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's why, you know, the
[19:35] prophet of God tells us, you know, it
[19:37] doesn't matter how good of a person you
[19:38] are, how how much you come to church and
[19:41] do all of those things. It's not that.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; It must be something on the inside
[19:46] &gt;&gt; and it must be him on the inside.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Much as it was him in the inside
[19:52] of the prophet bringing this message, it
[19:55] must be him in you receiving this
[19:57] message.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Because the true revelation of the word
[20:00] of God is God himself in you receiving
[20:03] his own way.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Because you you and I as in our own
[20:08] human ways and forms, we have no
[20:10] capacity to receive the way.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; We have no capacity to to even receive
[20:16] revelation. That's why the Lord Jesus
[20:18] Christ said, "Flesh and blood never
[20:20] reveal to you, but my father."
[20:23] &gt;&gt; So it has to be the father in you,
[20:26] &gt;&gt; the one revealing the word to himself,
[20:29] &gt;&gt; the one receiving the word in you. And
[20:32] that's what we have come to in the hour
[20:34] that we're living in. So we we see that
[20:37] Enoch, the Bible teaches us that he
[20:39] walked with God.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; He walked pleasingly before
[20:43] [clears throat] God. He he anchored the
[20:45] word in his heart and he was normal. And
[20:49] we know that he was the seventh from
[20:52] Adam.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; And being the seventh, we are taught by
[20:54] the prophet that it's a type of us.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; He's a type of the seventh church age.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Showing that the seventh church age
[21:02] represents people who will not die.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Because there will be no other age
[21:07] hereafter. Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; And we know that afterwards was the
[21:10] destruction by by Noah's message. And
[21:13] and we you know the Bible
[21:16] shows us and and and we are we read it
[21:19] in Jude that he was the seventh from
[21:21] Adam and you can count it you know Adam
[21:24] and Seth and Enoch.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ken and all of those all the
[21:28] way down to to to Enoch and Enoch
[21:31] becomes the seventh one. And the Bible
[21:33] says when you read in in verse 5 of
[21:36] Genesis chapter 5 we've read that even
[21:38] Adam
[21:40] &gt;&gt; died.
[21:42] He he and we all know, you know, he came
[21:43] straight from the hand of God.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; But he died.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; He died.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; And Seth died. All of the other six
[21:51] died.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; And when he gets to the seventh, it just
[21:54] says he was no more
[21:56] &gt;&gt; because what? God took him.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; He was raptured. And Hebrews tells us
[22:01] that he was translated.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; He was raptured. And you know, the
[22:05] prophet tells us that the word rapture
[22:07] is not even in the Bible. It's a
[22:09] translation. Is a change. is a catching
[22:12] away. That's what that's what that word
[22:14] means and that's what
[22:17] Enoch that's what happened to Enoch and
[22:19] him representing us
[22:22] &gt;&gt; and you know so all of those other six
[22:26] who died was a representation of the six
[22:30] church ages
[22:31] &gt;&gt; but then when it comes to the seventh
[22:33] it's a translation is a change but it's
[22:35] of a people who walk with God
[22:40] &gt;&gt; and and and [laughter] and the Bible
[22:41] says here
[22:42] testimony that he pleased God.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; And we know that without faith it's
[22:48] impossible to
[22:50] &gt;&gt; and we know that faith is a revelation.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what God has come to do today
[22:55] is to reveal himself.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Because the the opening of the seals is
[23:01] to reveal Christ.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; That's what because he is the seals that
[23:06] were revealed.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the revelation of the se is
[23:10] none but Christ himself.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; That's why you know the prophet of God
[23:14] tells us that it cannot bring something
[23:16] else.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; It can be some other thing that is
[23:19] outside of the word.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; And I love how you know and I I believe
[23:24] person that the the brother who was
[23:27] telling the prophet you know you know
[23:28] but what about the the seven thunders?
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Wouldn't that be some something
[23:32] that you know God gives you? And the
[23:34] prophet of God says, "No, no, no. It
[23:36] can't be."
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; And he says it was all revealed in the
[23:41] seven seals.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; It has to line up with the word
[23:45] &gt;&gt; because you can't add to the word. You
[23:48] can't take away from the word.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; So the message that we have received is
[23:53] the opening of the word.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why you know when you
[23:56] when you read any part of the spoken
[24:00] word
[24:01] &gt;&gt; you know you can't read a paragraph
[24:03] &gt;&gt; that is not a reference to the
[24:05] scripture.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Every part of what the prophet was
[24:09] bringing is reference to the scripture.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; It's all the unfolding of the Bible.
[24:16] Something new that the prophet came to
[24:18] tell us.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; It's just Bible.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he it was the restoration
[24:24] &gt;&gt; of what had through the dark ages the
[24:28] seed had to fall into the ground.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; But through the re reformers was just
[24:33] the sprouting of that seed and and and
[24:36] and as it was coming up but in this age
[24:39] it's the seed that went into the ground.
[24:41] Amen. That's what we see today. So it
[24:43] must be the word again. And that's why
[24:46] the prophet says in in in in the spoken
[24:49] of the reference says now we find here
[24:51] that Enoch was a seventh from Noah and
[24:52] you know the people that the pastor was
[24:54] talking about will take this one and say
[24:55] ah the prophet made a mistake there. You
[24:58] &gt;&gt; see that's right
[24:58] &gt;&gt; we know he's a seventh from Adam. We
[25:00] know that's we know it is. So it's not
[25:04] some new thing that you think you found.
[25:06] No. Which was a type of the church ages.
[25:10] Now all the rest of the six men before
[25:12] him died. But Enoch was translated.
[25:15] Inoqua's rapture, the seven showing that
[25:18] it's the seventh church age that takes
[25:20] the rapture. Now, there's no doubt we're
[25:23] in the seventh church age. We all know
[25:25] it. Now, it's the seventh church age
[25:27] that takes the rapture. All of the other
[25:31] six died, but Enoch was translated
[25:34] because he was not found. God took him,
[25:38] &gt;&gt; but Enoch raptured was a type of all of
[25:40] the rest of them dying. But the end time
[25:43] bride will be called out
[25:45] &gt;&gt; the rapturing without death will be
[25:48] called out of the seven which are now
[25:51] bearing record of that age.
[25:54] [clears throat]
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; And and you know how allow how the
[25:57] prophets oh my let's dig in now real
[26:00] deep.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; And that's what you know the the
[26:03] wonderful thing about the message is
[26:05] exactly that there's no part of the
[26:07] message that is hidden from us. Yes,
[26:10] &gt;&gt; there's nothing that is maybe too deep
[26:12] that's still not revealed. Everything
[26:14] has been revealed.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; There is no part that remains hidden to
[26:17] the body of Christ.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; And that's why we can go real deep.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; To any part of the message and go and
[26:24] take those nuggets that will build the
[26:27] rapturing faith on the inside.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; And and in God's power to transform, it
[26:32] says Enoch was translated from death by
[26:35] God's transforming power. Paragraph 252.
[26:38] What did God do that for? For a type of
[26:42] the rapturing church that is coming,
[26:44] which is us.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; And he says, yeah, Elijah was the same
[26:48] because he was now that second type of
[26:51] the rapture in the Old Testament.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; And and and that's why we said, you
[26:56] know, the Bible tells us that, you know,
[26:59] pleased God.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; And for us to please God is to walk by
[27:03] faith, to keep the word in our hearts.
[27:06] And and he says the same in in paragraph
[27:09] 252 of the same spoken word, God's power
[27:11] to transform. He says that word has to
[27:14] come to pass. It's God's word planted in
[27:19] your heart if you want to go in a
[27:21] rapture.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; For you to go in the rapture, what you
[27:24] need to plant in your heart is
[27:26] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Nothing else but the word.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; The word is the pill. [clears throat]
[27:33] &gt;&gt; The word is the medicine. Yes,
[27:35] &gt;&gt; that knows how to change this body.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; No other medicine can you take to change
[27:40] the body. But the word has got the power
[27:43] to change the body to translate. Amen.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; And and we see that you know and we see
[27:49] it right throughout the scripture. When
[27:52] those who receive the word, something
[27:55] happens on the inside because the power
[27:58] of transformation is in the way. If you
[28:02] want to be Christians genuine, plays
[28:05] this way. Yes.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Because Ezekiel said in Ezekiel 2, take
[28:09] that scroll and eat it up.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; And the prophet and the word will be the
[28:15] same.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; And and that's why that's why Revelation
[28:18] 10:8 now referencing us that we must eat
[28:22] the book also and so that we and the
[28:26] book can become the same.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; We and the word can become the same.
[28:30] Amen.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Now watch the word in the bride.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; And and and that's why the Bible say the
[28:36] prophet of God says for the bride who
[28:39] has become the word
[28:40] &gt;&gt; there's been a complete atonement
[28:43] &gt;&gt; because she has become the word
[28:46] &gt;&gt; and the word is God.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; And the word became flesh
[28:50] &gt;&gt; and and and dwelt among us. And and
[28:53] that's why you know I always say that
[28:54] you know I've been to to to Israel. I've
[28:57] been to to the streets of Nazareth. Why?
[29:00] Because I was in him when he was walking
[29:02] those streets
[29:03] &gt;&gt; because he hadn't the bride hadn't been
[29:04] taken out of him yet.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; And when he was walking the streets, I
[29:08] was in him because I am a part of it.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; I am that way.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; In him was the fullness of the way.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; And that's why, you know, the prophet of
[29:18] God, you know, some of these things I I
[29:21] say that's why the prophet takes it an
[29:23] octave higher because he says you died
[29:25] for your own sins.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; How so? because you were in him when he
[29:31] died. So because you were in him, you
[29:33] died for your own sins. You paid for
[29:35] your own atonement and therefore there's
[29:37] no more tribulation for you because you
[29:39] are the bride of Christ.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; And and the bride of Christ, as the
[29:44] prophet of God says, the church of the
[29:46] word in the church making it the bride.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; So it's when the word comes in and
[29:52] becomes flesh in you that makes you the
[29:55] bride. Amen.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Without the word, you are just a church,
[29:59] just a called out. But when the word
[30:01] comes in and becomes flesh in you, you
[30:03] [applause] become the bride.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Because he is the he the way. So being
[30:08] the bridegroom being the word for you to
[30:11] be his bride, you must be the word also.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; If if the the groom was the word made
[30:16] flesh, what must the bride be?
[30:19] &gt;&gt; She must be the word made flesh also.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; He can't be married to something that is
[30:24] not himself. Amen.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; He can only unite with a part that
[30:29] it says the striking of Adam was for a
[30:32] purpose
[30:33] &gt;&gt; to take out of him a a a bride. And it
[30:37] was the same with the striking of the
[30:39] second egg was to take out of him the
[30:42] the bride. Right.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; And he says
[30:45] in in in I love it here in God's
[30:48] provided place of worship paragraph 40
[30:52] 650425
[30:54] he says let's take a man here that kept
[30:56] all of the word of God back in the Old
[30:59] Testament by the name of Enoch.
[31:00] [clears throat]
[31:02] He was quickened by the word of God.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; What quickened him?
[31:07] &gt;&gt; What translated him? What raptured him
[31:11] was the word of God.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; That's what that was his transport.
[31:16] That's what that's what he stepped on as
[31:19] he was walking on up was the way.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Because he had kept that word.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says that
[31:28] [clears throat] he the testimony that he
[31:30] pleased God. There wasn't one thing that
[31:33] God commanded Enoch to do, but what he
[31:36] did. Yes.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what must be the same with
[31:39] you and I.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Whatever God commands us to do, we do.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; And and and whatever the word says you
[31:46] must do, we do.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; And and we can only do so when it's the
[31:50] word itself in you living itself.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Because on our own we the sticky nature
[31:56] is always there.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; But it must be the word on the inside
[32:00] and that word can live itself out.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it becomes it's you know
[32:05] the supernatural becomes natural to
[32:07] &gt;&gt; because you you are a supernatural being
[32:11] God in you
[32:13] &gt;&gt; and that becomes normal and ordinary to
[32:15] you to live for God.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Everything else is what actually is
[32:19] foreign to you.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; And and he says in paragraph 141 he says
[32:22] I wonder how many Enochs will be here
[32:24] this morning. He says this afternoon but
[32:26] I wonder how many Enochs are here this
[32:29] morning.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you know it's in the word of
[32:33] God,
[32:34] how many of you bothered women could
[32:37] call yourself an inoist? I love that
[32:39] word. An
[32:40] &gt;&gt; inoist.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; We must be inocists this morning.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; People who are just like Enoch.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; See, and know that God condemns that.
[32:49] You know, we as an enoist, you can do
[32:52] something that that God condemns.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; How many of you men let them women do
[32:57] that could call yourself an Enoch? M
[32:59] &gt;&gt; that's what that that's you know I
[33:01] always say that you know sometimes
[33:04] we we we label ourselves incorrectly if
[33:06] I can call it that what God has called
[33:09] us to be is to be Christians
[33:11] &gt;&gt; and Christian is to be Christlike
[33:13] &gt;&gt; and it's not some label called the
[33:16] message the message is what we have
[33:18] believed but what the message makes you
[33:20] is to be a Christian
[33:22] &gt;&gt; because that's what God has called you
[33:24] to be to be Christlike here on the face
[33:28] of the
[33:29] And so that's what we see that the man
[33:33] who got raptured first right in the book
[33:36] of Genesis is one who walked with God.
[33:40] Is one who kept the word of God. Is the
[33:43] one who absolutely revered the word of
[33:45] God and walked pleasingly before God.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; And that word is what changed him. Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; And it must be therefore the same with
[33:53] us that the key to rapture is for us to
[33:56] keep the word in the heart.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing else but that word.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; The word.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; And that's what God has come to do with
[34:03] this message was to restore the word
[34:06] &gt;&gt; because a lot had been called the word.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Many things had been called the word.
[34:11] But God had to send a prophet because
[34:14] the word of the Lord only comes to a
[34:16] prophet. Not a reformer but a prophet.
[34:19] Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; And a prophet, a prophet is a revealer
[34:22] of the divine word of God. That's what a
[34:24] prophet is. A prophet, that's why the
[34:26] prophet says, you know, when a prophet
[34:27] stands and says, "Thus sayeth the Lord,"
[34:29] he takes the place of God.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; It's God speaking through a man.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; And and that's why he doesn't say, "Thus
[34:36] sayaith Elijah," he says, "Thus sayaith
[34:38] the Lord."
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Meaning what I'm about to say is God
[34:41] speaking to me. It's not me. It's God
[34:43] speaking. And so if we go to to to to
[34:47] the book of first kings and if we just
[34:49] want to go to the second one second one
[34:51] who was raptured Elijah and and we will
[34:54] just maybe start in verse 13 of first
[34:58] Kings chapter 17 and we know the story
[35:01] of of of Elijah very well but there just
[35:05] a few things that I I just want us to
[35:07] look at
[35:10] verse 13 of first kings chapter 17
[35:14] Well, well familiar scripture, you
[35:16] always say that if a minister comes with
[35:19] some other things that your pastor is
[35:21] not teaching, that's the one you must be
[35:23] suspicious of, not get too excited. Ah,
[35:26] this brother has some. No, no, no. It's
[35:29] exactly what your your pastor God has
[35:31] placed him here to teach you the word of
[35:33] God. It mustn't be some other person who
[35:35] brings some foreign thing to you. And
[35:38] Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go and
[35:41] do as thou has said, but make me thereof
[35:45] a little cake first, and bring it unto
[35:47] me. For thus say the Lord of Israel, the
[35:50] barrel of meal shall not waste, neither
[35:53] shall the cru of oil fail until the day
[35:56] that the Lord sendeth rain upon the
[35:58] earth.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; She went and did according to the saying
[36:02] of Elijah.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; And she and and he and her house did it
[36:09] many days. And the barrel of meal wasted
[36:12] not, neither did the cruise of oil fail
[36:14] according to the word of the Lord which
[36:18] he spake by Elijah.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; In verse 24, it says, "And the woman
[36:24] said unto Elijah, now by this I know
[36:29] that thou art a man of God, and that the
[36:32] word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth."
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I I love I love just
[36:40] references to the scripture that we've
[36:42] just read of how you know God's word was
[36:47] coming through his prophet.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; It was the word of God being spoken by
[36:53] Elijah. And that's why you know it says
[36:56] she went and did according to what
[36:58] Elijah said. Yes,
[36:59] &gt;&gt; she went and did and and and the barrel
[37:02] and the cruise of oil, all of those
[37:04] nothing wasted because of the word of
[37:07] the Lord that he spake through Elijah.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; And the and the woman says, "No, I know
[37:12] that the word of God is in your mouth."
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; If that is not the third pool, then what
[37:17] is?
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; What what what Elijah was doing here
[37:21] again is an example of one who got
[37:24] raptured. The second example of one who
[37:26] got raptured in the Old Testament, he
[37:29] manifested the third book.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; And what was that? God speaking through
[37:34] a man again and bringing things to pass.
[37:38] And as as we were saying, it's the same
[37:41] with the bride today. Because it's the
[37:43] bride who has become the word.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; It must be the bride who becomes the
[37:48] word. Now it's the word of God being
[37:51] spoken through the bride. Amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; And that's why our pastor quoted it that
[37:56] we under our messenger have become the
[38:00] final voice.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; So the final voice of God is who? It's
[38:05] us in this age under our messenger. And
[38:09] that's why Revelation 21:17 the prophet
[38:11] calls it that the spirit and the bride
[38:14] say come.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; So it's the bride speaking in this age
[38:19] &gt;&gt; as that final voice. You know the
[38:21] prophet of God says we are predestinated
[38:25] with our messenger.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; We come as a package. I love that so
[38:29] much.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; We we are predestinated with our
[38:32] prophet.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; We come with him. WE ARE REPRESENT.
[38:35] THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW WHEN HE WENT TO THE
[38:37] sixth dimension he said are all these
[38:39] breads where they sure are.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; They all come represented under his
[38:44] ministry
[38:45] &gt;&gt; because we are predestinated as a
[38:48] package under him.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; And and and the prophet of God says, you
[38:52] know, it's the voice of God in her.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; So in the bride, it's not her speaking,
[39:00] it's the voice of God speaking through
[39:03] her and she has become that final voice
[39:07] because why? She has the word because
[39:10] the prophet again says the word is in
[39:14] the bride.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; That's what where the word is today is
[39:17] in the bride. And we know that God is a
[39:20] dispensational God. You know, for you to
[39:23] to to know where he is, you must receive
[39:27] him by revelation.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; You know, therefore, the prophet of God
[39:29] says, you know, if if he was here this
[39:33] morning wearing this suit that he gave
[39:35] me, I love how he says it. He says, "If
[39:36] he was here this morning wearing this
[39:38] suit that he gave me and you came to him
[39:41] and said, "Oh Lord Jesus, please heal
[39:43] me." He'll say, "No, no, no, no, son.
[39:45] No, daughter. I've already done it.
[39:48] He
[39:49] &gt;&gt; He can't do any more than he's already
[39:51] done.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; It's already paid for. It's done. It's
[39:54] for you and I to receive it.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; And that's why, you know, he says if he
[39:58] came here with a long robe and a long
[40:01] beard, he says I wouldn't receive him.
[40:03] No, no, no, no. That's what the prophet
[40:06] of God says. Because that's not what the
[40:08] promise of this age is.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; That he'll come here like that man from
[40:13] Galilee. the man of Galilee. He has
[40:15] become the men and women of Phoenix in
[40:18] the age that we are living in. That's
[40:20] where he has come to represent himself.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; That's where he is walking today.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; He's walking the streets of Phoenix and
[40:27] it's him in you and I.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; He's not going to come as anything else
[40:33] today.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; And and that's why, you know, he always
[40:36] says that if he was to come today, he
[40:38] would look just like you. And that's how
[40:40] he came to the house of Abraham. When he
[40:43] went to the house of Abraham, the
[40:44] prophet teaches us that he had dust on
[40:47] his feet. He [laughter] blended in. He
[40:50] looked exactly like the people of the
[40:52] field of Abraham.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; So when THE PEOPLE PASSED BY WITH NO
[40:57] REVELATION, they just saw a visitor in
[40:59] the house of Abraham. They did not know
[41:01] that Elohim himself had come to the
[41:05] house of Abraham.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; And what had he come to do? He had come
[41:09] with a message for a body chain.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THAT MESSAGE WAS THAT HE he
[41:16] went to bring to Abraham.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; It was him again
[41:22] &gt;&gt; that Elohim.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; IN FLESH
[41:25] &gt;&gt; WITH ONE message to for a message THAT
[41:29] THEY MUST RECEIVE FOR A BODY CHANGE.
[41:31] [laughter]
[41:31] &gt;&gt; AND AS IT WAS, SO IT IS TODAY. He has to
[41:35] MANIFEST HIMSELF AS THAT ONE WHO TURNS
[41:38] THE same one manifesting the same gift
[41:42] to show that he is the son of man again
[41:44] today.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And through that ministry of the son of
[41:49] man through that ministry of the opening
[41:52] of the seventh seal he's ministering the
[41:55] same thing to you and I today
[41:57] &gt;&gt; a message [clears throat] for a body
[41:59] change.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Preparing us for that rapture for that
[42:02] body change. That's what he's focused
[42:04] on. He's that's why you know the prophet
[42:06] of God says you know the first pool
[42:09] second pool those that's just to draw
[42:11] the attention of the people but the
[42:13] third pool is the opening of the way.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; That's what the first two are forerunner
[42:18] of the third
[42:19] &gt;&gt; for you to see exactly what he wants you
[42:23] to see
[42:24] &gt;&gt; in the age that we are living in. And h
[42:26] and and we know that Elijah also came in
[42:29] the time of Jezebel. The same spirit
[42:32] that we seeing in the age that we are
[42:33] living in Elijah comes in in that
[42:36] circumstance when that is the the the
[42:40] the spirit prevailing at a time of
[42:42] Jezebel. Elijah comes and what does he
[42:45] come to do? He comes to return their
[42:47] hearts back to God. Let's read in
[42:48] revelation in in in in first Kings
[42:51] chapter 18 and maybe let's just read
[42:54] from verse 19 to 22 and then we'll go
[42:56] down to verse 29 and just to see again h
[43:00] you know how God is giving these things
[43:03] as an example to us to see what he was
[43:07] doing then is what he's doing to us here
[43:09] and and I I believe that's why the Bible
[43:11] says WE HAVE A CLOUD OF witnesses
[43:14] &gt;&gt; glory
[43:14] &gt;&gt; you know and the prophet of what I love
[43:16] how he says you know that woman with a
[43:18] blood issue. She had no reference point.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; She she had did not read anywhere that I
[43:24] can touch the hem of his garment and
[43:27] then my my healing will come through.
[43:28] No, there's no scripture that said that
[43:30] to her. BUT BY FAITH,
[43:32] &gt;&gt; SHE REACHED OUT AND TOUCHED THE HEM OF
[43:34] HIS GARMENT.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; BUT OUR BROTHER, SISTER, YOU AND I, WE
[43:37] HAVE A CLOUD OF GOODNESS.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; WE have a a REFERENCE POINT. WE HAVE
[43:42] SOMETHING TO ANCHOR OUR FAITH ON. THE
[43:44] word of God
[43:45] &gt;&gt; is all here given to us so that we can
[43:48] position ourselves. WE CAN KNOW WHO WE
[43:51] ARE. WE CAN KNOW WHERE WE ARE. WE CAN
[43:52] KNOW WHERE WE COME FROM, WHERE WE GOING.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO BE
[43:56] CONFUSED.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO US. HE HAS GIVEN
[44:00] IT ALL to us in the age that we are
[44:02] living in.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; So, and there are so many things we can
[44:06] can pick up any scripture and you see
[44:09] yourself in that scripture. And that's
[44:10] why the prophet says if you open a new
[44:12] part of the Bible and you don't see
[44:13] Christ read it again
[44:15] &gt;&gt; because it's the revelation of Jesus
[44:17] Christ if it's revealing Christ is
[44:18] revealing you.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; You must see yourself
[44:22] &gt;&gt; because he's a central theme of the
[44:24] entire Bible.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; You are the central theme of the entire
[44:27] Bible. THAT'S WHAT GOD has come to do in
[44:30] the whole thing was to come and reveal a
[44:32] bride.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; The bride who will not fail,
[44:36] &gt;&gt; who will manifest the final victory.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. First Kings 18:1 19 the Bible says
[44:42] now therefore send and gather to me all
[44:45] Israel unto Mount K and the prophets of
[44:48] Bal 450
[44:50] and the prophets of the groves 400 total
[44:53] of 850 prophets
[44:55] &gt;&gt; all gathered there against one
[44:57] vindicated prophet of God
[45:00] &gt;&gt; which is a Jezebel house all of these
[45:02] were under a Jezebel spell
[45:04] &gt;&gt; like all these so-called prophets that
[45:07] we see in the age that we living being
[45:09] &gt;&gt; influenced by absolute wrong spirit.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; And and as the Bible says to us, it's
[45:15] Matthew 24:24.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; If it were possible, they will deceive
[45:20] the very elect. But we, YOU AND I ARE
[45:23] THE VERY ELECT. WE'RE NOT JUST THE
[45:25] ELECT. WE ARE THE VERY ELECT.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; As the very elect, we can't be deceived.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; We can differentiate the two spirits.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MANY PROPHETS THERE MAY
[45:35] BE, WE CAN KNOW THE ONE TRUE PROPHET.
[45:38] AMEN.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; VINDICATED. WHY? Because the Bible tells
[45:41] us that it must be the word test.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; That's what God CARES ABOUT IS HIS WORD.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; That's the only test you and I give any
[45:49] of his is the word test. Everything must
[45:52] line up with the word of God. Amen.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Or we leave it alone.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; So Ahab sent unto all the children of
[45:59] Israel and gathered the prophets
[46:01] together unto Mount Carmel. And Elijah
[46:04] came unto all the people and said, "HOW
[46:06] LONG SHALL he
[46:09] &gt;&gt; between [clears throat]
[46:10] sh how long halt ye between two
[46:13] opinions?
[46:14] &gt;&gt; If the LORD BE GOD, FOLLOW HIM."
[46:17] &gt;&gt; But if Bal then follow him, and the
[46:20] people answered him, not a word.
[46:24] And then Elijah said unto the people, I
[46:26] even I only remain a prophet unto the
[46:29] Lord, but B's prophets are 450
[46:33] men.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; And and and then we know, let's go to
[46:37] verse 29, we know what then happens
[46:39] there with the bullocks and and and the
[46:42] great Mount Carmel showed up. But uh
[46:45] from verse 29 the Bible says and and it
[46:48] came to pass when midday was passed and
[46:50] they and they prophesied until the time
[46:52] of the offering of the evening
[46:55] sacrifice. So Elijah had to wait for a
[46:58] particular time which was an evening
[47:00] time.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; And here we are sitting in the evening
[47:04] time. We are evening time people in in
[47:07] this hour.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; And he say there was neither voice nor
[47:10] any to answer nor any that regarded. And
[47:13] Elijah said unto all the people, "Come
[47:15] near unto me." And all the people came
[47:17] near unto him, and he repaired the altar
[47:21] of the Lord that was broken down. That's
[47:23] exactly what the prophet had come to do.
[47:25] Yes. Worship had been broken.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; He had come to restore worship.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; But more importantly, come to restore
[47:32] the way.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; That's what the message is, is to back
[47:35] to THE WAY.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; MALACHIAH 4 IS BACK TO THE WAY.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; That's what he had come to do in this
[47:41] age. And Elijah took 12 stones
[47:44] representing the 12 tribes of Israel,
[47:47] &gt;&gt; unto whom the word of the Lord came,
[47:49] saying, Israel shall be thy name.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; And with the stones he built an altar in
[47:54] the name of the Lord, and he and he made
[47:56] a trench about the altar as great as
[47:59] would contain two measures of seed. And
[48:02] he put the wood in order and cut the
[48:04] bulocks in pieces and laid him. And we
[48:06] won't go into all of those things
[48:07] because that's not really what we we are
[48:09] speaking on this morning. And he said,
[48:11] "Do it the second time." And they did it
[48:13] the third time. And all of these things,
[48:14] he said, verse 36, "And it came to pass
[48:17] at the time of the offering of the
[48:20] evening sacrifice." Yes.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Then Elijah the prophet came near and
[48:24] said unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac
[48:28] and and of Israel, let it be known this
[48:32] day that thou art God in Israel,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; and that I am thy servant,
[48:37] &gt;&gt; and that I have done all these things at
[48:39] thy word.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me that this
[48:44] people may know that thou art the Lord
[48:46] God, and that thou has turned their
[48:49] heart again. Yes,
[48:50] &gt;&gt; we see Malachi fall there again.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; What is Elijah doing? Turning the heart.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the heart, we must be
[48:57] of one heart, of one accord, the same
[48:59] one faith, one Lord, one baptism
[49:02] &gt;&gt; under one messenger. So turning the
[49:04] heart exactly the same as what we have
[49:07] received in this age. Um
[49:10] and and he says, "And then the fire of
[49:14] the Lord fell and consumed the bent
[49:16] sacrifice and the wood and the stones
[49:18] and the dust and licked up the water
[49:20] that was in the trench. And when all the
[49:23] people saw it, they fell on their faces.
[49:25] They said, "The Lord, he is the God. The
[49:29] Lord, he is the God." and and may the
[49:32] Lord help us that you know having seen
[49:35] the full manifestation of the word in
[49:38] the age that we live having seen this
[49:41] Elijah of our day restoring the word
[49:44] restoring worship restoring the altar
[49:46] and turning the heart back to the
[49:49] Pentecostal fathers that we may now
[49:51] worship God truly
[49:54] &gt;&gt; worship God the correct way because
[49:57] worship has been restored and and and we
[50:00] we know that you Now with Elijah came
[50:03] Elisha who was his successor as as as we
[50:07] are taught in in second Kings. And the
[50:10] same ministry that you see in Elijah,
[50:13] you see in Elisha
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Elisha just does exactly as Elijah did.
[50:19] Yes.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God shows us, you
[50:22] know, how and in fact, in fact, let's
[50:24] let's maybe just read a a couple of
[50:27] parts um in in in 2 Kings chapter 2
[50:31] verse 21-22. I I just want to
[50:35] uh catch something here.
[50:42] And it says 21:22, "And he went forth
[50:44] unto the spring of the waters, and cast
[50:46] the salt in there. And he said, "Thus
[50:48] say the Lord, I have healed these
[50:50] waters, and there shall not be from
[50:52] thence anymore death or barren land." So
[50:55] the waters were healed unto this day
[50:57] according to the saying of Elijah which
[51:00] he spake. And and and so what what is it
[51:04] that we seeing again? The same
[51:07] representation of the word of the final
[51:11] voice been through Elisha who is
[51:13] Elijah's successor. We must see in the
[51:15] bride.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; And uh and and and the prophet of God
[51:19] says something here that's really
[51:20] wonderful which I I hope we see sorry
[51:25] the Bible the prophet say God in
[51:27] simplicity
[51:29] he says
[51:31] God taking the humble sinner and
[51:33] cleansing him by his blood and dropping
[51:36] that confessed sin into that chlorox
[51:38] bleach of the blood of son of god bleach
[51:40] of the son of god and putting his own
[51:43] life into that man
[51:45] &gt;&gt; by the baptism of the holy ghost.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Then if we have a genuine baptism of the
[51:49] Holy Ghost, what's wrong with us? When
[51:52] the type when Elijah dropped the rope
[51:56] for Elisha, he got a double portion of
[51:59] it.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The work that I do shall
[52:03] you do also,
[52:04] &gt;&gt; and greater than this shall you do, for
[52:08] I go to my father."
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what the prophet of God as we
[52:12] know many many times when he quotes this
[52:15] scripture he says no there can be no
[52:18] greater work that we can do
[52:20] &gt;&gt; because there can be nobody who can do
[52:22] greater works than than him but you know
[52:25] when when God corrected his prophet in
[52:27] the spoken of shalom both shalom
[52:30] messages he says you know I've and he
[52:32] says so himself he says I've said many
[52:35] times I have corrected that from greater
[52:38] to more
[52:38] &gt;&gt; yes
[52:39] &gt;&gt; and he says No, no, no. But it actually
[52:42] is greater. And he says, you know, when
[52:44] he was here on earth, he took a fish
[52:46] that already existed and he multiplied
[52:48] it.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; He took bread which was there already,
[52:51] multiplied it. Took water which was
[52:54] water already, turned it into wine. But
[52:56] he says in my ministry when there was no
[52:59] squirrel there, he spoke the squirrel.
[53:03] Hallelujah. call it what? Greater works.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Because now it's the double portion of
[53:10] Elijah's ministry that must also be in
[53:12] us.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; We must absolutely manifest the same
[53:16] power in us today because what the Lord
[53:19] Jesus Christ did, he must do greater in
[53:22] our ministry. when he is manifesting
[53:25] himself as the bride
[53:27] &gt;&gt; because Elisha and the prophet says it
[53:30] many times that Elijah and Elisha is a
[53:33] type of Christ and the bride.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; So what he did in Christ he must do
[53:40] greater in the bride. What he what what
[53:43] we saw him manifesting here we must see
[53:45] more of in the bride. And he says in
[53:48] letting of the pressure he says look
[53:51] here as Elijah that great prophet a type
[53:53] of Christ Elisha a type of the church
[53:56] which a double portion of the spirit
[53:58] come upon the prophet he walked to the
[54:00] Jordan one day a type of this day the
[54:03] government and things that we have now
[54:05] Ahab Jezeb there circumstances the
[54:08] spirit everything that you see in that
[54:10] time is what we seeing today the same
[54:12] spirit the government everything is Ahab
[54:15] is exactly the same as we what we are
[54:17] seeing today and then Elijah comes on
[54:19] the scene
[54:20] &gt;&gt; because there must be a rapture that
[54:22] takes place
[54:23] &gt;&gt; and remember my my Jezebel sermon notice
[54:26] when Elisha following Elijah for a
[54:28] reason. Amen. Where did he take him to?
[54:31] To Jordan to Ramoth Gillad up to the
[54:33] school of the prophets and on down to
[54:36] Jordan. That's where that's the way he
[54:39] takes you also through justification,
[54:42] sanctification, and to die out to
[54:45] receive life.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; And and and we know that, you know, we
[54:48] just read where he says, you know, when
[54:50] when he takes you through that bleach,
[54:52] that Clorox so that in you may be his
[54:55] life.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; And for that to happen, you must die to
[54:59] yourself.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; And that's why the Bible says you must
[55:01] be born again.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; So there must be a new birth. The old
[55:05] man must die with his deeds as the Bible
[55:08] says so that there must be a new man who
[55:11] after the image of the one who created
[55:15] the the new man on the inside is made of
[55:18] the image of the creator which is
[55:21] exactly what God was doing in the garden
[55:23] back in Genesis chapter one as the
[55:25] prophet of God says it's as if he was
[55:27] learning more and more and more but what
[55:29] he was looking at was to see a man in
[55:33] his own image. God was looking to see
[55:36] himself.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants to see in you
[55:38] and I today is to see himself in us.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; And and then you know a perfect type of
[55:46] the church and Christ. And he says um
[55:51] the same with we're looking at Elijah
[55:53] and the prophet of God says in spiritual
[55:55] food and juices in paragraph 96 says and
[55:57] notice before the drought begin Elijah
[56:01] went into this place of secret for his
[56:03] living a very type of before the
[56:07] judgment starts to strike the earth. The
[56:10] church is already called out. The blind
[56:13] is already chosen. Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And just waiting before the judgment
[56:18] strikes and waiting, eating the food of
[56:23] God.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we are eating, brother. Is
[56:26] what? The food of God.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE FOOD OF GOD? IS it full
[56:31] revelation?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; What the prophet calls the seven course
[56:35] meal. Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet says they ate
[56:39] rabbits in the other church ages, but
[56:41] you and I here are eating a seven course
[56:45] meal.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; I love it. And when he calls it what?
[56:48] It's the food of God.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; That's what the food of God is not a a
[56:53] you know the prophet says you can't
[56:55] measure in miners.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; It must be the message that comes after
[57:00] the healing service.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; That's what we are feasting on today.
[57:04] the food of God.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Enjoying the blessings of God. The same
[57:09] way that Elijah, he had to go before the
[57:13] drought came. The Bible says he and
[57:16] [laughter] we we know the story of how
[57:18] he was sustained by the Romans or he was
[57:20] sustained by the widow. We know that and
[57:22] the prophet of God is saying he was a
[57:25] type of us that in this you know and and
[57:28] and we know in Amos chapter 8. Let's
[57:30] read it so that we connect these things
[57:33] to see what kind of drought are we
[57:35] talking about which is the Bible puts it
[57:38] very well here in Amos 8:1
[57:41] that you know there shall come a drought
[57:44] a thirst and this hunger and it won't be
[57:47] a a a physical hunger
[57:50] and the Bible says in Amos chapter 8
[57:52] vers 11 and 12 says behold the days come
[57:56] sayaeth the Lord and I will send a
[57:59] famine in the and not a famine of bread,
[58:03] nor a thirst for water, but of hearing
[58:06] the words of the Lord. And they shall
[58:09] wander from sea to sea, and from the
[58:11] north, even to the east, and they shall
[58:14] run to and fro to seek the word of the
[58:18] Lord, and shall not find it.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; But we thank God THAT FOR THE BRIDE OF
[58:23] CHRIST, THE FOOD OF GOD HAS BEEN
[58:26] PROVIDED.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; OH, STORE UP THE FOOD. WE ARE EATING ON
[58:30] THE STORED UP FOOD IN THIS LAND because
[58:33] we like Elijah HAS BEEN SET ASIDE THAT
[58:36] in the end when there's this drought and
[58:38] famine in the land people are JUST
[58:40] TRYING TO CREATE THEIR OWN things
[58:42] &gt;&gt; even dare I say in what is called a
[58:45] message
[58:46] &gt;&gt; people I don't know I think they get
[58:48] bored with just focusing on the WORD OF
[58:51] GOD THEY WANT SOME FANTASTIC things
[58:53] [laughter] but that's not what God has
[58:54] promised us brother sister he has
[58:56] promised us his word
[58:58] &gt;&gt; the Message of the hour is to restore
[59:00] the word of God.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet OF GOD SAYS, "I
[59:04] WONDER IF YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY
[59:07] &gt;&gt; IMPRESSED BY THE [clears throat] WORD."
[59:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Sufficiently must doesn't just impress
[59:12] YOU A LITTLE BIT.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE sufficiently impressed by
[59:15] the word.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; THE WORD MUST BE ALL that impress you
[59:20] &gt;&gt; because there's A HUNGER OUT THERE. AND
[59:23] GOD, LIKE HE DID WITH ELIJAH before he
[59:26] raptured him, what did he do? He set him
[59:29] aside
[59:30] &gt;&gt; and he sustained himself.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's DOING TODAY WITH
[59:34] HIS OWN BRIDE.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; He is sustaining us himself.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Giving us what? The food of God.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord in THIS HOUR, THE
[59:45] REVELATION of the word,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; not some gimmick that we need to try and
[59:50] manufacture. But we must stay under the
[59:54] sun, the S O N of God until we ripen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Stay right under this ministry.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; STAY RIGHT UNDER this word.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; It has [clears throat] this THE KEY FOR
[1:00:05] A BODY CHANGE.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; It's How many years did Abraham and
[1:00:10] Sarah have to wait for the promise to
[1:00:12] COME TO PASS? 25 YEARS.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; And Noah had to preach 120 years. YES,
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; BUT HOLD ON
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; SOON AND VERY SOON like our pastor said
[1:00:24] on this much greater distance that HAS
[1:00:27] BEEN COVERED GOD AND YOU KNOW I was I
[1:00:30] was I was a a a speaking to a man of God
[1:00:34] last year sometime who has been in the
[1:00:36] message for 50 years I'm not even 50
[1:00:38] years he has been preaching for 50 years
[1:00:42] in the message and he told me something
[1:00:44] that really struck my heart and he he he
[1:00:47] said that you He can see after all these
[1:00:51] years, he can see the progression of the
[1:00:54] revelation.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; What they saw and what they could see in
[1:00:58] the message back then
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; to what God is doing today is not the
[1:01:02] same.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A GREAT OUTPOURING OF REVELATION
[1:01:05] HAPPENING TODAY.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; AND YOU AND I MUST NOT MISS IT. BROTHER,
[1:01:09] I WANT TO HOLD ON TO SOME OLD. NO, NO.
[1:01:12] GOD, REVELATION IS ALIVE.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; And and with with life there is growth.
[1:01:18] And that's why these kids are as TALL AS
[1:01:20] THEY ARE NOW. THERE'S GROWTH BECAUSE
[1:01:22] THEY ARE ALIVE. And you and I also, you
[1:01:25] know, there must be something that we
[1:01:27] are seeing happening in our OWN LIVES
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD IS JUST SHOWING US MORE and
[1:01:32] more and more in this way
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; because he's sustaining us. He's
[1:01:37] preparing us for a body change
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; like he did Elijah of old who is a type
[1:01:44] of us.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; And and and and Yeah. And so I love how
[1:01:48] the prophet of God puts it here. It
[1:01:49] really is just so so so wonderful that
[1:01:53] you know we are eating what? The food of
[1:01:56] God.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And you know um and the bride already
[1:02:01] chosen already waiting enjoying the
[1:02:03] blessings of God you know and and he
[1:02:05] says you know with with even with your
[1:02:08] model normal mind you can see that we
[1:02:10] headed straight to the hour of jment.
[1:02:12] You can see you can just see that things
[1:02:14] cannot can continue for much longer.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Something has to something has to give
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; and and and and and that is us giving
[1:02:22] way for destruction to come through.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; The bride has to leave because for the
[1:02:27] bride you must receive the word complete
[1:02:30] atonement.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; We're not going through the tribulation
[1:02:32] period.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; We shall go to the wedding supper.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, with our Lord up there
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; when he comes to reveal himself to his
[1:02:41] brethren, the Jews
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; through what? The same message.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal for us, the seventh
[1:02:47] trumpet for them,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; revealing what? Christ.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Christ being revealed,
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; showing them who he is. And God's
[1:02:55] provided place of worship. Again,
[1:02:56] paragraph 146 is the prophet of God
[1:02:59] says, "And one day he got so tired that
[1:03:01] God sent a cher down from heaven and
[1:03:04] horses of fire and took him up." He was
[1:03:06] so full of that quickening power.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Trusting the with THE WORD OF GOD IN his
[1:03:13] heart.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; The quickening power was the word of God
[1:03:17] in his heart.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; That is what was the quickening power.
[1:03:20] That was the chariot that came to take
[1:03:23] him up was the word in his heart. He
[1:03:26] become so full of quickening power that
[1:03:29] it quickened him.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; The rapture, the spoken rapture,
[1:03:34] paragraph 151, the prophet of God says,
[1:03:37] notice, we find out that this great
[1:03:40] quickening power struck Enoch.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; It quickened him. It quickened him and
[1:03:46] he went home without dying.
[1:03:49] [clears throat]
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:50] And you know,
[1:03:52] you see how God somehow just made it
[1:03:56] thus that for all the years of the
[1:04:01] prophet's ministry, he waited until the
[1:04:04] last few days to preach THE RAPTURE.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; JUST RIGHT TOWARDS THE END,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; SHOW THAT it's it's the final thing that
[1:04:11] he must bring what this rapture is.
[1:04:14] Right towards the end it struck Elijah
[1:04:18] quickened him till he went home without
[1:04:21] dying.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; We find out his successor was Elijah
[1:04:26] which is a type there of Christ and a
[1:04:29] church.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Elisha. Now remember in Christ we are
[1:04:34] flesh of his flesh, bone of his bones.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; We when God wounded Christ at Calvary,
[1:04:41] he was wounded for me and you. Yes,
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; we are flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:04:45] his bone, body of his body,
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; name of his name. The whole family in
[1:04:51] heaven and on earth is called by his
[1:04:54] name.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE ARE. WE ARE CALLED BY HIS
[1:04:57] NAME.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; We are Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; WE ARE IDENTIFIED IN WHEN WE together
[1:05:04] talk about our identity.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what we must see our
[1:05:08] identity. When you take out the identity
[1:05:11] card, it must show Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus Christ. That's who we are.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for me and we are flesh
[1:05:20] of his flesh. Bone of his bone, born of
[1:05:22] name on it, bride of him. So we are in
[1:05:25] him. We are his flesh and his bones. And
[1:05:29] God has already raised us up
[1:05:32] because of this quickening power of the
[1:05:36] word that is in us. The promise SAYS GOD
[1:05:38] HAS RAISED UP potential because the
[1:05:41] power to change you is in you.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And we know how that you know I love the
[1:05:48] reason I always say that I love reading
[1:05:51] these quotations and reading the Bible
[1:05:52] because I find that I can't put anything
[1:05:56] better than what the prophet puts it.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; I can't put it better than what the
[1:05:59] prophet puts it.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; So I find even the prophet gives us all
[1:06:03] the examples, you know, all of these
[1:06:04] things. We find it all in the word.
[1:06:07] Hallelujah.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; And how you know if you have five rand
[1:06:09] and you want to go buy okay bread is not
[1:06:12] about five rand but yeah okay [laughter]
[1:06:13] if you have 20 rand and you want to buy
[1:06:15] bread and you are hungry when you have
[1:06:18] the 20 rand you potentially have bread
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; because you have the means to buy the
[1:06:24] bread
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and that's [clears throat] what the
[1:06:26] prophet of God is saying here God has
[1:06:27] already raised us up potentially why
[1:06:31] because the quickening power to change
[1:06:33] these bodies is already in you
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; the quickening power that that's why the
[1:06:38] Bible says in the same spirit
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; that raised Jesus from the dead dwells
[1:06:43] in you
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; it will quicken your mortal body
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; and that same spirit is is in you and I
[1:06:49] today
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; it has potentially raised us up in
[1:06:52] Christ Jesus which the resurrection will
[1:06:55] bring us forth in the full maturity
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; so we are already potentially what the
[1:07:02] resurrection and the change of body will
[1:07:04] be the full potential of it.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; But what we what we need for that, we
[1:07:10] have.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And and and for you to be in there, you
[1:07:15] must have it.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Much like the 10 virgins, you know, they
[1:07:19] were all in the same place, all having
[1:07:22] received the message, all having kept
[1:07:24] themselves clean, they were virgins.
[1:07:26] They believed that he was coming. They
[1:07:28] believe that the rapture is coming. But
[1:07:32] one set of virgins did not have this
[1:07:35] quickening power in.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; And without that, no matter how much
[1:07:39] under expectation they said, no matter
[1:07:41] how much they believed in his coming,
[1:07:43] without the potentials,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; they had no they had no part. When the
[1:07:48] bridegroom came, they had no part. They
[1:07:52] couldn't take part in the resurrection
[1:07:54] because they did not have oil in their
[1:07:56] lamps. They did not have the spirit of
[1:07:59] the bridegroom.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; And I love how the prophet of God say
[1:08:02] he's improving his word. The bridegroom
[1:08:05] call will come right through this
[1:08:07] through this what is the ministry of the
[1:08:09] son of man.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; That's what the bride the ministry of
[1:08:12] the right son of man is the bridegroom
[1:08:15] call.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; So it's for you to tune into the right
[1:08:18] channel.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; To hear the bridegroom call.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Any other channel you won't hear it.
[1:08:24] Yes,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL BE LIKE THE FIVE FOOLISH virgins
[1:08:26] sitting right here in the church,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; believing that he's coming, believing
[1:08:30] the believing that God sent a prophet,
[1:08:32] living clean, but you miss the
[1:08:34] bridegroom call.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister, may God help us
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; that we TUNE INTO THE RIGHT CHANNEL,
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; that son of man channel,
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; channel 777,
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; the seven seal channel this morning, so
[1:08:48] that we can hear the bridegroom call.
[1:08:50] Hallelujah.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; The key for the rapture BECAUSE THAT'S
[1:08:54] WHAT GOD IS DOING TODAY IS PREPARING his
[1:08:56] bride for the rapture.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And he says in the rapture again
[1:09:00] paragraph 40 he says
[1:09:04] it wouldn't have worked. Neither would
[1:09:06] Jesus message have ever worked of Moses
[1:09:11] and neither would West Wesley's message
[1:09:13] were ever worked in Luther or Luther's
[1:09:16] message vice versa. And today we our
[1:09:19] last great reformation was Pentecost.
[1:09:22] The prophet calls Pentecost a great
[1:09:24] reformation.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; So there must be the coming of the word
[1:09:28] after that because it's still part of
[1:09:29] the reformation,
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; the restoration of the gifts.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And today more we are moving from that.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; So we must move from that.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And the Pentecostal message one mix with
[1:09:43] this.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER DAY. AMEN.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; John in Revelation 4:1, the prophet of
[1:09:50] God says he had just been LIFTED UP
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; OUT OF THE SEVEN CHURCH AGES.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; There is a lifting up out of the seven
[1:09:58] churches for the bride.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; John representing the bride [applause]
[1:10:02] being lifted UP OUT OF THE SEVEN CHURCH
[1:10:05] AGES.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; For what? To receive
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; the message for the rapture.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We must be in a particular
[1:10:15] environment, a particular dimension
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; for us to receive this.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; You know, Abraham and Lot were in the
[1:10:24] same area.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; We know that.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Abraham stood with the Lord
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; and could see Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:10:32] said, "No, but what if there's 40? What
[1:10:35] if there?" until finance.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; They could see they were in the same
[1:10:40] area but Abraham was not in the same
[1:10:44] dimension as Lord.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; His visitation was very different.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; What he was experiencing
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; with Elohim made Christ in HIS HOME WAS
[1:10:57] VERY DIFFERENT.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; The message he received was very
[1:11:01] different.
[1:11:02] was a message that changed the body of
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; and that's why when they went down
[1:11:10] the young king wanted to marry a 90 YEAR
[1:11:13] OLD WOMAN
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; WHY BECAUSE HER body had been changed
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; and as the prophet teaches us as a
[1:11:20] 90year-old woman there's no way she
[1:11:23] could bear birth pain
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; so God had to change her body
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; and it was that ministry
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; OF GOD ELOHIM.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Coming down in flesh again,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; the son of man ministry.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And it is that ministry that Luke 17
[1:11:41] says, AS IT WAS,
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; SO SHALL IT BE.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; And we say, as it was, so it is.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; That's what we are living through today.
[1:11:51] That is what the [applause] bride is
[1:11:53] experiencing today.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Because it's another day.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; It's another dimension.
[1:12:01] lifted up out of the seven churches.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; We are not in theian condition.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; We are now
[1:12:10] condition. [applause and cheering]
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; We are sitting under the ministry of the
[1:12:14] son of man.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; God himself has come down to come and
[1:12:18] reveal this whispering secret to his
[1:12:22] bride.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Whom he has set aside,
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; whom he is feeding and and and and and
[1:12:29] and filling with the power for a body
[1:12:33] change,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; whom he is transforming himself.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; So she must look exactly like him
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; because we we we are holding
[1:12:45] [cheering and applause] there's a
[1:12:46] holding in happening. WHY? SO THAT we
[1:12:49] can connect with God.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God teaches us that
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; he must find the same ministry.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; It must be the SAME MINISTRY IN THE
[1:12:59] BRIDE for it to connect.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Can't be anything else. It must be the
[1:13:04] same ministry.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; What he's what he comes to connect with
[1:13:09] is what he sees of himself. What made
[1:13:12] God to STOP IN GENESIS WAS when he saw
[1:13:15] himself,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; a man who reflected God.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; And that's what this connection, the
[1:13:21] union that takes place here is the
[1:13:24] manifestation OF THE REVELATION OF THE
[1:13:27] SON of God.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Not just the manifestation thereof.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; That revelation must be made flesh in
[1:13:33] you and I.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS TO UNITE WITH.
[1:13:37] AMEN.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Unites with a people on the face of the
[1:13:40] earth who look exactly like him,
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; who have the same POWER, THE SAME THING,
[1:13:45] THE SAME POTENTIAL.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; SHE is him.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; The bride may
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; bride has come on the scene.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; To prepare. And God is preparing us for
[1:13:57] a rapture.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Focused on that for you and I.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; It's all the word of God.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:08] But it's building. No. So what he means
[1:14:11] is that all of those Luther WEST, IT'S
[1:14:13] ALL THE WORD OF GOD, but it's he's busy
[1:14:16] building.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And he wants this building to be
[1:14:19] complete.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want it to end at the roof at
[1:14:22] at the the window or No, no, no. Then
[1:14:24] it's not a complete building. If you END
[1:14:26] ANYWHERE ELSE OR PENTECOST, NO, YOU ARE
[1:14:28] JUST AT the window level. Maybe you put
[1:14:31] no the slab. Maybe you put the slab on,
[1:14:33] it looks like, ah, oh, the slab is on.
[1:14:35] NO, THERE MUST BE A ROOF THAT comes on
[1:14:37] top
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; and that head stone must come and
[1:14:40] connect
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; to complete the building.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Like the feet and arms coming up. It's
[1:14:47] forming a bride for what? For the
[1:14:50] rapture.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:14:54] they leave their message. All of them
[1:14:56] come out. That was in the bride. And and
[1:14:59] you know, let's just read it nicely and
[1:15:01] we we'll say something just now what the
[1:15:03] prophet show. Just like life going
[1:15:06] through a stock of wheat, it leaves the
[1:15:08] wheat, the hull, but the wheat forms
[1:15:10] itself like the gem of wheat that fell
[1:15:13] in the ground. That C of wheat that had
[1:15:16] fallen to the ground just like Jesus had
[1:15:18] to fall to rise again. So did the church
[1:15:21] of Pentecost had to fall. It had to go
[1:15:23] into the ground dark ages. Any grain
[1:15:26] that goes into the ground, it has to lay
[1:15:28] in the dark time to bring forth. But it
[1:15:30] started sprouting in Martin Luther come
[1:15:32] on through Wesley on out into Pentecost
[1:15:35] now
[1:15:37] in to go out to the grave.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And now the denominational system that
[1:15:42] they left behind their stocks that's all
[1:15:45] is to be banned the denominational
[1:15:47] system. But the real grain of wheat that
[1:15:51] come out of each one of those
[1:15:53] reformations will be caught up in the
[1:15:57] bride.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It all together will make the
[1:16:00] bride.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; But now we are the completion of THAT
[1:16:05] BRIDE.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; ALL OF THE elected and and let in every
[1:16:10] church age there was a people let him
[1:16:13] that has an ear hear what the spirit let
[1:16:15] him that hear what the spirit say. So
[1:16:17] there were there were the the the
[1:16:19] elected out of each church age
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; forming what? The bride. Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And we are that final force. WE ARE THE
[1:16:27] COMPLETION OF THAT BRIDE. And that's why
[1:16:30] the Bible says Hebrews 11
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; that they without us may not be made.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God teaches us that
[1:16:38] the key for the resurrection is in the
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; For for there to be a resurrection of
[1:16:46] the dead saints to listen to that voice
[1:16:48] as the pastor was saying. That's why I
[1:16:49] was saying all it's exciting when you
[1:16:52] hear a pastor coming to make opening
[1:16:53] remarks and he just it it encourages you
[1:16:56] that maybe that's what God wanted us to
[1:16:59] say this morning. And it's that voice,
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; that same voice of the resurrection
[1:17:04] because we also know that there's three
[1:17:05] part the shout, the voice, and the
[1:17:08] trumpet. And it's all wrapped up in
[1:17:10] exactly the same ministry.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Because the shout being the message, the
[1:17:14] the prophet of God says it's we who hold
[1:17:18] the key for their resurrection. Yes.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Without us getting to our ought to be
[1:17:25] condition,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; they lay there.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Without catching the revelation, they
[1:17:30] lay there.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; They without us are not made perfect.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; So we have to reach our perfection. And
[1:17:38] why is our perfection? The prophet says
[1:17:40] the ministry reaches perfection. When it
[1:17:42] reproduces
[1:17:44] Jesus Christ AGAIN
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; IN HUMAN FORM. [applause] He must
[1:17:48] reproduce Jesus Christ again in HUMAN
[1:17:51] FORM. THAT IS THE perfection of the
[1:17:53] ministry. And it's that perfection that
[1:17:57] will then unlock the resurrection.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; The same voice that rose Lazarus up.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Well, IT'S THE SAME VOICE THAT THEY WILL
[1:18:07] HAVE TO HEAR and is the same trumpet
[1:18:10] that ushers in what? The marriage
[1:18:12] supper.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL WRAPPED UP IN THE SAME MINISTRY
[1:18:14] OF Malachi 4. That's why the prophet
[1:18:16] says Jesus does all three as he's
[1:18:19] coming. [laughter]
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; It's all in the same. It's not some
[1:18:22] other thing. It's the message that you
[1:18:24] and I have received
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; in it. It's got everything.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; I mean everything.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; It's the That's why the prophet says
[1:18:34] it's the same message that goes to the
[1:18:37] Jews.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; It's what the same message. Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; The entire thing was revealed and
[1:18:44] completed in the message that you and I
[1:18:46] have revealed and received.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And God is not going to add. He's not
[1:18:50] going to do anything else even when
[1:18:53] Moses and Elijah go because the the
[1:18:55] reason is Moses and Elijah even in the
[1:18:58] ministry [laughter] of our prophet was
[1:19:01] represented Moses ministry and Elijah's
[1:19:05] ministry
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; in the ministry OF THE PROPHET. THAT'S
[1:19:08] WHY MALACHI 4:4 SAYS, "OH, remember ye
[1:19:12] the law of Moses before behold I SEND
[1:19:15] YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET." IT'S REMEMBER
[1:19:18] THE LAW OF MOSES BECAUSE in the ministry
[1:19:21] of this Elijah will represent both Moses
[1:19:24] and Elijah
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; and just so that maybe let's just go via
[1:19:28] that detour quickly to to see how you
[1:19:31] know when you read in the Bible you read
[1:19:32] in in the book of Exodus how Moses had
[1:19:35] to take the tabernacle out
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; and he took it out and and how when he
[1:19:39] went in there the cloud came before the
[1:19:41] tabernacle and the people came out of
[1:19:43] their their their
[1:19:46] camp and beheld that cloud of fire on
[1:19:50] the door of the tabernacle. We read that
[1:19:52] scripture. I want to read it now. And
[1:19:54] and we read in marriage and divorce and
[1:19:55] many other spoken way the prophet of God
[1:19:58] when God spoke to him to reveal the
[1:20:01] truth behind marriage and divorce.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; He had to go to the mountain and what
[1:20:05] did they see? They saw the pillar of
[1:20:06] fire
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; coming down to speak to the prophet
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and they the prophet of God says the
[1:20:12] children had to come out of school
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; and to to witness God speaking to his
[1:20:17] prophet the same that he did to Moses.
[1:20:20] So the ministry of Moses and Elijah in
[1:20:22] the prophet
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; and that's why I say everything was
[1:20:26] revealed and manifested in this message.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; And that's why it's the same that goes
[1:20:32] to the Jews with Moses and Elijah taking
[1:20:36] the same message to the Jews to go do
[1:20:38] what? Reveal Christ.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; No other revelation. And that's why
[1:20:43] they'll say where did you get those?
[1:20:45] from the house of my friends.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; It's they will now receive their true
[1:20:50] atonement because they rejected the
[1:20:52] atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:20:55] now when they see like we Zechariah
[1:20:58] prophesied, they will see those nails
[1:21:00] and they they will receive their true
[1:21:03] atonement.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; The feast of atonement will then be
[1:21:07] celebrated because it will be restored
[1:21:09] by the ministry. And for us, we have
[1:21:12] seen it. We have received it because the
[1:21:15] prophet says for the bride who has
[1:21:18] become the word there's been a complete
[1:21:20] atonement.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; We we when we see ourselves in the Lord
[1:21:24] Jesus Christ we see that he's already
[1:21:27] died for us.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; We see that you know when he died John
[1:21:30] chapter 1920 we see that you know they
[1:21:32] hadn't already pierced his side. So the
[1:21:35] spirit the water and the blood hadn't
[1:21:38] come out yet. The bride hadn't come out
[1:21:40] yet. And that's when he died. He He was
[1:21:42] already dead and you and I had died in
[1:21:45] him.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; In him
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; and our atonement was paid for in him
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; and therefore there's no more
[1:21:51] tribulation for us.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; That's why we just go to the marriage
[1:21:54] supper when he comes down to reveal
[1:21:56] himself.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; And what what is it? It's all together
[1:22:00] in this word of God. all together in the
[1:22:03] bride of Christ who has come to to for
[1:22:07] for her to be a representation or a
[1:22:11] manifestation of those types that we saw
[1:22:14] in Enoch, that we saw in Elijah,
[1:22:17] that we see in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:22:20] the three raptors in the Old Testament,
[1:22:22] all wrapped up and represented in us.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; The ministry that we have received is
[1:22:29] exactly what we see there. And and and
[1:22:31] [laughter] that's why I always say even
[1:22:33] when you look at the first rapture of
[1:22:35] the New Testament, which is Acts 1:9,
[1:22:37] the Old Testament saints, the the ones
[1:22:39] that walked the streets of Jerusalem,
[1:22:41] the Bible says, you know, that cloud
[1:22:44] that we see the catching of the Lord
[1:22:46] Jesus Christ. And pastor, don't
[1:22:47] excommunicate me, but I believe it was
[1:22:50] their theophonies
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; that were represented in that cloud that
[1:22:54] went up in Acts 1:9. And I believe in
[1:22:57] that cloud of 1963 is our theophony
[1:23:00] because the the prophet tells us we
[1:23:02] bypassed our theophony.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; But for you to receive this message, you
[1:23:06] have to reconnect. You must hear from
[1:23:08] your theophony. That's why that's the
[1:23:11] only way you can recognize this message.
[1:23:15] It's when you have heard from your
[1:23:17] theophony. And it's that 1963 when
[1:23:21] Christ himself comes down and we are
[1:23:24] represented in him
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; for us to see the message of the
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; without you being represented in him.
[1:23:31] There's no other way.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; We have to have been in him to be there.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; There's no other way to to receive this
[1:23:39] message if you were not there. And and
[1:23:41] and let's read the final quotation
[1:23:43] before we close. And and and that's why
[1:23:46] you know even the for for you to receive
[1:23:49] what what was that seven sealed book
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; and and we know the prophet of God
[1:23:54] teaches us that John must have seen his
[1:23:57] name in the book
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; but what [laughter] the name that he saw
[1:24:00] wasn't John didn't it's not like John
[1:24:04] via some binoculars could see the book
[1:24:07] that the lamb took no it's not that HE
[1:24:10] SAW THE REVELATION
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; OF he who he is in the book
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; because that is what the book is. It's a
[1:24:16] re God sends a revelation to you. That
[1:24:20] is you seeing your name in the book. So
[1:24:22] the only way for you to receive the
[1:24:25] revelation of the seals is for you to be
[1:24:28] represent for your name to be in the
[1:24:30] book. There's no other way. Yeah.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And that's why he says here um in
[1:24:36] identification paragraph 77 he says look
[1:24:40] to show it's the ones that he thought of
[1:24:44] his thoughts his attributes is the
[1:24:48] Christian of today.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; The thoughts before the foundation of
[1:24:53] the world.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's you and I today.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. those that were there before the
[1:24:59] foundation
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; as attributes as thoughts in him.
[1:25:03] [clears throat]
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; They are the only ones who are the
[1:25:06] Christians of today.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; They are the ones that have been
[1:25:10] prepared to receive this way.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; You are today, brother, sister, a
[1:25:15] prepared believer.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; A vessel that God prepared to come and
[1:25:19] receive the message today to come and
[1:25:22] see the word revealed in your age.
[1:25:25] Because God God is not a haphazard God.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; God is a very particular God. God is a
[1:25:31] is a a clean shot.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; That's why it says behold I sent to you.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Very particular.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; You you meet certain specifications.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; It's this message comes encrypted.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; It's got an encryption code in it and
[1:25:48] you must have the CODE TO DECIPHER THE
[1:25:51] encryption and that's the only way to
[1:25:52] receive it. Amen.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Without you being that representation,
[1:25:56] you cannot decipher this message.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; It's just too mysterious for anybody to
[1:26:01] believe.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; But it's for you and I
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; who have like that woman of at the well,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; she had a representation. And that's why
[1:26:11] even when the priests and the high
[1:26:13] priests could not see him, they called
[1:26:15] him Bianab and all, she could recognize
[1:26:18] him as the Messiah
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; because of the representation. She had
[1:26:23] something on the inside that could
[1:26:26] connect with the Messiah
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; that could decipher that. No, no, no.
[1:26:30] This one is not a son of Joseph and
[1:26:32] Mary. This is Messiah. [applause] This
[1:26:34] is God [cheering] made flesh. Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; It's you and I today. Something on the
[1:26:38] inside THAT SHOWS US A THIS IS THE WAY.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; This is the truth of the hour. This is
[1:26:45] who I am. This is revealing [laughter]
[1:26:47] you to you.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And God has so blessed you and I that we
[1:26:52] can see these things, brother, sister,
[1:26:54] in a in a in in such a a marvelous and
[1:26:59] special and and unique and and and
[1:27:02] particular way.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. IT'S NOT JUST A GENERAL
[1:27:06] REVELATION. NO, NO, NO. It's a
[1:27:08] particular revelation to you and I that

[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Go read about Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; They had a walk with the Lord.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. [singing]

[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; We can't be walking around in lysosene
[1:40:00] conditions.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; The realm of the headstone is a
[1:40:04] different atmosphere.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Different dimension,
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; different climate. [music]
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're just so thankful.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; It will take a walk in this hour.
[1:40:15] [music]
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. [singing] The word was in Enoch.
[1:40:20] [music] The word was in Elijah.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; The word was made flesh in Jesus.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we are made, the word is
[1:40:28] made flesh in us.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] we just thank him. We just
[1:40:32] love him.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; He's just making this word so much more
[1:40:35] clear to us. [singing]
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Crystallizing every point.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Making sure that we [music] connect with
[1:40:42] him.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; We are being honed, shaped.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Glory. Thank you, Jesus. [music]
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; If you want to have that walk with God
[1:40:51] this morning, if you want to experience
[1:40:53] that walk with God,
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; I love the way the brother brought it.
[1:40:56] It's the [music] word in you.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; That's going to bring the change.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Just keep eating the word. Just keep
[1:41:02] eating the word.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; This is the food of God.
[1:41:06] [music]
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; The very word you are feeding on.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Your new body, the prophet says, [music]
[1:41:14] will materialize around this word that
[1:41:16] you are eating.
[1:41:18] materialize around that word.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; What word is this? It's quickening
[1:41:23] power.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; We can [clears throat] ask the brother
[1:41:26] Joshua to pray right now.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Some of you need to surrender your lives
[1:41:30] to the Lord Jesus.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; We do not promise tomorrow.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; We are not promised another day.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; The Lord can come and change his bodies
[1:41:39] at any time.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; The stage has been set.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Is now just connecting those final
[1:41:44] pieces to the headstone, calling you up.
[1:41:47] We need to be magnetized to the
[1:41:48] headstone.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] [music]
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; You want to rededicate your life to the
[1:41:54] Lord. You want to surrender your life to
[1:41:56] the Lord Jesus. Nobody's looking around.
[1:41:58] Just make this your altar between you
[1:41:59] and the [music] Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus
[1:42:01] Christ has come for you
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; personally for you.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; He [music and singing] wants a personal
[1:42:08] relationship.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Want a personal walk
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; right now. Don't leave this place
[1:42:13] without saying, "Lord,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; I surrender to you." Young man, young
[1:42:17] woman, don't wait another moment.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; But now surrender.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Now come to Christ.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Let him reveal himself to you.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; The call is urgent.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, we are in the final hours.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; The zero hour.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Soon we have liftoff.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing]
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our brother Joshua.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you this morning, oh
[1:42:42] God.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:42:44] Lord, we're being sensitive to what you
[1:42:46] have been speaking this morning. Oh
[1:42:47] Lord,
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; once again, Lord, reminding us, Lord,
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; where we ought to be this hour, Lord
[1:42:53] Jesus.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; We know, Lord, the five ministry come to
[1:42:56] positionally place the people of God.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And Lord, bringing it now to that needle
[1:43:00] point, oh God. Lord,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; oh, we know, Lord, the headstone part,
[1:43:03] [music] Lord,
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; narrowing down, oh God. It's a narrowing
[1:43:06] down time, Lord Jesus.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord, we don't we know that you
[1:43:10] don't deal with the majority of God.
[1:43:12] Yes,
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; you deal with a minority of God.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; To take a special class of people that
[1:43:17] you are predestinated, oh God, by your
[1:43:20] elective love, you have chosen them, oh
[1:43:22] God. And we know the very life of God is
[1:43:25] in them, oh God. And Lord, they must
[1:43:27] come through in his hour, Lord Jesus, to
[1:43:29] come up and live a living high God. And
[1:43:32] not to live in amongst the chickens and
[1:43:34] little sea God, but to come with eagle
[1:43:36] silies, [applause and cheering]
[1:43:39] God. all coming to a dimension of God
[1:43:42] are set apart from every other human
[1:43:44] being upon the earth of God. For we are
[1:43:46] supernatural beings receiving a
[1:43:49] supernatural.
[1:43:51] Hallelujah. Father we might be TRAPPED
[1:43:52] IN THE FLESH. BUT ONE OF these days this

[1:44:09] Lord. right now, even now, God, we are
[1:44:12] being seated in heavenly places in
[1:44:14] Christ Jesus, Father. Oh, we thank you
[1:44:16] for your word this morning once again,
[1:44:19] Lord. Oh Lord, we know that God is here
[1:44:22] once again,
[1:44:26] Lord Jesus. The Gentile doors ARE
[1:44:28] CLOSING IN. WE KNOW THE GOSPEL MUST GO
[1:44:30] BACK TO the Jews. Oh, but Lord, THIS IS
[1:44:33] THE FINAL SHAKE UP, OH GOD. OH, IT IS A
[1:44:36] FINAL AWAKENING, oh God. Oh, to get your
[1:44:39] people into the headstone, oh God. Oh,
[1:44:41] and Lord, we know it can't come in any
[1:44:43] other way, but through a marriage union,
[1:44:45] oh God. ONLY THROUGH THE UNION CAN
[1:44:48] CHRIST BE FORMED AGAIN. OH, CHRIST be
[1:44:50] formed in a many membered body. Oh God,
[1:44:53] you do the very works that you did,
[1:44:55] Lord. THIS IS A MANIFESTING HOUR, LORD.
[1:44:58] OH, ALL THE WORD that we receive, this
[1:45:00] is our manifestation.
[1:45:02] Thank you, Lord.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name. Thank you for your
[1:45:04] servant that spoke to this. Yes, Lord.
[1:45:06] Thank you, Lord. Thank you Lord that he
[1:45:08] could heal through your Holy Spirit this
[1:45:11] morning oh God and that you could use
[1:45:13] him as your vessel to speak to your
[1:45:15] bride oh God. Oh, continue to use him.
[1:45:17] Use his ministry. Oh God, bless every
[1:45:20] believer in this place. Oh God, when we

[1:45:23] have received of you this morning. And
[1:45:25] whatever our needs of Lord, we have
[1:45:27] rightful claims over them all. All we
[1:45:30] have to do is receive our redemptive
[1:45:32] blessings by faith in [singing] Jesus
[1:45:34] name. Unto you be the praise, be the
[1:45:37] glory, be the honor in Jesus name we
[1:45:40] pray. Amen. Amen.
