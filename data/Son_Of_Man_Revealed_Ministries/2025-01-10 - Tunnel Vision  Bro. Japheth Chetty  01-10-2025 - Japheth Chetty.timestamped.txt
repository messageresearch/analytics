[1:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; To share my testimony with you.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; I
[1:41] I haven't spoken like this for a very
[1:43] very long time. So I'm bear with me. I
[1:45] think I'm a little bit nervous.
[1:48] Let me just read the scripture. Amen.
[1:50] Acts
[1:52] 9:4
[1:57] it says, "And he fell to the earth and
[2:01] and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul,
[2:03] Saul, why persecutest thou me?" I'll
[2:07] just read that portion of scripture.
[2:08] Amen.
[2:17] Please quote. Amen.
[2:21] Yeah, I am a bit nervous. Praise the
[2:24] Lord. Uh I just want to amen appreciate
[2:26] uh God's servant for giving me this
[2:28] opportunity to stand and share my
[2:30] testimony. My testimony is very very
[2:33] complicated and very complex but I'm
[2:36] just going to share just uh snippets of
[2:38] it just so that it can be a blessing to
[2:39] your hearts this evening.
[2:42] Um I just uh I'll just go just a little
[2:45] bit into where I grew up in uh chat with
[2:49] 240. I was a young man and I was growing
[2:51] up in that area. Had dreams like anyone
[2:54] else to be a successful person, study,
[2:59] complete my schooling and so on and so
[3:00] on. But as you know, Satan had his
[3:03] plans.
[3:05] But I also want to say I thank God that
[3:07] God has his plans as well.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[3:10] So Satan short circuited the plan of God
[3:12] in my life. I loved school. I excelled
[3:16] at school while I was at school but I
[3:18] couldn't complete my my schooling
[3:19] because of circumstances. I'm not going
[3:21] to go into details. It was a very rough
[3:23] area against gangsterism and all that.
[3:26] And I got mixed up in those things. You
[3:29] know they say monkey see monkey do. So I
[3:32] got influenced by the things that I saw
[3:34] and the things that people did. That's
[3:36] why it's so important for us to be
[3:38] careful the kind of books that we read,
[3:40] the kind of company that we keep, the
[3:42] kind of places that we go to because
[3:43] these things will influence your
[3:45] character.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; So I was influenced sad to say very
[3:49] negatively in my life and from a very
[3:51] young age I got involved in gangsterism
[3:53] from about 14 years of age. We got mixed
[3:56] up and left school like I said because
[3:59] of circumstances and I just went astray.
[4:04] The years went by, things didn't get
[4:05] better. It began to get worse and worse.
[4:08] I got myself involved in violence, all
[4:11] kinds of things that you could think
[4:12] about. And it just got very, very ugly.
[4:15] And some of the things I'm busy writing
[4:18] a book of my life story. I have to be
[4:20] careful because it have sometimes you
[4:22] can get legal implications. Somebody
[4:24] wanted to do a a little booklet about
[4:28] gangsterism. One young young man is busy
[4:30] talking to me at the moment, but I'm
[4:32] just My sister said, "Just be careful
[4:34] what you do and what you say and that
[4:36] type of thing." So, I really got into a
[4:40] very ugly situation. [clears throat]
[4:42] It was just getting worse and worse and
[4:44] worse by the day. And as I got older and
[4:47] older, I got deeper and deeper. I begin
[4:50] to sink deeper into this deep hole of
[4:52] gangsterism until one day
[4:56] I'm going to go fast forward. [snorts]
[4:59] Uh in 1982 there was a gang fight. I I
[5:04] was involved in that fight. Lots of
[5:06] things happened there. And uh the
[5:08] policeman that arrested me was a
[5:10] Christian policeman. His name was
[5:11] Sergeant John.
[5:13] And he came to the he witnessed the
[5:15] crime scene of the crime and everything
[5:17] that took place and all that. and he
[5:18] came to the to the court to give his
[5:21] evidence and as he was coming he bumped
[5:23] into my sister outside and they started
[5:25] talking my sister said you know my
[5:26] brother is a Christian and Sergeant John
[5:28] says everyone goes to this place and
[5:30] they become Christians he said he said
[5:33] sister you know uh it happens all the
[5:36] time they just look for a easy escape
[5:38] they try to get remission of their
[5:39] sentence judge must feel sorry for them
[5:41] and that type of thing said no you don't
[5:44] understand my brother is is a Hindu we
[5:46] are Hindus we never read the Bible. We
[5:50] didn't have any experience with
[5:51] Christianity.
[5:53] And uh he said, "Okay, let's leave it
[5:55] like that." He said, "If that's the
[5:57] case, then the Lord would speak to me."
[5:59] The policeman stood at the box and he
[6:01] was giving his evidence. And I was
[6:03] standing there and I knew with my
[6:06] previous convictions, I would have got
[6:07] at least about 15 years sentence.
[6:10] And the man asked him questions and
[6:11] asked him, he said, "Sergeant John, you
[6:13] were the assisting officer and you also
[6:14] witnessed the scene of the crime." And
[6:16] he he raised me there and he said, "Your
[6:18] honor, I only witness. I only I was only
[6:19] the arresting officer." And I was frozen
[6:21] on the box because I knew his evidence
[6:23] going to put me away for a long time.
[6:25] But God used that policeman to testify.
[6:29] And the man said, "Why are you wasting
[6:30] the court's time? Why didn't you just
[6:32] get this guy off the if there's no no
[6:34] case, there's no case?" And the case was
[6:36] cautioned this charge
[6:37] &gt;&gt; and I got out.
[6:40] But just before that, while I was in the
[6:42] waiting trial,
[6:45] we were, you know, like I said, we were
[6:47] all messed up and always swearing, using
[6:49] vulgar languages and so on. And I was
[6:51] starting to become quiet and the guy
[6:53] said, "No, this guy is worried because
[6:54] he's going to get a sentence. Just
[6:55] leave. Don't worry about him because he
[6:57] knows he's going for a long time." Then
[6:58] they said I was losing my mind. So I got
[7:00] up. I said, "Guys, no, no, you make a
[7:02] mistake." I said, "It's only now that I
[7:04] found my mind."
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Because while I was in there,
[7:07] &gt;&gt; I had an experience. That's why I read
[7:08] the scripture. I had experience in that
[7:10] place on the corner of the of the
[7:12] building. I got [clears throat] away
[7:14] from all the guys and I was sitting at
[7:15] the corner and uh I started to pray. I
[7:18] said God I don't know whether you Allah,
[7:20] whether you're Buddha, whether you
[7:21] Krishna because we were praying for
[7:22] Buddha, we do karate, you know, we
[7:24] wanted strength and all that. So we
[7:25] always praying for Buddha. We thought
[7:27] Buddha was giving us all the strength.
[7:29] So I said, "God, this is your chance to
[7:32] prove yourself to me." Brothers and
[7:33] sisters, for whatever it's worth, the
[7:35] Lord appeared to me in that waiting
[7:37] trial.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was not a Christian. I never
[7:39] read the Bible. I knew nothing. I never
[7:41] been to Sunday school. I knew nothing
[7:43] about the Lord. Absolutely nothing. I
[7:45] was just a raw ethe getting messed up,
[7:48] getting involved in violence, doing all
[7:49] kinds of nonsense. And the Lord appeared
[7:51] to me in that waiting trial.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; And when the Lord appeared to me, my
[7:56] whole life was transformed immediately.
[7:58] So within like seconds,
[8:00] &gt;&gt; my thinking was changed. My mind was
[8:02] changed. I went there. I started hugging
[8:04] these guys. I said, "Guys, you don't
[8:05] know what happened to me just now."
[8:07] Amen.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; I said I met with God. Now there were
[8:09] Zenzi guys there. There were Muslim guys
[8:11] or Hindu guys. He asked me which God did
[8:13] you meet now.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; So it was a problem for me because it's
[8:17] difficult. I'm only having experienced
[8:18] the Lord for the first time in my life.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; I no Christian background or anything.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; And I said I said gentlemen I said I met
[8:25] with the Lord Jesus Christ but he said
[8:27] you're not a Christian. He said we know
[8:28] you you're a Hindu. I said that's the
[8:31] problem. I said because all these years
[8:33] I've been a Hindu nothing worked for me.
[8:35] But tonight at 7:00 while I was sitting
[8:37] in that corner, I said the Lord appeared
[8:39] to me.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; My entire life was transformed. When I
[8:42] came out of there,
[8:44] &gt;&gt; one thing led to the next thing. But I'm
[8:46] not going to get into details. But I
[8:48] tell you brothers and sisters, it was
[8:49] such a glorious life.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; And one Sunday morning, we were coming
[8:53] from church. Uh just before that, we
[8:56] just backtrack a bit. I took the youths
[8:58] and went to Caesar. It's up there in
[9:00] clowns somewhere. We used to go and fast
[9:02] and pray for a week. Sometime we spend a
[9:04] month there. So we were busy fasting and
[9:06] praying. We met a brother.
[9:09] I was 5 years in the denomination
[9:10] actively involved bringing souls to the
[9:12] Lord. We started with about 10 or 12
[9:14] people. Within 6 months we had about 50.
[9:16] The next couple of months it just grew
[9:18] until we had 4 to 500 people. We had a
[9:20] building like this. We had it was a
[9:22] massive building new cottage and the
[9:24] Baptist church was next to us. For some
[9:26] unknown reason they left. We broke the
[9:27] wall. We took the entire building. We
[9:29] had over 500 people within a year's
[9:31] time.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[9:31] &gt;&gt; And God just be to bless bless us with
[9:34] capacity with people and that type of
[9:36] thing. People's lives were being
[9:37] transformed and they knew that I gave my
[9:39] heart to the Lord. It was it was
[9:41] catching for them. If this guy can do it
[9:43] then God can do it for us. Many of them
[9:45] came to give their hearts to the Lord.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; So it was 5 years in the denomination
[9:49] and while I was in there I was preaching
[9:51] that Sunday morning and I preached where
[9:53] are the prophets of old?
[9:54] &gt;&gt; I said one of these days I said a person
[9:56] will step on the scene and he'll say
[9:58] thus sayeth the lord. And we said a few
[10:00] things like that on those lines and we
[10:02] left and this young man that used to
[10:03] play guitar in the church. We were
[10:04] walking up and while we were at Cababanu
[10:09] I I met a brother by the name of Andre.
[10:12] He was a police captain. So he was busy
[10:14] preaching talking to me about the
[10:15] message telling me there's a prophet and
[10:17] so on and so on. You know in
[10:19] denomination you start doing your own
[10:20] researches and so on. So we were doing a
[10:22] research on minor prophets and major
[10:23] prophets. And God was so good because
[10:26] this brother came and said brother Benam
[10:27] is a major prophet. Amen.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; So it was easy for me to identify him.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; I said yes. I said, "You're 100% right."
[10:33] He gave me the prophet's life story. He
[10:35] said, "Read the book tonight." I read
[10:36] the book that within that night, the
[10:37] next morning I met the brother. I said
[10:39] to him, "Brother, you are you're
[10:41] absolutely right. This man is a
[10:42] prophet." I said, "There's no way we can
[10:44] deny his entire life. He's a prophet and
[10:45] he's a major prophet." So we agreed. He
[10:48] gave me a set of tapes. The mighty God
[10:50] unveiled. [clears throat]
[10:53] So eventually I said to him, "Brother,
[10:54] why don't you get us together as the
[10:55] youths and have a service with us?" So I
[10:58] was in a dometry in the in the hot
[10:59] house. The youths were in the dometry.
[11:01] Got them all together. We sat on the on
[11:02] the grass. We were having a service.
[11:04] While we having the service, the elders
[11:06] and the deacons came from Kosabatu. They
[11:08] said, "No one's preaching here besides
[11:10] us." So they chased his brother away and
[11:12] he was a police captain. He humbled
[11:14] himself. He packed his bag. He said,
[11:15] "Hey brother, where are you going?" He
[11:16] said, "No, I got to go, brother." I
[11:17] said, "These people don't want me here."
[11:19] And he left. So as it went on, I used to
[11:22] buy books from town, from Living Waters,
[11:24] from 320 West Street, you know, study
[11:27] books for material and stuff. So I went
[11:29] in there, I said, "You know what? I'm
[11:31] looking for books." They said, "What
[11:32] books are you looking for?" I said, "For
[11:33] of this man, William Brandon. Do you all
[11:35] have any books?" They said, "No, we
[11:37] haven't even yet of this man." I went
[11:38] from bookshop to bookshop, Methodist
[11:41] bookshop. Everywhere we started going. I
[11:43] was very, very disappointed.
[11:45] And then we were coming from church that
[11:47] Sunday morning with Robert and myself.
[11:49] As we were walking coming up, he said,
[11:51] "You know what? There's a group of guys
[11:53] here. They they benomites." Said, "You
[11:55] must be very careful because they know
[11:56] how to twist the word." So he said,
[11:58] "We're going to go there, but don't get
[12:01] caught up with these guys. They're very
[12:02] very woody. They can they know how to
[12:04] sle the word and all. Just be very
[12:06] careful." So in my mind, I'm saying I
[12:08] said that's what I did. Said this is the
[12:10] guys that I'm looking for. and and the
[12:12] brother was not even like a few meters
[12:15] away from where I live. His name was
[12:17] Jonathan. So we go to the house. It was
[12:20] uh
[12:22] brother Ivan Deck's wife's brother. So
[12:25] we go there, we sit and we talk and I
[12:28] see them having a strange type of
[12:29] behavior.
[12:31] Everyone just sits, they pray, they read
[12:33] the Bible, he offers her something to
[12:35] drink, his sister comes in, she puts the
[12:37] cool rings and she's gone. I said hey
[12:39] these people are weird you know because
[12:41] people no one's talking and everything
[12:43] is word based then I started asking
[12:46] questions you know we are denomination
[12:47] we hellfire and brimstone so I was
[12:50] fighting like a shotgun I said hey
[12:51] brother what about this what about this
[12:53] pillar of fire believe in the halo and
[12:54] you believe in this the said wait
[12:56] brother hang on let me just show you
[12:58] exodus he said this is it b of fire
[13:00] pillar of cloud so I said my mind okay
[13:02] that's fine that's that's the scripture
[13:03] so you can't deny it so we asked
[13:05] questions we went on until one day we
[13:08] kept kept on we became close friends. I
[13:09] kept on coming to his home sitting
[13:11] having fellowship talking about the
[13:13] scriptures and so on. Then I read a book
[13:15] and he was talking about baptism. I said
[13:17] I came I said brother I need to get
[13:18] baptized. He said no no no brother just
[13:20] wait let me give you a book. I said no I
[13:22] need to get baptized. Brother give me a
[13:23] book. He said convinced and then
[13:25] concerned. So I took the book. I read
[13:27] this book. I came back. I said brother
[13:29] I'm convinced. I'm very concerned. I
[13:30] need to get baptized. So he said okay
[13:33] let me get the pastor. So they took me
[13:34] in the car. They put me pastor George
[13:35] Fybe straight to I river. They baptize
[13:38] me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:42] But the sequence of events begin to
[13:43] unfold and you'll find out some of the
[13:46] things I'm going to say. I don't know
[13:48] whether you know they say if you say
[13:50] something he hold it against you. If you
[13:51] don't say it, it's still held against
[13:52] you. So it's a little bit tricky but I'm
[13:55] going to have to say brother you know
[13:56] it's it's for the benefit of us so that
[13:58] you know it make us believers stronger
[14:01] believers and so on. So from there a
[14:04] brother came to work. I was working at
[14:05] UK Zen. He came to me. He said to me,
[14:07] "Brother, uh, are you in the message?" I
[14:09] said, "Yes." He said, "Have you heard
[14:10] about the thunders?" I said, "Thunders,
[14:12] brother?" [clears throat] He said,
[14:13] "Thunders? You didn't hear about
[14:14] thunders?" I said, "No, brother." He
[14:16] said, "No, you must." So, I went, I
[14:18] started checking. Now, those days, no
[14:19] computer and message and all that. You
[14:22] have to read books.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; So, I found the scripture. Seven
[14:25] thunders give you rapturing faith. Seven
[14:26] thunders, the bride's revival. Seven
[14:28] thunders gathers the bread. So, I said,
[14:30] "Hey, there's something about these
[14:31] thunders." But you know what happened?
[14:33] Lo and behold, there were thunder camps
[14:35] that were created.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; We God help us. And God forbid that we
[14:39] ever become an elite group.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; There's no one that's better than
[14:42] anybody else.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; We all were taken out of there from the
[14:45] dust. God blew the breath of life and
[14:47] made us a living soul.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; So I actually wasn't in favor of this,
[14:52] but unfortunately I was caught up in
[14:54] that situation. So as the time went on,
[14:57] brothers and sisters,
[14:59] it went on from one thing to the next.
[15:01] Yeah,
[15:01] &gt;&gt; they were doctrinal issues. There was
[15:03] this brother George Fyberg when he came
[15:06] into the message, he gave me his
[15:08] testimony. He said when he came in, one
[15:10] of the renowned ministers said to him,
[15:12] "Brother, they introduced him to the
[15:14] message." He came into the brother's
[15:16] room, he went one night, they said, "Hey
[15:18] brother, you came too late." He said,
[15:19] "What's wrong?" Said, "Grace is over."
[15:21] [laughter]
[15:22] The brother said, "How can God send a
[15:24] glorious message like this and grace is
[15:25] over?" Many years later, the brothers
[15:27] repented. [laughter]
[15:29] You see many things that is why I'm
[15:32] actually glad that I'm identified with a
[15:34] group of people that love the word.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; I appreciate pastor Adrian. I appreciate
[15:38] ministering brothers, brother Joshua and
[15:39] so on that tries as much as possible. We
[15:42] can make human errors. We can have
[15:44] misunderstandings about things. God will
[15:46] wink at our ignorance.
[15:48] But by the grace of God, these brothers
[15:50] try to keep the message as pure as pure
[15:53] can be.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; That is very important.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Doctrine crept in. You know the greatest
[15:58] problem that keep the message of the
[16:00] hour,
[16:02] &gt;&gt; brother identified it to a false light.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; He said the greatest train robbery.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; He said they put a false light.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; They acted as railroad workers.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; They put a false light. They stopped the
[16:13] train and they robbed this train for
[16:15] millions and millions of dollars
[16:17] &gt;&gt; and they got away clean. And that's
[16:20] exactly what's happening in the message
[16:21] of the hour. There are false lights that
[16:24] are being presented.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; But thank God he's given us a message.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's given us a message that we
[16:30] can hang on to. We can hold on to this
[16:32] message because this message is is a
[16:35] message of purity.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:38] I didn't want to take quotes and so on
[16:40] and so on, but I think in all fairness,
[16:44] I'm just going to try and say a few
[16:46] things and then cap it off just with a
[16:48] quote.
[16:53] You know sometimes we take a revelation
[16:56] to somebody for example we hear some
[16:59] things our eyes we're blessed to see
[17:01] what we see and we are blessed to hear
[17:03] what we hear
[17:04] &gt;&gt; it is just the grace of God
[17:06] &gt;&gt; but sometimes you might take this and
[17:08] present it to somebody
[17:10] &gt;&gt; and that person might not see it
[17:12] &gt;&gt; yes
[17:12] &gt;&gt; there are several reasons why they won't
[17:14] see it
[17:14] &gt;&gt; I just put like one about three reasons
[17:16] here and then I'm going to read the code
[17:18] I'm going to try keep to time Because a
[17:20] prophet is subject. Amen. Praise God.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; So the spirit of the prophet is subject
[17:24] to the prophet. So I have to be
[17:25] disciplined. Amen.
[17:27] Sometimes the capacity of the person,
[17:30] you know, think the quote says we like
[17:32] change in God's pocket and so on.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes a person is not capacitated to
[17:37] understand in that level.
[17:38] [clears throat]
[17:38] &gt;&gt; We don't expect brother Eden's wife to
[17:40] understand in his capacity.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; She's called to be a housewife. She's
[17:44] got her capacity to understand in that
[17:47] Amen. the capacity God's given her.
[17:48] [clears throat]
[17:49] So God has given us different
[17:51] capacities. Not all of us are called to
[17:53] understanding that capacity. Some of us
[17:55] are called to to minister. Some of us
[17:57] are called just to be church members. So
[17:58] not everyone will understand in that
[18:00] capacity. A 50 cents will not
[18:02] comprehend. Amen. The same amount the
[18:03] way it will be with a dollar. Amen.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; The second part that I wanted to say was
[18:09] that sometime it's not the right time
[18:11] where things that we shared. My wife
[18:13] will remember some of the things we
[18:14] shared with some brothers a deacon of a
[18:16] church. He said, "No, brother, look, I
[18:18] don't agree with you." 10 years later, I
[18:19] said, "Brother, I see it clear now."
[18:21] &gt;&gt; We didn't fight. We didn't argue. We
[18:23] just said, "Brother, video, no problem."
[18:25] Said, "Look, I'm sorry, man." You know,
[18:27] that type of thing. [clears throat] And
[18:29] sometimes it's not meant for them to see
[18:31] it.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we go out to preach the
[18:34] gospel, we're preaching to two classes
[18:35] of people.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; We are preaching to souls that are in
[18:38] prison now.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; It is going to be a witness against
[18:41] them. And then we are preaching to those
[18:43] that are interested in coming the gene
[18:45] seed of God. Like we hear pastor
[18:46] preaching and brother missing brothers
[18:48] talking about the gene seed. Once
[18:49] there's representation and you preach
[18:51] they will respond to that.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; So I'm not going to say anymore. I'm
[18:56] just going to read a quotation from the
[18:59] church ages and then I'll just cap off
[19:01] my testimony. Amen.
[19:10] You see what it says in church ages page
[19:12] 16. It says here, you will recall that I
[19:16] mentioned at the beginning of this
[19:18] message that this book we are studying
[19:20] is the actual revelation of Jesus
[19:23] himself in the church and his work in
[19:25] the future ages. Then I mentioned that
[19:28] it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[19:30] revelation
[19:31] &gt;&gt; or we will fail to get it. Amen. We
[19:33] heard pastor saying that a few times
[19:35] without the Holy Spirit, you won't get
[19:37] revelation.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Bringing these two thoughts together,
[19:40] you will see that it won't just take
[19:42] ordinary studying and thinking to make
[19:44] this book real.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; You can't just have ordinary thinking
[19:48] and ordinary studying. This is a
[19:49] supernatural message. Like you said,
[19:51] brother Romesh.
[19:52] You you can be an intellectual, you can
[19:54] be a theologian, but you'll miss it a
[19:56] million miles.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; He says, "Yeah, it is it is going to
[19:59] take the operation of the Holy Ghost."
[20:02] That means that this book can't be
[20:04] revealed to anyone.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. But a special class of people.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are a special class of
[20:12] people. Like you said, Amen. We are a
[20:15] special class.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said it will take one with
[20:20] prophetic insight.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; You cannot walk on prophetic land
[20:23] without prophetic glasses.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; I can't see here without these glasses.
[20:27] Amen. So when you get on prophetic land,
[20:29] you got to have prophetic glasses. You
[20:31] got to focus and zoom in your glasses so
[20:33] you can see with clarity. Amen. You
[20:35] won't be amen tossed about by every
[20:37] window of doctrine. Amen. Somebody would
[20:39] come with something and explain
[20:40] something in a certain way. It looks so
[20:41] good. I remember brother came many many
[20:43] years from Congo. He had books. He's got
[20:45] it marked in red, in blue, in green. He
[20:48] sat at my home. He had lunch. I said,
[20:50] "Brother, with due respects, I said
[20:52] we're going to close this conversation."
[20:53] He said, "This book, the church ages
[20:55] that I'm reading from is not inspired."
[20:58] &gt;&gt; I said, "I respect you, my brother." I
[20:59] said, "You can complete your supper."
[21:01] But I said, "Discussion's over. We're
[21:02] not going to talk anymore."
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Because every book that everything that
[21:05] the prophet has been saying is inspired
[21:06] by God.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; This wasn't Amen. a a a normal man
[21:10] coming and speaking. Every day an angel
[21:12] from heaven that you come down.
[21:14] Hallelujah. The angel that you come and
[21:16] unveil, the prophet had his own ideas,
[21:17] his own views. Amen. Uriah Smith and
[21:20] different people. He wanted to take
[21:21] those teachings and explain. But the
[21:23] angel of God had to correct his
[21:24] teachings to bring this glorious message
[21:26] to us. Amen. so that we can enjoy this
[21:28] message. Hallelujah.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; So it will require Amen. It will take
[21:33] Amen. one with prophetic insight. It
[21:36] will require the ability to hear from
[21:38] God. Hallelujah.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We said those that have have an
[21:41] ear, let them hear. But some people got
[21:43] ears but they're not hearing. Why
[21:45] they're not hearing? Because there's no
[21:46] GC. There's no representation. There's
[21:48] nothing to connect with that word. Amen.
[21:50] So that's the problem. Hallelujah.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; It will require supernatural
[21:55] instruction. Yes, brother.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; You like that? Amen. Supernatural,
[21:59] brother. This is a supernatural message,
[22:00] brother Josh. Amen. He didn't come to
[22:02] us. Amen. Cheap. Amen. He didn't come.
[22:04] The prophet, Amen, lost his Amen. his
[22:06] child. He had to go through difficulties
[22:08] to problems. Amen. In Amen. in his life
[22:11] story. All that there. Amen. To bring
[22:13] this glorious message. God had to crush
[22:15] that rose. Amen. So that we could
[22:17] receive that fragrance. Hallelujah. And
[22:18] today we can enjoy this message that we
[22:20] that we enjoy so beautifully.
[22:22] Hallelujah. Not just a student comparing
[22:25] verse with verse though that is good.
[22:27] Not any student can study and take this
[22:29] thing and go into the concordance and
[22:31] get all this
[22:33] quotes on faith on redemption and all
[22:35] that and preach it. But brother, it
[22:37] takes supernatural instruction.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So praise God. Not just he said
[22:42] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[22:44] the spirit or it never becomes clear.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The a mystery requires the
[22:49] teaching of a spirit. Amen. Or it never
[22:51] becomes clear. So without the spirit,
[22:53] the mystery can never become clear. Even
[22:55] though we have the revelation, but he
[22:57] said there's still a supernatural
[22:58] element that still Amen. So praise God.
[23:01] Hallelujah.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; How we need to hear from God and lay
[23:04] ourselves open and yielded to the spirit
[23:07] to hear and to know. Brother, I'm
[23:09] thankful that God has brought this
[23:10] message my way. Amen. I'm very excited
[23:13] and happy. I'm glad to be identified
[23:15] with a group of people that love the
[23:16] [clears throat] message of the hour. And
[23:17] people do everything in their power,
[23:19] Amen, to keep this message in its pure
[23:21] state. Amen. I've been around I've been
[23:23] around to many places. I've been around
[23:24] to many churches. But I want to say God
[23:27] bless you brothers and sisters in this
[23:28] church. May the Lord just raise you up
[23:30] to be mighty warriors in the kingdom of
[23:31] God. Amen. I pray that this testimony
[23:33] has been a great blessing to your
[23:34] hearts. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's
[23:36] give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen.
[23:37] [applause]
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Look just what date did you meet that
[23:47] you said you were in that cell. Tell
[23:49] brother Joshua and brother Jeff what
[23:51] date that was.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; 23rd of July 1982.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when he told me that we knew,
[24:00] you know, Exodus 23:23, I sent my angel
[24:03] before thee.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; So on the 23rd of July 1982 is when the
[24:07] brother had the experience.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can identify with that.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's just stand together.
[24:14] We'll sing a song as we welcome dear
[24:16] brother Jaffford. Thank you, brother
[24:17] Luke, for that testimony. Amen.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate it and thank you for
[24:21] keeping to time. Praise the Lord.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll get his extended version. I
[24:26] actually wanted him to give his
[24:27] testimony to the youth because I think
[24:29] it'll help them.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he can give his complete
[24:32] testimony to the youth. Praise the Lord.
[24:34] [snorts]
[24:35] Let's [clears throat] just sing a song
[24:35] and worship the Lord as we welcome our
[24:38] brother Jaff. Amen. Let's sing.
[24:40] Hallelujah. Let's sing only believe from
[24:43] you will see you to see and then we'll
[24:46] hand over the service. [music]

[26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow for a word of
[26:53] prayer. Hallelujah. [clears throat]
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father, we come before you
[26:57] once again, Lord. Father, we thank you
[26:59] for this opportunity, oh God, to be
[27:01] gathered, Lord, with saints of like,
[27:02] precious faith. Oh God, Lord, we come
[27:05] maybe from different walks of life, oh
[27:06] God. Lord, we come, Father, with
[27:09] different characteristics, different
[27:11] views, different opinions, oh God. But
[27:13] there's one thing we have common ground
[27:14] on, Father, and that is your word,
[27:16] Father. We are united by the revelation
[27:18] of this hour, oh God. Father, we are
[27:20] gathered together by the shout of the
[27:22] hour, Lord. And father Lord now we come
[27:25] seated in heavenly places in Christ
[27:27] Jesus. Oh God and Lord we pray even as
[27:29] we sit in your presence oh God you alone
[27:32] now to break the bread father Lord we
[27:34] pray you'll break the bread unto us Lord
[27:36] that Lord the life of Christ the

[27:43] pray that your word father will be
[27:44] fulfilled in our lives oh God.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Lord take away every stress and every
[27:48] strain of this life every care every
[27:50] burden. Let's just be free in your
[27:52] presence, oh God, we break every chain,
[27:55] Lord. Oh Lord, let [applause] there be
[27:56] no bondage, Lord, in your house tonight,
[27:58] oh God. Every demon power, oh Lord, we
[28:01] command it to flee in Jesus name,
[28:04] Father. And Lord, if there's any prayer
[28:06] request, Lord, that have gone out, we
[28:07] pray, Lord, that you'll meet with each
[28:09] and every one, Lord. All that are
[28:10] unwell, Father, I pray you'll touch them
[28:12] and heal them now in Jesus precious
[28:14] name, we ask these things, oh God.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And it's
[28:20] good to be back in the house of the
[28:21] Lord.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are blessed by the testimony.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that testimony already
[28:26] got me fired up. Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's two things you mentioned,
[28:30] uh, Brother Luke.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; You mentioned about it not being the
[28:33] right time
[28:34] &gt;&gt; and you mentioned about focusing. Amen.
[28:36] When you read the quote,
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to see that in
[28:38] tonight's message. Those are the two
[28:40] themes of tonight's message. Amen.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. For for a title tonight, Amen.
[28:44] We're going to speak on tunnel vision.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And for a subject, we're going to
[28:48] speak on perfecting our focus in the age
[28:50] of adoption.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to see how important
[28:54] that is in this hour. Amen. So, let's
[28:55] just turn to our Bibles. Amen. Just to
[28:58] read an opening scripture. We'll turn to
[29:00] Proverbs chapter 4 verse 25.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Proverbs 4:2 says, "Let your
[29:15] eyes look straight ahead
[29:17] &gt;&gt; and your eyelids look right before you."
[29:20] Amen. Let your eyes look straight ahead
[29:22] and your eyelids look right before you.
[29:25] Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to
[29:27] the reading of the word. Amen. You may
[29:29] be seated at this time.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I've got a long break from
[29:36] preaching.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. A few times that it was my my turn
[29:39] to preach, I couldn't make it. So, amen.
[29:42] Um, I had a long break. Amen. So,
[29:46] tonight we just want to talk on this a
[29:48] little subject. Amen. Tunnel vision and
[29:50] perfecting our focus in the age of
[29:52] adoption. Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; You know, any preacher is is a good
[29:58] salesman. Amen.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; A preacher is trying, amen, to sell you
[30:01] something.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's trying to sell you, Amen,
[30:05] the heavenly products that God has in
[30:07] his store. Amen. Amen.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Now, any good salesman is going to do
[30:11] his very best to present to you,
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. what he has in stock. Amen.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; But now, you'll find that sometimes a
[30:20] purchaser or viewer might come into the
[30:22] store, brother agent. He might come into
[30:24] the car dealership and he'll find that
[30:26] he'll view every single car and he'll
[30:29] ask questions about every single car
[30:30] [clears throat]
[30:31] &gt;&gt; and the salesman will answer all of
[30:33] these questions. They'll give you all
[30:34] the latest features only to find out at
[30:36] the end that the viewer will say, you
[30:38] know, I'm just looking around.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; You'll find maybe maybe the viewer
[30:42] doesn't even have the money in the bank
[30:43] account.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; So, he's wasting the salesman's time.
[30:46] Amen.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; So, it takes a two parts. Amen. The
[30:49] salesman is got to do a good job in
[30:51] presenting what he has to offer.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; But the purchaser has to have the
[30:55] purchasing power.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet tells us that the
[31:00] believer's purchasing power is faith.
[31:02] Amen.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said you can have the dollar
[31:04] bill in your pocket, but you might not
[31:06] have the bread. Amen. But you have the
[31:08] capacity to purchase that loaf of bread.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight or or whenever a
[31:12] preacher is presenting what is in
[31:14] heavenly stock, Amen. You got to come
[31:16] with a purchasing power of faith. Amen.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; So that amen when the when the preacher
[31:21] is saying what he has in store and and
[31:24] what he has on sale, you can say here's
[31:26] the money. I want that. Amen. If you
[31:28] have need of healing, you can say,
[31:30] "Amen. Here's my faith. I am I am big of
[31:33] he give me that. Amen. That's right.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So tonight, Amen. when we
[31:36] are presenting the source of God. Amen.
[31:38] Exercise your faith. Amen.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, Amen. Just on this topic
[31:43] of tunnel vision, I'm pretty sure maybe
[31:46] you would have heard of people uh uh
[31:49] saying this famous saying, you have
[31:50] tunnel vision.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; So, what does that mean?
[31:54] Tunnel vision basically means when
[31:56] someone is looking at something directly
[31:59] in front of them but they are losing
[32:01] sight of the bigger picture.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Their focus is too narrow. They can't
[32:05] have a context to the broader picture.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this can be a good thing and
[32:10] it can be a bad thing. So tonight we're
[32:12] going to talk about the the negative
[32:14] side of it first and then we're going to
[32:15] go on to the positive side of it. Amen.
[32:17] And we're going to talk on some very
[32:19] basic fundamental uh Christian beliefs
[32:22] first and then we're going to bring it
[32:23] down at the end to something mature for
[32:25] the bride. Amen.
[32:28] So, amen. So, just let's talk a little
[32:30] bit on the negative negative side of
[32:32] tunnel vision.
[32:35] We if we turn to Matthew chap 23 23
[32:40] Jesus is talking here to the Pharisees
[32:43] and he says woe to you scribes and
[32:45] Pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithes
[32:48] of mint and anise and and kummen and
[32:51] have neglected the weightier matters of
[32:54] the law justice and mercy and faith.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; These you ought to have done without
[33:00] leaving the others undone.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Blind guides who strain
[33:04] out the nut and swallow a camel."
[33:07] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "Woe to you scribes
[33:09] and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you
[33:11] cleanse the outside of the cup of the
[33:13] cup and dish, but inside they are full
[33:15] of extortion and self-indulgence. Blind
[33:18] Pharisees first cleanse the inside of
[33:20] the cup and dish that the outside of
[33:23] them may also be clean."
[33:24] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[33:25] &gt;&gt; So Jesus here is addressing the
[33:27] Pharisees and the Pharisees as we know
[33:29] at that point were considered the most
[33:31] holy people.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were very strict in their
[33:34] regimen, in their religion, in the
[33:36] service of God, in their traditions, in
[33:38] the law.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; And so the Pharisees were so
[33:42] narrowsighted on what their traditions
[33:44] were and what their opinions were of the
[33:47] law that they missed the whole broader
[33:49] picture of what the law was trying to
[33:51] present.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we know, amen, that the
[33:54] law in itself could not make us perfect.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The law in fact put us in the
[33:59] prison house.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. The law was there to show us that
[34:02] we were sinners.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; But the bigger picture that God was
[34:05] trying to show us was that he was going
[34:07] to make a way for us.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was going to send a
[34:10] perpetuation for our sins who was Jesus
[34:13] Christ.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; So here was Jesus Christ in their midst.
[34:16] Amen. Performing the very works that the
[34:19] word said he would perform.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. But because they were so
[34:22] narrowsighted in their view and what
[34:24] they thought the law meant, they missed
[34:26] the whole picture.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; So in other words, they had tunnel
[34:30] vision.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. They could not see the broader
[34:33] picture.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We look at another example in John
[34:39] 9:3
[34:42] and it says they brought him who
[34:45] formerly was blind to the Pharisees. So
[34:47] here this is after now Jesus had healed
[34:50] the blind man.
[34:52] A night was a Sabbath when Jesus made
[34:54] the clay and opened his eyes. Then the
[34:57] Pharisees also asked him again how he
[35:00] had received his sight. And he said to
[35:03] them, "He put clay on my eyes and washed
[35:06] and I can see." Therefore some of the
[35:08] Pharisees said, "This man is not from
[35:11] God because he do not keep the Sabbath."
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Sure. Now here's a man who they know for
[35:17] a fact was blind.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Now can you imagine if there was a blind
[35:21] man here and you know from birth this
[35:23] guy was blind or for however how many
[35:25] years he was blind and now his eyes is
[35:28] open and the only thing you can focus on
[35:31] is that Jesus broke the Sabbath.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; You cannot see the supernatural done
[35:35] right in front of your eyes.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this can be the case in the
[35:40] message as well.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; We can go on through the years. Amen.
[35:44] believing the message as law
[35:46] &gt;&gt; and the supernatural is unfolding all
[35:48] around the world amongst the bride.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can miss the supernatural.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; And you'll come up with things like,
[35:55] "No, but there's a quote that's against
[35:57] that."
[35:58] &gt;&gt; And you'll start to mismatch quotes.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's what now the
[36:02] Pharisees were doing
[36:03] &gt;&gt; because Jesus then came and corrected
[36:05] their error and he said, "No, he was not
[36:07] breaking the Sabbath. He was the Lord of
[36:09] the Sabbath."
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he came to fulfill the
[36:12] Sabbath.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. So they were
[36:14] mismatching and misrepresenting the
[36:16] actual law.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they in other words they had
[36:20] tunnel vision.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another scripture. Amen. We're
[36:25] going to go through a few scriptures
[36:26] tonight. Amen. And a few quotes. Amen.
[36:30] Acts 10:9.
[36:34] Now we were speaking about the Pharisees
[36:36] who we know were unbelievers. But now
[36:38] let's look at how even a believer can
[36:40] have tunnel vision at times.
[36:43] Acts chapter 10. About noon the
[36:45] following day, as they were on their
[36:47] journey and approaching the city, Peter
[36:50] went up on the roof to pray. He became
[36:53] hungry and wanted something to eat. And
[36:56] while the meal was being prepared, he
[36:58] fell into a trance. He saw heaven opened
[37:02] and something like a large sheet being
[37:04] led down to earth by its four corners.
[37:07] It contained all kinds of for-footed
[37:09] animals as well as reptiles and birds.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter.
[37:16] Kill and eat."
[37:17] &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Surely not, Lord.
[37:21] I have never eaten anything impure or
[37:24] unclean." And then the voice spoke unto
[37:27] him a second time, saying, "Do not call
[37:29] anything impure that God has made
[37:32] clean."
[37:32] &gt;&gt; So now here is Peter, and this is after
[37:35] the day of Pentecost. after Peter is
[37:37] filled with the Holy Ghost,
[37:38] &gt;&gt; after Peter has been given the keys,
[37:42] &gt;&gt; but he's so blinded by him wanting to
[37:45] restrain the gospel to his own nation,
[37:47] the Jewish people, that he could not see
[37:49] that God now wants to pass on the gospel
[37:53] to the Gentiles. He could not fathom how
[37:56] God would now take the same gospel that
[37:58] the Jews had received and now hand it
[38:00] over to the Gentiles.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; He is blinded by his own pride. Amen.
[38:05] and his own selfish ways that he could
[38:07] not see. And here he is having a vision
[38:09] and the Lord is telling to him eat it.
[38:12] And he even has the audacity to say unto
[38:14] the Lord, no.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is blinded by his narrow
[38:17] vision.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could not see the broader
[38:20] vision that the Lord Jesus had for him.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:26] Amen. We look at another example now in
[38:29] Luke 10:38.
[38:32] Amen. We just want to lay this
[38:34] foundation. Amen. Before we get to the
[38:36] main context of our message
[38:39] in Luke chapter 10, that happened as
[38:42] they went and he entered a certain
[38:45] village and a certain woman named Martha
[38:48] welcomed him into her house. And she had
[38:50] a sister called Mary who also sat at
[38:53] Jesus' feet and heard his word. But
[38:56] Martha was distracted with much serving.
[38:58] And she approached him and said, Lord,
[39:01] do you not care that my sister has left
[39:03] me to serve alone? Therefore, tell her
[39:05] to help me. And Jesus answered and said
[39:08] to her, Martha, you are worried and
[39:11] troubled about many things, but one
[39:13] thing is needed, and Mary has chosen
[39:16] that good part which will not be taken
[39:18] away from her.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so here now Martha is is is is
[39:23] doing all of these helps and and and and
[39:26] [clears throat] basically showing good
[39:27] hospitality to our guest.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Now here is Jesus now. He's this famous
[39:32] minister in the land.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's famous amongst all the land.
[39:36] Amen. And here he is in their house. So
[39:39] she's not doing anything wrong now.
[39:41] She's being hospitable to her guest.
[39:43] Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Like if any minister had to come, we
[39:46] would want to be hospitable to them.
[39:48] Amen. maybe would keep them in our house
[39:50] or see to the hospitality or anything
[39:52] like that. Amen. And and hospitality on
[39:55] its own is a gift.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The apostle Paul talks about these
[40:00] gifts of helps and needs in the church.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now these gifts are important but
[40:05] however these gifts still have to come
[40:08] under subjection to the word.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you see in this context now
[40:12] even though she was doing something good
[40:14] in her own eyes she was missing the
[40:17] broader picture here was Jesus unveiling
[40:20] the word to them
[40:21] &gt;&gt; and it was time and season for Jesus to
[40:23] unveil himself to them and Mary had
[40:26] chosen that good path.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Now remember that this is the same Mary
[40:30] that was considered an ill-f an
[40:34] ill-famed woman and brought the perfume
[40:36] to anoint Jesus
[40:37] &gt;&gt; in the house of Simon.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So she understood now who Jesus
[40:43] was. And so here she was seated at
[40:45] Jesus' feet hearing from Jesus. So in
[40:48] other words, this Mary was positionally
[40:50] placed correctly at Jesus' feet.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. To hear the word of the hour.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; But now Martha now was not correctly
[40:58] positioned.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; She thought she was doing God a service.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But here now Jesus now then
[41:04] corrects her and and now Jesus is now
[41:07] bringing her into the right position.
[41:09] He's dragging her and pulling her from
[41:11] that position into the correct position.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see how Amen. We can have a
[41:16] gift even of hospitality and being good
[41:18] to people. But it needs to be in the
[41:20] right context. It needs to come under
[41:23] subjection to the word. Amen. We got to
[41:24] give the word the preeminences.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now notice after Jesus now
[41:29] corrects her and teaches her and brings
[41:31] her into a position. All right, this is
[41:33] the same Martha now that when it comes
[41:36] time and season for resurrection and
[41:38] life for the resurrection of Lazarus,
[41:41] here comes Jesus. Now, Martha goes to
[41:43] him and said, "Lord, if you have been
[41:44] here, my brother would not have died."
[41:47] &gt;&gt; And now Jesus once again putting her in
[41:49] position says, "I am the resurrection
[41:51] and the life." Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Now the same mother who Jesus has placed
[41:55] is now the carrier of the shout message.
[41:58] Amen. Because she now takes that message
[42:00] to Mary and say the master has come and
[42:02] callth for thee.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because Jesus had now
[42:05] positionally placed her. And now she was
[42:08] in the right context. Amen.
[42:10] [clears throat]
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Now she could have the right vision.
[42:12] Amen. She was no longer narrow focused
[42:14] but she could see the broader picture.
[42:16] Amen. That he was the resurrection and
[42:18] the life.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when did she have to see it?
[42:21] in time and se season of resurrection
[42:23] and life.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just like that, we are coming
[42:28] out of time and season for resurrection
[42:30] and life.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as you said, brother Luke, it
[42:33] wasn't the time yet.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; We are going to find that God has
[42:37] certain seasons and times for
[42:39] everything.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in Martha's case now, it had
[42:42] come time and season for resurrection of
[42:44] Lazarus.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Which is a type now of us. It's come
[42:47] time and season for the resurrection of
[42:50] life to produce the life of Christ
[42:52] again.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are dead to the old man. Amen.
[42:55] And the life of Christ is arisen in us.
[42:58] But in this time, Christ is positionally
[43:00] placing us. Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; And and if you have not been
[43:04] positionally placed, he's going to drag
[43:05] you into position because remember, you
[43:08] are saved. He's not going to lose you.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he knows how to drag you into
[43:12] position. Amen. So that's why he's doing
[43:14] week in week out. Amen. The word is
[43:16] coming forth. He's positionally placing
[43:18] you. Amen. Perhaps you are straining
[43:20] this way. He's dragging you from that uh
[43:22] corner. Amen. You're straining this way.
[43:23] He's dragging you from that corner. He's
[43:25] bringing you in the right position.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He's narrowing your
[43:30] focus. Amen. In the right way. Amen. To
[43:32] focus on the right things.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So th those are some of the
[43:36] negative examples. Amen. Of tunnel
[43:39] vision. Amen. But let's look at some of
[43:41] the positive examples of it. Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews chapter 12 says,
[43:46] "Therefore we also since we are
[43:49] surrounded by so great a cloud of
[43:51] witnesses,
[43:52] &gt;&gt; let us lay aside every weight."
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the sin which so easily ens
[43:58] snares us.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Let us run with endurance the race that
[44:01] he set before us. Now this is a common
[44:03] scripture. Amen. But don't let it go
[44:05] over your heads. Amen. Focus your vision
[44:08] now. Amen. On this time and season.
[44:11] Amen. Looking unto Jesus. Amen. The
[44:14] author and finisher of our faith who for
[44:17] the joy that was set before him endured
[44:19] the cross despising the shame and he sat
[44:22] down at the right hand of the throne of
[44:24] God.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here Paul is telling us to fix
[44:28] our eyes on Jesus.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Now this is a positive version of tunnel
[44:32] vision. In other words, now don't get
[44:34] distracted by the things but keep your
[44:37] vision focused on the right thing. Amen.
[44:39] Keep your vision focused on Jesus. Amen.
[44:42] the author and finish of our faith.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we consider, amen, what the
[44:47] scripture is saying about Jesus here
[44:49] because he was our example. Now, Jesus
[44:51] was a man of vision. We know that Jesus
[44:54] did nothing except he saw the father do
[44:56] it first.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was not distracted by what
[45:00] was going on in the land.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; People were trying to pull him into this
[45:04] crowd, trying to make crown him a king,
[45:06] an earthly king.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; People were wanting him to take over the
[45:10] politics of the land. They were wanting
[45:12] him to overcome the Roman authorities
[45:14] and the Roman empires. He did not get
[45:16] distracted by all of that.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; He was focused on the vision of what the
[45:20] father showed him what his time and
[45:23] season was for.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; That is why we know even when he had
[45:26] taken the scroll from the priest. He
[45:28] read the scripture that pertained to his
[45:30] life at that hour time and season.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was 100% focused on what his
[45:36] goals were.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We find that even at the age of
[45:39] 12, Amen. when his parents are
[45:42] correcting him for they thought they had
[45:44] lost him
[45:45] &gt;&gt; and now his parents are trying to
[45:46] reprimand him. They've forgotten. Amen.
[45:50] That Amen. who this child was.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; They've forgotten that the angel's
[45:54] message.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that he was Emmanuel.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now Jesus corrects them
[46:01] &gt;&gt; and he shows them that he is focused on
[46:03] the father's business. He tells him,
[46:05] "Don't you know I must be about my
[46:06] father's business."
[46:08] &gt;&gt; He was not even at the age of 12, he was
[46:10] not distracted by anything else.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So even at a young age, don't get
[46:16] distracted by the things of this world.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by what this life
[46:20] has to offer you.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; These this life can only offer you
[46:23] temporary things. Amen. And temporary
[46:26] satisfaction.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it seems at in that moment,
[46:30] Amen. when you are indulging in that
[46:32] satisfaction that that is all you need.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; But what does the Bible say? Sin looks
[46:37] pleasing. This was actually Pastor
[46:39] Ronnie's famous scripture.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; He always said this. Sin looks pleasing
[46:44] and appetizing, but when you partake of
[46:46] it, it brings forth death.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; It's only temporary satisfaction. Amen.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; So fill your hunger with the things of
[46:54] God.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have your focus fixed on Jesus.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Jesus is our example.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[47:05] One time, Amen. Peter was a hindrance to
[47:08] Jesus. Amen. [clears throat] And Jesus
[47:10] was so focused on his mission that he
[47:12] said, "Get thee behind me, Satan."
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz [clears throat] he recognized that
[47:16] this wasn't Peter. This was the devil
[47:18] trying to hinder him.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Trying to hinder the move of God.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You see sometimes you
[47:24] might be so focused on your vision and
[47:26] your very family might distract you from
[47:28] it
[47:29] &gt;&gt; or your very brothers and sisters might
[47:31] say something to try and distract you.
[47:33] Now does that mean that they are lost?
[47:35] No sir Peter wasn't lost
[47:37] &gt;&gt; but the Satan Satan can use an
[47:39] opportunity to try and entice you to try
[47:41] and stir you away from your vision.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't be deterred by what what
[47:46] the enemy is trying to do.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Stay focused on your vision.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep your eyes fixed. Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Tunnel vision. Amen.
[47:54] Hallelujah.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:57] [clears throat and cough]
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes God might just throw a
[48:03] test your way to see how focused you
[48:05] are.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might be doing well for a
[48:08] season, [clears throat] might be serving
[48:10] God faithfully, and God throws a test
[48:11] your way.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; He wants to see whether you are going to
[48:14] stray away at the first sign of
[48:16] discomfort, at the first sign of
[48:19] inconvenience.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because God needs rugged
[48:22] soldiers.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not going to take just any
[48:26] baby Christian. Amen. God has rugged
[48:29] sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And those Amen. who are his sons and
[48:33] daughters, he chastises.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's hard, corrective love.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; But it's good love.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we got to be focused. No
[48:42] matter what the trials come.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Philippians chapter 3 says, "Not
[48:48] that I have already attained or am
[48:50] already perfected, [clears throat]
[48:51] but I press on that I may lay hold of
[48:54] that for which Christ Jesus had also
[48:58] laid hold of me." Brethren, I do not
[49:01] count myself to be apprehended, but one
[49:03] thing I do, forgetting those things
[49:06] which are behind. Amen. You got to
[49:08] forget those things which are behind
[49:09] you.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Reaching forward to those things
[49:12] which are ahead. what that's talking
[49:14] about again your vision. Don't look in
[49:16] the rearview mirror.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Look forward. Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; I press toward [clears throat] the goal
[49:22] of for the prize of the upward call of
[49:24] God in Christ Jesus.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, let us as many as are
[49:31] mature. Amen. Not as many who are babes
[49:33] in Christ,
[49:34] &gt;&gt; but as many who are mature,
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; have the [clears throat] mind. And if
[49:40] anything you think otherwise, God will
[49:42] reveal this to you. Nevertheless, to the
[49:44] degree that we have already attained,
[49:46] let us walk. Amen.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. In first Corinthians, Paul says,
[49:52] "Do you not know that those who run a
[49:54] race all run, but one receives the
[49:56] prize?
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Run in such a way that you may obtain
[49:59] it, and everyone who competes for the
[50:02] prize is tempered in all things." Now
[50:05] they do it to obtain a perishable crown.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[50:08] &gt;&gt; but weep for an imperishable crown.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Therefore I run. Thus not with
[50:13] uncertainty.
[50:14] Thus I fight not as one who beats the
[50:17] air, but I discipline my body and bring
[50:20] it into subjection. Lest when I have
[50:22] preached to others, I myself should not
[50:24] become disqualified.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is Paul saying here? Paul
[50:28] is likening in the kingdom of God here
[50:30] to kind of let's put it a sports
[50:33] analogy.
[50:34] Amen. If you look at sports and how
[50:36] these athletes operate, Amen. They are
[50:39] not running aimlessly.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a prize to obtain. They
[50:43] are running to win.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is their livelihood. Amen.
[50:47] And they are running to win. And in
[50:49] order to do that, they bring their body
[50:51] in such um a strict regimen. Amen. They
[50:55] subject their body to such harsh
[50:57] circumstances just to condition
[50:59] themselves, Amen. to be able to run the
[51:01] race.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll find that they'll wake
[51:03] up at early parts of the morning and
[51:05] start their run or they'll do these ice
[51:08] bucket challenges where they'll immerse
[51:10] their whole bodies into ice. Why do they
[51:12] do the these things? They conditioning
[51:15] their body to survive. Amen. The
[51:17] conditions of the race
[51:19] &gt;&gt; and the harsh elements of the race.
[51:21] Amen. You'll find even these with these
[51:22] guys running the marathons. Amen. It's
[51:25] not an easy thing. Amen. For example,
[51:26] they're running from Derban to Peter
[51:28] Marsburg. Amen. We can't run from here
[51:30] to the gate. Amen.
[51:33] So how are they able to do this? They
[51:35] have to condition their body.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; If they don't do that, they will faint.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; So they have to condition their body.
[51:43] Now the gospel, Paul is likening the
[51:46] gospel to this.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you don't condition
[51:49] yourself spiritually speaking, you are
[51:51] not going to last in this race.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; And that's the honest truth.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you think you're just going to
[51:57] get by laxidasical, that's not going to
[51:59] work.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul is saying even myself as a
[52:02] preacher. Now here's the messenger.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the greatest apostles, he
[52:06] wrote majority of the New Testament. He
[52:09] saw the third heavens.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; He said, I saw things there that are not
[52:12] even lawful to speak.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And here he comes now and he says, I
[52:19] myself have to bring my body under
[52:20] subjection so I am not disqualified
[52:22] after having preached the gospel.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Now if Paul this great apostle have to
[52:27] do that, how much more us?
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to bring oursel under
[52:30] subjection to the word, to the will of
[52:32] God. Amen. We got to subject ourselves
[52:34] to prayer and fasting and reading the
[52:36] word. Amen. These are things that are
[52:38] going to condition us for the race.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember, God has not left
[52:42] us without the right elements, amen, to
[52:46] obtain the prize. He's given us the
[52:48] message of the hour. He's given us the
[52:50] right spiritual diet. Amen. He's given
[52:52] us the right vitamins, amen, that we
[52:54] need.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; But we've got to take it in.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to condition ourselves. Amen.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:04] Amen. And we are not running aimlessly.
[53:07] Amen. We are running because we we know
[53:09] we are going to obtain the prize. Amen.
[53:11] We know we are going to obtain the body
[53:13] change. Amen. We know there's this
[53:15] promise of eternal life.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that we are coming back to
[53:19] what Adam lost.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we are not running aimlessly.
[53:23] Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:28] Amen. Hallelujah. And you'll find that
[53:30] even Amen. farmers when with their
[53:34] horses, Amen. they would put blinders on
[53:36] the hors's eyes. And the reason for this
[53:39] is that it is to prevent distraction of
[53:42] the horses so that they could run
[53:43] straight in a straight line. So they
[53:45] would put blinders on the sides of the
[53:47] horse's eyes. So when the horse is
[53:49] running, the horse could only look
[53:50] straight ahead. Amen. So in other words,
[53:53] the horse had narrow vision. He had
[53:54] tunnel vision. Amen. And that is what
[53:57] amen the word is trying to do week and
[54:00] week out. It's trying to blind us with
[54:02] the things of the world. It opened our
[54:03] eyes to the things of God and veils us
[54:06] to the things of the world. Amen. It's a
[54:08] protective veil. Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; You find even athletes in the Olympics
[54:13] and so forth. Amen. They don't look at
[54:15] the sideways when they are running. They
[54:17] have to keep looking forward when they
[54:19] are running. Amen. They are keeping
[54:21] their vision. Amen. [clears throat]
[54:22] Amen. Last scripture that we're going to
[54:23] read. Amen. Colossians chapter 3,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; he says,
[54:30] "Even then you were raised with Christ.
[54:33] Seek those things which are above, where
[54:35] Christ is sitting at the right hand of
[54:37] God. Set your mind on things above, not
[54:40] on things on the earth."
[54:43] &gt;&gt; For you died and your life is hidden
[54:45] with Christ.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are you are no
[54:48] longer living your own life. Amen. The
[54:50] life of Christ is living through you.
[54:52] When Christ who is our life appears then
[54:56] you will appear with him in glory.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So we see amen. The
[55:01] positive side of tunnel vision. Amen. We
[55:04] got to have a focused vision on Christ.
[55:06] Amen. We got to know what we are running
[55:08] for in this hour.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Now you see in the message of the hour,
[55:13] we've [clears throat] come through all
[55:14] of these years. Amen. And many people
[55:17] along the way have got distracted by
[55:19] many distractions.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. They'll
[55:24] join one camp and get focused on one set
[55:26] of doctrine,
[55:27] &gt;&gt; perhaps the thunders. Then they'll
[55:29] they'll have another camp and they'll
[55:30] focus maybe just on the seven virtues.
[55:33] Then they'll have another camp that will
[55:36] focus on saying that the rapture has
[55:37] already taken place and we are living in
[55:39] the millennium. All kinds of different
[55:41] distractions,
[55:42] &gt;&gt; but they have tunnel vision to what the
[55:45] broader context of the message came to
[55:47] do.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] And so the message tonight is to say do
[55:51] not miss the broader picture of what God
[55:54] is trying to do.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And you will find that throughout the
[55:58] years, amen,
[56:00] we've learned many things and God was
[56:02] taking us through foundational phases.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; God, remember God is building a building
[56:07] here.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's had to lay the foundation
[56:10] because remember what the canker worm
[56:13] and the caterpillar and so forth eaten
[56:14] of God had to restore.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were not starting off a church
[56:18] like it was in the book of acts when
[56:20] Paul had laid the foundation because
[56:22] throughout the dark ages that foundation
[56:25] was lost
[56:27] &gt;&gt; right so here comes the prophet of the
[56:29] age now he's setting correct now all
[56:32] these different doctrines and even
[56:34] doctrines that Luther had brought the
[56:38] doctrine of justification
[56:39] &gt;&gt; and Wesley had brought the doctrine of
[56:41] sanctification even they did not bring
[56:44] it to its full capacity [clears throat]
[56:46] the prophet in this hour has revealed
[56:48] true justification has revealed true
[56:50] sanctification. Amen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's taken all these years,
[56:54] amen, for this foundation to be built
[56:56] up.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now in this age now of
[57:00] adoption when God is placing us.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Now we can see the broader context of
[57:05] what God was trying to do. He might have
[57:07] looked back
[57:12] with dresses, long dresses and they
[57:15] don't watch TV or they don't do this. It
[57:17] looked like that. Amen. But now when we
[57:19] come through all the years and we are
[57:21] now coming to maturity, we can see the
[57:24] broader picture.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can see that God has taken us
[57:27] back. Amen. To the garden of Eden. Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Adamic conditions again. Amen. The
[57:31] manifestation of sons in this hour.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is why my subject for
[57:37] tonight is perfecting our vision in the
[57:40] age of adoption.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you'll find here the the
[57:44] prophet said when the Holy Ghost fell
[57:46] upon the Pentecostal people, they began
[57:49] to restore back the gifts and things
[57:51] that was in the church. They thought
[57:53] because they were born of the spirit
[57:55] that settled it. Now here is where we
[57:57] got to pay attention. Amen. Because many
[58:00] people think if you're just born of the
[58:01] spirit that's enough. But you see there
[58:04] is a placing of a son and after the son
[58:07] proved to be a real son then he was
[58:09] taken into the public place. Amen. We
[58:11] know this. We've been through this. And
[58:13] then was set up and changed robes and
[58:16] set up there and they were placed in the
[58:18] sun.
[58:19] Amen. God did the same thing by his son
[58:22] on Mount Transfiguration. He was
[58:24] overshadowed by a cloud and was
[58:26] transfigured and his rayment shined like
[58:28] the sun. And the voice said, "This is my
[58:31] beloved son in whom I am well pleased."
[58:34] Amen. You see, in this age now, when the
[58:36] bride comes, amen, to full adoption, God
[58:38] can say, "Behold my beloved sons and
[58:40] daughters." Amen. In whom I am well
[58:42] pleased to dwell in.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And remember, she is the final
[58:46] voice to the final age. So God can say,
[58:48] "Yeah, he her." Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "This is my beloved
[58:54] son in whom I'm I'm well pleased." Moses
[58:57] and the law had failed and this is him.
[59:01] Yay him.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was placed. And the prophet
[59:05] says, "But people today are somewhat
[59:06] like Peter and them was on the mount
[59:09] transfiguration." They got all enthused
[59:12] [clears throat]
[59:12] &gt;&gt; when they seen the supernatural done.
[59:14] Amen. Like a lot of message people when
[59:16] they hear all these supernatural
[59:18] testimonies from William Brandon's
[59:19] ministry, they get all enthused.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they say, "We'll make one
[59:23] church of prophets, one to Moses." Amen.
[59:26] like the Pentecostals did, we'll make
[59:28] one assembly of God, one church of God,
[59:30] one oneness, and so forth. But while he
[59:32] was yet speaking, Jehovah cried out,
[59:34] this is my beloved son.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, while Amen, we could
[59:39] see all these supernatural things that
[59:41] God was doing in the life of the
[59:42] prophet. Amen. People began to get
[59:44] enthused. Amen. People begin to start
[59:46] all kinds of sex and they get stuck in
[59:48] that. Amen. But while all of that is
[59:51] happening, God's word is speaking. Amen.
[59:54] God is saying they can see a man William
[59:56] Bron. Amen. The son of man is speaking.
[59:58] Amen. Amen. The true messenger of the
[1:00:00] age which is Christ in the hour. He's
[1:00:03] speaking. Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says here him.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by a man. Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because William Brandon's hobby is
[1:00:12] to hunt. Now you want to start hunting.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by the man.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because William Brandon wore that
[1:00:18] kind of a hat. Now you want to wear that
[1:00:19] kind of a hat.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by the man.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. In fact, you can disagree with
[1:00:24] William Brand about many of his personal
[1:00:26] opinions if you want.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those were his personal opinions.
[1:00:29] He might have liked the color red. You
[1:00:31] might like the color blue.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; But Amen. The messenger of the hour
[1:00:34] which is Christ was veiled in that in
[1:00:37] that man. Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; And when he spoke the word of God, that
[1:00:40] is the message of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is why God could say yeah
[1:00:46] him.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. That is why our
[1:00:49] example is Christ. Our example is never
[1:00:52] a man.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Neither is our example the family of the
[1:00:56] man.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's one mistake people make a
[1:00:59] lot of the time.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. [snorts] Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; They'll see pictures maybe of the
[1:01:03] prophet's wife and they say, "No, the
[1:01:05] prophet's wife had a skirt here so we
[1:01:07] can wear a skirt to this level."
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; That's not the word of God.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet's wife is not the
[1:01:12] example of the word of God.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. They'll say the
[1:01:16] prophet's daughter had a fringe here and
[1:01:17] trimmed her hair here. But then the
[1:01:19] prophet comes and corrects that and he
[1:01:21] says, "I didn't tell her to do that. She
[1:01:22] as a teenager went and cut it on her
[1:01:24] own."
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; But you can take that out of context and
[1:01:27] say, "No, look, the prophet's daughter
[1:01:28] did it, so we can do that, too."
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; You see, they are not the examples of
[1:01:32] the word.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Because if you take that, then you're
[1:01:35] going to have to now follow the follow
[1:01:38] the tape ministry.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. And you're going to have to now sit
[1:01:40] at home and press play
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; because a family of the prophet is
[1:01:44] saying that's what you need to do
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; and not go to church. You see the word
[1:01:48] of God is our example.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Now, here's what she was talking about,
[1:01:54] brother Luke. The prophet says, "I got a
[1:01:56] camera up here coming down. I didn't
[1:01:59] know how to take a picture. I looked
[1:02:02] through the thing and man, I could see
[1:02:03] five or six different objects. So, I
[1:02:06] began to focus it."
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he began to focus the camera.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; And when he focused it, it all came to
[1:02:12] one picture.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; And that is why when you look at the
[1:02:16] message, you've got to have the right
[1:02:18] focus. Amen. Otherwise, you're going to
[1:02:20] see a whole lot of different things.
[1:02:21] Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying one thing in this
[1:02:24] code, he's saying one thing in this
[1:02:25] code. But if you don't focus it right,
[1:02:27] Amen. You're not going to get the clear
[1:02:29] picture.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God gives us the Bible.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible is the word. The word is God.
[1:02:36] So that is our binoculars.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is our binoculars.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; In other words, everything that you look
[1:02:43] at, you look at through the word of God.
[1:02:45] That's our glasses.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; When we go to looking in the Bible and
[1:02:50] seeing four or five different ways, it
[1:02:52] needs focusing.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; We got to bring it the thing into place
[1:02:56] where we see the one solemn purpose of
[1:02:58] God.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. That's what I'm trying
[1:03:01] to trying to portray to you tonight is
[1:03:04] to focus our vision on the one solemn
[1:03:07] purpose of God.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We still coming to the second
[1:03:11] part. Amen. After we narrow our focus,
[1:03:13] what is the time and season? Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Because you got to have a narrow focus
[1:03:17] on the word of God and you've got to be
[1:03:18] in the right time and season.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, what is what is the
[1:03:25] purpose of God? What is the one solemn
[1:03:27] purpose of God? Amen. Now we know
[1:03:29] Genesis is the seed chapter.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; So if you want to know what's the
[1:03:33] purpose of God, surely God would have
[1:03:35] put it in the beginning of the Bible.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; There's many things we can focus on many
[1:03:42] doctrines like dressing and baptism
[1:03:43] [clears throat] and all of these things.
[1:03:45] Amen. But what is the purpose of God?
[1:03:48] And we're going to address Genesis, but
[1:03:49] we're not going to read it from the just
[1:03:52] the scripture. We're going to read it
[1:03:53] from pick up your pen and write. Amen.
[1:03:55] Because we know pick up your pen and
[1:03:56] write is the letter to the bride. Amen.
[1:03:58] a letter to the church and God is
[1:04:00] revealing secrets to the bride in this
[1:04:02] letter. Amen.
[1:04:04] The prophet says here, here is what I'm
[1:04:06] trying to say to you. The law of
[1:04:09] reproduction. Look at how he starts now.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; The law of reproduction, that's how he
[1:04:14] starts off his letter. And what does
[1:04:16] Genesis start off with? The same thing.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Is each species brings forth after its
[1:04:22] own kind.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:25] Even according to Genesis 1:11. And God
[1:04:28] said, "Let the earth bring forth grass
[1:04:30] and herb yielding seed, and the fruit
[1:04:32] tree yielding fruit after its kind,
[1:04:35] whose seed is in itself upon the earth."
[1:04:38] Amen. So here the prophet is
[1:04:41] automatically taking you to Genesis and
[1:04:43] saying if you want to look at what the
[1:04:45] purpose of God is, you got to look at
[1:04:46] Genesis.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember spoken word is the
[1:04:49] original seed.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God had seeds that he had
[1:04:54] planted.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; And God's original purpose that every
[1:04:58] seed that he planted must bring forth
[1:05:01] after its own kind.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; So now when we narrow the focus now of
[1:05:06] the whole message, we are narrowed down
[1:05:08] to what is God's whole purpose. God's
[1:05:11] seed must bring forth after its own
[1:05:13] kind.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; So what are all of these additional
[1:05:16] doctrines? Baptism and so forth. Those
[1:05:18] are to guide you on your journey to
[1:05:21] coming up to that stage where you can
[1:05:23] bring forth after your own kind.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's giving you the spiritual
[1:05:27] nutrients that you need. It's giving you
[1:05:28] the watering that you need. It's giving
[1:05:30] you the sunlight that you need so that
[1:05:32] that the seed within you can produce
[1:05:35] after its own kind.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; The very same law applies to the church
[1:05:42] today. Whatever seed started the church
[1:05:45] will come forth and be like the original
[1:05:48] seed because because it's the seed. It's
[1:05:51] the same seed. In these last days, the
[1:05:54] true bride, Christ seed will come to the
[1:05:57] headstone. And we know this code. Amen.
[1:05:59] She'll be a super church, a super race
[1:06:01] as she nears him. Why? Because it's
[1:06:05] already laying within the seed. Amen.
[1:06:07] Not because he's going to make you a
[1:06:08] super church. Not because he's going to
[1:06:10] make you an invincible army. The
[1:06:12] potentials are laying within you.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all God is doing is just
[1:06:16] watching the seed
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; as you are laying in the presence of the
[1:06:19] sunlight. Amen. God is watching the sea
[1:06:21] and it's growing and growing and
[1:06:22] growing.
[1:06:25] Amen.
[1:06:27] They will be the very manifestation of
[1:06:29] the word of the living God.
[1:06:30] Denominations cannot produce this. Why?
[1:06:33] Because it's wrong seed. They will
[1:06:35] produce their creeds and their dogmas
[1:06:38] mixed with the word. Now let me ask you
[1:06:40] this question. If we can see the fruits
[1:06:43] of the denomination,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; we can see that it's wrong seed. Why?
[1:06:47] Because we can see the fruits.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; So if the denomination can display the
[1:06:51] fruits of the wrong seed, then surely we
[1:06:54] can see the fruits of the true seed in
[1:06:56] this hour.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Because we know that if there's a bogus
[1:06:59] dollar, there has to be a genuine
[1:07:00] dollar.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if the false seed, the seed of
[1:07:03] discrepancy is displaying its fruit in
[1:07:06] this hour. Amen. The true seed of God is
[1:07:08] also displaying the fruit in this hour.
[1:07:11] Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the word of promise came to
[1:07:14] the Virgin Mary, but the word of promise
[1:07:17] was he himself to be made manifest.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; See, it looks like this message came to
[1:07:22] Mary, but what was the message? It was
[1:07:25] the word himself to be made flesh.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; It was to unveil himself.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And notice that when the angel
[1:07:33] gave the message to Mary and Mary said,
[1:07:35] "Be it unto me according to thy word."
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Mary did not do anything else. to
[1:07:40] produce that seed within her.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost overshadowed her. Amen.
[1:07:44] So when you receive the angel's message,
[1:07:47] now remember the angel is the messenger
[1:07:49] to the age. Amen.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet might have left the
[1:07:51] scene, but the angel is still here.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; And when when you receive the message of
[1:07:56] the angel,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. that will produce in itself. Amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; What it's supposed to produce.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Now Mary did have to face the child
[1:08:05] bearing herself. She had to face the
[1:08:07] trials, the pains, the birth pains
[1:08:08] herself. Amen. And that's what the
[1:08:10] church has to face. You have to face the
[1:08:12] birth pains. You have to face the
[1:08:13] trials. You have to face walking around
[1:08:15] for 9 months. Amen. With a heavy tongue.
[1:08:18] Amen. You've got to go through all of
[1:08:20] that. But you do not have to produce the
[1:08:21] life.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; God produces the life. Amen. Why?
[1:08:25] Because it's very is his own life. Amen.
[1:08:27] Produced in you.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride has the mind of Christ.
[1:08:34] For she know what he wants done with the
[1:08:36] word.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride has perfect focus. Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; She performs the command of the word.
[1:08:42] She has thus said the Lord.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is quickened by the
[1:08:46] spirit and it comes to pass.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Like a seed that is planted and watered.
[1:08:51] Like we said, we the seed now we are
[1:08:53] laying every week being watered in the
[1:08:56] presence of the sunlight. We are being
[1:08:57] watered.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; It comes to full harvest serving its
[1:09:01] purpose.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every seed that God has
[1:09:05] planted must come to full harvest. Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you didn't plant the seed. God
[1:09:10] planted the seed. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice how God now, now we're
[1:09:17] going to move in time and season. Amen.
[1:09:19] Notice how God did not move Israel or
[1:09:22] let her go into the promised land until
[1:09:24] it was his own appointed time.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the people might have put
[1:09:30] pressure on Joshua, the leader, and
[1:09:32] said, "The land is ours." That's true.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; The land is theirs. Let's go and take
[1:09:38] it. It was prophesied.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Joshua, you are all through.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You might have lost your commission. You
[1:09:45] don't have the power you used to have.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; You used to hear from God and know the
[1:09:49] will of God and act quickly.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was one time, Amen, when you
[1:09:54] needed to act quickly and you ask the
[1:09:56] son to stand still and he obeyed you.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; So why the people wants [clears throat]
[1:10:00] to know why we're not moving anymore?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Joshua was a God-sin prophet
[1:10:06] and he knew the promises of God.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; So he waited for them.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; He was patient.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; He waited for a clearcut decision from
[1:10:15] God. And when the time came to move, God
[1:10:18] placed the full leadership in Joshua's
[1:10:20] hands because he was he had stayed with
[1:10:22] the word.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; So you see, yes, we have all these
[1:10:26] promises. The bride is a super race,
[1:10:29] super church.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are sons and daughters to
[1:10:32] manifest the word in this hour. Yes,
[1:10:34] we've known that for years and years. In
[1:10:36] fact, we've preached adoption for years
[1:10:38] and years.
[1:10:40] Amen. But it was not time and season as
[1:10:43] yet.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a time and season for
[1:10:46] everything.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now we see we are coming to
[1:10:50] time and season. Amen. For the sons and
[1:10:52] daughters of God to be manifested. Amen.
[1:10:54] The age of adoption.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; The prophecies and people tried to do it
[1:11:01] within themselves.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; This is why they got stuck in so many
[1:11:04] different camps throughout the years.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; They knew that there was all this
[1:11:08] potential
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; in [clears throat] the message.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; The bride is a super church. They knew
[1:11:13] all of this potential,
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; but they could not wait for time and
[1:11:17] season.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; So what did they do? They ventured
[1:11:20] without authority.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; They presumed that this was it. They
[1:11:25] presumed that when they had Amen. their
[1:11:27] version of what the thunders were that
[1:11:29] that was it.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. They could not wait for time and
[1:11:33] season.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Moses, we look at Moses.
[1:11:39] Amen. Moses, Amen, knew, the prophet
[1:11:42] says Moses knew that he was the
[1:11:43] messenger of that age.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible might not directly say it, but
[1:11:47] the prophet revealing it to us is that
[1:11:49] Moses knew he was the appointed
[1:11:51] messenger of the age.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; He knew that God called him.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Moses knowing that now tried
[1:11:58] to do it in his own strength. He
[1:12:00] thought, "Here am I. I've got enough
[1:12:02] strength now. I'm young. I've got all of
[1:12:03] this might and all of this military
[1:12:05] training and all of this." And he tried
[1:12:07] to do it in his own strength.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; He had the correct word. God was going
[1:12:11] to deliver them. God was going to send
[1:12:12] him a deliverer. He had the correct
[1:12:14] word, but not time and season.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there come an hour. Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet says when it was time and
[1:12:22] season, Moses had to meet the burning
[1:12:24] bush. Yeah.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says, that's
[1:12:27] what's the problem with the church
[1:12:29] today. They have not met the burning
[1:12:31] bush.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. They have not come to time and
[1:12:34] season. Amen. Where they've had an
[1:12:36] encounter with [clears throat] God.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; They've heard. Yes. All of these
[1:12:39] promises. The children of Israel knew
[1:12:41] all of these promises. It was prophesied
[1:12:43] from the days of Abraham. Your seed is
[1:12:46] going to so journey in a strange land
[1:12:48] and I'm going to deliver them. They've
[1:12:49] had all these promises,
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; but they did not have the burning bush
[1:12:53] experience.
[1:12:55] Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's see what the prophet
[1:12:59] says is the burning bush experience.
[1:13:03] He says, "Then when God revealed himself
[1:13:06] to him in the burning bush, he found out
[1:13:09] then that the very thing that was in the
[1:13:11] burning bush was the thing that he
[1:13:13] lacked." So prophet, what was in what
[1:13:16] was in the burning bush? Do we have to
[1:13:18] see a physical pillar of fire? Do we
[1:13:20] have to see the supernatural with our
[1:13:22] very eyes? What is the burning bush
[1:13:24] experience? The prophet says, and I
[1:13:26] think that's a whole lot of us today,
[1:13:28] that many times we try to do the program
[1:13:31] ourselves and fail to get what is in the
[1:13:33] burning bush, which is the direct
[1:13:36] revelation of the will and time of God.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you have a direct
[1:13:43] revelation of the will and the time of
[1:13:45] God, you have come into contact with the
[1:13:47] burning bush. You have come into contact
[1:13:48] with the pillar of fire because remember
[1:13:51] who is the pillar of fire? It's Christ
[1:13:52] the messenger
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; and the messenger is leading us and and
[1:13:56] the messenger is going to lead us with
[1:13:57] amen the word of God and the time and
[1:14:00] season of God.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know Amen. the famous saying
[1:14:03] amen the famous scripture to everything
[1:14:06] under the sun there's a time and season.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So just like that in
[1:14:11] God's promises there's time and season.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; God has times and seasons for his word.
[1:14:18] Amen. And the presence of the Lord was
[1:14:21] there to heal the sick. So the prophet
[1:14:23] is given an example. Now he'll say and
[1:14:25] the scripture says at certain times the
[1:14:27] presence of the Lord was there to heal
[1:14:29] the sick. That's when Jesus was
[1:14:32] ministering too. At the presence of the
[1:14:34] Lord was there to heal the sick. Maybe
[1:14:36] at other times the presence of the Lord
[1:14:38] was not there to heal the sick.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; So Amen. There's even a time and season
[1:14:42] for healing. You might be praying for so
[1:14:44] many years for your healing. But don't
[1:14:46] lose hope. You got to wait for time and
[1:14:48] season.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet prayed and prayed for
[1:14:51] years and years until he received his
[1:14:53] healing. Many other people received the
[1:14:55] healing through his own ministry.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; But he himself had to wait for years and
[1:14:59] years until he received his own healing.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't be despondent. Amen. When
[1:15:04] the promises of God take time.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because it's the word of God.
[1:15:09] It must come to pass.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; It's a seed. It must come to pass. It
[1:15:13] must bring forth a harvest. The harvest
[1:15:16] doesn't come forth at the same time that
[1:15:17] the seed is planted.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to go through a time and
[1:15:21] season.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that is why tonight we
[1:15:24] are speaking on perfecting and narrowing
[1:15:27] our vision in time and season. Amen. In
[1:15:29] the age of adoption.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] Now you'll find that
[1:15:38] for many years, amen, in the message we,
[1:15:41] amen, preached on different things, but
[1:15:44] you will find that nothing was really
[1:15:46] emphasized on times and seasons.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; They've had the word. Amen. They've
[1:15:50] broken down the word. Amen. What the
[1:15:52] word is, what the revelation of the word
[1:15:54] is, and given us a good foundation, a
[1:15:56] good understanding of what the word is.
[1:15:59] Amen. But you'll find, amen, even in our
[1:16:01] local assembly, amen, that from 2023, a
[1:16:05] certain emphasis started being placed on
[1:16:07] time and season.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll find that before that we
[1:16:11] were we were never that focused on time
[1:16:13] and season. We are focused on what the
[1:16:14] word is, what the seven seals are, what
[1:16:16] the seven church ages are. Amen. What
[1:16:19] the serpent seed is, all these things
[1:16:21] that we had to learn. Amen. That is the
[1:16:23] word and the will of God. But you'll
[1:16:25] find now that we come a time where God
[1:16:27] is emphasizing time and season.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Everything that we've learned,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; everything that has been planted, it's
[1:16:33] now coming time and season for the
[1:16:35] harvest. Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; That is why is the theme of this year?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; The theme for our church this year,
[1:16:41] amen, is the opening of dimensional
[1:16:43] doors.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; What is that talking about? Time and
[1:16:45] season.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Time and season that God has opened up
[1:16:48] certain doors to us. certain
[1:16:50] manifestations, certain blessings,
[1:16:52] certain anointings, certain levels of
[1:16:54] the Holy Spirit in time and season.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we now know the will of
[1:16:59] God. We know the word. Remember the
[1:17:01] bride has thus say the Lord, she has the
[1:17:03] mind of Christ. She knows what he wants
[1:17:05] done with the word.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; But now she has [clears throat] time and
[1:17:08] season. Amen. Time and season of
[1:17:10] adoption being placed in this hour. Sons
[1:17:12] and daughters of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:15] In the hour of resurrection, like
[1:17:17] Martha, in the hour of resurrection, the
[1:17:19] bride has been placed.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. No other time. Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; But when the life of Christ is ready to
[1:17:26] be manifested, she's placed in this
[1:17:29] hour.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I pray you've been blessed
[1:17:31] through that tonight. Amen. That's
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; the main emphasis of the message. Amen.
[1:17:35] God is narrowing our focus, perfecting
[1:17:37] our focus in time and season of the
[1:17:39] bride age. Amen. In the age of adoption.
[1:17:42] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's stand to our
[1:17:44] feet. Amen. Hallelujah. God is good.
[1:17:46] [applause]
[1:17:47] Amen. Hallelujah. We have the word of
[1:17:49] God. We have the word of God. We have
[1:17:51] time and season. Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; This is the age of adoption. Don't mess
[1:17:55] it. Amen.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; This is not the age, Amen. to be a baby
[1:17:58] in Christ.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not the age. Amen. To want
[1:18:02] milk of the word.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are now mature sons and
[1:18:05] daughters of God.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam was coming into a full
[1:18:10] stature of the word.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus as he has grown up from
[1:18:15] an infant was growing up into the full
[1:18:16] stature of the word. And we too, Amen.
[1:18:19] receiving the word all through the
[1:18:21] years. We are now grown up into the full
[1:18:23] stature of the word. Now it's time to
[1:18:25] manifest. Amen. Time and season to
[1:18:28] manifest. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, we pray narrow our vision. Oh
[1:18:32] God,
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; let us not be distracted. Oh God,
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; let us see what you are trying to do in
[1:18:37] this hour.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us not be like father what the
[1:18:41] prophet said people are always looking
[1:18:43] at the past.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; They are always looking at the future
[1:18:46] what you're going to do but missing what
[1:18:48] you're doing now.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Lord let us see the whole picture. Oh
[1:18:51] God.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Oh let us not have oh lord.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord the picture wrong father.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; We want to have the picture right.
[1:18:59] Father.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Oh we want to be focused oh God.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And father we want to walk in time and
[1:19:04] season. Oh God.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us. Like your prophet said so
[1:19:08] many times,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Noah's message would not have walked in
[1:19:11] Moses day,
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Moses could not go down the Nile River
[1:19:15] with the ark to deliver the people of
[1:19:17] Israel.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like that, we've got our
[1:19:21] message for this hour time and season.
[1:19:24] Amen. Let's stay focused on what you're
[1:19:26] trying to reveal to us, oh God.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, we pray, Lord, just perfect our
[1:19:30] vision.

[1:19:33] to him tonight? Amen. Say, "Lord,
[1:19:35] perfect my vision, Father. Oh, take away
[1:19:38] every distraction, oh God. Perfect our
[1:19:40] vision, oh God. Oh, let us walk in time
[1:19:43] and season, oh God. Oh, we bless your
[1:19:46] name, oh God. We thank you, oh God, that
[1:19:48] what you're doing in this hour, oh God.
[1:19:51] Father, you are showing to us, oh God,
[1:19:52] what you are doing, Lord. You've not
[1:19:54] left us in the dark."
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, Father, like you said to Can I
[1:19:59] hide from Abraham? What am I going to
[1:20:01] do? Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you have not hid from your
[1:20:03] elect what you're doing in this hour.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you Lord.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, let us not miss it, Lord.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; In this hour, Lord, let us lay in the
[1:20:12] presence of the sun. Oh God, let us
[1:20:15] bring forth, oh God, the fruit of the
[1:20:17] hour, Lord. Oh God, that every hour Lord
[1:20:20] had different fruit to present, Lord,
[1:20:22] God. And in this hour, Lord, we are
[1:20:24] presenting the fruit of maturity, oh
[1:20:26] God. The fruit of maturity of your word,
[1:20:29] father, the perfect understanding of
[1:20:31] your word, the perfect realization of
[1:20:33] your word, the perfect manifestation of
[1:20:36] your word. Oh Lord, it's a mature word.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you Lord in this hour.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are not just, oh Lord, Father,
[1:20:44] phased now by winds of doctrines. Lord,
[1:20:46] we are not just phased by, oh Lord, just
[1:20:48] the laying hands of the sick, oh God, or
[1:20:50] speaking in tongues or any of these
[1:20:53] things, but we are now coming to the
[1:20:55] full maturity of the word. Oh God, thank
[1:20:57] you, oh God, for sending a prophet.
[1:20:59] Thank you for sending a messenger in
[1:21:01] this hour. Thank you for coming down
[1:21:03] yourself, oh God.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, all of heaven stood silent, oh
[1:21:07] God, because there was silence in
[1:21:09] heaven, oh God, when the mighty angel
[1:21:11] descended in this hour, oh God. Oh, we
[1:21:13] thank you, Jesus. Blessed be your holy
[1:21:16] name. Amen. Hallelujah. You are worthy.
[1:21:19] You are worthy of all praise.
[1:21:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to call our pastor a
[1:21:25] forward. Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He's worthy of all
[1:21:28] praise. Worthy of all glory.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing. Amen. Even
[1:21:33] as we call our pastor Aan forward. I
[1:21:35] want God's way to be my way.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:21:41] I want God's [singing]
[1:21:43] way
[1:21:45] to be my way
[1:21:49] as I journey [singing]
[1:21:57] [singing]
[1:22:03] [singing]
[1:22:06] a child
[1:22:08] of watching you go.
[1:22:12] Though the road [singing]
[1:22:15] seems deep
[1:22:17] and rough,
[1:22:20] if he leads [singing] me then
[1:22:27] I go
[1:22:30] to my
[1:22:34] every day. [singing]

[1:22:49] of our faith.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you feel you're
[1:22:52] growing into maturity?
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord is positioning you,
[1:22:56] placing you into your position where
[1:22:59] Amen. He's able to walk through you.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we must be able to feel that
[1:23:03] way
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; because when we were new babes in
[1:23:05] Christ, we knew that we were new babes.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are hungered after the the milk
[1:23:11] and we hungered after those things.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; But as we start to mature, we we ought
[1:23:15] to notice signs of maturity.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And where God is taking us.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we appreciate the word of the
[1:23:21] Lord, brother Jeff.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a tremendous blessing to be
[1:23:24] in the service tonight. Can I pray?
[1:23:26] Amen. We'll go and ponder upon these
[1:23:27] things because the Lord is certainly
[1:23:29] doing a work in and through our lives.
[1:23:32] Amen. Let's continue to sing and worship
[1:23:33] him and
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; give him glory and praise. Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; There many needs, many prayer requests,
[1:23:38] but we can come before the Lord to
[1:23:40] believe. Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Church, we've got to take our position.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we realize who we are, we
[1:23:48] speak with the voice of authority.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; We speak Amen. Because the authority
[1:23:53] came from our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; He came to position us and place us so
[1:23:58] we can't be speaking from a point of
[1:23:59] weakness, from a point of strength.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I can just imagine
[1:24:04] that eagle in the chicken.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had limited vision.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; He had limited line of sight,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; but once he left that chicken
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; and he got up into the heavenlies,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; he had a panoramic view. [clears throat]
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He could see the
[1:24:22] entire picture.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. He was soaring into
[1:24:25] heavenly places.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And there's no way you could convince
[1:24:28] that eagle to go back to that bar.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank [clears throat] you, Lord.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had been set free. Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] And he whom the son have set free is
[1:24:36] free indeed.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give God glory and praise.
[1:24:40] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he worthy of praise?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He's taking us,
[1:24:49] leading us to greater heights.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing and worship him. Thank
