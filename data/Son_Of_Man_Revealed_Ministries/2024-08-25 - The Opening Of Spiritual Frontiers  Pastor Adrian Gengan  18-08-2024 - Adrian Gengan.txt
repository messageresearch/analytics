want you to Repose the church that we've already been teaching you how to handle these thingsall when you get a doctor's report and we can't go fearful and we can't weary and we can't go down and be depressed amen so we are not just preaching sermons but it's here to equip the body of Christ how to handle these situations when you're fighting these things amen so we are praying for a good report amen and I know that the Lord will have his way amen hallelujah how many of you are praying for our sister amen pray for one another it's very important amen hallelujah and then this morning you know 12 years ago uh I'm trying to find the right words hey I got married so we want to thank the Lord for amen the 12 years of Grace upon our marriage see my wife ran away because she knew I'm going to talk about her amen so 12 years of Grace upon our marriage and we know that and 12 speaks about foundations amen so I think the foundations are being built now amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we thank the Lord amen for his grace Upon Our Lives amen even giving us three children amen I thank the Lord amen for Karen because she's very supportive in the ministry also playing music amen and taking care of that and we know music is a Ministry on its own she also sings to the Lord that's a Ministry amen but she's also very supportive in the ministry amen doesn't stifle me as a minister amen doesn't put unnecessary pressure on me but I I'm able to do what I'm supposed to do in the ministry amen hallelujah and you know you find a good wife if you can trust her with your mother and father amen hallelujah so she's also very uh thoughtful and taken care when if I'm not around amen she's able to do things amen hallelujah so you ought to love one another like that amen so I want to thank the Lord for that and we give God praise amen I love her very much and she knows it amen hallelujah so we pray that the Lord will continue to bless this Union amen because we need strong marriages on the earth now amen amen while marriages are tearing apart are being torn apart amen we need strong marriage on the earth to match God's word amen according to God's pattern amen so we praise the Lord for that amen so I pray amen that you'll be blessed this morning as well we speak this morning amen I want to speak a bit on uh the opening up of spiritual Frontiers we started this on wedes day and if you were not here on wedness day amen I'm not sure if the message has been loaded yet but if you haven't you should listen to that amen we were speaking on the opening of of spiritual Frontiers and we took J's prayer and now we ask the Lord to enlarge his territory amen so this morning we want to speak on the opening up of spiritual Frontiers and look how the seven seal Frontier opened up to us to connect us with the real us amen this is the frontier that's been opened up to us and now because that Revelation is so strong the gates of hell can't stand against this Revelation I can make you believe something about somebody else and Satan won't be bothered yes that's right but when the frontier is opened up to you and I'll make you realize who you are Satan is powerless because sons and daughters are rising up in their position hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so we'll turn to our Bible amen this morning let's turn to Revelation amen before we go to Revelation let's turn to Genesis 1 praise the Lord get to the beginning there Genesis chapter 1 you should know this thing off our heart now amen praise the Lord and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them then we'll go to Genesis ch 3 amen so that's a man that God created to have dominion Genesis chapter 2 we know God puts that man in a flesh body and he puts him in a garden to work and then he gives him a wife Genesis chter 3 now the serpent comes in and he deceives the woman amen so we want to read maybe the end portion of Genesis 3 and see here from maybe verse vers uh 21 unto Adam also and his wife did the Lord make coats of skin and clothing now why I'm reading that watch it's all to do with a covering first one was Spirit man second in chapter two he puts him in a flesh body three now instead of him going into a perfect body he's now got a body of skin a clothing a covering of skin animal skin so he says let us make coats of skin and clothe them and the Lord God said behold a man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever we know brother Brandon tells us that tree of life is Jesus Christ amen can you say Amen to that amen so you see if man had eaten in that condition he would have had eternal life in a fallen condition but now watch he's going to do something therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life amen so there now we know his title deed is taken away then we go to Revelation chapter 5 amen you can be seated we'll read it as we continue I don't want to keep you standing praise the Lord Revelation 5 now this is the title deed inheritance that got taken away from Adam now we are thrown into the scene where where this book comes back into view amen and we see here that a strong Angel is proclaiming from verse two who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on now we know brother Bram tells us this book is a titled Deeds of man's inheritance just pay attention to that amen and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book to read the book neither to look there on what a book this must be and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lon of the tribe of Judah the root of David that prevailed to open the book and loose the seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and in the midst of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven arms and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Ops and golden vials full of odors which are the praise of the Saints and they sung a new song saying thou worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and has made us unto our God priest Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth amen praise the Lord so the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word amen so is everybody relaxed I don't want you to be tense in his presence amen we are living in a very late hour a very serious hour amen you'll find as the word of God is being preached people taking offense to the word of God people don't want us to preach the true revelation of the word yes people want us to compromise with the word amen but our goal as a five-fold Ministry is to preach a word that will change your bodies amen amen hallelujah amen so our word is like we were speaking on on wedness day maybe just to overlap into today's service we were talking about when NE is saying enlarge my territory enlarge my border have a concern for our own lives Hallelujah don't just be satisfied with the status quo Hallelujah with what we have right now yes amen no matter how I we get into the spiritual Realms there's Al always greater Realms that we can go to amen so always ask the Lord enlarge my territory amen amen if you got faith say Lord enlarge my faith maybe you got a bit of Revelation say Lord enlarge my Revelation enlarge my position in the body of Christ amen so we've got to enlarge our image which is the image of God Amen which is a character and a good moral character take it from that now to the character of Christ enlarge me from Human Nature to Divine Nature amen enlarge me from the image of Adam to the image of Jesus Christ amen amen then we find as we are building ourselves now we've got to enlarge ourselves yes we've got to grow up in Christ amen amen like Peter describing enlarge your border from Faith to Virtue from virtue to knowledge from knowledge to Temperance from Temperance to patience from patience to Godliness from godliness to brotherly kindness and from go brotherly kindness to charity we've got to enlarge ourselves in this area amen you've got to enlarge yourself from this ibrd Fallen body to a redeemed body to a glorified body amen so how do we do that how do I connect amen that's the job of a fold Ministry and my job is your pastor as a minister he take you from the realm of the five senses yes is to pull you into the realm of the six sense thank you amen pull you out of the five senses pull you into the realm of perfect faith that is Heavenly places Amen to tell you more about yourself more than what you know you say oh but brother you don't know you don't spend time with me I know more about you than you know about yourself because I'm tapping into spiritual laws I'm tapping into amen discernment and I'm tapping into the spirit of God Amen thank you Lord yes Lord in fact brother brandom says you only need five minutes to spend with somebody that's right to tell what kind of character they are what kind of nature they are amen what kind of spirit they are amen so you can't fool a a fivefold minister Hallelujah because he's got the spirit of discernment amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we go beyond the realm of science science specializes in the realm of the flesh amen but there's more to you than the human body amen we have a spirit we have a soul and inside of that soul is a predestinated seed Gene of God can somebody identify with that yes Lord so we want to unlock the Unseen World yes that's what the seven seal came to do unlock the UN seen world to us unlock and break through spiritual amen Frontiers for us I tell you other people read Revelation 5 they don't know its meaning people read Revelation 8 verse1 they don't know the meaning I'm going to say it now they don't know that the prophet of God says that the silence in Revelation 81 the setting of it is found in Revelation 10 amen but nobody knows it except the ones that have come under the prophetic voice of the hour hallelujah thank you Lord amen so we want to make you see yourself as you were known in the back part of God's mind to show you great and marvelous things about ourselves amen thank you Lord now rapturing Faith ought to be growing inside of us we ought to be walking in the spirit and not after the flesh yes Lord thank we ought to be walking so much in the Supernatural that the supernatural don't surprise us hallelujah amen hallelujah our original nature was a supernatural nature we fell from that Adam was living in a world of Supernatural Faith amen we can't be babies now yes Hallelujah you know the guy the the prophet talks about this boy who goes and he looks in the mirror but you you notice he says the boy yeah that's right how can you have a grown man in the message que saying mama that's me mama that's me hello amen come on now calls him a boy after recognized himself he grew up to be a manall you can't keep saying oh Ruth that's me oh Esther that's me if they were typing you how about you be the reality of it amen hallelujah if if Ruth was resting if Ruth was at the threshing floor if Ruth was waiting for boas to Redeemer you are the reality of it don't just get stuck in types don't just get stuck in stories amen hallelujah you are the reality your you are the climax of all redemption's plan hallelujah praise the Lord so the supernatural can't surprise us amen we can't be surprised hey I prayed for this they got healed hey how can you be surprised you're a Son of God In fact when you pray you ought to believe they are already healed already delivered already set free when you speak a word son and daughter of God you don't speak Idle Words yeah your word carries life when you speak over a situation that situation has got to change you've got to believe the words coming out of your mouth amen stop being backslid come on have faith in your own word stop thinking things are not working out for me speak and go forward footsteps means possession speak and go forward Hall amen move by faith and allow the angel Army to work yes amen amen if if Daniel didn't ask Lord show me the interpretation of this dream the angel Army wouldn't have been in activation amen if Joshua didn't March and move forward to go into Jericho the captain of the host wouldn't have revealed himself to him as long as he stayed still as long as he stayed saying oh well we don't need to move now we're just waiting we waiting we waiting what are you waiting for amen God has given his word amen amen I say move ahead amen Hallelujah I was talking Wednesday telling you about Benjamin Netanyahu and how he comes there and he always tells them Israel as a rights to defend the borders yes and spiritual Israel has a right to defend the borders am amen the borders of the message of the hour the borders of our faith amen hallelujah yes Lord amen there's another thing they're asking for right now while the world is going crazy they are asking for a ceased fire amen they we want to ISE fire amen the the Philistines are upon them the Palestinians are upon them but now they are hunting them down now if if natural Israel is hunting down these these terrorists we are hunting spiritual terrorists people have come to terrorize you demon powers have come to terrorize you we are hunting them down oh yes Lord amen and I've come to declare as the captain this morning there will be no ceasefire be no ceas fire we will annihilate and destroy the enemy until every demon is put under our feet oh thank you Lord praise the Lord amen now we walking in perfect Faith amen we are sons who are coming into adoption the guide the teacher the spirit of Truth is here for our adoption ceremony now don't be like Peter at Jesus adoption ceremony he did not know how to cope with the supernatural amen he wanted to make three Tabernacles amen one for thee one for Moses one for Elijah we can't be confused about the supernatural amen you called to fight amen you are called to overcome you are called to advance the kingdom amen so when Adam when when Adam's Body now when he fell it became a hybrid body amen and brother brandom says that God hates hybrid religion he hates anything that can't reproduce itself amen hallelujah God could no longer live in that body because that body could not express deity somebody say Amen the flesh body brother Bram goes on to say that his channels of Faith got clogged yes he became unconscious of the fact of who he was because it was a hybrid body Now by The Sweat of his brow he had to go to work yes amen yes and time the pressure has he got more children the pressure came on and his channels of Faith got clogged hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so we see here that the flesh body was corrupted So Adam lost the title deed the title deed to man's inheritance and his original Spirit left him the guy left him the spirit of Truth left him amen amen he lost the title deed to eternal life somebody say eternal life eternal life fellowship with God fellowship with God and power over the earth power over the Earth those are the three things that Adam lost but I'm going to jump ahead and tell you because of what Jesus Christ done amen he came to redeem man back to eternal life so if you believe on him like John 3:16 Says you shall have eternal life amen he came to restore Fellowship back with man through the shed Blood on the cross amen and power over the Earth is coming now to sons and Daughters of God who are being manifested according to Romans 8 amen now that the mysteries of the seventh seal are open they now can go and take possession of that scripture and become the manifested Sons and Daughters of God amen amen now we were saying that we know the seven seal scroll in Revelation 5 is the title deed to men's inheritance amen but in Revelation 5 we find it sealed how how did it get sealed amen we know Adam lost it but how did it get sealed so when man fell and was driven from the Garden of Eden God placed a seal over the title deed amen you want to put it up again you can read it Genesis 3:22 amen amen you are seeing how the book is being sealed now because it's there in a picture form don't misunderstand what God is doing he's Sealing the book when he's putting an angel you go to the maybe 24 when he's putting an angel to guide the way back he's sealing the book amen amen he's sealing the book to man's inheritance and who is he putting there he's putting an angel I'd say he's putting a mighty Angel Hallelujah I'd say one that can handle the Flaming sword amen he's putting an angel to seal that book amen hallelujah so is it anyone in Revelation 5 there's a strong Angel saying who is worthy to take this book and I'm seal the book amen praise the Lord amen amen so I man was separated by the seals can we say that yes the way back to the Tree of Life Angel was there the way from John going and taking the book what Was separating him the seals the seals was stopping John from taking back the book amen everybody agree amen so therefore we can say this that there can be no uniting without the breaking of the Seven Seals I'm trying to show you the importance of the Seven Seals this morning amen people wondering why the seals I'm here to declare the Seven Seals are for the sons of God the Seven Seals that come to unlock your amen your original position hallelujah amen don't let the Seven Seals be mysterious to you the Seven Seals are for Sons and Daughters of God thank amen so we have to see like brother Bram was say in that second seal Lord let them see their name beneath the seal so we have to see beneath the Seven Seals to see what we are uniting with because you can't take what you can't see the bride is not blind the bride is not like leans come on say Amen the bride is not blind amen our eyes of understanding has been opened to us unto us it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom amen amen so the gift of the Ephesian 4 minister is to raise you up so you can see beneath the seal oh yes you can see beyond the seal amen the message is about you Beyond Time amen hallelujah that is why the message of the hour reveals to you when you are in the back part of God's mind Before Time began and he also is taking into the future realm to show you out of time that you are Eternal being somebody say amen amen yes Lord amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we stand here this morning the Seven Seals have been broken by Christ through the prophetic gift and the fivefold ministry he here to release your inheritance that was locked under the seventh seal amen and your inheritance is the Holy Ghost yes if you don't get anything else in life get the Holy Ghost it's all you'll need in this life it's all you'll need out of this life hallelujah amen now where do we carry God's glory if if the flesh flesh realm is not redeemed yet where do we carry his glory God's glory we carry it with us in our spirit realm amen now we know the soul is the nature of the spirit Hallelujah so if you got a filthy Spirit we know the nature of your soul but if you've got a Godly spirit Spirit we know the nature of your soul amen amen praise the Lord so we carry the glory of God in our spirit realm when God gives Spirit Glory the glory of the spirit is seen in a body except that spirit is reflected in a body you can't see the glory of God yes right yes yes sir so I'm going to say the amount of Glory that you carry in the in your spirit determines your rank in the spirit amen people don't like to hear this but there's Rank and file in the kingdom of God they even put brother brandom elevated him and he asked but why did you put me here he says on Earth you are a prophet you given a special reward that's right amen hallelujah amen amen you don't like to hear it but it's true am therefore you can't recognize Authority in the kingdom of God that's right Amen in fact the Demonic World recognizes Authority more than some Christians do help us Lord hallelujah so the more your body is glorified the more ranking you have the more Glory you carry in your spirit thank you Lord you see some men so anointed so gifted they can walk up to a case Hallelujah they carry the glory of God one word and a demon leaves that body yes Lord amen amen amen carrying the glory of the spirit am amen that can take the word and go into the depths of the word and bring out Revelation am Amen to slay the enemy amen yes Lord that's rank in the spirit realm oh thank you a normal ly M don't have that same gifting Hallelujah and the prophet of God says not everyone carries the same anointing right Hallelujah but that's why we need the body together that's why we need the entire body functioning together but each one is operating under the different gifting each one is operating under different anointing amen before I go on I want to tell you something about this the this Chinese ticket the prophet of God tells us that in the old days before they had numbering system and the modern systems of today the Chinese came and set up their laundromats there and because they didn't want to confuse the laundry they would take a piece of paper and they would tear the piece of paper they would give you one off and they will keep one off they'll keep it with the clothing so when you come to redeem your clothing that two P pieces of got to match Hallelujah the tear has got to match that's how they knew it was your laundry right so there are two pieces hallelujah amen so pay attention to that I'll hit the lights highlight on that later amen praise the Lord so we want to see what ranking We Carry in the spirit realm hey amen amen and this is where amen we are to really labor amen because there can be no ranking in the spirit realm without a consecrated life without a spiritful life oh you say oh no don't worry brother as soon as I finish school I'll find time you are lying you say oh no if I can only leave school if I can only leave College if I can only leave work I'll find more time you are lying amen amen or if you don't like that word you're speaking a mistruth praise the Lord because you will make the time if it was important to you yes amen oh no brother you know school work keeps me down and I can't get to do this you know my uh studies are getting me down I don't have much time you know my work is so busy no sons of of God who are operating in the spirit of God will sacrifice brother Brandon was also working he was a game warden he was collecting this electricity things connecting and cutting of people's electricity but how did what level did it operate hello Amen in fact Paul is telling Timothy to stir up the gift don't turn it down Hallelujah he said hey stir up the gift yes what's wrong with [Music] you am amen no but we we are so we are better than we're more anointed amen but in fact in reality if we are to put a measuring on your spirit realm and the glory you carry that thing won't even glow you know y they'll say next please next please now you can't fake this Hallelujah either lights up or not we are not talking natural things here amen natural things you can fake spiritual things you can't fake hallelujah amen therefore when somebody is sick somebody needs help somebody in trouble you better connect with a man of God amen amen you better connect with a man of God a man who's walking in the spirit who's not walking after the flesh don't care what the report is but is looking to the Unseen hallelujah what am I trying to tell you you better be finding a man who is connected with the angel of God Amen now you get some people in not might be saying you know get caral in the service oh BR you saying you connected with the angel of God well show me your connection with the angel of God hallelujah then we can have this conversation show me your connection with the angel of God you see why the denominational world is successful they're able to tap into the anointing of the man of God the prophet of God says you either believe your pastor or you don't believe him he says if you don't have faith in him he says you rather go find somebody else you can have confidence in amen praise the Lord amen so we are looking now to see that Lord we want to ascend the glory realm yes who can Ascend the hill of the Lord he that has Clean Hands and a pure heart amen so I'm going to ask you in a very basic way not to amen condemn you but to do spiritual Diagnostics very quickly how much time do you spend in prayer how much time do you read your Bible how much time do you fast how much time do you spend in his presence how much your longone time you got that will determine your right in the spirit amen no actually I meant to do that but there was a 2-hour Netflix movie satisfying the flesh I meant to do that but something else you you may be saying oh but why why must I do this yes you are not a natural being on the earth you and I are supernatural beings on the earth am hallelujah amen amen thank you Lord I ask you right now to just switch up the gear because right now when we're talking about levels in the spirit DM I can see his people and I'm not talking seeing you with my eyes I'm not looking at all of you I'm Looking Through The Eyes of the spirit right now and I can see some just sinking low they feel like they can't come up to this realm but you know what that is it's a spirit hanging over you listen to what I said it's not a spirit that possess you right it's a spirit hanging over you that telling you you can't reach this realm amen amen praise the Lord so we want to see how our spirit stands in God by the glory which this body carries God did not give us amen did not just give us a Celestial body God gave you a body that he himself dwells in God sent a prophet to reveal that body to us now you young people and those of you that never read it you all go and read the rejected King it's the first time the prophet is relating now why why would this be interesting to you let me tell you why science is probing for life outside of Earth that's right and they have not found it here is a documented reality the first time that a man left the Earth and went to another dimension amen and came back to tell us about it other mens have left this Dimension and went there like Enoch Elijah the first one that came back to give us an accurate account so you read the rejected King it's the first time he describes it then he further on he'll go and he'll preach beyond the curtain of time if you want to read about a man's experience of seeing the Unseen World amen how many will commit you'll commit to reading it commit commit amen no amen we'll commit raise your hands amen you know where to find it amen amen amen Google it the rejected King William brandham uh beyond the curtain of time William brandham you'll find it I know you like to search so for the next week stop searching for profiles and online search the message of the hour read about this other realm this world you know you'll be one of the few people that actually know about that world cuz the others reject Hallelujah so God gave adam a body that didn't carry much glory amen what you have now is ibr I'm talking about after the fall you have a body now that depletes in glory you'll find as we grow older the beauty of young men is in their youth the Bible says amen but as you get old Your Glory depletes we live now in a body whose Glory di diminishes every day every day the glory of this flesh is depart but yet in our spirit we are renewed daily the Bible says amen we were once I'm saying we once a handsome young man now watch as you get old Your Glory depletes so we live in a body that's going old the outward man perishes at a certain age you can't even sustain healing anymore you know that yeah your body your organs just shut down what is that Ecclesiastes 3 every everything there's a time and season a time to be born a time to die so yes we can pray for you you can be healed but once we come to that point where it's your time we can't pray that away to everything there's a season the prophet of God says if you're here if you alive you are here to fulfill God's purpose when your purpose is finished God will take you away amen so remember that so one day don't come now and you're dying breath and say you failed no it's your time to go you know when we're praying for you don't say ah Pastor see now I'm going no it's your time to go don't worry don't be scared to go there's a body waiting for you you won't float around like a ghost you can enter a more glorious body praise the Lord amen so what we are saying is this seven seal opened up this realm to us and if we if we must have continuity if we must have eternal life then the word of God must provide a body because no matter how sincere you are in your spirit and in your soul that attribute inside of your soul can't find expression in this ibrid body you what I'm saying that's right the C Gene of God within you can only find certain amount of expression through this body that's why it's longing for another body so we can have it full expression amen because in this body even though now you're filled with the glory of God even though now you're filled with the Holy Ghost you can't walk through a wall hello you need a glorified body for the attribute to have full expression yes amen So Adam had the Book of Life in his hand and God told Adam to multiply and replenish the Earth but the Bible says Adam was naked and he was not yet glorified because because he bypassed his theop body yes Adam had to grow in the likeness of God to a place of glorification the seed jeene the Son of God because brother Bram says Adam was a seed Son of God and any seed is not in its mature form meaning that Adam being a seed Son of God had to grow up Hallelujah even Jesus he says was a seed Son of God but Jesus grew in stature in the sight of God and Men the Bible says praise the Lord amen so the book of life was not supposed to come through a flesh body we ordained to come from a Theon body that is what we were ordained to do but but now you came your your seed Gene came through a flesh body it was not meant to be like that Adam could not bring the names in the book by the spoken word except to be be clothed with a glorified body amen so we find the sons of God in the book which to come by Spoken Word so you would have been a glorified son yes but what happened is had the been no fall God wouldn't have been able to express his attributes but God wanted the fall because it's more glorious when you come to glory after the fall amen when God can take you and redeem you and and make you a son and daughter of God it is more glorious to God Amen think of it the other way brother Bram says he won't push you through a pipe and take you to the other side and say Well done my son you made it so it is more glorious to God to make you to redeem you after the fall praise the Lord now we know that Eve couldn't wait for the promise there was an official season that was coming upon them where Adam could have had the spoken word and he could have called the names in the book Adam had the mind of Christ so he could have called the names in the book but Eve his bride couldn't wait for Adam to grow up into that realm amen So Adam went to Redeemer and he fell and when he fell he was clothed with different skins now he came with animal skins so we know that our first revelation of what kind of body was what kind of body Adam had we know we've been through that he could speak he could speak the first body that he had amen now you and I even though like we were saying wedes day we are Body Spirit and soul right so we have a a flesh body a redeemed body we have a theop body and we have a glorified body praise the Lord not three different bodies but three dimensions of the same body am thank you Lord praise the Lord amen now you are sitting here but there's another version of you yes yes sir yes every one of you sitting here there's another version of you yes amen praise the Lord amen another body that you have not yet seen because it's hidden under the seventh seal amen hallelujah praise the Lord put Matthew 18:10 there brother Bram broke the seal so you can have a view and see the rest of your Dimensions amen so you are a dimensional being yes oh yes you are sitting here in a flesh body amen but there's another part of you in that sixth dimension here they coming to for the children and our Lord is telling them take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels oh yes now if you go and search that out in the message the prophet is saying they Celestial body they theop body do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven so yeah were the children literally on Earth but Jesus is saying that they Angels do always behold the face of my father they have another body amen hallelujah amen I thought that would excite you amen amen and and the Apostle Paul also says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we already have one waiting yes right amen so you're sitting here but there's another part of you in another dimension another body that you have not seen But brother Brandon broke the seal so you can view the rest of your dimensions and when you live those Dimensions you really know that you are just like Abraham his body changed God did not give Abraham another body right oh yes Hallelujah he had the same body but he changed back to a young man amen that means Abraham connected to the other dimension of his body that was always there that means Enoch connected with another dimension of his body body that was always there am Hallelujah am amen that means brother Brandon when he's transitioning and he's leaving the body he said I was here in the stopy body but I looked back and I saw the other part the other dimension of me I saw myself lying on the bed yes hello yes there is another dimension of you Amen brother brandom says that you are connected with your theophany when you hear the message of the hour you are hearing from theophany yes that's why we sing that song Can't You Hear Your theophany calling you amen you see while I'm preaching now there's a gene of God either telling you I have representation in what you are saying praise the lord we have a promise that we shall be changed amen tell somebody we shall be changed tell your neighbor we shall be changed we shall be changed amen the Bible says in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed am thank you Lord so what does Malachi 4's message come to do he came here to reveal our pedigree yes hallelujah amen You Can't Hide pedigree in You Can't Hide seed hallelujah thank you revealing your breed amen hallelujah he was showing you your records from the genealogy of God the genealogy of God brother Brandon was calling your names he was calling the names in the book Amen to show you where you came from lord your journey on Earth and where you're going to amen the part that we see is just a small part we got 7080 years and we Rejoice around that but there's eternity that awaits Us Praise the Lord there's a larger part held in eternity right now a theop body in fact if your theop body was here right now all doubt all Fe all reasoning you'll be back in your original condition again thank you Lord until you connect with that body you can't be changed yes changing is not bringing something new changing means you're becoming something else right amen hallelujah you are now baptized with your original Spirit can I see those that are baptized with the Holy Spirit but the Holy Ghost is taking you back to your original condition your Original Seed your original word your original to be conditioned amen amen original like your father you're becoming like your father now very quickly in Revelation chapter 5 John brother Grom says was raised up to see another John yes and we showed you in the scripture how those Elders John was one of those Elders yes right the John was raised up and John saw another version of himself yes amen you saying where you getting this from Seven seal Frontiers have been opened up Frontiers have been opened up to us you may be thinking what are you doing right now I am obliterating Satan's kingdom by positioning you into see has you were know amen I am bringing Revelation to you because there's no prevailing power is the power of Revelation yes yes praise the Lord amen what am I doing I'm giving you muscles to flex so when Satan comes to you can tell him do you know who I am I don't only have representation on the Earth right now I have representation in heaven in fact Satan you are kicked out of heaven amen GL thank you Lord so John is raised up to see another version of John brother Bram is raised up to see another version of himself Hallelujah but the John the same John that's looking there's a dividing line what is that dividing line the seals the seals are dividing him from John yes amen amen that's right so before 63 you were divided from knowing who you really are oh yes Lord amen praise the Lord separated by the seals but just beyond the seals he saw the other part of John am he wants to connect with John but but he can't because there's no one worthy to break the seals now notice he didn't call that part by another name he didn't call that Joseph he didn't call that part Moses but he said John saw John am amen same John but in two Dimensions maybe you thinking this is two outet this sounds like Star Wars yes Amen in fact you know they they uh copy these things in the movies yeah what they call it multi-dimensional galaxies that's right Two Worlds or whatever yeah different galaxies or in the same same person in different I I can't remember the name now amen so John is trapped in time and he can't get over to the other John because the real John the Holy Ghost John the theophany John is separated by the seals amen so the lamb has to break the seals and the breaking of the seals amen you know brother brandom says there's a breach between the church ages and the Seven Seals yes yes that's right now you can stand on the bridge in fact the Seven Seals creates a bridge come on the Seven Seals creates a bridge so you can connect with the other part of you amen your theophonic part your original part amen praise the Lord tell somebody I am original amen amen amen hallelujah brother like original parts amen praise the lord we don't like hybrid Parts some people like fake Parts some people like pirate Parts you can't put a pirate part in the body of Christ amen amen now you know when a when a hbd mule dies that mule cannot breed itself to its original breed it's original pedigree amen so your breed is the is your pure state in the word of God yes your breed amen hallelujah amen can reproduce itself amen Faith than you so how do I get back the answer is in the seals it's over there I can see it but how do you bring it back John is crying how do I bring it back how do I connect with to John how do you bring it back because sin had separated me God Made A Way and he saw himself but he couldn't bring himself back he saw himself and he says oh mama that's me thank amen praise the Lord you see John recognizing himself he's like that eagle and he says mama that's me I'm driving a point here now to close so how do I bring it back how do I connect with that body so that I can reign as a king and priest on the earth come back to my original image amen man can't get to the other side but the theophany body could not come here as well God had to make a way through the cross and through the opening of The Seven Seals so the Seven Seals now becomes the bridge that for over 60 years the seals are open and there is a passage way thank you I'm telling you we are moving thank you Lord I'm telling you that the church has not been stagnant I'm telling you that we have been on the passage the Seven Seals have been leading us to our Eternal Body yes amen because the other part of you amen was hidden away from you but God took you through the prophetic eye the eye of William Brandon and he raised you to a level to see another spiritual froner open up a dimensional door so you can see past the curtain of time and see the real you yes Lord amen how names were hidden under the seventh seal we were separated but in 1963 God gave brother Bram the authority uity to reveal those seals amen the one that the lamb revealed in simple form is now given the authority to reveal it in Revelation form to reveal the other part of you what am I saying amen there is one part of the Chinese ticket here but the other part of the Chinese ticket is on the other side and when you can put those two together you shall get a glorified body somebody give God praise amen amen yes Lord thank you one part of the Chinese ticket is here where's the other part I want to go back to the other part why when you connect the two it's not just connecting tickets Hallelujah when you connect the two you get the laundry you get your [Music] inheritance hallelujah amen yes Lord thank you so we are coming now the message came to connect the Chinese ticker together the message came Amen to connect us back to original inheritance your original Spirit your original image your original dided the Seven Seals was the door amen that was open and now the door of the Seven Seals is opened up that's our spiritual Frontier the borders have been enlarged amen Satan can't shut the door neither can Satan seal it again it's been unsealed amen hallelujah the seals are broken meaning there's no more separation meaning that if this was 1963 we are here now in 2024 maybe you're thinking that we are just in the same position as brother Bram left we are not yes there's been a passage way and we've been moving through the passage way amen ready now moving amen past the shout hallelujah because there's three things for the Rapture amen the shout is only to gather the living Saints but you can't be gathered under the amen just a message Hallelujah a gathering is to take you to another place that's right hallelujah amen hallelujah amen you've got to come under the voice of the Archangel you've got to connect with the Angelic message come on now you've got to connect with the Angelic amen we have connected with the Angelic message the voice of the Archangel and we are now waiting for it to turn to the voice of the Resurrection that's right amen hallelujah amen you need all three things to have a body change you need a shout you need the voice and you need the Trump of God Amen thank you Lord so as we are moving this passage way we are almost at the end of the passage oh yes which means the voice of the Resurrection is fixing to sound oh yes which means the six Dimension sa are preparing to leave that place oh can somebody agree with that your body is fixing to leave that place don't tell me amen you're Bor in a message amen move through the passage way amen move this spiritual Frontier being opened up to you amen it may be a narrow way but that's the spiritual it's a narrow Frontier amen we are taking Enemy Lines we are going Beyond Enemy Lines we are breaking every unbelief we are breaking every doubt we are breaking every fear fear are not to reside in Sons and Daughters of God we are to be men of Faith Women of Faith amen hallelujah thank you Jesus praise the Lord I tell you again what's The Company You Keep Spirit jump on you you men you watch who your wives be around amen amen you watch what company they keep amen you're the head of your home you're the garden of your home you're the Gate of your home you watch what they bring into the home you watch what Spirits they carry if they are spending time with unbelievers stop that relationship Hallelujah come on nowen amen amen praise the Lord amen we are ready for a blast off what do you want to be left behind amen amen do you want to be left behind at this late hour now is not the time now is the time telling you get up even if you're shot get up oh yes we'll carry if we need to but let's get moving amen let's get moving for Christ amen yes Lord amen no more bridge but a bridge no more bridge but a bridge a breach is a Chasm that you can't get over to the other side you remember the man in Lazarus the rich man there was a Chasm he couldn't get to the other side but the seven seal oh the seven seal is the bridge Hallelujah you've seen you've been to these great Canyons you've been here maybe South Coast wherever you know they got a bridge that bridge is not one two steps Hallelujah and because of the height we soaring in the heavenlies because of the he you even move slowly sometimes you're scared a bit but you're not turning back brother Brandon says you come to a point where you've reached a point of no return meaning it's easier for you to cross over than to go back huj hallelujah it's easier for to cross over now praise the Lord no more bridge but the seventh seal is the bridge I'm walking Amen to take me from Mortal to immortality from this P house to my father's house from corruption to incorruption yes Lord spiritual Frontiers have been opened up amen there's no more border I can see myself in the word no more separation no more Mysteries Church there's no more Mysteries it's all been revealed to us the entire Plan of Redemption is revealed to me we can now connect with the high dimension of the Holy Ghost we can now connect and know who we really are spiritual Frontiers have been opened up to Sons and Daughters of God Amen to cross over the land and live in the land of the Holy Ghost live in the land of your inheritance so for 60 years we've been saying John saw John amen and rejoicing around their truth 60 years you've been saying I've been hearing my name amen but this year I say this year I want to connect with who I really am not John seeing John but John becoming John amen how if you can testify to that I want to become what I am on the other side I want to become a fully manifested son amen yes Lord not just John seeing John John seeing John is a boy oh yes but John amen John becoming John is a man hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord so why have the Seven Seals been broken if it were not broken there's no way back to our the body amen there's no way your theophany body can come here you will be kept separated amen you will be ibr and you'll die that's right amen right now some of you can feel the presence of your ey Dimension the presence of your theophany the Holy Ghost Dimension so take your your mind take off your mind and say that I'm just a man take up your mind to say I'm full of faults and failures look through the word amen you are perfected in Christ yes the reason why you look at yourself as a a failure is because you are not in Christ you're not looking at yourself Through The Eyes of Christ once you are in Christ we look at you through Christ l amen so you're redeemed like amen by Christ you're perfect like Christ amen the breaking of the seventh seal amen the real person on the other side the breaking of the seventh seal is the opening of spiritual Frontiers amen is not just a message the opening up of spiritual Frontiers is not a message but it's Zoe life the Breath of God coming back to breathe life to the names that are in the book amen Zoe life is is coming now amen Zoe life is coming now to breathe life to the names that are in the book amen thank you [Music]

Seals gave us the bridge yes you know when when they invaded that beach at Normandy yes it gave them an access to enter and Conquer The Seven Seals gave us at access spiritual Frontiers were opened up amen you what the prophet of God says so can we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world all our Associates Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all the dead religions I'm speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds and to what separated us and opened to us a new land Hallelujah a new message for this day what is that spiritual Frontiers it says Pentecost red up and died yes like Lou the Wesley and rest of them it's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together good people in there has got to come out what did he do he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message you notice that the seven SE Seals All The Mysteries of the seven Church Ages were sealed with Seven Seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their days they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the Seven Seals it's opened to us in this last days from a prophecy that went forth in Arizona thank you Lord spiritual Frontiers Hallelujah have been opened up to us hallelujah amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord so the point of this morning's message is for you to hear from your theophany yes and hear it crying out to you we're almost at the end of the passage way you know you must have seen this uh comic strip it's a picture this man is digging he is digging there's two men digging on either side and they show you like an x-ray vision what's behind what he's digging so this one man has got like a mount like behind that one more wack there's like diamonds yellow and on this side this man whacked and he found one Diamond so this man gets jealous and he wants to go all the way back sure and he kills his man for the one Diamond but that picture is showing you that if you only took one more knock he would have crossed over to the other side amen remember brother bram's mountain range yeah he says just one more step to the other side so I'm saying we've come down the passage way now all things are not continuing the same we are not the same as the message was in 65 yes amen hallelujah we have come through the passage way amen come through time almost at the end now to step off time and go into eternity amen we can't turn back now amen we have reached the point of no return Yes am could it be one more whack Hallelujah till we get our inheritance right why are we going to turn back you know
