Hallelujah father we come before your most holy presence oh God yes we know father that you dwell in the Praises of your people and even as the songs of Zion have gone up to you Lord we know father your word says that you enhabit the Praises and I pray Lord that you would come down father and consume the sacrifice of praise Lord amen lord it's done out of a Pure Heart Lord out of a Heart of Love For You Lord Jesus we have gathered here because Lord we come under the submission of your word oh God I pray tonight Lord that you will speak to us through your precious word and father I pray that you'll bless each and everyone that is coming into the house of the Lord I pray you meet us at the point of our need oh God and I pray oh God that you would minister to our hearts and build up our

Lord Jesus I pray every son and daughter of god father will be able to submit to your will and your plan at this time oh God we commit all things into your hands Lord even the ones that haven't come Lord I pray Lord father that your minister to their hearts oh Lord Jesus I pray Lord the great holy spirit will go forth oh God and be the discerner of their hearts Lord Jesus I commit the service into your hands over everything that will be said and done in the mighty name of Jesus we ask these blessings amen oh thank you Jesus amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen Our God who is worthy of praise yes amen amen hallelujah amen so there's so much we can talk about amen but when we talk about him he's the all consuming one amen he fills us up so let's just get to the word of God we'll read our scripture you can have your seats let's go to Ephesians chap 5:25 it's maybe too loud for me I start screaming you amen Ephesians 5:25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church now he's going to go into why Christ loved the church even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it amen amen so Christ's love was a sacrificial love yes that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word amen so remember the holy ghost at this time being poured out is by the word to receive the word for your age amen the prophet says that's your identification that you have the Seal of God which is the Holy Ghost amen so he's sending the word to sanctify and cleanse it to this bride why he wants to present that he might present it to himself a glorious church amen not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen the L A blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated let's go to the book of St [Music] [Music] John St John chapter 14 Hallelujah we read from verse 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also amen amen and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father amen what a promise amen now that are to fill every son and daughter of God with an expectation because if we reading the Bible and we are seeing the mighty works that Jesus Christ had done if we reading with just a denominational mind or just a natural conception you can Marvel at the mighty works that Jesus did but here Jesus is turning it back around to us and saying you are going to do Greater Works amen amen amen because I'm going to my father praise the Lord now one would think that's impossible to do but then if Jesus says something he's going to back it up amen amen amen he's going to equip his church if he's going to have a glorious Church he's got to give her the material to equip her and make her into this amen now we can't leave scriptures unfulfilled the prophet of God in telling us this is's telling us that when Jesus Christ came he was the manifestation of God in flesh and all that was in God he poured into Christ yes and all that was in Christ he now is poured into his church amen amen hallelujah so there's got to be he left us with an expectation amen Jesus Christ left us with an expectation amen now if Jesus Christ healed the sick heal the blind the mute the deaf the crippled the expectation that he leaves with us is that you're going to do Greater Works than these amen amen yes hallelujah thank you Lord now the prophet of God is telling us that Jesus Christ won't leave if doesn't do the same things that he's doing back in the Bible days here again then he's not fully manifesting his word he says if there is no manifestation because remember everything you hear Jesus say we must say amen amen that's right because Jesus came to show us the Adam man so when Jesus is telling them if you don't believe me my message I'm preaching now we have a message as John the bride if you don't believe me believe the works that I do amen amen so we we can't be that group of people who are saying only believe what we are professing right we can speak the same words of Jesus and say if you don't believe the words that I saying believe me for the very Works amen for I am come out of Jesus Jesus said he was come out of the father but the bride can now say for I am come out of the sight of Jesus as a manifestation amen praise the Lord so amen just to give it a title amen because these things go on YouTube God's glorious holy ghost fill church amen that's what he's looking for a glorious holy ghost fill church now sometimes the main thing we leave out looking for other promises but yet it's so simple and it's in the main thing amen now if God is going to equip a church he's going to send the Holy Ghost to equip the church right amen so we we're looking around now and we can see that world events are transpiring at a rapid rate amen just today or yesterday maybe you know that the prime minister of Israel he dismissed or he fired the defense minister amen and upon reading further into it amen the defense minister was the one who is in charge of the military tactics of the country yes and he is concerned Amen to protect Israel he is their main Defender right so the Prime Minister didn't want to agree to certain things that this Minister was doing and one of the things was he didn't this Minister of Defense wants all to enlist in the Army all illegible yes whether you're Orthodox or not now remember we got Orthodox message people too we got Orthodox and we got the regular ones right now I think it's significant he said everyone must enlist if you're elgible to enlist in the Army Israel is at War we need you to come into the army and every we been preaching that everyone must come into the army of Jesus Christ we can't have people living civilian lives and the others are in the army of Christ all must come in and net doesn't want to agree to that and he's defending the Orthodox Jews and he doesn't want them to enlist so that became a contention the other contention is he's saying you destroyed Gaz and there's no longer to keep fighting in G move to the sides of the [Music] north he says take out your your greatest enemy first which is esbah rather than focusing on a mass which is like a finished organization right now amen now watch strategically in the natural how it's happening and watch because we know that the that the attack upon the bride is coming from the sides of the north he wants to sit upon the Mount of the congregation on the sides of the north so here he is trying to to give advice but they see it as a conflict and he says we can't see eye to eye I'm going to dismiss you amen so don't be dismissive of the Holy Spirit when he's bringing in a work amen if he is telling you get your greatest enemy first amen hallelujah the prophet of God yeah in the message believest thou this he says it's the Jews time right it's the Jews time right at hand now and the Gentiles are ending out because they just went on out they rejecting Christ they're rejecting their signs they're rejecting everything that's called Godly and branded as some kind of telepathy or devil power they're blaspheming the Holy Ghost and sealing themselves away from God and God will take that Minority after a while and will raise it up into a powerful church amen and then turn the spirit to the Jews now we can't say that God has stopped working with the church right because we've seen a powerful Prophet I don't if you can say we've seen a powerful Prophet but have we really seen that powerful church amen now remember he says Christ in the true church will will be a continuation of the book of Acts but a continuation doesn't mean a mimic yes it means it will continue meaning it will progress amen yes because the greater the Revelation the greater the Power released to the church amen praise the Lord so our expectation is higher amen so he says he going to take this minority group and raise it into a powerful church and then turn the spirits to the Jews and take the Gentile Church home she is in the making now well we're at the end time nearly now he's saying that in 60s that we're nearly at the end time amen praise the Lord so if God now remember when God was fully expressed to Jesus he left us with a promise that the church is going to do Greater Works right that was the son of man everybody agreed Jesus was the son of man now in re in in the Book of Luke 17:30 he telling you even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed yes so the prophet of God would tell us that he was a son of man revealing the son of man yes amen everybody's following when you're looking at the prophet and his his powerful anointing that's upon Him amen that is Christ in brother Brandon amen yes it is a son of man that's revealing the son of man am that's why he can stand with his back turned to the audience and discern them again showing it's Genesis 18 Again yes it's God in flesh again that's right amen okay but follow the train of thought when he goes off the scene there's got to be a group of people that come in after him and Greater Works than these shall he do amen because it's the same son of man that just left the Earth yeah yes thank you amen so his message you'll find here the prophet I'm I'm going to read a bit here and tell you he says the only way we can make meaningful purposeful contribution into the kingdom of God is through the Holy Ghost amen amen amen not of our own merits now we we can only make meaningful contributions to the kingdom of God through the Holy Ghost amen outside of the Holy Ghost it's our own ability trying to follow a religion he makes a powerful statement sh in the Statue of a perfect man he says Christ never sent me to build organization so he never sent brother Brandon to build a messy Church Christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the spirit now it doesn't stop there I'm going to go into this every one of us must be a Powerhouse that Dwelling Place of the holy spirit amen how is he doing it he's got a comma and he says by his word glory amen because if we are feeling like the opening of the word came and we can't see the effect of it or the purpose of it you're missing the point of brother brandham coming with a message because by the word he's going to build a Powerhouse he's going to build the individual up so that is why we've got to keep feeding on the word he says you're not feeding on the words of a man you're feeding on the body word of the son of man yes Hallelujah he says by his word see build the individual to that place amen so we can't get to be a powerful Army a glorious Church without the word yes the purpose of sending the word amen is to raise up this powerful Army amen but then we shouldn't amen we shouldn't belittle the word or and push it aside and say there's no meaning or no effect right especially when brother Bram labeled so much Amen in the early days and he says it wasn't in the early years of going out in the evangelism field and The Healing Ministry he said it was when I came with a message so which means it's the opening of the word amen it's the revelation of the Seven Seals amen it's the revelation of the church ages and all of these wonderful truths that we have Christ The Mystery of God revealed it takes the entire word now to build faith in a people amen amen so what is that the Holy Ghost working through the word amen so remember we are individuals being built into a Powerhouse of God not to build an organization to a greater denomination but to build individuals to Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea right add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge well now we are coming to a place he says when we begin to say we don't have to accept that today he says you do have to it must be now I'm asking us because we all interested parties here amen we all say we believe the word of God this word that we say we believe how much of time are we spending with the word of God Amen that's right amen hallelujah amen Maybe if I ask you to preach you might take time to go and study and read a scripture read some scriptures to gather a thought build a sermon around it but our our study of the word and our reading of the word should not be just for platform performance yes there's got to be a time of meditation a time where we can spend reading the word amen amen a time of personal growth if we are thinking that we we're only going to set aside a Sunday or a wedes day for spiritual growth we are going to be defeated amen this should be the Overflow we talk about overflow yes our reading the word and our prayer time and our worship time the Sunday morning and the Wednesday should be our overflow the extra amen thank you Lord it should not be our filling portion right amen amen hallelujah so we we are the most privileged people in the FI face of the Earth to have the books and the tapes in all formats yes right it's at the tip of our finger amen it's at the it's at our fingertips amen we have full access to it but I'm asking you again how much of time do we really spend with it because that will determine how much of value we place on [Music] it amen now the purpose of me asking that question is not to bring condemnation but he should really look and see hey I'm not doing that which means that would supposed to be our first love our our first love is being removed yes that which was sent to give us faith for Rapture our focus is taken away amen praise the Lord amen he says there's always been something about the church that isn't just exactly right cuz we know that's the devil it seems like there's been a lacking somewhere among the people I have my own ideas and we have beat at the bridge and beat these walls as hard as we could but yet in all of it we've been unsuccessful to Beat Down the Walls of the opposition yet I'm so glad that we got some bomb holes in it anyhow that someday this Great Wall of indifference amongst the people will fall down and God's Great United Army will March in one great Forefront with one one great Banner of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's my sincere hope amen amen so as hard as we've been preaching amen since last year since this year maybe amen we haven't made much impact to tear down walls but I pray amen we've we've sent enough bombs to at least blast some holes into it amen to there some stirring of the moving of the spirit amen you've probably seen some sort of spiritual growth within your life but I'm asking us let's press forward amen let's give more let's surrender more yes amen amen the prophet is saying now and I'm driving a point with this God intended the church to be a powerful Church a glorious church amen a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride of Christ well accepted and espoused and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present you to Christ at the coming of the Lord amen now who can say that we have arrived who can say we have arrived there he says God intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious Church a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride you know what we hear this is what we hear when somebody from the outside looks in brother Bram was such a powerful man of God right he moved in the prophetic he moved in the miraculous signs and wonders we know that he walked with Christ even TL Osborne says when I saw that man I saw Jesus Christ you know what they say we saw God Walk Through This Man what happened to the message church right that's right whereas now you what he's saying again he's saying he wants the whole world to see the bride of Christ amen amen I I I really think that the message church is settled for religion that's right that's true we're happy to come to church on a Sunday and a wedness day and we are safe in our comfort zone thinking the message is right and I'm safe there's no uh nothing required on my part amen but they if we if we really are honest with ourselves we'll know there's something lacking amen amen he says but we find out many times that with good intentions that people are trying to make themselves act like Christians they're trying to say well I know I am thus and I must live this way now if the church could not look at it that way God never intended Christianity to be governed by denominations neither by Creeds if God only allowed or intended for the church to be governed by Creeds denominations and intellectuals then we do not need the holy spirit in the church that's right I'm going to make a statement I think that the Holy Ghost is not welcome in most churches we have a program that we want to run yes we have men preaching that's not seeking the Holy Ghost for word that is present tense right amen hallelujah we can we can easily go into the messages and pull out any portion and come and people will be satisfied if we read quotes the entire service with no Holy Ghost conviction right amen praise the Lord you know in every in every area of study there is a there is a theory part that's right and and I know in the last two weeks I've really been preaching the theory of faith hope and charity but I've got to lay the mechanics before we can get into the Dynamics amen teaching is very important I'm trying to show you through the scriptures first about faith hope and charity before you can start to see it practically in our lives remember whatever we're preaching now is to equip you to that powerful Church yes it's not for Theory so we are preaching the mechanics of it yeah the mechanics but I tell you so that the Holy Ghost can move upon it in the Dynamics and bring it to life in your in your own personal life amen and you're going to see it yes Lord you're going to see a shift in the church in your life when you can apply these truths amen amen hallelujah the Holy Ghost is going to go into some things to take you into high dimensions of himself amen amen because the Holy Ghost can't exist outside of your body amen the Holy Ghost was meant to to empower You by coming into you amen amen the Holy Ghost can't empow EMP power you amen he can Empower you to a certain level by coming on your flesh you can jump you can shout you can sing you can move you can dance but he can only have a certain work there he can come upon your spirit amen he can have a certain work there but unless he gets into that genius Soul that's where he can have the most powerful influence amen hallelujah I I'm not going to be too long amen because it's our Wednesday night prayer meeting I intend to finish very shortly amen so catch while the spirit is speaking amen amen and I am saying amen we we need to move into this Dimension now right we can't be satisfied in living you know like a batted eagle flying in low altitudes amen amen right we don't want religion amen amen we don't want to be in the safety of our walls right no we are we why why do you think we are there's a cry and a groan pushing out prayer meeting all night prayer meeting amen more of the spirit of God more of this Lord Jesus I tell you what's consuming us we are satisfied just chasing money you know when God When God says that you can't serve God and he doesn't say the devil right because you'll either serve God or you'll go chasing money and all of us go to work for what because you love your boss you love the people that you work with what are you chasing you are chasing that money right now to chase that money you will not miss work you will not miss work you will miss church but you will not miss work so where who Do You Love More who do we love more amen amen what do we where are Works concentrated more so if we're putting God here and money here in all our activity for 30 days where is most of our energy and focus is it upon the money or is it upon God now remember you can have both because the the common thing is oh Lord if you only give me more time no but but if God gave you 10 minutes what are you doing with that 10 minutes Lord if you only give me a certain thing I will go across the world but you can't go across the street Lord if I only had an hour but you got 10 minutes and we're doing nothing with it so I know you know these things I'm just showing you God's principles are this that amen he wants us to be accountable amen because he's a God who demands return amen he's a God who loves investment and he loves return Yes you know the story about the talents he's a God who loves investment and he's a God who loves returns amen praise the Lord amen so in all that we are doing let us be good stewards amen the most powerful message to make us the most powerful church yet there's a there's a disconnect you know what it is it's a bad connection when you don't have good connection you don't get good signal when you got a te the cable the current is not flowing properly amen you're losing current praise the Lord let's move now to finish now amen hallelujah he says in the word I find that God did not intend the church to be governed by intellectual or by the Theology of man but by the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ now may be thinking that that sounds too simple he's saying the Holy Ghost was sent to govern and control the body of Christ and I think in doing that with that in mind and in God's program we will never be successful no matter how good our intentions are until we get back into the center of God's program where the holy spirit amen amen so we can't mix intellectuals with the word amen he says when the Holy Spirit desires to do a thing and degrade something or lift something up it causes petty jealousy among the people which proves they haven't got the Holy Spirit every man would want to be in his place now in this the people as a reason because they've seen so many denominations different dictators as it was and he he says it your spiritual dictators in the church but the Holy Ghost has placed each one into the body of Christ and we are helpless to maneuver without every member of the body we have to have my hands my arms my mouth my eyes everything that's in me has to operate and make my body function perfectly and then if God wanted his body the church to be governed by this by his Spirit there's got to be some way or some program that we've got to enter into that other than what we already have am so we're driving to a point now to show you how is God going to get this church a powerful Church how is God going to get a super Church how is God going to get make us a Powerhouse of God it's the main thing it's the thing that we need to ask ourselves even as many years as we've been in the message have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed amen thank you Lord amen let's start with that question I want you to think about this right now and ask yourself have I received the Holy Ghost since I believed amen he says shame on you who profess to be Christian and rely on such things for Joy when the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost Gospel is nothing but one big Power House of Joy the Holy Ghost is a perfect intoxication for every man that's got the blues you will take a drink of the Gospel of Jesus Christ be filled with the Holy Ghost you are drunk until you leave this world joy unspeakable and full of Glory a constant stimulation constant intoxication drunk day and night that's the word of God Amen now watch now he's not separating the holy ghost from the word of God Amen he says if you can see God moving in the church listen to how he says this now and I want you to catch this church I really want you to catch it because we are moving in a direction where amen from this direction we are talking about moving into an Enoch walk and from an Enoch walk we have to leave this world Amen so I really want you to catch what he's saying he says the church is supposed to be predestinated unto adoption of children where God can take a man and adopt him into the family give him something that first try that and see if it's right the Bible said try the spirit this man claims a certain thing try it and see if it's right if it's right move right with it amen thank you Lord amen if Exodus 23:23 is right the angel of God leading the church and if you determine it is right then move with it in the Third Exodus amen amen hallelujah amen yes then say Lord send us something else see he says don't be satisfied with that one thing Lord send us something else keep moving see just keep moving till every fellow takes his place then you're going to see the Church of God begin to get its place amen amen amen the time of us thinking that everything I want to place it upon the ministry is over the ministry wants to place it back on you amen because the ministry needs to see you develop into your full potential amen hallelujah the ministry amen can be at R when you become the super church and the super race when you are the ones going two by two amen going into the streets amen going and ministering to people amenah let me ask you in your circle of friends and families do you see people that need to be ministered to people that are hurting that are broken how about we start there with the evangelism tool amen and say Brothers this person you know they are most open to you because they they trust you that's right and when they down and and maybe need help amen tell them can I get the brothers to come and pray for you can I get them to come and witness to you we we trying to go out amen and blast them with speakers and they but they in our own circles there may be people in need I saying we have resources and we're not using them that's right amen because now we are ashamed we don't want everybody around us to think we are too spiritual amen the first thing you should say when somebody is telling you something he's not hey I know this doctor and I know this person and I know this person can help you you should go spiritual first amen amen you should Ascend the spiritual realm first amen amen and I I really want you to take that to heart amen amen because you can put the ministry to work you can put the brothers to work amen but as as long as we leave it up now to the ministry and let them carry on whatever they do is fine leave me and my family alone what we are finding is families are not growing spiritually yes that's right amen families are not growing spiritually they're coming to church week after week they're not growing spiritually because there's no implementation of what they hearing from the pulpit into their homes amen at home they allowed to live any kind of lives do any kind of things but here amen there's an expectation when they come to church so I'm saying we don't want that kind of religion that's so let's keep moving amen we got to keep he says get the Philistines to back off he says the shorts will go off the hair will grow down faces will be washed cigars missing when the church begins to get into its Mighty power when we have an an and Safa and a few of them you'll see when the Holy Ghost Church stands together in his power positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God powerful Church standing there in its Glory oh that's what he's coming for Hallelujah I'll close with this quote now amen it's 5 minutes past 8 and we need to start praying amen he says now listen to this the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts God back in man am Hallelujah now if you can only digest what he is saying there how can he put something back into you meaning it was there in the beginning amen okayy so what did Adam really lose yes amen we we say it uh uh how can I say out of intellect Adam lost the book what do you mean you had one book remember man's original Spirit was the Holy Spirit right amen God was condescending yeah right amen so he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts God back in man amen I can just read that and meditate on that for hours yes the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts God back in man then I can go to Genesis I can think I can think on the lives of all the prophets he says it was Christ in Moses Christ in Noah yes Christ in the prophets the the psalmist and I can look at the life of Paul Paul and the apostles I can look at the life of brother Brandon God back in man am amen amen than Jesus going to read it again it's not too long I'm going to finish now the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts God back in man am to live in man and to restore a man to a state of communion with him again amen amen and give him back his god-given right amen that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption amen amen now that's a sobering thought God needs to finish his Plan of Redemption but he requires man to finish it he needs the holy ghost in a man to finish the Plan of Redemption working through you making you a coworker with him amen amen that if you're writing it down in what was the Holy Ghost given for 59121 17 amen so as as I'm closing now we can stand together let's stand together I want you to think on these things God wants a glorious holy ghost filled Church there can be no glory without the Holy Ghost amen we we can't be receiving the word of God without the Holy Ghost amen amen yes Lord amen because we don't want flat dry Services amen the Holy Ghost in you will respond to the word of God the Holy Ghost In You amen hallelujah will punctuate every word of God with an amen in fact the Holy Ghost amen if you really allowing the Holy Ghost within you even now there should be a change within you amen because you are able to say Lord I am weighed tonight in the balances amen and I'm found wanting amen let's just take prayer life Lord I'm found wanting let's just take Bible reading Time Lord I'm found wanting let's take the reading the message of the hour listening to something I'm found wanting amen amen let's not be professors of the word yes the Bible says it this way don't be hearers of the word but be doers of the word amen I find amen we at this Junction time now where if we if we don't really if you read revelation 22 there it says oh let's just cut it off let him who filthy be filthy and let him who holy be holy amen we don't want to come to that time now where we hear the word of God and our conscience is seared with a hot ey and it has no effect on us we can't we can't even pray with tears we can't even pray with repentance we can't even pray amen for 10 minutes and you know what we we can't even we don't even pretend that we can pray for longer you watch when we pray in the church 10 minutes flat and everyone's dead there's no groan of the spirit why we are trying to control the Holy Spirit when the Bible says that the Holy Ghost within us makes groanings on our behalf amen so forget what you know about Christianity forget what you think you know about how we should behave and act and right now I want you to begin to be able to say holy spirit I give you full control over my body my soul my spirit one time you come into His presence you'll never be the same again God wants a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle if God were to Rapture you tonight will he be able to take you if he was coming amen amen hallelujah have we emptied out the world Lord have we emptied out our love for money have we emptied out amen our pursuit of material things yes and can can be focused and say Lord I realize that those are my responsibilities in life but I don't want that to be the main thing you know when there's a love for God and that's why I love listening to some testimonies of the early day Brothers they'll tell you they couldn't wait for their lunch break they couldn't wait to get alone and just maybe read a book or read the Bible it became their passion yes became their life after after after work they'll meet with Brothers they just wanted to be around the word amen where are our own experiences of that where where is our own love for that and now we have more technology that time they couldn't phone one another that time they they they couldn't WhatsApp one another they had to physically meet one another they'll tell you they used to go till 2:00 in the morning and they have to wake up again maybe at 5:00 in the morning what is that a passion because they met a reality they saw truth in the message they saw something in the message that changed their lives amen yes Lord yes we're our own experiences we can't have intellectual experiences or we can't be warmed by their fire young men brothers and sisters I'm challenging us what are we doing for the kingdom of God Amen just because we got 5 R we think we're okay we can buy a loaf of bread we can feed the family we think everything is fine there's no concern for anything else no concern no passion amen somebody's sick we can't even go visit them somebody's sick in hospital you won't go visit them hey somebody you won't even phone them to check some something is wrong we're preaching about faith hope and love but that has got to be on display thank you Lord it's got to be on display praise the Lord but yet if we are sick
