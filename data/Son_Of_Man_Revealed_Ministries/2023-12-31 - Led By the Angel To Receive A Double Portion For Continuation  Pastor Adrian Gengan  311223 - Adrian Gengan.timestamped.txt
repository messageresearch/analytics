[19:30] hallelujah praise the Lord I want to
[19:33] speak this morning on led by the angel
[19:36] to receive a double portion for
[19:39] continuation amen Exodus
[19:42] 23:23 led by the angel to receive a
[19:45] double portion for continuation amen
[19:49] amen so we'll turn to Exodus 23 verse
[19:53] 23 or start from verse 20
[19:57] amen
[19:59] did you get my notes for the J amen
[20:02] praise the
[20:04] Lord that used to be a brother adson's
[20:07] job amen going back in the day now
[20:12] Exodus 23:20 says behold I send an angel
[20:16] before
[20:17] thee to keep thee in the way and to
[20:21] bring thee into the place which I have
[20:23] prepared amen and then if you drop down
[20:27] to verse 2 three
[20:29] there it says for my angel shall go
[20:32] before thee and bring thee unto the
[20:35] amorites the I ites the perizzites the
[20:38] Canaanites evites and jebusites and I
[20:41] will cut them off yes now we see there
[20:44] are six ites tights and whatever there
[20:46] amen
[20:47] vites and
[20:49] knights now there six types man the
[20:53] flesh right but I want you to know in
[20:55] physical Israel the angel is still
[20:57] cutting off yes even now yes amen right
[21:01] now they are not called amorites ites
[21:03] and things they're called
[21:05] Palestinians amen and who's doing the
[21:08] cutting off oh hallelujah amen the angel
[21:11] of the Lord amen you may be seated the
[21:13] Lord bless the reading of his word amen
[21:16] amen if we can just put that first verse
[21:19] up there 20
[21:22] amen that says behold I sent an angel
[21:25] before thee to keep thee in the way
[21:29] so God knows that part of the human
[21:31] condition is that men tend to go
[21:33] astray but the angel is there to keep
[21:36] you in the way amen this is not a broad
[21:39] way this is a narrow way and few want to
[21:43] walk in this way but the angel of God
[21:45] has come to keep you in the way amen
[21:48] amen sometimes you want to uh go off
[21:50] path sometimes you want to deviate from
[21:52] the way sometimes you may think you
[21:55] found a better way but I want you to
[21:56] know the angel of God is to keep you in
[21:58] the way amen amen and don't think it's
[22:01] impossible for message Believers to go
[22:03] out of the way because the prophet saw
[22:05] in a vision he saw the Bride of the last
[22:07] days stepping out of line she got out of
[22:10] the way and he cried out stay in
[22:13] line
[22:15] amen hallelujah so we are being led by
[22:18] the mighty Angel to receive a double
[22:20] portion for
[22:22] continuation amen hallelujah amen if we
[22:27] read the last verse part of that verse
[22:29] there on
[22:31] 20 and to bring thee into a place which
[22:36] I have prepared amen amen I want you to
[22:40] know God will not lead you to
[22:43] nothingness God has prepared a place for
[22:46] you and I to be in amen hallelujah in
[22:49] this prepared place you will find rest
[22:52] in this prepared place it's a land
[22:53] filled of abundance it's a land flowing
[22:56] with milk and honey amen Amen in this
[22:58] land amen he's got everything that you
[23:01] and I need for this life amen I want you
[23:04] to know the nature and the
[23:05] characteristics of our God when he
[23:07] prepares a place it's really a prepared
[23:10] Place amen where the enemy cannot stand
[23:12] amen yes
[23:14] amen and if God if we are so particular
[23:17] in our preparations for our children and
[23:18] our families we want the best for them
[23:21] how much more amen and how much more
[23:23] glorious and how much more marvelous
[23:25] God's prepared place will be amen amen
[23:29] hallelujah the Bible declares that the
[23:32] prepared place is a place where God
[23:34] supplies all our needs according to his
[23:36] witches in glory amen amen but some
[23:39] don't want that
[23:41] place amen that's Philippians 4:9 God's
[23:45] prepared place he supplies all our needs
[23:48] but you got to come to him and recognize
[23:50] him as Source you can't go your own way
[23:53] your own choosing and your own thinking
[23:55] and think that this is the end that life
[23:56] has dealt me and this this is my portion
[23:58] in life you need to get out of your
[24:00] condition the word of God tells you how
[24:02] to get out of your condition amen
[24:05] there's no reason for you to live
[24:07] beneath your god-given privileges Amen
[24:09] in My Father's House amen hallelujah he
[24:12] owns a cattle on a thousand
[24:14] years amen you need to change your
[24:16] thinking yes that's right amen that's
[24:18] where it all starts you change your
[24:20] thinking here amen amen God's prepared
[24:24] place we know is Malachi 45 and 6 amen
[24:27] what is that turning our heart back to
[24:29] the faith of the fathers God's prepared
[24:31] places Revelation 10 what is that
[24:33] revealing the mystery of God you see the
[24:36] entire chapter I say yes the entire
[24:38] chapter is revealing the mystery of God
[24:41] but it's a hidden Mystery amen I know
[24:44] some of you didn't catch that I said the
[24:46] entire chapter of Revelation 10 is
[24:48] revealing the mystery of God you say but
[24:51] from verse 8 it deals with me yes you
[24:53] are revealing the mystery of God yes
[24:56] that's right right
[24:58] get it amen it's fine amen it's not
[25:01] meant for everybody it's meant for
[25:03] certain people when you realize you are
[25:05] expressing the mystery of God Amen you
[25:07] walk in step with the word of God Amen
[25:10] someone to shun it away because they are
[25:11] too afraid of the anointing of God they
[25:14] are too afraid of the Holy Ghost they
[25:16] are too afraid that will make them act a
[25:17] little bit radical amen make you raise
[25:20] your hand and shout hallelujah Make You
[25:22] Dance in the spirit amen make you get
[25:24] drunk in the
[25:26] spirit prise amen hallelujah we got too
[25:30] many watered down religion amen too many
[25:32] polished up religion amen but what we
[25:34] need is an oldfashioned Pentecostal
[25:36] experience yes Lord amen God prepared
[25:40] place for the believer in this time God
[25:42] has certain Seasons a lotted and he
[25:45] didn't open up certain Seasons to
[25:46] different people Mark 11:23 wasn't
[25:49] opened up to Luther neither was it
[25:51] opened up to Wesley neither was it
[25:53] opened up to zza Street Revival but Mark
[25:55] 11:23 was opened up to the the prophet
[25:58] of this age amen and we are a
[26:00] continuation of that
[26:02] message what is Mark 11:23 a call for
[26:06] man to return to the power of the spoken
[26:09] word oh yes that's God's prepared Place
[26:13] amen I'm still dealing with the prepared
[26:14] Place amen hallelujah God's prepared
[26:17] Place amen he the place where all things
[26:19] are possible that's Mark
[26:21] 9:23 but it's a place where you need
[26:24] belief if thou can't believe then all
[26:27] things are
[26:29] possible amen people can't believe God
[26:32] for a truth AE amen how you going to
[26:34] believe all things are possible amen
[26:37] hallelujah amen a prepared place for us
[26:39] is Romans 8:23 amen a call for sons and
[26:43] daughters amen all creation is calling
[26:46] all creation is groaning it's a call for
[26:48] Sons and Daughters to do what Amen to
[26:51] come back to their true position and
[26:53] their true
[26:54] identity that's
[26:56] right
[26:58] but some are ignoring creation's call
[27:01] amen some are satisfied with what Satan
[27:03] has to offer in Eden in his Eden amen
[27:07] hallelujah didn't Jesus tell us in in
[27:09] John 14:12 14:2 in my father's house are
[27:13] many mansions if it were not so I would
[27:16] have told you I go to prepare a place
[27:18] for you oh this is now a preparation out
[27:21] of this world amen
[27:23] amen those scriptures we dealt with
[27:26] right now we're dealing with your
[27:27] preparation in this life but Jesus in
[27:30] his parting sermon to them before he
[27:31] goes to the Cross he's telling them I am
[27:34] making preparations in heaven for you
[27:36] yes
[27:37] yes
[27:39] amen right now my Plan of Redemption is
[27:42] for you to come back to
[27:44] glorification amen but you're in a flesh
[27:46] body and there's no way for you Amen to
[27:49] get back there you bypass your theophany
[27:52] so I'm preparing a place for you to get
[27:54] back to your theophany body amen yes
[27:58] Lord thank you Lord amen so God Jesus is
[28:01] saying I go to prepare a place for you
[28:03] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[28:06] I will come again and receive you unto
[28:08] myself that where I am there you may be
[28:12] also
[28:13] amen yes how many if you want to be
[28:15] where Jesus is amen amen hallelujah the
[28:19] Bible even declares that even now we are
[28:20] seated together in Heavenly places with
[28:23] Christ Jesus amen amen hallelujah amen
[28:28] glory be to his name so I want you to
[28:31] know that
[28:32] continuation what is
[28:34] continuation
[28:36] amen it's continuing something or a
[28:40] prolongation of a state or activity or
[28:43] it's a resumption after an
[28:47] interruption
[28:49] right if you look at the seven Church
[28:51] ages even though there were
[28:53] interruptions there was continuity yes
[28:56] amen amen even though they denominated
[28:59] and stopped the continuity there was
[29:01] disruptions everybody following my
[29:04] thought when the next messenger took off
[29:07] there was continuity yes
[29:09] amen they didn't have to start back
[29:14] yes amen there is continuity how many of
[29:18] you know there ought to be continuity in
[29:19] our life we call it growth amen if we
[29:23] are not growing there's something wrong
[29:25] you know what stagnant water is yes what
[29:27] happens with stagnant water brother the
[29:29] raes T Tad PES and you're getting worms
[29:32] and you're getting the water
[29:34] contaminated amen there shouldn't be
[29:36] stagnation in a believer's life the
[29:38] Bible says we go from glory to glory
[29:41] amen if you are stagnated if you are
[29:44] remaining still then something is wrong
[29:45] with your walk with the Lord then you
[29:47] are not being led by the angel amen
[29:50] yes amen hallelujah now continuation as
[29:55] says requires consecration
[29:57] yes amen consecration a consecrated life
[30:02] a holy life
[30:05] yeah we need a call back to prayer amen
[30:09] we need a call back to reading the Bible
[30:11] yes amen
[30:13] amen amen we have some very good
[30:15] Catholic message people who only want
[30:18] the priest to read the
[30:24] Bible a better do here
[30:32] amen people want me to be like a
[30:34] Catholic priest you want me to come with
[30:35] a white collar here and read the
[30:40] Bible say three ill
[30:43] mares you want
[30:45] religion amen for example if I ask you
[30:50] it's been 12 months gone this year did
[30:54] you at least listen to 12 sermons amen
[30:57] of of the Vindicated Prophet your
[31:01] Prophet amen now know that's not
[31:04] something that everybody's readily going
[31:06] to answer right now but I ask you to do
[31:09] introspection don't look and see I'm
[31:11] going to sit back now after the service
[31:13] and see how much money I made the whole
[31:15] year I'm going to count how much money
[31:17] and see if I was successful this year
[31:19] measure your success according to the
[31:20] word amen
[31:23] amen hallelujah that's right amen amen
[31:28] you see if we do introspection and we
[31:30] really check how many hours did we spend
[31:32] in prayer how many hours did we spend
[31:34] reading the word yes how many hours did
[31:37] we surrender to the Holy
[31:40] Spirit but now you see I don't know if
[31:43] Netflix can tell you the amount of hours
[31:44] you spent watching that maybe your phone
[31:47] can tell you how many hours you spent on
[31:50] it you see we can measure these
[31:53] things but if we if we really want to
[31:56] progress if we really want to be led by
[31:58] the angel for
[32:00] continuation for a double
[32:02] portion you see the this double portion
[32:04] thing is not a buzz word yes it's not a
[32:08] catchphrase yes we realize that we need
[32:11] this power amen amen to make it out of
[32:14] here without it we are not going that's
[32:17] right amen we are the continuation of
[32:20] William bram's
[32:22] Ministry the ministry of William
[32:24] brandham is not dead amen he was the
[32:27] elah we are the
[32:28] Elisha come on now I need more people to
[32:30] connect with that amen you are not
[32:33] called here to come and say that God
[32:34] sent us a prophet God sent us a prophet
[32:37] and that's where it stops amen
[32:40] amen that's right amen I want to pick up
[32:44] the story here in 1 Samuel chapter 1 and
[32:48] I want to take the story of Alena and
[32:52] Anna now Alena had two wives and you
[32:57] read there in the story that panina had
[33:00] two children and this man alkaa was from
[33:04] the tribe
[33:05] of ephraimite and you know the Ephraim
[33:08] where Ephraim is from whose son is he
[33:11] Joseph he's Joseph son right so alen is
[33:15] Joseph's son if I can say it this way
[33:17] this is Joseph
[33:20] reproduced
[33:22] amen but he comes now and panana has
[33:26] children but an has no
[33:28] children now I want you to learn a few
[33:30] things from the
[33:31] story and see amen what we can learn out
[33:34] of this it says here year after year
[33:37] Alena would go up from his City to
[33:39] worship and sacrifice to the Lord of
[33:41] hosts at
[33:43] Shiloh notice
[33:50] consecration where Eli's two sons opne
[33:53] and Phineas were Priests of the Lord and
[33:55] whenever they came the day came for for
[33:57] Alena to present his sacrifice he would
[34:00] give portion to his wife pan and to all
[34:04] his sons and
[34:05] daughters but to Anna he would give a
[34:08] double
[34:09] portion
[34:11] amen amen
[34:14] yes thank
[34:16] you thank you hello amen somebody is
[34:21] receiving a double portion
[34:23] amen yes
[34:25] amen
[34:27] amen let's go on further then we'll talk
[34:30] about it
[34:32] amen why was he giving a double portion
[34:35] for he loved her even
[34:40] though how many if you know people who
[34:42] can't have
[34:45] children the only reason why they can't
[34:47] have children is because of this yes
[34:49] what is the Bible
[34:52] saying oh no but in my biological makeup
[34:57] they tell me that I have a certain
[34:58] condition that is why I can't have
[35:04] children who closes HS who open Sarah's
[35:07] home who open Elizabeth's home who open
[35:10] Rebecca's home amen yes
[35:13] Lord wonderful thank you amen don't see
[35:17] some people rely too much on
[35:20] science believe me if they had a
[35:22] sonogram and things here they wouldn't
[35:24] have been able to help Anna in any way
[35:27] the Lord closed the wom if they try to
[35:29] do what this
[35:32] thing where they can help you artificial
[35:35] in semination and all of these things if
[35:37] God shuts the home he shuts the
[35:39] wom so if God has given you children you
[35:41] ought to be grateful to the Lord and
[35:43] give him praise
[35:44] amen there are many people who can't
[35:46] have children amen I'm going to show you
[35:49] the Lord reiterates
[35:51] us amen so yeah the Lord Clos him then
[35:56] verse 6 because the Lord had closed
[35:59] Anna's
[36:00] Home a rival would provoke her and taunt
[36:03] her
[36:05] viciously now my point of bringing this
[36:08] can you be a person married to Jesus
[36:11] Christ with a double portion anointing
[36:14] amen and not reproducing his life oh
[36:17] yes thank you
[36:21] Lord
[36:22] hallelujah that's what I want you to get
[36:24] from the
[36:25] story everyone can say I'm the wife I'm
[36:28] the bride of Christ yeah you're the
[36:30] bride of Christ
[36:32] congratulations on your
[36:34] marriage we'll send you a wedding gift
[36:38] congratulations you married to Jesus
[36:41] Christ you went to Home Affairs and you
[36:44] changed your ID you show everyone I'm
[36:46] Mrs Lord Jesus
[36:49] Christ he's giving you double portion
[36:51] anointings amen amen but you're walking
[36:55] around like Anna
[36:57] your home is
[36:59] closed no
[37:00] life no fruit yes you do nothing with
[37:04] the message you do nothing for people
[37:06] you do nothing for no one but you know
[37:10] BR I was reading here and the Bible the
[37:12] prophet says eternal life is living for
[37:13] others e you're like a schizophrenia
[37:16] person you only live for yourself and
[37:18] you saying you're living for
[37:20] others that's why I'm saying you got
[37:25] schizophrenia
[37:27] you're actually living for yourself but
[37:28] you're thinking you're living for
[37:29] another
[37:30] person
[37:33] selfish but the prophet says eternal
[37:35] life is living for others
[37:38] amen amen praise the
[37:43] Lord so don't be that person
[37:47] now walking hearing about the double
[37:49] portion anointing but no life no fruit
[37:53] no Works nothing dry Barren unfruitful
[37:58] amen but let's go on
[38:00] Amen so here we find amen
[38:04] that this went on year after year
[38:07] whenever Anna went up to the house of
[38:09] the Lord a rival taunted her until she
[38:11] wept and would not
[38:13] eat now the husband ask her Anna why are
[38:17] you
[38:18] crying remember doesn't sound familiar
[38:20] now was Elisha asking people what can I
[38:23] do for you what can I do for you
[38:27] this is a man who's giving her double
[38:30] portions why are you
[38:32] crying amen just so you know that this
[38:35] man man's name means God has created but
[38:40] he has not witnessed a creative power
[38:42] yet the the name Al in Hebrew means God
[38:45] has created but you know your name
[38:48] represents your character your nature
[38:50] and something God's going to do in your
[38:51] life God's about to do a creative power
[38:55] amen a creative of power miracle in his
[38:58] wife so he's got the right
[39:01] name Adam means favor or
[39:03] Grace amen amen she's walking around
[39:07] with the name
[39:09] Grace
[39:10] favor but notice the Bible is giving you
[39:13] Clues there but maybe we are missing it
[39:15] he's saying year after year she went she
[39:18] continually went amen she never stopped
[39:21] her altar she never stopped stopped
[39:23] worshiping she never stopped amen coming
[39:26] before the Lord with a
[39:30] supplication maybe things didn't happen
[39:32] for us this year and we are
[39:36] disgruntle nothing worked out for me
[39:38] this year watch your heart condition
[39:41] Beyond expectation for you know not when
[39:43] the angel of God will
[39:46] move yes sir it may be midnight to
[39:50] midday and never early never late yes is
[39:55] going to stand by what he says
[39:59] amen I lived enough life to
[40:03] say Al is on the way he could come at
[40:06] the last minute amen amen tonight when
[40:09] you're looking there
[40:11] 23
[40:13] 59 is when he could
[40:19] come
[40:22] amen you remember he came 4 days late
[40:25] yes he came 4 days later at the grave of
[40:28] Lazarus amen had he come 2 days early it
[40:33] wouldn't have been the will of
[40:35] God why Lazarus was sick un death what
[40:39] would Jesus have
[40:40] done Jesus would have healed
[40:45] him but according to the vision which
[40:47] God has showed him he wasn't going to
[40:49] heal laus he was going to raise him from
[40:52] the dead amen so he had to prolong and
[40:54] he had to delay in order for Lazarus to
[40:57] be dead stinking
[40:59] buried
[41:01] yes so God knows what plan he has
[41:03] written for our
[41:05] lives amen and he coming according just
[41:08] on time amen hallelujah so notice she's
[41:12] she's going in still to worship to pray
[41:14] going to the house of the Lord she never
[41:16] stops coming to church amen amen she
[41:20] never stops worshiping the Lord amen
[41:23] she's got the right attitude she's
[41:25] creating the right atmosphere amen amen
[41:28] you know atmosphere is what it takes for
[41:30] the angel of God to move amen all of us
[41:33] are creators of an atmosphere amen
[41:36] hallelujah amen why are you crying Anna
[41:39] why won't you eat why is your heart so
[41:42] grieved am I not better to you than 10
[41:44] Sons so after they had finished eating
[41:47] amen so here we find after they had
[41:49] finished eating and drinking in shoh
[41:52] Anna stood up now Eli the priest was
[41:55] sitting on a chair by by the doorpost of
[41:57] the Temple of the Lord in a bitter
[41:59] distress Anna prayed to the Lord and
[42:01] wept with many tears and she made a vow
[42:04] pleading oh lord of host if only you
[42:06] will look upon the Affliction of your
[42:08] maid servant and remember me not
[42:10] forgetting your maid servant by but
[42:13] giving her a son then I will dedicate
[42:16] him to the Lord all the days of his life
[42:18] and no razor shall ever come over his
[42:21] head as Anna kept on praying before the
[42:24] Lord Eli watched her mouth
[42:27] now notice she moved from crying because
[42:30] crying will do nothing from you to you
[42:32] for you what did we learn this year you
[42:35] must speak so even if you're crying use
[42:40] some words yes because the power of the
[42:42] spoken word lies in your You Must
[42:45] Believe in Your Heart confess with your
[42:47] if you say to this
[42:49] mountain if you think to the
[42:51] mountain what did Jesus say in Mark
[42:54] 11:23 if you pray to the
[42:57] mountain if you pray to the father and
[43:00] tell the father to move the
[43:03] mountain does it say pray or
[43:07] say brother put it up amen help somebody
[43:11] amen what is Mark 11:23 saying it is
[43:15] saying if you pray to the mountain or if
[43:17] you pray to the father verily verily I
[43:20] say unto you that whosoever shall say
[43:24] unto this mountain
[43:27] amen
[43:28] [Music]
[43:31] amen be thou removed and be thou cast
[43:34] into the
[43:35] sea and shall not doubt in his heart yes
[43:39] but believe those things which he had
[43:41] said shall come to pass he shall have
[43:44] whatsoever he saith
[43:46] amen amen so that's where man got away
[43:49] from that's where Adam fell from Adam
[43:52] disbelieved his own word so when Jesus
[43:54] curses the Fig Tre
[43:56] you know the Bible if you if you go back
[43:58] to your scripture maybe go into the uh
[44:00] Bible app then amen if you go into that
[44:04] scripture you'll see that Jesus curses
[44:07] the
[44:09] victory amen amen
[44:15] amen why was it
[44:17] so you know Jesus could have used his
[44:20] power in many ways the same power he
[44:22] used to curse the Fig Tre he could have
[44:25] used the power
[44:27] to speak fruit on the
[44:31] tree everybody understanding amen he
[44:34] could have said bear forth
[44:37] fruit but Jesus already set the law back
[44:40] in Genesis that every seed must bring
[44:43] forth of its kind amen amen so God is
[44:46] under expectation for you to bring forth
[44:48] fruit in your life so he's walking to
[44:51] this fig tree and a fig tree having
[44:53] leaves now if you know about a fig tree
[44:55] when a fig tree has leaves it means it's
[44:57] got
[44:59] fruit so Jesus looking a far at this fig
[45:02] tree he comes to the Fig Tree thinking
[45:04] he's got fruit and he came and he found
[45:06] nothing but leaves for the time of fig
[45:08] was not yet
[45:10] right and Jesus answered and said unto
[45:13] it now why will you answer someone if
[45:17] that thing is not talking to
[45:20] you if you talk to something what they
[45:24] say you are you go talk to a
[45:28] tree they'll say you're
[45:31] mad but the tree is talking to
[45:36] Jesus now some of you don't know what
[45:38] I'm talking about I'm going to simplify
[45:39] it for you every time you pick up your
[45:41] light bull your water bu your deps isn't
[45:44] it talking to
[45:48] you it's talking to you what is it
[45:51] saying
[45:54] CA
[45:57] right learn principles now this is not a
[45:59] sermon this is for you to apply in your
[46:02] life so whatever he's talking to you you
[46:06] need to talk back to it Jesus answered
[46:09] and said unto it no man eat fruit of
[46:11] thee here after forever and his
[46:14] disciples heard it amen right so we know
[46:17] that Jesus goes back to the temple he
[46:18] goes for a time of consecration he has
[46:20] consecration again he goes to the temple
[46:23] to consecrate them consecrate the temple
[46:26] and then he comes back the next day
[46:27] right let's move
[46:29] up 20 maybe go to
[46:33] 20 right and in the morning as they
[46:36] passed by they saw the fig tree dried up
[46:38] from the
[46:39] roots next verse Peter calling to
[46:43] remembrance said unto him Master behold
[46:45] the Fig Tree which thy curse is withered
[46:48] away what is Peter really saying here
[46:51] Lord tell us how you did
[46:54] it Peter wants to to learn he's calling
[46:57] his attention to the Fig Tree because he
[46:59] wants to learn how he did
[47:02] it and here is what Jesus is saying
[47:05] Jesus said unto them have faith in God
[47:09] Amen now if you look at that translation
[47:11] the faith this is Galatians 2:20 now it
[47:13] says the faith that I have is the faith
[47:15] of the Son of God so he's telling you
[47:18] you need to have the faith of
[47:20] God everyone following amen because why
[47:23] I'm saying this is very important for
[47:24] you to understand the verse now when it
[47:27] says whosoever that whosoever is only
[47:30] those that are operating in the faith of
[47:32] God Amen it's not any Tom diary yes amen
[47:37] you must have the faith of God oh yes
[47:40] and now we go to the next verse in order
[47:42] for that whosoever to operate amen
[47:44] wonderful
[47:46] amen
[47:48] amen now whosoever shall say to your
[47:51] electricity bill whosoever shall say
[47:54] unto your water bill
[47:59] that this de shall be
[48:02] clear whosoever shall say to your
[48:06] debt whosoever shall say to your demon
[48:09] possessed child yes whosoever shall say
[48:12] to your sick child amen whosoever shall
[48:14] say unto your
[48:17] Mountain amen amen
[48:21] amen for verily I say unto you that your
[48:24] pastor shall speak to your Mountain
[48:27] call the Deacon to speak to your
[48:33] Mountain remember we are not lians here

[48:44] hour is come to put the bow back in the
[48:46] people oh yes God Amen whosoever are you
[48:51] or whosoever the one that has the faith
[48:53] of God I want you to speak to your

[49:02] Gregorian calendar

[1:03:02] amen our lord Jesus says you believe in
[1:03:04] God believe also in me
[1:03:07] amen now Christ is in his body so the
[1:03:10] body has to say you believe in
[1:03:13] Jesus believe also in
[1:03:16] me but you see you don't see the mystery
[1:03:19] of God
[1:03:21] there but before other people can
[1:03:23] believe in you
[1:03:25] You Must Believe In what the word says
[1:03:27] about
[1:03:28] you as long as you don't see your in the
[1:03:31] word if Jesus never saw himself in the
[1:03:34] word he wouldn't have been able to do
[1:03:36] what he did Jesus knew what the word
[1:03:38] said about him Amen Hallelujah Jesus now
[1:03:42] in St John 14:12 here's the continuity

[1:04:18] pool amen amen each anointing was
[1:04:21] greater amen amen if if you were had a
[1:04:26] greater anointing when you first came to
[1:04:27] the knowledge of the truth something is
[1:04:29] wrong with your
[1:04:31] walk
[1:04:33] hello if you had the greatest Revelation
[1:04:36] when you first came to the knowledge of
[1:04:37] the message of the hour something is

[1:05:36] says there but in the days of the voice
[1:05:38] of the seventh angel when he shall began

[1:05:42] finished as he had declared to his
[1:05:44] servant the prophets yes
[1:05:47] amen
[1:05:50] amen so William brandom is to reveal the
[1:05:52] mystery of God
[1:05:54] and when he reveals the mystery of God
[1:05:57] our eyes become open and we realize that
[1:06:00] we are part of the mystery of God
[1:06:02] because it's Christ in me the hope of
[1:06:03] glory all that was in God he into Christ
[1:06:07] and all that was in Christ he pour into
[1:06:08] his church amen
[1:06:11] yes so you can't separate us from the
[1:06:13] mystery of God that is why there's a
[1:06:16] continuation now after verse 7 to
[1:06:19] continue I'm telling you the angel is
[1:06:20] leading us in a double portion anointing
[1:06:22] for continuation amen all the way to
[1:06:25] verse 8 for many years people refused to

[1:06:35] time recognize your season recognize
[1:06:37] what you are called for yes amen amen

[1:07:13] on their thing talking about aab now and
[1:07:15] how could Mah say anything else but stay
[1:07:17] with that word so staying with the word

[1:07:25] William brandom's message God is showing
[1:07:27] us a continuation amen come on now we
[1:07:30] are not leaving William bram's message
[1:07:32] because we stayed with the prophet and
[1:07:33] his word God is showing us the
[1:07:35] continuation how many of you want to see
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:39] continuation
[1:07:44] amen think of the woman out the well who
[1:07:48] whoever drinks of this water Drinker of
[1:07:50] this water if you notice it wasn't just
[1:07:52] take a drink and walk walk away and

[1:08:08] water is amen tell me what that water
[1:08:12] is come on now hey what is that water
[1:08:17] who soever shall drink of this
[1:08:21] water shall never thirst but the water
[1:08:24] that I shall give him shall be in him
[1:08:29] amen it's the Holy Ghost and Fire that
[1:08:33] is keeping me
[1:08:35] alive keeping me
[1:08:37] alive some people got the Holy Ghost as
[1:08:39] a pit in a cage but the Holy Ghost needs
[1:08:43] to be in you out of you shall flow amen
[1:08:46] rivers of Living Waters Holy Ghost
[1:08:49] within you amen Holy Ghost Fire come and
[1:08:51] burn out everything amen man that's
[1:08:54] continuation whosoever drinketh of the
[1:08:56] water that I shall give him and he shall
[1:08:58] never thirst I want you to know that
[1:09:00] this woman at the well for those of you
[1:09:02] who ever sit and think about things even
[1:09:05] though she ran into the city to say come
[1:09:06] see a man told me things I have done you
[1:09:09] know she had to receive the baptism of
[1:09:11] the Holy Ghost she would never make it
[1:09:12] to Heaven
[1:09:18] yes amen you know we read all the
[1:09:21] stories in the Bible the woman with the
[1:09:24] issue of blood yeah she got a healing
[1:09:27] the man that was at the temple
[1:09:29] man got his healing but every one of
[1:09:33] them if they wanted to make it on the
[1:09:34] other side what they needed to
[1:09:36] do they needed to get to the upper
[1:09:39] room they needed to be
[1:09:42] baptized you know we automatically think
[1:09:44] when we read the Bible hey because they
[1:09:46] were healed they were saved who said you
[1:09:49] can be healed today and your healing can
[1:09:50] be gone
[1:09:51] tomorrow you can be healed of one thing
[1:09:53] today tomorrow you get another
[1:09:56] sickness so it's salvation of the Soul
[1:09:59] that's most important
[1:10:01] amen some people don't like what I'm
[1:10:05] saying amen cuz you don't agree with
[1:10:07] what I'm saying why in the Bible does he
[1:10:10] tell you they were
[1:10:11] saved they were healed
[1:10:14] yes why did Paul find it necessary to
[1:10:18] find John's
[1:10:19] converts and tell them how are you
[1:10:21] baptized yes that's right reveal the
[1:10:24] baptism to them and they had to receive
[1:10:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:10:34] amen amen let's just close with this
[1:10:37] quote here let me show you another
[1:10:39] reason why Satan hates the Book of
[1:10:42] Revelation of Jesus Christ he knows that
[1:10:44] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:10:46] and
[1:10:47] forever Satan knows that the original
[1:10:50] church at Pentecost with the power of
[1:10:52] God Mark 16 in action is the true church
[1:10:55] that Jesus claims as his own amen yes
[1:11:00] thank you some Wish It Was Written like
[1:11:02] this Satan knows that assuredly that the
[1:11:05] Messi's church with all the revelations
[1:11:07] and no power in the church is the true
[1:11:16] church Listen to What a prophet is
[1:11:18] telling you Satan knows Satan knows that
[1:11:21] the original Church of Pentecost for the
[1:11:23] the power of God Mark 16 in action is
[1:11:26] the true church that Jesus claims as his
[1:11:30] own all else
[1:11:33] is it has to be amen now this is where I
[1:11:37] got this continuation from now remember
[1:11:40] this Christ in the true church is a
[1:11:44] continuation of the book of Acts amen
[1:11:47] continuation is not start
[1:11:49] over continue means
