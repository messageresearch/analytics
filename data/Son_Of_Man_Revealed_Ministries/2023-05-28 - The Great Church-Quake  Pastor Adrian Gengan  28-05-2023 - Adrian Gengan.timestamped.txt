[6:10] them every with all we pray Lord for
[6:13] that back pain to cease in the mighty

[6:16] authority and the faith of the Son of
[6:18] God in the mighty name of Jesus and I
[6:20] pray every sickness will have to leave
[6:22] every disease is gone in the mighty name
[6:24] of Jesus and we're speaking according to
[6:27] the revelation of our faith
[6:39] amen amen so the Lord has been doing
[6:43] wonderful things amongst us amen we were
[6:46] grateful amen those of you that to
[6:47] connect with us over the last three days
[6:48] amen you know it was the time of Shabbat
[6:51] and it was a great time amen we could
[6:54] just sense his presence even moving
[6:55] through that fourth dimension you may
[6:58] have heard of the testimonies or many
[6:59] healings that have taken place amen
[7:01] hallelujah and when you walk in the
[7:03] dwelling of Faith the supernatural
[7:05] becomes a normal thing a daily
[7:07] occurrence in our lives healings become
[7:09] a daily occur so we're not shaken we are
[7:12] not moved by the experiences we are
[7:14] standing on the word amen amen we don't
[7:17] place the experiences above the world
[7:19] it's because of the word that we are
[7:21] having these experiences because Faith
[7:23] covered by the hearing of the word amen
[7:25] so nothing will shake our faith in the
[7:26] word yes amen the prophet says if you
[7:29] experience
[7:30] whatever Revelation you had whatever
[7:33] experience even if an angel comes the
[7:35] pro the Apostle Paul says it says let
[7:37] him be a curse nothing comes above the
[7:40] word amen amen so if your experience
[7:42] don't match the word he says rather
[7:44] leave your experience alone remember
[7:46] some woman came to him and said oh the
[7:47] Lord met me and he told me I must go and
[7:49] preach he says yes I don't doubt you
[7:51] what experience you had but if you don't
[7:53] land up with the word then leave it
[7:55] alone amen amen so no matter what goes
[7:59] on in our lives always bring it back to
[8:01] the word amen amen
[8:03] start to confess a positive confession
[8:05] yes start to thank the Lord for it amen
[8:08] start to change the way we speak instead
[8:11] of praying and saying Lord Heal this
[8:13] person Lord touch that person start to
[8:15] change our language say thank you for
[8:16] healing that person amen thank you for
[8:19] healing them because healing is a
[8:20] finished work yes
[8:22] and Heaven has got to respond amen amen
[8:25] amen amen hallelujah amen listen to
[8:28] Matthew chapter 28 and verse 2.
[8:31] glory be to his name amen amen so
[8:34] remember this evening there will be a
[8:36] combined meeting a fellowship with all
[8:39] the Believers in Durban amen so we look
[8:41] forward to that time remember the Holy
[8:43] Spirit does not bring division amen amen
[8:46] so if there's a thought in your mind to
[8:49] bring division do not attend that's not
[8:52] the holy spirit amen the holy spirit is
[8:54] one that brings reconciliation the holy
[8:57] spirit is gathers everyone he brings
[8:58] them into one mind and one Accord amen
[9:01] so come expecting a blessing and you
[9:03] most certainly will be blessed amen
[9:05] without a shadow of the doubt I believe
[9:07] you will be blessed amen
[9:10] amen so this morning I'm going to be
[9:13] speaking I didn't finish my message last
[9:15] week so I'll continue on that thought
[9:17] because I believe some still need to
[9:19] catch it but also need to settle you
[9:21] into what Authority and power you have
[9:24] in this hour amen amen
[9:27] because it's really
[9:28] when the power and authority can be
[9:31] Unleashed in your life
[9:32] that's when Satan becomes powerless when
[9:35] you have a revelation of who you are
[9:37] amen so this morning I'm going to
[9:40] entitle it
[9:41] the great church quick
[9:45] amen amen
[9:48] you are the great church Queen
[9:52] before the great earthquake
[9:54] God's gonna shake the Earth
[9:57] like he did at Pentecost
[10:00] man I know you're still building your
[10:01] faith
[10:02] I know some of you can't say Amen right
[10:04] now because you can't see yourself as a
[10:06] church Quaker amen you know you know you
[10:10] get different levels of earthquakes
[10:13] maybe your level right now is one don't
[10:16] do much damage but I pray the faith and
[10:18] the Holy Spirit will come into your life
[10:20] you'll be a church Queen amen amen amen
[10:24] you'll measure high on the Richter scale
[10:26] amen causing division in Satan's kingdom
[10:29] tearing down amen so the great church
[10:32] quick amen hallelujah Matthews 28 and
[10:35] verse 2.
[10:37] praise the Lord
[10:38] amen everyone can hear me yeah amen I
[10:41] feel like somebody in the back can't
[10:42] hear me amen I want the neighbors to
[10:45] hear me even
[10:46] I want the Devils to hear me amen
[10:48] hallelujah some of them ran out the door
[10:50] they're sitting in the corner waiting
[10:52] for you to come back in the car but I
[10:53] need them to hear me this morning
[10:56] amen hallelujah and behold there was a
[11:00] great earthquake this is not talking
[11:01] about Jesus they put him in a tomb
[11:05] amen they try and put you in a
[11:07] denominational tomb try and put you in a
[11:09] message Tom saying stay there
[11:12] but the third day has come
[11:15] for the resurrection of the church
[11:17] time for the resurrection of the groom
[11:19] what happens when Jesus resurrects there
[11:22] was a great earthquake who caused the
[11:25] earthquake the Bible says for the angel
[11:27] of the Lord descended from Heaven amen
[11:29] as he descended now has he formed an
[11:33] alliance with us as he formed a
[11:35] partnership then there must be an
[11:37] earthquake amen amen
[11:40] and came and rolled back the Stone from
[11:42] the door and he sat upon it he possessed
[11:45] it amen he rolls the stone and he sits
[11:47] upon it amen so we see at the
[11:50] resurrection of the groom there was a
[11:53] great shaking
[11:55] amen let's turn to Acts chapter 2.
[11:59] now Jesus was in the Tomb for three days
[12:03] and on the third day there was a great
[12:05] earthquake
[12:06] Shabbat lasts for three days
[12:09] hmm the Feast of Pentecost lasts for
[12:12] three days
[12:13] and the Bible says when the day of
[12:15] Pentecost was fully come
[12:17] so after three days
[12:20] everyone following the thought they
[12:22] would
[12:23] one Accord in one place amen and
[12:26] suddenly

[12:37] and change things up yeah
[12:39] he comes suddenly isn't he going to come
[12:42] suddenly like a thief in the night so
[12:44] who is this the same one suddenly they
[12:47] came a sound from Heaven amen as of a
[12:50] rushing Mighty Wind
[12:52] amen May that Russian wind blow this
[12:54] morning amen
[12:56] and it filled up
[12:58] very first son

[13:07] unfilled It's Gonna Fill all the house
[13:09] where they were sitting amen
[13:13] and they appeared unto them proven times
[13:16] like as a fire
[13:17] a many many men let fire burn up all our
[13:21] filthy language
[13:22] amen hallelujah get rid of that worldly
[13:26] tongue that swearing tongue and put the
[13:28] new tongue within you amen put the word
[13:31] of God within you amen you'll be
[13:33] surprised how many Christians swear even
[13:36] in the message
[13:37] make them angry yo they can talk
[13:39] languages
[13:41] amen even you don't know what language
[13:43] that is
[13:45] but while the language Amen Let the Fire
[13:48] of God come upon your town this morning
[13:50] say change my words oh God maybe you're
[13:53] only speaking negativity but let the
[13:55] fire of God come and speak positive
[13:57] things through your lips amen amen my
[14:01] sickness and my disease and my this and
[14:04] my unemployment and my this amen
[14:06] hallelujah you are exalting the devil
[14:09] that's right
[14:10] and it's set upon each one of them
[14:13] amen so they had to be in one mind one
[14:16] Accord and in one place it's set upon
[14:18] each of them and they were all filled
[14:20] with the Holy Ghost there it is again
[14:22] all filled and they begin to speak with
[14:25] other tongues as the spirit gave them
[14:27] utterance amen amen one more portion of
[14:31] scripture
[14:32] now that was the first outpouring
[14:35] amen they go a few days later and now
[14:39] they catch Peter and John and they throw
[14:41] them into prison
[14:44] and they're making railing accusations
[14:46] against them and they start to threaten
[14:48] the church
[14:49] this is the first time they are
[14:51] threatened
[14:52] now this is unknown experience to them
[14:54] because they were not thrown in prison
[14:56] before and you know when you threaten
[14:58] your life you start to wonder what's
[15:00] gonna happen
[15:02] these are new experiences for the church
[15:05] so they began to call upon the name of
[15:07] the Lord after these people release them
[15:10] and they begin to call on the name of
[15:12] the Lord and you'll read from verse 29
[15:14] now it says and now Lord behold they are
[15:17] threatenings and Grant them to thy
[15:19] servants that will all boneless they may
[15:22] speak Thy Word
[15:24] situations will arise in your life that
[15:26] may try to silence your voice
[15:29] but pray for boldness Amen to speak in
[15:32] the midst of sickness to speak in the
[15:34] midst of trial
[15:36] amen you may be speaking from your dead
[15:39] bed sometimes but you got to speak the
[15:42] word
[15:43] amen what boldness amen
[15:45] how now if the first church prayed this
[15:48] way I don't know why people have changed
[15:50] praying this way hey yes
[15:52] you know we don't look for signs upon
[15:55] this we don't
[15:58] look at how they are praying how does
[16:00] you want them to speak to move by
[16:02] stretching forth and hand to heal
[16:06] yes
[16:08] are we another book of Acts amen are we
[16:11] another Pentecost
[16:12] learn how to pray Lord stretch forth
[16:15] your hand to heal amen
[16:17] amen that signs and wonders may be done
[16:19] by the name of thy holy Child Jesus amen
[16:24] some say they don't want it they openly
[16:26] preach it we're not looking for those
[16:28] things so you'll never see it amen amen
[16:30] some say we have the opening of the
[16:33] world we're not looking for these things
[16:34] amen when it's the power release to the
[16:37] church it's a power to shut the mouth of
[16:39] Satan it's a power to heal the sick
[16:41] raise the dead and show the supernatural
[16:43] power of God Amen
[16:46] didn't Mark 16 say these signs shall
[16:48] follow them that believe believe what
[16:50] believe the word amen so if we truly
[16:52] believe the word decides follow us
[16:56] so watch how they pray Lord stretch
[16:58] forth and to heal that signs and wonders
[17:00] may be done by the name of thy only
[17:02] child now if this is the unreasonable
[17:05] request the Holy Ghost won't fall but
[17:06] look what happens
[17:08] and when they are prayed the place was
[17:10] shaken amen
[17:12] where they were assembled together yeah
[17:14] yes another are pouring amen amen this
[17:17] is now not in the upper room
[17:19] they release a prison they gather
[17:20] together again the Holy Ghost can refill
[17:23] you amen amen you've got the same ones
[17:25] that were in the upper room and the
[17:27] place was shaken where they were
[17:28] assembled together and they were all
[17:31] filled with the Holy Ghost
[17:33] you can be refilled as much as you need
[17:37] amen such as we have Divine unto thee in
[17:41] the name of Jesus be filled with the
[17:42] Holy Ghost
[17:45] and they began to speak the word of God
[17:47] with boldness amen you may be seated
[17:50] amen
[17:52] Hallelujah
[17:54] amen the great church quake
[17:56] going on right now
[17:58] you may be saying oh I don't feel a
[18:00] church quick
[18:01] amen you need to in order to feel the
[18:04] church quick you got to get into the
[18:06] spirit
[18:07] amen hallelujah amen if you want to be a
[18:10] part of the church quick you've got to
[18:12] get into the spirit amen amen amen die
[18:15] to the flesh yes we've been we've been
[18:17] preaching these things all through these
[18:18] months amen look at what month we are
[18:20] now at the end of the fifth month
[18:23] amen according to our Gregorian calendar
[18:25] but according to the Hebrew calendar
[18:28] it's the end of the third month
[18:30] why was Pentecost important after the
[18:33] first three months they had to bring the
[18:35] wheat Harvest and they had to bring the
[18:37] first fruits of that wheat Harvest and
[18:39] wave it amen it was the waving of the
[18:41] first fruits amen hallelujah in this
[18:44] year is their people amen whose life of
[18:47] his life who we can wave before the
[18:49] people and say this is that
[18:53] certainly have first fruits amen
[18:57] this is Pentecost
[18:59] not a denomination
[19:01] Pentecost means the whole outpouring of
[19:03] the Holy Ghost the prophet says this is
[19:06] that amen amen
[19:08] Hallelujah
[19:10] glory be to his name amen so we find
[19:12] amen if we look at the the Earthly
[19:16] meaning of what a earthquake is a
[19:18] natural meaning because you know the
[19:19] word church quick is a spin-off of the
[19:22] word earthquake
[19:23] amen what is an earthquake and what
[19:26] causes them earthquakes are a result of
[19:29] a sudden movement along Falls within the
[19:31] Earth
[19:33] they are dropping together of two plates
[19:35] but watch when a natural earthquake rubs
[19:39] together
[19:40] what it needs two plates
[19:44] it will lead to stored up elastic strain
[19:47] energy
[19:50] some of you already in the spirit you're
[19:53] not reading about earthquakes you're
[19:54] already finding yourself in a church
[19:56] quick
[19:57] amen it will listen
[20:00] but it takes two amen amen
[20:04] amen which propagate through the Earth
[20:06] and cause ground surface to shake
[20:11] because of a rubbing together of two
[20:13] plates internally Hallelujah
[20:16] according to the external manifestation
[20:18] amen amen hallelujah amen because of the
[20:22] ground surface to shake amen and may the
[20:25] Lord Shake us this morning amen if you
[20:27] are not being shaken then there's only
[20:29] one place being rubbed inside of you
[20:31] amen there's no movement inside of you
[20:34] earthquakes are caused because of a
[20:36] movement within the Earth
[20:39] amen so before amen we what does an
[20:42] earthquake does it causes Devastation it
[20:45] causes annihilation of everything around
[20:47] it but in this church quick we are
[20:50] causing Devastation we are bringing a
[20:52] violation to the kingdom of Satan yes
[20:55] amen hallelujah so we find we read that
[20:58] the Earth Shook and quit at the
[21:00] resurrection of the Son of God the Earth
[21:02] shook again after three days when they
[21:04] were gathered together in the upper room
[21:07] amen amen hallelujah blessed be his name
[21:11] amen
[21:12] Hallelujah let's go to that first slide
[21:15] there in the Saudi interest money in
[21:16] church age he's talking about Jesus he
[21:19] says Darkness Came Upon the Earth they
[21:21] put him in the Tomb they lay those three
[21:23] days and nights until an earthquake
[21:25] shatter the Gloom of night and he came
[21:27] forth
[21:29] they lay those three days a night until
[21:32] this Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended

[24:49] now live in the flesh I live by the
[24:51] faith of the Son of God Amen
[24:54] amen
[24:55] difference now
[24:58] not faith in the son of God
[25:03] you're going to catch Mark 11 23 now
[25:08] when Jesus starts there by saying have
[25:10] faith in God
[25:12] the the real meaning of that
[25:16] is that the faith of God
[25:21] hello amen please catch us now amen we
[25:24] had another time another season yes this
[25:27] is third pool season amen yes amen I
[25:31] live by the faith of the Son of God yes
[25:33] you are not living by the faith of
[25:35] Ramesh of Joshua of Sunny of submission
[25:37] of Caleb
[25:40] hmm yes who's living in you amen
[25:44] hallelujah it's Christ Living in you
[25:47] the life which I now live in the flesh
[25:50] is still in the flesh I live by the
[25:53] faith of the Son of God amen amen
[25:56] amen
[25:58] that is why in Mark 11 23 when he says
[26:01] have the faith of the Son of God he says
[26:03] if you say to the mountain
[26:05] because when the sun spoke
[26:08] the literal son Jesus
[26:11] everything you have to obey
[26:13] so if you speak by the faith of the Son
[26:16] of God everything must obey amen yes
[26:20] there's no two ways about it Jesus says
[26:22] if you don't doubt in your heart but
[26:24] believe what you have said yeah
[26:26] yes
[26:27] Hallelujah yes did Jesus say when you
[26:31] pray
[26:31] in Mark 11 23.
[26:36] what is that scripture put it at Mark 11
[26:37] 23.
[26:39] did he say when you pray or when you say
[26:46] I'm if you think pray and say is the
[26:48] same word
[26:52] um if you think pray and say is the same
[26:54] word
[26:55] if you know English it's not the same
[26:57] word
[26:59] Jesus does not come in Mark 11 23 and
[27:02] say when you pray
[27:07] when you say Amen
[27:09] amen
[27:11] too many times all we do is go to Mark
[27:15] 11 24 because we don't have the faith of
[27:18] the son of God
[27:23] I mean if you want to live in that
[27:24] anointing that's super Faith amen then
[27:28] this is the key now Galatians 2 20 and
[27:31] Mark 11 23 goes together
[27:33] amen go up 20 I think it is oh yeah
[27:37] maybe you did go there
[27:40] one more
[27:42] have faith in God now if you go back to

[29:40] you know the human is so negative it
[29:43] always wants to pamper the Flesh and

[39:26] move
[39:29] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that
[39:31] the spirits are subject unto you but
[39:34] Rejoice rather because your names are
[39:36] written in heaven amen amen in what time
[39:40] and in what season did the book come
[39:42] down to reveal the names that were
[39:44] written in the book amen
[39:46] these disciples could not see amen that
[39:49] the seals were open yeah
[39:51] yeah yes
[39:53] some of you are catching it right now
[39:55] amen
[39:57] yeah Jesus is telling them Rejoice that
[39:59] your names are written in heaven amen
[40:01] but the name the opening of the book the
[40:04] title deed of man's Redemption only came
[40:07] down in Revelation 10.
[40:10] amen so only an end time people who's
[40:13] taking the book with all seals thrown
[40:16] off
[40:17] can now read the names back in the
[40:19] family album and he says Rejoice because
[40:21] your names are written in the Lamb's
[40:23] Book of Life
[40:25] yes amen so Satan is powerless before
[40:28] you you know why I'm saying that Satan
[40:31] wants you to be like the most high god
[40:33] what is God like he's a Creator but but
[40:36] Satan can't be a Creator Satan is a
[40:39] perverter Satan is the story of true
[40:42] Satan is a corrupture yes the word devil
[40:45] means Tormentor
[40:47] amen Satan is an impersonating nature
[40:49] but he cannot create
[40:51] he waits for God to do something then he
[40:54] impersonates it
[40:56] Satan is like China
[41:03] amen they wait for the technology then
[41:06] they impersonate the technology but is
[41:09] Chinese Goods as effective as the
[41:10] original
[41:12] no
[41:15] there's nothing can beat the original
[41:17] yeah and the spoken word is the Original
[41:20] Seed amen if you say Amen
[41:25] spoken word is the Original Seed
[41:28] amen so what he say to now
[41:32] he was lasting after to be like God
[41:34] didn't he say I want to be like the most
[41:36] like God he wants to be a creator
[41:39] he wants to have creative power in his
[41:41] mouth
[41:43] but God Made You and I in His image and
[41:47] I am a true God so Satan is going into a
[41:50] meltdown he's having a fit how come you
[41:52] can be like God and he can't yeah
[41:56] even with his all his impersonation God
[41:59] Made You In His Image and his likeness
[42:01] so he comes and he's curious now in the
[42:03] garden let me see the sandwich of God
[42:05] who is higher than me
[42:09] let me see this amateur God In the
[42:11] Garden of Eden
[42:13] so what he starts to do Satan can only
[42:15] deceive
[42:17] he starts to deceive Eve
[42:19] makes us fall away from the word amen so
[42:23] he desire to be like God but God Made
[42:25] You and I in His image and right there I
[42:27] want you to give God praise right now
[42:28] and receive it amen clap your hands yeah
[42:33] maybe you didn't understand the point
[42:35] but you're an amateur God the prophet
[42:37] says you have enough power in your mouth
[42:39] to speak another world into existence
[42:41] Satan would love that power yeah
[42:47] but Satan cannot create
[42:52] but you can create
[42:54] amen
[42:55] so what the best you can do right now is
[42:57] deceive but the word says now listen to
[42:59] how the world is already there
[43:01] what's the best healing can do deceive
[43:04] but the word says the election not be
[43:06] deceived amen Satan it is written
[43:10] amen hallelujah amen he tries to bring
[43:14] amen fear condemnation reasoning but the
[43:17] Lord is will be released or free to us
[43:19] in this hour amen that breaks every
[43:22] chain of the enemy destroys the works of
[43:25] the enemy what is doing here the faith
[43:28] of this hour
[43:30] amen he brings sickness to the body
[43:33] thinking he can make a doubt in reason
[43:35] thinking we will forsake God Amen but
[43:39] there's a word already released by his
[43:41] Funtime here Satan he disrespected
[43:44] amen come back to the word amen it's
[43:48] also written if you lay hands upon the
[43:50] sick they shall recover brother you know
[43:52] that's a Jewish tradition shut up
[43:55] Bible
[43:57] if you land upon the sick they shall
[43:59] recover yes let me lay my hands upon you
[44:02] and cast that demon off of you you're

[1:06:32] idle and fall prostrate over it of an
[1:06:34] imaginary God and believe that an
[1:06:37] imaginary voice spoke to them that he
[1:06:40] hypnotized himself into an idol
[1:06:42] I hope you don't think you're speaking
[1:06:44] to an imaginary God he says what a
[1:06:46] strange thing it is for the devil to do

[1:06:51] is a spirit that he does not come into

[1:06:56] beings and speaks his own words through
[1:06:59] the man amen

[1:07:24] and speaks his own words through the man

[1:09:52] so yeah the prophet is telling us
[1:09:55] we read Luke chapter 10 verse 19 right
[1:09:59] how we gave them Authority power but
[1:10:01] then they came a dumb a man with
[1:10:03] epileptic boy and they couldn't cast The
[1:10:05] Demon out
[1:10:07] so yeah the property speaking these
[1:10:09] things and he says they could do it
[1:10:12] he gave them the power he says ten days
[1:10:14] later they couldn't cast The Demon out
[1:10:16] he says why couldn't we do it why am I
[1:10:19] reading this learn from it
[1:10:21] maybe you've been praying over a
[1:10:22] situation
[1:10:23] learn from it
[1:10:26] did he say I took my power back from you
[1:10:28] has he taken his power off of you stay
[1:10:32] with me now has he taken his power off
[1:10:34] of you no no
[1:10:36] when God gives you anything that's
[1:10:39] forever amen
[1:10:41] he didn't take it
[1:10:43] so when you pray that you see something
[1:10:45] not happen he didn't take his power from
[1:10:48] you
[1:10:49] yeah
[1:10:50] I can show you where God gave the church
[1:10:52] power to heal the sick now you show me
[1:10:55] in the scriptures where he took it away
[1:10:56] from the church

[1:11:00] it isn't there when God does anything
[1:11:02] it's Eternal when he give you eternal
[1:11:05] life that's forever Grim not the holy
[1:11:07] spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[1:11:09] until the day of your Redemption
[1:11:12] um it was because of what your unbelief
[1:11:15] the reason you wouldn't cast him out
[1:11:17] because you didn't believe not because
[1:11:20] you didn't have power
[1:11:23] now to your Methodist lutherans Baptists
[1:11:26] Presbyterians message people the reason
[1:11:28] you don't do these things in your church
[1:11:30] it isn't because you don't have the
[1:11:32] power it's because you don't believe it
[1:11:34] yes
[1:11:35] that's all just because you don't
[1:11:37] believe it if you don't believe it the
[1:11:39] same thing would happen
