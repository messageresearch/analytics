[7:46] marriage of the lamb and the bride's
[7:50] responsibility amen so we know that the
[7:53] bride the marriage of the Lamb is not
[7:55] something that
[7:56] happened after the Rapture amen it's
[7:59] taking place right now amen under the
[8:02] shout
[8:03] amen Revelation 10:1 says and I saw
[8:06] another Mighty Angel come down from
[8:08] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[8:10] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[8:14] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[8:17] pullet of fire and he had in his hand a
[8:19] little book open and he set his right
[8:22] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[8:24] the earth and cried with a loud voice as
[8:28] when a lion Ro it and when he cried
[8:31] seven Thunders utter their voices we
[8:34] know that the mighty angel coming down
[8:36] with an open book he come with a
[8:37] three-fold purpose that is a shout a
[8:40] voice and a trump amen as he's
[8:42] descending is doing all three things
[8:44] amen and the shout is what to gather the
[8:47] living Saints amen amen to to to to what
[8:51] to put you into the secret place amen
[8:54] this great secret amen that the world
[8:56] knows nothing about that is an invisible
[8:58] Union that been taking place amen what
[9:01] it was that this prophet of God had to
[9:03] wait on the earth till till he receive
[9:06] the message and the message was what a
[9:08] message was for a bride amen amen yes
[9:11] amen and while he was called from 1946
[9:14] to God in the field he was busy fishing
[9:17] amen and under the first two pool he
[9:19] fishing but he was fishing for that for
[9:21] that third pool for that rainbow trout
[9:23] amen but he had to wait for a message
[9:25] amen and the message comes down in 1963
[9:28] amen and this message amen that is
[9:31] preaching to Pentecostal babes was Tau
[9:33] up in books and tapes because it was the
[9:35] Holy Ghost that was going to run this
[9:37] Trail again and it was the Holy Ghost
[9:39] that is going to take this message
[9:41] around the world and it was the Holy
[9:42] Ghost that going to pick you and I going
[9:45] to pick people in different parts of the
[9:46] Earth in different kindreds and tongues
[9:48] in different nations and going to bring
[9:51] this Holy Ghost message to them and they
[9:53] are going to identify with his message
[9:55] because they have representation within
[9:57] them amen within them lies the Gen of
[10:00] God Amen and when the word strikes there
[10:02] amen when light comes and Strikes the
[10:04] Gen oh it steps forth into life
[10:08] amen hallelujah thank you Jesus but
[10:10] where were you lying for all these years
[10:13] you are lying in denominational Graves
[10:15] amen amen amen but in the rising of the
[10:18] S amen amen this St body this cold body
[10:23] the sty body that was dead in
[10:25] denominational Graves had to step forth
[10:28] into life am amen
[10:33] amen so we know that the marriage of the
[10:36] Lamb is the most one of the most
[10:38] glorious event in the history of
[10:41] redemption Amen in the entire God's Plan
[10:43] of Redemption this is a glorious event
[10:47] amen this is the union of Christ and his
[10:50] bride yes amen the elect who have been
[10:54] called out Chosen and sealed in this day
[10:57] amen
[11:00] this is not an event to
[11:02] come but a reality not to come in the
[11:05] future now it's a reality that's
[11:07] unfolding right now where this Union
[11:11] where he said father may they be one
[11:14] even as we are one amen this Oneness is
[11:17] taking place right now this Oneness is
[11:20] where Christ now has moved away from a
[11:24] oneman Ministry he's moved now in bright
[11:27] form amen he's walking once again in you
[11:30] and I he's working once again in a many
[11:33] member body that's why it was time where
[11:36] he said John 42 y shall do the Greater
[11:39] Works that was stored up for the bride
[11:44] amen so we know that they all this was
[11:47] spoken of but they had to be a bride
[11:49] amen because why for the next we know
[11:54] that the wedding supper takes place in
[11:55] the sky but yeah is where the marriage
[11:58] takes place amen
[11:59] yeah is where the union takes place amen
[12:02] that's why many he said many will come
[12:04] to me in the days said Lord have I not
[12:06] prophesied in your name I have not done
[12:08] this in your name but he said depart
[12:10] from me workers of iniquity I never knew
[12:13] you not amen they did not come into a
[12:24] union he says and that we know there's
[12:27] going to be a BRI there's going to be a
[12:30] wedding supper served in the skies just
[12:34] that's just as sure to be as God is
[12:37] because it's his word and we know that
[12:39] those that are going to make up that
[12:41] bride is going to be his church amen and
[12:46] they going to appear before him without
[12:49] spot or
[12:51] wrinkle and they have the material on
[12:54] earth
[12:56] now to make themselves ready
[13:00] if you notice it said she has made
[13:03] herself
[13:05] ready now we know that when Adam and Eve
[13:09] sinned the glory of God departed from
[13:12] them and they were seen to be naked amen
[13:16] but before that before the sin comes in
[13:19] they were
[13:20] clothed amen not with Earthly clothing
[13:24] as you think but with the glory of God
[13:26] amen amen and just like them
[13:30] that the Bible speaks about the souls
[13:33] under the altar that they were given
[13:35] robes they are to be given robes but
[13:38] blessed are they that come under the
[13:40] first
[13:41] resurrection amen the rest of the day
[13:44] don't come up in the first resurrection
[13:46] amen when there's going to be a
[13:48] resurrection now that is those that are
[13:51] in Christ will come up amen that means
[13:54] those that are in the union those that
[13:56] make up the bride from Seven Church ages
[13:59] right until now they will come up in his
[14:01] resurrection not the rest of the dead
[14:04] because he said blessed are those that
[14:07] come up in the first resurrection the
[14:09] rest of the Dead comes up in the second
[14:10] Resurrection amen but those that come up
[14:13] in the first resurrection already have
[14:16] The Robe Hallelujah the rest of the Dead
[14:19] they were chosen they were given robes
[14:22] amen you find that many came out of
[14:24] tribulation they were given robes even
[14:26] the souls on were given robes but you
[14:29] already in yeah right now when you come
[14:31] under the union you've already given the
[14:34] wedding robe amen which is the Holy
[14:37] Ghost amen which is the righteousness of
[14:40] the
[14:40] Saints which is what his word has come
[14:44] to clothe you amen the message of the
[14:46] hour the Holy Ghost message has come to
[14:48] clothe you in this
[14:50] hour thank you
[14:54] Lord so we find that those that will
[14:56] come up in the first resurrection are
[14:59] those that died in Christ or are all
[15:01] part of the union or part of the
[15:02] marriage Union amen and then we which
[15:05] are alive and remain because we are
[15:07] being clothed right now amen clothed
[15:09] with his word amen we
[15:13] will have a body change amen
[15:21] amen so he says
[15:34] there going and he said we know that
[15:36] those that are going to make up the
[15:38] bride is going to be his church and they
[15:41] going to appear before him without spot
[15:43] and wrinkle and they have the materi on
[15:45] earth now to make themselves ready if
[15:47] you notice it said she has made herself
[15:49] ready so many says if the Lord will take
[15:52] this evil spirit from me from drinking
[15:55] or from gambling or from lying or
[15:57] stealing I'll serve him but that's up to
[16:00] you see you've got to do something
[16:03] too they that overcome shall inherit all
[16:08] things they that overcome you have power
[16:11] to do it but you must be willing to lay
[16:15] it down she has made herself
[16:18] ready I like that word you see God could
[16:22] not push us through a little pipe pull
[16:25] us out on the other's end and then
[16:27] saying blessed disas that
[16:30] overcometh you had nothing to overcome
[16:33] he just pushed you through but you've
[16:36] got to make decisions for yourself amen
[16:40] amen he made us free modal agents amen I
[16:43] have to make decisions for myself in
[16:46] doing that we show our faith and
[16:49] respects to God Abraham was promised a
[16:52] child but he must maintain his promise
[16:55] for 25 years the ups and downs that he
[16:59] had and Temptations in those 25 years
[17:02] but he held on to the word of the
[17:04] promise amen and Israel was promised a
[17:09] Promised Land but they had to fight for
[17:12] every inch of
[17:14] it wherever The Souls of your foot
[17:17] Treads upon that have I given you God
[17:21] said to Joshua it was all there the land
[17:24] was there and God gave it to him but
[17:26] they must fight for it amen
[17:29] the same way it is about Divine Healing
[17:31] God has got the power to heal you if you
[17:33] got the courage to accept it but you
[17:35] have to fight every inch of the way amen
[17:39] so amen he's given us the overcoming
[17:41] he's anointed us with an anointing to
[17:43] overcome every UNL of the devil in this
[17:46] day amen every attack of the enemy in
[17:49] his day but he said all we are Co with
[17:52] Christ he's given us his inheritance
[17:55] amen we are partakers of his inheritance
[17:58] but but you got to fight every inch of
[18:00] the way amen how do you fight you got to
[18:02] keep in your position you got to
[18:04] recognize who you are you got to
[18:06] recognize what the word says about you
[18:09] you got to recognize that you wrestle
[18:11] not against flesh and blood you don't
[18:13] fight the devil with flesh and blood you
[18:15] fight him with spirit in in spiritual
[18:18] warfare
[18:19] amen thank you Lord amen the Bible say
[18:22] with prayers and supplication
[18:29] so we know that the marriage of the Lamb
[18:30] it's a Divine Union right so now in this
[18:35] Union many it's not meant for
[18:38] everybody we know Matthew 25 speaks
[18:40] about the V wise virgin and the foolish
[18:43] virgins amen but those that were shut up
[18:48] with him they were in a union in a
[18:49] secret Union so many will come and say
[18:52] oh but I'm glad I can shout I can sing I
[18:55] can dance I can enjoy all this healing
[18:58] and enjoy all his benefits but they
[19:00] wouldn't accept all the
[19:01] word this is the ones that love the word
[19:05] this is the ones wants to come in
[19:07] completeness of the word you want all of
[19:09] the word we don't want some of the word
[19:11] we want all of the
[19:13] word amen you have an appetite all the
[19:16] time you have a craving within you and
[19:19] all the time the devil was trying to
[19:21] satisfy that
[19:23] thirst amen until you come to draw and
[19:26] drink from this inexhaustible fountain
[19:28] of life amen until you come to to drink
[19:31] from this Fountain of Living Waters yes
[19:34] Lord amen and when you and what happened
[19:36] you began to have a holy man's taste you
[19:39] began to put on a thinking man's filter
[19:42] your taste bus began to change once you
[19:44] walk like the people of the world
[19:46] lasting after the things of the Flesh
[19:48] and all the things that the people of
[19:50] the world seek after but when you came
[19:52] into realization of who you truly are
[19:55] when you come to the knowledge of the
[19:56] truth of who you truly are and what God
[19:59] purpose for you are then you begin to
[20:01] realize I'm not like every other person
[20:03] there's something different about me
[20:05] because why and I coming now I have I am
[20:08] called to come into the union with
[20:10] Christ amen I am the bride of Christ
[20:14] don't you know that is the same bride
[20:17] don't you know the the the bride she's
[20:19] going to judge the
[20:21] Earth yes all the people that's claiming
[20:24] to have all the the things of the world
[20:27] and claiming to have land and TR and so
[20:29] forth but it's the bride that's going to
[20:31] judge the Earth that's
[20:32] right the only difference is the Earth
[20:36] at the moment is not a f dwelling place
[20:38] for you to dwell in yes that is why he
[20:41] has to renovate the Earth before you
[20:42] come and dwell in it amen it's going to
[20:44] renovated just for you amen he's going
[20:47] to make it a foot dwelling place for you
[20:50] he's going to bring it back to Eden
[20:51] again
[21:02] so we find
[21:03] that Paul is saying in 2 Corinthians 11
[21:06] to for I am jealous over you with a
[21:09] Godly jealousy for I espouse you to one
[21:12] husband that I may present you a Chase
[21:14] virgin to
[21:16] Christ now Paul is already saying that
[21:18] because he can see what was starting in
[21:19] the church and then we know what
[21:21] happened after
[21:24] that but we know that God always had a
[21:26] little group of people through all all
[21:28] the ages though Satan was trying
[21:32] to to to to copy what God did and bring
[21:35] his own
[21:36] church God is still got a selected group
[21:39] of people in every age who is making up
[21:42] the body which is making up the bride
[21:44] amen but we find that this bride is from
[21:49] all the bloodlines on the earth she was
[21:51] she is the most purest and cleanest
[21:53] blood light on the earth because why
[21:55] she's washed with the blood of the Lamb
[21:57] amen is Justified she never sin in the
[22:00] first place
[22:07] amen but she's
[22:10] got a responsibility
[22:13] amen there's a responsibility upon her
[22:16] let's see what the prophet says about
[22:26] that and then invisible un say now
[22:29] notice she has a sacred Trust of
[22:32] virtue that's been given her trusted to
[22:36] her by the Lord God gave her that virtue
[22:41] and just as it was in the Garden of Eden
[22:44] she can say yes or no she has a sacred
[22:47] Trust of Womanhood committed to her that
[22:50] she must not break the Womanhood I'm
[22:53] speaking of is a conduct a character
[22:56] around men now now he's speaking here
[23:00] he's going to Propet going to take you
[23:01] to the Natural side and the spiritual
[23:03] side on the spiritual side we know what
[23:06] he's talking about not to go into any
[23:08] man-made system or any man-made dogmas
[23:11] and Creeds amen but to remain faithful
[23:14] to the word because the bridegroom is
[23:17] the word and she loves nothing else but
[23:19] the word but when she's venturing out
[23:22] into the world and out of the world then
[23:25] what she's doing now she's breaking that
[23:27] sacred trust amen
[23:29] amen but he's calling her now to because
[23:32] she's committed it's a responsibility
[23:34] that when his word is given to her she
[23:36] has a sacred
[23:37] responsibility amen that she's got to be
[23:40] faithful to the word amen she's got to
[23:43] display the word she's got to operate
[23:46] under the same word amen that he was
[23:48] operating under and she's got to
[23:50] manifest
[23:51] him amen because she is going to bear
[23:55] for Christ amen amen she was she had to
[23:59] have a virgin home amen and she had to
[24:03] take this unadulterated word and receive
[24:05] of it and say like Mary beat unto me
[24:08] according to th word and then she had to
[24:10] reproduce Jesus Christ amen it had to be
[24:13] nothing less than Jesus Christ again on
[24:17] display
[24:20] amen he says what a sacred trust what a
[24:24] responsibility to a woman now see while
[24:27] she's a type of the Church which has the
[24:29] same
[24:30] responsibility as a woman has a sacred
[24:32] responsibility to her motherhood to her
[24:35] virtues to a husband the church has a
[24:38] sacred responsibility to prayer and to
[24:42] word and to Christ just the same as the
[24:46] woman has amen so our dedication to the
[24:50] things of God
[24:51] Amen because why this word has come to
[24:54] place us into our
[24:56] position yes amen
[25:03] amen because it brings
[25:11] us into a place where God can use us
[25:18] amen because if you didn't come under
[25:21] this word he couldn't use you he had to
[25:23] come bring you under this word and then
[25:26] bring you from call you for a total
[25:28] separation from all unbelief only when
[25:31] you come from a total separation from
[25:33] all unbelief and you believe only his
[25:36] word then he can bring you now into the
[25:37] land into the land of the Holy Ghost
[25:40] into this land of inheritance amen and
[25:43] then you can be placed in the land amen
[25:46] and when you are placed in the land then
[25:48] you're going to be fulfilling your
[25:50] responsibility of the body
[25:55] amen now we know that uh we when the
[25:59] when the wedding call went
[26:01] forth there was a budding being done
[26:03] amen Luke 14:15 speaks about it in Luke
[26:06] 14:15 it says and when one of them that
[26:09] sat at meet with him heard these things
[26:12] he said unto him blessed is he that
[26:14] shall eat bread in the kingdom of God
[26:16] then said he unto him a certain man made
[26:18] a great supper and made and bath many
[26:21] and sent his servant at supper time to
[26:24] say to them that were bden come for all
[26:27] things are already now and they are all
[26:30] with one consent began to make excuses
[26:33] excuse the first said unto him I have
[26:36] bought a piece of ground I must need go
[26:38] and see I pray the have me excused and
[26:42] another said and I have
[26:45] bought and I must and another said I
[26:48] have bought five yolk of oxen and I go
[26:51] to prove them I pray the have me excuse
[26:55] and another said I have married a wife
[26:58] and therefore I cannot come so that
[27:00] servant came and showed his Lord this
[27:02] thing then the master of the house being
[27:05] angry said to his
[27:06] servants go out quickly into the streets
[27:09] and Lanes of the city and bring in
[27:11] either the poor and the m and the alt
[27:14] and blind and the servant said Lord it
[27:17] is done as thou has commanded yet there
[27:19] is room and the Lord said unto the
[27:21] servant go out into the highways and
[27:23] edges and compel them to come in that my
[27:26] house may be fulfilled
[27:28] for I say unto you that none of those
[27:30] men which were burden shall Chase of my
[27:33] supper amen so those that
[27:37] rejected rejected this messenger's word
[27:40] amen will not taste of the supper amen
[27:43] Matthew 22 also bring the same
[27:45] illustration it says and Jesus answered
[27:47] and spake unto them again by Parable and
[27:49] saying the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[27:51] unto a certain King which made a
[27:53] marriage for his son and sent forth his
[27:55] servants to call them that were burden
[27:57] to the wedding and they would not come
[27:59] and again he sent forth other servants
[28:00] saying tell them which are burden behold
[28:02] I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my
[28:05] fatlings are killed and all things are
[28:07] already come unto the marriage but they
[28:09] made light of it and went their ways one
[28:11] to his farm another to his merchandise
[28:13] and the remnant took his servant and
[28:15] treated them spitefully and slew them
[28:18] but when the king heard thereof he was
[28:20] rought and he sent forth his armies and
[28:23] destroyed those murderers and burnt up
[28:25] their cities now we know to seven Church
[28:27] ages what happened each messenger was
[28:29] rejected amen as they was going out
[28:32] during the bedding for the wedding
[28:34] supper each messenger was rejected
[28:37] except the ones that were sealed away
[28:40] amen and he said destroyed the murders
[28:43] and burned up their city so we know
[28:46] eventually this city this Roman church
[28:49] amen this church this Babylonian system
[28:52] is going to be burnt up in an hour amen
[28:54] amen then said he to his servant the
[28:56] wedding is ready but they which were
[28:58] burden were not worthy go you therefore
[29:00] into the highways and as many as you
[29:02] shall find but to the marriage so the
[29:04] servants went out into the highways and
[29:06] gathered as many as they found both good
[29:09] both bad and good and the wedding was
[29:11] furnished with guest and when the king
[29:14] came in to see guest he saw there a man
[29:17] which had not a wedding garment and he
[29:19] said unto him friend how CEST thou in
[29:21] either not having a wedding garment and
[29:23] he was speechless then said the king to
[29:25] the servants buy any man and food and
[29:27] take away and casting into other doctors
[29:30] there shall be weeping and ning of teeth
[29:32] for many are called but few are chosen
[29:34] so see this one comes in with his own
[29:37] way coming to his own seminar coming to
[29:39] his own denominational system that
[29:41] doesn't work amen we got to come in the
[29:44] way the God has called us to the shout
[29:46] Amen to the message of the hour
[29:50] amen and we know the key to the age was
[29:52] the prophet amen he that received a
[29:54] prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[29:56] receive a prophet reward amen
[30:06] Ephesians
[30:07] 5277 says that he might present it to
[30:09] himself of a glorious church not having
[30:12] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[30:15] that it should be holy and without
[30:17] blemish amen so we find that we know
[30:21] that the prophet always told us that
[30:23] perfect faith is recognizing your
[30:25] position in the word amen and seeing
[30:28] this word being interpreted in your own
[30:30] life now we can see this we can we can
[30:35] recognize the word for somebody else but
[30:39] until we seeing the see the word being
[30:41] interpreted in our personal lives amen
[30:45] then we are not recognizing our position
[30:47] when Jesus came he took the scripture
[30:50] and he read the scripture that pertained
[30:52] to him when the prophet came he went up
[30:55] to Revelation 10 1-7 amen but he didn't
[30:58] go to tell Revelation 108 to1 because
[31:00] that was for another people amen but he
[31:03] knew that there was going to be a people
[31:05] that will come and receive this word
[31:08] that will take the book that will eat
[31:10] the book amen yes that will become one
[31:13] with the word amen that this word will
[31:16] be the makeup will become part of the
[31:18] word and then when we recognize
[31:22] that when we recognize when we see that
[31:25] word now being interpreted in our own
[31:27] life amen what we see that that
[31:29] scripture pertains to us we are coming
[31:31] to this Union with his with his
[31:33] bridegroom and we are in so much in love
[31:36] with him amen that every time we hearing
[31:38] about him his word we we have so much in
[31:41] love with his word we don't want to deny
[31:43] this word amen we want to accept every
[31:46] part of this word yes we want to live
[31:48] out this word amen amen amen and we love
[31:51] this word so much that we can't wait now
[31:53] to see
[31:54] him physically see him amen amen we know
[31:58] everyone is Will to physically see him
[32:00] but we are going to have that
[32:01] opportunity but right now he's here amen
[32:05] yes he's here in word form amen he's
[32:08] come to unite with us yes and when we
[32:11] are coming in Oneness with
[32:13] him amen that you you are now tied to
[32:17] self once you was a slave to sin you
[32:20] just change your Masters now amen amen
[32:23] amen but this master now he's got giv
[32:26] you eternal life amen amen
[32:28] this master is not holding you bondage
[32:30] this master is not accusing you this
[32:32] master is saying that you are sinless
[32:35] spotless bright this master is saying
[32:38] you a super Church you an invincible
[32:40] Army this master is saying you are a
[32:42] super race this master is saying I give
[32:45] you you are partakers of my inheritance
[32:47] you are partakers of my divine nature
[32:50] amen you are word of my Word Flesh of My
[32:53] Flesh amen thank you Lord thank you
[32:56] Jesus oh you have become my the my
[32:59] mouthpiece you are the final voice in
[33:02] the final age amen yes Lord that's what
[33:05] this m is saying but now you're saying I
[33:07] die to self so it's no longer the I that
[33:10] liveth but Christ that liveth in me so
[33:13] you become so much of part of him that
[33:17] now it's all Christ being displayed you
[33:19] surrender your own thoughts you
[33:21] surrender the eye WS your own thinking
[33:24] your own reasonings
[33:25] amen Because deep within you there the
[33:28] battle same like the the difference
[33:31] between AA and Sarah amen right within
[33:34] you there's a AA and a Sarah
[33:38] amen there's the born woman and the free
[33:41] woman amen amen but the free woman shall
[33:45] rule amen
[33:46] amen this the free woman is the one
[33:50] because in marriage there's a
[33:51] responsibility there's there's a
[33:53] something that takes place in
[33:55] marriage amen the bride takes the
[33:58] husband's
[34:00] name amen she's no longer under her own
[34:06] name she takes the husband name and she
[34:08] become one now what does the name speaks
[34:11] of a name speaks in a name it has
[34:16] identification in a name it has status
[34:20] in a name it Bears
[34:22] Authority amen so if you are taking on
[34:25] Christ's name you take take on his
[34:28] status you take on his identification
[34:32] you take on his authority amen that's
[34:35] why you are called Mrs Jesus Christ he
[34:39] said I not call you Mrs Jesus Christ
[34:44] amen and if he is the word then you must
[34:47] be the word yes amen thank you
[34:53] Lord he says in this message
[35:09] in the message marriage of the Lamb he
[35:13] says and that's the way the churches are
[35:16] too many today we just taking the name
[35:18] of Christian Church pretending to be the
[35:20] bride when it's artificial we not
[35:23] connected with Christ in any way we like
[35:25] an artificial toot artificial arm
[35:27] artificial ey see it's something that's
[35:29] artificial if we just putting it on well
[35:32] you can't put on Christianity you've got
[35:35] to be connected with
[35:36] it and then a church that just
[35:38] artificial called The Church of Christ
[35:41] well so what he trying to say you can
[35:43] have an artificial
[35:45] toot right if you don't have a toot you
[35:47] can put on an artificial toot that's
[35:48] fine but if but it's not connected to
[35:51] you right it's there to help you but
[35:54] it's not connected to you amen and said
[35:57] then a church that just artificial call
[35:59] the Church of Christ well them children
[36:01] then are not in there that's born of the
[36:04] same organization that's not Christ
[36:07] children they are denominational
[36:08] children not children of Christ if the
[36:11] woman isn't connected with the man in
[36:13] tress then they that then it isn't a
[36:16] husband he just a man that she's taken a
[36:19] vow to live with and she took a wrong
[36:22] vow she pledged to love him and she and
[36:25] she said she loved him and she didn't do
[36:27] it all the time the man is
[36:29] deceived but there's only but there's
[36:32] one thing sure friends we're not going
[36:35] to deceive Christ he knows his
[36:40] own amen that's why you always say you
[36:44] want to know if someone loves if truly
[36:46] in this word give them a word
[36:48] test then you'll see a different side of
[36:50] them you see a lot of people I love
[36:52] Jesus I love the things of God and they
[36:54] love to they will shout and sing and
[36:57] everything but give him the word chest
[36:59] tell him this is what the word says You
[37:00] must do come into the repentance be
[37:03] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:05] Christ the word s the prophet in his day
[37:07] this is what the word says our woman
[37:09] should behave there should be no woman
[37:11] preachers all these things give them the
[37:13] wordes and then you'll see whether they
[37:16] truly love
[37:17] Christ if the woman so you'll know that
[37:20] they not connected with Christ amen if
[37:22] they're not connected with the
[37:26] word his pledge to love him and he said
[37:29] but
[37:30] the but you see first decisions he said
[37:34] he's talking about in a marriage now
[37:36] first decisions are made the next is the
[37:40] engagement and then is the
[37:43] promise amen so you make a decision that
[37:46] you want to serve Christ
[37:49] amen you have to make this decision on
[37:51] your
[37:52] own this decision nobody can force you
[37:56] this has to be a personal decision amen
[37:59] if you are coming to church because your
[38:03] wife is coming to church then there's a
[38:05] problem you haven't sincerely made that
[38:08] decision you are coming because your
[38:10] husband coming to the church only then
[38:12] you haven't made the decision you are
[38:14] coming because your parents are coming
[38:15] to church then you haven't come to the
[38:17] point of making the decision you've got
[38:20] to make the decision to follow Christ
[38:23] amen when on in Acts 238 in the book of
[38:27] Acts when the Holy Ghost came down and
[38:29] the apostles being filled with the Holy
[38:31] Ghost they preaching preaching this
[38:32] profound sermon and the people being
[38:34] pricked in the Heart by the sermon they
[38:36] be convicted now and now they want to
[38:39] know what do we do now Peter we believe
[38:43] we we we believe the things you are
[38:45] saying but what do we do now to be
[38:47] saved now he's giving them Peter is
[38:50] opening the keys to the kingdom amen
[38:53] amen because didn't Jesus say scriptures
[38:57] f scriptures before that amen before
[38:59] Jesus
[39:00] death when he said who do who do people
[39:04] say the son of man is
[39:05] amen who do you say that the son of man
[39:08] is and he said thou are the Christ the
[39:10] son of the Living God and he said
[39:14] Peter Upon This Rock This Rock of
[39:17] spiritual Revelation I will build my
[39:18] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[39:21] Prevail against it amen so the church is
[39:24] always built upon spiritual Revelation
[39:26] and he said I give you the keys to the
[39:27] kingdom whatsoever you shall bind on
[39:29] Earth shall be bound in heaven what you
[39:31] loose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven
[39:32] and here's Peter opening the keys now he
[39:34] had spiritual Revelation amen yes sir
[39:37] and he says firstly you're all believing
[39:39] this right now to come in this way you
[39:44] got to repent every one of
[39:46] you first you must come by
[39:49] repentance there's no shortcut in
[39:51] Christianity amen you've got to come by
[39:55] repentance cuz the Bible says for all
[39:57] have sin and fallen short of the glory
[39:59] of God everybody coming to God must come
[40:04] to
[40:06] repentance don't try to caught a girl
[40:10] and get happy that she's just coming
[40:11] visiting your church and thinking
[40:13] because she's visiting your church
[40:14] started to wear long dresses stop
[40:16] wearing makeup she's going to believe
[40:18] this
[40:19] message if she hasn't come by true
[40:23] repentance amen you've got to give them
[40:25] the word test
[40:28] same with the girls cting a boy don't
[40:30] let them be excited the boy just
[40:32] following you and coming to
[40:34] church he just doing that for maybe
[40:37] other
[40:38] reasons give them the word test amen
[40:41] what is the way the criteria it can't
[40:44] change it hasn't changed through all the
[40:46] church AG from the time it
[40:48] started repent every one of
[40:51] you be baptized in the name of the Lord
[40:54] Jesus Christ
[40:55] amen for the remission of your
[40:58] sins so are you remitting sins
[41:02] now at the bread of Christ you have the
[41:05] power to remit
[41:06] sin God has given you the authority to
[41:09] do that but you got to follow you got to
[41:11] come and take the same criteria you tell
[41:13] the people repent every one of you be
[41:16] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in
[41:18] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[41:19] of your
[41:21] sins so you're going to give them the
[41:23] antidote you're going to give them the
[41:25] criteria amen
[41:27] and you shall receive the baptism of the
[41:29] Holy Ghost amen amen you shall receive
[41:32] that robe
[41:34] amen so youve got to give him that
[41:36] criteria amen so you as the bride the
[41:40] wife of Jesus Christ that come into a
[41:42] union with him now because roles and
[41:44] responsibility changes in marriage
[41:47] courtship is different from marriage in
[41:50] courtship everything is loving
[41:52] everything is
[41:54] nice all good times amen but in marriage
[41:58] you got to go to trials and testings
[42:01] amen amen in a true marriage you have
[42:04] must go to trial and testing now every
[42:06] son and daughter of God must be tried
[42:08] and tested in the
[42:10] fire
[42:14] amen gold must go into the fire
[42:19] amen so we find that in
[42:24] marriage you must be tried and
[42:28] tested but you are the one saying no I
[42:31] stand with my beloved bridegroom my
[42:35] husband amen I take every word of his no

[42:46] words I will stand with the words
[42:49] because this Bride As does say the Lord
[42:52] which you keep still amen amen so R and
[42:55] responsibility changes Your Role is to
[42:58] take the word believe his word act upon
[43:02] his words amen and his role and
[43:05] responsibility as the bridegroom is to
[43:07] nurture you and keep Pro providing you
[43:10] with spiritual food amen and then
[43:13] providing the things that you have need
[43:14] of that's why he said seeking first the
[43:17] kingdom of God and his righteousness
[43:20] then all his things the things that you
[43:22] have need of the caral things we all
[43:25] need carnal things we all need m
[43:27] material thing we all need food we all
[43:29] need clothing those things will be taken
[43:31] care of that's his responsibility amen
[43:34] because he is Jehovah Gyra our
[43:38] provider that's part of his Redemptive
[43:40] blessings amen you need healing is
[43:43] Jehovah Rafa your healer that's part of
[43:46] God's Redemptive blessings amen he wants
[43:49] to fulfill every part of his Redemptive
[43:51] blessings but he needed the family to
[43:54] display His blessings too amen amen he
[43:57] was waiting for the family amen in the
[44:00] back part of his mind he had the family
[44:02] album but he waited for the time and
[44:05] season when they will be
[44:07] manifested now if you are still lying
[44:10] dead to sins and
[44:12] trespassers then you can't receive this

[45:17] bride is now ready amen she's ready
[45:20] ready to take on the responsibility of
[45:22] wife amen
[45:25] amen amen
[45:29] so he
[45:31] says in that same paragraph 96 and he
[45:34] said and then when the church has the
[45:36] ceremony makes their promises then she
[45:40] takes the bridegroom's
[45:44] name okay let's read from paragraph 95
[45:48] because we read in 94 he says about
[45:49] decisions made the next engagement then
[45:51] the promise he says and 95 he says and
[45:54] then the ceremony and that's when the
[45:57] bride takes the bridegroom's name she's
[46:00] no more than of her own name she takes
[46:03] the bridegroom's name and then when the
[46:06] church as the ceremony makes their
[46:09] promises then she takes the bridegroom
[46:11] name then she's no longer a church of
[46:13] the world she's a church of the Lord
[46:16] Jesus
[46:17] christall amen he said I now I don't
[46:20] mean that by name I mean that by birth
[46:23] by Nature amen by the power of God
[46:27] by the revealed truth of God in the
[46:29] heart she becomes a Christian Church the
[46:33] great Universal Apostolic Christian
[46:35] Church she becomes a part of Christ when
[46:38] she does that Christ injects into her
[46:41] his own Spirit his own life amen amen
[46:47] amen that's what the purpose of Calvary
[46:50] was for that his own life amen that the
[46:55] life in the old Testament under the
[46:57] sacrifice the life under Bull and goats
[47:00] couldn't come on to the believer amen
[47:02] but yeah the Life of Christ must come
[47:05] onto the believer which is a token which
[47:08] is the token is the literal Life of
[47:10] Christ being on display
[47:13] amen she becomes part of a Christ so and
[47:17] the Bible said to Adam and Eve you are
[47:19] no longer Twain but one and when the
[47:23] woman church is married to Christ they
[47:24] are no longer two they are
[47:27] one Christ in you amen his life has been
[47:31] brought into you then you become the
[47:35] bride
[47:36] amen then another thing after she's
[47:39] taken all these vows and so forth and
[47:41] the ceremony has been said like my like
[47:45] my wife's name was bro before she was
[47:46] married now she's no longer a bro she's
[47:49] a brandom now she isn't no more BR the
[47:51] gram and when you come into Christ you
[47:54] know more of the world you of Christ
[47:57] amen you care not then for the things of
[48:00] the world they are dead to you for he
[48:03] that loves the world or the things of
[48:05] the world the love of God is not even in
[48:07] him so you see you can be an artificial
[48:11] Christian you can be an artificial
[48:13] professed Christian but you can't be a
[48:18] Christian become until Christ injects
[48:20] himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:23] unto you am then you are connected with
[48:25] him
[48:27] so you see out of this new
[48:30] birth then you if you don't have the new
[48:32] birth then you like every other person
[48:34] only when you have a new bird you are a
[48:36] different species amen you are part of
[48:38] the god species
[48:41] amen because you are now a new creation
[48:45] amen walking on the earth and New
[48:47] Creation walking on the earth you
[48:49] connected with him you are no longer
[48:51] Tain you are one Christ promised to be
[48:54] in us as the father was in Christ I and
[48:57] my father are one you and I are one the
[49:00] Christ in us all that God was he poured
[49:02] into Christ and all that Christ was he
[49:05] poured into the church to continue the
[49:08] work of the
[49:10] Gospel then we become not by artificial
[49:13] name not by a reality of the Holy Spirit
[49:16] of Life connecting us into Christ then
[49:18] through the power of his resurrection we
[49:21] are raised from the dead things of the
[49:23] world and sitting with him in Heavenly
[49:25] places amen amen tonight we sitting in
[49:27] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[49:29] resurrected with him died to the things
[49:31] of the world and took on Christ and when
[49:34] we take on Christ then the world is dead
[49:37] then no we know more care for the world
[49:40] the world is dead to us and is dead to
[49:42] us as we did to it amen
[49:48] amen we have to be dead to the things of
[49:50] the world Amen
[49:57] you see what a glorious thing this is
[50:04] amen so we find that the literal Life of
[50:07] Christ must be displayed in US it must
[50:09] be the token
[50:11] amen then the Bible says in Acts 188 but
[50:15] yes shall receive power after that the
[50:17] Holy Ghost is come upon you and Y shall
[50:20] be Witnesses upon me unto me both in
[50:23] Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria
[50:25] to the uttermost part of the world Amen
[50:29] so we have that promise when the Holy
[50:31] Ghost comes upon us we shall receive
[50:32] power and when we receive power there
[50:35] must be a continuation of Christ's
[50:37] Ministry on Earth amen amen and Christ
[50:39] Ministry started to continue in the book
[50:41] of Acts and then we find that it stopped
[50:45] went through the Dark Ages and a little
[50:48] and a little bit of light was shown in
[50:51] every other age but in this age amen
[50:54] there must be the fullness of Christ
[50:55] again in the bride
[50:57] amen all that Christ was must be poured
[50:59] again into the church because in this
[51:02] age title leaders come back down Amen in
[51:05] this days our names are revealed amen
[51:08] that we are part of him amen our names
[51:11] are shown we we can see our names in a
[51:13] book how do we see our name when we see
[51:16] oursel as part of the word and when we
[51:18] see oursel walking out of the scripture
[51:20] pulled out of the scripture amen we see
[51:23] that part of the word that belongs to us
[51:25] amen amen
[51:27] and it and in this
[51:30] age we also have a responsibility to
[51:33] play thou must prophesy again because
[51:36] why the book is given to us and if the
[51:39] book is given to us that means we must
[51:41] call out the names in the book amen how
[51:44] do you call out the Nam of the book by
[51:46] going and preaching the same message
[51:49] amen that's speaking this message and
[51:51] the Revelation and that's how you're
[51:53] calling out the names amen you're
[51:55] calling them out the ifying thems by
[51:58] seeing the name in the book by speaking
[52:00] this very word that you have received
[52:02] the same word that you are eating you
[52:03] are speaking it out you're prophesying
[52:06] it again before Nations and tongues amen
[52:08] amen and therefore the Bible said you
[52:11] can't cast your Pearl to swine because
[52:13] now you have discernment when you are
[52:15] speaking to somebody you're speaking
[52:17] them giving them the words you are
[52:19] seeing if there's a pull amen amen if
[52:21] there's a pool you feed them more you
[52:23] give them more nuggets if there's no
[52:25] pool and people are condemn you walk
[52:26] away yeah
[52:28] amen amen that's how you know D must
[52:32] prophesy because you can see the names
[52:34] in the book amen how do you see the name
[52:37] word identify word amen word must
[52:40] identify word so you go to your own amen
[52:43] how you identify your own when you are
[52:45] preaching the word when you are
[52:46] preaching the gospel when there's a pull
[52:48] you start to give more you start to
[52:49] disciple amen your job is to go and
[52:52] preach the gospel amen if people reject
[52:54] you you preach the gospel you walk away
[52:57] but if there's a pool you have the right
[52:59] to disciple his people
[53:01] amen amen thank you him that overcometh
[53:05] will I make a pillar in the temple of my
[53:07] God Revelation 3:12 him that overcometh
[53:10] will I make a pillar in the temple of my
[53:13] God and he shall go no more out and I
[53:16] will write upon him the name of my God
[53:18] and the name of the city of my God which
[53:21] is New Jerusalem which cometh down out
[53:23] of Heaven from my God and I right upon
[53:26] him my new
[53:31] name so just as he was supposed to be
[53:34] subject to Adam the bride must be
[53:37] subject to Christ's word amen but this
[53:41] eve will not fall as he fell in even
[53:44] this bride will not fall as the bride
[53:46] fell in Eden amen because he already
[53:49] prophesied I will present myself a
[53:51] glorious church and whenever God puts
[53:54] the word I there an i that's of the I
[53:56] will Covenant and that word must be
[53:59] fulfilled he said I
[54:02] will amen provide myself a glorious
[54:05] Church Without spot without wrinkle
[54:07] without blemish
[54:12] amen so we know even this bride has such
[54:16] a glorious position because what's left
[54:19] now this is a
[54:20] union people are thinking that the union
[54:23] the marriage is going to take place when
[54:25] we go in rtion no if you don't have if
[54:28] you don't come into the union now if you
[54:30] are not in the marriage now there is no
[54:32] Rapture for you that's
[54:34] righten let's get that established quite
[54:37] clear if there's no union now if there's
[54:40] no marriage now there is no Rapture for
[54:44] you because the Rapture is for those
[54:46] that come into a union amen amen the
[54:50] Rapture is for those that come in the
[54:52] marriage now amen amen the Rapture is a
[54:56] way supper we are going to a wedding
[54:58] supper to enjoy to celebrate to Rejoice
[55:02] amen hallelujah yes but now is where the
[55:05] union takes place Amen to be shut in
[55:08] your Li in the secret place yes Lord
[55:10] amen to to to hear all the secret things
[55:13] that he's telling us telling us all
[55:16] these mystery truths these divinely
[55:18] mystery truths
[55:20] amen and it couldn't be done until the
[55:23] headstone comes down that's why Paul say
[55:26] said we prophesy in part we we we do all
[55:29] the things in
[55:31] Parts but when that which is perfect is
[55:34] come amen what do what which is perfect
[55:38] amen all the divinely mystery revealed
[55:42] truths when these mystery truths are
[55:44] being revealed that's been revealed now
[55:47] that's which is perfect is come amen The
[55:50] Headstone come down the mind of Christ
[55:53] comes
[55:54] down and therefore
[55:56] the bride has a not a mind of her own
[55:59] that's is why now because we know the
[56:02] soul controls the spirit and the spirit
[56:05] controls the body right but if the soul
[56:08] has the gene of God and the Soul has the
[56:10] Holy Ghost amen It cast off reasoning
[56:12] and doubt and takes in faith to believe
[56:15] God's word then and now when you have
[56:18] the mind of Christ then you your body is
[56:21] moving conjunction with that amen then
[56:24] your body is moving now in in tune with
[56:26] the mind of Christ and to God's purpose
[56:29] on earth into the father's business
[56:32] don't you know you must be about your
[56:34] father's business Christ the word yes
[56:37] down on the earth when he was here on
[56:38] the Earth being the
[56:40] word what he was worried about he said
[56:44] when when Mary and Joseph started to
[56:45] look for him and he was in the temple
[56:47] and they came Mary said don't you know
[56:48] your father's been looking for you he
[56:50] said don't you know I'm to be about my
[56:52] father's
[56:54] business the word for correcting the
[56:56] error
[56:59] amen so our business is our father's
[57:02] business our business is not
[57:05] year to come and and establish how much
[57:11] wealth we can accumulate in this world
[57:13] and how long how long life we can have
[57:16] on this Earth what a good life we can
[57:18] have this Earth how we can build an
[57:19] Empire on this Earth no our business is
[57:24] about establishing what am I doing what
[57:26] is my purpose for the kingdom what have
[57:29] God placed me where has God placed me to
[57:31] be effective in his kingdom what can I
[57:34] do for the kingdom of God why did God
[57:37] keep me in this hour what is my position
[57:39] that I'm supposed to be placed in the
[57:41] body of Christ that I can be effective
[57:43] in the
[57:45] Kingdom
[57:46] amen then nothing will be W from you
[57:50] amen you got to do that part then
[57:53] nothing then he will fulfill his part as
[57:55] the bride room which is to nourish you
[57:57] who is to provide for you
[58:00] amen provide the things that you have
[58:02] needed that's why he said don't take
[58:04] thought what food you're going to eat
[58:06] what clothes you're going to
[58:08] wear for your father knows the thing
[58:10] that you have need of Amen
[58:15] yes but we find that the next step now
[58:18] when we the bride coming to marriage
[58:20] Union there must be a weding supper amen
[58:24] but the makeup of the Bride come from
[58:26] seven Church ages and the Bible said
[58:28] they without us cannot be made perfect
[58:30] they are waiting for us Amen to walk in
[58:33] to come into perfection in his hour
[58:36] amen and how you come into Perfection by
[58:39] coming to a union with him by coming in
[58:41] wonders with him because now you are
[58:44] perfected in him you are perfected
[58:46] through Christ amen amen
[58:49] and just like Esther before she could
[58:52] present be presented to the king she had
[58:54] to go to a time of preparation so we
[58:56] know that when we come in his word it
[58:57] was a process amen we had to go to a pro
[59:00] process before she could present herself
[59:02] to the king she had to go to a process
[59:04] of
[59:05] preparation she couldn't go and conduct
[59:08] herself like how she used to conduct
[59:09] herself a manism had change amen maybe
[59:13] the culture that she had he had to
[59:15] change because now she's in royalty
[59:18] now amen a look at the change the way
[59:22] she wear garments had to change the way
[59:24] she walk it had to change
[59:27] amen when you come to Christ your work
[59:29] is got to
[59:30] change therefore you find Jacob had to
[59:33] have a name change but before that he
[59:35] his walk had to change yeah he had to
[59:38] have a change in his step yes when he
[59:40] met the angel of God he had to have a
[59:41] change in his step your your your walk
[59:44] can't be the same once you meet the
[59:46] angel of God you can't be walking the
[59:48] same walk amen amen you can't present
[59:51] your king to yourself to the king
[59:53] knowing that you are the Queen of Heaven
[59:55] you are royal
[59:57] you can't be conducting yourself the
[59:59] same like how you used to do in times
[1:00:02] past amen we not any longer under the
[1:00:05] master of sin amen we are now under
[1:00:09] Christ
[1:00:11] amen we are connected with
[1:00:14] Christ and now you are a royal
[1:00:17] priesthood a holy nation A peculiar
[1:00:20] people amen and you are walking with the
[1:00:23] whole host of Heaven backing you up and
[1:00:26] he's given you all of the land to enjoy
[1:00:29] he's given you power over every demon
[1:00:31] power amen he's given you the authority
[1:00:35] to go and cast out demon he's giv you
[1:00:37] authority to pray for the sick amen all
[1:00:40] the things is given to the church but
[1:00:43] you got to fight every
[1:00:44] inch how does it fight now they are to
[1:00:47] fight natural Israel for a physical
[1:00:50] battle how do you fight we wrestle not
[1:00:52] against flesh and blood but against
[1:00:54] powers and darkness and rulers of
[1:00:56] darkness in our places how do you fight
[1:00:58] you battle in prayer you battle in
[1:01:01] fasting amen you come for a total
[1:01:04] surrender in the flesh
[1:01:06] amen it's a spiritual
[1:01:09] warfare the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:01:11] not caral
[1:01:15] amen so we're now in the final hour
[1:01:18] before the wedding supper but we know
[1:01:20] the voice of the Resurrection must take
[1:01:22] place next there must be a resurrection
[1:01:25] because We Go Together amen but the
[1:01:30] prophet being a
[1:01:32] prophet he saw a preview of the
[1:01:35] bride and he
[1:01:37] saw the filthy filthiness of the church
[1:01:40] world but he saw this bride again much
[1:01:43] he saw the initial bride and then he saw
[1:01:45] it again coming again after the Fess
[1:01:48] then he saw the bride again but then he
[1:01:51] saw her coming out of line and he
[1:01:54] screamed being a prophet he screamed out
[1:01:55] St stay in line stay in line stay in
[1:01:58] line why are you saying that stay in
[1:02:01] line stay in line with the
[1:02:04] words amen
[1:02:06] don't don't come out of the covering of
[1:02:09] the word amen stay in line of the
[1:02:12] word so what the fivefold ministry is
[1:02:14] doing making you stay in line with the
[1:02:16] word bringing you the same word the word
[1:02:19] hasn't change amen amen the word is just
[1:02:22] becoming clearer to you it hasn't change
[1:02:25] but it's become more clearer you begin
[1:02:27] to understand the word in the time that

[1:02:33] responsibility more clearer as you come
[1:02:36] as your your walk changes then you begin
[1:02:39] to take on your responsibility
[1:02:41] more amen so the responsibility of the
[1:02:45] the bride is To Be watchful prepared and
[1:02:47] in full Union with Christ before the
[1:02:50] Rapture amen and to produce Jesus Christ
[1:02:53] again
[1:02:56] because we know this bride the prophet
[1:02:57] said will have thus save the Lord oh she
[1:02:59] will keep
[1:03:00] still that means she's got the complete
[1:03:02] word

[1:03:12] amen and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:03:15] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and

[1:03:29] Ministry where where this bride is
[1:03:31] called now into this Rapture amen into
[1:03:33] this Union the shout is called her
[1:03:36] called her away from all the
[1:03:37] denomination all the Creeds and all
[1:03:39] these things and it's shut her up shut
[1:03:42] her in amen shut in with Christ nobody
[1:03:46] else can come in there she shut in with
[1:03:48] Christ if anybody else come in you must
[1:03:50] come by the right way you must come

[1:03:57] they must come through the door yes amen
[1:04:00] just the way that you come in
[1:04:02] amen yes wonderful they don't want to
[1:04:05] come through the door they don't want to
[1:04:06] believe his Prophet they want to take
[1:04:07] all their part of the Bible say but it's
[1:04:09] all good it's all nice the minute you
[1:04:11] bring them to the messenger of the hour
[1:04:13] they don't want to receive
[1:04:15] it how can you receive the message
[1:04:17] without the messenger exactly the
[1:04:18] messenger is the one that carrying the
[1:04:20] message amen
[1:04:30] a lot
[1:04:31] of even the you you'll never hear this
[1:04:34] even in the church World they all speak
[1:04:36] about a church because they know who
[1:04:37] they are but they'll never speak about
[1:04:39] being a bride yes yes they will never
[1:04:42] mention the word bride bridegroom
[1:04:45] yeah because it's a mystery amen amen
[1:04:48] and the Mystery of this marriage is the
[1:04:50] bride being united through with Christ
[1:04:53] through Revelation amen
[1:05:02] that is
[1:05:03] why this
