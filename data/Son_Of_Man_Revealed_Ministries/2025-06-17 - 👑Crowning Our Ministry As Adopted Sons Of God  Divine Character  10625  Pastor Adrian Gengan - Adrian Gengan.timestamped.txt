[0:02] Amen. I greet you all in the holy name
[0:04] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[0:06] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[0:07] the Lord this morning. Amen. To worship
[0:09] him and give him praise. Amen. Amen. And
[0:12] we are looking forward to that great
[0:14] day. Amen. When we shall see our Lord
[0:16] Jesus face to face. And I'd like to tell
[0:19] you that I don't believe we have too
[0:20] much of time. Amen. This is the winding
[0:23] up. Amen. Hallelujah. We can feel
[0:25] something happening. So we encourage
[0:28] you, amen, to make the most of every uh
[0:31] opportunity we get to come into the
[0:33] house of the Lord. You know, one of
[0:34] these days this opportunity will be
[0:36] taken away from us and then you're going
[0:37] to be seeking counsel, seeking advice,
[0:39] and seeking Amen. something more of God
[0:42] and you're not going to find it.
[0:45] Amen.
[0:47] So we don't want political events and
[0:50] religious events to shake us into place.
[0:52] We want the word of God which shows us
[0:54] our part of the word to put us in our
[0:56] place. Amen. Amen. So, praise the Lord.
[0:59] So, and uh just because you come to
[1:02] church doesn't mean I am shephering you.
[1:05] Amen. You got to allow me the
[1:07] opportunity to shepherd you. You've got
[1:10] to be under the covering of a local
[1:11] church. Amen. The prophet said, "It's
[1:15] for your protection." Amen. It's for
[1:17] your benefit. It's for your ministry.
[1:19] And if you believe that the pastor is
[1:20] sent to see you through to the rapture.
[1:22] Amen. And you can't be missing services
[1:25] that's equipping you for the rapture.
[1:27] Amen. So this morning we're going to
[1:29] Amen. speak a little thought. Amen.
[1:33] Uh Sister Devi Amen. was unwell. Amen.
[1:36] My mom's unwell with the flu. I know
[1:38] there's many people unwell. Amen. So
[1:40] we're just praying that the Lord will
[1:41] touch them this morning. Amen. Remember
[1:43] Sister Devi. Amen. Sister Grace. I'm not
[1:46] sure of any other prayer request that's
[1:47] gone out. Amen. and just remember these
[1:49] believers in prayer. It's good to see
[1:50] our brother Abniggo back in church.
[1:52] Amen. Let's give the Lord a good ankle
[1:54] clap of praise for touching him and
[1:56] bringing him back into the house of the
[1:58] Lord. Amen. Sister Suraj is not here
[2:00] this morning. She's away on a little
[2:02] break with the family. So we pray that
[2:04] the Lord will be with him. Amen.
[2:05] Hallelujah.
[2:07] Amen. So I'm speaking on the crowning of
[2:09] our ministry as adopted sons and we took
[2:12] divine nature. Now we said it was very
[2:14] specific, right?
[2:16] We said it. God has to give us his
[2:18] divine nature.
[2:21] I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man.
[2:24] Amen. You remember when Jesus was
[2:25] speaking to Nicodemus, he said that
[2:28] except you be born of water and of
[2:30] spirit, you cannot see the kingdom.
[2:33] Right? So that's very Amen. Uh it's a
[2:37] it's a pattern that we follow because
[2:39] Jesus said, "Seek the kingdom first."
[2:41] Then when he's talking to Nicodemus,
[2:43] he's telling him when you come into the
[2:44] kingdom, you can't do it with flesh and
[2:46] blood. So I'm going to have to change
[2:48] your old nature. And nature has to do
[2:50] with the seed. So the last time we were
[2:52] speaking on the divine nature after
[2:55] divine nature, out of divine nature
[2:57] comes divine character.
[3:00] Amen. So we're looking more on that this
[3:02] morning on divine character. Now divine
[3:05] is godlike, not human.
[3:09] Amen. When we're talking about divine,
[3:10] it's godlike, not human. So, we don't
[3:13] want human nature. Sometimes we mistake
[3:16] human nature like goodness. You know, we
[3:18] can be have very good human nature.
[3:20] There are many Buddhist and and Hindus
[3:22] and and Muslims are very good in the
[3:24] human nature. But that's not where what
[3:26] we are looking for. We are looking for
[3:28] the divine nature and the divine
[3:30] character of God.
[3:32] Praise the Lord. So, Galatians 4, we'll
[3:34] start there. So when remember we are not
[3:37] looking to mold a good human nature and
[3:39] a good human character but we are
[3:42] wanting a godlike nature and a godlike
[3:44] character.
[3:46] Galatians 4 we'll read from verse one
[3:48] there. Now I say that the heir as long
[3:52] as he is a child defereth nothing from a
[3:55] servant.
[3:57] Amen. So even though you're born in the
[3:59] house if you don't come and be placed as
[4:01] a son of God you are no better than an
[4:04] angel.
[4:05] because angels are servants, ministering
[4:07] spirits,
[4:10] though he be lord of all,
[4:13] but he's under tutors and governors. So
[4:16] that's the Holy Spirit now, our tutor
[4:18] and our governor until the time
[4:20] appointed of the father. The time of
[4:23] appointed of the father is the adoption
[4:25] ceremony.
[4:26] Right? But when the fullness of time was
[4:29] come, God sent forth his son made of a
[4:32] woman made under the law to redeem them
[4:35] that were under the law that we might
[4:37] receive the adoption of sons. Now
[4:40] remember Ephesians 1 and5, we were
[4:42] predestinated unto adoption of children.
[4:45] That's the end result. And because you
[4:47] are sons, God sent forth the spirit, the
[4:50] Holy Spirit into your hearts, crying,
[4:53] aba father. Hallelujah. Wherefore thou
[4:56] art no more a servant but a son. And if
[5:00] a son than an heir of God through
[5:03] Christ.
[5:04] Amen. So if we are sons and daughters of
[5:06] God, we are hes of God through Christ.
[5:11] Amen. So second Peter chapter 1, we'll
[5:14] read from verse three. It says,
[5:16] "According as his divine power had given
[5:19] unto us all things that pertain unto
[5:22] life and godliness." So there's a power
[5:25] placed in the believer, but that power
[5:27] can only be activated if we have the
[5:29] right nature and the right character.
[5:33] Amen.
[5:36] That's why God is working to mold our
[5:38] character.
[5:40] So that we can operate the power of the
[5:42] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[5:47] according as he had as his divine power
[5:49] had given unto us all things that
[5:51] pertain unto life and godliness through
[5:53] the knowledge of him that had called us
[5:56] to glory and virtue. So we are called to
[5:59] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[6:02] us exceeding great and precious promises
[6:05] that by these you might be partakers of
[6:08] the divine nature having escaped the
[6:11] corruption that is in the world through
[6:13] lust. Amen. and the Lord had blessings
[6:15] to the reading of his word.
[6:17] You may be seated. Praise the Lord.
[6:21] Amen. I just have maybe I'll say it now
[6:24] so I don't forget later. Amen. There's a
[6:26] 50th birthday celebration coming up.
[6:29] Amen. Praise the Lord. A jubilee. Amen.
[6:33] Our dear sister Elaine, the Lord has
[6:35] been gracious to her. Amen. So, she'll
[6:38] be turning 50. And I'm glad for these
[6:41] celebrations because women conceal their
[6:43] age until a specific celebration.
[6:47] Praise the Lord. But 50 is a great year.
[6:49] Amen. It's the Jubilee and they want to
[6:53] invite the church. Amen. It's still some
[6:56] time away. It's like almost a month
[6:58] away, but they're giving you advanced
[6:59] notice. It's going to be on Saturday the
[7:01] 5th of July at 3 p.m. at 7 Regway Place,
[7:05] Woodview Phoenix. Is that the Bible way
[7:07] church? Amen. So we've had a few events
[7:10] there at the Bible way church. Amen. So
[7:12] you are requested to RSVP by 15th of
[7:15] June. Praise the Lord. Now remember this
[7:18] is very scriptural. First the invite was
[7:21] given and people didn't respond to the
[7:23] invite the Lord sent. So he said go to
[7:26] the highways and the byways. So if you
[7:29] don't respond sane has to go to highways
[7:31] and byways to Amen. get more people. So
[7:36] there's a number here. Amen. Sister
[7:39] Janice, you'll need to tell her or if
[7:41] Sister Janice is not sure, you can just
[7:42] tell Sister Elaine whether you're going
[7:44] to be coming or not. Amen. So, everyone
[7:47] is invited. Tell your neighbor you are
[7:49] invited because some people like to
[7:50] exclude themselves.
[7:52] You told him. Amen. Praise the Lord. So,
[7:56] Amen. Look forward to that. It's a 50th
[7:58] birthday and thanksgiving service of
[8:00] Sister Elaine. Amen. We pray that the
[8:02] Lord will bless them in their planning
[8:04] and whatever needs to be done there.
[8:06] Hallelujah.
[8:08] Everyone feeling good? Amen. Now, like
[8:12] we were saying, now is not the time to
[8:15] fool around.
[8:17] Amen. We are living in a very late hour.
[8:21] If I can say it like this, there's only
[8:23] a certain amount of time allotted for us
[8:25] Gentiles.
[8:28] Amen. The prophet of Malachi 4:5 and 6.
[8:33] Amen. The prophet of Revelation 10:7 has
[8:36] already come and gone.
[8:39] Amen.
[8:41] The word that was sent to give us
[8:43] perfect faith
[8:45] was already revealed.
[8:49] Praise the Lord.
[8:51] When the Bible is talking about the
[8:53] mystery of God being revealed, that is
[8:55] talking about a door being opened to us.
[8:58] Amen. Amen. A door being opened for
[9:01] marriage. Hallelujah. Amen. Because when
[9:05] the mystery of God is being that's for
[9:07] another sermon now. I don't want to
[9:08] really go into that. But when the
[9:09] mystery of God is being opened up, pay
[9:12] attention. God is doing something.
[9:15] Because if you understand what the
[9:16] mystery of God is, you'll realize you're
[9:19] a part of the mystery of God.
[9:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, it's very
[9:27] important for you not to fight your
[9:29] battles alone in this time. Amen. We
[9:32] ought to be working very specifically.
[9:35] Amen. To build up now and prepare for
[9:38] the final body change.
[9:41] Maybe you're thinking you got years left
[9:43] on the earth. Maybe you're thinking you
[9:45] got your whole life left you on the
[9:47] earth. Don't leave it to chance. In
[9:50] fact, before the rapture comes, the Lord
[9:52] could take your life away.
[9:54] None of us are guaranteed a day. God
[9:56] don't owe us a thing.
[9:58] The Bible says to everything there is a
[10:00] purpose, a season, a time. Time to be
[10:03] born and a time to die. Amen. Amen. We
[10:06] all celebrate our birthdays. We know the
[10:09] time we were born, but none of us know
[10:10] the time we will die.
[10:13] So let us be ready at all times. Amen.
[10:16] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So we are
[10:19] speaking on divine character.
[10:22] Amen. We are looking at the crowning of
[10:24] our ministry as adopted sons of God.
[10:27] Amen.
[10:29] Now, many people think that there's
[10:32] nothing that will happen prior to the
[10:34] coming of the Lord Jesus.
[10:36] If I could say it this way in a mature
[10:38] way where you'll understand the second
[10:41] coming of the Lord Jesus is already in
[10:42] progress. The shout is already happened.
[10:45] Amen. We are caught up in the cycle of
[10:47] the rapture which means Jesus is here
[10:50] with us in the shout
[10:52] because the quote is Jesus does all
[10:54] three things as he is descending. So if
[10:57] we are caught up in the shout Jesus is
[10:59] here with his people.
[11:04] Amen. Now remember the shout is in no is
[11:08] not in the legacy in church age.
[11:11] Praise the Lord. They rejected. They
[11:13] didn't want to open up the door.
[11:16] So the shout is to gather the living
[11:18] saints. Praise the Lord. Amen. So I
[11:22] didn't mean to do it this way, but we've
[11:24] been speaking on Luke chapter 15. And
[11:26] the Lord was showing us that the story
[11:28] which is referred to as the prodigal son
[11:32] is not a evangelical scripture like the
[11:35] denominations use it, but it's a
[11:38] scripture regarding adoption.
[11:42] Hallelujah.
[11:44] It's a scripture regarding adoption.
[11:47] Now, we know that if you can put up Luke
[11:49] 15 there. Amen. I might repeat some of
[11:52] these things just for the benefit and
[11:54] just because I'm gracious for the ones
[11:55] that haven't been here on Wednesday
[11:56] nights because for the last two
[11:58] Wednesday nights, we've been speaking on
[12:00] Luke chapter 15. Praise the Lord. And I
[12:03] really don't want you to miss out on
[12:04] certain things here. Amen.
[12:07] So we are seeing here that this man
[12:10] which is representing the kingdom of God
[12:12] has two sons. Amen.
[12:16] One is a gentile, one is a Jew.
[12:19] Praise the Lord.
[12:23] And the younger of them said to his
[12:25] father, "Father, give me the portions of
[12:27] good that fallen to me." Now before we
[12:29] move further, this boy, like we read in
[12:31] Galatians chapter 4, was under tutors
[12:33] and governors.
[12:37] He's coming from that Hebrew background.
[12:39] So this boy had a teacher. He had
[12:42] governors that was teaching him the ways
[12:44] of the father.
[12:46] Amen. So he had a gene seed that was
[12:50] just like his father.
[12:52] But at the moment he's no better than a
[12:54] servant. He has no authority in the
[12:57] household.
[12:59] He's got to wait for the time appointed
[13:01] of the father which is the adoption
[13:03] ceremony.
[13:06] Now
[13:08] the this father knows that this boy is
[13:10] growing in his divine nature but there's
[13:13] only certain things that can be taught.
[13:16] The rest will come by experience. Amen.
[13:20] Praise the Lord. He can teach him about
[13:23] his nature, the father's ways. He can
[13:26] teach him about these things. But
[13:28] character cannot be taught.
[13:34] You can't come and and pray Lord give me
[13:37] good character.
[13:39] The prophet of God is saying that
[13:41] character doesn't come that way.
[13:43] Character is coming by trials,
[13:46] testings, temptations.
[13:50] So it's our everyday things that we are
[13:52] facing in this life that is molding and
[13:54] shaping our character. Amen. Now, be
[13:57] careful as sons and daughters of God
[13:59] that we don't despise those things or we
[14:02] don't mishandle those situations because
[14:04] those situations are meant to mold and
[14:06] shape our character. Amen. It's not
[14:09] meant to make us slump even further
[14:11] because of our bad attitude and we don't
[14:13] know how to handle the situation.
[14:16] Everyone's understanding that.
[14:19] So, whatever he goes out with, now the
[14:22] father is not going to stop him.
[14:26] Because the father knows I can't give
[14:28] him character.
[14:31] So all this boy has now is the
[14:33] mechanics. He's been under tutors.
[14:37] He's been under teachers. So he's got
[14:39] the mechanics. Who amongst us don't know
[14:42] the word of God by now? Who amongst us
[14:45] don't know, Amen, the mystery of God?
[14:47] Who amongst us don't know, Amen, that
[14:49] it's wrong to cut your hair?
[14:52] that you shouldn't put a garment
[14:53] pertaining to a man. All of those things
[14:55] have been clearly spoken to us while we
[14:58] under the guide the teacher.
[15:01] Amen.
[15:03] Praise the Lord. Who don't know conduct,
[15:05] order, and doctrine, we know these
[15:08] things. Praise the Lord.
[15:12] So the father is going to send him out
[15:14] with a portion of himself because to
[15:17] have the father's goods and to leave
[15:19] with it, it's still drawing from the
[15:22] father's source. So he's going to start
[15:25] to use the father's resources which
[15:27] means he's going to have the gifting. So
[15:29] I'm trying to show you the state that
[15:31] this boy was. He had moved past
[15:33] justification, moved past
[15:35] sanctification, but he was now going to
[15:37] settle for the restoration of the gifts
[15:39] under the Pentecostal age. He just
[15:42] wanted the gifts.
[15:44] And he was going to denominate around
[15:46] it.
[15:47] Praise the Lord.
[15:49] So the father divides unto them his
[15:51] living, meaning he gives them the gifts.
[15:54] And not many days after the youngest son
[15:57] gathered all together and took his
[15:59] journey into a far country. Now I also
[16:02] want to say that some people have
[16:03] remained in the church but they're far
[16:05] away from God.
[16:08] Some people have come to church but they
[16:10] are involved in gambling. They have come
[16:13] to church but they're involved in
[16:15] drinking. Come to church involved in
[16:17] smoking. They haven't left the father's
[16:19] house.
[16:20] But their hearts are far away from him.
[16:24] Praise the Lord.
[16:27] Amen.
[16:29] But this boy in particular had left the
[16:31] father's house. So I'm saying don't be
[16:33] religious at this time.
[16:36] Amen. Now is not the time to act
[16:37] religious here. But Amen. born again on
[16:40] a Sunday but gone again on a Monday.
[16:44] Amen. We proclaiming that we are
[16:46] Christians but then your friend, your
[16:48] girlfriends, your wife, your husband
[16:50] can't see the life of Christ being
[16:51] reproduced.
[16:56] Amen.
[16:57] It's a pity we don't have the we we can
[16:59] play the sounding brass and the tinkling
[17:01] symbol.
[17:03] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's what the
[17:05] Bible says. We become like a sounding
[17:08] brass. Amen. Amen.
[17:13] So which means what God is looking for
[17:15] is for the life to be on display. Oh
[17:18] yes. Amen.
[17:21] Amen. It's no use you trying to convince
[17:23] somebody about what you believe when you
[17:25] yourself don't believe it. Amen.
[17:29] Amen. How can we convince others to come
[17:31] to church when we don't come to church?
[17:35] Praise the Lord. Do you know that the uh
[17:37] the rest of the religions expect
[17:39] Christians to go to church on a Sunday?
[17:43] They expect Christians to go to church
[17:44] on a witness day. In fact, if you tell
[17:46] them you didn't go, they'll wonder
[17:48] what's wrong with you.
[17:51] Because when it's time for them to go to
[17:53] the temple, they go.
[17:55] No matter how backsliden they are or how
[17:58] amen uh abbotss they have in this life,
[18:01] when it comes to those things, they go.
[18:05] So I'm saying to to us who more grace is
[18:08] given, why do we handle the things of
[18:10] God like this? Why are we not serious
[18:13] about the things of God? We are
[18:14] Christians.
[18:16] Amen.
[18:18] So this boy goes on a journey to a far
[18:21] country and they wasted his substance
[18:24] with righteous living. And when he had
[18:26] spent all
[18:28] Amen there arose a mighty famine in the
[18:30] land and we showed you that amen in the
[18:31] book of Hosea how there would be a
[18:34] famine for the true word of God and it
[18:36] began to be in want. So now he had
[18:39] wasted all of the father's resources.
[18:45] Amen.
[18:47] and he joined himself to a citizen of
[18:50] that country. So he went to some local
[18:53] denomination. He got himself entangled
[18:55] with the Leosans.
[18:58] What was he doing when he's finding a
[19:01] citizen of the country? He's trying to
[19:03] find another source.
[19:06] Praise the Lord.
[19:09] He was attached to the father source. He
[19:12] was attached to the outpouring of the
[19:15] gifts. But the time and season had
[19:17] changed.
[19:19] Praise the Lord.
[19:22] So which means now they have
[19:24] impersonation of gifts.
[19:28] Amen. Don't don't anyone come here and
[19:31] tell me that the Lord is working their
[19:33] denominations. That's Janice and Jamus.
[19:36] Amen.
[19:38] And don't anyone dare say the pastor
[19:40] prayed for me and I didn't get healed.
[19:41] I'm going to some denomination pastor to
[19:43] be healed. You will attach yourself to
[19:45] every demon spirit that's associated
[19:46] with them.
[19:50] Amen.
[19:52] Praise the Lord. We've got to be
[19:54] thoroughly convinced. Amen. Of what we
[19:56] believe. We've got to be thoroughly
[19:58] convinced that this is the message of
[19:59] the hour.
[20:02] Praise the Lord. Amen. We can't attach
[20:05] ourselves to citizens of the earth.
[20:09] Amen. Wednesday I was trying to show the
[20:11] church that brother Brandham is saying
[20:12] that this eagle egg was there trapped in
[20:14] the chicken yard and it etched and it
[20:18] was a little eaglet running out and now
[20:20] the eagle mother eagle came to call that
[20:23] chicken out of the chicken yard
[20:25] and I was telling you that we are living
[20:27] in such a late hour now that almost all
[20:30] the chickens almost all the eagles have
[20:32] been called out of the chicken yards and
[20:34] the skies the heavenly places are full
[20:36] of eagles flying together.
[20:39] Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. So,
[20:42] heavenly places, Amen. is a pretty
[20:44] crowded place with believers, a flying
[20:47] eagle.
[20:50] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[20:55] So, he's this man, this boy is trying to
[20:57] find a different source because now he's
[20:59] cut off from the blessings of the
[21:00] father. He had wasted the resources.
[21:04] He realized now that speaking in tongues
[21:05] wouldn't cut it. So we can't rely on the
[21:08] Holy Ghost that fell on Zuza Street and
[21:10] the restoration of the gifts. This is
[21:12] now the giver of the gifts has come into
[21:14] the church. Amen. The evening messenger
[21:17] loosed the Holy Ghost.
[21:20] And made way for the Holy Ghost himself,
[21:22] not just gifts.
[21:25] Praise the Lord. People chasing after
[21:28] gifts. They're looking for a gifted
[21:30] pastor. When you go read one Corinthians
[21:33] 13, it says you can be gifted.
[21:35] Jesus even says you you prophesied in my
[21:37] name. You cast out demons in my name.
[21:40] But he says, "Depart from me. I never
[21:42] knew you."
[21:44] So don't look for a gifted pastor. Don't
[21:47] look for a gifted person.
[21:50] Amen. Look for the life. Amen. Look for
[21:53] the life to be on display. Because by
[21:56] their fruits you shall know them.
[21:59] Amen. Hallelujah. Because people are are
[22:02] presenting. They have a message seed. A
[22:04] message seed. But the life has got
[22:06] perversion.
[22:08] The life has got filth. The fruit is
[22:11] showing filth, but they're showing
[22:12] message seed.
[22:15] Praise the Lord.
[22:18] Amen. Impersonation of the message of
[22:20] the hour.
[22:22] Now watch. After he he tries to attach
[22:25] himself to the citizen of the country,
[22:28] the citizen sends him into the fields to
[22:31] feed swine.
[22:33] right to feed pigs. Now pigs is the
[22:36] lowest form or the filthiest animal you
[22:39] can find.
[22:40] So we remember what we are looking at.
[22:43] He was going to test his nature against
[22:46] the world against the leosian spirit.
[22:50] Amen. The filthiest nature is the pig.
[22:54] Remember how the prophet would dramatize
[22:56] it. You can take a pig, you can wash the
[22:59] pig, make it all nice and clean. You can
[23:02] even put a nice pretty bow on its head
[23:04] and say, "Little pig, you're now nice
[23:06] and clean."
[23:08] But the nature within the pig wants to
[23:10] go to the mud.
[23:13] So if our nature is still pulling us to
[23:16] the things of the world, which means we
[23:17] are not a new creation yet.
[23:21] If we can still drink, if we can still
[23:23] smoke, we can still gamble, still lie,
[23:26] still cheat, still speak lies, which
[23:29] means the nature hasn't changed.
[23:33] So, we got to know what to fix.
[23:37] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[23:42] Now, watch. He sends him to feed swine.
[23:44] But then they also, the Bible says he
[23:47] would fain filled his belly, there's no
[23:49] food there.
[23:52] Even though he's working for them, they
[23:55] don't provide him with food.
[23:59] Amen.
[24:01] He wants to fill his belly. He wants to
[24:04] eat,
[24:06] but there's a famine.
[24:09] There's no food.
[24:11] They've got food for the pigs, but no
[24:14] food for the human.
[24:17] Right? And what does the Bible says? And
[24:20] no man gave unto him.
[24:23] Which means there was no charity.
[24:26] Charity is only found in the headstone.
[24:28] Amen. Charity is only found in the
[24:30] message of the hour. Amen. Charity is
[24:33] only up at the headstone, capstone. So
[24:36] they they Amen. filled his belly that
[24:39] the swine did eat. And the next words
[24:41] are,
[24:43] Amen. The next words there are, and no
[24:47] man gave unto him. Maybe I didn't put
[24:49] the whole verse there, but if you pull
[24:51] up the verse, you'll find it in Luke
[24:52] 15:16. No man gave him to eat.
[24:56] Now, if if somebody doesn't give you to
[24:58] eat, what are they trying to do? Starve
[25:00] you to death.
[25:04] So, think of this boy's condition
[25:07] who came from a message home. But now
[25:10] he's starving to death. He had an
[25:13] abundance of the prophet's books and
[25:14] tapes, but now he's starving to death
[25:17] because he hasn't been reading the word.
[25:19] He hasn't been listening to the message
[25:20] of the hour.
[25:24] And no man gave him to eat. Amen. Praise
[25:28] the Lord.
[25:33] So there's no charity there. That's
[25:34] verse 16 I was looking at, brother.
[25:36] Amen. Verse 16, not 17 there.
[25:39] We're going to go to 17 now. Now in
[25:42] verse 17, it says, "When he came to
[25:45] himself," Now remember that this is not
[25:49] just a story.
[25:52] This is a parable.
[25:55] It's a earthly story with an heavenly
[25:57] meaning. Which means that this boy,
[26:00] another spirit had overtaken him for him
[26:02] to go into that condition. Because
[26:04] remember, he has divine nature. Amen.
[26:07] And when he tested his nature against
[26:09] the pig nature, he realized this is not
[26:11] where I belong.
[26:14] Hallelujah. His nature was a divine
[26:17] nature, but now he's in the lowest form
[26:19] of animal nature, the pigs.
[26:24] Praise the Lord. Now, I want to stop
[26:26] right there. When he came to himself,
[26:29] Amen. You go back to the quotes. I put a
[26:31] I put a quote in there because there is
[26:34] something that's going to make him come
[26:36] to himself. This boy has amnesia.
[26:39] Amen.
[26:40] The prophet says the bride hasn't had a
[26:42] revival yet. So this boy wasn't having
[26:44] any revival day in the pig pen.
[26:48] No manifestation of God to stir the
[26:50] bride. There was nothing there to stir
[26:52] him. He says we are looking for it now.
[26:55] It'll take those seven unknown thunders
[26:57] back there to wake her up again.
[27:01] So when he's coming to himself, we know
[27:04] that there's a spiritual awakening
[27:05] happening within him. He's starting to
[27:08] remember who he is. He's starting to
[27:10] wake up again. He's starting to have a
[27:13] revival with thoughts of home, with
[27:15] thoughts of father's house. Amen. This
[27:17] is the eagle now screaming in the
[27:20] chicken yard,
[27:22] screaming there amongst the pigs. And
[27:24] this boy is looking up and something
[27:26] within him the divine nature is pulling
[27:28] out.
[27:30] Now remember in all of these things his
[27:33] character is being formed.
[27:37] Praise the Lord. Because remember we
[27:40] said divine nature divine character is
[27:42] being formed and character can only be
[27:45] through the molding and shaping.
[27:48] You have to go through your experiences.
[27:50] You have to go through your low moments
[27:52] your valley moments. Sometimes you'll go
[27:54] through sicknesses. Sometimes you'll go
[27:55] through poverty. Sometimes you'll go
[27:57] through hard struggles in this life. But
[27:59] all of that God is knows how to shape
[28:01] your character.
[28:04] Praise the Lord.
[28:12] So he said when he came to himself, he
[28:14] said, "How many hired servants of my
[28:18] father have bread enough?" Now they
[28:20] don't only have bread enough in the
[28:22] father's house.
[28:24] They have spare.
[28:28] Praise the Lord. He says they have bread
[28:30] enough and to spare. And I perish with
[28:34] hunger.
[28:36] Now there are many people that are
[28:37] perishing spiritually. And Jesus in
[28:39] Matthew 6 is telling us that no man can
[28:42] serve two masters.
[28:44] Either you will hate one, love the
[28:46] other, or else you will alter the one
[28:48] and despise the other. You cannot serve
[28:50] God and mammon. So this boy was at a
[28:52] crossroad right now. Either I stay in my
[28:54] condition and perish with hunger
[28:59] or I can go back to father's house and
[29:00] serve God.
[29:02] He's at a crossroad. Therefore I say
[29:05] unto you take no thought of your life.
[29:07] Young people, old people even now don't
[29:10] think that accumulation of goods is
[29:12] going to make you happy in this life.
[29:15] You can have the best car, the best
[29:16] home, the best food to eat. that doesn't
[29:19] make you happy in life.
[29:24] You can even have money to go on
[29:25] holidays and and to do very nice things.
[29:28] You can even buy Amen. multiple
[29:31] properties, multiple cars. You can even
[29:33] start businesses and all of these
[29:35] things. God is going to bless you. Amen.
[29:37] But that doesn't Amen. determine your
[29:39] happiness.
[29:44] Praise the Lord. You know that famous
[29:45] quote of the prophet, he says,
[29:47] "Happiness doesn't consist of how much
[29:49] of the world's goods you own."
[29:51] True happiness comes from serving the
[29:53] Lord Jesus Christ.
[29:56] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[30:00] So Jesus is saying, "Take no thought of
[30:03] your life." We spend the whole night
[30:05] thinking about our life.
[30:07] Jesus says, "Take no thought of your
[30:08] life."
[30:11] Amen.
[30:14] what you shall eat.
[30:16] Some of us already got the menu for the
[30:18] whole week.
[30:20] Amen.
[30:22] Tomorrow herbs.
[30:25] Praise the Lord.
[30:29] What you shall eat,
[30:32] what you shall drink,
[30:35] nor yet for the body, what you shall put
[30:37] on. See, as soon as I mentioned Sister
[30:39] Ela's birthday, some sisters were
[30:41] already thinking what I'm going to wear.
[30:48] But he says, "Don't even bother what
[30:50] you're going to wear. Even if you wear
[30:52] the same outfit you have now, we don't
[30:54] care."
[30:58] Sisters, see brothers, I'm trying to
[30:59] help you. All right?
[31:05] Jesus saying don't worry what you shall
[31:07] put on. Is not life value the things
[31:10] that mean the most. Is not life more
[31:13] than meat
[31:16] and the body than raignment.
[31:18] Behold the fowls of the air for they sow
[31:20] not neither do they reap nor gather into
[31:24] barns yet your heavenly father feedth
[31:26] them.
[31:27] I'm bringing the scripture for a reason.
[31:30] God had not forgotten this boy.
[31:32] If you can take care of sparrows, his
[31:34] eye was always on this boy.
[31:38] Amen.
[31:41] No gather into barns. Yet your heavenly
[31:42] father feeded them. Are you not much
[31:45] better than they?
[31:47] Are you not better than sparrows? Which
[31:50] of you by taking thought can add one
[31:51] cubit unto his stature?
[31:54] And why taking thought for Raymond
[31:56] consider the liies of the field? How
[31:59] they grow? They toil not, neither do
[32:01] they spin. And yet I say unto you that
[32:04] even Solomon in all his glory was not
[32:06] arrayed like one of these. Wherefore if
[32:09] God so clothe the grass of the field
[32:11] which today is and tomorrow is cast into
[32:13] the oven, shall he not much more clothe
[32:15] you? Oh we of little faith.
[32:19] Jesus is going to reiterate. Now
[32:21] therefore take no thought saying, "What
[32:23] shall we eat? What shall we drink?
[32:25] Whether shall we be clothed? For all
[32:27] these things do the Gentiles seek. For
[32:30] your Father, heavenly Father, knoweth it
[32:32] that you have need of all these things.
[32:34] But seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[32:36] and his righteousness, and all these
[32:38] things shall be added unto you. Take no
[32:41] thought for the tomorrow, for the
[32:43] tomorrow shall take thought of the
[32:44] things of itself. Sufficient unto the
[32:47] day is the evil day of.
[32:49] So in verse 18, now the boy is saying, I
[32:53] will arise. Amen. Many of us want God to
[32:56] take us out of our situation. Many of us
[32:59] want God to take us out of our troubles.
[33:02] But God wants you to arise. God wants
[33:05] you to do something about your
[33:07] situation.
[33:09] Stop telling God about your situation
[33:11] and your problem. Do something about it.
[33:17] Amen. The father wasn't going to send an
[33:19] helicopter there, send a ladder down
[33:21] into that pig pen and take the boy out
[33:23] of it. The boy had to do something.
[33:27] Praise the Lord.
[33:30] Amen. Didn't David have to do something?
[33:35] When he was facing the threat of Goliath
[33:38] and he walked into the Philistine or the
[33:41] Israel army that day,
[33:45] did he just pray and say, "Lord, deliver
[33:46] us from the situation."
[33:49] He put himself in the first person that
[33:51] he was an instrument of God.
[33:54] He walked into that circumstance and he
[33:56] took control of atmospheres.
[33:59] He took control of principalities. He
[34:01] took control of powers. You walk into
[34:04] any situation. You're a son and daughter
[34:06] of God. Take control of situations.
[34:11] God had already trained him on the
[34:12] backside. I'm trying to show you God had
[34:14] already trained David's character.
[34:17] This man had divine nature. You say,
[34:19] "Yeah, divine nature." Didn't God say
[34:21] David is a man after my own heart?
[34:25] Hallelujah.
[34:27] Praise the Lord.
[34:29] So God is confirming David is a man
[34:31] after my own heart. To have the heart
[34:34] like God means you have divine nature.
[34:37] And character is molded on the back side
[34:39] of the desert. When bear is coming to
[34:41] take his sheep, when lion is coming to
[34:44] take his sheep, his character is being
[34:46] molded a character of a lion. He's from
[34:49] the tribe of Judah. He's got a lion
[34:51] nature within him. I say in this end
[34:53] time, if we are the spirit of the flying
[34:55] eagle, how about we soar above our
[34:57] circumstance? How about we soar above
[34:59] our problems? How come we are so
[35:02] weak-minded that every small problem we
[35:04] get down?
[35:08] Amen.
[35:09] God has not given us a spirit of fear.
[35:12] God has not given us a spirit of
[35:13] anxiety, the spirit of depression that
[35:15] we must get worried about every single
[35:17] thing that happens. Amen. By now, we
[35:19] ought to have the oil of the Holy Spirit
[35:21] where these things flow off of us like
[35:23] water
[35:26] of something that's bathed in oil.
[35:29] Praise the Lord.
[35:32] So he says, now I was telling about
[35:34] David. David walked into that situation
[35:36] and he took control and he had to go and
[35:39] pick up stones.
[35:43] God wants you to do something.
[35:45] Where's your stones?
[35:48] You want to kill your giant? Where's
[35:49] your stones?
[35:52] Where's your sling? No, I want God to do
[35:54] it for me. God wants you to do it.
[35:57] Because if you understand in this time
[35:58] and season, God is not going to come
[36:00] down from the sky. God is going to do it
[36:02] through you. Amen. God is working
[36:04] through you. God is going to use your
[36:06] voice and speak through you.
[36:09] I'll give you another example quickly.
[36:11] Moses and the children of Israel at the
[36:13] Red Sea. Moses is calling to God and God
[36:15] is saying, "Why are you crying to me?
[36:18] What's wrong with you? Didn't I just
[36:21] display my power?" 10 supernatural signs
[36:24] in Egypt. Now you come to the Red Sea.
[36:27] God is wanting you to speak to the wind
[36:30] so that the wind comes and parts the
[36:32] ocean.
[36:33] And don't forget when you speak to your
[36:36] ocean, when you speak to your mountain
[36:39] and you passing through that ocean, when
[36:41] you get to the other side, remember to
[36:43] close the sea upon your enemies.
[36:46] Some of you have come out of situations,
[36:48] you've come out of churches, you've come
[36:50] out of all circumstances, but you've
[36:52] allowed the Red Sea to remain open, and
[36:54] those demon powers are still trying to
[36:56] attack you. Turn back and speak to that
[36:58] ocean. Amen. Amen. Wonderful. Amen.
[37:02] Yes, Lord. We come out of denomination.
[37:05] We still got the ocean open.
[37:08] Now your cousin is coming after you. Now
[37:11] your friend is still coming after you.
[37:13] Hey, for the good old time sake, let's
[37:14] go back to Egypt.
[37:16] Let's eat the the leaks and the garlics.
[37:20] Hey, come one more shot. You remember
[37:22] how we used to read in the old days? You
[37:24] left the ocean open.
[37:27] Moses had to stand and speak that the
[37:31] wind would seize and the waters would
[37:33] come back and drown all of the enemies.
[37:38] Some people got more compassion than
[37:39] God. They feel I'm going to speak now.
[37:42] Hey, this people are going to get
[37:43] drowned here.
[37:47] Don't have compassion on your enemies.
[37:51] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[37:54] Somebody steal your phone, you want to
[37:55] hit them.
[37:57] When they stole somebody else's phone,
[37:58] you saying, "Ah, give the guy a chance."
[38:01] Hey,
[38:05] so God is expecting us to do something.
[38:09] Praise the Lord. Christ the mystery of
[38:12] God revealed. Christ wants to have full
[38:14] expression through his many membered
[38:15] body.
[38:18] But the bride is mute.
[38:20] People are mute. They want God to
[38:22] descend from the heavens and sort their
[38:24] situations out. God is working to equip
[38:26] you.
[38:28] Amen. Now, when he's saying, "I will
[38:30] arise and go to my father,"
[38:33] every time you hear the word father,
[38:35] it's talking about origins.
[38:38] He wants to go back to his origin. Amen.
[38:43] Amen. He's saying I will arise and go to
[38:46] my father and I will say father I have
[38:49] sinned against heaven and before thee
[38:51] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[38:53] son make me as one of thy hired servants
[38:57] and right here is where every time you
[38:59] hear word father his heart is being
[39:01] turned back to the father which means
[39:03] this boy is exposed to Malachi 4:5 and 6
[39:09] which says behold I will send you Elijah
[39:11] the prophet this boy could never have
[39:13] gone back to the father without this
[39:15] ministry. Our hearts could never be
[39:17] turned back to the faith of the
[39:18] Pentecostal fathers without Malachi 4:5
[39:21] and 6.
[39:24] So this boy was under a prophetic
[39:26] ministry. Now you said prophetic
[39:28] ministry. Yes. What is causing him to
[39:30] remember these things? Behold, I will
[39:32] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[39:34] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[39:36] the Lord. And he shall turn the hearts
[39:38] of the fathers to the children. We know
[39:40] that was John the Baptist. And this is
[39:42] the part where the boy is now and the
[39:44] heart of the children to their fathers
[39:46] lest they come and smite the earth with
[39:47] a curse.
[39:50] Praise the Lord.
[39:54] So even if you find yourself in a
[39:56] backsliden condition now, why don't you
[39:57] pick yourself up? Amen. You say, "I'm
[40:00] not hearing Malachi 4:5 voice." You are
[40:02] hearing Malachi verse 5 4:5 and 6
[40:05] through the five-fold ministry. The
[40:07] bride under a messenger will become the
[40:09] final voice through the final age.
[40:11] People are saying don't put the
[40:13] five-fold ministry on the pulpit. Put
[40:15] the tapes on. I'm saying you have
[40:16] gravely misunderstood the prophet.
[40:22] Praise the Lord. So the boy's heart
[40:25] being turned back to the faith of his
[40:26] father is because now he's under Malachi
[40:29] 4:5 and 6.
[40:31] Praise the Lord.
[40:34] Amen. Something is turning his heart. He
[40:36] arose and came to his father. But while
[40:39] he was yet a great way off, his father
[40:41] saw him.
[40:44] Now think of this boy. He's starving. He
[40:47] doesn't have much energy.
[40:49] He's wretched, naked.
[40:53] Poor.
[40:55] Amen. But he is coming back to father's
[40:57] house. And let me tell you something.
[41:00] This boy is not coming back the same way
[41:02] that he went. When he left father's
[41:04] house, he was full of pride. When he
[41:06] left father's house, he was full of
[41:07] himself. When he left father's house, he
[41:09] was relying on the the the the
[41:12] outpouring of the gifts.
[41:14] He was relying on his own strength. But
[41:17] character had developed him through his
[41:18] experiences.
[41:21] And he said now he's coming back with a
[41:23] humble attitude. Now he's coming with a
[41:26] heart of repentance.
[41:28] What is he saying? I'm saying you can't
[41:30] come back to father's house without
[41:31] repentance. Amen. People think they can
[41:34] go and do the worst of things and just
[41:36] come back into the father's house. You
[41:37] must repent. You must be baptized in the
[41:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And then
[41:43] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[41:45] Ghost. Thank you, Lord. People think
[41:47] they can live up as lives with no
[41:48] repentance. Why? Then it still shows
[41:51] that you have pride here. But he is
[41:53] saying, Amen, that I will go and say,
[41:54] I've sinned against heaven. Do we
[41:57] realize that when we sin, we are not
[41:58] just sinning against ourselves? Yes.
[42:00] Listen to the boy's words. I have sinned
[42:02] against heaven.
[42:07] How about when we lie? How about when we
[42:10] steal? Can we say I have stolen against
[42:12] heaven? I have lied against heaven.
[42:16] I have drank against heaven. I committed
[42:19] fornication against heaven. I committed
[42:21] adultery against heaven. But I repent.
[42:29] So repentance proved his character.
[42:33] He did not have pride. His character had
[42:35] been molded. He was coming back humbly.
[42:38] And this is what father was looking for.
[42:41] The father knew he had divine nature.
[42:43] But he sent him out. He didn't stop him
[42:45] because he knew the experiences would
[42:47] mold his character. Some of us don't
[42:49] learn our our our lessons in life.
[42:53] But God is molding our character through
[42:55] these. So now he's coming back with the
[42:57] divine character.
[43:00] Praise the Lord.
[43:04] Notice when he comes back, he doesn't
[43:07] come back there.
[43:11] Guess who's back.
[43:14] He doesn't come with an attitude.
[43:16] Father, your son has returned.
[43:21] Restore to me my room.
[43:24] Father, is my room still in tip-top
[43:27] shape? He doesn't speak like that.
[43:31] When you come back to father's house, we
[43:34] come back humbly.
[43:39] Amen. And he rose. His father came. He
[43:42] saw him a great way off. His father saw
[43:44] him and had compassion.
[43:47] He ran, fell on his neck, and kissed
[43:50] him.
[43:52] Where is he now?
[43:54] He's not in the Leysian church age
[43:56] anymore.
[43:59] He's all the way up in the headstone
[44:00] now.
[44:04] Where is charity?
[44:06] Somebody tell me the headstone.
[44:10] So this boy is not in Leosa.
[44:13] He's not operating under brotherly
[44:15] kindness. He's coming back to the
[44:18] father. He's all the way up in the
[44:20] headstone.
[44:23] Because this message came to pull you
[44:24] out of Leosia and pull you into the
[44:26] headstone.
[44:28] Some people thinking the headstone is
[44:30] only coming back when when when we are
[44:32] raptured. No, there's a ministry under
[44:34] the headstone.
[44:39] Praise the Lord.
[44:45] And the son said unto him, "Father, I
[44:47] have sinned against heaven and in thy
[44:49] sight, and I'm no more worthy to be
[44:51] called thy son." Right? Now, remember
[44:54] when he left home, he left with servant
[44:56] mentality because he was just a child.
[44:58] He's coming back with the same
[45:00] mentality, but the father is going
[45:04] to bring up to date to present tense
[45:07] ministry.
[45:10] He didn't realize that the father was
[45:13] shaping and molding his character. And
[45:15] when he came back, he wanted to be a
[45:17] servant. But here what the father says.
[45:20] But the father said to his servants, he
[45:21] don't even address the boy.
[45:24] Bring forth the best robe. Amen.
[45:29] Hallelujah. Now to wear the robe of the
[45:31] father requires very specific type of
[45:35] development of your character.
[45:39] Because number one, you need to be the
[45:41] same stature
[45:43] as your father. David, can you wear your
[45:46] father's coat? It fits you properly.
[45:49] Maybe.
[45:51] Well, maybe use Joshua and Joshua. You
[45:53] can use your father's coat.
[45:56] If you want to use your father's code,
[45:57] what must you do? You need to bulk up,
[46:02] right? I'm giving you a carnal example.
[46:06] bring the best robe.
[46:09] The best robe in that house was the
[46:11] father's robe.
[46:14] I got a quote for that. The prophet is
[46:16] saying here in the message secondhanded
[46:18] robe. He says, "But through the years,
[46:21] God had molded the man's character into
[46:23] a place after his call that he would fit
[46:26] into the robe."
[46:28] So your life experiences are making you
[46:31] fit into the father's robe.
[46:36] The robe can also type the word of God.
[46:40] Amen.
[46:42] Our our experiences, the pain, the
[46:44] suffering,
[46:45] the hurt, the loss that we go through
[46:48] has been molding and shaping our
[46:50] character.
[46:52] Now when you come and you put father's
[46:54] robe, dad,
[46:58] it's a perfect fit.
[47:02] How
[47:06] how does your robe fit me so perfectly?
[47:10] He was chastised
[47:12] and despised.
[47:14] He was mocked.
[47:16] He learned character. He learned
[47:18] obedience through the things he
[47:19] suffered.
[47:22] Amen. So through the years, God had
[47:24] molded the man's character into a place
[47:27] where after he's called, he would fit
[47:29] the rope. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[47:33] And he put on him the ring on his hand.
[47:37] The ring is typing authority.
[47:40] Praise the Lord. The authority because
[47:43] the ring had a seal. What is the father
[47:46] doing? Now remember the boy is coming
[47:48] back to be a servant in his mind. When
[47:51] he is coming back, the father is placing
[47:52] him in adoption. This is a very serious
[47:55] time. Amen. When you come back, expect
[47:57] the responsibilities of the kingdom.
[47:59] Amen. The father's kingdom
[48:01] responsibilities are now placed in his
[48:03] sons and daughters.
[48:05] Amen. It's the authority of the father
[48:08] and put shoes on his feet.
[48:13] Servants at that time didn't wear shoes,
[48:14] but it's only sons that were placed.
[48:18] Oh, you got to read a hidden life. And
[48:20] you've got to read here him to
[48:22] understand this entire story. The father
[48:24] taking Jesus up onto the mountain. Amen.
[48:27] clothed in the garment a glorified body.
[48:30] Praise the Lord. Amen. To adopt him. So
[48:34] now he says, "Bring the fed calf." And
[48:36] the fed calf is representing the
[48:38] sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[48:40] Amen. Let us eat and be merry for my son
[48:44] was dead and is alive and was lost and
[48:47] is found. Praise the Lord.
[48:56] Hallelujah.
[48:58] So it's a very specific time when you
[49:00] are coming back to father's house in
[49:01] this time and season.
[49:05] Don't expect to just be a casual
[49:06] observer in the house.
[49:10] This is the time appointed of the
[49:11] father.
[49:14] Like I was telling you the last time,
[49:16] brother Brham couldn't preach algebra
[49:20] to a denominational church. He says you
[49:22] don't even know your ABCs.
[49:25] I say now is the time appointed of the
[49:27] father where this message can preach
[49:30] algebra.
[49:33] If you want ABCs, this is not preschool.
[49:38] Wear your hair long. Wear long dresses.
[49:43] Wear short faces.
[49:47] Amen.
[49:49] This is not the time you know we have
[49:51] inspectors where you're inspecting
[49:53] somebody else.
[49:57] We are not inspectors in the father's
[49:59] kingdom. Hey bro, why you why are you
[50:01] your tie is wrong there? Put another
[50:02] tie.
[50:06] How many of you remember the early
[50:07] years?
[50:09] Hey,
[50:11] praise the Lord. We are not inspectors.
[50:15] Father is expecting maturity out of us.
[50:19] Amen. Praise the Lord. Remember, it's an
[50:21] individual walk.
[50:23] If somebody doesn't want to tow the
[50:25] line, it's their life. The church here
[50:27] is a hospital. The church has three
[50:29] kinds of believers. We welcome all
[50:32] because we want the world to the word to
[50:33] change you. We want the word to shape
[50:35] you, to mold you. So, anyone's welcome
[50:37] here if they want to sit under the word.
[50:43] Praise the Lord.
[50:49] So God himself,
[50:51] now I just want to read this. Maybe
[50:53] we're going to close now.
[50:55] Amen.
[50:57] God is working. I'm going to close by
[50:59] saying this. God is working to mold our
[51:01] character.
[51:03] And every day is molding our character
[51:06] and he's shaping us. Now you say, why
[51:08] you hopping on this? Is because we're
[51:10] going to the next phase. The divine
[51:13] nature is because of the seed gene
[51:14] within us.
[51:15] You can't change that
[51:19] because the seed identifies the nature.
[51:23] So we have the gene seed.
[51:26] Character can't be given to you.
[51:29] Character must be molded through life's
[51:31] experiences, life's circumstances. And
[51:34] why is character necessary for the next
[51:36] stage?
[51:38] for divine power
[51:40] because without character you God won't
[51:43] release power to you.
[51:47] Next comes divine power.
[51:49] Praise the Lord.
[51:54] I'm going to skip a lot here, brother.
[51:55] Amen.
[51:57] I'm going to go past
[52:10] Let me see if I can find this for you.
[52:17] If you can find where it starts with
[52:19] Romans 8:17 to18. I'm trying to find a
[52:22] place to close here now. Amen. It's in
[52:25] the message uh
[52:28] it's in the church age book. Amen. Smian
[52:30] church age. It starts with Romans.
[52:35] Romans chapter 8:17 to18. You got it. So
[52:38] let's find a place to close here now. He
[52:40] says, "And if children then hes of God
[52:44] and joint hes with Christ."
[52:48] Somebody tell your neighbor, I am joints
[52:50] with Christ.
[52:53] Joints mean doesn't mean Jesus has 51%
[52:56] stake and you got 49.
[53:01] What does it's got equal?
[53:06] This is scripture now. Romans 8:17 to18.
[53:09] And if children, then hes of God, joint
[53:12] hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer
[53:14] with him,
[53:17] that we may also be glorified together.
[53:20] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[53:22] present time are not worthy to be
[53:24] compared with the glory which shall be
[53:25] revealed in us. Amen.
[53:28] Oh Lord, reveal your glory. You want the
[53:30] glory to come from the sky. The glory is
[53:33] going to be revealed in us.
[53:41] Now hear what he says next. Unless we
[53:44] suffer with him, we cannot reign with
[53:48] him.
[53:50] Remember the boy now? Maybe it's a story
[53:52] that doesn't have much detail, but I'm
[53:54] putting the detail in there. The boy had
[53:56] something to overcome.
[53:58] He had to overcome Leosia.
[54:01] When he went back to father's house, he
[54:03] had overcome Leoa, the Leician spirit.
[54:07] And when you overcome, you know what the
[54:09] scripture says? You sit with me on my
[54:11] throne. Therefore, the because he
[54:13] overcame Leosia. That's why the father
[54:15] was ready to give him the robe, give him
[54:17] the ring, and give him the shoes because
[54:19] he was ready to reign. Amen. He was
[54:21] ready to sit on the father's throne
[54:24] because he overcame Leosia. Is that
[54:26] scripture? Do you overcome the age? So
[54:29] unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[54:31] reign with him.
[54:34] You have to suffer to reign. Now
[54:37] somebody tell me only a king reigns.
[54:41] To reign in a kingdom. You're a king. He
[54:44] has made us kings and priests.
[54:47] You have to suffer to reign. Remember
[54:49] David? David had to suffer to reign.
[54:55] The reason, here is where we're getting
[54:56] it now, that we can't impart it by
[54:58] prayer. We can't imparted by gifts. The
[55:02] reason for this is that character simply
[55:05] is never made without suffering.
[55:10] You say, "Oh, I lost this in life. I
[55:12] lost my parents. I lost my son. I lost
[55:14] my daughter. I lost my husband. I lost
[55:16] my wife." God was using those
[55:18] experiences
[55:21] to mold character.
[55:25] What happened to Job? You give, you take
[55:27] away.
[55:29] Though it's heartbreaking, but you give,
[55:31] you take away.
[55:34] My heart will choose to say, "Blessed be
[55:38] your name." Hallelujah.
[55:42] The reason for this is that character
[55:44] simply is never made without suffering.
[55:48] Character is a victory,
[55:52] not a gift.
[55:56] So, how many of you can pray for
[55:57] character? Do you know what's going to
[55:59] happen when you pray for character?
[56:02] Here comes trials.
[56:04] Here comes sufferings. Here comes
[56:07] temptations.
[56:08] God is molding. He said, "Hey, my son
[56:10] wants divine character.
[56:13] Have you considered my servant Job?
[56:20] The reason for this is that character
[56:22] simply is never made without suffering.
[56:24] Character is a victory, not a gift.
[56:28] Now, a gift is something you give to
[56:30] somebody.
[56:32] Even God himself
[56:34] can't just give it to you.
[56:40] Let's continue to read.
[56:45] A man without character can't reign.
[56:48] You see why the boy couldn't reign?
[56:51] Initially, he had no character. The
[56:54] father had to let him out on his own,
[56:56] develop his character, then he could
[56:58] reign. A man without character can't
[57:00] reign because power apart from character
[57:05] is satanic.
[57:08] But power with character is fit to rule.
[57:12] Amen. And since he wants us to share
[57:15] even his throne on the same basis that
[57:18] he overcame and he sat down in his
[57:20] father's throne, then we have to
[57:22] overcome to sit with him.
[57:26] All the little temporary suffering we go
[57:28] through now is not worthy to be compared
[57:31] to the tremendous glory that will be
[57:33] revealed in us when he comes. What
[57:35] treasure are laid up for those who are
[57:37] willing to enter into the kingdom
[57:39] through much tribulation?
[57:42] Think it's not strange concerning the
[57:44] fiery trials that are to try you. That
[57:46] is what Peter said. Is it strange that
[57:48] God wants to develop our Christlike
[57:50] character that comes through suffering?
[57:53] Oh, read that slowly. Christlike
[57:55] character comes through
[57:58] suffering.
[58:01] No sir, we all have trials. We all are
[58:05] tried and chasened as sons. No one but
[58:08] goes through that. Not one but goes
[58:10] through that. The church that is not
[58:12] suffering and is not being tried isn't
[58:15] of God.
[58:22] He he's going to bring in Hebrews here
[58:24] now. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[58:25] chastneth
[58:27] and scourgeeth every son whom he
[58:29] receiveth. But if he be without
[58:31] chastisement, whereof all our partakers,
[58:34] then are ye bastards and not sons.
[58:38] Listen to what he says. I'm closing with
[58:40] this now. This special condition in
[58:43] Smyrna must be applied to every age.
[58:47] There is no age free from it. There is
[58:50] no true believer free from it. This is
[58:53] of God.
[58:56] What is he talking about? Suffering,
[58:58] trials. This is of God.
[59:01] This is the will of God. It is needful.
[59:05] We need the Lord to teach us the truth
[59:07] that we are to suffer and be Christlike
[59:09] in doing it. Love suffered long and is
[59:12] kind.
[59:14] Blessed are you when men shall revile
[59:15] you and persecute you and shall say all
[59:18] manner of evil against you falsely for
[59:20] my name's sake.
[59:22] Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for your
[59:24] reward in heaven. And so persecuted they
[59:27] the prophets which were before you.
[59:29] Watch what he says now. The cloudy skies
[59:32] and storms of life are no signs of God's
[59:34] disapproval. Neither are bright skies
[59:36] and still waters signs of his love and
[59:39] approval. His approval on any of us is
[59:42] in only in the beloved. His love is
[59:44] elective which he had for us before the
[59:47] foundation of the world. Does he love
[59:48] us? Yes. But how shall we know? We shall
[59:52] know because he said so and manifested
[59:54] that he did love us. For he brought us
[59:57] to himself and gave us of his spirit,
[59:59] placing us as sons. Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] How many of you want to know how you can
[1:00:05] prove your love to him?
[1:00:08] How many of you want to know how you
[1:00:09] prove your love to the Lord? Let's see
[1:00:11] what the prophet is saying here. This is
[1:00:12] our last quote. And how do I prove my
[1:00:15] love to him? By believing what he said.
[1:00:20] Not not Lord, I love you. I love you.
[1:00:24] But you just believe what he said. He
[1:00:25] doesn't want words.
[1:00:30] By believing what he said and conducting
[1:00:33] myself with joy amidst the trials.
[1:00:38] You must have joy in the middle of your
[1:00:40] trials.
[1:00:42] Now let's test that. How many of us when
[1:00:44] you're going through the situation,
[1:00:46] somebody come ask you how you doing? You
[1:00:47] got joy. Hallelujah.
[1:00:51] You're only telling them about this
[1:00:52] problem and this and now you struggling
[1:00:55] with this thing. Bro, I can't make it.
[1:01:01] What is joy?
[1:01:03] Joy,
[1:01:05] Amen, is knowing the end result
[1:01:09] and you still remain in joy.
[1:01:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:16] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:01:17] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[1:01:20] come to pass.
[1:01:22] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:01:26] So, how many of you want divine
[1:01:29] character?
[1:01:33] Then allow the situations we go through
[1:01:35] to mold us.
[1:01:37] It's the only way character is
[1:01:39] developed.
[1:01:41] Because when we can develop that
[1:01:43] Christlike character,
[1:01:46] the power is already there.
[1:01:51] Brother Brandham says the power is
[1:01:53] already there. He's just working on our
[1:01:55] character
[1:01:57] so that we can learn to operate the
[1:01:59] power.
[1:02:04] Let's stand.
[1:02:08] Amen.
[1:02:14] I want to say again, we are not just
[1:02:16] preaching a sermon here.
[1:02:18] We are teaching you that out of divine
[1:02:21] nature will come divine character
[1:02:23] and out of divine character will come
[1:02:25] the divine power because we are right at
[1:02:28] the end now. The divine power must be on
[1:02:29] display and out of divine power you'll
[1:02:32] see the glory of sons and daughters.
[1:02:34] Hallelujah.
[1:02:36] Now remember I'm going to say this. The
[1:02:38] power is not for our own validation.
[1:02:42] And that's where we need character
[1:02:45] because as soon as a man is I pray for
[1:02:47] brother Caleb and he gets healed, the
[1:02:49] moment I try to draw that attention to
[1:02:51] me, that's wrong.
[1:02:55] Listen to those pastors. Listen to those
[1:02:57] evangelists, teachers, prophets,
[1:03:00] apostles. The moment we try and take
[1:03:03] credit for ourselves, it's showing the
[1:03:05] character is wrong.
[1:03:08] then we're not foo to rule.
[1:03:11] The moment a pastor keeps saying I I I I
[1:03:13] I something is wrong.
[1:03:18] Trying to draw all the attention to
[1:03:19] himself, something is wrong.
[1:03:24] What is the power for? The power is to
[1:03:28] show and give him glory.
[1:03:32] It's all for his glory. Amen. So if you
[1:03:36] ever see somebody doing that, know that
[1:03:39] their motive is wrong. Their character
[1:03:41] is wrong. They haven't developed
[1:03:43] properly. Amen. Let's sing a song. Amen.
[1:03:46] If you can give me E, we'll sing a song.
[1:03:48] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:53] You can put up the song, Brother Josh.
[1:03:55] Amen. While the world looks upon me as I
[1:04:01] struggle
[1:04:04] along,
[1:04:06] they say I
[1:04:09] have nothing.
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:11] But they are so wrong.
[1:04:16] Cuz in my heart
[1:04:19] I'm rejoicing.
[1:04:22] How I wish they could see.
[1:04:27] So, thank
[1:04:29] you, Lord,
[1:04:32] for your blessings
[1:04:35] on me.
[1:04:38] There's a roof
[1:04:40] up above me.
[1:04:43] I have a good place
[1:04:45] to sleep.
[1:04:48] There's food on
[1:04:51] my table
[1:04:54] and shoes on my feet.
[1:04:59] You gave me your love, Lord,
[1:05:04] and a fine family.
[1:05:10] So thank
[1:05:12] you Lord
[1:05:15] for your blessings
[1:05:18] on me.
[1:05:20] Although I'm not wealthy
[1:05:25] and these clothes
[1:05:28] they not new.
[1:05:31] I don't have
[1:05:34] much money,
[1:05:36] but Lord, I have you.
[1:05:41] To me, that's all that matters.
[1:05:47] Though the world may not see,
[1:05:52] but thank
[1:05:54] you, Lord,
[1:05:57] for your blessings.
[1:06:00] Oh, can we just thank the Lord now and
[1:06:02] sing? There's a roof up above me.
[1:06:08] I have a good place
[1:06:10] to sleep.
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:13] There's food on
[1:06:16] my table
[1:06:18] and shoes on my feet.
[1:06:24] You gave me your love, Lord,
[1:06:29] and a fine family.
[1:06:34] So, thank
[1:06:36] you, Lord.
[1:06:40] One more time. Let's sing the chorus one
[1:06:42] more time. There's a roof. There's a
[1:06:45] roof
[1:06:47] up above me.
[1:06:50] I have a good place
[1:06:52] to sleep.
[1:06:55] There's food on my table,
[1:07:01] shoes on.
[1:07:06] You gave me your love, Lord,
[1:07:11] and a fine family.
[1:07:16] So thank
[1:07:18] you Lord
[1:07:21] for your blessings.
[1:07:24] Amen. While the music plays, let's just
[1:07:26] worship the Lord and talk to him. Just
[1:07:27] begin to thank father. Amen. No matter
[1:07:30] how weward we were, the father wants you
[1:07:32] to come to adoption. The father wants to
[1:07:34] put his robe upon you. The father wants
[1:07:37] to put his ring on your finger. The
[1:07:39] father wants to put his shoe on your
[1:07:40] feet.
[1:07:42] The father has an expectation of us that
[1:07:44] when we are coming back, our character
[1:07:46] has been molded. Our character has been
[1:07:49] shaped. Our character has been
[1:07:51] developed. Under much trial, under much
[1:07:54] situations, the Lord has molded our
[1:07:57] character.
[1:07:59] Oh, we thank you Lord
[1:08:02] that this bride has come forth like
[1:08:03] beaten gold. Oh God, you have beaten us.
[1:08:07] Oh God, taking out all the dust, Father,
[1:08:10] until you can see your reflection in us,
[1:08:12] oh God, how we love you, how we
[1:08:14] appreciate you, Lord. Lord, through your
[1:08:16] divine providence, through your divine
[1:08:19] Lord, for knowledge, you know how to
[1:08:22] mold us. You are the divine architect,
[1:08:25] oh God, you know what to do in our
[1:08:27] lives, oh God, you know how to get this
[1:08:30] great character out of us, Lord Jesus.
[1:08:33] This is not a character of the earth.
[1:08:35] This is divine character. This is
[1:08:37] godlike character. This is back in your
[1:08:40] image and likeness.
[1:08:43] We thank you Lord that your character is
[1:08:46] love.
[1:08:48] Your character is all patience.
[1:08:52] Your character is gentleness. Your
[1:08:54] character is meekness. Your character is
[1:08:57] longsuffering. Oh God. Thank you Lord.
[1:08:59] And these are the character developments
[1:09:00] that we have in our own lives. Oh God,
[1:09:03] help us to be longsuffering. Help us to
[1:09:05] have love. Help us to have joy. Help us
[1:09:08] to have faith. Oh God, help us to
[1:09:10] develop this character. Oh God.
[1:09:14] Oh yes. Lord, help us to learn the
[1:09:17] lessons when you are taking us through
[1:09:18] our great trials. Oh God, help us to
[1:09:21] learn these lessons when you are taking
[1:09:22] us through our testings. Oh God.
[1:09:26] Oh yes, Jesus. Thank you Lord. Through
[1:09:29] sicknesses
[1:09:32] we bless you. Oh, through heartaches,
[1:09:34] through pain, through suffering,
[1:09:37] we endure it all. We say the sufferings
[1:09:40] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:09:42] be compared to the glory that shall be
[1:09:44] revealed in us.
[1:09:48] Thank you, Lord, for your divine
[1:09:50] architect,
[1:09:52] your plan, your purpose. Oh God, thank
[1:09:54] you for healing. Forgive us if we've
[1:09:56] questioned you. Forgive us if we've said
[1:09:58] why. Oh God, forgive us Lord if we
[1:10:00] didn't understand it along the way. Oh
[1:10:02] God and all the along you were molding
[1:10:05] and shaping our character Lord
[1:10:09] to train us Lord Jesus. Thank you
[1:10:11] Father. Father we repent. We come back
[1:10:13] with repentance Lord. We don't come back
[1:10:16] with pride. We come back with
[1:10:17] repentance. Forgive us father for we
[1:10:20] have sinned against heaven. We have
[1:10:22] questioned you. We have done thing
[1:10:23] against you. Forgive us Lord.
[1:10:29] Oh Jesus.
[1:10:33] Thank you for the garment, Lord.
[1:10:36] Thank you for the embrace.
[1:10:39] Thank you for the kiss, oh God. Thank
[1:10:41] you, Lord.
[1:10:44] Oh, the Bible says
[1:10:47] that the father ran toward the son.
[1:10:50] Father wants to see you make an effort
[1:10:52] to come towards him. Amen. The Bible
[1:10:54] says when he saw him a far off,
[1:10:57] he ran.
[1:10:59] He ran to his son.
[1:11:03] Oh, feel his embrace this morning. Feel
[1:11:06] his kiss upon your neck.
[1:11:09] Hallelujah.
[1:11:11] Hear the father's words now. This is my
[1:11:14] beloved son. Amen. In whom I am well
[1:11:18] pleased. Thank you. Hear he him. Thank
[1:11:21] you, Lord. You have come to your
[1:11:22] adoption church.
[1:11:24] You have come to your adoption ceremony.
[1:11:27] Oh yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Oh yes.
[1:11:31] Lord, now you're not relying on your own
[1:11:33] strength. The father has taken full
[1:11:36] control. He's commanding servants, bring
[1:11:38] the fatted calf. Oh yes. He's saying
[1:11:41] bring the robe. Bring the ring. Thank
[1:11:42] you. You got no say in it. Thank you.
[1:11:46] You've been through your experiences.
[1:11:48] You've been through your trials. Thank
[1:11:49] you, Lord. Now enjoy the benefits of
[1:11:51] being placed as a son. Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:54] Now's the time to write checks.
[1:11:57] Now's the time to hire who you want to
[1:11:59] hire and fire who you want to fire.
[1:12:02] Now's the time, church.
[1:12:06] Glory. Glory. Glory. Amen. Anyone wants
[1:12:09] to be remembered in prayer, you can
[1:12:10] raise your hand.
[1:12:12] We understand services like this. Amen.
[1:12:15] Every eyes closed and every head bowed.
[1:12:17] Remember it's the tutor that reminded
[1:12:19] the boy
[1:12:22] because Jesus said in St. John 16 when
[1:12:25] he the spirit of truth and will come he
[1:12:28] will bring things to your remembrance.
[1:12:30] So it was the Holy Ghost that was
[1:12:32] bringing things back to the boy's
[1:12:33] remembrance.
[1:12:36] Even now the Holy Ghost is working in
[1:12:38] your heart. Son,
[1:12:40] son and daughter,
[1:12:42] why you want to live your life
[1:12:43] disconnected from Jesus,
[1:12:46] disconnected from father's resources?
[1:12:49] Don't attach yourself to citizens of the
[1:12:50] country. Come back to father's house. Be
[1:12:54] attached to the main source.
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:02] You just have that altar in your heart
[1:13:04] right now. Nobody's looking around.
[1:13:06] Nobody's going to make fun of you.
[1:13:07] Nobody's going to say, "Oh, look at this
[1:13:09] person raising their hand with that
[1:13:10] person." The Bible says over one that
[1:13:13] comes back to the father's house. The
[1:13:15] angels in heaven rejoice.
[1:13:18] If the angels are rejoicing, be assured
[1:13:20] we are rejoicing.
[1:13:23] Make a commitment in your heart right
[1:13:25] now that from this day forward you will
[1:13:28] have no other god be beside our Lord God
[1:13:31] Almighty. You will serve no other God.
[1:13:36] Put God first in all your decisions.
[1:13:39] Choose to serve him.
[1:13:42] Some of us have been all have been
[1:13:45] handling our trials and tests wrong.
[1:13:48] Therefore, God has us in that holding
[1:13:50] pattern.
[1:13:52] How many of you know you can speak to
[1:13:53] your mountain?
[1:13:56] How many of you know you speak to the
[1:13:57] Red Sea and then when you're gone
[1:13:59] through you close the Red Sea?
[1:14:04] God wants you to have total deliverance
[1:14:07] and faith is the victory right now that
[1:14:09] will overcome it.
[1:14:14] Father, we come before you, Lord. Yes,
[1:14:16] Lord.
[1:14:19] Lord, we repentance. Oh God,
[1:14:22] we all have sinned and come short of the
[1:14:24] glory of God.
[1:14:26] So, Father, I just feel Lord to say,
[1:14:28] Lord, we are sorry, Lord Jesus.
[1:14:31] Sometimes in ignorance, we do things
[1:14:33] that displease you, Father. And we are
[1:14:36] we want to say, Lord, we are sorry. We
[1:14:38] repent. We have sinned against heaven,
[1:14:41] oh God.
[1:14:43] We ask you, Lord, to forgive us and wash
[1:14:45] us in that precious sacrificial blood of
[1:14:48] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:51] Restore us a new, oh God.
[1:14:54] We close doors behind us. We close the
[1:14:56] ocean behind us.
[1:14:59] We chop off Goliath's head right now.
[1:15:02] Amen.
[1:15:07] Father, even as we come back to your
[1:15:09] kingdom,
[1:15:11] fill us with your Holy Ghost, oh God.
[1:15:13] Amen.
[1:15:15] Fill us, oh God. And I pray, Lord, we'll
[1:15:18] start to develop a great love for your
[1:15:20] word and for your things of God.
[1:15:24] Help us to start, oh God, by reading
[1:15:26] your word. Yes. Getting back into the
[1:15:29] messages of the hour. Getting back to
[1:15:32] prayer life. Yes. getting back to a
[1:15:34] sincere consecration with God.
[1:15:39] And I pray Lord that you will keep us by
[1:15:41] your grace, oh God, all around us,
[1:15:44] Father, is famine, is darkness,
[1:15:48] is nakedness, oh God, but we want to
[1:15:50] come into the headstone, oh God, we want
[1:15:53] to come right into your headstone,
[1:15:55] Father, where the shout is going on to
[1:15:59] be united with the bridegroom.
[1:16:01] Forgive us our faults and our failures,
[1:16:04] our shortcomings. Forgive us if we've
[1:16:06] questioned why.
[1:16:08] I pray Lord from this day forward.
[1:16:13] We will follow holy after you Lord
[1:16:15] Jesus. I love you. I appreciate you.
[1:16:18] Lord, I thank you for this congregation.
[1:16:20] Lord,
[1:16:22] sincere in their hearts, oh God,
[1:16:24] they love you. They appreciate you,
[1:16:26] Father.
[1:16:28] We say thank you, Father.
[1:16:30] We ask these blessings now in the mighty
[1:16:32] name. Lord, we also remember sister
[1:16:34] Davyi, sister Grace.
[1:16:38] We pray Lord that your healing virtues
[1:16:39] will flow through their bodies. Make
[1:16:40] them every withhold.
[1:16:43] Your word has declared that they are
[1:16:44] already healed. Amen. And we thank you
[1:16:46] for their healing in Jesus name.
[1:16:49] We give you praise for it. Thank you
[1:16:51] Jesus. Amen.
