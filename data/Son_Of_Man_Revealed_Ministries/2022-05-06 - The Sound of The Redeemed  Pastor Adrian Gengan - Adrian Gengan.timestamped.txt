[11:18] sound of the redeemed
[11:20] the redeemed away sound amen
[11:22] the redeemed have a point of access to
[11:24] the lord amen so let's turn to psalm 149
[11:29] we go to the chief psalmist david
[11:32] amen
[11:34] psalm 149 and verse 1
[11:37] says praise he the lord
[11:39] sing unto the lord a new song
[11:42] and his praise in the congregation of
[11:44] the saints
[11:46] that's what we've just been doing amen
[11:48] in the congregation of the saints let
[11:51] israel rejoice in him that made him what
[11:54] is he saying worship him as creator
[11:58] let israel rejoice in him that made him
[12:01] not only as creator now
[12:04] let the children of zion be joyful in
[12:06] their king amen
[12:08] he's our creator he's our king let them
[12:11] praise his name in the dance
[12:15] some of us are lacking in that amen but
[12:17] praise him in the dance amen
[12:21] let them sing praises unto him with the
[12:23] timbrel and the heart
[12:26] for the lord taketh pleasure in his
[12:28] people
[12:29] amen the lord takes pleasure in our
[12:31] worship
[12:33] he will beautify the meek with salvation
[12:37] for the lord take it okay so we read
[12:39] that let the saints be joyful in glory
[12:43] amen let them sing aloud upon their
[12:46] beards
[12:47] yes
[12:48] let them wander upon their beds
[12:51] let them sing aloud
[12:53] upon their beds
[12:55] let the high praises of god be in their
[12:58] mouth
[12:59] and a two-edged sword in their hand
[13:02] amen
[13:03] even in your bed you got the praises of
[13:05] god in your mouth
[13:07] the word of the lord in your hand amen
[13:09] because the devil might come to attack
[13:11] you in the night time
[13:13] amen
[13:14] now watch
[13:16] follow a strain of thought now the one
[13:18] the redeemed that's got the high praises
[13:20] of god in their mouth and the two-edged
[13:22] sword in the hand they're going to use
[13:24] it let's see what they're using it for
[13:26] to execute vengeance upon the eden
[13:31] look at what praise does
[13:34] and punishments upon the people
[13:36] to bind up their kings with chains these
[13:39] are not earthly kings
[13:40] but these are supernatural demons that
[13:43] come to torment us you binding them up
[13:45] with chains and their nobles these small
[13:48] little demons with fetals of iron
[13:51] to execute upon them judgment written
[13:54] this honor and all the saints this is
[13:57] the honor given to the saints
[13:59] praise he the
[14:05] amen
[14:07] hallelujah
[14:09] how many of you know david was writing
[14:10] in prophecy amen amen john 4 23 this is
[14:15] the discourse between the lord and the
[14:17] woman at the well we're just going to
[14:18] pick it up from verse 23 where jesus is
[14:22] telling her the hour cometh and now is
[14:27] now jesus mentioned that 2000 years ago
[14:29] but i'm saying the hour now is
[14:32] when true worshipers
[14:34] shall worship the father in spirit and
[14:38] in truth
[14:39] for the father seeketh such to worship
[14:42] him
[14:45] god is a spirit and they that worship
[14:48] him must worship him in spirit and in
[14:52] truth amen let's go to the lord in
[14:54] prayer father we thank you lord for the
[14:56] victory that we have in your presence oh
[14:58] god we thank you for the overcoming
[15:00] power that you have given us this

[15:04] house this morning and lord we come to
[15:06] this part of the service oh god where
[15:08] lord we will hear your word and we know
[15:10] that faith cometh by the hearing of the
[15:12] word and father i pray lord that the
[15:15] word will come now and lord put us in
[15:17] our place lord where we should be in our
[15:20] praise and our worship towards you oh
[15:22] god and father we may you establish us

[15:29] have given us lord jesus we commit to
[15:31] hear o lord we commit lord myself before

[15:37] emotional god another outpouring of your
[15:40] spirit lord and i pray you'll meet us at
[15:42] the point of our need we commit the
[15:44] servants into your hands and father pray
[15:46] you'll heal the sick now father lord
[15:48] lift them up out of the condition of god
[15:50] so father they'll be able to hear the
[15:52] word of the lord this morning we ask his
[15:55] blessings and we love you we say lord
[15:58] come now
[15:59] our hearts we ask his blessings in the
[16:01] name of our lord and savior jesus christ
[16:03] amen amen you may be
[16:06] seated amen so i'd like you to invite
[16:09] you this morning
[16:11] if you had plans this morning i want you
[16:13] to cancel your plans to be miserable
[16:19] some of us maybe have plans to come into
[16:20] the house of the lord and just be
[16:22] miserable but cancel those plans
[16:26] amen
[16:27] cancel those plans to be sad this
[16:29] morning
[16:30] cancel your plans amen to not be
[16:33] involved in the service this morning
[16:36] cancel your plans i'll just go and hear
[16:38] what they're going to see this morning
[16:40] amen but get involved with the service
[16:44] how many of you know you know when
[16:45] you're watching anything on a television
[16:48] you got a remote and you are able to
[16:51] operate the gift
[16:55] there might be 50 channels
[16:57] but you've got the remote to operate
[16:59] those 50 channels
[17:01] who operates the gift behind the purpose
[17:04] amen
[17:05] amen
[17:07] come on now
[17:09] who operates the gift behind the pulpit
[17:12] so if you got a knee this morning
[17:14] and you're going to tell the lord lord i
[17:16] need to go to acts 238 you operated
[17:19] there on your channel on your remote
[17:21] amen and the lord can transmit it to the
[17:24] minister
[17:25] and you operate the gift amen but you
[17:28] got to say in amen when you're operating
[17:30] the gift amen hallelujah hallelujah we
[17:33] ought to be happy in the house of the
[17:34] lord
[17:35] amen the children of god are joyful in
[17:38] the house of the lord amen amen so the
[17:41] sound of the redeemed
[17:44] redeemed now i'm not talking about just
[17:46] any person that's giving praise and
[17:47] worship
[17:49] i am talking about the sound of the
[17:52] redeemed sons and daughters of god amen
[17:55] them that are filled with the holy
[17:58] ghost this is what this is directed to
[18:02] or who it is directed to
[18:04] our point of this morning message is not
[18:07] to insult somebody else we may contrast
[18:10] it but it's not to
[18:12] insult anyone or to tear anybody else's
[18:14] worship down
[18:16] we are trying to focus on the redeemed
[18:18] as a sound that is pleasing to the hear
[18:21] of the lord
[18:23] because the bible says that the father
[18:25] is seeking
[18:28] this kind of worship is not flowing out
[18:30] in abundance yes
[18:32] but it says the father is seeking their
[18:36] worship in spirit and in truth amen
[18:40] truth only came at the end time
[18:44] the outpouring of the holy ghost in its
[18:46] fullness only came in the end time so
[18:49] now is the time
[18:52] when true worshipers can worship in
[18:55] spirit and in truth
[18:57] now how do we we describe this worship
[19:00] this praise to the lord
[19:02] this kind of access that we have to this
[19:04] dimension praise and worship is an
[19:07] excess that we have that opens up the
[19:09] access to the heavenly realm
[19:12] which is the supernatural world
[19:15] we can be seated here this morning in a
[19:18] three-dimensional world
[19:20] and without a rocket ship without a
[19:22] space suit our voice can travel and
[19:25] reach the highest of heavens
[19:29] now just to put into context what we
[19:31] just did for the younger people they may
[19:33] be thinking why do we go to church and
[19:35] just sing
[19:37] our voices are we going from here
[19:40] and it's reaching the heavens where god
[19:42] is
[19:44] amen it's reaching the highest of
[19:47] heavens this worship is not going to the
[19:50] sixth dimension
[19:52] it is not directed to the sixth
[19:54] dimension
[19:55] this worship is directed to the seventh
[19:58] dimension where god is
[20:01] amen
[20:03] now god is an object of worship so we
[20:05] must worship him
[20:07] so without anything we can transcend
[20:10] this three-dimensional world and enter
[20:12] our voice can enter that seventh
[20:14] dimension amen
[20:16] amen
[20:18] now heaven loves it when we worship
[20:21] america but at the same time there are
[20:23] two things happening
[20:25] while heaven is loving the sound of our
[20:27] worship the sound of the redeemed
[20:30] hell is being tormented
[20:34] you want to torment the devil stop
[20:37] praising the lord
[20:39] amen if you're sick i'm if you're sick
[20:42] and tired of the devil how many of you
[20:43] are sick and tired of demon powers amen
[20:46] stop praising the lord
[20:49] amen when people begin to call in the
[20:52] name of the lord
[20:54] he cannot operate in the atmosphere of
[20:56] faith
[20:59] amen even if the person may have been
[21:01] possessed with a demon when he starts to
[21:03] praise the lord and he starts to sing
[21:05] the hallelujahs that demon spirit leaves
[21:08] him
[21:09] amen
[21:10] amen so when we begin to call on the
[21:13] name of the lord and we make a positive
[21:16] confession
[21:18] he is defeated satan and his demon
[21:21] powers are defeated he is powerless when
[21:24] we use the name of the lord jesus
[21:27] because just the mention of jesus demons
[21:30] bow at that name
[21:32] amen he has to flee he hates it so much
[21:35] that he has to flee
[21:38] amen
[21:40] amen this kind of sound that is coming
[21:43] out of the redeem annihilates the enemy
[21:46] in an atomic warfare it's like atomic
[21:49] bombs blasting the kingdom of hell
[21:52] but in the eyes of god it's beautiful
[21:54] sounds of worship coming into heaven
[21:58] amen one sound yes
[22:01] but two different
[22:03] amen
[22:05] end
[22:06] to it one is going into the eternal
[22:08] realm and glorifying the name of the
[22:10] lord and the other one is sending bombs
[22:13] to hell
[22:15] amen with one action
[22:17] hallelujah
[22:19] now what does praise i don't know if you
[22:21] know what a force field is
[22:23] ask autumn what a force field is she's
[22:25] always telling me about a force field
[22:27] i didn't even know what a force field is
[22:29] hey man if you know what a force field
[22:31] is
[22:32] it's a field maybe brother caleb might
[22:35] be able to describe this much better
[22:36] with his electronic
[22:38] knowledge amen electricity it's a force
[22:41] field right
[22:42] something like that but nothing can
[22:44] enter you praise and worship is a force
[22:46] field around you amen
[22:49] amen
[22:50] hallelujah
[22:52] now we have got to
[22:54] okay we'll go into it slowly
[22:56] because
[22:58] the false feel is only activated through
[23:00] faith amen yes
[23:02] all right now when you praise the lord
[23:05] according to god's word
[23:07] which we believe we are doing according
[23:09] to his word
[23:10] you can expect your enemy to fall this
[23:13] morning
[23:15] let's turn to psalm 98 and verse 4 we'll
[23:17] just go through a few scriptures now the
[23:20] bible says make a joyful sound
[23:24] a joyful noise
[23:26] amen people may be wondering why you're
[23:28] making a noise but we are making a
[23:31] joyful noise
[23:33] amen
[23:34] yeah what
[23:35] king david is saying here make a joyful
[23:38] noise unto the lord
[23:40] all the earth
[23:42] make
[23:43] a small noise
[23:48] am i reading it right
[23:50] okay
[23:52] make a loud noise
[23:54] and rejoice
[23:56] and sing praise
[23:59] sing to the lord with the heart
[24:02] and with the voice of islam
[24:05] with trumpets
[24:07] and the sound of cornet
[24:09] make a joyful noise before the lord the
[24:11] king
[24:13] now listen to the next verse watch how
[24:15] the sea roars is it a small voice the
[24:18] raw of the ocean
[24:20] he says let me see raw
[24:23] amen every time you go to the ocean and
[24:25] hear it roaring they are worshiping the
[24:28] lord
[24:30] because they are fulfilling their
[24:31] purpose
[24:34] and the fullness they of the world and
[24:37] they that dwell therein
[24:42] oh even the floods that came it says let
[24:44] the floods clap their hands
[24:46] [Music]
[24:48] just the rush of that water in the
[24:50] floods
[24:52] is fulfilling god's purpose
[24:56] let the heroes be joyful together before
[24:59] the lord for he cometh to judge the
[25:01] earth with righteousness shall he judge
[25:04] the world and the people with equity
[25:08] amen
[25:09] now how if you know that your vocal
[25:11] cords your voice is a vibration
[25:14] there's a vibration taking place in your
[25:17] vocal cords and it's producing a sound
[25:22] so what is a shout
[25:25] now we're not talking about the three
[25:28] stages of the rapture right now
[25:30] i'm asking you what is a shout because
[25:32] some of you are going to tell me it's a
[25:33] message going forth
[25:35] to gather the living saints because
[25:37] you're so well taught in what the shout
[25:39] is but i'm asking you
[25:41] what is a shout
[25:45] it's the loudest sound a person can make
[25:51] amen
[25:52] when a baby cries at the top of his
[25:54] voice it gets attention
[25:58] according to the baby it's shouting
[26:02] amen
[26:03] and the mother responds to the cry of
[26:05] the baby
[26:06] it's a loud cry
[26:09] [Music]
[26:11] the shout when somebody is in need of
[26:14] help
[26:15] they say
[26:18] hell
[26:20] nobody's gonna hear them
[26:24] when somebody's in a desperate need for
[26:26] help
[26:27] they're screaming help
[26:30] amen amen
[26:33] they want to get somebody's attention
[26:36] i know some of you thinking i'm waking
[26:38] up from your sleep this morning no time
[26:39] to sleep this morning in the house of
[26:41] the lord amen amen
[26:43] [Music]
[26:44] some of us getting settled in our chair
[26:47] and now the spas is shouting here
[26:50] amen a shout is a loud noise
[26:53] but that's what the bible is saying
[26:55] shout to the lord
[27:00] amen
[27:02] when somebody's in need of help they
[27:04] don't whisper they shout they cry out
[27:07] for help
[27:08] now when a lion roars why is he roaring
[27:12] and lying in his in the terms of a shout
[27:14] he is shouting
[27:16] he is roaring
[27:18] what is he doing his voice thunders
[27:21] through the forest
[27:24] through the jungle that voice rips
[27:26] through every tree
[27:29] it establishes his territory with his
[27:32] shout
[27:33] he's telling them i am the king of the
[27:36] jungle amen
[27:40] to that shout he is controlling and he's
[27:42] telling everyone that i am the master of
[27:45] this territory
[27:47] now when god created adam what did he
[27:49] tell him
[27:50] have dominion over the earth
[27:53] amen
[27:55] through the rule of dominion when man
[27:57] shouts
[27:59] it establishes his territory that we are
[28:01] supposed to be controlling
[28:04] the realm of the spirit world
[28:09] amen
[28:12] man is far superior than a lion so we he
[28:15] cry his praise and his worship is
[28:18] establishing dominion over his territory
[28:22] the shout represents the core of one's
[28:25] energy
[28:28] it's not a stifled cry
[28:31] but when you shout you are shouting from
[28:33] the core
[28:39] the call of your strength
[28:41] now you cannot praise the lord without
[28:44] getting your five senses involved
[28:48] amen right
[28:51] when the spirit man is truly don't be
[28:53] like
[28:54] i'm worshiping in my spirit now
[28:59] no
[29:01] the spirit man activates
[29:04] the five senses
[29:06] then we shout
[29:07] shout using the vocal cords then we lift
[29:10] our hands
[29:11] then we dance amen we jump
[29:14] hallelujah
[29:16] amen
[29:17] we cannot praise the lord without using
[29:21] our human emotions
[29:25] the life energy force that takes
[29:28] dominion amen the life energy force
[29:31] comes out from within us and takes to
[29:34] minion
[29:35] and whoever is hearing the shout
[29:37] it changes the atmosphere
[29:40] all the other animals go quiet in the
[29:43] jungle
[29:44] because they're lying at work
[29:46] yes
[29:49] even when it's a shock for help doesn't
[29:51] it change the atmosphere
[29:53] you get concerned who's shouting for
[29:55] help
[29:56] it changes the atmosphere
[29:59] but can you imagine when we shout unto
[30:01] god
[30:02] how it changes the atmosphere amen
[30:05] amen
[30:10] that is why religion does not want you
[30:13] to shout
[30:15] religion thrives on bondage
[30:20] how many of you know dead men don't
[30:21] shout
[30:27] neither do dead christians
[30:32] amen
[30:34] and now if you know the closer you get
[30:36] to dying
[30:38] the smaller the sound you make
[30:44] think about that
[30:49] it ends up
[30:51] in a whisper
[30:52] the person what did he say with his last
[30:54] breath you have to go near him
[31:00] what did he say so the closer you get to
[31:03] dying the sound becomes
[31:05] smaller
[31:10] psalm 115 verse 17
[31:15] psalm 115 17
[31:17] amen
[31:18] listen what david says
[31:21] the dead do not praise the lord
[31:24] nor do any who go down into silence
[31:29] can you see the ones who don't praise
[31:30] the lord that's the only one excluded
[31:36] the dead do not praise the lord
[31:39] neither do any that go down in silence
[31:44] so while we have our breath amen the
[31:47] redeemed has a sound
[31:50] amen amen
[31:51] now if you go to a game i know lots of
[31:54] people in this church love soccer
[31:57] i'm not gonna blast you this morning
[31:58] about soccer but i'm gonna use it this
[32:00] morning as an example
[32:03] okay if you go to the to a game of
[32:05] soccer
[32:07] and your team scores
[32:10] the fans go hysterical
[32:15] do i have everyone's attention
[32:17] amen
[32:21] do i have everyone's attention
[32:23] amen
[32:24] god is greater than liverpool
[32:27] because he's in a league of his own
[32:33] amen
[32:34] god is greater than liverpool he's in
[32:36] his own league
[32:38] amen he's higher than the highest
[32:40] greater than the greatest
[32:42] now got your attention now if you go to
[32:44] a ball game
[32:46] and the team scores
[32:48] they in the stadium
[32:50] they erupt
[32:52] shouts of joy
[32:54] they hug one another up and down hey
[33:00] they blow their trumpet their vazelas
[33:03] this madness hysteria the soccer players
[33:06] jump on one another
[33:08] 10 guys going through one guy
[33:12] have you seen that
[33:14] nobody okay just go onto youtube if you
[33:16] don't watch soccer and you'll see it i
[33:18] know some of you don't watch
[33:20] you see they go hysterical
[33:23] they go ballistic shouting
[33:26] but you know not everyone in the stadium
[33:27] is shouting
[33:32] the spectate there's a spectator in that
[33:34] audience
[33:36] and he doesn't support any side he's
[33:38] just a spectator
[33:40] so he's not moved
[33:42] he's just there to watch the game
[33:46] maybe to please a boyfriend or a husband
[33:49] she's not interested in soccer she just
[33:51] attended the match
[33:53] so she is not moved she's a spectator
[33:55] she's looking at alpha jumping up and
[33:57] down like a crazy man
[34:01] right
[34:03] so just like that spectators in god's
[34:06] arena
[34:08] just hold their hands
[34:10] just sit down
[34:14] and are not involved in the sound of the
[34:16] redeemed
[34:20] now it's not only happening there in the
[34:22] stadium if the game is live
[34:24] in your house things are getting thrown
[34:26] people go switch off the tv
[34:28] people kick things
[34:30] they shout at one another in the
[34:32] something that is happening
[34:34] thousands of miles across the world
[34:36] creates an emotional reaction within you
[34:40] if you could you would even slap that
[34:41] person sitting next to you because he's
[34:43] mocking you now
[34:45] that's the anger that builds up inside
[34:47] of you anyone can relate
[34:51] you know what i'm saying it's happening
[34:53] there but it's creating an atmosphere
[34:55] change in your house
[34:58] that's how it falls people up now i just
[35:01] showed you the two worlds so think of
[35:02] how this is now our worship is
[35:04] connecting to heaven amen
[35:07] liverpool is playing manchester united
[35:09] there
[35:10] in
[35:11] i don't know the names of their stadiums
[35:13] but they're playing it there but you are
[35:14] affected in your house not only you but
[35:17] in every bar room in every home
[35:20] people are going crazy
[35:25] now
[35:26] the bigger the play
[35:28] this is not just to do a soccer now but
[35:31] let's let's take it in terms of soccer
[35:32] if the goal is more difficult to score
[35:35] the greater the sound
[35:38] am i right
[35:40] if it was an easy goal it's probably not
[35:42] that but when it's a fantastic goal
[35:45] say messi i know some of you don't like
[35:47] myths say ronaldo whoever you like
[35:49] you're scoring
[35:50] and he curves that ball
[35:54] the greater the play
[35:57] the greater the sound of the applause
[36:00] amen think about it when the team is
[36:03] down beyond points and they come at the
[36:05] last the whistle is blowing and they
[36:07] score
[36:08] how does that stadium erupt
[36:12] amen
[36:14] the bigger the play the greater the
[36:15] shout
[36:16] out now god has made his biggest play
[36:18] yet at the end time
[36:21] god has made his biggest move yeah the
[36:23] end time how much more the
[36:26] [Music]
[36:30] amen
[36:34] i i just want to mention this i'm
[36:36] talking about you this morning because
[36:38] i'm see some people still not getting
[36:39] involved
[36:41] they thought i'm talking about somebody
[36:43] else this morning
[36:44] i'm talking about us yeah this church
[36:48] we need to get involved praise the lord
[36:52] amen now if we do not get
[36:56] physically involved in the worship
[36:57] service in the praising and even in the
[37:00] preaching by saying amen and hallelujah
[37:03] and thank you jesus amen then we are
[37:06] just expecting the service we never clap
[37:09] we never shout we never sing we never
[37:12] get involved we never testify
[37:15] amen we never ever get involved
[37:18] we come in defeated and we go out
[37:20] defeated
[37:22] amen but the person you can line up
[37:24] deuteronomy 28 and verse 6 but a person
[37:26] who understands the value of praise and
[37:29] worship under understands what it is to
[37:32] come with the sound of the regime now
[37:36] remember my thought is it must come from
[37:38] the innermost being it must be the sound
[37:41] of the regime
[37:44] then you'll be blessed coming in
[37:46] here's the scripture and you'll be
[37:48] blessed going out
[37:50] blessed shall thou be when thou come
[37:52] again oh you're blessed i'm rejoicing
[37:55] night and day amen as i walk the snare
[37:58] away
[38:00] and you'll be blessed when you're going
[38:02] out
[38:03] our hearts burn within us had you spoke
[38:06] along the way
[38:08] bless you'll be coming in and bless your
[38:10] be going out
[38:12] amen amen hallelujah we understand that
[38:16] heaven responds to a certain sound even
[38:20] responds to the sound of the redeemed
[38:23] that is worshiping in spirit and in
[38:25] truth
[38:27] now the person playing an instrument
[38:31] this guitar cannot play itself
[38:34] that note that you are hearing
[38:36] it is coming from the depths of that
[38:38] musician
[38:40] he wants to express that certain note
[38:45] or when a trumpet is being blown
[38:48] the one that is blowing the trumpet has
[38:50] control over the trumpet
[38:52] what naughty wants to sound
[38:54] right
[38:55] you find many people can learn to play
[38:57] an instrument
[38:59] they can memorize chords and memorize
[39:02] solos and play and it will sound good
[39:06] but there is no but there is a
[39:08] difference now note there is a
[39:09] difference from somebody who has a
[39:12] gift because there were lots of other
[39:15] musicians in the time when king saul was
[39:17] tormented of a demon
[39:20] but he needed somebody who had the
[39:22] anointing
[39:25] every note that they plane is an
[39:27] expression
[39:29] it's a sound
[39:32] amen
[39:34] they become one with the instrument have
[39:36] you ever seen somebody lost in playing
[39:38] the
[39:38] instrument
[39:39] or they're just closing their eyes and
[39:41] they're playing and giving their best to
[39:43] the lord
[39:45] amen
[39:46] then you get those that are coming now
[39:48] for the show
[39:50] look at me
[39:52] hey guys i'm here look at me
[39:56] amen
[39:58] but it's coming from inside of them
[40:00] what's on the inside of me god had put
[40:03] it there but god wants to bring it out
[40:06] through that instrument amen now with
[40:08] this concept in mind though the one
[40:10] offering praise
[40:12] is not the praiser
[40:15] you become one with your praise you are
[40:17] no different from the sound that is
[40:19] coming up within you
[40:21] amen you become praise itself
[40:25] you become an instrument of worship
[40:28] lord make me
[40:30] an instrument
[40:31] an instrument
[40:33] of worship
[40:35] i lift up
[40:37] my hands in your name
[40:41] amen you become one with the instrument
[40:44] you are not just a worshiper but you are
[40:47] worship personified
[40:49] your every action is a is a worship to
[40:52] the lord
[40:54] amen
[40:56] what god puts in you controls your
[40:58] future the sound that's coming out of
[41:00] you is going to control your atmosphere
[41:03] it's going to control situations around
[41:05] you gonna control your destiny controls
[41:08] your victory it controls everything
[41:10] because out of the mouth
[41:13] get the life
[41:15] [Music]
[41:16] amen
[41:17] we are instruments we are made to
[41:20] worship
[41:21] wake up every morning with that
[41:23] realization what sound is coming out of
[41:26] you changes everything around you
[41:29] amen amen
[41:31] sounds of complaining and sounds of
[41:34] anger and sounds of sadness and sound of
[41:37] anxiety sounds of bitterness sounds of
[41:41] negativity should not be flowing out of
[41:44] your mouth when you wake up
[41:47] but when we arise in the morning i am
[41:50] blessed
[41:52] i am blessed
[41:54] every day
[41:56] that i live i am blessed
[41:59] when i wake up in the morning till i lay
[42:03] my head to rest
[42:06] i am blessed
[42:09] i am blessed
[42:11] now i want you to know we can't be
[42:13] humble in our praise
[42:15] we can't be humble in our worship we
[42:17] can't be shy we can't be conscious of
[42:20] self when we are worshipping
[42:24] we need to lose ourself in worship we
[42:27] need to be expressive
[42:29] i remember when i first started uh
[42:31] leading praise and worship and i thought
[42:33] i was doing so fantastic
[42:35] and then my father comes to me and
[42:37] saying
[42:38] why are you holding back
[42:41] you need to let go
[42:43] and worship the lord
[42:45] but amen and that taught me a lot in
[42:47] worship
[42:49] because
[42:50] honestly when somebody is first starting
[42:52] out you are self-conscious
[42:54] you are thinking everyone's eyes is on
[42:56] you
[42:57] and you are thinking they're thinking
[42:58] you're starting the song the wrong key
[43:00] and you're thinking this too many
[43:02] thoughts but when you get lost in
[43:03] worship you see what i've learned over
[43:06] the years in leading praise and worship
[43:08] if you are not worshiping here don't
[43:10] expect the people to worship there
[43:12] because you are leading them in praise
[43:14] and worship i find many times song
[43:16] leaders come and they say yeah i need
[43:18] you to back me up this is not your
[43:19] backup choir they are worshiping god you
[43:22] worship from the pulpit you worship god
[43:25] they are not here to pat you on your
[43:27] shoulder and give you an ego boost
[43:29] amen
[43:30] but from the pulpit you're worshiping
[43:32] the lord you're praising his name if
[43:35] there's nobody out there praising and
[43:36] worshiping it should be here because you
[43:39] are the prison worship leader
[43:43] imagine somebody going out to war on the
[43:45] captain of the army saying right kill
[43:46] them kill them and he's standing there
[43:48] chop that fellow there
[43:52] the captain must lead the army
[43:56] so we need to lose ourself in worship
[44:00] your mother and father don't care how
[44:02] you look when you come to church
[44:04] they're not going to think
[44:05] and scold you when you go home while you
[44:06] were raising your hand in church
[44:08] why were you singing in church
[44:11] why were you saying amen in church
[44:13] that's one time your parents will not
[44:15] scold you
[44:16] in the house if they tell you to shut up
[44:18] and sit quiet but not in the house of
[44:20] the lord they'll be excited amen that
[44:23] somebody is worshiping the lord amen
[44:28] let's turn to psalm 150
[44:30] amen
[44:32] psalm 150
[44:34] verse 1
[44:36] it says praise he the lord
[44:38] praise god in his sanctuary
[44:41] praise him in the firmament of his power
[44:44] praise him for his mighty acts if you're
[44:46] wondering what do i praise the lord for
[44:48] here's it praise him for his mighty acts
[44:51] praise him according to his excellent
[44:53] greatness
[44:54] amen
[44:56] god is not weak
[44:58] praise him for his greatness
[45:01] it's not just great but he's excellent
[45:04] greatness
[45:05] praise him with the sound of the trumpet
[45:08] amen praise him with the suntree and the
[45:10] up praise him with a timbrel and dance
[45:13] praise him with stringed instruments
[45:15] amen and organs
[45:19] amen praise him on the sounding symbols
[45:23] hallelujah
[45:27] keep the music
[45:30] quiet you know i'm not hearing problems
[45:37] what's happened with too many
[45:38] conservative people
[45:40] i'm not going to tell you where
[45:42] but too many conservative people are
[45:44] trying to control the worship
[45:47] and stifle the praise
[45:51] do you know
[45:52] why
[45:53] dude okay let me let me break it down
[45:55] for you who controlled music in heaven
[46:00] and who did he control the music for
[46:04] for
[46:06] god
[46:11] so he would know all about worship
[46:14] he would know what levels to play that
[46:16] how many of you know when he organizes
[46:18] these concerts
[46:20] the music is at a certain level
[46:22] because only when the music reaches a
[46:25] certain decibel does it penetrate into
[46:27] the spirit of man
[46:29] do you know that
[46:34] now when we come to church everything
[46:35] must be
[46:42] everything low
[46:44] one day you'll go low
[46:47] six feet low
[46:49] and then you'll wish you were high
[46:53] amen but he says praise him on the loud
[46:56] symbols
[46:58] praise him on the high sounding symbols
[47:01] there is a reason for reaching that
[47:04] pitch
[47:05] there is a reason for that
[47:07] that temple that praise that worship
[47:10] is to penetrate
[47:12] amen the atmosphere of spiritual
[47:15] wickedness and darkness
[47:17] how many of you went into a catholic
[47:19] church and the music is just like you
[47:21] know so don't you feel like you're in a
[47:23] tomb
[47:26] hey you feel like you're in authoria
[47:29] hey sometimes you go to the standpoint
[47:34] and
[47:35] don't you i feel uneasy
[47:38] sounds demonic
[47:40] and at five o'clock in the morning when
[47:42] the demon is crying
[47:43] he is shouting aloud
[47:48] hey
[47:49] is he making a stifle sound he is
[47:52] shouting
[47:56] i'm going to come out at one of your
[47:57] house each morning and shout and call
[47:58] you to pray
[48:01] every morning i'm going to make it how
[48:03] many if you would like that
[48:05] going to call your name
[48:09] some of you might not hear me till 10
[48:11] o'clock
[48:12] [Music]
[48:15] amen
[48:17] praise him on the loud symbols praise
[48:19] him on the high symbol
[48:20] let everything that i pray praise the
[48:24] lord
[48:25] this is not a option
[48:28] it's a command
[48:29] let everything that have breath praise
[48:32] the lord praise he the lord
[48:36] now he said that the father is seeking
[48:38] those that will worship in spirit and
[48:41] truth
[48:41] now
[48:42] your lawyers and your policemen and
[48:44] those of you that know the law if you do
[48:46] anything contrary to the law what is it
[48:50] ill
[48:51] legal
[48:53] is it legal to do something contrary to
[48:54] the law
[48:55] what is the word
[48:58] i just told you what is it
[49:01] it's illegal
[49:05] when we don't worship god according to
[49:08] god's word
[49:09] it is illegal
[49:14] if we don't worship in spirit and should
[49:17] it's illegal worship
[49:24] when you ask the church to praise the
[49:26] lord and it's a polite praise
[49:29] it's a stifled praise
[49:33] it's illegal praise
[49:35] that is not accepted
[49:38] what is the outcome of presenting an
[49:41] offering to the lord
[49:43] it must be accepted
[49:45] when they went to the lord with a
[49:46] sacrifice it must be accepted
[49:50] amen just worshiping is not just good
[49:52] enough
[49:53] you are waiting to see if it was
[49:55] accepted that is why they are waiting
[49:57] there in revelation 5 they are waiting
[49:59] amen
[50:01] is he accepted
[50:03] because he laid his life down on the
[50:04] cross and here he is the high priest
[50:06] making intercession for 2000 years and
[50:09] they're waiting for him to return from
[50:10] the sanctuary but they're all waiting
[50:12] with painted breath
[50:15] in revelation 5
[50:17] is it accepted
[50:19] and when it comes forth
[50:21] amen do you know how they cry out and
[50:23] break out into worship
[50:24] amen
[50:26] amen because it was accepted sacrifice
[50:31] amen for when you ask the church to
[50:33] praise and worship the lord i need to
[50:35] polite praise a stifle praise it's
[50:38] illegal praise its illegal worship
[50:42] god is not impressed by worship alone
[50:45] he is specific about what he is looking
[50:48] for
[50:49] many people on the earth are worshiping
[50:52] and from the outside it might look
[50:54] beautiful it may look sincere but god is
[50:57] not impressed by how sincere a person is
[51:00] amen neither should you be yes
[51:06] some people you know you go to these
[51:07] places they're having an emotional
[51:10] experience it brings them to their knees
[51:13] and they cry
[51:20] there's a difference
[51:22] when it's worship it's spirit and your
[51:24] truth amen yes
[51:29] wish amen
[51:30] god is looking at the revelation of the
[51:33] worship
[51:35] think of cain he was sincere
[51:38] sanctuary came to great care to plant a
[51:42] garden
[51:43] he watered the garden
[51:45] all year long he was waiting for this
[51:47] crop
[51:48] he was very sincere in what he was doing
[51:52] and he went to worship the lord offering
[51:54] his fruit
[51:57] offering his sacrifice
[51:59] and you know what it shows the best of
[52:01] the crop
[52:03] and he presented it before the lord
[52:07] he pictured himself but god was not
[52:09] impressed with cain's offering
[52:12] because he had no revelation
[52:18] and god
[52:19] wants you
[52:21] amen
[52:22] to worship him with revelation
[52:25] when we worship god out of an experience
[52:28] and it cost us everything to have this
[52:30] experience
[52:32] you left your family
[52:34] you left everything to follow this
[52:35] message
[52:37] you are despised and rejected of men to
[52:39] follow this message it costs you
[52:41] something
[52:43] children it costs your parents something
[52:45] for you to be in the house of the lord
[52:46] this morning
[52:48] i'm not talking monetary costs but it
[52:50] costs you something
[52:52] you have to forsake everything
[52:55] yes amen
[52:56] it cost
[52:58] some have been through deep trials in
[53:00] their life situations in life
[53:03] and like our sister in the bible went to
[53:06] dark places
[53:08] but it cost you something
[53:10] to go and buy
[53:13] that ointment
[53:15] in an alabaster box
[53:17] it costs you something
[53:20] in spite of our experiences
[53:23] we can't come to god and offer him
[53:25] something that cost us nothing
[53:27] [Music]
[53:29] when it costs us something it is more
[53:31] special
[53:34] when you've been through an experience
[53:35] just say like brother romans last night
[53:37] when he comes into the house of the lord
[53:39] that worship is
[53:41] covered with a special anointing
[53:44] because he is so thankful to the lord
[53:48] when it costs you nothing it does not
[53:51] depict the greatness of god
[53:54] right
[53:54] let's go to second samuel 24 and 24.
[53:59] let's look what our chief psalms told us
[54:03] he wanted to buy the threshing floor
[54:06] so that he could sacrifice to the lord
[54:08] and this man wanted to give it because
[54:10] he heard it was for sacrifice he wanted
[54:13] to give it to david for nothing
[54:17] and even we must learn this even in our
[54:19] own confines
[54:21] somebody may want to offer us a piece of
[54:22] land
[54:23] to build a church
[54:25] we must reject it
[54:28] hello
[54:32] things of god
[54:33] we must place value on it
[54:36] he said that the king said unto aeronaut
[54:40] name but i will surely buy it of thee at
[54:43] a price
[54:45] i know why nobody said amen they are
[54:47] talking to indians
[54:54] this won't go right without theology
[54:58] hey
[55:01] and the king said to aruna nay but i
[55:04] will surely buy it of thee at a price
[55:07] neither will i offer birth offerings
[55:10] unto the lord my god of that which does
[55:13] cost me nothing
[55:16] so david bought the threshing floor and
[55:19] the oxen for 50 shekels of silver
[55:24] it must cost us something amen amen
[55:28] some of you
[55:30] if i break it down it costs you your
[55:32] time to be here this morning
[55:35] it costs you to go against your flesh
[55:38] even though your flesh was failing you
[55:40] and feeling weak to be in the house of
[55:41] the law but you said i must go to the
[55:44] house of the lord this morning
[55:46] and
[55:51] it costs you something to be here
[55:57] we're talking about a shout let's go to
[55:59] joshua chapter 6 and verse 5.
[56:02] take you through the shout
[56:04] the power of the shout the power of the
[56:06] sound that comes out of the redeemed
[56:09] now we know the first conquest
[56:13] was going to be
[56:14] jericho right when they enter the land
[56:17] of the inheritance now remember we're in
[56:19] adoption series we're talking about the
[56:21] land of our inheritance this is the
[56:23] first
[56:23] of the inheritance that they go to
[56:25] possess and in possessing the
[56:28] inheritance
[56:29] captive and a family is going to be set
[56:32] free
[56:33] now watch what i just said there man i
[56:36] heard it for the first time
[56:38] when you are worshiping here now in the
[56:39] house of the lord and your praise is
[56:41] going up captives are going to be set
[56:44] free
[56:45] reyab and her family were trapped in
[56:47] jericho
[56:49] but there was a certain sound of the
[56:50] redeemed
[56:52] that was attached to her deliverance
[56:56] let's read six five
[56:58] and it shall come to pass now the lord
[57:00] told them to march around the city seven
[57:03] days
[57:04] once once each day
[57:06] and on the seventh day
[57:08] seven times
[57:10] and on the seventh day brandon went
[57:12] seven times around the world
[57:15] amen
[57:18] so
[57:20] when it shall come to pass that when
[57:22] they make a long blast with the rams on
[57:25] and when you hear the sound of the
[57:26] trumpet and all the people shall shout
[57:30] with a great shout
[57:32] amen
[57:36] and the wall of the city shall fall down
[57:38] threat
[57:39] and the people shall ascend up every man
[57:42] straight before him
[57:45] that is the command that is given to
[57:46] them now
[57:48] now notice it was it must be a loud cry
[57:52] it must be a shout out
[57:57] 6 10
[57:59] and the lord
[58:00] and joshua commanded the people saying
[58:02] now watch
[58:04] the shout must be reserved for a certain
[58:07] time
[58:10] six days they were told not to shout
[58:17] six church ages
[58:18] they couldn't have a shout out
[58:21] because the opening of the war did not
[58:22] come
[58:25] you shall not shout
[58:27] that's why from paul
[58:29] to
[58:30] wesley
[58:32] the people didn't have a real shout a
[58:34] message going forth amen
[58:37] no make a noise with your voice conserve
[58:40] your voice
[58:45] preserve your voice for the seventh day
[58:51] neither shall any word proceed of your
[58:53] mouth
[58:54] rest your vocal cords
[58:59] until the day i bit you to shout
[59:03] shall he shout
[59:08] 6 16
[59:09] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[59:13] hallelujah
[59:16] when that seventh day angel shall begin
[59:18] to sound
[59:20] thunder forth his message
[59:25] when the priest blew with the trumpets
[59:30] fightful ministry is blowing the trumpet
[59:33] and joshua the holy ghost
[59:35] says to the people who standing in the
[59:38] land of the inheritance
[59:39] shout
[59:41] for the lord had given you the city
[59:47] so the people when the priest blew in
[59:50] the trumpet and it came to pass when
[59:52] they heard the sound of the trumpet
[59:57] please walk with me this morning amen
[1:00:01] and the people shouted with a great
[1:00:04] shout out
[1:00:06] and the wall fell down flat so that
[1:00:09] people went into the city every man
[1:00:11] straight before him and they took the
[1:00:14] city amen what happened the shout broke
[1:00:17] the defense of the enemy
[1:00:20] the walls of the city was the city's
[1:00:22] defense but the shout broke down the
[1:00:25] defense
[1:00:26] your shout your praise the sound of the
[1:00:30] redeemed will break down the defense of
[1:00:33] the enemy this morning oh clap your
[1:00:35] hands
[1:00:37] and shout out to god with a voice of
[1:00:40] triumph
[1:00:41] somebody say hallelujah
[1:00:43] somebody say praise the lord
[1:00:47] amen the children of israel are famous
[1:00:50] for murmuring and complaining amen why
[1:00:53] were they told not to make a sound when
[1:00:56] they go back into your hearts
[1:00:58] amen you got to preserve your voice for
[1:01:01] the sunday morning for the wednesday
[1:01:03] service you can be quiet all the other
[1:01:06] days of the week in your house but don't
[1:01:08] stop worshiping the lord
[1:01:11] maybe you're not talking to your husband
[1:01:13] maybe you're not talking to your wife
[1:01:15] but don't stop talking to the lord
[1:01:22] if you want to complain about your
[1:01:24] husband or complain about your wife or
[1:01:27] complain about your children go on your
[1:01:29] knees and complain to the lord
[1:01:33] don't say i'm gonna show you i'm gonna
[1:01:34] put it on facebook
[1:01:38] face this book
[1:01:41] and take it to the lord in prayer
[1:01:44] i'll show you on tick-tock
[1:01:48] instagram
[1:01:50] take it to the lord in prayer
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:56] now we can't praise god for a great
[1:01:58] victory like this or for a great victory
[1:02:01] that you're trusting the lord for
[1:02:03] and then we go you go tell your wife i
[1:02:05] don't know how i'm gonna make it
[1:02:08] but you just shout it
[1:02:10] the lord is gonna see me through the
[1:02:12] situation amen
[1:02:14] and then after you wake up yeah now
[1:02:16] we're gonna make it another
[1:02:22] i don't know how i'm gonna pay my bills
[1:02:25] and we go with the opposite sound of
[1:02:27] what we just shouted
[1:02:29] [Music]
[1:02:30] opposite sounds cancel one another
[1:02:36] the atmosphere is important
[1:02:39] and sound controls the atmosphere
[1:02:42] praise is a force that god gives us to
[1:02:44] call amen that call and you know heaven
[1:02:48] performs
[1:02:49] even responds according to the sound of
[1:02:52] our praise amen according to the sound
[1:02:54] of our worship
[1:02:58] daniel prayed
[1:02:59] and the sound of the redeemed went to
[1:03:01] the lord amen amen amen who responded
[1:03:05] michael
[1:03:07] responded
[1:03:09] amen
[1:03:10] but he was
[1:03:14] his response
[1:03:15] got hindered but it was still coming on
[1:03:17] the way
[1:03:18] amen don't stop believing god because
[1:03:21] there's a delay you don't know what's
[1:03:23] happening in the heavenlies in the
[1:03:24] spiritual realm when you are praying and
[1:03:26] trusting the lord for a miracle when you
[1:03:28] are praying and trusting the lord for
[1:03:30] healing god dispatches these angels
[1:03:34] to meet you at the point of your need
[1:03:36] yes
[1:03:37] but maybe they are being opposed by
[1:03:40] demon powers
[1:03:41] but you on the earth gonna keep sending
[1:03:44] out the sound of the redeemed amen break
[1:03:47] the atmosphere
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:50] we cannot be vague in our worship
[1:03:53] amen our worship must be intentional
[1:03:56] it must be directed towards god sounding
[1:03:59] a victory cry ahead of time
[1:04:02] hallelujah what's changing the
[1:04:04] atmosphere in the camp that day
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:08] that's what sounding a shout a shout
[1:04:10] represents the life energy falls from
[1:04:12] within us that takes dominion over what
[1:04:15] is her
[1:04:17] amen and it brought fear and panic to
[1:04:20] the inhabitants of jericho
[1:04:24] amen during the shout changes the
[1:04:27] atmosphere
[1:04:29] amen now usually a victory shout or a
[1:04:32] cry or the sound of the redeemed or
[1:04:35] praise is reserved for after the victory
[1:04:37] in normal circumstances but in god's
[1:04:40] kingdom he tells you shout first
[1:04:44] praise first
[1:04:45] give god thanks first amen and it will
[1:04:49] follow
[1:04:50] these signs believe first
[1:04:53] trust god first and then these signs
[1:04:56] shall follow amen
[1:04:58] make a declaration first that i am
[1:05:01] healed and the healing will follow
[1:05:04] make a declaration amen first then i
[1:05:08] am delivered
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:11] make a declaration i have a job
[1:05:14] even though you are unemployed
[1:05:19] is anybody hearing me this morning amen
[1:05:22] sound the trumpet amen
[1:05:25] first amen
[1:05:26] yes
[1:05:28] hallelujah
[1:05:29] we are not in the kingdom of the earth
[1:05:32] we are in the kingdom of heaven and the
[1:05:34] kingdom of heaven has a law and it says
[1:05:36] sound the trumpet first
[1:05:39] make a declaration first
[1:05:42] so god asks them to shout with a loud
[1:05:44] voice in victory before they can even
[1:05:47] attack the enemy
[1:05:48] and what were they doing changing the
[1:05:50] conditions changing the atmosphere
[1:05:54] changing the mindset the battle must be
[1:05:56] worn in the mind first
[1:05:59] amen amen hallelujah you find most
[1:06:02] athletes most competitors are strong
[1:06:05] mentally
[1:06:07] amen they are mentally strong
[1:06:09] that no matter what the pressure is or
[1:06:12] how odd whatever they are trying to do
[1:06:14] amen if they are defeated in their mind
[1:06:16] they will never achieve what they're
[1:06:17] going to achieve but if a person breaks
[1:06:20] down mentally they cannot compete at the
[1:06:23] highest levels and have already lost
[1:06:27] if you want to compete at the highest
[1:06:28] level this morning
[1:06:30] you need to be built up spiritually amen
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:38] what were they doing
[1:06:41] they were calling those things that were
[1:06:43] not as though it was that's what we are
[1:06:46] doing when we are shouting to god with a
[1:06:49] shout with the sound of the redeemed
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:54] when we are in a big battle don't make a
[1:06:56] small sound
[1:06:58] make a loud sound they were calling
[1:07:00] those things which are not as though
[1:07:02] they are and evan was recording the
[1:07:05] sound of their victory
[1:07:07] this is amen can you imagine before the
[1:07:10] world of jericho fell down they were
[1:07:12] hearing the sound of their victory amen
[1:07:15] amen why you think when somebody is
[1:07:18] running a race you find their parents
[1:07:20] cheering them on
[1:07:22] they're giving them the sound of victory
[1:07:25] they're applauding them amen
[1:07:29] hallelujah so heaven responds according
[1:07:32] to your worship even responds according
[1:07:34] to your sound it's recording the sound
[1:07:37] and it responds to that sound
[1:07:39] you don't believe me the bible says the
[1:07:42] high priest is touched according to the
[1:07:44] feelings of our infirmities
[1:07:47] and the high priest only responds to our
[1:07:49] confession
[1:07:51] so whatever we confess that's what the
[1:07:53] high priest can take before the father
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:58] amen so opposite sounds cancel one
[1:08:01] another
[1:08:04] faith and doubt cannot operate together
[1:08:07] faith will cancel doubt
[1:08:09] and doubt will cancel faith
[1:08:13] which one are we operating in this
[1:08:15] morning
[1:08:17] amen we are going to make a positive
[1:08:19] confession even though the condition is
[1:08:22] negative
[1:08:24] yes
[1:08:26] amen
[1:08:27] we must make a positive confession
[1:08:30] even when the situation is negative
[1:08:34] that's why we say let the weak say i am
[1:08:37] strong
[1:08:39] let the poor say i am rich
[1:08:43] let the unemployed say i am employed
[1:08:46] let the sick say i'm healed
[1:08:48] let the broken married say i have a
[1:08:50] blessed marriage let the broken hearted
[1:08:53] say my heart is healed
[1:08:56] the broken spirits say my spirit is
[1:08:59] healed
[1:09:00] like we read the opening scripture let
[1:09:02] the saints be joyful in glory let them
[1:09:05] sing aloud on their beds with i praise
[1:09:08] of god in my mouth and a true edge of
[1:09:11] sword in my hand
[1:09:13] praise is the sound of victory
[1:09:16] amen worship is a sound of submission
[1:09:20] amen when we are in low places in our
[1:09:23] lives maybe there is no praise within us
[1:09:27] sure you we need to lift ourselves out
[1:09:29] of the condition
[1:09:32] will we go through dark times
[1:09:34] dark valleys where we don't feel like
[1:09:36] praising yes we will
[1:09:39] but we're going to lift ourselves from
[1:09:41] that condition
[1:09:44] think of an airplane
[1:09:46] the pilots in the plane the passengers
[1:09:49] are on board
[1:09:50] but in order for him to get off the
[1:09:52] ground
[1:09:54] and that's what the sound of the
[1:09:55] redeemed is doing now taking us from the
[1:09:58] natural to the supernatural
[1:10:00] taking us from this weather into
[1:10:02] heavenly places
[1:10:04] amen what he needs the airplane does not
[1:10:07] defy the law of gravity
[1:10:13] the airplane does not defy the law of
[1:10:15] gravity the law of gravity is still in
[1:10:17] effect
[1:10:19] what happens the plane operates under
[1:10:22] another law
[1:10:26] it's operating under the law of lift
[1:10:30] and in order to get that lift it needs a
[1:10:34] runway
[1:10:36] it needs the prison worship service
[1:10:40] the runway
[1:10:41] and what does the plane need
[1:10:44] fuel
[1:10:46] in the plane to give it a
[1:10:49] thrust
[1:10:53] i like that part of the takeoff of the
[1:10:55] plane you know when you feel that thing
[1:10:58] that g-force
[1:11:00] and you just like thrown back in your
[1:11:02] seat
[1:11:03] that speed
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:07] so you need the power the sound of the
[1:11:10] redeemed
[1:11:11] to trust you
[1:11:12] so praise is the fuel that gives you the
[1:11:15] trust
[1:11:16] the shout within you the life energy
[1:11:18] source from within you
[1:11:21] is the is the fuel that gives you the
[1:11:23] trust to take you to the higher realm of
[1:11:26] the spirit above your situation
[1:11:29] above your condition
[1:11:31] amen when we realize that the life
[1:11:33] energy force amen through praise and
[1:11:36] worship and god responds to
[1:11:39] to that with his presence then he
[1:11:41] receives our offering
[1:11:43] amen hallelujah and you know what that
[1:11:46] does
[1:11:47] when we
[1:11:49] see that the lord has received our
[1:11:51] offering
[1:11:54] it's better than the sound of applause
[1:11:59] it's better than any human accolades
[1:12:03] it beats double wars
[1:12:05] it beats grammy awards
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:11] why
[1:12:13] nothing is more rewarding to a worshiper
[1:12:16] than having the glory of the lord fill
[1:12:20] the womb
[1:12:32] like john fell at his feet as a dead man
[1:12:36] amen the prophet tells us about this man
[1:12:39] he was a russian
[1:12:40] and he had composed his musical piece
[1:12:43] and he was performing it
[1:12:45] and he performed it so well that the
[1:12:47] people stood up and gave him a standing
[1:12:49] ovation
[1:12:50] standing ovation
[1:12:52] and the man was not moved
[1:12:55] but he was looking up at the balcony
[1:12:58] because the master who had taught him
[1:13:01] and trained him
[1:13:03] the tutor
[1:13:05] he was looking to see what his response
[1:13:08] was
[1:13:10] and when he saw the mastermind
[1:13:13] then he knew
[1:13:15] he was accepted
[1:13:17] then he was satisfied
[1:13:18] he wasn't looking for the applause of
[1:13:20] man
[1:13:22] amen
[1:13:25] and i want to put it out there
[1:13:27] that we
[1:13:28] our brothers and our sisters
[1:13:30] we do not mind you shouting amen
[1:13:34] we do not mind you praising the lord
[1:13:36] amen
[1:13:38] because i know it cost you something
[1:13:40] amen
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:42] now when the word now this is where we
[1:13:44] need to draw the distinction because
[1:13:46] every revival produce their own songs
[1:13:50] and when we can sing
[1:13:52] with our portion of the word amen
[1:13:56] then now we are singing with ammunition
[1:13:59] the word of god in our mouth with
[1:14:01] ammunition amen
[1:14:04] do you hear what i'm saying
[1:14:08] you got to put the word in your mouth
[1:14:10] which is the gun
[1:14:12] and when you speak the word it's like
[1:14:13] you're pulling the trigger
[1:14:19] so you got to find the right words
[1:14:21] that speak about defeating the enemy
[1:14:23] about overcoming this age
[1:14:26] load it in your mouth and start firing
[1:14:28] at the enemy
[1:14:30] don't
[1:14:31] shoot blank bullets
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:37] load
[1:14:38] no weapon formed against me shall
[1:14:40] prosper
[1:14:42] headshot
[1:14:47] load healing is the children's bread
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:52] i never had a gang like that
[1:14:57] man shall not live by bread alone but
[1:15:00] every word that proceeded out of the
[1:15:01] mouth of god
[1:15:03] amen
[1:15:05] praise must be accompanied with
[1:15:07] thanksgiving
[1:15:09] the sound of worship we must come with a
[1:15:11] thankful heart to the lord thank you
[1:15:14] jesus
[1:15:16] the bible says in psalm 92 it is a good
[1:15:18] thing to give thanks unto the lord amen
[1:15:21] and to sing praises unto his name first
[1:15:24] thessalonians 5 18 says in everything
[1:15:27] give thanks
[1:15:29] for this is the will of god in christ
[1:15:31] jesus
[1:15:33] and i want you to know
[1:15:35] heaven won't go bankrupt without your
[1:15:36] praise amen
[1:15:38] praise is for you to have the victory
[1:15:41] god has angels in heaven worshiping him
[1:15:44] and even if you don't worship him
[1:15:46] god says i'm able to raise up stones
[1:15:49] rocks
[1:15:50] amen so evan won't go bankrupt
[1:15:54] but if you will go bankrupt
[1:15:57] your life will be fruitless
[1:15:59] your life will be dry
[1:16:02] amen
[1:16:05] hallelujah
[1:16:07] i'm just going to go two minutes more
[1:16:09] and touch the highlights of this
[1:16:11] one time elijah elisha they were going
[1:16:14] into war and they came in joseph had
[1:16:17] called elisha and his spirit was grieved
[1:16:19] because he was angry with this king of
[1:16:21] israel
[1:16:22] and because his spirit wasn't right he
[1:16:24] could not prophesy or speak a word
[1:16:26] so he said bring me a minstrel
[1:16:29] bring me an anointed musician
[1:16:31] right you'll find that in second kings 3
[1:16:33] 14.
[1:16:34] amen
[1:16:38] he says bring me now in minstrel
[1:16:40] and when the minstrel prayed the hand of
[1:16:42] the lord came upon him
[1:16:44] and then he prophesied and said make the
[1:16:46] valley full of nutrients
[1:16:48] you remember they wanted water
[1:16:50] so he said dig out the valley make it
[1:16:52] full of ditches water is coming
[1:16:55] what am i saying we need anointing
[1:16:58] the musicians prayed up musicians
[1:17:01] anointed
[1:17:02] amen
[1:17:04] we'll go to another king i don't want to
[1:17:05] take another service on this so i'm just
[1:17:07] going to finish it here jehoshaphat
[1:17:09] going with the king of israel again
[1:17:11] they're going out against the army
[1:17:13] and joseph
[1:17:15] amen we'll pick it up in secret
[1:17:16] chronicles 20
[1:17:19] 21
[1:17:21] and when he had consulted with the
[1:17:23] people he appointed singers
[1:17:25] unto the lord
[1:17:26] that they should praise the beauty of
[1:17:28] his holiness
[1:17:29] and when they went out before the army
[1:17:31] and to say praise the lord
[1:17:34] for his mercy and children forever
[1:17:37] now watch they haven't started the
[1:17:38] battle yet but the singers and musicians
[1:17:41] went before
[1:17:42] they were calling those things that are
[1:17:44] not as though they are
[1:17:45] and when they begin to sing in praise
[1:17:48] the lord set up ambushments
[1:17:51] ambushes
[1:17:53] against the children of ayman moab and
[1:17:55] mount share
[1:17:57] would come against judah and they were
[1:17:59] smitten
[1:18:00] for the children of eminent moab stood
[1:18:03] up against the inhabitants of mount sir
[1:18:06] utterly to slay and destroy them
[1:18:08] and when they had made an end of the
[1:18:10] inhabitants of sin everyone helped to
[1:18:13] destroy one another
[1:18:15] amen your praise and your worship will
[1:18:18] confuse the enemy
[1:18:19] they'll start to kill one another
[1:18:21] they'll start to attack one another the
[1:18:24] kingdom of heaven amen will be divided
[1:18:27] and the kingdom cannot stand once it's
[1:18:29] divided so it will be torn down
[1:18:33] but the sound of the routine must go
[1:18:35] forth amen as a positive confession
[1:18:39] one time saul was depressed
[1:18:43] saul was going through a depression
[1:18:45] he was jealous because god had anointed
[1:18:48] david
[1:18:49] and this jealousy had consumed him
[1:18:51] and he was persecuting david and wanting
[1:18:54] to kill him he was even tormenting his
[1:18:56] own son jonathan
[1:18:59] and he was not a nice king to to have
[1:19:01] ruling over israel when he was in this
[1:19:04] depression mode
[1:19:06] demon powers were oppressing him
[1:19:10] so they searched for an anointed
[1:19:11] musician
[1:19:14] which finally one samuel 16.
[1:19:18] let's turn to verse 22.
[1:19:21] saul said to jesse saying let david i
[1:19:23] pray they stand before me for he has
[1:19:26] found favor in my sight and it came to
[1:19:28] pass when the evil spirit from god was
[1:19:31] upon saul that david took him up
[1:19:34] and played with his head so saul was
[1:19:36] refreshed and was well and the evil
[1:19:39] spirit departed from him
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:46] we're close with at 16.
