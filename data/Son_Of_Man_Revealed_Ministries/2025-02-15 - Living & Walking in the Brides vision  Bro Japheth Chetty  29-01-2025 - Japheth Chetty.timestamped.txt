[2:31] once again amen it's good to be in the
[2:33] house of the Lord but Saints of light
[2:35] precious Faith where we have things in
[2:38] common amen amen because then we can
[2:41] walk in one Accord amen we know we can
[2:43] walk Amen in Fellowship in brotherly
[2:46] love amen so amen now tonight I feel
[2:49] like a preacher with this mic you know
[2:51] not used to having a wireless mic so I
[2:53] don't know what kind of a Preacher I
[2:54] would be maybe I'll start walking down
[2:56] the aisles and
[2:58] stuff amen but just relaxed in the house
[3:00] of the Lord and we just want to hear
[3:02] from him amen if we can turn to our
[3:05] Bibles The Book of Proverbs chapter
[3:09] 29 and verse
[3:27] 18 amen the Bible says where there is no
[3:30] vision the people perish but he that
[3:33] keepeth the law happy is he amen amen
[3:37] where there is no vision the people
[3:39] perish amen may the Lord add His
[3:41] blessings to the reading of the word you
[3:43] may take his seats
[3:45] amen amen so for our topic tonight we
[3:48] just want to talk about walking and
[3:51] living in the bride's
[3:53] Vision amen the bride has a vision and
[3:56] she is walking in line with that vision
[3:59] amen she's living and walking in that
[4:01] Vision so for context we just want to
[4:04] take um a reading from the scripture
[4:07] tonight from First Kings chap
[4:09] 22 and verse one and we've heard this
[4:13] scripture been read many times and you
[4:15] know many stories that we read in the
[4:17] Bible it's been preached for years and
[4:19] years and we've heard the message for
[4:20] years and years and each season it has
[4:24] some meaning to us it has some benefit
[4:26] to us but in each season it brings forth
[4:29] something new amen and we can glean
[4:31] something new in each season to see what
[4:33] God is trying to say to us in that
[4:35] particular season amen so tonight we've
[4:39] read this scripture many times but we
[4:40] want to see in this season what God has
[4:43] in store for
[4:44] us the Bible says and it came to pass in
[4:47] the third year that joasaph the king of
[4:50] Judah came down to the king of Israel
[4:54] amen now we know that Jo Jehoshaphat was
[4:56] a righteous king and the prophet tells
[4:58] us here that joaz josaphat came into the
[5:01] wrong company when he came down to meet
[5:04] King haab amen yesen and the king of
[5:08] Israel said unto his servants know ye
[5:10] not that ramit in Gilead is
[5:13] ours and we be still and take it not out
[5:17] of the hand of the king of Syria and he
[5:19] said unto Jehosaphat Willl thou go with
[5:22] me to battle to ramed Gilead yeah he's
[5:25] trying to influence now King Jehoshaphat
[5:28] and Jehoshaphat said to the king of
[5:30] Israel I am as Thou Art my people as thy
[5:33] people my horses as thy horses and
[5:37] josphat said unto the king of Israel
[5:40] inquire I pray thee at the word of the
[5:42] Lord today so we can see here that the
[5:44] righteousness in josaphat wants to
[5:46] inquire what the word of the Lord
[5:52] says then the king of Israel gathered
[5:55] the prophets together about 400 men and
[5:57] said unto them shall I go against ramed
[6:00] gillad so now we can see here the World
[6:02] Council of churches amen the E communal
[6:05] move amen that's moving in the end time
[6:07] and King Ahab calls his 400
[6:10] prophets and he says shall I go up to
[6:13] Ram gillad to battle or shall I for Bear
[6:15] now bearing in mind that King Ahab knows
[6:19] that Elijah prophesied against him he
[6:21] knows all of these prophecies amen but
[6:24] he wants something soothing to his ears
[6:26] and we know the Bible says they would
[6:27] Heap up unto them El preaches with itchy
[6:31] ears amen so he wants to hear something
[6:35] good and he says shall I go or shall I
[6:37] forbear and they said go up for the Lord
[6:40] shall deliver it into thy hand of the
[6:42] king and Jehoshaphat said is there not
[6:46] here a prophet of the Lord besides that
[6:49] we might inquire of him amen so Joseph
[6:52] had kind of knew that there was
[6:53] something wrong here there were 400
[6:54] prophets preaching in agreement but
[6:57] probably Jo also knew that there was a
[6:59] prophet Prophecy from Elijah going forth
[7:01] as well so he wanted to hear what the
[7:04] Lord had
[7:05] said amen so we know here that King aab
[7:08] says no I don't want to hear from this
[7:10] Prophet there is one more Prophet but he
[7:11] always speaks negative about
[7:14] me amen there is yet one man Mah the son
[7:17] of imla by whom we may inquire of the
[7:19] Lord but I hate him for he do
[7:23] prophesy he do not prophesy good
[7:25] concerning me but evil and Jas had said
[7:29] let not the the king say so then the
[7:31] king of Israel called an officer and
[7:33] said hasten hither M Mah the son of imla
[7:37] and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
[7:39] the king of Judah sat each on his throne
[7:42] having put on their robes in a void
[7:45] place in the entrance of the Gate of
[7:48] Samaria and all the prophets prophesied
[7:50] before them and zekiah the son of chah
[7:54] made him horns of ion amen bear this in
[7:57] mind we're going to come back to you
[7:58] later and he said thus say the Lord with
[8:01] the shalt thou push the syrians until
[8:04] thou have consumed them and all the
[8:06] prophets prophesied so saying go up to
[8:09] ramed Gilead and prosper for the Lord
[8:12] shall deliver it unto the king's hand
[8:15] and the messenger that was going to call
[8:17] Micaiah spake unto him saying behold now
[8:20] the words of the prophets declar good
[8:22] unto the king with one mouth let Thy
[8:25] word I pray thee be like the word of one
[8:27] of them and speak that which is good and
[8:30] Micaiah said as the Lord liveth what the
[8:33] Lord say unto me that will I speak amen
[8:36] so here we see this is why we cannot be
[8:38] influenced by the denominational world
[8:40] and the church world we know what the
[8:42] word of the Lord says and we can only
[8:44] say what the word of the Lord says
[8:47] amen so he came to the king and the King
[8:50] said unto him Mah shall we go against
[8:53] red Gilead to battle or shall we forbear
[8:56] and he answered him and here Maka starts
[8:59] to to mock the king a little bit and he
[9:01] says go and prosper for the Lord shall
[9:03] deliver it into the hand of the
[9:05] king amen now that's exactly what the
[9:08] king wanted to hear but the king knew
[9:10] that that wasn't the truth because he
[9:12] said and the King said said unto him how
[9:15] many times shall I adure Thee that thou
[9:17] tell me nothing but that which is true
[9:19] in the name of the Lord and he said I
[9:21] saw all Israel scattered upon the hills
[9:24] as sheep that have not a shepherd and
[9:27] the Lord said these have no master
[9:30] let them return every man to his house
[9:32] in peace and the king of Israel said
[9:34] unto josaphat did not I tell thee that
[9:37] he would prophesy no good concerning me
[9:40] now look at how crazy King aab is
[9:42] because when Mah mocks him and tells him
[9:45] go up you're going to prosper he knows
[9:47] that is not the truth but when Mah tells
[9:49] him the truth he still doesn't like it
[9:54] amen so we're going to pause then we're
[9:56] going to come back to the rest of the
[9:57] story a little bit later on but we just
[10:00] want to set the context for where the
[10:02] story is now we know that Israel and
[10:05] King aab is typ in America the prophet
[10:07] tells us as much
[10:08] amen but if we look at the setting here
[10:11] King haab wants to go and take over
[10:14] ramed
[10:15] Gilead and he says that ramed gillad
[10:18] rightfully belongs to us now technically
[10:21] speaking he is correct amen he says when
[10:24] our father divided the lands it belong
[10:26] to
[10:26] us so he is right technically speaking
[10:30] amen and the prophet says sometimes it
[10:32] may sound good amen that he wants to go
[10:35] and take ramed gillad back and what is
[10:38] ramed Gilead typing in the book of
[10:41] Deuteronomy chapter 4 we see we see that
[10:44] Moses sured three cities on the side of
[10:47] Jordan toward the sun rising that the
[10:50] Slayer might flee to the which should
[10:52] kill his neighbor unawares and hated him
[10:55] not in times past and that fleeing unto
[10:58] one of these cities he might live namely
[11:01] berser in the wilderness in the plain
[11:03] country of the reubenites and ramed
[11:05] Gilead in the gadites so Ram G Gilead
[11:09] was one of the City of
[11:11] Refuge amen so King haab here wants to
[11:15] go back and claim back the City of
[11:17] Refuge and now this is typ in amen
[11:20] America in type because we see now
[11:22] there's come a time where Trump comes
[11:24] back on the scene now and Trump now
[11:26] wants to start to restore Christian
[11:29] again in America because the prophet
[11:31] tells us that our City of Refuge is
[11:34] Christ amen there's no other City of
[11:36] Refuge but Christ amen our hopes are in
[11:39] Christ amen our peace is in Christ our
[11:42] Salvation is in Christ so Christ is our
[11:44] Ram Gilead and now America is coming to
[11:47] a time where they've been so backslid
[11:50] but there comes a man on the scene now
[11:52] that wants to claim back Christian
[11:54] virtues amen it's showing a sign of him
[11:57] wanting to take back ramed gillad
[11:59] and look now it sounds good and the
[12:02] prophet says this all sounds good they
[12:04] want to there's nothing wrong because
[12:06] red Gil rightfully belongs to them and
[12:09] we know that America was founded on
[12:12] Christian principles it was a Godly
[12:14] Nation to begin with so it sounds like a
[12:16] good thing a once Godly Nation back and
[12:19] now wants to return back to
[12:21] Christ
[12:23] amen if we can put up this the next
[12:26] slide there we can see slogans like this
[12:28] coming out we president Trump vows to
[12:30] bring back the Bible to life again in
[12:32] America amen you can see a little bit of
[12:35] a businessman here he says let's make
[12:37] America Pray Again yours for
[12:40] $60 he wants to sell a trump Bible for
[12:43] $60 because he's a businessman but
[12:45] what's the message America is wanting
[12:49] something they are hungry for something
[12:50] they know that they have backslid and
[12:52] gotten away from God right it sounds
[12:55] good but the problem is there's already
[12:57] been a prophecy gone over
[13:00] because Elijah the prophet has already
[13:02] prophesied their expected end and he's
[13:04] already prophesied the expected end of
[13:07] jel so in as much as aab wants to take
[13:09] back ramed Gilead the problem here is he
[13:12] married to Jezebel he already brought in
[13:15] idolatry into Israel so even though it
[13:18] sounds like a good thing Elijah the
[13:20] prophet prophecy must
[13:26] stand and we know that the Elijah of
[13:29] this time when prophesied a curse Over
[13:31] America he said I can't pray for them
[13:33] anymore because it's cursed it's gone
[13:40] amen the prophet says yeah they said we
[13:42] have prayed we have fasted these are the
[13:45] 400 prophets now we've got the will of
[13:47] the Lord thus say the lord god Jehovah
[13:50] go up and take it over for it belongs to
[13:53] us and it's ours and we rightfully have
[13:55] a right to it let's go get it they say
[13:58] let's fig that out now now mentally
[14:01] that's right it was given to us that's
[14:04] right now then prophets let's see now in
[14:06] our psychology our thoughts our psychic
[14:09] mind that belongs to us God gave it to
[14:12] us
[14:14] amen so that is why we see now even in
[14:16] America Christians are starting to get
[14:18] excited even all around the world maybe
[14:20] even some believers who are aen
[14:23] following politics more are excited that
[14:26] Trump is back in power because they can
[14:28] see now that some kind of virtue is
[14:31] going to be
[14:32] restored amen but we know that America
[14:34] is in Union with Jezebel with the
[14:37] Catholic church and according to what we
[14:39] are told Trump won the vote due to the
[14:42] Catholic vote and one of the headlines
[14:44] here if we can go to the next slide I
[14:47] like the way this headline says
[14:50] it Trump courted white Catholics and
[14:54] they helped him win the White House
[14:56] again I like the word it says Trump
[14:58] courted white Catholics what does
[15:00] courtship speak of a man when you're
[15:02] courting just like how aab came into
[15:04] Union Jezebel Trump showing that there's
[15:07] a connection now between America and
[15:10] Jezebel
[15:14] amen so this was the intention of
[15:17] Ahab and what better way to get America
[15:20] back to Salvation again than to start
[15:22] calling up all the denominations all
[15:25] these religious organizations the clergy
[15:27] man to back him up
[15:29] amen because these are the school of
[15:31] prophets now remember these are the
[15:33] ecclesiastical School of prophets for
[15:35] this day amen you never see any message
[15:38] Believers there at the inauguration amen
[15:40] no Mah was called there amen you have
[15:43] seen Trump's School of prophets now I'm
[15:45] saying Trump but remember don't only
[15:47] look at the Mana we looking at the
[15:49] office we are looking at America now I'm
[15:51] just using Trump because that's the
[15:53] first thing that comes to mind right but
[15:55] look at the office and look at the type
[15:57] if we can go to the next slide
[16:00] now very curious we see that Franklin
[16:02] Graham was there now who is Franklin
[16:05] Graham we know he is the son of bully
[16:06] Graham and who was The Messengers that
[16:09] went down to Sodom we know it was bully
[16:11] Graham and Oral Roberts right and now we
[16:14] know the prophet tells us that God takes
[16:16] his man of the scene but he doesn't take
[16:18] the spirit because we know William
[16:20] Brandon left the scene the angel of the
[16:22] of the Lord never leave the scene he's
[16:24] here with the elect so if Billy was
[16:26] taken up the scene is the Angel to Sodom
[16:29] still on the scene because they must be
[16:31] the angels of judgment that are watching
[16:34] Sodom remember the Angels only left when
[16:37] Sodom and gomorra was finally burnt
[16:39] up so we see Franklin Graham now and we
[16:42] know that amen the angel amen the same
[16:45] angel that was with Billy Graham most
[16:47] probably is still with the son amen and
[16:50] not only him now we using him as a type
[16:52] but for the old ecclesiastical movement
[16:55] amen but look what he says at the
[16:58] inauguration he says over the years
[17:01] Graham has been outspoken supporter of
[17:03] trump and his policies and has claimed
[17:06] that Trump was the last presidential
[17:08] candidate his late father voted for now
[17:11] remember buly Jam one of the messengers
[17:14] and look remember the connection between
[17:16] the angel and lot and lot was one of the
[17:18] Mayors one of the leaders of Sodom and
[17:20] gomorah right so we see that Trump was
[17:24] one of the last presidential candidates
[17:25] that his father voted for and he says my
[17:28] father knew Donald Trump he believed in
[17:30] Donald Trump and he voted for Donald
[17:32] Trump he believed that Donald J Trump
[17:35] was the man for this hour in history for
[17:38] our nation amen I think back to the
[17:41] angel and lot in Sodom and
[17:43] Gomorrah
[17:45] amen and we know that even you know lot
[17:48] was had some form of righteousness
[17:50] inbody he was
[17:51] backsliding amen but he had enough sense
[17:54] in in him to be against the whole Sodom
[17:58] uh movement amen of gays amen and
[18:00] lesbians and all of these things because
[18:02] when they wanted to come and sleep with
[18:03] the angel amen he said no take my
[18:05] daughters amen so that is why we see one
[18:08] of the first orders when CH comes on the
[18:10] scene is he signs an order to say we
[18:12] only recognize male and female champ is
[18:15] against this whole gay and lesbian
[18:17] movement
[18:19] amen we can go to the next
[18:23] slide one of the other ministers that
[18:25] was there Lorenzo su he words were such
[18:29] we are grateful that you are the one
[18:31] that has called him for such a time as
[18:33] this now who uses these words all along
[18:36] you remember we type Esther and we
[18:38] always say God has preserved us for such
[18:40] a time as this but they are recognizing
[18:43] that in their part of scripture and they
[18:45] part of Prophecy they have been
[18:46] preserved for such a time as this amen
[18:50] and notice he says that America would
[18:51] begin to dream again remember we spoke
[18:53] on Sunday about Joseph and his dream
[18:56] amen because the bride is walking in her
[18:57] dream in her vision
[18:59] but everyone to come into their and
[19:01] their vision and prayed for a day when
[19:05] all Americans regardless of race or
[19:07] religion could join together Here's Your
[19:09] World Council of churches now your your
[19:11] movement where they trying to unite
[19:13] everyone when we Let Freedom Ring we
[19:16] will be able to speed out that day when
[19:18] all of your children black men and white
[19:20] men Protestant and Catholic Jew and
[19:22] Gentile will be able to sing in that
[19:25] meaning of the old Negro spiritual so
[19:27] you see what they intention is is to
[19:30] come together amen and to unite together
[19:33] and we know that the tears are being
[19:34] bundled
[19:36] up amen now the prophet says well all of
[19:40] them with one Accord has come and prayed
[19:42] over a thing they fasted and prayed and
[19:45] he's made two great big horns he's
[19:48] positive he's got the word of the Lord
[19:51] so he said come up before the king and
[19:53] took these big horns and said by this
[19:55] you are going to push the syrians right
[19:58] off the go the God God's ground and
[20:01] we're going to possess God's possession
[20:04] now here the prophet is talking about
[20:06] these two horns and we know this takes
[20:07] us back to Revelations
[20:09] 13 verse 11 amen it says and I beheld
[20:13] another Beast coming up out of the earth
[20:14] we know that this is America now and he
[20:17] had two horns like a lamb and he spoke
[20:20] as a dragon and he exercised all the
[20:23] power of the first Beast before him and
[20:25] causeth the Earth and them which dwell
[20:27] therein to worship the first Beast whose
[20:30] deadly Hound was healed the prophet
[20:32] tells us the two horns like a lamb not a
[20:35] lamb and he says what is it it's the
[20:37] American buffalo see there he is the two
[20:41] horns like a lamb but then what did he
[20:43] do he had freedom of religion and the
[20:46] prophet says now lamb has two horns and
[20:49] that's civil and ecclesiastical Powers
[20:52] but when they United remember then the
[20:56] lamb spoke like the dragon did before
[20:58] him him and the dragon was wrong so when
[21:00] we see these two Powers civil and
[21:02] ecclesiastical Powers uniting amen
[21:05] Prophet says that's when we see he
[21:07] starts to speak like a dragon and we can
[21:09] see now once again the church and state
[21:12] is starting to unite again just like he
[21:13] did back then with Rome amen when Rome
[21:16] United Church and States amen just like
[21:18] Jezebel did now aab is doing the same
[21:23] thing so these this this main Prophet
[21:27] here is I think his name is he's saying
[21:30] to Ahab you are going to take these two
[21:32] horns basically these two Powers the
[21:34] civil and ecclesiastical powers and you
[21:37] are going to win this war with that
[21:40] amen now you notice as I said earlier on
[21:43] we've we we preach these things for
[21:45] years and years but in each season God
[21:47] revealed something to us Amen in that
[21:49] time and season and we know which this
[21:52] is this much is true that Mah comes down
[21:56] the scene they call Mah right
[21:59] and notice how they start to say to Mah
[22:03] and start to kind of D him a bit and say
[22:05] look we're going to make you some great
[22:07] person today you're going to join now
[22:09] this great movement you're going to come
[22:11] up to all our high dignitaries you're
[22:13] going to come before these great two
[22:14] kings and please watch how you speak
[22:18] basically they are saying to him you say
[22:20] what they are saying and if you do that
[22:23] you are going to prosper and if you do
[22:25] that you are going to be
[22:27] blessed but Mah tells them I will only
[22:30] say what the Lord tells me to say notice
[22:33] the boldness of Mah it it sounds a lot
[22:36] like the bride has thus said the Lord or
[22:38] she keeps
[22:39] still you know even though they are
[22:41] trying to flatter him with all of these
[22:42] things but Mah is confident because
[22:45] remember Mah knows the message of
[22:49] Elijah
[22:53] amen and we know that Elijah's prophecy
[22:55] that had gone out was that aab aen was
[22:58] going to be killed he was going to come
[23:00] to an end and he said the dogs were
[23:02] going to lick his blood amen and he said
[23:04] the same thing to
[23:05] Jezebel
[23:07] amen and notice when this is happening
[23:10] now as I said it's happening at a
[23:12] specific time when aab wants to take
[23:14] over ramed Gilead so the setting is
[23:17] perfect now when America once again
[23:19] wants to restore their Christian virtues
[23:21] there must be a makah on the scene that
[23:24] amen comes to their position as well
[23:27] amen
[23:31] now let's let's just read a bit in the
[23:33] scripture and just follow this along
[23:35] when may when Mah comes along he says to
[23:39] them then he said I did see all Israel
[23:42] scattered upon the mountains as sheep
[23:44] that have no Shepherd and the Lord said
[23:47] these have no master let them return
[23:50] therefore every man to his house in
[23:52] peace and the king of Israel said to
[23:54] Jehoshaphat did I not tell you that he
[23:57] would not prophesy good good unto me but
[24:01] evil now let's pay attention here in
[24:04] verse 18 He says again he said therefore
[24:06] hear the word of the Lord I Saw the Lord
[24:09] sitting upon his throne and all the host
[24:11] of Heaven standing on his right hand and
[24:14] on his left now what is this in a time
[24:17] where aab is going to take over ramed
[24:19] Gilead Mah is on the scene and a door is
[24:22] opened up unto him a door to a
[24:25] supernatural realm where Mah is caught
[24:27] up now into realm and he sees the
[24:29] heavenlies this door is opened up unto
[24:32] him amen and he begins to see God and
[24:34] his throne and he sees a council is
[24:37] being held am amen and what season are
[24:39] we living in we know here in 2025 we are
[24:42] the word of the Lord doors are starting
[24:43] to be open when at a time when America
[24:46] wants Ram gillad wants the City of
[24:49] Refuge back doors are starting to be
[24:51] open amen and here the door is open to
[24:55] Micah and notice what he seees he sees
[24:59] the Lord on his throne and he sees the
[25:01] host now what's the host we know that's
[25:03] the Angelic realm so in other words Mah
[25:05] is not coming into connection with the
[25:07] Angelic realm amen and we know the bride
[25:10] in this hour is connected to the Angelic
[25:13] realm we know the door has been opened
[25:15] up to the bride to a supernatural realm
[25:17] in this hour am amen and notice that's
[25:19] not the only door that's been opened he
[25:22] says and the Lord said who shall entice
[25:25] Ahab king of Israel that he may go up to
[25:27] fall R Gilead and one spake saying after
[25:31] this manner and another saying after
[25:33] that manner then they came out a spirit
[25:36] now here's the second door being open
[25:37] the Demonic World amen amen what two
[25:40] doors were open we know in 2025 God's
[25:43] door Amen to the supernatural world and
[25:45] the de demonic world we know the pope
[25:47] started to open these doors Amen to the
[25:49] Demonic world and Mah is beginning to
[25:52] see these Spirits coming up before the
[25:54] Lord and he said I will entice him and
[25:57] the Lord said unto him where with he
[26:00] said I will go out and be a Lon spirit
[26:03] in the mouth of all these prophets see
[26:06] what Spirits now controlling these
[26:07] modern day
[26:10] preachers and the Lord said Thou shalt
[26:12] entice him amen and thou shalt also
[26:16] Prevail go out and do even so so we see
[26:19] the setting here now how at a specific
[26:22] time doors are being opened up to Mah
[26:25] and we know Mah is typing the bride amen
[26:27] and is caught up in the message of
[26:30] Elijah amen he's caught up in the shout
[26:32] message of Elijah amen and that is why
[26:35] now Mah's Vision has to match Elijah's
[26:38] prophecy because amen if we look at it
[26:42] this way if we can say it this way Mah
[26:45] is caught up in this seven seal mystery
[26:48] because when he's caught up he meets the
[26:50] seven seal himself he Hees God Seated on
[26:52] the throne amen and he starts to see the
[26:55] hor Riders because he see these EV evil
[26:58] going out to entice amen what were the
[27:00] hor riders for going out to deceive the
[27:02] Nations amen so in other words Mah is
[27:05] caught up and the seals are open to him
[27:07] because he's caught up in the in the
[27:09] message of
[27:11] Elijah amen and so these doors are being
[27:13] opened unto
[27:15] him and who catches the Revelation in
[27:17] this hour am man Mah the type of the
[27:20] Bride she is the one that catches the
[27:23] Revelation in this season amen the doors
[27:25] are being opened up unto her she can re
[27:28] the Demonic World being open she can
[27:30] recognize the Angelic World being opened
[27:33] up in this hour amen now here is where
[27:36] we want to see that you know we can
[27:40] throw out our catchphrases here we say
[27:41] that Mah's Vision amen had to match
[27:44] Elijah's prophecy but I want to draw a
[27:47] distinction micaiah's Vision was not
[27:49] Elijah's
[27:51] Vision Mah's Vision did not contradict
[27:54] Elijah's Vision but Micaiah had to have
[27:57] his own vision
[27:59] because Elijah's Vision was the dogs are
[28:01] going to lick your
[28:03] blood
[28:05] amen now Mah could have stayed happy
[28:09] with that and he could have come and
[28:11] repeated the same thing to aab and he
[28:13] could have said the dogs are going to
[28:14] lick your blood Mah wouldn't have known
[28:17] that this is the season for Elijah's
[28:19] prophecy to come to pass because when
[28:21] you are waiting for a prophet's prophecy
[28:23] to come to pass you wait for it to come
[28:25] to pass and then you say this is that
[28:27] which was spoken by Elijah the
[28:29] prophet but because Mah was caught up in
[28:32] his own Vision he could say to Ahab if
[28:36] you return at all this day the Lord has
[28:38] not spoken to me he could now take
[28:41] Elijah's prophecy and say this day is
[28:43] going to be fulfilled because I know
[28:45] that the Lord showed me this amen and he
[28:48] could say to them amen if you return at
[28:51] all the Lord had not spoken to me amen
[28:54] and this is why in the message we got to
[28:56] watch we all these catch trases uh
[28:58] catchphrases say what the tape says amen
[29:01] Push Play Amen these terms amen why it
[29:06] is true that we need to say what the
[29:07] tape say that does not mean verbatim
[29:10] quote what the prophet is saying every
[29:12] time you got to have your own Vision you
[29:15] got to the bride has her own Vision she
[29:17] has her own Ministry amen it's
[29:20] completely different from the vision of
[29:22] Elijah but yet it's the same because it
[29:25] does not contradict Elijah amen maa's
[29:28] Vision brought Clarity to Elijah's
[29:31] prophecy because Elijah had a prophecy
[29:34] the dogs were going to lick your blood
[29:36] but micaiah's Vision showed how it was
[29:38] going to
[29:39] happen amen micaiah's Vision was able to
[29:42] see in that higher Dimension how the
[29:44] Lord is bringing Elijah's prophecy to
[29:48] pass amen and that is why in this hour
[29:52] and my title for today is that the bride
[29:55] is walking and living in her vision amen
[29:58] she is not walking and living in a
[30:00] vision of 50 years ago amen she is
[30:04] caught up in the message of Elijah but
[30:06] she is hearing directly from the Lord
[30:08] she is getting fresh manner from the
[30:10] Lord amen amen she's not restricted and
[30:14] saying I'm only quoting the words of
[30:16] William
[30:18] vanam
[30:25] amen now we see that is being the
[30:28] problem Amen in the church world today
[30:29] or should we say in the message world
[30:31] all these years is because people were
[30:35] caught up in the message of William
[30:36] Branham which was the first phase amen
[30:39] and which is necessary but then they did
[30:42] not come to the stage where they are
[30:44] walking in their own Vision where they
[30:46] have a connection to the Angelic realm
[30:49] where they are having the vision for
[30:50] themselves and walking in the vision of
[30:52] the Lord for themselves in this hour
[30:55] amen because William Brandon prophesied
[30:57] many things over this bride amen but you
[31:01] can stay content with just hearing the
[31:03] prophecies but until you come to the
[31:05] stage where you are walking in the
[31:07] vision amen and then you are the
[31:09] Fulfillment of Prophecy in your day amen
[31:12] then it does not do you any good just to
[31:14] quote the Prophecies of William
[31:16] Branham so and that is where Mah found
[31:19] himself and we know the bride is under a
[31:22] prophetic anointing amen because in
[31:25] Revelation we know in Revelation 10: 8
[31:27] to 11 11 the Bride is a prophetic
[31:30] Ministry amen and the bride is called to
[31:33] prophesy again but notice when the bride
[31:35] is called to prophesy again she is
[31:38] caught up in her own Vision because
[31:40] remember John is typing the bride right
[31:43] and
[31:44] John in the first phase of his ministry
[31:47] was following his messenger which was
[31:49] Jesus Christ amen he was groomed under
[31:52] the ministry of Jesus Christ and he
[31:54] followed that message but they had to
[31:56] and and under that message the John's
[31:58] Ministry was just to relate the events
[32:00] of Jesus Christ and what Jesus Christ
[32:02] came to do amen but there came a time
[32:05] when John was caught up in the spirit
[32:08] there came a time when John was caught
[32:10] up in a vision amen and he began to
[32:12] identify himself amen and after the
[32:15] church ages is coming to an end in
[32:17] Revelation 3 in Revelation 4 Johnny is
[32:20] caught up amen and then John now is
[32:22] starting to walk in his own
[32:24] visionen and when John begins to do that
[32:27] now he comes into contact with a mighty
[32:29] Angel and then the mighty Angel hands in
[32:32] the book and saying now thou must
[32:34] prophesy again amen amen and then when
[32:36] he's walking in his own Vision that's
[32:38] when he's prophesying
[32:41] again now you see got you got to you got
[32:43] to match the the types right because the
[32:46] prophet said if you don't match it right
[32:48] you're going to have your picture wrong
[32:49] amen you're going to have the cow eating
[32:50] grass from on top of the tree so in
[32:52] order to match that type of Mah amen
[32:55] you've got to come into your own Vision
[32:57] you've got to he directly from the Lord
[32:59] now let me ask you this in 2023 2024 and
[33:04] 2025 who revealed to us amen the
[33:07] connection to the Angelic world who
[33:09] revealed to us in 2024 sharing in his
[33:12] glory who revealed to us in 2025 doors
[33:15] being open was it William Brandon or was
[33:17] it the bride walking in our own
[33:20] Vision amen the bride is beginning to
[33:22] walk in her own Vision she's beginning
[33:25] beginning to have this connection to the
[33:26] Angelic realm where she can hear
[33:28] directly from the
[33:30] Lord and notice even though she's
[33:32] walking in her own Vision her vision
[33:35] does not contradict the message of
[33:37] William brandom in fact it is only
[33:39] bringing Clarity and making the prophecy
[33:41] of William brandham come to pass
[33:47] amen so we believe amen that this is a
[33:50] season opened up unto the bride where
[33:52] she is now progressing from hearing
[33:55] Elijah's prophecy to hearing from the
[33:57] Lord Lord and getting a fresh word and
[33:59] vision in season and a vision and word
[34:03] will match William brandom's prophecy
[34:05] amen
[34:12] amen
[34:15] amen I'm trying to skip a lot because I
[34:18] want to I want to get to the point of
[34:19] the message so that we don't uh amen
[34:22] make it too long because amen when you
[34:24] if you can get to the point of the
[34:26] message there after I will years just
[34:28] start to di down
[34:33] amen so we see over the years amen the
[34:36] bride amen all they could do amen before
[34:40] the bride comes into a vision all she
[34:42] could do was relates William R's
[34:45] prophecy that is why you see such
[34:47] excitement when we see certain events
[34:49] coming to pass we see maybe we see a
[34:52] driverless car being invented everyone
[34:53] gets excited they start posting on
[34:55] Facebook they start posting everywhere
[34:57] this is William Brandon's prophecy they
[34:59] saw Hillary Clinton run for office they
[35:01] got excited they said this is William
[35:03] Brandon's prophecy they saw Kamala
[35:06] Harris run for president they got
[35:08] excited they said this is the prophecy
[35:11] then Trump wins the election and they
[35:12] say no the Catholic church was the woman
[35:14] that the prophet prophesied about why
[35:16] because all she can do is relate Bron's
[35:18] prophecy if she's not walking in her own
[35:21] Vision then she cannot determine with
[35:24] Clarity when his prophecy comes to pass
[35:28] amen if she's only relating his prophecy
[35:31] only when it comes to pass then she can
[35:33] say this is that which Brandon
[35:35] prophesied but when she is walking in
[35:37] her own Vision then she knows in season
[35:40] what God is doing she doesn't have to
[35:42] get excited at every headline amen we
[35:44] find some message people are headline
[35:46] message Believers as soon as we see
[35:48] something the Facebook feed gets flooded
[35:51] with message quotes say man we saw it in
[35:53] the Los Angeles Fire as soon as the fire
[35:55] started all the quotes started flooding
[35:57] Facebook about William Brandon's
[35:59] prophecy amen and sometimes we even see
[36:02] you know it's sad to see some believers
[36:04] who cannot do proper research they start
[36:06] to post fake news because they start to
[36:08] PO post fake pictures you you see it in
[36:11] the Los Angeles fires they started to
[36:13] post all kinds of things like the
[36:14] Hollywood sign on fire those are fake
[36:17] pictures and those leave room for
[36:19] critics such as people like believe the
[36:21] sign to come now and criticize us amen
[36:25] why because some Believers are just
[36:26] headline believers they get excited for
[36:28] these things but they they're not
[36:30] walking in vision and in line with the
[36:32] spirit to know what's happening in
[36:39] season and that is why you know the
[36:42] Bible says we read in the beginning
[36:43] where there is no vision the people
[36:45] perish amen and that is why over the
[36:48] years we see amen the bars been let down
[36:51] amen what is it people letting sin
[36:54] coming into the message we see all kinds
[36:56] of sin and false teachings and eight
[36:59] Messengers and even to the extent of
[37:01] seeing uh homosexuality treatment in the
[37:04] message and alcoholism and all of these
[37:06] things why is this a people living or a
[37:09] people perishing it's showing signs of a
[37:11] people perishing why they're not walking
[37:13] in Vision cuz where there's no vision
[37:16] the people
[37:25] perish now as I was saying you know we
[37:27] relates every time Revelation 10: 11 and
[37:32] how the bride must prophesy again and
[37:34] every time you know some people they
[37:36] think that's just coaching the prophet
[37:38] and that is why you get movements now
[37:40] like just press play and so forth now
[37:43] can you imagine that the bride has to
[37:46] walk in her own Vision where she hears
[37:48] directly from God because there is no
[37:50] disconnection between the groom and the
[37:52] bride the bride and groom is not in
[37:55] Union now can you imagine Rebecca after
[37:58] being married to Isaac and coming into
[38:00] Union with Isaac imagine her conducting
[38:03] her household now and she goes to the
[38:05] servants and say Ela told me this and
[38:08] this and this do this and do this it
[38:11] would sound crazy to them because she's
[38:13] now married to Isaac she's under the
[38:15] headship of Isaac El's message was only
[38:18] to get her to Isaac and to open up the
[38:21] communication between her and Isaac but
[38:24] now that the communication is opened up
[38:26] between her and Isaac
[38:27] amen she's walking in that Vision she
[38:30] hears directly from a
[38:32] groom amen and this is the point we are
[38:35] getting to is when you have Elijah's
[38:37] prophecy amen you don't know exactly
[38:40] when the vision comes to pass but our
[38:43] vision that we speak matches his
[38:46] prophecy amen it does not contradict it
[38:48] one
[38:50] B amen and notice Micaiah said to them
[38:55] if you return it all today the Lord has
[38:57] not spoken to me amen notice he did not
[38:59] say if you return at all the Lord has
[39:02] not spoken to Elijah he said if you
[39:05] return at all the Lord has not spoken to
[39:06] me amen he had confidence in what the
[39:09] Lord spoke to him and you've got to have
[39:11] confidence in what the Lord speaks to
[39:13] you youve got to have confidence in Your
[39:15] Vision amen you now when I say Vision
[39:18] don't mistake me to only mean the gift
[39:21] of Prophecy and the gift of Sina I'm
[39:23] talking about the vision of your life
[39:25] the goal the purpose you year that God
[39:26] puts you here on Sunday even Joseph had
[39:29] his dream that was the purpose of his
[39:31] life that was the vision for his life
[39:33] amen so I'm not just referring to a gift
[39:35] of Prophecy and and and just seeing a
[39:37] vision now I'm referring to the vision
[39:39] for the bride her goal her purpose and
[39:42] we know that the bride even though it's
[39:44] a body of Christ it's an individual walk
[39:46] so what is the vision of your life you
[39:48] need to walk in the vision of your life
[39:50] amen and you need to be confident in
[39:52] what God is speaking to you yes amen
[39:55] amen and then that extends to the local
[39:57] church when God is speaking here in the
[39:59] local church you need to have confidence
[40:01] in what God is saying for your season in
[40:03] your local assembly amen and then that
[40:05] extends to the fivefold word while where
[40:08] the bride has to have confidence in what
[40:10] is been coming through the fivefold
[40:12] because that's the vision of the Lord
[40:14] for this day
[40:17] amen that is why the prophet said these
[40:19] young men will come on and make sense of
[40:21] this message and carry this message on
[40:23] because they got to walk in season and
[40:25] vision amen
[40:29] and we know we've been heing for the
[40:31] last few weeks about our vision amen and
[40:34] walking in that
[40:37] vision and we see that this is the
[40:40] season amen that's opened up unto the
[40:42] bride
[40:45] now we want to go to amen Daniel and we
[40:50] see
[40:51] that Daniel Amen believed amen the
[40:54] message of Jeremiah because he if you
[40:57] notice Daniel was here in captivity and
[41:00] Daniel says I know from reading the
[41:02] Scrolls amen he says I've learned from
[41:04] reading the Scrolls whose Scrolls were
[41:06] there Jeremiah the prophet that we were
[41:08] going to be here in captivity for 70
[41:11] years so in other words Daniel had the
[41:14] prophecy of the messenger
[41:16] Jeremiah but there come a time and
[41:18] season where Daniel needed to hear from
[41:20] the Lord
[41:22] himself because for as long as he has
[41:25] believed in the prophecy of Jeremiah he
[41:27] did not have Clarity amen of when they
[41:30] were going to leave so he needed to hear
[41:33] from God
[41:34] himself and so Daniel we know begin to
[41:36] fast and pray he begin to wait upon the
[41:38] Lord and what happened by doing that God
[41:41] started another counseling Heaven just
[41:44] like how in Mah's time God had a counsel
[41:46] in heaven and notice here again in
[41:49] season this door is open up un Daniel a
[41:52] supernatural realm is opened up unto him
[41:55] Angelic visitation
[41:57] amen and not only Angelic visitation
[41:59] from the Heavenly realm Daniel now is
[42:01] also exposed to the prince of the power
[42:04] of the air because the angel is telling
[42:06] him that amen he's defeating and he's
[42:09] going back to fight amen the Prince of
[42:11] Persia these doors are being opened up
[42:13] to Daniel and it's bringing Clarity to
[42:16] Jeremiah's
[42:17] prophecy now look at this right Jeremiah
[42:21] just prophesied that they were going to
[42:23] be there for 77 for 70
[42:25] years but but now when Daniel walks in
[42:28] his vision look at the clarity now he's
[42:31] given exactly what the Lord is going to
[42:33] do from that point right until the end
[42:35] of time Amen in other words Daniel's
[42:38] Vision extends far into
[42:41] eternity amen just like how Elijah's
[42:44] prophecy was just that the dogs were
[42:46] going to lick your blood but micaiah's
[42:48] prophecy brought
[42:49] Clarity and so that is what the prophet
[42:51] William Brandon meant when he said these
[42:54] young men will come on and make sense of
[42:56] this message and sweep it onto the
[42:57] coming of the Lord amen because when the
[43:00] bride is walking in a vision and walking
[43:03] in connection with that realm she is
[43:05] able not to discern the signs of the
[43:07] times
[43:08] amen
[43:14] amen now let's read what the prophet
[43:19] says and he said who can we get to go
[43:22] down there and deceive Ahab amen and
[43:25] bring him out there in the field so he
[43:27] can get killed to fulfill the word of
[43:30] Elijah and the prophet says Glory
[43:32] Hallelujah how God will stand behind his
[43:35] word that was a prophet that said that
[43:38] who was Elijah right but Jesus said now
[43:40] he's bringing it to us if you say to
[43:43] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[43:45] but believe what you said will come to
[43:47] pass you can have what you said when you
[43:50] know it's the word of the Lord speaking
[43:53] that's why I could say to that woman
[43:54] that had a big tumor to the lady with
[43:57] the cancer here tonight the different
[43:59] ones because first it's a vision notice
[44:02] now the prophet says it's a vision it
[44:04] comes it Compares with the word he's the
[44:07] same yesterday today and forever there's
[44:09] the vision then it happens it's thus say
[44:12] the Lord and it has to happen nothing
[44:15] can stop it now it had been a long time
[44:17] since Elijah had made this prophecy it's
[44:20] been years since William brandham
[44:22] prophesied over this bride he'd been in
[44:25] glory a long time amen William vam has
[44:28] been in glory a long time now but he
[44:30] would he made his made this prophecy and
[44:33] he know it was coming to pass and then
[44:36] Micaiah knew that Elijah was a man of
[44:38] God here was God up in heaven holding a
[44:41] counsel up there how to bring the word
[44:44] of Elijah to pass and if you got the
[44:47] word of the Lord and will speak the word
[44:49] of the Lord and don't doubt the word of
[44:51] the Lord God will hold a council meeting
[44:53] to make your word come to pass amen amen
[44:56] when when the bride has thus said the
[44:58] Lord amen when she speaks to this
[45:00] mountain amen the prophet is saying God
[45:02] will hold a counsel in heaven Amen to
[45:05] bring your word to pass amen I remember
[45:07] we remembering prayer requests amen but
[45:10] we've already spoken a word over those
[45:12] prayer requests amen our pastor Ruben
[45:14] Daniel we've already spoken a word amen
[45:16] that it must dry up from the roots amen
[45:19] our brothers like brother Danver and so
[45:21] forth we've already spoken a word amen
[45:25] amen and the prophet says God will hold
[45:27] the counsel in heaven to bring your word
[45:29] to pass now I want you to notice how
[45:31] powerful that is amen when you are
[45:33] speaking a word you are not just
[45:35] speaking a word like a normal human
[45:36] being amen but when you are speaking you
[45:38] are speaking as a Son of God you are
[45:40] walking in line with your vision and
[45:42] your vision does not contradict Elijah's
[45:45] prophecy because Elijah's prophecy said
[45:47] you will be a super Church you will be a
[45:50] super race you will be an invincible
[45:52] Army but now you are walking in line
[45:54] with your vision and when you speak when
[45:56] you prophesy again God will hold a
[45:59] counsel Amen to bring your words to pass
[46:01] amen God even goes to the extent amen of
[46:05] bringing up the Demonic world and says
[46:07] who will go before us to deceive Ahab
[46:10] amen God will go to any extreme measure
[46:13] to bring your word to pass amen that is
[46:15] how powerful your words are so I want
[46:18] you to notice any word that you have
[46:20] spoken over your life maybe in times
[46:22] past and maybe it's been tearing we know
[46:25] the book of Hab habac amen though the
[46:27] vision T amen it will come to pass amen
[46:31] why you've spoken a word and God is
[46:34] bringing things in order amen God is
[46:36] instructing the Angelic realm God is
[46:39] using any measure to bring your word to
[46:41] pass amen hallelujah amen that ought to
[46:44] make us rejoice amen because that ought
[46:46] to know the power that lays within us
[46:49] amen that just at the speaking of our
[46:51] word amen it is instructing Angels amen
[46:54] because the angels are ministering
[46:55] Spirits in this hour to the a of
[46:57] Salvation amen so when you speak a word
[47:00] amen amen the angels are being
[47:02] instructed Amen to go forth amen because
[47:05] when Daniel begin to wait upon the Lord
[47:07] amen and when Daniel needed instruction
[47:09] amen God sent his messenger amen God
[47:12] said Gabriel amen and when Micaiah amen
[47:16] waited upon the Lord amen he could see
[47:19] amen what the Lord was doing amen
[47:21] hallelujah and notice God brought both
[47:24] Elijah and micaiah's prophecy to pass
[47:28] amen and God will bring both William
[47:29] bram's prophecy and the prophecy of this
[47:32] end time right to pass amen
[47:35] hallelujah
[47:40] amen
[47:42] hallelujah amen ain't it good amen when
[47:45] we know our word is backed up amen the
[47:47] words that we speak amen like God when
[47:49] he speaks he says my word will not
[47:52] return unto me void amen that is why
[47:54] when a Son of God speaks like God Amen
[47:56] his word will not return unto him void
[47:59] amen hallelujah now let's let's ask
[48:03] ourself in the season amen why are doors
[48:05] being opened
[48:06] up why in this particular season doors
[48:10] are being opened up the Book of Matthew
[48:13] 7 says ask and it shall be given unto
[48:17] you seek and you shall find knock and it
[48:20] shall be open unto you for everyone that
[48:23] ask it receive it and he that seeketh
[48:25] find it and him that knock it shall be
[48:28] open so why are doors being opened up in
[48:30] this hour because there's been a people
[48:33] from 2023 that's been knocking on the
[48:35] door amen there's been a people that
[48:38] been consecrating themselves in the year
[48:39] 2023 saying Lord we want to experience a
[48:42] supernatural Lord we want a connection
[48:44] to this Unseen World knocking on the
[48:47] door amen and then come 2024 Lord we
[48:49] want to share your glory amen Lord to
[48:52] him who ascending the hill amen will
[48:54] share in his glory knocking on the door
[48:56] amen
[48:57] and God says okay fine since you've been
[48:59] knocking my word must come to pass if
[49:01] you knock the door shall be opened up
[49:03] unto you that is why in this season the
[49:05] doors are being opened up Amen to the
[49:07] bride that is why in this season
[49:09] whatever you say shall come to pass
[49:12] because the door has being opened up
[49:13] unto you amen God is not a liar amen we
[49:16] heard that on Sunday God is not a man
[49:18] that he should lie if you knock the door
[49:20] must be open amen if you are Desiring a
[49:24] connection to the Unseen World he that
[49:26] hunger shall be filled amen
[49:30] hallelujah so that is why these doors
[49:32] have been opened there's been a people
[49:35] amen that is why in the time of Daniel
[49:37] God sent his Angel because Daniel was
[49:39] crying
[49:40] out amen that is why in the time of
[49:42] Egypt God sent his messenger deliverer
[49:45] because the people were crying out and
[49:47] the cries come up to the Lord hallelujah
[49:49] when God's people begin to cry out God
[49:51] sends an answer
[49:55] am thank you Lord
[49:59] so we see Jesus as well lived in a world
[50:02] of perfect Faith amen Jesus lived in a
[50:05] world of vision Jesus was walking in the
[50:08] vision of himself amen and that is why
[50:10] his ministry was so powerful he said I
[50:12] can do nothing except I see the father
[50:15] do likewise and the prophet tells us he
[50:17] has living in a world of perfect Faith
[50:19] living in a world of vision and if the
[50:21] bridegroom lived in a world of vision
[50:24] the bride has to do likewise if she is
[50:26] born of his bone flesh of his flesh word
[50:28] of his word Spirit of his Spirit then
[50:31] she too must live in a world of
[50:33] vision that is why Joel 2: 28 says in
[50:37] the last days you young men will see
[50:39] Visions you old men will dream dreams
[50:41] amen walking in their
[50:46] Vision the prophet says well how could
[50:48] he do anything else because he tested
[50:51] his vision with the word of God and
[50:53] notice when you are walking in season
[50:55] and in vision your vision you must match
[50:57] it up to the word of God and that is why
[51:00] any doctrine that comes must match up
[51:02] back to the word of William brandham and
[51:04] the word of God
[51:06] Amen and you know that the word of God
[51:09] that said to Abraham amen about Elijah
[51:11] and how the dogs will lick their blood
[51:14] amen Micaiah had based his faith upon
[51:17] the vision first notice you base your
[51:20] faith upon the vision of yourself first
[51:23] and then he took his vision and compared
[51:25] it to the word of God
[51:27] so when God reveals something to you you
[51:29] got to have confidence in it and then
[51:31] how do you can have more confidence is
[51:33] you take it and match it up with the
[51:34] word of the
[51:36] Lord then he know he was right that's
[51:39] the way you ought to do it if our
[51:41] theology will take the word of God and
[51:43] the things that we do and he DB taals
[51:45] Through the Bible completely with the
[51:47] Bible That's All
[51:49] Right amen he said you'll see someday so
[51:54] Mah was so confident in his vision amen
[51:56] that when the Prophet ezekiah this false
[51:59] prophet came to him and said which way
[52:00] did the spirit of the Lord leave me when
[52:03] God spoke to
[52:04] you Mah was so confident in his vision
[52:07] and he said you'll see someday sitting
[52:09] there Elijah prophesied it and maka's
[52:13] vision compared with the word of
[52:16] God Micaiah could not have faith unless
[52:20] his vision compared with the word of the
[52:22] Lord amen so in this season when we are
[52:24] walking with god let's always make sure
[52:27] that our vision goes back to the word
[52:29] let's Don't Drift Away from Elijah amen
[52:32] maybe some might misunderstand me when I
[52:34] say our vision we must walk in our own
[52:36] Vision but I'm saying our vision must
[52:38] dve tail with Elijah amen we can't stay
[52:41] away from Elijah amen we can't stray
[52:44] away from the word of the Lord
[52:57] amen we see as I said before John as
[52:59] well was caught up in vision and we see
[53:02] how the prophet said Jesus said to them
[53:05] what is it to you if he terries talking
[53:07] about John now and the disciples ask
[53:09] what what's going to happen to John and
[53:11] he says what is it to you if he terries
[53:13] until I come till I return what is it
[53:16] and the disciples made a mistake they
[53:18] said that Jesus said that he was going
[53:21] to live till the coming but Jesus didn't
[53:23] make no mistake right here in Revelation
[53:26] ch 4 Christ kept his word he brought
[53:29] John up into heaven and rehearsed the
[53:31] whole thing to him he saw the preview he
[53:35] saw it just as though he lived on the
[53:36] earth and he saw the whole church Ages
[53:39] come to pass to the coming of the Lord
[53:41] the whole book of Revelation see John
[53:43] was walking in the vision of that amen
[53:46] even though he did not live to see the
[53:48] literal Return of the Lord but he was
[53:51] caught up in this vision and he lived in
[53:53] that
[53:54] Vision we noce Mary amen we coming to
[53:57] the climax of the message amen we notice
[54:01] Mary there had been a
[54:03] prophecy for hundreds of years 400 to
[54:06] 700 years that a virgin was going to
[54:10] conceive and in the time of Mary that
[54:12] was the message for their day because
[54:14] week in week out the priest will read a
[54:17] virgin shall conceive a virgin shall
[54:19] conceive and they were expecting and
[54:21] waiting for the
[54:23] Messiah so in other words the prophet's
[54:25] prophecy of virgin shall conceive type
[54:28] that now with Elijah and his
[54:30] prophecy because there's been a prophecy
[54:32] that this bride is going to conceive as
[54:34] well and bring forth the word made flesh
[54:36] in this hour now Mary could have
[54:39] believed that prophecy all through her
[54:41] life as she was growing up but he would
[54:43] have done no good for her until the door
[54:46] was opened up in season to Mary to come
[54:49] into connection with an Angelic realm
[54:51] and the Holy Spirit overshadowed her and
[54:54] that's when she could say be unto me and
[54:56] now as Mary's conceived in her and she's
[55:00] walking in a pregnancy for 9 months
[55:02] she's walking in a vision all the years
[55:04] she was hearing the prophecy of Isaiah a
[55:07] virgin shall conceive a virgin shall
[55:09] conceive but now she's walking in the
[55:11] vision amen you don't have to refer back
[55:14] anymore to Isiah a virgin shall conceive
[55:17] now you look at Mary and say Here's the
[55:19] vision walking in flesh amen that is the
[55:22] hour now that the bride is in amen you
[55:25] don't have to refer back to Malachi's
[55:27] prophecy anymore because here's the
[55:29] bride walking in flesh amen and notice
[55:32] amen when Mary conceived amen and then
[55:35] he she brought for the child the vision
[55:36] now extended to Jesus the word made
[55:39] flesh and he began to walk in the vision
[55:41] of his day amen the vision just
[55:43] continues extending
[55:47] [Music]
[55:49] amen amen we know that she gave birth
[55:52] Amen to the word made flesh amen the
[55:54] walking vision of her day
[55:56] amen
[56:00] hallelujah now
[56:02] notice the Pharisees when Mary was
[56:05] walking in her vision the Pharisees
[56:08] believing the message of their day which
[56:09] was a virgin shall conceive was still
[56:12] preaching the same message every week
[56:14] that a virgin shall conceive a virgin
[56:17] shall conceive but here is the Virgin
[56:18] who already conceived in fact she
[56:20] already even gave birth to the word made
[56:22] flesh but the message Believers of those
[56:25] day was still quoting no a virgin is
[56:27] going to conceive a virgin is going to
[56:29] conceive that is why you got to
[56:31] recognize in this hour that the bride is
[56:34] already bringing forth the word made
[56:35] flesh you can't keep on referring back
[56:38] to what the prophecy was you got to look
[56:40] at what the prophecy is now amen the
[56:43] bride is produced the word made flesh in
[56:45] this hour she's walking vision of that
[56:47] amen if not you just take on a Pharisee
[56:50] spirit amen amen

[56:55] next slide just to climax here amen how
