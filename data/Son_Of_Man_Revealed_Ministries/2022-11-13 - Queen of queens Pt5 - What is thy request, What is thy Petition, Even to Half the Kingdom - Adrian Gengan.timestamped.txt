[4:54] be tense
[4:55] amen you're in the presence of your
[4:57] father the King of Kings and the Lord of
[4:59] lords amen hallelujah so this morning
[5:02] we'll continue with our amen series
[5:04] queen of Queens this is part five amen
[5:08] and we'll speak on
[5:11] hallelujah amen
[5:15] what is thy request what is that
[5:17] petition
[5:19] even to off the kingdom
[5:21] amen
[5:23] Hallelujah
[5:26] we'll turn to Hebrews chapter 4 as the
[5:28] start of our scripture
[5:31] because we know that
[5:33] there was a change in the scene Esther
[5:36] is a beautiful book because it starts
[5:39] out with a beautiful scene of the king
[5:41] and his kingdom
[5:43] and now he wants to flaunt the wealth of
[5:45] his kingdom
[5:46] and after he he does a tremendous
[5:49] display of all his witches he wants to
[5:52] bring forth his most prized possession
[5:55] and like the Lord says we are his
[5:58] victory
[5:59] the queen of Queens is his victory
[6:02] amen the final thing that he can show
[6:05] and the reason for his death is us the
[6:08] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ now this
[6:10] King aserus wants to bring forth his
[6:12] most beautiful beloved shroud and not
[6:15] trophy do we don't believe in Trophy
[6:16] Wives but his most beloved treasure and
[6:20] bringer and show the people because the
[6:22] Bible says she was very beautiful
[6:24] but she refused to come and if you're
[6:27] we're not reading that now but I'm just
[6:28] giving you the background and he called
[6:30] seven chamberlains to call vasty to the
[6:34] feast to call her out and seven churches
[6:38] Messengers have gone out into the world
[6:40] to call it right out
[6:42] but we find at the end of that seven
[6:44] Church age they refuse to come they even
[6:46] locked the door and shut him out yes
[6:49] amen so that's when the king makes he
[6:52] consults his wise men and they make a
[6:54] declaration put vasty away lest the rest
[6:58] of the woman start a woman's Liberation
[6:59] and say that we want to be like basti
[7:02] and we won't obey our husbands so they
[7:05] started the Pentecostal I'm not the
[7:08] original Pentecostal church now but they
[7:10] started the denominational Pentecostal
[7:13] eyelid system right there
[7:17] okay
[7:18] so from there you'll see the scene
[7:19] changing there there's a time now where
[7:22] they are looking amongst the young
[7:24] virgins we spoke on Wednesday about the
[7:27] ten virgins amen so they were looking
[7:30] amongst the virgins and there was one
[7:33] who was obedient
[7:34] to the one who was instructing her and
[7:37] even now that she was going to approach
[7:39] the king for the first time she only
[7:41] took what he advised them to take
[7:43] right the same way we the one that was
[7:46] commissioned to find a bride for the
[7:48] Lord Jesus Christ because when he was
[7:51] looking for the scripture he said go
[7:52] hunt me a bride like elieza so he has
[7:56] designed his job he's designed to find
[7:58] the Lord Jesus Christ a virgin bride in
[8:00] this hour
[8:01] so the only thing he gave us was the
[8:04] word pure and adulterated word and he
[8:07] said take this and go into the presence
[8:09] of the king
[8:10] amen amen and when we take the pure word
[8:13] undiluted amen and go before his
[8:16] presence we are accepted amen and then
[8:19] we are now placed Queen amongst all
[8:21] queens
[8:22] yes Amen in his Royal Kingdom and now
[8:25] the marriage has taken place but then
[8:27] there is now a change in the scene she's
[8:30] now Queen in the Kingdom
[8:32] and she may have been Queen for many
[8:34] years but there's now a threat upon her
[8:36] life and the life of her people
[8:39] there's coming a persecution whether you
[8:41] believe it or not this coming a squeeze
[8:44] whether you believe it or not and if you
[8:47] do not have boldness to go into the
[8:48] presence of the king and call on him
[8:52] amen you are going to be left to the
[8:55] ones that are pursuing you so let's read
[8:57] Hebrews 4 and 14. it says seeing then we
[9:00] have a great high priest that is passed
[9:02] into the heavens Jesus the son of God
[9:05] so where is Jesus
[9:07] he's in the heavens let us all fast our
[9:10] profession
[9:12] for we for we have not an eye priest
[9:15] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[9:16] of our infirmities but was in all points
[9:19] tempted as we are yet without sin
[9:23] so once Jesus tempted with adultery yes
[9:27] was he tempted of fornication was he
[9:29] tempted with the lust of the flesh the
[9:31] lust of the eyes the pride of life the
[9:34] Bible says he was tempted on all points
[9:36] but yet without sin
[9:39] now here's the point we want to get to
[9:41] because you know we're getting to the
[9:43] point where Esther enters the throne
[9:45] room so he tells us in verse 16 let us
[9:49] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[9:51] grace
[9:52] that we may obtain mercy and find Grace
[9:56] to help in the time of need amen Esther
[9:59] was in a great time of need the bride
[10:01] right now is in a great time of need but
[10:04] we know need to come boldly unto the
[10:06] throne of grace that we may obtain favor
[10:09] and find Grace to help in the time of
[10:12] need amen may the Lord a blessings to
[10:14] the reading of his word you may be
[10:15] seated
[10:17] amen
[10:20] so as amen just to uh
[10:24] talk about it as you know today there is
[10:26] something happening on Mount Sinai we
[10:28] spoke about this on Wednesday amen so
[10:31] you know they have they have now the one
[10:33] agreement that was signed in September
[10:34] the final document for the world
[10:36] religions to unite
[10:39] now under the U.N the climate change the
[10:42] pope has now called for them to go to
[10:43] Mount Sinai and re-establish The Ten
[10:46] Commandments not the original Ten
[10:49] Commandments that was given to Moses and
[10:51] his people now watch how significant it
[10:54] is
[10:55] because God called his chosen people to
[10:59] Mount Sinai
[11:00] and he took his Prophet up onto that
[11:02] mountain
[11:03] and the glory Cloud descended upon that
[11:06] mountain
[11:07] and he gave his chosen people Ten
[11:10] Commandments to live by
[11:13] he didn't call all the nations of the
[11:15] world
[11:16] he didn't call the Philistines and the
[11:18] hittite and all the other ice
[11:21] to Mount Sinai
[11:23] but he called a specific class of people
[11:26] to Mount Sinai and he gave them his word
[11:29] to live by
[11:32] now that they have formed a one-word
[11:34] religion the First Act is to go back to
[11:37] Mount Sinai
[11:39] with all the religions
[11:42] and form another ten commandments
[11:46] why are they doing this they are
[11:49] believing that they are caused the chaos
[11:52] upon the Earth in the terms of climate
[11:54] change
[11:55] and we showed you that in Revelation
[11:57] chapter 11 verse 18 how God is going to
[12:00] destroy them that destroy the Earth
[12:04] so man knows that he has destroyed the
[12:06] Earth
[12:10] and now they're coming for ten ten plus
[12:13] one brother Caleb okay
[12:15] they want to add 11th one as well but we
[12:18] do have an 11. they didn't just add one
[12:20] because when Jesus came he said
[12:22] what was the 11th commandment
[12:26] you know it
[12:28] hey
[12:31] that you are my disciples if you have
[12:34] loved one for another you see Satan is a
[12:37] copycat
[12:39] so the 11th commandment is love
[12:42] and you remember what the prophet
[12:43] teaches us that all the Commandments are
[12:45] Rapture around one thing which is love
[12:47] because if you love your neighbor you
[12:48] won't steal his wife
[12:52] if you love your neighbor you won't kill
[12:55] him you won't steal right so the all the
[12:58] Commandments are wrapped around love and
[13:00] Jesus was the personification of love
[13:03] and so we see here
[13:05] what we're looking at is Esther
[13:09] because Esther there's two books in the
[13:12] Bible that are named after women
[13:15] both typing the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[13:18] Christ one book is Ruth
[13:21] where Boaz is the great Redeemer and he
[13:24] redeems Ruth
[13:26] a gentile
[13:28] a moabite
[13:30] he redeems her and the second one she
[13:33] now suits his Queen Esther
[13:36] so two books in the Bible very precise
[13:39] amen showing you the condition of the
[13:41] church woman and a position that she is
[13:44] going to be one redeemed second she is
[13:46] going to sit as Queen because the one
[13:48] who overcomes later seer
[13:50] told in us to come and sit with me on my
[13:53] throne
[13:54] all right and we are Believing by faith
[13:57] that we have already overcome leaders
[13:59] here
[14:01] hallelujah how many of you can speak by
[14:03] faith yeah
[14:04] amen that we have already overcome this
[14:07] age
[14:08] amen we need to speak it by faith we
[14:11] need to believe it by faith
[14:13] because we're calling those things that
[14:15] are not as though they are
[14:17] amen amen why we are life of his life
[14:20] Spirit of his Spirit the same
[14:22] characteristics that Jesus had we have
[14:25] even before Jesus was dead and they
[14:28] crucified him he said destroy this
[14:30] Temple and in three days I shall raise
[14:32] it up again amen amen what was he
[14:35] speaking he was speaking the revelation
[14:37] of his faith
[14:38] hey so this bride needs to speak amen
[14:42] hallelujah I shall overcome this age
[14:44] amen I shall not be defeated by the
[14:47] enemy yes or any of his teams amen so we
[14:50] find here what is happening that four
[14:53] times
[14:55] she comes into the presence of the king
[14:59] four different times and four different
[15:01] times his words are added to Queen
[15:04] Esther
[15:06] so four times the king asked Esther a
[15:09] question
[15:10] and he empowers Esther every time
[15:14] with the ability to speak and to ask
[15:18] so in the presence of the king with a
[15:21] royal ship to raise the king empowers
[15:24] Esther and what is he saying what is
[15:26] that petition what is thy request even
[15:30] throughout the kingdom
[15:33] except on that fourth time
[15:36] the fourth time he doesn't say even to
[15:38] ask the kingdom
[15:40] but three times he tells her even to ask
[15:43] the kingdom
[15:44] amen there's a reason for all of that
[15:47] now what we're trying to get through is
[15:48] tie this with the four anointings
[15:52] now let's pick this up for the Caleb in
[15:53] the fifth seal let's read from paragraph
[15:55] 141 amen
[15:58] and see uh before we get into that I
[16:00] just want to show you what the prophet
[16:01] says about these four anointings and how
[16:04] they were going so that you can see it
[16:06] where history is going into the presence
[16:08] of the king because the king is a lion
[16:11] um
[16:13] hello the king is a lion and she comes
[16:16] under that lion anointing
[16:18] amen
[16:20] if we get it amen in the full steal
[16:22] paragraph 141 it says now the first
[16:26] words that lion that Roar that pure
[16:29] unadulterated word
[16:32] the second entire theory was the ox a
[16:36] beast of burden
[16:38] and it was also a sacrificial peace
[16:41] wasn't exactly the poor little church
[16:43] Romans settled down there to A Thousand
[16:46] Years of Dark Ages and anything that
[16:48] didn't profess to be the Roman Church
[16:50] was put to death immediately they had to
[16:53] labor go from place to place
[16:56] so that's the second anointing under the
[16:58] ox right
[17:00] he says in 144 now now if you notice
[17:03] that was packing and preserving that
[17:06] Bible and they had to labor among one
[17:08] another there you are the ox
[17:10] he said don't you Earth the oil and the
[17:13] wine
[17:14] 145 what did they do they willingly
[17:17] walked up there and died
[17:19] now watch Esther was willing to walk up
[17:21] there and die
[17:24] they didn't but care because the spirit
[17:26] of the church in that day was sacrificed
[17:28] labor and they walked up just as freely
[17:31] as they could walk Anointed with the
[17:34] true spirit of God of that age
[17:36] that's why I tell you we need a
[17:38] revelation that we have been anointed
[17:40] for the age
[17:42] yeah and died like Heroes a sacrifice
[17:46] thousand times thousands see eight
[17:49] million of them on the record
[17:52] 68 million Christians
[17:55] lay down their life
[17:58] for this gospel
[18:00] amen
[18:02] 147 he says now the third piece that
[18:05] went out from the devil was the black
[18:07] horse
[18:08] see 148 he says the third piece that
[18:12] went out a power from God to combat him
[18:14] to combat the powers of the black horse
[18:16] was a man cunning smart with the wisdom
[18:20] of God and we're gonna watch Esther
[18:22] operate in that cunning wisdom smart
[18:24] knows how to get Amen in trouble
[18:28] you know a man is smarter than any of
[18:31] the beasts he's smarter cause he cannot
[18:33] witch him mostly he is turning through
[18:38] now I already want you to know that the
[18:40] spirit of God is already here because
[18:43] what you are hearing this morning you
[18:44] will never hear anywhere else amen when
[18:46] yesterday is being preached you'll never
[18:48] get those four anointings tied in there
[18:50] so already know the spirit of God is
[18:52] here and you better get involved in the
[18:54] service amen amen amen the third piece
[18:58] that wins out a power from God to combat
[19:01] him to combat the powers of the black
[19:03] horse was a man telling smart with the
[19:05] wisdom of God you know a man is the
[19:08] smarter than any of the beasts he is
[19:10] smarter because he can outwit him mostly
[19:12] he is scanning shrewd 150 he went out to
[19:16] Convent him with the canniness of God's
[19:18] wisdom in him so it wasn't the wisdom of
[19:21] a man it was God's wisdom in man that
[19:24] was the age of the Reformation Martin
[19:26] Luther John Wesley and so forth it was
[19:30] the Reformation zwingly
[19:32] Knox Calvin who all went out it was the
[19:36] cunningness now you watch exactly from
[19:38] the Dark Age from the Reformation this
[19:40] way it was the shrewdness of man so
[19:42] that's where your third anointing
[19:44] we gotta go to The Sixth Seal to pick up
[19:46] that
[19:48] fought anointing because this is the one
[19:50] I wanted amen the fourth anointing in
[19:52] The Sixth Seal paragraph 385 amen
[19:56] he says here and father today we stand
[19:59] here by your grace
[20:01] and we are only here because of his
[20:03] grace amen right now this is in his
[20:06] prayer paragraph 385 you'll pick it up
[20:08] amen
[20:09] father today we stand here by your grace
[20:13] and it's not because that it's a special
[20:15] people but it's because just like in the
[20:18] day of the lion or the ox or the man
[20:21] it's the eagle time
[20:26] is the anointing of the hour
[20:30] it's the time that we are living here
[20:33] it's the working of the holy spirit for
[20:36] this particular time to prove that Jesus
[20:39] is not dead amen amen and if you're
[20:42] Jesus is dead then bury your Jesus and
[20:45] come to the Lord Jesus Christ amen yes
[20:48] amen
[20:49] Hallelujah
[20:52] amen so we find here we'll have to go to
[20:56] Esther chapter 5 now and pick up these
[20:58] things amen Esther chapter 5 and verse
[21:00] 3. so he said amen King service he is
[21:03] the king he's ruling in this Kingdom now
[21:05] before Esther could come into the
[21:07] presence of the king she made
[21:09] preparation
[21:11] and I want to put the denominational
[21:13] World on notice
[21:14] forget your Daniel Fast it will get you
[21:17] nowhere
[21:19] try the extra fast
[21:22] because the Daniel Fast he only ate
[21:25] vegetables
[21:27] amen
[21:29] but here the the extra fast is different
[21:33] hallelujah amen the Queen's fast is
[21:37] different
[21:38] nobody wants to talk about it's just
[21:40] fast
[21:47] we're not going into that but you can
[21:49] reach up to four and see Estes fast she
[21:51] got Mordecai too far she got the people
[21:53] to fast
[21:54] and she herself began to fast
[21:57] before she came into the presence of the
[21:59] king
[22:00] amen
[22:02] so let's read from verse 3.
[22:04] so now remember the scene is the throne
[22:07] room of the king
[22:09] there's a declaration gone across the
[22:11] land and everyone is fearful to ever
[22:13] come before the presence of the king
[22:16] that anyone who comes into the presence
[22:18] of the king uninvited
[22:20] shall be put to death and Esther informs
[22:24] Mordecai about this
[22:26] but she comes to that decision where she
[22:29] says if I perish I perish
[22:32] amen because Mordecai had told her who
[22:35] knows if you've been called into the
[22:37] kingdom for such a time as this you
[22:39] think you've gone there to live a royal
[22:41] life of luxury
[22:43] you are there to labor
[22:45] amen the life of a queen in the message
[22:48] of the hour is not just to live under
[22:51] the Royal blessings amen but you are to
[22:53] label to find the last one
[22:56] it's a sacrificial life
[22:59] yeah amen so the lion is King and under
[23:03] the lion anointing here you ask her a
[23:05] question she comes boldly before the
[23:08] presence of the king and she's watching
[23:10] Remember the situation is now tense she
[23:13] doesn't know if you're gonna raise up
[23:14] the Royal scripture
[23:16] because in a moment's time she'll be
[23:18] good taken away and killed
[23:21] but she walks there before the king
[23:25] and she's singing into thy presence we
[23:29] can't
[23:30] not by the works we have done
[23:34] but by thy Grace and thy Grace
[23:39] and then he raises at the Royal Center
[23:43] breathe a sigh of relief
[23:46] now we pick it up then the king said
[23:48] unto her
[23:49] what world thou Queen Esther
[23:52] remember Israel referring to her by a
[23:56] royal title
[23:58] yes
[24:00] now what will thou number one what do
[24:03] you want
[24:04] what is that request
[24:06] he doesn't need to go to the next part
[24:08] to surrender even to off his kingdom
[24:12] but he goes further and he says it shall
[24:14] be given thee even to a half the kingdom
[24:18] he don't even know why she's coming
[24:20] before him
[24:22] oh I want you to know he's reflecting
[24:24] the heart of the father
[24:26] that anytime you go before the father
[24:28] he's willing to give it all for you
[24:32] amen are we willing to ask of him this
[24:35] morning
[24:36] yeah what will thou communister what is
[24:40] thy request it shall be given thee to
[24:43] half the kingdom
[24:46] now watch Esther doesn't go straight to
[24:48] the heart of the problem
[24:53] a first request is this
[24:56] and Esther answered if it seemed good
[24:58] unto the king let the king and amen come
[25:02] this day unto the banquet I have
[25:05] prepared for him that's only the
[25:07] question
[25:13] know how to approach the king
[25:19] some of us as soon as we go Lord you
[25:21] know this day was so terrible and hard
[25:23] Lord oh I don't
[25:26] you bombarding heaven
[25:28] but into his gates with Thanksgiving
[25:30] amen tell me to his courts With Praise
[25:33] Jesus taught us how to praise His Our
[25:36] Father who child in heaven Hallowed be
[25:39] thy name amen
[25:40] thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[25:44] Earth as it is in heaven
[25:47] you're inviting the presence of Heaven
[25:48] down
[25:50] then it says give
[25:53] not the first opening prayer
[25:58] okay
[25:59] so he said no notice the answers
[26:02] first thing is come
[26:04] to a banquet
[26:07] now I just want to detail this if we go
[26:09] to Esther 1 1
[26:12] he told her what is my request
[26:15] what is your petition even to ask the
[26:18] kingdom I want you to know what this
[26:19] entails
[26:21] it came to pass in the days of a service
[26:24] he reigned from India
[26:27] to Ethiopia
[26:29] and he had 170
[26:32] what's up
[26:35] 127 provinces
[26:39] under his domain and Rule
[26:42] amen
[26:46] and he was willing to give us 63.5
[26:50] percent
[26:51] not percent
[26:53] 63.5 provinces he was willing to give
[26:59] Esther
[27:01] he was ruling your great great great
[27:03] great great great great great
[27:04] grandfather
[27:07] he was the king over India
[27:10] all the way through to Ethiopia
[27:16] and he told Esther I'll give you even to
[27:19] a half
[27:20] of his kingdoms
[27:25] I'm telling you that for a reason
[27:29] amen
[27:30] he wants to share his glory with no man
[27:35] but the one through whom he will reveal
[27:37] himself through
[27:39] okay so after Kingdom I just needed to
[27:41] detail that but here's the answer now
[27:45] the world today wants to empower women
[27:47] the false way
[27:51] they want to make women
[27:54] a sex goddess
[27:57] they want to empower her
[28:00] by telling her she has the right to
[28:02] abort a seed that's within her
[28:05] it's your body your right
[28:09] but Christ is the one that truly
[28:11] empowers the woman
[28:15] amen
[28:17] I I also want to say that I want to
[28:19] empower you this morning
[28:21] and I want to empower the woman here
[28:23] this morning because as God is my
[28:26] witness some of us have never said an
[28:28] amen in the church
[28:31] you ask yourself you're sitting next to
[28:33] your neighbor now for the last
[28:35] we started at 10. one hour
[28:38] did you hear an amen coming out
[28:41] please check if they're breathing
[28:44] look to the left look to the right just
[28:47] check are you okay
[28:51] okay
[28:54] no more reaction Christian there's you
[28:57] know you always want to teach your
[28:58] children how to behave and how to speak
[29:00] in public normal Christian reaction is
[29:02] Amen to the word
[29:05] praise the Lord hallelujah
[29:07] amen so I want to empower you this
[29:10] morning so she is able to come into the
[29:12] presence of the king and the first sign
[29:14] of deceptor being raised and the King
[29:16] asking us something
[29:19] she says I want you to come to my
[29:20] banquet and bring amen with you
[29:24] she's able to step into that position of
[29:26] authority
[29:28] because who can summon the King
[29:34] who has the power to summon the King
[29:39] but you
[29:42] let's go to Matthew 18 18. amen Matthew
[29:46] 18 18 speaks about the King of Kings and
[29:49] the Lord of lords
[29:53] and how he empowers him his Queen
[29:57] he says very very same to you whatsoever
[30:00] you bind on Earth shall be bound in
[30:02] heaven
[30:03] amen amen yes amen yes
[30:06] your words are not light your words
[30:09] carry power two dimensions
[30:12] that you are thinking this demon is
[30:14] operating on the Earth but when you bind
[30:17] that Spirit on the earth it is bound in
[30:19] heaven
[30:21] amen
[30:23] amen and whatsoever you loose on the
[30:27] Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I
[30:30] shout you he's coming to you the second
[30:32] time to tell you and Empower you that if
[30:34] two of you shall agree on Earth as
[30:37] touching anything that they ask amen it
[30:40] shall be done for them of My Father
[30:42] which is in heaven
[30:45] and here it is you have the power to
[30:48] summon the presence of the king he says
[30:50] for where two or three are gathered
[30:53] together in my name there I am in the
[30:56] midst of them
[30:57] Hallelujah Esther can call on the king
[31:01] to come into this place
[31:03] welcome welcome
[31:08] amen welcome Holy Spirit
[31:13] we are in your presence yes amen what is
[31:18] the famous Jeremiah scripture that's
[31:20] easy for everyone to remember that
[31:23] triple three is not the triple six now
[31:24] the Triple Three Jeremiah 33 verse 3.
[31:29] call unto me and I will answer thee
[31:33] amen and show the Great and Mighty
[31:36] things which thou knows not amen so the
[31:40] Lord will come to you if you call on his
[31:43] name
[31:45] he just promised her to ask the kingdom
[31:49] but she's only making one request come
[31:51] to my banquet
[31:53] seems like an easy request for the king
[31:55] to respond to
[31:58] Acts 2 21 you know Acts chapter 2 is
[32:01] this powerful
[32:03] chapter
[32:04] because this is the birth of the church
[32:07] where we're talking about empowerment
[32:10] that's why I'm bringing this in this is
[32:12] what the scripture where empowered
[32:14] church but the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:17] where they are now in that upper room
[32:19] and they are the rushing Mighty Wind
[32:21] comes into the upper room and it filled
[32:24] them one and all
[32:25] and they are now stumbling around amen
[32:28] oh and they come into the streets they
[32:30] can hardly contain themselves and Peter
[32:33] stands up yes this is now Acts 2 and 21
[32:36] and he tells them he shall come to pass
[32:38] that whosoever shall call on the name of
[32:41] the Lord shall be saved amen amen you
[32:47] got to be able to call on the name of
[32:48] the Lord in every situation amen
[32:52] amen
[32:55] yes they're five and five now we need to
[32:57] go back there
[32:59] then the king said now what did Jesus
[33:01] tell us anything you asked in my name I
[33:04] will ask the father
[33:06] I will bring you to pass I will make it
[33:08] happen
[33:11] yes to five and five as soon as Esther
[33:13] makes this request the king gives it out
[33:15] as a decree
[33:16] cause Eamon to make haste
[33:19] that he made two at yesterday had said
[33:23] yeah immediately
[33:26] or we could go to Daniel right now
[33:30] because Daniel when he understood the
[33:32] time when the season had come
[33:34] he began to pray
[33:36] and when the angel finally got to him
[33:38] what did he tell him
[33:40] he said as soon as I heard that prayer
[33:43] I just batched Heaven's Angels
[33:46] oh somebody get it this morning as soon
[33:50] as I heard thy prayer an angel was
[33:52] dispatched but he said I was met with
[33:54] resistance amen
[33:58] he says for 21 days
[34:02] but heaven will respond to your call
[34:04] immediately
[34:05] I tell you this morning if you've never
[34:08] called on the name of the Lord call on
[34:10] the name of the Lord
[34:12] and he shall meet you at the point of
[34:14] your name
[34:16] amen
[34:18] Hallelujah he says immediately get Eamon
[34:21] to come to the streets amen and do an
[34:24] essay that's it
[34:27] oh look at the screen now or words now
[34:29] carry power it's moving the king it's
[34:32] moving this demon power amen that's
[34:34] working in amen so the king and amen
[34:37] came to the banquet that Esther had
[34:40] prepared
[34:42] now they come to this place that's
[34:44] called the banquet of wine
[34:47] in verse 6 now and the King said unto
[34:50] Esther at the banquet of wine
[34:56] Hallelujah
[34:57] amen so if you already got it
[35:00] Esther can only be in a banquet of wine
[35:03] amen hallelujah we love to be
[35:06] spiritually drunk yes
[35:09] amen we like to be Intoxicated by his
[35:13] holy spirit amen
[35:15] the intoxication of the holy spirit
[35:18] gives us a stimulation of Revelation
[35:21] amen amen
[35:25] Hallelujah
[35:26] and the King said to Esther at the
[35:29] banquet of wine
[35:31] what is that the second time now what is
[35:34] that petition
[35:35] and it shall be granted thee what is thy
[35:38] request even to ask the kingdom it shall
[35:41] be performed
[35:43] he knew she never got to the heart of
[35:45] the matter
[35:47] under the line anointing
[35:49] what is she doing now she's under the ox
[35:51] anointing she's laboring
[35:54] yes
[35:58] amen now the backwood of wine
[36:01] we can take this now with that
[36:03] third right of that house right and that
[36:05] third anointing hurt not the oil and the
[36:08] wine
[36:11] what is the banquet of wine wine touched
[36:14] the stimulation of Revelation
[36:16] we know oil is the type of the Holy
[36:18] Spirit but wine is a stimulation of
[36:21] Revelation
[36:22] amen
[36:24] watch what she's going to do
[36:27] she's going to uncover his right
[36:31] she's going to uncover the scheme of
[36:33] Amen
[36:34] under what was the right horse riders
[36:38] scheme and plan exposed
[36:42] but if not under amen the opening of the
[36:45] word
[36:46] the opening of that seventh seal amen
[36:49] amen
[36:50] that gave the bride a stimulation of
[36:52] Revelation that sets her apart from
[36:55] every denomination yes
[36:58] hallelujah amen amen the Revelation that
[37:02] exposes Satan's Riot and scheme and his
[37:05] deception our seven sealed only declare
[37:08] this morning he is our banquet of wine
[37:10] oh thank you Lord
[37:13] now what was the banquet of wine
[37:15] the banquet of wine was
[37:19] a banquet that was carried out after the
[37:21] main meal
[37:22] because at the main meal meat and all
[37:25] our other Delicacies were being served
[37:27] but they never served wine in this
[37:29] portion of the Persian Kingdom they
[37:31] served the water
[37:33] because they didn't want to get drunk
[37:34] too early on
[37:38] amen
[37:41] the wine had to be stored up for a
[37:43] specific time
[37:45] amen the full revelation
[37:48] here
[37:50] I hope you're getting it the seals were
[37:53] not revealed in the days of poor
[37:56] amen
[37:59] Paul said we see through a glass Darkly
[38:03] Hallelujah
[38:05] but he said as light is needed it will
[38:07] be given
[38:09] I'm talking about the prophet now that's
[38:10] what he said so the banquet of why was
[38:13] the continuation of the banquet that was
[38:16] first set out
[38:18] now they're called
[38:21] to this banquet of lions where now it's
[38:24] like think of it as dessert
[38:26] you're getting your wine and you're
[38:28] getting your fruits
[38:29] and you're getting all of these other
[38:30] luxuries now it's after the meal
[38:34] she's calling them to the banquet of
[38:36] wine
[38:38] so here he comes under the banquet of
[38:40] wine amen which we said now she's
[38:42] laboring here and as the wine is being
[38:45] poured out and they are having a
[38:47] Pentecostal feast
[38:49] she exposes amen
[38:53] the writer is being exposed under this
[38:56] anointing he asked Esther the same
[38:58] question
[39:01] well let's go to verse 7 now and see
[39:03] Esther's response then Esther answered
[39:05] and said
[39:06] so he asked her what is your petition
[39:08] what is your request
[39:10] she says my petition and my request is
[39:14] if I found favor in the sight of the
[39:16] king
[39:17] and if it please the king watch now
[39:19] she's walking
[39:21] I told you she's laboring so it's it's
[39:24] still a banquet of wine She carries it
[39:27] out to the next day because there's
[39:29] another anointing coming
[39:31] amen
[39:38] he can't she gets the king and amen to
[39:41] come to the banquet of wine but listen
[39:43] to her request if you please the king to
[39:45] Grant my petition and to perform my
[39:47] request let the king and Eamon come to
[39:49] the banquet that I shall prepare for
[39:51] them I will do tomorrow as the king said
[39:55] because there is another right going
[39:57] forth
[39:59] amen there's another anointing going
[40:01] forward
[40:02] need
[40:03] she's still operating under the ox
[40:06] anointing
[40:07] the church as a whole I'm talking about
[40:12] so she's inviting him to come back
[40:14] now this King if this was your wife
[40:18] and you asking her what do you want
[40:22] first she tells you come to the banquet
[40:25] well first she doesn't tell you
[40:26] immediately
[40:27] like you know any of a few of you asked
[40:30] your wife what do you want to eat
[40:36] then you never get a straight answer
[40:37] right
[40:40] so the trick thing is to say if I were
[40:43] to take you out where would you like to
[40:45] go
[40:48] and then you take the way she told you
[40:51] right
[40:53] so watch there's a further work to go
[40:55] see it doesn't tell immediately in the
[40:58] throne room
[40:59] in the throne room she doesn't reveal
[41:01] what she wants
[41:02] she says come to my feast
[41:05] banquet of wines under the banquet of
[41:07] wines she doesn't tell him what she
[41:10] wants
[41:12] okay
[41:16] you see even then they couldn't
[41:18] understand women
[41:19] [Music]
[41:22] so she sells it come back tomorrow
[41:26] now many of us would have said but I'm
[41:28] here now
[41:31] tell me now
[41:35] but there's things to be uncovered
[41:39] in the next chapter because this is
[41:40] chapter five
[41:42] they next come together in chapter seven
[41:46] so there's certain things that happen
[41:48] right
[41:49] [Music]
[41:52] so she says if I find favor in the sight
[41:54] of the king and if you please the king
[41:56] to Grant my petition and to perform my
[41:59] request let the king and amen come to
[42:01] the banquet that I shall prepare for
[42:03] them and I will do tomorrow as the king
[42:06] had said
[42:07] so she wants to get them to that stage
[42:09] of smart cunning shrewd
[42:12] where she can expose
[42:15] right
[42:18] so if we if we had to look just as a
[42:20] glance fee we're not really preaching on
[42:22] this but maybe it'll
[42:25] spark some interest in you to read this
[42:27] in the Book of Esther between chapter 5
[42:31] and verse 6.
[42:32] there's something that happens
[42:34] sorry between chapter five and verse 7
[42:39] what happens let's put it up
[42:41] you can see here what happens
[42:44] the son of man is being revealed in time
[42:48] a son of man is revealing this son of
[42:50] man
[42:51] what is a son of man the glory of the
[42:54] Lord fully revealed through a prophet
[42:57] or somebody help me here what is a son
[43:00] of man God in a prophet
[43:03] come on we call ourselves son of man
[43:04] revealed Ministries we should be able to
[43:07] know what that means
[43:08] amen he said I am a son of man revealing
[43:11] these son of man amen
[43:14] amen again I'm going to make a statement
[43:17] you would never have heard this anywhere
[43:19] else if the spirit of the Lord does not
[43:20] pick it up
[43:22] amen because here on the inside of man
[43:27] Mordecai
[43:32] is being honored
[43:35] so amen remember amen so the king if you
[43:38] read it now I wonder what she said ice
[43:40] cream
[43:42] I wonder what I did he's probably
[43:43] wondering what he did
[43:48] because every time I ask her something
[43:50] she didn't want to talk to me she said
[43:51] come tomorrow come tomorrow
[43:56] he can't sleep so he asked for the book
[43:58] of records and here he finds that there
[44:01] were two two chamberlains that wanted to
[44:03] kill the king but
[44:05] under the ministry of Mordechai he
[44:08] exposed their workings he exposed those
[44:10] two spirits
[44:12] amen he exposed Oral Roberts and Billy
[44:14] Graham amen and he asked what honor has
[44:18] been given for Mordecai
[44:20] now watch out our footly frame the
[44:23] singing is there because Mordecai had
[44:26] operated in two pools of his ministry
[44:28] and under the he needs to come into his
[44:30] third poor ministry right if you
[44:33] understand where I'm going with brother
[44:34] Brandon's Ministry
[44:36] so now as he's doing this
[44:38] somebody comes into the court
[44:40] of the king amen now we know Eamonn is
[44:43] the bad guy
[44:46] he comes into the outer Court he can't
[44:49] come into the inner Court the Bible says
[44:51] he's in the ultimate Court of the King's
[44:52] house this is verse 4 now to speak unto
[44:55] the king and what he wants to do he
[44:57] wants to kill the influence of William

[45:06] meet him
[45:08] yes and what is he telling the king I
[45:11] want you to hang Mordecai in The Gallows
[45:14] that he had prepared for him
[45:16] England already prepared The Gallows
[45:21] amen
[45:23] you see the king won't honor
[45:25] everyone's request
[45:28] he never asked amen
[45:31] okay
[45:35] what did he ask him he said who is in
[45:38] the court amen comes there and asks
[45:40] without permission
[45:46] he says he wants to speak to the king to
[45:48] hang Mordecai and the King said unto him
[45:50] and be all aim and stand it in the court
[45:52] and he said let him come right the king
[45:54] asked him this he said what shall be
[45:56] done unto the man whom the king
[45:57] delighted to honor now Eamon thought in
[46:00] his heart to whom the king Delight to
[46:02] honor more than myself
[46:05] and Eamon said to the King For Whom the
[46:07] king delighted to honor let their way of

[46:32] which other Ministry you know operated

[46:41] than that this morning amen amen
[46:44] and the horse which the king righted
[46:46] upon and the Crown Royal which he set
[46:49] upon his head oh Hallelujah
[46:52] he wants the king's clothing the king's
[46:55] heart and the king's crown to be placed
[46:57] on the head if that's not son of man
[46:59] Ministry I don't know what it is
[47:08] and let this apparel and horse be
[47:09] delivered to the hand of the one the

[47:15] king delighted to honor and bring him on
[47:18] Horseback to meet the street to meet
[47:20] through the street of the city and
[47:22] Proclaim before him thus shall it be
[47:24] done to the man whom the king delighted
[47:26] to honor wasn't he taken seven times
[47:28] around the world Amen that the glory of
[47:31] the Lord could be seen in this ministry
[47:33] that he confounded Kings potentates and
[47:36] wise men and church leaders and and
[47:38] Buddhists and and all of these uh G what
[47:41] these people jeans and sheets and
[47:44] everyone
[47:45] amen that even God was it God Lindsay
[47:48] that said when I met this man I met
[47:50] Jesus
[47:51] that even to today
[47:53] when some people cannot separate a son
[47:56] of man from the son of man that they
[47:58] worship Branham Christ
[48:01] if that is not the type here then what
[48:03] is
[48:05] [Music]
[48:07] what is he saying
[48:10] dress him in your garment put your crown
[48:12] on him let him ride on your horse and
[48:14] parade him through the streets
[48:16] I mean
[48:19] then
[48:20] the king says to him and make haste take
[48:23] their Peril the horse as thou has said
[48:25] and do to Mordechai the Jew
[48:29] and as you are standing there on
[48:31] Mountain wandering Lord what is this
[48:32] thing
[48:35] amen a king's sword fell into his hand
[48:40] and he looked at him he said it's
[48:41] shining glistening in the Sun
[48:44] and he said I've always been fearful of
[48:45] these swords and knives but here it was
[48:48] and he said the end will fit me
[48:50] perfectly
[48:52] aren't you glad the word is a perfect
[48:54] fit for us he says it fit me perfectly
[48:57] the king's sword fell into my hand
[49:02] and he said not a king sword
[49:05] The Voice told him it's the king's sword
[49:11] and Mordecai
[49:13] amen so now amen you can hardly believe
[49:16] himself can you believe it this man
[49:19] thought he was going to be getting all
[49:20] of these things
[49:22] and now they lay it upon Mordecai
[49:25] and Mordecai came again to the king's
[49:28] gate but Haman ran to his house
[49:34] morning
[49:37] didn't they go with Hill between the
[49:38] legs or does the brain and finish them
[49:40] that they
[49:42] and he said
[49:44] good morning friends
[49:46] understand do you have certain issues
[49:48] against my teaching on what a baptism
[49:50] God had
[49:53] serpent seed if any of you
[49:56] can show me in the Bible where I'm wrong
[49:59] bring your Bible and come stand next to
[50:01] you
[50:02] he says you could have heard a pin drop
[50:06] amen he says if you can't come stand he
[50:10] says then get off my back
[50:13] amen
[50:15] amen so amen running back to his house
[50:18] where he's going by his wife
[50:21] running with his head covered even now
[50:23] he believes in head covering
[50:27] 2016 and Eamon told zerish's wife and
[50:30] all his friends everything that had
[50:32] befallen him
[50:33] then now if you read these people this
[50:35] way is counselors
[50:37] right they told him if you read the
[50:40] previous chapter to get that Gallow and
[50:42] hang Mordecai he followed the
[50:44] instruction now he runs back to his
[50:46] advisors
[50:47] and the told his wise men and and zerish
[50:51] if Mordecai be the seed of the Jews
[50:53] before whom that was begun to fall thou
[50:56] shall not Prevail against him
[50:58] hmm
[51:00] but thou shall surely fall before him
[51:02] and while they were yet before he can
[51:04] even go into hiding while they were
[51:06] talking to him and telling him
[51:09] be careful you're going to be next
[51:12] the king's chamberlains come
[51:15] judgment is here
[51:17] and he's to bring amen unto the banquet
[51:19] that he has to have prepared oh you know
[51:22] he's in trouble now
[51:26] you know he's in trouble now
[51:28] bring him to Esther's feast
[51:31] that's where we get to chapter seven now
[51:34] second day of the feast
[51:36] so the king and Eamon came to the
[51:38] banquet with s to the queen and the King
[51:41] said again to Esther on the second day
[51:43] of the banquet of wine Revelation is
[51:46] still falling out now it's falling fresh
[51:48] because Luther just received the just
[51:51] shall live by faith and he began to
[51:53] protest the Catholic system
[51:55] and he nailed his 95.
[51:58] what they call it
[52:00] this is on the door of the Catholic
[52:02] Church
[52:03] and he's exposing them for who they are
[52:06] and yeah Wesley is riding with
[52:09] sanctification
[52:11] amen under the second day the banquet of
[52:13] wine and he says what is thy petition
[52:15] between Esther and it shall be granted
[52:17] to thee what is thy request and the
[52:20] third time he says and it shall be
[52:22] formed be performed even to half the
[52:25] kingdom
[52:28] then Queen then there is to the queen
[52:31] answered and said if I have found favor
[52:33] in thy side O King and if he please the
[52:35] king let my life be given at my petition
[52:38] here she is now willing to lay her life
[52:40] down
[52:41] so remember she says you ask me petition
[52:45] and
[52:48] request so for my petition you can lay
[52:51] my I Lay My Life down
[52:54] and my people at my request
[52:58] for we are sold
[53:02] I am my people to be destroyed and to be
[53:04] slain
[53:07] is she approaching the Legacy in church
[53:09] age
[53:10] where she recognizes the condition of
[53:11] her people
[53:13] sold out
[53:18] they're about to be perished
[53:23] about to be destroyed to be slain and to
[53:25] perish for we have been sown for bornmen
[53:29] and born women
[53:31] didn't they sell them out
[53:33] at the Pentecostal feast
[53:37] they saw the church
[53:44] I held I had held my tongue although the
[53:47] enemy could not come to build the king's
[53:49] damage
[53:51] so yes she is that
[53:53] present stage of our ministry now
[53:56] and she's now
[53:59] telling the condition
[54:01] of the people
[54:03] and the king is answered and said unto
[54:06] yes to the queen who is he
[54:09] and where is he
[54:11] that does presume in his heart
[54:13] to do so
[54:18] here she exposes him now and Esther said
[54:21] remember he's sitting right there
[54:23] thank you
[54:25] you have a set in a place where someone
[54:27] wreted you out
[54:28] and you're looking at that person and
[54:30] you think yeah how you could do this to
[54:31] me
[54:36] instances the adversary and enemy is
[54:39] wicked amen
[54:42] then Eamon was afraid before king and
[54:44] the Queen
[54:48] Watch What Happens now the king leaves
[54:51] the banquet of wine
[54:55] and the King arising from the bank with
[54:57] the wine in his rep went into the palace
[54:59] Garden
[55:03] and Eamon stood now he's just aiming
[55:07] and Esther
[55:11] you got it the final showdown will be
[55:15] Eve again with Satan where she's got to
[55:18] confront him alone
[55:20] and stand the ground but this guy he
[55:23] gets caught in a bad situation here
[55:24] let's read
[55:27] King leaves the place and he leaves
[55:29] Esther alone with this guy
[55:31] because remember it was Eve alone with
[55:34] the serpent
[55:36] Amos stood up to make requests for
[55:39] the life for his life to Queen yes to
[55:42] the queen for he saw that there was evil
[55:44] determined against him by the king he
[55:46] knew the King was going to kill him now
[55:47] then the king returned out of the palace
[55:50] Garden into the place
[55:52] into the place of the banquet of wine
[55:54] and amen see where he went now in
[55:56] talking to the queen he ended up on a
[55:58] bid
[55:59] yeah
[56:01] he must have been pleading but it's a
[56:03] better position to be found when the
[56:06] husband walks in
[56:14] Mr was
[56:16] then the king said will he Force the
[56:18] queen also before me in the house
[56:22] as the word of the Kings as the word
[56:25] went out of the king's mouth they
[56:27] covered eamon's face the king I only
[56:29] began to speak then and they covered his
[56:31] face
[56:33] and have not one of the Chamberlain said
[56:35] before the king behold also The Gallows
[56:37] 50 cubits High which Eamonn had made for
[56:40] Mordecai which had
[56:42] who had spoken good for the king
[56:43] standing in the house of Hamlin then the
[56:45] king said hang him thereon
[56:50] so they hang Damon on The Gallows and
[56:53] there that he had prepared for mordecaya
[56:55] then was the king's wrath pacified
[57:00] if you would have noticed that we had
[57:02] transitioned just with a few lines in
[57:04] the story it had moved from Esther
[57:06] revealing the condition of the church to
[57:08] a time of Investigation judgment
[57:11] thank you
[57:12] judgment upon amen
[57:15] when is Judgment under Revelations him
[57:21] so you see how quickly we moved in that
[57:23] story amen
[57:25] amen judgment was said
[57:29] and Haman is killed
[57:35] now you'll find in chapter eight
[57:43] on that day King asuras gave gave the
[57:45] house of Amen the Jews enemy unto Queen
[57:49] and to Esther the queen
[57:53] and Mordecai came before the king for
[57:55] Esther told what
[57:58] he was to her the king took off his ring
[58:00] which was from amen and gave it to
[58:02] Mordecai and Esther said Mordecai over
[58:04] the house of Amon so you'll see he gets
[58:06] all
[58:07] Abel's blessings right
[58:13] we find here now next you see Esther
[58:15] going into an intercessory role again he
[58:17] has to speak yet again before the king
[58:19] fell down on his feet he sought him with
[58:21] tears to put away the Mischief of Amen
[58:24] okay this is the point I needed to get
[58:25] to even though Eamon was dead
[58:28] the law and the decree and aim and
[58:30] certain motion was already going to come
[58:33] to pass
[58:35] so she has to make further petition to
[58:38] stop
[58:39] the laws that had been written
[58:44] Wednesday we explain to you that while
[58:47] Daniel had freedom of religion they set
[58:50] laws into motion too
[58:52] lined up his worship and stop him from
[58:55] praying
[58:58] so he says then the king held out the
[59:00] golden scepter unto Esther and Esther
[59:02] Rose and stood before the king and said
[59:04] if he please the king if I found favor
[59:07] in his sight and the things him right
[59:09] before the king if I be pleasing in his
[59:11] eyes Let It Be written to reverse the
[59:13] letters devised by aiming the son of
[59:16] emadata the agatite which he wrote to
[59:19] destroy the Jews which are in all the
[59:21] king's provinces for all Can I Endure to
[59:24] see the evil that shall come upon unto
[59:26] my people or How Can I Endure to see the
[59:29] destruction of my kindred then the king
[59:32] Acer is sent out to Esther the queen and
[59:34] to Mordecai the Jew behold I have given
[59:36] Esther the house of amen and him that
[59:38] hangeth upon the Gallows because he laid
[59:41] his hand upon the Jews ready also for
[59:44] the Jews as if like a Jew and he says
[59:48] use my name
[59:49] ask anything in my name
[59:53] he says speak in the king's name seal it
[59:56] with the king's ring for the right thing
[59:59] which is written in the king's name and
[1:00:01] is sealed with the king's Ring May no
[1:00:03] man reverse he puts the power back to
[1:00:06] the church
[1:00:07] who is Mordecai and is to the church
[1:00:11] and he says take my ring
[1:00:13] he carries the cichlid
[1:00:15] write what you will ask anything stamp
[1:00:18] it with the seal of approval
[1:00:21] then the king's cribs were called the
[1:00:24] third man now they call the scribes and
[1:00:26] they make them sit before Mordecai and
[1:00:28] Esther and they write all the laws that
[1:00:30] they want I'm not going to go into that
[1:00:31] you can read it amen
[1:00:33] what I want to get to is the next one
[1:00:36] because remember we said he asked her
[1:00:38] four times
[1:00:40] he asked her three times already
[1:00:42] but he asked so one more time
[1:00:46] there was so much more we were going to
[1:00:47] get to amen but our time is already gone
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:51] we find here under the in the ninth
[1:00:53] chapter now
[1:00:57] that the Jews go about
[1:01:00] destroying
[1:01:01] all of them that are brought her to kill
[1:01:03] them
[1:01:04] so it was the 12th month you see there
[1:01:06] the 13th day the king's commandment
[1:01:10] there is decree Drew near to be put into
[1:01:12] execution in the days the enemies of the
[1:01:15] Jews hope to have power over them that
[1:01:17] it was turned to the contrary that the
[1:01:20] Jews had ruled over them that hated them
[1:01:23] so the Jews gathered themselves from all
[1:01:25] the cities and all the provinces
[1:01:29] amen and they killed him and all the
[1:01:31] rulers of the provinces lieutenants
[1:01:33] deputies officers of the Kings amen and
[1:01:36] the fear of Mordecai fell upon them
[1:01:38] so verse 5 does the Jews moved all the
[1:01:41] enemies for The Stroke Of The Sword and
[1:01:43] the slaughter and destruction and did
[1:01:45] what they would unto those who hated
[1:01:48] them
[1:01:49] and in verse 6 you see they destroyed
[1:01:51] 500 men
[1:01:53] right they killed 500 men
[1:01:57] and they killed amen's ten Sons
[1:02:03] so in verse 12 the king says to Esther
[1:02:06] the Jews have slain and destroyed 500
[1:02:08] men intrusion in the palace and the ten
[1:02:10] fans of Amen
[1:02:12] which have sought would what have they
[1:02:15] done in the rest of the king's provinces
[1:02:17] now what is that petition he granted me
[1:02:21] what is that request further and it
[1:02:23] shall be done notice it doesn't say to
[1:02:27] ask my kingdom
[1:02:28] because after the time of Investigation
[1:02:31] judgment she's already overcome
[1:02:34] and she is already
[1:02:36] she's already
[1:02:38] ruling
[1:02:39] do you get the point
[1:02:42] pay attention
[1:02:44] the fourth time he doesn't ask her even
[1:02:46] to ask the kingdom
[1:02:48] Because by the ninth chapter
[1:02:50] she recognized a position in the Kingdom
[1:02:52] she's already ruling to ask the kingdom
[1:02:55] she had already written laws
[1:02:59] and stamped it in his name amen
[1:03:02] amen she has already been exercising her
[1:03:05] rights for 2 000 years
[1:03:08] as Queen of Queens
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:14] so he doesn't need to tell her
[1:03:17] even to ask the kingdom he positioned
[1:03:20] and empowered her to such a point that
[1:03:22] she is operating at that level
[1:03:28] amen give God praise amen hallelujah
[1:03:32] foreign
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:03:55] she's flying above the things of the
[1:03:58] world she is fighting and overcoming
[1:04:00] amen amen amen
[1:04:03] she's living under that eagle anointing
[1:04:08] um now watch judgment is coming now from
[1:04:11] Esther
[1:04:13] this is the first time
[1:04:16] remember she exposed his works
[1:04:20] eamon's words right
[1:04:22] and judgment came from the King Hanging
[1:04:24] On The Gallows
[1:04:27] second time now the fourth time now he's
[1:04:30] asking she finally steps into that
[1:04:32] Authority
[1:04:33] because if she's not ruling and reigning
[1:04:35] like we just said in the mustn't she
[1:04:38] execute judgment as well who shall judge
[1:04:41] the Earth
[1:04:45] follow now we're not out of scripture
[1:04:46] here we're writing language scripture
[1:04:48] amen so it says here then as in verse 13
[1:04:52] now
[1:04:54] verse 13 He just struck me now
[1:04:56] revelation 13.
[1:04:58] bringing judgment
[1:05:00] upon that b system
[1:05:02] if it please the king let it be granted
[1:05:04] to the Jews
[1:05:07] which I ensure to do tomorrow according
[1:05:10] unto this day's decree and let amen's
[1:05:14] ten Sons
[1:05:15] behind upon the Gallows
[1:05:20] this
[1:05:24] is such a harsh punishment
[1:05:28] for the Jews that we ensure and gather
[1:05:29] themselves together on the 14th day also
[1:05:32] of the month Adan slew 300 men at
[1:05:35] shushan but on the prey they did not lay
[1:05:37] their hand
[1:05:40] but the other Jews that were in the
[1:05:41] king's provinces gathered themselves
[1:05:43] together and stood for their lives and
[1:05:46] at rest from the enemy that slew of
[1:05:48] their full 70 and 5 000.
[1:05:51] so it wasn't only 500. you see the
[1:05:53] further work of this church they are now
[1:05:55] slaying 75 000.
[1:05:58] there's not only 500 demons
[1:06:01] there's 200 million demons let loose you

[1:06:27] kings he's speaking to his Queen give me
[1:06:29] five minutes and we'll move amen let's
[1:06:32] go to John 15 and verse 5. amen and see
[1:06:35] if these are not the words that now the
[1:06:37] true king of King is now speaking to his
[1:06:39] true Queen
[1:06:40] John 15 and verse 5 he's saying I am
[1:06:42] Divine you are the branches he that
[1:06:44] abided in me I in him the same bringeth
[1:06:47] forth much fruit for without me you can
[1:06:50] do nothing
[1:06:51] very quickly in order for you to get
[1:06:53] fruit the life that is in that vine must
[1:06:55] flow through your branches okay he said
[1:06:59] if a man abide not in me is cast forth
[1:07:01] as a branch and he's with it and Men
[1:07:03] gather them and cast them into the fire
[1:07:05] here's the verse I want to get to the
[1:07:07] seventh verse of the chapter if you
[1:07:10] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:07:12] you shall ask what you will
[1:07:15] and it shall be done unto you
[1:07:18] same thing as restored Queen Esther but
[1:07:21] this is the true king of kings
[1:07:23] telling his Queen if you asked anything
[1:07:28] it shall be done unto you John 14 12.
[1:07:32] amen let's go quickly now verily verily
[1:07:35] I say unto you he that believeth on me
[1:07:37] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:07:40] and Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:07:43] because I go to my father
[1:07:46] and in verse 13 He says whatsoever
[1:07:49] you're asking my name
[1:07:52] remember what we were telling you the
[1:07:53] king told us to take my ring
[1:07:56] speak in my name
[1:08:00] amen whatsoever you asked in my name
[1:08:03] that will I do that the father may be
[1:08:06] glorified in the son
[1:08:07] if you ask anything in my name I will do
[1:08:10] it
[1:08:12] I hope and now you are you are ignited
[1:08:15] in your heart your passion in your heart
[1:08:16] to ask something before you leave this
[1:08:18] place
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:22] amen John 15 and verse 16.
[1:08:27] before I get to the scripture was Esther
[1:08:29] chosen
[1:08:31] did she chose the king or the queen king
[1:08:33] chose her
[1:08:35] the king chose her let's read them with
[1:08:38] understanding you have not chosen me
[1:08:41] I have chosen you
[1:08:43] and ordained you did he finally position
[1:08:45] her to have the kingdom that you should
[1:08:48] bring go and bring forth fruit and that
[1:08:51] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[1:08:53] you shall ask Dr father in my name
[1:08:57] he may give it you
[1:09:01] John 16 and verse 22 I know you're
[1:09:03] writing it down you'll read it at home
[1:09:04] amen and and just
[1:09:07] maybe you can print it out because these
[1:09:09] things are faith building scriptures
[1:09:13] 1622 he says
[1:09:15] you now therefore have sorrow but I will
[1:09:18] see you again oh I want to see him amen
[1:09:22] he said he will see us again
[1:09:26] and your heart shall rejoice and your
[1:09:29] joy no man take it from you and in that
[1:09:32] day you shall ask me nothing verily
[1:09:34] verily I say unto you whatsoever you ask
[1:09:37] the father in my name he will give it to
[1:09:40] you
[1:09:41] is it true you of us nothing in my name
[1:09:44] ask and you shall receive that your joy
[1:09:46] may be full
[1:09:48] in Psalm 37 and verse 4 it tells you to
[1:09:52] delight yourself in the Lord
[1:09:54] and he shall give you the desires of
[1:09:56] thine heart
[1:10:01] amen also note that being a son
[1:10:05] doesn't automatically make you inherit
[1:10:08] all things
[1:10:10] because you can be a son but you still
[1:10:12] have the same rights as a servant I'm in
[1:10:15] Galatians chapter 4 verse right now
[1:10:17] Galatians 4. but what is needed is for
[1:10:21] you to be under tutors and governors
[1:10:24] Amen to be under the five-fold ministry
[1:10:27] until because they are given for the
[1:10:29] perfecting of the Saints amen right
[1:10:32] until we come into the unity of the
[1:10:33] faith
[1:10:34] he says because what will this teach us
[1:10:37] why must you go on the tutors and
[1:10:39] darkness now
[1:10:40] imagine you're born in the king's
[1:10:42] household
[1:10:43] and you can't remember nothing you have
[1:10:46] no power to speak nothing he puts you
[1:10:48] under tutors and governors
[1:10:50] he wants you to have humility
[1:10:52] he wants you to have respect he wants
[1:10:55] you to honor those that are in authority
[1:10:58] amen
[1:11:01] in order to be adopted of the Father the
[1:11:03] tutors and governors what must they do
[1:11:05] give back a report to the father
[1:11:10] a good report if you're training in
[1:11:11] maturity and when the report is accepted
[1:11:14] the father adopts you and you become an
[1:11:17] heir of all the father has
[1:11:19] all right you'll read that in Galatians
[1:11:21] chapter 4 from verse 1 to 7. so he's
[1:11:24] telling you a child defers nothing from
[1:11:26] his servants going out to tutors
[1:11:27] governors
[1:11:29] maybe I'll read one verse
[1:11:34] it says let's read verse 6 because you
[1:11:37] are Sons God had sent forth the spirit
[1:11:39] of his son into your hearts crying Abba
[1:11:41] Father wherefore Thou Art no more his
[1:11:43] servant but his son and if his son then
[1:11:46] an ear of God through Christ right amen
[1:11:50] let's go we've got how many more
[1:11:52] scriptures just a few more 1 John 3 21
[1:11:57] this is now the Apostle of love
[1:12:00] John
[1:12:02] it says beloved if our heart condemn us
[1:12:05] not
[1:12:06] then have we confidence towards God
[1:12:10] verse 2 and whatsoever we ask we receive
[1:12:14] of him because we keep his Commandments
[1:12:17] and do these those things that are
[1:12:19] pleasing in his sight
[1:12:20] one John 5 verse 14.
[1:12:24] he says this is the confidence we have
[1:12:27] in him that if we ask anything according
[1:12:29] to his will he Hearth us
[1:12:33] and if we know that he can that he hear
[1:12:36] us whatsoever we ask we know that we
[1:12:39] have the petitions that we have decided
[1:12:41] that we have desired of him
[1:12:45] Matthew 17 20.
[1:12:48] I'm just laying in these Faith
[1:12:49] scriptures amen

[1:12:56] say to this mountain remove hands beyond
[1:12:59] the place and it shall remove and

[1:13:10] and doubt not

[1:13:14] to the fig tree
[1:13:15] but also if you shall say to this
[1:13:17] mountain be thou removed and be cast
[1:13:19] into the sea it shall be done
[1:13:24] maybe you're asking how can I get this
[1:13:26] power how can I get this access you've
[1:13:28] got to go to acts 1 and 8 where he says
[1:13:31] you shall receive power
[1:13:33] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:13:35] and you shall be witnessed unto me both
[1:13:38] in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria
[1:13:41] even to the uttermost parts of the Earth
[1:13:44] and when he had spoken these things
[1:13:46] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[1:13:49] cloud received him out of their sight
[1:13:53] and Luke 24 49

[1:13:58] upon you
