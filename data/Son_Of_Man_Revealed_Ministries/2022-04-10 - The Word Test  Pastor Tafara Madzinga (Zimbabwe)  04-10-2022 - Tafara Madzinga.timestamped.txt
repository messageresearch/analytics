[27:01] to be
[27:02] in his kingdom yes amen and that we are
[27:08] candidates of
[27:11] problem of God as he plays out this
[27:13] program yes drama
[27:16] amen
[27:18] um I'd like to
[27:20] speak on a little subjects that I've
[27:23] given the title
[27:24] the word test amen amen amen glory the
[27:29] word amen amen praise
[27:33] before I go any further I'd like to kind
[27:38] of uh go backwards uh of scriptures on
[27:43] this chapter
[27:44] chapter 24 I'd like to
[27:48] take you backwards a little bit I'm
[27:50] gonna just be referring to this chapter
[27:53] from its beginning
[27:55] and I would like to take your attention
[27:58] to verse 4
[28:00] where Abraham is giving instructions to
[28:05] his servant Eleazar
[28:07] amen this is a familiar story to us as
[28:11] Believers and yes Bible students amen
[28:14] and uh these are some of the Bible
[28:16] stories that must kind of reminders and
[28:19] kind of wake us up in this hour as we
[28:24] see the types and shadows of what what
[28:27] is he expecting us to be in as a
[28:30] condition and uh as the bride of Christ
[28:34] now Abraham is uh sending his uh uh
[28:39] servant who is a laser to get a wife for
[28:43] his child or his boy Isaac yes
[28:47] but my interest on best for is the fact
[28:50] that
[28:51] Abraham is actually giving
[28:55] Specific Instructions foreign
[28:58] to make sure that there is no room for
[29:01] human Airlines
[29:03] to the program of his kingdom so the
[29:07] most important thing that is
[29:10] to say
[29:12] you must get a wife or my son from my
[29:17] Kindle yes
[29:19] this is something that Abraham was very
[29:22] particular about yes amen he wanted to
[29:25] make sure that elieza would understand
[29:28] that kind of woman that was supposed to
[29:31] be the wife for his son amen because
[29:37] remember there is a bloodline to be
[29:40] protected amen
[29:43] remember that um whatever comes out of
[29:46] that Union is going to have something to
[29:49] do in the future amen and about his
[29:53] kingdom and if you have something to do
[29:55] with what God had promised him of what
[29:58] was going to happen to his seed yes amen
[30:01] so he tells us this seven that um you
[30:05] must not take a woman from any other
[30:08] places yes besides my own country
[30:12] then he says uh you must take from my
[30:16] own Kindred yes I mean let me read that
[30:19] verse
[30:21] before I proceed
[30:22] amen he says uh on verse 4
[30:27] but Thou shalt go unto my country
[30:30] and to my kindred
[30:32] and take a wife unto my son Isaac
[30:37] now the the way the kindred
[30:40] means family
[30:43] or relative amen so Abraham
[30:48] wounded
[30:50] uh Eliza to get a wife from his own
[30:55] family
[30:56] okay from his own relatives yes right so
[31:02] we find out that uh because of that
[31:05] Rebecca was actually a relative devising
[31:09] yes amen Rebecca belonged to the same
[31:14] family
[31:15] with Isaac yes Isaac
[31:24] had the ones being together
[31:27] yes somehow amenities
[31:36] it means some sometimes they were found
[31:40] together in the genes of somebody amen
[31:45] amen because what happened to the family
[31:48] then you begin to have family tree but
[31:51] one time there is a gene that is in
[31:54] somebody so the great one of the great
[31:57] great grandfathers of Isaac
[32:13] you know what happened in the family
[32:15] what I'm talking about amen you you you
[32:18] have your son inside of you yes and that
[32:22] sun is good Sons yes inside of him and
[32:26] they will have they also you have your
[32:29] grand grand children within you yes amen
[32:32] so at one time
[32:33] Rebecca and Isaac were together
[32:36] in somebody yes in one of the their
[32:40] great great grandfather they were
[32:42] together but because of the family
[32:44] progression and the family tree growing
[32:47] they ended up you know going different
[32:49] directions amen and then Abraham of
[32:52] course were now far away from his
[32:54] country of origin and so forth but
[32:56] Abraham understood all this Dynamics
[32:59] amen and he says
[33:03] uh you go and you get your wife but make
[33:06] sure you get off my own kindred
[33:09] I was supposed to go and get a woman for
[33:12] Isaac from the very family of Abraham
[33:17] amen so uh there comes now the issue
[33:23] later this kind of relationship between
[33:26] Isaac and um and the baker obvious it
[33:30] had something to do with how things were
[33:32] going to happen yes in this commission
[33:35] for foreign
[33:37] that's why now you you see when elieza
[33:40] asked before water from Rebecca
[33:44] the most important part or portion of
[33:47] the of the of the reaction or the
[33:51] actions of Rebecca was not the watering
[33:56] of areas no
[33:59] but the watering of the camels amen was
[34:03] the important part of the manifestation
[34:07] of Rebecca amen amen and yes there was
[34:11] not much concerned about how many liters
[34:14] he was going to get no
[34:17] but the the watering of the camels
[34:21] was what was very important in the
[34:23] mystery of the calling out of this Brian
[34:26] I mean now it's important for us to
[34:30] remember that uh Rebecca's actions
[34:35] we're actually going to determine
[34:38] whether eleazar's Ministry had been
[34:41] successful or not amen
[34:46] actually asked God for a fleece yes okay
[34:50] because he wanted to be very sure and
[34:53] brahmanam says if you are sincere about
[34:55] it God will reveal it amen so aliens are
[34:59] knowing how God works and how important
[35:01] it was to get the right person for Isaac
[35:04] here to pray first
[35:07] so he said the The damself Who after I
[35:12] say give me water
[35:15] the one
[35:17] that is going to give me water and then
[35:20] you water the colors then I know that's
[35:23] the one what's the language yes he says
[35:26] the one that you have what
[35:31] you have prepared
[35:33] he has commanded amen you have prepared
[35:37] already that's the evidence
[35:40] that she is the one yes so the mystery
[35:44] of who the bride or the wife of Isaac
[35:47] was was actually sued yes within that
[35:53] that portion of that person amen yes so
[35:56] when when Rebecca came to the world
[35:59] and uh elieza
[36:02] said to Rebecca give me water
[36:07] [Music]
[36:09] was in two portions amen the open part
[36:13] of that
[36:14] which was the the part which said give
[36:17] me water yes and it does sealed the bat
[36:21] which was the water he was that come
[36:24] here yes
[36:27] so the mystery of the manifestation of
[36:31] the bride was actually in the sealed
[36:34] part of that foreign
[36:57] it was not open
[37:00] in other words it was that's going to be
[37:04] a security part of that portion of the
[37:07] world to protect that information from
[37:11] the wrong thing yes from the wrong
[37:13] candidates
[37:14] so that it's a it's a it's a pin code to
[37:19] stop those who are not ordained
[37:22] you stay away amen amen to make sure
[37:26] that you know Jesus Christ saying them
[37:28] to Peter Upon This Rock will I build my
[37:33] church and God is very good at that at
[37:36] managing his information Amen to make
[37:39] sure that is not accessible everybody
[37:45] and the Rebecca was not there but soon
[37:48] after that Rebecca shows up
[37:51] amen so now Rebecca comes in Arabica I
[37:56] mean speaks their weight the spoken word
[37:59] and says give me water and he stops
[38:03] now
[38:04] why did the Rebecca water the condos
[38:10] now the other thing which is important
[38:13] in this that the camels did not belong
[38:16] to aliens yes
[38:19] the Canyons actually belonged to Abraham
[38:24] Allah
[38:29] brought earlier that the messenger to
[38:32] Rebecca then the camels were actually
[38:35] the the force or the the the the the
[38:39] power going to take Rebecca back to
[38:42] Abraham to Isaac
[38:44] amen so there was some some connections
[38:48] some relationship there was a deep that
[38:51] was in in Rebecca that was responding
[38:55] Amen to that to the still the part of
[38:58] his commission
[39:00] Hallelujah there was there was a mystery
[39:03] something was happening which was not he
[39:06] was only revealed to Rebecca amen
[39:10] environment so Rebecca's actions proved
[39:15] actually
[39:16] that she was the bride amen
[39:19] amen so it was actually a mystery which
[39:22] was not revealed to everyone else
[39:25] only Rebecca had the revelation
[39:29] of what Elias are one day done by that
[39:33] spoken word which is saying give me
[39:36] water yeah amen amen and it was revealed
[39:39] to her by the Holy Ghost amen amen
[39:43] hallelujah now Rebecca was being tested
[39:46] by the word amen amen amen now in this
[39:51] hour now where the bride is supposed to
[39:53] be taken up
[39:55] God is testing the bride by the way
[40:00] he is waiting and testing to see who's
[40:04] going to respond who is going to do what
[40:08] okay God help us
[40:13] now she was tested by the word to see
[40:17] how she was going to react yes what she
[40:20] was going to do about the word that is
[40:22] okay the spoken word amen but it was in
[40:26] two parts that sealed in the open part
[40:29] of it I mean but now remember that
[40:32] Prophet also says
[40:34] the word
[40:36] is in the bride amen and the mind of
[40:40] Christ to know what God wants done with
[40:44] that way amen because in this hour is
[40:47] not everybody that is going to know what
[40:50] to do with us okay
[40:55] has been given but not everyone is going
[40:59] to know what to do with us
[41:04] yes and the Mystery of the bride of
[41:07] Christ that portion of the way which is
[41:10] that child is filled yes it's not all of
[41:13] them that are going to be listening to
[41:15] the text who are going to know what to
[41:17] do with that but the bride of Christ
[41:20] because she cannot be deceived yes the
[41:24] word the prophets is actually in the
[41:26] bride in the mind of Christ to know what
[41:30] good was done with that spoken and that
[41:32] was what was happening with the Rebecca
[41:34] the word was in heaven yes so the other
[41:37] portion of the word which was actually
[41:40] sealed it was inside of her and it was
[41:43] revealed here by the Holy Ghost not you
[41:46] are told the Holy Ghost told her that
[41:48] when you hear aliens are saying give me
[41:51] water he actually says give me water in
[41:54] the camera
[41:57] then she did exactly that thank you and
[42:00] she met the expectation of the hour
[42:05] and that was what Elias that was looking
[42:08] for
[42:08] that was what it is I was expecting he
[42:12] was watching out for not who was going
[42:14] to give him 20 liters of water or
[42:17] whatever but the person who was going to
[42:19] respond to the covenants someone who's
[42:22] going to know
[42:23] one to the need that
[42:25] in the camera
[42:27] was what was going to prove who was the
[42:30] bride yes amen hallelujah now remember
[42:34] brother Branham tells us about her the
[42:38] story
[42:40] the story of the eagle amen
[42:46] now there's something that I'm
[42:47] interested in that story which makes me
[42:49] uh feel very good about it
[42:53] now the prophet tells us
[42:57] that um
[42:59] the ego laid in hell
[43:02] amen amen and when she laid an egg
[43:07] somehow
[43:09] this egg ended up
[43:11] in the band yeah amen by the farmer's
[43:15] place
[43:16] amen
[43:18] but it was not the choice of the egg
[43:22] amen amen to be found
[43:26] amongst the eggs of the chicken
[43:29] amen it found itself in there
[43:33] amen amen now the eagle
[43:37] noise oh yes
[43:40] When She lays the egg
[43:43] she knows
[43:44] God is not an oath of confusion
[43:48] he will never lose any one of his own
[43:52] he does not forget amen no matter how
[43:56] far you can go
[43:59] [Applause]
[44:01] someone somehow someday somehow
[44:08] all the way up
[44:10] because he knows his own
[44:13] he knows your name he knows where you
[44:17] stay he knows where you're coming from
[44:20] he knows where you're supposed to be he
[44:22] knows your position in Christ he knows
[44:25] when to bring you back he knows
[44:28] he knows how to work with you
[44:32] [Applause]
[44:33] are you going to get lost amen thank you
[44:36] now when time came because the ego knows
[44:39] by now
[44:57] the evil didn't
[44:59] do for the egg when it was not yet but
[45:02] there is a process
[45:06] started looking for something it was now
[45:10] out of the shape then you must begin to
[45:12] describe
[45:16] now the eaglet is the capacity to hear
[45:20] yes that's all the mother wanted
[45:23] she was hearing a lot of things but now
[45:25] the mother comes and now the eaglet is
[45:28] amongst the the chickens in the Banyan
[45:31] okay and she had been mistaken and been
[45:35] taken into things and but some of
[45:38] urbanization that the English knew that
[45:40] there must be something wrong about
[45:41] where I am yes
[45:44] there must be something I may not be
[45:46] explained but I'm not satisfied
[45:49] I mean that is why even in this hour no
[45:53] make how much come for that the people
[45:55] may be somebody somewhere going to
[45:58] hunger
[46:01] with
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:14] somebody
[46:14] [Applause]
[46:16] yes
[46:19] Hallelujah and good knows that oh thank
[46:23] you and when she came
[46:25] the prophet says she let out the scream
[46:29] spreading it amen
[46:33] he was demonstrating
[46:36] what he is
[46:39] she was showing the eaglet down there
[46:42] yes what is possible amen amen amen
[46:48] have been taught by mother chicken that
[46:51] there's no flying that happens yes
[46:56] yes
[46:58] here we just believe it as it is we
[47:02] don't do more we we don't fly higher yes
[47:04] anything that flies above be careful
[47:09] amen amen when he was taught never to
[47:13] look up yes
[47:14] yeah just look down here yes you must be
[47:17] satisfied with what we are doing but
[47:19] when there's something when this is
[47:24] [Applause]
[47:39] amen that's why he promised
[47:55] [Applause]
[47:59] [Music]
[48:00] [Applause]
[48:09] what was happening
[48:11] she though she had that for the first
[48:14] time yeah that's that's the mystery it
[48:18] was for the first time
[48:21] yes that screen yes yes but it was
[48:25] nothing and sit inside
[48:28] [Applause]
[48:33] how come she hears this kind of scream
[48:36] for the first time and she she likes it
[48:39] why
[48:58] amen amen he says every sound is a
[49:02] meaning yes and now because this eaglet
[49:05] also has the same sound in her but she
[49:09] had never practiced
[49:13] because mother chicken could not cry
[49:17] like that yeah so how could she teach
[49:20] her yeah
[49:23] she was not an ego but not because she
[49:28] was born in the ego yeah amen yes almost
[49:32] the characteristics
[49:35] were in that English
[49:38] but he didn't know yes because the
[49:43] environment he was brought up with was
[49:46] not conducive for the manifestation of
[49:48] the power of God
[49:50] [Applause]
[49:54] but God did not stop
[49:57] what he took for the mother ego to come
[50:00] around yes and make a second sound yeah
[50:03] and that sound was actually inside
[50:08] that's what I wanted
[50:10] [Applause]
[50:11] it
[50:14] [Applause]
[50:19] was the chickens the chickens were
[50:22] trying to discourage it yeah
[50:25] where do you want to go
[50:28] you have been here all this yeah yeah
[50:33] oh Hallelujah
[50:36] [Music]
[50:38] take a look you are now getting into
[50:40] foreign
[50:55] [Applause]
[51:19] something inside of me tells me man
[51:21] there's something more to this there's
[51:24] something more about worshiping God
[51:26] there's something more about coming to
[51:29] church there is something more that is
[51:40] [Applause]
[51:44] she was giving away the taste amen the
[51:48] ego gave the eaglet the word you say now
[51:52] this is what we do this is what we
[51:54] believe in what do you say about it yeah
[51:56] you can say Amen
[51:58] yes
[52:00] thank you and when she said
[52:03] she began to flip it yes she began to
[52:07] recognize yes she began to recognize his
[52:10] name yes
[52:17] now when the Bible says
[52:19] recognizing your day yes yes and its
[52:23] message
[52:25] it's not a day that you are talking
[52:27] about on the current yes yes amen no
[52:30] yeah
[52:32] it's the day of the Lord amen
[52:35] but now remember that that day that you
[52:41] are talking about
[52:42] the Bible is saying your day
[52:47] so it's not a day of a calendar but it's
[52:51] the season of your manifestation amen
[52:54] amen
[52:56] so you recognize the English recognized
[52:59] the season to fly yes it recognize that
[53:03] day which it was supposed to be
[53:05] manifested Amen Let me live in this
[53:08] profession
[53:09] amen
[53:11] your reaction to God
[53:14] cherries whether you were there or not
[53:17] amen yes absolutely the prophet says
[53:21] something here
[53:22] in the spoken word
[53:24] uh that was spoken word is the Original
[53:26] Seed
[53:27] paragraph 330. when I'm saying something
[53:31] he says give it the word taste
[53:35] that's the way to tell whether it's
[53:38] right or wrong
[53:40] just give it in the world just see what
[53:44] it says about the world any spirit
[53:47] see what it says
[53:50] if it denies the wind amen is not of God
[53:55] no matter what it is if it denies the
[54:00] word this note of God look give it the
[54:04] way the taste it and see what happens
[54:08] amen now when the prophet talks about
[54:10] denying the way
[54:12] it's not about saying no the spoken word
[54:14] is wrong yes or the Bible is wrong no
[54:18] but this is actually religious people
[54:21] that's right so-called Believers yeah
[54:24] just like the Pharisees and the
[54:26] suggestions
[54:27] they denied the wind amen Jesus
[54:33] but the the word in black and white
[54:37] they called themselves the Believers of
[54:40] the message Freedom they were reading it
[54:43] they were listening to the depths of
[54:44] Moses
[54:45] but when the word which they were
[54:48] reading yes became flesh that we need to
[54:53] confuse the names
[54:59] yes people praise God for what is done
[55:02] amen yes in the past amen and then clap
[55:07] your hands of what is coming yes but
[55:09] when we come to what he's doing now
[55:19] [Music]
[55:22] yes yeah
[55:24] anyone can claim to believe yes because
[55:27] he's not there yeah yeah but when he was
[55:30] walking down there there were people who
[55:32] were more religious than you before he
[55:35] didn't understand you see when they were
[55:37] reading the scripture yes imagine shall
[55:39] conceive and they go and preach it
[55:41] Hallelujah
[55:43] why is the Virgin had to conceived amen
[55:47] amen amen
[55:50] yes they continue teaching their people
[55:53] and preaching to the people that change
[55:55] that the Messiah is coming when the
[55:58] Messiah was preaching next door
[56:02] what was happening yes
[56:06] when they look at Jesus they said yeah
[56:11] amen
[56:13] and then it takes Amendment all right
[56:19] to recognize who Jesus was no because
[56:24] the the prophet says a true demon
[56:28] recognizes the presence of God
[56:33] because the Bible says Ephesians 6 12 we
[56:36] restored against flesh
[56:38] so spiritual things are spiritually
[56:40] designed amen because he was the word
[56:44] made the flesh
[56:46] and the prophet says we bypass our
[56:49] children
[56:50] and he came into this body all the time
[56:52] but in Jesus when he came from God he
[56:55] went straight to his family before he
[56:58] came into faith
[56:59] so when he was the sum total of God
[57:01] there was both that she off and healed
[57:04] the flesh amen amen and when demons
[57:06] looked at him they were not looking at
[57:09] the flesh with the Pharisees were
[57:10] looking at them that demons were saying
[57:14] that Jesus
[57:17] yeah
[57:20] it was the word which had come to the
[57:22] flesh yes and the Pharisees were looking
[57:25] at the flesh but he failing to see the
[57:27] word amen
[57:29] amen
[57:30] thank you the prophecies
[57:34] uh in the message
[57:38] the invisible Union of the blood of
[57:41] Christ
[57:43] now here the prophet says if it denies
[57:45] the way
[57:46] it's not the word so you see the
[57:49] Pharisees when they denied the word they
[57:53] were not denying the word in black and
[57:56] white
[57:57] yes but no it's because like I'm saying
[58:00] when the world becomes the flesh when
[58:02] it's present that way to confuse his
[58:04] people because people confuse when they
[58:07] hear about the word of God they don't
[58:10] know what the word of God is and they
[58:11] think the word of God is the Bible yeah
[58:15] but now that the Bible starts with the
[58:18] beginning when the creation was do it
[58:20] was happening amen that's where it
[58:23] starts in the beginning
[58:25] it was without form
[58:28] that's what the word refers to to the
[58:31] people yeah
[58:33] then comes he says
[58:36] we don't start here yes he says you and
[58:39] me come come
[58:42] let us go to the banister of time
[58:46] and watch things is being happy yes and
[58:50] many inflation yes taking the church the
[58:53] believer the bright sake forget about
[58:55] goodness is one before we
[58:58] amen
[59:01] [Applause]
[59:08] yes and he talks about the ethic coming
[59:11] out as a child and then it runs away and
[59:14] then he stops stops it brings back and
[59:15] then he says it begins to melt that the
[59:18] Isis and everything else and then he
[59:20] says when the water melted then we had
[59:22] Genesis one Hallelujah
[59:27] and John 1 says in the beginning was the
[59:32] weight yeah the word was with God Amen
[59:35] and the wind was good amen
[59:40] which was in the beginning before it was
[59:43] written because this was written by
[59:45] Moses
[59:48] so he's talking about the word which it
[59:51] was in the beginning which was with God
[59:53] before it was in black and white amen
[59:55] because the black and white is a portion
[59:57] of the sun total of the word of God Amen
[1:00:00] this is not happening that is written
[1:00:02] here even the Bible in the New Testament
[1:00:04] says the works of Jesus is not all that
[1:00:06] was amen somewhere left out it has to be
[1:00:09] a book
[1:00:10] but the other portion amen is lift up
[1:00:15] because that is the portion that is
[1:00:17] reserved for the bride for the direct
[1:00:19] it's actually the blind
[1:00:24] let me read this
[1:00:26] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:00:30] paragraph 241.
[1:00:32] will you help me
[1:00:35] he says
[1:00:37] tip number six five one one two five
[1:00:41] paragraph two four one this is it was
[1:00:44] put in there by predestination amen amen
[1:00:48] you we are full ordained
[1:00:51] to a son of God
[1:00:53] you were in God before the foundation of
[1:00:58] the world
[1:01:00] you are only
[1:01:02] manifested in this day for his honor
[1:01:06] Amen in glory yes
[1:01:10] how can you do it without honoring his
[1:01:13] word amen understand with every word of
[1:01:17] God Amen yes which you are a part of
[1:01:21] that word amen by predestination
[1:01:26] because look the God is the word amen
[1:01:31] you believe it well then he always was
[1:01:36] the winter in the beginning was the week
[1:01:39] and if the weight was good then you were
[1:01:44] in God
[1:01:48] the path that you are to play was in God
[1:01:52] before the foundation
[1:01:55] amen he's in you he knew you he
[1:02:00] previously
[1:02:04] for me to expand on this let me read
[1:02:07] that the last quotation so that we some
[1:02:10] in what we want to say here the message
[1:02:13] is identify the Christ of all ages watch
[1:02:16] that I do
[1:02:18] and what we are talking about
[1:02:21] the identify the Christ of all
[1:02:25] right amen
[1:02:29] all you need to do is to identify him
[1:02:31] but he is the same yesterday today
[1:02:37] so that Christ is actually the same when
[1:02:42] he was back there yes as he is now he is
[1:02:47] the same it is identified but who
[1:02:50] identifies it
[1:02:51] let me live in there paragraph 45 it is
[1:02:55] still the word yeah
[1:02:57] the word is God
[1:03:00] what God in every age has loted so much
[1:03:06] of his way and in there watch what he
[1:03:11] did he send a prophet yes and the word
[1:03:14] of the Lord he comes to the prophet amen
[1:03:17] the prophet refuse it to the audience
[1:03:20] and the audience believe it and then
[1:03:23] that is good in action
[1:03:26] God moving by his spirit
[1:03:31] now when the prophet is saying you were
[1:03:35] ordained
[1:03:36] by God okay but the the the forwarding
[1:03:42] that was happening
[1:03:44] God being the word
[1:03:46] in the beginning
[1:03:48] you were actually in God Amen when he
[1:03:53] was the wait in the beginning
[1:03:55] so when you were in God you were the
[1:03:59] wind amen okay amen but now that word
[1:04:03] which you were part of God you were part
[1:04:07] of God which is the part of the world
[1:04:10] then the Bible says the world became
[1:04:14] flesh
[1:04:15] how they didn't become fresh
[1:04:21] Prince yes what God did before he said
[1:04:26] let us make men in our image yes he says
[1:04:29] God rebelled himself amen
[1:04:37] which was the form of God Amen okay yes
[1:04:41] so the logos was the shape of God Amen
[1:04:44] the logos was actually the the that's
[1:04:47] your funny amen of God
[1:04:49] but not logos it was actually the word
[1:04:53] amen which was going towards becoming
[1:04:56] flesh yes in this year it was a form a
[1:04:59] shape but not in flesh yes it was a cure
[1:05:03] funny body amen that came out of God yes
[1:05:06] but it was not a lesser good yes it was
[1:05:10] actually God himself
[1:05:13] and where were you glorious yes because
[1:05:17] before he basically the logos yeah you
[1:05:21] were in him amen that's what we are
[1:05:23] talking about amen so you were within
[1:05:25] him when he was
[1:05:29] when he became the logos you were part
[1:05:33] of that lady
[1:05:36] but now Jesus from there
[1:05:40] ourselves then we bypassed yes
[1:05:44] but we have got a representation
[1:05:47] Hallelujah
[1:05:50] and that that is that the representation
[1:05:53] is what is actually the word amen the
[1:05:58] part that we were in good before the
[1:06:00] foundation of the amen and we bypass
[1:06:03] that amen but it's part of it's us we
[1:06:05] are part of the amen so when God now
[1:06:08] Prophet says he allotted a certain
[1:06:12] portion of those for each age amen amen
[1:06:15] he was abortioning himself yes yes the
[1:06:20] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:06:22] he was looking at himself as the word
[1:06:25] and then he divided himself into
[1:06:28] portions of that word amen and then he
[1:06:32] ordains that this one is going to be
[1:06:35] manifested in this age
[1:06:38] so the prophet also says the word
[1:06:42] intakes is actually the word
[1:06:45] yes in seed form amen so it says which
[1:06:50] is waiting for the flesh
[1:06:54] amen yes God said my word cannot come
[1:06:59] back to me amen
[1:07:03] so when that seed which was in God
[1:07:06] before
[1:07:08] when it's allotted in the limbs Book of
[1:07:11] Life As The Messengers are coming to
[1:07:14] retrieve part of that
[1:07:16] Lamb's Book of Life the list of the
[1:07:20] people in The Book of Life they are
[1:07:22] divided into sections amen this one will
[1:07:25] come in this age yes so the minister of
[1:07:27] that of that time catches the mystery
[1:07:30] yes
[1:07:32] when he catches the Misty he is catching
[1:07:35] the mystery of those names and he
[1:07:37] preaches it as the word when you hear
[1:07:40] that you are hearing yourself
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:46] that's why you respond because yeah
[1:07:51] you are a family together one time you
[1:07:55] were a Jew you were together
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:01] Glory thank you Lord you don't respond
[1:08:04] to a stranger yes but it's somebody that
[1:08:06] you have been with
[1:08:07] have been with them in school yes they
[1:08:10] believe them somewhere when you meet
[1:08:11] them in town no matter how many years
[1:08:13] they've been passing by
[1:08:16] amen wait a minute I know you
[1:08:20] hallelujah amen you are responding like
[1:08:24] the ego because that part of the world
[1:08:27] is actually inside of you amen we've got
[1:08:29] another bushing inside of you
[1:08:31] which is being declared yes thank you
[1:08:34] why would you believe that
[1:08:36] what is Faith amen yes
[1:08:43] it doesn't say things that don't exist
[1:08:46] yes
[1:08:47] notice him so you don't see them but
[1:08:50] those things do exist
[1:08:53] would not make sense yes yes if you
[1:08:57] believe in something that does not exist
[1:08:58] yes
[1:08:59] so you are believing in yourself
[1:09:03] you are believing in the word of God
[1:09:05] which you will practice
[1:09:07] so in that word of God was in God you
[1:09:11] were there with that word what makes you
[1:09:14] to believe it
[1:09:15] it's because you yourself you are
[1:09:19] actually part of that word that word is
[1:09:21] in where the form is actually a seed
[1:09:24] waiting for your day of this flesh to be
[1:09:27] born amen then that that weight
[1:09:30] comes and comes within the proximity of
[1:09:33] your life you feel it there's something
[1:09:36] about it Rebecca was feeling something I
[1:09:39] don't know what this man but there's
[1:09:41] something about this man there's
[1:09:43] something about these camels there is
[1:09:45] something about the spirit in this
[1:09:47] church Hallelujah I can hear the voice
[1:09:51] calling my name I can hear a power that
[1:09:54] is drawing me to something I may not be
[1:09:57] able to see it but the Angels they are
[1:09:59] here
[1:10:01] someone is responding to the spiritual
[1:10:03] world because you are there you were the
[1:10:07] spirit in the beginning amen
[1:10:12] that part of the world
[1:10:14] that's why
[1:10:16] you cannot stand still amen amen amen
[1:10:20] and now the bride is being tested
[1:10:24] to see who exactly is the bride
[1:10:30] is to manifest in all the prophecies
[1:10:38] [Applause]
[1:10:40] you know when you are reading those when
[1:10:42] you come across the cape when you come
[1:10:44] across a quotation or a spoken word when
[1:10:47] you are reading and listening to the
[1:10:49] cake
[1:10:50] you hear there's a voice that speaks to
[1:10:53] you thank you outside of the text yes
[1:10:58] there's a voice that speaks because it
[1:11:00] identifies you and you identify it the
[1:11:03] crying of the mother ego may be an
[1:11:06] uncertain sound to the chickens but you
[1:11:09] because
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:17] responds to the deep that is in God and
[1:11:21] what is happening there you are
[1:11:22] recognizing your day and this message
[1:11:24] and that message is actually yourself
[1:11:26] yes you are part of the world that's a
[1:11:29] man there and look at the beginning you
[1:11:31] were there but then you came this body
[1:11:34] of time came and it must actually
[1:11:36] recognize that portion of the word yes
[1:11:40] hallelujah amen and that makes the bride
[1:11:43] now to behave differently from the rest
[1:11:46] of the world Hallelujah
[1:11:50] came with a spoken word he was not
[1:11:53] looking for a church yes of a group of
[1:11:56] believers who were simply going to say
[1:11:57] oh and yes that we believe in you oh
[1:12:00] well yes
[1:12:01] we are not looking for the holidays I
[1:12:04] was watching to see the reaction yes of
[1:12:08] the woman to the camels yes
[1:12:12] God is waiting for someone for a check
[1:12:16] that is going to respond to the holy
[1:12:18] ghosts
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:25] and the Holy Ghost has come to do it
[1:12:27] again amen
[1:12:31] numbers
[1:12:35] you cannot go back where you've never
[1:12:38] been yes yes I mean so Rebecca
[1:12:43] he was actually being drawn by Isaac
[1:12:47] because she was part of Isaac they had
[1:12:53] been together in their great grandfather
[1:12:56] so as we were the god you and he was
[1:12:59] that way before all these papers and
[1:13:02] Pages were there we were in there
[1:13:07] foreign
[1:13:35] amen hallelujah
[1:13:39] so the bride of Christ in this hour is
[1:13:42] being tried amen by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:13:45] is being tested by the world Amen to see
[1:13:47] what you are going to do about this amen
[1:13:50] not looking for a church or a believer
[1:13:52] that is going to try to explain yes but
[1:13:54] a believer that is going to stand there
[1:13:56] when you recognize your day it's missing
[1:13:58] like Jesus himself when he came and took
[1:14:01] the Bible that the preachers and the
[1:14:04] pastors and Bishops they've been reading
[1:14:06] for decades he took me just stood there
[1:14:08] and say this day amen
[1:14:13] yeah
[1:14:16] thank you that's why he confused yeah
[1:14:18] because to them
[1:14:20] scriptures are not claimable
[1:14:22] it's a book
[1:14:25] but when Jesus came face to face with
[1:14:27] that scripture they knew each other they
[1:14:29] were together before
[1:14:33] to stop Yes where to start and where to
[1:14:36] stop and the bride of Christ in this
[1:14:39] hour they know how to manifest and to
[1:14:42] accept and to to manifest there's some
[1:14:45] culture of the way amen that remained of
[1:14:48] the word which was ordained in this hour
[1:14:50] the bride of Christ amen choose
[1:14:54] something within and when she comes to
[1:14:56] church he's not coming just for for some
[1:14:58] stories
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:02] Hallelujah
[1:15:18] [Applause]
[1:15:20] and when that word says you responding
[1:15:23] to itself
[1:15:25] what is happening says the Holy Spirit
[1:15:28] comes to water the wind
[1:15:30] right yes he comes to water what the way
[1:15:35] so when the word is in the bride when
[1:15:38] the Holy Ghost comes verbanon says that
[1:15:42] the mechanics in the Dynamics are there
[1:15:46] why should we be there because after all
[1:15:49] the same Jesus with the same as dead
[1:15:51] again foreign
[1:16:22] yes what
[1:16:24] is the same Jesus amen who is simply are
[1:16:27] questioning himself yes in different
[1:16:29] dispositions and the bride of Christ in
[1:16:32] this hour must actually be the same
[1:16:34] total hundred percent of God himself
[1:16:36] amen Christ flowing through the blood of
[1:16:39] Christ Christ becoming the bride himself
[1:16:42] amen until he is actually the bride is
[1:16:45] good together
[1:16:47] as Adam was with Eve what was happening
[1:16:50] they were together in the spirit they
[1:16:52] were together and they are so funny they
[1:16:54] were together as the word but the
[1:16:57] Natural Life separated them but when
[1:16:59] they saw one another something within
[1:17:01] they must responding someone knew that I
[1:17:05] know this person amen amen and you
[1:17:08] cannot sit still wow thank you when you
[1:17:11] are in belief of this message yes
[1:17:13] there's something that is tells you oh
[1:17:15] yes yes you will never ever be satisfied
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:22] why because of God foreign
[1:17:44] [Applause]

[1:18:33] promised he is not going to judge anyone
[1:18:36] before they hear the word and when you
[1:18:38] are the seed you are never ever going to
[1:18:40] get lost amen God is going to do it amen

[1:19:19] individual something Supernatural is
[1:19:21] going to happen

[1:19:27] who is not going to resistance
[1:19:32] he is going or she is going to identify
[1:19:36] themselves with the word amen like Jesus
[1:19:40] woman
