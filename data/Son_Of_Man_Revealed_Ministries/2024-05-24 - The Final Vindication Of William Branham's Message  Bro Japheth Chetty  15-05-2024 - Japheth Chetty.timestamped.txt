[9:23] part of him amen amen our Redemption
[9:26] takes us past Lu's justification
[9:29] yes Lu's justification says the just
[9:32] shall live by faith amen amen but
[9:35] justification through the seventh
[9:36] Angel's message says you are Justified

[14:32] ordained you to be here amen amen amen

[14:37] he specifically ordained you to be here
[14:40] amen so he has something in store for
[14:42] you Hallelujah it seems like amen the a
[14:46] portion of uh hell is running loose with
[14:49] the
[14:49] flu amen and affecting everyone with the
[14:52] flu but nonetheless his grace is
[14:54] sufficient for us hallelujah amen we
[14:57] pray we be blessed with the word
[14:59] tonight amen let's turn to the Book of
[15:03] Exodus
[15:06] 2:23 amen we don't have the projection
[15:09] or anything tonight so we'll just try
[15:10] and go slowly through the scriptures and
[15:13] the quotes So that you catch
[15:16] it amen Exodus
[15:20] 2:23 Bible says during that long period
[15:24] the king of Egypt died the Israelites
[15:27] groaned in their slavery and cried out
[15:30] and they cried for help because of their
[15:33] slavery went up to
[15:35] God God heard their groaning and he
[15:38] remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[15:41] with Isaac and with Jacob amen he's the
[15:43] god that remembers his
[15:45] promises amen verse 25 so God looked on
[15:49] the Israelites and was concerned about
[15:51] them amen so we read in verse 23 once
[15:55] again amen you the Israelites
[15:59] they groaned in their slavery and they
[16:01] cried out to God they cried for help
[16:05] because of their slavery went up to God
[16:08] so in 23 if we are to read it another
[16:10] way in 23 the children of God started to
[16:13] cry unto
[16:14] God Amen because of the slavery that
[16:17] latest year had put them in amen because
[16:20] of the slavery that through the years
[16:22] amen the enemy has tried to get a hold
[16:24] of God's people but God's people begin
[16:26] to cry they begin to consecrate them El
[16:29] they begin to Res surrender themselves
[16:31] amen amen and then in 24 God says I've
[16:35] heard they're groaning I have heard the
[16:37] people crying unto me amen now here is
[16:40] coming God's glory amen because he's he
[16:43] he has heard the Cry of his people and
[16:46] he says I have remembered my
[16:48] promises Amen in other words I
[16:51] remembered the promises I made to my
[16:52] servant ranom amen that this people will
[16:55] share in my glory that this church will
[16:58] be super race there'll be an invincible
[17:01] Army amen that this bride will not fall
[17:04] am amen God says I've remembered my
[17:07] promises and then look in verse 5 25 he
[17:10] says God looked on the Israelites and
[17:12] was concerned about them amen God is
[17:15] concerned about you amen God knows the
[17:17] struggles you go through amen may God
[17:20] add a blessing to the reading of his
[17:22] word you may be
[17:23] seated
[17:25] amen so for our topic tonight we just
[17:28] want to talk on about the final
[17:30] Vindication of William bram's message
[17:34] the final Vindication amen now I could
[17:37] have titled this the final Vindication
[17:40] of Malachi 4's message and that's what I
[17:42] had initially but then I said to myself
[17:45] why must we be ashamed of the
[17:47] name amen you know when we referring to
[17:49] John the Baptist we refer to John the
[17:52] Baptist we don't refer to Malachi 3 yes
[17:56] we're not ashamed of the name John the
[17:57] Baptist because he f full Malachi 3 so
[18:01] William brandom and for those listening
[18:03] on the online audience and who might not
[18:05] know who we're talking about William
[18:07] Brandon fulfilled the scripture of
[18:09] Malachi 4: 5 and 6 hallelujah amen so
[18:14] when we are talking about Malachi chter
[18:15] 4 we are referring to William brandom
[18:18] amen so we want to know tonight what is
[18:21] the final Vindication of William
[18:23] Brandon's
[18:25] message amen amen thank you Lord we see
[18:29] here here was the children of Israel in
[18:32] the book of Exodus and we know how they
[18:35] they got into this condition after years
[18:37] of Joseph passing away they Rose a
[18:40] pharaoh who knew not Joseph amen amen
[18:44] and the people of Israel started to work
[18:47] for the Egyptians as
[18:49] slaves and the Egyptians started to
[18:51] treat the children of God very badly
[18:55] they started to be heavy task Masters
[18:58] obviously it didn't just start like that
[19:00] it must have started with the Israelites
[19:02] just working normal jobs But as time
[19:05] went on the Egyptians saw the
[19:08] productivity of the children of God they
[19:11] saw how blessed they were amen they saw
[19:13] that everything they put their hand to
[19:15] they were blessed at and so they thought
[19:17] to theel how can we cultivate this now
[19:20] and so they put the children of God
[19:21] under
[19:25] slavery and so the children of God begin
[19:27] to cry out
[19:29] they begin to cry out to God Amen and
[19:32] now in this message I also want to show
[19:34] you in this message that when God
[19:36] delivered the children of Israel it was
[19:38] not just God who was in the form of the
[19:40] Angel right the pull of fire and it was
[19:43] not just Moses I'm going to show you
[19:45] that a there was a Aaron also in the
[19:48] picture amen when it came to the
[19:50] Deliverance of the children of God from
[19:52] Egypt in the first Exodus it was God
[19:56] with his Prophet with Aaron and a what
[19:59] does Aaron type Aaron was the priest the
[20:01] levitical order so Aaron typed the
[20:04] priesthood so Aaron typed the fivefold
[20:06] ministry one Aaron also typed the
[20:09] children of God because the priest
[20:11] stands on behalf of the children of God
[20:13] Amen right so we want to show you that
[20:15] Aaron types the priesthood he types the
[20:17] children of God he also types at one
[20:20] point in his ministry he types the
[20:22] Fallen church as well and we're going to
[20:23] show you that amen but my point is that
[20:26] when Deliverance came to the children of
[20:28] Israel it was not through Moses
[20:32] alone
[20:34] amen now here was the people of God and
[20:36] they cry begin to come out to God and
[20:38] God is hearing their cry now because
[20:41] remember we said we don't serve a god
[20:42] that is deaf amen we serve a God that
[20:45] hears we serve a God that knows all
[20:47] things amen and he made a promise amen
[20:50] that these people were going to soier in
[20:52] a Strange Land for 400 years amen and he
[20:56] seen that the time has now approached
[20:58] and the children of God begin to cry out
[21:00] you'll notice always when there's going
[21:02] to be a change of dispensation there's a
[21:04] cry out in the children of God why
[21:07] because there's an instinct within them
[21:09] telling them that there's a change of
[21:12] dispensation amen so they begin to cry
[21:14] out to God and God says I have heard
[21:17] they cry God says he's he cares for his
[21:20] people amen amen see God sees you in
[21:23] your situation yes whatever you're going
[21:25] through maybe you're going through
[21:27] hardships maybe even at work
[21:29] you going through hardships amen maybe
[21:31] you're coming under a heavy task master
[21:33] at work amen and you're crying out to
[21:36] God why can the situation change or why
[21:38] can't things be better but God hears
[21:40] your cry amen and God has Deliverance
[21:43] for you amen maybe you are enslaved by
[21:46] the things of the world and you
[21:48] struggling with sin maybe you're
[21:50] struggling with weakness you're
[21:51] struggling to
[21:52] overcome amen later has it hard on you
[21:56] amen Satan has got his 200 milon demons
[21:59] as task Masters over you amen and he's
[22:01] trying to bring you down every day

[22:09] of my people amen yes amen God cares for
[22:13] you amen amen amen oh no matter what it

[22:24] situation but God says I care for you
[22:27] thank you Lord amen I know that my grace
[22:30] is sufficient for you remember when Paul
[22:32] cried out to the Lord and he said my
[22:34] grace is sufficient for you amen God
[22:36] never let his prayers go unheard the
[22:39] same with William brandom he cried out
[22:40] to God to heal him for a certain
[22:42] sickness all those years and eventually
[22:45] God sent him the seven Dove amen because
[22:48] God cares for you amen hallelujah
[22:53] amen amen in Exodus chapter 3 and verse
[22:57] 7 the Lord said I have indeed seen the
[23:00] misery of my people in Egypt I have
[23:03] heard them crying out because of their
[23:05] slave drivers and I'm concerned about
[23:08] their suffering see once again God is is
[23:10] expressing his concern to
[23:12] Moses so I have I have come down he says
[23:16] I have come down to rescue them from the
[23:19] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[23:21] out of the land into a good and spacious
[23:23] land so once again even like when the
[23:26] when the Hebrew boys were in the father
[23:29] God himself came down amen because when
[23:31] the children of God are in trouble amen
[23:33] God doesn't send anyone else but himself
[23:35] he comes down himself amen because he is
[23:38] the Redeemer thank you amen he is the
[23:40] mighty Redeemer so when his children is
[23:42] in trouble God comes down himself amen
[23:46] amen and and look what he wants to do
[23:48] now he wants to rescue them from Egypt
[23:51] and he wants to bring them into a
[23:53] spacious land a land flowing with milk
[23:55] and honey oh amen the home of the
[23:57] Canaanites and so forth amen so God
[24:00] doesn't just want to rescue you from
[24:01] your situation God has a better plan for
[24:03] you amen amen he says I know the plans I
[24:06] have for you plans to prosper you amen
[24:09] that you be in good health amen that you
[24:11] prosper in the natural things that you
[24:13] prosper in spiritual things that your
[24:15] soul Prosper amen God cares for you that
[24:19] much that he doesn't just want to rescue
[24:20] you but he wants to provide for you he
[24:23] wants to be your provider he wants to be
[24:24] your healer your sustainer your
[24:26] comforter amen he to bring you out of
[24:29] one condition and take you into a better
[24:31] condition amen amen hallelujah that's
[24:35] the God we
[24:36] serve yes and now the Cry of the
[24:39] Israelites has reached me and I've seen
[24:41] the way the Egyptians are oppressing
[24:42] them amen 200 million demons oppressing
[24:46] the people verse 10 so now here's what
[24:50] God says now so now I am going to send
[24:52] you to pharaoh to bring my people the
[24:55] Israelites out of Egypt now first God
[24:57] said I coming down but now he says I am
[25:00] going to send you so how is Deliverance
[25:03] coming how is God going to bless you yes
[25:06] how is God going to rescue you amen how
[25:08] are you going to overcome the task
[25:10] masters of latera that wants you
[25:12] enslaved amen God is sending a message
[25:15] with his Prophet yes amen amen we sing
[25:18] the song our Moses has already gone to
[25:20] prepare the place amen he brought us
[25:22] through the Jordan and he was taken away
[25:24] amen hallelujah overcoming power is what
[25:28] we have have in this hour amen so all
[25:30] your blessings are tied to that to the
[25:33] message of the hour amen how is your
[25:35] deliverance coming via the message of
[25:37] the hour amen God is sending a
[25:40] Vindicated message he's sending a
[25:42] Vindicated Prophet yes and in that God
[25:45] is said I am coming down amen amen
[25:47] hallelujah huj and your deliverance can
[25:50] only come through that this is why in
[25:52] Malachi 4 he says behold I send you yes
[25:55] and notice before he says behold I send
[25:58] you Elijah he says remember Moses why
[26:01] because in like manner God went to
[26:03] deliver the children of Israel in the
[26:05] time of Moses just like how he sent
[26:07] Moses with a message a strong and of
[26:09] Deliverance amen a onean Invasion
[26:12] hallelujah amen in this age God sends a
[26:14] one man evasion amen he sends him seven
[26:17] times around the world Hallelujah and in
[26:20] this message he's coming Deliverance for
[26:22] God's people to deliver them from the
[26:25] task masters of
[26:26] L Hallelujah behold I send you and four
[26:30] speaks of Deliverance amen hallelujah
[26:35] amen so God is sending Deliverance via a
[26:39] message amen and when the people receive
[26:41] the message they are receiving their
[26:43] Deliverance when they received Moses
[26:45] they was receiving their deliverance and
[26:48] when they refused Moses amen judgment
[26:51] Came Upon
[26:52] them so let let's look at Aaron's
[26:55] involvement now we say that God speaks
[26:57] to Moses right God meets him in the
[26:59] pillow of fire and God is commissioning
[27:01] him and Moses begins to I want say argue
[27:06] but he begins to reason with God and he
[27:08] says God why if they don't listen to me
[27:10] my speech is you know not that good I'm
[27:12] I have stammering speech I'm not I'm not
[27:15] good with speech why do they don't
[27:16] listen to me so God now begins to get
[27:19] angry with
[27:20] Moses and eventually God tells Moses use
[27:24] your brother
[27:26] Aaron right and God
[27:28] says to Moses
[27:31] that you will be a god unto Aaron and
[27:34] Aaron will be your Prophet
[27:36] amen let's read that amen the Lord and
[27:39] the Lord's anger burned against Moses
[27:41] and he said what about your brother
[27:43] Aaron the Levites amen the priest now
[27:45] the ministry I know he can speak well
[27:49] amen this is what God is saying about
[27:51] the ministry now I know that he can
[27:53] speak well amen amen he is already on
[27:56] his way to meet you and you'll be glad
[27:57] to see you you shall speak to him now
[28:01] God is saying Moses you shall speak to
[28:02] him and put words in his
[28:05] mouth amen so the words in the ministry
[28:08] in the fivefold ministry those words
[28:10] have been put there by the prophet of
[28:13] the age why because he said say what the
[28:15] tape say amen he store the message up in
[28:18] books and tapes and he says stay with
[28:20] what the tape
[28:21] says amen and he says I will have both
[28:24] of you speak and will teach you what to
[28:26] do so God is not only going to help
[28:29] Moses God is going to help Aaron as well
[28:32] amen God is going to be with the
[28:33] fivefold ministry as well amen he will
[28:37] speak to the people for you you see the
[28:40] prophet is already left the scene he's
[28:41] no longer here amen and it will be as if
[28:46] he were your mouth and as if you were
[28:48] God to
[28:49] him and God says but take the staff in
[28:52] your hand so you can perform signs with
[28:54] it now look the Lord said to Aaron now
[28:58] now the Lord appears to Aaron and he
[29:00] says go into the Wilderness to meet
[29:02] Moses you see the fivefold ministry has
[29:05] also has to come to the backside of the
[29:07] desert amen they also have to have that
[29:10] experience where they come to the
[29:12] backside of the desert and he has to
[29:14] meet Moses at the Mountain of
[29:16] God amen amen you see the ministry also
[29:20] has to come to the Mountain of God where
[29:22] the angel met the prophet why because we
[29:25] also have to connect with the same angel
[29:28] amen
[29:30] amen oh yes Lord amen hallelujah you see
[29:33] the fivefold gets the instructions from
[29:36] Moses by the books and tapes amen it's
[29:39] recorded spiritual food stored up in due
[29:41] season because it says yeah and Moses
[29:43] told Aaron everything the Lord had sent
[29:46] him to say and also about all the signs
[29:49] he had commanded didn't he tell us about
[29:50] the two signs the first pool and the
[29:52] second pool and then he explain to us
[29:54] about the third
[29:56] pool amen
[29:58] [Music]
[30:02] and Moses and Aaron brought together all
[30:04] the Elders of the Israelites and now
[30:07] watch now Aaron told them everything the
[30:09] Lord had said to Moses so Moses is not
[30:12] telling them Aaron is speaking to the
[30:14] people of God and Aaron is bringing to
[30:16] them what God said to Moses amen amen
[30:19] because the prophet says young man will
[30:21] come and carry this message onto the
[30:23] coming of the Lord and they will make
[30:25] sensory to the people amen hallelujah
[30:28] amen that's right and then the people
[30:30] believed and when they heard that the
[30:32] Lord was concerned about them and had
[30:35] seen their Mery they bowed down and
[30:37] worshiped amen hallelujah yes amen now
[30:41] let's go on further to in the story to
[30:43] see now how Aaron now starts to take on
[30:46] his role in Exodus
[30:50] 11:10 Moses and the Bible says Moses and
[30:54] Aaron performed all these wonders before
[30:58] Pharaoh but wait now I thought that
[31:00] Moses performed all the signs and
[31:02] wonders but here the Bible saying Moses
[31:04] and Aaron performed all these signs and
[31:07] wonders before
[31:08] pharaoh and Pharaoh hardened his heart
[31:12] and he would not let the Israelites go
[31:13] out to the of the
[31:15] country Exodus 5 verse3 then they said
[31:20] the god of the Hebrews has met with us
[31:23] now let us take now this is Moses and
[31:26] Aaron speaking to pharaoh and they say
[31:28] to Pharaoh now let us take a three-day
[31:30] Journey Into the Wilderness to offer
[31:32] sacrifices to the Lord Our God or he may
[31:35] strike us with plagues or with The
[31:38] Sword and the king of Egypt said Moses
[31:40] and Aaron why are you taking the people
[31:43] away from their
[31:45] labor get back to your work then Pharaoh
[31:48] said look the people of the land are
[31:50] numerous and you are stopping them from
[31:52] working that same day Pharaoh gave this
[31:55] order to slave drivers and overseers in
[31:57] charge of the people to say you are no
[32:00] longer to supply the people with straw
[32:02] for making bricks let them go and gather
[32:05] their own straw Now watch how the enemy
[32:07] gets angry when God is coming down to
[32:08] bring Deliverance to his people amen
[32:11] Pharaoh begins to make life much harder
[32:13] now for the Israelites why because Moses
[32:16] and Aaron tells Pharaoh we want to go
[32:18] for a three-day Journey To Worship in
[32:20] the
[32:21] wilderness and Pharaoh begins to tell
[32:23] them let them make more bricks the same
[32:26] amount of bricks but with no straw don't
[32:28] provide the straw for
[32:33] them but require them to make the same
[32:35] number of bricks as before don't reduce
[32:38] the quota and he says they are lazy that
[32:42] is why they are crying out let us go and
[32:45] sacrifice to our god so look at pharoh
[32:47] now he saying this people don't want to
[32:49] do their work they want to that's why
[32:51] they want to go and worship their
[32:54] God and so he says make work harder for
[32:57] these people so that they keep working
[32:59] and paying no attention to liar so now
[33:02] look at this why is Pharaoh making their
[33:04] lives hard what's the number one reason
[33:07] he he doesn't want them to go and
[33:08] worship their
[33:10] God and this is the same Spirit now in
[33:13] later amen when we want to worship God
[33:16] we want to have time for God Amen we
[33:18] want to read our Bible we want to pray
[33:20] but the Same Spirit of pharaoh he saying
[33:22] no make them work harder make them focus
[33:25] on their careers make them focus on
[33:28] material things amen make them focus on
[33:31] obtaining more and attaining more amen
[33:34] look at our F saying they lazy and look
[33:36] at how the world wants to encourage you
[33:38] know don't be lazy work more work more
[33:40] hours work over time amen get more get
[33:43] more into
[33:45] debt hey man look what does straw do to
[33:48] a brick so in those days they made
[33:50] bricks via
[33:52] clay and Clay takes very long to dry so
[33:55] they put straw in the brick because the
[33:57] straw opens up the clay and allows you
[33:59] to dry faster so the brick is made
[34:01] quicker so by Pharaoh taking out the
[34:03] straw it took them longer to make these
[34:06] bricks you see so that's the in the same
[34:10] way that is how later works it says
[34:13] let's make things harder for them so
[34:14] they have to keep working let's increase
[34:17] the mortgage bonds let's let's increase
[34:19] the interest rates let's make the cost
[34:21] of living higher so they have to work
[34:23] over time they have to only focus on
[34:25] material things just to survive no amen
[34:28] you end up working for years and years
[34:30] and years just to pay off your house by
[34:33] the time you pay off your house you're
[34:34] already old man amen look at the Same
[34:37] Spirit now that was driving the children
[34:39] of
[34:42] Israel and why because he wanted to stop
[34:44] them from going on a three-day Journey
[34:46] you see the children of God wants to go
[34:48] on a three-day Journey from
[34:50] justification to sanctification to the
[34:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost but lateria
[34:55] wants to restrict you from doing that
[34:57] why because when you go from those three
[34:59] stages you begin to form into the word
[35:01] image amen you begin to become a new
[35:04] creation in Christ Jesus amen and you
[35:06] begin to put on the very image of Goden
[35:09] you become an adopted son of God Amen
[35:12] and Pharaoh can see if this people go
[35:14] and worship amen they are going to start
[35:16] to get an identity of who they are again
[35:19] amen we have now cultivated in their
[35:21] minds that they are
[35:22] slaves we have spent years and years and
[35:25] years to influence them and to make them
[35:27] believe believe that they are slaves yes
[35:29] amen but now if they go on this
[35:31] three-day Journey they are going to
[35:33] start to get an identification again
[35:36] amen they're going to start to realize
[35:37] who they are and once they realize who
[35:40] they are they can start to become like a
[35:42] great nation again amen he says they are
[35:45] great number he knows that they can be a
[35:48] very great nation so he wants to keep
[35:50] them trapped amen he wants to keep them
[35:53] with spiritual Amnesia so that they
[35:55] don't know who they are they
[35:56] continuously believe they are
[35:59] slaves but little did he know that this
[36:02] were the children of God yeah amen they
[36:04] were like that slave who do not forget
[36:06] his identity amen amen they knew the
[36:10] identity as children of God that is why
[36:12] they cried up unto God Amen they
[36:14] remember what promises God made to their
[36:16] forefathers amen amen so they cried out
[36:19] unto
[36:21] God but remember in as much as Pharaoh
[36:25] was hard on them God now said I have
[36:27] remembered my promises amen no matter
[36:30] what Pharaoh can do to you God has said
[36:32] I have remembered my promises amen who
[36:35] is the Greater King he is the great king
[36:38] amen he puts Kings into place he puts
[36:40] presidents into position hallelujah
[36:43] hallelujah amen God says I have come
[36:46] down to
[36:48] deliver amen now let's look at Exodus
[36:50] chapter 7 here's Moses and Aaron again
[36:53] before pharaoh and it says so Moses and
[36:55] Aaron went to pharaoh and did just as
[36:59] the Lord
[37:00] commanded Aaron threw his staff down in
[37:03] front of pharaoh and his officials and
[37:05] it became a snake now I thought Moses
[37:07] threw his staff down because in the
[37:10] movie it shows me that Moses threw his
[37:11] staff down Prince of Egypt the church
[37:15] WIll Tau us that Moses threw his staff
[37:17] down and performed the signs but here
[37:20] the Bible is telling us Aaron threw his
[37:22] staff down
[37:24] Amen in front of pharaoh and Aaron now
[37:27] is performing the
[37:30] supernatural verse 19 and the Lord said
[37:33] to Moses tell Aaron take your staff and
[37:37] stretch out your hand over the Waters of
[37:40] Egypt over the streams and canals over
[37:42] the ponds and over all the reservoirs
[37:45] and they will turn to
[37:47] blood and Moses and Aaron did just as
[37:50] the Lord commanded so here again the
[37:52] Lord is saying tell the Lord is saying
[37:54] to Moses tell Aaron stretch his rod over
[37:57] the SE I thought Moses stretched his Rod
[37:59] over the Nile and turned it into blood
[38:02] but here the Bible is telling us Aaron
[38:03] did it amen amen but God is instructing
[38:06] Moses and Moses is instructing Aaron
[38:09] amen oh we seen a Synergy here between
[38:11] the prophet and the fivefold
[38:14] ministry and the people remember Aaron
[38:16] is also typing the people of
[38:19] God Exodus chapter 8 and then the Lord
[38:22] said to Moses tell Aaron stretch out
[38:24] your hand with your staff over the
[38:26] streams and canals and ponds and make
[38:29] frogs come up on the land of Egypt and
[38:31] so Aaron stretched out his hand over the
[38:33] Waters of Egypt and the frogs came up
[38:35] and cover the land once again not Moses
[38:39] Aaron stretches out his his Ro and
[38:41] performs the supernatural now here's a
[38:43] canundrum I thought Moses was performing
[38:46] all the 10 plagues now if you go on to
[38:48] read the rest of the plagues you'll see
[38:50] that in some instances Moses does do it
[38:53] but it's showing you that Moses and
[38:54] Aaron is working together here it's not
[38:56] just Moses performing the supernatural
[38:58] amen you see Moses now is telling Aaron
[39:03] what to
[39:05] do Moses is prophesying and Aaron is
[39:08] prophesying again am we see in
[39:11] Revelation 10 8-19 effect because Moses
[39:15] is hearing from God and prophesying and
[39:17] now here is Aaron coming and prophesying
[39:19] the same thing again amen amen see the
[39:22] bride and the elect also has the power
[39:24] to perform the supernatural amen she
[39:27] also has a Ministry in partnership with
[39:29] the angel and the messenger because what
[39:32] the prophet tells us that the that the
[39:34] bride under her Messenger will be the
[39:37] final voice to the final age you see
[39:40] Aaron under Moses was the final voice to
[39:42] Egypt amen we didn't see that before cuz
[39:45] we only saw Moses but Aaron under Moses
[39:48] was the final voice to
[39:52] Egypt Aaron had thus say the Lord or he
[39:55] kept still amen only when Moses Moes
[39:57] prophesied do this then Aaron moved a
[40:01] amen God spoke to Moses Moses prophesied
[40:05] and Aaron prophesied it again amen you
[40:07] see how the church amen the church has
[40:10] always portrayed that Moses is doing
[40:12] everything and even like that in the
[40:14] message all through the years it was all
[40:15] about the Prophet The Prophet The
[40:17] Prophet The Prophet did this the prophet
[40:19] did the
[40:20] supernatural am man they begin to
[40:22] idolize what the prophet doing not
[40:23] realizing that we were called for the
[40:26] same purpose to work in partnership with
[40:28] the angel of the
[40:30] Lord
[40:35] amen you see there's another eron on the
[40:37] scene now another levitical order the
[40:40] fivefold ministry and the people of God
[40:42] Amen that has now been the final voice
[40:45] to later see am amen amen in Exodus
[40:49] chapter
[40:50] 3 and God said I will be with you and
[40:54] this will be the sign to you
[40:57] that that I have sent you now pay
[41:01] attention to this because my title is
[41:02] what is the final Vindication of William
[41:05] vandam's
[41:06] message God is saying to Moses when when
[41:09] God first meets Moses he's saying and
[41:12] this will be to you to Moses a sign that
[41:16] I have sent you when you have brought
[41:19] the people of Egypt out of Egypt when
[41:22] you have brought the Israelites out of
[41:24] Egypt and they will worship God on this
[41:26] mountain
[41:28] so God is saying when you deliver the
[41:30] people out of Israel out of Egypt and
[41:33] you bring them to this mountain to
[41:34] worship that is a sign unto you that I
[41:37] have sent
[41:38] you so all the supernatural signs that
[41:42] Moses did the first and second pool and
[41:45] so forth was not a sign to Moses that
[41:46] God had sent him the final sign the
[41:49] final Vindication that Moses message was
[41:51] true was when the people of God comes to
[41:54] the Mountain of God to worship and
[41:56] they're delivered out of Egypt
[41:59] yes you see the same Mountain where
[42:02] Moses seen the glory of the Lord the
[42:04] same Mountain where Moses met the angel
[42:06] of the Lord the pull of fire in the
[42:08] burning bush amen amen the same Mountain
[42:11] where where Moses can come down the
[42:13] mountain with an open book amen when he

[45:37] voice in the final age yes amen remember
[45:39] I told you Aaron is typing also the
[45:42] bride of Christ the people of
[45:44] God and just like how Aaron prophesied
[45:47] again the bride now is prophesying what
[45:49] William Brandon prophesied the bride is
[45:52] saying the same thing yes amen the same
[45:55] thing that the tape says the bride is
[45:57] saying we when William brand prophesy
[46:00] judgment upon the Earth the bride is
[46:02] prophesying the same things when you are
[46:05] telling people that Los Angeles is going
[46:06] to sink you are prophesying again amen
[46:09] when you are telling people that America
[46:11] is going to go up and smoke you are
[46:13] prophesying what William Von prophesied
[46:15] amen amen when you are prophesying that
[46:18] this bride is an invincible Army you are
[46:20] saying what the tape said you are
[46:22] prophesying what William Bram said amen
[46:24] so the bride is in Partnership amen
[46:28] you see the bride is ascending amen the
[46:31] same Mountain of God
[46:34] amen hallelujah
[46:36] amen amen so then there came a Time amen
[46:39] when Aon now types also the Fallen
[46:43] church we see in Exodus chapter
[46:46] 32 amen the Bible says when the people
[46:49] saw that
[46:52] Moses was so long in coming down from
[46:55] the mountain
[46:58] amen the people begin to get worried now
[47:00] where is Moses where's the prophet they
[47:03] gathered around Aaron who is the
[47:05] priesthood now the the fivefold ministry
[47:07] the preaching the ministry and said come
[47:11] make us Gods who will go before us as
[47:14] for this fellow Moses see they forgot he
[47:17] is a prophet of God now they say as for
[47:20] this fellow Moses who brought us up out
[47:22] of Egypt we don't know what has happened
[47:25] to him
[47:27] Aaron answered them and said take off
[47:29] the gold now here is the ministry now
[47:31] hearkening unto the voice of the people
[47:34] the ministry that supped to be upholding
[47:36] what Moses taught them the ministry that
[47:39] supped to be upholding the standards of
[47:41] the
[47:42] word is telling them take off the gold
[47:44] earrings that your wives your sons and
[47:46] your daughters are wearing and bring
[47:48] them up to
[47:49] me so all the people took off their
[47:51] earrings and brought them to Aon and we
[47:54] know how Aaron now started to take the
[47:56] jewelry and he started to form this
[47:58] golden calf and he started to Fashion it
[48:01] amen like the gods of
[48:03] Egypt so what did the church do when
[48:06] William Brandon was on the scene you had
[48:09] all the denominational world the
[48:12] churches and they started to Fashion
[48:14] themselves after the
[48:16] world the same things that they were
[48:19] delivered from when they came out of
[48:20] Egypt came out of the World when they
[48:22] got saved amen remember they had a
[48:24] genuine experience when they came to the
[48:26] Lord they got saved amen and they come
[48:29] into these churches now but now they had
[48:31] nowhere to go they had no Prophet
[48:34] amongst them why because they rejected
[48:36] William Brandon
[48:37] yeah and so they begin to influence
[48:40] their Ministries their famous preachers
[48:43] they popular preachers to form
[48:46] themselves Idols of the things of the
[48:48] world and they begin to take up the
[48:50] wealth of the world that is why you find
[48:53] all the churches that chase after money
[48:55] all these preachers that to chase after
[48:57] money and the things of the world why
[49:00] because they had abandoned the prophet
[49:02] they rejected the prophet's message amen
[49:04] and so now they started to hearken unto
[49:06] the people they knew that they needed to
[49:08] keep the people they wanted the numbers
[49:10] yes so they thought what can we do to
[49:12] keep the numbers so to satisfy the
[49:14] people they started to water down the
[49:16] gospel of Christ they started to take
[49:19] from the things of the world they
[49:21] started to Bob their hair they started
[49:24] to wear makeup this the preacher started
[49:26] to smoke they started to allow
[49:29] occasional drinking they started to amen
[49:32] allow all of these things to come into
[49:34] the church Sodom sodomites and all of
[49:37] these things started to come into the
[49:39] church amen like the children of Israel
[49:42] begin to do when Moses was up on the
[49:44] mountain receiving amen what was Moses
[49:47] receiving he was receiving directly from
[49:48] God the Ten
[49:50] Commandments and here was William gram
[49:52] he was going west Amen to receive of God
[49:55] the open book to receive of the Seven
[49:58] Seals amen but once he was coming down
[50:01] coming back with the Seven Seals and
[50:04] coming back with the open book he begins
[50:06] to see the people in this condition like
[50:09] Moses saw the people now when he came
[50:11] back down the mountain he saw the people
[50:13] in this condition a fallen
[50:15] church amen a church laid out in
[50:19] sin amen and so what did Moses do he
[50:22] broke the two tablets amen and he
[50:25] pronounced judgment upon them
[50:27] Amen in likewise now when the prophet
[50:29] now comes with the open book and the
[50:31] seals are open and he sees the church in
[50:33] this condition watch where the Prophet
[50:35] does he starts to preach Satan's Eden he
[50:38] starts to preach God of this evil age
[50:40] amen he starts to he starts to uh preach
[50:43] I indict this generation for crucifying
[50:46] the word
[50:47] again what is the prophet doing he's not
[50:49] in Breaking the word in opening the word
[50:51] and breaking the word like Moses broke
[50:53] the tablet he's pronouncing judgment on
[50:56] all those that have rejected the
[50:59] message
[51:01] amen but you see this is where the
[51:03] church
[51:04] fell amen they started to take on the
[51:07] things of the
[51:08] world this is why there's such a big
[51:11] responsibil uh responsibility on the
[51:13] ministry to make sure that they stay
[51:16] with what Moses said with what the
[51:18] prophet said amen and stay with what the
[51:20] T said you see they couldn't wait any
[51:23] longer Moses went up into the mountain
[51:25] and the Israelites began to get
[51:27] patient they couldn't wait any longer
[51:30] and the prophet says the Pentecostals
[51:32] and the denominations couldn't wait any
[51:35] longer they supposed to be waiting for
[51:37] the mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[51:40] they supposed to be waiting for the same
[51:42] message that the prophet was waiting
[51:45] for but they couldn't wait anymore so
[51:47] they started to impersonate you begin to
[51:49] get guys like T Osborne and all of these
[51:51] guys that started to impersonate the
[51:53] prophet why because they couldn't wait
[51:55] yeah just like the children of Israel
[51:57] they couldn't wait while Moses was up on
[51:58] the mountain and the prophet said
[52:01] because they couldn't wait they begin to
[52:02] take all of these gimmicks they begin to
[52:05] take all of these impersonations and he
[52:07] says why take all of these
[52:08] impersonations when the skies are full
[52:10] of the Pentecostal blessings amen you
[52:13] see but this is what the church begin to
[52:15] do and they begin to idolize these
[52:17] things and they now said behold these
[52:20] are the things that delivered you out
[52:22] they started to make speaking in tongues
[52:24] the evidence of the Holy Ghost they said
[52:26] when you receive the evidence of the
[52:28] when you receive speaking in tongues you
[52:30] receive the Holy Ghost this is what
[52:32] delivered you out of Egypt you see they
[52:34] couldn't wait for the
[52:40] prophet hallelujah amen you still with
[52:43] me amen amen
[52:46] hallelujah amen amen amen so they what
[52:50] what do they start to do they start to
[52:53] influence Aon Amen to water down the
[52:56] gospel and what does 2 Timothy 4 says
[53:00] for the time will come when they will
[53:01] not endure sound Doctrine yes but after
[53:04] their own lust they will keep amen who
[53:07] who's going to influence the ministry
[53:09] the people they will keep to themselves
[53:12] teachers having eing years and they
[53:15] shall turn away their ears from the
[53:17] truth and they shall be turned unto
[53:19] fables amen amen look at the fables now
[53:22] they are saying it wasn't Moses the
[53:24] prophet and his message that delivered
[53:25] you it was a golden Cal that delivered
[53:28] you
[53:29] fables amen but watch thou in all things
[53:32] enjoy Affliction amen Paul is telling
[53:36] Timothy to do the work of an evangelist
[53:38] and make full proof of thy
[53:41] Ministry and Paul is tell when Paul is
[53:43] telling Timothy this Paul is saying it's
[53:46] almost the time of my departure so it
[53:48] was at the ending of Paul's Ministry
[53:51] that he is saying that they are going to
[53:52] Heap TOS teaches have 18 years just just
[53:56] like that Moses was coming to the end of
[53:58] his ministry when they begin to do this
[54:01] just like William Brandon when he comes
[54:03] to the end of his ministry now the
[54:05] church World goes out in such a fallen
[54:07] condition to the point where he says I
[54:10] refuse to pray for them anymore he says
[54:12] the system is
[54:14] cursed and what did Aaron use to form
[54:18] this he used the very gold and the
[54:20] earrings amen that they took out of
[54:23] Egypt so this is a sign of showing them
[54:25] how they brought the world into the
[54:27] church they brought worldly music into
[54:29] the church they brought the worldly ways
[54:31] of doing things into the
[54:33] church amen amen they made everything
[54:36] about blessings yeah now was there
[54:38] anything wrong in being blessed there
[54:40] was nothing wrong in being blessed
[54:42] because remember God was the one who
[54:44] told Moses that when you leave in Egypt
[54:47] I will make the Egyptians favorable unto
[54:50] you that they will give you the gold and
[54:51] silver so God hey man what a God we
[54:54] serve a god of favor that will make even
[54:56] the heathens bless you even those that
[54:59] cursed you and and and was your
[55:01] Taskmaster God will make them bless you
[55:04] amen because that's the God we serve
[55:07] amen that's the god that we serve he
[55:09] will bless you by all means why you are
[55:12] the children of the most high God Amen
[55:15] so but now here Aon is taking the same
[55:18] spoils that God blessed them with amen
[55:21] and now he's making this into an idol
[55:34] amen so that is why amen the prophet
[55:37] when he comes down after breaking the
[55:38] seals amen he starts to preach all these
[55:41] messages he starts to preach God of this
[55:42] evil age he starts to pre Serpent's uh
[55:46] the serpent seed amen Satan's Eden and
[55:48] all of these things yes and he says I
[55:50] indict this generation that's exactly
[55:53] what Moses was doing why because the
[55:54] church world had fell but now whilst
[55:57] they had fell there was still an elect
[55:59] that stayed true to Moses's message amen
[56:02] there was Joshua and Caleb amen amen
[56:04] they were still the elect amen that knew
[56:07] that even though Moses had gone up into
[56:09] the mountain amen they were willing to
[56:11] wait for the outpouring they were
[56:13] willing to wait amen for what God had in
[56:16] store for them amen amen so just like
[56:19] that even though the church world had
[56:20] fell there was a people amen all through
[56:23] the years of the message amen there's
[56:25] been a people who's been patiently
[56:26] waiting amen patiently holding on to the
[56:29] words of the Prophet amen patiently amen
[56:32] 40 years 50 years 60 years in the
[56:34] message amen they've been patiently
[56:36] waiting what they've been waiting for
[56:38] this season amen this season when
[56:41] there's a mighty outpouring now of the
[56:43] holy spirit amen and when God is now
[56:45] ready to move amen now they are ready to
[56:48] receive of God they didn't take on the
[56:51] gimmicks amen over the years even in the
[56:54] message people uh rose up amen starting
[56:57] to amen call themselves The Messenger
[56:59] the eighth Angel and so forth started to
[57:01] form all of these doctrines why just
[57:03] like the prophet said they could not
[57:04] wait yeah they could not wait for the
[57:07] pouring the outpouring of what God
[57:09] wanted to do they could not wait for the
[57:11] Dynamics to fall upon the mechanics so
[57:14] they started to manufacture remember the
[57:16] prophet is saying Pentecost started to
[57:18] manufacture they couldn't wait for it so
[57:21] they started to manufacture it so that's
[57:24] what some people in the message started
[57:25] to do they started to manufacture they
[57:27] started to get hyped up over things over
[57:29] doctrines like the seven Thunders and
[57:31] virtues and all of these things they
[57:33] started to manufacture these things
[57:34] because they couldn't wait for the
[57:36] Dynamics to fall upon the mechanics amen
[57:39] because once the Dynamics falls upon the
[57:41] mechanics it makes it alive it makes it
[57:44] to live in you and I and once it's
[57:46] living in you and I then you don't have
[57:47] to manufacture anything it produces the
[57:50] results amen you see if it's just the
[57:53] mechanics alone it can't produce the
[57:55] results and if it's not that is why then
[57:57] you got to try and manufacture something
[58:00] but when the Dynamics is falling then
[58:02] the Dynamics and the mechanics together
[58:04] now produces the results amen but they
[58:08] couldn't wait amen but there's been a
[58:10] people of God that has been waiting and
[58:12] there's been a people of God that has
[58:14] come under preparation amen and and now
[58:17] is the time amen that the people of God
[58:19] are ready Amen to do the Greater Works
[58:22] amen he says the people of God will do
[58:24] great exploits amen amen hallelujah
[58:32] amen amen so just to read a few quotes
[58:35] amen the prophet in in in the spoken
[58:38] word is the Original Seed now he says a
[58:42] few things amen about the seed and about
[58:45] a people who is going to produce what
[58:48] was in the
[58:49] seed he says now there has been three
[58:52] different kinds of seeds
[58:54] planted it denominational seed by Bly
[58:58] gram he was the head
[59:00] planter Oral Roberts for the
[59:03] Pentecostals the Pentecostal seed has
[59:06] been
[59:07] planted I'm talking about the prophecies
[59:09] I'm talking about organization now and
[59:12] the word has been planted so three seeds
[59:15] went
[59:16] forth amen the denominational seed by
[59:19] buly Gram the Evangelical and so forth
[59:22] the Pentecostal seed by a Roberts and
[59:25] the prophets is the word seed amen that
[59:28] was planted by the messenger of the
[59:30] hour now this is why you cannot mix up
[59:33] the three because a seed can only bring
[59:36] forth after its own kind and if there
[59:38] are three different kinds of seed the
[59:40] three are going to produce different
[59:42] results amen the three can produce the
[59:45] same fruits amen if you think that the
[59:48] Pentecostals even though they have the
[59:50] gifts if you think that they are going
[59:52] to produce the word of God manifested in
[59:55] his hour you are mistaken amen they
[59:58] could only go as far as producing the
[1:00:00] gifts but there's a people who has the
[1:00:03] seed word of God that's going to produce
[1:00:05] the word seed of the hour amen amen
[1:00:08] that's going to produce the Son of God
[1:00:12] again now the prophet says now you'll
[1:00:14] have to understand folks I ain't going
[1:00:16] to say this no more unless God tells me
[1:00:18] see he's feeling checked here amen I
[1:00:21] want you to get this good and clear
[1:00:23] three seeds has been planted
[1:00:26] that's the reason the planting it's
[1:00:27] about
[1:00:28] over amen and the prophet says the seeds
[1:00:31] must be planted before the rain
[1:00:34] falls amen
[1:00:36] yes the prophet goes on to say I believe
[1:00:40] that it is near Harvest
[1:00:42] Time amen remember he's not saying it is
[1:00:45] it is Harvest time he's saying it is
[1:00:47] near Harvest time we know now we are in
[1:00:51] the Harvest Time amen the seeds have
[1:00:54] been planted the denom National seed of
[1:00:56] the churches such as the evangelicals
[1:00:58] the Baptist and Presbyterian and
[1:01:00] Lutheran and the Pentecostal seeds have
[1:01:02] been planted amen great men like Oral
[1:01:05] Roberts Tommy hick and Tommy Osborne
[1:01:07] Great Men of God and I believe that the
[1:01:10] word of God has been planted amen aren't
[1:01:12] you grateful amen that amen you know
[1:01:15] Jesus spoke about the parable of the s
[1:01:18] that went to se amen there's one that
[1:01:20] has solded the word of God
[1:01:22] unadulterated away from any of those
[1:01:25] organizations
[1:01:27] that's what's the matter the seed plant
[1:01:30] must have seed water before it can grow
[1:01:34] it must have water to fall before the
[1:01:36] seed that's planted can grow now the
[1:01:39] prophet says now just wait a minute you
[1:01:42] take the word former in Joel 2 and look
[1:01:45] at it and see if the Hebrew word which
[1:01:48] is Mora or Mora and get the Hebrew word
[1:01:52] interpreted it means teaching amen the
[1:01:55] teaching has went forth we just been
[1:01:58] revision now the teaching Reign has went
[1:01:59] forth the denominational teaching Reign
[1:02:02] has went forth they said a million more
[1:02:04] in 44 the Baptist and so on Oral Roberts
[1:02:08] and them brothers with the Pentecostal
[1:02:10] move amen they moved up into the
[1:02:12] millions see the seed has went forth the
[1:02:16] word for the minority the group now
[1:02:19] watch remember the word Mora means

[1:02:33] revivals going for all at the same time
[1:02:35] planting their seeds amen going around
[1:02:37] the world planting their seeds amen
[1:02:40] three kinds of Believers amen remember
[1:02:43] but the word seed is been
[1:02:45] planted now what's the matter now she is
[1:02:49] now waiting for the latter rain that's
[1:02:52] when she produces her fruits amen amen
[1:02:56] so we've had years and years of the
[1:02:57] teaching reign in the message amen we've
[1:03:00] been taught the word we've been
[1:03:01] disciplined in the word we've been
[1:03:03] taught all of these things all of the
[1:03:04] doctrines of the message Cod and all of
[1:03:07] these things we've went through the
[1:03:08] teaching rign which is the former Reign
[1:03:12] amen but the latter rain now is what
[1:03:15] causes us to produce the fruit the
[1:03:18] results now he says I hope you get her
[1:03:21] then the kind of seed you have planted
[1:03:23] in your field will be the kind of trop
[1:03:25] you will reap amen amen amen yes so if
[1:03:29] the word is planted in you you can only
[1:03:31] produce that kind of a fruit amen
[1:03:37] amen then that kind of seed you have
[1:03:39] planted in your field will be the kind
[1:03:41] of crop you will reap if the
[1:03:43] denomination if the doin denominations
[1:03:45] wants more members that's what they're
[1:03:47] going to get that's what they've got the
[1:03:50] Pentecostal wants more Pentecostal
[1:03:52] that's what they're going to get but the
[1:03:54] word is going to introduce Sons and
[1:03:57] Daughters of God Amen do we have sons
[1:03:59] and daughters of God in this hour amen
[1:04:02] why because there was a prophet planting
[1:04:04] the word seed amen you see you do
[1:04:06] understand that only because there was a
[1:04:08] s planting the word seed you can come
[1:04:10] forth in this hour amen because only the
[1:04:13] seed that was planted can come
[1:04:16] forth look at the great latter rain
[1:04:19] supposed to be done how the world how
[1:04:21] they would run over the wall leap over
[1:04:23] things and how they'd be this great this
[1:04:26] is the prophet not describing describing
[1:04:28] the attributes that are in you because
[1:04:31] remember whatever attributes are in the
[1:04:32] seed is in you if you are the fruit amen
[1:04:35] this people will be an invincible Army
[1:04:38] amen amen he says the kind of trop you
[1:04:40] get is the kind of seed you put in the
[1:04:42] field the latter rain is fixing to fall
[1:04:45] you've held the seed there long enough
[1:04:48] oh you see you've held the seed there
[1:04:49] long enough for all these years in the
[1:04:51] message the prophet is saying you've
[1:04:53] held there long enough unbelieving
[1:04:56] you've believed the word and you're
[1:04:58] looking for a coming son and he's coming
[1:05:00] amen that's the real church today so
[1:05:03] what's the real church today those amen
[1:05:06] that can produce the coming son amen if
[1:05:09] you're not producing the sun then you
[1:05:11] are not the real church amen because
[1:05:13] only the word of God can produce the sun
[1:05:16] because Mary said be it unto me
[1:05:18] according to Thy word amen the word
[1:05:20] formed within Mary amen produced the son
[1:05:23] and the Word was made flesh yes amen so
[1:05:26] if the word is within you it must
[1:05:28] produce the sun amen
[1:05:32] amen the prophetes and what they trying
[1:05:35] to do they're trying to manufacture the
[1:05:37] latter rain remember I told you they
[1:05:39] didn't they couldn't wait for it all
[1:05:40] along the Dynamics so they started to
[1:05:43] manufacture the latter rain and the
[1:05:45] prophet says it's just nonsense why the
[1:05:48] latter rain will sweep the world being a
[1:05:51] former rain sewing the words that's
[1:05:52] right now you'll see what the latter
[1:05:54] rain produced say you see just like Eve
[1:05:58] Eve could not wait any longer for Adam
[1:06:00] the prophet says I'm taking this now
[1:06:02] from spoken what is the Original Seed he
[1:06:05] says that Eve instead of waiting for
[1:06:07] Adam aen to speak the word and produce
[1:06:11] the son in
[1:06:12] her could not wait any longer and so she
[1:06:15] gave herself up to the
[1:06:17] serpent Sarah could not wait for the
[1:06:19] promise to come to Pastor she said take
[1:06:22] HEI the thy servant you see the church
[1:06:25] world could not wait amen so they begin
[1:06:28] to manufacture things amen amen but this
[1:06:32] bride the true elect of God like Mary
[1:06:35] amen waited amen remember Mary was a
[1:06:38] virgin what does that mean it means she
[1:06:40] was waiting for marriage it means she
[1:06:43] was waiting for the right time and
[1:06:44] season amen Mary was not impatient Mary
[1:06:49] did not try to manufacture anything amen
[1:06:51] so like that this bride amen now has
[1:06:54] been impregnated with the word of God
[1:06:56] amen amen and now she's going to produce
[1:06:58] the
[1:07:03] results you see why is protecting the
[1:07:06] word of God so important it was the word
[1:07:09] of God in Mary that was made flesh that
[1:07:12] produced the results this is why Amen in
[1:07:15] the message we've protected the word all
[1:07:17] of these years it's because that same
[1:07:19] word of God in you that is going to
[1:07:22] produce the
[1:07:23] results amen it's not a different word
[1:07:25] word it's not some just some
[1:07:27] Supernatural thing that's going to come
[1:07:28] down it's the same word that you've been
[1:07:30] watching all along is going to produce
[1:07:32] the results amen hallelujah amen the
[1:07:36] word of God living in US am amen this is
[1:07:39] why the word of God is so important amen
[1:07:42] not a Creed not a Dogma like the church
[1:07:45] World took but amen like Mary we take on
[1:07:48] the word of God
[1:07:50] yes now the prophet goes on to say that
[1:07:54] because the denominations planted they
[1:07:55] seed what crop did they reap reap they
[1:07:58] reaped a crop the prophet say of Ricky
[1:08:00] and Ras aen of Jezebel of painted faces
[1:08:04] they reaped a crop of wishy-washy
[1:08:07] Christians and of backsliding preachers
[1:08:10] and man preachers without a backbone
[1:08:11] that's the kind of trop they reached
[1:08:13] such a fallen condition that the prophet
[1:08:15] said give it 20 more years and the Pent
[1:08:19] the Pentecost will be far more worse
[1:08:20] than what the Catholic church is that's
[1:08:23] the crop that they have they are
[1:08:25] producing because that's the seed that
[1:08:26] was
[1:08:27] planted so the prophet says if that seed
[1:08:30] that was planted produced its crop how
[1:08:33] much more the word of God which was
[1:08:35] planted in seed form how much more is
[1:08:37] that going to produce the fruits in this
[1:08:39] hour what kind of a church amen if that
[1:08:42] produced a fallen Church what kind of a
[1:08:45] church is the word of God going to
[1:08:47] produce in this hour amen what kind of a
[1:08:49] people amen amen a people amen that can
[1:08:52] produce the very results of the word
[1:08:55] amen a people that can produce amen the
[1:08:57] Son of God manifested in flesh again
[1:09:00] amen a people that can produce the word
[1:09:03] amen the image Son of God Amen before
[1:09:06] the people yes why because the word amen
[1:09:09] imagine how much more potentials lay in
[1:09:11] that seed word amen if if a seed of
[1:09:15] discrepancy that was solded had so much
[1:09:17] of potential that it could make up the
[1:09:20] Pentecostal Church far more worse than
[1:09:22] the Catholic Church how much more
[1:09:24] potential Lays in the true seat of God
[1:09:26] yes amen amen how much more potential
[1:09:29] amen lays in you and I am think about it
[1:09:32] the church well has become this great
[1:09:34] thing this great organization they've
[1:09:36] taken over the world the church world
[1:09:40] Amen they've accumulated so much of
[1:09:42] wealth all of these churches all of
[1:09:44] these great preachers highly respected
[1:09:46] and all of these things they made a
[1:09:48] great name for
[1:09:49] themselves and if they as the seed of
[1:09:52] discrepancy are doing that then surely
[1:09:55] the the bride of Christ which has the
[1:09:57] seed word of God is going to produce the
[1:09:59] Greater Works amen amen the bride of
[1:10:02] Christ is going to produce all that God
[1:10:04] has promised throughout the word and
[1:10:06] that is why amen we title this message
[1:10:08] that we are the final Vindication of
[1:10:11] William Brandon's message because if the
[1:10:13] bride does not produce what this message
[1:10:16] has says said it will produce then
[1:10:18] William Brandon's message is not
[1:10:20] true but when the briad produces it it's
[1:10:23] a final vindication and then she becomes
[1:10:26] the final voice to the final age you see
[1:10:29] it's not just preaching out there and
[1:10:30] telling the people God sent a prophet
[1:10:32] that's not being the final voice to the
[1:10:34] final age you got to produce the result
[1:10:37] that was in the seed and when you show
[1:10:39] the fruits and they can see the fruits
[1:10:42] then now you have the final voice to the
[1:10:44] final age that is why when Moses and
[1:10:46] Aaron begin to show to the Egyptians the
[1:10:49] signs that was performed they became the
[1:10:52] final voice to Egypt
[1:10:55] amen so the bride of Christ is here now
[1:10:57] in this hour producing the final Works
[1:11:00] producing the supernatural producing the
[1:11:02] attributes of God and that is why they
[1:11:04] are the final voice in the hour amen
[1:11:07] amen the the parable of when Jesus said
[1:11:10] to his disciples gave them a parable or
[1:11:13] speaking to the Pharisees he said you
[1:11:15] know there was this landlord that
[1:11:18] planted a
[1:11:20] vard and as it became prosperous he
[1:11:23] started to hire workers to work the
[1:11:25] vineyard and he went
[1:11:27] away and over the years when it became
[1:11:29] time to give the fruit of the vineyard
[1:11:32] these workers now didn't want to produce
[1:11:34] the fruit and they started to kill all
[1:11:36] the Servants of God that he
[1:11:38] sent eventually Here Comes the Sun now
[1:11:42] and they kill the sun they say this is
[1:11:44] the air we'll kill the Sun and so what
[1:11:46] does the owner the landlord of the vard
[1:11:49] do he says he will come and he will slay
[1:11:52] them and he will give the vineard to
[1:11:54] another who can produce the fruits
[1:11:57] that's what the Bible says amen so God
[1:12:00] in in in the in the dispensation and
[1:12:03] change from the Old Testament to the New
[1:12:05] Testament took the vineyard from the
[1:12:07] Jews who could not produce the fruits
[1:12:09] and gave it to the
[1:12:11] Gentiles and now in the end time where
[1:12:13] the church world could not produce the
[1:12:15] fruits God has taken it away from them
[1:12:17] and he says I will give it to a people
[1:12:19] who can produce the fruits a people who
[1:12:22] has my potentials amen a people who is
[1:12:25] just like me and can speak like me they
[1:12:28] will produce the fruits in the hour amen
[1:12:30] so you see we amen are in partnership
[1:12:33] with God we are in partnership with the
[1:12:35] angel we are in partnership with the
[1:12:38] prophet because the bride under her
[1:12:39] messenger amen is going to produce the
[1:12:42] final Works amen amen so amen just to
[1:12:45] wrap things up and to sum up everything
[1:12:47] that we have been saying here amen Moses
[1:12:50] and Aaron and the angel of the Lord
[1:12:51] worked together and became the final
[1:12:54] voice to Egypt
[1:12:56] just like that in this hour now the
[1:12:57] bride under her messenger is the final
[1:13:00] voice to this age and she's producing
[1:13:02] the potentials she's producing the
[1:13:04] attributes of God she is producing
[1:13:07] everything that was laying within the
[1:13:08] seed why because it's Harvest Time amen
[1:13:12] amen the fruits are on display amen and
[1:13:14] you can't hide when the fruits are on
[1:13:16] display amen hallelujah amen just like
[1:13:19] how the denominational World they can't
[1:13:21] hide what they are and they are not
[1:13:23] trying to hide what they are they are
[1:13:25] very open about it they are no longer
[1:13:28] shy of of it you'll find them very
[1:13:30] openly accepting gays and lesbians in
[1:13:32] the church all over YouTube and all of
[1:13:34] these things they're not shy about it
[1:13:36] anymore they know who they are they know
[1:13:39] that they are reprobate amen they know
[1:13:42] that they cannot produce the word of God
[1:13:43] in this hour but just like that oh just
[1:13:47] like how the church world is no longer
[1:13:49] shy about it heyen the bride of Christ
[1:13:51] is no longer shy about who she is amen
[1:13:54] the bride of Christ amen has now stepped
[1:13:56] forth amen she begin to come become bold
