[0:00] The amazing
[0:03] sing
[0:07] how sweet
[0:10] the sound
[0:14] and
[0:17] the
[0:21] like
[0:27] I
[0:33] And now
[0:40] I was blind
[0:43] but
[0:46] I see
[0:50] we've been there.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[0:58] 10,000
[1:02] years
[1:05] bright
[1:08] shining
[1:11] shine as the stars.
[1:14] Oh yes.
[1:17] We know
[1:20] less days
[1:23] to sing
[1:26] to sing his praise.
[1:29] Then when
[1:31] we first
[1:34] came, Amen. We have a testimony. Through
[1:38] many dangers, we've come through.
[1:41] through many dangers, through many
[1:43] disappointments,
[1:44] many toils,
[1:47] &gt;&gt; many trials, many temptations.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; But I have already come. I have
[1:53] overcome.
[2:01] Oh, was the grace of God. Was grace
[2:07] that brought
[2:09] me.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; Say, "Grace will lead me.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Grace
[2:18] will lead
[2:21] me on." Let's sing. With his heart and
[2:25] flesh shall fail.
[2:27] And when
[2:30] this heart
[2:33] and flesh
[2:36] shall fail, and mortal life shall seize,
[2:40] and mortal
[2:43] life
[2:45] shall cease. We have a promise of a new
[2:48] body. I shall possess within the veil. I
[2:52] shall
[2:54] possess
[2:57] within
[3:00] &gt;&gt; a life of joy and peace. A life
[3:05] of joy.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just raise our hands to the
[3:11] Lord as we sing it one more time.
[3:12] Amazing grace.

[3:23] headstone has come down with shoutings
[3:25] of grace. Grace,

[3:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, my testimony is that I once was
[3:37] lost. I was.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; But as I stand here this morning, I'm
[3:43] found.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.

[14:31] &gt;&gt; it is now he said

[14:35] &gt;&gt; and preach the gospel.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; The gospel, this word wasn't just for

[15:18] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. AMEN.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; So we pray this morning that the the
[15:22] Lord will stir something within us. Uh
[15:24] I'm trying not to do a a preaching this
[15:27] morning. I just my introduction. I'm
[15:29] just want to do a little presentation
[15:30] that will maybe encourage you.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. To it will stir up the faithful in
[15:35] you to do something more for God. Amen.
[15:37] That's what we want to do. We just want
[15:38] to be faithful and want to do something
[15:40] for God.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Something for the kingdom. Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz I believe we should be kingdom
[15:45] minded. We always want to do something
[15:46] for ourselves.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. But God placed us for his purpose.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; And therefore when when we received his
[15:53] word, we said now we we sold all our
[15:55] treasures of this life. We found the
[15:57] pole of great price and we said Lord I
[15:59] want to be a prisoner to you and become
[16:01] a prisoner of Christ. In other words,
[16:03] it's no longer I that will it my father
[16:06] that you that will it in your will be
[16:08] done in me. No longer that's what my
[16:10] will but your will be done in my life.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we pray this morning we open
[16:15] our Bibles to the book of Luke.
[16:20] Chapter 16 reading from verse 1 to13.
[16:26] Pray that God will give us something
[16:27] this morning that will keep us inspired
[16:30] to be pressing on in his kingdom. Amen.
[16:33] And do something for his kingdom.
[16:37] Luke 16 1-13. And he says, "And he said
[16:42] unto his disciples, there was a certain
[16:45] rich man which had a steward,
[16:50] and the same was accused unto him that
[16:54] he had wasted his goods.
[16:58] And he called him, and said unto him,
[17:00] How is it that I hear this of thee?
[17:04] Give an account of thy stewardship."
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:10] for thou mayest be no longer steward.
[17:14] Then the steward said within himself,
[17:16] what shall I do? For my lord take away
[17:18] from me the stewardship. I cannot dig to
[17:22] beg. I am ashamed.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; I am resolved what to do that when I am
[17:27] put out of the stewardship, they may
[17:30] receive me into their house. So he
[17:32] called every one of his lords debtors
[17:35] unto him and said unto the first, how
[17:37] much owest thou unto my lord? And he
[17:41] said and 100 measures of oil and he said
[17:43] unto him, take thy bull and sit down
[17:45] quickly and write 50. So now he wants to
[17:47] be deceitful now.
[17:49] And then said he to another, and how
[17:52] much?
[17:56] And he said, how much was thou? And he
[17:58] said, and 100 measures of wheat. And he
[17:59] said unto him, "Take thy bill and write
[18:01] four score."
[18:04] And the four score and the Lord
[18:07] commanded
[18:09] I
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Well, eight. Okay.
[18:24] Sorry. Four score.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. And the Lord commanded that the
[18:30] unjust steward because he had done
[18:33] wisely. For the children of this world
[18:35] are in their generation wiser than the
[18:38] children of lights. And I say unto you,
[18:41] make to yourselves friends of the mammon
[18:44] of unrighteousness.
[18:47] That when you fail, they may receive you
[18:50] into everlasting habitations.
[18:54] He that is faithful in that which is
[18:56] least is faithful also in much.
[19:01] And he that is unjust in the least is
[19:05] unjust also in much. If therefore you
[19:09] have not been faithful in the
[19:10] unrighteous mammon,
[19:14] who will commit to you?
[19:17] Who will commit to your trust the true
[19:20] riches? And if you have not been
[19:22] faithful in that which is another man's,
[19:25] who shall give you that which is your
[19:28] own? No servant can serve two masters.
[19:31] For either he will ate the one and love
[19:34] the other, or else he will alter the one
[19:36] and despise the other, he cannot serve
[19:39] God and memon. Amen. You may be seated.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; So I just want to speak this morning on
[19:45] a little little title.
[19:47] Give an account of thy stewardship.
[19:50] Amen. Amen.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; I'm taking it from the book of Luke.
[19:53] Amen. Give an account of thy
[19:56] stewardship.
[19:58] And that's a question to every believer
[20:01] &gt;&gt; to give an account of thy stewardship.
[20:06] Now, God made us stewards. We know that
[20:09] our life, the very life we have is
[20:11] God's.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; The gift that you have is God's.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; The family that God has blessed you with
[20:18] is God's.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The time that you have allotted to
[20:21] you on this earth is God's.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; The influence that you have over man is
[20:27] God's.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; THIS VERY MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED
[20:31] IS GOD'S.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; And every opportunity that you have on
[20:36] this earth belongs to God.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; But we speaking on stewardship this
[20:42] morning.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; What does it mean? It means management
[20:47] of something that belongs to someone
[20:49] else.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Now everything that we have, it belongs
[20:53] to God. But we are here to MANAGE IT.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK to the beginning. When God
[20:58] put man on the earth, he made him the
[20:59] God of the earth to manage the earth.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He made him have dominion to
[21:04] manage the earth.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; So God is is still God of the
[21:10] everything. He's the creator. Amen. All
[21:12] things belongs to him. But we are there
[21:15] to manage what he has entrusted us.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; He has entrusted us to certain things.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; So God is the owner and we are his
[21:26] stewards.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; So what does stewardship means? IT MEANS
[21:32] THERE MUST BE responsibility
[21:36] &gt;&gt; and there must be accountability.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; A lot of people these days don't like to
[21:41] be accountable.
[21:43] Therefore, you find a lot of people not
[21:45] serving God or they claim to serve God
[21:48] but don't want to be found under a
[21:51] fellowship.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; The reason why they don't want to be
[21:54] found under a fellowship and they claim
[21:56] to serve God. They claim to be believe
[21:58] the message of the hour is because they
[22:01] don't want to be accountable.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. And the reason why why
[22:06] they don't want to be accountable,
[22:09] they are not responsible
[22:12] &gt;&gt; for the things that God entrusted them
[22:14] with.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; For them to claim to have believed the
[22:17] message of the hour because not this
[22:19] message is not meant for everyone to
[22:21] see.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; So they claim to to receive this message
[22:25] but they don't want to take on the
[22:27] responsibility
[22:29] &gt;&gt; because receiving this message the
[22:31] message come with what it was a shout
[22:33] that went forth. Amen. A mighty angel
[22:36] come down. But then also the scripture
[22:38] said you must take the book, eat the
[22:39] book.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; But he didn't stop there. He said THAT
[22:42] THOU MUST PROPHESY AGAIN.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; So there IS A RESPONSIBILITY
[22:48] BECAUSE WHEN YOU have received the Holy
[22:50] Ghost,
[22:52] what it mean? The spirit of Christ is
[22:54] now in you.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; And then IF THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN YOU,
[22:59] then that means there MUST BE A
[23:00] REFLECTION OF CHRIST FROM WITHIN YOU.
[23:02] FROM WITHIN YOU.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; And our people DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT
[23:06] RESPONSIBILITY AND SHOW THAT REFLECTION
[23:09] OF CHRIST.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; So what they do? They hide in them.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Help us
[23:15] &gt;&gt; instead of coming to fellowship. Because
[23:17] when you come into fellowship, you are
[23:19] now finding your place in the body.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY WAY GOD CAN FUNCTION IS
[23:25] THROUGH THE BODY.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; God chose no other WAY BUT FUNCTIONING
[23:30] THROUGH HIS BODY.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And if you're not in fellowship,
[23:34] THEN YOU'RE NOT FINDING YOUR PART IN the
[23:36] body to be placed in the body.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Now there's no now each fellowship is
[23:42] sovereign, but each one has a part to
[23:44] play in the body. There might BE A
[23:46] DIFFERENT PART OF THE BODY, BUT THEY ARE
[23:48] PLACED POSITIONALLY PLACED IN THE BODY
[23:50] OF CHRIST.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; And this body IS A FULLY FUNCTIONAL
[23:54] BODY.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; So stewardship means responsibility and
[24:00] accountability.
[24:02] SO A STEWARD MUST PROTECT IT.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; YES.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; And you must use it correctly.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; What has been until much is given much
[24:13] is required.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Much word is given to you in this hour.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; You are GIVEN IN A FOOD IN ABUNDANCE.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; YES.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; But you must use it correctly.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; You must ALSO PROTECT IT. HOW DO YOU
[24:26] PROTECT THIS WORD?
[24:30] by the very life that you live.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; The people are looking at your life.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Your life presents the gospel.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; You can't be higher than you preach. You
[24:42] can't live higher than you preach.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; So if you are claiming to believe this
[24:46] message and to have received this
[24:48] message, then people are watching your
[24:49] life.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; SO YOU GOT TO WATCH. YOU GOT TO PROTECT
[24:52] THIS WORD. YOU GOT TO PROTECT THE
[24:54] MESSAGE TO NOT BRING uh disrepute to the
[24:57] word.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. SO YOU GOT TO PROTECT THE WORD
[25:03] &gt;&gt; BY GUARDING YOUR LIFE
[25:04] &gt;&gt; BY THE CHOICES YOU MAKE IN LIFE BY THE
[25:07] THINGS YOU HAVE THAT PEOPLE YOU hang
[25:08] around with.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; BY THE INFLUENCES YOU HAVE.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT IS GIVEN TO YOU, you must now
[25:18] increase it.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; In other words, this very word that's
[25:21] given to you, you go now. And how you do
[25:24] you increase this word now? You absorb
[25:26] this word.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; YES. YOU GO AND STUDY THE word to show
[25:30] itself approved.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; We living in a time where people just
[25:35] want food just thrown to them. They
[25:38] don't want to digest it and let it let
[25:40] it take effect in their lives.
[25:43] You know what's gobble and go.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; People want to gobble and go and have
[25:47] takeouts.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Those foods are processed foods.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; But proper food that takes time to
[25:54] digest. And you haven't you know why
[25:55] you're having proper food? Because your
[25:57] intention is that when I eat this food,
[25:59] it's going to make a difference to my
[26:01] body.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; It's going to benefit me.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; So just like when you eat spiritual
[26:06] food, you don't just go and go anything.
[26:08] You go and study it.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible said the Brian, they
[26:12] study the scriptures.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; You go back from what he's preached to
[26:15] you. Now remember the the preacher
[26:18] cannot just speak everything to you.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; He's giving you nuggets. He's giving you
[26:22] the word. But you absorb from there and
[26:24] then you take you go. Now he's making
[26:26] reference to scriptures. He's making a
[26:28] reference to quotation. YOU GO BACK,
[26:30] &gt;&gt; YOU STUDY IT.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU GROW FROM THERE.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; You increase with the word.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not deprived of anything
[26:38] this hour. You've got all the word
[26:40] revealed to you.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; So you increase with IT
[26:44] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU GOT TO GIVE AN
[26:46] ACCOUNT FOR IT.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Brother was just sharing with me the
[26:50] other day and he was just so excited and
[26:53] he was telling me you know uh how he had
[26:56] to come in the message just because of
[26:58] fellowship.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Just by fellowship the word was brought
[27:02] out and he come in the message of the
[27:04] hour.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; So just like that we got TO GIVE AN
[27:08] ACCOUNT FOR WHAT WE RECEIVED.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; YES.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; When we fellowship with people do we
[27:12] present the gospel?
[27:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Do we present the gospel when Mary is
[27:16] negative? Yeah.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Do we present the GOSPEL WHEN THE PEOPLE
[27:19] ARE TOXIC AROUND YOU?
[27:21] &gt;&gt; When when when the WORLD IS IN SUCH
[27:23] CHAOS AND MAN IS living in fear, do we
[27:25] present hope to them?
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. DO WE SHOW THEM THERE'S A BETTER
[27:29] WAY OF LIFE?
[27:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. There's a there's hope when man is
[27:34] in DESPAIR
[27:35] &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS THROUGH JESUS CHRIST.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. When the world HAS NO SOLUTION TO
[27:40] PROBLEMS, THE GOSPEL HAS A SOLUTION TO
[27:42] EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; EVERY AREA OF YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; All redemptive BLESSINGS BELONGS TO US.
[27:49] AMEN.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ABSOLUTELY.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; And if God is working through THE BODY,
[27:54] THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY the world will have
[27:56] to have this gospel IS THROUGH YOU AND
[27:58] I.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Because the headstone came crying grace
[28:04] shouting with shouting of grace. Grace.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; So grace CAN ONLY BE GIVEN THROUGH the
[28:11] body presented through the body in this
[28:13] hour.
[28:17] So one day we got to give an account for
[28:19] all that is given to us.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Stewardship is the wise and faithful
[28:25] handling of anything God places in your
[28:27] hands.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; So that this includes for example
[28:33] if if God placed you to be a musician
[28:36] then you got to be a good steward of it.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; That's the challenge he's given you.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; If he's placed you to be a housewife
[28:42] that is what God placed you to be.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. because you are blessed already
[28:46] because you you found a husband
[28:48] &gt;&gt; and you're married. God gave you given
[28:51] your husband. So you should be fit. You
[28:52] should be privileged. Some people are
[28:54] complaining they don't have an husband.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; So you should look at where God PLACED
[28:58] YOU. SOME PEOPLE ARE complaining they
[29:00] don't have children.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; So if God has given you children, you
[29:04] must know how TO BRING RAISE THEM UP IN
[29:05] THE WAYS OF THE LORD.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; And then God has given you time.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. HOW ARE YOU MANAGING YOUR TIME?
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Because for what what you put where you
[29:20] spend most of your time will show what
[29:23] the results are. For example, if you
[29:25] spend your time in garbage with all the
[29:28] filth and all the things on social media
[29:30] and all the so and all those things that
[29:32] will that will show when you look at
[29:34] your spiritual growth, it will show what
[29:37] you spend your time with.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WITH THE THINGS
[29:40] OF GOD.
[29:43] with the people of God.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; A lot of people are spending time with
[29:47] toxic people.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; People who are just negative.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BAD INFLUENCE OVER
[29:54] THEM. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. NOW,
[29:56] &gt;&gt; now don't misconrue what I'm saying.
[29:59] Now, I'm not saying that you must not go
[30:01] to the unsaved.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; I am saying not to be influenced
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; by the people around you.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. But I if you are strong enough, you
[30:10] can go to the even a drunkard to even to
[30:12] a drug addict and be around him and you
[30:15] can influence them.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying don't be don't let them
[30:19] influence you.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; The same with your families that are not
[30:24] saved and denomination. I'm not saying
[30:25] don't go to your families. You need to
[30:27] go to them, but present the gospel TO
[30:29] THEM
[30:30] &gt;&gt; OR SHOW THEM A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; BECOME SALTY THAT THEY BECOME THIRSTY.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T BE AROUND THEM AND THEY ARE
[30:36] INFLUENCING YOU. YES.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Every time you leave from them, you take
[30:39] out something from them.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; BUT LET EVERY TIME YOU LEAVE THERE, THEY
[30:43] SAY THERE'S something different about
[30:44] them.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; They always consistent.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; There's something different about their
[30:49] lives. There's always a sweet nature
[30:51] about them.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; And the things that they speak about in
[30:55] the Bible, I never heard these things.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; We don't hear these things in our
[30:58] churches.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; So, how do we handle? We must be
[31:05] faithful in handling what God has placed
[31:08] in our hands.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; If he's given us finances.
[31:13] If today is a million rand in your
[31:15] account, is that going to change
[31:18] &gt;&gt; your attitude?
[31:20] Is that going to make you a different
[31:22] person?
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Now, that is why you find that in life
[31:27] you go through stages.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; God will bless you with little things.
[31:31] And if you manage the little things
[31:34] firstly in a little salary that you have
[31:38] your first job maybe it was a mega
[31:40] salary
[31:42] &gt;&gt; but you still was faithful in your
[31:43] tithing.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; You still was faithful in coming to
[31:46] church
[31:47] &gt;&gt; trying to find put that petrol even when
[31:49] you was barely affording petrol. Yes.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; You put that petrol and you came to
[31:53] church.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; And then God blessed you with a better
[31:56] job.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Then when the better job came now
[31:58] it's harder to pay a little more tithe
[32:02] &gt;&gt; or did you find yourself? No it's not
[32:04] hard it just part I've learned from the
[32:06] first stage of my life.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; God has taken me from there to a better
[32:10] stage. So now I can continue paying my
[32:12] tithes according to what I earn now and
[32:14] from there I I petrol is not an issue
[32:17] anymore.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Now God has blessed me with a better
[32:19] car.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; I will make sure now and this better car
[32:22] can take me to other places.
[32:24] But I will make sure my church days are
[32:26] my church days.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; I've got more money to go on more
[32:30] holidays, but my time for the Lord is
[32:33] important. Amen.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; So, how are you managing your finances?
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; So, if God if you are managing your
[32:43] finances in the right way, are you
[32:44] spending it in the wrong things?
[32:47] And now if God has blessed you with your
[32:49] money and you're going to go spend it
[32:50] gambling.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to go spend it on worldly
[32:54] things.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Buying for example just say you
[33:00] supporting worldly events
[33:03] &gt;&gt; and you spending your finances there.
[33:06] So how God is going to bless you further
[33:08] now?
[33:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; You got to give an account.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then God has given us
[33:15] opportunities.
[33:17] Maybe he's given you an opportunity to
[33:19] speak to somebody.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; But you wouldn't open your mouth.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Because now you have fear of what they
[33:25] will say.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; You will fear of how they're going to
[33:29] take the word.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Are you relying upon yourself? Did he
[33:32] not say in that hour he will give you
[33:33] the words?
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; You are dependent on yourself. You're
[33:36] supposed to be dependent upon the Holy
[33:38] Spirit.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT WORD TO
[33:41] SPEAK.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THEN PAUL SAY, "I BECOME
[33:43] ALL THINGS to all men
[33:45] &gt;&gt; in every situation." NO MATTER WHAT THEY
[33:47] TALKING ABOUT, YOU CAN PUT YOURSELF IN
[33:49] THAT SITUATION. IF IT'S SPORTS, TALK
[33:50] ABOUT SPORTS, BUT BRING GOD IN IT. AMEN.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; But you you you need TO KNOW HOW TO
[33:56] bring God in every situation.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; God has also given us spiritual gifts.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:07] Are we mismanaging it or are we using it
[34:09] for the benefit of the kingdom or we are
[34:12] not harnessing it?
[34:16] &gt;&gt; God has given us gifts but we're not
[34:18] living consecrated lives.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; We not be having a consistent prayer
[34:21] life.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; For now God to take us further. Amen.
[34:25] With those gifts
[34:28] &gt;&gt; or God has blessed us with a ministry.
[34:31] how we are not spending time to now
[34:34] progress in the ministry or we just want
[34:36] to remain stagnant.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; No, we we want to do things FOR THE
[34:41] KINGDOM OF GOD.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; We got to have the father's mindset.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have the mind of Christ.
[34:47] AND THE FATHER'S MINDSET is saying go
[34:49] into all the world and preach the
[34:51] gospel.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; God is not wishing to any anyone to
[34:54] perish, but he needs people to God. He
[34:58] said
[34:59] &gt;&gt; the harvest is plenty
[35:01] &gt;&gt; and the laborers are few.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; If somebody can show me a scripture in
[35:04] the Bible where it's taken out
[35:06] &gt;&gt; in this hour,
[35:08] &gt;&gt; he still says the harvest is plenty but
[35:11] the laborers are few.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:18] So God has placed all these things
[35:22] before us. Amen. So stewardship also
[35:25] means aligning everything in your life
[35:26] with God's will and purpose.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; So in other words, your time, your
[35:31] finance, your your family life,
[35:34] everything you align with God's purpose.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Your career choices, your marriage
[35:39] choices, all the things that you're
[35:41] aligning is with God's purpose.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:47] Now we are God has given us entrusted us
[35:50] with his word. He's given us the
[35:53] blueprint of what he once done with his
[35:55] word. Amen. So he's given us this. He
[36:00] entrusted us. He entrust us with this
[36:01] thing here. So he wants us to take his
[36:04] word forward.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; There's no one else coming to take this
[36:09] word forward except you that's to you
[36:11] that it's revealed to you in this hour.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Remember, after we leave this earth when
[36:17] our time is done here
[36:19] &gt;&gt; and God is done with the Gentiles,
[36:22] &gt;&gt; the gospel leaves the earth.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. The the the God leaves the
[36:27] Gentiles
[36:28] &gt;&gt; and he goes to the Jews.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; So the only opportunity
[36:33] for this gospel on the earth is through
[36:35] you and I. Yes.
[36:41] So it also means
[36:44] being faithful in both small and great
[36:46] things. All this is from uh the book of
[36:49] Luke. Amen. Luke 16:10 says, "He that is
[36:52] faithful in that which is least is
[36:54] faithful also in much."
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; So we know when we start being faithful
[37:00] in small things,
[37:02] &gt;&gt; then we are now getting ready for the
[37:04] next stage
[37:05] &gt;&gt; for greater responsibility. Yes.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; And I'll just read to you as the prophet
[37:11] brought it out in the quote. He speaks
[37:21] in the message. The queen of the south
[37:23] says, "Now there's a change in my
[37:26] ministry coming.
[37:28] And how many would there be one year
[37:31] that remembers when I first started on
[37:33] the field?"
[37:35] He said, "You remember it was given to
[37:37] me by the angel of the Lord that I would
[37:39] take my left hand and lay it onto the
[37:41] person who was st standing sick and not
[37:44] use my own voice and he would speak out
[37:47] and tell them what was wrong with them."
[37:48] You remember that? And you remember I
[37:50] told you that the Holy Spirit told me
[37:52] that night when I talked to him what it
[37:54] would be and said, "Then if you will be
[37:57] sincere,
[37:59] I'll come to a place that you'll know
[38:01] the very secret of their heart." See
[38:04] when the first gift was given to him he
[38:06] had to be sincere.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Then how many of you that was in my
[38:11] first meetings heard me tell that before
[38:14] that ever come to pass raise up your
[38:16] hand. That's good. That has come to
[38:18] pass. Then he said if you continue to be
[38:21] sincere
[38:22] &gt;&gt; and humble.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; So he's giving you some secrets here.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; You want to progress in your spiritual
[38:27] work. Be sincere be humble.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. are grow greater. Sorry, it'll it
[38:35] will grow greater and greater.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; And now this ministry is going to step
[38:40] higher now.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Into another realm. So here's another
[38:45] secret in ministry. Now if you want it
[38:47] to go greater and greater is to continue
[38:50] to be sincere and humble.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; WHERE IT WILL BE FAR BEYOND WHAT IT IS
[38:58] NOW. I don't know just what it is, but
[39:01] I'm one of the Holy Spirit to quickly
[39:04] now close my meetings off. My last one
[39:06] will be in Philadelphia and go into the
[39:08] hills and wait on the Lord to see which
[39:10] way to conduct this ministry. When I
[39:12] come out again, it'll be a new ministry.
[39:15] This ministry will never seize. This
[39:18] ministry will continue on. The first
[39:20] will continue on. It's still just the
[39:22] same.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Now, God gives gifts. He never takes
[39:27] gifts.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yes, Lord.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Your gift remains. But if you'll be
[39:32] honest with what you've got, God will
[39:35] take other talents and just keep pouring
[39:39] them on you.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Just keep pouring them on.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; If you just keep climbing on
[39:45] &gt;&gt; So, he's not going to take the gift the
[39:47] So, just like just like that, he's not
[39:48] going to take the initial scriptures in
[39:50] the Bible, Mark 16 and so forth, but
[39:52] he's going to be pouring on and on
[39:54] &gt;&gt; if you be faithful in it. Amen. There
[39:56] must be a progression, but he's not
[39:58] going to take all the other things away.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; He's always done it like in the Luda
[40:02] age, the Wesley age, or the Pentecost
[40:04] age, and on and on and on. There's no
[40:07] limit to it. God keeps on. So pray for
[40:11] me for needing needing badly needing
[40:13] your prayers. So you see what the
[40:14] prophet is saying here now. How there's
[40:17] a progression.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; By firstly being sincere and humble. So
[40:21] when you see that God is make making you
[40:23] climb up higher, he's taking you to
[40:25] higher heights, the progression, the
[40:27] secret is to stay sincere, to stay
[40:30] humble and be ready for the next move.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz God is always progression. God
[40:36] is always taking you to higher heights.
[40:38] Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; But he wants us to be faithful in his
[40:43] little things first.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; So stewardship means representing God in
[40:48] your decisions.
[40:50] Now we know that sometimes it's hard for
[40:53] people to be faithful in little things.
[40:55] You want to progress in life, people
[40:57] just want to land themselves in the best
[40:58] job, the high paying jobs. Now you find
[41:02] that in life uh
[41:05] responsibility comes with firstly you
[41:07] get a you go and take any job to get
[41:10] some experience
[41:12] &gt;&gt; and from there you that the experience
[41:15] is already adding on your CV. You be
[41:17] sincere in the job, you be faithful in
[41:19] the job. What happens the the next
[41:21] employer that's employing you saw that
[41:23] you worked in the job
[41:25] &gt;&gt; saw that you had a good recommendation
[41:27] in the job.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; And now he puts you into another job.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Then you go higher and higher.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; You know, I was just thinking about this
[41:34] in the morning. One of the lowest paying
[41:37] jobs that you can ever find in
[41:39] internships is a being a lawyer is the
[41:42] lowest paying jobs because the hardest
[41:45] thing to to do is to become a candidate
[41:48] attorney. That's because they are it's
[41:50] such a lowpaying job. But if somebody is
[41:53] faithful and sincere as a candidate
[41:56] attorney in that lowpaying job
[42:01] after they have completed becoming an
[42:04] attorney
[42:06] then there's progression from there and
[42:08] there's blessings from there.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; But a lot of people leave and give up.
[42:14] They're not willing to become a candid
[42:15] attorney. They don't want to take all
[42:16] the the things that they go through as a
[42:18] Canada attorney. They speak up, but they
[42:19] you get a lot of them posting on
[42:21] Facebook and so forth, posting how
[42:22] terrible their journey was because they
[42:25] don't they just want to go there and
[42:26] just they see all the fleshy attorneys
[42:29] and they think now we supposed to just
[42:30] land a good paying job. So that's one of
[42:33] the hardest job to become is becoming an
[42:35] attorney because it starts off with so
[42:37] low such a low salary
[42:39] &gt;&gt; and the expectations are high of you as
[42:41] a candidate attorney but people that are
[42:43] faithful in it and remain in it they
[42:45] progress from there but people give up
[42:48] along the way. So same that spiritually
[42:52] when we come a Christian everything is
[42:53] nice and rosy we excited to be with the
[42:56] Lord we excited with the things that God
[42:57] is giving us. Then the trials come.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; But through this trial and suffering,
[43:04] God is mourning character.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEN AS THE TRIALS COME, WE WANT
[43:10] TO GIVE UP ALONG the way.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Yet we forget about the promises OF GOD.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE NOT HAVING the the you're not
[43:16] seeing the bigger picture. Amen. That
[43:19] God has a bad expected end for you.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; He's promised you an expected end.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; And your end is promised.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. He's already showing you what your
[43:28] end result is.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; But along the journey, you must be tried
[43:32] and tested.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Because why? HE'S BRINGING THE BEST OUT
[43:36] OF YOU.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE WHY? YOU COULDN'T DO IT ON
[43:40] YOUR OWN. GOD HAD TO SQUEEZE YOU AND
[43:42] BRING THE BEST out of you. Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; So
[43:49] stewardship means representing God in
[43:53] your decisions.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:57] What does that mean?
[43:59] I have a choice
[44:02] to marry an unbeliever.
[44:04] I'm going to make a decision to marry an
[44:06] unbeliever. Is that representing God in
[44:08] your decision?
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; I made a decision that I want to go now
[44:17] and gamble.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Is that representing God in my decision?
[44:21] But if I if I say no, I want to find a
[44:24] partner that serves God.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; I'll give you an example of how people
[44:28] think.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; If if I say I I want to be a person that
[44:31] want to find a partner that serves God,
[44:34] &gt;&gt; that faithfully serves God, then I'm I'm
[44:36] representing God in my decision.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT IF I'M SAYING NO, I will just
[44:44] go and just marry any partner that don't
[44:46] serve God. Then what decision am I what
[44:48] am I representing
[44:50] &gt;&gt; in my decision?
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Um I'm say I want to be a gambler. What
[44:55] how am I how am I representing God in
[44:58] that decision?
[45:00] &gt;&gt; All things that we have given in our
[45:02] life,
[45:04] we we need to represent God in the
[45:05] decision.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; And you'll know it because it must match
[45:08] with the word.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; You'll know if it's representing God
[45:11] because God is one with his word. Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; If your decisions don't align with the
[45:16] word.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Then you are not representing God.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Be it any decision,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; be it a career choice, be it a marriage
[45:24] choice, be it a financial choice,
[45:27] whatever things that you do in this
[45:29] life,
[45:31] if it doesn't align with the word, then
[45:33] you are not representing God.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:37] Everything that every decision that you
[45:38] take in this life must align with the
[45:40] word.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; When Jesus our example walked upon the
[45:45] earth, everything that he did, it had to
[45:48] please the father.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thank you, father, that you
[45:52] have shown me this."
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew that his decisions pleased
[45:56] the father.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Our prophet on the earth when he walked
[46:00] everything that he did, he make a
[46:01] decision and he knew that he had to make
[46:03] a decision that would have pleased God.
[46:04] when he didn't do that when he was when
[46:07] the Holy Spirit told him to come to
[46:09] Durban, South Africa and he was prompted
[46:12] by ministers
[46:15] &gt;&gt; until eventually he had to give into
[46:17] them because he felt it made him they
[46:19] made him feel uncomfortable
[46:20] &gt;&gt; and he had TO PAY THE PRICE FOR IT.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; But that decision didn't represent God.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; YES.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WAS DIRECTING HIM TO DURBAN,
[46:30] SOUTH AFRICA.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; YES. YES. BECAUSE GOD HAD A PLAN AND
[46:33] PURPOSE FOR DURBAN, South Africa.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; So we learn from these things. Amen. The
[46:42] choices that we make, the decisions we
[46:44] take, it must represent God.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Otherwise there will be consequences.
[46:50] In your workplace, what they call it
[46:52] consequence management.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; When someone do something wrong, they
[46:55] say there'll be consequence management.
[46:57] So just like that the choices that we
[47:00] make will have consequences.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; And a GOOD STEWARD WILL ACT ON BEHALF OF
[47:09] THE MASTER.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Every choice reflects who you serve.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; So every believer is responsible for God
[47:20] what God reveals to them. So God gives
[47:23] small things first. If you are faithful,
[47:25] he will trust you with greater things.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Just like that, we all know that when we
[47:30] came into the message, we didn't see
[47:32] everything.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; But then we as God started showing us
[47:36] more things.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; And we are faithful in that.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Then he started progressing us.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Then more light was added.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Then as you are still faithful in that,
[47:45] more light was added.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And as you continue faithful in that,
[47:48] MORE LIGHT WILL BE ADDED. AMEN.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Just that when God gives you gifts, YOU
[47:52] HONESTLY THE GIFTS AND GOD will take you
[47:54] to higher heights with your gifts.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; And then if you are responsible with the
[47:58] GIFTS THAT HE'S GIVEN YOU, then he will
[48:00] take you to places you never thought you
[48:02] would go.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; God's gifts always find their places.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Places that you thought you'd never be
[48:09] in.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; You might just think this is a little
[48:12] small assembly, but there will be places
[48:14] here. There will be people here that
[48:15] will preach in other countries. There
[48:17] will be people here but God will use
[48:18] their talents in other places.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; But it all comes to would they be
[48:24] responsible what God has given them.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; So gifts must be handled carefully.
[48:30] God observes how you use what he gives
[48:33] you
[48:36] cuz we're going to be judged with what
[48:38] you did with that opportunities. Amen.
[48:40] But we have the greatest stewardship in
[48:43] all ages because we carry the revealed
[48:47] word.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; We carry the we are living in the hour
[48:51] where book of redemption has come down.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Therefore you can cry. You have the
[48:56] opportunity to give grace because
[48:59] redemption is in your hand. Not only in
[49:00] your hand you said take the book, eat
[49:02] the book.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; It's now within you.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS WORD IS WITHIN YOU. YOU'VE
[49:09] DIGESTED IT and it's now brought you
[49:12] into the image.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Now when the world looks at you, they
[49:16] look at the image. They look at Christ.
[49:18] Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; So basically in simple terms, it's
[49:24] managing God's gifts God's way and
[49:27] giving God the results. All glory must
[49:30] go to God. Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; So in everything that we do, God's name
[49:36] is glorified. When the gifts are managed
[49:38] correctly, when the what the challenge
[49:41] that God has given us are managed
[49:42] correctly, then who WILL BE GLORIFIED?
[49:44] GOD will be glorified. His name will be
[49:46] honored. Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; So there was if you look at Luke 16 1
[50:01] and 2, Jesus tells of the steward of
[50:03] misandalled the master's goods.
[50:06] He had to give an account.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; We know this is not just a story, a
[50:10] parable, but he's speaking about all the
[50:13] word that he's given us. He's speaking,
[50:14] it's a prophecy. Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Every man, woman, minister, no matter
[50:19] who we are, whatever part we got to play
[50:22] in the body, we have to give an account
[50:24] &gt;&gt; individually.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; The ministers will just preach the
[50:28] gospel. They have they have to give an
[50:30] account for what they preach for giving
[50:32] the word. But you have to give an
[50:34] account for what you received and what
[50:35] you're doing with it.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; You have to give an account individually
[50:39] of what you have done with the word that
[50:40] was given to you.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; The word that was preached to you. Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; So you find in our little testings, God
[50:50] is going to test our faithfulness. Amen.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; He's going to test our attitude.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; The attitude towards his word. Amen. How
[50:58] we are receiving his word. Sometime his
[51:00] word may be impressed upon us. Sometime
[51:02] his word will be a sharp rebuke. But
[51:04] what's our attitude towards it?
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes his word is coming to correct
[51:08] us.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; What is our attitude towards it?
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; He's going to test our consistency
[51:17] whether we are consistent.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:20] You know
[51:22] there's a story of a little boy
[51:26] how he had to go build something
[51:29] and uh he was a there was another old
[51:33] lady and they both had this thing where
[51:36] they said they have to build a certain
[51:38] thing but this boy thought I'm that's a
[51:41] old lady and I'm a small boy I got all
[51:42] the energy
[51:44] &gt;&gt; I can go and bully fast then what he did
[51:46] he began to become lazy
[51:48] &gt;&gt; he was a lazy boy
[51:50] &gt;&gt; and every day when he when his turn to
[51:52] go and get his billing done, what he'll
[51:54] do? He sleep. He said, "No, I got more
[51:56] time. I got more time."
[51:58] &gt;&gt; But this old lady, every day she go take
[52:00] one stone.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; One stone.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Every day. One stone at a time to build
[52:05] this building.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; And this boy said, "Don't worry, I still
[52:08] got time."
[52:11] &gt;&gt; And eventually it came when this lady
[52:13] built the building. And this boy got a
[52:15] shock because he just became so lazy and
[52:18] thought that he had time but time had
[52:20] finished.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; So one of these days when you think
[52:23] you're still young, you still got time.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Before you know it, YOU ARE AGED.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; YOU PASSED AGE, a certain age
[52:32] &gt;&gt; and you haven't done nothing for the
[52:33] Lord as yet.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, help us Lord.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU START RIGHT NOW?
[52:38] &gt;&gt; DON'T WAIT FOR TOMORROW.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Don't try to do big things. TRY WITH THE
[52:42] SMALL THINGS. YES. AMEN.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Start by reading. If you can't read the
[52:45] Bible, if you're such a lazy person,
[52:47] read one scripture.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; If you're such a lazy person to pray,
[52:51] start thanking the Lord.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Start with those little things.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; But be consistent in it.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Just be consistent and you'll see every
[53:03] day from that 5 minute prayer to a
[53:06] 10-minute prayer. From one verse to the
[53:08] whole chapter. Amen. And it's going to
[53:10] progress from one chapter to one book.
[53:12] Amen. From a 10-minute prayer to a
[53:14] 1-hour prayer, you're going to progress
[53:17] slowly and gradually. And from a 1 hour
[53:19] prayer, you'll be praying consistently
[53:21] throughout the day in your praise, in
[53:23] your worship to the Lord.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; And before you know it, you'll be
[53:26] quoting scriptures in your prayer.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; But what you are reading, you're going
[53:29] to be start quoting it out now.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying, be consistent.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Don't try to say I got all the time and
[53:39] I'll just do big things for the Lord.
[53:41] Start with the little things.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Be faithful in the little things. Show
[53:45] consistency in the little things
[53:48] and then you will progress to greater
[53:50] things. Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; God is also going to test our obedience
[53:55] to his word. Obedience is better than
[53:57] sacrifice.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; People instead of being obedient
[54:02] following the word of God, they want to
[54:04] now rather sacrifice later. Lord, I'm so
[54:07] sorry. Lord, I should have followed your
[54:08] word. I should have listened to what the
[54:10] minister said. I should have listened
[54:11] and made the right choice, Lord. They
[54:14] don't want to be obedient. But obedience
[54:17] is better than sacrifice.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; God is going to test how we manage time.
[54:23] Amen. He's going to test all things.
[54:26] He's going to test how we handle money.
[54:28] We all want to be blessed with money. We
[54:30] all need finances. But God is going to
[54:32] test how we handle money. How we handle
[54:35] finances. Are we using it for the Is our
[54:38] intention to use it for the right
[54:40] reason? Is our intention kingdom minded?
[54:44] God is going to test our commitment to
[54:47] prayer. He's going to test our
[54:49] commitment to fellowship.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Do not forsake the assembling of the
[54:52] saints
[54:53] &gt;&gt; as they see the day fast profile fast
[54:56] approaching.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the day is fast approaching
[54:59] and yet the people don't want to
[55:01] assemble with the saints.
[55:04] So little responsibilities
[55:06] maybe the pastor will give you a small
[55:08] task to do. It might be a small
[55:10] responsibility but be faithful in it.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; By that small responsibility
[55:16] God will God will show the pastor this
[55:19] person now been a good steward. This
[55:21] person has been faithful. This person
[55:22] can handle something greater now.
[55:26] So before God gives you more he watches
[55:28] how you handle less.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] So God tries us with little things
[55:34] first. Now Luke 16:11 speaks about he
[55:37] says if you have not been faithful in
[55:38] the unrighteous mammon who will commit
[55:42] to you the trust who will trust who will
[55:46] commit to you the trust the true riches.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; So you have not been faithful in the
[55:51] unrighteous mammon that means with the
[55:54] temporal things
[55:56] &gt;&gt; because what is mammon? The word memon
[55:58] come from an old Arabic term. It meaning
[56:02] wealth, riches or material possessions.
[56:06] But more than money, memon represents
[56:08] trust in earthly resources
[56:11] &gt;&gt; instead of God. Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; So you you couldn't even now when
[56:16] earthly resources are given to you,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; you can't be trusted with those things.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; You given money, you can't you can't be
[56:23] trusted with it
[56:25] &gt;&gt; because that is temporal things. Yes.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; But you can't be trusted with it. But
[56:29] now you're asking God for greater
[56:31] things.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; So memory is not just money. Memory is a
[56:35] spirit behind money
[56:37] &gt;&gt; that wants to take the place of God.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; So that is why I'm saying if you want to
[56:42] be before you ask for God for abundant
[56:44] blessing and to increase your finances
[56:46] to give you more wealth, can you handle
[56:48] it if he gives it to you?
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Can he handle it?
[56:54] Because would it change you? Would he
[56:57] change your attitude to the things of
[56:58] God? Would he take you away from the
[57:00] things of God? Oh, it'll make you exalt
[57:03] God more. Would it make you glorify God
[57:05] more and make you be a blessing in his
[57:08] kingdom? Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; So Jesus speaks of unrighteous member
[57:14] not because money itself is evil but
[57:16] because the spirit attached to money,
[57:18] what he can do? He can corrupt a heart.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; That is not anchored in the word. Amen.
[57:24] Someone does not anchor in the word, he
[57:25] can corrupt a man. He can take him away
[57:27] from the things of God. M will tell you
[57:31] depend on me.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; But what the word tells you, he is
[57:37] Jehovah Gyra or provider.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; So in other words, when you go to
[57:42] temporary riches, you want to depend. If
[57:44] you are dependent on your bank account,
[57:46] if you are dependent on your worldly
[57:47] wealth, you're dependent on your
[57:49] financial security or the secure job
[57:51] that you have and not dependent on God,
[57:53] God can take everything away.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz God is interested in YOUR SOUL.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; YOUR SOUL IS WORTH MORE THAN 10,000
[58:01] WORDS.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; NOW, me says security is what you have.
[58:12] God says security of who you belong to.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Now we know that is temporal. Now God
[58:21] has already blessed us with all
[58:22] spiritual blessings. Amen.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; So we know that mammon competes for
[58:28] trust, loyalty, and faithfulness.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Now God don't need to compete with that.
[58:33] He's already come to pay the price.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; He's already come to do the work.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And he knows that all that belongs TO
[58:39] HIM WILL COME TO HIM. YES. AMEN.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said you cannot serve
[58:43] God and mammon.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; You can have money but you must never
[58:46] let money have you.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Don't let it have a control over you.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; But the money must be used wisely.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; It must be used over the wisdom of God.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; A word being kingdom minded. Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; What is true ritual? True rituals. We
[59:03] already have that.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; We have the revelation of the word.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; We have the anointed words. Yes. Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; We have discernment in this hour.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; We have given spiritual authority.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; We are given influence. Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Over every demon spirit.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Over every spirit on the earth.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; We have this spiritual authority.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; And we have the opportunity to influence
[59:29] the entire world
[59:30] &gt;&gt; to have an impact. Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; We understand the mysteries of the
[59:34] kingdom.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; We know that the life of Christ is in
[59:37] us. Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; That is our true riches. Amen.
[59:42] Now God will never give these to unfaith
[59:45] to an unfaithful person. So God couldn't
[59:48] entrust this world with anybody.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; That is why this word couldn't come
[59:54] through from a denomination.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; This word God when he trust his word, it
[1:00:01] only come it only could come through
[1:00:02] virgin womb.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Because he's an unadulterated word.
[1:00:07] Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; It's not mixed with any creeds. It's not
[1:00:09] mixed with any dogmas.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; It's a pure words.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why God had to select a
[1:00:16] prophet
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; out
[1:00:19] out of the denominations. Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And take him out and give him his word.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And that is why you and I when God gave
[1:00:26] us the word, HE HAD TO CALL US OUT
[1:00:28] FIRST.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; FIRST, he had to call us out.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. to give us this word because this
[1:00:34] word couldn't be fed from denomination.
[1:00:40] Amen.
[1:00:46] Now in 1612 said if you have not if you
[1:00:49] have not been faithful in that which is
[1:00:50] another man's who shall give you that
[1:00:53] which is your own.
[1:00:57] So if you're not faithful in your
[1:00:58] earthly things, how are you going to
[1:01:01] have if God is entrusting you given you
[1:01:03] a job for example, you're not faithful
[1:01:05] with that, how is going to make you
[1:01:07] progress to the next level?
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:13] Now we know in the Bible it speaks about
[1:01:15] Joseph. Now we know he passed the tests.
[1:01:18] David passed the test. Elijah passed the
[1:01:20] test. Abraham passed the tests. Moses
[1:01:24] passed the test.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] Looks Jesus said you cannot serve two
[1:01:29] masters. Your stewardship will reveal
[1:01:32] whom you serve.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Whether you serve God or mammon.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Whether you serve God's will or your own
[1:01:38] will.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said you cannot serve both.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:44] We turn our Bibles to Matthew 25.
[1:01:49] For the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[1:01:51] traveling into a far country, who called
[1:01:53] his own servants, and delivered them
[1:01:55] unto them his own goods.
[1:01:59] And unto one he gave five challenge, to
[1:02:01] another two, and to another one. To
[1:02:03] every man according to his several
[1:02:04] ability. So each one had a different
[1:02:07] ability, right? And straightway took his
[1:02:10] journey. Then he had he that had
[1:02:13] received the five talents went and
[1:02:15] traded with the same and made them other
[1:02:17] five talents. And likewise he that had
[1:02:19] received the two he also gained other
[1:02:22] two. But he that had received one went
[1:02:25] and digged in the earth and his lords
[1:02:27] and hid his lord's money. After a long
[1:02:29] time the lord of the servants cometh and
[1:02:31] reckon it with them with them. And so he
[1:02:33] that receiveth five talents came and
[1:02:35] brought brought other five talents. He
[1:02:38] multiplied it. Amen. saying, "Lord, thou
[1:02:40] deliverest unto me five talents."
[1:02:42] Behold, I've gained beside them five
[1:02:44] talents more. His lord said unto him,
[1:02:46] "Well done, thou good and faithful
[1:02:47] servant. Thou has been faithful over a
[1:02:49] few things. I will make thee rule over
[1:02:51] many things. Enter thou into the joy of
[1:02:54] thy lord." He also that had received two
[1:02:56] talents came and said, Lord, thou delst
[1:02:59] unto me two talents. Behold, I've
[1:03:02] gained two other talents beside them.
[1:03:04] His lord said unto him, Well done, good
[1:03:06] and faithful servant. Thou has been
[1:03:08] faithful over a few things. I will make
[1:03:10] thee ruler over many things. Enter thou
[1:03:12] into the joy of thy lord. Then he to
[1:03:16] receive the one talent. Came and said,
[1:03:18] Lord,
[1:03:20] you see the one talent. Lord, why those
[1:03:24] people must minister? Why those people
[1:03:26] must have a big church? Why those people
[1:03:28] must be a better skilled musician? But
[1:03:31] the one talent that you given, you
[1:03:33] haven't harnessed it.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; You haven't put it to use.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; You're complaining about someone else
[1:03:38] preaching. You're somebody else
[1:03:40] complaining about someone else
[1:03:41] progressing in ministry. But what have
[1:03:43] you done with what God has given you?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; God has given you. Maybe he made you to
[1:03:50] be a witness, but you wouldn't be a
[1:03:51] witness.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; He gave you a time to exalt, but you
[1:03:54] wouldn't exalt.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Because why?
[1:03:58] You have been unfaithful in what he's
[1:04:00] given you. Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; But now you want to compare your
[1:04:03] complain about the other people that
[1:04:05] being blessed. Then who had received one
[1:04:06] chal said, Lord, I knew thee that thou
[1:04:08] art man reaping where thou has not sown
[1:04:11] and gathering where thou has not stroed.
[1:04:13] And I was afraid and went and hid thy
[1:04:14] challenge in the earth. Lo there thou as
[1:04:17] that is dying. His lord answered and
[1:04:19] said unto him, thou wicked and slotful
[1:04:22] servant.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Thou kneest that I reap where I sow not,
[1:04:25] and gather where I've not saw. The
[1:04:27] oughtters therefore to have put my money
[1:04:29] to the exchanges and there at my coming
[1:04:33] I should have received my own with Yer.
[1:04:36] They take therefore the talent from him
[1:04:39] and give it unto him which had 10
[1:04:41] talents.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; So the one that's being blessed is going
[1:04:44] to be be blessed more now because
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; even taking from them now that even had.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; For unto everyone that had shall be
[1:04:51] given and he shall have abundance. Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; So the one that's multiplying in the
[1:04:57] things that God has given him is going
[1:04:58] to have abundance.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; But from him that has not shall be taken
[1:05:03] away even that which he had and cast ye
[1:05:06] the unprofitable servant unto outer
[1:05:08] darkness. There shall be weeping and
[1:05:10] nashing of teeth. Trust me this God is
[1:05:13] working in kingdom principle.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; This is the kingdom of God. God don't
[1:05:18] run his kingdom like a country with a
[1:05:20] democracy.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; YES. GOD HAS GIVEN TASK TO everyone
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; and he wants YOU TO BE PROFITABLE INTO
[1:05:27] HIS KINGDOM.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; You cannot run a company and have
[1:05:31] somebody an employee who is not
[1:05:33] profitable to your company. That's
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; He's a liability to you.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; He's not an asset to you. Now, God has
[1:05:39] entrusted us with certain certain
[1:05:42] talents because why? He wants us to be
[1:05:45] assets in his kingdom.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS US TO GO FORTH, PREACH THE
[1:05:50] GOSPEL TO MULTIPLY. AMEN.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE THIS WORD FORTH, THIS WORD OF
[1:05:55] HOPE THAT WE HAVE, this blessed
[1:05:57] assurance.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; But some people are like like liability
[1:06:02] in the kingdom of God.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are a bad example to the
[1:06:09] gospel.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; When people look at them and they are so
[1:06:12] negative all the time and they now
[1:06:14] imagine them carrying it. They notice
[1:06:16] people believe the message of the hour,
[1:06:17] but everything when they when they're
[1:06:18] around their families, when they're
[1:06:20] around their friends, when they're
[1:06:21] around the neighbors, they always
[1:06:22] negative,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; never talking about God, always
[1:06:26] complaining, always grumbling.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Are they profitable to the kingdom?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So, every person receives something. You
[1:06:38] see, God has given everyone something.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; No matter what what God has given you,
[1:06:43] you have something. Amen. So God gives
[1:06:45] us abilities, several abilities. He
[1:06:47] gives gifts. He give us revelation of
[1:06:49] his word. He's given us different
[1:06:51] testimony. Every one of us got a
[1:06:52] testimony.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So no one is empty-handed. No one
[1:06:56] is for excuse.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; So you find that in Matthew 25:16 and 17
[1:07:03] speaks about the two faithful servants.
[1:07:05] They multiplied what they were given.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; So faithful is faithfulness is not about
[1:07:10] the size of your talent. It's about what
[1:07:12] you do with it.
[1:07:14] Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; But what did the unfaithful servant in
[1:07:17] Matthew 25:18 do? He buried the talent.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; SO MANY BELIEVERS BURY THE TESTIMONY.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; THEY BURY THE CALLING.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; THEY BURY THE PRAYER LIFE.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; THEY PRAY BURY THE GIFTS THAT GOD HAS
[1:07:32] GIVEN UNTO THEM.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; They bury the revelation.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Because why? When God has revealed
[1:07:39] something, they won't go and share it
[1:07:40] out. They wouldn't speak about it. and
[1:07:43] they BURY THEIR OPPORTUNITIES. GOD
[1:07:45] PRESENTS opportunities to them. Your
[1:07:47] family member is sick. Your loved one is
[1:07:49] sick. You have a case to go to the
[1:07:51] hospital and pray for somebody. You lose
[1:07:53] that opportunity.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody brings up a topic at work about
[1:07:56] God, you you lose that opportunity. You
[1:07:58] shy away.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Opportunities at your doorstep.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; So what that do? Fear makes people bury
[1:08:06] what God gave.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says perfect love cast out
[1:08:11] all fear.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; So after a long time the Lord cometh and
[1:08:17] reckon it to them. So every talent comes
[1:08:19] with a reckoning. We must give an
[1:08:20] account. Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Every talent we must give an account
[1:08:24] for.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; But there's a reward. Well done good and
[1:08:28] faithful servant.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Reward is based on faithfulness.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Not giftedness. Amen.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:38] So the but there's also a judgment for
[1:08:40] the unfaithfulness. Cast the
[1:08:42] unprofitable servant into outer
[1:08:44] darkness.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So some will be out in out in
[1:08:48] spiritual danger in this hour.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in Matthew 6:33, "But
[1:08:54] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:08:59] righteousness."
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; AND ALL these things shall be added unto
[1:09:03] you.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So as true steward lives with
[1:09:05] God's first priorities
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; because why seek seek his kingdom first
[1:09:11] what what it means seek his will his
[1:09:14] purpose his word his righteousness his
[1:09:17] leadership
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; amen then all these things what all
[1:09:21] these things shall be added to us the
[1:09:22] things that you want
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; God has adds opportunities to you he
[1:09:27] adds favor to you he adds resources to
[1:09:29] you he opens doors where no man could
[1:09:31] shut
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; amen Amen. He brings all these things to
[1:09:35] you,
[1:09:37] but he will not increase you spiritually
[1:09:39] until you put God first in your life.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Because a steward, a good steward, he
[1:09:46] has a kingdom vision.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; His decisions are revolve around Christ.
[1:09:51] Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; If you look in the Bible, we look at the
[1:09:54] life of Joseph and uh just I can see
[1:09:57] time is gone. I'm just going to go
[1:09:58] through quickly. The life of Joseph when
[1:10:01] he was in Portifer's house in Genesis 39
[1:10:03] 1-6 quickly I'll read that uh and Joseph
[1:10:06] was brought down to Egypt and Portifer
[1:10:09] an officer of Pharaoh captain of the
[1:10:11] guard in Egyptian bought him of the
[1:10:13] hands bought him of the hands of the
[1:10:15] Ishelites which had brought him down
[1:10:17] thther and the Lord was with Joseph and
[1:10:20] he was a prosperous man
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; and he was in the house of his master
[1:10:24] the Egyptian
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; and his master saw that the Lord was
[1:10:28] with him and The Lord made all that he
[1:10:30] did to prosper in his hand.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And Joseph found grace in his sight, and
[1:10:34] he served him. And he made him overseer
[1:10:36] over his house, and all that he had put
[1:10:38] in his high hand. And it came to pass
[1:10:41] from the time that he had made him
[1:10:42] overseer in his house, and over all that
[1:10:44] he had that the Lord blessed the
[1:10:46] Egyptians house for Joseph's sake.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Your company is going to be blessed.
[1:10:51] Yes.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; For your sake.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Your family is going to BE BLESSED FOR
[1:10:56] YOUR SAKE.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WONDERFUL.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; And the blessing of the Lord was upon
[1:11:00] all that he had in the house
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; and in the fields.
[1:11:05] And he left all that he had in Joseph's
[1:11:08] hand, and he knew not he had saved the
[1:11:11] bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a
[1:11:13] goodly person. So you see, he managed
[1:11:16] another man's house. Didn't Jesus speak
[1:11:19] about this in Luke? Another man's
[1:11:21] wealth. You can't handle another man's
[1:11:23] things. But Joseph, he managed another
[1:11:25] man's house.
[1:11:27] But for entrusted everything to him
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; AND JOSEPH INCREASED THE HOUSE.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; When he managed his house, there was an
[1:11:35] increase in that house.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; And he lived in that house with
[1:11:39] integrity.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; He kept the he kept the word of he knew
[1:11:43] the prophecy. He kept the dreams that he
[1:11:45] had. Amen. He kept the vision. Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; So what Luke was saying, if you're not
[1:11:52] being faithful in that which is another
[1:11:54] man, who shall give you that which is in
[1:11:56] your own? But look at Joseph now. He's
[1:11:58] keeping another man's house.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; But in that other man's house, he's
[1:12:01] being blessed.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; He's being prosperous. Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; But then Joseph goes through his
[1:12:06] testings. Amen. He continue his
[1:12:09] testings. So what that was his
[1:12:11] stewardship test. Then he goes into
[1:12:12] prison. We know what happens there.
[1:12:13] about the false witness of Portifer's
[1:12:16] wife ends up Joseph ends up in prison
[1:12:19] but God is now only taking him now to
[1:12:22] mold his character he's taking him to
[1:12:24] his training ground amen because now
[1:12:26] he's going to bring him to higher
[1:12:27] heights amen
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; and in prison we sing in verses 23 39
[1:12:32] chapter 39 verse 20 and 23 and Joseph's
[1:12:35] master took him and put him into the
[1:12:38] prison a place where the king's
[1:12:41] prisoners were bound and he was there in
[1:12:43] the prison prison. But the Lord was with
[1:12:45] Joseph
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; and showed him mercy and gave him favor.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; In the sight of the keeper of the
[1:12:52] prison.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; So even in prison, Joseph had favor.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; NOTHING. NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE,
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT circumstance you may be,
[1:13:03] YOU CAN HAVE GOD'S FAVOR UPON YOU.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the keeper of the prison
[1:13:08] committed to Joseph and all the
[1:13:10] prisoners that were in the prison. And
[1:13:13] whatsoever they did there, he was the
[1:13:15] doer of it.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; You see a child of God when he's there
[1:13:19] walking in vision, walking with the
[1:13:20] vision in mind. Amen. Walking with the
[1:13:23] prophecy in mind. Wherever you're going
[1:13:25] to be is going to be blessed. Divine
[1:13:27] favor is going to be with you all all
[1:13:29] the way. Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then verse 23, the keeper of the
[1:13:32] prison looked not to anything that was
[1:13:35] under his hand because the Lord was with
[1:13:37] him and that which he did, the Lord made
[1:13:40] it to prosper. Amen. So even Joseph was
[1:13:44] falsely accused, but he served
[1:13:46] faithfully.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; And we know he still remained humble. He
[1:13:50] still kept his gift and he didn't come
[1:13:52] bitter. And because he didn't come
[1:13:55] bitter, because he was still humble,
[1:13:57] he's now going to end up using that gift
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; for the better good. Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; So what his faithfulness in adversity,
[1:14:05] what did it do? It produced his
[1:14:07] character
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; that's going to take him to his destiny.
[1:14:10] Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find now in verses Genesis
[1:14:14] 41 38-44 there it speaks about Joseph in
[1:14:18] the palace and Pharaoh said unto his
[1:14:20] servants can we find such a one as this
[1:14:24] is a man in whom the spirit of God is
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; AND PHARAOH SAID UNTO JOSEPH, for as
[1:14:31] much as God had showed thee all this,
[1:14:34] there is none so discreet and wise at
[1:14:37] thou art. Thou shalt be ruler over my
[1:14:41] house, and according unto thy word shall
[1:14:45] all my people be ruled. In other words,
[1:14:47] he's going to set the law in order. He's
[1:14:49] going to bring the word. Thou shall
[1:14:52] prophesy again of foundations and
[1:14:53] tongue. THIS BRIDE SHALL BECOME THE
[1:14:55] FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. AMEN.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Only in the throne will I be greater
[1:15:02] than you.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; So in other words, he is the headstone.
[1:15:05] We're the body. Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll be the final voice in the
[1:15:09] final age. Amen. The only person that
[1:15:11] higher than us is the head which is
[1:15:13] Christ. Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, see I have
[1:15:20] said thee over all the land of Egypt.
[1:15:23] And Pharaoh took off his ring from his
[1:15:25] hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and
[1:15:27] arrayed him in vestues of fine linen and
[1:15:29] put a gold chain upon his neck. And he
[1:15:31] made him to ride in the second chariot
[1:15:33] which he had. And they cried before him,
[1:15:35] bow the knee. and he made him rule over
[1:15:37] all the land of Egypt. We know that I
[1:15:39] was typing Jesus, but he's also typing
[1:15:41] the bride when she's going to rule and
[1:15:43] reign with him. Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; So now God could trust Joseph with the
[1:15:48] economy of Egypt.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? Joseph was kept to
[1:15:56] preserve life.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; He was
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; When God gave him the wisdom that he
[1:16:01] could in the time of plenty, he could
[1:16:03] tell him to build the store houses. Yes.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; To store up the food. Because why? IN
[1:16:08] THE TIME OF FAMINE from the storehouse
[1:16:11] there was going to be food given. Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Because why?
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; The lineage.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THERE WAS A LINEAGE that had to be
[1:16:19] preserved.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The very lineage that put him in the in
[1:16:23] the pit and sold him to the for slavery.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; That image, that lineage had to be
[1:16:28] preserved
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; because from there come the patriarchs,
[1:16:32] come the prophets, come the lineage of
[1:16:34] Christ. Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Come the come the the priesthood and so
[1:16:38] forth.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; That lineage had to be preserved. But
[1:16:42] watch Joseph is now in authority. He was
[1:16:45] kept there to preserve life.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; At one stage YOU WERE RECEIVED THE
[1:16:50] MESSAGE. YOU STARTED SPEAKING ABOUT THE
[1:16:51] VISION THAT YOU GOT. YOU started
[1:16:53] speaking about I'm going to go in the
[1:16:55] rapture. You started telling all your
[1:16:56] families, all your friends, I'm going to
[1:16:59] the rapture. I'm going to have a body
[1:17:01] change. I'm going to be the queen of
[1:17:03] heaven. What happened? They started to
[1:17:04] reject you. They started to be jealous
[1:17:06] of you. They started to be envious of
[1:17:08] your revelation. Those denominations and
[1:17:10] you started to get rejected from
[1:17:12] everyone.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; But you remain humble.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; You didn't hate them.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know why? Joseph knew
[1:17:20] the vision. He knew that he had to
[1:17:22] preserve lifes.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't hate his brethren.
[1:17:26] But look, watch in Genesis Genesis 45.
[1:17:29] It says, "Now therefore, be not grieved
[1:17:31] nor angry with yourself." is telling his
[1:17:33] brethren now that he sold me for God did
[1:17:36] send me before you to preserve life.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; They still conceal that sin.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; And now it was troubling THEM ALL HIS
[1:17:44] YEARS. NOW THAT SAME CONCEALED SIN now
[1:17:48] because they did it with hatred then
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; hatred towards Joseph
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; and they concealed that hatred and now
[1:17:55] they are still living fearfully
[1:17:58] but perfect love cast away all fear.
[1:18:01] Joseph now is casting away all their
[1:18:03] fear,
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; all their doubt, and he's telling them
[1:18:05] the prophecy now. It was done to
[1:18:07] preserve life.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; He's showing THEM THE FULFILLMENT OF THE
[1:18:12] PROPHECY.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT WAS DONE TO PRESERVE LIFE.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And you're going to SEE THE VERY
[1:18:18] FAMILIES that rejected you, the the
[1:18:20] people that rejected you for what you
[1:18:22] believe ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.
[1:18:25] OH, THEY'RE GOING to realize the
[1:18:27] prophecy is going to be fulfilled that
[1:18:29] it was done to preserve life because to
[1:18:31] him that given a glass of water to one
[1:18:33] of these my little one shall surely not
[1:18:36] lose their reward. Oh, your your mother
[1:18:39] that was not saved, that done something
[1:18:40] for you, that preserved you, that
[1:18:42] nurtured you, your family members that
[1:18:44] did something for you, that because it
[1:18:46] was carrying that lineage, Amen. was
[1:18:48] carrying that seed, it was done to
[1:18:50] preserve life. On the day of judgment,
[1:18:52] you going to be judging the earth. Don't
[1:18:54] you know the sin shall judge the earth
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; and on that day they're going to come
[1:18:59] they're going to be oh so they are I've
[1:19:01] rejected what this people told me I've
[1:19:03] rejected what they said but the little
[1:19:06] good that they did the little water they
[1:19:09] gave you the glass of water to one of
[1:19:11] these my little ones
[1:19:14] on the day of judgment
[1:19:16] life will be given
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; eternal life will be given to him
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; amen so Joseph was a type of Christ and
[1:19:24] by extension a type of us in the end
[1:19:27] times.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know Joseph his stewardship he
[1:19:32] proved his he was faithful in his
[1:19:34] stewardship.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The stores the stores at the time
[1:19:38] it fed the world in famine.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; And we have a word that will that was
[1:19:44] stored up for us in this season AND IT
[1:19:46] WILL FEED the world in spiritual famine.
[1:19:49] Yes.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; That's why Revelation 10 10:11 says,
[1:19:51] "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy
[1:19:53] again before nation before many people
[1:19:56] and nation and tongues and kings."
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And Matthew 21, last scripture, Matthew
[1:20:02] 21:16 says, "And about the 11th hour, he
[1:20:05] went out and found other standing idle,
[1:20:07] and said unto them, why stand thee all
[1:20:10] the day idle?" They say unto him,
[1:20:12] because no man had hired us. He said
[1:20:15] unto them, "Give ye also into the
[1:20:18] vineyard." Sorry, go ye also into the
[1:20:20] vineyard. And whatsoever is right, that
[1:20:23] shall ye receive. So when even was come,
[1:20:25] the Lord of the Bunny said unto his
[1:20:27] steward, Call the laborers, and give
[1:20:30] them their hire, beginning from the last
[1:20:32] until the first. And when they came,
[1:20:34] they were hired about the 11th hour.
[1:20:36] They received every man a penny. But
[1:20:38] when the first came, they supposed that
[1:20:40] they should have received more. And they
[1:20:42] likewise received even every man a
[1:20:45] penny. And when they had received it,
[1:20:47] they murmured against the good men of
[1:20:48] the house, saying, These last have
[1:20:51] wrought but one hour, and thou has made
[1:20:53] them equal unto us, which have borne the
[1:20:56] burden eat of the day. But he answered
[1:20:59] one of them, and said, friend, I do thee
[1:21:01] no wrong. Does not thou agree with me?
[1:21:03] for a penny. Take that is thine and go
[1:21:05] thy way. I will give unto this last even
[1:21:08] as unto thee. It is not is it not lawful
[1:21:11] for me to do what I will do with my own
[1:21:14] is thine. I evil because I am good. So
[1:21:17] that last shall be first and the first
[1:21:19] last for many will be called but few are
[1:21:22] chosen. So you see God is faithful. He
[1:21:25] is a faithful steward because he has
[1:21:27] given
[1:21:29] the people the same wages because he
[1:21:31] made an agreement with them. I'm giving
[1:21:33] you this and even when he has questioned
[1:21:35] even the 11th hour we have come now in
[1:21:37] the 11th hour it's a closing
[1:21:39] dispensation of this dispensation but we
[1:21:42] will be given the same amen
[1:21:47] so
[1:21:48] we are entrusted now with true riches.
[1:21:50] Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3 said that we are blessed
[1:21:54] with all spiritual blessings. Blessed be
[1:21:56] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:21:58] Christ who had blessed us with all
[1:22:00] spiritual blessings in heavenly places.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; So God is just shaping and molding and a
[1:22:06] character but we have to give an account
[1:22:09] of our stewardship. God bless you. Amen.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:19] the musicians.
[1:22:33] Let's stand our feet.
[1:22:54] Let me put up the song.
[1:23:16] Blessed assures
[1:23:22] is mine.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a foreign
[1:23:31] a glory divine
[1:23:37] hair of salvation.
[1:23:43] Virgin of God,
[1:23:48] born of his spirit,
[1:23:53] washed in his blood.
[1:23:58] And this is my story.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; And this is my song.
[1:24:09] I'm praising my savior
[1:24:14] in all the day long.
[1:24:19] And this is my story.
[1:24:24] And this is my song.
[1:24:30] Praising my savior
[1:24:35] all the day long.
[1:24:40] Perfect submission
[1:24:45] and perfect delight.
[1:24:51] Visions of rapure.
[1:24:56] I was on my side.
[1:25:01] An angel descending.
[1:25:06] Bring from above.
[1:25:12] Echo of mercy,
[1:25:17] whispers of love.
[1:25:22] This is my story.
[1:25:27] This is my song.
[1:25:32] I'm praising my savior.
[1:25:37] And all the day long.
[1:25:42] And this is my story.
[1:25:47] This is my song.
[1:25:52] Praising my Savior
[1:25:57] all the day long.
[1:26:01] Amen. We pray this morning.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; You say, Lord,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; maybe Lord, I know now, Lord, that I've
[1:26:11] given accounts for all that you have
[1:26:13] belotted unto me.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:26:15] But Lord, maybe I haven't been faithful.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Or Lord, maybe I wasted time. Lord,
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; I thought I've got enough time.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe Lord, I haven't had a consistent
[1:26:25] life.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Or I haven't been held accountable.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; But Father, this day,
[1:26:34] I want to be held accountable.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; I want to be consistent in my walk with
[1:26:39] you. Lord,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; I want to be a faithful steward of all
[1:26:43] that you entrusted me with. Say yes oh
[1:26:45] God.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Lord I want to look at the heavenly
[1:26:48] vision Lord.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Yes God
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; I want to look at the prophecy.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And know Lord that I'm the final part
[1:26:56] now before the we leave the earth. The
[1:27:00] final part lays with me. The final part
[1:27:02] of the prophecy before the rapture lays
[1:27:06] with me
[1:27:07] where all nature, all creation is
[1:27:09] groaning and waiting and surveilling
[1:27:12] for the manifestation of the son of God.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; We're going to pray this morning.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; No one looking around.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; You know your heart.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord has spoken to you this morning.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, God.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; You can make it right this morning.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Father, we come to you once
[1:27:31] again in the precious and holy name of
[1:27:32] Jesus.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; You have spoken to our hearts this
[1:27:35] morning. God,
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; we know the hour is late. Lord, time is
[1:27:39] fast spent.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; We don't want to spend our lives
[1:27:43] recklessly.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; We don't want to live loosely, oh God.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; We want to live our lives in line with
[1:27:48] your word.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; We want to live our lives knowing that
[1:27:51] we are doing something for your kingdom,
[1:27:53] Father. And we we want to live our lives
[1:27:55] where we're not just stagnant, Father.
[1:27:57] But we Lord, we want to measure our
[1:27:58] walk, measure our life along this
[1:28:00] journey. And Lord, knowing that there's
[1:28:02] progression along this walk, Father, we
[1:28:04] want to see a spiritual growth in our
[1:28:06] lives, Father. And we pray, Father, we
[1:28:08] know that we cannot do it on our own,
[1:28:10] Father. But Lord, we just want to be,
[1:28:12] Lord, lay ourselves in you, oh God,
[1:28:14] knowing that through you, we can do all
[1:28:16] things, Father. Oh, we know, Lord, the
[1:28:18] spirit of Christ is in us, Lord. You
[1:28:20] said in your word, greater is he that is
[1:28:22] in you than he that is in the world,
[1:28:25] Father. And through Christ Jesus, we can
[1:28:27] do all things, Father. And Lord, we pray
[1:28:29] for your children this morning, if
[1:28:31] they've taken heed to your word, Father.
[1:28:33] And I pray, Lord, that you now, Lord,
[1:28:35] you will they will, Lord, continue now,
[1:28:37] Lord, to want, Lord, to know more of to
[1:28:40] to to to do your will, oh God, and to
[1:28:43] fulfill your purpose in and through
[1:28:45] their lives, Father. I pray and ask it
[1:28:47] now in Jesus name.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. And we pray that you be
[1:28:52] blessed this morning. We hand a service
[1:28:54] now to God's servant pas.

[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did we learn this morning
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; how to handle the things of God?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; And if you paid attention, Amen. to the
[1:29:12] steward, he acted quickly.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; He was told he was his stewardship was
[1:29:18] going to be taken away. Yes.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; But he acted quickly.
[1:29:24] Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; So read that story again. He acted
[1:29:27] quickly. So here's what the spirit is
[1:29:29] saying. Act quickly.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's always room
[1:29:34] because the kingdom is run like a
[1:29:37] business.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And God is looking for return on
[1:29:41] investment. Any businessman know ROI.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Return on investment.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; So Jesus, if you're reading those
[1:29:49] stories, he's given about the
[1:29:50] stewardship. The man said, "Settle half
[1:29:53] at least.
[1:29:55] Let me show him I've got half at least."
[1:29:58] Amen. So act quickly. Salvage what you
[1:30:01] can
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; and show it back to the Lord
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; that his eye of favor will be turned to
[1:30:07] us. And then if also we got to look at
[1:30:10] the positive side. If we have been
[1:30:11] managing it properly,
[1:30:14] if we have been good stewards,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; then there's an increase coming because
[1:30:18] God can all lot more to us.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; It's not only the negative now. Amen.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Some people are handling it properly.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then God's going to attribute
[1:30:26] more for it. So we thank the Lord for
[1:30:28] that. And then also be consistent and
[1:30:31] persistent. Amen. Be consistent. Start
[1:30:33] to read your Bible and pray every day.
[1:30:35] That's how you keep the calls of your
[1:30:37] Bible.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Pray. Read your Bible every day. Amen.
[1:30:40] Let's sing. I'm pressing on the upward
[1:30:42] way. New heights I'm gaining every day.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, lift me up and let me stand. Amen.
[1:30:48] Do we have those words?

[1:34:02] plane
[1:34:04] than I have.

[1:34:13] ground.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; The Lord wants to take us to higher
[1:34:21] heights.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Greater depths of his spirit.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't want us to be stagnant.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He's coming to see
[1:34:29] what we have done with what he has
[1:34:30] given.

[1:34:43] in prayer. Amen. Even as we dismiss.
[1:34:46] Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Father in heaven, we come to you.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[1:35:13] you.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Everything that you've done,

[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you gave us something to look
[1:35:24] at.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, sometimes Lord, we are unreliable.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we are spotful.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes Lord, things that we shouldn't
[1:35:35] be doing.
