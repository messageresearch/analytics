[0:00] We anointed you with oil.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; And we prayed over you.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; So all of those things carry a
[0:09] significance and there's a blessing
[0:11] attached to it.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason why we did that is
[0:15] because the anointing breaks the yoke of
[0:17] the enemy.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; We were trying to awaken in you that
[0:20] there's an anointing in you that you're
[0:22] carrying right now.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; The oil is not on the outside.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; The oil is on the inside.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It has moved from natural light to
[0:31] to candle light and it has now become
[0:34] shakana glory light inside of us.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. This gospel has not been stagnant.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; The gospel has progressed. The gospel
[0:42] has moved.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh some of the brothers were
[0:45] just sharing with me. Amen. That they
[0:47] were blessed with last week's service.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were rejoicing.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they have a new vigor and a
[0:53] new Amen.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; faith for the year ahead.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; Bless you this morning
[1:01] &gt;&gt; and uh keep you as we go around the word
[1:03] of God and see what he has in store for
[1:06] us this morning.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I can't meet the need of
[1:10] everyone here. It's only the Holy Spirit
[1:12] that can.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; And the way you touch God is through
[1:16] faith.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; And the way you reach out by faith is to
[1:19] have an expectation.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; So if we have zero expectation, we're
[1:23] not going to get anything out of the
[1:24] service. But if our heart is full of
[1:27] expectancy, we're going to receive
[1:29] maximum benefit this morning.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, let's stand together for
[1:32] the reading of God's word.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Joshua chapter 1. Last
[1:38] week, we read a quote and we we were
[1:40] reading how God has new promises for
[1:43] each new year. Now, as we are reading
[1:45] this, bear in mind that there's a
[1:47] progression. When God is finished with
[1:49] one ministry, he continues
[1:51] &gt;&gt; his plan.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; God is a God of a plan. God is a God of
[1:55] a goal and we were created in his image
[1:57] and likeness.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; So we are people with a plan and we are
[2:00] people with a goal.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are people of dominion.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; So it says here Joshua 1:1. Now after
[2:07] the death of Moses,
[2:10] the Lord as the servant of the Lord, it
[2:13] came to pass that the Lord spake to
[2:14] Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister,
[2:18] saying,
[2:19] &gt;&gt; Moses, my servant is dead. Now therefore
[2:22] arise,
[2:24] go over this Jordan thou and all thy
[2:27] this people unto the land which I do
[2:30] give to them even to the children of
[2:32] Israel.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; So it's God who has a goal to move the
[2:35] people along.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; They may have wanted to mourn Moses'
[2:39] death. They may have wanted to
[2:41] denominate around Moses,
[2:43] &gt;&gt; but God is now going to bring them into
[2:45] the land that he had promised them.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48] And watch when God has a goal and a
[2:51] vision in mind for your life, he is
[2:53] already attaching a promise. And he
[2:56] says, "Every place that the soul of your
[2:58] foot shall tread upon,
[3:00] &gt;&gt; that have I given unto you,
[3:02] &gt;&gt; as I said unto Moses,
[3:05] &gt;&gt; you
[3:06] &gt;&gt; God told brother Brandham, there's going
[3:08] to be a super church, a super race." As
[3:10] he told the prophet, he says, "I'm going
[3:12] to give it to you. I'm going to make you
[3:14] that super church, the super race. I'm
[3:15] going to make you that invincible army.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he marks out his borders and
[3:22] his boundaries from the wilderness and
[3:24] this Lebanon unto the great river, the
[3:25] river Euphrates, the land of the Itites,
[3:28] even the great sea towards the going
[3:29] down of the sun shall be your coast.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; There shall not any man be able to stand
[3:34] before thee all the days of thy life.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses,
[3:40] &gt;&gt; as I was with brother Brandham,
[3:42] &gt;&gt; so I will be with thee. I will not fail
[3:45] thee.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Nor forsake thee.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Be strong and of a good courage. For
[3:50] unto this people shalt thou divide for
[3:53] an inheritance the land,
[3:55] &gt;&gt; our inheritance is the Holy Ghost.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Which I swear unto their fathers should
[4:00] give them.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Only be thou strong,
[4:03] &gt;&gt; be and very courageous, that thou mayest
[4:06] to observe to do according to all the
[4:08] law which my servant Moses commanded
[4:10] thee. Turn not to it from the right hand
[4:13] or the left, that thou mayest prosper
[4:16] whethersoever thou goest.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Now, notice the prosperity is going to
[4:22] come because we are in the land.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; That's what the Lord is telling Joshua.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; But you've got to put your foot.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "Everywhere you place your
[4:30] foot,
[4:31] &gt;&gt; you're going to prosper."
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; So if Joshua stayed still, not moving
[4:35] his foot,
[4:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wouldn't have walked and marked
[4:41] out his prosperity.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; You got to move your feet and start to
[4:44] march forward.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the key here. The book of
[4:49] the Lord shall not depart out of thy
[4:50] mouth,
[4:51] &gt;&gt; the age of the spoken word.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; But thou shalt meditate therein day and
[4:55] night. Why? In order to speak the word,
[4:57] you got to know the word.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; In order to know the word, you must
[5:00] meditate on the word.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; That thou mayest observe to do according
[5:04] to all that is written therein. Then
[5:06] thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and
[5:09] then thou shalt have good success. Have
[5:11] not I commanded thee? Be strong and have
[5:13] a good courage. Be not afraid, neither
[5:16] be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God
[5:18] is with thee. I'll say now he's in thee.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Whethersoever thou goest. Praise the
[5:23] Lord. The Lord had blessings reading of
[5:24] his word. Before you are seated, one
[5:26] more portion of scripture in Habacook
[5:28] chapter 2. Praise the Lord. Verse two.
[5:34] And the Lord answered me and said,
[5:37] "Write the vision. Make it plain upon
[5:40] tables,
[5:42] that he may run that readeth it. For the
[5:45] vision is yet for an appointed time, but
[5:47] at the end it shall speak and not lie.
[5:50] Though it tar, wait for it."
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; Wait, because it will surely come, it
[5:57] will not tarry.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; The Lord had blessings to reading of his
[5:59] word. You may be seated. Hallelujah. So
[6:02] I'm speaking on visions this morning.
[6:05] Your goals
[6:07] and faith in the word. So your visions
[6:10] and your choices in this life now are
[6:11] going to be guided by the word.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Has to be guided by the word.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Because the word is wisdom.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; You know the beginning of the year we
[6:23] have lots of goals.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Lots of things we want to achieve.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. But very few people by the second
[6:30] or third week those things are gone
[6:33] away. They cast it away and they settle
[6:35] into the old routine of life. But in
[6:37] order to be able to achieve what we need
[6:40] to achieve, we've got to be persistent.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Even here in Abacook, the Lord is
[6:48] telling him, "Write the vision because
[6:50] you're going to forget about it."
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; But write it and put it somewhere where
[6:54] you can see it.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. M
[6:57] &gt;&gt; bring it to your memory all the time.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; And not only to your memory, whoever is
[7:02] going to read the vision may understand
[7:03] it clearly.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Your parents can understand what your
[7:07] goals are, what your vision is. Everyone
[7:10] who's reading it will understand it.
[7:14] And he says, "WAIT FOR IT." THOUGH IT
[7:16] TAR, wait for it.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:22] So God has a unique design for each one
[7:25] of our lives.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; God is not building RDP houses. We all
[7:31] look the same.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; You know what RDP houses are?
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Lowcost housing.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; No, you are not a lowcost housing.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; You are the tabernacle, the temple of
[7:48] the living God.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; You are a mansion.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; That is fully furnished.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes I may step away from the
[8:04] notes, but I just want to speak as the
[8:05] spirit leads.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; Your mansion fully furnished.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; And your furnishing is from faith to
[8:12] charity.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS A FULLY FURNISHED HOUSE, A
[8:17] MANSION.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; YES. that he is now dwelling in.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're in lack of nothing.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We go TO THE LIVING
[8:28] ROOM, IT'S FULLY FURNISHED.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; WE GO TO THE BEDROOM, IT'S FULLY
[8:31] FURNISHED.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; WE GO TO THE KITCHEN, IT'S FULLY
[8:33] FURNISHED.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS NOT LEFT THIS church
[8:36] unfernished.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has a fully furnished
[8:40] mansion and he's given it US THROUGH THE
[8:42] OPENING OF THE WORD.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[8:46] the Lord.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So the design for each one
[8:50] of our lives defer.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; We don't measure our life based on
[8:54] somebody else.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; If God is blessing them, praise the Lord
[8:56] for them.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; But God is working ON ME.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS A plan for me.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; I know the plans I have for you. Say the
[9:04] Lord.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Plans to prosper you and not to harm
[9:06] you.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Plans to give you a hope and a future.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are unique. The Bible says we
[9:12] are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:18] Now, we can't base our lives on somebody
[9:20] else like I was saying because God may
[9:22] have designed your life to reach one
[9:24] soul,
[9:25] &gt;&gt; but he may have designed the next life
[9:26] to reach millions of souls. That's
[9:28] right.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; But as long AS WE FULFILL OUR PURPOSE,
[9:30] IF GOD'S purpose designed is to reach
[9:32] one soul for Christ
[9:34] &gt;&gt; and we achieve that, THEN WE HAVE
[9:35] FULFILLED OUR PURPOSE IN LIFE.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; But if God has designed us for to reach
[9:40] 10,000 souls, we must also achieve that
[9:43] purpose in life.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[9:46] Praise the Lord. So when we are starting
[9:49] to have goals and visions, we've got to
[9:51] see it in the mind's eye first.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; It's got to be seen and envisioned in
[9:59] the mind's eye
[10:00] &gt;&gt; before it can start to manifest in the
[10:02] reality.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; SO EVERY DETAIL, YOU'VE GOT TO THINK IT
[10:06] IN THE MIND'S eye first.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; Don't just speak things and not give the
[10:14] detail. Right?
[10:15] &gt;&gt; God didn't speak things in Genesis and
[10:16] not give the detail.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody agree?
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; If you're trusting the Lord for a wife
[10:24] for a husband, WELL, TELL HIM WHAT KIND
[10:26] OF A WIFE YOU WANT. WHAT KIND of a
[10:28] husband you want?
[10:30] &gt;&gt; A God-fearing husband.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; A God-fearing wife.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Describe them.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:41] be specific about what we are asking the
[10:43] LORD FOR.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS VERY SPECIFIC IN GENESIS 1.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; YES.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; And when we come to verse 26, he says,
[10:50] "I'm going to create a man IN MY IMAGE
[10:51] WHO'S ALSO GOING TO BE VERY SPECIFIC
[10:53] ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT."
[10:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; ABOUT THEIR GOALS AND THEIR PURPOSES.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; Now, by now, we ought to be mature sons
[11:01] and daughters of God.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; We are not now where God is restoring
[11:06] the church through justification. Yeah,
[11:09] &gt;&gt; we are past that.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are mature sons and
[11:14] daughters OF GOD WHERE GOD can have
[11:16] confidence in us.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; God can say, "THIS IS MY BELOVED SON.
[11:21] THIS IS MY BELOVED daughter in whom I am
[11:23] well pleased to dwell in."
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Because God wants to fulfill his plan
[11:28] through our lives.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; We have complete confidence knowing that
[11:34] God's word cannot fail.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; We must set the word of God at our
[11:40] forefront in 2026.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; We have got to be guided BY THE WORD OF
[11:44] GOD.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE FAITH IN THE WORD OF
[11:46] GOD THAT IT WILL NEVER FAIL.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [clears throat]
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now, we we are we are
[11:54] conscious of the harmony that exists
[11:56] between the father and me.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; The father and you. You've got to be
[12:00] conscious of the harmony that's existing
[12:02] between you and God.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:07] Amen. The harmony THAT GOD CAN DWELL IN
[12:09] US. A people called and chosen for his
[12:12] name. A people in whom he can have the
[12:14] preeminence. A people who can give God
[12:17] first place in everything. And who puts
[12:19] GOD FIRST IN EVERY DECISION.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; Christ is in the forefront of OUR
[12:24] THOUGHTS. THE WORD is in the forefront
[12:26] of our our being, our soul.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our thoughts and actions are not
[12:30] shaped and governed by the world.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The world doesn't set the standard
[12:34] for us.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; We don't FASHION OURSELVES AFTER THE
[12:38] WORLD.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; We don't dress like the world.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; We don't act like the world.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; We are from another kingdom.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; We are citizens of another kingdom. And
[12:46] we ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF THAT KINGDOM.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; AND IN OUR KINGDOM, THERE IS THE HIGHEST
[12:51] AUTHORITY. IN OUR KINGDOM IS THE HIGHEST
[12:54] POWER. IN OUR KINGDOM, THERE'S THE
[12:56] HIGHEST AUTHORITY THAT REST IN YOU AND
[12:58] I.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see what's happening in the
[13:01] global world right now. The USA has gone
[13:04] after the oil.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; They are positioning themselves for war.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; They will NOT STOP WITH VENEZUELA. NOW
[13:12] THEY WANT GREENLAND. THEY WANT STRATEGIC
[13:15] POINTS BECAUSE WHEN THE WORLD WAR BREAKS
[13:17] OUT,
[13:18] &gt;&gt; they need TO HAVE STRATEGIC POINTS. All
[13:20] right.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; And the reason why the natural USA the
[13:25] peace SYSTEM HAS GONE AFTER THE OIL IS
[13:28] TYPING THE FOOLISH VIRGINS HAVE GONE
[13:29] AFTER THE OIL WHILE WE ARE SHUTTING WITH
[13:32] CHRIST.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WONDERFUL.

[13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; That while they went IN AND THE DOOR WAS
[13:40] SHUT, THE W THE FOOLISH WENT TO LOOK FOR
[13:42] OIL.

[13:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord,
[13:51] &gt;&gt; you've never seen SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
[13:53] WHEN RUSSIA GOES AND TAKES OVER UH TRIES
[13:55] TO TAKE OVER UKRAINE, there's a uproar.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[13:59] &gt;&gt; they use UKRAINE AS A PROXY LAND TO
[14:02] FIGHT THE BATTLES TO TEST THE MILITARY
[14:04] EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO HOT WAR
[14:05] ON THE EARTH.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING ALL OF
[14:08] THESE OH LORD, speak this morning. They
[14:11] have BEEN DEVELOPING ALL OF THESE UH uh
[14:13] warfare and and machinery.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. But they DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TEST
[14:19] IT. BUT THE WAR IN UKRAINE GAVE THEM A
[14:21] CHANCE. NOW THEY STARTED TO PUMP ALL OF
[14:22] THEIR WEAPONS THERE in Ukraine.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; ISRAEL, I MEAN, US HAS BEEN PUMPING THEM
[14:27] WITH AMMUNITION and armor and and
[14:29] weapons of war and they've been testing
[14:31] it for them.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Testing it for them.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; But in that now, God also used to use
[14:40] the war in Ukraine because the largest
[14:42] population of Jews
[14:44] &gt;&gt; was in Eastern Europe. Yes.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; But this war displaced those Jews
[14:49] &gt;&gt; and they had to go back to the homeland.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Thousands and thousands and thousands of
[14:54] Jews have returned back to the homeland
[14:57] because of the war in Russia and
[14:58] Ukraine.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, they there couldn't be
[15:03] much more left.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:06] Amen.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; So if God has also been positioning and
[15:10] removing them back to their land,
[15:12] &gt;&gt; how close are we?
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[15:15] &gt;&gt; To the close of the gentile
[15:16] dispensation.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Let us be alert. Let us be awake.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; GOD IS MOVING HIS GOALS AND HIS PLANS.
[15:22] AMEN. THIS YEAR,
[15:24] &gt;&gt; at the start of the year, look at what
[15:25] happened.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; You also saw the video. Amen. Prophecy
[15:31] coming to pass. Last year, YOU SAW GREAT
[15:33] PROPHECY come to pass. But the prophet
[15:35] JUST SAYS, "AMEN." WATCH when you see
[15:37] that pope come out of THE USA. PEOPLE
[15:40] THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; People never felt that there WOULD BE A
[15:44] POPE COME OUT OF THE USA.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; BUT A PROPHET HAD SPOKEN it in 1954.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; AND HERE IN 2025, THE PROPHECY COMES TO
[15:51] PASS. A POPE OUT OF THE USA.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; The wheels OF PROPHECY ARE MOVING.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; And we must move with the wheels of
[16:01] prophecy.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Now you look, they're positioning
[16:06] themselves for the oil.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; The foolish virgins are positioning
[16:10] themselves for the oil,
[16:12] &gt;&gt; trying to find it. What is the oil? The
[16:14] revelation of the word.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Glory. He says here in this message
[16:22] that one of the greatest presidents that
[16:25] ever lived was Lincoln. You know,
[16:28] everyone know Abraham Lincoln.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:32] and he was a great man and though he was
[16:36] deprived of an education, brother
[16:38] Brandham is saying he never let his
[16:40] education get in the way.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; And we shouldn't let our circumstances
[16:46] and our past get in the way of what God
[16:49] has called us for.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet is trying to say
[16:52] in this message.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't allow Amen. our past
[16:56] experiences shape our destiny and our
[16:59] future.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:01] Amen. We should be able to use the word
[17:04] of God to overcome every situation and
[17:07] every circumstance that we have. Amen.
[17:10] Praise the Lord.
[17:12] So
[17:18] he says, "I like a man of vision." Now
[17:21] if you like a man of vision.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we people of vision?
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; We've got to be people of vision.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. We've got to be people of purpose.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; God has designed it now that we must be
[17:36] people of vision and people of purpose.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; When God said write the vision, do you
[17:42] know he God's vision is you. God wrote
[17:45] you.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; God wrote your life story.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; You are the vision of God. Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; And though it God says, "Wait for it."
[17:56] &gt;&gt; You are going to see me do exceedingly
[17:59] abundantly in your life.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Wait for it.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Just want to see if I put this up. Maybe
[18:08] this will work.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; He says, "I like a man of vision. I like
[18:12] people that got something they are
[18:13] fighting for."
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; What are you fighting for?
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I also want you not to be
[18:20] distracted because watch the pattern in
[18:23] your life.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; If you are fighting for something for 10
[18:26] years, stop fighting for it.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; 20 years, stop fighting for it.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; You could be focusing all your time and
[18:32] your energy for something God does not
[18:33] want you to have.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Because God is raising up men and women
[18:38] in the kingdom of God that are meant and
[18:40] destined to take the kingdom of God
[18:41] further, to establish the kingdom of
[18:43] God. But if we're finding after 5 years,
[18:46] 10 years, 15 years, you are still
[18:47] fighting for things, something, amen,
[18:49] that God doesn't want you to have, then
[18:51] let it go.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Cut ties with it.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; And say, Lord, I'm releasing this thing
[18:56] right now, and you are going to lead me
[18:58] and guide me.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Because we could be focusing all our
[19:00] attention on the wrong thing.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; But he says, I like people that got
[19:06] something they're fighting for, not just
[19:08] lay around. So, we got to be on the
[19:10] move.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:13] We have got to be on the move.
[19:16] Amen.
[19:19] He says, "Oh, some people just sit back
[19:20] and say, oh, whatever comes along will
[19:22] be all right."
[19:25] HE SAYS, "OH, BE UP AND AT IT."
[19:28] &gt;&gt; And Lincoln never let his education
[19:30] stand in the way. He had something to
[19:33] do. I think every Christian ought to be
[19:35] that way. Find your purpose and go do
[19:38] it.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, "Find your purpose."
[19:42] and go do it.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Have a purpose in life. Something you're
[19:54] going to do, God placed you here. Do
[19:58] something about it. Every member of
[20:00] every church, there's a revival in town.
[20:02] There's a revival for a purpose. Let's
[20:04] get something out of it. Let's do
[20:06] something about it.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Now, yes. That's right.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "I like a man of
[20:10] vision." Here's the meaning of vision.
[20:12] The ability to think or plan the future
[20:14] with imagination
[20:17] &gt;&gt; or wisdom.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; The ability
[20:22] to think about or plan the future with
[20:24] imagination or wisdom.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Have a concern for our lives. Don't let
[20:35] just things we'll see how it unfolds.
[20:37] No. Take charge of your life.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Demon powers are not casual about your
[20:42] life.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Demon powers want to come to kill, to
[20:47] steal, and destroy.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; They are very strategic about their
[20:53] plan.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; So we can't The Bible also says that THE
[20:57] KINGDOM OF GOD SUFFERTH VIOLENCE
[20:59] &gt;&gt; AND THE VIOLENT TAKEN BY FORCE.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO TAKE BACK OUR FAMILY BY
[21:03] FORCE. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE BACK OUR HEALTH
[21:05] BY FORCE. WE GOT TO TAKE BACK OUR
[21:07] BLESSINGS BY FORCE.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T BE CASUAL IN THIS TIME OF
[21:11] WARFARE.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; I LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE STANDING AND
[21:13] FIGHTING FOR WHAT THEY GOT.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; OH, LET'S MARCH NOW FORWARD. THERE'S AN
[21:22] AUTHORITY GIVEN TO THE BELIEVER.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; LET'S START TO USE THAT AUTHORITY.

[22:11] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; THERE'S TWO GOALS AND THERE'S TWO PLANS
[22:16] THERE.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; YES.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; In Luke 10:10.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; One come TO KILL, TO STEAL, AND DESTROY.

[22:25] COME TO GIVE YOU LIFE AND LIFE MORE
[22:26] ABUNDANTLY. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; In whose goal and whose pattern will we
[22:31] fit?
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; So when we starting to think about our
[22:36] lives and say I want to surrender my
[22:38] life to God.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; You know when when Solomon was going to
[22:42] he was placed as king over the greatest
[22:44] nation.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; God had chosen this nation.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Do you know he came to God and he says
[22:50] Lord I am young. You you made me lead
[22:53] over this people.
[22:57] He says, "Lord,
[22:59] why don't you give me wisdom to serve
[23:01] your people?"
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; So, what are we learning from there? GOD
[23:06] HAS RAISED YOU UP in your position,
[23:07] whatever caliber you have to offer the
[23:09] kingdom to serve the people.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; He never asked for riches. He asked God
[23:16] for wisdom to be able TO HANDLE WHAT GOD
[23:18] HAS GIVEN him
[23:19] &gt;&gt; and to serve.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; What has God placed in our hands? YES.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; CAN WE ASK HIM for wisdom
[23:27] &gt;&gt; to say, Lord, whatever you've placed in
[23:29] my hand, give me wisdom so that I can
[23:32] serve your people.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; And then the Lord now comes back to and
[23:39] you know where all of this happened? I
[23:41] love it. I love it.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; It happened in a dream.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Read the Bible.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; God still speaks in dreams. Yes.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; God still speaks through his word.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; If you thought maybe God came down to
[24:01] Solomon and spoke to him, no. Go read
[24:03] there.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Whatever God establishes in the dream
[24:07] becomes reality.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Look at how God spoke. God never spoke
[24:11] to Joseph face to face.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; God spoke to Joseph in a dream.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; He kept coming to him in dreams.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Don't fear to take Mary thy wife.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Dream. Yes.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; He comes back to him in a dream. Flee to
[24:23] Egypt. Dream.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Comes back to him in a dream.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Herod is dead. Go back now.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Constantly revealing himself through
[24:32] dreams.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Now we falling asleep watching Netflix.
[24:37] What you think you're going to dream
[24:38] about?
[24:41] &gt;&gt; You dreaming. You're shooting people and
[24:42] you're running and you're fighting and
[24:44] you're action movie. Even
[24:47] we're not giving our channel to the
[24:49] Lord. Amen.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; That's why the Lord don't speak to us in
[24:56] dreams and in visions anymore.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Our subconscious mind is given to the
[25:00] world.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; But God uses the subconscious mind for
[25:05] dreams and visions.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; You're dreaming of this beautiful girl.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; You're dreaming of a long hair. You're
[25:14] dreaming.
[25:17] Set your the Bible says set your mind on
[25:18] things above.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible also says that Jo
[25:22] Joseph started to think on these things
[25:24] &gt;&gt; and then the Lord appeared to him in a
[25:26] dream.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; So Solomon asked the Lord for wisdom.
[25:33] Say Lord in 2026 give me wisdom to
[25:35] manage whatever you have given me.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; So that I can now watch. Don't you say
[25:41] manage. I'm giving you the key now. So
[25:43] that I can serve your people.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Serving the people.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; The secret of Solomon's success. He
[25:53] wanted the wisdom not to boast but to
[25:55] serve God's people.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Motives are very important.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Objectives are very important when we
[26:05] are asking God things. When we are
[26:07] believing God for things.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to teach you the POSITIVE
[26:10] APPROACH. DON'T JUST BE somebody who ask
[26:13] God for things and don't know how to
[26:15] manage things and we mismanage resources
[26:17] that God has placed for the body. WE
[26:19] START TO ACCUMULATE IT AS PERSONAL
[26:21] WEALTH. WHEN GOD HAS STARTED TO RELEASE
[26:23] THINGS TO US for the body.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; When God has started to release WISDOM
[26:28] FOR THE BODY, WE START TO TAKE IT and
[26:30] apply it selfishly.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Everything that God will release to us
[26:34] in this time and season is for the
[26:36] benefit of the body.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was sharing at the Christmas
[26:39] message a few weeks ago and I was
[26:41] telling you that when GOD CALLED JOSEPH,
[26:43] HE HAD THE CAPACITY TO handle whatever
[26:45] God had called him for.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD CALLED you for something,
[26:48] he will equip you.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Some people like to give me spiritual
[26:52] answers, but I like practicality of the
[26:54] gospel of Jesus Christ.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; I was asking somebody when God told
[26:59] Joseph to flee to Egypt, he needed
[27:02] finances. He needed resources.
[27:04] But if you read just before that three
[27:07] not three sorry wise men from the east
[27:09] come to to Joseph and what does he give
[27:11] him? Frankincense.
[27:14] Somebody tell me what else he gave him.
[27:17] What do you think he did with that gold?
[27:20] Joseph was saying MY GOD SHALL PROVIDE
[27:22] all my needs.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; You see you already thought spiritual
[27:26] answers.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; You thought they kept the frankincense
[27:29] one side, the myrr and they kept the
[27:30] gold one side. No. Joseph said what a
[27:32] thing. Yeah.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; The Lord has provided gold.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; What do you think he did with it? Come
[27:37] on. Don't give me a spiritual answer
[27:39] now, brother Sunny. What do you think
[27:41] Joseph did with the gold?
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; It was for the provision for Jesus.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; You see, your religious mind won't make
[27:49] you accept that right now.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you want to go to Israel
[27:57] because you're thinking Joseph got the
[27:58] gold hidden there. No, Joseph used the
[28:00] gold.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Joseph, use the frankincense.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Joseph, use the
[28:07] &gt;&gt; turn to your neighbor and SAY, "WHATEVER
[28:08] GOD HAS GIVEN YOU, USE IT."
[28:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's break that religious
[28:13] spirit right here, right now.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; When God wants to take CARE OF THE BODY,
[28:21] THEY NEEDED PROVISION to take care of
[28:22] Jesus. God provided the gold.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the the frankincense and
[28:27] the myrr the my what the prophet says it
[28:29] was for his
[28:31] &gt;&gt; burial. So you say the gold was for his
[28:33] uh birth the gold was for his wellbeing.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Hey come on the religious people. Come
[28:38] on. I'm fighting the spirit right now.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Luke.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; If you were Joseph watch you have done
[28:47] for the gold. Now you need transport to
[28:49] go to Egypt.
[28:55] You see, some of us are looking for
[28:56] provision to come elsewhere when it's in
[28:58] our account.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; The Lord placed the goal there before
[29:04] Joseph.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Demon of unbelief, I come against you in
[29:14] Jesus name.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:17] Now, brother Brandham says the in the in
[29:20] the uh game of life, there are rules to
[29:22] the game.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; You have to play the game according to
[29:26] the rules.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; If you play it outside of the rules,
[29:29] you'll be disqualified.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; He says that's the way it is with human
[29:32] life.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; You see, even this morning, some are so
[29:36] uninterested in the service when I'm
[29:38] talking to you about your goals and
[29:40] ambitions for life. You're in a service
[29:42] for you to set your mind straight.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you don't want to hear
[29:45] spiritual guidance and wisdom about it.
[29:47] You'll go outside and you'll tell your
[29:48] unbelieving friends about your goals and
[29:50] your visions for this life
[29:51] &gt;&gt; because you don't want to align your
[29:53] goal and your vision with God's word.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; I'll hear you talking TO YOUR FRIENDS
[29:58] YAPPING. CAN'T STOP YOUR MOUTH.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; If I come and ask you, are you okay? You
[30:03] give me one word answers.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Someone will think you need therapy,
[30:07] speech therapy.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:15] He said we'll be so FULL OF THE POWER OF
[30:17] THE HOLY GHOST.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I'M REJOICING NIGHT AND DAY.
[30:20] AMEN.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; AS I WALK the narrow way, FOR THE
[30:22] COMFORTER ABIDES WITH ME.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; IF WE CAN'T REJOICE AROUND THE WORD OF
[30:28] GOD WITH ONE ANOTHER, WHO are we going
[30:30] to rejoice with the word?
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The world don't want to hear
[30:33] it.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; LET US HERE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
[30:35] DENOMINATIONS DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. Thank you, Jesus.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is with human life.
[30:44] You can't play the rules of the game of
[30:46] life wrong and expect to win.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; You've got to play it according to God's
[30:50] word.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; And the purpose that you WERE BROUGHT
[30:53] HERE FOR.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; NOW, there are so many people that don't
[30:57] seem to have any kind of purpose in
[30:59] life. I pray that's not anyone here this
[31:01] morning. Especially in this day we live,
[31:03] people seem to think that all they have
[31:05] to do is keep up with somebody.
[31:10] fashions of the world,
[31:14] animal enticements that the world give
[31:16] to them. Just like if you go to school
[31:17] and some little girls wear certain frock
[31:19] or a dress, everybody wants now to wear
[31:22] that. The ambition of the school is to
[31:24] be like this girl.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Some of the women on television,
[31:31] everyone wants to be like some famous
[31:33] person.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Don't pattern yourself after worldly
[31:36] people. Yes sir.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Don't pattern yourself after a man, the
[31:39] fashions of this world.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God tells us that Jezebel
[31:45] became the queen of Israel
[31:47] &gt;&gt; because of Ahab married her and she
[31:50] brought her fashions in.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; She brought her pants into the Israel.
[31:55] She brought her makeup into Israel.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; And the rest of the woman looked at the
[31:58] queen in admiration. He said that did
[32:00] the same thing with Jackie Kennedy.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Only thing nobody wants to
[32:06] be like Mr. Naposa.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; That seems to be just about the limit of
[32:12] the American ambition. Listen, I am I'm
[32:16] teaching. Some of you may have thought
[32:18] I'm preaching for you to set your
[32:20] worldly goals and your worldly
[32:22] ambitions. No, I'm bringing you back to
[32:25] the word.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Hear what the property is saying. Some
[32:28] people think the ambition is to get a
[32:30] new job
[32:32] or to get a raise in your salary 2026.
[32:34] will get a raise.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:39] Why do you want the raise?
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Why do you want a new job? That's the
[32:44] question we must ask.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Why do you want to get an increase in
[32:48] salary? Why do you want to get a
[32:50] television and a new car?
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. These things may be all
[32:56] right. Tell your neighbor that's all
[32:57] right.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; It's all right.
[33:01] Don't be a hardliner. The prophet saying
[33:03] it might be all right. Tell him it's all
[33:05] right. Calm down.
[33:09] But there's higher ambitions in human
[33:10] life.
[33:13] Get your car, but serve the Lord.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Plant your potatoes, but serve the Lord.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Put God first.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Come to church.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; On a Sunday and a Wednesday,
[33:28] &gt;&gt; come to church EVERY TIME THE CHURCH
[33:29] DOORS OPEN. MAKE IT YOUR PRIORITY.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; TO PUT GOD FIRST MEANS YOU MAKE IT YOUR
[33:35] PRIORITY.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; You leave every other thing. SOME PEOPLE
[33:39] HAVE ALREADY made their job their God.
[33:41] You don't find them in church because
[33:42] their job is their God.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; But if we refocus OUR AMBITION AND SAY,
[33:49] "LORD, I LEAVING THIS JOB BECAUSE I WANT
[33:51] TO BE IN THE HOUSE SERVING YOU." AMEN.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; And watch how God supplies because he
[33:55] says, "Seek you first the kingdom of God
[33:57] and his righteousness and all these
[34:00] other things I'll add to you."
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; We say, "Huh,
[34:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want you and your kingdom. I'll
[34:06] go and pursue my own way. I'll seek my
[34:08] own job. I'll seek my own happiness.
[34:10] I'll seek my own life. I won't seek the
[34:12] kingdom."
[34:13] &gt;&gt; You're not playing the rules of the
[34:15] game, right?
[34:16] &gt;&gt; You're going to lose.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY LOOK LIKE YOU ARE SUCCEEDING
[34:19] HERE.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; YEAH. ON THE OUTSIDE, you're living in A
[34:22] FANCY HOUSE. YOU GOT A NICE CAR,
[34:25] &gt;&gt; but in the kingdom of God, you are
[34:27] bankrupt.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PHYSICALLY RICH, BUT SPIRITUALLY
[34:30] POOR.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; There's higher ambitions in the human
[34:35] life than those things. And Christians,
[34:38] who Christians should set their
[34:40] affections on higher ambitions.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Glory. Christians should set their
[34:48] affections on
[34:49] &gt;&gt; higher ambitions.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; I think it will pay us all to sit down
[34:54] and wonder why we are here in the first
[34:57] place.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Why are we here?
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, why did you bring me here?
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Why am I here?
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; And whoever was kind enough to bring us
[35:07] here, we ought to consider and ask him
[35:09] what he would have us do, the purpose of
[35:12] us coming to fulfill what he has
[35:14] purposed for us. Amen.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Don't live meaningless lives. There's a
[35:19] purpose for each and every one of us.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; And we want to be in God's purpose. We
[35:23] want to be in God's will.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; So the proverb talks about choice as
[35:32] well.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; We are given choices in life.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; We are given choices.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; We can choose now to even shut the voice
[35:44] that I'm speaking with now. Yes.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; I'd say I'll hear you another time.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; You are given a choice.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; THE WAY OF LIFE is a choice.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; We have a right to make our own way.
[35:55] Choose our own way that we want to live.
[35:57] Education is a choice. Don't let
[35:59] education take you away from the things
[36:00] of God.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; We can choose whether we're going to be
[36:05] educated whether we're not going to be
[36:07] educated. So, I want to kill that
[36:09] teaching that don't get educated because
[36:12] the Lord is coming.
[36:16] Because there are many poor people here
[36:18] today because of that teaching 40 years
[36:19] ago.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; There are many people that didn't pursue
[36:26] the education to get a better job to
[36:28] take care of their families.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord was coming.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; They never brought a balance to the
[36:36] word.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:40] Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; You want scripture?
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I pick up religious demons.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; In Genesis, when the Lord told Abraham
[36:53] that I'm going to make you a mighty
[36:55] nation.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; The only promise we think about is him
[36:58] having a son.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; But in the 25 years that he waited, that
[37:04] was only one promise to be fulfilled.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Him having a son
[37:08] &gt;&gt; called Isaac. What about all the other
[37:11] promises? For 25 years, Abraham was not
[37:14] stagnant.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; He was moving. He was getting blessed.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; He was attaining things in his life.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; He was getting cattle.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; He was getting servants. The Lord was
[37:24] blessing him abundantly. He didn't
[37:26] remain stagnant for the 25 years.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; I don't hear a lot of amens for that,
[37:33] but that's the word.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't just sit around waiting for
[37:37] one promise. I will not be moved. I will
[37:40] just sit here under this tree,
[37:43] &gt;&gt; under this memory tree, and just wait
[37:45] for Isaac alone to come. Until I see
[37:47] Isaac, I shall not be moved.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Go read the book of Genesis there and
[37:54] see Abraham was on the move.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Abraham was doing things.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Abraham was not sitting idle waiting for
[38:02] Isaac.
[38:07] So, while we are waiting for the
[38:08] promised Messiah
[38:10] &gt;&gt; to come and CHANGE OUR BODIES, LET'S BE
[38:12] ON THE MOVE.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; LET'S BE UP AND AT IT. LET'S BE A PEOPLE
[38:15] OF VISION.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; LET'S BE A PEOPLE OF PURPOSE.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; You see,
[38:22] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; I know people don't like to read posts
[38:26] like this.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; You have a choice whether you want to be
[38:29] educated or not.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; That's a choice that we can make. We can
[38:35] make that choice. No problem. But keep
[38:38] your heart serving the Lord.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Don't let that take you away from the
[38:42] things of God.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Right and wrong is a choice. Every man,
[38:48] woman, boy, and girl has a choice as to
[38:50] choose whether they're going to try and
[38:51] live right or not live right. It's a
[38:54] choice. Choice is a great thing. You
[38:56] know, some of you have made choices.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; You went into the world.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; You started to enjoy the things of the
[39:01] world. It was a choice you made. But
[39:03] there's a price to be paid.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; There's a price to be paid.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Your testimony is gone. People
[39:09] know about your past.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Your reputation is gone.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Your life is now messed up. You can't
[39:14] serve the Lord.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Officers you could have held, you can't
[39:17] hold anymore. It's a choice we made.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Your eternal destination is a choice.
[39:23] And maybe tonight some of you will make
[39:25] that choice where you'll spend eternity
[39:28] before the service ends. If you've
[39:30] turned God many times, there'll be one
[39:32] time you'll turn him down the last time.
[39:34] It's a dangerous thing for a man and
[39:35] woman, boy, girl to step across the line
[39:37] for there's no return when you step
[39:39] across the deadline.
[39:41] So, make your decision. Amen. There's
[39:43] another choice in life, a life's
[39:45] companion.
[39:46] A young man or young woman stepping out
[39:48] in life has a given a right to make a
[39:50] choice. The young man chooses. The young
[39:53] woman has a right to accept or reject
[39:54] it. But it's still a choice on both
[39:56] sides. Both men and women, they have a
[39:59] right to choice.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; You have a choice as a Christian. You
[40:04] have a choice of the church in America
[40:06] so far that you can go to. That's your
[40:08] American privilege
[40:10] &gt;&gt; to choose any church that you want to
[40:13] belong to. That's a choice. You don't
[40:15] have to go to any of them if you don't
[40:17] want to. But if you want to change from
[40:19] Methodist to Baptist to Catholic to
[40:21] Protestant, there's nobody can tell you
[40:23] or make you come to any certain church.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; That's our freedom.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:31] So, you have a choice in the church
[40:35] that will guide you to your eternal
[40:37] destination. Praise the Lord. I'm just
[40:39] trying to show you that God has given us
[40:41] a choice when we are setting up goals
[40:43] and ambitions.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; It's up to us.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; We can choose to serve the Lord in 2026.
[40:49] We can choose to walk away from him.
[40:51] That's right.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's a choice.
[40:57] Yeah, we find out now this is in line
[40:59] with prophecy. We find out the fire is
[41:01] ready. The nations are ready.
[41:04] Evangelists have gone to their places
[41:06] and every gift he set in order.
[41:09] No wonder we should be persistent. No
[41:12] wonder we should be perseverant. We've
[41:14] got a goal to achieve for God. Let's
[41:16] call out the bride of Jesus Christ from
[41:18] all denominations. Oh, is somebody
[41:20] hearing what the goal of the prophet
[41:21] was?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The prophet wasn't
[41:24] somebody without a goal.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; He was here to call out the bright from
[41:28] every denomination.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; From all people.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; In making the prophet goes on to say in
[41:36] making a goal or something, you have to
[41:38] be persistent.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; So even in our natural life, be
[41:41] persistent.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; If you are trusting the Lord for
[41:44] something, be persistent.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; If you are trusting the Lord FOR A NEW
[41:48] JOB, WHATEVER YOU trusting the Lord for,
[41:50] be persistent.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:52] have a goal. He says to be persistent.
[41:56] Amen. Men through the ages. Now listen
[41:59] to this. You have to have faith in what
[42:01] you're trying to achieve. If you're
[42:03] starting a new business, have faith in
[42:05] what you're trying to achieve.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; A farmer don't plant potatoes today and
[42:09] look for others tomorrow.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; He lets the seed lay in the ground.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; He lets it go through the process.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when God starts to bless
[42:19] your business, don't turn turn away from
[42:21] him and start to go after your own ways.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; He says here, be persistent. Have faith
[42:26] in what you're trying to achieve.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Especially if you're trying to do
[42:31] something right.
[42:36] Now, when you're starting a business,
[42:39] whether you're starting a new venture,
[42:40] whether you're starting a new Amen,
[42:42] whatever goal you're pursuing, be
[42:44] persistent and don't be swayed by
[42:46] opposition.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; The first month sales may be low. Second
[42:52] month, third month, be persistent.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Have faith in what you're doing.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Apply spiritual laws naturally.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; If you understand spiritual laws, apply
[43:02] it naturally.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; It must work. Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; You're going to meet great opposition,
[43:08] but have faith, Lord. So, I'm coming to
[43:12] motive. Why do you want it to succeed?
[43:14] Why do you want your business to
[43:16] succeed? Why do you want to get a better
[43:17] job? Why do you want to get a better
[43:19] car? Motive.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; IF I CAN ESTABLISH THIS WITH YOU, AMEN.
[43:23] And and you get YOUR HEART RIGHT WITH
[43:25] GOD, GOD WILL WITHHOLD NOTHING FROM YOU.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to teach you motive.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] We'll get to motive now.
[43:36] You've got to set a goal and say this I
[43:38] believe and tie yourself to it.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whatever you're planning to
[43:44] do in 2026, set a goal.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Say this. I believe
[43:51] &gt;&gt; and tie yourself to it.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Become one with the goal.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; BECOME ONE WITH THE PURPOSE.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T SAY, "I'M going to send a
[43:59] redeemer to the earth." and didn't tie
[44:00] himself to that redeemer.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; THE WORD BECAME FLESH.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; HE TIED HIMSELF TO REDEMPTION.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; SEE, keep drawing. Keep moving up
[44:12] closer. It's there knowing that
[44:15] something is there that you're coming
[44:16] to. That's the way faith is. He quotes
[44:18] there Hebrews 11. Faith is the substance
[44:21] of things. As long as you set your faith
[44:23] on it, then anchor it. You've got it
[44:25] coming. No matter if you can't see it,
[44:27] you know it's there anyhow. You're
[44:29] tugging at it. It's pulling. And any man
[44:31] that's ever done anything worthwhile has
[44:33] set a goal.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Any man that has ever done anything
[44:36] worthwhile and set a goal.
[44:40] [crying]
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Be persistent to make that great men.
[44:48] Now, let's see. We're talking about men.
[44:50] I I'll show you God's goal. God is a God
[44:54] of a goal.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; I'll show you. The prophet says it. So,
[44:57] we can't be people without a goal.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Ask your neighbor, "Do you have a goal?"
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Do you have a goal?
[45:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about your neighbor when
[45:07] you go home. I'm talking about who you
[45:09] see now.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Because some of you never move.
[45:13] Some of you think I'm call and uh at
[45:16] home.
[45:18] No. Yeah.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Luke.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Tyson. You to ask brother Luke.
[45:27] Why?
[45:30] Ask your neighbor if he's got a goal.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; You know why I'm ask you to do that? If
[45:35] they don't have a goal, you know, think
[45:36] now I'll answer quickly to tell you.
[45:38] Yes.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; We're trying to activate it.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Because nobody likes to be left out and
[45:44] say, "No, I don't have a goal."
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Let's see God's goal.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Because we are created like God.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God is a God who has goals, we
[45:55] have to be people who have goals.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; The entire Bible is an expression of one
[46:03] goal. That who had
[46:06] &gt;&gt; who had this goal?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody say God.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; God had this goal.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; God had a goal.
[46:14] One purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[46:16] entire Bible. And all the acts of the
[46:19] believers in the Bible has been the type
[46:21] and expression what God's great goal is.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; When you're reading the Bible now, all
[46:26] of them are typing what God's great goal
[46:28] is.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; God has a goal.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And now in the last days, he has
[46:33] revealed it and shows it.
[46:37] He's revealed his goal. You got to read
[46:40] the rest of the message. Now, I gave you
[46:41] an appetizer there.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; If you read the rest of the message,
[46:44] you'll understand what God great goal
[46:46] is.
[46:48] God's great goal, I'll give it to you in
[46:50] a very simple answer. He wants to live
[46:52] in people.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; God's great goal is to live in people.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Again, you have to have faith in what
[47:06] you're doing and don't be uphazard about
[47:08] it.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, don't be uphazard
[47:12] &gt;&gt; about your goals.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Don't be uphazard.
[47:17] Amen.
[47:19] If you don't, you're going to be
[47:20] uphazard. I hope so. It'll never happen.
[47:22] It You see,
[47:24] &gt;&gt; hey, things are slow. Things are not
[47:26] working out. You know, I tried this
[47:27] thing. Let me try something else. No.
[47:31] Be persistent.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Who gave you that vision in the first
[47:35] place?
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Who gave you that motive in the first
[47:38] place? Who gave you that goal in the
[47:39] first place?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] He says you can't have faith if you're
[47:44] going to be like that. Hopping from this
[47:47] to that, hopping from this to that. He
[47:49] says tie yourself to it. Don't be afraid
[47:52] about it. Don't say it can't happen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; You must thoroughly know what you're
[47:58] going what you're going and know it's
[48:01] going to happen. Then you're positive
[48:03] it's going to happen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; You're positive it's going to happen.
[48:11] Praise the Lord.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; So be specific. Don't say Lord, oh I
[48:16] need a car. What car? How many seater?
[48:20] How many seater car you need? What is
[48:22] the purpose for the car? I'm coming to
[48:24] the purpose. I'll give it to you at the
[48:26] end. I'll close with that.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want oil. What oil you want?
[48:37] Olive oil. You want cooking oil? What
[48:39] oil? Be specific.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Don't go there and pray for oil.
[48:48] The Lord is a thing. Now what you want?
[48:50] He wants crude oil. He wants olive oil.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Cooking oil is saying castor oil.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; The Lord don't know what oil to give
[49:00] you.
[49:03] Be specific.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want a house. Well, what house
[49:09] &gt;&gt; you want? A one-bedroom house.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; You want a two-bedroom house?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; You want a three-bedroom house?
[49:16] How many bathrooms you want?
[49:21] &gt;&gt; You see, when you start to there, then
[49:22] you're already starting to envision it.
[49:24] You see it in the mind's eye first.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Then you're starting to operate like
[49:31] God. God had thoughts in the back part
[49:32] of his mind. He started to think about
[49:34] everything.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; When you start to do that, he says
[49:41] you're positive it's going to happen.
[49:44] All Christians must be persistent.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Are we all Christians here?
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now all Christians must be
[49:50] persistent."
[49:54] &gt;&gt; You see Jesus, I just put this in here
[49:56] to show you. Jesus had opposition, but
[49:58] he went on preaching the same, healing
[50:00] the same, never bothered him. There were
[50:02] many critics. The man was criticized
[50:04] from the time he was a baby until he
[50:06] died on the cross.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; And even when he rose again, they said
[50:09] he didn't rise.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; But that didn't stop his purpose.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; That didn't stop his goal.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe your father don't believe in you.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Maybe your mother don't believe in you.
[50:20] Your family don't believe in you and
[50:22] tell you whatever you're doing, you're
[50:23] going to fail. You'll never amount to
[50:25] nothing. No.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Close your ears to those words.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Every word spoken
[50:31] against you shall be condemned."
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against you shall
[50:35] prosper. God gave you the goal. God gave
[50:37] you the vision.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; When David came there to fight Goliath,
[50:40] HIS FAMILY WAS AGAINST IT.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; But God had revealed it to him.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to kill this Goliath.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the voice of opposition.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Did it stop him? No, sir. What was his
[50:59] goal? What was his goal? Always do that
[51:02] what the father has written. Always do
[51:04] what pleased him.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the prophet's goal. How many
[51:10] of you want to know what the prophet's
[51:11] goal was?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; People say he's a false prophet.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; People say it's a cult.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Let me show you what the prophet's goal
[51:16] is, and you make your decision right
[51:18] now.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to see what William
[51:21] Brandham came for
[51:22] &gt;&gt; and you make a decision what his goal in
[51:25] life was?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. Can I get more people to agree
[51:28] with me?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Let's put it to a test.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Not for one MOMENT DO I BRING A MESSAGE
[51:36] to the people that they may follow me.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Or join my CHURCH
[51:44] &gt;&gt; OR START SOME fellowship and
[51:46] organization.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; I have never done that and will not do
[51:50] that now.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I have no interest in those things.
[51:53] Those are not my goals.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:57] But I do have an interest in the things
[51:59] of God
[52:00] &gt;&gt; and people. And if I can accomplish just
[52:02] one thing, I will be satisfied.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; The that one thing is to see established
[52:10] a true relationship between God and men.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet came to establish A
[52:16] RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND MEN.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't want that?
[52:19] &gt;&gt; How is this a cult?
[52:22] &gt;&gt; How is this a false prophet?
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm showing you the prophet's
[52:27] goal.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; He came to establish A TRUE RELATIONSHIP
[52:31] BETWEEN GOD and man.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; The goal of the prophet wherein men
[52:38] become new creations in Christ.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Filled with his spirit. Live according
[52:44] to his word. I would invite all plead
[52:47] warn to hear his voice at this time and
[52:49] heal yourselves completely to him. Even
[52:51] as I trust in my heart that you have
[52:53] given my that I have given my all to
[52:55] him. God blessing and God bless you and
[52:57] may his coming rejoice your heart.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So that was
[53:02] the prophet's goal.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; That was the prophet's goal. Now let's
[53:06] close. How many of you want to close?
[53:08] Praise the Lord. Everyone say no. If you
[53:11] don't say yes and it means no.
[53:14] Hallelujah.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Everyone feeling good?
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Tell your neighbor I
[53:21] feel good.
[53:24] Oh, I feel good.
[53:27] Praise the Lord. Praise Jesus.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Praise Jesus.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Now, I told you that Joshua was I I open
[53:37] by showing you Joshua marching into a
[53:38] new land.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Now, our strength is going to come from
[53:41] being in the land.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Don't think the seals are open for no
[53:45] reason.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Our strength is being in the land. You
[53:48] hear what the prophet is saying here
[53:49] now, right?
[53:51] The pilgrim fathers were very thankful
[53:52] for their new found way. Being separated
[53:55] from their old denomination and creed,
[53:57] they could marry a new anointed word for
[53:59] their age. The new anointed word for
[54:01] their age for their day.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Now hear what he says. So we can be
[54:12] thankful as pilgrims like Abraham
[54:15] separated ourselves from the things of
[54:17] the world. all of our associates.
[54:19] Abraham was a pilgrim. God has separated
[54:22] us from dead religions. I'm speaking
[54:24] across the nation now dead creeds and to
[54:27] do what? Separated us and opened a new
[54:31] land. A new message for this day.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; So a new land just LIKE HOW WE TOLD
[54:38] JOSHUA, YOU NEED TO INHERIT YOUR LAND. A
[54:40] new land was open to us.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Right? He says Pentecost dried up. You
[54:45] know, all of these things. What did he
[54:47] do? He opened up the seven seals of the
[54:49] last message. That's our new land.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; We live in the land of the open book.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; We live in the land of our inheritance.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; You notice that the seven seals which
[55:01] are all the mysteries of the seven
[55:02] church ages were sealed with seven
[55:05] seals. The reformers didn't have time to
[55:07] do it. They didn't live long enough.
[55:09] about this blessed revelation OF THE
[55:11] SEVEN SEALS.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; MORE PEOPLE OUGHT TO GET EXCITED ABOUT
[55:15] THIS BLESSED REVELATION OF THE SEVEN
[55:17] SEALS. THIS IS OUR NEW LAND. JOSHUA,
[55:20] YOU'VE GOT TO STEP INTO THE NEW LAND.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; It's open to us in this last day from a
[55:28] prophecy that went forth to Arizona.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; OUR STRENGTH. PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHERE
[55:34] THE BRIDE IS GETTING HER STRENGTH. SHE
[55:36] IS WALKING IN HER LAND.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; SHE'S MARCHING AND RULING FROM THIS
[55:42] LAND.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; We don't have the same anointing as
[55:48] denominations.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE FALSE ANOINTED.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; WE ARE ANOINTED BECAUSE WE ARE IN OUR
[55:53] LAND.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TAKEN A POSITION FROM 63 RIGHT
[55:57] NOW TO 2026. THIS BRIDE HAS BEEN
[55:59] MARCHING onward [applause]
[56:01] Christian soldiers MARCHING TO THE BEAT
[56:04] OF ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS. We need
[56:06] more soldiers to arise. Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; BELIEVERS, THE SEVENTH YEARS IS OUR
[56:11] REVELATION. A BLESSED REVELATION. And we
[56:14] live in this land of abundance.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Motive. Coming to motive. Now you say,
[56:20] "Show me the motive." HOW DO I ASK GOD
[56:22] FOR A CAR AND show him THE RIGHT MOTIVE?
[56:23] HOW DO I ASK GOD? AMEN. FOR BLESSINGS
[56:25] AND ASKING FOR THE RIGHT MOTIVE. WHY DO
[56:27] I WANT TO BE HEALED? WHAT IS THE RIGHT
[56:29] MOTIVE?
[56:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Motive is very important. Yes sir.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody say motive is very important.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[56:43] the Lord.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this. Now I told
[56:49] you I'll give you the motive and then we
[56:51] can all ask God right and act right,
[56:53] live right. Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to see the motive?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Let's see now. Let's get our motive
[57:14] right. Whatever our goals we are facing,
[57:15] let's get the motive right.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Let's get the objective right. So he
[57:19] says here, a group of men came to him a
[57:21] long ago. I kept telling them there's
[57:23] oil in Kentucky.
[57:27] M
[57:27] &gt;&gt; yeah.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; He kept telling them not Kentucky oil.
[57:32] Now I know it's very oily that chicken.
[57:34] Now he's not talking about
[57:36] &gt;&gt; that chicken.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Some of you you you don't know what
[57:39] Kentucky is. You're thinking about KFC
[57:41] and you think how oily that chicken is.
[57:43] He's not talking about that oil.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:48] Go to Kentucky. Oil down there. I knew
[57:52] it. I seen it in a vision. So now God
[57:55] can open up things to you
[57:57] &gt;&gt; if you ask him,
[57:59] &gt;&gt; but you must have the right motive.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; We are closing. Just tell your neighbor
[58:02] we are closing.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; You told your neighbor we're closing.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you because some of them are
[58:08] sleeping. I want you to wake them up and
[58:09] say come. We're closing now.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; So the prophet now, imagine the Lord
[58:17] would reveal to his prophet there's oil.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; There's great wealth in oil.
[58:22] He told his men to go down there to
[58:24] Kentucky. There's oil there.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; They didn't go.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Deus and them didn't go
[58:31] for a long time. After a while, finally
[58:33] they said Texas came in now. The oil
[58:37] merchants from Texas now. Now they said
[58:40] now we are going down.
[58:43] I said you auto went a long time ago but
[58:46] they didn't do it. M
[58:50] &gt;&gt; we have ought to be in places a long
[58:51] time ago, but we didn't go.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; God wants to move us farther ahead and
[58:56] we didn't go because we're stuck in
[58:58] cycles.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; We're closing. Tell somebody we're
[59:02] closing.
[59:05] Dema said, "I made a great mistake
[59:08] by not doing that." Brother Brandon,
[59:11] I said, "If you did, if you went down
[59:13] there, you were mad at all.
[59:16] Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; You would have added all.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; How many of you know he's the same
[59:23] yesterday, today, and forever?
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; If you seek God's wisdom, God can bless
[59:28] you exceedingly abundantly above all
[59:30] that you can ask for things.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Let me be honest with you. People are
[59:33] still buying things.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; People are still buying products. People
[59:36] are still doing business.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; So ask the Lord for wisdom. Lord, bring
[59:41] that business to me.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember the motive.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; We're coming to the motive.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] They didn't listen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; We were having lunch. The Holy Spirit
[59:57] showed me a great crack in the earth.
[59:59] Yeah, we're talking about that crack in
[1:00:01] the earth now. Yeah. In Los Angeles. The
[1:00:04] Holy Spirit now showed the prophet a
[1:00:05] crack in the earth where the oil is.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; How many of you know where the Holy
[1:00:10] Spirit is right now?
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know you can still
[1:00:13] show your cracks in the earth?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know some of us don't know how to
[1:00:17] harness the power of the Holy Ghost?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is sent to lead us.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is sent to guide us.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is sent to teach us.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; But how many of us are ever conscious of
[1:00:30] the Holy Ghost?
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; How many of us ask the Holy Ghost?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; The power is in us.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; How many of us talk to the Holy Ghost?
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; And say, "Holy Ghost, give me wisdom.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; I'm doing this. I got this goal. God,
[1:00:41] this year,
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; show me.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Show me.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; How many of us have the capacity to hear
[1:00:46] the voice of the Holy Ghost?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach the next service
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; on that. Amen. The Holy Spirit showed me
[1:00:55] a crack in the air that was full of oil
[1:00:59] and those overflow in Kentucky was just
[1:01:02] a little bit of oil
[1:01:06] that was pumping, but this one was the
[1:01:08] main stream. And I said, "But the deus,
[1:01:10] it's there."
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; So they went searching for it said, "Go
[1:01:14] down and tell us where the oil well is."
[1:01:16] I said, "Oh, no, sir."
[1:01:19] See, we don't use the gift of God for
[1:01:21] commercial.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; He could tell me where it was, but I
[1:01:25] don't have any need of it.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; So, let's learn from this. If we have a
[1:01:31] need for it, we can ask God for it.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; But in the prophet's ministry, he didn't
[1:01:36] have need for it.
[1:01:39] But if you have need for something, you
[1:01:41] can and you have faith for it, you can
[1:01:42] ask God.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; I don't have need. I wouldn't have
[1:01:46] enough faith to enough to ask him. If I
[1:01:49] had a need of it, I believe if I'd ask
[1:01:52] him, he'd tell me.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; But first, your motives and objective
[1:01:56] has to be right.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; You have to have reasons for this. God
[1:02:02] didn't give me those things just because
[1:02:04] you asked.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; So, we're trying to learn now how to ask
[1:02:10] God for things.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; You must have a need for it.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; And your motive and objective must be
[1:02:14] right.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; You cannot ask in faith unless there's a
[1:02:21] real objective to it to be in the will
[1:02:23] of God. If you want to be well, what do
[1:02:25] you want to be well for?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; If you want to be healed, what's the
[1:02:28] reason you want to be healed? What are
[1:02:30] you telling God? What do you want to do
[1:02:31] with your life when you get healed?
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. There's got to be
[1:02:36] you've got to have a motive and
[1:02:38] objective and there have to be a right
[1:02:39] according to the will of God. Then then
[1:02:42] faith is revealed to you. God by
[1:02:45] sovereign grace places that faith in
[1:02:47] there then it's over.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Now to make that word true when the
[1:02:51] brethren got down there one fellow went
[1:02:53] over and brought a bunch of stuff. So
[1:02:55] leases cheated the other one. You see it
[1:02:57] wouldn't work. Now just to make the
[1:02:59] prophecy sure within a 100 yards where
[1:03:02] these men were digging their well some
[1:03:04] men struck the big gusher and there 1100
[1:03:07] barrels of oil in half a day something
[1:03:09] or the other like that still putting it
[1:03:11] out right in that mainstream but just to
[1:03:15] make the prophecy of the word that had
[1:03:16] been said it was there it was there the
[1:03:18] rest of them nearly all dried up
[1:03:20] everywhere through Kentucky little ponds
[1:03:23] they pump them a little while it's only
[1:03:25] overflow from this but because of their
[1:03:27] selfish got among them. Its objectives
[1:03:30] was wrong. Signing up a bunch of stuff.
[1:03:32] It would be this way. And they promised
[1:03:34] they would do it for the kingdom of God,
[1:03:36] but look like it was for themselves.
[1:03:38] Here's the key.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I want IT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Nobody likes that answer.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; THE OBJECTIVE MUST BE FOR THE KINGDOM OF
[1:03:51] GOD.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; I WANT IT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The objective must be the kingdom
[1:03:58] of God.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Because in a kingdom, nothing belongs to
[1:04:03] the citizens.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; It all belongs to the king. AND WE ARE
[1:04:07] STEWARDS OF WHATEVER HE ADMINISTERS TO
[1:04:08] US.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you learning how to ask God
[1:04:12] for things?
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; How many of you know why you want to be
[1:04:17] healed? You want to be healed for the
[1:04:18] glory of God.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; So, that's a good objective. I want to
[1:04:23] be healed for the glory of God. Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; I want to serve you in your kingdom.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Why do you want a job? I want a I want a
[1:04:30] a job for the kingdom of God.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; So that I can serve you in your kingdom.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Why do you want the oil well? Lord, the
[1:04:38] kingdom needs funding. The kingdom needs
[1:04:40] finances.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; I want to finance the kingdom of God.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; So you have free to start to ask for it.
[1:04:45] Is somebody reading the quote and
[1:04:46] agreeing with me? The prophet is saying
[1:04:48] the objective must be the kingdom of
[1:04:50] God.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. but look like it's all for
[1:04:54] themselves. It won't work. No selfish
[1:04:57] thing will work. Your motives and
[1:04:58] objective has to be exactly perfectly
[1:05:00] right. Then you are free to ask. If your
[1:05:02] art condemn us not, then we are
[1:05:05] confident. See, I want this to the honor
[1:05:09] and glory of God.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; So write that next to your goal.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody hearing me? I'm closing.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Write this next to your goal.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Whatever you put your goal in, I want
[1:05:20] this for the glory of God.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if whatever you're asking, you
[1:05:24] know, now it can't be used for the glory
[1:05:26] of God, strike that from your goal list.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're hearing what I'm
[1:05:30] saying.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; If if your goal now can't bring glory to
[1:05:33] God, then you got to strike that goal
[1:05:35] off.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; So 2026, VISION BOARD MUST BE UP.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; 2026, your goals must be clear. AND IT'S
[1:05:46] ALL FOR THE GLORY OF GOD.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL FOR HIS KINGDOM.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:53] I want this for the honor and glory of
[1:05:54] God. Then faith has a channel to move
[1:05:56] into it. If it doesn't, then you got
[1:05:59] mental, intellectual faith, not genuine
[1:06:00] faith.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Might get you emotional, but it won't
[1:06:04] get you the healing you're looking for.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:13] I think we're done there. How many if
[1:06:14] you got the point?
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; How many of you got the point? Amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; God will withhold no good thing from his
[1:06:21] body right now
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; from the bride of Jesus Christ. God will
[1:06:24] withhold no good thing.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; It's his goal and his objective to make
[1:06:30] this bride prosperous to make her
[1:06:33] abundantly blessed.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Praise
[1:06:39] the Lord.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[1:06:47] [applause] the Lord. [cheering]
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn to 1 Corinthians 15. I'll
[1:06:52] give you a scripture. Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; People think there are no promises in
[1:06:59] the word of God. There are promises in
[1:07:01] the word of God that we can't even
[1:07:03] contain.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Hey. Hallelujah.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; How many of you are writing the
[1:07:13] scripture down? I don't know how to
[1:07:15] enlarge this here, but I've got 1
[1:07:17] Corinthians 1:4. I thank my God always
[1:07:20] on your behalf for the grace of God
[1:07:22] which is given to you by Jesus Christ.
[1:07:24] That in some things
[1:07:27] anyone can see that word.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody say it loud.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; One Corinthians 15.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody say it loud.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; That in everything
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; you are
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; in him. Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; In all utterance and in all knowledge.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; In everything I'm enriched in it.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; In everything.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I'm enriched in Christ Jesus.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Let's get the musicians. Give the Lord a
[1:07:58] good hand clap of praise. [applause]
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Now, if God could show the prophet an
[1:08:05] oil well, God can show you for your
[1:08:07] life.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; God can show you the plan and purpose
[1:08:10] for your life.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:19] Amen.
[1:08:21] Glory be to his name.
[1:08:25] How many if you love the Lord?
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's [singing] worthy to be
[1:08:29] praised.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; He's worthy to be praised. Let's sing
[1:08:32] and worship him. Amen.
[1:08:38] Hallelujah.
[1:08:40] G. Have we got G? Amen.

[1:08:50] God. [singing and music]
