[2:52] amen let's turn to the Bible amen
[2:54] Ephesians chapter
[2:57] 5 Ephesians chapter 5 and verse
[3:01] 25 Hallelujah we'll speak this morning
[3:04] on a glorious church amen that's what
[3:07] Christ is looking for amen Christ is
[3:09] looking for a glorious church amen amen
[3:13] you see everything is coming now to the
[3:15] end and at the end everything reaches
[3:17] its Glory the world is looking for their
[3:20] Superman yes amen so everything is
[3:22] reaching the climax now and everything
[3:24] is coming to its full glory and when you
[3:26] see that happening in the natural you be
[3:28] under expectation to happen in the
[3:30] spiritual
[3:31] amen Ephesians 5 and 25 reads husbands
[3:36] love your wives now that is not a
[3:40] suggestion
[3:42] amen that's an
[3:44] instruction that's a command husbands
[3:47] love your wives how even as Christ also
[3:51] loved the church amen how did he love
[3:54] the church and gave himself for it amen
[3:58] so the love of a husband is a
[4:00] sacrificial
[4:02] one okay but now we're focusing on the
[4:05] love of Christ and the church he gave
[4:07] himself for it that he might sanctify
[4:11] and
[4:13] cleanse so sanctify means to purify and
[4:16] cleanse means to wash so he wants to
[4:18] purify and wash it with the washing of
[4:20] Water by the word amen that he might
[4:24] present it to himself a glorious Church
[4:27] am amen Christ is going to present to
[4:31] himself a glorious church not having
[4:34] spot that's not having Mark even the
[4:36] mark of the beast or wrinkle or any such
[4:41] thing but that it should be holy and
[4:44] without blemish amen this is the body of
[4:48] Believers that Christ is going to
[4:49] present to himself amen amen Revelation
[4:52] 19 and7 then you can be
[4:57] seated Revelation 19 and seven says let
[5:00] us be glad and rejoice that also is not
[5:04] a
[5:06] suggestion that comes now amen we need
[5:09] joyful people we need people full of
[5:12] praise full of Power full of
[5:16] Glory let us be glad and rejoice amen
[5:20] sometimes no all the time and give honor
[5:23] to him oh I worship you almighty God
[5:26] Amen whether the music is playing or
[5:28] whether it's not playing amen even if
[5:30] the song leader stops a song your
[5:32] worship ought to emanate from within you
[5:34] amen glorifying his name amen hallelujah
[5:37] we can't be like a cold engine back in
[5:39] the day we have to crank it yes crank it
[5:43] amen hallelujah not in this late hour by
[5:46] now we ought to know how to worship God
[5:48] Amen if we want to experience a greater
[5:50] glory we've got to give him a greater
[5:52] praise amen so let us rejoice let us be
[5:55] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[5:58] notice these are instructions not
[5:59] suggestions for the marriage of the Lamb
[6:02] is
[6:04] come and his wife had made herself ready
[6:08] amen amen you may be seated the Lord had
[6:10] blessings to the reading of his
[6:12] word praise the Lord now if you contrast
[6:15] those two one he's telling you that the
[6:17] Lord is presenting himself a glorious
[6:20] church and then here in Revelation 19
[6:23] it's telling us that the wife is making
[6:25] herself ready so what is it is he
[6:28] preparing us or are we making ourselves
[6:30] ready on our own but the mystery of it
[6:34] is that it is he in
[6:36] us he's doing the work in US amen he
[6:41] himself is now in us and that's how the
[6:44] bride is making our
[6:46] ready allowing the work of the Holy

[8:08] five R amen hallelujah it's homegoing
[8:12] time amen and now here we read that
[8:16] Christ loved the church and he gave
[8:17] himself for her now the reason he gave
[8:21] himself for it is to cleanse it to
[8:23] Sanctified and to present himself a
[8:25] glorious
[8:26] church I want you to know that
[8:29] that is going to start on the earth
[8:32] before he presented himself this
[8:34] glorious Church suddenly your UNG
[8:37] glorious life is not going to become
[8:39] glorious because you had a body
[8:42] change the only thing that you should be
[8:44] lacking is the resurrection of the
[8:46] Saints and a new body but before that
[8:49] you shall be glorious amen I don't think
[8:52] you're getting it am amen hallelujah I
[8:55] also want you to understand what I am
[8:57] telling you about this year about what

[9:01] not talking about your glorified body
[9:04] that we can't do anything

[9:47] don't have a spot we don't have a
[9:48] wrinkle no such thing and we should be
[9:51] holy and without
[9:53] blemish now last week we were
[9:55] focusing on glorifying me with the glory
[9:58] that Jesus has given given me and we
[10:00] find how did we get that glory is
[10:02] because the father had given Jesus that
[10:04] glory and he says the glory you have
[10:06] given me I have given them amen now
[10:11] Jesus say something very particular
[10:13] there he says with the glory that I had
[10:15] with thee from before the foundation of
[10:17] the
[10:19] world remember Jesus is in a
[10:21] three-dimensional
[10:23] World okay he's in a body that has
[10:26] limitations but he's saying glorify me
[10:28] with the Glory that I had with thee from
[10:30] before the foundation of the world Amen
[10:33] what glory is that amen Jesus is
[10:36] remembering
[10:38] something now remember yeah if we read
[10:41] in St John 17:1 it says these words
[10:44] spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to
[10:46] heaven and said father the hour is come
[10:51] what hour was this the ending of his
[10:53] life what hour was it the end
[10:58] time
[11:00] the end time for the bridegroom come on
[11:02] now catch it it's the end time for the
[11:05] bridegroom and at the end time he is
[11:08] looking for a higher level of
[11:11] Glory it's the end time for the Bride of
[11:14] Jesus Christ and what is Jesus prayer
[11:17] father the hour is come glorify thy son
[11:20] that thy son may also glorify Thee I
[11:23] wonder if the prayer of the Bride should
[11:25] not be father glorify your bride
[11:29] that the bride May glorify
[11:32] thee amen
[11:35] hallelujah and as thou has given him
[11:37] Power Over All Flesh now watch this is
[11:41] very important watch what he is
[11:43] detailing he has power over All Flesh
[11:46] that he should give eternal life to as
[11:48] many as thou has given
[11:50] him amen amen and this is life eternal
[11:55] that they may now he's defining eternal
[11:57] life what is it eternal life that they
[12:00] might Know Thee the only true God in
[12:02] Jesus Christ whom he thou has sent amen
[12:06] yes Lord I have glorified thee on the
[12:08] earth I have finished the work which
[12:10] thou gavest me to do and now oh Father
[12:13] glorify thou me with thine own self with
[12:16] the glory which I had with thee before
[12:18] the world was amen now back up there bit
[12:23] in first verse
[12:25] two he has power over All Flesh he has
[12:29] power on the
[12:30] Earth but I want the glory where I have
[12:33] power both in heaven and on Earth
[12:36] amen that's what Jesus is asking
[12:39] for take away my
[12:42] limitation I had a glory with you from
[12:44] the beginning what glory is that you ask
[12:47] amen hallelujah amen you know the
[12:49] scriptures John 1 in the beginning was
[12:52] the word and the Word was God and the
[12:54] Word was with God and the Word was made
[12:57] flesh and dwelt amongst us
[12:59] amen let's read some of it amen let's
[13:00] turn to John 1 for those of you that
[13:02] don't know it we want to read it and see
[13:04] what Glory Jesus is actually asking the
[13:06] father
[13:07] for what is he
[13:10] missing we're coming to our part now but
[13:13] we just need to background this because
[13:15] as is he so is
[13:20] she in the beginning was the word and
[13:23] the Word was with God and the Word was
[13:25] God this is not talking about Jesus the
[13:27] logos the same was in the beginning with
[13:30] God now watch Jesus is now this part
[13:35] verse three all things were made by
[13:41] himen and without him was not anything
[13:44] made that was
[13:45] made in him was life and the life was
[13:48] the light of men and the light shined in
[13:51] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[13:53] it not
[13:55] amen so Jesus is having reflections of
[13:58] his former
[13:59] [Music]
[14:00] s let's drop down to verse 14 and the
[14:03] word Jesus was made flesh and dwelt
[14:06] among us and we beheld his
[14:09] glory the glory as of the begotten of
[14:11] the father full of grace and truth amen
[14:15] John bear witness of him and cried this
[14:18] was he of whom I speak he that cometh
[14:21] after me is prefer before me for he was
[14:25] before me amen so even every Elijah the
[14:28] Prophet knows that Jesus
[14:31] existed
[14:33] amen come on now amen John is saying he
[14:37] was before me but John is 6 months older
[14:40] than Jesus but they are talking by
[14:43] Revelation amen amen hallelujah they
[14:46] know who this is amen hallelujah praise
[14:49] the lord we can't bypass now you see all
[14:52] of it is in chapters amen Colossians
[14:55] chapter 1 let's go Colossians chapter 1
[14:57] let's learn about the head and and what
[14:58] he's talking about
[15:00] here Colossians 1 and verse 16 just to
[15:04] show you now what Jesus
[15:06] is okay maybe we'll read from verse 14
[15:09] then you'll know who we talking
[15:13] about Amen in whom we have
[15:17] Redemption through his blood even the
[15:19] Forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[15:22] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[15:25] creature for by him were all things
[15:27] created that are in heaven that are on
[15:30] earth visible and invisible whether they
[15:33] be Thrones or dominions or
[15:35] principalities or Powers all things were
[15:37] created by Jesus and for
[15:42] Jesus Jesus is before all things and by
[15:45] Jesus all things
[15:47] consist Jesus is the head of the body
[15:49] the church who is the beginning the
[15:51] firstborn from the dead that in all
[15:53] things he might have the preeminence for
[15:57] it pleased the father that in Jesus
[15:59] should all the fullness dwell amen no
[16:03] Jesus is just a one part of the Trinity
[16:05] of gods but here the Bible is telling
[16:08] you that even if they believe in Trinity
[16:10] of God's father son holy spirit all
[16:13] three was dwelling in Jesus amen
[16:17] yes and having made peace through the
[16:19] blood of his cross by him to reconcile
[16:21] all things unto himself I say whether
[16:24] there be things in Earth or things in
[16:27] heaven as sometime alienated and enemies
[16:30] in your mind by Wicked Works yet now had
[16:32] he reconciled in the body of his flesh
[16:34] through death to present you holy now
[16:38] here's the key for you he's doing it all
[16:40] for you to present you holy and
[16:43] unblamable
[16:44] and unprovable in his sight unreprovable
[16:48] in his sight that word holy and
[16:50] unblamable you got to pay attention to
[16:52] it because that's what you were
[16:54] predestinated for we'll read it now if
[16:57] you continue in the Faith grounded and
[16:59] settled and be not moved away from the
[17:01] hope of the Gospel which you have heard

[21:54] with the glory I had with
[21:56] thee amen

[22:09] for them which also Shall Believe on me
[22:11] through their

[23:59] amen let's just read this next quote
[24:01] because I need you to see what the
[24:02] prophet is saying about you maybe he's
[24:04] saying about you if you can connect with
[24:06] I was thinking today that the best that
[24:07] I can remember the tide of spiritual
[24:10] enthusiasm that's passion is rising high
[24:13] in Phoenix than any time I've ever seen
[24:15] it
[24:17] amen amen but that's only amongst two or
[24:20] three who are gathered in his
[24:22] name that's how it feels this
[24:25] morning amen it may feel like uh there's
[24:29] a lot of people here but only two or
[24:31] three may be gathered in his
[24:33] name amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[24:40] amen hallelujah you
[24:43] know you got to say Amen to the word yes
[24:46] amen because right now you can grieve
[24:48] the minister and pull him out of that
[24:50] realm amen and make him pull out a belt
[24:54] that he don't want to really pull
[24:56] out so I'm talking to you as spiritual
[24:59] people and showing you a glorious church
[25:02] I'm trying to show you a high level of a
[25:04] glorious Church a mature Church yes

[25:11] me spank me please you know you get
[25:14] naughty children you don't really want
[25:16] to hit them but they get to a point
[25:18] where the only way to get the attention
[25:21] of the
[25:23] spirit yes is to wack the flesh
[25:29] because where is memory in your spirit
[25:32] if you want the child to really remember
[25:35] what I'm telling you don't do that then
[25:38] you got to attack the flesh so that it's
[25:41] ingrained in the spirit then they stop
[25:43] it yes okay but we don't want to be
[25:46] doing that this morning let me go back
[25:48] to my higher level going up to the high
[25:51] places I'm going up to the high
[25:54] places Now That Glory that is in John
[25:58] 17:22 is both the radiance of God's
[26:01] character and the status of us being
[26:03] children of God now I want to say this
[26:06] because that's why I'm talking to a
[26:07] mature church this morning when
[26:09] something is entrusted to you you've got
[26:11] to have the grace to carry it

[27:01] his bride in a with such glory in a way
[27:03] that we have never experienced before in
[27:05] the 21st

[27:10] separating line will
[27:12] come we can all come into His presence
[27:15] and enjoy the presence and enjoy the
[27:17] benefits of being in his presence we can
[27:19] be healed have encounters with the Holy
[27:21] Ghost amen and that's all we may receive
[27:25] but the separation is coming now between
[27:27] those who will allow God to take full
[27:29] control of their soul mind heart amen
[27:33] their entire being yes
[27:36] Lord in order for God to finish the plan
[27:39] that he had in his mind from before the
[27:41] foundation of the
[27:44] world Amen he's going to take control of
[27:47] your body yes
[27:50] Lord he's got to take control of your
[27:53] spirit amen he got to take control of
[27:55] your soul yes Lord

[28:50] years the last time the people on Earth
[28:53] would have seen something like this
[28:55] would have been in the days of the
[28:56] Prophet William Brandon
[28:58] William brandham came with a message and
[29:00] his message came to turn our hearts back
[29:02] to the faith of the fathers according to
[29:05] Malachi 4: 5 and 6 young people you got
[29:08] to know
[29:09] this we've had a prophet that's walked

[29:17] mystery of God according to Revelation
[29:19] 10 1-7 yes amen and we which have

[29:25] have allowed the word to have a work in
[29:27] our lives amen hallelujah and what it

[29:33] the full effect of the message the
[29:35] message is not growing weaker but it is
[29:37] growing stronger amen hallelujah I'm
[29:40] allowing the message to take its full
[29:43] have its full potential in me amen the
[29:45] message may be weakening to some people
[29:47] but to me the message is getting
[29:49] stronger and stronger because there's a
[29:52] group of people willing to surrender
[29:54] their lives give God praise if you're
[29:56] one of them
[29:58] amen hallelujah amen we are about to
[30:02] experience a full power of the message
[30:03] of the hour and what it what is what it
[30:06] was intended to do amen because we have
[30:09] we have witnessed the power and the
[30:10] demonstration of the Gospel now it's
[30:12] time for the full manifest presence of
[30:14] the Lord to be seen in the
[30:17] bride what does it says in these last
[30:19] days the true
[30:22] bride that's Christ seed will come to
[30:26] the headstone
[30:27] you remember we put up that picture yes
[30:29] that picture is probably still there you
[30:31] can put it after we read this
[30:33] quote as she kns The Headstone what's
[30:35] the headstone
[30:37] love

[30:57] we are not at the bottom we are right on
[31:00] top amen nearing The
[31:04] Headstone I'm saying nearing The
[31:06] Headstone but I'm telling you the
[31:08] headstone has come crying Grace that's
[31:10] what the message Shalom was all
[31:14] about crying Grace a double portion
[31:17] Grace to this end time people if we
[31:19] didn't receive a double portion Grace
[31:21] because you know they say the headstone
[31:23] is coming crying Grace Grace we in
[31:26] latest year would not have made it if we
[31:28] didn't receive a double portion
[31:30] anointing of
[31:35] Grace they in the bride will be so much
[31:38] like
[31:40] him yes what we talking about they
[31:42] express image now of Jesus they in the
[31:45] bride will be so much like him that they
[31:48] will even be in his very image that's
[31:50] his image now right there will be even
[31:53] in his very image you got to be in His
[31:56] image for the next part now in order to
[31:58] be United with
[32:01] him they will be one they will be the
[32:04] very manifestation of the word of the
[32:07] Living God can put that picture back up
[32:10] now amen you can see we are not at the
[32:14] bottom we right on top where the
[32:16] headstone is say double portion Grace is
[32:19] coming upon
[32:20] us because leosia is dark Leos here is
[32:25] demon possessed hell has been Unleashed
[32:28] upon the earth and the Bible says if it
[32:32] were possible the elect would be

[32:41] amen amen come on now come on demon

[32:45] back up amenallah
[32:47] amen so the highest form of Glory of
[32:50] God's glory that can be
[32:55] revealed is through an end time people
[32:58] yes amen God can't fully reveal his
[33:00] glory through lutherans through wesan
[33:03] through Pentecostals amen that's why he
[33:06] sent a message to prepare a body of
[33:08] people that he can fully Express his
[33:10] glory through yes amen
[33:14] amen all that he want to achieve is to
[33:17] be expressed through us when God can
[33:19] have the preeminence in our lives amen
[33:22] that's the highest form of his glory oh
[33:25] thank you Lord to be Reve in the highest
[33:28] form of
[33:29] creation Hallelujah you see if you read
[33:32] Genesis there you'll see it's telling
[33:33] you that in the cool of the day Adam
[33:37] heard God coming what was that sound
[33:40] like the same sound in Acts chapter 2 it
[33:43] was like a mighty rushing
[33:46] wind oh thank his sound does not change
[33:50] yeah Adam said I heard your sound in the
[33:53] garden and I hid
[33:54] myself so Adam knew when he was is
[34:00] coming amen like a mighty rushing wind
[34:04] amen amen hallelujah and what was coming
[34:08] his glory was coming down when the
[34:11] Praises go
[34:13] up his glory comes down yes amen Prophet
[34:17] said that in the cool of the day Adam
[34:19] and Eve would present themselves before
[34:21] the Lord and His glory would
[34:23] [Music]
[34:25] descend amen he wasn't descending to any
[34:28] other life form he was coming down to
[34:30] the highest form of
[34:32] creation so I tell you from the
[34:34] beginning of the world even up to from
[34:37] the fall till now God didn't have a
[34:39] people that he could come and descend
[34:40] with his glory but in the end time he
[34:42] now as a people back in the image of God
[34:46] again amen God has worked to achieve
[34:49] this through seven Church
[34:52] ages amen hallelujah am praise the lord
[34:56] we are not a we defeat the church we
[34:58] know who we are amen amen hallelujah we
[35:01] know that is ongoing time we are right
[35:03] at the head we are right at the top
[35:07] that's that to me let me tell you is the
[35:08] end of the Gentile dispensation there's
[35:11] no long future for you right amen
[35:13] hallelujah praise the Lord
[35:17] amen You' rather go to your father now
[35:20] and quote their John 17
[35:22] father if you saw already you need to go
[35:25] to your father and say father
[35:27] I would that she be where I
[35:29] am if you don't know what I'm talking
[35:31] about in plain English you rather get
[35:33] married while you
[35:36] can I just gave you a scripture to quote
[35:39] back to your father father I would that
[35:41] she be where I
[35:46] am
[35:47] [Music]
[35:49] amen so Christ wants to have the
[35:52] preeminence in our life now remember all
[35:54] that was in God he pour into Christ and
[35:56] all that was in Christ he poured into
[35:58] his church am so we can give praise
[36:01] glory to God through songs Through words
[36:03] writings we know that but the best way
[36:05] to let a amen the best way is to let his
[36:10] glory come
[36:12] down amen through our
[36:16] lives so God God will appreciate the
[36:18] songs God will appreciate the
[36:21] testimonies of you giving him glory but
[36:24] I'm saying there's a higher form of
[36:25] Glory for you
[36:27] you can glorify God in a greater way is
[36:30] when you
[36:31] said let the beauty of Jesus be seen in
[36:36] me amen fill my way every day with love
[36:41] yes Lord as I walk with the
[36:44] Heavenly you should say Lord Reveal Your
[36:47] Glory through me these are your hands
[36:51] touch through them heal through them
[36:54] this is your feet possess territory fre
[36:57] through
[36:58] them walk oh

[37:04] tongue this is your tongue speak the
[37:06] words amen speak my Lord speak my Lord
[37:11] speak and I'll be quick to answer thee
[37:14] these are your ears I will shut my ears
[37:17] to every ungodly thing I will open up my
[37:20] ear to he that hasn't hear Let Him hear
[37:22] what the spirit is saying to the
[37:25] church these are your eyes
[37:28] Lord this is your eyes amen even though
[37:32] she looks like a Coca-Cola bottle I will
[37:36] not lust Lord these are your
[37:40] eyes amen praise the Lord amen some like
[37:47] buddies amen we can give glory to God
[37:51] through songs we said but the greatest
[37:53] form that you can let him Express his
[37:55] glory through you is to say say Lord
[37:57] unveil yourself through me hallelujah
[37:59] amen so I lay down my own will my own
[38:02] plan I invite you to sit on the throne
[38:04] of my
[38:07] heart so that you can fulfill your will
[38:10] for my life and complete the plan you
[38:12] have for me I feel that we should say
[38:14] that say Lord I lay down my own will
[38:16] Lord I lay down my own will I invite you
[38:19] I invite you to set up your throne set
[38:21] up your throne in my heart in my heart
[38:23] so that you can fulfill so that you can
[38:26] fulfill your will your will for my life
[38:29] for my life and complete the plan
[38:31] complete the plan you have for me you
[38:33] have for me shine your light through me
[38:35] I want you to know that you are God's
[38:37] most prized
[38:42] possession you are the most prized
[38:44] possession now at the end
[38:48] time all creation is resting on
[38:51] you coming to
[38:54] Perfection to reveal the glory of of God
[38:57] Amen Christ is going to present himself
[38:59] a glorious church amen and I I say it's
[39:03] already started through 7 Church ages we
[39:06] are now at the
[39:07] Pinnacle amen that's right and they
[39:10] without us cannot be made perfect so the
[39:13] they are waiting on us yes
[39:18] amen you know you know the person you're
[39:20] crying about you are grieving about that
[39:24] you
[39:25] lost hear me
[39:27] now and maybe over the next few years we
[39:30] don't know how long the Lord may take to
[39:32] come but you may lose loved ones you may
[39:36] go through deep
[39:38] depression Darkness
[39:40] sorrow there's nothing you can
[39:43] do to bring them
[39:45] back
[39:48] right and there's nothing you can do to
[39:51] go ahead of your time to them but the
[39:54] Bible says that all creation is waiting
[39:56] on you you
[39:57] am waiting for the manifestation of the
[40:00] sons of God even the one that you are
[40:02] crying about dead in the grave is
[40:05] waiting for you to come to your
[40:06] Perfection so they can get out of the
[40:10] [Music]
[40:14] Grave so you are God's most prized
[40:17] possession all that God owns or has
[40:19] control over whether dominions kingdoms
[40:22] principalities animal life plant life
[40:24] bird life fish life God doesn't want to
[40:28] uh Express his glory fully through
[40:30] them God doesn't want to fully incarnate
[40:33] himself in a
[40:36] lion God doesn't want to fully incarnate
[40:38] himself in
[40:40] uh in the big
[40:43] five he wants to fully incarnate himself
[40:46] in the highest form of
[40:51] creation you are the highest form of
[40:53] creation on the earth you are God's most
[40:55] beloved possession The Joy the Bible
[40:59] says the joy that was set before him he
[41:01] endured the
[41:04] cross he left heaven to redeem you now
[41:07] if you leave something valuable which is
[41:11] heaven all control all power all
[41:13] authority and come down to the Earth to
[41:17] redeem something on the earth then which
[41:19] one is more
[41:23] valuable the one that you're coming down
[41:25] for has more value
[41:28] for example if somebody kidnaps your
[41:30] child even though your your 5 million is
[41:32] valuable to you and you got that in the
[41:35] bank and they ask for a ransom of 5
[41:38] million you will give that 5 million so
[41:41] that you can redeem your son so which is
[41:44] more valuable the
[41:47] son Christ left everything for you I'm
[41:50] saying you are the most valuable
[41:52] possession he left it
[41:54] all amen
[41:59] so we read there what the glory was read
[42:02] John 1 now if we go to Revelation 13
[42:05] let's go to Revelation
[42:11] 13:8 you got to know that in the
[42:13] beginning you got to know the mystery
[42:15] between man and wife that's where we
[42:17] read Ephesians chapter 5 there
[42:19] right and all that that dwell upon the
[42:22] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[42:24] not written in the book of life of the
[42:27] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[42:34] world okay why are we reading this I
[42:38] want you to extract a truth in this
[42:41] verse there are names written in the
[42:43] Book of
[42:44] Life in the Lamb's Book of Life and the
[42:48] lamb was slain from before the
[42:50] foundation of the world and Jesus is
[42:52] saying glorify me with the glory that I
[42:54] had with you from before the foundation
[42:56] of of the
[42:59] world now you got to know that you are a
[43:02] hidden Mystery in
[43:04] God Amen you are hidden Mystery in
[43:07] Christ so when Christ is saying glorify
[43:09] me with the glory that I had with you
[43:11] from before the foundation of the
[43:13] world is unlocking a hidden mystery
[43:16] about the
[43:18] bride because there was also somebody
[43:21] else's name in the book of life before
[43:23] the foundation of the
[43:25] world
[43:31] what am I talking about you can find the
[43:33] hidden Mystery in Adam and Eve Eve was
[43:35] locked up inside of Adam
[43:37] yes the bride was locked up inside of
[43:39] Christ
[43:41] amen the woman was locked up in a man
[43:45] and revealed when Adam was put to sleep
[43:47] and taken from his side when Adam had
[43:49] Glory with God at the beginning Eve when
[43:52] he inside of
[43:55] him
[43:56] before Eve was taken out the glory of
[43:58] God would come and
[44:00] Adam had the glory of God but Eve was
[44:03] inside of
[44:05] him not yet expressed but she was part
[44:08] of him but the Bible is clear to state
[44:10] that in spirit the man was both male and
[44:14] female she was always a part of his
[44:17] being Man created in the image of God
[44:20] now man taken from the side amen woman
[44:23] taken from the side of man so we know
[44:26] that man is in the image of God and
[44:29] woman is in the image of
[44:31] a
[44:33] man and all the sisters
[44:38] said amen man is in the image of God
[44:41] woman is in the image of a man
[44:45] right so we find here man in his right
[44:49] mind and right position in Christ as
[44:51] Christ The Head and the woman being
[44:54] submissive to the man amen amen
[44:56] hallelujah and the children being
[44:58] submissive to parents that's God's order
[45:00] for the
[45:01] family
[45:03] amen you see you'll never win you'll
[45:06] never win at home if your home is in
[45:09] turmoil if this order is not there if a
[45:12] woman is not sub submissive or subject
[45:15] to the husband there there will not be a
[45:17] peace and Harmony in that home if a man
[45:20] doesn't love his wife according to how
[45:21] the Bible is saying and give himself for
[45:23] the family that there will be no peace
[45:26] in the home if the children are unruly
[45:28] and not obeying the parents there will
[45:29] be no peace in the home therefore we
[45:32] take the word of God and we submit under
[45:34] the word and we follow the guideline of
[45:36] the word but that man must also have a
[45:39] head which is
[45:41] Christ he must be under subjection of
[45:47] Christ watch now as in the Statue of a
[45:50] perfect man I think you saw that
[45:52] pictures now so it
[45:54] says God has place these things into the
[45:57] church talking about those seven virtues
[46:00] and patent it by showing that each
[46:03] individual has these possesses these
[46:08] qualities each individual possesses this
[46:11] these qualities it's very important why
[46:13] I'm reading this now
[46:15] amen right so the man who possesses all
[46:18] of these qualities here's what he saying
[46:20] this
[46:22] being when it's
[46:24] completed
[46:26] is the Church of God going to
[46:32] Rapture everybody caught there you want
[46:35] to know who's going I'm telling you
[46:36] who's going in the Rapture
[46:39] Amen brother Bram is telling
[46:42] you this being when it's completed with
[46:45] all seven virtues and headstone coming
[46:47] down is the Church of God going to
[46:49] Rapture and this being Inc completed is
[46:52] a servant of God in the Church of God
[46:56] that's going in the Rapture amen
[47:02] amen so if you if you ever ask yourself
[47:05] the question I wonder if I'm going in
[47:06] the Rapture measure yourself against
[47:08] that
[47:10] image if you are lining after that image
[47:13] you are going in the Rapture amen that's
[47:16] the image God is taking into the Rapture
[47:18] like I said before the only one going
[47:20] into the Rapture is
[47:22] Jesus that image is the life of Jesus
[47:24] Christ amen amen praise the
[47:29] Lord here here again to reiterate so
[47:32] when you surrender your complete being
[47:35] then the Holy Spirit just pours through
[47:36] you in these virtues then you're a
[47:39] living Tabernacle then people look and
[47:42] say that's a man full of virtue
[47:44] knowledge he believes the word
[47:46] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[47:48] kindness full of the love of the Holy
[47:50] Ghost see there he is walking around
[47:53] what is it a stature that that
[47:55] unbelievers can look and say there is a
[47:58] Christian amen there is a man or a woman
[48:00] who knows what they're talking about you
[48:02] never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier
[48:07] person you're sealed a sealed shows on
[48:10] both sides whether you're going or
[48:12] coming you see the seal just the same
[48:15] there you are when a man or woman
[48:16] possesses this then the Capstone comes
[48:19] down and seals them into the kingdom of
[48:21] God which is the Holy Ghost
[48:23] hallelujah thank you Lord
[48:27] then the word coming from here manifests
[48:29] itself to each one of these beings you
[48:32] see the word wants to manifest himself
[48:34] through each one of these beings and
[48:36] makes this complete being a tabernacle
[48:38] of the Living God a walking living
[48:41] example of
[48:42] Christianity what Christ was these
[48:45] people are because his life is in there
[48:48] amen amen they are in Christ and their
[48:52] life is dead and it in Christ through
[48:54] God and sealed in there by the Holy
[48:57] Ghost you reckon yourself dead then
[48:59] you're born of Faith then virtue and all
[49:02] these other things is added to your
[49:04] perfect living image of God
[49:09] am then God through that he brought also
[49:12] seven Church ages
[49:14] right seven steps that he brought
[49:17] building his individual Into His Image
[49:19] he's built a complete Church in His
[49:20] image and at the resurrection this
[49:23] complete body will be raised up to live
[49:25] with him forever because it is a
[49:30] bride
[49:33] amen here's what I'm saying now I I said
[49:35] this earlier but here's the quote he
[49:37] says these people who died in here are
[49:40] depending and waiting on
[49:51] us how many if you know a loved one who
[49:53] died in
[49:54] Christ

[50:03] new movie came
[50:05] out these people are depending and
[50:08] waiting on
[50:13] us so this church has got to come to
[50:15] Perfection

[50:20] a thing after the
[50:21] Rapture yes that's right amen yes some
[50:25] people only believe they'll be perfected
[50:27] only in the new body yeah what the
[50:29] prophet is saying these people are
[50:31] waiting on us depending on us so this
[50:35] church has got to come to Perfection
[50:38] Amen in order to bring
[50:42] what the resurrection and they under
[50:46] Souls under the altar waiting for the
[50:48] church to come to its Perfection then
[50:50] when Christ does
[50:53] come and up here when the pyramid cap
[50:55] does come the pyramid itself the body of
[50:58] Christ will have to be honed not just
[51:00] some Creed or doctrine or something
[51:02] other will come through it'll have to be
[51:04] so perfectly like Christ till when he
[51:06] comes he and that ministry will fit
[51:08] right smack together then will come the
[51:11] Rapture the
[51:17] homegoing I'm closing now and I'm going
[51:19] to close with the story I'm talking
[51:21] about a glorious Church the prophet saw
[51:24] a preview of The Bride and he saw the
[51:26] first church come up and she was a
[51:27] glorious
[51:29] Church she was a church full of Power
[51:32] full of authority she was marching to
[51:34] the bead of honored Christian Soldiers
[51:36] she was marching in rank and file she
[51:38] was dressed properly a garment was white
[51:41] and spotted undefiled oh yes amen but he
[51:45] says then he he saw this church come up
[51:47] and then he says he saw the mor Church
[51:49] come again he saw the modern Church come
[51:53] and then he saw that she was like a
[51:55] witch dancing to rock and roll music and
[51:58] she didn't have any clothes on and she
[51:59] had two pieces of of I don't know what
[52:01] it was but she was covering a back in a
[52:03] front and she was walking he says I've
[52:05] never seen such a more vulgar
[52:09] sight you go look at most churches today
[52:11] and you'll see what the prophet
[52:13] saw
[52:18] vulgar and he said Lord he didn't want
[52:21] to look
[52:23] anymore and he said this church well
[52:25] went this way and it went on down and
[52:28] then he says all at once I heard that
[52:29] music come back
[52:31] again he says it was a music like a beat
[52:36] similar to Onward Christian
[52:38] Soldiers and he saw this bride coming up
[52:41] again and she was she was the like the
[52:44] same church that you saw at the
[52:47] beginning remember Christ in the true
[52:49] church is a continuation of the book of
[52:51] Acts he saw a dress the same he saw
[52:56] March the same he saw her with the same
[52:58] power the same Authority amen and as
[53:01] she's marching and going he says I saw
[53:03] one or two of them get out of
[53:06] line and I screamed stay in line amen he
[53:10] says as I'm screaming stay in line he
[53:12] says I came out of this
[53:15] thing so I'm showing you there's a
[53:18] glorious church

[53:51] wrinkle he's coming for it a word
[53:53] Vindicated bride should be a little
[53:56] bitty group as in the days of Noah where
[53:59] in eight Souls were saved so shall it be
[54:01] in the coming of the son of
[54:03] man you're in the message recognizing

[56:09] holy
[56:12] spirit that we have worked in a small
[56:14] measure while The Headstone is coming
