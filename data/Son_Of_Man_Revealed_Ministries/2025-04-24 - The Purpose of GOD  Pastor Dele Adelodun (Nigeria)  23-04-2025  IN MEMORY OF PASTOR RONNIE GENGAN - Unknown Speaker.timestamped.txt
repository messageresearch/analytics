[37:24] quickening. And if there are those who

[37:57] I will request that we read our Bible so
[38:01] we can take the comfort of our seats and
[38:04] we shall trust God for what he has for
[38:06] us. Amen. Amen. Uh if you go home, I
[38:10] want you to read Romans chapter 9. Uh
[38:13] it's a background uh to what we are
[38:17] looking at tonight. But I'm just going
[38:19] to read a verse from the book of Romans
[38:21] chapter 8 verse 28.
[38:24] Romans 8:28. Amen. For tonight. Amen.
[38:38] And I will take another one verse from

[39:10] Okay. Amen. So it is not everybody that
[39:13] all things work together for good.
[39:15] Hallelujah. It's just a category of
[39:17] people.
[39:19] Okay. All right. God will help us. Yes.
[39:22] Amen. And um Proverbs chapter 19 verse
[39:27] 21. Proverbs 19:21.
[39:39] There are many devices in a man's heart.
[39:44] Nevertheless, the council of the Lord
[39:47] that shall stand. Amen. May the Lord add
[39:51] his blessings to the reading of his holy

[40:07] uh to be back in the house of the Lord.
[40:09] Amen. And I appreciate God. Yes. Amen. I
[40:14] also appreciate the kindness of Pastor
[40:16] Hrien to have bid us to come to the
[40:19] house of the Lord. Amen. And they
[40:21] created this platform to be of service.
[40:24] I believing that somewhere along the
[40:26] line we can be of a blessing. Amen. Yes.
[40:29] And I want to appreciate all the
[40:31] servants of God who are in the house
[40:34] tonight. Amen. May the Lord bless you.
[40:37] All the brethren, brothers, sister,
[40:38] families, may God bless you. Your coming
[40:42] is an encouragement. Amen. And I
[40:44] personally do not take it for granted
[40:47] and I trust to God that uh we shall be
[40:50] blessings uh to one another tonight.
[40:52] Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[40:56] Uh for me uh this was where my
[41:01] uh fellowship and relationship in South
[41:03] Africa began. Amen. Some 20 years ago.
[41:07] So coming here gave me a feeling of
[41:10] nostalgia and uh it went deep also
[41:14] because the man who saw it fit uh to
[41:18] invite me without even knowing me. Yeah.
[41:21] He said I just heard about you and I
[41:24] something told me invite that brother
[41:27] and he kept you know there those were
[41:30] the days not of a GSM per say in our
[41:34] side so you use all these landline phone
[41:36] and letters and it kept you know the
[41:39] temple until I gave a response to come
[41:43] and uh that was how my journey to South
[41:45] Africa began some 20 years ago. Amen.
[41:48] And uh I'm so thankful to God uh that I
[41:52] met him and I know I will meet him
[41:54] again. So tonight I want to dedicate a
[41:57] message to his memory. Amen. If you
[41:59] don't mind, but it will be a blessing to
[42:01] you. We can preach to him. Amen. He's
[42:04] had all the sermons. Yes. And he's
[42:07] preached all the sermons. He's gotten
[42:09] everything he needed for perfection.
[42:11] Amen. And that is why God's appointed
[42:13] time, the Lord took him away. Amen. God
[42:16] cannot take us before our time.
[42:19] Absolutely impossible. Amen. Yeah. So
[42:22] tonight I want to speak on the purpose
[42:24] of God. Amen. Amen. So So I'm
[42:27] remembering my friend Pastor Ron Genga.
[42:30] All right. The Lord bless you. Uh this
[42:33] afternoon we had a very nice time with
[42:36] uh Pastor Denzel. Amen. So we welcome
[42:38] you back from Zimbabwe. Welcome Pastor
[42:40] Denzel.
[42:46] with his wife. It was a sweet fellowship
[42:48] just as I've had with other pastors like
[42:50] Pastor Eko several times with pastor
[42:54] Marvin and many times with pastor Adrien
[42:58] and I think some few other brethren.
[43:01] Amen. I was thinking tonight we should
[43:03] have add the missionary report first
[43:08] before I go into the preaching. But
[43:11] nevertheless, I'm sure uh the Lord was
[43:14] so kind to his servants. Uh you will
[43:17] hear it later. We have had our portion
[43:20] and we certainly enjoyed it. It was a
[43:23] sweet fellowship this afternoon and we
[43:25] are thankful to God for that and we
[43:28] appreciate you sir for your time and all
[43:31] that you did your spending to give us
[43:33] some comfort. Amen. Amen. So God bless
[43:36] you saints. And uh I don't know if Mama
[43:40] Genan is in tonight. No, she's not. Oh,
[43:42] she's not in tonight. All right. Okay.
[43:45] The Lord bless everyone of you. Thank
[43:47] you. Okay. So, tonight we are speaking
[43:50] on the purpose of God. Amen. And um the
[43:57] prophet in the message Why Christ speak
[44:01] uh this struck me I think 63 dash
[44:06] 0714M paragraph
[44:09] 43 paragraph
[44:11] 43 he said God has got a purpose of you
[44:16] being here. Yes. Amen. Amen. See, if you
[44:21] can only be get to that place or in
[44:25] other words, get to that purpose. Yes.
[44:29] How much trouble you save God and
[44:32] yourself to. Hallelujah. That struck me
[44:35] deeply. Amen. That we get ourselves into
[44:39] troubles. Yes, sir. We get ourselves
[44:41] into challenges. Yes. We forfeit our
[44:44] peace. Amen. because we couldn't find
[44:47] our purpose.
[44:50] Now, let me say this firsthand as we go
[44:52] along.
[44:56] One of the terrible mistakes we are
[44:58] making or we can make in life is to
[45:01] think that as individuals we can develop
[45:05] or design a purpose for our life.
[45:10] Amen. We can't.
[45:13] If you study the spoken word books, if
[45:16] you study the prophet, you hardly will
[45:19] ever see anywhere. I'm just saying that
[45:21] to give imagine of possibility. Yes.
[45:24] Where you will ever hear the prophet
[45:26] counseling you go and develop a purpose
[45:30] for your life.
[45:34] And I will tell you why tonight. You can
[45:36] only discover a purpose of your
[45:40] existence. Yes. You hear the prophet
[45:43] saying if we can find our purpose.
[45:47] So in life we are on a journey of
[45:49] discovery. Amen. If you can find our
[45:52] purpose not if we can develop a purpose.
[45:57] And the reason is very simple.
[46:00] You are not your maker.
[46:04] It takes the maker Yes. to fashion a
[46:08] purpose. That's right. A maker makes
[46:11] something because a need has been
[46:14] created.
[46:17] Take for instance this microphone here.
[46:20] That's right. Somebody sat down and
[46:23] thought that the way people are shouting
[46:25] to reach the audience.
[46:28] It's not good enough. Yes. Let us do
[46:31] something that will amplify the voice of
[46:35] the speaker. No matter how low he
[46:38] speaks, there are even some microphones.
[46:41] You just talk gently without exerting
[46:44] any energy and your voice is going.
[46:49] You understand? So it was the need that
[46:51] was discovered. That inspired a purpose.
[46:55] Amen. You understand? And it is that
[46:58] purpose that needs to be met. Yes. That
[47:01] inspired the creation of this one. Amen.
[47:05] Are we together? Yeah. So this
[47:07] microphone cannot design or develop a
[47:10] purpose for itself
[47:13] is somebody who created that purpose.
[47:17] And created the product to serve that
[47:20] purpose.
[47:22] So what this one does is to just blend
[47:25] into its own purpose. And you say is
[47:28] useful.
[47:30] It's useful because it's serving the
[47:32] purpose. Amen. You will be useful in the
[47:34] kingdom when you begin to serve your
[47:36] purpose. Hallelujah.
[47:40] I think uh that's very simple enough.
[47:44] Amen. So that will tell you and I
[47:46] firsthand that none of us is an
[47:49] accidental discharge.
[47:52] Amen. Thank you Jesus. Even if your
[47:55] parents thought that your conception was
[47:57] a mistake, to them it was a mistake.
[48:01] Yes. To God, it's an election.
[48:04] Amen. The prophet said natural birth is
[48:07] more mysterious than even the virgin
[48:09] birth of Christ. Hallelujah. Because
[48:12] millions of life competed to be the
[48:14] conception. But by election, it was you
[48:17] that was chosen. And every other lives
[48:20] that were competing had to succumb. Yes.
[48:24] For you to be the one to be the
[48:26] consumption. Amen. So you were one in a
[48:29] million. Amen. That cannot be a chance
[48:32] event. That cannot be an accidental
[48:35] event. There is a purpose to that. Amen.
[48:38] Yes, Lord.
[48:40] So, everybody sitting here tonight, you
[48:42] are a child of purpose. Amen.
[48:47] Amen. Amen. Amen. And the prophet said,
[48:50] "Whatever serves the purpose of God
[48:54] will have a better resurrection." Amen.
[48:57] No, no, no. He didn't use the word
[48:58] better. Yes. He said we'll have a
[49:00] resurrection.
[49:02] Let me put it like he put it. Yes. Amen.
[49:06] Whatever serves the purpose of God would
[49:09] have a resurrection.
[49:11] Now by that I want to bring something in
[49:14] purpose.
[49:16] There are two aspects to God's purpose
[49:18] in life.
[49:20] There are those who will help God to
[49:22] serve a purpose.
[49:25] They will serve a purpose for God. Yes.
[49:29] But they are not in the purpose of God.
[49:35] Follow me closely. No complication. You
[49:37] will get it. There are some people who
[49:40] will serve the purpose of God.
[49:44] Amen. Amen. But there are people who
[49:46] will serve a purpose for God. Let me
[49:49] give you an example.
[49:52] The prophet talked about Pharaoh not
[49:54] even have a a real permanent record in
[49:57] the book of life. Do you realize that?
[49:59] Amen. Because it was just a creation to
[50:02] do a purpose to do something for
[50:05] and be deleted. Amen. That's right. Did
[50:08] you catch that? He said, "For this cause
[50:11] did I raise up Pharaoh
[50:13] to show my power?" Yes. Amen. You
[50:17] understand? God wanted to express
[50:19] himself because he made a promise to
[50:21] father Abraham your children will
[50:23] sojourn in a land that is not there and
[50:27] after uh for 400 years and
[50:31] afterwards in other word 400 years will
[50:34] be complete
[50:37] so any time after 400 years he said I
[50:40] the Lord will bring him them out by a
[50:43] mighty hand for the deliverance to be
[50:46] mighty God had to create a pharaoh
[50:49] whose heart he will have him. So as to
[50:53] confirm and fulfill that word exactly
[50:56] the way he promised Abraham.
[51:00] So Pharaoh served a purpose for God. But
[51:04] he himself is not in the purpose of God.
[51:08] Amen.
[51:10] He made Exodus possible.
[51:13] He made Exodus exciting. Yes. He gave us
[51:16] the privilege to see the two arms of
[51:18] redemption. Redemption by blood,
[51:21] redemption by power. Pharaoh facilitated
[51:24] it. But he never parttook in redemption.
[51:29] Amen. Because he wasn't in the purpose
[51:31] of God. He was only raised to help God
[51:34] do something so that God can achieve his
[51:37] aim. That's right. So those category of
[51:40] people are serving a purpose for God.
[51:42] Absolutely. But there's a category that
[51:44] are in the purpose of God. People for
[51:48] whom God will do all these things and
[51:50] they will be the beneficiaries.
[51:53] Amen. Are you catching it here? In the
[51:56] message, Christ is the mystery of God
[51:58] revealed. The prophet said, "God has a
[52:01] three-fold plan or three-fold purpose."
[52:04] That's right. First, to reveal himself.
[52:06] Yes. Which we know he did through the
[52:08] body called Christ. Is that right? Amen.
[52:11] Then he said number two to have
[52:13] preeminence.
[52:15] So it will go from Christ to the body of
[52:17] Christ which is you. Amen. When Christ
[52:21] could have your total you. When you will
[52:24] come to a point of believing the word
[52:26] without question. Amen. When you cannot
[52:28] do anything until you know what the word
[52:30] says about you. It's not just in you to
[52:33] rebel against any aspect of the word.
[52:36] Amen. As you take on the word day by
[52:37] day, you are losing canal identity. Yes.
[52:40] You are taking on your real identity.
[52:42] Amen. You are reflecting the word image.
[52:47] Yes sir. Amen. Amen. And by that you
[52:51] have been restored. Yes. Back to the
[52:54] beginning. The fullness of adoption.
[52:57] Amen. The readiness to manifest your
[52:59] son. Hallelujah. If you experience those
[53:03] blessings. Amen. Amen. Yes. If you have
[53:05] the true revelation of the Godhead and
[53:08] you see yourself in the Godhead.
[53:11] [Applause]
[53:14] You know, we always talk about the
[53:15] Godhead of Jesus and God being one, but
[53:18] we don't know we are part of it.
[53:20] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. We
[53:24] fellowship around some aspect of it this
[53:26] afternoon. Amen. Amen. You know, John
[53:29] 14. Yes. It started with I and my father
[53:33] are one. Amen. Amen. Is that right? But
[53:36] if you move further, Yes. Jesus began to
[53:38] admonish you to accept the word. He
[53:41] said, "If you obey me, if you love me,
[53:44] keep my commandments, what is he going
[53:47] to achieve?" He's going to bring you
[53:48] into that godhead. Amen. That's right.
[53:52] Then it will now be you will know that I
[53:55] am in you and you are in me. Amen. Amen.
[53:59] And if you abide in me and my word abide
[54:02] in you, you will do what? Amen. Ask
[54:05] anything. A blanket check. You will open
[54:09] your mouth. Yes. And heaven will
[54:11] respond. Amen. Say ask anything. You
[54:14] will receive opportunity without limit.
[54:17] A blessing without border. Amen.
[54:20] Hallelujah. Are you feeling that? Do you
[54:23] think you are in that? Then you are in
[54:25] the purpose of God. Hallelujah.
[54:29] Amen. Hallelujah.
[54:32] It's not everybody that we feel that
[54:34] friend. Absolutely.
[54:37] Because coming into this economy, the
[54:40] prophet said you come by three things.
[54:42] Amen. Spiritual food in due season.
[54:46] He said you've got to be fornown of God.
[54:49] Amen. Before the foundation of the
[54:51] world. So election is not scary to us.
[54:54] Yes. The word predestination is not
[54:57] scary. The word forn knowledge is not
[54:59] scary. We are the essence of all those
[55:01] things. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:05] Amen. Are you with me, brother? Amen. So
[55:07] he said you come by by being fornown of
[55:11] God before the foundation of the world.
[55:12] Yes. Then to manifest.
[55:17] Yes. Your ordination. Amen. He said the
[55:21] Lord must call you. Amen. He must call
[55:24] you by himself.
[55:26] Amen. Because that's the only lasting
[55:28] call. Let me tell you, God's calling has
[55:31] been very supernatural. Amen. If I give
[55:34] everybody microphone tonight, you can
[55:36] share the experience. Absolutely. Of how
[55:38] the Lord brought to you. And you will
[55:40] know how supernatural that you are.
[55:43] Amen. No pastor call you. No papa call
[55:46] you. No mama call you. Not even your
[55:49] husband, not even your wife, not even
[55:52] your parents. Amen. God has to call you.
[55:57] And the only people he calls are those
[55:59] who were in him. Amen. Who were in his
[56:02] thoughts, those who rotated off of his
[56:05] body, those who were not deceived in his
[56:08] mind in the beginning and cannot be
[56:10] deceived in their manifestation on their
[56:13] life. Those are the people he called.
[56:17] Yes. Absolutely.
[56:21] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Can you imagine
[56:23] how he called this disciples? Amen. I
[56:27] saw Christ one day wanting to call Levi
[56:31] or Matthew. The guy was a tax collector.
[56:34] Amen. And I can imagine Jesus killed
[56:38] behind every people who want to pay tax.
[56:41] And they was coming and the man was
[56:44] saying how much tax show me your tax
[56:46] card and he calculated you need to pay
[56:49] 22,000 rand sir it's too much master
[56:52] help me I just okay okay let's see what
[56:54] we can do for you 16,000 rand your money
[56:57] is it cash or
[56:58] card you give them receipt and Jesus was
[57:02] on the queue and when it comes to the
[57:04] turn of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ said
[57:07] MM get up and follow me
[57:11] Glory.
[57:14] Yes, sir. Amen. He dropped all the
[57:16] booklets. He dropped his career. Yes.
[57:19] His pension. His graduating program. His
[57:23] compensation or whatever you want.
[57:24] Hallelujah. He dropped everything. And
[57:27] they started
[57:28] following his collection. What's going
[57:31] on? Said I'm following the master. Are
[57:33] you crazy? He said, yes. I've got to be
[57:36] out of my mind and follow this. Amen.
[57:39] Yes, you are right. I'm crazy. Out of my
[57:42] mind. It was a supernatural.
[57:46] It left all. And they followed. Amen.
[57:49] Look at Peter, James, and John. Yes.
[57:51] They followed when they achieved the
[57:53] biggest business success. Time will me
[57:56] to show that tonight. I think that's
[57:57] Luke 5 or Luke 10. It was when they add
[58:00] the highest cash. Jesus told them, I
[58:03] will make you features of men. They
[58:06] abandoned that success. Yeah, those
[58:08] plenty fishes that day and started
[58:11] following because the Lord called.
[58:14] So his calling has been supernatural.
[58:17] When the Lord is ready for you and he
[58:20] call at your appointed season. Amen. Let
[58:22] me tell you nothing can hold you down.
[58:26] Lord of God is too powerful.
[58:29] [Applause]
[58:31] So he must call you. And how does he
[58:34] call? The prophet said he calls by his
[58:36] words. Amen. Yes. Hallelujah.
[58:38] Hallelujah. When the book was opened.
[58:42] Yes. It revealed names. Amen. Yes.
[58:47] So each night is a roll call.
[58:52] Hallelujah. It may not sound like Peter.
[58:54] Yes. But Peter will hear his name. Amen.
[58:59] And there will be from that time
[59:02] because he was called by the word of the
[59:05] Lord.
[59:07] Yes. Amen. We love him tonight. So
[59:10] people who came by those experience
[59:14] are in the purpose. Yes. Of God. God.
[59:19] Those who facilitated that experience
[59:23] without being a beneficiary of it. Yes.
[59:27] Are serving a purpose for God. Amen.
[59:31] Some people are ordained to be attached
[59:34] to your life. Yes. to do something.
[59:37] Amen. Amen. Someone will provoke you.
[59:39] Yes. To bring the best out of you. Not
[59:42] the worst. Not the worst. Because you
[59:44] learn obedience by the things you Amen.
[59:48] You are fashioned in his image. Through
[59:50] the things that you go through, they
[59:53] might not be part of it. Yes. But they
[59:56] are designed to bring you to that
[59:57] blessing. Amen. So they are serving a
[1:00:00] purpose for God. Yes. So that the one
[1:00:03] who is in the purpose of God could be
[1:00:05] perfected to achieve his Yes, Lord.
[1:00:09] Amen. Is that clear to us? Amen. Now,
[1:00:12] these two category of people will have a
[1:00:16] resurrection. Yes. Yes. Amen. That's
[1:00:19] right. That's the level I'm taking into.
[1:00:22] Because anyhow, whether on the negative
[1:00:25] or on the positive, everybody is serving
[1:00:27] the purpose of God. But let me put it
[1:00:30] like this. Those who are in the purpose
[1:00:32] of God will have a better resurrection.
[1:00:36] Amen.
[1:00:38] Hallelujah. I already establish that
[1:00:40] during the convention. That there's a
[1:00:42] resurrection that is better. It is the
[1:00:45] first resurrection. It comes with many
[1:00:47] benefits. That those who will rise up
[1:00:50] later will never get. Blessed be in the
[1:00:52] name of Amen. You love him tonight.
[1:00:55] Amen.
[1:00:59] Therefore, the things that you face in
[1:01:02] life,
[1:01:04] they happen to you not because of youth.
[1:01:09] They happen to you because of your
[1:01:11] purpose. Amen. Yes, sir. Wonderful. Are
[1:01:14] you taking not? That's right. If God
[1:01:18] brought you here for a purpose, Yes.
[1:01:20] Amen. Amen. Then he must design you.
[1:01:24] Yes.
[1:01:25] and put capacity in you for the purpose
[1:01:29] he wants you to serve.
[1:01:32] Listen, you need to understand this
[1:01:34] aspect. Yes. So you don't look
[1:01:36] miserable. Yes. Or you don't have, you
[1:01:40] know, the attitude of competition. Yes.
[1:01:42] Yes. In the body of Christ, we don't
[1:01:44] compete.
[1:01:46] Amen. Everybody has their different
[1:01:49] grace. Amen. And everybody has their
[1:01:52] different blessings. Amen. The prophet
[1:01:54] said, "No matter how important you think
[1:01:56] you are and how unimportant you think
[1:01:59] you are, you've got a purpose in the
[1:02:04] body." Amen.
[1:02:06] Look at these cars that we drive.
[1:02:10] They will call some cars maybe three
[1:02:12] cylinder,
[1:02:14] very small car, three cylinders.
[1:02:17] Some four cylinders. Yes. Some six
[1:02:20] cylinders. M there are vehicles
[1:02:22] articulated vehicles of 30 cylinders.
[1:02:27] Now the one with three cylinders has no
[1:02:30] business competing with the one with 30
[1:02:32] cylinders.
[1:02:35] They the manufacturers made them for
[1:02:38] different purposes.
[1:02:40] But if each of them serve their
[1:02:43] different purposes,
[1:02:46] as far as the owners are concerned, they
[1:02:49] are useful. Yes. And successful. Amen.
[1:02:52] Correct. Amen. Are you getting it? Amen.
[1:02:55] And that's the way we are in the body.
[1:02:57] That is why you know the scripture
[1:03:00] described us as a unit and they call
[1:03:02] some of us fingers. Right. He call some
[1:03:05] of us the eye. Yeah. Because whatever
[1:03:08] aspect, whatever part you are in the
[1:03:10] body, you have a purpose that is as
[1:03:13] important as the other. Amen.
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:17] Lord, take for instance the brain. If
[1:03:20] the brain settles down and say, I'm the
[1:03:22] one I'm the policy driver. I'm the
[1:03:26] architect of plans for this entire body.
[1:03:30] You can get to Durban without me,
[1:03:32] without me thinking about it. And they
[1:03:35] say go to Duban without me thinking
[1:03:37] about it. And we say Mr. Brain you did
[1:03:40] well. Okay brain think about it. Okay
[1:03:42] let's go to Dan.
[1:03:45] And the leg said Brain take yourself
[1:03:48] down.
[1:03:50] That day we know the importance of Mr.
[1:03:52] Leg.
[1:03:55] If Brain will ever get to go, he will
[1:03:57] beg the leg.
[1:03:59] That's right. So tell me which one is
[1:04:01] more important than the other. Yeah. All
[1:04:03] of them are equally in even to the nail
[1:04:07] on your finger. You pluck off this nail
[1:04:10] and see how sick you are going to be for
[1:04:12] this until it grows bad. They will have
[1:04:15] to put bandage some sort of cover here
[1:04:18] because infection can come from here and
[1:04:20] kill your entire body including your
[1:04:22] brain and your leg paralyze everything.
[1:04:25] So this name is very important
[1:04:31] and that is the way we are in the body.
[1:04:33] Amen. So let not everybody look at the
[1:04:36] pulpit. Yes. You can look at your corner
[1:04:38] here.
[1:04:40] If you can just find your purpose. Amen.
[1:04:45] Are you catching it? So there's no
[1:04:47] competition in the body. Amen. God
[1:04:51] designed everybody for the capacity he
[1:04:54] intended them to carry. If a
[1:04:56] threecylinder vehicle is trying to take
[1:04:58] the tons of load a 30 cylinder vehicle
[1:05:01] is carrying is ready for a crash. Amen.
[1:05:04] A loan accident because when you pack
[1:05:07] the load on it to start the engine and
[1:05:09] move everything will crack and
[1:05:10] disintegrate because it's going beyond
[1:05:13] his boundary. But if it carries the
[1:05:15] number of passengers, if it carries the
[1:05:17] number of load, the owner is happy with
[1:05:20] it. And you ask the owner about that
[1:05:22] kind say, I'm enjoying it. It's serving
[1:05:25] its purpose. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:29] Whether you are a first hour laborer or
[1:05:31] you are the 11th hour laborer, my savior
[1:05:34] gave them the same reward.
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:37] That's right. So no competition
[1:05:41] in the body. Amen. Amen. You love him
[1:05:44] tonight. Now, your
[1:05:47] purpose is what preserves you. And your
[1:05:51] purpose is what maintains you. Amen.
[1:05:56] Hallelujah. Yes. Let me go back to the
[1:05:58] car again. That's right. Now, yeah. If
[1:06:03] this car is working, functioning
[1:06:05] properly. Yes.
[1:06:08] Does the car worry about oil service?
[1:06:14] change of oil,
[1:06:16] clean the plugs, the service, the
[1:06:20] routine maintenance. Does the car worry
[1:06:22] about it? No, I'm asking you and you
[1:06:26] have to answer me.
[1:06:29] Does the car worry about it? Who worries
[1:06:32] about it? The owner. You agree with me?
[1:06:37] Who is your owner?
[1:06:39] Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] [Applause]
[1:06:45] If you don't get the things right,
[1:06:48] you'll be taking medicine for somebody's
[1:06:50] else's headache.
[1:06:55] Are you catching?
[1:06:58] You will be taking responsibility for
[1:07:01] God's business.
[1:07:03] And that is why life seem to be tough
[1:07:06] sometimes for you and I. Yes. because we
[1:07:09] don't get it. What you are called to do
[1:07:12] is serve your purpose. Your maintenance
[1:07:17] is in the hands of your owner.
[1:07:19] Hallelujah. That is why he said take no
[1:07:22] thought. Amen. Yes. How many ever read
[1:07:26] it in their Bible? Amen. It says seek ye
[1:07:28] first. Amen. The kingdom of God and it
[1:07:32] righteousness. In other words, get into
[1:07:34] your purpose. Amen. He said all other
[1:07:37] things. Everything that you need to
[1:07:40] facilitate your service, I will provide.
[1:07:43] Thank you, Lord. It's the same thing.
[1:07:46] Praise the Lord. It is the owner of the
[1:07:48] car that worries that keeps checking the
[1:07:50] time for when the dealer said it must be
[1:07:52] maintained. Is that right? Amen. All the
[1:07:55] car does is take you to wherever you are
[1:07:58] going.
[1:08:00] If the oil gets low, it's your problem.
[1:08:02] Yes. I see one thing. If the car looks
[1:08:06] very dirty and its owner looks very
[1:08:09] clean, immaculately impeccable in
[1:08:11] appearance,
[1:08:14] still who did they abuse for a dirty
[1:08:16] car?
[1:08:18] That's right. Answer me. They will say,
[1:08:21] "Ah, this man is dirty. Look at his
[1:08:24] car."
[1:08:27] But the man is clean. It is the car that
[1:08:29] is dirty. Is that right? So why is he
[1:08:33] being abused? Why is it been called
[1:08:35] dirty and not the car? Because he is
[1:08:39] responsible
[1:08:41] for that car. God is responsible for
[1:08:44] you. Amen. He knows his obligation. He
[1:08:48] is willing to take it. You must give him
[1:08:51] a chance.
[1:08:53] Amen. Oh, what peace we often forfeit.
[1:08:56] Oh, what needless pain we bear. Amen.
[1:09:00] Amen.
[1:09:02] Because we don't give God a right of
[1:09:03] way. God is under obligation. Amen. To
[1:09:08] see to it that you are clean. Yes. That
[1:09:11] you are pure, that you are holy. Amen.
[1:09:16] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:18] God is under obligation for your
[1:09:20] maintenance. Amen. That is why the
[1:09:22] prophet said he does not just save us.
[1:09:25] He sees to it that we remain saved.
[1:09:29] Glory. Yes. Are you catching it? It
[1:09:32] takes responsibility
[1:09:34] for those things. As long as you are
[1:09:36] functioning, cast all your cares. Amen.
[1:09:39] Yes, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:43] Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:09:46] So, the owner takes responsibility.
[1:09:50] Now, sorry, did I put it off?
[1:09:59] Can I continue? Yes. Okay. So, the owner
[1:10:03] takes responsibility for the vehicle,
[1:10:05] right? Amen. Then number two, this
[1:10:09] vehicle or let me take another thing.
[1:10:12] Just just give me I'm using it.
[1:10:15] This mic that we have here, we do not
[1:10:19] keep it here simply because we like it.
[1:10:25] We keep it here because it is
[1:10:27] functional. Do you see what just
[1:10:28] happened a while ago? The moment he
[1:10:31] couldn't amplify the voice, what
[1:10:33] happened? No use for him. No use for
[1:10:35] him. Thank you. It was quickly
[1:10:37] withdrawn.
[1:10:43] So what is preserving this mind? The
[1:10:46] purpose serving. Amen. Yes. Are you
[1:10:49] catching me? Amen. That is why the
[1:10:52] prophet said when my purpose is all done
[1:10:54] right I don't want to wait any second
[1:10:56] pastor Ronnie left because his purpose
[1:10:58] was
[1:11:00] Yes sir. And other pastors those
[1:11:03] servants of God. Amen. They left because
[1:11:05] they serve their purpose. Now you didn't
[1:11:09] define their purpose. Amen. And you
[1:11:11] didn't define their time. It is the one
[1:11:14] who brought them here
[1:11:16] that defined it and allocated duration.
[1:11:20] When he sees them in the mode of
[1:11:21] accomplishment, he block his flower. And
[1:11:24] that is the way it's going to do to all
[1:11:26] of us. Amen. What preserve us here is
[1:11:29] our purpose. You've just seen it now
[1:11:32] unconsciously.
[1:11:33] When the mic went off, it was removed
[1:11:35] from my hand. Because it's not serving
[1:11:38] the purpose. If it had any fault and
[1:11:41] they try to repair it and is not
[1:11:43] responding to repair, what are they
[1:11:45] going to do to it? Throw it away. Amen.
[1:11:48] And get another one. Yes. So your
[1:11:50] purpose is what preserves you. Amen.
[1:11:53] Thank you, Lord. That's right. Your
[1:11:55] purpose is what keeps you clean. Your
[1:11:58] purpose is the reason you are being
[1:12:00] maintained. Amen. Your purpose is the
[1:12:02] reason you are being protected. Your
[1:12:04] purpose is the reason you are being
[1:12:06] cared for. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. When
[1:12:10] the prophet accomplished his own
[1:12:12] purpose, he knew his purpose was done.
[1:12:14] Yes. Initially he said he saw Isaiah 56.
[1:12:18] is a quotation right then when he was
[1:12:22] when he hit that range he began to talk
[1:12:26] you know some of the things messages he
[1:12:28] began to bring you will see that he was
[1:12:30] winding down yes till the moment he
[1:12:32] preached the rapture yes and he observed
[1:12:35] communion which was the less earthly
[1:12:38] function of our lord himself before he
[1:12:41] left is that right then he preached the
[1:12:44] message invisible union he said
[1:12:46] thanksgiving message Amen. He wasn't
[1:12:49] doing a thanksgiving of America.
[1:12:52] He was doing a personal thanksgiving.
[1:12:54] He said because the purpose of which God
[1:12:57] brought me to establish a connection
[1:13:00] between that heavenly bridegroom and his
[1:13:03] earthly bride has been accomplished. He
[1:13:06] said and I want to thank God for it. And
[1:13:08] after I did thanksgiving in November,
[1:13:10] the Lord took him in December because
[1:13:13] his purpose was done. Amen. So what
[1:13:16] preserve you and I, what protect you and
[1:13:19] I is our purpose. That is why the
[1:13:22] prophet said you can take me on record.
[1:13:25] That the purpose of God can never be
[1:13:27] defeated. And nothing will take you and
[1:13:30] I until God's purpose for our life is
[1:13:33] accomplished. He said is a beautiful
[1:13:35] revelation of the scriptures.
[1:13:39] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:42] If you believe and accept all this so
[1:13:44] far. Amen. Let's watch some case
[1:13:46] studies. Amen. How many remember Joseph?
[1:13:49] Yes. You remember Joseph? Yes. Amen.
[1:13:54] Now, Joseph was born among 12 brothers.
[1:14:00] Is that right? Yes. Now, the first born
[1:14:03] of the family was Reuben.
[1:14:07] And being a firstborn, he's got three
[1:14:09] inheritances.
[1:14:11] He's got the priesthood.
[1:14:14] He's got the birthight. And he's got the
[1:14:17] rulership. Amen. Those three are the
[1:14:20] preserve of the firstborn.
[1:14:23] Are you with me? Yes. But the firstborn
[1:14:26] must prove must prove himself worthy.
[1:14:29] Yes. In order to retain those blessings.
[1:14:32] Amen. That was what Reuben failed to do.
[1:14:36] Yes.
[1:14:38] Amen. Reuben went to discover his
[1:14:40] father's bed. That's right. He committed
[1:14:43] fornication.
[1:14:46] The Bible said Jacob heard it. But he
[1:14:49] never said anything. He waited till such
[1:14:52] a time when he was ready to gathered
[1:14:55] with to be gathered to his people to do
[1:14:58] what? To to make a to visit that thing.
[1:15:01] Yes. If you watch Jacob, Jacob did not
[1:15:03] do like h go and bring me venison. Let I
[1:15:07] let me bless you before I go on before I
[1:15:10] pass on. He said he told all his
[1:15:14] children he said gather yourself. Yes.
[1:15:15] And let me tell you what what your life
[1:15:17] will be in the future.
[1:15:20] So for him it was more of a prophecy
[1:15:22] than prayer. Then it started with
[1:15:24] Reuben. He said the beginning of my
[1:15:27] strength the excellency of dignity.
[1:15:30] Amen. But as stable, as unstable as the
[1:15:33] waters, you will not excel because you
[1:15:36] discover your father beds.
[1:15:40] By that action of Reuben, he lost all
[1:15:43] the three blessings according to the
[1:15:46] scripture. He lost the birthight to
[1:15:49] Joseph, the priesthood to Levi, and the
[1:15:52] rulership to Judah.
[1:15:55] Amen. That was why the Lord giver, the
[1:15:57] Messiah, Yes. has to come from the tribe
[1:15:59] of Judah. All those things should have
[1:16:01] come from human. Amen. This is why the
[1:16:04] scripture warned us. He said, "Do not be
[1:16:06] a fornicator or a profane person." There
[1:16:10] are two people lost their birthight in
[1:16:12] the Bible. Esau and Reuben. Esau was
[1:16:15] profane. Wonderful. The prophet said
[1:16:18] profanity is taking divine instructions
[1:16:20] lightly. It's even your dictionary.
[1:16:23] Amen. He said he never believed that God
[1:16:25] meant what he said about the idea of
[1:16:27] birthright. And that was why he said,
[1:16:29] "What is this birthright?"
[1:16:32] Amen. He said they never believe the
[1:16:34] teaching of God on that. He He makes
[1:16:37] excuses. He takes divine instructions
[1:16:39] lightly. We must not do it. God give us
[1:16:42] conduct. Give us order. Give us do. We
[1:16:47] must not be like a about those things.
[1:16:50] We must hold them dearly. Yes, Lord. We
[1:16:53] must keep evil flies away from this
[1:16:55] evening sacrifice. It must not be
[1:16:58] contaminated.
[1:16:59] Glory to God. I hope I'm not sounding
[1:17:02] too hard. Amen. Amen. So, Isa forfeited
[1:17:07] his birthight because of profanity, but
[1:17:10] Reuben forfeited it because of
[1:17:12] fornication.
[1:17:13] Are you with me? Now when God was ready
[1:17:18] to reassign the birthight
[1:17:20] because the one who carries the
[1:17:22] birthight is supposed to be the provider
[1:17:25] the sucker
[1:17:27] the one who takes care of the entire
[1:17:30] brotherhood. Are you with me? Yes. The
[1:17:33] one to whom the father's wealth will
[1:17:35] come to and from him it will be
[1:17:38] appropriated to all. That is the
[1:17:40] blessing of birthright. So when Joseph
[1:17:43] had that dream, it was God's way of
[1:17:46] announcing to others the reassignment of
[1:17:49] birthright.
[1:17:51] Hallelujah. Are you catching it? Are you
[1:17:54] catching it? Because if you watch the
[1:17:56] prayers of Isaac over Jacob when they
[1:18:00] got the birthight, you can go and check
[1:18:01] this thing. I think Genesis 27:28
[1:18:04] somewhere there. If you watch that
[1:18:05] prayer, part of the prayer is that let
[1:18:08] your brothers,
[1:18:10] your children, your mother's children
[1:18:12] bow to thee and be out their be out
[1:18:16] their sakura, their this and that. And
[1:18:20] here was Joseph seeing a dream
[1:18:23] in a very verily I say unto you manner.
[1:18:27] The first time and the second time. The
[1:18:30] first time it was a it was sheav right?
[1:18:33] Yes. The ships of his brother were bound
[1:18:35] to his own ship. God was announcing and
[1:18:38] reassign the birthight. Amen. But those
[1:18:40] brothers were not spiritual enough to
[1:18:42] understand that. Are you with me? Then
[1:18:45] on the second occasion,
[1:18:47] it was the stars and the moon. Yes.
[1:18:50] Amen. The moon and the sun and 11 stars.
[1:18:53] Yes. I like it when somebody said even
[1:18:56] Joseph saw his brothers as stars. Yes.
[1:18:59] But because they were too carried away
[1:19:00] in complex, they didn't see themselves
[1:19:02] as stars.
[1:19:05] At least they were stars. Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] And they saw And they saw 11 stars
[1:19:12] and the sun and moon bowing to one star.
[1:19:16] Yes. God was confirming it. Yes. In the
[1:19:19] mouth of two or three witnesses, every
[1:19:22] truth will be established. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:25] The only person who took caution was
[1:19:28] Jacob himself. Yes. Being a prophet, he
[1:19:32] said, "Do you mean I and your mother, we
[1:19:34] also defer to you, bow to you? You be
[1:19:38] our caretaker." Yeah.
[1:19:41] But the Bible said Jacob laid it to his
[1:19:44] heart. Yes. He did not fuse with it.
[1:19:48] Because he was a prophet. And do you
[1:19:50] know the revelation he had? If it was
[1:19:53] the Lord who gave the boy,
[1:19:56] there is nothing that can defeat it.
[1:19:59] Amen.
[1:20:00] There is nothing that can change it.
[1:20:04] Then the battle began. By that dream, by
[1:20:07] that vision, by that revelation, God
[1:20:10] revealed the purpose of Joseph. Yes.
[1:20:13] That is where I'm going. Amen. And that
[1:20:15] purpose can never be defeated. Amen.
[1:20:19] Amen. The brothers of Joseph set out to
[1:20:22] defeat it. They said it with their own
[1:20:25] mouth. And you will see all the
[1:20:27] characteristics that we have seen on
[1:20:29] purpose fulfilling in Joseph. Now they
[1:20:32] all said it with their own mother. Let
[1:20:34] us see how it will come to pass. Amen.
[1:20:38] So first thing you must see that is that
[1:20:40] the challenges that began to happen to
[1:20:43] Joseph was not because it was Joseph. It
[1:20:46] was because of his purpose. Yes.
[1:20:49] Are you catching me? Things will happen
[1:20:52] to you in life. You must know why they
[1:20:54] are happening. If you don't know why
[1:20:56] they are happening, you won't show the
[1:20:58] right attitude.
[1:20:59] Joseph knew why those things were
[1:21:02] happening. That was why when his brother
[1:21:05] came to repent, he knew what they did.
[1:21:08] He said all these things that you people
[1:21:09] did, he said, brothers, do you know what
[1:21:11] it is? It was the sending of the Lord.
[1:21:14] Amen.
[1:21:15] Oh, hallelujah. It was the way God chose
[1:21:19] to send me to preserve life, to preserve
[1:21:22] your posterity.
[1:21:24] He knew his purpose. Hallelujah.
[1:21:28] Amen.
[1:21:30] He understood it. Amen. When you
[1:21:33] understand it, you will show the right
[1:21:34] attitude. You will be forgiven. You have
[1:21:37] a forgiven spirit. Amen. You will even
[1:21:39] appreciate the person. Thank you for
[1:21:41] driving me into my purpose. Amen. Do you
[1:21:44] see why you cannot frustrate a believer?
[1:21:46] That adversary person, you will say,
[1:21:48] "Thank you, my brother. If you hadn't
[1:21:50] done what you did, I wouldn't have been
[1:21:52] into this."
[1:21:54] Amen. Now, God showed Joseph what he was
[1:21:57] going to be, but he never showed him the
[1:22:00] path to get there. Hallelujah. Huh? Yes,
[1:22:03] Pastor M.
[1:22:05] He told you what you were going to be.
[1:22:08] He didn't show you how you will get
[1:22:09] there.
[1:22:11] But let me tell you, you will arise
[1:22:14] because the purpose of God can never be
[1:22:17] defeated.
[1:22:19] Hallelujah.
[1:22:22] They are going to bow. You are going to
[1:22:24] be their protection. You are going to be
[1:22:26] their provider. You are going to be
[1:22:27] their sustainer. Everything it looks
[1:22:29] great, isn't it? But how do I get there?
[1:22:33] Then the journey began. And in most
[1:22:36] cases, the journey does not look like
[1:22:38] Yes. That's right. So it becomes a
[1:22:40] puzzle. This is why believers must trust
[1:22:43] God. This is why the scripture said,
[1:22:45] "And we know it's a knowing." Amen. It
[1:22:49] has to come as a revelation. He said,
[1:22:51] "And we know that all things
[1:22:56] say all things." All. Okay. Let me give
[1:22:59] you revelation of all things inside all
[1:23:01] things there are positive. Yes. Inside
[1:23:04] all there are negative. Do you agree
[1:23:07] with that? Because most time when we say
[1:23:09] all our mind goes to the positive alone
[1:23:13] but inside all you have positive
[1:23:15] negative ambivalent ambivalent is
[1:23:18] neither positive nor negative
[1:23:19] indifferent it's the total combination
[1:23:23] they are summation is for your good
[1:23:27] oh church amen Jeremiah's saw two basket
[1:23:32] of figs how many ever read that
[1:23:35] it said This
[1:23:37] basket contains good figs. Very good.
[1:23:41] This one has bad things. Very bad. He
[1:23:44] said, "And the two baskets, the good and
[1:23:47] the bad, they are going to go into
[1:23:49] captivity. And God is not going to stop
[1:23:51] it." Yeah.
[1:23:54] He said, "But I like the scripture when
[1:23:55] he said the good basket, they are going
[1:23:58] into captivity for their good."
[1:24:01] Oh, come on, church. How can going how
[1:24:04] can captivity be for my good? Yeah. All
[1:24:07] things.
[1:24:09] You see why Paul said, "And we know."
[1:24:12] It's a knowing. That knowing there is
[1:24:14] deep. It's a revelation. Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] Amen. And he said these bad things are
[1:24:22] going into captivity for their evil.
[1:24:24] Amen.
[1:24:27] You know
[1:24:28] why? It takes it took that captivity. If
[1:24:32] you study it back in retrospect, it took
[1:24:36] that captivity to make some people
[1:24:39] immortal heroes today. Yes. There was no
[1:24:43] lion's den in Israel. Daniel need to be
[1:24:46] in captivity to face that. So that you
[1:24:49] can bear the name Daniel today.
[1:24:54] They were all product of captivity.
[1:24:57] The three uh Hebrew children were
[1:24:59] product of captivity. Esther was a
[1:25:02] product of captivity. Zerubbabel was a
[1:25:05] product of captivity. Ezra, Nemiah,
[1:25:08] Joshua,
[1:25:10] they were all product of captivity. If
[1:25:12] there was no captivity, you would never
[1:25:14] have known them today. They went into
[1:25:17] captivity for their good. And we know
[1:25:19] that all things.
[1:25:26] So this is why the Bible said, "Count it
[1:25:28] all joy when you fall into diverse
[1:25:30] temptation." It is not everything you
[1:25:32] fall into that is your making. Yes.
[1:25:34] That's right. Did you hear me? God
[1:25:36] throws some things at you because
[1:25:38] there's a virtue to be built somewhere.
[1:25:40] Amen.
[1:25:42] There's a grace to be developed.
[1:25:47] For us to come to rule and reign, we
[1:25:50] need character.
[1:25:52] The prophet says character is not a
[1:25:54] gift. Yes. Is a victory.
[1:25:58] Amen. Amen. So God will throw many
[1:26:00] things across your path in fashioning
[1:26:04] you. Amen. Before the ghost will see his
[1:26:07] reflection in gold, there will be
[1:26:09] thorough beaten. Amen. Amen. So don't
[1:26:12] allow the devil to work on your mind.
[1:26:15] And yours may be peculiar from mine. You
[1:26:18] know why? Our purposes may be different.
[1:26:21] Each will receive what it takes to
[1:26:24] fashion its own purpose. That is why
[1:26:26] that song says some through the waters,
[1:26:29] some through the fire, some through the
[1:26:31] flood. But guess what? All
[1:26:34] through the blood. The common
[1:26:37] denominator is the blood. You be under
[1:26:40] fire. You being your fire under the
[1:26:42] blood. Amen. You being your flood under
[1:26:44] the blood, I tell you, we all come out
[1:26:46] successful. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the
[1:26:49] Lord. Are you encouraged tonight?
[1:26:53] So,
[1:26:55] Joseph, the brother said, "Let's see how
[1:26:58] it's going to happen." And by that, God
[1:27:00] said, "I will use you guys to make it
[1:27:02] happen." Yeah. They plan to kill him.
[1:27:05] Reuben said, "Don't kill him." Yes.
[1:27:07] Reuben was the cause of all this
[1:27:08] problem. Yes. He was the one that saved
[1:27:10] Joseph from being killed. All in the
[1:27:13] plan of God. Amen. Then they said,
[1:27:14] "Let's throw him into the dungeon."
[1:27:16] Yeah. Amen. And Reuben's plan was that
[1:27:19] after all the brothers leave, he's going
[1:27:22] to fetch him and hand him over to the
[1:27:23] dad and say, "Take care of this boy. His
[1:27:25] life is at stake." Yes. But it's your
[1:27:28] shepherd that selected the path. Amen.
[1:27:33] As nice as Reuben's plan was, it wasn't
[1:27:36] the will of God. The will of God was for
[1:27:39] Joseph to be sold. So before Reuben
[1:27:43] could actualize that plan, these guys,
[1:27:46] the Arabian guys, God send them down.
[1:27:48] Yes.
[1:27:50] And the guy said, and the brother said,
[1:27:52] "It's evil good. This no use. This
[1:27:54] useless boy. Let's just get some money
[1:27:57] to buy some pizzas."
[1:28:00] And they sold him for 30, is it 30 or 20
[1:28:04] something shekels? Amen. And could you
[1:28:07] imagine Joseph being fetched out of the
[1:28:09] dungeon and seeing his brothers taking
[1:28:12] prize over his head? That's killing,
[1:28:14] isn't it? And being handed over mockery
[1:28:17] with derision. Go and become your ruler
[1:28:20] wherever. Bye-bye to nonsense. Good
[1:28:22] readers to bad rubbish. Enjoy your rule.
[1:28:26] And the guy was taken. But friends, that
[1:28:29] was the path.
[1:28:31] Everything was negative all the way. But
[1:28:34] each day was inching. Joseph closer to
[1:28:37] that purpose. Amen. That purpose can be
[1:28:40] defeated. Amen. Your life may look like
[1:28:43] this here and there. Just come down.
[1:28:47] Come and say Lord, what's my purpose?
[1:28:50] What's my Is this happening because of
[1:28:52] my purpose? Amen. Do you know
[1:28:55] Moses? Because he was born for a
[1:28:58] purpose. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. The devil
[1:29:02] knowing that his nemesis has been born.
[1:29:05] Mhm. Yes. It's just that he couldn't
[1:29:07] tell exactly. Yes. He's a poor sniper.
[1:29:11] Yes. He couldn't, you know, he couldn't
[1:29:14] get the target directly. He said, "I
[1:29:17] will kill all the children around this
[1:29:19] age." Is that right? Is that what he
[1:29:21] did? Why was he killing? Because he
[1:29:24] wanted to destroy the deliverer.
[1:29:28] But the purpose of God cannot be. Amen.
[1:29:32] Are you catching it? Amen. Moses was eat
[1:29:34] for two or 3 months. Hallelujah. And the
[1:29:36] Lord said, "You know what? It's high
[1:29:38] time you got him out." And the parents
[1:29:40] said, "That will be suicidal." He said,
[1:29:41] "If you keep him, he's going to die."
[1:29:43] Yeah. Bring him out. I want to take the
[1:29:46] battle to the enemy's camp. And friends,
[1:29:49] they put Moses in a cave. Yes. And they
[1:29:52] ran through River N where there were
[1:29:54] crocodiles. And no crocodile could eat
[1:29:57] that boy because his purpose protected
[1:29:59] him. Hallelujah.
[1:30:02] Your purpose is your protection, my
[1:30:04] brother. Sleep easy, rest,
[1:30:09] behind yours for nothing. Stop
[1:30:11] disturbing your mind with anxieties and
[1:30:14] fear. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:19] And where was God guiding the I'll
[1:30:21] come back to Joseph to random. Where was
[1:30:23] God guiding the to? Right to the
[1:30:24] enemy's place. Yeah. Yeah. And friends,
[1:30:28] Moses arrived there and God introduced
[1:30:30] Moses to Pharaoh's daughter. God did not
[1:30:33] hide his identity. When Pharaoh's
[1:30:36] daughter carried the boy, he said, "This
[1:30:37] is an Hebrew boy." I think the palace
[1:30:40] was killing Hebrew boys at that age. Why
[1:30:42] didn't she kill him? Why didn't she
[1:30:44] strangle him, suffocating with the pill?
[1:30:47] It will be an easy death purpose.
[1:30:52] The purpose of God cannot be defeated.
[1:30:55] And because the purpose is undefeable,
[1:30:57] the carrier of the purpose must be
[1:30:59] protected.
[1:31:01] Hallelujah.
[1:31:03] That's right. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:06] Brother said, "This is why I'm not
[1:31:08] afraid of opposition." He said, "This is
[1:31:10] why I can stand." Amen. Before the witch
[1:31:13] doctors, before hypnotizers, before all
[1:31:16] attackers, he said, "Because God has
[1:31:19] promised to be with me. And as long as
[1:31:21] I'm in his purpose, he said there is no
[1:31:24] power
[1:31:26] there's no scheme of man or of the devil
[1:31:29] that can pull me down. Hallelujah.
[1:31:31] Friends, we are protected. We are
[1:31:34] shielded. Hallelujah. We are taken care
[1:31:36] of. We don't even have fear of falling
[1:31:39] or failing or being killed. We have no
[1:31:42] such fear because we're in the purpose
[1:31:45] of God and we know our purpose will
[1:31:48] preserve us. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:31:53] Amen.
[1:31:55] And God said, you know what? In as much
[1:31:57] as you are not allowing these Hebrew
[1:31:59] mothers to raise their children
[1:32:01] peacefully, this particular one, you
[1:32:03] will pay for it.
[1:32:07] Miriam said, "Can I go and call a woman
[1:32:11] that can nurse that is wet?" said, "Go
[1:32:13] and call." So, you know what happened?
[1:32:15] Moses mother got
[1:32:17] money to raise her whole child
[1:32:23] purpose.
[1:32:25] And since she's since she is not an
[1:32:28] Egyptian, she's an Israelite. So it's an
[1:32:30] expert wage. Yeah. So it's going to be
[1:32:34] much more than the local salary.
[1:32:36] Amen. And why did God do that?
[1:32:40] The curriculum Moses needed to be raised
[1:32:43] with to destroy Egypt is not available
[1:32:45] in the palace.
[1:32:47] Is deposited in an earning vessel. Yes.
[1:32:50] Amen. Called Job. Amen. Amen. That's
[1:32:53] right. Mothers, are you here? This is
[1:32:56] what God is making you is fashioning you
[1:33:00] to raise champions for the kingdom. Who
[1:33:03] will be nemesis to the kingdom of
[1:33:05] heaven? Godly mothers. That's your
[1:33:08] reward. Yes, that's your purpose.
[1:33:13] And you know what happened? You know the
[1:33:15] rest of the story, right? Moses
[1:33:18] destroyed Egypt. He destroyed Pharaoh.
[1:33:21] He destroyed all because his purpose
[1:33:23] cannot be defeated.
[1:33:26] Joseph now find himself in Egypt.
[1:33:31] And the Arabian merchant said, "You see
[1:33:34] that great general who was always
[1:33:36] looking for this boy meet all the
[1:33:38] specification of General Portifer. Let's
[1:33:40] go hand him over." And when they brought
[1:33:43] him to Portifer, he said, "That's really
[1:33:44] what I want. That's my spec."
[1:33:48] And Joseph, Joseph got there like a
[1:33:51] slave. Yes. But because his God was with
[1:33:54] him, because Joseph understood purpose,
[1:33:58] nothing could break him. His mood
[1:34:01] couldn't change. He remained a
[1:34:03] consistent Christian with a consistent
[1:34:05] testimony. He was always going with a
[1:34:08] song and his mind. His energy level is
[1:34:10] constant or growing. There was no dull
[1:34:13] moment. That was why all through his
[1:34:16] experience, he was a proper guy. Yeah.
[1:34:19] Amen. If he was looking dull, angered,
[1:34:21] miserable, wretched and and retired,
[1:34:25] nobody will appreciate him to be
[1:34:26] committing things to his hands. That is
[1:34:29] the power of the reveal. That is the
[1:34:31] blessings that revelation give unto you.
[1:34:34] Moses knew that it was for his purpose
[1:34:37] all these things were happening. He will
[1:34:39] tell his soul every day, my God will
[1:34:42] make a way somewhere. Amen. One day I
[1:34:44] will arrive. I may not know how I will
[1:34:46] arrive but I will arrive. So that kept
[1:34:49] his energy level high. Yes. And Pifan
[1:34:52] looked at him. I like the energy of this
[1:34:54] guy. Take over my house. Take over
[1:34:57] everything except to my wife. And from a
[1:35:00] slave he became the managing director of
[1:35:03] Portifer's house. Going in and coming
[1:35:05] out and doing his job with wisdom,
[1:35:08] excellency, and dignity. And Joseph
[1:35:11] seemed to have relaxed.
[1:35:14] Then God looks at his eternal clock.
[1:35:17] Amen. It's time to move closer. And he
[1:35:20] made Portifer's wife to do what he did.
[1:35:23] Amen. In retrospect, Portifer's wife was
[1:35:26] useful.
[1:35:29] Yes. This is what the believer is. Amen.
[1:35:32] I see God in that. She was useful. If
[1:35:35] she hadn't done what she did, Joseph
[1:35:37] wouldn't have been in Egypt and in
[1:35:39] prison. And he needed that prison
[1:35:41] experience because it will be from
[1:35:44] prison to the throne. When he got into
[1:35:46] the prison, it was it didn't take long
[1:35:49] that this accused criminal also became
[1:35:52] the de facto control general of prison.
[1:35:55] Read your Bible because whatever came
[1:35:58] his way couldn't break in. Amen.
[1:36:01] Christians, brother Graham said we are
[1:36:02] not bed plans. We need constant
[1:36:05] maintenance. When things are happening
[1:36:07] your way, pastors are jittery. They
[1:36:10] don't know whether you are going to
[1:36:11] continue in the faith or not. You want
[1:36:13] to be baby that beg. Come on brother,
[1:36:15] you are going to the same
[1:36:19] some of us haven't gone through
[1:36:21] experience that that brother encountered
[1:36:24] his energy level remain unbroken.
[1:36:28] He was always going with the song and
[1:36:29] the smile.
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:34] It didn't take long. Yes. The controller
[1:36:36] of prison said, "There's something about
[1:36:38] this guy." He said, "You take over the
[1:36:41] prison. You be the Lord of the prison
[1:36:44] and you report to me. I will take
[1:36:46] account of all prisoners from you." And
[1:36:48] yet, he was supposed to also be a
[1:36:50] prisoner. Think about that. That's
[1:36:52] something supernatural. Let the beauty
[1:36:54] of Jesus be seen in me. Hallelujah. His
[1:36:57] wonderful passion and purity. All thou
[1:37:00] spirit divine. Hallelujah. All my nature
[1:37:02] refined. Amen. Yes. Amen. And while
[1:37:06] doing his work, he became the
[1:37:07] controller, became the pastor. So maybe
[1:37:10] they had a small fellowship. And one day
[1:37:12] they didn't see brother, brother Baker
[1:37:15] in service. And like a true pastor, he
[1:37:18] has the time they go to check on them.
[1:37:20] Bro, why didn't we see you in service?
[1:37:22] It was a sweet fellowship we just had.
[1:37:24] Oh, sir, I I had a dream. I couldn't
[1:37:27] make it. I bet you, bro. The same thing.
[1:37:30] We're in the same boat. That's why we
[1:37:32] did the same thing. Okay, tell me your
[1:37:34] dream. When they told Zebra Butler,
[1:37:37] congratulations. Congratulations.
[1:37:39] Congratulations. You are going back to
[1:37:42] Union Building.
[1:37:44] You are going to serve the president
[1:37:46] again. You don't mean it. I've been
[1:37:49] dismissed. It doesn't matter. It won't
[1:37:52] fail. What you what I'm saying? Then
[1:37:54] they turn to God baker. So, I'm sorry.
[1:37:57] God be with you till we meet again.
[1:38:01] You won't make it to you won't make it
[1:38:03] in the sweet by and by I will see you
[1:38:06] brother
[1:38:07] and it happened exactly but before it
[1:38:10] happened Joseph told I said you know you
[1:38:13] know don't forget don't forget
[1:38:16] you know I didn't do anything wrong
[1:38:19] pastor do you need to tell me
[1:38:22] there are some things you don't need to
[1:38:23] talk pastor I should know that in my
[1:38:26] gumption
[1:38:28] as soon as I'm restored Yeah. The first
[1:38:30] file I will open is your file. And I
[1:38:33] will make sure pastor you are out of
[1:38:35] this place. Pastor, it's a deal. God
[1:38:39] bless you pastor. If it happened as you
[1:38:41] said by the next day it was restored.
[1:38:44] And let me tell you the butler did not
[1:38:47] plan to forget. It was God who took the
[1:38:50] memory away.
[1:38:53] Did you hear me? Yeah.
[1:38:56] Because you couldn't have forgotten a
[1:38:59] man. Yes. Who did something outstanding
[1:39:02] like that?
[1:39:04] At least every day you remembered you've
[1:39:06] been restored. You also remember
[1:39:08] somebody told you you'll be restored.
[1:39:11] Isn't it? So it's unnatural for Butler
[1:39:14] to forget. But because that was not the
[1:39:18] path to his purpose. God took the memory
[1:39:21] away. God does not want Joseph to be
[1:39:24] brought out out of pity that a man will
[1:39:27] take glory about. He wants him to come
[1:39:30] out out of necessity and the people will
[1:39:32] be begging him save us. Save us.
[1:39:38] Right?
[1:39:39] If God has not attached anybody to the
[1:39:43] purpose or program of your life, it
[1:39:46] could be your uncle. Let him be the
[1:39:47] managing director of Escom.
[1:39:50] He says come still
[1:39:53] existing daily. Okay. Give me the one
[1:39:55] that is existing right
[1:39:57] there. Yeah. Let him be the managing
[1:40:00] director of one of your best paratas. He
[1:40:03] won't give you job.
[1:40:07] Christians don't don't hold grudge
[1:40:09] against
[1:40:11] you. Just tell yourself it wasn't meant
[1:40:13] to be part of the program.
[1:40:16] Simple. Yeah. And it will take you out
[1:40:18] of complex. Yes, Joseph must have waited
[1:40:21] for a long time. And he didn't hear
[1:40:24] anything. As much as would have wondered
[1:40:26] why do people disappoint like this.
[1:40:29] Anyway, the vision I interpreted for him
[1:40:32] wasn't mine. It was God who did it.
[1:40:34] Okay, that's fine. I continue. He
[1:40:36] continued his life.
[1:40:39] Then one day when the Lord was ready.
[1:40:42] Hallelujah.
[1:40:44] You can see a purpose-driven life. Are
[1:40:46] you seeing now his purpose was there?
[1:40:48] Amen. So you sit sometimes you say I
[1:40:51] don't even understand this my life. It
[1:40:53] could be your purpose driving your life.
[1:40:56] Thank you. When you allow the cloud of
[1:40:58] self-pity and sorrow to overshadow you,
[1:41:00] you won't see the end picture. God has a
[1:41:03] reason for everything. Amen. Hold it
[1:41:05] before your face every day. The purpose
[1:41:07] of God cannot be defeated. Amen.
[1:41:11] Amen.
[1:41:14] Then God went to talk to Pharaoh. H. No.
[1:41:17] Is it Pharaoh now? Yeah, he gave him a
[1:41:20] dream. That dream is not too
[1:41:23] complicated.
[1:41:25] But you see, when God is ready to single
[1:41:28] a particular person for honor, it makes
[1:41:31] every other person like a dollar, a
[1:41:34] mediocre, a non-starter.
[1:41:37] Nobody could decipher what he saw. And
[1:41:41] when Pharaoh got anxious Yes. and
[1:41:44] vicious.
[1:41:46] Yes.
[1:41:48] Then everybody began to make
[1:41:50] consultation. Then the Lord sent it back
[1:41:52] to the butler.
[1:41:54] Look at when he remembered, look at the
[1:41:55] way he said. He said
[1:41:59] it's a case of how could I have
[1:42:00] forgotten
[1:42:02] this is for me. How will I face pastor
[1:42:04] Joseph this number of years to tell him
[1:42:07] that I forgot? How can I
[1:42:11] after I made great promises to him? How
[1:42:13] can I? Brother Butler, you didn't
[1:42:16] forget. God took it away
[1:42:20] to for things to work according to God's
[1:42:23] time, according to his election,
[1:42:26] according to his purpose.
[1:42:28] Yes, sir.
[1:42:31] There is a better late than never. I'll
[1:42:34] walk to Pharaoh. I'll tell him this.
[1:42:36] Pharaoh, stop disturbing yourself. In
[1:42:39] this dark time in Egypt, there's a man
[1:42:41] who can turn on the light. Hallelujah.
[1:42:43] Amen.
[1:42:45] Amen.
[1:42:46] Thank you. Hallelujah.
[1:42:49] You've carried Vero too far. Don't ever
[1:42:52] come to Joseph. Now, don't come to a
[1:42:54] point that a Pharaoh will come that you
[1:42:56] know the blessing of Joseph. It will
[1:42:58] produce an exodus. Yes. Amen. Amen. In
[1:43:03] this dark time, we got a man. He said,
[1:43:05] "Where is that man? It's in this land.
[1:43:08] Where is a prisoner?" Shut up. I thought
[1:43:12] you said a prophet. He said because both
[1:43:15] are P and P. Yeah. Get out of here. But
[1:43:19] a Pharaoh, you better King forever.
[1:43:22] Relax. He told me you are going to kill
[1:43:25] the baker. You couldn't resist. You kill
[1:43:27] him. You mean he said it before I did?
[1:43:29] Yeah. He told me you will restore me
[1:43:31] back to my position. I've been back
[1:43:33] here. What are you talking Pharaoh? Get
[1:43:35] this man.
[1:43:40] And they went to bring Joseph. They
[1:43:43] clean him up. make him look nice, groom
[1:43:45] him and make him appear. And Pharaoh
[1:43:47] said, "I learned you are there. You can
[1:43:49] do something for you to see a man who is
[1:43:53] still connected with his God despite all
[1:43:55] his trials." Pharaoh, this got nothing
[1:43:58] to do with me, there is the God in
[1:44:01] heaven.
[1:44:03] [Applause]
[1:44:05] I tell you, Christians can sing in
[1:44:07] tribulations.
[1:44:09] They can worship in trials.
[1:44:11] They can frustrate the devil. Yes. Until
[1:44:14] he doesn't know what to do with them.
[1:44:18] You know the story.
[1:44:20] Pharaoh gave his name and he gave the
[1:44:23] interpretation.
[1:44:24] So Pharaoh said what shall we now do?
[1:44:26] Said let a man be gotten to do this to
[1:44:29] do this to do this to do this and do
[1:44:31] this. And when this Pharaoh was laughing
[1:44:33] he said look at him. He said let a man
[1:44:35] be gotten. Who is the man that has it
[1:44:38] like you are saying it? You are the man
[1:44:41] Joseph. You are the man. Yeah. And from
[1:44:43] that moment he became the prime
[1:44:45] minister. He removed his ring. It's an
[1:44:48] instant appointment. Hallelujah. And
[1:44:51] Joseph did as the vision showed. Then
[1:44:55] the years of famine started coming.
[1:44:58] And I can see Jacob saying, "We learned
[1:45:02] there's great revival taking place in
[1:45:04] Egypt. The mighty prince is there
[1:45:06] turning things around. Why don't you
[1:45:09] guys come and go and see if you will
[1:45:10] have favor? before him so that we don't
[1:45:13] die. And the brothers came and the Lord
[1:45:17] made Joseph to recognize them and the
[1:45:20] Lord blocked their eyes from recognizing
[1:45:22] him. Amen. My brother, my sister, they
[1:45:24] bowed.
[1:45:26] Yes.
[1:45:28] Thus said the Lord and never fail. Amen.
[1:45:32] I counted it in the Bible. They bowed up
[1:45:34] to five times. Three times before they
[1:45:36] knew it was Joseph. And after he
[1:45:39] introduced himself, I am Joseph. They
[1:45:41] bowed again when their father died.
[1:45:44] Hallelujah. They said, they said, "Let
[1:45:47] us form a society of guilty brothers
[1:45:50] because Joseph must have been nice to us
[1:45:52] because of our father." Now that our
[1:45:55] father is gone, he will take it on us.
[1:45:57] Let's go and beg for our lives. Now they
[1:46:00] know this was Joseph. My Bible told me
[1:46:02] they bow again because the purpose of
[1:46:05] God
[1:46:10] about to tell them you meant it for
[1:46:12] evil, God meant it for and he told them
[1:46:16] for comfort. He said, "Do you see
[1:46:17] everything you did? It was God's way of
[1:46:20] sending me in advance in order to
[1:46:24] protect your generation."
[1:46:26] And he said there are still many more
[1:46:28] years of famine but with me you are
[1:46:30] safe. Go bring everybody. I will nurture
[1:46:34] you all throughout the years of famine.
[1:46:37] In all those trials it discovered
[1:46:39] purpose. Amen. And he served it well. My
[1:46:43] brother, my sister, you are not brought
[1:46:45] here for nothing. Amen. Yes, Lord. Amen.
[1:46:48] You are not a useless part in the body.
[1:46:52] You call it the body of Christ. There is
[1:46:54] no one part of that body that can be
[1:46:57] useless. Every part is useful.
[1:47:01] The reason you are sweating, you are
[1:47:03] failing is because you are still trying
[1:47:06] to develop a design. Yes. You are not
[1:47:09] called to do that. You are called to
[1:47:11] discover. May the Lord reveal himself to
[1:47:14] you that you might take your position in
[1:47:16] the body and serve it well. Amen. When
[1:47:19] you will enjoy his nurturing, his
[1:47:21] maintenance, his protection, his
[1:47:24] provision. Life will find a different
[1:47:28] when the Lord takes responsibility for
[1:47:31] your life. God bless you.
[1:47:35] Hallelujah.
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:43] Thank you, Lord.
[1:47:48] Amen. You enjoy the word of the Lord.
[1:47:50] Amen. Let's give the Lord a good anchor
[1:47:51] for praise.
[1:47:54] Amen. Something about purpose.
[1:47:56] Hallelujah. You know, brother Brandon
[1:47:58] calls us a super church.
[1:48:01] Amen. A super church, super race. So,
[1:48:04] like the brother was saying, each part
[1:48:06] of the body plays a purpose. Yes. So you
[1:48:09] need to be a super toe, a super finger,
[1:48:13] a super eye, a super ear, super feet, to
[1:48:18] make the entire body super. Hallelujah.
[1:48:21] Something about purpose.
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:25] Even if you are dead,
[1:48:29] buried, Lazarus's purpose was not
[1:48:31] fulfilled. So God came back. Amen. Jesus
[1:48:35] comes back to call him from the grave.
[1:48:38] because Lazarus's purpose was not yet
[1:48:40] fulfilled. Amen. Amen. Let's give the
[1:48:42] Lord one more good hand of praise. Let's
[1:48:44] stand together. Amen. That was
[1:48:45] wonderful, pastor. Amen. We appreciate
[1:48:47] it. Amen. The purpose of God. Amen.
[1:48:50] Hallelujah.
[1:48:52] Amen. It will never fail. Amen. We can
[1:48:55] rest on that knowing that we are in the
[1:48:58] purpose of God. What are we called for?
[1:49:00] Ephesians 1 tells us we are called unto
[1:49:02] adoption. Our final purpose is adoption.
[1:49:06] Amen. Where we will be back in our
[1:49:08] original position again. Amen. Let's
[1:49:11] just sing and give him praise. Give him
[1:49:12] glory. Give him honor. Amen. He's worthy
[1:49:15] to be praised. Let's sing. Amen. New
[1:49:17] things are being declared. I believe
[1:49:19] him. Tonight, new things have been
[1:49:20] declared. New frontiers have been
[1:49:22] opened. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:27] Hallelujah. Until this day, no man could
[1:49:31] tell us just
[1:49:35] where we came from and where we go from
[1:49:39] here.
[1:49:43] Oh, but through the eyes of the prophet
[1:49:46] God revealed to
[1:49:49] us before God was God all the way to
[1:49:53] future
[1:49:57] hope. New things are being
[1:50:00] declared. I know very soon I'll be
[1:50:04] raptured of you. Angel is
[1:50:08] here leading our souls in truth. The
[1:50:13] invisible, the audible, the
[1:50:17] inconceivable, free to believe for the
[1:50:21] impossible. Oh, in this new
[1:50:27] day, the angel of God not seen for 2,000
[1:50:34] years. He's here fixing things for us to
[1:50:38] leave.
[1:50:41] Oh, he's waving visions of ourselves
[1:50:45] before
[1:50:47] us. So we can walk step by step into
[1:50:52] what we
[1:50:53] behold. See us do the things that are
[1:50:57] being
[1:50:58] declared. I know very soon I'll be
[1:51:02] raptured out of here. Angel God is
[1:51:06] here. We our souls
[1:51:09] in the
[1:51:11] invisible,
[1:51:12] remarkable,
[1:51:14] inconceivable. Faith to believe for the
[1:51:18] impossible. Oh, in this new day, eyes
[1:51:22] have not
[1:51:24] seen. Eyes have not seen nor ears heard
[1:51:29] the things that God
[1:51:31] has prepared for those whom we
[1:51:38] love. But in this day God
[1:51:42] display if you say nothing shall be
[1:51:47] impossible unto you. Let's sing now. Few
[1:51:53] things are being
[1:51:55] declared. I know very soon I'll be
[1:51:58] raptured out of here. The angel of God
[1:52:01] is
[1:52:03] here. Our souls in
[1:52:06] true
[1:52:07] invisible in audible
[1:52:11] conceivable to believe for the
[1:52:14] impossible. Oh this new day.
[1:52:20] In this new
[1:52:23] day. Oh
[1:52:25] yes. In this new
[1:52:29] [Music]
[1:52:33] day. In this new
[1:52:36] day. Oh, we just talk to the Lord. Amen.
[1:52:39] He's come to identify your purpose.
[1:52:41] Amen. Nothing can stop the purpose of
[1:52:44] God. Amen. Nothing can defeat the
[1:52:47] purpose of God. Amen. Why don't you just
[1:52:49] talk to the Lord and thank him for
[1:52:50] purpose? Thank him. Amen. That he's
[1:52:52] clearly defined your life. Amen. You may
[1:52:55] not always see the path. Amen. Amen. The
[1:52:58] path may not always be clear to you. But
[1:53:01] depend on his purpose. Amen. What he's
[1:53:03] called you for. Hallelujah. All Joseph
[1:53:07] saw was the dream and he trusted in the
[1:53:09] Lord. He knew the one that gave him the
[1:53:12] dream
[1:53:13] will not fail him. Amen. He knew that
[1:53:16] his brothers must come and bow down
[1:53:18] before him. Praise the Lord. So he
[1:53:22] waited. Amen. He endured. He patiently
[1:53:24] endured. Building character. Amen. From
[1:53:26] faith to virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[1:53:29] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness.
[1:53:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:36] Hallelujah. Joseph affection. Amen.
[1:53:39] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:53:43] Joseph, perfection was there to bring
[1:53:44] grace back. Jacob was grace. Amen. Grace
[1:53:49] had to come to perfection.
[1:53:51] Grace is coming to perfection in this
[1:53:53] hour. Hallelujah. Amen. The grace of God
[1:53:55] coming with double grace. The headstone
[1:53:57] coming with shoutings of grace.
[1:54:00] But Joseph typing perfection can't leave
[1:54:02] Jacob back in famine.
[1:54:05] So perfection sends back a word for
[1:54:07] grace.
[1:54:09] And he brings Jacob all the way back.
[1:54:12] He brings Israel all the way back to
[1:54:15] meet perfection.
[1:54:17] What hour are we living in?
[1:54:20] If not in the age of grace, grace,
[1:54:24] coming to perfection, the headstone.
[1:54:26] Glory be to God. Hallelujah. I believe
[1:54:29] the spirit of God was very direct
[1:54:31] speaking to us this evening. Speaking to
[1:54:33] the need. Amen. Maybe there's somebody
[1:54:36] here that was despondent down wondering
[1:54:38] what's their purpose in life.
[1:54:41] Amen. No matter what portion of the body
[1:54:43] you are, you are equally as important.
[1:54:45] Amen.
[1:54:47] Brother Brandham says, "If God made you
[1:54:51] a $1 bill, he says, be the best $1 bill
[1:54:55] you can be."
[1:54:56] Don't try to be like the $10, but be the
[1:54:59] best $1 bill that you can be. That's
[1:55:03] what we want to be. Glory be to God.
[1:55:06] Let's sing that song. You know when when
[1:55:07] they blew their trumpet, they said, "Bow
[1:55:09] the knee. Joseph is coming." Amen. But
[1:55:12] we have a greater king. Let's sing. Bow
[1:55:15] your knee. Jesus is coming. Hail to the
[1:55:18] King. Hosanna to
[1:55:21] him. Bow your
[1:55:24] knee. Jesus is
[1:55:28] coming. Hail to the
[1:55:32] King. Hosana to him.
[1:55:37] in
[1:55:40] reverence. Worship
[1:55:43] him in the beauty of
[1:55:48] holiness. We
[1:55:51] confess he is
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:55:59] Lord. He is Lord.
[1:56:07] He is
[1:56:13] Lord.
[1:56:15] He
[1:56:17] Lord. Sing. Bow your
[1:56:19] [Music]
[1:56:22] knee. Bow your
[1:56:25] knee. Jesus is
[1:56:29] coming to the king.
[1:56:33] Hosanana to
[1:56:36] him in
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:40] reverence. Worship
[1:56:42] him in the beauty of
[1:56:47] holiness. We
[1:56:49] confess singing he is Lord.
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:13] Please. Oh, let's make a declaration
[1:57:15] that he's alive. Oh, let's see
[1:57:19] now. He's alive. He's alive. If there
[1:57:24] ever was a doubt in your mind, he's
[1:57:27] alive. He's alive. He's
[1:57:31] [Music]
[1:57:33] alive. He's alive. He's alive. If the
[1:57:37] river wasn't in your eyes, he's alive.
[1:57:42] He's alive. He's alive. For he is
[1:57:51] Lord. For he is
[1:57:56] Lord. He is
[1:57:58] Lord. He is
