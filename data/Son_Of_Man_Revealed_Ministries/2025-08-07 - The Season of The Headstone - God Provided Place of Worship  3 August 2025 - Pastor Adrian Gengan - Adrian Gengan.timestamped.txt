[0:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you turn around, greet
[0:08] your brother and sister? Amen. You can.
[0:13] So, I walked out from the room there and
[0:15] when I walked in here, it's very stuffy.
[0:17] Maybe we can get the air con on a bit.
[0:20] Amen.
[0:23] Praise the Lord.
[0:27] Hallelujah.
[0:30] So next week, Sunday, there'll be a
[0:32] combined service on the 10th. Amen. Our

[0:43] Amen. 4 p.m. at the Derbell Secondary
[0:46] School. So, Amen. If you know Pastor Dan
[0:48] Matanga, he preached for us last year
[0:51] and he spoke on the spirit hanging over
[0:52] you. Amen. If you remember that.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're blessed to have him again
[0:58] this year. So beyond expectation for
[1:01] that service, come expecting a blessing.
[1:03] Amen. Next week, Sunday at 4 p.m. Amen.
[1:07] So we greet everyone in the mighty name
[1:08] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also welcome once again our see
[1:13] our pastor Denel's mom here. Amen. God
[1:15] bless you. May you be blessed in the
[1:17] presence of the Lord. Amen. Let's turn
[1:19] to Luke chapter 8.
[1:23] Amen.
[1:28] will speak a title that's maybe called
[1:31] what the prophet used God's provided
[1:34] place of worship.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; And if I use a subtitle, I'll say
[1:40] knowing the time and season that we are
[1:42] living in.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so easy to be deceived
[1:48] &gt;&gt; if we don't know the time and season.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke 8:9
[1:58] And his disciples asked him, saying,
[2:01] "What might this peril will be?" And he
[2:04] said, "Unto you it is given to know the
[2:07] mysteries of the kingdom of God."
[2:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; But to others in parables that seeing
[2:14] they might not see, and hearing they
[2:17] might not understand.
[2:20] So present the gospel and walk away.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Don't break your head.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; What is Jesus saying? They are seeing
[2:27] the scriptures you are showing them but
[2:29] they will not see it.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; And they are hearing the scriptures you
[2:32] are telling them but they don't
[2:34] understand it.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Now the parable is this. The seed is the
[2:40] word of God.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; So anytime now even as we are sowing
[2:44] seed now that's we are sowing the word
[2:45] of God. That seed want to get to one
[2:47] more scripture. Zechariah 4:7.
[2:50] Amen.
[2:53] Zechariah 4:7.
[2:59] Who art thou, oh great mountain, before
[3:02] Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain,
[3:07] and he shall bring forth a headstone
[3:09] with shoutings.
[3:12] Amen.
[3:14] He'll bring forth the headstones.
[3:17] Head stone with shoutings.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the rapture starts
[3:22] with a shout.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; That's the coming of the headstone.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus does all three things as he's
[3:28] descending. Everybody say Jesus is the
[3:31] headstone.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the headstone.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; So, he's saying the headstone will come
[3:37] with shoutings.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; Crying grace, grace unto it. The Lord
[3:41] had blessings to the reading of his
[3:43] word. You may be seated. We can just go
[3:44] to Luke 8:10 there. Again, just want to
[3:47] make a a comment on this. It says, "And
[3:50] he said, unto you it is given to know
[3:52] the mysteries of the kingdom of God." In
[3:54] this time and season that we are living
[3:56] in in 2025,
[3:58] there are no mysteries of God that are
[4:00] not revealed.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; All the mysteries of God have been
[4:05] revealed.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; The seventh angel has already sounded.
[4:10] Yes.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; So, we are living in a very Amen. Uh
[4:15] &gt;&gt; an anointed hour.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; There's never been a time or a season
[4:19] where the entire mystery of God has been
[4:21] made known to a people.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes. Yes, sir.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; So, we are not still wondering and
[4:28] pondering about what this mystery is,
[4:29] what that mystery is. All the mysteries
[4:32] that were supposed to be revealed were
[4:35] revealed when brother Brandham sounded
[4:37] his message.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:40] Amen.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; So we must know the time and the season
[4:45] that we are living in.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; If a farmer doesn't know time and
[4:50] season,
[4:52] &gt;&gt; he will not be a successful farmer.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know there are certain seasons
[4:57] that you can plant certain seeds?
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then there are certain trees
[5:02] that you can't keep tilling the ground.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; How many of you till the your your mango
[5:07] tree every year? Fruit trees bear
[5:10] according to time and season.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go and take it up by
[5:14] the roots.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; There are certain trees that you've just
[5:18] got to leave planted.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; And it will bear fruit.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; But there are certain crops which you
[5:25] must till.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; So we must know the time and season.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the to everything
[5:36] there is a season.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:39] a purpose for everything under the sun.
[5:41] Now, if we don't know time and season,
[5:44] we can have wrong expectation.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; And having a wrong expectations, we'll
[5:51] be expecting wrong results.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; And be wandering around and around the
[5:57] message of the hour, never fulfilling
[5:59] what we were meant to fulfill.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:02] And this can bring frustration. But not
[6:05] only frustration, we can miss our day
[6:08] and its message.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; We can be so close to it, but we can
[6:12] miss our day and its message.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Remember we were
[6:18] backgrounding with Esther. She was in
[6:20] the kingdom wearing a royal crown,
[6:22] &gt;&gt; being called your majesty, your
[6:24] highness.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; She was so close to it.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; But she was never in it.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Why? was disconnected from the
[6:32] headstone.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; So in the times when our Lord Jesus was
[6:39] on earth, the scribes and the Pharisees
[6:42] were still trying to keep the season of
[6:43] Moses.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; But the season had changed.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; They were trying to keep the season of
[6:49] Moses. They failed to see time and
[6:52] season had changed. Proof after proof,
[6:54] manifestation after manifestation, Jesus
[6:57] displayed before them. But they failed
[6:59] to see it. Yes.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Their eyes were blinded. Why? Traditions
[7:04] of men.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; I'm saying let us not be blinded in the
[7:09] message but traditions of men in the
[7:11] message.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; This is not 1965.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[7:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; It's 2025.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; If you read the opening book of Joshua,
[7:27] &gt;&gt; it is very clear and you can you are
[7:29] very sharp. You can read between the
[7:30] lines.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; If you put up Joshua chapter one there.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; There's a very distinct statement that
[7:36] the Lord makes to Joshua.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Go to the next one.
[7:44] Moses, my servant, is
[7:50] &gt;&gt; amen.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; First Exodus.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; We're in the third Exodus.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:59] Moses, my servant, is dead.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; What is he trying to tell him?
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Stop looking back.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; You are now called and chosen.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; So, he's emphasizing there. Moses, my
[8:14] servant, is dead now. Therefore, you
[8:16] arise.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; As long as we keep you looking back and
[8:22] we speak about as if sometimes we speak
[8:25] to people and they ask us where is where
[8:27] is brother Brandon?
[8:29] &gt;&gt; We speak about him like he's so alive.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; But we are failing to see that he had a
[8:35] message
[8:37] &gt;&gt; and the proof of his message and the
[8:39] vindication of his message is that the
[8:42] life of Christ must be formed in us.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; If the life of Christ is not formed in
[8:46] us, we are wasting our time.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. Amen.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; He came with a message.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; He came to reveal all the mysteries of
[8:55] God so that you and I could reproduce
[8:57] the life of Christ.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We must be an army of
[9:02] Jesus.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; When people look at us, they must not be
[9:07] able to tell the difference between us
[9:08] and Jesus.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; The same works that was in Jesus must be
[9:12] seen in us.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; But we've got to get our expectation
[9:16] right.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to get our faith right.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; So here they are porting
[9:25] they're porting the prophets and the
[9:26] psalms to Jesus.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[9:31] But when the when when the prophets and
[9:33] the psalms are speaking about the what
[9:35] the prophets and the psalms are speaking
[9:37] about are standing right before them.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; People are porting the ports.
[9:43] People are quoting about the bride,
[9:47] &gt;&gt; about what the bride will be. But the
[9:48] very manifestation of the bride is right
[9:50] before us.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; What is the deception? Satan will always
[9:57] keep you looking.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Always looking.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; And fail to see what he's doing.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, well taught church. Praise
[10:07] the Lord. Amen.
[10:10] So they refuse to accept it. And when we
[10:12] refuse to accept the day and hour we are
[10:14] living in now, we are crucifying it.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; They crucified Jesus. They didn't want
[10:20] to hear that he was the word made flesh.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; They still don't want to hear that you
[10:24] are the word made flesh today.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; They are saying, "No, we are still
[10:27] waiting for something more."
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; They took the word and they killed it
[10:35] and spirits don't die.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Sure. Let's go to the first quote there.
[10:42] The prophet is saying, "Amen." Praise
[10:44] the Lord.
[10:49] The prophet is saying, "The time and
[10:51] hour that we're living in, that we're
[10:54] living, if a person don't know which way
[10:56] to go,
[10:57] &gt;&gt; what to do, or how to turn, you're not
[11:00] walking by faith anymore."
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the hour of perfect faith.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we if we ever want to walk in
[11:09] perfect faith, we've got to know the
[11:11] time and the hour.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; He says, otherwise, you're not walking
[11:15] by faith anymore. You're just guessing.
[11:17] You're presuming
[11:19] &gt;&gt; what's happening. Oh, no. You know, God
[11:20] sent a prophet. We received his message,
[11:22] but we're not sure what's happening
[11:23] right now.
[11:26] [Music]
[11:27] &gt;&gt; We're kind of wondering what happened.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Since Brandon fell asleep, everything is
[11:31] the same.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; What are they doing?
[11:35] They're presuming. guessing
[11:39] but we are walking with a definite
[11:41] authority.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; We are walking with a definite
[11:43] vindication.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has not left the church.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the guide. You know
[11:49] what has happened? People have kicked
[11:51] out the Holy Ghost and took theology of
[11:53] the message.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't see the Holy Ghost move
[11:58] anymore.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. People are not moved shaken by the
[12:03] Holy Ghost. People are not led by the
[12:05] Holy Ghost. But the Bible says that sons
[12:07] of God are led by the spirit of God.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; We should always keep the flame alive.
[12:13] Amen. Always keep the spirit alive in
[12:15] us.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Don't be a dead cold church, but be a
[12:18] church where the spirit of God is moving
[12:20] to us.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what happens when you
[12:26] have a cold?
[12:28] &gt;&gt; After a while, it gets
[12:30] &gt;&gt; lukewarm. You've got to stoke it.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need some stoking. Amen. I pray
[12:35] the Holy Ghost stoked some calls this
[12:37] morning.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; He says you're not walking by faith
[12:41] anymore. You're just guessing. You're
[12:43] presuming. And to presume is to advance
[12:46] without official authority.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Now, in our spiritual walk, we don't
[12:52] want to be advancing without spiritual
[12:53] authority.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Without official authority.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the next one then. So,
[13:01] if we haven't got the real official
[13:04] authority to know what God said would
[13:05] take place in this hour,
[13:07] &gt;&gt; how are we ever going to face the hour?
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; And we've got to face it.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Knowing by faith in his word that the
[13:23] things that supposed to be happening now
[13:26] and the condition of the nations.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Now watch.
[13:30] I know sometimes you hear preachers
[13:32] saying, "Don't worry about this. Don't
[13:34] worry about Russia. Don't worry about
[13:35] Rome. Don't worry about America."
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet is saying.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Let's bring a balance.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Those things won't position us. It won't
[13:45] give us faith. But he's saying let's
[13:47] take everything.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; He's saying we've got to know what's
[13:51] supposed to be happening now.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus also say watch the fig
[13:55] tree.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Now you're getting message minister say
[13:58] don't worry about Israel.
[14:00] Don't worry about USA. How can I not
[14:02] worry about USA when it's Revelation 13?
[14:05] &gt;&gt; How can I not worry about Rome when it's
[14:07] Revelation 13?
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we mustn't get carried away in
[14:14] our preaching.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. We've got to know our time and
[14:19] season, but God has placed it also in
[14:22] signs.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; He's saying we got to know what's
[14:26] supposed to be happening. the condition
[14:27] of the nations, the condition of the
[14:29] people, the condition of the church and
[14:32] so forth.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; We've got to know that and then how to
[14:38] walk out to face it. If you don't know
[14:40] how to do that, well, we just call kind
[14:43] of appazantly just jump in hoping it'll
[14:46] be there, hoping this, hoping that
[14:48] &gt;&gt; and will it be? But God don't want us to
[14:51] do that.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Now, we can't just be hoping, oh, I hope
[14:54] I make the rapture.
[14:56] No,
[14:57] &gt;&gt; we are walking with such confidence that
[14:59] we are in the shout
[15:00] &gt;&gt; and because we are caught up in the
[15:02] shout, we will make the rapture.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; We haven't missed the shout.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; He wants us to know what he has said
[15:12] about this day and then meet it by
[15:15] faith.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Because he said it would be that way.
[15:18] Then we know your truth then because you
[15:21] haven't got some person's word for it.
[15:23] You've got his word of what we must do.
[15:25] And we are hoping that our heavenly
[15:27] father will grant this to us this week.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we've got to
[15:33] know our time and our season.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we can't walk in perfect
[15:37] faith. Amen. Did the prophet make that
[15:39] very clear?
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, some of the things
[15:42] that help us is to watch the condition
[15:44] of nations, the conditions of the world.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the point of what I'm trying to
[15:50] convey to you this morning
[15:53] is that we can't be living in the bride
[15:55] age
[15:58] with the full opening of the word
[16:01] married to the lamb.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; And expecting
[16:07] a lady message.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; You can't be living all the way in the
[16:16] headstone. Somebody tell me what the
[16:18] virtue in headstone is.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Charity.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Right. The Bible says charity.
[16:28] The virtue in the headstone is charity.
[16:32] And you can't bring charity down to a
[16:35] legacy and condition.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Legacy in virtue is brotherly kindness.
[16:41] And I tell you, even in our own lives,
[16:43] some people are operating more in
[16:45] brotherly kindness than in charity.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; People who claim to be in the message of
[16:49] the hour are trying to operate the
[16:51] virtue of brotherly kindness in the
[16:53] legacy and church age when we supposed
[16:55] to be operating the fullness of it,
[16:57] which is charity.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Charity, you can decide what you want to
[17:04] do and can't do.
[17:06] Sorry, let me say that again. Brotherly
[17:09] kindness, you can decide what you want
[17:11] to do and what you can't do.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness, you can decide if
[17:16] you want to be good to your brother.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Charity is different.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Charity is God's.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Charity is an eternal.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; It's whether you think that person is
[17:29] deserving or not.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor to say amen.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; You can't be called into the message of
[17:38] the hour and be living below your
[17:40] privileges.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; You know, we got mean people.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; We got mean people even in the message
[17:48] of the hour.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Supposed to be liberated.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Supposed to be delivered.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Supposed to be expressing the love of
[17:54] Jesus. Supposed to be expressing
[17:56] charity.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; We don't even give cup of cold water to
[18:00] one another.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; We can't even show charitable things.
[18:04] There there's a reason why it's called
[18:06] charity and not a love in the Bible.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; You can love somebody without doing good
[18:13] works.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why organizations are
[18:17] not called love organizations. They're
[18:19] called charitable organizations.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; It's because it's accompanied with good
[18:24] works.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Charity is different. Charity is love
[18:31] accompanied by works.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. If we get to God's only provided
[18:41] place of worship, I think it's the next
[18:43] quote. It says because you are in Jesus
[18:46] the word.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; The part of the word that's manif being
[18:50] manifested today. This day's message.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Now watch the prophet has a pyramid in
[18:55] the church. I want you to get this.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Not Luther,
[18:59] &gt;&gt; not Wesley's, Pentecostals, but your
[19:02] Jesus.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the reflection that has to
[19:05] come up into this.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[19:16] He says now he's showing you that you
[19:18] have to come up into this into the
[19:20] headstone.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; And then he's saying you can't go back
[19:25] to that.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There you go.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; You can't go back to Leosia.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Didn't the Didn't Mama Eagle call you
[19:36] out of the barnard?
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; What was that? The story.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that was calling
[19:42] you into the headstone?
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I I just want to nail this thing
[19:46] down. In fact, I want to take a sword
[19:48] and cut off a head right now.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; How many of you believed you're married
[19:52] to the Lord Jesus Christ?
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Let me see your hands.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe you are married to the
[19:57] Lord Jesus Christ.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[20:02] Who is Jesus Christ? Somebody say the
[20:04] headstone.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; So how can you be married to the Lord
[20:10] Jesus Christ the headstone if he is not
[20:11] here?
[20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; How many of you got married on Zoom
[20:21] on Skype?
[20:24] The the minister says that these two
[20:26] parties present now
[20:29] &gt;&gt; may be joined together.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; You must be physically present
[20:39] &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus
[20:40] &gt;&gt; to be married.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; So if he came to take you as a wife
[20:46] he is physically here.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Lord. Now we have so much message, so
[20:53] much quotes. I can I can just say to you
[20:55] because I know you believe it. We are
[20:57] not going to the wedding ceremony there.
[21:00] We are going to the married supper.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; So when I'm using terminologies as we
[21:06] are in the headstone, we are already
[21:08] married to the headstone Christ.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; So it shouldn't be a foreign teaching to
[21:11] you. Yet it is a foreign teaching in the
[21:13] message of the hour
[21:17] &gt;&gt; because we are still trying to keep
[21:18] people in a legacy and church age with a
[21:21] lady and church age messenger but we
[21:23] have another messenger.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Be quiet.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; The latest CN had a church age
[21:33] messenger.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; He was a seventh church age messenger.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; You remember John was told to write all
[21:39] that he sees. Yes,
[21:40] &gt;&gt; you find that in Revelation chapter 1, I
[21:42] think it's verse 19, he's told to write.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Then in chapter 2, he says, "Write to
[21:48] the Ephesians.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Write to the Smyrnians. Write to the uh
[21:52] Amen. Titerians. Write to them."
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Seven church ages he's told to write.
[21:59] But then in Revelation 10,
[22:03] the same angel that told him to write
[22:05] tells him, "Don't write."
[22:08] Hallelujah.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Because that is a hidden bright age.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; That's only for the people Amen. that's
[22:18] been called up into the headstone.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; It's So, in other words, it's only for
[22:23] the people that have been pulled into
[22:24] the door
[22:26] &gt;&gt; of marriage. It's only to the people
[22:28] that have been married.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. That's right.
[22:36] So you can't go back to that. That's
[22:38] adding leaven to your holy bread.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; So why you want to bring? So remember
[22:43] when I'm saying this year, we're trying
[22:45] to pull Pentecostal blessings.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. Was Luther justification?
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Was Wesley sanctification?
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Was Pentecost Amen. Later this year
[22:58] restoration of the gifts?
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I'm saying. We are
[23:01] trying to add that
[23:03] &gt;&gt; to what we have.
[23:06] What is he saying? You are adding leaven
[23:08] to your holy bread.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Because man shall not live by every word
[23:12] that man shall live by every word that
[23:15] proceeded out of the mouth of God in its
[23:17] season.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; In its season.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Today we might be just doing a
[23:24] foundation of what we are speaking
[23:26] about.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know that brother Brandham
[23:29] says that you must be in his time.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; It must be his season. Now, these are
[23:34] five must
[23:35] &gt;&gt; when you're trying to do God a service.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Remember this. Now, you young people
[23:40] that's getting married,
[23:42] remember what the prophet of God taught
[23:44] you. You don't just take anyone and
[23:46] marry her.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Just because you find a girl in the
[23:49] church doesn't mean she's a good girl.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; What does he say? You must watch
[23:56] character.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; You go for character.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:01] Jesus didn't choose you because of your
[24:03] good looks. I'll have you know.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus chose you because of character.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; So character is very important.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Now we must choose correctly or you can
[24:22] ruin your entire life.
[24:26] You choose the wrong man, you choose the
[24:28] wrong woman, you'll ruin your entire
[24:30] life.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; So these things must be entered into
[24:36] prayerfully,
[24:37] &gt;&gt; advisedly. Now these are the some of you
[24:40] don't even pay attention to the marriage
[24:42] vows.
[24:44] This must be entered into prayerfully.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Advisedly. Who did you advise about who
[24:49] you want to get married to?
[24:54] Amen. So, those of you that haven't
[24:56] chosen yet,
[24:59] choose wisely.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; And who are you in consultation with to
[25:04] speak about this choice?
[25:08] This is not an easy choice.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; It must be done prayerfully.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; This is not about flirting. I'm talking
[25:17] to this girl. I'm talking to this guy.
[25:20] No.
[25:22] You are going to be living together.
[25:24] You're going to be having a family
[25:26] together.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; You're going to be raising children
[25:29] together.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible says, "How can two
[25:33] walk together unless they be agreed?"
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; So, I also want you to know, and I'll
[25:42] say it now for our young people, we
[25:45] don't believe in casual dating.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:50] We do not believe in casual dating in
[25:54] young people going out and just spending
[25:57] time together.
[25:59] Amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; You don't see how close you can get to a
[26:04] person. You must leave room for the
[26:07] angel of the Lord between you.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I know some of you are saying,
[26:17] "Brother, you said we in 2025. You're
[26:18] preaching like you're 1965.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; The word of God is not changing.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Do things respectfully. Do things out of
[26:32] the word of God.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you start right, you'll end
[26:35] right.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; You don't want to do things where you
[26:38] corrupt yourself even before you enter
[26:40] the vows. Some people come into the
[26:42] marriage uh ceremony so defiled.
[26:47] so defiled. Amen.
[26:50] They and and and I do hope that young
[26:53] people know that if you defile your
[26:55] life, you have to confess it.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; You have to confess it to one another,
[26:59] &gt;&gt; then confess it to God.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Because there's a clause in that
[27:04] marriage vow
[27:05] &gt;&gt; that if a woman doesn't disclose to her
[27:08] husband
[27:09] &gt;&gt; that she has been unfaithful and she
[27:11] slept around with other men,
[27:14] &gt;&gt; if he finds out years later, this is the
[27:16] only time Jesus said, except for the
[27:18] sake of fornication,
[27:19] &gt;&gt; he can put her away.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; You can be married 10 years, 20 years,
[27:24] if by then you tell your husband and he
[27:26] doesn't forgive you, according to the
[27:28] Bible, he can put you away.
[27:33] So these things must be disclosed
[27:35] upfront.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; And ask yourself, what are you looking
[27:40] for?
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet says you can't get all
[27:43] things.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; He says sometimes you'll get a real
[27:47] pretty girl
[27:48] &gt;&gt; or real handsome guy,
[27:51] right? And he says other times, amen,
[27:54] maybe they financially well off or they
[27:56] got good character but they don't look
[27:57] so well. He says, "But what are you
[27:59] really looking for?"
[28:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "Are you looking for somebody
[28:02] to raise your children, to be a mother
[28:04] to your children, or are you looking for
[28:06] somebody who will just put them in any
[28:08] old crash and just jump to any old job?"
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; And not be a mother to your children and
[28:13] not be a wife to you.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody pull me out of this. Trying to
[28:23] get back.
[28:25] I'm trying to get back slowly, brother
[28:27] Sunny.
[28:29] But somebody pull me out of this.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; So the choice we make for marriage,
[28:35] I say don't play with it.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; If you get the wrong job, you can leave
[28:41] the job.
[28:44] You don't like the job, you can leave
[28:45] the job.
[28:47] But the marriage is until death do us
[28:51] part.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So choose wisely. Amen.
[28:56] So the prophet is saying if you go to
[28:58] the next you must be in his time in his
[29:01] season. You got that now must be time
[29:04] season.
[29:05] It must be according to the word that's
[29:07] been spoken. I don't care how well you
[29:10] say this ought to be or that ought to
[29:11] be. It's got to be according to his
[29:14] word, according to his time and season.
[29:16] It must be given according to the person
[29:18] he has chosen to do it.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Now maybe somebody's asking this
[29:21] question that the prophet is saying
[29:22] next. What difference does it make what
[29:24] age you are in? Oh, what are you doing
[29:27] about the hour you're living in? What
[29:29] are you doing for Jesus at this time? He
[29:31] says, "Oh, I want to see him. I want to
[29:33] see the hour." I look and see all these
[29:37] old bodies transformed. See them changed
[29:40] in a moment in a twinkle. If that isn't
[29:42] so, then we're most foolish people. We
[29:44] are just eating, drinking, merry, for
[29:46] tomorrow you die. See, you're just like
[29:48] an animal. You die and you go to dirt
[29:51] and that's all. But there's a mortal
[29:53] immortal soul in you.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; We done heard from heaven. We done seen
[29:58] it proven.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Right. I'm just trying to lay this as a
[30:02] background before we continue. He says
[30:04] you've got to follow the season, the
[30:06] time, and what season you're in. What
[30:09] time make that vindicated to see that is
[30:11] exactly the truth.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[30:19] Now, where where has God called us to
[30:21] now in 2025?
[30:24] Are we just in a state of limbo
[30:26] wondering what's happening? Or are we
[30:30] walking so closely with the spirit? Are
[30:32] we being led by the spirit that we know
[30:35] exactly the time and season that we are
[30:36] living in?
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; We know where the prophet left the
[30:41] earth.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; We know the progression that God has
[30:44] been dealing with the bride.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; And we know where we are right now.
[30:48] Amen.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Is there anything lacking in our
[30:54] spiritual growth?
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Are we tracing our spiritual growth or
[30:59] are we just living day by day, month by
[31:02] month, Amen. without tracking our
[31:04] spiritual growth?
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:13] Now, what are we called to be in this
[31:16] time and season? What is the expectation
[31:19] of us? Amen. That's what I'm trying to
[31:22] ask you. What is our what are we called
[31:24] to be? What is our time and season?
[31:27] Amen. How many if you get what I'm
[31:28] trying to say?
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Because if we are living with the wrong
[31:32] expectation, wrong time and season,
[31:34] we're going to be living, Amen. beneath
[31:36] our privileges.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:46] Let's see what the prophet says
[31:49] in the next one there.
[31:52] He says the bride is to be the word.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Then she's got to be of Christ, part of
[32:00] the bridegroom. She's got to be the
[32:02] word. The word not for his day.
[32:06] the word of this day that he promised
[32:09] would be this day that he sent his word
[32:11] for to mold his bride and maker.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; So what is he doing? He's sending the
[32:17] word. Now this is remember it's
[32:19] important to understand this. That's why
[32:20] he sent the prophet. He sent the prophet
[32:23] with the word to mold her
[32:26] and make her.
[32:29] Amen. Let's read properly now. Hope we
[32:32] see it. Don't get some idea of your own
[32:33] now. Don't take somebody else's idea.
[32:36] Take the vindicated word here, the
[32:37] Bible. God has promised in his word how
[32:40] he would choose his bride in this last
[32:42] day. Did you know that? Amen.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; That by his original plan of choosing
[32:47] Christ, of choosing the times, choosing
[32:50] the seasons, he can't miss it on his
[32:52] bride because she's part of the word.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? When he didn't choose Christ
[32:57] by a denomination, did Christ come to a
[33:00] denomination?
[33:02] No. They rejected him. Well, that's what
[33:04] the denomination done. Then when he
[33:06] chooses the bride, can he come any other
[33:08] way?
[33:08] &gt;&gt; So what is he trying to say? He's not
[33:10] choosing the bride by some denomination.
[33:12] He's choosing it by the word. That's
[33:14] what he's trying to say here.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's very
[33:19] important that last part there. How did
[33:21] he identify him when he come? By a man
[33:23] with the spirit of Elijah on him.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Come out of the wilderness. How will he
[33:28] identify his bride?
[33:30] &gt;&gt; He says he promised Malachi 4.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; The same thing. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[33:38] Now, if we're living where we are saying
[33:40] we're supposed to be living,
[33:42] &gt;&gt; all the way where the life of Christ is
[33:44] supposed to be on display.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; All the way in the headstone,
[33:48] &gt;&gt; then headstone conditions are different
[33:52] from Lethian conditions.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you would know that the
[33:56] prophet says that on that seventh step
[33:58] in the pyramid inside the pyramid there
[34:01] was a little ledge there where there had
[34:04] to be a messenger to lead you into the
[34:06] king's chamber.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; That's where we have been with the
[34:09] prophet and his message.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the same way a tech led her to
[34:15] a point where she now needed to go into
[34:19] the king's chamber.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's a difference in
[34:24] ministries before you get into the
[34:26] king's chamber and after you get into
[34:28] the king's chamber.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Before you get into the king's chamber,
[34:31] if we are taking the story of Esther,
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amon is running a mock.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Ammon is ruling the kingdom.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Ammon has the king signant.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a devil. Now, in your
[34:44] life,
[34:45] &gt;&gt; the devil can run a mock.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; He's plotting against Modiah. He's
[34:50] talking against the cloud.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; He's talking against his prophet.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; He's saying all kinds of things,
[34:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Why? She's not in the presence of the
[34:58] king yet.
[35:00] [Music]
[35:01] &gt;&gt; And she can do nothing about it.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But there's a
[35:06] difference after she gets into the
[35:09] presence of the king.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Now, Amon is under her control.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; What she says about Aan must happen.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happens? Now pay
[35:18] attention because this is typing the
[35:20] seals. After she gets into the presence
[35:22] of King Asus, Ammon's plan is uncovered.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; What is that? The opening of the seven
[35:29] seals, showing the rider and his ride.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Uncovering Satan's scheme of how he is
[35:38] riding to conquer and defeat.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. So once she gets into the
[35:43] king's chamber now she's able to expose.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; The seals are opened.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. The writer is exposed.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; And she's able to control the situation
[35:54] and put him to death.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Now, what about your demons?
[36:01] &gt;&gt; What about your Amen. situations?
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Are you able to control it?
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Or are you running all the time? Now
[36:10] remember the first the first messenger
[36:14] to her was Agi. He gave her gifts
[36:19] and with just gifts
[36:22] she had come through justification,
[36:24] sanctification, restoration of the
[36:26] gifts. With just gifts, she couldn't
[36:28] save her people.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. But
[36:32] &gt;&gt; she had to get to the giver of the
[36:33] gifts.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[36:38] Hallelujah.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; So I want to I want to go
[36:43] not to the next one to the following
[36:45] one. It says and today he's standing.
[36:49] Amen. So what am I saying? You need to
[36:51] get into the presence of the king. Pay
[36:53] attention. And today he's standing
[36:55] amongst us
[36:57] &gt;&gt; in the person of the Holy Ghost
[36:59] manifesting himself more and more.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Coming into his church, making himself
[37:05] known because him and the bride and the
[37:08] groom will be the same. Making himself
[37:11] known.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Now, when I read that they are the same,
[37:18] &gt;&gt; I want to be the same.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; When I'm saying when the property is
[37:25] saying will be the same, which means
[37:28] they have the same potentials. Yes.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; It's just that we can't unlock it
[37:32] because we disbelieve that about
[37:34] ourselves.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; He says
[37:42] the Holy Spirit is coming more and more
[37:44] into the church.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; You see the here's the problem right
[37:48] now, brother Joshua. People hate the
[37:51] Holy Ghost.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; People don't want the Holy Ghost.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; People don't want the Holy Ghost. People
[37:59] feel the Holy Ghost is too restricting.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost doesn't want me to do
[38:04] this.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; If I get the Holy Ghost, I can't watch
[38:07] Netflix.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; If I get the Holy Ghost, I can't watch
[38:09] shows. If I get the Holy Ghost, I can't
[38:12] watch movies. If I get the Holy Ghost, I
[38:14] can't mess around.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Ah, you see it's quiet.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; People don't like the Holy Ghost.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; People like the idea about the Holy
[38:24] Ghost,
[38:25] &gt;&gt; but they don't want the Holy Ghost.
[38:32] Yeah.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Right now, we should be saying amen
[38:36] &gt;&gt; to the word.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I'm not preaching to your
[38:40] feelings. Your feelings may be getting
[38:41] hurt right now. I am not preaching to
[38:43] your feelings. I'm preaching to the
[38:45] spirit man.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to strengthen the spirit man.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; So if your flesh is getting hurt, spirit
[38:52] man, rise up and say, "You deserve it."
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "Flesh, you deserve it." Because
[38:57] the Holy Spirit was meant to tabernacle
[38:59] me.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to say this again. If the
[39:02] bride and groom will be the same, what
[39:04] is our expectation?
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; How come Jesus could go to a blind man
[39:08] and heal the blind man?
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Now same means same.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; If your expectation is lower, that's
[39:14] your problem.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor that's your
[39:16] endowment.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Says same.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; And I can prove it by scripture. If you
[39:25] make me a liar, I can prove it by
[39:27] scripture. Jesus said, "Greater works
[39:28] than these shall you do."
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; But we are struggling to find the
[39:33] greater works. You know why? There's no
[39:34] surrender.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; We were preaching on unlocking the
[39:38] king's favor.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; How did she unlock the king's favor? We
[39:41] missed that important part. She had to
[39:43] go through consecration. She had to go
[39:45] through fasting. She had to go through
[39:46] prayer. Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; We want to get into the king's chamber
[39:49] anyhow
[39:51] &gt;&gt; with our mini skirts,
[39:52] &gt;&gt; with our pants,
[39:54] &gt;&gt; with our bob hair, with our makeup,
[39:57] &gt;&gt; with our earring,
[39:58] &gt;&gt; without skinny jeans.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Young men wearing skinny jeans. You know
[40:03] that's a homosexual thing.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[40:08] &gt;&gt; you like skinny jeans.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; The homosexuals want to see your legs.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[40:14] &gt;&gt; that's why
[40:19] Brother Sunny, unless you went to a
[40:20] comedy show,
[40:22] &gt;&gt; go to Gateway or somewhere,
[40:23] &gt;&gt; you'll see burly men,
[40:26] &gt;&gt; masculine men walking with pink shorts.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; They made it style.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; It's ridiculous.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Why homosexual men are designers? How
[40:38] many of you know?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. Don't act like you
[40:41] don't know this.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; The designers in the fashion world are
[40:44] homosexuals.
[40:45] Yeah,
[40:46] &gt;&gt; true.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; So men were wearing khaki pants
[40:50] &gt;&gt; and baggy pants. Chinos they were
[40:52] wearing.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; What chinos?
[40:58] &gt;&gt; I want to see their legs.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; So they made
[41:06] this. What did I said?
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Skinnies.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Skinnies.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; They made these skinnies. Now you
[41:12] walking with these skinnies. Firstly,
[41:13] you can't even put your leg in that
[41:15] thing.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; It's so tight you can't walk.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Why you don't wear your pants loose?
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Wear your pants loose.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; We are not interested in your leg.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Your leg is for you to walk.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; If we put our bodily organs in the right
[41:38] place and what the purpose of it, your
[41:40] leg is for you to walk.
[41:42] Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Neither are we interested to see the
[41:46] form and shape of woman.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; So when we come into the house of the
[41:53] Lord, we ought to dress appropriately.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Cover yourself. Cover your body.
[42:00] Amen. So I am saying the bride and the
[42:04] groom will be the same.
[42:06] making himself known.
[42:11] You see, we are still believing that the
[42:13] head is disconnected from us. Yet, we
[42:14] saying we're married.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to labor on this point a bit.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Because if the head is here, if the
[42:26] headship is here,
[42:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[42:28] &gt;&gt; then this supposed to be the super
[42:31] church,
[42:32] &gt;&gt; the super race,
[42:34] &gt;&gt; the invincible army. Amen. Praise the
[42:37] Lord. Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; This is supposed to be the church right
[42:40] now.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is supposed to be the church
[42:43] where the sick are healed.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; The dead are raised. Amen. The blind
[42:47] eyes open.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; The deaf ears hear
[42:50] &gt;&gt; the gospel is preached.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got the full restoration of the
[42:54] word, but we're walking around like
[42:56] theologians or professors.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Everywhere we go, we've got our gown. We
[43:00] got graduation gown. We never take the
[43:02] graduation gown off.
[43:07] Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; We let the sick lay.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; I am saying let's prove Jesus Christ the
[43:12] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Let's take him out of history.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Let's take him. Amen. Let's kick the
[43:19] filth out of our houses. Amen. Looks
[43:21] like that's what we need to start doing.
[43:23] Let's start to kick the filthy music out
[43:25] of our houses. Let's start to kick the
[43:26] pop songs of our houses. Let's start to
[43:29] kick the rock songs out of our houses
[43:30] and put godly music back in our houses.
[43:33] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[43:36] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a problem why the bride
[43:41] and groom is not the same.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; There is a definite problem.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; And if you go to any doctor, he's going
[43:46] to diagnose the problem, but you have
[43:48] come to Dr. Jesus this morning and he's
[43:50] diagnosing the problem.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "You want my name, but you
[43:54] don't want me."
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Esther, you are walking in the book of
[43:58] Esther chapter 4 without getting into
[44:00] the king's chamber.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got the name, you
[44:03] married, you got the crown, you got
[44:05] royal accommodation, you got amen, royal
[44:08] food, but no connection.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; I'm disconnected. The king told me if I
[44:14] come into his presence, I'll be killed.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; So, some people believe that the only
[44:19] time they'll be united with Jesus is
[44:21] when he's coming in the clouds of glory.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; And you'll be changed and caught up to
[44:28] meet him. Jesus is not coming for any
[44:31] appetite fairy tale of yours.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus makes preparation. Do you know
[44:37] what the shout is? It's an eastern
[44:39] tradition.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; It's an eastern marriage thing. When the
[44:42] bridegroom is coming with his friends,
[44:44] he shouts. He makes a loud noise because
[44:46] he wants to alert everybody that he's
[44:48] here for his queen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; So he descends with a shout. What is the
[44:53] shout? A message going forth together
[44:56] living saints. Amen.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; He says it's the living bread of life.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Now if we are connected to the
[45:04] headstone, why are we so dead?
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Why aren't we living in pistols of all
[45:09] men? Why don't we carry the fire of God
[45:11] in our souls?
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not excited about anything.
[45:19] We are not excited about church. We are
[45:21] not excited about the religion. We are
[45:23] not excited about the message of the
[45:25] hour. We come in dead. We come in cold,
[45:27] we come in formal, and we go out the
[45:30] same. Amen. We come in miserable and we
[45:32] go out miserable. The message was not
[45:34] sent as a bondage, but the message was
[45:36] sent as freedom.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to be free in the
[45:40] message of the hour. We've got to be
[45:42] rejoicing and present the truth.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm tired of seeing people looking
[45:47] so dull and gloomy, acting like the
[45:49] message is a chain. The message is not a
[45:51] chain. The message is a liberating
[45:54] force.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time we proudly proclaim.
[46:00] Amen. People in the message of the hour,
[46:02] whether it's two or three of us. Amen.
[46:04] Young people, whether it's just a few of
[46:07] us, Amen. We got to say, I'm so proud to
[46:09] be identified with the message of the
[46:12] hour. Amen. I am not ashamed of the
[46:14] gospel of Jesus Christ.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd rather be counted for Jesus
[46:19] now while it's shun upon. Amen. While
[46:21] they walk, Amen. I choose to stand for
[46:24] Jesus.
[46:25] Yes, Lord.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; It was so gloomy. Amen. It was so dull.
[46:31] Amen. Hallelujah.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; The bride and the groom will be the
[46:37] same.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; When in heaven, I don't want it. Hey,
[46:42] &gt;&gt; now.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Now, are we the sons of God?
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] Oh hallelujah. He says one day the one
[46:58] that you feel in your heart sees
[47:00] identification will become personalized
[47:02] before you.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; You're you're united with the word by
[47:05] the word and the word was in the
[47:07] beginning will go back to the beginning
[47:09] which is God. At that day now here he
[47:11] brings our scripture. At that day which
[47:14] is this day you'll know that I'm in the
[47:16] father the father in me. I in you. You
[47:18] in me. That's marriage right?
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We keep saying these things for
[47:21] repetition. Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Until we get it.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Now I want to get to the next one, but I
[47:30] want to get to paragraph 177 then. Now
[47:33] if we are saying we are in the headstone
[47:35] age,
[47:37] &gt;&gt; then it's got to have end time
[47:38] conditions. He says the word the evening
[47:41] message must carry evening results.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know what's the expectation up in
[47:48] the headstone?
[47:51] perfection.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; The expectation up here in the
[47:55] headstone. You say, "Brother, are we in
[47:57] the headstone?" Paul writes it another
[47:59] way in Ephesians chapter one. He says,
[48:01] "You are called into heavenly places."
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The word, the evening
[48:09] message must carry evening results.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; The evening message must sew evening
[48:15] seed or I told you, you got to recognize
[48:18] time and season.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't be sewing morning time
[48:21] seeds in the evening time.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; The evening message must sew evening
[48:30] seed, not morning seed. Evening seed.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray the Holy Spirit is trying
[48:37] to awaken us.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; We are trying to sow for later and age.
[48:41] Amen. We are trying to sew for later and
[48:43] condition.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; I am not in Leosia.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[48:48] Amen. That's right.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And if you're in Leosia,
[48:52] &gt;&gt; if you're in Leosia, then let me call
[48:53] you out. Come out of her, my people.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of our sins.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; If you're in Lucia, then I must come
[49:02] week after week and call you. Come out
[49:03] of her, my people. Be not partakers of
[49:06] our sin. But the fact that you are
[49:07] sitting here this morning shows that you
[49:09] have come out of latest fear. You have
[49:12] responded to the call of the shout.
[49:13] Amen. And you have caught up into
[49:15] heavenly places. Hallelujah.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; You are called into the headstone age,
[49:21] but Satan doesn't want you to recognize
[49:23] where you are, that you are seated now
[49:25] in heavenly places.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; How many of you know the prophet of God
[49:30] teaches us? Everything must be believed
[49:32] by faith.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Even this what I'm telling you now that
[49:35] you are caught up in the headstone must
[49:37] be believed by faith. Even that quote
[49:39] there about you being exactly the same
[49:41] as Jesus must be believed by faith.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, nothing will
[49:45] happen. Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; For example, if I know the word says
[49:49] these signs shall follow them that
[49:51] believe. If I lay hands upon the sick,
[49:53] they shall recover as long as I don't
[49:54] believe that and don't lay my hands and
[49:56] nothing will happen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Nothing will happen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; But here, brother Josh comes and he
[50:01] believes the scripture.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And he says, I'm going to lay hands on
[50:04] the sick.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; And take the promise of the word and
[50:07] they shall recover. Because his
[50:09] expectation, he believes the word, this
[50:11] brother shall recover.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am saying take what I'm saying
[50:15] to you now and start to live in it.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Start to ask the Lord, Lord, if I'm
[50:20] living in a headstone age, if this is
[50:21] the age of perfection, if this is the
[50:23] age where sons are to be a
[50:24] manifestation, I want to see it
[50:26] manifested in my life.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; And then when God presents a situation
[50:31] to you, don't run away from it.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Josh was telling you on
[50:36] Wednesday
[50:38] &gt;&gt; that he needed a certain amount of
[50:39] money.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Cash.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; He wanted a certain amount of money
[50:45] cash. I'm just trying to give you this
[50:46] example. Amen. He needed cash. Now, he
[50:50] prayed the prayer in the morning.
[50:53] The opportunity arose during the day.
[50:56] Somebody said, "I've got a case. I need
[50:58] you to represent me in court."
[51:02] &gt;&gt; What in case he said, "I'm too busy.
[51:03] It's a Friday."
[51:09] If he said he's too busy,
[51:12] &gt;&gt; it's a Friday.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; I want to go home early and look at
[51:15] Sister Vanessa's eyes.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; What would have happened?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; The prayer that he prayed,
[51:25] &gt;&gt; God was already providing the answer.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; But who could have stopped it?
[51:33] &gt;&gt; You don't believe me? Go to Genesis
[51:36] chapter 2.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; It's 11:23.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody claim Mark 11:23 there.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; If we go to Genesis chapter 2, I just
[51:53] want to show you something that God can
[51:55] have everything set for you.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; He can have everything in place.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; He can have seeds in the ground.
[52:03] You can have your life set in order,
[52:05] &gt;&gt; but you can't be there like a
[52:12] &gt;&gt; inactive participant.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:17] Let's get to Genesis chapter 2 here. And
[52:20] I just want to show you something.
[52:26] Let's go to verse 5. Okay. Let's read
[52:28] from verse four. Let's see God setting
[52:31] everything up for us. How many of you
[52:33] believe God knows the end from the
[52:34] beginning?
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know. I know the thoughts and
[52:38] plans for you.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Every blessing
[52:41] that God has for you is already being
[52:43] given to you.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; It's all locked up in the word.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Right? You are already blessed.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; You are already raptured.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; You are already perfected.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Right? Well, watch this now. These are
[52:55] the generations of the heavens and earth
[52:57] when they were created in the day that
[53:00] the Lord had made the heavens and earth.
[53:02] Earth and heavens, right? Every plant of
[53:05] the field before it was in the earth,
[53:09] every herb of the field before it grew.
[53:11] Now, how does it happen?
[53:14] He's saying God got plants before it was
[53:16] in the earth.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; He's got herbs in the field before it
[53:21] grew.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; God is seeing what he wants. Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; If you're a farmer, you must already
[53:30] start to see your crop.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; If you're trusting the Lord for a
[53:33] situation, already believe you have
[53:35] received it.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Abraham spoke like God. He believed
[53:38] those. He called those things which were
[53:40] not as though they are.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; What did John Ryan do? He was blind as a
[53:43] bat,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; but he kept saying, "Praise God, I'm
[53:46] healed."
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God, I'm healed. Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; So God is saying before the plant of the
[53:50] field was in the earth and every field
[53:52] and every herb of the field before it
[53:55] grew. Now here's the reason why.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; For the Lord God had not caused it to
[54:00] rain upon the earth and there was not a
[54:03] man to till the ground.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; There must be your part.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; The seeds are laying there.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yes,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; even the first part could have been
[54:18] open. God could have caused the rain to
[54:21] come on the earth.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; But what is required in the law
[54:25] &gt;&gt; somebody to tell
[54:27] &gt;&gt; that's where we are lazy.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; We locked up in our room. Lord, I need a
[54:32] promotion. I need a better job. How
[54:34] about you update your CV?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Does anybody know you're looking for a
[54:41] job? No.
[54:44] Lord, I'm leaving my windows open. Every
[54:46] day I'm singing the windows of heaven
[54:48] are open.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; What are you doing to till your soil?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Hey, you brothers that got business, did
[54:56] you all take your products and leave it
[54:58] in the shop and go home? That thing is
[55:01] going to sell itself.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Your product sell itself.
[55:12] You've got to till.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; You've got to work.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; You've got to labor.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Now, when you are faithful in that, hold
[55:20] God to his promise.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; We've got to know how to operate the
[55:23] word. Hold God to his promise.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Because you know how the Lord operates.
[55:27] He comes and he holds you accountable
[55:29] for what he's given you.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; You know that in Matthew 25,
[55:33] &gt;&gt; he comes here, he holds you accountable.
[55:34] What have you done with what I have
[55:35] given you?
[55:37] &gt;&gt; You can be quicker.
[55:41] You are now taken accountable with what
[55:43] he has given you.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; You can go to the Lord in prayer and
[55:46] say, "Lord, I have managed what you have
[55:47] given me faithfully.
[55:51] What you have given me, I have managed
[55:52] it faithfully.
[55:54] According to me, I have
[55:57] taken it to the
[55:59] to the borders of this. I can't stretch
[56:02] this any further. Why don't you multiply
[56:04] it for me?"
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, you trusted me with this and I
[56:08] managed it well. You say not so.
[56:12] You say not so.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles chapter 4.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; You telling me you can't petition God to
[56:22] enlarge your borders.
[56:25] Amen. Is it 1 Chronicles 4? I think it's
[56:28] 10 somewhere there.
[56:32] Jabz
[56:34] &gt;&gt; called on the God of Israel saying now
[56:38] let me background this the land was
[56:41] marked out
[56:42] &gt;&gt; yes
[56:43] &gt;&gt; by Joshua
[56:45] &gt;&gt; territory was given by the elders
[56:48] &gt;&gt; how many of you agree
[56:50] &gt;&gt; they were allocated a certain portion of
[56:52] land
[56:54] &gt;&gt; but this man Jabz had a vision so big
[56:57] &gt;&gt; yes
[56:59] &gt;&gt; that the land wasn't able to contain
[57:00] aining
[57:01] &gt;&gt; what they gave him was not suitable.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; What they gave him was not enough.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; So instead of consulting the elders and
[57:10] saying hey you gave me a small portion
[57:12] of land but my vision is bigger he
[57:14] consults a higher power.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; And God Jabas called on the God of
[57:19] Israel saying oh that thou would bless
[57:21] me indeed.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; So is anything wrong to ask God to bless
[57:24] you?
[57:25] &gt;&gt; If you don't ask him to bless you that's
[57:27] your enda. Yes.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; All that thou wouldest bless me indeed
[57:31] and enlarge my coast.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; That means enlarge my border.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Enlarge my portion and that thine hand
[57:40] might be with me and thou would escape
[57:42] me from evil that it may not grieve me.
[57:46] And look at what God does. And God
[57:49] granted him that which he requested.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:57] We sitting miserable but we're not
[57:59] speaking.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; We come now to the end of the message.
[58:03] The prophet is speaking. The spoken word
[58:05] is the original seed.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; But we are speaking every other word.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the original seed
[58:14] &gt;&gt; we are speaking. Nothing good ever
[58:16] happens to me.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Nothing ever good comes to me.
[58:24] Your words are so powerful and you
[58:26] actually believe it. So nothing good
[58:27] ever happens to you.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; I've been working for this company for
[58:32] 20 years. They have never given me an
[58:35] increase.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Instead of saying, "Lord, I thank you.
[58:39] I've been working faithfully for 20
[58:40] years for this company. I pray Lord that
[58:42] you make me find favor in the eyes of
[58:44] the boss. May they recognize my
[58:46] potential and I thank you for the
[58:47] increase that you have already given
[58:49] me."
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; You got to speak what you want.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; That's how you speak like God.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman who had a drunk husband,
[59:05] &gt;&gt; she went around, hey, this drunkard,
[59:07] this drunk, she didn't go there doing
[59:08] that.
[59:11] You tell everyone your husband is a
[59:12] drunkard.
[59:15] Then your husband is a drunkard
[59:17] according to your confession.
[59:21] But what in case you change your
[59:22] confession?
[59:24] I thank you Lord. My husband is
[59:26] delivered of this addiction.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; I thank you Lord. He's the most loving
[59:30] man.
[59:31] I thank you Lord that he has changed his
[59:33] ways. I thank you for the blood.
[59:37] And I thank you Lord that the next time
[59:38] he drinks,
[59:42] it'll be the blood of Jesus that is
[59:44] washing him and cleansing him.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And he'll never desire it no more.
[59:50] The woman that had an abusive husband
[59:52] and was taking food and throwing it
[59:54] against the wall, she maintained her
[59:57] testimony.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; She maintained her confession.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; She said, "Must Jesus bear the cross
[1:00:02] alone and all the world go free?"
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; No. There's a cross for you and there's
[1:00:06] a cross for me.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; That confession made a made those people
[1:00:12] see the Christian character.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; They came repenting. They gave their
[1:00:18] hearts to the Lord Jesus.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; So don't think, don't be fooled by you
[1:00:22] phoning everybody now, telling your
[1:00:25] telling everyone what a horrible person
[1:00:27] your wife is and what an a horrible
[1:00:29] person your husband is is going to
[1:00:30] change the situation.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, when his wife when he
[1:00:38] came home and the wife was grumbling
[1:00:40] about him not hitting Joseph
[1:00:42] and she was upset with him, what she
[1:00:45] went did
[1:00:47] He took an apron
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; and he started to
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; wash the dishes.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; He started to wash the dishes.
[1:01:00] You know, not all of you have to go wash
[1:01:02] dishes, but I'm saying you got to know
[1:01:04] your wife.
[1:01:06] Sometimes she likes chomp. You got to go
[1:01:08] buy the chomp.
[1:01:09] Amen. Sometimes she likes flowers. You
[1:01:11] got to go buy the flowers. So, you got
[1:01:14] to know your wife. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; So you can change the situation.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; We want to control atmospheres.
[1:01:24] We want to control demon powers. We want
[1:01:26] to control every other situation. You
[1:01:28] can't control your tongue.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Let's close now. Amen.
[1:01:45] So we were reading the quote the word
[1:01:48] the evening message must carry evening
[1:01:50] results. So I'm saying the headstone
[1:01:51] must carry headstone results.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; The evening message must sow evening
[1:01:58] seed. Not morning seed, evening seed.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; How many of you know why the prophet is
[1:02:03] saying this?
[1:02:06] Let's see how good we are. because he
[1:02:08] said this messenger will sow for two
[1:02:10] rains.
[1:02:13] You'll sew the former rain. So the
[1:02:16] former rain is for the morning seed and
[1:02:19] the latter rain is for the
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; evening seed.
[1:02:23] So he says the evening messenger must
[1:02:25] sow evening seed, not morning seed,
[1:02:28] evening seed. Is that right?
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray you are not bored by
[1:02:33] the message that God has sent us.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:02:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; We're trying to learn how to operate in
[1:02:41] our position out of the headstone.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; The midday scene, it seeds back there
[1:02:49] was denomination. It died, perished. But
[1:02:52] evening time message will show evening
[1:02:54] time light.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Will show evening time results. The
[1:02:58] evening time message.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Jesus time midday
[1:03:03] message showed midday results. The
[1:03:06] beginning message showed the beginning
[1:03:08] results. Made creation. He made his son
[1:03:10] in his own image in the midday. In the
[1:03:12] evening time, he makes a bride for it.
[1:03:16] What? By his word.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; How did he form the earth? How did he
[1:03:21] speak it into existence? By his word.
[1:03:24] What was his son? The word. And the word
[1:03:27] was made flesh. How will he take his
[1:03:28] bride? By the word.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:33] In 178 there he says the evening time he
[1:03:37] promised he would reveal open the seven
[1:03:40] seals show what them churches has missed
[1:03:42] back there. Revelation 10, Malachi 4,
[1:03:46] Luke 17:30. He said he would do it. Now
[1:03:48] let's not mix it up. Let's keep it right
[1:03:51] like that.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Want to close with this because I want
[1:03:54] to get use this for the launching pad
[1:03:56] for the next one. Right.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] He's talking about the pyramid going up
[1:04:03] to the king's chamber.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And just before you hit the seventh
[1:04:08] wall, there's a little introduction
[1:04:09] plank there where a messenger comes out
[1:04:12] to bring you to the king.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Right? He's saying the same way John the
[1:04:16] Baptist introduced Jesus, but the
[1:04:18] headstone was rejected.
[1:04:20] Now, they didn't know the stone of scone
[1:04:23] or whatever it is. They didn't know
[1:04:25] where it's at because it's a rejected
[1:04:27] stone. But that's the stone that caps
[1:04:29] the whole thing that makes it the
[1:04:30] pyramid through the complete seven
[1:04:32] church ages. Add grace. Add this. Amen.
[1:04:36] The last one is Christ. Add this to your
[1:04:38] charity. Add grace.
[1:04:40] And something else till it gets up to
[1:04:42] Christ in the headstone.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And I am the door.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Remember, we've been through the door
[1:04:50] now.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; So, he's saying we've got to leave.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and come up now to that
[1:04:56] seventh step
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; where you're going to enter the
[1:04:58] headstone age where you're united with
[1:05:01] Christ
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; married to Christ and there Christ is
[1:05:05] the door and you know what you need the
[1:05:07] key and we spoke about revelation being
[1:05:10] the key he says we've got to be magnifi
[1:05:12] magnetized to the headstone
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; oh yes
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; you see why I'm saying brother Brandham
[1:05:17] is talking about metal pieces
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; and he says there's got to be this great
[1:05:22] magnet that comes across the factory
[1:05:24] that picks up these metal pieces.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Now, we've had the message of the hour,
[1:05:29] the shout
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; that has come like a great magnet
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; and pulled us out of Leosia.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He says we've got to be magnifi
[1:05:38] magnetized to that headstone. That
[1:05:40] headstone is the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; And every one of us has got that
[1:05:45] magnetism of the Holy Spirit. When the
[1:05:48] stone strikes the image, the church will
[1:05:50] flee to it back into glory. She will be
[1:05:52] taken up at the rapture of the saints
[1:05:54] when she goes forth in that day.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:11] Let's uh skip the next one there.
[1:06:15] I want to get to paragraph. It says 261.
[1:06:20] We'll read this and then we'll close.
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:26] He says, "Notice,
[1:06:28] you are a son of God in the house of
[1:06:31] God."
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; You are a part of God's economy.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; What does part of God's economy means?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Being part of God's economy means
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; it takes care of your finances.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; It takes care of your protection.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; It takes care of your daily needs.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes care of your spiritual
[1:06:49] wellbeing. That's all the economy.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Right. He also Amen. drops the charges.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Because the enemy charges you.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; But Romans 8:1 says he dropped the
[1:07:02] charges.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; If there's no condemnation, which means
[1:07:06] the case is dismissed.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to get to let's get to 262.
[1:07:19] He says the Lutheran under
[1:07:20] justification. This is very important
[1:07:22] now. We're going to close. The feet
[1:07:24] raised it like that. Wesley under
[1:07:26] sanctification, the Pentecostal under
[1:07:28] the arms, the works and deeds and so
[1:07:32] forth. Right? Now remember Pentecostals
[1:07:35] later
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; don't confuse it now.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Right? Had to be legalist. Now he says,
[1:07:43] listen to this everyone. Read this. But
[1:07:45] now
[1:07:47] we come to the head.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Where are we?
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; But now we come to the head.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; The capstone. Grace. Grace. The capstone
[1:08:02] cry.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So is everybody clear
[1:08:06] that the prophet is separating us from
[1:08:08] the lenos?
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. He's saying now we come to
[1:08:12] the capstone.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Grace. Grace. The headstone crying what?
[1:08:26] Grace. Grace. Pass from death and creed
[1:08:29] into a living word of the living God.
[1:08:31] God's only provided plan for his age.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Hey, Lord.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Time and season. If you are not in the
[1:08:39] headstone, you're not in God's provided
[1:08:41] place of worship.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It is saying God's only provided place.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's read this again, church.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; He says we we're into a living word.
[1:08:50] Now, remember, he says the shout is a
[1:08:52] living bread of life.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; That's the living word.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; So, we are in the shout of the living
[1:08:57] God. God's only provided plan for his
[1:09:00] age.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; God's only provided plan for his age.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:09] Yes.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; What we are trying to do is take the
[1:09:12] opening of the word, the message of the
[1:09:14] hour, and trying to live in latest year
[1:09:15] with it.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And later is cold.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Latest year is lukewarm.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; You're wondering why the message is not
[1:09:25] working in latest year.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; It's wretched.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; it's poor.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; The outside of it, listen, the outside
[1:09:34] of it, they rich. They increase with
[1:09:37] goods.
[1:09:38] They have need of nothing.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; But you're trying to live inside the
[1:09:41] latest year and age with the message of
[1:09:43] the hour. You're miserable,
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; cold,
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; wretched,
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; blind.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Naked.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; You don't know it.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; You are not called to take a headstone
[1:09:55] message and live in Lady C.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] Right. Let's read this.
[1:10:10] God's only provided plan for his age. I
[1:10:12] want you all to say this because this is
[1:10:13] the crux of the message. The only
[1:10:15] provided plan for this age
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; is for me
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; is for me
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; to be in the headstone.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; His sons in the word age quickened by
[1:10:29] the spirit like a spark that's lit off
[1:10:32] of something to make it alive. and
[1:10:35] seated now in heavenly places. Now watch
[1:10:38] he's saying in present tense
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; already alive
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; and subject to every promise in the word
[1:10:47] then what does he do? You being a part
[1:10:50] of God's gene, a part of the word, other
[1:10:53] men a part of God's word, seated
[1:10:55] together
[1:10:57] like what's happening here this morning.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Manifest the entire body of Christ
[1:11:03] because there's no leaven amongst you.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; No leaven amongst you. Just the word
[1:11:08] seated in heavenly places in the door
[1:11:10] where he put his name Christ Jesus. No
[1:11:13] leaven among you that brings the entire
[1:11:16] fullness of the godhead bodily among
[1:11:18] you. Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Can you see the super church?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; But we want to dysfellowship one
[1:11:24] another.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; The super church is relying on us being
[1:11:27] united.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Because us being united is bringing the
[1:11:32] fullness of the Godhead amongst us.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; No leaven among you. That brings the
[1:11:41] entire fullness of the Godhead among
[1:11:43] you. Oh, I I want to say this because we
[1:11:45] need to stop here. Somebody's not paying
[1:11:47] attention.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know what that means?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; If you saw Jesus, what would that mean
[1:11:55] to you right now?
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "The fullness of the
[1:11:59] God, it was locked up in Jesus."
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; What is he saying here?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; When we are seated together in heavenly
[1:12:11] places,
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; no leaven amongst us.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; No differences. Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; It brings what?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; It brings the fullness. Oh, he actually
[1:12:26] uses another word. The entire fullness
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; of the godhead bodily among you.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; I think that's the key why we can't see
[1:12:35] the super church super race.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; The moment somebody leaves this church,
[1:12:40] ha,
[1:12:42] we got rid of them.
[1:12:45] Now we think they are separate raptures.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And separate heavens.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:12:55] If you want to see the fullness of the
[1:12:56] godhead in the church, get rid of petty
[1:13:00] differences.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Forgive
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; and forget. Say, "Brother, you are my
[1:13:06] brother."
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I'm starting to dislike it
[1:13:10] when people talk about other message
[1:13:12] ministers.
[1:13:14] profusely.
[1:13:17] Even if
[1:13:21] there's portions of what they are saying
[1:13:22] is incorrect,
[1:13:24] I would rather be on their side,
[1:13:27] united with my brother because they
[1:13:29] believe the message of the hour.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Than to be associated with some
[1:13:36] denominational chicken preacher.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; I would rather be associated with a
[1:13:40] message pastor.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; That's standing for present day truth.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Present day word.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Than to be trying to fight one another.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; You know what we're trying to do?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; We got a forefront battle here. One
[1:13:56] fighting this side, one fighting that
[1:13:57] side. Now we we leading the battle here
[1:14:00] and we're shooting this pastor.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Don't do that.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says if somebody got
[1:14:07] the ball, don't see try and take the
[1:14:10] ball away. see how you can support him.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Hey, I I don't think people are seeing
[1:14:15] this.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; What does this mean to bring the entire
[1:14:20] fullness of the God in amongst us?
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; If I told you Genesis 1, that God is
[1:14:29] going to be among you. Would that make
[1:14:32] any difference to you? The one that
[1:14:34] created heavens and earth.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; The ones that spoke and said, "Let there
[1:14:38] be." He's saying that God
[1:14:42] is going to be among you.
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:55] He couldn't do it in Luther's age.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; He couldn't bring the fullness. Now, you
[1:15:03] know why the headstone was rejected?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; The headstone is cut a certain way. It
[1:15:09] can't fit on Luther's foundation there.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't make an exact fit.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't fit on Wesley's foundation.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't fit on the Pentecostal
[1:15:20] foundation.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:23] So it had to wait. That's why they
[1:15:24] rejected the stone. If I gave you
[1:15:26] something, you don't know what to do
[1:15:27] with it. What you going to do? You'll
[1:15:28] leave it one side.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; That's what they did with it.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; That's why the Pentecostals rejected
[1:15:35] Brother Brandham's message. They didn't
[1:15:36] know what to do with it.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; It wasn't for them.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to close now. Couldn't do it
[1:15:44] in Luther's age. Couldn't do it in
[1:15:46] Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in the
[1:15:47] Pentecostal age. But in the day when the
[1:15:50] son of man will be manifested, revealed,
[1:15:52] brought back, the church together with
[1:15:55] the entire deity of God amongst his
[1:16:01] people.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; The entire deity. Am I supposed to
[1:16:12] expect something? Uh now here's where we
[1:16:15] find the balance again because people
[1:16:17] are saying we got the opening of the
[1:16:18] word we don't need other things we don't
[1:16:20] need manifestation we don't need
[1:16:22] healings we don't need this we got the
[1:16:23] opening of the word let's bring the
[1:16:25] balance
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; if the entire deity is here he says
[1:16:31] entire deity
[1:16:34] showing the same visible signs
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; manifesting himself like he did at the
[1:16:40] beginning when he was manifested on
[1:16:42] earth in the form of a prophet God.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Glory promised by Malachi 4, promised by
[1:16:48] the rest of the scripture where you
[1:16:49] worship at the house of God seated in
[1:16:53] present tense.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:03] I want to close with this because
[1:17:08] I don't think we understand what we what
[1:17:10] we have.
[1:17:13] There's 258.
[1:17:16] I know some of you just want to close
[1:17:17] the service and go.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; It's fine.
[1:17:22] We're laboring here now.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody must till the soil.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] He says in our bodies with speaking with
[1:17:34] new tongues prophesying. Oh, you see
[1:17:37] this is what what message is this?
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; 65 1965 the Easter seals. Why I'm
[1:17:45] telling you this? I'm your pastor. I
[1:17:46] need to tell you stuff.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; People tell you that we're in the
[1:17:50] opening of the word now. We don't need
[1:17:51] certain things. Here is the prophet of
[1:17:53] God, the prophet of the age. After the
[1:17:56] opening of the word,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; he's saying, "And now in our bodies with
[1:18:00] speaking with new tongues, with
[1:18:02] prophesying and foreseeing, laying hands
[1:18:05] on the sick, and they recover the world,
[1:18:07] dead, and all the things of the world,
[1:18:09] we've passed from death unto life, and
[1:18:12] now hold the
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Lord."
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Now, if you are called to live in the
[1:18:23] headstone, hear what he says. There
[1:18:25] ain't enough devils in hell to keep us
[1:18:27] from doing it.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing what he's saying?
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; There's no amount of demons in hell to
[1:18:33] stop you from prophesying
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; to stop you from laying hands on the
[1:18:36] sick
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; to stop you. Amen. From fulfilling every
[1:18:39] promise of God.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; He's saying there ain't enough devils in
[1:18:42] hell to keep us from doing it. We were
[1:18:45] forained of God for this hour. So let
[1:18:47] them bring 200 million demons on the
[1:18:49] earth. He says even they are not enough
[1:18:51] to stop us.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; In the headstone is atomic warfare.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; We hold all power in the headstone.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't Don't bow down for these
[1:19:06] little demon powers, sicknesses, and
[1:19:08] diseases. They try to cast on your life
[1:19:10] and ask you all kinds of stupid
[1:19:12] questions when you go to the doctor.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; For every other thing they tell you, you
[1:19:18] are an individual. You are individually
[1:19:20] accountable. When you come to sickness,
[1:19:22] your father had this.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; What do you want to know about my
[1:19:27] father?
[1:19:30] Even if my father had it, it stops with
[1:19:32] me.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I said it.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; The doctor might tell, listen to me, the
[1:19:37] doctor might tell you it's hereditary.
[1:19:40] The doctor might tell you it's genetic.
[1:19:42] The doctor might tell you that this
[1:19:44] thing will be passed down through
[1:19:45] generations. You tell him doctor I stand
[1:19:48] here today
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; and I am stopping it. He says what gives
[1:19:52] you the authority to stop it? My God
[1:19:54] gives me the authority to stop it right
[1:19:56] now.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Come on now. He says they'll stop
[1:20:01] sicknesses. They'll stop cancer.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Who's going to do it?
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; You're going to die and wait for
[1:20:07] somebody else to do it.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You're alive now. Do something about it.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If we are not the people
[1:20:16] called to manifest sons and daughters of
[1:20:17] God on the earth right now, then we all
[1:20:19] rather die and go to the grave and let
[1:20:21] God raise up another generation that's
[1:20:24] got the courage to take the sword of the
[1:20:26] spirit to take the word of God and be
[1:20:28] able to operate the word of God.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; How many of you got sickness in your
[1:20:36] body right now?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me see your hands. Anyone's
[1:20:39] got sickness in their body right now?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. How about we take God at his word?
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We are standing in the
[1:20:45] presence of sons and daughters of God
[1:20:47] who carry the portion of deity right
[1:20:49] here right now. We'll stop sickness
[1:20:51] right now. We'll stop cancer right now.
[1:20:54] We'll stop all manner of sicknesses
[1:20:56] right now.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; If thou can believe then all things are
[1:20:59] possible.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, I'm not trying to walk
[1:21:02] you up. I'm telling you Jesus Christ is
[1:21:05] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
