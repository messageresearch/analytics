Fields amen that's Pastor Ros maunga amen he's got a church there and they in a rented building at the moment the church is under construction amen I'll show you a picture of the church just now amen so they actually at the beam phase where they're going to lay the roof but it's taking them 3 years just to get to that stage because the economy is not too good amen so they they take and they're building it on their own they don't have any financial support amen so the service was really blessed amen here we spoke on a man the bride with vision and showing them how we are to be a people with vision amen this is some of his congregation uh Friday morning we went to East Le Tabernacle this is one of the main churches in Zimbabwe amen you'll see it's quite a large Church this was the Friday morning it was a public holiday so not all the Believers were there but there was a good portion of Believers there uh if you ever heard of brother chess a blessing amen this is where brother kichi and brother Moses and all of these brothers initially come from this church a lot of the ministry started out of this church amen and yeah we spoke on uh amen the seals were open so that Sons could be manifested and that's Pastor blessing amen is this is a time of consecration after the service you can see the church was really moved amen really touched by the services we just going through these pictures very quickly amen this is a pastor blessing amen mani and these were some of the pastors that were in the meeting you can see Pastor Moses there amen Pastor Pichi another Pastor there amen this is Sister chess of blessing I didn't get to meet a husband he had passed on in a in a boating accident remember I don't know if you remember a few years ago he fell off the boat and they couldn't find his body they found it after a few weeks he was the pastor of the church this is his wife a man still at the church this was the Cornerstone that was laid by him I like his inspiration because they built the shirts quite some time ago and if you can see right at the bottom he's got Revelation 10 8 to11 so he had recognized our part of the ministry amen praise the Lord amen and this was the afternoon service at uh buo this is Pastor kichi church and Pastor Moses and Pastor blessing had come through as well amen for that Services these are some other pastors there amen if you remember this pastor on Amen brother Noel he also came Amen to see me and uh that's Pastor Noel if you remember Pastor n amen he's also got a church there in arar and that's another pastor of his these are some worms I was forced to eat some tree worms they told me amen if I can conquer the culture if I can eat one of those worms amen so I said I am more than able so I had one of it it was very crunchy amen I know he don't look too good but it had no taste in particular you know he didn't have any taste but they eat that those worms are starters and things and it's got a lot of protein amen praise the Lord and these are some of the African dishes they told me to try out he didn't look too bad so I said okay I'll try it out amen so that was my plate you can see my plate didn't look too bad I was selective in what I chose and these were the brothers that were there for the fellowship amen so here's where amen they wanted to know more about the angel of the Lord in Exodus 23 and all of these things and this is I got to tell them about it amen and uh they were very very interested like grasped it very well amen Sunday morning this is again now uh at up 7 in the morning at pastor rhos church this is the rented building it's like a L-shaped church amen there are spok on changing positions and this is his uh building that they currently building you can see it's quite a beautiful building that they are putting up so they have good Vision there and they have good leadership so the Zimbabwe economy is very terrible so the currency is like uh non-existent there is a currency but there's another currency that operates which is the US dollar so they purchased they've converted their way of thinking even and everything they operate is with the US doll amen so can you imagine now if you're buying a sandwich it's $18 for me that's like 324 R and I'm thinking uh I don't want a sandwich for 300 R but then the brother said no you don't need to convert it just think US dollar cuz once you convert it you get very depressed so you amen you can't keep converting it amen so I just wanted to share those pics with you I have some other videos I took more videos than pictures and uh I just thought I'll share some of those things with you but I also wanted to share and Pastor blessing from eastly Tabernacle sent me a message the other day to tell me of a testimony and I thought it'll be encouraging for me to share the testimony with you because we don't believe in a a gospel that has got no manifestation amen amen so Friday morning I preached on the seals were open to bring Sons to manifestation and uh I was sharing with them how when God speaks he don't speak what he sees he speaks what he wants I took them to Genesis 1 and I showed them how God was looking at a dark form void world but when he looks he doesn't say hey what a formless void world he don't speak the problem but he spoke what he wanted to see and he said let there be light so I started to show them how the seals came to reposition as the sons of God and we now possess the ability to speak like that amen amen so that was the core of the sermon and uh so he told me after that service the brothers now in AR there's a lot of places with no water kind of like maybe year some of our places don't have water for months and weeks and whatever so they dig B holes so they were digging for a b hole after that morning service the Friday morning service and they had dug around the neighborhood and come up to the neighbor's yard and they kept eating dry wall dry wall is meaning there's no water around there so they were preparing to bring that drilling machine into their yard the believer's yard and the son told the father what's the Chan of us getting water here we've dug the entire neighbors houses and things there's no water he says there's a very slim chance we'll get it so the father told him didn't you hear what the pastor preached amen God don't speak what he sees he speaks what he want God said let there be light so I am saying Let There Be Water amen amen when they dug they hit the B hole and there's only water on their property amen let's give God praise now for me a big testimony because I wasn't on the scene all I did was present the word of God and somebody can take the word and apply it with faith amen and that's what the fful ministry is to do to position Sons and Daughters of God Amen and I believe there are many more testimonies the word is a seed it's swn now amen hallelujah and and you find amen even Pastor kich I was telling the church on Wednesday he's got a rare quality about him in that although he's an elder he's able ble to draw from younger Ministries and glean from them and learn from them and he's not afraid to say that I'm learning about this and can you show me more about this like when I told him about the angel of the Lord and how we need to connect with him amen he said bring that chair and tell me about it more so as we started to unfold these things he started to see these things and rejoice around these truths amen then again I was telling you that on Wednesday even Pastor Moses pH me and we spoke for another 2 hours he's wanting to learn more things deeper things amen hallelujah so we are glad amen that the ministry can go out and be a blessing amen and I seen that scripture come to pass where a prophet is without honor except in his own country amen because you get used to me preaching week after week amen hallelujah but when they hear it they hearing it fresh amen so they appreciate the word of the Lord and they did ask me to convey the greetings to the Church all the churches that I went to said greet the church and also to ask you to pray for them amen you see the Believers that left Zimbabwe didn't leave there for no reason the economy is really tough so they are trying to find a better way of life and a better economy but not all of them can leave Zimbabwe so there are a lot of Believers that are are back there amen and for them it's very difficult to live so they they covered your prayers amen and I started to tell them amen that they need to start to operate in their own economy about how God's economy is different from the world economy amen so I believe that Zimbabwe is right for the Supernatural and the miraculous before because of the hard conditions that they are under amen you don't have to have faith to buy a loaf of bread Hallelujah but they have to have faith amen so I pray amen that you keep them in prayer they were very blessed I can tell you that and uh they also said I must tell the church you'll find it on the video in easta he says tell the church that the Lord used you mightily to minister to the people of Zimbabwe so I'm just telling you what they are telling me amen so we're going to stand now for the reading of the word amen I pray you'll let a blessed service here as well amen amen rejoicing around the present day truths Hallelujah we'll turn to Second Peter chapter 1 from verse 12 it says wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth amen hallelujah to be established in the present truth amen the Lord are blessings to reading of his word you may be seated amen I'd like to speak this morning on the changing of masks the changing of masks my thought might be simple I may not be too long but I want you to get this point because I want to bring you and establish you in the present truth if we don't see ourselves the way God is expecting to see us in 2025 our expectation will be wrong and we can't receive what is Promised for today for example if we are trying to manifest the opening of the seals now in 2025 it won't work because the seals were opened in 1963 amen yes we can't bring a prophet on the age now in 2025 and ask God to open the seals to us that has already happened so we can't reproduce what happened 1963 but God has promises for each New Year and we want to amen live in the promises of 2025 how many of you can say amen amen praise the Lord so I'm speaking on the changing of masks and adopted Sons fulfilling the promise amen hallelujah so the changing of mask so 1963 changed our identity amen hallelujah you know that was a pet point in the in the ministry for brother Brandon and it was a pivotal point for a message to gather the living Saints Hallelujah so I want to show you how God has changed our mask you know that first God was the eternal spirit and he changed his M from Spirit to word to flesh he changed his Mass from this great spirit that amen covered the entire heavens and the Earth and then he condescended into the word which was mzed because out of this great Eternal being came forth the logos amen and that logos was MDC and that image was Priest and King so when God is saying let us make man in our own image he's making him in the image of priest and King Hallelujah so when man loses that image that's the image that must be restored to him that's why you find in Revelation 5 he says thou has made us pre PR and King because that's the mesic image we have to be restored back to what we were so God condescended from Spirit to word to flesh he was changing his mask you'll find the prophets telling us that amen hallelujah so what I want to present to you this morning is that the bride has also been changing our identity hallelujah what we once were is not where we are now in 2025 if we're going to live in the promises of what we once were we're going to miss what we are right now Hallelujah so he came from Spirit to word to flesh now the Church of Jesus Christ has to change a m to be perfectly positioned for the Fulfillment of Revelation 10821 now what if I told you that you can't approach Revelation 108-111 as the church Revelation 108-111 is a specific Ministry amen that the bride needs to change a mask and come into that position so you can't also going to break it down now you can also fulfill Revelation 108-111 as the Bride of Jesus Christ you can't fulfill Revelation 108 to11 as the wife of Jesus Christ yeah you get quiet amen we'll see it just now I'm showing you that God has changed our mask for example who's married here sister El you married can I call you miss what's your surname brother muda can I call you miss muda why your title has changed right can I call Brother Caleb a single man no because his role his title and everything has changed Hallelujah praise the Lorden he's now a father so if I don't so if the daughter wants to make claims on brother Caleb she can't call him husband she don't have claims on him as husband she has claims on him as daughter praise the Lord I pray amen as I speak this you'll be able to catch what I saying so that's why I'm saying there's a particular reason in Revelation chap 5 that John could not take the book how many of you remember the Revelation chapter 5 nobody could take the book they were looking for a near Kinsman somebody who could take the book and John could not take the book but ask ourselves why could not John take the book in Revelation 5 but he can take it in Revelation 10 something changed and it was his position it was his role it was his title he had transitioned Hallelujah amen so he can't take it in Revelation 5 but he can take it in Revelation 10 what changed amen so I'll give you a brief description in Revelation 5 the seals are not open yes yes hallelujah amen the seals are not open so he can't connect amen there's a dividing line there you remember he sees John John is sitting as one of the elders around the throne so John sees John the prophet says but there's a dividing line he can't connect with the other dimension he can't connect back with his theophany so the seals have to be broken because the seals reconnect us the seals acts as a bridge to cross over amen yes Hallelujah that is one part of the seals we know the seals the prophet says the seven seal especially it's like a rocket that goes up it just keeps unfolding and unfolding and unfolding praise the Lord but one of it is for us to reconnect with our theopen body to reconnect with our true identity so like I'm saying now the seals were not open and the opening of The Seven Seals was to reveal Christ somebody say Amen so the little book the title de of man's inheritance can only be brought back to the legal owners of the Earth yes praise the Lord amen and you know that not everyone is called to the reading of the will only those whose names are in the world Amen will be called to come to hear what is in the will Hallelujah so by the time we get to Revelation 108-111 the bride has changed mask in this unfolding drama Hallelujah amen let's just get down to our first point there let's take Esra 2 and verse 5 I'll just use Esther as a type to show you now in shusa in the palace there was a certain Jew whose name was Mori the son of Ja the son of shimi the son of Kish a benjamite who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the Captivity which had been carried away with king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away so they are trapped in a Babylonian system right we are just told now that They Carried Away in captivity so they are trapped in a Babylonian system the same type of how we were trapped in a Babylonian system in this day yes so he brought up a Desa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother so they again she's typing mes praise the Lord without father or mother and the maid was fair and beautiful when morah when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter now watch now when it came to pass when the king's commandment and decree Was Heard and when the maidens were gathered together unto shushan in the palace to the custody of AI that Esther was also brought unto the the King's house so she's no she's a she's now a called out people she's no longer regarded as part of the Captivity is everybody getting what I'm saying there are those that are trapped under the Babylonian system but Esther is a called out group amen Revelation 18 and4 I'm going to reemphasize this point here and I heard another voice from Heaven Revelation 18:4 saying come on of her my people be not partakers of her sin amen that you receive not of her plagues now if you know what a called out people is called amen you can put up the next quote a called out people as a specific title and he says as God led the church in the natural in that day he's leading the church in the spiritual in this day do you believe it they were the people of God until they were called out of Egypt and then they became the Church of God the word church means called out so like Esther was a called out bride people we have been called out from every denomination but that was our position you can't revert to us now and still refer to us as he called our people because our position has changed so he called out people brother gram is saying is Ecclesia is the church so at one stage we were called out from every denomination and we were called The Church of the Living God Amen they were called out of Egypt and we called out of the world A peculiar people to serve God now brother br will say in the signs of his coming he says don't you believe the Pentecostal Church in all of its ups and downs I believe that there is an elected called out group of people God will take the elected out of the Pentecostal group and shape it in that coming Stone he talking about The Headstone now the pyramid amen that would fit like that to bring the roof down to bring the cap Stone and this church will have to be the same Ministry and Jesus testified of the same thing now I say before we can go to fulfilling John 14:12 where Greater Works than the shall he do we must match Jesus first Works Hallelujah how many of us are expecting to do the Greater Works without doing what Jesus did our expectation is wrong if Jesus is saying Greater Works than the shall he do for I go unto my father then our capability must be able to match what Jesus did because we are ears of the father and Joint tears with the son and Joint ears doesn't mean that you are different from Jesus what is brother Bram saying here they'll have the same Ministry Jesus testified of the same thing now I'm asking you another question what have we done with the promised word for today if we have just taken the revelation of the word and I just rejoicing with the revelation of the word something is wrong yes God is not expecting us to remain in just the revelation of the word the revelation of the word has got to produce something when God said when God spoke these words let there be light God's word did not come back to him empty God spoke words but what came back light came back praise the Lord so when God is giving us the revelation of his word I'm giving you the revelation of the word God is not expecting you to give him back the revelation of the word amen he said my word will not return unto me void praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen when you speak a word you are not expecting your word to come back to you you're expecting your word to manifest into something else so when God is sending forth the revelation of the word he's expecting the manifestation to come back to himen yes Lord yes Lord hallelujah Hallelujah God is not revealing things to us for us to tell him can you imagine God telling us now because let's all admit this when he is explaining baptism in Jesus name that's a revelation of the word baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but who must manifest that yes can we just go around telling everyone the true baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no we must manifest it and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ when we are worshiping God we are know we not worshiping a trinity of gods because the mystery of God has been revealed can you say Amen so now when we're worshiping God we know it is one God revealing himself in three different offices so our worship must change and we must now fulfill God is seeking those who Worship in spirit and in truth so he's looking for a manifestation of that so can you imagine now we never knew that Malachi 4: 5 and 6 was God talking to us and speaking about William brandom we never knew there was a two-fold prophecy in that scripture the first part was John the Baptist and the second part was William Brandon we didn't know that but it was revealed to us same with revelation 10:7 we didn't know who that seventh angel was but now we know better but my point for telling you that when God is coming back to us now we can't go back to God and say Lord you sent me like to the prophet what is God looking for because if you read Malachi 4:5 and 6 is God talking to William brandham or is he talking to you what does Malachi you need to put it up brother as I'm giving these scriptures Malachi 4: 5 and 6 you know I got a lot of younger people here that may not know the scriptures so when you're putting these scriptures you read it it's saying behold I send you amen so it's a personal conversation to you and I don't know if you will ignore God when he's speaking nobody will ignore God so we ought to be paying attention when God is saying behold I sent you Elijah the prophet so what God is looking for is that last part when God is saying I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet when he's coming back he's looking for the Fulfillment you need to get to the next verse where the hearts of now the children are turned back to the fathers we can't tell God you sent me Elijah the prophet and our heart not be turned back is everybody getting my point when God is coming back he's looking for that manifestation so we can't just Rejoice around God sent a prophet God sent a prophet then the question is if he sent the prophet I have our hearts been turned back yes that's what God is looking for amen and I tied that there with Matthew 25 that the talents were given and the last part where the one that hit it in the ground did nothing with the word meaning he didn't manifest the word he kept telling God back you send a prophet but it's written in the word behold I sent you the prophet so God is not looking for us to quote back the word to him he's looking for us to manifest the word hallelujah hallelujah so all the Revelation that's the point I was trying to make when the seals are open God is revealing it to us he's not expecting back an utterance of Revelation he's expecting back a manifestation of the sons of God back on the earth praise the Lord so we're reading in Revelation 18:4 that a people is called out come out of her my people so can we say that we were a called our people according to the Scripture A called our people and like we are saying a called our people means a church means Ecclesia but the prophet is going to change the scene in 196 three because in order for us now to receive the seals our position needs to change we can't be called a called our people we can't be called the church anymore so brother brandham says here in the first seal now he's going to start preaching the seals he says and it's only to be revealed at the last day amen when the actual seal is broken broken to who not not to Christ but to the church notice oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride so you're are not just a nominal church now bride means that you've been a spoused to somebody bride means can you imagine from church you didn't have any title you didn't have any privileges but now he's telling you God has chosen you to be bride and a bride is to be married Hallelujah so the prophet changes our position at the first seal he changes our mask is somebody getting this the prophet changes our mask when he's preaching the first seal we take the church mask off and we put on the bride mask hallelujah praise the Lord now in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says this is the Lord Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit Right Moving among his people doing the same thing he did when he was here on Earth identifying with his bride hallelujah amen don't lose me this morning he who is he identifying himself with the bride and he says not the so can we say that point is toal clear God is not identifying himself with the church he's identifying himself with the bride and can I progress the thought of brother Brandon there when he's saying Jesus Christ is in the form of the Holy Spirit and now I'm going to say that if the holy spirit is tabernacling us then we are the holy spirit in the form of the Bride come on now he's condescending the holy Spirit was not s to float around the air so when we are looking at you now we are seeing the holy spirit in the form of his church in the form of his bride yes yes yes and that is not a strange thought because man's original Spirit was the Holy Spirit that's the inheritance that he lost praise the Lord let's progress this thing now he says there's a difference between the church and the bride the church goes through the tribulation so how many of you still want to be called the church he says that six seal to purify but the bride don't she goes in the Rapture before that it's time for the bride to be called out so now I believe it's calling out time praise the Lord that is still now you can see in the sixth month there Hallelujah now in the seventh seal because remember the seventh seal is going to reveal your name in the book but a bride is only Bride for one day when you're coming down the aisle they're praying Here Comes the Bride Here Comes the Bride praise the Lord but when you say your marriage vows when you leave that altar you don't go out as the bride you're going out now as the wife they say don't they say I present to you Mr and Mrs I Now Pronounce You man and wife come on now have you been to wedings brother Caleb yours was the last waiting here we need another wedding praise the Lord how many of you want to have another wedding nobody nobody wants wearing briani he's going to change it now because bride can only be for a short period of time Hallelujah who wants to have a long wedding ceremony just bright bright bright brother brand says there's been churches churches Brides brides but there must come one who's willing to take his name now remember when you leave there you also don't come in with the name that you came to the altar Hallelujah my wife is not a Nicholson ganger praise the Lord she had to leave the old name and take on a new name same the Bride of the Jesus Christ now remember when you coming to the altar to be married we come there one way and we live with his name yes amen amen so we got to know in what Authority we are praying when we are saying in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if we are picturing it as far off as a name disconnected from us he says that's why we don't see the Miracles he says that's why we don't get the results because we are not speaking in the authority of that name amen then we are speaking in somebody else's name oh if somebody can just get this we are not speaking in the name of Jesus Christ as somebody else we are the married wife of the Lord Jesus Christ so we are speaking in our position of our name so he says here now in the seventh seal very important he says we can see the bride taking on the form putting on the wedding garment making ready what was the Garment the opening of the seals now he's now presenting the Garment so she must now fulfill Revelation 19 and7 praise the Lord he says here further now in identified Masterpiece he says he has cut wants to cut the church out just like he did the Sun out like he did the bride and group to be his bride you must be a part of him not part of creed not part of the church not part of denomination be part of him amen he says you have to be Hood from the word the world cut off from you so if we have any expectation to be coming now to the union where we are the bride of Christ you can't have any bit of the world hanging so which means we need to give up alcohol we need to give up smoking we need to give up drugs we need to give up womanizing we need to give up adulteries we need to give up fornication we need to give up pornography we need to give up the movies we need to give up everything of the world or can somebody say a better amen than that because when you're coming now to be married you are giving off your rights you're basically leaving your old way of living like Rebecca left her old way of life so we can't claim this part of coming to the bride and we're still holding on to the things of the world Christ won't marry you amen he says the sculpture is counting on you you tell your neighbor Jesus is counting on you don't let him down he says willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that the word requires in the last days I poured my spirit upon the whole flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy Christ is identified Masterpiece of the word made flesh listen to what he says you are you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the Masterpiece for the bride therefore we gladly received the word and now you can put up Revelation 19:7 there it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come so he's called out a people changed the identity to say I'm going to marry you and now he's giving you the Garment to be clothing bringing you closer now keep changing your mask oh yes Hallelujah for now what is his bride his wife had made herself ready praise the Lord and to her was granted that she be RA in fine linen oh yes Lord amen clean and white amen for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints so he gave us the waiting garment and tell me what else is presented at a wedding beside the Garment a ring so when did we receive the ring amen let's see what brother Bron tells us here amen hallelujah let's skip the next qu proving his word and go to the next one amen 277 it says brother Bram is saying we were given a ring right it says and you are wearing the weding weding band of predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there God don't want anyone to flirt with you so he sent you into the world clothed with Grace so that you won't fall what is he saying the wedding band is Grace amen Amazing Grace that's why that one time you wanted to kill somebody but Grace kept you from doing it that one time you meant to sin and commit adultery Grace kept you because you were a Son of God the one time you wanted to backslide and go into the world but Grace kept you that's the wedding band of Grace Hallelujah you wanted to sell your soul to the devil but Grace kept you amen it says God did it himself he knew you from before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on the book what a Thanksgiving praise our God Amen we can go up to that quot now the one before that I want to show you now that brother Bram is showing us here and I want you to read it because you might think I'm just presenting a thought to you I want to show you the prophet said this amen 236 now Hallelujah he said says not no more as a church not no more the bride is called right in the day the son of man is being revealed amen now when brother brandham is being revealed I don't know if you know that the son of man being revealed is brother brandham yes am it's the son of man being revealed in a son of man but watch what he's coming to do now did we establish that he called us out as a people did we establish he chose us as a bride now there needs to be a marriage officer Luke 17:30 is that marriage officer let's follow so he's saying we're not noral the church in the day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head who's the head Jesus Christ we are the body unite the marriage of the Bride yes the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come into human flesh to unite the two together am amen so we had a marriage officer yes he said I don't have any desire to to establish my own church but I I have a desire to see a Union established with a relationship with you and Christ Hallelujah then he says the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in New human flesh amongst us and will make his word so real it will unite the church and him as one the bride then she'll go home to the wedding supper so is brother brandom on the scene right now no you don't know brother BR is in that sixth Dimension but a word was released a word was released to unite you to Christ Hallelujah can you say Amen to that if we miss this we miss the message that his message came to unite us with Christ as the married wife praise the Lord let's follow along now Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh amongst us and will make his word so real it'll unite the church and him as one the bride then she'll go home to the wedding supper see she's already united we are going to the wedding supper not the marriage cuz the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper so how many of us can see now that the mask has changed from bride and we now put on the mask of wife is everybody following that we are speaking on changing of masks amen hallelujah praise the Lord now here's a piece of meat I want to give you to swallow but you can't swallow this with a chicken throat amen everybody put on your Eagle throat we shouldn't have chicken throats anyway amen hallelujah when I'm saying this I want you to really understand what brother Bram is saying he says when the word year unites with the person and they two become one then what does it do then it manifests son of man again so I can walk on water is what must it do it must manifest now remember something if we don't have an expectation of it nothing will happen God won't give you what you're not expecting Simeon was waiting in the temple waiting for what to see the Lord's Christ Anna was waiting in the temple to see what to see the Lord's Christ if we are playing Marbles and not in the army of God we will see nothing we will see no Supernatural we will experience no manifestation why we are playing marbles so all you will see is marbles amen praise the Lord so to see the supernatural you've got to expect the supernatural so when he's saying that when the word unites with the person how many of you can identify and say the word is has been United with me amen come on I need to see your hands shame the devil say I need to see your hands now amen so we are saying the word is united with us then where is this part he's saying we two become one and then what does it do it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one here's a part read it with me whatever the son of man done hello who's not reading with me son of ready 1 2 3 whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing so can the church walk on water can the church heal the blind eyes can the church heal a Wither harmm can the church raise the Dead come on I need a better expectation of Faith he's saying we do the same thing and if we are not positioning ourselves or seeing ourselves with that same capability then we are not going to meet the challenge of the hour that's why I say in order to do Greater Works we must do the same thing first Hallelujah now how are we ever going to do the same things if we don't ever exercise our faith every time somebody else is sick wait there I'm going to call my pastor for you how are you flexing your muscle now how are you building muscle yes amen amen when when the doctor says something about you what is your first response doctor well what's the prescribed treatment here oh are we Sons and Daughters of God can go to God's word can we go to God's word and say Lord your word says that buy your stripes I meal put up one Peter 2:24 there amen 1 Peter 2:24 gives you the remedy gives you the antidote it gives you the med medication because the cross Paid It All Hallelujah a lot of people will die because they don't apply the word of God if you want to release yourself to science then get prepared to die thank you Lord thank you Jesus he says who his own self this is talking about our lord Jesus now bear our sins in his own body on the tree so are we sinless he bore sins on the tree making me sinless that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness amen then it says by who Stripes you were healed am so when a doctor is pronouncing something on you say doctor I don't know what you're talking about I was already healed at Calvary but that takes faith come on now that takes faith that takes confession Hallelujah I feel I got to kick some demons out hallelujah amen demon powers get ready for some kicking hallelujah praise the Lord yes Lord John Ryan had to maintain a positive confession he came to the platform and the Lord the Lord through the prophet said go on confessing you are healed praise the Lord John Ryan went every every day praise the Lord I'm Healed by the stripes of Jesus I am healed every day he kept saying it say it like a mad man if you don't believe it now say till you believe it come on tell your neighbor say till you believe it by the stripes of Jesus I am healed amen he had to maintain his confession that don't only apply with healing any other thing you're believing the Lord for Hallelujah tell him everyone about it Abraham said tell everyone I'm going to have a baby tell everyone about your new car tell everyone about your new home tell everyone about your new body tell everyone H praise the Lord so you had to keep keep maintaining his confession tell everyone you're getting promoted tell everyone praise the Lord I think I'm speaking to the rain I can hear the rain rejoicing hallelujah praise the Lord now John Ryan every day I don't know how long it took but it to take quite a long time and every day he had to keep saying praise the Lord I'm healed amen praise God I'm healed amen so one day he came to the barber ship and he's having a hair cut and this Baba wants to make fun of him and he says hey John I heard you received your healing and you can see now what happened if if if at that point the pressure got too much for John what happened if if at that point he said I can't handle this ridicule people laughing at me people saying the guy's gone off his head he was one more confession away from his healing what did the day he said I'm just is not going to confess us anymore what if that day denied what the prophet said what if that day denied or he disb believed what the prophet spoke to him on the stage what would have happened he was one more confession away from his healing and I'm challenging you maybe some of you sitting here today are one confession away from your healing one confession away from your breakthrough is somebody out here receiving it maybe you're one confession away from that miracle that you've been trusting the Lord maybe all this time you've been confessing it but you're one more confession away from it can somebody receive that word even now and say I am one more confession away from it we've seen enough of the supernatural around us to know that he is Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever amen praise the Lord oh beautiful Hallelujah so let's keep maintaining our confession let's keep speaking the word of God Amen let's progress to thought now so when son of man is revealed through our bodies it will manifest him again on the earth so don't put limitations off of God if the water is coming before you be bold live in a world of perfect Faith put your foot upon that water upon those waves upon those waging Seas upon those doctor's reports upon amen your negative report at work upon him and your child put your feet upon that water and start to walk across your problems start to face your [Applause] problems hallelujah praise the Lord so now if if brother Brandon changed our position from called out people that's the church to bride to wife why is any wife given let's put up the next quote I need to go quickly now why is a wife given brother bran will tell us why a wife is given not for you to play uh running around the tree with amen Hallelujah not for IND the movie where you going to run around the tree and sing Love Songs Hallelujah he says not this one brother the first son Adam the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to do what reproduce himself now watch while we were watching ourselves change Mas was Jesus also changing because he was once called the bridegroom somebody following like we were called The Bride but when we married us he is now the husband and we are the wife so as we are changing as he is changing we are changing praise the Lord so he says you need to go back to that I'm not done the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God now you know why Adam could not speak spiritual multiplication and go to and say Eve you shall have a son and his name Shall be Called Abel why because no seed is the fruit is somebody catching what I'm saying you can't expect the seed to be in its maturity brother Gran is calling him a spoken seed word of God which means he must come to a mature state of the word is somebody seeing that is a seed word of God but he must grow into maturity that's the likeness we've been telling you about you are to grow into the likeness of Jesus Christ and come into the mature state of the word and the mature state of the word is mesic hallelujah image means character nature of Christ likeness means to function like God so every day he was developing to function he was speaking to winds he was speaking to waves he was speaking to animal life but he was growing up to the mat state of the word but it says Eve chose to mingle a seed illegally and she couldn't wait for Adam to come to the mature state of the word hallelujah where he could speak and say you shall have a son Hallelujah so you can see brother Bram is saying Adam was a spoken word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself reproduce himself produce another Son of God now why do you think Jesus is given a bride a wife he wants to reproduce his life Hallelujah you're in the Rapture message now you know this is one of the last messages he's preaching Jesus wants fruit for himself his wife must bring forth the the kind of children that he is what kind of children brother brandham he's saying bright children we children Hallelujah the next quote I need to go quick now the church is married to Christ we are the wife of Christ bringing forth amen so as our Mas change now hello our mask is changed from a called out people our mask has changed from the bride our mask is Chang CH from the married wife to sons of God the life that we are producing is the Life of Christ and that's why John in one one John it says 1 John 3 and2 it says beloved now are we the sons of God hallelujah now are we the sons of God and it do not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for for we shall see him as he is right let's go up to that one more quote there the one I skipped now he says God is depending on you as a member of his body to Bear the fruit of the spirit so God is depending on you Sarah to bring forth the promisel God is depending on you brother and sister to bring forth the Life of Christ the image of Christ that life is what all creation is waiting for that manifestation is what Romans 8 is waiting for but we can't can't come at this point to reproduce The Life of Christ without being called out without being put as a bride without coming into the marriage ceremony seeing the son of man William brandham unite the bride and the CH and the groom we can't come to this point where he puts his word in us to see and we are now producing The Life of Christ which puts us in position of the Roman 8 man God is depending on you somebody say this God is depending on me right as a member of the body to Bear the fruit of the spirit and if he is depending on you let's open up our channels let the Holy Spirit coming tonight energize us free us from all fears and doubts revivals come Hallelujah he says in Ephesians 1 and5 that remember I'm going to reemphasize this we were not predestinated to be the Church of God that was one stage of the journey predestinate means what your end destination is going to be if you are going on the journey from here to Israel your predestination is Israel you may have a stop over in Dubai but that's just a stop over Hallelujah you're predestined to go to Israel what were we predestined for not to be the church not only to be the bride not only to be the wife let's see what the Bible is saying we were predestined to be having predestinated us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so when God finally sees us our end results he's seeing us as manifested sons of God upon the face of the Earth he seeing Adam back on the earth Hallelujah one more quote here in modern events make clear by prophecy he says then if you're a son and daughter of God you in God all the time in knew what bed in time you would be planted so now you're made a creature a Son of God manifested son daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message is coming forth in this time hallelujah praise the Lord oh can somebody say this now so who is the one that's going to be standing there in Revelation 10: 8-11 is it going to be the called our church is it going to be the Bride of Jesus Christ is it going to be the married wife of the Lord Jesus Christ or is it going to be an adopted son of God because Adam lost the book in Genesis 3 and revelation 10 Adam must be back on the earth to receive the book so we're on a journey started in the mind of God am so he predestinated us to be the Romans 8 man waiting on the earth to take the book now that's why it hasn't worked people have been trying to take the book as bride won't work why you're not adopted as bride you don't have his name yeah yet as married wife you have his name amen can somebody say Amen as married wife you have his name but as married wife you don't have his life oh come on the holy spirit is trying to take this thing deeper now so you understand because if we take the book in any other title we can't manifest the promise for this day so we take it as the Romans 8 man as the manifested that's why now we know what he wants done with the word hallelujah we are back in our image and likeness again now I encourage you this morning if you're stuck in any of those phases you need to ask the Lord amen to bring me up to date in 2025 where I am positionally right now in 202 because to take the book any other way you won't be able to bring forth what that word is hallelujah because let's bring scripture who wants to see scripture who wants to see scripture hallelujah amen anybody wants to see scripture this is coming to me fresh now so I'm going to try and find it praise the Lord tell your neighbor it's about to get good put 1 Timothy 2:2 what does it mean to prophesy the prophet said to prophesy means to preach now can a woman preach I know I'm bring off can a woman preach according to the Bible hello can a woman preach according to the Bible what does I suffer not a woman to teach or Ser authority over the man but to be in silence so who must prophesy again to Nations tongues and Kings the wife or sons of God hey we must stay with scripture who must prophesy to Nations times and Kings to prophesy the prophets says in the modern day preacher is to prophesy to preach are you getting it amen yes am yes we can't apply this word out of position we've got to recognize ourselves as now the adopted sons of God as adopted Sons with title deed back in our hand we now have authority over the earth I said as adopted Sons yes we titled the back in our hands am we now have authority over the Earth amen hallelujah so I'm telling you no demon in hell can come against you oh Hallelujah put up Luke 10 10:19 there I have given you Authority I have given you Authority the authori is in the name Hallelujah the the brother Bram said an adopted son his name on the check is as good as the father's come on I have given you Authority power to trample on serpents and scorpions and over all the powers of the enemy and nothing by any means shall hurt you oh church I need you to operate in the revelation of 2025 not to operate in in the uh revelation of days gone by we were brought up until this point amen we at the brink of the closing gentille dispensation how many of you want to look amen go forward looking in the review mirror so I'm telling you God is trying to establish us as the sons of God Amen that's why I'm speaking on the changing of masks adopted Sons fulfilling the promise amen we can't be fulfilling the promise if we don't know our true identity and the Holy Spirit is crying out this morning for us to know our true identity so that we can start to operate the word in its time and season oh somebody give God praise but that's all I got to say this morning let's stand up and give God praise you thank you Jesus so we got to watch how we what we call ourselves we've got to watch when we approaching scripture when we go before the sick when we go before the blind when we go before the cancer case when we go before the heart case are we positioned the sons of God to speak hallelujah how do we see ourselves amen amen how do I see myself you remember when when when John took the book what he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness when Jesus Took the book The Spirit of the Lord is upon me he identifi himself in the scripture when we are taking the book we are saying I am Revelation 108 to1 but what is my position in that how am I able to take the book in Revelation 5 she's the bride brother brandham says in the breach message there he comes forth looking for his bride but in Revelation 10 she's the adopted son oh I think we can Rejoice amen amen let's J amen praise the Lord praise the Lord he didn't let the devil win he didn't let the devil win he didn't let the devil [Music] win oh he didn't let the devil he didn't let the devil he didn't let theil Satan lost the battle oh Satan lost the battle Satan lost the battle Satan lost the battle Satan lost the battle oh Satan lost the battle Satan lost the battle Satan lost the battle ble oh Satan lost the battle oh he didn't let the devil he the he [Music] the
