some water you can drink some water amen hallelujah let's just focus our hearts and our minds on the word of God Amen praise the Lord amen we've been dealing with the glory of God and we know that God at this time wants us to come to a place where he can share his glory with us amen and how is he sharing it is through us he himself is taking a hold of ourselves our beings and is revealing his glory through US amen hallelujah that's a time and the season we are in now amen amen at the climax of all things that's where we are his glory will be fully revealed through his bride fully expressed through his bride amen this brid will God a Victorious church amen a glorious church amen even as his word declares amen praise the Lord amen so amen this morning we'll speak on glorify me with the glory that Jesus has given me oh yes amen glorify me with the glory that Jesus has given me now as I read the scriptures I want you to be conscious of the fact that we are standing before the angel of God Amen we are standing in the presence of God the angel of God the great Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit is moved by faith amen and he wants to connect with your faith oh yes so ask yourself now what is my expectation amen and have I created the right atmosphere now for the word of God which is a seed to be swn in my heart amen so St John 17 the Bible reads from verse one these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee amen and as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is eternal life that they may Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world wars amen praise the Lord you may be seated the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word amen praise the Lord just before we get started into our message amen we know the prophet teaches us that Natural Things type spiritual especially when it comes to Israel amen especially when it comes to Israel the natural is typing the spiritual so we look this week and we see of all the countries in the world of all the Muslim nations that could have taken Israel to court to the icj why did South Africa take them there are so many Muslim countries surrounding Palestine why didn't any of them take Israel to to court amen so why South Africa is my [Music] question we see that South Africa has a part to play in end time prophecies so in moving the prophecy forward and moving the prophecies concerning Israel and the end times forward amen we ask ourselves a question does South Africa have a part to play in the prophecy concerning spiritual isra [Music] amen what is it about South Africa that the angel of God wanted brother brandham to come here especially to Durban amen amen last year we see there was attack on Israel on the 10th month of the seventh day they entered the New Year 5784 hundreds were taken hostage now Israel is engaged in Warfare with amas but amas is using the Palestinians as human Shields and they have hostages yes amen we know the Bible says in Matthew 11:12 that the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the violent take it by force so I'm asking you we have entered the new year and we are engaged in spiritual warfare amen will South Africa arise in the spirit and be counted in the fight in the greatest battle ever fought will South Africa arise yes Amen in the spiritual warfare Amen in the greatest battle ever fought yes who will lead the attack I ask you Hallelujah who will God use could it be South Africa amen question to be asked amen you know what if we are not concerned about the things of God the Prophecies of God then I tell you it's okay to get a good job and to get a good house and to make your your life as comfortable as possible while you here on the earth do that do it with all diligence do it with all your might because that's all you're building for enjoy it while you can help us Lord but when your last breath is taken away and when you close your eyes in Sweet Death that'll be the end all your wealth will go to somebody else amen so what are we really looking for what are we really striving for amen surely it can't just be to live 70 80 years and that's the End Amen but the word of God has been open to us so I'm asking you Believers of God and when I'm asking you I don't want you to forget that it's your duty to say Amen to the word of God Amen it's your duty to connect with the word of God amen amen my opening statements if you remember it I said the angel of God is here waiting to connect with faith how will he know you Faith by your response to the word amen amen so I'm asking you we are enter the new year we are engag in spiritual warfare in the greatest battle ever for who will stand up and be counted amen and who will lead the attack yes amen amen hallelujah so we see here that Jesus is saying glorify me with the glory I had with you before the world began amen we know Jesus prayed this prayer now Jesus Christ as a man on Earth his life was fixing to end and he knew the next step was to go to the Cross yes and we know that Jesus was the manifestation of the glory of God in human form amen somebody say amen amen amen so he comes to a junction point in his life he comes and he prays this prayer father glorify me with the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world yes amen amen amen he had a successful life of ministry he healed the sick raised the dead he spoke to winds and waves he spoke to trees amen he spoke to all creation and they obeyed him but was looking for something more yes amen amen Jesus didn't say father I finished the word and that's it now take me home he's striving for something more amen he is looking for glory amen but he realizes there's no glory on the earth so he's asking the one that created all things and Jesus didn't bypass his theophany so he had knowledge of the form he was before the foundation of the world and he's saying father you have glorified me on the earth now you have expressed your glory through me but I have one request amen amen glorify me with what with thine own self put that scripture amen he says there with thine own self there's no greater glory we can attain than the glory of the king Almighty that's be our ultimate goal our ultimate desire amen praise the Lord amen Romans 8:17 we see it says now if we are children then we are a HS of God coair with Christ if indeed we share any sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory right so there's no glory without suffering there's no glory without trials amen if you look in the natural anybody hoping to achieve glory in a certain field a certain area in their life they become the master of that field and and glory is the end result if they're an athlete glory is the end result there's much suffering through a training there's many lonely hours spent While others are enjoying life they make sacrifices amen they suffer for the cause why they are after glory amen oh yes Lord now if they can be so diligent in the natural What About Us in the spirit amen amen are we really looking for glory amen amen amen praise the Lord amen now 2 Corinthians 3:18 reads this but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory amen even as by the spirit of the Lord the spirit of the Lord is the Holy Ghost I want to slow that down and read it again we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory so we are looking at the glory of God that's what this verse is telling us we are beholding the glory of God right we are looking at the glory of God he says as we are looking it at it we are being changed into the same image amen we are being changed into what we are looking at Oh Yes Lord From glory to glory amen so I ask you what are you looking at hallelujah what is before you amen amen what are what are you focusing on yes Lord amen what are you reading yes Lord what are you placing before you as an image you are being changed into that you know recently I was reading I think it was last week or somewhere just to show you in Ty the spirit of somebody can possess people that even after they are gone they can still have an influence on the Earth year after year they have this contest called impersonations of Elvis Presley you must have seen them why year after year how long ago did he die why is it Spirit still influencing people that that man people that didn't even meet him that were not influenced by his music people still impersonate him what is that it is a spirit yes amen a spirit that has possessed people yeah amen so we are looking at the image that people are be placing before them and they are being changed into that image I'm reminded now about a scripture that says that this Antichrist spirit is sitting in the temple of God making himself God presenting himself as God and as people are beholding His Image they are being changed into His Image that's right amen that's why the the the daughters are no better than the mother yes yes they are beholding the image and that image is being passed down from mother to daughter amen but we thank God that our image is being passed down from father to son fathers to daughters amen and we are coming into His Image whether we like it or not we are coming to his image because that is prophecy whether you are prepared for it or not we are coming into his image L amen God is moving the wheels forward now the wheels of Prophecy are moving forward amen I want to read amen praise the Lord I want to read in Exodus 33 and: 18 he talking about the glory of God here and I want you to conscious what Moses is saying and what our lord Jesus is saying so in Exodus 33 and: 18 it says and now Moses is telling the Lord and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory amen wow amen this man had seen the glory of [Music] God he spoke and flies came up to existence he spoke and frogs came into existence he threw down the rod and he turned into a serpent he saw the mighty Nile turn to blood yes he saw Locust and Nets and flies come across plag have to play strike Egypt you saw how God had delivered them with a mighty hand this man saw the glory [Music] Cloud this man saw the pillar of fire in a bush but he was not satisfied amen yeah are you satisfied with the manifestations you have seen or can you come to a place show me your your glory amen thank you Lord but I want to show you how Jesus switched it up a little higher Moses says Show Me Your Glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee Now watch how God is going to reveal his glory I will make my goodness pass before thee so part of the glory is the goodness of God hallelujah amen and he says I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee part of the glory is when his name is proclaimed am and in knowah the age has the name been restored back back to the church amen but through Malachi 4:5 and 6 through Revelation 10:7 the name of the Lord has been restored back to the church so is that his glory yes now watch also grace and mercy and I will be gracious to to whom I will be gracious and show Mercy on whom I will show Mercy but is that what really Moses is asking for what are those attributes of his glory so now here God tells him thou can not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put the in the Cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see the back see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen so we know that Moses saw the back parts of God but I want you to notice again what Moses is asking for Show Me Your Glory and what Jesus is asking for you can desire to see the glory of God or you can come come to a place and say glorify me with your own self amen yes then what am I really telling you you become the glory of God yes amen God expresses his glory through you yes amen amen we haven't come up so far in algebra and the statue of the perfect man to be preaching baby [Music] stuff this is the image that God wants to manifest on the earth amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now the glory of God we find here in Genesis just to background it a little [Music] bit we see the glory of God is coming on the [Music] earth the earth is dark it's void now what's your situation in your life if your situation in your life is dark and void and formless no purpose then your life is gloomy and dark like genesis 1:2 so the glory of God is descending Upon A Dark Void formless [Music] Earth but when the glory of God descends it has transforming power amen amen the Bible says the spirit of God moved upon the waters am but the glory of God is going to be manifest upon the Earth and it has transforming power it has transforming power to Resto it back to the original condition amen nothing can come into the glory of God and be the same again amen if you walk into church week after week and you go out the same way then you have not experienced a glory of God the glory of God is transforming power the glory of God will change your life the reason being people don't want the glory of God to affect their lives and influence their lives therefore you can walk into service and go out of service the same way you're doing it out of ritual you're doing it out of religious ceremony but when you once allow the Shak of Glory of God to say Lord come and fill me with your glory Lord you can never be the same again you can never think the same again your very life is governed by the glory and the presence of God amen amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord so either it dies in his presence or it lives and that's why the prophet says it's a dangerous thing to come into the presence of God because e it's the house of judgment or it's a House of Mercy amen so people can be getting eternal life being saved or people can be sealing their faith by rejecting the gospel yes two things can happen there so you see in the glory of God can be either life or death amen praise the Lord hallelujah so if amen if there is no original life there tied back to predestination from before the foundation of the world and he dies yeah if you have no original SE Gene of God within you that's tied in the back part of God's mind amen then you will die but if you have representation if you are Original Seed amen if you have original life in you amen then you will live in his presence amen you will live in his glory so we find that if you read that chapter there you'll see the Earth and everything in it he being transformed by the glory of God as God says Let There Be The Glory of God is transforming the glory of God is creating yes the glory of God Amen is moving in Fish Life animal life bird life thank you Lord it took 6,000 years or 6 days whichever you want to look at it for God for the earth to be filled with the glory of God and when God is finished with it on the sixth day here stands a man clothed in the glory of God a man in the image and likeness of God when God is finished with anything his glory is manifest and the highest form of creation he standing in the glory of God Amen he represents the glory of God on the [Music] earth I'm showing you where we fell from I'm showing you how God ended Creation With His glory being revealed in a man if that's how the alpha started that's how the Omega will start and I tell you the Omega what didn't finish in William brandham even though the glory of God was manifested through William brandham he was the first wave shei that was waved before the people testifying that many more Sons and Daughters of God are coming for to Life come on give God praise somebody say [Applause] glory amen he showed us that it can be done the glory of God can be manifest through a man through a man born of sex amen through a man amen hallelujah even with no education God is not looking for those kind of things but God is looking for your to will surrender hallelujah amen so when God is finished with anything it shines in his glory of God man is standing on the earth as a god of the earth so Moses here he's saying show me the glory amen now Moses had seen we said many manifestations Moses saw the cloud Moses saw the pillar of fire Moses saw the angel of God sir what was 23 all about the angel of God but is that where we stop you see how he's pushing us into the glory realm come on people of God understand what I'm telling you connect with it God does not want to us to stop that's right the journey we can't be stagnant we got to move we got to climb we got to climb amen God is taking us all the way yes amen he's going to what to do and I tell you it's a short quick work we have a few years left that God must get us ready God must get the church ready a holy ghost filled Church filled with the glory anointing of God amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen so he's telling the Lord amen he wanted something more than just seeing the angel of God he wanted something more than just seeing the manifestations of God he wanted something more than all the signs and the Wonders he said Lord I only asked you Show Me Your Glory if you and I don't come to Glory something's missing we are Glory deficient you know we can be nutrient deficient but in the kingdom of God we don't want to be glory [Music] deficient we got to come to a place where we say Lord I can't function without your glory yes without your anointing amen let's all say father father glorify me glorify me with thine own self th own self [Music] amen Jesus had come and he needed to break the seed deal imagine he had reached the Pinnacle of his life fulfilled all he says Lord I have done all the work that you have called me for but now break the Easter seal amen break the Easter seal break that seventh seal of my life the hidden Mystery and glorify me with thine own self now I want you to no this to Jesus prayer there he had not gone to the Cross yet yeah if we put that scripture again but watch what he saying here in verse 4 that's uh St John 17:4 he says I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work amen amen but had he but notice the language the language will tell you who he is is hallelujah amen praise the Lord I have made the a father of many nations amen the glory that thou has given me I have given them Jesus is saying even though he wasn't whipped one bit even though no nails were pissed through his hands and his feet yes I have finished the work amen am speak as though it's already done Jesus himself already he knew amen that he was going all the way to the Cross amen hallelujah speaking the positive church is what I'm trying to tell you you're going through things in your life speak in the positive as though you have already overcome your situation say I thank you Lord that I have already overcome the situation I have already overcome this trial and I have finished the work and I have given glory to your name oh yes Lord I have an unbelieving wife I thank you God that you have saved her you have restored her and brought her back into the house of God I thank you Lord for my unbelieving children I thank you Lord that you have already done a work in them and I already see them sitting in the house of God raising their hand to worship you I already see my husband Lord dedicated his life to you I already see my husband as the head of the home I see Lord as Lord you said in Ephesians Lord how a man ought to love his wife I see in that condition already and I give you praise to it can somebody connect with that Faith yes Lord GL thank Jesus is showing us how to talk amen praise the lord we can't say we are ears of the father joint ears with the son but then we speak kindly we must learn the language amen amen hallelujah we must talk like Daddy talks walk like Daddy walks amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen how many if you want me to preach under the anointing because under the anointing it can be 10 minutes but if I stick to my notes it could be longer right Hallelujah it could be longer but you know when the anointing strikes and the message is received and the people's Faith have come to a level then we can close the service then there's nothing more to be said but allow the work of the Holy Spirit to come now amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so we are praying that Lord glorify us with thyself not looking for manifestations only not looking for signs only but we want you yourself oh God glorify me with thyself amen oh yes Lord now with all the Mysteries that we have known all the Mysteries that have been revealed to us with all the things we have preached through the years we have come to this season in our time we have come to this Junction of time amen where all that is left is for God to reveal his glory through his [Music] body yes can any one of us deny that it was Glory was fully expressed through William brandom as Luke 17 a son of man revealing the son of man can any of us deny it none of us can deny it we saw the signs we saw the evidence yes how many of us can with the shity say that we have seen the glory of God manifest through I'm talking about the entire body we haven't seen it but it said we have come to the climax now we are coming now yes with all the Mysteries we have known all the things being preached now is the time now is the season and all that left is for God to reveal his glory display his glory through his bride until his glory comes we are incomplete yes we may know all the Mysteries come on now I want to type it again so you don't get lost Jesus performed signs wonders Miracles there was no one could touch his life did he was he satisfied show me thy Glory anoint me with your glory Lord what am I saying if we until we come into His glory we are incomplete so I pray should be the same glorify your people oh godu glorify us Lord Jesus the children of Israel had one thing in common what was that they had the glory of God this was a covenant people they had a I will Covenant from Jehovah God himself but the sign of the glory of the glory Covenant was what circumcision that's why even David could say who is this uncircumcised Philistine that will defile the armies of the Living God Abraham was given sign of circumcision it was their Covenant with God Amen that was their Glory if I could say it that way they had to be circumcised amen now circumcision is a sign it's a type of the Holy Ghost but there's a Covenant people that God has and it's not the whole of the Christian world that has the sign of circumcision some think they have it because when the Holy Ghost fell amen they ran with one part of it they ran with one manifestation of it and they didn't wait yes they didn't carry long enough amen trying to explain to you that when something starts in its infancy it grows to to its full Glory Hallelujah but when something starts at the root on its infancy and there comes the speaking in tongues and the manifestations that is not the full Glory yes you got to wait for it to grow amen amen praise the Lord so some went went out oza street amen some went out with Luther's message that was a holy ghost Falling come on that was the Holy Ghost falling revealing justification the Holy Ghost fell again in Wesley's day revealing amen sanctification yes then it was the outpouring of the gifts but they didn't [Music] wait they ran for the gifts but there's a group of people amen who under the messenger I've Waited For The Giver of the gifts Hallelujah yes Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord so let me ask you what determines the quality of your existence what determines the quality of Our Lives if it's not the glory of God the anointing of God maybe you ask yourself now what what Glory do I carry what glory of God do I carry in my life Lord reveal to me what Glory what level of Glory what level of anointing do I carry in my life if your life has no glory then your existence is no different from an animal what made Adam different from animal world the glory of [Music] God by staying behind the word come on now when he left the word what happened did he lose his glory yes amen I ask you again what determines the quality of your existence what determines the quality of your life it's the glory of God Amen if your life has no glory we are no better than an animal and this I'm taking from the prophet of God for those of you who think I'm calling you an animal amen but I know there's nobody here without the glory of God Amen you'll find that in the quote there question and answers on Genesis you take the Holy Spirit off a man is lower than the animal you see I was nice and I said you're an animal the prophet is saying you're lower than an animal this is in question and answers you take the Holy Spirit off of a man he is lower than the animal he's worse than the animal so what determines the quality the Holy Ghost Glory therefore you find people doing what they do no Holy Ghost you find a man who's addicted to things living in the world lasting after things he's got no glory you can't tell tell me the Holy Ghost is living in that body no that man needs to die to self that's another thing we want to touch on here now what was Jesus saying I have reached one level of Glory because you have expressed your glory through me but in order for me to reach the glory of anointing you with your your own self I got to go to the cross the next level of Glory awaits beneath de to self on the other side of De to self is the glory of God Amen how many want to die to self amen welcome to my funeral I'm dying to myself that's why Paul says I Die daily what was he after the glory but in order to experience the glory on the other side of death to self is the glory of God how many of us are willing to lay down and say Lord For Your Glory I am willing to die to self amen here in another quote in from the beginning it wasn't so paragraph 17 it says man perverts things that's what man does a man in his Fallen state is worse than animal do you believe that it proves it man will do things that an animal won't do there is man now man is not muscles you say oh he's a man I've seen men that weigh 200 lb didn't have an ounce of man about them man is not measured by his muscles that's a beast man is measured by character a man is a man by character that's the reason Jesus was the greatest man that ever lived there was nothing that could ever measure to his character or compare with him he was a real man hallelujah amen you think you real man be like Jesus Jesus is the real man amen the Bible says husbands love your wives even as Jesus the real man love the church so what makes our existence valuable the glory that we carry the glory that we carry true wealth is not measured by what a man possesses true wealth is is amen measured by what we possess by the share of Glory that we carry so therefore amen hallelujah this message came to bring us to glorification amen the message of the hour is to bring us to our final Glory people may be thinking hey what's happening no move I telling you the message of the hour is going to take you to your final Glory stay with the message of the hour it's the message of Truth in this day this m message amen can make us end partakers of his glory amen because if we don't come to Glory I'm saying it again we are nothing we can do so many things in life we can preach we can dance we can sing but if there's no glory attached to it there's no blessing to it many people sing but there's no glory to it no anointing to it many people preach but there's no anointing to it amen so what gives value to preaching is the glory of God that accompanies the preaching amen what value to singing the glory of God that accompanies the singing what gives glory to music the glory of God that accompanies the music so if the glory of God doesn't accompany any of those things we are doing it according to religious form because the glory of God didn't descend upon Cain's sacrifice but what accompanied the glory was the able sacrifice amen praise the Lord amen so the glory of God in our lives must be our Pursuit the glory of God in our life must be the reason for our existence amen don't say now make your promise to a girl oh I only live for you for your precious love I will climb the highest mountain For Your Precious Love I will swim the deepest sea amen For Your Precious Love I will swim across the deepest the widest [Music] river Hallelujah but he don't mean it amen praise the Lord after they get married they can't even climb the stairs for you they want to climb mountains after they get married they can't even cross the street for you how they going to cross an ocean amen praise the Lord Glory will be the end result of this bride amen nobody reaches Glory at the beginning I'm saying it again glory is the end result to anything we said whether you're an athlete studying doing an assignment you look at Noah Abraham Moses the glory didn't come when Noah first started building the ark the glory came at the latter end hallah Glory didn't come amen hallelujah when Abraham left his father's house the glory came at the end when his body was changed and he they gave birth to a son Glory comes at the end and we are living at the End Amen Hallelujah amen hallelujah turn to your neighbor and say you a Believer say how about you say amen amen that's what believers do come on now amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord I promise you I'll end very shortly amen but you got to pull on the gift otherwise I told you if I don't e the Highlight then you'll wait for the day of redemption now amen praise the Lord so glory is the final result after the pain after the suffering even Jesus we see after 3 and 1 half years Ministry he suffered he endured but the cross would bring him to his final glory to be clothed with the glory he had to with the father at the beginning now Jesus was in a flesh body and Jesus body had limitations some of you say no yes Jesus body was aging they thought he was 50 years old his body was aging and to prove it it when they hurt him he bled when they whipped him he bled so his body had limitations amen the body was subject to death but Jesus was longing for glorification amen and the Bible says that we are groaning within ourselves in fact all creation is groaning for what our glorification amen amen the souls under the altar are crying how long how long what they are crying for glorification the Saints in the sixth Dimension they are there in a temporal body but they are crying for glorification you say h you making that up I'm not making it up it's you who don't understand things didn't brother brandom tell them where is Jesus I want to see Jesus he wasn't happy being in a theop body Jesus was in a glorified body so when he's saying I want to see Jesus he is saying I'm clothed now with a theophonic body but I want to be glorified so that I can also see Jesus you see that's why our preaching must also be powerful to make people understand that heaven's not the Final Destination man's inheritance is the earth when God is done renovating the Earth and God is done with corruption man is coming back for his rightful position otherwise it's not Redemption Redemption is to restore it back to his former glory we are coming back to the earth oh yes Lord amen we know that it's preachers when you die you go to heaven and you be with the Lord forever more no we are coming back to the Earth yes that's right we are coming back in our full Glory we are coming as gods of the earth amen thank amen praise the Lord amen oh we bless your name amen am amen even even the the other people they believe something maybe more in line that they coming back to the Earth then some denominational people they think Heaven's their final destination but the other people they believe they're coming as a cockroach on the earth or something else it is the believe they're coming back on the earth hey amen praise the Lord so we are crying for glorification the Saints in the sixth Dimension are crying for glorification the Saints in the under the altar crying for glorification Jesus crying for glorification glorification is what you say what is glorification glorification is a new body Hallelujah you see man if you can I've got a picture there you can put it up it's a statue of a perfect man amen praise the Lord you see glorification is a body that can change dimensions I'm going to say something don't miss it glor glorified body is a body that can change Dimensions right now we are limited in this body to only contact three dimensions light time and matter but a glorified body can move through all Dimensions amen Jesus was in a threedimensional body when he died he went Souls under the altar

change travel time travel praise the Lord amen praise the Lord I pray you amen well understand what I'm saying there so here's the pyramid where's the glory glory is at top of the pyramid yes people are so excited I have faith I have faith faith is the start but your faith needs to be glorified virtue the Bible says add to your faith right second Peter chapter 1 you'll find this add to your faith glory is at the top what is this pyramid the pyramid represents the image of Christ that we are beholding the pyramid represents the image of Christ that we must become and what is the glory of God on the top what is the Capstone love and God is love and you can't go Beyond the Glory your value your worth the quality of your life is not measured by what what you have amen like I said amen not PR of wealth or social status amen all of that means nothing to God God gives you value by the anointing Glory that you carry in the season what level of Glory are you carrying oh yes because though I

can't go beneath the above the glory this is the anointing that you carry in the season God gave you a promise that when grow Darkness covers the earth amen what he said arise and shine for thy light has come what is that light it's just the kind of Glory of God how did it come by the opening of the word that is why the message of the hour stands above and beyond any other church because we have the revelation of the Seven Seals the glory of God Amen we carry the glory of God in the message of the hour we carry the opening of The Seven Seals amen the opening of that seven seal we carry amen the revelation of Revelation 107 we carry the revelation of the seven Thunders to give us rapturing Faith oh come on now you can't go beyond the glory amen this message is the glory you say I'm

position come into the image check your faith check your virtue check your knowledge test your check your patience check your godliness check your brotherly kindness before you come to the glory before the Capstone comes down and brother Bram says this in the per statue of a perfect man the same way he has built the church through seven Church ages He is building the individual so individually you must be built up with all of these virtues and collectively as a body we are coming to the Pinnacle [Music] now where are we what is this up here is that down here then I'm telling you we're all the way up at the glory of [Music] God we're all the way up with the glory of God Amen God's not coming to cap [Music] Faith oh yes amen amen I know some of you are really working out on your [Music] faith God's not coming to cap that yes he's is looking because the pyramid he says must be owned so perfectly that when the Capstone comes it must fit perfectly he says not even a razor blade was able to go through the natural pyramid amen praise the Lord let's finish now amen hallelujah people want to be glorified with other people they want to be like that person be like that person but we want to say Lord glorify me with thine own self amen by God's grace amen we have added and added re I'm closing now these are my closing remarks through the years we've added Revelation upon Revelation we've preached it by Revelation there was a season we preached Revelation 108 to1 by Revelation am we don't need to amen we didn't need to preach Revelation 10:7 by Revelation because it was already finished am you understand what I'm saying it was already manifest on the earth there was no denying that William Brandon was Revelation 10:7 there was no denying that William Brandon was m 4:5 so we didn't need to preach it in Revelation form but the bride needed to come to her position so we were preaching that in Revelation form that after the ministry of Revelation 10:7 comes the ministry of Revelation 108 to1 so for years we labor to tell the church you are John you are to take the book you are to eat the [Music] book but you know both Revelation and manifestation is a thing that can't be manufactured because who is it that give revelation God who is it that brings the manifestation God so there's two things you can't bring before its time that's Revelation and manifestation am thank you Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we've added Revelation upon Revelation amen hallelujah and we were what were we doing all the time while we were preaching it in Revelation 4 we were saying Amen to the word of God and who are standing back and watching all of this the angel of God what saying these people it's not yet time for the manifestation but here I'm presenting the Revelation and they are amening the word of God while we are being built while we were being built into the statue of a perfect man amen hallelujah things start to change around us things didn't change overnight you went through a journey amen you went through a suffering you went through a dying to self you went through a deep journey in your life and you come now to this point and Junction in your life amen amen where things will not just happen overnight if anything happens you've got to work for it you've got to suffer for it because if we share his glory we must suffer with him amen but all this time there was an angel watching us respond to the word how we were building Upon Our Most Holy Faith Revelation upon Revelation upon Revelation upon revelation we Rejoice with the revelation of the word but now has come the time for the manifestation amen we must stand up and be counted we have been called for such a time as this amen praise the Lord so in order for you to perform Mark 16 you can't perform Mark 16 if the glory is not within you the glory must be within you first in order for the glory to flow out of you the anointing has to be within you first in order for the anointing to flow out of you yes no spring can give water if there's no water within it so the angel is leading us amen hallelujah the angel has been leading us all this time Jesus defined it as glorify me with thine own self he does did not say glorify me with your goodness that is of a different kind of Glory you see Jesus didn't say glorify me with your goodness he says glorify me with thine own self that's a different kind of Glory his goodness is a different kind of glory amen Pentecost settled for the gifts we've settled for The Giver of the gifts thank you they missed the person Jesus said I have finished the work that you have given me I've healed the sick I've raised the dead I've raised a man who was dead 4 days what can be more glorious than that Jesus tells you what's more glorious glorify me with thyself the angel is leading us as we are climaxing to the point of we shall be changed if we miss these steps to glorification you Miss the message if you miss the message you miss the Rapture Sons and Daughters of God are coming to maturity ready to answer Creations grown you have to have his glory first before others can experience the effects of the glory yes amen what is the essence of his glory the essence is his character his nature you can't hide that you can't tell me you're carrying the nature the the glory of God and then his nature is different amen so those are the telltale signs amen God's agenda now is not to give you some gift to make you puffed up God's agenda now is to glorify himself through you because you're a trained son you're a mature son you know how to handle the glory you know how to handle the anointing you won't take glory for yourself yes but you say Lord I give thee Glory hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so it is you will determine What flows through you what amount of Glory you'll allow the Lord to flow through you amen amen amen hallelujah God also wants to change you into the person that when you stand healing can flow through your virtues am sanctification can flow through you justification can flow through you amen amen and you don't have to struggle to live right because you have been changed into the image of Jesus Christ rededicate Our Lives to God Amen the Rapture is at hand yes that's just not another preacher saying that the time of the Rapture is at hand yes amen it's
