trials will get harder amen so should our prayer life also increase amen so should I walk with the Lord increase that's the only way we're going to overcome this world amen hallelujah amen this morning we'd like to speak on Amen on the wings of a mighty Angel upon two and this time we'll focus on the emancipator last week we spoke on the proclamation but he came with a proclamation which is the message of the hour and the message came to tell us that we should go free amen we should go free amen you know in the natural the citizens of the US have celebrated Thanksgiving amen they were celebrating their freedom amen when they were liberated and you know Abraham Lincoln is regarded as one of the Great emancipators of the Black Nation in the USA amen so if they can celebrate natural men a natural accomplishment look at how they celebrate Martin Luther King Jr and how they celebrate Nelson Mandela and all of these people that set man free from a natural bondage and a slavery are we focusing our attention on the greatest of all scriptures when the emancipator came down on the earth amen so we'll read from Revelation 10 there amen just to get context and then we'll go to Psalm 91. blessed be the name of the Lord and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had after their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so notice the time the seventh ambros are seven Thunders are uttering their voices when the lion roars amen everyone reading the same Bible it says amen he cried with a loud voice and when he had cried so if you are if you are claiming to have heard the mighty angel the mighty Angel Raw when he descended then there should have been seven Thunders after their voices amen hallelujah amen some of you are scared to say Amen this morning amen because the devil has put scarecrows around the scripture don't be afraid of the scriptures for us amen it says when the seven pandas had added their voices amen I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven dandas added and write them not amen so let's turn to Psalm 91 will see the same God and what David is saying about him in psalm 91. shall abide under the shadow of the almighty amen amen amen his shadow is so powerful that we can find Refuge just in his shadow alone amen if there was a fight breaking out and there's a great sunlight and it's in the midst of the day and I tell you just standing by my shadow Hallelujah will you find any comfort in that but here he is telling you he will dwell it in a secret place of the most high oh Hallelujah who's dwelling in the secret place in this hour think of Psalms 27 he hired me in his Pavilion psalms 27 amen the Rapture message amen hallelujah so he was dwelling under that seventh seal of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust amen surely he shall deliver thee now watch that's what is coming down in Revelation tear to bring Deliverance surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of that to Beast the snail the foul Fowler and from the noise some pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers amen protection with feathers amen and under his wings shalt thou trust his trust shall be thy shield and thy Butler Brother Branham says amen have you ever seen amen this great Eagle wings you can find Refuge under the shadow of these Eagle wings amen but I want you to know this Eagle he's also a mighty angel amen and we can find Refuge under the wings of this Great Mighty Angel amen this is not an angel without wings because when the prophet of God saw him he describes the angel and he says these great Wings Swift amen sit back Hallelujah he said he was flying amen amen this is an angel with wings in Revelation 10. amen he says Thou Art my shield my butler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted at Noonday A thousand shall fall at thy side and a thousand at their right hand but it shall not come nigh be can you say amen amen only with an eye shall not behold and see the reward of the wicked because that was made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy imitation amen hallelujah amen there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall barely up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and add up the Young Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample undefeat because he set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he had known my name amen he shall call upon me and I will answer him that's when he came to call the names that were found in the book and I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him and with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation amen may the Lord that blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen hallelujah amen so last week we looked at on the wings of him of the mighty Angel and we started to show you that he came down with the proclamation and we started to outline the scene and the setting of how it was a militant setting he's descending in a time of War it's uneasy upon the Earth everyone is trying to flex their muscle all powers are rising up two million demons 200 million demons have been let loose upon the Earth amen it's after the second World War Hallelujah so notice there it's between the sixth trumpet and the Seven trumpet that Revelation 10 he said the six angel trumpet that sounded and then comes revelation 10. amen the same mystery lies between the sixth and the seventh seal between the sixth and the seventh seal comes the seventh chapter of Revelation dealing with the Jews now between the sixth and the seventh trumpet comes Revelation 10 dealing amen when the Redemption claims being brought back to The Descendants on the earth and then Revelation 11 is going back to the Jews amen so we started to show you how that this lion was this Angel was roaring like a lion and every time that he came we took the scriptures and we showed you every time he came when he came to Joseph to marry to all of them and he told them fear not amen but during Revelation 10 he doesn't tell them fear not because when he's roaring like a lion he wants to strike fear in their hearts he's come as a terrorist to terrorize them amen he's coming to claim his own yes amen and he's not casual about it there's any Rose like a lion he's come to take possession of his own amen hallelujah because when the deception came in Eden he didn't come there roaring like a lion and finish off the Beast the serpent in the Garden of Eden but this time that he's paid the price of redemption amen and the work of redemption has been accepted in Revelation 5 he's now coming down again amen with that open book and in that book has names now you'll only find that in the message of the hour amen if you read Revelation just alone Revelation chapter 5 you'll read Revelation chapter six nowhere does he tell you that the book has names right but there is one with a message designed to uncover The Mystery of the book you read Revelation 6 and every time he breaks the seal it only tells you and when he had broke the first seal the second seal he heard a boy saying come and see and then he talks about a rider four Riders right amen and then you know the fifth seal the souls Under The Altar and then the Sixth Seal the Great Tribulation and then the seventh seal there's silence in heaven but he doesn't tell you anything about what is written there right but here comes a prophet the one who the Bible speaks about in Revelation 10 7 that when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished and we know we've been well taught that we are part of the mystery of God because Eve is a part of the mystery of Adam so if he is revealing the mystery of God he's got to reveal all of the mystery of God that's why when he's taking Christ is the mystery of God revealed he starts out with Christ fully being revealed through Jesus Christ and now he's having the preeminence through a many-membered body amen we become part of the hidden Mystery that was locked up in Jesus amen amen amen and then he's going to restore the kingdom as the third part of that work so people try to make lions cute you know when you see a lion in fact if you want to know who was Adam's pit must have been a lion you know the prophet describes that scene and how the lion walks with him and he calls him shita amen and he tells him amen and they're walking in the cool of the day but I want you to know there's nothing cute about a lion if you'll ever come face to face with a lion there's nothing cute about it you can't go to the line here kitty kitty here kitty kitty let me stroke your main amen if you're standing in front of a ferocious lion fear is going to strike your heart amen in fact when that line Rose there's a reason why lines Roar the first reason is to communicate their location and when he was you want to tell us he's on earth now amen amen yes amen hallelujah I'm taking the national and typing the spiritual of Revelation 10. and that's when lion was to communicate his location amen amen when you are praying right now don't think that you are your prayers are sending up to somewhere far in heaven God is in the midst of his people amen he has come down in the midst of this battle the greatest battle ever fought he's come down in the midst of his people amen amen think of the captain of the horse when he went to Joshua that day he came down in the midst of the people a lion roars to communicate their location he wants to show his strength you know when he when he's trying to show the rest of the the other male lions he starts to Roar it's a show of strength and he wants to intimidate all the lions from the other Pride amen because on the earth in Revelation 9 there is one that he is warring like a lion seeking who made me devour yes amen he's using special voice effects is really a mouse but he's using a line filter [Music] I'm talking about the devil yes I'm talking about Satan yes amen hallelujah sometimes you hear a faint whisper because you really got your foot on his head other times he rose like a lion when you take your foot off his head amen but they say that a a simple Lion's role can paralyze the person the prey it paralyzes fear that's why they they freeze or he can strike Terror in the heart of a human now the role of a lion this is 114 decibels if you know what that is sound is measured in decibels is 30 decibels a normal conversation is about 60 decibels a motorcycle engine running is about 95 decibels noise above 70 decibels over a prolonged period of time may start to cause damage to your hearing amen so above 70 decibels can start to damage your hearing so think of double that 114 it's now under than 14 decibels that a lion can roar so a loud noise about 114 can cause immediate arm to the ears can you imagine now that these years is ringing when this line roared who was he roaring through who was echoing that wrong the prophet you are now the demons started to tremble you heard how the demons want you to shut him up because it was damaging the hearing amen any lines Roar can be heard five miles away if you don't know what five miles is that's just over eight kilometers away I don't even think it's eight kilometers from here to Gateway Mall so think of how loud this voice that it can go past that eight kilometers that's how loud the road is and when this line came to Raw in Revelation 10. amen his voice was heard all around the world amen Every Nation tribe and time begins to hear the Roar of this Mighty Angel and they couldn't understand it but they said isn't this just a man with seven Great education they didn't understand that Luke 17 amen was in effect that it was a son of man revealing the son of man and his raw struck fear in their hearts that they wanted to silence him yeah now Isaiah 63 and verse 9 just to show you who this Angel really is amen Isaiah 63 and verse 9 talks about the angel of his presence amen it says in all the Affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them amen the angel of the presence if you go and do a study about it it's referring to God amen it's not a regular or a created angel um amen I wanted to spell that notion this morning that the Revelation 10 Angel is a created angel the angel that came to the prophet in the cave is not a created angel right because God has bodies he's got an Angelic body he's got a fear from your body amen he's got a flesh body Hallelujah well right now there's no flesh body because it's now a glorified body but two thousand years ago he came in a flesh body [Music] now it's a glorified flesh body one that cannot die let him come this time and they try to take him and crucify him can't do it amen because he raised up to triumphant so the angel of his presence is referring to God not in regular or created angel we find you in Genesis 22 and verse 12 if we'll pick up that scripture Genesis 22 and verse 12. amen here Abraham is sacrificing and he's willing to sacrifice sacrifice Isaac and you know what he says let's just go up and we get context and the angel of the Lord so same Angel we're talking about now Angel of the Lord called unto him from Heaven saying Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do anything unto him for now I know that thou fear is God seeing thou is not what El thy son thy only son from who but who's speaking the angel of the Lord he's saying you have not withheld your only son from me amen amen hallelujah Exodus 3 and verse 14. you know what Exodus 3 is Moses seeing this great burning bush let's go up one okay I need to go further just to show you that it is the angel okay let's start here okay go to the next first we'll pick it up in X it says that Moses said unto God who am I that I should go on to Pharaoh that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be thy token that I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt You Shall Serve God upon this mountain and Moses said unto God behold when I come to the children of Israel and say unto them the god of your fathers that send me unto you and they say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am had sent me unto you amen now let's go to Acts chapter 7 to get some clarity here about who's really speaking to Moses amen acts 7 30. it says here and when 40 years were expired they appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in the in a flame of fire in a bush [Music] so it wasn't really just a bush burning but it was the angel of the Lord in a bush in an amber colored light the same one that is over the prophet amen the same one amen that led the children of Israel by night amen hmm so how come the angel is saying I am that I am when they asked you your name yes the Apostle Paul now speaking and he says the angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush when Moses saw it he wandered at the sight and he drew near to behold it the voice of the Lord came unto him saying I am the god of thy fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob verse 35 this Moses whom they refused saying who made thee ruler and a judge the same that God sent to be ruler and he delivered by the hand of who amen by the hand of the Angel which appeared to him in the bush amen amen Hallelujah amen let's turn to Acts chapter 8 and verse 26. we're speaking this morning on the emancipator amen the proclamation of emancipation last week which only amen the mighty Angel has come down with a proclamation he come to set us free from every tradition amen every denomination amen every man made tradition an idea and here here's the angel and what am I trying to show you right now the characteristic of this angel didn't he come now we just wait he came to set Isaac free yes he was bound on the altar but he came to set Isaac 3. amen the same one went you to the bush so they can get Moses attention to do what to set the children of Israel free amen this Angel of the Lord is an emancipator amen he has an Egyptian eunuch trapped by Traditions or maybe the Ethiopian culture and traditions but he had gone to Israel that day and he's looking at the scriptures and the Bible says he was serving in the temple and yeah he's reading the scriptures on his way back and he can't make head or tales of the scripture he doesn't know who the Bible who as I is speaking about in the Bible amen and he's pondering these things but I want you to know in the city of Samaria there was a great Revival taking place the apostles were doing a mighty work amen they were preaching the gospel sending the captives free amen people were being healed there was a great Revival set out in that City and here the angel of the Lord calls to Philip and he tells him in 826 and the angel of the Lord speak unto Philip saying arise and go toward the self and to the way that go down from Jerusalem and to Gaza which is Desert why arise and go he wants to set this Ethiopian eunuch free amen amen he's bound up in his thinking his theological ideas are all messed up he doesn't have the answer but the angel of the Lord is sending the messenger to go to him amen amen hallelujah I hope you're learning amen the angel of the Lord might use you to set one of his loyal subjects free the angel of the Lord might use you to call one of the names that is found in the book that is why he says go and prophesy again amen amen yes amen then you know the rest of the story how Philip goes there and he's translated in the moment in the twinkling of an eye man he doesn't have to look for the nearest train camel train going into the desert he doesn't have to look for a donkey yes he is translated amen amen amen Hallelujah this one the angel of the Lord is an emancipator because the angel of the Lord is God almighty brother Branham says he's this way only Christ it could be talking about Revelation 10 angel amen or if you read maybe you should put it up Daniel chapter 3 you'll read about three Hebrew boys didn't want to bow down to this great image of North Korea set up amen and they're bound them the Bible says they bound them and they threw them into a furnace amen I want you to see something here this is now King Nebuchadnezzar and he makes a decree that all should bow down before this great image which he had created and that the sounding of the trumpets and the music and everything everyone must bow their knee to this great image everyone familiar with the story amen amen okay let's pick it up okay it is let's go down okay this is where he's still making the Declaration I'm trying to show you the king makes two declarations the first time it's one of judgment if they don't obey his voice but he makes a second declaration the second declaration is one of emancipation I'm talking taking Nebuchadnezzar was a worldly King but I'm trying to show you a type right here amen we need to go past this he's still declaring him okay let's go past this amen let's move amen we need to find where they didn't bow okay we need to go quicker brother Caleb you slim the story okay is it true oh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego do not serve ye my gods no worship the golden image which I have set up so he's questioning them now now if you be ready that by what time you hear the sound so he's going to replay the music for them he's saying maybe you didn't hear the music I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt you know like when they ask you why you don't stop at this red robot he's going to give the three Hebrew boys a benefit of the doubt he's saying you know what I know you're a good voice y'all were the brightest that came out of Israel I'm going to give you all another chance let them play the music again let them play the corner to flute the up all of these things you fall down and worship the image which I have made and the same thing is going to happen to them yes who don't want to escape those that don't believe in escapism they're going to tell them this amen I am looking to escape amen I think I'm that's going to be one of my messages I preach looking for the Escape amen we are looking to escape this Sixth Seal tribulation all right some are not looking to escape someone's saying I'm enjoying life he's saying otherwise you shall be cast into the hour the in the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands he's asking them a question I want you to watch their confession now because this Angel of the Lord this almighty God will honor your confession amen yes amen God didn't tell them to answer this way he's asking he said if you don't bother now this time I play the music which God is going to deliver you watch their confession the same God in our high priest amen Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said oh King to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter you know what he's saying what are you saying we are not careful to answer you in this matter they have an absolute we don't have to second guess it yes amen neither are we fearful to answer you right now but we're speaking in the prayer Amen in our position in our Authority Under the revelation of our faith yes amen that's right let's go if it be so if it be so you throw us in the smallest Our God whom we serve he is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand O King yes oh Heaven must have got you attention even if they didn't want to do it they say hey hey hold on these children are really boasting about me now amen even when the doctor has given you up you put your pulse in the King of Kings get his attention and call Jesus on the scene amen maybe they were busy with other Affairs that day because heaven is a busy place Praise of the Saints going up and down amen God got his properties Eagle Eye Prophet Daniel on the Earth amen there's a time of Investigation judgment going on yes but here suddenly three Hebrew boys make a post throw us in the furnace and our God will Deliver Us oh God wakes up amen says amen one word got up and he said let me go down Walmart is the angel of waters and he said I will go and Destroy them like in the days of Noah I will go and I'll quench that fire with my Waters amen the prophet says Michael may have got up and Gabriel may have got up but God said this is a god-sized shop I'm going down myself yes but if not be known unto the O King we will not serve thy Gods Not worship the golden image which thou is set up yes yes they are confident he's saying even if God don't come we will soon not bow is the same way we preach healing of the body even if we go down to the Grave you must still continue preaching that Jesus is the Healer amen amen then Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and form a change now you see he was first kind to them now his form change towards them he's getting angry amen now he tells him make the furnace seven times hotter so after seven Church ages the furnace is now seven times larger he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and cast them into the burning fiery furnace so they are now bound they are they need freedom then these men were Bound in their coats with their coats their ocean and they asked and the other garments were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men who took Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and these three so even the ones that were taking them and finally throwing them they got burned felt okay look they fell down because they bound now they fell down into the midst of the burning fiery furnace there's three boys on the floor now No Escape they're bound now this guy got Keen eyesight he probably was taking his binoculars and he's trying to need to stay far away from the flame it says the king rose up in haste did not because three men Bound in the midst of the fire I want you to know that you see now these boys are not bound anymore yes yes how come the Flames only touched the shackles amen the answer that's it unto the king O King Lord I see four men loose amen who lose them yes amen the emancipator lose them amen I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God amen amen amen who told Nebuchadnezzar about the son of God right you know speaking Yeah Nebuchadnezzar is possessed of the devil Nebuchadnezzar had never seen the son of God isn't this the beginning of the Gentile kingdoms isn't he eternity Nebuchadnezzar right he can recognize the Son of God and we're living at the ending of the Gentile dispensation isn't he promised to come and encounter the pope yes amen same conditions exist yes amen but he's come to set his people free amen amen amen and now you can't you hear anybody can never say but then we set forth religion into the Earth didn't we deceive all denominations how come these ones are set loose and I see one like the Son of God descending upon them thank you Lord amen thank you what's the second declaration now Nebuchadnezzar came to the mouth and he said amen come forth and come either so they came out of the midst amen let's go now here's the second declaration a second declaration is different from his first his first one was one of condemnation his first one was to bind people to worship the second one is now blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego Hallelujah at the ending of the Gentile dispensation amen hallelujah the Bible says every knee shall bow and then we tongue shall confess that he his Lord amen yeah Nebuchadnezzar makes a declaration blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who has sent his who who is the deliverer who's the one bringing emancipation he had sent his angel and Deliver Us his servants that trusted in him and have charged the king's changed the king's word and healed in their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God amen therefore I make a decree that every people sounds familiar now think of Revelation 10 11. every people every nation and every language May would speak anything amidst against the god of Shadrach beshech and Abednego shall be catching pieces and their houses shall be made at downhill because there is no other God that can deliver after the sword [Applause] in many many men sorry I want you to see the power that leads in Revelation 10 and that's why we've been laboring to preach them for how many years now you go and count it trying to establish Revelation 10 this Mighty angel that descended and the power you possess when you now take the book [Music] amen I think we come now oh yeah promotion Waits For You after the devil can't deal with you that's right the king promoted him man amen you're uncircumcised philistine let's know what to do with you say I'd rather just promote you yes out of the way amen somebody received that in Jesus name amen many many men amen Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you'll find the same thing I'm not going to go through it now Genesis sorry Daniel chapter six exact same pattern two degrees go out the king makes a first decree If any man is found worshiping be thrown into the Den of Lions Daniel doesn't submit to that somebody emancipates Daniel from that Den of Lions who was it we already went through the types and patterns if I go and take every detail amen yes somebody delivered Daniel and after he's delivered the king makes his second decree I just showed you and I labeled this type if I do it it'll be like repetition but it's the same pattern it's the same Angel same as conditions exist amen amen and it's also why I took the three Hebrew boys because we are typing the three blue boys who stay true to Daniel's message amen [Music] so the potential is typing the prophet and we are typing the three Hebrew boys amen now I need to show you that the this Angel also has another characteristic and he's the strength Giver it's the same one we read in psalm 91. let's read Daniel chapter 10. it says here verse 18. how God strengthens us this Mighty Angels bring strength to us it says here then they came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he straightened me and said oh man greatly beloved fear not you should know who that is now amen last week we told you to recognize his language fear not peace be unto your deed be strong be strong and when he had spoken unto me I was strengthened and he said let my Lord speak for thou has sweetened me amen let's go to amen First Kings amen here's the time now Elijah is running from Jezebel you know he had slain the 400 Prophets and yeah in verse 3 he tells you and Elijah was afraid and ran for his life and when he came to basiba in Judah he left his servant there while he himself traveled on a Day's Journey to the Wilderness he sat down under a broom tree and prayed there that he might die he said I've had enough Lord take my life I know better than my father's then he sat you know he's sitting under this juniper tree and suddenly an angel touched him and said get up and eat amen the same Angel told you take the book and eat okay and he looked around and thereby his head was a cake of bread baked over odd coals and a jar of water the angel knows how to cook the angel knows how to paint and so we ate and drank and laid down again and his second time notice now a second time the angel of the Lord returned and touched him saying get up and eat or the journey would be too much for thee so he got up and ate and drank and strengthened by the food he walked 40 days and 40 nights until he reached horror at the Mountain of God amen oh bless the name of the Lord the food that this Angel gives to you amen he says you will be hungry no more the waters that I give to you you shall thirst no more he gave him sustenance that lasted him 40 days mmm why is that significant why am I highlighting 40 days there was another man he was no ordinary man and he was also in the dead of 40 days and after 40 days the amen Satan came to church him trying to show you the characteristic of this angel that is the strength Giver he is the emancipator but he also comes to give us strength John 12 28 let's pick it up and see this God man amen sorry I'm going first two ways glorifying his name now only I want you to hear this now John 12 now is caught up in glorification Father glorify thy name they came a voice from Heaven saying I both glorified it and will glorify it again do you watch always the second time we told you the angel touched him the second time Daniel the angel came to Elijah and fed him the second time now it's saying I glorified your name but I will glorify it again the people therefore now who is speaking to him the people therefore that stood by heard it said he thundered [Music] other said an angel spoke to him amen Hallelujah if you go there and you read amen the same one he's going now in the wilderness and he strengthens Jesus in the wilderness amen Hallelujah let's go to Acts chapter five I need to move on Amen I believe you got the point there amen this Angel strengthens us this Angel sets us free amen the angel of the Lord is on earth now fixing things now we find amen we're coming to New Testament now we went through the Old Testament showing you the angel of the Lord his characteristics and how we set them free we're now in the New Testament New Testament Church Apostle the apostles are on the Move amen here the high priest rose up verse 17 chapter 5 verse 17. and all they that were with him which is the sixth of the Sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison now we get into the angel of the Lord breaks down every prison door amen amen verse 19 it says the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors amen amen amen yes amen now what's the contrast if the enemy has you bound you will open up your prison door and set you free but here's the contrast there are other doors in your heart that he will not break down because you have locked it up and the prophet says the same God is a gentleman and unless you open up that door and invite him in yeah doors in a door so if the enemy has your shackle believe me he strikes me into the heart and he comes down and sets you free but don't you lock the door to your heart to him amen amen the angel of the Lord by Night open the prison doors and brought them forth and said go and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life what is he telling them go and prophesy again don't stop the prophecy don't let them put you in prison but thou must prophesy again and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and thought no we're not allowed to uh [Music] Thursdays are gone I think the police will come thou must prophesy again where did they go in a public place in a public setting amen yeah they're gonna call them now they went early in the morning now the I priest comes out and they that were with him and call the council together and the Senate now they're thinking that things continue the same they come back from a good night's sleep they know that the apostles are locked up in prison they come now with their fancy clothes and they're gathering for a great counsel VES and they're going to discuss this Apostles and what we are we're going to deal with him now the Senate of the children of Israel see they had Senators there too and sent them to the prison to have them brought come on [Music] yes you know when Satan lets you in your rut in your condition and he comes back to find you you see Satan is not all-knowing he can't be in all places at one time so when he makes you stumble he has to go somewhere else he thinks he's still got you in that condition but when they come to find you they see you're not there but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety this was mission impossible oh yes the gates are even shut doesn't look like there was they called brother Joshua that's your fingerprints you can't find any fingerprints brother Joshua doesn't that's fingerprints anymore amen but the Joshua is in a senior position here call his men to go and dance here amen but you get my point they call the private investigators who opened up these prison doors the report went back it doesn't seem like the locks were tampered with this must have been an inside job somebody must have had the key it says we found this we shut without safety and the keeper standing without before the doors yes amen but when we had opened we found no man with him and when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them where unto this would grow then came one and told them behold the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people amen amen let's go to Acts chapter 12. amen once I was bound now I am free amen free I'm free Free amen now here's Aaron when Edward would have brought him forth now he put remember he put Peter in prison now the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers they said this time you will secure the prison last time we put the soldiers outside the prison and we don't know how they escaped this time he's going to sleep between two prisoners Two Soldiers bound to two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison and behold somebody descends the angel of the Lord came upon him and the light shined in the prison and smoked Pizza on the side and raised him up saying I Rise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands amen why are you sleeping in the prison arise and the angel of the Lord said unto him God thyself and bind on thy sandals and so we did I want you to see there he knew he was in an uncomfortable situation so he tried to make himself to make himself comfortable within the prison why would someone take off your shoes why would you take off your sandals he too even took off his clothes some of his clothes he said you know what I'm in here for the long while I might as well make myself comfortable don't get comfortable amen don't rest emancipated is here he's telling me put your clothes back on it's amazing this Angel always tells you to clothe yourself the other one tells you take your clothes off and he went out and followed him wish not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision even he even he thinks this is now a vision one is walking when they went past the first the second war they came unto the Iron Gate that leaded unto the city which opened to them of its own accord [Music] sliding Gates and they went out and passed on through the street forward the angel departed from him and when Peter was come to himself he said now I know of a surety that the Lord had sent his Angel and had delivered me out of the hand of Aaron and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews amen Hallelujah this Angel of the Lord wants to deliver his people he wants to set you free from your condition amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord who is this Angel of the Lord amen he's come to set you free he has the title deed to your inheritance and he's come back for the title deed so that you can go free this morning you can Rise Up from your situation you can Rise Up from your condition amen there is nothing that is impossible with God and there is nothing impossible with you who believed in this most like God amen amen many many men Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen so we are speaking about on the wings of the mighty Angel and we are speaking about the emancipator we showed you his characteristics and now he sets his people free how he delivers them from bondage how he strengthens amen and he will not allow God's people to be bound up within Prison Walls men so when the greatest prison was set up in Satan's Eden so that I imprisoned now Satan thinking he's got everyone on the earth deceived but they are some within that prison where the mighty Angel has descended and he has set you free from your shackles once used to believe in three gods once you used to believe in a Triune baptism once he used to believe Amen in cutting hair once you used to believe Amen in taking the Eucharist [Music] you know all of these Traditions man-made traditions Hallelujah but somebody has come to set you free and give you a skill and understanding in this time in this season in this hour right because he is setting forth and he's preparing for the greatest battle ever fought amen so in this great Warfare down comes the angel of the Lord only Christ he could be to set the battle in the rain he's come to equip his people with the sword of the spirit that's what the word is the word is the sword amen and he has come to give you the sword amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen many many men and they are people Sons and Daughters of God who are rising up in

the prophet heard about it and he told one of the brothers you go pray amen and they said no brother we can't go pray amen so the planet prays for the baby and a baby who died in the early parts of the morning was raised back to life amen God will honor your faith God will honor your confession in many men yeah sometimes God answers in unusual ways and on your usual circumstances sometimes it won't even be the confession of your own faith but it'll be you agreeing with somebody else's testimony amen that is why don't take testimonies lightly amen when somebody is Justified say that's exactly right our God is able to do that and if we did it for you he can do it for me in many many men the prophet of God talking about his third pool now seated in that he writes home and he's sitting there amen and he's telling at you right about how that squirrel appeared and how he shot it amen and now it appeared by the power of the spoken word amen and Society actually right amen starts to identify with a testimony and she says that's exactly right brother Brenner foreign there is a quote about that the prophet says the angel of the Lord dropped down in the room [Music] it

sister either sitting in a wheelchair amen you are battling for money watch he goes beyond just physical healing he goes into finances and he says even that you can have right now the prophet says if

in this day because the world does not see the power of God they are saying since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were and it doesn't help when people try to contextualize I don't
