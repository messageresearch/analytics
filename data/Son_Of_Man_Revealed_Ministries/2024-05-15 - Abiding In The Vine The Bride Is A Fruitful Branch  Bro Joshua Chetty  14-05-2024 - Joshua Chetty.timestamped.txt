[9:33] way it used to
[9:35] be amen if you even in the world yes
[9:39] things are not the
[9:41] same the world has even the world system

[9:47] at politicians when you are looking at
[9:49] uh uh the economy and all these things
[9:53] that are going
[9:54] around look at it with spiritual eyes
[9:58] look Beyond the Veil of those people

[10:16] the angel of God amongst us amen and
[10:18] he's our influence yes amen he's the
[10:21] guide amen yes he is the one that is
[10:23] leading us thank you Lord he is the one
[10:25] has taken us when we turn the corner
[10:28] wondering what what are we going on to
[10:30] now where are we entering into it wasn't
[10:33] us it's the guide that is leading us
[10:35] amen when Moses was told to take the
[10:37] children out of Egypt to the promised
[10:40] land Moses don't know where he's going
[10:42] to he had to follow the guides the angel
[10:44] of the Lord went before him when Joshua
[10:47] was commissioned to take the people over
[10:48] Jordan he had to have the guide amen he
[10:51] had to meet the captain of the house
[10:53] amen am when this prophet of God was
[10:55] given the commission and to go and take
[10:57] this message around the world he had to
[10:58] meet the guide amen amen it was the
[11:01] angel of God leading him amen and that's
[11:03] why the angel of God even could lead him
[11:05] and say don't follow those ministers
[11:07] that want to go to Cape Town and so
[11:08] forth you need to come to Durban amen
[11:11] you have to follow the guide
[11:13] amen so just like that we have the guide
[11:16] in our lives sometime you might think
[11:18] your conscious is speaking to you
[11:20] telling you don't do this don't do that
[11:22] if you are sensitive to the Holy Spirit
[11:24] then you'll know who is speaking to you
[11:26] you'll know who is leading you amen and
[11:29] when you hearing sermons The revelation
[11:31] of God being unveiled to you week after
[11:34] week in such a way that it never was
[11:35] before then you need to look Beyond the
[11:38] Veil and recognize that the guide is
[11:40] here amen amen he the spirit of Truth
[11:43] when he come he will show you all things
[11:47] amen and he works through the five-fold
[11:49] ministry yes amen the St John chapter
[11:53] 15 reading from verse
[11:56] one I am the True Vine
[12:00] yes and my father is the husbandman amen
[12:05] so Christ is the true vine
[12:08] amen every branch in
[12:12] me that beareth not
[12:15] fruit he take it
[12:17] away because there can be branches in
[12:20] the
[12:21] vine amen grafted in but they will bear
[12:24] no
[12:26] fruit he take it away yes and every
[12:29] branch that bear fruit so there will
[12:31] also be branch that will bear
[12:35] fruit he Purge it
[12:38] it that it may bring forth more fruits
[12:42] amen because watch the husband man which
[12:46] is God working through the Holy Spirit
[12:49] coming down through the fivefold
[12:51] ministry he must Purge these
[12:55] branches because he don't want just
[12:57] fruit what he says that it may bring
[13:00] forth more fruits
[13:03] amen now they are clean through the word
[13:08] which I have spoken unto you Hallelujah
[13:12] now this bride has not just receive the
[13:16] the letter rain we receive the former
[13:18] rain and the letter rain so this bride
[13:22] receives word and receives stimulation
[13:25] of Revelation amen
[13:29] so now yeah I clean through the word
[13:33] which I've spoken unto you now this is
[13:35] not any word now this is not the word
[13:38] that you had when you had an experience
[13:40] in the
[13:40] denomination this is not a word you had
[13:42] experience out there no this is the
[13:45] message of the
[13:46] hour this is the original
[13:49] seed amen this is the original word this
[13:53] is the unadulterated
[13:55] word therefore you couldn't have a new
[13:58] birth out there in your denominations
[14:01] because the atmosphere wasn't right to
[14:03] but you amen you had to come in the
[14:06] message of the hour to receive the new
[14:08] birth you have to come under the right
[14:13] atmosphere so he says abide in me and I
[14:18] in
[14:19] you as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[14:22] itself except it abide in the vine amen
[14:26] no more can ye except you abide in me
[14:29] amen you may be seated I'll read more of
[14:31] that I just don't want you to stand long
[14:34] enough so he
[14:36] says now you clean through the word
[14:38] which have spoken unto you abide in
[14:42] me so he's the vine but he wants us to
[14:44] abide in him amen hallelujah now
[14:48] automatically when you're saying he is a
[14:49] vine and we abiding in him now we
[14:54] know that uh the vine it cannot produce
[14:59] produce the fruit it's the branches that
[15:02] produces the fruit yes but if you look
[15:06] at the natural Vine the vine produces
[15:09] the
[15:10] sep right and what what what is the
[15:15] sep that is speaking of the life amen
[15:20] amen because if you look at it in the
[15:23] natural SE can be considered like the
[15:25] blood of the vine yes just that we like
[15:28] in natural now let's do some biology
[15:31] like we have arteries and veins to
[15:33] transport blood through our body the the
[15:37] vine and FL the vine is Flo and xylem
[15:42] the flo would be more similar to oxygen
[15:45] rich
[15:46] arteries this is the nutrient Rich sap
[15:50] that flows from the leaves and brings
[15:52] the Hons and sugars to stem and
[15:56] Roots now what what that now in the
[15:59] spiritual he says here he is the main
[16:03] Vine that which comes out from the
[16:06] original root from the original seed
[16:08] that has life in it now the vine does
[16:11] not bear fruit it is the branches that
[16:13] do that now what this you can take a
[16:16] citrus tree as an orange tree and graft
[16:19] into it a grapefruit limb a lemon limb a
[16:22] Tang tangul Lim and other kinds of that
[16:25] variety and all those limbs will grow
[16:29] but those grafted limbs will not bear
[16:32] oranges no sir the lemon limb will bear
[16:37] lemons and the grapefruit lamb will bear
[16:41] grapefruit and so on yet those LMS will
[16:44] be driving of the life in the
[16:47] tree but if the tree ever puts forth
[16:50] another branch of itself amen amen amen
[16:55] we come from God and we go to God am
[16:58] amen amen so what he's speaking about
[17:01] here in the scripture automatically you
[17:02] are seeing there must be a connection
[17:04] with the branch and the vine The
[17:07] Roots amen there must be a connection
[17:10] between you and
[17:14] God we must be of the same amen you must
[17:17] come from the
[17:21] origins but those grafted Li he said but
[17:24] now when he's when he's giving the
[17:25] scenario you know what he's talking
[17:27] about right we know the message
[17:29] because there came a time after seven
[17:31] Church ages yes where the original word
[17:34] will come again because the prophet had
[17:36] to go out and seow amen but he's going
[17:39] around the world and he's sowing the
[17:41] seed but he's sewing the seed for what
[17:44] for another harest time amen because he
[17:47] knew there was going to be in harest
[17:49] time and he's going and sewing but he
[17:52] knew this one is going to produce the
[17:54] same life that was in the Vine
[17:59] thank you amen so we speaking tonight
[18:02] abiding in the vine the Bride is a
[18:06] fruitful
[18:08] branch and you can where I get the
[18:10] thought you can look at Genesis 49 verse
[18:13] 22 you can put that
[18:20] up Genesis 49 verse
[18:24] 22 when Joseph I'm sorry when when uh
[18:28] Israel Jacob is blessing is the 12
[18:34] tribes or the his 12 the 12 sons is his
[18:39] and he being Israel being a prophet yes
[18:42] is is prophetically prophesying over
[18:44] them but when he comes to Joseph in
[18:46] verse 22 he says Joseph is a fruitful
[18:50] bow even a fruitful Bow by a well whose
[18:54] branches run over the
[18:56] wall now Joseph we know types Christ but
[19:01] the mystery locked up in Joseph is
[19:03] perfection amen but and the bride has to
[19:06] come to perfection in this hour amen so
[19:09] that mystery is the bride is typing
[19:10] Perfection yes and if she's going to be
[19:13] the perfect one in this hour typing
[19:15] Perfection is our then she must be a
[19:17] fruitful Branch amen not anyone else not
[19:21] any other Church contemporary church
[19:22] it's a bride that will be a fruitful
[19:25] Branch yes amen so we find that we find
[19:30] ourself in the word in the message and
[19:33] we find oursel living on this word amen
[19:36] but if you remain stagnant and there's
[19:37] no growth then there's something wrong
[19:39] with you yes that's why God working to
[19:42] the 5old ministry is going to come and
[19:44] bring the word and the word is going to
[19:46] prune all the things all this world out
[19:49] it's going to prune Leia out because
[19:51] Leia has such an influence on you your
[19:55] families of the world have such an
[19:56] influence on you you say I don't spend
[19:58] time with my friends I don't spend time
[20:00] with people of the world watch your
[20:02] social media watch your communication
[20:04] because that's the communication you
[20:06] don't have to go to them but you can be
[20:08] communicating with them all the time and
[20:10] he said if you are not a strong
[20:11] influence over them they are going to
[20:14] influence you amen amen because that's
[20:17] how strong the spirits are now am amen
[20:20] and that's what the word is coming to do
[20:22] to to prune you out Amen to keep
[20:24] reminding you that you are not like
[20:26] every other human being that you are now
[20:29] somebody special on the earth amen you
[20:31] was born for a purpose amen you come
[20:34] from God and you are getting prepared

[20:44] message of the hour is not an Earthly
[20:46] message the message of the hour is not
[20:48] to make you build your kingdom on the
[20:49] earth the message of the hour is not
[20:52] make you to stay at bounds amen it shows
[20:55] you that you're an eagle it come to show

[21:09] you that you are living in the adoption
[21:11] age amen and if you are in the adoption
[21:13] age you have to receive the spirit of
[21:15] adoption amen and if you receive the
[21:18] spirit of adoption then it means your
[21:20] growth cannot be stunted amen it means
[21:23] that you are growing you are progressing
[21:25] in the faith amen that's why I said it's
[21:27] time we are the corner amen the very
[21:30] word that we have received from we not

[22:03] that no light has shine over

[26:45] long in a company of those that cannot
[26:48] produce quality conversation yes and our
[26:51] quality conversation is stimulation of
[26:54] Revelation
[26:56] amen amen so they they mistake us for
[26:59] introverts because we don't want to
[27:01] speak much amongst them we want to we
[27:03] want to shy
[27:05] away but the difference with
[27:09] us is that the only thing that
[27:12] stimulates us is revelation yes and you
[27:14] might say but we should be amongst all
[27:17] the people Jesus was among the publicans
[27:19] yes the prophet went around the world
[27:20] amongst all the denominations he was
[27:22] fellowshipping with them preaching among
[27:24] them there was an hour for that there
[27:27] was a time for that yes but under the
[27:29] third pool oh yes how many people was

[28:06] on Earth God pre-planned it he knew what
[28:09] time and season we be born he knew that
[28:12] he prepared us that we'll have an
[28:14] anointing for this age am he knew that
[28:16] for us to live out this age he'll have
[28:18] to anoint us to overcome this age amen
[28:22] amen he's given us the overcoming power
[28:24] for this
[28:25] age he knew what it would take and and
[28:28] you knew what calbar people was needed
[28:30] for this
[28:31] age we wouldn't have managed in the days
[28:34] of
[28:35] Paul they had a different anointing we
[28:38] are anointed for our age amen we are
[28:40] anointed to overcome 200 million demons
[28:42] on the earth demon power amen am we have
[28:47] to to overcome the deceitful hor Rider
[28:49] amen yes where is going around deceiving

[28:55] changing around the world in politics in
[28:57] e the economy and with the world system
[29:01] you are not deceived yeah he already
[29:03] told us what's going to happen we
[29:06] already were one of what was going to
[29:08] take place yes
[29:12] amen so all these
[29:18] things are not new for Are Not Unusual
[29:21] to us amen yes when you see Wars rumors
[29:25] of wars and all these things that are
[29:26] happening right now we shouldn't be
[29:29] shocked when we see all the economies
[29:31] that are captured we shouldn't be
[29:33] shocked amen we we know what Satan is
[29:36] doing amen we know that he's controlling
[29:39] the economies we know what he's planning
[29:41] what his end result is why is he doing
[29:43] that but under this third pool we are
[29:46] anointed to overcome this age amen we
[29:49] anointed where he said us if you abide
[29:51] in me and I abide in you ask what you
[29:54] will and he shall receive amen amen you
[29:58] know the first time that was
[30:01] used was
[30:03] underes amen the prophet of God sharing
[30:06] what happened in the woods sharing the
[30:08] testimony and she said she amen the word
[30:11] she believed it amen she said absolutely
[30:13] correct that's absolutely the truth
[30:15] brother Bram and then she could have
[30:18] whatsoever she desired yes she could
[30:21] asked for money she could have had it
[30:23] she could ask for the healing of
[30:26] uh of of her sister edot she could have
[30:30] had it whatever she wanted at that time
[30:33] she could have had
[30:34] it but she saw the need of eternal life
[30:38] for
[30:39] boys now you might have a different need
[30:42] whatever your need is you are abiding in
[30:44] the vine amen whatever your need is you
[30:47] can have it too
[30:49] amen if you go on in the Scripture it
[30:56] says let's read in verse four he says
[30:59] abide in me and I in
[31:02] you he said as the branch cannot bear
[31:05] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[31:11] vine no more can ye except you abide in
[31:15] me I am the vine here the branches he
[31:18] that abided in me and I in him the same
[31:21] bringeth for much fruit for without me
[31:24] you can do nothing amen yes so that is
[31:27] why you finding a dead Church world now
[31:32] there was a time where they was
[31:34] producing
[31:35] something because they was eating they
[31:37] was drinking of the the rain that was
[31:40] falling down yes they was enjoying the
[31:42] rain that was falling
[31:45] down but this is the hour now they are
[31:49] not abiding in the vine and whatever
[31:52] life was left in them died off now yes
[31:55] amen amen amen
[31:58] and when the life dies off it's no good
[32:01] anymore yes it has to be just stwn for
[32:04] the fire
[32:05] yes that's where we are right now
[32:08] there's no more life in there was a few
[32:10] years ago let's go 10 years back they
[32:13] had some life in them but it completely
[32:15] died off now and what they did now they
[32:18] substituted substituted it for
[32:21] entertainment in the church yes they
[32:24] brought entertainment because that's the
[32:25] only thing they can do now to keep the
[32:28] people in their numbers to keep the
[32:29] people there they to have entertainment
[32:32] and how did they get so big and mega and
[32:36] have all this money because when the
[32:38] prophet went out down to the South
[32:40] amongst the Pentecostals there were a
[32:43] poor bunch of people but spirit
[32:47] filled and he saw something about
[32:50] them and he was hiding there and then
[32:52] they told him he's a preacher and they
[32:54] called him to preach yeah you Le the
[32:55] story
[32:58] and how he preached and then he began
[33:00] inviting him but when the ministry went
[33:03] under the first two pools It produced a
[33:06] healing Revival around spearheaded a
[33:09] healing Revival around the
[33:12] world and it began those poor
[33:14] Pentecostals now began to get
[33:17] numbers they started to get the
[33:19] multitudes coming
[33:21] in and because of the numbers coming in
[33:24] they began to become very wealthy
[33:28] and they began to produce numbers
[33:29] because they was became successful in
[33:31] the
[33:33] Ministries and then
[33:35] eventually under the third pool now they
[33:38] rejected this Prophet they rejected the
[33:41] word they couldn't produce anymore now
[33:44] because his Prophet is not amongst
[33:46] them and as they started dying they
[33:48] started bringing now other things in
[33:50] started bringing doctrin Prosperity
[33:52] doctrines and so forth in to keep the
[33:54] numbers and to keep the money to keep
[33:57] the wealth in the church because what it
[33:59] says about the leian church yes th
[34:02] knowest
[34:03] thou say thou was rich and increased
[34:05] with Goods but knowest not that are
[34:07] naked
[34:09] yes amen so they became increased with
[34:12] goods and all these things but they
[34:14] benefited from this ministry amen they
[34:17] all benefited from
[34:19] this but now it's time because they
[34:22] haven't abided in the
[34:23] vine there's no life in them amen
[34:30] amen so he said and I in the same
[34:33] bringeth forth much food for without me
[34:35] you can do nothing if you what is he
[34:39] he's the word Christ is the word this
[34:43] same Jesus that they claim I love you
[34:45] Jesus oh and we sing about Jesus we love
[34:48] Jesus but he said if you love me you
[34:51] will keep my words amen and my words
[34:55] will not be Grievous unto you
[35:00] yes amen so they don't want him the word
[35:05] and his word is Grievous to
[35:08] them but he saying they love
[35:12] him they love the benefit of him yes if
[35:16] a man abide not in me is cast for as a
[35:19] branch and is withered and Men gather
[35:23] them and cast them into the fire and
[35:25] they are burned if ye AB in me and my
[35:28] words abide in you you shall ask what
[35:30] you will
[35:32] yes and it shall be done unto
[35:35] you now you think God is a
[35:38] liar he's saying if you're abiding in me
[35:41] which means now you're abiding in this
[35:42] life you enjoying this life amen you are
[35:45] drawing from this Fountain of Life you
[35:48] abiding in the vine amen you are staying
[35:49] in the word amen you are faithful to the
[35:53] word you are being stimulated by the
[35:56] word then he's saying you shall ask what

[36:07] my father
[36:09] glorified that ye bear much fruits amen
[36:12] so shall you be my disciples you see how
[36:14] God is glorified when you bear much
[36:19] fruit amen he said as the father loved
[36:23] me so have I loved you continue Y in my
[36:27] love

[36:40] Commandments and abide in his love he
[36:43] said this is my commandment that you
[36:46] love one another as I have loved you
[36:50] amen now how did he love
[36:53] them did he compromise with what he is
[36:56] the word
[36:58] no he brought his he shared with them
[37:01] his word amen how did he love them he
[37:05] shared with his disciples the word while
[37:08] he speaking out there in Parables with
[37:10] them he revealed his word plainly amen
[37:13] amen he began to speak his word in plain
[37:16] language to them he opened up the word
[37:18] to them others couldn't see it but they
[37:21] could see
[37:22] it he said and watch what he says here

[37:31] my joy might remain in you and that your
[37:35] joy might be fill he said this is my
[37:38] commandment that you love one another as

[38:17] maturity and the word is not made plain
[38:19] to you then you can remain as a servants

[39:21] first then the blessings came to her
[39:24] amen she be to be obedient to the word
[39:27] yes for the word of God comes to the
[39:30] prophet and she had to obey the word

[40:22] His
[40:23] Bride he for every
[40:25] age he called up bride out amen which is
[40:29] all makes up the bride amen and in this
[40:31] age he called A peculiar people people
[40:34] with certain characteristics that will
[40:35] be part of his
[40:38] bride but I have chosen you and ordained
[40:41] you that you should go and bring for
[40:44] fruits and that your fruit should remain
[40:47] that whatsoever you shall ask the father
[40:50] in my name he may give it you these
[40:52] things I command you that you love one
[40:55] another amen if the world ate you you
[40:59] know it hated me before it hated you if
[41:02] you were of the world the world would
[41:04] love his
[41:06] own but because you are not of the world
[41:09] but I have chosen you out of the world
[41:12] therefore the world hated you so you see
[41:15] we are in this world but we are not of
[41:18] this
[41:19] world we are representing another
[41:21] kingdom while we are here amen we're
[41:23] ambassadors of another kingdom remember
[41:27] the the word that I said unto you the
[41:29] servant is not greater than his Lord if
[41:32] they have persecuted me they will also
[41:34] persecute
[41:35] you so he is the word now right we know
[41:39] they persecuting the word if they have
[41:41] kept my saying they will keep yours
[41:44] also so when you are speaking you're not
[41:46] speaking your own word you are speaking
[41:48] his words amen amen so don't be shocked
[41:51] in the hour of the third pool in the
[41:53] hour of the opening of the word when you
[41:55] are preaching to the Souls Lost in
[41:56] prison where people totally don't want
[41:58] to hear the word or people are are
[42:00] shocked at the things that you're saying
[42:01] and they have no idea they have no clue
[42:03] and they don't want to even hear
[42:05] it so that's the hour that we we
[42:07] approaching now
[42:10] amen but we still have to go and preach
[42:13] the gospel am he said you must take up
[42:15] your cross and follow me he never said
[42:17] you mustn't be
[42:18] persecuted but you will be persecuted
[42:20] for the true word
[42:24] amen he said but all these things will
[42:26] they do unto you for my name sake
[42:29] because they know not him that sent me
[42:31] if I had not come and spoken unto you
[42:34] unto them they had not they had not had
[42:37] sin but now they have no cloak for their
[42:40] sin he that hated me hated my father
[42:44] also if I have had not done among them
[42:48] The Works which none other man did they
[42:50] had not had sinned but now have they
[42:53] both seen and hated both me and my
[42:55] father but this come to pass
[42:57] that the word might be fulfilled that
[42:59] written the law they hated me without a
[43:01] CA and we know that in a message
[43:03] indictment this is what happened again

[51:01] before we come to the body chain he's
[51:03] bringing us back to Dominion again
[51:06] bringing us back to the same things that
[51:07] Jesus did amen the things that Adam lost
[51:10] is bringing us back to that again that
[51:13] must happen before the body change amen
[51:16] so in between the body change and where

[51:23] we comeing to full Authority amen amen
[51:27] amen the one that will say speak to this
[51:29] mountain
[51:32] yeah so now if we call
[51:35] ourselves are he
[51:43] says the vine only makes energy for the
[51:46] branch and if you went out into the
[51:48] field down here in the river bottom and
[51:51] found a pumpkin vine you'd expect that
[51:53] pumpkin to be Bing pumpkins and if you
[51:55] found a what watermelon it should be
[51:57] bearing watermelons if it's a grape vine
[52:00] it Bears grapes because the life is in
[52:02] the vine pressing forth grape juice or
[52:04] grape life or watermelon life into the
[52:06] branch and the branch is producing what
[52:09] the vine is energizing for now we call
[52:12] ourself Christians and we are the
[52:14] Christian
[52:15] church then we should be bearing the
[52:18] same type of fruit that the vine bore
[52:21] when he was here for he said I am the
[52:25] vine here the branches if you abide in
[52:27] me and my word in you ask what you will
[52:30] it will be done for you and the branch
[52:32] cannot live unless it bu in the vine now
[52:36] if it's a good healthy Branch the branch
[52:39] if it's not healthy something is wrapped
[52:41] around it cut of the energy sooner soon
[52:45] the pruner comes by and cuts that Branch
[52:47] off yes and then is destroyed and then
[52:51] today after okay now it'll be 2,000
[52:54] something years and we thought that
[52:56] Jesus is not dead but is alive do you
[52:59] believe that amen we are seeing it in
[53:02] present time if Jesus was dead then how
[53:06] did we get here if Jesus was dead how
[53:09] did this message go around the world
[53:12] Amen a onean
[53:15] Ministry taking this word how can this

[53:48] amen they must produce the same fruit
[53:54] amen the message so we would see Jesus

[54:00] scripture when in John 15 he said I am
[54:02] the vine here the branches now the vine
[54:04] doesn't bear fruit it's a branch you

[1:01:18] now inhabitance of Jerusalem and Men of
[1:01:21] Judah judge I pray you bet me and my
[1:01:24] vard
[1:01:26] what could have been done more to my
[1:01:28] vard that I have done not done in the it
[1:01:33] or what more could be done that he
[1:01:35] didn't do already sent a prophet around
[1:01:38] the world with such great
[1:01:40] manifestations taken this world around
[1:01:43] the
[1:01:44] world what more must he do for us amen
[1:01:48] he given us the opening of the words
[1:01:50] amen he's given us all of his words yes
[1:01:53] he's given us all of the promises amen
[1:01:57] all that was in God reporting to Christ
[1:02:00] all that was in Christ reporting to his
[1:02:02] church amen but he's speaking here to to
[1:02:07] Israel he said what could have been done
[1:02:10] more to myard that have that I have not
[1:02:14] done in it wherefore when I looked that
[1:02:16] it should bring forth grapes brought it
[1:02:18] forth wild
[1:02:20] grapes and now go to I'll tell you what
[1:02:24] I will do to my vard I will take away
[1:02:27] the edge thereof you see what happens
[1:02:29] when you don't a abide in the vine and
[1:02:33] produce of his own
[1:02:35] kind yes this is what he's saying now I
[1:02:37] will take my Edge you want to leave the
[1:02:39] word you want to venture into the world
[1:02:42] you want a taste of
[1:02:44] Leia you want to be influenced by
[1:02:48] Leia 200 million
[1:02:51] demons they can be very influential yes
[1:03:02] they know how to get to you demon powers
[1:03:04] know how to get to
[1:03:05] people but he only can get to you when
[1:03:08] you leave the word
[1:03:10] yes when you leave the
[1:03:13] word and you want to remain in a backing
[1:03:16] condition in a time when about to take a
[1:03:19] Rapture people don't want to come and
[1:03:22] worship God in the time when we about to
[1:03:25] have a body ch change people not
[1:03:27] interested in the things of God and
[1:03:31] worried about how much they can achieve
[1:03:33] in this
[1:03:35] life what he's telling us he'll take the
[1:03:38] edge there off and it shall be eaten up
[1:03:41] and break down the wall off and it shall
[1:03:42] be thren down now trust me none of God's
[1:03:46] children will be lost but you will
[1:03:49] chastise you won't be lost if you
[1:03:52] predestinated but doesn't mean he won't
[1:03:54] deal with you
[1:03:56] God will deal with you because he won't
[1:03:59] lose none of his amen he didn't die in
[1:04:02] vain amen none of his will be lost but
[1:04:05] if he has to deal with you he will deal
[1:04:06] with
[1:04:07] you and that's why you find sometimes
[1:04:10] people going in the back condition and
[1:04:13] year of things happening happening to
[1:04:15] the families happening to
[1:04:18] them until they go and repent and make
[1:04:21] things right
[1:04:24] yes and now will lay it waste and it
[1:04:26] shall not be PR no dig but there shall
[1:04:28] come up briers and Thorns that also
[1:04:30] command the clowns that no that they

[1:04:38] Israel and the men of Judah is Pleasant
[1:04:42] planets last quote he said now
[1:04:46] yeah now he is here he promised to be
[1:04:49] here and now the only way that he can
[1:04:52] work is by his promise I am the viney
[1:04:55] and the branches and the branches bear
[1:04:56] record that a life is coming from the
[1:04:58] vine where he doesn't have any life in
[1:05:01] it but if it's energized by the life
[1:05:04] it's got the same life that the vine has
[1:05:06] got it's compelling itself or pushing
[1:05:09] itself up to the
[1:05:12] branch
