[0:09] Amen. You got your Bibles? We'll turn to
[0:11] the book of One Peter, chapter 4,
[0:13] reading from verse 12.
[0:16] Amen. There's one thing you can't get
[0:17] away from is the anointing. Amen.
[0:22] Now when the when the word comes in an
[0:25] anointing
[0:27] and it and and and it flows in a certain
[0:29] level
[0:31] and you catch the rhythm of it,
[0:34] right? And you stay in that in the
[0:37] rhythm of it because you're under the
[0:38] the anointing of the composure. And when
[0:41] you're under the anointing of the
[0:42] composure,
[0:44] then you have to sing with the tune at
[0:47] the beat that is going on. Amen. And you
[0:50] got to have discernment to catch the
[0:51] beats because God
[0:55] speaks certain things for certain
[0:57] reasons because what he's ultimately
[1:00] doing is positionally placing you. Amen.
[1:03] Thank you. So if the if the Holy Ghost
[1:06] is speaking in a certain way, you got to
[1:08] have discernment to catch the anointing
[1:11] and where the anointing is leading you.
[1:13] Amen. because it's leading you into this
[1:16] beat and you got to be in harmony with
[1:19] the beats. Amen. You don't want to be
[1:20] out of tune. Amen. So you can't leave
[1:23] the if if he's going in a certain tune,
[1:25] you can't leave that tune to go to
[1:27] another tune because he's taking you in
[1:30] a certain thing in a certain place is
[1:33] positionally placing you. Amen. So we're
[1:36] going to see where the Holy Spirit is
[1:37] leading us and where he's been leading
[1:39] us for the past couple weeks. Amen.
[1:42] So 1 Peter 4:12, it says, "Beloved,
[1:45] think it not strange concerning the
[1:47] fiery trial which is to try you
[1:51] as though some strange thing happened
[1:53] unto you.
[1:55] But rejoice in as much as they partakers
[1:58] of Christ's sufferings, that when his
[2:01] glory shall be revealed,
[2:04] yay may be glad also with exceeding
[2:08] joy." Amen. Somebody say his glory is
[2:11] being revealed.
[2:13] Somebody is being rec Somebody say I'm
[2:15] recognizing that his glory is being
[2:17] revealed through his bride. Amen.
[2:20] If ye be reproached for the name of
[2:23] Christ, happy are ye. Yes.
[2:26] For the spirit of glory and of God
[2:30] rested upon you. Amen. Where does the
[2:33] spirit of glory and of God rested upon
[2:36] you? Yes. On their part is evil spoken
[2:40] of. Who is there?
[2:43] People normal human beings of the world.
[2:46] People out of a faith civilization.
[2:49] Another civilization. You are of a
[2:52] different civilization. Amen. You are of
[2:54] a faith civilization. Hallelujah. You
[2:57] are a different species.
[2:59] Amen.
[3:05] And if y
[3:10] So God on their part is evil spoken of
[3:13] but on your part he is glorified.
[3:16] But let none of you suffer as a murderer
[3:19] or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a
[3:24] busy body in other men's matters. In
[3:27] other words say what is basically as you
[3:29] say these are people who has not have
[3:31] been born again. These are people who
[3:34] have not recognized who they are. These
[3:37] are people who have not come and been
[3:40] taken out of amnesia. They still walking
[3:43] after the former things. So let it not
[3:45] be amongst them. Right? Yet if any man
[3:48] suffer as a Christian,
[3:51] that is mean now you've come into
[3:52] Christ. You accepted Christ as your Lord
[3:55] and Savior. You baptized with the Holy
[3:57] Ghost. Amen. Amen. And now you are
[3:59] walking in the precepts of the word. But
[4:02] he says, "Now, yet if any man suffer as
[4:04] a Christian, let him not be ashamed,
[4:08] but let him glorify God on this behalf.
[4:12] For the time is come that judgment must
[4:16] begin at the house of God."
[4:21] And if it first begin at us, what shall
[4:24] the end be of them that obey not the
[4:27] gospel of God? And if the righteous
[4:30] scarcely be saved scarcely.
[4:33] So this is not a lot of people. Amen.
[4:37] Where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[4:40] appear?
[4:42] Wherefore let them that suffer according
[4:44] to the will of God commit the keeping of
[4:46] their souls to him in welloing as unto a
[4:50] faithful creator. Amen. You may be
[4:52] seated.
[4:56] We'll also turn to the book of Hebrews
[4:58] 12:1.
[5:02] Just laying down my scriptures for a
[5:05] foundation. Amen. Uh as you know uh
[5:08] these scriptures were mentioned in in a
[5:10] few weeks of services. Now that's why I
[5:12] said you got to catch where the Holy
[5:14] Spirit is taking you. Amen. Amen.
[5:18] So, and it's a beautiful thing if you
[5:21] catch the anointing and you're in the
[5:23] rhythm in the rhythm of the composure
[5:25] and you're moving with the beat. It's a
[5:26] beautiful thing.
[5:28] Amen. And that's what God wants. God
[5:31] wants his people to be in harmony.
[5:34] He wants his people to be in oneness and
[5:36] to catch the spirit of the composure.
[5:40] So Hebrews 12:1 says, "Wherefore, seeing
[5:43] we also are compassed about with so
[5:45] great a cloud of witnesses,
[5:48] let us lay aside every weight,
[5:52] and the sin would don't so easily beset
[5:55] us. And let us run with patience race
[5:58] that is set before us. We don't want
[6:01] want to be earthbound.
[6:03] We are pilgrims and sojourers. We want
[6:05] to travel lightly. We don't want to
[6:08] carry burdens of this of this nature of
[6:11] this old nature. We don't want to carry
[6:14] trials and burdens of this world of this
[6:17] world system. Amen. Because why? We are
[6:20] not conformed any longer to the pattern
[6:22] of this world. But we are renewed. Amen.
[6:25] In our minds we are renewed because we
[6:27] receive the mind of Christ. Yes Lord.
[6:33] So we say looking unto Jesus the author
[6:39] and finisher of our faith who for the
[6:42] joy that was set before him endured the
[6:45] cross
[6:47] despising the shame. And he sat down at
[6:51] the right hand of the throne of God.
[6:54] For consider him that endured such
[6:57] contradiction of sinners against
[6:58] himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in
[7:01] your minds.
[7:04] Ye have not yet resisted unto blood,
[7:07] striving against sin, and ye have
[7:10] forgotten the exhaltation which speak
[7:13] unto you as unto children.
[7:17] My son, despise not thou the chastening
[7:22] of the Lord.
[7:24] No faint when thou art rebuked of him.
[7:28] Please don't forget the exhaltation.
[7:31] Don't forget the word that has been
[7:32] preached to us. Don't forget all the
[7:36] word that we've been receiving, the
[7:37] mechanics that we've been receiving.
[7:39] Amen. Because come at the hour now,
[7:42] Amen. where it's time for for you now to
[7:46] all that was you've been receiving,
[7:47] you're going to manifest now the
[7:49] dynamics are going to bring the
[7:50] mechanics into effect. Yes. Amen.
[7:54] Because there's coming a time now where
[7:56] you're going to make this bring this
[7:57] word into operation. Yes. Amen. The very
[8:01] word that you've been eating off, it's
[8:02] going to come into effect. It's going to
[8:05] come into full operation. And there's
[8:07] going to be opportunities in your life
[8:09] when you're going to bring this word
[8:10] into effect.
[8:12] Amen. The letter kill it, but the spirit
[8:14] giveth life.
[8:26] For whom the Lord loveth, he chasten it,
[8:29] and scorgeth every son whom he
[8:32] receiveth. If ye endure endure
[8:35] chastening, God dealeth with you as with
[8:40] sons.
[8:44] For what son is he whom the father
[8:47] chastenth not?
[8:50] But if yay be without chastisement
[8:53] wherefore whereof all are partakers then
[8:57] are a bastards illegitimate children and
[9:01] not sons.
[9:04] Furthermore, we have had fathers of our
[9:08] flesh who corrected us and we gave them
[9:12] reverence.
[9:15] Now, we know a father in the flesh is
[9:18] correcting you mostly for his own good
[9:20] because he don't want you to make
[9:21] naughty when you're small, when you're
[9:23] little. He's saying keep quiet, sit
[9:26] there, do this, clean the house, do the
[9:29] things. It's for his good. Or maybe he
[9:33] wants to get you on the right path. But
[9:35] when you grow older, he's not going to
[9:36] chastise you. You're a big boy now.
[9:38] You're big now. When you come of certain
[9:40] age, he said, "I did my part. Now it's
[9:43] up to you to listen or not." He can't He
[9:45] can't come and do the same things. But
[9:48] God is different.
[9:51] Amen. God is doing it for your good.
[9:54] Amen. To bring you onto his purpose. To
[9:57] bring you onto his intended plan for
[9:59] you. Amen.
[10:01] Amen. Cuz God had eternal thoughts
[10:05] and he had the end result. He knows the
[10:07] end result for you. Amen. And he wanted
[10:10] to bring you into the perfect plan. Yes.
[10:12] Yes. You was walking out of the perfect
[10:14] plan.
[10:16] But he allowed that because you had to
[10:19] go along your life's journey.
[10:21] You had to go along your path. But in
[10:24] time and season, he knew how to bring
[10:27] you back. Amen. If he had to use the rod
[10:30] of chastisement, he would use it because
[10:32] he knew that rod wouldn't kill you, but
[10:34] he'll bring you back on the on the right
[10:36] path and he'll bring you to appreciate
[10:39] what he what he has in store for you.
[10:41] Amen.
[10:45] So, we give reverence to earthly
[10:47] fathers. Shall we not much rather be in
[10:49] subjection unto the father of spirits?
[10:54] Can you see there what he's doing right
[10:56] now? What the scripture is doing? One is
[10:58] making earthly father referring to your
[11:00] flesh. One father of spirits to the real
[11:04] you now
[11:06] because only why you were a supernatural
[11:08] being. You're a spirit man. You're
[11:10] trapped in a flesh body. Amen. But now
[11:14] he's now he's bringing you now to the
[11:16] real father, the father of spirits and
[11:19] showing you the real you now. Amen. and
[11:22] live. For they verily for a few days
[11:25] chastened us after their own pleasure,
[11:29] but he for our profit that we might be
[11:32] partakers of his holiness.
[11:35] Amen. So you see God already the
[11:39] scripture is taking you back to the real
[11:40] you. He's coming to take you now outside
[11:43] the message of the hour. Nobody knows
[11:45] this. Nobody focus on the real man.
[11:49] Amen. Everybody focus on this
[11:52] on this earthly body on the five senses.
[11:56] Amen. But the six sense and the real man
[12:00] when you the the real soul within you.
[12:02] Amen. That where the gene of God is.
[12:04] Amen. That the one that is now wants to
[12:07] be expressed out of you that wants you
[12:09] to bring because it's by faith when
[12:11] you're hearing the word. Amen. Faith
[12:12] cometh by hearing and hearing of the
[12:14] word. And the word that you are
[12:16] receiving is going to bring expression
[12:18] to the gene of God. that's within you.
[12:20] Amen. And the faith word that you're
[12:22] receiving, the revelation of the word is
[12:24] making that inward man grow and grow
[12:27] until it brings complete expression that
[12:29] that is going to dominate and bring this
[12:32] fleshly man under subjection. And this
[12:34] fleshly man is no longer speaking. But
[12:37] the man that is within you, the spirit
[12:39] man is speaking through the flesh man.
[12:42] And who dwells in the flesh man? In the
[12:44] spirit man, it's the Holy Ghost. It's
[12:46] the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost.
[12:48] It's a control tower. It's from there he
[12:51] navigates your life. It's from there
[12:53] where he's your guide. But you got to
[12:56] have allow him to have lordship. You got
[12:58] to allow him to have dominion and to
[13:01] have control over you. You've got to how
[13:04] you how do you do that? You come to full
[13:06] repentance where you come to humble
[13:08] yourself. You come to consecration to
[13:10] him and you come to full surrender and
[13:13] you yield yourself unto him. Amen. He's
[13:16] not going to force himself onto you.
[13:19] You've got to yield yourself to him.
[13:21] You've got to allow the Holy Ghost to
[13:23] have control over your life.
[13:26] If you want to see the blessings of God
[13:28] in your life, then allow the Holy Ghost
[13:31] to have full control, full access to
[13:33] you. Amen. Don't give him partial
[13:36] access. You've got to give him full
[13:39] access. Amen. But don't worry, God knows
[13:42] how to deal with sons. If you are son
[13:45] and daughter of God, God knows how to
[13:48] whoop you into shape. He knows that he's
[13:51] doing it for your profits. He's doing it
[13:54] for your own good. Amen. He's not for
[13:57] just for his pleasure, but for your own
[13:59] good.
[14:02] because he says for the present seemth
[14:06] sorry the chastening for the present
[14:07] seemth uh now no chastening for the
[14:11] present seemth to be joyous but
[14:13] grievious
[14:15] so you wouldn't understand it sometimes
[14:18] why you think that firstly god has
[14:21] blessed me with his beautiful job he's
[14:23] given me all his good finances and all
[14:26] his great blessings and there you are
[14:29] going down your own paths
[14:32] there You take a different journey now.
[14:35] Now you forgot now that God has blessed
[14:37] you with all his inheritance and all his
[14:40] good blessings. I'm just giving you a
[14:42] practical example now.
[14:45] And God says, "Yes, my son. I put my son
[14:48] on the earth for a purpose.
[14:50] I have a plan for my son."
[14:53] And my son now has received all his all
[14:56] his blessing and he thinks that's the
[14:58] end result. when these are temporal
[15:00] things. He's not seeing it through how
[15:03] I'm supposed to see it. He's not seeing
[15:06] it through my eyes.
[15:08] So, what God's going to do, he's going
[15:10] to make he's going to bring you to a
[15:11] point where you'll humble yourself.
[15:17] And he will chastise you
[15:20] because our chastisement is not like the
[15:22] world. The world goes into judgment.
[15:26] Our chastisement is to correct us. Our
[15:30] chastisement is because of election. His
[15:33] elective love. His correction for our
[15:36] own good to bring us unto the purpose.
[15:39] Because why? God's purpose must be
[15:42] fulfilled. Amen. Nothing will stop God's
[15:46] purpose. Amen. God knows how to bring
[15:48] his sons to that purpose.
[15:52] Amen. So you can go where you want to
[15:55] go, do what you want to do, but he will
[15:57] know how to bring you. Amen.
[16:01] You can never run away from a from the
[16:03] presence of God. You know what happened
[16:04] to Jonah when he went to Nineveh? God
[16:07] has to still bring Jonah back to his
[16:09] purpose. Amen.
[16:13] So the
[16:15] it it doesn't seem good. It seemed
[16:17] grievous. Nevertheless, afterward it
[16:18] yielded the peaceable fruit of
[16:20] righteousness unto them which are
[16:22] exercised thereby. Amen. So a little
[16:25] title I'm just speaking on this morning.
[16:27] God purges his sons into character.
[16:32] Power without character is satanic. You
[16:34] know the prophet spoke about that.
[16:37] So we know that God is bringing you into
[16:40] power. But power without character is
[16:43] satanic.
[16:45] Why is he saying satanic?
[16:47] Because Satan had power in heaven
[16:51] without character. He was in a position
[16:54] of power. What I say position meaning he
[16:57] was made in the highest form of angelic
[17:00] beings in a way that nobody was so
[17:03] beautiful as him in angelic form.
[17:06] And he had this but he had pride. He
[17:09] didn't have character. He had pride. He
[17:12] became proudful, boastful.
[17:16] Amen. But God knows that sons of God, he
[17:19] doesn't deal with him like that. Amen.
[17:21] Satan was not a son of God. Amen. He was
[17:25] a created angelic being. You always was
[17:29] in a back part of God. You come from
[17:31] God. Hallelujah. He's a created being.
[17:35] Amen. But you are from God. You are part
[17:39] of him.
[17:41] Amen.
[17:43] So God don't deal with you like that. So
[17:46] he's bringing you into power and you
[17:48] must come to power because he has this
[17:50] for you. He has this inheritance for
[17:52] you. All this was for you. Amen. His
[17:56] entire plan of redemption from Genesis
[17:58] to Revelation has been revealed now has
[18:01] been open to us through the opening of
[18:03] the word was all just for you. Thank
[18:05] you, Lord. Amen. But he in you all he's
[18:08] going to bring you and mold you into
[18:11] character. Amen. In you are he's going
[18:13] to purge you. Amen.
[18:15] Romans 8:17 says, "Therefore, brethren,
[18:19] we are debtors, not to the flesh, to
[18:22] live after the flesh. For if ye live
[18:24] after the flesh, ye shall die. But if ye
[18:28] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[18:30] of the body, in other words, you bring
[18:32] it under subjection, amen, to the word,
[18:35] ye shall live. For as many as are I led
[18:38] by the spirit of God.
[18:43] Now there's only a group of people only
[18:47] specific or peculiar
[18:49] selected elected people on the earth
[18:52] that are led by the spirit of God.
[18:55] Nobody in this day can say they are led
[18:58] by the spirit of God and miss the shout.
[19:01] Yes. Outside of the shout, they are not
[19:04] led by the spirit of God. Amen.
[19:09] So only sons of God can be led by the
[19:11] spirit of God. So many as are led by the
[19:15] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[19:19] You might say, "Brother, but people are
[19:21] prophesying in in God's name and
[19:22] prophecies are coming to pass." Yes. He
[19:25] said, "Many shall come in that day and
[19:27] said, Lord, have I not prophesied your
[19:29] name? Lord, have I not cast out demons
[19:31] in your name? He said, but depart from
[19:34] me workers of iniquity. I know you not.
[19:38] They have not come under union. Amen.
[19:42] And if you don't come under the union,
[19:44] you've been taught that because when you
[19:46] only when you come under union, sons are
[19:48] produced. Amen. Through the union. Amen.
[19:53] So for ye have not received the spirit
[19:57] of bondage again to fear, but ye have
[20:00] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[20:05] we cry aba father. They can't cry aba
[20:09] father. We cry aba father. Jesus cried
[20:13] aba father. What that means? It's a
[20:15] relationship. It's a closeness to do the
[20:18] will of the father because you want to
[20:22] do the will of the father only for you
[20:24] to say aba father means father let your
[20:27] will be done not my will but your will
[20:29] be done it's a relationship it's a
[20:31] respect and a reverence that you have to
[20:34] go because you can't say that you love
[20:36] god in this hour because many are
[20:38] walking around saying I love Jesus I
[20:41] love Jesus holding pluckards and so
[20:43] forth and when the and uh people come
[20:46] against them, they're saying they're
[20:47] being persecuted. But that same people
[20:49] who saying they love Jesus, ask them if
[20:52] they can be obedient to his word.
[20:53] Because he said if you love me, you will
[20:55] love my word and my word will not be
[20:58] grievious unto you.
[21:00] You cannot say I love Jesus. I love
[21:02] Jesus. But don't love his word. You
[21:06] persecute his word. You crucified his
[21:08] word again in this day.
[21:12] So to call out abba father is a
[21:14] closeness. It's only for sons of god.
[21:18] Amen. Not as anybody can become a son of
[21:21] god.
[21:22] No no no no. It's by election by his
[21:25] predestination. Amen.
[21:30] You had to always be a son of god. Amen.
[21:34] You had eternal thoughts of god.
[21:36] Hallelujah. Amen. So you can't just be
[21:40] put there and then neither can you be
[21:41] taken out of there. As a son of God, you
[21:44] cannot be taken out of the equation.
[21:46] Amen.
[21:48] So you have a choice. We have a choice.
[21:52] We can follow.
[21:55] We can do the will of the father. We can
[21:58] be about father's business or we can go
[22:02] wayward. But but remember if you go
[22:05] wayward father will chastise us to bring
[22:07] us back.
[22:10] Amen. Because he loves us.
[22:13] Not one of these will be lost. Amen. For
[22:16] ye have not received the spirit of
[22:19] bondage again to fear but you have
[22:20] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[22:22] we cry aba father. The spirit itself
[22:25] bear witness with our spirit that we are
[22:27] the children of God.
[22:30] And if children then hes
[22:33] heirs of God and joint hes with Christ
[22:38] because he is the firstborn of the new
[22:40] creation.
[22:42] Everything that Christ inherited we
[22:44] inherit. Amen. If so be that we suffer
[22:48] with him that how do we suffer with him?
[22:52] You become Christlike. You take up your
[22:54] cross. You follow him. Amen.
[22:57] And you you take his word. You love his
[23:00] word. You appreciate his word. You don't
[23:02] reject his word. Despite the odds,
[23:04] despite no matter what, you will take
[23:06] God at his word. No matter what
[23:09] situation you are in, you will be
[23:12] obedient to his word. You will not
[23:15] reason with his word. Amen. You will not
[23:18] argue with his word. You will not doubt
[23:21] his word. You will not be like the
[23:23] fundamentalists who who know the word,
[23:26] but they argue with the word. They
[23:28] reason with the word. Amen.
[23:35] And if children and ears of God and
[23:37] joints with Christ and so be that we
[23:40] suffer with him that we may also be that
[23:45] we may be also glorified together. For I
[23:48] reckon that the sufferings of this
[23:50] present time
[23:53] are not worthy
[23:55] to be compared
[23:58] with the glory. Amen. Which which shall
[24:01] be revealed in us.
[24:04] Do not worry about temporal sufferings.
[24:07] Do not worry about temporal
[24:08] circumstances and situations. This is
[24:11] where God wants us now to look beyond a
[24:14] circumstance
[24:16] to look beyond our canality.
[24:19] Amen. You might be looking at sometime a
[24:23] situation happens in your life and then
[24:25] you start to reason that maybe now you
[24:28] you want to cause some trouble. It
[24:29] causes some trouble with some people.
[24:32] But these are carnal things. You need to
[24:34] look beyond that and have discernment.
[24:37] Amen. And recognize that you're a son
[24:38] and daughter of God. that you are here
[24:41] on a mandate and Satan uses circum he
[24:43] uses your bad circumstances to come in
[24:46] and inflict more nonsense in your life.
[24:50] Amen. That's why he says now he wants to
[24:53] purge us because he is the vine. We are
[24:57] the branches. That's why sometimes we
[24:59] need some pruning in our lives. Amen.
[25:02] Amen. Some branches need some purging,
[25:04] some pruning because why? Now this is a
[25:08] fruit time, right? This is the harvest
[25:10] time where the fruits are showing. Now
[25:12] you go to the shop, you got different
[25:15] classes of apple, right? But all are
[25:17] apple. Maybe you look at apple. Let's
[25:20] let's take apple for example. You look
[25:21] at apple. Not all the apple tastes the
[25:24] same. There's different categories of
[25:26] them. But they all are fruit and the
[25:30] apple. We're talking about apple. Now
[25:32] we're not talking about just say one
[25:34] fruit that tree produces apple. But you
[25:36] get different categories, different
[25:37] classes of apple
[25:40] because sometimes in that branch
[25:44] it might have a lot of leaves and looks
[25:47] very nice and have lots of fruit in it
[25:50] or lots of leaves in it and the branch
[25:53] gets heavy.
[25:55] But the right husband man or the farmer,
[25:58] he knows that he must prune that branch
[26:00] if he wants quality apple.
[26:02] If he wants to produce quality apple,
[26:04] he's going to prune that branch.
[26:09] And yet there's other branches that you
[26:10] say, "Look at that branch. Lots of leaf,
[26:12] lots of fruit in it. See how nice?" But
[26:15] you take this apple, this one with less
[26:17] apple, it's much more better quality.
[26:20] Just like that. God needs to prune us
[26:23] out of all this worldly systems. Yes,
[26:26] maybe there's there there's people in
[26:28] our lives that's that's very toxic in
[26:31] our life. There's relationships in our
[26:33] lives who we need to get rid of. There's
[26:36] it might seem nice that we're having a
[26:37] good time. We have good fellowship with
[26:40] them. They're good company. They seem to
[26:42] be good people. But it might not be what
[26:45] God wants for us. When God called
[26:48] Abraham and was taking Abraham to his
[26:50] purpose, he had to leave everything
[26:52] behind.
[26:54] And the purpose was only fulfilled when
[26:56] everyone when all the baggage had to
[26:58] come off. When he pruned Abraham off
[27:01] everything
[27:03] when God was taking Joseph into
[27:05] perfection, he had to leave the
[27:08] household. Amen. He had to leave the
[27:10] brethren. Well, he actually sold him
[27:12] away. But it it was God's purpose
[27:14] because God's purpose had to be
[27:16] fulfilled.
[27:18] Sometime it's going to be you and God
[27:19] alone. Sometime it's going to be a quiet
[27:22] journey. Amen.
[27:24] It's not going to be always around
[27:26] people. Sometime God wants to have you
[27:29] alone
[27:31] because you never have a personal back
[27:33] of the desert experience. You've been
[27:36] around maybe in church too much. Maybe
[27:38] you've been around in fellowship too
[27:40] much. But God wants you alone.
[27:43] He wants you to make a commitment,
[27:46] a personal commitment. And sometime God
[27:49] going to have to throw you right down.
[27:51] He might have to throw you on the
[27:53] hospital bed if he has to.
[27:56] There was a time when Billy Paul
[27:59] was having his experience in the world
[28:02] but God had to bring him on the hospital
[28:05] bed
[28:06] for him to come and repent truly repent
[28:09] to God. So each of us have to go through
[28:12] that journey. Each of us have an
[28:14] appointed personal ex time where we have
[28:18] to make that commitment to God. a
[28:20] personal surrender to God. Not because a
[28:23] husband is doing it or the wife is doing
[28:25] it or I'm pressurized by the pastor to
[28:27] do it or I'm pressurized by my family to
[28:29] do it. No, each of us got to make a
[28:32] personal commitment to God.
[28:36] Amen.
[28:42] So God is not raising us as children
[28:45] that are just spoiled.
[28:48] You know what spoiled brats are?
[28:50] Children just get everything they want.
[28:55] I'm not talking about babies now. I'm
[28:56] talking about children. You know when
[28:58] they're coming off age and they spoiled.
[29:01] They still want to get everything they
[29:02] want. They don't take responsibilities.
[29:08] But he's raising us sons to share his
[29:10] throne.
[29:12] Amen.
[29:15] This is a kingdom we're talking about
[29:19] where he's making us kings and priests
[29:22] where he ordained for us already before
[29:25] the foundations of the earth to be kings
[29:27] and priests.
[29:31] We can't come to him a hazardly.
[29:33] We are not God don't cause us to serve
[29:36] him a hazardly. Amen. Because for sons
[29:39] to come to adoption means they're going
[29:41] to tutors.
[29:43] They're going to choose us to discipline
[29:45] them. You're going through disciplining
[29:47] in your life. That's what the Holy Ghost
[29:49] is doing. All along our journey as we
[29:51] were m getting the word, the Holy Ghost
[29:53] was bringing us bringing us to his word,
[29:56] bringing us back to his word. Every time
[29:57] we step out of the word, he brings us
[29:58] back. He brings a situation to bring us
[30:00] on our knees, bring us back in line with
[30:02] the word. Amen. He's always there to do
[30:05] the checks and balances
[30:10] because judgment must begin in the house
[30:12] of God. That's why he's given us a word.
[30:16] A word that comes to whoop us into
[30:18] place. Amen.
[30:20] This is not a wishy-washy gospel.
[30:24] You can go around the world and find
[30:26] people call themselves Christians,
[30:27] different places as churches preaching
[30:29] and and just preaching a good message,
[30:31] making you feel a feelood message. This
[30:34] is not a feel-good message.
[30:37] This is a message showing you to who you
[30:39] are, who you really are. That you a son
[30:41] and daughter of God. Amen. That you are
[30:44] eternal beings. That your purpose is not
[30:47] to be on this earth. But there's a new
[30:50] world to come.
[30:52] Amen.
[30:56] So God is preparing you now on this
[30:58] earth for that earth. Amen.
[31:03] So
[31:06] we know that God before he gives us
[31:08] power, he molds us into character. Amen.
[31:12] As the prophet said that character is a
[31:14] victory. Amen. It's not a gift. It's a
[31:17] victory. Let's just read that quote.
[31:22] See if I can get it.
[31:25] Okay, let me just read this quote here.
[31:26] He says, "As Job said, he put strength
[31:29] in us." Job 23:6, he said, "You see, he
[31:34] himself suffered. He learned obedience
[31:37] by the things that he suffered. He was
[31:40] actually made perfect by the things that
[31:42] he suffered." Hebrews 5:8 and9, he said,
[31:44] "Though he son, yet learned obedience by
[31:49] the things which he suffered, and being
[31:52] made perfect, he became the author of
[31:56] eternal salvation unto all them that
[31:58] obey him." In plain language, the very
[32:02] character of Jesus was perfected by
[32:06] suffering.
[32:08] This is what he's saying us. The very
[32:10] character of Jesus was perfected by
[32:13] suffering.
[32:14] And according to Paul,
[32:17] he has left his church a measure of
[32:20] suffering.
[32:23] that they too
[32:25] by their faith in God while suffering
[32:29] for him
[32:31] would come to a place of perfection.
[32:35] So you see the end result is perfection.
[32:37] Amen. Why did he want this? James 1:24
[32:43] says, "My brethren, count it all joy,
[32:47] when ye shall fall into diverse
[32:49] temptations, knowing this, that the
[32:52] trying of your faith workketh patience.
[32:56] But let patience have a perfect work,
[33:00] that ye may be perfect, an entire one
[33:03] thing, nothing."
[33:05] Why does he stand by? The reason is in
[33:09] Romans 8:17 to18 he says and if children
[33:13] then hes of God and joint hes with
[33:15] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[33:19] that we may also glorified together for
[33:23] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[33:25] present time are not worthy to be
[33:28] compared with the glory which shall be
[33:29] revealed in us. That's what we just
[33:31] read. Now unless we suffer with him we
[33:34] cannot reign with him.
[33:37] We want to reign with Christ. Amen. No,
[33:40] that is God's plan for us. It's not
[33:42] something that we asked for. It's
[33:44] something that he ordained for us. Amen.
[33:46] Amen. He ordained that we will reign
[33:47] with Christ. So he will bring us the
[33:50] suffering to per he will bring us this
[33:52] purging. He will bring this character
[33:55] that he wants to perfection. Amen.
[33:59] So count it all joy. Amen. That is why
[34:02] when you know the end of the story, when
[34:04] you know the word by faith, which is
[34:06] faith is a revelation, when you have a
[34:08] revelation and you understand it now,
[34:11] then you know how glorious this is.
[34:13] Amen.
[34:17] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[34:19] present time are not worthy to be
[34:20] compared with the glory shall be
[34:22] revealed in us. Unless we suffer with
[34:24] him, we cannot reign with him. You have
[34:26] to suffer to reign. The reason for this
[34:29] is that character simply is never made
[34:31] without suffering. Character is a
[34:33] victory, not a gift. A man without
[34:37] character can't reign because power
[34:40] apart from character is satanic. I'm
[34:43] just echoing the word that was already
[34:45] preached to you. The reason why it's
[34:47] just bringing emphasis to it. Amen. But
[34:50] power without character is fit to rule.
[34:54] He already said us that we are meant to
[34:56] rule with Christ. Amen. We are meant to
[34:59] reign with Christ. Then that's why he's
[35:01] giving us character now. He's saying
[35:03] power with character is fit to rule. So
[35:07] you can't
[35:09] you got to have power to reign with
[35:11] Christ. But you can't have power without
[35:13] character. But if you once you got
[35:15] character and you got power then you are
[35:18] foot to rule. Amen. Then what it what it
[35:21] means? Then he shall put then all things
[35:24] are under our feet.
[35:26] Amen. Cuz that's where we coming to.
[35:28] Amen. What was in the beginning, Adam
[35:31] had all things in subjection to him.
[35:33] Amen. He was the highest form. Amen. On
[35:36] the earth and all thing was under his
[35:38] feet. Was subject to Adam. He was the
[35:41] God of the earth.
[35:43] You become f to rule. Amen. You come to
[35:46] dominion again. Back to the original
[35:49] condition. Amen.
[35:54] So he says
[35:57] a man without character can reign
[35:58] because power apart from charact
[36:00] character is satanic but power with
[36:02] character is foot to rule and since he
[36:04] wants us to share even his throne on the
[36:07] same basis that he overcame and he sat
[36:10] down in his father's throne then we have
[36:12] to overcome to sit with him and the
[36:15] little temporary suffering we go through
[36:18] now he is not worthy to be compared to
[36:22] the tremendous glory that will be
[36:24] revealed in us when he comes.
[36:27] Oh, what treasures are laid up for those
[36:30] who are willing to enter into his
[36:32] kingdom through much tribulation. That
[36:35] is what he means by when you say
[36:36] tribulation and suffering now in this
[36:38] time. It's not just you must suffer in
[36:40] this life. What he means is you can come
[36:42] to full obedience to the word. No matter
[36:45] in this age where they hate this word,
[36:47] in a age where this word is despised,
[36:51] you can stand with this word. Amen.
[36:53] Amen. No matter how much persecution you
[36:56] go to for being a Christian, where you
[36:58] can go in the midst of sinners and and
[37:00] be able to say, "I am a Christian. I
[37:03] cannot indulge in the things that you
[37:04] indulge in because I am a Christian."
[37:08] Even when you when you got unbelieving
[37:11] families and maybe and they're
[37:13] worshiping idols and say no I cannot
[37:15] indulge with those things that you are
[37:17] word because I am a Christian
[37:21] or you having this this worldly things
[37:24] in your house and you're having this
[37:25] worldly show. I cannot come to this
[37:27] worldly show because I'm a Christian.
[37:29] Amen. Amen. These are the tribulations
[37:32] that you'll go through. The suffering
[37:34] that you have to go through is when you
[37:35] have to stand with the word. Amen.
[37:40] when all men shall revile you and speak
[37:41] evil of you for the word's sake. Amen.
[37:46] So he said,
[37:49] "Think it not strange concerning the
[37:51] fiery trials, the fiery trials that are
[37:53] to try you." That is what Peter said. Is
[37:55] it is it strange that God wants to
[37:58] develop a Christlike character that
[38:00] comes through suffering? No sir. And we
[38:04] all have trials. We are all tried and
[38:07] chastened as sons. Not one, not one but
[38:12] goes through that. The church that is
[38:14] not suffering and is not being tried as
[38:17] in got it. It isn't of God.
[38:21] Hebrews 12:6 and 8. You wonder sometimes
[38:24] how people these churches and they they
[38:27] they they're living in the world. They
[38:30] they they whole they're not being
[38:32] obedient to the word of God. They
[38:34] preaching their own gospel. Yet they
[38:36] they prosperous. They increase to goods.
[38:39] They are blessed because their time of
[38:42] judgment has not come yet.
[38:44] But you go and do one wrong thing and
[38:47] see how the Lord will chastise you
[38:49] because you are a son and daughter of
[38:51] God. You try and walk out of the word of
[38:54] God and see if the Lord don't deal with
[38:56] you.
[38:58] You can go. The world is here waiting.
[39:00] The world has lot to offer. Try and go
[39:03] and experience the world
[39:05] and see if the Lord if you are chosen of
[39:07] God. If you are selected to be a son and
[39:10] daughter of God by his election, see how
[39:14] long you can stay in that way. See how
[39:16] long you can stay in sin.
[39:18] You won't be able to do it
[39:21] because why? The minute you even think
[39:23] evil, the Holy Ghost leaves you. And see
[39:26] if you can live without the Holy Ghost.
[39:28] When you experience living with the Holy
[39:30] Ghost, see if you can stay without the
[39:32] Holy Ghost.
[39:34] You can't live without the Holy Ghost.
[39:38] I know what it is to have not have the
[39:40] Holy Ghost. When you got the Holy Ghost,
[39:42] you cannot live without the Holy Ghost.
[39:44] Amen. And you do something wrong, you
[39:45] think wrong, you pray him back. Amen.
[39:48] Amen. You can you'll even go on your
[39:50] knees and cry to him and say, "Lord, I
[39:52] cannot live without you." Amen.
[39:56] Amen. If you know what it is to have the
[39:58] Holy Ghost, you cannot live without the
[39:59] Holy Ghost. You'll feel lifeless without
[40:02] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[40:07] Now
[40:08] he says,
[40:11] now the special condition in Smyrna,
[40:13] he's speaking in this this this message
[40:15] in the SMAN church age book. Now he
[40:17] says, now this special condition in
[40:19] Smyrna must be applied to every age.
[40:23] So what this condition is going to test
[40:26] going to trials going to purging. Amen.
[40:29] Going to sufferings. He said it must be
[40:31] applied to every age. There is no age
[40:34] free from it. There is no true believer
[40:36] free from it. This is of God. This is
[40:39] the will of God. It is needful.
[40:42] We need the Lord to teach us the truth
[40:45] that we are to suffer and be Christlike
[40:47] in doing it. Love suffereth long and is
[40:51] kind. Matthew 5:11-12 says, "Blessed are
[40:55] ye when men shall revile you, and
[40:58] persecute you, and shall say all manner
[41:00] of evil against you falsely for my sake.
[41:03] Rejoice and be exceeding glad, and great
[41:06] is your reward in heaven, for so
[41:07] persecuted they the prophets which were
[41:10] before you." Amen.
[41:16] He says in the message
[41:19] the evening messenger he says God has
[41:22] always counted character not members.
[41:27] So you wonder today whether we are
[41:28] looking for a lot of members. He says
[41:31] God has always counted character. See
[41:34] when he's counting people are counting
[41:36] how many members they got. But he is
[41:38] counting character
[41:40] not members. And today we do vice versa.
[41:44] We count members good dress, well
[41:47] prayers instead of character.
[41:50] Eliza sweated it out until he found
[41:53] character. That's right. Who would he
[41:56] get? And he trusted God. Character for
[41:59] what? Character for Isaac. Didn't we
[42:02] have a Eliza in this day? Character for
[42:04] Christ. Amen.
[42:07] The bride which the church is a type of.
[42:09] You know that that was the natural seed
[42:11] of Abraham. This is the royal seed of
[42:14] Abraham.
[42:15] While if Aliza the messenger hunting the
[42:18] bride and trying to find character, if
[42:20] that man is come a messenger of the last
[42:23] day trying to find the bride of Christ,
[42:26] he will not look for a denominational
[42:28] membership. He will look for character
[42:30] that's willing.
[42:33] He says watch good character first. Then
[42:37] first his good character then to get her
[42:41] ready to meet Isaac
[42:44] after he found the character then get a
[42:48] stand long still long enough to listen
[42:51] to the message.
[42:53] So he said that's the messenger of the
[42:56] last days the evening light is first
[42:58] find the church will they believe the
[43:01] message that's what we we did when the
[43:04] shout came did we reject it there was
[43:07] something in us that made us believe it
[43:10] there was character in us amen that made
[43:12] us identify with that character amen
[43:17] there was something in us that made us
[43:19] identify that character and then we have
[43:21] stayed long enough to to eat the
[43:24] mechanics and the mechanics and the
[43:26] mechanics. We are long enough to eat the
[43:28] word. And now after eating the word, we
[43:31] are right now at the time to meet Isaac.
[43:34] Our Isaac. Amen. We're going to see him
[43:36] face to face one of these days. All that
[43:39] we've stayed long enough to listen to.
[43:41] Amen. The greatest love story ever told.
[43:44] Amen. And all that he has for us and all
[43:47] this great inheritance that he has for
[43:48] us. Amen.
[43:50] In the message of testimony on the sea
[43:52] says God have mercy on us. If we are the
[43:55] sons and daughters of God yet we are an
[43:58] alien in this life. God is looking for
[44:01] character from men and women who can
[44:03] conduct themselves as sons and daughters
[44:05] of the king. God have mercy on us that
[44:07] we'll we will do it. That's what I am
[44:11] friend I'm after friends character.
[44:13] That's what God is pulling for
[44:15] character. That bride that will be taken
[44:17] out as sons and daughters of God. Let's
[44:19] act like it be sons and daughters of
[44:21] God. God help us.
[44:25] Amen. In John 15, he says, "I am the
[44:28] true vine, and my father is the husband
[44:31] man. Every branch in me that beareth not
[44:34] fruit, he take it away. And every branch
[44:37] that beareth fruit, so there's going to
[44:38] be a branch that beareth fruit, he purge
[44:41] it." So you don't just want fruit. Amen.
[44:45] You want quality fruit.
[44:48] You might say, "I'm just a Christian. I
[44:49] believe the message. I believe the
[44:51] message of the hour. I'm a Christian. I
[44:53] come to church. I'm bearing fruit. I
[44:55] believe that. You can see the fruit in
[44:56] me. I believe the message. I don't deny
[44:58] the word. But are you quality fruit?
[45:02] Are you an effective ambassador of the
[45:04] kingdom of God? While you on this earth,
[45:08] are you displaying that you are son and
[45:10] daughter of God upon the earth? Are you
[45:13] quality fruit or you just fruit? Are you
[45:15] satisfied just to be fruit or you
[45:17] quality fruit? Well, the hour has come
[45:20] where he has to purge now. He has to
[45:23] prune you. Amen. And bring you into
[45:25] quality fruit. Because he says here,
[45:29] "And every branch that beared fruit, he
[45:33] purged it that it may bring forth more
[45:36] fruit." You see, he wants abundance of
[45:38] fruits. Amen. Now ye are clean through
[45:42] the word which I have spoken unto you.
[45:44] abide in me and I in you. As a branch
[45:47] cannot bear fruit of itself,
[45:49] except it abide in the vine.
[45:53] No more can yay except ye abide in me. I
[45:58] am the vine, ye are the branches. He
[46:00] that abideth in me, and I am the same
[46:02] bringeth forth much fruit. For without
[46:05] me, yay can do nothing.
[46:08] You see, you got to abide in the vine.
[46:11] You got to stay under him. Amen. And he
[46:13] gives expression, he brings life to the
[46:14] fruit. Amen
[46:19] in the in the in the in the message, the
[46:21] approach to God, he says, "Now, if you
[46:24] ever notice how that when the disaster
[46:26] struck Job's home and the children was
[46:29] all killed and everything and all Job
[46:31] had was destroyed, God wasn't rebuking
[46:34] Job. He was only purging Job." Amen. I
[46:39] like that word, a purge. You might say,
[46:41] "But Job lost everything.
[46:45] He lost his children. He lost his
[46:47] family. How can that not be a bad
[46:49] thing?" But he says here, he wasn't a
[46:52] rebuke. It was a purge.
[46:55] The branch that bears fruit, then God
[46:58] purges it. That it'll bring forth more
[47:00] fruit. The trouble of it is we think
[47:03] sometime God's angry with us
[47:07] but he's only trying to purge us that
[47:09] will bring abundance of fruit. You see
[47:11] where God is doing it? Sometime we go to
[47:13] certain things God
[47:16] is taking off certain things of us. He's
[47:18] purging us. He's taking off things that
[47:20] is not going to be quality in our life.
[47:23] You know, maybe he's taking off certain
[47:25] type of relationships,
[47:27] certain types of things that we do, and
[47:29] we maybe we think, but there's nothing
[47:31] wrong with these things. But God is
[47:34] bringing you to the position that he
[47:35] wants to use you effectively.
[47:38] He wants you to have the fullness, the
[47:40] abundant blessings that he has in store
[47:42] for you. Amen. But you are looking at
[47:44] temporal things. You are looking at
[47:46] earthbound things. But God is bringing
[47:48] you to greater things.
[47:58] So he says
[48:00] then God purges it then he'll bring
[48:02] forth more fruit. The trouble of he
[48:05] thinks God's angry with us but he's only
[48:07] trying to purge us that we'll bring the
[48:09] abundance bring abundance of fruit
[48:11] giving us a few trials. The Bible said
[48:13] that they worth more to you than
[48:16] precious gold.
[48:18] Did you ever know that every son that
[48:20] cometh to God must first be tried?
[48:22] Whooped. Child whooping correction. It's
[48:25] not easy. When God gives you whipping,
[48:27] you go out here and say, "Well, I'll
[48:29] mingle around a little bit." God will
[48:31] give you a real oldfashioned spanking
[48:32] for it. And I tell you, if we had more
[48:35] of that in the natural today, we'd be
[48:37] have better children. God wants his
[48:40] house all straightened out. So, he gives
[48:42] you a little whooping so you can get
[48:44] straightened up, makes you love him
[48:46] more. Because what God wants to do, he
[48:48] wants to make you foot to rule
[48:50] because he's bringing you to maturity.
[48:54] Because you can't come as a you can't
[48:56] you couldn't come to adoption without
[48:58] coming to that stages of coming to
[49:00] correction, coming to chastisement,
[49:03] coming to tutorship. Amen. But when
[49:06] you're now adopted, you are now fit to
[49:08] rule. You are fit to analyze affairs
[49:13] where now you don't have to say in my
[49:15] father's name because you're holding the
[49:17] father's authority. Amen. You are
[49:20] speaking in the first person because
[49:23] when you speak the father's authority is
[49:25] behind you. Amen. The father's authority
[49:28] is backing you. Amen. Because why? You
[49:31] have the rightful place to do that.
[49:33] Amen.
[49:37] It's just like you know we If you look
[49:40] at the story of David, we know that
[49:42] David, he was already anointed by Samuel
[49:45] when he was young,
[49:48] right? But he was not yet approved. He
[49:51] was already anointed by Samuel because 1
[49:54] Samuel 63
[49:56] speaks of it. Then Samuel took the horn
[49:58] of oil and anointed him in the midst of
[50:00] his brethren. So he was chosen by God.
[50:03] He was anointed by God. Yet he did not
[50:06] step into power immediately.
[50:09] God took him first to the wilderness.
[50:13] Amen. And then we know that he was going
[50:16] through his experiences. Then one time
[50:18] he's hiding from Saul and he's he's
[50:20] going for refuge in the caves in Edulum.
[50:24] But all this time was it was David's
[50:26] humbling time.
[50:28] He he he couldn't go to to the palace.
[50:31] He couldn't go to any other place. But
[50:33] God is bringing him in a cave.
[50:35] He's bringing in a place to humble him
[50:37] that he could learn enough that how
[50:39] powerful an anointing is that even when
[50:42] Saul was out of touch of God. Amen. When
[50:47] when Saul was was now
[50:50] God has despised Saul, but yet you could
[50:53] say he couldn't touch God's anointed
[50:56] when he even had the opportunity to take
[50:57] the kingdom from Saul. David could have
[51:00] taken the kingdom by force, but he
[51:03] waited for God's time. Amen.
[51:06] Because what God was molding his
[51:08] character,
[51:09] it was God's training ground. We know
[51:12] when when when he was with Goliath
[51:14] there, when he was in a wilderness with
[51:16] the with the lion, with the bear, and so
[51:19] forth, it was God's training ground for
[51:21] him. When he was with Goliath, it was
[51:23] God's he became now recognized
[51:26] throughout Israel. Amen. He was like a
[51:29] hero to them.
[51:31] But instead of going to the throne, God
[51:33] put him now into exile, molding his
[51:36] character more and more. Amen.
[51:40] But when the time was right in Psalms
[51:42] 1971, it says, "It is good for me that I
[51:45] have been afflicted that I might learn
[51:47] thy statutes." He had to learn the ways
[51:50] of God. Amen.
[51:52] So what he was doing, David learning
[51:54] humility before he was going to be king.
[51:56] Before he became crowned king, he was
[51:59] now learning humility. He was learning
[52:01] patience. He was learning how to have
[52:04] mercy because he even spared Saul's life
[52:07] when he could have taken Saul's life.
[52:10] And he became totally dependent on God.
[52:15] So God was purging David.
[52:18] He was what he was doing giving him a
[52:21] heart of a shepherd king. Amen. giving
[52:25] him when he was going to be ruler there
[52:27] because from David from that kingdom
[52:29] amen he was going to come as son of
[52:31] David again amen through that lineage
[52:34] amen there was going to be a different
[52:35] kind of lineage amen it was going to be
[52:38] a lineage that through that lineage he
[52:40] will come and use that name of that
[52:41] lineage amen
[52:44] so put his son sometime to dark places
[52:48] he puts us to some wilderness experience
[52:51] he puts us in isolated situation
[52:53] sometimes
[52:54] Because God wants us sometimes to come
[52:56] out of the cave.
[52:58] God wants us to come out of the
[53:00] situation a different person with a
[53:02] molded character. Amen. To be more and
[53:05] more like him. And he wants us to become
[53:07] more and more dependent on him. Not
[53:09] dependent on ourselves. That's why the
[53:11] apostle Paul said, "Thy grace is
[53:13] sufficient for me."
[53:16] So you find that David refused to take
[53:18] the kingdom of force even when he had
[53:21] the chance. 1 Samuel 26:23 says, "The
[53:24] Lord rendered to every man his
[53:25] righteousness and his faithfulness, for
[53:28] the Lord delivered thee into mine end
[53:30] today, but I would not stretch forth my
[53:32] hand against the Lord's anointed." So he
[53:35] knew when the appointed time was. Amen.
[53:39] You ready for God's timing. That's why
[53:41] God has given us this word and we know
[53:44] the prophet has said certain things will
[53:46] happen when at the opening of the word.
[53:48] What will happen? How does the bride
[53:50] will come into this divine nature and
[53:52] come into a certain position and and how
[53:54] she will be able to do the greater
[53:56] works? But there had to be a molding.
[53:59] There had to be a chastising. Amen. We
[54:02] can't just come just receive something
[54:03] haphazardly. No, you had to go to
[54:05] truthship. You're not going to be come
[54:07] and doing the greater works without
[54:09] coming to adoption. He's going to
[54:10] entrust you. To entrust you with power,
[54:13] he had to bring you into character.
[54:15] Amen. He had to make you fit to rule.
[54:18] Amen. Amen. So, I believe that God has
[54:20] been dealing with us. I know there's
[54:21] there's too much we can, Pastor Eden,
[54:23] there's a lot we can speak on the
[54:24] subject and it just goes more and more
[54:27] and I have a lot here, but I don't want
[54:29] to get too much into it, but you can see
[54:32] it's packed. It's power packed and uh
[54:34] but what God is doing right now, it's a
[54:38] hour where God has been molding us
[54:40] through the years.
[54:42] He was forming us into his image, into
[54:44] this Christlike image. Amen. through the
[54:47] preaching of the word. Faith cometh by
[54:50] hearing and hearing of the word. So if
[54:53] you want to experience the things of
[54:54] God, you got to eat of the word. Amen.
[54:57] There's two things that are important.
[54:59] Prayer and the word. Amen. Prayer and
[55:02] eating of the word. To be spiritually
[55:05] strengthened to recognize that there is
[55:07] a spirit man that's growing. Amen. The
[55:10] spirit man depends on prayer and on the
[55:13] word. So you find that God has been
[55:16] dealing with us not like the people of
[55:19] the world but as his sons because we are
[55:21] not from this civilization. We are from
[55:24] a faith civilization through Jesus
[55:26] Christ. Amen. The firstborn of this new
[55:29] creation.
[55:31] Amen. By him and through him were all
[55:34] things created. Even this faith
[55:36] civilization come by him and through
[55:40] him. Amen. out of Christ, outside of
[55:42] Christ, there was no faith civilization.
[55:45] It comes through Christ. Amen. So by him
[55:48] and through him were all things created.
[55:50] So he's been molding us. The Holy Spirit
[55:52] has been dealing with us. You got to
[55:54] catch the spirit of the composure. If
[55:57] he's doing this, he's showing you that
[55:59] he's building your character for a
[56:00] reason because he's going to release a
[56:02] power upon the church. Amen. He wants to
[56:05] release a power. Amen. And he cannot do
[56:08] that
[56:10] to everybody
[56:12] just like that. You've got to come
[56:15] through the tutors. Amen. And the tutors
[56:18] are the Holy Ghost working through the
[56:19] five-fold ministry, giving you the word
[56:22] to bring you up, to mold you, to shape
[56:25] you. Amen. To bring you into a position,
[56:29] into the position that you're supposed
[56:30] to be in. I can't be in your position.
[56:33] You cannot be in my position. Amen. If
[56:36] you was meant to be a housewife, that is
[56:38] your position. Be the best housewife
[56:41] that you can be. Be the example like
[56:43] that lady who had a husband that was an
[56:46] unbeliever. He was a drunkard.
[56:49] He had friends who were alcoholics.
[56:53] And one day when they were
[56:56] talking about that they couldn't find a
[56:58] Christian woman, a true sorry, a true
[57:01] Christian. Anyway,
[57:03] then it came then he started coming to
[57:05] himself like the prodical son. He came
[57:08] to himself. Now he's coming to a
[57:10] realization of what he really had. He
[57:13] came to the realization that he had the
[57:15] pearl of great price. Amen.
[57:18] Amen. He had his pearl of great price.
[57:23] But he treated it anyhow. But when he
[57:26] came to the realization, he told his
[57:27] friends, I know a true Christian and I
[57:31] will show you today a true Christian,
[57:35] a person of true character. Amen. And
[57:38] believe me, brother and sister, she
[57:40] possessed the power. She possessed an
[57:42] anointing
[57:44] because she could create an atmosphere.
[57:47] Amen. when he went there with his
[57:49] friends, a character that was already
[57:53] molded through her sufferings, through
[57:55] her trials
[57:59] through that character, through the
[58:00] years that she was being molded into
[58:01] this character when those friends came
[58:04] there and it began to become worse. The
[58:06] trials began to become more worse.
[58:10] Amen. The situation was so intense and
[58:13] so bad. But yet because the character
[58:16] was molded through patience. I mean she
[58:18] she she she she molded patients through
[58:20] the years and she molded his divine
[58:23] nature. She created such an atmosphere
[58:26] that anointing swept through the room
[58:29] and they began to realize that there's a
[58:31] true Christian and he himself began to
[58:34] see the worth of his wife that he had in
[58:37] his house the pearl of great price and
[58:40] that's the anointing that you and I
[58:41] possess that the world will see that
[58:44] through you and I. God bless you.
[58:47] [Applause]
