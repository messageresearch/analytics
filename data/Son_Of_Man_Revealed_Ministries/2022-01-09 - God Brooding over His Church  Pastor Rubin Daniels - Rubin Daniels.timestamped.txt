[12:09] seed
[12:15] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[12:18] amen
[12:19] so the way god deals with the earth in
[12:22] the beginning that's the way god deals
[12:24] with the individual amen amen your life
[12:27] and my life amen we came into this world
[12:30] speaking lies we came into this world
[12:33] born in sun and shaped in iniquity amen
[12:36] covered with darkness without shed
[12:38] without form and we were void
[12:41] amen and and i just want to type it this
[12:44] morning for
[12:45] what happened in the beginning amen
[12:48] our first quotation in the smyrna church
[12:51] h
[12:52] allow me to read i believe this church
[12:54] loves the message of the old man
[12:57] amen amen
[13:05] the smell of hallelujah age the prophet
[13:06] says
[13:08] now then there we are coming to a
[13:11] conclusion
[13:12] as the eternal logos which is god amen
[13:17] was manifest in the sun and in jesus
[13:21] dwell all the fullness of the goddess
[13:25] amen
[13:26] and that eternal one was the father
[13:29] manifested in flesh
[13:32] and thereby gain the title of sun
[13:37] even so we
[13:39] eternal in his thoughts
[13:41] in our turn became the many members
[13:45] spoken word seed manifest in flesh
[13:50] and those eternal thoughts now
[13:52] manifested in flesh are the sons of god
[13:56] amen even as we are so called we did not
[14:00] become seed by the rebirth yes
[14:04] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[14:08] for only the elect can be reborn amen
[14:13] because we were see in the
[14:16] is the reason we could be quickened amen
[14:20] none see
[14:21] there is nothing to quicken
[14:26] this is the principle of god yes
[14:29] if we understand that we were we will
[14:31] see the continuity
[14:33] amen in the beginning when god saw amen
[14:37] that the earth even was without form and
[14:40] void
[14:41] he could have gone to mars he could have
[14:43] gone to any other planet that was around
[14:46] amen but his choice and focus was on
[14:49] earth you know why the prophet also
[14:52] teaches us amen that the earth is a
[14:54] piece of the sun amen he says the earth
[14:56] broke off from the sun many many many
[14:59] years ago amen and spending amen brother
[15:02] sister in a direction and cooling off
[15:06] amen you and i apart and attribute amen
[15:10] of the son of god
[15:12] of god himself amen breaking our way man
[15:16] and cooling off someone coming into this
[15:19] world even covered with darkness amen we
[15:22] needed
[15:23] someone to move
[15:27] blessed be the name of the law
[15:30] the earth was without form
[15:33] the word was a wilderness
[15:36] a place of chaos
[15:38] a place of confusion
[15:40] a place of nothingness
[15:43] church of the living god as much as we
[15:45] think amen so much about ourselves and
[15:47] the world think so much about themselves
[15:50] this is what we were when we came to the
[15:52] world and some of us are still in that
[15:54] condition and not realizing that they're
[15:57] nothing outside of god amen amen have a
[16:00] great respect for those amen that are
[16:03] caries of the jumped seed of life amen
[16:06] brother sister you are a manifestation
[16:09] amen you are born of his bone and you
[16:12] are flesh of his flesh hallelujah we
[16:15] come from god and we are going back to
[16:17] god that makes you and i differently
[16:30] amen now the earth is a type of us
[16:34] problem says god does not do things
[16:38] without a reason
[16:40] hallelujah and god doesn't change his
[16:43] mind we told the church last week when
[16:45] god amen gave uh moses when the the the
[16:49] blue crunch yes amen of the tabernacle
[16:53] or or the ark it was called the ark
[16:57] in the beginning amen and and this is so
[16:59] many cubits and this is so many cubers
[17:02] amen there's an and then out of god
[17:04] should be there amen and then an inner
[17:07] court and then the most holy place
[17:09] and that pattern god followed amen
[17:12] throughout amen the word because three
[17:16] amen is god's number amen there's the
[17:18] number that god moves in a solomon comes

[17:42] purpose for everything amen we have to
[17:45] thank god for that does he know him

[36:41] are called spoken word children
[36:44] hallelujah by the word of god yes amen
[36:49] we were spoken
[36:51] in the beginning where the
[36:53] land comes from

[37:04] that's where you come from amen
[37:06] hallelujah we come from the same place
[37:09] where the lamb comes from amen because
[37:11] we were a part of him as the prophet
[37:13] said in the beginning he says amen our
[37:15] rebirth did not make us sin
[37:18] and let me tell you the message did not
[37:20] make us see amen
[37:22] but we came into this world amen the
[37:24] seed was there yes amen
[37:27] you just needed amen hallelujah the egg
[37:30] doesn't matter amen
[37:32] amen
[37:34] or a mouse is born in the garage and
[37:36] then it becomes a car
[37:38] no the seed was already there a mouse it
[37:41] was in the mouth it will be yes
[37:44] came into this world let's see carriers
[37:46] of that life inside of us what we needed
[37:49] amen was this message what we needed was
[37:52] the light it meant to struck the seed to
[37:55] bring forth what is in us
[37:57] and you think this morning that is a
[37:59] hard statement yes there are people with
[38:02] no seed in them
[38:03] they can sit in the presence of god and
[38:06] in the house of the lord amen no
[38:08] dramatizing if it will never ever ever
[38:10] ever take place

[38:16] there's nothing in there yes
[38:19] can you find them tomorrow they would
[38:21] just visit us in and out and some of
[38:23] them gave us hard time and we give we
[38:25] concentrate so much should have given so
[38:27] much attention only to find out they're
[38:29] not even one of us
[38:33] but we treat everybody as if they are we
[38:35] will go out there and preach this
[38:37] message to everyone amen as if they are
[38:40] because we don't know who's seed and
[38:41] who's here amen
[38:43] hallelujah we will only identify you by
[38:45] your response to the message remember
[38:48] you respond to the word for the hour
[38:50] amen something inside of you says amen
[38:53] something inside of you say the world

[39:08] happen on the earth without christ
[39:11] moving yeah
[39:13] amen
[39:14] but all that spirit moving on the waters
[39:17] nothing could happen
[39:19] it had there had to be a movement
[39:23] and that movement was orderly that's the
[39:26] god that we serve amen and nothing will
[39:28] happen to you unless god moves amen and
[39:32] god if you're a seal of god
[39:34] you move once
[39:36] you might deny reject and turn your back
[39:40] but because you just see the moves again

[39:46] times amen because you'll receive
[39:48] finally amen you will come amen
[39:51] hallelujah

[39:58] never
[39:59] never return yeah you'll never move
[40:01] again

[40:14] number two is
[40:16] yeah and what does it take to make the
[40:19] christian life
[40:21] now i want you to notice in the
[40:23] beginning when god our father looked
[40:25] over this bleak earth
[40:28] and it wasn't nothing but one great big
[40:31] ball of water
[40:33] and god sent the holy spirit to the
[40:36] earth
[40:37] that logos
[40:39] that went out of god and he began to
[40:42] brood over the earth amen now the word
[40:46] brood means to make love
[40:50] hallelujah
[40:52] god brewed over you
[40:54] amen the first thing you experience
[40:56] what's the love of god
[40:59] you change the violence sinner
[41:01] and you look at your mistakes you look
[41:03] at your fault he says there's no hope
[41:05] for me and god comes around and he says
[41:07] i love you my child hallelujah amen he
[41:10] tells you amen that's what i died for
[41:13] thank you i paid the ultimate price for
[41:15] your forgiveness and you sense amen
[41:18] there's a love amen and the brother you
[41:20] could not withstand and you have to just
[41:23] agree and accept and follow jesus christ
[41:27] oh just like the dove you cool
[41:30] and the great holy spirit over the earth
[41:33] as a mental picture
[41:35] we're going to make it uh
[41:38] like wings
[41:39] with his great wings around the earth a
[41:42] brooding making love cooing come on come
[41:47] the father has ordained you come i'm
[41:50] coming to perform what the father's word
[41:53] is said
[41:55] is he talking in i have come to manifest
[41:58] what the father has spoken amen
[42:02] that's why i read luke chapter
[42:04] luke 15
[42:07] when a prodigal son left home
[42:09] yes
[42:11] and he went to spend all he had
[42:13] he got involved in the world and he was
[42:16] covered in complete darkness
[42:20] but you see that did not make him less a
[42:22] son yes oh yes
[42:25] yes where we were before we met the lord
[42:28] jesus christ amen my sons
[42:31] covered with complete darkness yes
[42:34] some worse than others
[42:36] but brother sister when the word of god
[42:38] came and the spirit moved amen in our
[42:41] little uh uh
[42:44] where we were amen we decided we
[42:48] some of us did not even by
[42:50] through a pastor or anybody something in
[42:53] our hearts this is not where i belong
[42:57] something tells us amen we have a home
[42:59] somewhere amen something tells us amen
[43:02] we have a father somewhere
[43:04] amen i'm going to stand up and i'm going
[43:06] to tell father father i i i've sinned
[43:09] before thee and i've sinned before
[43:11] heaven and i'm not worthy to be called
[43:13] your son
[43:14] make me one of your servants and and
[43:17] reverend says it's impossible for the
[43:19] son to become a servant

[43:25] son is father's blood running in your
[43:27] veins doesn't matter what you've done i
[43:29] want to tell you this morning church it

[44:16] provision amen
[44:19] spoke to a woman and explained to her
[44:21] what happened amen in palestinia
[44:24] palestinian
[44:25] he says amen when a man invites you for

[45:44] welcomes you and he says amen that is
[45:47] exactly a mental pattern and he allows
[45:50] the pastor to wash you
[45:51] amen he come down himself and he becomes
[45:54] the footwork flanking the longest job

[52:06] of the sun

[52:26] hallelujah
[52:28] now we find out i believe as we study
[52:31] now and then
[52:32] and this light the earth was without
[52:35] form
[52:36] some people argue today in our schools
[52:39] and so forth about the world being the
[52:41] world being so many million years old
[52:44] and trying to condemn the bible and say
[52:47] it's wrong
[52:48] they just don't and never read the bible
[52:52] that's all because the bible don't tell
[52:54] us how old the world is the bible said
[52:57] in the beginning god we hated the
[53:00] heavens and the earth period
[53:02] and well how that we don't know
[53:05] now that's the first and that is period
[53:10] that's the end of the sentence in the
[53:12] beginning god created the heavens and
[53:14] the earth
[53:16] it might have been a hundred million
[53:18] billions of years
[53:20] or whether it was
[53:21] and
[53:22] whatever it was and how he done it
[53:25] that's up to him
[53:27] to know see not to me amen but the world
[53:31] well the earth was without form and void
[53:34] and the waters was upon the earth and
[53:37] god said it moved he moved upon the
[53:41] waters
[53:42] and said let there be light
[53:45] now i believe that the sun and so forth
[53:48] was already in existence
[53:50] i believe the moon as it goes on genesis
[53:54] chapter 3 to explain it but i believe
[53:56] what was here
[53:58] that the world we was going to use and
[54:02] and and it moved in there was form and
[54:06] mess all over the earth making it dark
[54:11] and god says let there be light
[54:14] and the darkness faded away amen and
[54:17] there was a cloudless sky
[54:22] man amen the powerful word of almighty
[54:25] god around the sky hallelujah
[54:29] there's only one thing that can get rid
[54:31] of the darkness in our lives
[54:33] that is the word for our day yes amen
[54:37] you thank god for
[54:39] the form and the letter reign that god
[54:41] has said amen the former rain is there

[54:58] tell you without the teaching reign amen

[55:07] the former ray brothers says that gives
[55:09] you that faith he says where does the
[55:11] rapture in faith lies he says he lies in
[55:13] the spoken word he said these seven
[55:15] thunders will give you rapturing whereas
[55:18] the fate lies amen the former reign the

[55:37] former raven tell them amen hallelujah
[55:40] it's not just a denominational amen pool

[55:47] weighs them and we go out there we tell
[55:50] them brother sister amen there is a god

[56:02] over the person's life what is this man
[56:04] talking about amen something breaks him
[56:07] on the inside hallelujah amen and he
[56:10] exposes himself to the message and he
[56:12] reads message after message even he gets
[56:15] the teachings and creates the faith in
[56:17] him hallelujah

[57:59] fourth quotation here quickly
[58:01] and i believe that god's way of doing
[58:03] things in the bible the next verse says
[58:06] the fourth verse and he prepared the
[58:09] light for he he separated the light from
[58:12] the darkness
[58:13] and the light he called day and the
[58:15] darkness he called night
[58:17] and god's word always separates light
[58:20] from darkness it's the word that does
[58:24] the separation see
[58:27] it's the word that does the separation
[58:30] amen
[58:31] amen man has got a tendency to influence
[58:33] people and say no that is the work of
[58:36] the enemy the complete separation from
[58:39] between light and darkness must be the
[58:42] word of god
[58:43] if the word draws you the word will keep
[58:45] amen amen i think one of the brothers
[58:48] prayed this morning lord we thank you
[58:50] that our meeting plays amen it's not in
[58:53] another country or meeting places in the
[58:55] world

[58:58] and homeland but ours is in the word of
[59:01] god
[59:03] amen
[59:04] god ever does
[59:06] god ever does the same thing when he
[59:09] gets ready to use anything
[59:11] like he got ready to use this old style
[59:14] or whatever it was this world he had to
[59:18] separate the light from darkness when he
[59:21] gets ready to leave to use a group of
[59:24] people he has to separate the light from
[59:27] darkness when he gets ready to use an
[59:30] individual he he separates the light
[59:33] from darkness amen
[59:35] yes sir separation comes
[59:38] god wants to use an individual
[59:41] use a church
[59:42] he has to bring separation
[59:44] to darkness hallelujah
[59:48] light comes by god remember the light
[59:51] come by the spoken word the word of god
[59:54] said let there be light when there was
[59:56] no light and he sent the light to
[59:58] separate the darkness amen from the
[1:00:01] light
[1:00:03] the word of command
[1:00:08] cleared the sky
[1:00:10] so the sun could shine in
[1:00:12] and his word today
[1:00:14] is that the one that clears back all
[1:00:18] amen of the atmosphere of unbelief
[1:00:22] i believe his darkness yes amen and we
[1:00:25] pray this morning that god will just

[1:00:42] one thing that can get rid of darkness
[1:00:44] in our life that is the word for our day
[1:00:48] yes not yesterday's world
[1:00:51] when god wants to use anything or
[1:00:54] anybody he has to bring a separation
[1:00:58] from darkness amen

[1:01:05] prophet the new birth

[1:04:39] when god move upon the water with the
[1:04:42] light
[1:04:42] and light brought forth the first
[1:04:46] presence of god
[1:04:48] spoken light came by god's spoken word
[1:04:52] and god's word is the only thing that
[1:04:55] still brings a light and when the waters
[1:04:58] went back
[1:05:00] the seed was already in the earth and
[1:05:03] the light only brought forth the seeds
[1:05:06] that remained with germ in them

[1:05:54] him
