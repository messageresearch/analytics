[0:00] foreign
[0:01] amen
[0:03] she couldn't wait to come to church
[0:04] today amen but we pray the Lord will
[0:07] continue to be with us he's kept her for
[0:08] one year thus far amen by his grace he's
[0:11] kept her in good health amen we pray the
[0:13] Lord will continue to be with us amen
[0:15] amen and even as she grows in the ways
[0:17] of the Lord
[0:18] amen and also bless
[0:21] Karen amen who's taking care of the baby
[0:26] amen
[0:28] you don't know what it's like to take
[0:29] care of a newborn bring them up until
[0:31] one amen
[0:33] to Sarah's Gonna Learn
[0:35] amen Hallelujah it gets really acted
[0:39] from others but we thank God that he's
[0:42] given them a nature to be able to yes
[0:44] endure and take care of them amen
[0:46] hallelujah so motherhood is also an
[0:48] attribute of God the nurture remember
[0:52] God says like a and I gathered you under
[0:55] my wings amen talking to Israel then
[0:58] amen so let's start our scripture
[1:01] praise the Lord amen
[1:08] let's turn to Luke Chapter 2 and verse
[1:10] 26.
[1:14] Luke Chapter 2 and verse 26 says
[1:18] behold there was a man in Jerusalem
[1:20] whose name was Simeon
[1:23] the same man was just and devout waiting
[1:26] for the consolation of Israel and the
[1:28] Holy Ghost was upon him
[1:31] and it was revealed unto him by the Holy
[1:33] Ghost
[1:34] that he would not see death until he had
[1:37] seen Lord's Christ amen amen may the
[1:41] Lord blessings to the reading of his
[1:43] word you may be seated
[1:45] amen
[1:49] so it must have been something for
[1:51] Simeon
[1:53] being an old man
[1:54] to wake up every morning
[1:58] amen and go to the temple
[2:01] with the expectation
[2:03] that he was going to see the Lord's
[2:05] Christ
[2:07] something was revealed to him personally
[2:10] yes
[2:11] now if you go and do a study in the
[2:13] scripture you won't find a prophecy
[2:15] about this
[2:18] that Simeon would stand there and see
[2:20] the child
[2:22] it's personally revealed to him by the
[2:25] Holy Spirit
[2:26] and he is diligent to Akin unto the
[2:29] voice of the Holy Spirit now remember
[2:31] this was before the Holy Spirit was even
[2:34] released to the church but this man was
[2:37] so devout the Bible called him a just
[2:38] man a devout man he didn't Matthew his
[2:42] age he was found in the house of the
[2:44] Lord waiting for the promise that he
[2:46] would see the Lord's Christ amen amen
[2:49] and no matter how old he got they told
[2:52] him your days are drawing near Simeon
[2:53] why don't you rather stay home and we'll
[2:55] cook you a good meal he says no I have a
[2:58] confirmation in my heart that the Holy
[3:00] Spirit has spoken to me amen so
[3:05] I want to say that you and I like Simeon
[3:10] and we need to see the Lord's Christ in
[3:12] our lives
[3:15] amen
[3:17] so every day we ought to be looking
[3:18] forward to the manifestation
[3:20] of the Life of Christ in US
[3:23] amen we ought to be waiting with
[3:26] anticipation that daily we are growing
[3:28] into the stature and the image of Jesus
[3:31] Christ
[3:32] amen
[3:33] so here we find that he never wave it at
[3:37] the promise
[3:38] now the same promise was given to Elisha
[3:41] when he asked for a double portion
[3:43] anointing
[3:44] for the Caleb can I get a HDMI cable and
[3:47] I can project from you amen he was
[3:51] told that if you see me go
[3:55] in that chariot
[3:58] you shall receive a double portion
[4:00] anointing
[4:03] amen was that what he was told if you
[4:06] see me go
[4:07] so what was his job to do to keep his
[4:10] eyes fixed on the prophet
[4:15] he couldn't be distracted
[4:17] he couldn't look to the left nor could
[4:19] he look to the right he couldn't worry
[4:21] about the school of the prophets and
[4:23] what they were saying amen there were
[4:25] many voices in the land trying to
[4:27] distract Elisha
[4:30] but he had to keep his eyes on Elijah
[4:33] amen amen amen because if we had failed
[4:36] to do that he would not have received
[4:38] the Rope when it fell
[4:41] yes amen so
[4:44] if we go to Isaiah chapter 7 here you'll
[4:47] see that God prophesies things before it
[4:51] happens and there's got to be a people
[4:53] that are ready on the earth waiting to
[4:56] catch that prophecy and fulfill their
[4:58] part of the word
[4:59] and they are predestinated people not
[5:02] just anybody can grab a hold of the
[5:04] scripture and say that's my scripture
[5:06] yes amen amen if they are doing it they
[5:09] impersonate us
[5:11] amen but there is a specific group and
[5:14] there was only one woman that could say
[5:16] Isaiah 7 14 was her
[5:21] so look at this hundreds of years before
[5:23] Mary is even born
[5:25] the Bible says therefore the Lord
[5:28] himself shall give you a sign
[5:34] he's got Simeon there already waiting at
[5:36] the temple
[5:38] predestinated to wait there amen but
[5:41] here is prophesying of this child that
[5:43] Simeon is going to see yeah I'm gonna
[5:45] give you a sign the holy virgin shall
[5:48] conceive
[5:49] amen
[5:51] not an adulterous woman she's got to be
[5:53] clean living she's a virgin to the word
[5:56] amen the only virgin shall conceive and
[6:00] bear a son and shall call his name
[6:02] Emmanuel
[6:04] amen
[6:06] that there was only one woman who could
[6:08] meet the prophecy
[6:12] amen it wasn't going to be a 89 year old
[6:16] Sarah
[6:17] it wasn't going to be an 88 year old
[6:19] Elizabeth but it was going to be a young
[6:21] virgin girl amen amen God was not going
[6:25] to change all women and make a young
[6:27] again for this part of the prophecy amen
[6:30] she had to be a young virgin to the word
[6:34] amen amen so the Lord here is talking
[6:38] here and then you find also we're going
[6:40] to see
[6:41] in a Zion nine it says For unto us a
[6:44] child is born unto us a son is given and
[6:47] the government shall be upon his
[6:48] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[6:50] wonderful counselor shall be called The
[6:54] Mighty God Everlasting father the Prince
[6:56] of Peace
[6:59] now who is this prophesying
[7:02] it's God speaking through the mouth of
[7:04] the Prophet that is going to come forth
[7:06] a woman they're going to come to what
[7:08] they say there's going to come forth a
[7:10] man on the Earth
[7:13] amen so for hundreds of years the script
[7:16] that the prophecy lay there
[7:18] just like how for thousands of years
[7:21] Revelation 19 later that amen the
[7:24] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[7:26] wife had made herself ready amen and
[7:29] that scripture laid their dormant for
[7:31] thousands of years
[7:32] amen hallelujah messenger out to
[7:35] messenger after messenger came but none
[7:37] of them touched that scripture
[7:40] amen no church could touch that
[7:42] scripture amen because it was waiting
[7:45] there for a specific group of people
[7:46] that was going to come to anoint that
[7:48] word
[7:51] amen hallelujah
[7:56] so we gotta find amen talking about the
[7:58] sun coming talking about the Life of
[8:00] Christ amen yeah now brother bran will
[8:02] talk about we were talking about Mary a
[8:04] bit on on Sunday and I just want to pick
[8:06] up from where we left off because we
[8:08] didn't get to read all of it he says
[8:10] that this type of woman now this type of
[8:12] church will have a virgin whom
[8:15] amen meaning that we won't have
[8:17] denominational seat come in there
[8:20] that we've got to get it out
[8:23] amen if you've got denominational ideas
[8:25] we've got to get it out
[8:28] he says what would she come out of a
[8:30] virgin whom the word
[8:32] what did Jesus come out of a virgin whom
[8:34] so like Jesus came out of your virgin
[8:36] room this bride will have to come out of
[8:38] a virgin whom amen which is the word
[8:40] right amen and he says then if God ever
[8:43] does anything in the church it'll be
[8:45] original back in the word again life is
[8:48] in the tree and it Bears its own kind
[8:49] amen
[8:51] Jesus wants fruit for himself
[8:54] his wife must bring forth the kind of
[8:57] children that he is bright children were
[9:00] children that's in the Rapture message
[9:02] now one of the last messages he preaches
[9:05] before he leaves the scene
[9:07] showing you now that Jesus has a wife
[9:14] and he's looking for her to reproduce
[9:16] The Life of Christ
[9:18] amen now and I ask you that faith is a
[9:21] substance of things hoped for right and
[9:23] I told you that this here the raw
[9:25] material that was used for this was with
[9:30] but what was the raw material used to
[9:33] make the worlds to make the heavens
[9:36] the raw material used was the spoken
[9:39] word
[9:41] amen the heavens and the Earth are
[9:44] established by the spoken word amen yes
[9:46] so if God ever reproduces himself again
[9:49] amen
[9:51] amen they must be of that same caliber
[9:55] yes amen because the spoken word is the
[9:58] Original Seed amen and if that tree ever
[10:00] puts forth another Branch again
[10:03] it's gonna be like divine
[10:07] by the power of the spoken word that's
[10:09] why brother Branham is preaching the
[10:11] spoken word is the original scene
[10:15] amen
[10:18] now we don't realize how powerful our
[10:20] words are
[10:22] amen I don't think that some of us have
[10:25] really caught what we are saying
[10:30] and then we are spending years and years
[10:31] and years and years in the message and
[10:33] not growing and not developing and
[10:35] seeing no life in us no fruitiness no
[10:38] manifestation in us and we claim to be
[10:40] the bride of Christ
[10:42] amen
[10:43] we have a false pregnancy
[10:46] claiming we are carrying the Life of
[10:48] Christ but never producing
[10:51] amen always telling people the doctor
[10:53] got the date wrong
[10:57] amen
[11:00] I think the doctor messed it up
[11:04] Hallelujah
[11:06] but Jesus wants fruit for himself
[11:12] amen let's do introspection let's see
[11:15] how we're producing The Life of Christ
[11:18] oh what what good it would be to spend
[11:21] 70 years of Our Lives serving the lord
[11:24] in the message of the hour never
[11:26] producing his life when he comes again
[11:27] he can't be United with you and then you
[11:30] are accustomed to all the darkness
[11:33] amen we must produce the Life of Christ
[11:36] and he's given us everything that we
[11:38] need to produce the Life of Christ the
[11:40] problem is the application the problem
[11:42] is that we don't want to take it
[11:46] amen hallelujah amen
[11:50] he says the people are afraid of the new
[11:52] birth
[11:55] they are so accustomed to the whole
[11:56] birth the old nature they're afraid of a
[11:59] new birth
[12:00] amen that's what's the matter they are
[12:03] afraid to be born again
[12:05] anybody knows that a birth I don't care
[12:07] where it is it is a mess
[12:10] if it's in a pig pen if it's in a straw
[12:12] stack or if it's in a pink decorated
[12:14] hospital room a birth is a mess even if
[12:17] it's in a messy Church
[12:20] amen
[12:23] hallelujah oh Church come on you ask
[12:26] yourself be serious now when last did
[12:29] you see her a messy butt in the message
[12:30] of the hour
[12:34] everybody is so Pious and so
[12:37] can't lose control and let the Holy
[12:40] Ghost flow
[12:41] so polished up so dignified yeah
[12:45] amen
[12:47] thinking that we have private hospitals
[12:49] to bring forth the Life of Christ let me
[12:52] tell you even in a private hospital that
[12:54] birth is messy there's blood everywhere
[12:59] amen so something is wrong if we are
[13:02] saying we are producing The Life of
[13:03] Christ
[13:05] and I think sometimes there's too many
[13:07] C-sections
[13:09] being performed
[13:11] you need to push we need to Perth you
[13:16] need to feel those blood pains you need
[13:18] to know that the Life of Christ is
[13:19] within you and push forth burst forth
[13:23] what what did the doctors tell the women
[13:25] work with the contractions those
[13:27] contractions are there to tell you when
[13:29] to push
[13:31] amen as long as you think those
[13:33] contractions are there amen and it's
[13:35] bringing you pain and you're hopeless
[13:37] and you're saying help me nobody say
[13:39] shut up
[13:40] and push with the contraction
[13:44] amen hallelujah
[13:48] people don't want to get messy he said
[13:50] but I'm telling you I don't want to meet
[13:52] God on my part
[13:54] how many of us want to meet God in our
[13:55] own righteousness
[13:57] let me tell you you won't even get a
[13:59] million feet in front of him
[14:02] you'll be consumed that's right
[14:05] on your own righteousness
[14:07] I don't want to meet the new birth on
[14:09] God I want to meet the new birth on
[14:11] God's level
[14:12] I don't care if I have to cry Squall
[14:15] speak in tongues whatever I have to do I
[14:18] don't care how many neighbors talk about
[14:20] me let me be born again amen
[14:24] I don't care what kind of condition
[14:26] might
[14:27] amen if I have to spoil all my
[14:30] reputation I don't have any anyhow
[14:33] that's one thing I didn't leave I have
[14:35] no Prestige or reputation
[14:40] I don't care what it is I'm ready to
[14:42] lose anything I don't know if you feel
[14:44] that way I'm ready to lose anything and
[14:46] become a fool for the kingdom of God's
[14:49] sake amen amen hallelujah
[14:53] I bet you off your friends don't know
[14:55] that you're Christian I bet you half
[14:57] your friends don't know you follow the
[14:58] message of the hour I bet you half your
[15:01] friends don't never heard about what God
[15:03] is doing in the end time I bet you off
[15:05] your friends don't know amen that God
[15:07] has sent us a mighty prophet in the last
[15:10] days to turn our hearts back to the
[15:12] faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[15:16] amen
[15:18] you know time is has passed so quickly
[15:20] brother Joshua that do you know the
[15:22] generation that we evangelize Phoenix
[15:24] for is already gone there's another
[15:25] generation maybe even two generations
[15:27] that still need evangelism amen
[15:32] in all that work we did there was a past
[15:34] generation there's a whole new
[15:36] generation grown up
[15:39] that haven't heard the message of the
[15:41] hour
[15:42] that I haven't heard the presently true
[15:43] yes
[15:45] we are just conscious thinking oh well
[15:47] we did all of that back years ago but
[15:48] think about the time span that has left
[15:52] let me tell you the generation that
[15:54] rejected the prophet he's gone old
[15:57] there's a whole new generation now that
[15:59] never heard about the name William
[16:00] Branham they've never heard that God
[16:03] sent a Prophets to turn our hearts back
[16:05] to the faith amen and let me tell you
[16:08] something the prophet I don't have to
[16:09] quote you but he says when you
[16:11] evangelize you since you get them before
[16:13] they are 25 years old he says once they
[16:15] turn 25 they become set in their ways
[16:18] hmm
[16:20] why do you think all of these people all
[16:22] political parties that are going for the
[16:24] Youth yes
[16:25] amen why do you think vgr is only going
[16:28] for the Youth
[16:32] amen amen they know if they get the
[16:34] youth they got the Next Generation
[16:37] amen hallelujah
[16:43] now what are we talking about that life
[16:45] the one that is prophesied in in Isaiah
[16:48] that the sun was coming amen the one
[16:51] that told Simeon the sun is coming the
[16:53] one that came to tell Mary you're going
[16:55] to conceive and bring the son amen amen
[16:59] now that was the natural Sun
[17:01] but he came so that he can bring forth
[17:04] his life in you yes right the woman that
[17:07] you are
[17:08] he wants to sow his word in you and
[17:10] bring forth his life in you now he says
[17:12] I don't care what they say I want Jesus
[17:15] that's how many objective on what level
[17:18] it is I don't care I want to meet him on
[17:21] his level not under what I think is
[17:23] right or what somebody says I want on
[17:25] What God Says is right that's what if
[17:28] he's if he said he's the same yesterday
[17:29] today and forever I want to see him on
[17:32] that level
[17:35] amen
[17:36] and yeah he goes on to say I if I have
[17:39] to preach a bunch of posts and eats all
[17:41] the crackers and drink Branch water I
[17:44] still want the gospel I want Christ on
[17:46] the level that Christ would come
[17:48] amen amen amen hallelujah
[17:52] and if you know that this message is not
[17:54] a watered-down gospel yes the standard
[17:57] of this message is absolutely His Eye Is
[17:59] Heaven because this is a message that
[18:01] has come down from heaven if you can
[18:04] live in the message of the hour I'm
[18:06] talking about really all he goes feel
[18:07] led in the message of the hour then you
[18:10] are foot to live in heaven
[18:11] [Music]
[18:13] yes because this message has come to
[18:15] prepare us to live in heaven
[18:17] if we can if we can obey the king's
[18:20] voice here on Earth
[18:22] then we can obey the king's voice in
[18:24] heaven
[18:24] [Music]
[18:27] thank you Jesus amen
[18:30] yeah he's talking about now we spoke a
[18:32] bit on this now he says now what will
[18:34] you do talking to Elijah he wants a
[18:37] double portion of your spirit to come
[18:38] upon me
[18:39] you know they had to walk to do a double
[18:41] portion not just a good warm experience
[18:44] not a good handshake good fellowship
[18:46] with the rest of the church but what I
[18:48] want is a double portion of what the
[18:50] best is
[18:51] I tell you what God says amen when God
[18:55] sets a man for a world task he has got
[18:59] to have something better than the world
[19:01] is God
[19:03] amen God didn't call you out of
[19:06] denomination he didn't tell you come out
[19:08] of there my people
[19:10] and lead you to nothingness
[19:12] he didn't call Abraham out of his land
[19:14] to lead him to nothingness he led him to
[19:18] a better life he led him to riches he
[19:20] let him amen hallelujah to meet
[19:22] Melchizedek
[19:24] so he's saying if he's calling you out
[19:25] of denomination he's calling you to
[19:27] something better yeah
[19:32] you should never think oh those people
[19:33] are operating in such a powerful
[19:35] anointing nonsense
[19:36] there's a more powerful anointing here
[19:39] oh thank you
[19:41] if you think they have worse amen
[19:43] Greater Works indeed shall you do
[19:45] Hallelujah yes amen amen if there ever
[19:49] was a time that a double portion is
[19:50] needed it's today in 2023 a double
[19:53] portion is needed and if you want the
[19:55] double portion amen it's today in the
[19:58] Realms of people something better
[20:00] something higher
[20:02] I think Beans and Cornbread is very good
[20:04] but sometimes I have to reach up a
[20:07] little higher
[20:09] materials is good but sometimes I have
[20:12] to reach a little higher the property
[20:14] saying amen you can't tell me eat
[20:16] vegetables all week
[20:18] the property is saying sometimes you've
[20:20] got to reach a little higher
[20:25] and now if you know that your
[20:26] expectation
[20:28] or that craving will drive you to get it
[20:32] you know a drunker
[20:35] he'll do anything to get his alcohol
[20:39] to meet that craving
[20:42] now if you're really craving for Christ
[20:44] what will you do
[20:46] if you're really craving for your spirit
[20:48] read a craving cream to work in your
[20:50] life
[20:51] amen what are you willing to sacrifice
[20:53] is amen what are you willing to
[20:55] sacrifice then
[21:00] he says I tell you when okay
[21:06] we do that we've got to we've got to
[21:07] keep climbing
[21:10] now here's where a very striking Point
[21:12] Israel was backsliding if it kept
[21:15] staying on the same ground
[21:22] cruising
[21:24] hmm
[21:27] we've been going in this one gear
[21:32] now you know why the condition of the
[21:33] church is where it is today
[21:35] he said they kept backsliding if they
[21:37] were staying on the same ground
[21:42] she has got to be moving on
[21:45] or moving back
[21:49] I tell you if you really look people
[21:52] have moved backwards
[21:56] people have really moved backwards
[21:58] and that's the way the church is and you
[22:01] know what they actually think they're
[22:02] fine
[22:06] they actually think they are fine
[22:08] just quoting quotes
[22:10] but no manifestation no life no evidence
[22:15] telling everybody that they are bringing
[22:18] forth the Life of Christ but like I'm
[22:19] telling you they are lying
[22:21] they're lying you've got two individual
[22:24] inspection they have no prayer life they
[22:26] don't read their Bible they don't even
[22:28] read the message of the hour

[22:38] said you've asked a great thing but
[22:40] nevertheless if you see me when I go you
[22:43] can have what you ask now that has to be
[22:45] singleness of motive singleness of heart

[22:50] the promise now if you're sick this
[22:52] morning if you're Afflicted there is one
[22:55] great promise not by Elijah but by God

[24:02] that built it around themselves
[24:07] right

[24:11] I'm talking about in the framework
[24:15] built it around themselves

[24:54] Father for I have sinned
[24:56] amen
[24:58] I'm telling you
[25:00] that the ministry is changing yes
[25:04] yes because we are in the final run and
[25:06] the people must make themselves ready
[25:10] and what he's trying to do now is to try
[25:12] to get our eyes off of man
[25:14] you appreciate the gifts because the
[25:16] year to Build You Up
[25:18] but you get your eye off of man and you

[25:31] almost okay I mustn't forget that amen
[25:43] there's a promise if thou can't believe
[25:45] all things are possible to them that
[25:46] believe sometimes I look at myself now
[25:49] he has a prophet
[25:51] and look what he's saying brother Ramesh
[25:53] I look at myself
[25:55] and I've been such a jellyfish in my
[25:57] life
[25:59] I've waited and missed thousands of
[26:01] souls into the kingdom because I've
[26:04] waited
[26:07] there's a man who went seven times
[26:09] around the world calling himself a
[26:11] jellyfish
[26:19] trying for him to come home
[26:21] and he thinks he hasn't done enough
[26:26] [Music]
[26:28] amen
[26:29] Have Thine Own Way Lord amen let's see
[26:33] have that no way
[26:36] Thou Art the Potter
[26:40] I Am the place
[26:45] oh me and she
[26:48] needs
[26:50] after thy will
[26:54] wild sky and waiting
[26:58] [Music]
[27:02] and still one more time Have Thine
[27:07] always
[27:10] [Music]
[27:18] Thou Art the Potter
[27:24] I am
[27:26] the clay
[27:30] [Music]
[27:33] shake me
[27:37] after
[27:38] thy wings
[27:47] [Music]
[27:50] healed it and still
[27:56] amen praise the Lord praise the Lord
[27:58] amen
[28:02] you know the Lord blessed us with new
[28:03] equipment
[28:05] if you notice that amen so we're just
[28:08] trying to be extra cautious now we
[28:11] handle them amen
[28:15] are we back on Amen and just tell me if
[28:18] it comes up here for the Caleb
[28:19] because every time he does that and I
[28:22] don't get it backed up back up okay
[28:27] so he has a man who went seven times
[28:29] around the world
[28:34] and he says Lord I've been a jellyfish
[28:36] I've waited Miss thousands of souls into
[28:39] the kingdom I've waited depended too
[28:42] much on it
[28:44] spiritual gift
[28:48] and said Lord if you will just show me
[28:50] and if you'll give me a vision what to
[28:52] do and God gives me a vision then I'll
[28:54] turn around and let somebody talk me
[28:56] into something else
[28:59] or I've never come to that spot yet
[29:01] until
[29:02] like I have at this time that I feel
[29:04] it's a faith that we must step out there
[29:08] because it's a promise
[29:10] and the things that he has done and the
[29:13] healings that he has performed and the
[29:14] Miracles in so much has come down and he
[29:16] had taken his picture by the side of us
[29:19] and so forth which has never been known
[29:21] since the world began
[29:24] and then stand around like a jellyfish
[29:27] it even makes me discouraged with myself
[29:29] it's time to keep your eye on the
[29:31] promise
[29:34] let me just continue with this
[29:37] so yeah the brother branham's wife tells
[29:39] him you need to pray for sister Wood's
[29:42] mother listen to what he says now
[29:44] on the road back my wife got all of me
[29:46] she said pray for Mrs Wood's mother I
[29:49] can't say as eating off her face I never
[29:51] since the word so alarm she's weeping
[29:53] since the word has been a hero of Faith
[29:56] since God healed a boy of a crippled leg
[29:58] and healed her with TB and so forth
[30:01] right they're at the room that night we
[30:03] prayed coming in Mrs wood said brother
[30:05] Branham we'll go over and we went to our
[30:08] mother which was in Louisville and she
[30:10] had cancer on the side of her nose and
[30:12] the doctors are tampered with it
[30:13] scattered it till it was just a little
[30:15] ring on the side of her nose
[30:17] and just about an eighth of an inch from
[30:20] my eye and just the bone laying there
[30:22] done eating it just as fast as he could
[30:24] eat in a way
[30:26] so yeah the prophet says he goes into
[30:28] the room and now Tom I want to speak to
[30:30] her alone and I go into the room to pray
[30:32] with the woman and while in the room I
[30:34] thought oh God if you just show me a
[30:36] vision of what's going to happen to the
[30:37] woman Mr and Mrs wood sitting on the
[30:40] outside waiting to see what the vision
[30:42] would say but while I was there I got
[30:44] condemned
[30:48] I was so condemned by waiting for a
[30:50] vision seemed like something referred
[30:53] back wasn't the calling what you need a
[30:56] vision when the promise is already been
[30:59] said amen amen yes amen
[31:04] do we need a vision to tell us that by
[31:07] the stripes of Jesus we will heal
[31:12] so what is brother Branham saying
[31:15] a gift a secondary the word is primary
[31:18] amen
[31:19] amen amen
[31:22] amen it's already written in the word
[31:24] the people were struggling in the 50s
[31:26] and 60s
[31:31] and it seems people are still struggling
[31:32] today
[31:34] if we don't realize the value of the
[31:36] words
[31:38] amen
[31:41] what you need a vision when the promise
[31:44] has already been said
[31:46] and that's why people ipn the court oh
[31:49] no we can't move because
[31:51] the prophet says we need that saith the
[31:52] Lord you already have that saith the
[31:54] Lord amen amen he says she has not saith
[31:58] the Lord or she keeps still now if we
[32:00] are saying
[32:00] say the Lord we can't keep still
[32:04] so I knelt down and prayed and while
[32:05] praying something just anchored inside
[32:08] on the inside the faith of the promise
[32:11] amen
[32:13] amen
[32:15] amen
[32:16] I come back out and Mrs word when I told
[32:19] her about it she said did you see
[32:21] anything brother Branham I said I never
[32:23] exactly seen anything but I felt
[32:25] something that told me that his promise
[32:27] was true and he was going to do it
[32:30] amen scriptural authority of the word of
[32:33] God
[32:36] and I believe that he's going to do it
[32:38] and in less than 24 hours the end of
[32:41] that cancer begin to break away and
[32:42] escape from over it cancers don't scare
[32:45] us you know unless it's dead so it was
[32:48] now and the woman is healed and home
[32:49] what a wonderful Christ by keeping our
[32:52] eyes on the promise God said so
[32:55] amen amen
[32:59] God said so but when we are prayed for
[33:02] sometimes we go off and say well it
[33:04] wasn't done just immediately
[33:06] so maybe we better go back again
[33:11] oh no keep your eye on the promise God
[33:14] said so that settles it amen that's all
[33:18] of it if God said so God is able to keep
[33:20] his promise or he would never make it
[33:22] how many times have you heard me say
[33:24] it's not our reputation at stake if God
[33:27] didn't want to heal us he shouldn't have
[33:29] wrote it in his Bible
[33:32] amen if he said land on the sick and
[33:35] they shall recover it's not my job to
[33:37] bring you to pass neither is it my
[33:39] reputation on the line
[33:41] the prophet of God says if I come here
[33:43] and I preach Divine Healing and I pray
[33:45] for people and I lay hands on them and
[33:47] they all die he says tomorrow you'll
[33:49] finally have to Pulpit preaching the
[33:50] same scripture on Divine Healing because
[33:52] it's not my word I didn't promise it
[33:54] it's God's word so he has to come up and
[33:56] back it up amen yes
[34:03] keep your eye on the promise that
[34:04] settles it that's all of it if God said
[34:07] so God is able to keep his promise or he
[34:09] would never make it yeah Abraham call
[34:11] those things which are not as though
[34:12] they were and for 25 years stood on the
[34:15] impossible because he counted God was
[34:18] able to perform what he had promised
[34:20] amen
[34:22] we are the children of Abraham by faith
[34:27] amen Hallelujah yeah he's talking about
[34:30] now
[34:31] on his trip to Africa
[34:33] here in South Africa he says there was a
[34:36] little baby that had club feet now this
[34:38] is how you prepare for the promise
[34:40] this is how you operate in faith
[34:42] one leg was shorter than the other it
[34:44] never wore shoes in its life
[34:48] horrible deformed I prayed for the baby
[34:50] that night and the next morning I went
[34:52] down by the shoe store I walked in there
[34:55] and there was a man buying the baby a
[34:57] pair of shoes he believed it
[35:03] like this man over here that believed
[35:05] that God would give him a baby sure he
[35:07] believed it was going to happen make
[35:08] ready for it I'm making ready all the no
[35:11] physical results seen as yet but that
[35:13] didn't make a bit of difference he
[35:15] believed it like Abraham and called
[35:18] anything contrary as though it was not
[35:22] if your mind if if your mind you say
[35:25] that that is the truth God is the Healer
[35:28] of sickness but there's not been a
[35:29] bearing ground in your heart Faith to
[35:31] fall in to express it it will not happen
[35:37] so I will tell you on Sunday always
[35:39] check when you are having faith
[35:42] is it still residing in your head
[35:44] are you troubled about it are you
[35:46] constantly worried about it or is it
[35:48] settled in your heart because this is
[35:50] where Faith Finds Its bending ground
[35:53] amen now
[35:55] the prophet tells us that God took his
[35:57] throne upon man's heart
[35:59] and Satan is where
[36:02] in the mind that's where the greatest
[36:03] battle is ever fought so never ever when
[36:06] the war is Raging in your mind
[36:08] check your heart if your heart is at
[36:11] peace
[36:11] then you know Satan is at work in your
[36:13] mind trying to bring doubt to come in
[36:16] he says you can't stop the crows from
[36:19] flying over
[36:20] the birds from flying over but you can
[36:22] sure stop you from roosting so you can't
[36:24] stop thoughts from coming into your head
[36:26] they'll constantly come but you can stop
[36:29] them from roosting when you have a
[36:31] negative thought maybe you have a
[36:33] lustful spirit and you're getting a
[36:34] lustful thought lustful desire maybe
[36:37] you're getting a worldly thought to
[36:38] worldly desire keep your mind fixed on
[36:40] the word of God
[36:42] amen thank you Lord now does the bible
[36:46] say that when you are tempted
[36:48] that you need to kneel down and ask the
[36:51] Lord to deliver you or does it say you
[36:54] resist the devil and he will flee amen
[36:59] you want the god to do the resisting for
[37:01] you when when you don't want to
[37:03] acknowledge the fact that you are a free
[37:05] moral agent
[37:06] and that free choice that God gave to
[37:08] you
[37:09] is depending on you to use your free
[37:11] choice to make good choices
[37:13] amen if you didn't have that free choice
[37:17] then you're being like a robot
[37:21] but God gave it back to you
[37:24] the choices we make in this life amen
[37:27] the prophet of God tells I said he
[37:29] looked down through time and he saw who
[37:31] would and who wouldn't
[37:33] amen so what caliber of sin are you
[37:35] carrying
[37:37] are you carrying the Fate seed of Jesus
[37:39] Christ
[37:40] amen as he really deposited his word
[37:43] within you
[37:45] and remember there was a time
[37:48] when the word was no longer in Mary
[37:54] but
[37:59] she had to
[38:01] give birth
[38:02] to the word
[38:03] that was inner
[38:05] and what happened when she gave birth to
[38:07] the word that was in her were the angels
[38:12] come on
[38:16] did Angels come and surround
[38:19] the birth of the child
[38:22] I Angels on the Earth right now
[38:24] amen hallelujah
[38:28] so there's got there's got to be a time
[38:30] when you meet the angel who says and you
[38:31] say beat according to me according to
[38:33] Thy word I am saying that is past tense
[38:35] in your life
[38:36] you can't constantly be saying be it
[38:38] unto me according to your word amen amen
[38:39] that means you never received the seed
[38:41] yet you never received it inside of you
[38:44] Mary you need to push this child amen
[38:47] nine months is fast
[38:49] since the beginning of this year
[38:52] it's time to push amen amen
[38:57] and God will give you a nice push gift
[39:02] I think only the young people know what
[39:04] push gift is for sunny I'm being told
[39:06] that when they push out a baby the one
[39:08] push gifts now
[39:17] give what's this
[39:21] foreign
[39:22] okay
[39:27] amen
[39:29] Hallelujah
[39:33] so I'm asking you
[39:36] the vision the dream the desire the hope
[39:39] that's within you
[39:40] faith has been blessing that within you
[39:42] it's time to push it out
[39:44] time to push it out
[39:46] you can't go overdue
[39:49] you know when when when you go over time
[39:52] the baby goes into distress
[39:56] some want to consider that they are
[39:59] pregnant
[40:01] some don't want anyone to know that they
[40:03] are pregnant
[40:05] some are trying to keep the baby in as
[40:08] long as possible but Jesus wants to
[40:10] burst forth in your life and Simeon is
[40:13] waiting there in the temple you keeping
[40:15] Simeon waiting
[40:17] hello
[40:19] Mary come on
[40:21] simeon's waiting at the temple
[40:23] the Holy Ghost was revealed to him that
[40:25] he needs to see the Lord's Shire Christ
[40:26] inside of you
[40:28] um
[40:30] amen
[40:31] now watch at the birth God was moving
[40:34] them from place
[40:35] come on all of this is coming fresh now
[40:38] sometimes your birthing place you need
[40:40] to move from where you were
[40:44] yes
[40:46] maybe that's your problem
[40:48] you haven't moved
[40:50] Joseph needs to get you on a donkey
[40:52] and move you to the birthing location
[40:57] amen
[40:58] the place where you were was not good
[41:00] enough for the birth of Jesus because
[41:02] Jesus must be born in Bethlehem of Judah
[41:07] so God's gonna move you and hasn't he be
[41:09] moving us
[41:10] amen sometimes you feel like I pushed
[41:13] you onto the donkey this year
[41:16] amen
[41:17] sometimes it felt like we were lighting
[41:19] a fire under you
[41:20] trying to move you
[41:23] because God is trying to get you to
[41:24] Bethlehem the house of God's prayer amen
[41:27] yes amen hallelujah
[41:31] praise the Lord amen amen
[41:33] don't matter amen so situations may not
[41:36] work out for you but the point that that
[41:38] there was no room in the Inn was already
[41:40] predestinated because God didn't want it
[41:43] to be born in a denomination
[41:46] yes amen
[41:48] God wants his word not to be found in a
[41:51] church building
[41:53] but the mange is now in your heart yes
[41:55] the word must be in your heart
[41:58] amen
[41:59] so when Wendy now with the Shepherds on
[42:02] the Earth
[42:04] Hallelujah
[42:06] I love this type of preaching where the
[42:08] Shepherds on the earth when Christ was
[42:09] manifest and won through the Virgin Mary
[42:13] there were shepherds there
[42:16] amen Shepherds were there ready to come
[42:19] and take the word amen and they went to
[42:21] broadcast it across Shepherd's realm and
[42:24] they began to tell others
[42:26] come and see did Angels appear to the
[42:28] Shepherds
[42:30] amen amen hallelujah yes angels are here
[42:34] on the Earth right now anointing the
[42:37] Shepherds of God to tell them amen that
[42:39] the Lord's Christ is here on the earth
[42:41] amen and I tell you it was only eight
[42:44] days later
[42:45] that they took the baby and Simeon
[42:47] finally saw the Lord's Christ now he
[42:51] says thy servant can depart in peace
[42:53] because mine eyes have seen the Lord's
[42:55] Christ amen yes
[42:57] you know you know you and I won't be
[42:59] afraid of death if you can see the Life
[43:01] of Christ in US Paul says whether I live
[43:04] or whether I die it matters not to me
[43:06] but to live is Christ and to die his
[43:08] game
[43:10] yes amen how many of us really want to
[43:12] push to that level where we see the Life
[43:13] of Christ within us amen I want to see
[43:15] let's stand together give the Lord a
[43:17] good answer before
[43:21] hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[43:24] hallelujah
[43:26] amen I tell you
[43:29] thank you I don't I don't have words for
[43:31] this but I'll tell you what it is
[43:33] he said when the Holy Spirit comes
[43:36] he'll lead you and guide you into all
