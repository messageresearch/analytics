[1:57] amen let's turn to the book of Ephesians
[2:00] amen
[2:03] just want to exhort a little bit and
[2:05] then you can have a time of prayer amen
[2:08] how many of you've been blessed with the
[2:10] services
[2:11] amen I mean if you can see that we are
[2:13] growing in Christ
[2:15] amen hallelujah
[2:18] one of these days is it's going to
[2:20] explode into a body change amen amen now
[2:23] if you're looking forward to that thank
[2:24] you Lord it's only the word and do that
[2:26] for us amen hallelujah amen
[2:30] thank you let's read Ephesians chapter
[2:31] one amen
[2:39] so we'll read from verse 7.
[2:43] in whom we have Redemption through his
[2:45] blood
[2:47] the Forgiveness of sins according to the
[2:49] riches of his grace amen amen so
[2:52] everything was done in the blood of
[2:54] Jesus amen he was the perfect sacrifice
[2:57] amen and when he shed his blood it was
[3:00] finished thank you Lord amen amen
[3:02] everything was stricken off to the one
[3:05] that now accepts the blood and believes
[3:07] on Jesus right amen
[3:10] wherein he had abounded to us with
[3:14] to us would
[3:15] Us in all wisdom and Prudence having
[3:18] made known unto us the mystery of his
[3:21] will according to his good pleasure
[3:23] which he had purposed in himself that in
[3:25] the dispensation of the fullness of
[3:27] times that's under that seventh seal now
[3:29] you've you're going to do a study on the
[3:31] fullness of times you'll see it's at the
[3:33] time of the seventh seal being opened
[3:35] amen
[3:37] having made a known unto us the mystery
[3:39] of his world according to his good
[3:40] pleasure which he had purposed in
[3:42] himself that in the dispensation of the
[3:44] fullness of times he might gather
[3:46] together in one all things in Christ
[3:49] amen both which are in heaven and which
[3:52] are on earth even in him amen so
[3:55] remember Revelation 5 comes into view
[3:57] here now because that's when he's going
[3:59] to take the book of Amen the book of
[4:01] redemption
[4:03] in whom also we have obtained an
[4:07] inheritance
[4:08] amen and that's what our speaker but on
[4:10] this evening amen we have an inheritance
[4:12] being predestinated according to the
[4:15] purpose of him will worketh all things
[4:18] after the counsel of his own will
[4:21] now
[4:22] if we observe what he's saying here
[4:24] being predestinated according to the
[4:26] purpose of him now if you drop two verse
[4:29] 5 you'll see what we were predestinated
[4:31] to having predestinated us unto the
[4:35] adoption of children amen amen
[4:39] by Jesus Christ himself right so that's
[4:42] the
[4:43] purpose
[4:45] that we should be now this is verse 12
[4:46] that we should be to the praise of his
[4:48] glory who first trusted in Christ
[4:51] in whom also he trusted after that he
[4:54] heard the word of truth yes the gospel
[4:56] of ourselves of your salvation you know
[4:58] also after you believed you were sealed
[5:00] when that Holy Spirit of Promise so
[5:03] after you believe you must receive the
[5:05] Holy Ghost have you received the Holy
[5:07] Ghost since you believe so you see the
[5:08] progression of scripture after you
[5:10] believe you receive the Holy Ghost which
[5:12] is the earnest of our inheritance so we
[5:15] have an inheritance the Holy Ghost is
[5:16] the earnest of the itineritance amen
[5:18] until the Redemption of the purchased
[5:21] position unto the praise of his glory
[5:24] amen you may be seated the Lord with
[5:26] blessings to the reading of his word you
[5:27] just want to deal with on the blood
[5:29] there if you turn to Hebrews chapter 9
[5:32] amen Hebrews chapter 9
[5:35] you'll see here from verse 13.
[5:45] let's read from verse 11 then Jesus
[5:48] being the sacrifice but Christ being
[5:50] come and I priest of good things to come
[5:53] by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle
[5:56] not made with the hands that is to say
[5:59] not of this building
[6:01] so remember when Jesus came in the flesh
[6:04] there was a body that was created
[6:08] and he created a body and he injected
[6:10] himself into the human race amen but
[6:12] that body was still subject to death
[6:15] that wasn't a perfect body
[6:17] because Jesus was Aging in that body yes
[6:20] sir amen many times Jesus had to escape
[6:22] if they caught him they would have
[6:24] killed him yeah and even the fact that
[6:26] they killed Jesus showed that he was he
[6:28] could physically die in that body so
[6:30] that's what he is saying now he's no
[6:32] longer in that body but he's in a
[6:34] perfect Tabernacle amen he resurrected
[6:37] in a body not made with hands amen and
[6:41] the Bible says when we see him we shall
[6:42] be like him so we are coming into
[6:45] glorification amen amen hallelujah amen
[6:48] not made with hands that is to say not
[6:51] of this building so he says neither by
[6:53] the blood of goats or calves but by his
[6:56] own bloody entity once into the holy
[6:59] Place having obtained Eternal Redemption
[7:02] for Allah
[7:04] what is redemption
[7:06] bringing back everything that was lost
[7:09] amen amen amen hallelujah for if
[7:13] the blood of bulls and of goats and the
[7:16] ashes of an evil sprinkling the unclean
[7:19] Sanctified the purifying of the flesh
[7:21] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[7:24] who through the eternal spirit offered
[7:27] himself without spot to God Purge your
[7:31] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[7:33] Living God Amen
[7:35] amen amen and for this cause he is the
[7:37] mediator of the New Testament that's the
[7:39] New Covenant now that by means of his
[7:42] death for the Redemption of the
[7:43] transgressions that were under the first
[7:45] testament
[7:46] they which are called might receive the
[7:49] promise of Eternal inheritance amen
[7:53] amen so Christ bought our sin
[7:57] died on the cross
[7:59] and our sins
[8:00] died within amen and we were resurrected
[8:04] to life yeah so everything that Christ
[8:06] had he now gave to us amen we gave him
[8:09] our sin and he gave us eternal life he
[8:13] gave us an eternal inheritance amen amen
[8:16] hallelujah not only that now he's
[8:18] restoring us back into full Dominion
[8:20] Hallelujah power over the Earth amen
[8:23] amen that's what is redeeming us back to
[8:25] what we have fallen from amen men in our
[8:28] present condition in our fallen
[8:30] condition is not God's original image
[8:32] yes sir amen so Christ has put us back
[8:35] in our image where there is it for where
[8:38] a testament is they must also of
[8:40] necessity be dead of the testator nobody
[8:45] can receive an inheritance once the
[8:47] person is living yeah
[8:49] amen and if you know you only receive
[8:51] the inheritance when the person dies
[8:54] amen hallelujah ah thank you Jesus amen
[8:57] and if you know the Bible says that we
[8:59] were died in Christ we were buried in
[9:02] Christ and we rose again in Christ amen
[9:05] so there's something about the Tomb in
[9:07] Jerusalem even now you can go to that
[9:09] tomb
[9:10] and people amen go there for pilgrimage
[9:13] and they see that empty tomb amen but
[9:16] it's not only a representative of Jesus
[9:19] dying being buried and risen again it's
[9:22] also a testament of you and I amen that
[9:25] in that tomb amen our sins died we were
[9:28] buried in Christ amen and if you look
[9:30] for our sins then you can't find it
[9:32] anymore amen
[9:34] thank you Father amen there's nothing
[9:36] there to testify he says for a testament
[9:39] is a force after men are dead so a will
[9:43] is enforced after someone is dead
[9:46] otherwise it is it is of no strength at
[9:49] all while the testated living you can
[9:51] look at your father's will while he's
[9:53] alive all day long and imagine what
[9:55] you're going to get
[9:57] but the only time you become possessed
[10:00] so of it is when he dies
[10:04] amen and our father came on Calvary 2000
[10:07] years ago to die amen I'm driving this
[10:10] point because I want you to understand
[10:11] are we in Eternal inheritance that we
[10:13] have amen
[10:16] whereupon neither the first testament
[10:18] was dedicated without blood for when
[10:20] Moses had spoken every precept to all
[10:23] the people according to the law he took
[10:25] the blood of the clouds and goes with
[10:27] water Scarlet will and his soup and
[10:29] sprinkled both the book and all the
[10:31] people saying this is the blood of the
[10:33] testament which God had enjoyed unto you
[10:35] moreover he sprinkled
[10:38] with blood both the Tabernacle and all
[10:40] the vessels of the ministry and almost
[10:43] all things are by the lower Purge with
[10:45] blood and without shedding of blood is
[10:47] no remission
[10:49] amen hallelujah amen
[10:53] the scripture is packed I can go on
[10:57] reading and reading amen hallelujah
[10:59] but
[11:02] let's read chapter 10 verse 9 there he
[11:05] says lo I come to do thy will o God he
[11:08] taketh away the first that he might
[11:10] establish the second
[11:11] by the which will we
[11:14] we are Sanctified through the offering
[11:16] of the body of Jesus Christ once and for
[11:19] all and every pre-standard daily
[11:21] ministering and offering oftentimes the
[11:23] same sacrifices which can never take
[11:25] away sin but this man after he had
[11:28] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[11:30] sat down on the right hand of God from
[11:33] ends forth expecting till his enemies be
[11:35] made his footstool for by one offering
[11:38] he had perfected
[11:40] um
[11:40] forever
[11:42] amen them that are sanctified
[11:48] now this now watch the progression Right
[11:51] Way of the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[11:55] to us amen
[11:57] amen
[11:58] amen for after that he had said before
[12:01] this is the Covenant that I will make
[12:04] with them after those days saith the
[12:06] Lord I will put my laws into their
[12:07] hearts and in their minds will I write
[12:09] them amen so now remember Satan comes as
[12:13] a deceiver yes
[12:15] he comes to make you feel that you still
[12:17] need to achieve something yeah you still
[12:20] need to attain something and you still
[12:21] need to do something
[12:23] to attain Perfection but in Christ we
[12:26] are already perfect amen amen amen
[12:30] Hallelujah the Bible says our sin was
[12:33] nailed to the cross yeah yeah amen sin
[12:36] meaning the root of sin
[12:39] unbelief itself was nailed to the cross
[12:43] we that are risen with Christ we are
[12:46] Faith because we believe in Jesus Christ
[12:48] and all that Christ died for already aim
[12:51] to achieve amen by restoring everything
[12:53] that Adam lost he had restored back to
[12:55] the believer
[12:57] amen now if you go if you go to the Book
[13:00] of Genesis here you'll see that God is
[13:03] calling Abraham and we're talking about
[13:05] inheritance now right
[13:07] and he tells him this man
[13:10] is an idol worshiper
[13:14] remember after the days of Noah came
[13:18] forth amen they were building Babylon
[13:20] and after this comes the story of
[13:21] Abraham or his name is Abram
[13:24] you'll find a lot of the story and
[13:26] sometimes when we preach it we talk to
[13:28] about him being Abraham but Israeli
[13:31] Abram
[13:32] he only received the body the name
[13:34] change at a specific time yes amen amen
[13:37] hallelujah so you find here in Genesis
[13:40] chapter
[13:44] Genesis chapter 12 his way he calls
[13:46] Abram the Lord calls him and tells him
[13:49] get thee out of thy country and thy
[13:51] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[13:54] a land I will show thee now that's an
[13:56] inheritance
[13:59] amen yes
[14:00] only if you like inheritance
[14:04] you like it
[14:06] how many of you want to watch some of
[14:09] you say honor I want to be make myself
[14:11] my own man
[14:13] I want to work to achieve everything on
[14:15] my own I don't want nothing from nobody
[14:18] amen
[14:21] who would want to do that if your father
[14:24] has given you an inheritance
[14:28] would you want to walk to attain
[14:29] something on your own or do you want to
[14:31] dwell and live in that inheritance live
[14:34] up the blessing of that inheritance amen
[14:37] so
[14:39] he tells him I'm going to lead you into
[14:40] a land that I will show you I will make
[14:42] up be a great nation our bless thee and
[14:45] make thy name great and thou shalt be a
[14:47] blessing amen
[14:55] amen every one of us are in different
[14:58] stages of our journey
[15:00] amen and if I have to ask you what is
[15:03] hindering you from obtaining all of your
[15:05] god-given privileges in Christ
[15:07] there is something hindering you
[15:11] amen
[15:15] say something hindering you
[15:18] and if you tell me there's nothing
[15:19] hindering you I want you to go to a tree
[15:21] and speak to it
[15:24] and curse the tree
[15:28] and see if the tree obeys you
[15:32] that's the goal amen
[15:35] if I could paint a picture for you
[15:38] and tell you and ask you what was the
[15:39] opening of the seals for why was titled
[15:42] deep brought back down to the Earth amen
[15:45] if we can see the end
[15:49] if we can see the end goal that Christ
[15:52] has come to redeem us and put us back
[15:55] in before the fall
[15:57] that when Adam spoke in the winds the
[16:00] Seas the trees nature obeyed him yes
[16:03] amen we are coming back to a God faith
[16:06] amen yes amen and in order to have a
[16:10] god-like faith because we are amateur
[16:12] Gods on the Earth
[16:14] amen
[16:15] amen what have we got to do
[16:18] Hallelujah we have got to speak the word
[16:20] of God
[16:21] amen heavens and earth will pass away
[16:23] but my word will never pass away
[16:25] sometimes we are through you speaking
[16:27] our own words
[16:28] sometimes our own words will fail but
[16:31] we've got to use the word of God Amen
[16:33] Jesus himself used the word of God when
[16:36] the enemy came to him he used the word
[16:38] of God and sometimes we can't use the
[16:40] word of God because we don't know the
[16:42] word of God we don't know the promises
[16:44] of God
[16:45] amen amen there's nothing that can be
[16:49] able to stand before us at this time in
[16:51] this hour in this season if we know the
[16:54] word of God and can apply the word of
[16:55] God thank you amen
[16:58] yes and we need to build ourselves upon
[17:01] the word of God why did Brother Branham
[17:03] come at the end of seven Church ages
[17:06] something was lost from the church
[17:08] the true word was taken away from the
[17:11] people amen yes he came to restore us
[17:13] back to the world amen amen hallelujah
[17:16] so my question is how well do you know
[17:19] the Bible
[17:20] how well do you know the word how well
[17:23] do you know the promises of God to apply
[17:25] the word amen
[17:26] how well do you know the word to make it
[17:28] possible to you
[17:30] amen hallelujah the reason we cannot see
[17:33] the effects of it is because we don't
[17:35] know the word of God and if you don't
[17:37] know the word of God you can't have
[17:38] faith in the word of God
[17:40] we are presumptuous about many things
[17:43] many times we have hope and many times
[17:45] we are calling and praying to God and
[17:47] asking for things and begging him for
[17:49] things when we don't need to be Beggars
[17:52] that's right amen thank you
[17:55] yes amen I want you to go read Jesus
[17:57] life story
[17:59] to read the four Gospels
[18:01] and see every time people came to him
[18:05] did he now start a long prayer
[18:08] did he pray for the woman with issue of
[18:09] blood
[18:10] did he pray for the Centurion servant
[18:13] did he
[18:15] how many how many times has Jesus prayed
[18:21] are you in His image and likeness
[18:26] Jesus speaks to the Fig Tree amen and
[18:29] what happens
[18:32] the Fig Tree obeys the Creator amen amen
[18:39] huh let's go to Genesis 1.
[18:51] Genesis 1.
[18:54] 26.
[18:56] I told you if I can show you the end
[18:58] goal of what the opening of the Lord
[19:01] came to do is to make you back into the
[19:03] image of God after his likeness amen
[19:06] then we are going to do everything to
[19:08] achieve and move towards them drive away
[19:10] all unbelief because there's nothing
[19:12] left to be open all the mysteries of God
[19:15] are revealed amen
[19:17] what denominations try to do and hide
[19:19] the word and twist the word Malachi 4
[19:22] Revelation 10 7 came and fulfilled his
[19:24] part to reveal the Mysteries right so
[19:26] there's nothing can be hidden from us
[19:28] and God said let us make man in our
[19:31] image is that you yes
[19:33] yes right after our likeness
[19:36] and let them have dominion over the fish
[19:39] of the sea
[19:40] this is what you ought to be now
[19:43] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[19:45] the fall of the air and over the cattle
[19:48] and over the Earth and over every
[19:50] creeping thing that we put upon the
[19:52] Earth
[19:53] so God created man in his own image and
[19:56] in the image of God created he him male
[19:59] and female created he them
[20:07] so man has Dominion on the earth listen
[20:09] to Psalm 18 quickly to show you
[20:10] something here
[20:19] sorry proverbs 18.
[20:25] hallelujah amen
[20:31] glory be to his name amen amen amen you
[20:34] love the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen
[20:38] we've got to come back to our original
[20:39] purpose amen
[20:43] sorry sorry
[20:45] my mind is racing at 100 miles per hour
[20:47] now and I'm tying up scriptures I need
[20:49] to get to Psalm 115.
[20:53] Psalm 115. so remember what we said man
[20:55] is created after his image
[20:57] his likeness to have dominion on the
[20:59] earth Psalm 115 verse
[21:03] 16.
[21:08] here now what the Bible says the heavens
[21:11] even the heavens are the Lords
[21:16] but the Earth
[21:17] as he given to who
[21:26] sense even the heavens are the Lords but
[21:28] the Earth had the given to the Children
[21:30] of Men
[21:33] so if God wants to do anything on the
[21:34] Earth
[21:36] who must you work through
[21:38] amen
[21:40] amen
[21:42] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[21:46] on the Earth
[21:48] amen why did you always need man to
[21:51] cooperate with him
[21:53] because God is a spirit amen amen
[21:56] hallelujah so he is God of the heavens
[22:00] he's God of all creation but he plays
[22:03] man to have dominion on the Earth
[22:08] amen we are coming back to a god man yes
[22:12] amen a god-like image yes amen we are
[22:15] driving at all unbelief amen we are
[22:17] driving on all fear and that's what's
[22:19] keeping the people down right now fear
[22:21] yes amen and Jesus said in Mark 11 23 if
[22:26] you can believe your own words
[22:29] if you say to this mountain be thou
[22:32] removed yes crash into the sea yes and
[22:35] believe what you have said yes you can
[22:37] have what you will amen
[22:40] amen amen now do what is faith
[22:44] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[22:47] the evidence of things not seen right
[22:50] when we are speaking now we need to
[22:52] speak what we believe will happen and
[22:55] not what we are seeing amen amen let me
[22:58] show you now how we are in the image and
[23:00] likeness of God
[23:01] Genesis 1 God is seeing a dark World a
[23:05] void world
[23:08] right Darkness over the face of the Jeep
[23:11] he's seeing Darkness all around
[23:14] does he speak
[23:16] what he sees
[23:18] does he speak oh look at the world it's
[23:20] so dark
[23:22] does he speak look at my problem
[23:26] does he speak what he wants to see yes
[23:28] he speaks let there be light
[23:32] amen amen thank you Lord
[23:36] now why am I saying this we are now what
[23:39] is the third pool all about speaking yes
[23:42] I'm afraid too many people think it yes
[23:47] too many people think uh I believe that
[23:50] in their minds but they never confess it
[23:52] yeah
[23:53] I find that to be a problem in the
[23:55] church as well yes yes
[23:58] you know what even after the word is
[24:00] being preached I found this and I found
[24:02] this when I'm doing Diagnostics
[24:04] because many times after the word is
[24:07] being preached Faith drops in the hearts
[24:09] of the people but they never speak their
[24:11] faith what happens after the service
[24:13] the minister prays for you
[24:16] you never confess nothing
[24:20] did you notice that
[24:24] how many of you got a need yeah you're
[24:26] raising your hand
[24:28] now the minister is offering prayer for
[24:29] you
[24:30] but who must say you must save you does
[24:33] it take the minister says does it save
[24:36] the pastor praise
[24:39] do you know that all you and I both of
[24:41] us are Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[24:43] and that the same power and anointing
[24:45] has given me through the power of the
[24:47] Holy Ghost he has given you yeah it's
[24:49] just that people are not taught the
[24:51] right way and they're taught to look
[24:52] upon a priest and a pastor and this high
[24:55] and mighty man yeah and you always need
[24:57] to go to him but the same access he has
[25:00] given the ministry has given to you that
[25:02] if you say to this mountain if you speak
[25:05] to a situation
[25:09] amen hallelujah
[25:11] now there is no sickness no circumstance
[25:14] should be able to stand in our way and
[25:16] God is putting us through training
[25:18] grounds right now amen amen thank you
[25:20] yes you need to take control of your
[25:22] situation amen you need to speak to your
[25:25] situation
[25:26] God is training you amen he's bringing
[25:29] you into his image and after his
[25:31] likeness yeah
[25:32] don't speak what you are seeing speak
[25:35] faith over your situation amen God saw
[25:39] your Dark Void yeah Darkness over the
[25:42] face of the deep and he said let there
[25:44] be light
[25:46] amen don't let it remain in your
[25:47] thoughts now because prior to that
[25:49] everything was in God's thoughts amen it
[25:52] was in the back part of his mind
[25:54] but he had to speak his thoughts
[25:57] amen he had to express his thoughts
[25:59] now we are not mutant dumb and that's
[26:01] where Satan comes in now he keeps the
[26:04] church Beauty and dumb he keeps the
[26:06] church not confessing what they believe
[26:09] amen hallelujah
[26:11] that's why he oppresses you that you
[26:14] can't say Amen to the word because amen
[26:17] saying I believe that word amen is
[26:19] saying I confess that I believe it so he
[26:22] keeps you mutant he keeps you dumb
[26:23] therefore people can't have the victory
[26:26] amen amen hallelujah
[26:30] don't let don't be a tool for the enemy
[26:32] don't be a true for Satan say Satan you
[26:35] are trying to keep my mouth closed but

[42:45] don't get asked a question
[42:50] and Jesus answered and said unto it
[42:55] the tree was questioning Jesus
[43:02] if Jesus comes to your tree
[43:05] will you find fruit
[43:07] amen amen
[43:09] is this not the nature of Our Lord
[43:14] if you go and read the parable where
[43:16] Jesus is talking about
[43:18] the
[43:21] he gave them uh
[43:23] what did he give them money
[43:25] one hit it in the ground once he says
[43:28] don't you know that I reap where Heaven
[43:29] so yeah
[43:32] go read that story
[43:34] he says you should at least put it
[43:38] in modern terms of bands so they will
[43:40] collect interest
[43:43] but you did nothing with it what am I
[43:46] talking about the word of God I've given
[43:49] you the word of God but you did nothing
[43:50] with it
[43:53] you don't speak the word of God you
[43:55] didn't practice the word of God you
[43:57] didn't exercise the word of God Amen you
[44:00] did nothing with it
[44:01] you just content
[44:04] that's right that everything is done
[44:07] but you forget fail to see the ultimate
[44:09] goal is that this you must become the
[44:11] Living Word how do you become the Living
[44:13] Word if you don't speak the word yes
[44:18] you've got to mix your faith with the
[44:20] word that's when it becomes powerful it
[44:22] releases power
[44:25] there's so many quotes I can show you
[44:26] brother Brandon says there's nothing
[44:28] more powerful than the word of God Amen
[44:30] doesn't the Bible says Heaven and Earth
[44:32] will pass away but my words will never
[44:33] fail
[44:34] so why don't we speak the word of God
[44:36] Amen
[44:39] amen instead of speaking negativity
[44:41] instead of speaking fear yeah look at
[44:44] what happened to job
[44:46] speaking fear oh let me just go offer
[44:49] this prayer just in case my children sin
[44:51] I think they might be sinning now he was
[44:54] focused on the problem
[44:56] the Bible says the prophet says that his
[45:00] faith would have brought him out of it
[45:01] but his fear brought him to it
[45:05] ask yourself the situations you faced in
[45:08] your life the situations you are facing
[45:09] now
[45:11] is it not because you may be spoke it

[52:10] God will not return void yes
[52:15] something uh I'm going to re-emphasize
[52:17] this so sometimes we pray too many long
[52:20] prayers of Our Own we say lots of words
[52:27] we say lots of words
[52:31] when we don't need all we need to do is
[52:34] say back the word let me give you an
[52:36] example for healing let's turn to one
[52:37] Peter chapter two
[52:44] amen glory be to his name amen we're
[52:46] going to finish now and start praying
[52:47] amen hallelujah amen
[52:59] okay let's read from verse 21.
[53:04] for even here until where you called
[53:06] because Christ also suffered for us
[53:07] leaving us an example so who's our
[53:10] example
[53:12] that you should know that you should
[53:13] follow in his steps
[53:15] amen what do you saying we must follow
[53:17] in his steps
[53:20] who did no sin neither was guile found
[53:23] in his mouth so I'll be following there
[53:25] now we must our sin was buried taken on
[53:28] the cross right neither was God found in
[53:31] our mouths who when he was reviled
[53:34] reviled not again
[53:35] so watch now people are going to come
[53:36] and rev you up
[53:38] you revile not again when he suffered he
[53:40] threatened not
[53:42] how many of us threatened people
[53:47] but committed himself to him the judges
[53:50] righteously
[53:51] amen so when somebody is coming against
[53:53] you committed to the Lord Lord I'm
[53:56] committing this to you
[53:58] here's where I want to get to now verse
[53:59] 24 remember this verse recite it
[54:01] memorize it it's important
[54:04] or his own self be our sins in his own
[54:07] body on the tree that we being dead to
