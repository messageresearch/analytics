hey man he's not willing that any should perish but des embrace idea but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day so God is not in the tiny limitless us thousand years is like one day - it says here the long-suffering of God says I'm greedy yes amen twenty years and it did one of the Pens it don't want to tell the

think of it come on boys the crowd is telling us amen why you know make a new heaven and a new earth what righteousness see so the crooks said the drug peddlers at shipping run-ins and you know mafias and all together with the devil and all we felt and then that we gone oh that's for us anymore I bet we'll see so we can go then right so obviously believe this and the script is saying it right verse 11 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you are you to be in all holy conversation and godliness a man should be right amen let our minds be right hey man we must be ready to go we must not be entangled about the things of this world it might be don't wanna live in sin and corruption hey man what manner of people we are to be see first one looking for and the coming of the great day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt would surely eat how many of you saw the pudding I am and always he get a furnace hmm and he tells liquid you know that take scrap cars and all that Belgica smudge it and they don't make you dislike it so everything is going to be bouncing up all those things are for the face of the economy but melted right nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heaven and a new earth amen where he dwelleth righteousness destroy anybody we not going to be to start he's going to take us away we got to go first to the wedding supper then we'll become to the honeymoon thousand years 1000 years together live on earth knows nothing the devil is past 4,000 years we can have good houses will give a plant there everything else total peace amen and he says now that's only the honeymoon and then we go to Eternity New Jerusalem comes down amen New Jerusalem that's revelation 21 New Jerusalem comes down amen as a bride adorned for her husband hmm but with some scriptures they ran time so we got all these things coming up on the face of the earth so we're looking for new heavens and the new earth so the front said God doesn't destroy there are all that you know the strange world of the earth the destroy all sin and godliness every sickness some people be Berta you renovate here in the tribulation is the be some real there there were the hands of everything you know so there the idiom is going to be things up on her see we're going to be living on earth and then we go to New Jerusalem that's what we're gonna be for eternity everyone comes down to earth mmm see so he doesn't it doesn't touch the framework of the earth and we know they're there tectonic atomic plates but the movement you can you get earthquakes about all those things will be perfect they'll be perfectly aligned again but number two super excited cause the earthquakes he doesn't destroy the framework of the earth hmm see you work on the same earth amen so we go back we come back to live on the same earth praise the Lord how do you like for that amen words would beloved verse 14 seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found a few min peace without spot and blameless I'll be of us can say this what I have without Spartan ladies the reason you must be without spot we must be blameless how many of us can say a lot of the lot of spots and I've been through for many things I've number one I have got lot of spots basic things see how we treat one another are we christ-like are we long-suffering and before bear with one another somebody make a mistake you dare to write the most but when the woman was caught in the very act of adultery they brought it to Jesus huh whether the the world was Torah but the one who can forgive sins was there amen now welcome deserve the hut and we saw all this guide to st. Oliver guilty and he waited waited he left town he wrote something on the ground a Teddy said fine which one of you is without sin cast the first stone well mr. MELAS but before somebody taken in the fall or something we are ready to rust about we're ready to tell them often give them a piece of our mind [Music] [Laughter] [Music] people cannot be wrong suffering the Bible says without spot without blemish I would like to write somebody off see whether the believers are not believers see that gives anybody I will all suffering that he is long-suffering lord have prayed for them replace them maybe maybe in a family the pellets made me for the children are they long-suffering don't give up on the children see there were the disabled children and they they can't the persevere and pray you know down but he said you must be without spot or blemish verse 15 and I can't that the long-suffering of our body salvation why you want to be long suffering because of salvation he wants people where salvation amen so long-suffering is given them enough time through yes the gospel of the preach now there's no PA because they ask Jesus what shall there be so the gospel must be preached to all their double yes then shall come so who's gonna be able so the reason why some people don't believe this at the end of the world they don't understand how it's gonna end but he's where I am exactly of God says he's here he's going to burn up here everything is going to change it and make it a safe place so they can't understand all the earth is gonna hit but it's all recorded in the world of book but and I found in the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation even as a beloved fall according to the wisdom given a fail a little not heal and also it all is a pistol spitting in them these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable missile see unleaded unstable we don't understand they wrestle against these things and they do also as the duels are the other scriptures unto the old destruction the old destruction seen as people fighting the word to me there's people fighting Christianity we get the Atheist fight II don't know god never creates a barrier and everything is evolved from ethnic banging and there was no intelligence they want to see see then they live fighting and whistling against the things of God but the world of money so suppose if they believe the Word of God he says Jennison in the beginning God created heavens at the earth hmm but they don't believe the Word of God or Moses or kids and you get all the other guys disputing the go there and the New Testament alone and therefore these scriptures but you know we don't believe they right into a beam by the bottle self man who by the holy ghost wrote amen what use method men wrote the luminometer John and Peter Paul and all that they are men they wrote that's right and then one group are the Holy Ghost right amen see verse 17 he therefore beloved seeing you know these things before see you know you know that beforehand beware lest you also being led away with the error of the weekend fall from your own steadfastness and they tell you know all this self things are wrong in the base it is wrong that the Prophet is wrong some people are weak to perform as many have done we've got to go to listen to all these people that are you know breeding an for super against the world we must stay with aware of the message Jack none of me a lot of people hate the message now in the message they're against it see and some people are we do these people you're going to follow and people can be influenced with that they can solve so quickly save even entice expands then I'm going to do it it's what they are saying see but grow in grace and in the knowledge of forward seven Jesus Christ so he'll be glory for now and forever amen so God is going to do this what is going to do been happier in my change the whole earth amen the bride goes in the Millennium we come back to earth amen for the glories think it is Tibet you now it was a with Noah first step for this family and before the and now oldest people were there and then sinners and buckles and ungodliness and evil in the heart he meant enough he just step up nobody else Jesse Bennett's family and all the heads just step out if the hand up is missing here the promise said who goes to that you have a new earth just like Noah and those people that with who it won't need that come up he says Janna if he inside I'll actually like to read the Pope he says that God has restored to us the Word of God amen they didn't believe the world they will go in and we have a promise and he's particularly making reference to the message a man who's gonna go and he actually says that was gonna build a new city he actually says duck denominations but those were playing with a word now and the Prophet messenger they are going to go amen amen they're going to be many others that you were praising tend to sound 50/50 I think all the served up with people they coming up so let's hope it sit down be and everybody if you think the father's you will sit and eat power on Sunday said I can you can sit down and that tsunami together sit down there if we go to the food court everybody gonna be sitting down there one-and-a-half meter park so the clamor there you know people who are battling restaurants so weíll open up their sons they can go sit down but take away now sit down look what their sounds tell us a little Q words see if something's in Old Testament that's all - testifying what's going to happen some fifty the mighty God even the Lord spoken and call the earth from the rising of the Sun and to the going down the earth out of Zion the perfection of beauty go to China our God shall come and shall not keep silent a fire shall devour before him a fire and it shall be very tempted round about him each are called to the Airman's from above and to the earth that he may judge his people gather my sense together how to be those that I've made a covenant would be by sacrifice and the Evan shall declare his righteousness for God for God is Jack himself racer and fire will go before him and I give Mississippi he'll be waiting over there so you find even in that time people were so thinking I bring it this bringing sacrifice you know God requires a sacrifice let's go and sacrifice and God said you came to time you got fed up looking I thought you don't only want your sacrifices see it become a routine thing confident didn't even come in the sacrifice right verse 14 same sub 50 offer on the work Thanksgiving and paint the walls onto the Voskhod and call upon me the day of trouble I will do thee and that thou shalt glorify me but under the wicked god say what has done to do to declare my sketches all that thou shalt speak covenant in develop seeing the interest instruction and custard my words behind me so I see y'all can take my word I've got nothing to show about my about word but statuettes see the running water bring sacrifice sacrifice but you're not living by my word no God wanted them to be faithful but this about God wanna sacrifice a bridge yet sacrifice event but core according to the day of trouble I will do thee and thou shalt glorify me friends alone so let's go to Revelation 21 that up we let us look toward God said what is going to do 2nd Peter and if you leave there I read the book of James James they believe River exactly what Peter was right again and James rose parallel to what Peter book they both agree that he spoke about the heavens and earth being on fire how to say and how its reserved ungodly bed and the angels that sinned but judgment is reserved for them see if we got retains its well eventually family what Peter preached and then about the Lord coming day right so he says he had nominations 21 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth so what is new heaven and a new earth God renovated it amen see he was preparing and he comes down but for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea right so this is where the brahmic preaching in the spicy well what God shall is missing it's actually three and a half holes what serves three and a half hours but was this funny and the Prophet said the earth that there was no but the Bible says in that spot of Jerusalem in Israel that we know see and the city will be 15 at the trial square the length the breadth and the height 1,500 miles and then he says he he he made in the dark in America he says he's asked the size of America the city will be there greatly further the pushing up amen a great big mountain and the law will be right up on the console amen and alga this the world superboots and the gates of there the twelve apostels the veins on each of the gate the Foundation's over there God give a total description so they reckon he says that another way would see that we don't we'll see there so you be our from the state of America right now it's not you can't measure that area because the sea and everything is a visitor agency and this rail is one of the smallest possible plane but he says be fifteen hundred mile square anyway that virtually they read about the scripture bales and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and heard a great voice out of heaven saying no the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he'll accept upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful praise Allah so Allah tells us la comes down to earth he says grace amen God every one of these people praise Lord so we look at it what was in the act of God if the people God was hello him he looked all alone then he made man in His image praise Allah okay he did that to show the attributes that he had to be Savior to be father to be ela and many many other things so God's done working with man now he comes from the wood men or New Jerusalem comes down from heaven he comes and with us and he says he will be our wallet we shall be should see what had to be done amen to be united with man again he was not to be just living alone and he had all the power and everything else and all that the universe in front of him there didn't he come to Valley on earth amen and that we know was Satan over the stability Satan is destroyed he's cast into the lake of fire is completely destroyed see but we promised a new souls ie Journal amen the body was revealed of the earth she was of the earth sixteen elements this body will not the soul the soul is eternal amen was part of God then he great heavenly body for the soul to live in will be very much looking like the way we are not made of the earthly elements so much Jesus around you know so that Rory 540 amen Jesus could walk through the wall hmm because this happens for there amen well they will be the same amen and we might be you'll be studying our way move we can walk through the wall and we do great feet set we can do great things sister I tell you right now the world then rejoice with things here that I happily hmm he doesn't tell you what people somebody's singing now and they've got a certain voice and they're singing a certain style down and all the people get excited move or somebody comedy said it's a magician and then I'll get close and you know what they don't stand up and everything else now what we gonna be stars and times for the amen amen they make you day getting excited by somebody singing and if somebody sing have any sense of they get very emotional you'll actually see them tearing crying see they get excited by those things praise the Lord amen whatever they want to do the earth something sometimes people will do great feat SIA jump from up a high mountain and things like that see people want to go come up um elbrus the Tico we conquered amen so what amen we don't want to talk about here is we want to go to heaven amen you'll be on earth and they do it all for her for a short period of time and then you could die the one God he was funny to jump from a very high mountain has something happened to these so special are owning the guy to that but we remember that we never like to talk hmm you live all the front of you for eternity and in this thing baby the thing you want to go to that some place within a few seconds you got me amen amen see so yeah it helps us yet and you haven't been a do it God waits and they don't got me so powerful if you want to take this over you can just move it out of its orbit remove it at me hold on you see I'm sick and tired of it I'm sick in time of the people I'm sick and tired of the way they live let me just take it you moving out of their ovens that will just be floating in space everybody to be been so how many of you know there was a meteorite pass-throughs between the moon and the earth he was two weeks ago and the moon ready because alone army it was for six football fields this big thing was moving fast they said it could have crashed into there and nobody knew it the only you are safe fast so thousands of those things going around and rather hard if God want to take the earth that we should they do that I mean why must really care about people are this endless problem the way it really can just be shown him he can

they in a big problem through the bank accounts that if you find someone is not drawing the line they find that all these people that frees the bank accounts Iran is suffering now and they're giving like they're coming they're getting crippled because sanction nobody must buy the oil see and if anybody buy the oil you look like sections to them see so what will happen our people can't buy or sell this will be hard you go to be you can take on the back of the beast to be free and by itself by himself is business but every Christmas on earth is buying and selling what are they making [Music] thank you put the trend what America did to Huawei in China they give me no one they sell phones but because they find that they were using instruments to work against a red color right and I think if anybody does positive so them also we also do that apply sanctions for them hey when we got a problem so the thing you got a bright future you know things have changed hmm change they would be looking

people you know that Olivia read since so Robert tells us even in the building if it's fine 1,000 years see we step out of the villa near he talks about the eighth day Jesus arose on the eighth day
