[20:44] that

[20:48] that's how it is we don't come to a cold
[20:51] formal religion

[20:55] the Holy Spirit has become tangible to
[20:58] us

[21:02] we feel his presence we know when he's
[21:05] moving amongst us amen
[21:07] and that's what we want we want the Holy
[21:09] Spirit to move amongst us to move
[21:12] amongst his people hallelujah
[21:14] and when he does that then you know that
[21:16] this is not we're not talking about a
[21:18] historical Jesus amen but he's talking
[21:21] about Jesus that is amongst us amen
[21:26] we don't want some cold formal religion
[21:28] but we want Jesus Christ in the way he's
[21:31] working today we want Jesus in the now
[21:33] amen when they have a praise in Jesus
[21:36] Christ amen amen
[21:39] amen you got your Bible this morning I'm
[21:41] going to turn to
[21:42] Luke chapter 1 verse 1.
[21:47] [Music]
[21:58] sorry Luke chapter 2 verse one
[22:15] [Music]
[22:16] and he came to pass in those days
[22:19] then they went out a decree from Caesar
[22:22] Augustus
[22:25] that's going to be history
[22:28] of Nazareth
[22:30] into Judea
[22:32] and to the city of David which is called
[22:41] Mary is a so we know that Mary was about
[22:45] in the stage of a pregnancy to deliver
[22:49] and so it was
[22:51] that while they were there the days we
[22:54] accomplished that she should be
[22:56] delivered
[22:58] and she brought forth the firstborn son
[23:00] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[23:03] laid him in a Manger because there was
[23:06] no room for them in the Inn
[23:09] will turn also to Romans 8 28.
[23:15] and we know
[23:17] that all things
[23:19] work together for good to them that love
[23:22] God to them who are called according to
[23:25] his purpose Emmanuel may be seated
[23:34] so we find here
[23:42] this morning we're going to speak on
[23:44] think that it's just
[23:46] Christmas season
[23:49] and we look at the world carrying on in
[23:52] the
[23:52] in this great
[23:56] commercial move of Christmas where the
[23:59] commercial world makes the most money
[24:00] this part of the year amen
[24:03] and
[24:06] it becomes a like a
[24:09] a season of frenzy
[24:13] and he took away the true meaning of
[24:15] what the true Christmas was really
[24:17] supposed to be
[24:18] and the world is in such a frenzy when
[24:21] everybody talks about Christmas the last
[24:24] thing is on them on their mind is about
[24:26] Christ
[24:27] we know the history that firstly this
[24:29] was a Christian uh Christmas is not a
[24:33] was not a
[24:35] Protestant holiday it was originated
[24:38] from the care from Catholicism yes
[24:39] because they were pagans worshiping the
[24:42] sun god
[24:43] and they thought they could incorporate
[24:45] into that sun god worship which was
[24:48] worshiping Jupiter when they were pagans
[24:50] they could worship their son
[24:54] and make Jesus
[24:56] celebration on the same day that's why
[24:58] it's called the price Mass so we know
[24:59] all that but we find that even then the
[25:03] Protestant took this on but and they
[25:05] instead of being sincere about it and
[25:07] thinking about Christ
[25:08] he does now become so commercialized and
[25:11] that's why they even take out the word
[25:13] Christ and put the word Xmas
[25:15] and everything is become around Santa
[25:17] Claus and things like that and all about
[25:20] partying and drinking and
[25:23] all these things that are going on
[25:25] everything
[25:30] that you see there but there was a true
[25:32] Christmas
[25:33] there was a real Christmas amen
[25:37] there was one Christmas
[25:39] one Christmas gift
[25:41] a true Christmas gift and the only
[25:43] Christmas gift
[25:45] would you believe be for the Salvation
[25:48] of mankind
[25:50] which was all in God's Plan of
[25:52] Redemption amen
[25:54] that because God of man's Fallen
[25:56] condition God at 14 that he will come
[26:00] and manifest himself upon the Earth
[26:03] to save Fallen man that's what the Bible
[26:06] said for God so loved the world
[26:09] because that's his world his children
[26:12] all that he cared about all that he
[26:14] loved he knew that he had to save his
[26:16] world yes and he gave his only begotten
[26:19] son amen
[26:21] amen that whosoever believeth on him
[26:23] shall not perish but I have everlasting
[26:26] life amen because outside of Christ
[26:28] everyone will perish
[26:30] the only way to have eternal life is
[26:34] through Jesus Christ
[26:37] could come
[26:40] to Jesus
[26:41] and after achieving all the accolades of
[26:44] life
[26:45] after having religion after having all
[26:48] the wealth of the world after following
[26:50] the law
[26:52] he still was not satisfied because he
[26:54] knew he was going to perish because he
[26:57] wants to know how do I achieve this
[26:59] eternal life
[27:00] but the way it was provided for him he
[27:02] couldn't accept it
[27:05] and we know what happened in the end of
[27:06] his story he opened his eyes in hell
[27:10] so we're going to speak on this morning
[27:13] God's gifts always find their places
[27:17] amen
[27:18] and for a subtitle this morning
[27:21] we say the Creator in his own creation
[27:24] for his creation
[27:27] amen because God himself the Creator
[27:32] and to come and fashion himself like man
[27:36] and he had to form his own creation amen
[27:41] nothing else could save mankind but God
[27:45] himself amen yes yes not the second
[27:48] person of the Trinity as the Catholic
[27:51] Church puts it
[27:52] no God himself amen God is spirits and a
[27:57] spirit he cannot die as Purity cannot
[28:00] bleed and spirit he cannot be a savior
[28:02] but he had all his attributes in him
[28:06] and he had to create a body
[28:08] amen a body let us proof aside already
[28:12] by the prophet desire a virgin shall
[28:14] conceive
[28:16] but if you had to become a time where
[28:19] this world had to be manifested there to
[28:22] be a memory upon the Earth
[28:24] dare to be a person that when the Angels
[28:28] spoke to her she said be it unto me
[28:30] according to Thy word amen amen there to
[28:34] be a virgin whom yes amen and she had to
[28:37] have faith to believe what the Angels
[28:39] had said to her
[28:41] and she had to accept what the angel
[28:44] said to her amen and then Mary's womb
[28:48] became a borrowed womb I'm not talking
[28:51] about Mary had no partiness except their
[28:54] faith and believing what the angel said
[28:56] but a body a womb was just a borrowed
[29:00] womb because the Bible says when she
[29:03] believed what when she accepted what the
[29:05] angel said the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[29:07] over Shadow there and she conceived of
[29:10] that Holy One
[29:12] amen amen so she had a complete embryo
[29:17] from dinner amen and she had no part to
[29:20] play in depth because why
[29:23] God himself
[29:26] amen the Creator formed his own creation
[29:28] for who for you and I oh thank you for
[29:31] his creation thank you Lord because why
[29:33] because of his creation
[29:37] Adam
[29:38] and Eve in the Garden of Eden it became
[29:40] a fallen race
[29:42] and Adam forfeited
[29:45] the title leads right there in the
[29:47] Garden of Eden because prior to that
[29:49] Adam had authority over the Earth that's
[29:52] right amen
[29:54] Adam and power over all the years yes he
[29:59] called Animals by their name he could he
[30:02] could place mountains in their places
[30:04] he had the power to speak the word yes
[30:08] but all this was forfeited because of
[30:10] sin
[30:11] but all this was not
[30:14] unknown to God all it was part of God's
[30:17] plan because he had the attributes and
[30:20] he had to manifest that attributes amen
[30:23] whatever God is he has to manifest it
[30:26] amen
[30:28] because that's not
[30:30] God has to manifest every attribute of
[30:32] his
[30:34] and the same thing today
[30:36] God Is A Healer so he must manifest that
[30:38] healing words
[30:40] so why we don't use ask God when we need
[30:43] healing for him to manifest his word he
[30:45] wants to manifest the word
[30:47] you got someone that's lost in your
[30:49] family you got a loved one that's lost
[30:51] ask God to manifest his word as a savior
[30:54] amen that's his attributes
[30:57] he's a Healer he's a savior he's a
[31:00] Creator when he was here on the earth
[31:01] when he brought the from his own
[31:04] creation they brought the bread they
[31:06] brought the fishes from his own creation
[31:08] he was creating
[31:11] he took from his own creation and he
[31:13] created more and more he multiplied it
[31:16] but he said major things than this shall
[31:19] you do amen yes until we know that there
[31:23] was a time on the Earth
[31:25] when the prophet was here something that
[31:27] wasn't created he could speak that's
[31:30] right and the squirrels came amen
[31:33] so what was God showing us all the time
[31:36] that he as a Creator created his own
[31:39] creation for his creation amen amen
[31:45] I mean you find that God's gifts always
[31:48] find their places yes
[31:50] now it might have seemed
[31:55] a hurting
[31:56] Mary is in almost about to give birth
[32:01] but now they'll have to travel from
[32:03] Nazareth where they were living
[32:07] all the way to the birthplace
[32:11] in Bethlehem yes
[32:14] at that time it must have been a
[32:17] like a pressure on Joseph and Mary
[32:20] something that is pressurizing them
[32:23] under this Roman government
[32:27] under this Roman rule
[32:29] what a pressure
[32:31] Mary's about to give birth
[32:34] now I must take her and put on upon a
[32:36] donkey and I must go and travel all the
[32:39] way to Judea in Bethlehem
[32:43] but all things work together for the
[32:47] good to them that love the Lord
[32:49] according to his purpose
[32:51] because the scripture must be fulfilled
[32:54] thank you Lord because Christ must come
[32:56] from the lineage of David yes
[32:58] and that's where David was from
[33:01] Bethlehem
[33:02] and if you go and trace it back there it
[33:05] goes all the way to rehab and the great
[33:08] General that she married Salman will
[33:10] beget boys and because and boys began
[33:13] opened and Obed beget Jesse and Jesse
[33:16] beget David and if you follow the
[33:18] lineage that's the way it comes all the
[33:20] way from Caleb actually
[33:22] where when George Joshua was dividing
[33:24] the land from Caleb's son and then he
[33:27] came then little town came deadlier
[33:29] hmm
[33:31] so you trace the lineage all the way
[33:33] there was a reason there to go there
[33:37] but you see
[33:40] but the angel of God was directing them
[33:43] it might seem that
[33:46] the Roman the Roman government is coming
[33:48] with a hard rule
[33:50] by the angel of God was fixing things
[33:53] because why things might happen
[33:55] according to God purpose
[33:58] God's Gift must find its places amen
[34:02] and you're the greatest gift that was
[34:04] going to come to mankind
[34:06] it's now prior to Jesus being born at
[34:09] that time
[34:10] I could imagine the time they're
[34:12] traveling there
[34:14] and it must have been a very tiring
[34:16] Journey it would it wouldn't have been
[34:17] an easy Journey when Mary about to give
[34:20] birth
[34:21] he must have been a hard journey
[34:23] they must have stopped around the places
[34:27] and Joseph must have
[34:29] stopped and made many rests and they
[34:31] began to ponder upon the little
[34:33] Teenage life
[34:35] how they were living in Judea and honest
[34:37] to play in the place
[34:39] and they began to think about their
[34:40] hometown
[34:42] but all this time Mary noticed his staff
[34:46] that was following them
[34:51] and she must have said Joseph did you
[34:53] notice that stuff
[34:55] and he said
[34:57] he must have said oh and then he noticed
[35:00] it
[35:01] and he said no she said no but it was
[35:03] falling out all the time
[35:05] because why the stars that should be
[35:08] aligned because this wasn't just any
[35:10] Star this was a super sign amen this
[35:14] wasn't a normal star
[35:17] he's a bright and Morning Star
[35:21] amen
[35:23] the old cause of History was gonna
[35:24] change
[35:27] in a few moments
[35:30] imagine from the time the sun sets and
[35:32] then the star began to follow them
[35:36] but little did he know at that time
[35:39] that the cause of man of History
[35:41] everything in history is going to change
[35:45] all those demons
[35:46] that were amongst the people had them in
[35:49] bondage
[35:50] when Jesus was going to come upon the
[35:52] Earth those demons that were hiding
[35:55] carrying on amongst the people we're now
[35:58] going to be exposed
[36:02] Redemption plan was in progress amen
[36:07] the creator of life was going to come in
[36:11] human flesh
[36:13] and the Bible says
[36:17] now remember at that time as they were
[36:19] coming just entering into Bethlehem you
[36:21] know coming up
[36:23] they're coming from down desert going up
[36:25] towards Bethlehem
[36:27] amen we are coming from our many walks
[36:29] of life
[36:31] coming from all our systems of life
[36:36] and we didn't realize it
[36:38] we are wondering why we have to go along
[36:41] a life Journey a certain way
[36:43] maybe we went through some hardships
[36:46] maybe we went to some troubling times
[36:49] but we didn't realize that God was
[36:50] preserving us all the time
[36:53] because why God always preserve his
[36:55] gifts yes to find their places
[36:59] God has kept us for this hour
[37:04] Maybe
[37:05] there was a time where you're
[37:07] your parents had to meet at a specific
[37:10] time
[37:11] maybe for some reason if you ask them
[37:13] the history maybe they wouldn't have met
[37:15] but they said to some reason they met
[37:18] maybe they they could have added early
[37:21] debt and they're saying what thank God I
[37:23] got saved I should have died early
[37:25] but you had to come on the Earth
[37:28] go there to make sure you have to come
[37:30] in a certain time and season
[37:35] and we find that the same thing today
[37:39] that no matter what
[37:42] yes Joseph and Mary traveling now
[37:47] and they're coming to Bethlehem
[37:51] and all the the town the the the places
[37:54] where people will come and launch was
[37:56] filled up because everybody is coming
[37:58] now for this taxation
[38:00] there was a pressure on the people
[38:03] amen
[38:06] now all this is happening before Jesus
[38:08] is manifested in the flesh
[38:11] there's a pressure coming upon the
[38:12] people before Jesus manifested in the
[38:15] flesh
[38:17] a pressure coming from Rome upon the
[38:19] people yes
[38:21] and we find that
[38:23] they couldn't find a place because all
[38:25] the places were building
[38:26] you know like you must have experienced
[38:29] that here when it comes to holiday
[38:31] season or maybe they're having some big
[38:33] convention in the country
[38:35] all hotels are full and you can't get a
[38:37] place you can't get a booking
[38:39] so just like that they couldn't get a
[38:41] place
[38:42] there was no room for him
[38:45] but it was ordained that way yes because
[38:48] yes the Lamb of God that will come as a
[38:50] sacrifice for mankind yes amen foreign
[38:54] you will come to save mankind amen and
[38:57] he had to come in a place where Lambs
[39:00] were born amen because he was the Lamb
[39:02] of God yes yes amen
[39:07] and he had to find a place in the stable
[39:09] where the Lambs were born
[39:12] and then
[39:13] when the when Jesus was born
[39:17] they had nothing to wrap him up because
[39:19] he didn't come prepared to get their
[39:22] baby clothes like how you have now where
[39:23] the baby clothes is ready before you
[39:25] give birth
[39:27] they had nothing prepared for him but it
[39:30] was ordained by God
[39:32] they will use something that they use
[39:33] for the ox the swaddling clocks that
[39:36] they put upon the ox's neck so that dogs
[39:40] don't get all bruised up when it locks
[39:42] it tighter
[39:45] and they put that they covered Jesus for
[39:47] that
[39:48] but he was
[39:50] the creator of life
[39:52] would humble himself and come in that
[39:54] fashion
[39:56] who is meant to have pride yes yes who
[39:59] is the man to be proud for when he the
[40:02] creator of Life can come and give
[40:04] service to mankind amen amen
[40:07] and he was wrapped in his warning clocks
[40:10] there he was God presented his gift to
[40:14] mankind
[40:15] wrapped in swirling clocks
[40:18] something that nobody will even who
[40:21] would even think of using that for the
[40:23] child something that's smelling
[40:26] something that is from an animal
[40:29] but God used it to type here's the
[40:32] sacrifice
[40:34] I come to do you just for you this is my
[40:36] love for you my unconditional love
[40:39] the Creator in his own creation for his
[40:43] creation
[40:46] and a prophet saying the first thing
[40:48] this was God
[40:50] this Jesus was God in the form of man
[40:53] that art for people to swallow that even
[40:55] today
[40:57] that he was God
[40:59] that's what he was he wasn't nothing
[41:01] less than God
[41:03] amen
[41:05] amen he was God manifested in flesh yes
[41:08] amen because hug and go die as a spirit
[41:12] yet to form his own create his own flesh
[41:15] that's why he was the first
[41:18] firstborn of the new creation
[41:21] amen
[41:24] this creation wasn't an ordinary
[41:26] creation he didn't take man and woman
[41:27] God himself formed that body amen
[41:31] this wasn't you or Gentile yes he came
[41:35] from the Lilith but he had nothing to do
[41:37] with the Jew agenda
[41:39] God formed that body
[41:44] foreign
[41:48] he wasn't nothing less than God he was
[41:50] God manifested in flesh he was the
[41:53] creator in his own creation this is our
[41:55] Prophet saying this
[41:57] he was a Creator in his creation by the
[42:00] creation for the creation
[42:03] he was a Creator in his creation
[42:08] by his creation for his creation all
[42:11] wings right all wines right back in God
[42:14] the whole thing
[42:16] fullness of God he was the creator in so
[42:19] much that he was God and he was a being
[42:22] on earth a being of time which means
[42:25] that he must add a beginning therefore
[42:27] he created himself a body to live in yes
[42:31] God himself created a body for himself
[42:34] amen that by this creation it might save
[42:37] the Lost creation that he had created so
[42:40] thank you Lord what creation the body
[42:43] that he created Yeah by that body
[42:47] that he come he could use that he could
[42:49] come now through that body
[42:51] as a fashion like unto man to redeem man
[42:54] because he had to come and do the work
[42:56] of Faith kinsman redeemer amen
[42:59] because he loved us so much yes he had
[43:02] to say this creation yes yes amen thank
[43:05] you
[43:07] now therefore God created himself with
[43:09] body he was a Creator and created his
[43:12] own creation
[43:14] that by this creation he might save them
[43:17] that were lost in his creation that you
[43:21] and I creatures of time
[43:23] we only come into this time element
[43:25] because man stepped into sin and death
[43:28] brought into the time element
[43:31] that's right
[43:33] and now to come out of the time element
[43:34] you've got to step into the word
[43:37] that come from eternity amen because God
[43:40] himself comes from eternity in life
[43:42] fashion unto men and started the work of
[43:44] redemption
[43:47] yet about two thousand years ago but he
[43:49] come this day back in the form of the
[43:51] word
[43:52] and now we step into the word amen and
[43:55] we go into that word image that's going
[43:57] to take us into eternity amen amen and
[44:01] deliver you all of being a creature of
[44:03] time yes amen yes amen
[44:06] [Music]
[44:07] thank you
[44:09] that's why you're fighting each one of
[44:10] you you are youthful in your thinking no
[44:13] matter how old you're getting your
[44:15] thinking is always youthful because you
[44:17] always want to be young amen amen
[44:21] because why are you not meant to be old
[44:23] amen some people say at your age be your
[44:27] age you're older but really thinking
[44:30] each one of us we always think we're
[44:32] young in our mind so we're forgetting
[44:34] that his body is decaying his body is
[44:36] dying daily
[44:37] but because in us we're longing and
[44:41] groaning for that body change yes
[44:43] because we are not meant to die we are
[44:47] not meant to Decay that became because
[44:50] of our fallen condition
[44:51] but we thank God when the word goes open
[44:54] to us and the Word was revealed to us we
[44:57] began to understand God's Plan of
[44:59] Redemption yes we began to understand
[45:01] the true salvation the true meaning of
[45:04] Christmas
[45:05] amen so we realized that Christmas is
[45:08] not just a happy go lucky time oh
[45:14] for himself but he's talking about
[45:17] a very time he's not about drinking he's
[45:20] not about partying he's not just having
[45:22] a temporary time of being happy
[45:25] you know now this is the time where
[45:27] people are happy
[45:29] why can't it be like that all the time
[45:30] yes
[45:31] the reason why they can't be like that
[45:33] all the time they are now going into a
[45:35] there's a spirit yes the spirit of
[45:38] Christmas upon them
[45:40] that keeps them this way
[45:42] but if you got the Holy Ghost you're
[45:45] always there amen you always have love
[45:47] yeah you don't always have joy you won't
[45:49] be a temporary person that's happy yes
[45:50] amen yes on a Christmas day you want to
[45:53] laugh and joke and carrying on with
[45:54] everybody or you want to invite everyone
[45:56] to your home you want to go talk nicely
[45:58] to the neighbor you want to talk nicely
[46:00] to the person on the streets yeah
[46:02] but when you go to Nature change amen
[46:04] when you have the new birth there's a
[46:06] nature change yeah
[46:08] deliver you from that Old nature from
[46:11] that Old sticky nature amen there's a
[46:14] transformation that takes place inside
[46:15] of you
[46:16] now that's what Jesus come to do
[46:19] he didn't just he come
[46:21] to be the sacrifice
[46:23] people want to look at him in the manger
[46:25] they want to look at him 2000 years ago
[46:28] but the reason why he come in the first
[46:30] place was to die he didn't come to live
[46:32] he come to die amen he come to be the
[46:35] sacrifice
[46:36] that's why we find the wise man the
[46:39] three wise men the Magi
[46:41] well we're astronomers of the day in
[46:44] that day
[46:45] studying the Stars
[46:48] they picked up he has a different type
[46:51] of stuff
[46:52] in this constellation
[46:54] and they began to follow the star
[46:57] from the time Jesus was born
[47:00] but it wasn't a one-day Journey as we
[47:02] saw the star let's go and see him now
[47:04] they began to leave the East coming from
[47:08] India
[47:09] traveling on all those camels
[47:11] was an easy Journey
[47:14] they picked up the gifts
[47:16] and it gives
[47:17] wasn't normal gift amen
[47:20] he brought gold who spoke would
[47:23] resembles the deity of Jesus
[47:25] they brought frankincense who spoke
[47:28] about Jesus service to Jehovah
[47:32] it spoke about myrrh spoke about his
[47:34] deaths amen these were the gifts they
[47:37] were bringing
[47:40] and the journey wasn't an easy Journey
[47:41] it was a two-year Journey
[47:44] amen coming all the way from from India
[47:46] all the way to Judea
[47:49] foreign
[47:52] but God preserved those gifts amen
[47:56] because God gives must find their places
[48:01] and we find that when they came
[48:04] they came to the headquarters of
[48:06] Jerusalem
[48:08] trying out where is he
[48:09] born King of the Jews where is he the
[48:13] king of the Jews went to every street
[48:15] going through every alley and nobody
[48:17] knew nothing
[48:19] until it is caught the attention of
[48:21] Ellen and yet it will call all the
[48:23] priests and so forth
[48:26] those that study the law
[48:28] and they brought the books
[48:30] and they found
[48:32] that in a place called Bethlehem
[48:35] amen
[48:37] amen Christ shall be born amen
[48:41] and in the message why Bethlehem the
[48:44] prophet said Bethlehem stands for the
[48:46] house of God's bread
[48:49] and he was the bread of God brought down
[48:51] from heaven amen
[48:54] hmm
[48:56] so we find that every even a place even
[48:59] the name of the play even the place had
[49:00] a symbolic meaning yes amen
[49:04] and that's what the same place and you
[49:07] know David also type Christ
[49:09] David were one day when he was longing
[49:11] for water
[49:13] from Bethlehem because Bethlehem is
[49:15] where you go and with the sheep and
[49:17] things like that one day when he's
[49:19] thirsty and he wants some good water
[49:21] thinking about the water from Bethlehem
[49:27] Warriors there is a was faithful to the
[49:31] king
[49:32] they knew that this King needed this and
[49:33] we have to bring it because they was
[49:36] giving their service to the king
[49:42] but there were garrisoned they will
[49:43] upset the way
[49:46] to get that water amen but nothing will
[49:49] stop them amen amen they will go and
[49:52] possess the gates of the enemy because
[49:54] they have to bring this to David's
[49:57] but when you bring it David said how can
[50:00] I drink this now and he gives it as a
[50:02] sacrifice to God
[50:07] how will we coming to this world
[50:10] to get to get to the house of God's
[50:12] bread how the denomination try to keep
[50:15] us away
[50:16] how they try to get us away from this
[50:19] word of God yeah to try to Kill the
[50:22] Messenger
[50:25] speak bad about the messenger
[50:27] call this message account and so forth
[50:29] yeah you can kill the messenger but you
[50:32] can't kill the message amen
[50:35] a message will find his way yes amen
[50:38] because this is not a message that comes
[50:40] from a man just come down from God Amen
[50:44] this comes down from the articles of the
[50:46] most thy God yes amen
[50:51] amen
[50:52] seven angels brought down this message
[50:54] come and beat come through the time
[50:57] barrier yes that's why there was such a
[50:59] loud noise because it broke the sound
[51:00] barrier amen They Come From Another
[51:03] Dimension come with this message through
[51:06] a prophet because the word of the Lord
[51:07] must come through a prophets and come
[51:09] and deliver it to us amen
[51:13] and we find that here comes
[51:17] this major is
[51:19] they come to Earth
[51:21] and you know what he asked him let's go
[51:23] to Matthew
[51:39] chapter 2 reading from verse 1.
[51:46] now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[51:49] Judea in the days of Herod the king
[51:50] behold became wise men from the East to
[51:53] Jerusalem saying crazy that is born King
[51:57] of the Jews
[51:58] for we have City star in the east and I
[52:02] come to worship Him
[52:05] when Herod the king had heard this thing
[52:06] he was troubled and all Jerusalem with
[52:09] him
[52:09] and when he had gathered all the chief
[52:12] priests and scribes of the people
[52:13] together he demanded them where Christ
[52:16] should be born and they said unto him in
[52:18] Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is
[52:21] written by the prophet
[52:23] and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah
[52:26] are not art not the least among the
[52:29] princes of Judah for all of thee shall
[52:32] come a governor that shall rule My
[52:34] People Israel
[52:36] and every 20th privately called the wise
[52:39] men inquired of them diligently what
[52:41] time the star appears see what he's
[52:43] asking him what time the star appeared
[52:48] because there's a reason for him to ask
[52:50] what time because he don't know how the
[52:52] child is already born so he wants to
[52:54] know when exactly was this that they
[52:56] noticed to stop
[53:00] and he sent them to Bethlehem and said
[53:02] go and search diligently for the young
[53:04] see that's saying a baby see what he's
[53:06] saying yes after he found out what time
[53:08] the star appeared he's saying now he
[53:10] said go and search diligently for the
[53:13] young child yes
[53:15] and when you have found him bring me
[53:18] word again that I may come and worship
[53:20] him also
[53:22] and when they had heard the king they
[53:24] departed and know the star which they
[53:26] saw in the East went before them until
[53:30] he came out and saw the star again now
[53:32] until he came and stood over where the
[53:35] young child was
[53:36] when they saw the star the Rejoice with
[53:39] exceeding great joy and when they were
[53:42] coming to the alt they saw the young
[53:43] child would marry his mother and fell
[53:45] down and worshiped him
[53:48] and when they had opened their Treasures
[53:51] they presented unto him gifts gold and
[53:55] frankincense and myrrh and being one of
[53:58] God in a dream
[54:00] you see they were led by God first yes
[54:04] and now God is speaking to them in a
[54:06] dream
[54:07] that they should not return to Herod
[54:09] they departed into their own country
[54:12] another way
[54:16] so stop there
[54:19] so you see what happened here Ellen is
[54:22] asking him what time it is so when what
[54:23] time they supposed to stop
[54:25] and therefore it gives a decree
[54:28] that all those from two years and under
[54:30] must be killed
[54:32] but you'll find that
[54:35] immediately after that in from verse 13
[54:38] when they Departed the angel of the Lord
[54:40] appeared to Joseph
[54:42] because God is always preserving his
[54:44] gifts to amen amen
[54:47] you can never until your work on Earth
[54:50] is done
[54:52] God will always preserve your life yes
[54:57] and if God wants to speak a word to his
[55:00] church he will bring that gift through
[55:02] his faithful Ministry yes
[55:05] and nothing will stop that word from
[55:06] coming forth amen
[55:08] IA no matter how many Islams May Come
[55:11] no matter how much theology may come in
[55:13] a message in the word
[55:14] God will still find a way to bring his
[55:17] words
[55:18] he will preserve that gift yes and will
[55:21] keep that gift in line with what he
[55:24] wants done with his word
[55:26] amen amen they have to be a balance in
[55:29] the world
[55:31] we cannot come and present our own
[55:33] Gospel yes we've got to present the
[55:35] gospel the way it's supposed to be
[55:38] just like in the days of Jesus they
[55:40] couldn't accept the fact why are you
[55:42] coming out of Bethlehem
[55:44] why are they why not from Jerusalem yeah
[55:47] why not from another place why not to
[55:49] the lineage of the Pharisees or the
[55:51] Sadducees
[55:53] why in a Manger
[55:55] why not from the high priest Palace
[55:59] why not from herod's Palace
[56:02] but scripture had to be fulfilled
[56:06] you have to come to the lineage of David
[56:08] amen and if you follow that lineage
[56:13] Ray of theology is involved in there
[56:15] [Music]
[56:17] look at that
[56:18] you think now
[56:20] you're looking at that the prophet said
[56:22] that girl maybe because of ungodly
[56:25] parents because of a little beauty that
[56:27] you had and you get some money must have
[56:29] put out in the streets
[56:32] because of a condition that you were
[56:34] living in they had to put out on the
[56:36] street because of a pretty face
[56:38] but the same girl will save her parents
[56:41] people of her faith
[56:44] amen because when Jericho was about to
[56:46] be destroyed
[56:48] and everyone was shaking within
[56:50] themselves
[56:51] fear fell upon the people she said
[56:54] she preserved those five amen
[56:58] he preserved the spices saved them and
[57:01] they would in return to save her and the
[57:02] family
[57:04] and because she was chosen to be in the
[57:07] same linen yeah the Christ will come
[57:09] amen amen but God works in mischievous
[57:13] yes you might say yourself
[57:15] I'm not the popular people of the world
[57:19] I'm a little nobody
[57:23] oh I don't go to the popular Church they
[57:27] got big names in the message
[57:29] big creatures
[57:31] preaching big things
[57:33] and you expect to hear
[57:37] Revolution coming out from there
[57:40] but God can work in a little room amen
[57:42] that's when when the Seven Seals was
[57:45] being preached the prophet was in a
[57:47] little room
[57:48] night after night the angel would come
[57:50] yes
[57:52] preparing the seals not knowing
[57:55] what the seals was at that time but he's
[57:56] preparing his message
[57:58] and the angel will come and reveal it to
[58:00] him amen revelation after revelation
[58:05] don't look at things the things of God
[58:08] the way man looks at it amen amen amen
[58:11] God works in Simplicity Hallelujah
[58:13] rather be faithful than what God has put
[58:15] unto you
[58:17] and don't look at it like the way man
[58:20] look at it yes yes amen because God
[58:22] don't work in the victory
[58:25] God doesn't work in a pump
[58:29] now you're fine people are getting ready
[58:31] for the big Christmas services big
[58:32] Cathedral
[58:34] beautiful
[58:35] musicians beautiful orchestras
[58:39] all those things
[58:41] speaking about Jesus singing beautiful
[58:43] songs you couldn't pick a fault with the
[58:46] keys the cling you couldn't be a speaker
[58:48] pick a form with a voice
[58:52] but Christ is not in it because it's not
[58:55] on the church they left him outside the
[58:57] church yes amen
[59:00] but God gives always find their dreams
[59:03] amen
[59:05] beat in a little room
[59:07] beat out there beat on a one-to-one
[59:09] evangelism and God gives final places
[59:12] yes amen
[59:17] and we find that
[59:19] the wise men when the Lord spoke to them
[59:21] in a dream they went away they went
[59:26] another way
[59:27] the origin of the degree they decree to
[59:30] kill the children
[59:32] but
[59:33] Joseph and Mary was instructed to live
[59:35] amen God had to preserve the gift
[59:39] now we know what happened in our day
[59:42] once again when the stars were aligned
[59:46] once again when the stars were aligned
[59:51] on April the 6th 1909
[59:53] God's Prophet was born amen the pull of
[59:56] fire nothing for thousand years was back
[59:58] on the Earth again amen
[1:00:01] back on the Earth again
[1:00:03] because why now God will show that his
[1:00:06] work of redemption is still going on
[1:00:08] he didn't stop at Calvary
[1:00:10] amen they come to do the work of
[1:00:12] redemption now is a time where he's
[1:00:14] coming to put claim upon those that He
[1:00:17] redeemed but he must come and work
[1:00:19] through a prophet amen
[1:00:22] and the life that could have been taken
[1:00:24] away right there in the snow
[1:00:25] right there in the cabin
[1:00:27] when his mother Adam the cabin there
[1:00:29] with no food no fire
[1:00:32] somehow the neighbor will see this this
[1:00:34] house no smoke is coming up there let me
[1:00:37] go get him some wood let me get him some
[1:00:38] food
[1:00:39] and preserve the life amen amen God's
[1:00:42] gifts will always find other places yes
[1:00:45] and then this Prophet will go along his
[1:00:47] journey and we know what happened
[1:00:50] along the journey
[1:00:52] he loses his daughter he loses his wife
[1:00:55] and he decides to shoot himself
[1:00:58] and the gun wouldn't go off
[1:01:01] decides to blow up his brain that he
[1:01:03] wouldn't go up but yet when he shoot it
[1:01:04] again
[1:01:05] goes off
[1:01:07] then he goes to Electric pole one day
[1:01:10] try to electrocute himself
[1:01:13] and on that type of current he would
[1:01:15] have been dead instantly he'd been fried
[1:01:17] up
[1:01:18] but God preserved his life
[1:01:21] and the gift said to go around the world
[1:01:25] it was rejected but he had to be stored
[1:01:27] up or would you season
[1:01:30] and in due season the Holy Ghost will
[1:01:32] come
[1:01:33] and reignite that word
[1:01:35] and bring it back and God always works
[1:01:38] with men when you speak about the Holy
[1:01:39] Ghost the Holy Ghost is working through
[1:01:41] men
[1:01:43] the Holy Ghost just come there and work
[1:01:45] the Holy Ghost is that speak he's
[1:01:47] speaking with man
[1:01:49] and now he brings that faithful ministry
[1:01:51] will read
[1:01:52] that same word
[1:01:55] you bring it in the present truth
[1:01:59] and it'll make sense of it amen amen
[1:02:01] guess what the faithful ministry will do
[1:02:04] make sense of it
[1:02:05] but God had to preserve is how did God
[1:02:08] bring about
[1:02:09] foreign
[1:02:12] this word was thrown up the prophet is
[1:02:13] not on the scene yeah how would men
[1:02:16] young men take this word without the
[1:02:18] prophet being there to interpret that
[1:02:20] word now amen
[1:02:21] to explain to them that word you just
[1:02:23] stood up and they took it and they
[1:02:25] studied it and they began to preach amen
[1:02:27] because why this is the Holy Ghost word
[1:02:30] yes amen
[1:02:32] because we know that somebody is here
[1:02:34] the angel of God is yeah amen working
[1:02:37] amongst the people amen
[1:02:42] and we can say today we have seen the
[1:02:44] stuff and we've come to worship him yes
[1:02:47] amen we recognize
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:51] the super sign in this day
[1:02:54] we recognize his presence in this day
[1:02:56] and we have come to worship Him
[1:02:58] amen and we find that God has come there
[1:03:03] and Christ has come and he's come to
[1:03:05] redeem mankind
[1:03:08] he says that's the reason that God does
[1:03:10] nothing outside of a man he always works
[1:03:12] through a man because he has to use a
[1:03:14] man
[1:03:15] and man is what he had to use to display
[1:03:18] attribute of Savior
[1:03:20] he had to make him in his image make him
[1:03:23] something like him and put him on a free
[1:03:25] model agency and let him act any way he
[1:03:27] wanted to
[1:03:29] he could take his choice
[1:03:31] and he knew that man by giving him the
[1:03:33] choice would fall
[1:03:34] so being that he had to do that he
[1:03:37] turned back around and makes the man a
[1:03:39] partner to him
[1:03:41] and does nothing except he does it to
[1:03:44] amen amen amen so God wants to work now
[1:03:49] he still wants to do his work but he
[1:03:51] wants us
[1:03:52] he can do nothing except he does it to a
[1:03:55] man and now always doing it through a
[1:03:57] many-membled body
[1:03:59] you have to see God in the now amen you
[1:04:02] can't look at him two thousand years in
[1:04:03] the manger yeah you have to look at him
[1:04:05] how he's been working all these years
[1:04:08] how is use man is your seven Church
[1:04:11] eight Messengers you call the people out
[1:04:13] amen and to the last message the message
[1:04:17] of last day we've been called out yes
[1:04:18] amen and God is alive working amongst us
[1:04:22] amen amen amen the savior of mankind
[1:04:26] he's working through man the Creator
[1:04:28] himself working in his creation amen
[1:04:31] amen hallelujah and he's working through
[1:04:34] us and he's got us to be partner with
[1:04:36] him now amen amen the things that he
[1:04:39] wants done he uses us to get it done
[1:04:41] amen amen
[1:04:46] if he wants somebody to be saved you've
[1:04:48] got to go and preach the gospel
[1:04:50] amen you've got to go and present the
[1:04:53] gospel to them he's going to use you
[1:04:55] how are they going to be saved except
[1:04:57] someone goes except how can people be
[1:05:00] safe except someone be sent forth and
[1:05:02] how can and when they go for what they
[1:05:04] have to do preach the gospel
[1:05:07] the whole work of Redemption come by man
[1:05:10] Hallelujah get come by the first man
[1:05:13] life come by the second Adam
[1:05:16] there you are he does nothing because he
[1:05:18] had to use a man for that
[1:05:20] then he uses a man to redeem back again
[1:05:24] so deity
[1:05:27] Jehovah is deity and become a child yes
[1:05:31] I don't know how much more clear we need
[1:05:33] to bring it to the people Jehovah become
[1:05:37] a child
[1:05:38] he become in the form of sin that he
[1:05:41] might redeem The Sinner
[1:05:43] there's the whole thing
[1:05:48] but we find that in every age God's gift
[1:05:52] is always rejected
[1:05:54] but it find this place
[1:05:56] amen his gift will always be rejected if
[1:05:59] it happened in the days of Jesus
[1:06:03] it had to happen in the days of the
[1:06:04] prophet if it happened in the days of
[1:06:06] the Prophet it has to happen now
[1:06:09] because
[1:06:10] if you are
[1:06:12] they are carrying out Christ's mandate
[1:06:16] then you will not be popular in the
[1:06:19] Earth
[1:06:20] you will lose your popularity
[1:06:22] if you are popular amongst the people of
[1:06:24] the world and there's something wrong
[1:06:25] with you
[1:06:26] because you have
[1:06:28] basically you have to be the oddball
[1:06:30] because everything about us
[1:06:33] he's from another world Amen remember
[1:06:35] Jesus said father as it is in heaven so
[1:06:38] let it be on earth
[1:06:41] now
[1:06:43] our thinking is not thinking of this
[1:06:46] nature
[1:06:47] our thinking is from a different place
[1:06:50] amen we are now seated in Heavenly
[1:06:52] places in Christ Jesus in other words
[1:06:54] our thinking is different from Men
[1:06:57] our thinking is different from the
[1:06:58] scientific man
[1:07:00] we have a faith civilization
[1:07:03] when they are in doubt when they are
[1:07:05] negative about the things you are
[1:07:06] talking about faith
[1:07:08] when they are in depressed and they
[1:07:10] don't know what to do you are rejoicing
[1:07:12] you think praise the Lord God Will Make
[1:07:15] A Way
[1:07:17] when they don't know what to do about
[1:07:18] the situation you have an answer yes
[1:07:20] because you're thinking your nature is
[1:07:23] different amen your makeup is different
[1:07:25] amen that is why if you got the Holy
[1:07:27] Ghost you cannot go to a place and
[1:07:30] remain in sin
[1:07:32] your your own digest it
[1:07:35] your makeup wouldn't digest that place
[1:07:39] but you find that God gift has always
[1:07:41] been projected
[1:07:43] he was rejected from the days of Jesus
[1:07:45] they couldn't accept it nicotibles came
[1:07:48] to Jesus and said surely Rabbi the thou
[1:07:51] art a man sent from God be with you
[1:07:53] because no man can do this thing except
[1:07:55] God be with him so he recognize it
[1:07:57] firstly Miracles the devil can't do it
[1:08:01] you recognize Jesus is doing all his
[1:08:04] medical God has to be with him
[1:08:06] so you recognize God is with him then
[1:08:09] why are you even debating why are you
[1:08:11] even reasoning
[1:08:12] you're saying that William Branham did
[1:08:15] all his miracles I mean God did all his
[1:08:17] miracles to William Branham that he was
[1:08:19] a prophet sent from God
[1:08:21] so you saw that God is with him
[1:08:23] then what is your issue I'm not
[1:08:25] believing what he's saying
[1:08:27] because if God is not good if God is not
[1:08:29] going to do all this miracles
[1:08:33] he said to your Nicodemus
[1:08:35] say unto you
[1:08:37] no matter what surely surely I say unto
[1:08:39] you
[1:08:40] except you'll be born again
[1:08:42] you cannot inherit the king you cannot
[1:08:45] see the kingdom of God
[1:08:47] he's saying old man like me how can I go
[1:08:50] back to my mother alone so you think he
[1:08:52] currently already now
[1:08:53] so when you thought when you talk about
[1:08:55] the Rapture now a body chain
[1:08:57] the other thing about Canada how are you
[1:08:59] gonna have a body change
[1:09:00] in your whole body How Are You Gonna
[1:09:02] Change
[1:09:08] that's right
[1:09:12] how are you going to have a body change
[1:09:15] you see they don't really understand
[1:09:17] God's Plan of Redemption
[1:09:21] but he said to Nicodemus you must be
[1:09:23] born again there's no Shortcuts To
[1:09:25] Heaven
[1:09:27] unfortunately your good gifts your good
[1:09:29] works is not going to take you to heaven
[1:09:31] unfortunately coming to a messy Church
[1:09:35] that believe this message is not going
[1:09:37] to take you to heaven
[1:09:39] you're going to have to be born again
[1:09:42] you're gonna have to have the nature
[1:09:44] change
[1:09:45] there must be a change within you
[1:09:47] because the same creator
[1:09:49] died for his creation amen
[1:09:52] the creator of life
[1:09:54] formed his own creation to come live
[1:09:56] with his creation and die for his
[1:09:58] creation amen
[1:10:00] now
[1:10:01] he did all that but for you not to go
[1:10:04] back to live with your creator
[1:10:06] you got to now accept what you've done
[1:10:08] for you yes
[1:10:10] because
[1:10:11] it didn't just come to be born in the
[1:10:13] manger
[1:10:14] he come to die
[1:10:16] why did he die because in life his life
[1:10:20] the animal sacrifice was temporary but
[1:10:23] now the blood
[1:10:24] the chemistry died up but his life the
[1:10:27] life of his blood must be in you
[1:10:30] his life must come in you
[1:10:32] which is his old Spirit he the Holy
[1:10:34] Ghost
[1:10:35] to come and live in you to guide you to
[1:10:38] navigate you
[1:10:41] amen amen now people want
[1:10:45] now he said these wise men bringing the
[1:10:48] gift identify the gifts identified what
[1:10:51] it was that's the reason God protect
[1:10:53] those gifts
[1:10:54] through every move they made he
[1:10:57] protected it until they arrived in those
[1:10:59] gifts see nothing could take away those
[1:11:01] gifts from him they couldn't have been
[1:11:03] wrong for it because God would have
[1:11:04] preserve them the angels of God came
[1:11:07] down and preserved him
[1:11:10] he protected it until they arrived with
[1:11:12] his gifts because they were footing for
[1:11:13] the time
[1:11:15] Do you have a
[1:11:17] if you are called of God to present this
[1:11:20] message nothing will stop you from
[1:11:22] presenting this message amen God will
[1:11:25] preserve it until it's presented yes
[1:11:27] amen he will preserve those gifts
[1:11:31] people might have stifled you
[1:11:34] people are going to stand for your
[1:11:36] ministry people may have stifle you from
[1:11:38] talking you might have tried to shut you
[1:11:40] up
[1:11:42] for many years but there come a time
[1:11:45] God would make sure
[1:11:47] the dead voice will speak out amen God
[1:11:51] will make sure that that body is used
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:54] that mouth those vocals are used nothing
[1:11:58] can nothing can stifle that
[1:12:01] because why God checks his gifts
[1:12:04] amen
[1:12:07] he said he protected it until they
[1:12:09] arrived will give because they were
[1:12:11] fitting for the time
[1:12:14] that's what's going on now hope it ain't
[1:12:16] over your head I have to speak it
[1:12:18] incredible
[1:12:19] you sing
[1:12:21] he says but you see it's the thing that
[1:12:23] happening is fitting for this day let us
[1:12:25] here it's the footing time the Reason
[1:12:27] God has protected it see brought it
[1:12:30] right through to identify himself gift
[1:12:33] though it caused the death put a
[1:12:35] stumbling block in their way it's a
[1:12:37] footing time that's right footing for
[1:12:39] the day that's the reason God has
[1:12:41] protected it the way he will protect it
[1:12:44] until his purpose is served amen amen so
[1:12:48] in all things God purpose must be served
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:54] so you find today that people might have
[1:12:57] this celebration
[1:12:59] they might have only Santa Claus we know
[1:13:02] the history of Death From First Single
[1:13:04] giving gifts and all that and now they
[1:13:06] made it a thing now they made it a
[1:13:10] like Santa Claus in some kind of a fairy
[1:13:12] tale thing which is not even true
[1:13:14] life with the children
[1:13:18] and we know that we know all the Pagan
[1:13:20] celebrations included
[1:13:22] are nothing about Christ
[1:13:25] for we thank God that we could receive
[1:13:27] Christ amen like Mary we said be not to
[1:13:30] me
[1:13:31] according to Thy Word
[1:13:33] but there has to come a time when
[1:13:35] there's a press upon the people
[1:13:37] they had to become there's a coming of
[1:13:39] squeezing time
[1:13:40] a time where economic crisis as you can
[1:13:42] see the taxes are increasing
[1:13:44] taxation is increasing
[1:13:46] a time of economic crisis
[1:13:50] and in that time
[1:13:52] and it's coming in about a time where
[1:13:55] Christ must be manifested amen amen you
[1:13:58] receive Christ
[1:13:59] but there must be a manifestation
[1:14:03] it's good enough that you will conceive
[1:14:04] Christ when you receive the word
[1:14:07] you conceive of the Holy One when you
[1:14:09] receive the word
[1:14:10] but there must be a manifestation yes
[1:14:14] there must be a Church of God with the
[1:14:17] move of God upon the Earth Greater Works
[1:14:19] indeed shall you do amen there must be a
[1:14:22] book of Acts again yes upon the Earth
[1:14:25] and when it is happening in the time of
[1:14:28] pressure in a time of squeezing just
[1:14:31] before the manifestation amen of Christ
[1:14:34] again they must be that manifest in time
[1:14:37] yes it's not it's going to be
[1:14:40] implemented it's good to be glowing
[1:14:42] but there has to be the manifestation
[1:14:44] amen must be the manifestation of the
[1:14:46] word
[1:14:47] and God has preserved that gift all
[1:14:50] these years amen they've been scoffers
[1:14:52] coughing out of
[1:14:54] the other gift has been preserved but
[1:14:56] the hour is coming when the third pull
[1:14:58] will be in effect yes amen
[1:15:01] amen
[1:15:03] you believe that yes amen
[1:15:06] see what he says

[1:16:51] whole creation was lost everything was
[1:16:53] gone it all belonged to Satan we felt
[1:16:56] heir to it he still owns it he certainly
[1:16:58] does that's the reason we're fighting
[1:17:00] and having all this trouble he controls
[1:17:03] every Kingdom Satan does every
[1:17:06] government every King every Kingdom
[1:17:08] controlled by Satan the old world is
[1:17:11] controlled and run by Satan that's the
[1:17:13] reason we have the troubles that we have
[1:17:16] any Bible student or anything can tell
[1:17:18] you
[1:17:19] that Satan well the Bible itself says he
[1:17:22] did see then he controls the world
[1:17:24] that's why he could offered it to Jesus
[1:17:26] but Christ will fall heir to it for now

[1:17:32] whole creation
[1:17:34] and nothing could do it but God himself
[1:17:37] amen amen amen and we find in this day

[1:17:45] work amen there is just too many that
[1:17:49] Christ have done the work of redemption
[1:17:51] because from the grave amen he goes down
[1:17:54] to Hell

[1:17:57] grave amen and now comes again to claim
[1:18:00] those that He redeemed
[1:18:02] what the open book

[1:18:07] could see all of his word amen amen was
[1:18:10] closed up yes part of redemption was
