[15:40] that if you get the people to believe
[15:41] you not even cancer will be able to
[15:44] stand in your way
[15:45] amen and he said do you fear cancer and

[15:53] god amen and any virus he told us
[15:56] those were demon powers amen those were
[15:58] imps that come to afflict us

[16:03] of our lord and favor jesus

[17:02] amen
[17:06] amen god bless you greet you all in the
[17:08] precious name of our lord and savior
[17:10] jesus christ
[17:12] kind of unusual circumstances we just
[17:13] got a small team here just myself
[17:16] trying to operate this morning and we
[17:18] envisioned the service to be a bit
[17:19] different today we were going to have
[17:21] our church here in function
[17:23] but due to the outbreak of the virus we
[17:26] couldn't gather together we thought it
[17:27] would be safer to close the church
[17:29] amen but be happy to have with us amen
[17:31] my father-in-law my daddy
[17:35] mr pat nicholson that's here with us
[17:36] this morning and he was scheduled to
[17:38] preach with us
[17:39] and he willingly obliged amen we could
[17:41] have easily played a
[17:42] message but he says no you'll preach
[17:45] this morning
[17:46] to bless the saints so i know many of
[17:48] you are taken up with the virus or you
[17:50] have a family member
[17:51] close loved one that's taken up with a
[17:53] virus we just want to encourage you that
[17:55] god is not taken by any surprises
[17:59] you know we hear many times about it's
[18:01] maybe said in jest or
[18:02] a joke about people coming to the pearly
[18:05] gates of heaven and peter greeting them
[18:07] at the polling gates
[18:08] want you to know that any of the loved
[18:10] ones that have gone on
[18:12] heaven was not taken by surprise
[18:15] amen the virus did not take god by
[18:18] surprise neither did he take heaven by
[18:19] surprise
[18:20] amen the bible says to everything
[18:22] there's a season
[18:24] to everything there's a purpose amen
[18:26] there's a time under the sun
[18:27] amen a time to be born a time to die a
[18:30] time to love a time to rejoice
[18:32] so this morning amen even as we come
[18:34] into the house of the lord and you've
[18:35] gathered there with your families
[18:37] our prayer will be strengthened even as
[18:39] we sang that song i'm no longer
[18:41] a slave to fear amen the prophet of god
[18:44] told us
[18:45] that job's faith would have kept him
[18:47] from it but his fear
[18:49] brought him to it amen so what be
[18:52] encouraged this morning
[18:53] do not have any fear do not have any
[18:56] doubt
[18:57] amen because the blood of the lord jesus
[18:59] christ still avails
[19:00] us there is still power in the cleansing
[19:03] blood of our lord and savior jesus
[19:04] christ amen
[19:06] so you strengthen yourself this morning
[19:08] even as you hear the word of the lord
[19:09] being preached
[19:10] you strengthen yourself you draw upon
[19:13] the word of the lord
[19:14] and remember this is the time when faith
[19:16] matters
[19:17] when you're going through your worst
[19:18] trials this is the time for your test
[19:20] to see where your faith will be injured
[19:23] upon
[19:24] so even as we hand over the service now
[19:26] to pastor pat nicholson
[19:28] as he comes and shares the word of the
[19:30] lord with us we pray that you will be
[19:32] blessed this morning
[19:33] be encouraged amen and just rejoice with
[19:36] the word of god
[19:37] amen
[19:53] [Music]

[20:18] so
[20:24] good morning friends and saints
[20:29] i reach in the lovely name of our lord
[20:31] and savior jesus christ it's a
[20:34] wonderful privilege to be back in
[20:36] phoenix
[20:37] durban and just to
[20:41] enjoy fellowship with
[20:44] family grandchildren
[20:48] my daughter and son grandson
[20:52] and it's just that we
[20:56] can't have enough fellowship with those
[20:58] that are
[20:59] sick and quarantined we think on those
[21:03] especially and i'd like to pray and ask
[21:06] the lord's
[21:07] blessing upon those that are sick as we
[21:10] will pray here this morning and trust
[21:12] that god
[21:13] will certainly bless you as we
[21:17] gather around the word of god
[21:20] so before anything else
[21:24] we'd like to just power heads and close
[21:26] our eyes and trust the lord to
[21:29] accompany us as we move along in the
[21:32] service
[21:34] of the lord as we are in service to him
[21:38] heavenly father we come before you in
[21:40] the lovely name of the lord jesus christ
[21:43] we are blessed
[21:45] to know that you are the same yesterday
[21:48] today and forever the unchanging god
[21:51] and we understand that
[21:54] there's nothing that we need but you are
[21:57] all
[21:58] our sufficiency we are all that we need
[22:01] of god
[22:03] so i thank you that we think and our
[22:06] precious pastor ronnie his
[22:08] precious wife we ask that your merciful
[22:12] hand will be upon them
[22:13] and that grace will abound to the extent
[22:16] that
[22:17] they will come out strong healed
[22:20] because it's a finished work of god and
[22:23] that's why i pray
[22:25] across the ether waves that you will
[22:27] bless
[22:28] everyone that are needy knowing your god
[22:32] that
[22:32] the doctors can't help the medical
[22:36] fraternity
[22:37] might be at what's end but we believe
[22:40] that you are the same
[22:42] jesus the same yesterday today and
[22:44] forever and we look to a finished work
[22:46] as moses raised up the brazen serpent
[22:49] in the wilderness we can look to calvary
[22:53] because you were lifted up lifted up on
[22:56] high between heavens and earth
[22:58] and now we can look and live we can look
[23:00] and be
[23:01] healed we can look and know that we will
[23:03] be saturated
[23:04] with those healing virtues of god and
[23:08] may we just
[23:08] touch you not by the hem of your garment
[23:11] but we will touch you father god by the
[23:15] feeling of our infirmities and know that
[23:17] when we touch you
[23:19] we are touched in a way that we can
[23:21] rejoice like a cough
[23:23] and just spring lord and jump and
[23:27] for joy and knowing that you've done the
[23:29] work in our lives
[23:30] we look we don't look at circumstances
[23:33] we don't look at
[23:34] what we feel but we look at the promised
[23:37] word of god and you cannot fail
[23:40] upon your word lord we come by faith
[23:43] and we come upon those virtues of your
[23:46] blood that was shed for us
[23:49] it's upon the doorpost of our heart it's
[23:51] upon the lintel
[23:52] of our heart it drops down lord to the
[23:55] dust
[23:56] that from which we are taken and in the
[23:58] name of
[23:59] jesus christ we pray we commit the
[24:02] pastor lord his wife
[24:04] under the blood we speak her god like
[24:07] the blood of
[24:07] abel and knowing lord that we have
[24:11] a finnish word right now we believe lord
[24:14] we don't look to what the enemy shows us
[24:17] we don't look to what the doctor shows
[24:20] us
[24:21] we look to calvary we look to the hill
[24:24] far away and know that you've done it
[24:26] lord
[24:27] we agree as touching knowing that we are
[24:30] more than two here this morning
[24:32] we are more than two on the ether waves
[24:35] we come against the power of the enemy
[24:37] and say
[24:37] satan release the children of god
[24:42] leave them in jesus name for the power
[24:45] of god
[24:46] to saturate their lives for the power of
[24:49] god to come in
[24:51] anoint him right now father in jesus
[24:55] name every household has the blood
[24:58] right now we know the enemy would like
[25:01] to say
[25:02] we don't have it but we have it by faith
[25:05] we have the blood
[25:06] by faith we have our healing by faith we
[25:10] know
[25:10] we are delivered in jesus name
[25:14] in jesus name in the name of the lord
[25:17] and savior
[25:18] he saved us from the power of the plague
[25:21] he saved israel
[25:22] in the time of egypt he saved us
[25:25] in this day by his own blood we thank
[25:28] you lord
[25:29] we praise you we give you glory
[25:32] and we know we are healed in jesus name
[25:37] in the name of jesus christ we thank you
[25:41] father
[25:42] may those virtues flow into every home
[25:45] right now we know it's a work that's
[25:48] already done
[25:50] accepted by faith right now and i
[25:54] believe it
[25:55] if you believe it you can have that what
[25:58] you desire
[25:59] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[26:02] amen
[26:03] amen and the church says amen wherever
[26:06] you are
[26:08] hallelujah satan
[26:11] is defeated amen by the very mentioning
[26:15] of the name
[26:16] jesus christ so we don't have to
[26:19] backtrack
[26:20] we don't have to think on anything that
[26:23] we have lost
[26:24] but we know that greater is he that's
[26:27] within us
[26:28] than he that's within the world
[26:32] so i greet the pastor
[26:36] i agreed his precious wife
[26:40] that we could not meet physically but
[26:44] trust that god will certainly undergird
[26:48] our love and that he will carry us
[26:51] through
[26:53] these troublesome times and
[26:56] we believe that god is in control
[27:00] amen it seems like it's chaotic out
[27:03] there
[27:04] it seems like there's no remedy
[27:08] but god is in control
[27:11] if we can believe all things are
[27:13] possible
[27:14] to them that believe i'd like to
[27:19] invite your attention to the book of
[27:22] luke chapter 2
[27:23] and also the book of saint john chapter
[27:26] 10
[27:28] and i can read it
[27:35] we can just have the fan maybe
[27:39] just go past me maybe
[27:43] it's just blowing
[27:47] so luke chapter 2
[27:50] we can read
[27:56] and it came to pass in those days that
[27:59] they went out
[28:00] a decree from caesar augustus that
[28:03] all the world should be taxed and this
[28:06] taxing was first made when
[28:08] cyrenius was governor of syria and all
[28:11] went to be taxed
[28:12] everyone into his own city and
[28:15] joseph also went up from galilee
[28:18] out of the city of nazareth
[28:21] into judea unto the city of david which
[28:25] is
[28:26] called bethlehem because he was of the
[28:29] house and lineage of david
[28:32] so he was to be taxed with mary's his
[28:34] past wife being great
[28:36] with child and so it was that
[28:39] while they were there the days were
[28:41] accomplished that she should be
[28:42] delivered
[28:44] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[28:47] and wrapped him in spotlight clothes and
[28:50] laid him in a manger because there was
[28:52] no room
[28:53] for them in the inn and they were in the
[28:57] same country
[28:58] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[29:00] watch over their flock by night
[29:03] and lo the angel of the lord came upon
[29:06] them
[29:07] and the glory of the lord shone round
[29:10] above them
[29:11] and they were so afraid and the angel
[29:14] said unto them fear not
[29:16] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[29:20] great joy which shall be to all people
[29:23] amen so unto you is born
[29:26] this day in the city of david a savior
[29:30] which is christ the lord and
[29:34] this shall be a sign unto you you
[29:37] shall find the babe wrapped in sweating
[29:41] clothes
[29:41] lying in a manger and suddenly
[29:44] there was with the angel a multitude
[29:48] of the heavenly host praising and saying
[29:52] glory to god in the highest amen
[29:55] and on earth peace good will toward men
[30:00] and it came to pass as the angels were
[30:02] gone away
[30:03] from them into heaven the shepherds said
[30:06] one to another
[30:08] let us now go even unto bethlehem and
[30:12] see
[30:12] this thing which has come to pass which
[30:15] the
[30:16] lord hath made known unto us
[30:19] amen and they came with the with haste
[30:22] and found mary and joseph and the babe
[30:26] lying in a manger and when they had seen
[30:29] it they made known abroad
[30:32] the same which was told them concerning
[30:35] this child and saying john chapter 10
[30:44] and verse 11
[30:48] i would have liked to read but due to
[30:49] time constraints we just want to
[30:52] hit the high spots and trust the lord
[30:55] that he will be the officer speaker of
[30:57] his word as we read
[30:59] verse 11 says in john chapter 10
[31:03] i am the good shepherd the good shepherd
[31:07] give thee's life for the sheep
[31:10] but he that is an heiling and not the
[31:13] shepherd whose
[31:14] own the sheep are not see at the wolf
[31:18] coming
[31:18] and leave with the sheep and fleet and
[31:21] the wolf catches
[31:23] catches them and scattereth the sheep
[31:27] the highland fleas because he is in
[31:29] hiring and
[31:30] any carrot and carrot not for the sheep
[31:34] i am the good shepherd and know
[31:37] my sheep and am known of mine
[31:40] as the father knoweth me even so
[31:44] no i the father and i laid down
[31:47] my life for the sheep
[31:50] may god bless his precious word
[31:54] and we trust that god will certainly
[31:56] bless
[31:58] our title here this morning which
[32:01] is angels to shepherds
[32:05] amen amen so we
[32:09] understand what uh
[32:12] angel means an angel he is a messenger
[32:16] and you also get the heavenly angels so
[32:19] we
[32:19] believe that god created
[32:25] men formed them out of the dust of the
[32:28] earth
[32:29] and gave us seven stars
[32:34] amen we are so in a starry
[32:37] festive season and this is my
[32:41] christmas message to the church in
[32:43] phoenix
[32:45] and it's maybe not coincidental because
[32:49] we don't believe in coincidences we
[32:51] believe in that the righteous
[32:53] the footsteps of the writers are ordered
[32:56] of the lord
[32:57] and when i looked at my sermon while i
[33:01] was studying
[33:03] and this sermon i was going to preach in
[33:06] b
[33:06] tabernacle but could not
[33:09] for some rhyme or reason could not make
[33:11] it and so this is the first time that
[33:14] i'm preaching this sermon
[33:16] and being a christmas message i trust
[33:19] that god will certainly bless it to your
[33:21] heart
[33:22] and knowing that
[33:27] jesus is the good shepherd
[33:31] and i want to just read a few quotations
[33:34] and believe that
[33:37] we can start preaching
[33:40] this message
[33:49] now the book of james gives us
[33:52] a few tests
[33:57] what christians normally go through
[34:02] and
[34:05] he says james chapter one counted
[34:08] all joy my brothers when you
[34:11] meet trials of various kinds amen
[34:14] hallelujah
[34:16] for you know that the testing of your
[34:19] faith
[34:20] produces steadfastness
[34:23] and let steadfastness have its full
[34:26] effect
[34:27] that you may be perfect and complete
[34:33] lacking in nothing hallelujah
[34:36] that's what god wants us to have
[34:38] abundance
[34:39] amen if any of you lack wisdom
[34:43] let him ask god amen hallelujah
[34:47] he gives generously to all without
[34:50] reproach
[34:51] and it will be given him but let him ask
[34:54] in faith donors thinking oh you know
[34:59] i'm asking but i might not receive it
[35:01] but if you ask in
[35:03] faith you will receive that what you
[35:05] asked for
[35:06] and don't doubt for the one who doubt is
[35:09] like a wave
[35:11] of the sea that is driven and touched by
[35:14] the wind
[35:15] so the wave comes in hallelujah
[35:18] but we find that when our faith is
[35:21] established
[35:22] we can really take god at his word
[35:26] now the book of james goes further for
[35:28] that person
[35:30] must not suppose that he will receive
[35:32] anything from the lord
[35:33] because he's double-minded man unstable
[35:36] in all his ways let the lowly brother
[35:40] boast
[35:40] in his exaltation and the rich in his
[35:44] humiliation because like a flower of the
[35:46] grass
[35:47] he will pass away for the sun rises with
[35:50] its scorching heat
[35:51] and will is the grass its flowers
[35:55] fail and its beauty perishes
[35:58] so also will the rich man fade away in
[36:00] the midst of his pursuits
[36:03] blessed is the man who remains ted falls
[36:05] under proud
[36:06] amen that's the man that we want to
[36:10] speak about this morning
[36:11] amidst all the pandemic and the plague
[36:14] and the
[36:15] negativeness and also the positiveness
[36:19] amen be positive when you are positive
[36:24] hallelujah doesn't matter what happens
[36:27] you are a son of god hallelujah
[36:31] so now we find that
[36:37] when he has stood the test
[36:40] amen that's where we are we stand the
[36:43] test
[36:44] whether we live or die we stand the test
[36:47] say like a hound a man a roaring lion
[36:52] seeking
[36:53] who he can devour and this plane
[36:56] speaks about that lion it speaks about
[36:59] devouring
[37:00] it speaks about death it speaks about
[37:03] meaning
[37:04] it speaks about uh separation
[37:08] hallelujah we've never seen death
[37:10] personified like displayed
[37:13] where it separates husband and wife it
[37:15] separates fathers from their families
[37:18] it separates families from families
[37:21] churches from
[37:22] churches amen states from states worlds
[37:25] from worlds
[37:26] but god is ever present god
[37:29] in a time of trouble he's there when we
[37:32] need him at most
[37:33] hallelujah he is the god of
[37:37] abraham isaac and jacob and he's still
[37:40] the god of the now
[37:42] he's my god hallelujah he's the chief
[37:45] shepherd
[37:46] he's the good shepherd he is the great
[37:49] shepherd
[37:51] oh my and we are a sheep who follow
[37:55] wherever he leads there
[37:58] we have to follow even if it's through
[38:02] death
[38:04] hallelujah so blessed be the man
[38:08] who remains steadfast under trial
[38:12] for when he astute the test he will
[38:14] receive
[38:16] the crown of life which god promised to
[38:19] those who
[38:20] love him do you love the lord i love him
[38:22] with all my heart amen
[38:24] when i speak about his love i
[38:27] just cry and cry and cry because
[38:30] of his goodness towards us his goodness
[38:34] towards me
[38:35] oh then we find that
[38:38] each person should not say that i am
[38:42] being tempted by god
[38:44] for god cannot be tempted with evil amen
[38:48] and he himself tempts no one so don't
[38:50] think that god is tempting us with a
[38:52] plague
[38:54] god is not tempting you all you have to
[38:56] do is believe
[38:57] that he is greater in you than he that's
[39:00] outside
[39:01] than he that's in the atmosphere than he
[39:05] that's on the walls
[39:06] hallelujah he's all that i need
[39:10] amen then each person is tilted when he
[39:14] is
[39:14] lured and enticed
[39:17] by his own desire hallelujah
[39:22] obey the law don't be enticed amen
[39:26] but remember there's one thing that you
[39:28] trust god above
[39:30] everything else amen when death stares
[39:33] in the face
[39:34] then we find that when when a person is
[39:37] tempted
[39:38] each person he's lured and
[39:41] enticed by his own desire then
[39:44] desire when it has conceived
[39:48] it gives birth to sin
[39:52] hallelujah so there is a sowing of the
[39:54] seed
[39:55] remember the battle ground is in the
[39:58] mind
[39:59] that's where fear starts and when fear
[40:02] starts it gives back to sin
[40:06] because conception happens in the mind
[40:11] that's where it does so may god help us
[40:14] to shrug off when the birds fly over the
[40:17] nest
[40:18] we don't let them come and nest we let
[40:21] them fly
[40:22] we shoot them like abraham showed the
[40:25] birds from the carcass as a sacrifice
[40:28] unto god
[40:29] hallelujah so be not deceived
[40:34] that when sin is fully grown it
[40:37] brings forth death that's what sin does
[40:42] amen so do not be deceived my beloved
[40:45] brothers
[40:46] every good gift and every perfect gift
[40:50] is from above amen amen many
[40:53] gifts have gone into this world but we
[40:55] are talking about the perfect kids
[40:58] i'd rather have love than every gift the
[41:01] prophet said
[41:01] amen i rather know you in the power of
[41:05] love and the power of a gift because
[41:08] your gift can take you to hell
[41:10] because you are not born again
[41:14] and there we find that
[41:18] he uh do not be deceived every good gift
[41:22] comes from above coming down from the
[41:23] father of
[41:24] lights we see many lights in this
[41:27] festive season amen but he is the father
[41:32] of light
[41:32] amen with whom there is no variance
[41:35] variation
[41:36] there there's no shadow due to change
[41:40] of his own world he brought us forth
[41:43] it's his will that we are here it's his
[41:45] will that we fight the good fight of
[41:47] faith
[41:48] don't draw back pick up your shield take
[41:51] up your sword
[41:52] fight the good fight of faith put on
[41:54] your singles
[41:55] amend the shard with the preparation you
[41:58] are prepared
[41:59] you are prepared oh yeah you're fighting
[42:02] the good fight of faith don't draw back
[42:05] the best form of defense is attack
[42:09] amen hallelujah
[42:12] come on and speak the word
[42:16] we've read the word we've heard the word
[42:20] it's now time for you to speak it upon
[42:24] your lips that the divine word of god
[42:28] there's divinity right now on your lips
[42:30] as you speak it
[42:32] amen speak not your own word but
[42:35] speak the word of god thus saith the
[42:38] word
[42:39] and that's why we find
[42:42] amen being the father of lights of his
[42:45] own world he brought us forth by the
[42:47] word of truth
[42:49] not a word of denominationalism
[42:52] not a word of doctrine or some kind of
[42:56] an
[42:56] issue that comes out of your mind but
[42:59] it's
[43:00] the issue that comes out of the mind of
[43:02] god and the mind of god is christ
[43:05] hallelujah and then we find that
[43:09] we cannot be a kind of a first fruit
[43:13] of his creatures hearing
[43:16] and doing the word isn't that
[43:20] wonderful that we cannot only hear the
[43:22] word of god but we can
[43:24] do the word because god is not
[43:27] interested in the
[43:28] hearers but more so the ink
[43:31] is interested in the doers of his word
[43:35] be doers of the word and not hearers
[43:37] only deceiving yourselves
[43:39] for if anyone is a year of the word and
[43:41] not a doer
[43:42] he's like a man who looks intently at
[43:45] his interest or at his physique
[43:49] or at his doctrine or at his
[43:52] revelation and when he leaves that he
[43:56] forgets who he is
[43:58] and he loves the way he lives in the
[44:01] world
[44:02] he loves just the way he wants to
[44:04] because his
[44:05] doctrine doesn't match up with his life
[44:08] amen
[44:09] so when your doctrine matches up with
[44:11] your life
[44:12] that's why the prophet says i've got no
[44:15] doctrine but christ no
[44:16] book but the bible no law but love
[44:20] amen that's how a christian should
[44:23] behave
[44:23] so that doesn't mean worry wherever he
[44:26] is
[44:27] it means he will be a christian going
[44:30] and he'll be a christian
[44:32] he's a christian on the front he's a
[44:34] christian on the back he's the christian
[44:36] at the bottom
[44:37] he's a christian on top he's uh
[44:40] saturated with the word of god
[44:43] because he's loved god is love
[44:47] be doers of the word amen
[44:50] for we find
[44:53] that if anyone thinks he is religious
[44:57] and does not bridle his tongue
[45:00] but he sees his heart this person
[45:04] religion is vain it's like you don't
[45:08] have to do it in any case
[45:10] because you can't bridle your tongue
[45:14] james says so he deceives his heart
[45:18] this person's religion is worthless
[45:22] it means nothing religion that is pure
[45:26] and undefiled in their affliction
[45:30] they mentor it before the father is this
[45:33] to filtered orphans and widows
[45:37] in the affliction and keep
[45:40] yourself unstained
[45:43] amen from the world oh my my
[45:47] that is
[45:51] religion that is pure
[45:54] and undefiled before god
[45:58] so where does it leave this message amen
[46:01] this message brings us to be pure and
[46:04] undefiled
[46:05] amen in god's eyes and in the
[46:08] eyes of the world you are pure and
[46:11] undefiled
[46:12] that's why the devil hates you that's
[46:15] why he wants to take you
[46:16] that's why he wants to ridicule you
[46:20] he speaks bad about you but because of
[46:23] the glory of god that's over you
[46:26] that's why the devil hates you because
[46:28] he sees god's glory
[46:30] and we are god's glory amen amen
[46:34] we are that part born again
[46:38] by the spirit placed into the body of
[46:41] christ
[46:43] and that's why jesus could say
[46:46] very very i say unto you
[46:49] i am the dog of the sheep hallelujah
[46:53] amen oh my now we would think about the
[46:57] door
[46:57] of our current day
[47:01] but when the door is spoken up as a
[47:05] shepherd
[47:06] he leaves the door physically
[47:09] literally sleeping in front of
[47:12] the entrance to the sheepfold hallelujah
[47:16] i am the door
[47:19] and he says he is the good shepherd
[47:26] oh my that's why
[47:30] angels have to come
[47:33] down to come and tell
[47:37] the shepherds there's a baby
[47:40] the messiah christmas hallelujah
[47:44] happened on that night when jesus was
[47:47] born
[47:48] crying in a manger wrapping swaddling
[47:51] clouds
[47:52] there he was on the breast of mary
[47:57] oh hallelujah just think of that
[48:00] and joseph being a son of david
[48:04] watching over david was a shepherd boy
[48:09] hallelujah and the lineage comes out
[48:13] as a lamb of god
[48:17] a lamb that john said that takes away
[48:20] the sin of the world amen i'm not worthy
[48:23] to unleash
[48:24] this the latter of his shoes but he's
[48:27] the one
[48:28] that's coming after me hallelujah
[48:32] he's the one that's going to take away
[48:34] the sin of the world
[48:35] he's the lamb of god but when everyone
[48:39] looked
[48:39] they saw this lion that was heating out
[48:43] at the pharisees
[48:45] when they looked they saw this carpenter
[48:48] coming out of joseph's shop and said
[48:51] your
[48:51] generation of vipers flee for the wrath
[48:54] to come
[48:57] so they said hey uh herod is after you
[49:02] and he said because he was the second
[49:04] adam
[49:05] amen he said go tell that fox that i'm
[49:09] going to do
[49:10] things today and tomorrow i'll be
[49:12] perfect amen
[49:15] being the second adam he could name the
[49:18] animals
[49:19] hallelujah he called them snakes and
[49:22] sappins
[49:23] and foxes
[49:26] because he was the second adam
[49:29] before the rib
[49:34] came out of his side on calvary he had
[49:37] to name the animals
[49:40] he named the pharisees who they were
[49:42] they could not
[49:43] hide from the lamb of god because he was
[49:46] on the line of the tribe of judah
[49:48] amen he was not in that lineage because
[49:52] the bible said so to speak
[49:54] he was the son of joseph but he was not
[49:57] the son of joseph he was not the son of
[50:00] mary
[50:01] he was the son of god
[50:04] and that made him the god
[50:07] the name of the father son and holy
[50:10] ghost
[50:11] and the name of the father son and holy
[50:13] ghost is the lord jesus christ
[50:16] the greatest revelation that struck the
[50:18] earth
[50:19] when jesus came as the messiah
[50:23] after the angel spoke his name
[50:26] hallelujah call him jesus but when you
[50:29] look
[50:30] back in the prophecies his name shall be
[50:33] called counselor
[50:34] wonderful the prince of peace the mighty
[50:37] god
[50:38] the everlasting father hallelujah
[50:41] amen they were giving his name there
[50:44] were so many titles to that name
[50:46] that could not fall the bible from
[50:49] genesis to revelation
[50:50] if you follow his titles it will surpass
[50:54] the very book of revelations from
[50:57] genesis because
[51:00] he was everything he was all in all
[51:05] he's god amen he created all things
[51:09] jesus did hallelujah when he placed his
[51:12] foot on
[51:13] eternity or on the room of time
[51:17] and he looked out into eternity he said
[51:19] let there be who was that that was the
[51:21] son of god
[51:22] amen hallelujah nothing else but jesus
[51:25] christ
[51:25] oh yes that made himself known as the
[51:28] logos
[51:29] so now you can see this light traveling
[51:31] you could see it made visible
[51:33] it was that light that said let there be
[51:36] let us make man
[51:37] let there be a fish left to be a whale
[51:40] look to be a tiger let there be a donkey
[51:43] hallelujah and then when the angels came
[51:46] down
[51:46] to say he yeah hallelujah the shepherd
[51:50] said what
[51:52] and they realized now there to go find
[51:55] out
[51:56] what was happening with the salutation
[52:00] christmas has landed
[52:03] or we call it the mass of chris christ
[52:06] the mass of christ that's what the
[52:07] catholic
[52:08] that's why it's name cursed mass christ
[52:11] mass amen but we know that it's not a
[52:14] mass of christ
[52:16] but it's christ in you the hope of glory
[52:19] amen
[52:20] that's him coming down he just didn't
[52:23] want to be in a manger
[52:24] he wanted to be in the heart of these
[52:27] subjects in the heart
[52:28] of each and individual bride member
[52:32] so we find ourselves now as we read
[52:36] hey man let's look at these shepherds
[52:39] after having heard
[52:42] that the sun is wrapped in sweat clothes
[52:45] and laid
[52:46] in a manger because there was no room
[52:50] for him
[52:51] oh you get angry when there's no room
[52:53] for you
[52:54] amen but there was no room for the
[52:57] master
[52:58] of the world the master of the universe
[53:01] the master of creation the master of
[53:04] nature
[53:06] he had no room hallelujah
[53:09] so take it from him when you are cast
[53:12] out
[53:13] when you are rejected that's when the
[53:15] glory of god rests upon amen hallelujah
[53:20] receive rejection like he did
[53:23] he was not welcome amen but
[53:27] when we receive him into our hearts when
[53:30] he knocks
[53:31] we welcome him in and when we welcome
[53:34] him
[53:34] in we are welcoming in the baptism of
[53:37] the holy ghost
[53:38] which is jesus christ amen hallelujah
[53:41] he's
[53:42] not a lesser god or a
[53:45] force that that he that he is
[53:48] he's he's not just the father or the son
[53:51] and the holy ghost he's the lord jesus
[53:53] christ
[53:53] amen nothing less than that and the lord
[53:56] jesus christ
[53:57] is the one god who it was said in the
[54:00] commandments by moses you shall have
[54:03] no other god before me nothing
[54:06] not a man not an angel not a prophet
[54:10] nothing before me no other god
[54:13] but that would be an idol
[54:16] and we thank the lord
[54:20] that when those shepherds reach
[54:23] looking now it's only a shepherd that
[54:26] looks for a lamb
[54:28] amen when when
[54:31] it would have been a pharisee that the
[54:33] angels would have
[54:35] made the salutation no the sanitation
[54:38] was made to
[54:39] shepherds angels to shepherds
[54:44] and we find them in the church ages
[54:48] where angels became shepherds
[54:51] amen so it was angels
[54:55] to shepherds and in the church ages that
[54:58] was a
[54:59] bride to be brought forth
[55:02] out of this world out of the ages
[55:08] we find that those seven angels
[55:11] became shepherds and what is a shepherd
[55:14] he's a feeder he's a gatherer he gathers
[55:18] his sheep amen he lets him loose to feed
[55:23] but when it's gathering time he brings
[55:25] them together
[55:27] hallelujah amen in a time of trial
[55:30] the shepherd might not be there and it's
[55:32] hot out in the field
[55:34] they are feeding and when the sun starts
[55:36] to bake upon them they
[55:38] find that those sheep will come from all
[55:41] corners and huddle together as their
[55:44] fellowship one with another amen and
[55:47] that
[55:48] fellowship hey man they will dig their
[55:50] head
[55:51] when the one is uh hot he will dig his
[55:54] head under the other
[55:56] and he will cool down and when he's
[55:58] cooled down
[55:59] the other one will dig themselves and
[56:01] they will exchange their heads
[56:03] hallelujah and the who is just keeping
[56:05] the sun at bay
[56:07] on the backsides hallelujah so we find
[56:11] those sheep gather together
[56:13] they are cheap that needs a shepherd
[56:16] in a time of trouble but when the
[56:18] shepherd is not closed
[56:19] and the elements the trials come your
[56:21] way
[56:23] gather together amen amen be
[56:26] in one accord don't break up
[56:29] because that's what the whole is waiting
[56:31] for on the outside
[56:32] he's waiting for the breakup but come
[56:35] together in fellowship
[56:37] under the word of god under the great
[56:39] champion the good shepherd
[56:40] the chief shepherd if not the pastor
[56:43] it's
[56:44] jesus amongst us amen
[56:47] oh i love that and that's why
[56:52] we don't have to depend on man we depend
[56:55] on him
[56:56] hallelujah and that's why we love to
[56:59] look at
[57:00] man but once the man doesn't show you
[57:03] christ
[57:04] then there's a problem with that man he
[57:06] becomes a hireling
[57:08] and not a shepherd hallelujah because
[57:11] the shepherd goes to the door
[57:14] there where the door is that's where the
[57:16] shepherd goes
[57:17] and he protects the sheep because he's
[57:20] the good shepherd
[57:21] and the only way you can be a good
[57:24] shepherd
[57:25] as a pastor you need the holy ghost
[57:28] without the holy ghost you've got no
[57:30] right behind this pulpit
[57:32] to feed the lambs of god to feed the
[57:35] sheep of god
[57:37] to feed the older sheep
[57:40] there's sheep and the sheep and there's
[57:43] lambs
[57:44] and that's why jesus asked peter do you
[57:46] love me peter
[57:47] and he said feed my sheep you love me
[57:50] peter
[57:51] he said feed my sheep do you love me
[57:53] peter
[57:54] feed my land hallelujah because the
[57:57] older sheep
[57:58] and the young sheep and the lambs
[58:01] they're all there to be fit and that is
[58:04] why
[58:05] having the holy ghost is utterly
[58:08] important amen because you are
[58:12] speaking and feeding those that's got
[58:15] the holy ghost
[58:16] because the holy ghost feeds on the word
[58:21] feed on sheep food nothing less
[58:24] they will go and only feed on that
[58:28] what sustains them nothing less
[58:31] nothing more a sheep doesn't go to
[58:35] mcdonald's
[58:36] but she doesn't go to kfc they just go
[58:39] into the field and eat cheap food amen
[58:43] hallelujah and that's why
[58:50] if all of god's little sheep would just
[58:53] stand together
[58:55] we have the coolness of the shade of
[58:57] each other
[58:58] the comfort to lean upon each other
[59:02] now we need that hallelujah we need to
[59:06] pray for one another
[59:07] we need to ask god's mercy upon those
[59:10] that are struggling to breathe
[59:12] oh but let the breath of god pass over
[59:15] us
[59:16] right now we speak the word right now
[59:20] let the breath of god come and let there
[59:22] be
[59:23] nothing that is hindering your love in
[59:26] jesus name i speak the word
[59:29] so shall it be because i believe
[59:32] it you believe it and that settles right
[59:34] there amen
[59:37] it certainly is necessary there's
[59:39] nothing like having a real good
[59:41] dependable friend that when the troubles
[59:44] are blazing the hearts
[59:46] on you can you can go to this friend
[59:50] sat down explain to them talk it over in
[59:53] personal confidence
[59:55] and then kneel down and pray together
[59:58] and know that this person is a good
[1:00:01] god-saved man or woman
[1:00:03] that you can put confidence in oh
[1:00:06] there's so little confidence that we can
[1:00:08] put in there today
[1:00:09] when you tell them something in
[1:00:11] confidence the whole world
[1:00:12] knows about it shame on us that god will
[1:00:16] bring us
[1:00:16] back to be being confidently man
[1:00:19] confident
[1:00:21] that in time when we hear something bad
[1:00:23] that happened to you in your life
[1:00:26] oh you made a mistake or something
[1:00:28] happened
[1:00:29] you done wrong you stumbled and fall
[1:00:32] fallen
[1:00:33] and you went to a confidant and the
[1:00:35] confidant
[1:00:36] tells the old church that's a cancer in
[1:00:39] the church
[1:00:39] that god will eradicate and if he can't
[1:00:43] get it
[1:00:43] out of you that man will get you out of
[1:00:46] the church
[1:00:49] can somebody say amen out there
[1:00:51] hallelujah
[1:00:53] if we can't get the devil out of you
[1:00:56] he will get the devil out of the church
[1:01:01] because when the man
[1:01:05] fell over the prophet's feet and he said
[1:01:08] you will follow
[1:01:09] my feet and they ask him is the devil
[1:01:13] gone
[1:01:14] the prophet says no the devil
[1:01:18] is only subject to me because of the
[1:01:21] word of god
[1:01:22] but he said he worships that spirit
[1:01:27] so when he gets off my feet he'll still
[1:01:30] have the same spirit
[1:01:32] but he cannot come against the spirit
[1:01:34] behind here
[1:01:35] because it's god jesus christ against
[1:01:39] the devil
[1:01:40] and the devil is a loser in the sight of
[1:01:42] god
[1:01:43] in the presence of god if you can hold
[1:01:45] your ground
[1:01:46] the devil is a loser amen he's lost the
[1:01:49] battle he's lost the fight
[1:01:51] he's lost the war he's lost to you
[1:01:55] because you are more than conquerors in
[1:01:57] christ amen
[1:01:59] let's take god at his word and see the
[1:02:01] power come back
[1:02:04] oh yes let's reason together
[1:02:07] say the scripture you see sheep in a
[1:02:11] cold country
[1:02:12] they just love to warm up to each other
[1:02:15] and
[1:02:16] there's been nothing as cold as this
[1:02:18] blizzard blowing through the world
[1:02:20] called covet amen and that is why we
[1:02:24] need to be closer together than
[1:02:26] more than ever before oh yes
[1:02:29] when the church gets cold and
[1:02:31] indifferent
[1:02:33] god's sheep ought to be huddled up
[1:02:35] together amen and pray for each other
[1:02:38] and the warmth of the real good
[1:02:40] christian fellowship
[1:02:41] david spoke of it in islam blessed is
[1:02:44] the man that sets not in the seat of the
[1:02:47] scornful
[1:02:48] standing in the way of sinners but his
[1:02:51] delight
[1:02:52] is in the law of the lord and in the law
[1:02:55] that he meditate thy day and night
[1:02:59] and he shall be like a tree that's
[1:03:01] planted by the river of water
[1:03:04] and his leaves shall never wither
[1:03:07] whatsoever he does shall prosper
[1:03:11] amen god said it
[1:03:14] god said headed by the mouth of a
[1:03:16] shepherd
[1:03:18] hallelujah a singing shepherd
[1:03:21] oh yes just imagine amen
[1:03:26] this was in the media
[1:03:31] where the shepherd was standing and he
[1:03:34] had a challenge
[1:03:36] made to every visiting tourist
[1:03:40] to call the sheep that was
[1:03:43] out in the field feeling
[1:03:47] and everyone would take up the challenge
[1:03:50] and he would give him the sound
[1:03:52] that they are normally attracted to and
[1:03:55] the sound
[1:03:56] is the voice of the shepherd
[1:04:00] hallelujah so we realize
[1:04:03] that the shepherd's voice is all we
[1:04:05] listen to
[1:04:06] and what is a voice it's a thunder what
[1:04:09] is a thunder
[1:04:10] it's a voice and there we realize
[1:04:15] that everyone went onto the platform put
[1:04:18] their feet against the rail
[1:04:20] and they did speaking tongues hallelujah
[1:04:24] went something you couldn't understand
[1:04:28] what they were saying what the shepherd
[1:04:29] was kind of
[1:04:31] making an example of how the sheep would
[1:04:33] come
[1:04:34] but everyone tried the women tried the
[1:04:37] men tried the children tried
[1:04:39] but to no avail it was like the sheep
[1:04:42] were
[1:04:42] deaf and that's how a christian should
[1:04:45] be
[1:04:45] he should be dead to other every voice
[1:04:48] but
[1:04:48] he should listen to the master's voice
[1:04:52] oh my and there comes the shepherd
[1:04:55] he puts his foot on that rail and
[1:04:58] hundreds of
[1:04:59] sheep just grazing all over the field
[1:05:02] scattered but when the shepherd made his
[1:05:06] tongues the interpretation went through
[1:05:09] to the sheep hallelujah the denomination
[1:05:13] doesn't understand this
[1:05:14] they don't know what's happening behind
[1:05:16] this pulpit right now
[1:05:18] they don't understand what's the
[1:05:20] revelation of the thunders
[1:05:21] they don't understand what's the
[1:05:23] revelation of
[1:05:25] adoption they don't understand what's
[1:05:27] the revelation of the rapture
[1:05:29] they don't know what's happening they
[1:05:31] don't understand
[1:05:33] what the prophet got to do with us in
[1:05:35] this day
[1:05:36] the prophets are there in the old
[1:05:37] testament what's he doing in this day
[1:05:40] they don't understand and as the
[1:05:43] shepherd
[1:05:44] started calling with his voice
[1:05:49] it seemed like nothing was happening
[1:05:52] the sheep just went on grazing but he
[1:05:54] didn't stop calling
[1:05:56] and that's what god is that's why the
[1:05:58] shepherd is he doesn't stop calling
[1:06:01] it doesn't seem like you are getting it
[1:06:03] but listen
[1:06:04] the more we preach the more you are
[1:06:06] ready to hear
[1:06:07] the voice of god the thunder that's
[1:06:10] coming from
[1:06:11] the eat the winds through the clouds of
[1:06:14] witness
[1:06:15] the thunder will strike it's the voice
[1:06:17] of god
[1:06:18] amen and as the voice struck every ear
[1:06:21] of those sheep amen
[1:06:25] and we find that there's lambs also
[1:06:29] but it doesn't mean that you need to
[1:06:31] preach to the lamb
[1:06:32] it means just get the sheep to come the
[1:06:35] lamb will follow
[1:06:37] hallelujah the lambs will follow
[1:06:40] just live the right kind of a life in
[1:06:42] your homes
[1:06:43] in church in your cars do the right
[1:06:47] thing
[1:06:47] the lands will follow and that's the
[1:06:50] shepherd called out
[1:06:52] friends there was a stir
[1:06:56] oh yes there was a turnaround
[1:06:59] a repentance upon the gain experience
[1:07:03] they had a look around they knew
[1:07:06] something
[1:07:07] stop what you're doing stop your eating
[1:07:10] stop your peanuts
[1:07:11] stop doing what you are doing the
[1:07:13] shepherd's voice
[1:07:15] has uttered it it's calling out
[1:07:20] and each of them they were facing that
[1:07:23] way
[1:07:25] but malachi chapter 4 says but in the
[1:07:27] days of the voice
[1:07:29] amen of that elijah he shall
[1:07:32] turn the hearts of the
[1:07:35] children that's in denomination
[1:07:39] the children of denomination we were
[1:07:41] there we were the that eagle
[1:07:44] that was waiting for the voice of mama
[1:07:46] eagle
[1:07:47] we were in that denominational as
[1:07:49] children
[1:07:50] we were methodists children we were
[1:07:54] baptist children
[1:07:55] but then they came advice of the
[1:07:58] shepherd
[1:07:59] a voice that said turn around
[1:08:02] back to the apostolic fathers not nice
[1:08:05] you're wrong
[1:08:06] not 83 25 when they said father son holy
[1:08:10] ghost no
[1:08:11] but before that when absolutely it was
[1:08:14] in action
[1:08:15] when acts 19 and verse 5 was in action
[1:08:21] and he received the holy ghost since you
[1:08:23] believed they said we don't believe that
[1:08:25] there's any holy ghost we don't know
[1:08:26] about the holy ghost but we are
[1:08:28] preaching christ
[1:08:29] he said if you haven't received the holy
[1:08:31] ghost how are you baptized
[1:08:33] he said well we are baptized unto john
[1:08:35] he said that was fine but it won't work
[1:08:37] now
[1:08:38] you have to be baptized over again in
[1:08:40] the name of the lord
[1:08:41] jesus christ for the remission of your
[1:08:43] sins for the holy ghost to come upon you
[1:08:46] amen and when they
[1:08:49] were baptized in the name of the lord
[1:08:51] jesus christ
[1:08:53] they received the holy ghost when paul
[1:08:55] laid his hands upon them
[1:08:57] and that is apostolic doctrine we still
[1:09:00] lay hands on those that need the holy
[1:09:01] ghost
[1:09:02] but we as gentiles we don't even need to
[1:09:04] be laid hands on
[1:09:06] because we believe it cornelius didn't
[1:09:08] have to have
[1:09:10] hands laid upon him oh my he had a
[1:09:13] vision
[1:09:13] if you have a vision call peter
[1:09:17] call the prophet call the message to
[1:09:19] attention
[1:09:20] and say i've heard the voice of god by a
[1:09:23] vision
[1:09:23] called peter and as speaker yet speak
[1:09:26] these words
[1:09:27] even lay hands upon him he was
[1:09:29] astonished when the holy ghost fell on
[1:09:31] those
[1:09:32] gentiles and he said what what's
[1:09:35] happening here
[1:09:36] they received the same holy ghost like
[1:09:38] we did being gentiles
[1:09:40] what's happening here but jesus gave
[1:09:43] peter a vision and said
[1:09:44] don't call that unclean what i've made
[1:09:47] clean
[1:09:48] what is cleaned by the blood is clean
[1:09:50] what is clean by the message of the
[1:09:52] hour you don't have to worry about
[1:09:54] doctrines and
[1:09:56] teachings and things all you have to do
[1:09:58] is listen to the voice of
[1:10:00] god and you know that you're coming
[1:10:02] through amen
[1:10:05] i'm so happy and i believe
[1:10:08] that it was angels that came
[1:10:12] to the shepherds it's written
[1:10:15] but what about our age from paul
[1:10:18] which is the bright age from paul to
[1:10:21] william branham
[1:10:23] and the prophet says that i came at the
[1:10:26] end
[1:10:27] this messenger comes at the end of the
[1:10:30] laodicean church age
[1:10:31] but now the question is has it ended the
[1:10:34] prophet says
[1:10:35] no while we are here that edge hasn't
[1:10:38] ended
[1:10:39] but there's a new age in this age which
[1:10:42] is the
[1:10:43] capstone age where every believer
[1:10:47] receives the capstone which is the holy
[1:10:50] ghost
[1:10:50] and when we receive the holy ghost in
[1:10:53] this age
[1:10:54] we call for the headstone
[1:10:58] and it's the headstone that takes up
[1:11:00] everything
[1:11:01] hallelujah it takes paul irenas
[1:11:05] martin combo all those shepherds
[1:11:08] who are angels are our corners
[1:11:12] are drawn up like a wee plant when the
[1:11:15] weed plant is sown
[1:11:17] the seed dies it rots and the life
[1:11:19] travels
[1:11:20] and as the life travels it dries in the
[1:11:24] first age
[1:11:25] it dries in the second age but the life
[1:11:27] has left it
[1:11:28] as the light bleeds it dries it dries
[1:11:32] and when it gets to the top it becomes
[1:11:35] seed again
[1:11:36] but in a multiple form it see the game
[1:11:40] the first seed that fell into the ground
[1:11:42] which was christ
[1:11:43] was what paul sowed back into the ground
[1:11:46] by a revelation of who this is
[1:11:48] who what our lord he said i am christ
[1:11:50] i'm jesus
[1:11:52] i'm jesus he said wow
[1:11:56] i thought you were elohim i called you
[1:11:59] lord
[1:11:59] but i recognize that now you're
[1:12:01] introducing yourself as
[1:12:03] jesus the everlasting father
[1:12:07] yes he's not the eternal son of god
[1:12:11] he is the son of god amen because the
[1:12:14] prophet says
[1:12:14] there's no such a thing as the eternal
[1:12:17] son of god that was made up
[1:12:19] amen it was made up in demon nationalism
[1:12:23] there's only one the son of god and
[1:12:25] that's jesus
[1:12:26] who is god and that's why you could say
[1:12:31] i am now paul i am now back as the
[1:12:34] everlasting son as isaiah said i will be
[1:12:38] the everlasting father amen
[1:12:41] the son that you hear me say why
[1:12:44] are you persecuting me saul
[1:12:48] said i am jesus who you are persecuting
[1:12:52] and saul being a pharisee being a binge
[1:12:55] of mine
[1:12:56] circumcised the eighth day went through
[1:12:58] the law know
[1:12:59] the law he said it's time for me
[1:13:04] like to sheep to stop grazing
[1:13:07] in a pharisee uh grazing ground
[1:13:11] but it's time for me to turn around and
[1:13:14] go towards the master's voice
[1:13:17] then that angel
[1:13:20] became a shepherd paul became a shepherd
[1:13:24] to the gentiles and then
[1:13:27] at the end we find another shepherd
[1:13:30] approaches amen because he had to come
[1:13:33] to the land that was opening the book
[1:13:36] the book was now being opened
[1:13:39] amen it was the son of man
[1:13:42] which was jesus revealing himself
[1:13:45] through
[1:13:46] a son of man hallelujah which was
[1:13:48] william branham
[1:13:50] and that prophet comes at the end of the
[1:13:53] laodicean church
[1:13:54] when everything has been broken down
[1:13:57] by the very people that acted like the
[1:14:01] pentecostals dead
[1:14:02] but did they have it no they did not
[1:14:06] amen but there was individuals that had
[1:14:08] it in the days of paul
[1:14:10] we are trying to say paul only had faith
[1:14:13] but if paul didn't have the holy ghost
[1:14:16] he's not in the bride
[1:14:18] so if paul had the holy ghost he had to
[1:14:20] have second peter
[1:14:22] one without these things you are blind
[1:14:26] and you can't see a far off but paul saw
[1:14:29] right into laodicea hallelujah
[1:14:32] and there we find ourselves that
[1:14:35] angels on our shepherds
[1:14:39] angels to shepherds to show a land to go
[1:14:42] look for a lamb
[1:14:43] to worship the land now
[1:14:46] its angels becoming shepherds
[1:14:50] to bring forth a bride
[1:14:53] to jesus christ we are not just a bride
[1:14:56] but without
[1:14:57] us they cannot be made further they
[1:14:59] cannot be complete without us
[1:15:01] amen because remember perfection comes
[1:15:05] by the blood
[1:15:06] sunlit perfection comes by the blood
[1:15:09] but it takes a get together
[1:15:12] according together seven thunders
[1:15:15] gathers the bride who's that it's the
[1:15:17] voice of god what is the voice of god
[1:15:22] so when the thunder strikes obviously
[1:15:26] the father of lights made
[1:15:29] a strike that took it from
[1:15:32] paul right up to william branham
[1:15:35] and william brown says you know there
[1:15:38] must be one prophet
[1:15:39] in the beginning and there's a prophet
[1:15:41] at the end
[1:15:42] he's alpha and his omega the carriers
[1:15:46] are in between
[1:15:47] so when the omega comes
[1:15:50] he says i say what paul said
[1:15:54] hallelujah so we can't go back to any
[1:15:58] other voice
[1:15:59] but the voice of the good shepherd amen
[1:16:02] the wise of the great shepherd the
[1:16:05] wife hallelujah of the chief shepherd
[1:16:10] so now we realize that another age is
[1:16:13] really coming and that's where these
[1:16:15] brothers are picking on
[1:16:17] they are trying to make another angel
[1:16:20] in the eighth hallelujah but it's christ
[1:16:25] back again to the beginning back to what
[1:16:28] he was
[1:16:29] back to capping believers
[1:16:33] believers by the holy ghost because
[1:16:36] remember
[1:16:37] once you start mixing up the church ages
[1:16:41] with the individual you'll be lost in
[1:16:43] the pyramid
[1:16:45] you'll be a you'll be a mummy in the
[1:16:48] pyramid
[1:16:50] you die or you are dead going in the
[1:16:54] permanent
[1:16:54] there's a lot of traps in the program
[1:16:57] hey man
[1:16:57] there's a lot of booby traps in the
[1:16:59] permit so when you're going there you
[1:17:02] must know
[1:17:03] who you are from faith
[1:17:06] to the holy ghost amen
[1:17:10] now my time is running out
[1:17:13] and i'm going to just try to go another
[1:17:15] five minutes
[1:17:18] and then trust that the lord will bless
[1:17:20] us
[1:17:21] and they're not closed so there we
[1:17:24] realize that
[1:17:26] when we look at in the orient
[1:17:30] how they take care of the sheep the
[1:17:32] shepherd brings them
[1:17:33] in at night and he counts them everyone
[1:17:36] to see
[1:17:37] if everyone is in
[1:17:40] is it nighttime yes is everyone in
[1:17:45] i want to say lord i'm in so
[1:17:49] if they are still coming
[1:17:52] may god have mercy on them remember
[1:17:56] the last one is not the one that's
[1:17:58] baptizing water
[1:18:00] the last one is the one baptized by the
[1:18:03] holy ghost
[1:18:05] amen so the one can still be sitting
[1:18:07] around
[1:18:08] baptizing water but never went on to
[1:18:11] receive the holy
[1:18:12] spirit we are waiting for you and you
[1:18:15] and you may god have mercy on us that we
[1:18:18] hear the voice of the shepherd
[1:18:21] and then we become that ship we become
[1:18:24] the chief
[1:18:24] we become that shepherd after we become
[1:18:27] that sheep
[1:18:28] amen we can go out like the shepherd and
[1:18:31] tell
[1:18:31] everybody that the messiah
[1:18:35] is born the lamb of god is born
[1:18:38] come see hallelujah shepherds became
[1:18:42] messengers they were angels
[1:18:45] angels spoke to shepherds
[1:18:49] shepherds became angels and right
[1:18:51] through the church ages
[1:18:53] from paul angels that was in the right
[1:18:56] hand of jesus became
[1:18:57] shepherds and they and no wonder
[1:19:01] seven voices seven
[1:19:04] thunders gathers the bride amen
[1:19:08] paul gathered his group arenas gathered
[1:19:11] his group
[1:19:12] and everyone after him martin colombo
[1:19:15] gathered this group
[1:19:16] william branham is gathering his group
[1:19:20] and i believe that we are right there
[1:19:24] at the end to wait
[1:19:28] for the coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:19:31] so the dead in christ will rise first
[1:19:33] and we which are alive shall be changed
[1:19:35] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:19:38] amen and we when we see that
[1:19:42] uh that went on when we see them
[1:19:45] it will send such a shaking in our
[1:19:49] bodies that it will
[1:19:50] be changed in an instant and we
[1:19:53] will meet him together in the air i
[1:19:56] trust that you are happy
[1:19:58] and i believe that as
[1:20:01] those sheep finds
[1:20:04] if there's one missing he will not lay
[1:20:07] down until he goes out into the deserts
[1:20:10] that's where the church is right now we
[1:20:12] have to go out into the deserts
[1:20:14] or wherever he is heard it all day long
[1:20:16] and he will find that sheep
[1:20:18] lay it over his shoulder bring it in
[1:20:20] then when all is in the fold
[1:20:22] then the shepherd lays himself down at
[1:20:25] the gap
[1:20:26] he's the door to the sheepfold there's
[1:20:28] no other way
[1:20:29] it's a coral you've got over the top
[1:20:32] over it
[1:20:32] and nothing can come into those sheep
[1:20:34] until he crosses the shepherd
[1:20:37] so he as the prophet says
[1:20:41] it's a dog it's a coral so as he goes
[1:20:44] over this coral he has to climb
[1:20:46] over jump down and get and get to the
[1:20:49] ship
[1:20:50] and anything that comes has to come from
[1:20:52] the top
[1:20:53] but he's laying there waiting for
[1:20:55] everything to come through that gap
[1:20:57] because he becomes the door amen there
[1:21:00] we find
[1:21:02] no matter what it is it will have to
[1:21:04] come by the shepherd
[1:21:07] matter is not what it is it will have to
[1:21:09] come via the word
[1:21:10] if you say you have the thunders it must
[1:21:13] come via the word
[1:21:14] and the only way that you can have what
[1:21:17] the sun
[1:21:17] is uttered is when you consult the
[1:21:20] prophet
[1:21:21] because there's no other way of getting
[1:21:23] around the word that's not written
[1:21:26] but via a prophet so when it's not
[1:21:29] written
[1:21:29] consult a prophet when it's written
[1:21:31] consult the word
[1:21:34] hallelujah consult the word when
[1:21:38] it's not uh when it's a when it's
[1:21:41] written but when it's
[1:21:42] not written you have to consult the
[1:21:45] prophet
[1:21:46] because he reads between the lines and
[1:21:48] he said it must be
[1:21:50] it must be measured
[1:21:53] with the word to say if you have the
[1:21:56] thunder it must be measured in the word
[1:21:58] because it's not written
[1:21:59] amen and then he said
[1:22:03] he's going to do two things he's going
[1:22:04] to
[1:22:06] reveal the thunders and he's going to
[1:22:09] turn the hearts of the children back
[1:22:11] to the apostolic fathers so may god
[1:22:14] bless you
[1:22:15] and may the good shepherd shepherd you
[1:22:18] may gather you so that we can be in one
[1:22:22] accord
[1:22:22] may gather you so that you can be healed
[1:22:26] may we pray for one another that covert
[1:22:29] will be defeated
[1:22:30] in the name of jesus christ stay safe
[1:22:34] and believe all you need to do is have
[1:22:37] faith in god
[1:22:39] and the rest is settled god bless you
[1:22:42] let's pray heavenly father
[1:22:44] we come before you in the name of jesus
[1:22:46] christ we commit
[1:22:47] every soul into your hands we pray now
[1:22:50] oh father
[1:22:51] that you will come as the good shepherd
[1:22:54] and take
[1:22:55] the sheep and gather them together by
[1:22:58] your voice
[1:22:59] we don't hear no other voice we don't
[1:23:01] hear another voice but the word of god
[1:23:04] every prophet has to come by the word
[1:23:07] for us to
[1:23:08] listen to his voice because then he will
[1:23:10] be speaking the oracles of the living
[1:23:13] god straight out of the written word
[1:23:15] lord we know there's nothing more
[1:23:17] powerful than the written word
[1:23:19] and that is why we come anointed by the
[1:23:22] written word
[1:23:23] and we take god right at his word
[1:23:26] take it like an ease and that settles it
[1:23:30] we also thank you for a prophet that you
[1:23:32] send our way
[1:23:33] we thank you for william branham that
[1:23:36] came lord that you sent and revealed the

[1:23:43] in the seals
[1:23:44] and even not even written in the word of
[1:23:47] god
[1:23:48] but it had to come by a prophet the
[1:23:51] omega prophet
[1:23:52] that said what paul said the alpha
[1:23:55] prophet
[1:23:56] and we thank you today father may you
