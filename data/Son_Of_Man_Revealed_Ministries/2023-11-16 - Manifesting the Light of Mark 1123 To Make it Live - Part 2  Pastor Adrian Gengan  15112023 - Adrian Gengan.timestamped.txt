[0:27] Through The Eyes of Faith oh God we

[0:46] tonight won't you meet them at the point
[0:48] of need oh God and father I pray Lord
[0:51] you'll speak a word oh God that can
[0:52] edify us encourage us Lord strengthen us
[0:55] Lord and father even as we see the day
[0:57] fast approaching Lord we realize there's
[0:59] not much time left oh god father help us
[1:01] to keep our lamb trimed and burning Lord
[1:04] and run with everything that's within us
[1:06] oh God lord we come now father
[1:08] subjecting ourselves under the
[1:09] leadership of the Holy Spirit and we ask
[1:12] you to have your Divine will and purpose
[1:13] this evening we commit ourselves into
[1:15] your precious and mighty hand in the
[1:17] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:20] much Thanksgiving amen amen I greet you
[1:22] all in the precious name of Jesus Amen
[1:25] the name that is above every other name
[1:28] amen amen let's turn to Zechariah
[1:30] Chapter
[1:32] 14 Amen on Sunday we were speaking about
[1:36] the manifested light in Mark
[1:39] 11:23 amen and we found that there's
[1:42] only a certain class of people that can
[1:45] light up that scripture amen so I
[1:47] couldn't preach everything on
[1:49] Sunday and the spirit had it work that
[1:52] way for a reason I couldn't get to the
[1:54] depth of the message because we had amen
[1:58] some visitors here and I didn't want
[1:59] want to go too deep into the message and
[2:02] lose them
[2:05] amen so we'll progress amen this
[2:08] evening can we close the door amen it
[2:11] could be
[2:13] uh can get the petrol smell amen praise
[2:16] the Lord
[2:18] hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so
[2:21] let's turn to Zechariah Chapter
[2:23] 14 amen we were speaking on manifesting
[2:26] the light of Mark 11:23 to make it live
[2:30] amen so remember there can be Darkness
[2:33] upon scriptures like Darkness upon
[2:36] Malachi 4: 5 and6 Darkness on Revelation
[2:39] 10:7 Darkness on Luke
[2:42] 17:30 but then somebody had to Shine the
[2:45] Light amen so we are saying brother
[2:48] brandham opened up scripture of Mark
[2:50] 11:23 but it's not a oneman
[2:53] scripture because the scripture says
[2:55] whosoever amen amen hallelujah I was
[2:59] telling you a few weeks ago I was
[3:00] talking to a pastor and he was telling
[3:01] me there's not a local Pastor now he's
[3:04] from Johannesburg and he was telling me
[3:06] that only brother brandham could speak
[3:08] amen so you see how people can still
[3:10] shut down scriptural prophecies by
[3:13] allotting it to one man amen so let's
[3:16] read from verse 6 chapter 14: 6
[3:18] Zechariah and it shall come to pass in
[3:20] that day that the light shall not be
[3:22] clear nor
[3:24] dark amen so this is a different kind of
[3:27] day but it shall be one day which shall
[3:31] be known to the Lord not day nor night
[3:34] but it shall come to pass that at
[3:36] evening time it shall be light amen yes
[3:40] amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[3:43] Lord thank Lord and we know the prophet
[3:44] came at evening time yes amen amen
[3:47] hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord you
[3:49] may be
[3:52] seated amen amen
[3:56] so we learned here that
[4:01] to the prophet's message it tells you
[4:02] the messenger always came at the End of
[4:04] the Age amen when the church had gone
[4:08] into apostasy there comes the messenger
[4:10] at the end of the age to bring light to
[4:13] that age am amen so if we can I'm just
[4:16] going to lay a few scriptures here just
[4:18] to show you amen that it's in the a
[4:20] pattern in the Bible in Genesis chapter
[4:22] 1 and verse amen three and God said let
[4:25] there be light and there was light amen
[4:29] and God saw the light that it was good
[4:33] and God divided the light from the
[4:36] darkness amen so we know that light and
[4:39] darkness cannot mix yes amen that's why
[4:42] the Bible also the Apostle Paul is
[4:44] admonishing us be not unequally yolked
[4:46] with
[4:47] unbelievers amen hallelujah there's got
[4:50] to be a separation and the word brings a
[4:53] separation amen amen if we do not
[4:55] compromise with the word the unbelief
[4:57] will separate because we are the light
[4:59] and darkness must separate amen amen
[5:02] that's according to scripture now if we
[5:04] go to
[5:05] John before we get to John let's turn to
[5:08] Isaiah 60 amen praise the
[5:13] Lord
[5:15] amen Brothers I'm going to fall down
[5:18] here with a petrol
[5:22] smell amen Isaiah chapter
[5:26] 60 now we know that this scripture as
[5:29] well
[5:30] I tell you this message of the hour is
[5:31] so packed am because in Shalom you'll
[5:34] take this scripture now and what is
[5:36] Shalom it is the rising of the sun
[5:39] Shalom amen because shalom means good
[5:42] morning amen amen so it's a dawning of a
[5:44] new day darkness to the lateran church
[5:48] age but light to the believer amen arise
[5:52] Shine for thy light is come amen notice
[5:57] there present tense and the glory of the
[5:59] Lord is risen upon thee amen hallelujah
[6:03] when we look at the Bride of the Lord
[6:05] Jesus Christ we are seeing the glory of
[6:07] the Lord amen amen because the faith
[6:09] that we have is not our own faith but
[6:11] the faith of the Son of God it's no
[6:14] longer I that liveth but it's Christ
[6:16] that liveth in me amen for Behold The
[6:19] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[6:22] Darkness to people but the Lord shall
[6:24] arise upon thee and His glory shall be
[6:27] seen upon thee amen amen
[6:30] hallelujah and the Gentiles shall come
[6:33] to thy light have we come to the light
[6:36] amen and the Kings to the brightness of
[6:38] thy Rising amen hallelujah amen let's
[6:41] turn to John amen The Book of
[6:44] John praise the Lord John chapter
[6:47] 1 now there's no two Beginnings right so
[6:50] John starts out here in the beginning
[6:53] the same in the beginning as Genesis 1
[6:55] so it's the same
[6:57] beginning amen amen hallelujah
[7:00] so in the beginning was the word and the
[7:02] Word was with God and the Word was God
[7:05] amen amen so when we look at the literal
[7:08] Sun what is that it's the word of God
[7:10] made
[7:11] manifest right the same was in the
[7:13] beginning with God all things were made
[7:16] by him and without him was not
[7:19] anything made that was made and here's
[7:22] where we're going to get to in him was
[7:24] life amen amen and the life was the
[7:27] light of men you see light coming out of
[7:30] him again amen
[7:33] hallelujah and the light shineth in
[7:36] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[7:39] it
[7:40] not now this is a different kind of
[7:45] Darkness every time the light shined the
[7:48] light was the darkness was aware of it
[7:50] and it had to flee amen amen but look at
[7:53] the age we are living
[7:55] in light has been manifested but the
[7:58] darkness can't
[8:00] comprehended why demon
[8:03] possessed amen possession all hell has
[8:06] been Unleashed upon the
[8:08] Earth you you would know that brother
[8:10] Brandon prophesies and he says I I
[8:12] predict a time where the entire age will
[8:14] be in Insanity we are living in it amen
[8:18] you step out your house you can see
[8:20] people are in Insanity amen hallelujah
[8:23] now there was a man s from God whose
[8:25] name was John we know we have had a
[8:27] second flrunner now we know his name the
[8:29] same came for a witness to Bear witness
[8:31] of the light that all men through him
[8:33] might believe he was not that light but
[8:36] was sent to Bear witness of that light
[8:39] that was the True Light which lighted
[8:41] every man that cometh to the
[8:44] world Hallelujah so everyone in this age
[8:47] who is going to experience light is
[8:49] going to experience it through the
[8:51] second Forerunner yes amen amen yes now
[8:55] God has a provided way and he won't
[8:57] change his plan or his program for
[8:58] anybody else amen nobody can come to the
[9:01] light of these scriptures by bypassing
[9:04] the Forerunner of the age because he
[9:06] alone was sent to reveal the mysteries
[9:08] of God he alone was sent to turn our
[9:11] heart back to the faith of the fathers
[9:13] amen and we stand here today and we
[9:16] present the truth that that scripture
[9:18] has already happened that our hearts
[9:20] have already been turned back to the
[9:21] faith of the fathers amen that the
[9:23] mystery of God is already revealed amen
[9:26] and we are a part of the mystery of God
[9:28] yes amen
[9:30] hallelujah we are right here at the time
[9:33] where Jesus amen is coming back to take
[9:36] his people to the next Dimension amen so
[9:40] we are in the process of the Rapture
[9:42] that started with a shout and God is now
[9:44] revealing himself through a many
[9:46] membered body amen
[9:49] hallelujah in the first coming we had
[9:51] the groom coming it was Jesus Christ
[9:54] coming it was Adam restored back in his
[9:56] fullness amen so at the second coming he
[9:59] must restore Eve to her fullness so
[10:02] you're going to see this time period
[10:03] from now until we get translated where
[10:06] Eve is coming to a full Glory she's
[10:08] coming back to a hieden beauty amen can
[10:11] somebody identify with that God is
[10:13] taking away all unbelief from our hearts
[10:15] amen the unbelief amen that surrounded
[10:18] the church age has been taken
[10:20] away amen because God has taken away all
[10:24] fear amen and the only thing that's
[10:26] being established now in the heart of
[10:28] the believer is fa
[10:29] we coming back to a faith civilization
[10:31] amen where we speak amen and then the
[10:34] word creates
[10:36] itself Hallelujah now you know that
[10:41] Faith work at patience amen you learn
[10:45] that in the life of Abraham amen you
[10:48] don't get Faith by
[10:51] patience yes yes but Faith work patience
[10:55] so if today you pray for something and
[10:57] it doesn't happen are you going to let
[10:59] go of the promise of God or are you
[11:01] going to hold true to the word that came
[11:02] out of your
[11:03] [Music]
[11:05] mouth because the prophet says that God
[11:08] when God said let there be light he says
[11:10] we don't know how long it took but that
[11:12] word had to come to pass because God
[11:14] believed his own word so it depends
[11:17] whether we're looking to the eyes of of
[11:19] the flesh or we're looking to the Unseen
[11:21] eye amen amen because the Unseen eye
[11:24] says that it's already done it's already
[11:27] finished I'm just waiting for that word
[11:29] to come into manifestation and that's
[11:31] what patience is all about amen Faith
[11:33] work at patience so we can't grow weary
[11:37] in our faith amen sometimes we go on
[11:40] believing a week two weeks 3 weeks four
[11:42] weeks and we're looking at the symptom
[11:45] we're looking at all of these symptoms
[11:47] maybe it's sickness financial difficulty
[11:49] whatever it is your problem it is you're
[11:51] looking at the symptom and if you're not
[11:53] in
[11:54] patience thank you waiting for the
[11:57] promise Lord you are going to lose out
[12:01] amen because impatience brings fear fear
[12:04] that it won't work fear that my word is
[12:07] not powerful enough fear amen that this
[12:10] thing won't come to pass amen and that's
[12:12] how people get defeated but we've got to
[12:15] hold true to our confession amen there's
[12:17] only one law on the earth for the
[12:20] believer and that law was taken away
[12:22] from man if you confess with your mouth
[12:24] and believe in your heart and Jesus is
[12:27] coming back to establish that law in the
[12:29] hearts of men but it seems it it we got
[12:32] to keep teaching it week after week
[12:34] because man can't believe his own word
[12:36] man can't believe that he is so powerful
[12:38] that even the angel of the Lord came
[12:40] down to amen forget Gideon and he told
[12:43] him thou Mighty Man of Valor he looks
[12:47] around you talking to
[12:50] me because prior to that gon is not
[12:52] known as a mighty man of
[12:54] Val amen but it had to come time and
[12:58] season am amen it's all about time and
[13:01] season and I ask you when it comes about
[13:03] your time and season not to miss it amen
[13:07] you got to step into that season amen
[13:10] time and season came for that man who
[13:12] was at the pool but he missed his time
[13:14] and
[13:14] season amen so he didn't get his
[13:17] healing amen time and season came for
[13:21] Moses but then he slew the Egyptian out
[13:24] of time and season yet he was the
[13:27] deliverer he had to wait 40 years
[13:31] waiting in patience am but then
[13:33] something happened he met the
[13:35] supernatural but we've seen the
[13:38] supernatural in this year yes Lord God
[13:42] himself has come our way amen can we
[13:46] testify is there any doubt amen
[13:50] hallelujah when we met the pill of fire
[13:52] when we see the supernatural we realize
[13:55] there's an unseen Force an unseen Army
[13:57] that accompanies the children of God
[14:00] amen hallelujah thank thank we really
[14:05] need to study Hebrews go read Hebrews
[14:08] how the angels are ministers to the HS
[14:11] of
[14:12] Salvation the angels are waiting at
[14:16] command but people go unawares amen
[14:19] because they can't see we are so taught
[14:22] to un accustomed to what we see amen
[14:25] hallelujah but the eyes of faith will
[14:28] say let the angel of God go forth oh
[14:31] yes I can't make it in time amen your
[14:34] prayer can go to somebody that's in USA
[14:37] that may be in need dying amen but you
[14:40] can commission amen hallelujah and pray
[14:42] that the angel of God go and meet them
[14:44] there and touch them and deliver them
[14:47] amen but you even that scripture you've
[14:48] got to believe that you possess the
[14:51] power if you read the book of Hebrews
[14:53] he's showing you that man was not amen
[14:56] that this Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[14:59] hallelujah he was made higher than the
[15:02] angels that every Angel is is at his
[15:06] command and I the reason I'm telling you
[15:08] that is because God has taken you and he
[15:11] said come and be seated with me in
[15:12] Heavenly places amen hallelujah you
[15:15] can't be seated with Christ in Heavenly
[15:17] places you can't be joints with
[15:21] him and not be able to control
[15:23] principalities and
[15:27] Powers amen yes L amen praise the Lord
[15:32] amen oh isn't he good
[15:37] amen so we need a man who can turn on
[15:41] the light in any situation amen
[15:44] hallelujah and we know that man amen
[15:47] we're coming to close if there's anybody
[15:49] who knows the man who can turn on the
[15:51] light it's the wife of the Lord Jesus
[15:53] Christ because there's nobody knows the
[15:55] husband better than the wife yes amen
[15:58] amen hallelujah
[16:01] amen praise the Lord
[16:06] amen we're coming to our scriptures here
[16:08] and we were reading amen
[16:12] hallelujah in St John chapter 6:
[16:16] 68 now we know the word is
[16:19] light the word is light that brings
[16:22] light to any situation amen I want to
[16:25] encourage you to always use the word of
[16:27] God in any
[16:29] situation because the word is light
[16:33] am if somebody you're speaking to God is
[16:36] presenting opportunities to us every day
[16:39] people are telling us stuff every
[16:41] day and we can't be silent with the
[16:44] truth because the word is light the word
[16:47] can deliver people from their situations
[16:50] we've got to stand up sit on a hill
[16:53] we've got to stand up salt of the earth
[16:57] and we've got to speak the word of God
[16:58] God amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord
[17:03] amen John 668 says then Simon Peter
[17:07] answered him and said Lord to whom shall
[17:09] we go thou as the words of eternal life
[17:13] amen
[17:16] amen listen to what he's saying you have
[17:19] the words of eternal life you mean words
[17:24] give us eternal life amen so the because
[17:27] why the SP spoken word is the Original
[17:30] Seed so the way back the prophet is
[17:32] saying the way back to eternal life is
[17:35] going to come back by the spoken word am
[17:38] and Jesus was here on Earth speaking the
[17:41] word and he had the words to lead us to
[17:43] eternal
[17:45] life amen everything we know about
[17:47] eternal life and everything we know
[17:49] that's leading us back to our true
[17:51] inheritance is coming by the word of God
[17:54] Amen here in John 14:6 our lordes Jesus
[17:58] is telling us I am the way amen
[18:02] amen
[18:06] hallelujah I am the truth
[18:09] amen and I am the
[18:12] life no man come unto the father but by
[18:16] me amen amen amen so Jesus is saying I
[18:20] am the way and if you this is what
[18:22] brother Bram is saying now and if you're
[18:24] in Christ you become a new creation when
[18:27] you're born into the kingdom of God you
[18:29] become a part of Christ and the way you
[18:31] get in the way by a new birth we know
[18:35] the other scripture by one Spirit we are
[18:37] all baptized into the body of Jesus
[18:39] Christ amen hallelujah right now you'll
[18:42] see around the world the lord is
[18:45] Shifting The People's focus and and
[18:47] really bringing out the revelation of
[18:49] the Holy Ghost to them amen because
[18:51] that's one of the Mysteries that has to
[18:52] be revealed in the last
[18:55] days amen people are confused about the
[18:58] Holy Ghost is he a third person in the
[19:00] Trinity what is his really function what
[19:03] is his job what is he supposed to do
[19:06] amen hallelujah he's the truth nobody
[19:09] else has the truth so in him you cannot
[19:11] have truth till you have Jesus then
[19:13] you're in the truth amen we read there
[19:16] in John 1:4 where it says in him was
[19:18] life and the life was the light of
[19:21] men amen so Jesus is saying I am the way
[19:25] what is the way seven steps amen amen
[19:30] seven steps is the way isn't that what
[19:34] he's done since he left taking us to
[19:37] seven steps seven Church ages amen
[19:41] hallelujah
[19:43] amen praise the Lord amen now gram says
[19:48] the third thing Jesus we have to come in
[19:51] to him and he he alone is the life that
[19:56] light gives us light that that life
[19:58] gives us light Jesus is the only light
[20:01] there is he says you could be russalite
[20:03] camlite whatever you might be it's a
[20:06] false light until you get in Jesus
[20:08] you're not in the
[20:10] light the only way to God no man cometh
[20:13] to the father except by me so you cannot
[20:15] go to God you can't go to heaven you got
[20:17] to get in the way and Jesus is the way
[20:20] he is the only truth there is and he is
[20:22] the only light the only true light the
[20:25] only true manifested light is Jesus
[20:27] Christ we have woman light Methodist
[20:29] light we have Baptist light we have
[20:31] Pentecostal light we have all kinds of
[20:33] light but Jesus is the True Light amen
[20:37] amen
[20:39] amen amen thank you you know our lord
[20:42] Jesus goes on to tell us that we are the
[20:44] children of the day and the children of
[20:46] the world walk in darkness they walk in
[20:49] night time they love Darkness
[20:52] amen amen and here in John 3: 19 this is
[20:56] the condemnation that light is come into
[20:58] the world and Men love Darkness rather
[21:01] than light because their deeds were
[21:04] evil amen what a what a condition that
[21:07] is amen so can you see the value that
[21:11] God had in you that he he chose you
[21:14] because look at the ladies in church AG
[21:16] wretched miserable naked blind and they
[21:20] don't know it amen now we would be none
[21:24] the better right but God elected us he
[21:27] chose us from before the foundation of
[21:29] the world Amen and he predestinated us
[21:31] unto adoption of sons yes unto adoption
[21:34] of children amen
[21:37] hallelujah thank you if we walking the
[21:40] prophet says if you're walking in the
[21:42] light at night time you're walking under
[21:44] your artificial light there's only one
[21:46] true daylight that's sunlight and
[21:48] there's only one true Christian Light
[21:50] and that is the light of the sun of God
[21:52] is the only true
[21:57] light
[22:00] he says sometimes you know you get
[22:02] insane people he says you tell them they
[22:05] refuse to walk in sunlight and they say
[22:07] oh the sun is not shining and run into
[22:09] his basement he refuses the help of the
[22:11] sun he says that's just his own
[22:13] stupidity the sun is shining somebody
[22:16] come to the window and all come out John
[22:18] the sun is shining he says I refuse to
[22:20] believe such nonsense now he misses the
[22:23] warmth of the sun he misses the
[22:25] lifegiving Rays that it gives he miss
[22:28] this is the beauty that it shows and the
[22:29] life that it brings forth am amen why am
[22:33] I telling you that look at our people
[22:35] have missed the revelation of the word
[22:38] amen the opening of The Seven Seals the
[22:41] Revelation that came with the opening of
[22:43] The Seven Seals All The Mysteries of God
[22:45] were revealed what is that light coming
[22:48] to the believer amen why why are we so
[22:51] fasc why are we so impressed with the
[22:53] word that was open you say impressed yes
[22:55] brother Bram says I wonder why we are
[22:57] not sufficiently impressed with the word
[22:59] that is in our
[23:01] midst he says we are not sufficiently
[23:04] impressed
[23:06] yes why am I telling you
[23:09] that he says before Seven Seals were
[23:12] revealed before the great mysterious
[23:14] light show showed for showed forth in
[23:16] the heavens up there in tuon he sent me
[23:20] back and at the same time was at hand
[23:23] for the Seven Seals which held the seven
[23:25] Mysteries of the entire Bible was sealed
[23:28] with these Seven Seals so what is the
[23:30] seals coming to do give us a
[23:34] word faith come by the hearing of the
[23:36] word but this word didn't come from the
[23:39] earth this came by a mighty Angel amen
[23:42] so it's a word from Heaven to equip a
[23:45] people from the earth for rapturing
[23:47] Faith amen
[23:49] amen that's right amen you see if we
[23:53] lose the value of the opening of the
[23:55] word we are not going to get the faith
[23:58] for a Rapture for a body change amen we
[24:02] can't go into a and take a body change
[24:04] with a denominational message right amen

[24:13] denominational message and a
[24:15] denominational approach yes amen amen
[24:19] amen praise the
[24:22] Lord he says how those angels down along
[24:25] the road messengers of the church ages
[24:27] opened a certain part of that but in the
[24:30] seventh hour the seventh messenger that
[24:33] all these Mysteries should be finished
[24:35] the seventh Earthly messenger see this
[24:38] angel that he speaks of then was on
[24:41] earth right and he saw another angel
[24:43] coming down not the Earthly angel that
[24:46] had been given the message here but a
[24:49] mighty angel came from heaven with a
[24:50] rainbow over him and set his foot on
[24:53] land and sea and swore by him that lives
[24:55] forever and ever time shall be no more
[24:57] more but before he broke forth those
[25:00] Seven Seals to reveal them he showed the
[25:02] miraculous he showed it first in the
[25:04] heavens amen amen amen he says they took
[25:07] pictures all across Southern United
[25:09] States Mexico it hangs now in life
[25:11] magazines still a mystery to them you
[25:14] see how it's still Darkness to
[25:18] them but he declares it in the heavens
[25:21] before he does it on the earth he always
[25:23] does that he shows his eyes his signs in
[25:25] the heavens first amen
[25:28] so here the prophet is telling us now
[25:30] that when he was preaching the seven
[25:31] Church ages and he was draw amen he says
[25:35] I finished drawing on the Blackboard the
[25:37] seven Church ages and how the light

[25:42] Pillar of
[25:45] Fire how the light came in and how the
[25:47] light went out it says it's Among Us
[25:50] anyhow we know and the strange thing the
[25:53] last day when the last Church age was
[25:55] draw out this great Pillar of Fire came
[25:58] down among hundreds of people and took
[26:00] itself back to the back wall of the
[26:02] Tabernacle and there before hundreds

[34:50] with
[34:51] Jesus amen the Bible tells
[34:55] you that he Lov them he loved his
[34:59] family we find here that in verse four
[35:02] when Jesus
[35:03] heard that Lazarus was sick he said the
[35:06] sickness is not unto death but for the
[35:08] glory of God that the Son of God might
[35:10] be glorified thereby now Jesus loved
[35:13] Martha and her sister and
[35:16] Lazarus so when he had heard that they
[35:18] were sick he aboe two days in the same
[35:20] place where he
[35:22] was okay then after that he said unto
[35:26] his disciples
[35:27] let us go into Judea
[35:30] again and his disciples said unto him
[35:33] Master the Jews of late sought to Stone
[35:35] thee and thou goest thou th again and
[35:38] Jesus said are there not 12 hours in the
[35:41] day if any man walk in the day he
[35:43] stumbleth not because he seeth the light
[35:46] of this
[35:47] world but if a man walk in the night he
[35:50] stumbleth because there's no light in
[35:55] him these things said he and after that
[35:57] he said unto them our friend Lazarus
[36:00] sleepeth but I go that I may awake him
[36:03] out of
[36:07] sleep then said the disciples Lord if he
[36:09] be asleep he do well Al be Jesus spoke
[36:11] of his death but they thought that he
[36:13] spoke of taking of rest in sleep then
[36:17] Jesus said unto them plainly Lazarus is
[36:20] dead and I am glad for your sakes that I
[36:22] was not there to the intent you may
[36:24] believe nevertheless let us go unto
[36:28] him so we know
[36:31] amen death struck Lazarus death is dark
[36:35] and it's
[36:36] gloomy Martha and Mary are Weeping
[36:39] mourning because of their brother they
[36:42] seem to be no hope amen other than to
[36:45] wait for the resurrection of the Dead
[36:47] you find there in the conversation they
[36:49] believe in the resurrection of the Dead
[36:52] amen they didn't realize that Jesus was
[36:54] carrying Light Within him amen that he
[36:56] is the light of the world Amen that the
[36:59] same God who spoke in the beginning let
[37:01] there be light the same God who said let
[37:04] us make man in our own image the same
[37:07] God Amen that was there in the Shak
[37:09] Glory of that uh Ark of the Covenant
[37:12] where they put Moses Rod amen and that
[37:14] Rod birthed into life the same God was
[37:17] standing in their
[37:19] midst you see they had partial
[37:22] Revelation but God was going to give
[37:23] them a complete revelation of who he was
[37:27] amen and God would take the situation to
[37:30] unlock that he is the way the truth and
[37:33] the life amen so if we are buried in
[37:36] Jesus there's no way we're going to die
[37:38] there's no way that we are going to be
[37:39] amen forgotten but we are going to come
[37:41] into eternal life amen amen hallelujah
[37:45] what was Jesus coming I'm showing you
[37:47] the approach of Jesus coming to a dark
[37:49] dismal situation because there's nothing
[37:51] as dark as
[37:53] death amen but here's the Manifest light
[37:57] coming
[37:58] forth
[38:00] amen 3 days passed and the fourth day is
[38:03] the dawning of a new day amen

[38:31] had been here my brother had not died
[38:34] but I know that even now whatsoever thou
[38:37] will ask of God God will give it
[38:40] thee Jesus said unto her thy brother

[38:50] Lord thy brother shall rise
[38:53] again the the sleeping Saints must rise
[38:57] yes amen amen amen whose Ministry is

[39:33] him praise the
[39:36] Lord Mara said unto him I know that he
[39:39] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[39:41] the last day you see still eyes are
[39:44] closed yes Jesus said unto her I am the
[39:48] resurrection amen and the life he that
[39:51] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[39:54] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[39:57] believeth in me shall never die
[39:59] believest thou this they didn't realize
[40:02] that here was tabernacling a God in a
[40:04] body of time but the God himself did
[40:07] wasn't contained to
[40:11] time they were talking about a future
[40:13] tense but he's saying I don't exist I
[40:15] may be here in this body of Flesh that's
[40:18] governed by time but I am not control by
[40:21] time amen yes amen amen oh yes
[40:24] Hallelujah if I want to ra him up now I
[40:27] will raise him
[40:29] up see she said unto him yeah Lord I
[40:33] believe that thou art the Christ the son
[40:34] of God who should come into the world
[40:37] and when she so said she went away and
[40:39] called Mary a sister secretly saying the
[40:42] master is come and call it for thee now
[40:44] notice that is a hidden Mystery because
[40:46] it's not documented that Jesus told her
[40:49] go call
[40:52] Mary th must prophesy
[40:55] again
[41:01] amen as soon as she heard she Rose
[41:04] quickly and came unto him now Jesus was
[41:06] not yet come into the town but was in
[41:09] the place where Martha met him the Jews
[41:11] that were with her in the house and
[41:13] comforted her when they saw Mary that
[41:16] she rose up hly and went out followed
[41:18] her saying she goeth unto the grave to
[41:20] weep there then when Mary was come to
[41:22] where Jesus was she saw him and fell
[41:24] down at his feet saying unto him Lord if
[41:26] thou has been here my brother had not
[41:28] died when Jesus therefore saw her
[41:30] weeping and the Jews also weeping which
[41:33] came with her he graned in his spirit
[41:35] and was
[41:37] troubled amen
[41:41] hallelujah and said where have you laid
[41:44] him and they said unto him Lord come and
[41:48] see Jesus wept then said the Jews behold
[41:51] how he loved him and some of them said
[41:54] could not this man which opened the eyes
[41:55] of the blind
[41:56] have caused that even this man should
[42:00] not have
[42:03] died Jesus therefore again groaning in
[42:05] himself come to the Grave it was a cave
[42:09] and a stone lay upon it and Jesus said
[42:12] take he away the
[42:15] stone
[42:17] amen Mara the sister of him that was
[42:21] dead say unto him Lord by this time he
[42:23] stink it for he had been dead 4
[42:28] days so I was trying to tell you that
[42:30] Jesus didn't come in the first
[42:33] restoration second restoration third
[42:36] restoration but he came at the fourth
[42:38] stage of the restoration amen
[42:43] amen if you don't know what that is the
[42:45] first stage was
[42:47] justification the second stage was
[42:49] sanctification the third stage was
[42:51] baptism of the Holy
[42:54] Ghost what is the fourth stage
[42:57] coming back into the formed word image
[42:59] coming back amen those three stages are
[43:02] changing you into the formed word
[43:05] image putting you back in your sunship
[43:09] Authority that is why Jesus is showing
[43:11] you he comes on the fourth day oh thank
[43:14] you Jesus amen he's coming on the fourth
[43:16] day which is a type of the fourth stage
[43:18] of the restoration when Adam is restored
[43:21] amen but now he's coming back in this
[43:23] time at this fourth stage of the
[43:25] restoration to to show you that Eve is
[43:27] fully restored to a position
[43:31] amen whether you like it or not the
[43:33] bride will be put on display amen
[43:36] yes yes amen if the bride was put on
[43:40] display in Genesis she must be put in
[43:42] display
[43:43] now you say what book are we in now
[43:46] we're in the Book of Revelation amen the
[43:49] Eve in re in Genesis was put on
[43:52] display and the Eve in Revelation must
[43:56] must be put on display
[43:58] amen we are the final voice to the final
[44:02] age
[44:05] Amen in that Alpha
[44:08] Age The Glorious age of

[44:16] voice now we come to the Omega age we in
[44:21] Revelation 10 Mighty
[44:24] Angel seventh angel
[44:26] after seventh angel is John now I many
[44:30] if you believe that this is John in the
[44:33] Bible or is he typing a
[44:36] bride
[44:38] amen is John typing a bride John take
[44:42] the book eat the book th must prophesy
[44:44] again amen so we you can see in the
[44:47] progression of that scripture even we
[44:49] are the final voice amen because after
[44:53] that comes Revelation 11 which is two
[44:55] prophets Amen to
[44:57] Israel so we are the final voice before
[45:00] this thing goes
[45:02] off amen
