your feet yes Father we come in full submission yes and completely surrender ourselves and yield ourselves to you tonight we know Lord that each one of us Lord had not gathered here just by coincidence for God but he's been pre-planned before the foundations of the earth yes and Lord we're not just gathered into any Gathering part but in a place where you will place your name yes in your provided place yes worship of God and we know that we are gathered here and you are monsters Lord then father we know that nothing oh no circumstance yes no wild of the enemy yes you can stand in your way tonight or God every demon would have to flee father every anxiety every fear will have to flee in your presence or gods but we are so glad tonight that we could be found in your presence which seems of like Precious faith and father we know that the time is fast spent it's a late hour and Lord we are mindful that we are in need of you all the time yes we're not relying upon ourselves we're not relying Upon Our Own intellect because that will fail us but we are lying upon you o God we are relying upon your leadership upon us oh God your guidance Upon Us father you know the thing that we need to hear you know the food that we need to eat in this hour Lord Jesus come and speak to us with God yes yes and speak to your children tonight I know that you you know the needs father and you know in whatever area that we need to be fed tonight come and Feed Us Lord be with us now and may you have the preeminence of the meeting in Jesus name we pray amen Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I know that you all come from how tiring days at work and whatever things we're busy with but we all know that we are needful of him amen and we all are facing a time where you go into your work environment to school wherever you may be whatever environment you may face the situation is tense yes in the natural the situation is tense to the next to the normal man amen because everything he's looking at around the world is failing he's looking at a failed political system yes he's looking at a failed economical system he's looking at a fair religious system so men don't know where to turn to yeah yeah and they don't know where to seek the answers from because if you have missed the key to the age if you have missed the prophet of the age email me then no religion no denomination no Organization no politician no world leader is going to have the answer for the current situation the world is facing amen but we thank God that the people upon the Earth a people that was chosen to be born in a certain season amen amen the people that had to be reproduced upon the Earth in this age amen and they are to have the gene of God in them and they have to have a certain makeup for this age amen and yet to be anointed for this Aid amen yes because they are going to carry a special word so it's not to any type of people it's for a special class of people amen amen we used to go around in the early time when you first received this word thinking that we could save everybody with this message but it was for a special class of people amen amen even before the foundation of the world before they were formed in a mother's womb they had to be called that special class of yes amen amen and this word come to show us in the back part of God's mind that we were already there amen and therefore when you see that Revelation thank you Lord nothing can stand in your way yes thank you Lord in respect of making you doubt this message yes nothing can make you reason with this word no no scientific theory or no no intelligence of man can make you now take this word and not understand it you understand what I'm talking about because we're living in an age where people are so engrossed with intelligence yes with intelligence of mankind because as Daniel said knowledge shall increase in the library amen a man has become so intellectual they'll be able to twist the Bible to you and they will show you the Bible and they will take you to the history of the Bible they'll take you to their call archeology of the Bible and they will show you and they will misinterpret things or to make you understand things from the intellectual point of view and make you misbelieve misbelieve God's word but if you have receive this by faith then you will see how inferior mankind is when you receive the wisdom of God is superior to the wisdom of man you'll see how inferior the intellectual man is because you are seeing things yeah amen yes yes that he'll never be able to see it amen you've got your Bibles returned to the Book of Luke chapter 1 verse 26. amen let's see where it all starts the story of Jesus and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David so ready message Believers you're reading this you already can see genology you know where David's coming from you know all the types right and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said ill Thou Art Ali favored amen amen so she wasn't just any ordinary person amen highly favored she was already predestinated for that position the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women amen and the people here that are blessed amongst women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in a mind what manner of salutation this should be because he thought it'd be taking it to that you are selected you are a special class you're not just any unordinary person yes this is not a normal salutation this is taking a basically take you to predestination that he was predestinated for this purpose yes you must cut out for this purpose and you are stepping now out of the scriptures amen amen because everything must go back to the word amen and the angels said unto her fear not fear not Mary for thou as found favor with God and behold thou shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this thing this be seeing I know not a man he has the supernatural love and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God so here she is firstly she is walking out of the scriptures now so there was a promise in the scripture back in Isaiah yes yes then there's a word to her amen amen so so here's the word given to her now she received this word and behold thy cousin Elizabeth would shall also conceive a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her so she she's a person that's coming out of the scripture because the scripture spoke about her the angel comes to her amen she receives a promise she receives the word the angel gives a tells her what's happening and she receives this word amen amen and the Bible says the angel departed from a right let's turn to Luke 18 1. and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men always that men ought always to pray and not to things so in this hour when the sphere and anxiety upon the Earth may not always pray and not to things saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God near regard neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying event me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God no regard man yet because this Widow trouble at me I will Avenger lest by a continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge said and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he be along with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen amen you may be seated he's not talking about the time when he's gonna send to heaven and when the Holy Ghost comes down on the day of Pentecost no no because you know what's going to happen at that time but he's talking about before he comes again shall he find favor upon the Earth amen amen we're going to speak tonight a time to receive and a time to produce amen there was a time when Mary had to received the promise amen and she said be unto me according to that word in the Holy Ghost overshadowed but there was a time when the promise was manifested amen there was a time where Mary received that word but she's walking around and nine months later there had to be a manifestation of what she receives amen just like the disciples in the upper room Jesus said to them Terry yeah until the Holy Ghost comes upon you so they were tearing there in the upper room they were preaching to his words they had to obey his word amen and they at the Cherry day in the upper room and what happened on the day of Pentecost the promise came amen and the Holy Ghost came and busted the church amen what a great inauguration that must have been amen amen and we know what happened after that when they received the promise then they became that manifested word in that hour amen what it was showing that Jesus Christ is the resurrected savior what was the manifestation at the time that Jesus Christ is not dead he is risen he's still alive amen amen and now he is working amongst his people he's working amongst the apostles he's working amongst the Believers that the Believers that came on this is the start of his church and this is where he's working amongst his church amen and just like if you turn your Bible to Genesis 18 10 and you say it in Genesis 18 10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah the wife shall have a son amen right so here he goes to tell Abraham I'm gonna Return To Thee but in Genesis 17 5 15 the scripture proceeding Genesis 18 he says and God said unto Abraham as foreign but Sarah shall be your name amen and I will bless her Sarah means princess right and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kingdom people shall be of her so we see that there was a promise to given to Abraham and then before the manifestation of the promise he comes down amen amen before the manifestation he comes down yes and then when he comes down he said I will return to thee according to the time of life and Sarah their wife shall have a son what happens when he comes down there's a body change takes place amen amen when he comes down in the time when he's coming down there's a body chain so there's a promise amen there's a time to receive and there's also a time to produce amen we can just you just can't receive amen you can't just receive the word word yeah yeah but there is a time when you have to become the manifestation of the word amen amen yes amen because those messages come to produce perfect faith amen and perfect faith is recognizing your position in the words amen and how do you recognize your position in the word when you see yourself in the word oh you see and you see the word being interpreted daily in your own life he's not taking a god of History you're not taking another character yes but when you sing that now manifested in your personal life amen amen hallelujah amen so there was a time for us to receive and we said be it unto me according to Thy word amen just like Mary amen yes yes amen he says yeah in this quote he said the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God Amen here he was given a bride yes to reproduce himself yes that is why the bride was given to him yes amen so you see the the end result of why the bride or the main reason the bride was given to him so Adam could reproduce himself yes amen not to produce a hybrid but to produce himself yes amen and the only way he could reproduce himself if he stayed obedient to what was told to him that he had to speak the word amen amen amen that's right now if Adam spoke the word the bride it was given to him a makeup was in such a way amen that a body was made in such a way when Adam spoke the word a body would conceive yes and reproduce Adam and that when but when she fell she felt by advertisation and she called him to die Amen in other words now he could introduce himself yes the real Adam now he's producing a fallen race because he came by the spoken word yes he would so he couldn't produce what he came under amen amen now he's producing something by hybridization in a way that gordoned ah and just for him to do yes because if he had to produce himself as a spoken word Son of God he had to speak amen amen amen and therefore now God is proving it by his word that there will be amen amen because when Mary comes on the scene in the natural love Mary's day she's a virgin a spouse to Joseph but Joseph didn't touch her she's a virgin amen and the angel comes to her and gives her the word the word is spoken to her but and she receives that spoken word and what happened she conceals of the Holy One amen the body is already there to make it make that up amen to produce of the Holy One and it just like that with the church amen this bride would be a virgin bride amen she will not be touched by any other man but when she receives that word amen when she receives that word she's already got the makeup amen amen she's already got the gene of God in it to reproduce him amen amen she receives the spoken word about her amen I want you to receive it to make up God already created her in such a way God have made a special class of people yes amen that when she receives this word she will reproduce Jesus Christ again but there was a time to receive yes amen there was a season of receiving the spoken word amen there was a receipt there was a season when the word when the mechanics was here amen and the word had to come first but now is a season to produce and the only way you can produce is if you have come into a union with him if there's been no Union amen you cannot produce nothing amen so don't let all these fall churches come and lie to you that Jesus is amongst them the only parasites because the rain is falling for the Justice he's enjoying the rain yeah the rain is falling for you amen you are the ones in Union with him and you are the ones to produce Jesus Christ on the Earth again because you are the one to produce a Christ that is resurrected again amen you are the type you are the people upon the Earth to say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen how do you make him the same today he's showing that he's not a dead God that is risen from the dead that is resurrected Jesus that is yet amongst the people and the same only ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is fell upon his people again amen amen in the works that he did then he must do it again today amen that's right show me what place when the Bible stopped it show me one place when the prophet said it stops yes amen that's right amen amen thank you so there was a bride because this is an obedient bride she loves his word she'll become so much like him she'll be in his very image amen amen and she left thus said the amen Lord amen amen denominations can't produce that because they are more peace for himself yes but this bride would be his mouthpiece amen when she speaks he's gonna speak through her whatever God is whenever people want to say I want to hear the voice of God in this hour he is speaking to the bride amen through a many-membered body amen yes amen thank you Isaiah chapter 35 amen the wilderness and the solitary Place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and Blossom as Rose he shall Blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it the Excellency of Kamal and Sharon they shall see the glory of the Lord and the Excellency of our God Amen the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees say to them that our fearful Hearts A fearful art this be strong fear notes behold your God will come with vengeance amen even God would have recompense he will come and save you amen then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the years of the death shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as an arch and a son of the dumb sin for in the wilderness shall Waters break out and streams in the desert and the part ground shall become a pool yes and the Thirsty land Springs of water now when you're reading the scripture you're looking at natural Israel looking at Jesus ministry on the earth yes but what you're forgetting if Jesus Christ did the same yesterday today and forever every except yes amen there must have been a time a season of dryness amen but this is not that season amen this is the season when we are in the homelands of the Holy Ghost this is the season where the people have come to their position this is a season where they become prosperous in the land this is a season where they cultivated the land and they became prosperous because they realized their position in Christ they realize their position in the body they realize what they're calling an election is because the maid they're calling an election show and this is a season where the land is in abundance amen I'm talking about this land of the Holy Ghost yes this land that you're residing in right now this land that you're enjoying week after week week after week drinking from the inexhaustible Fountain of Life I'm talking about this land where everything is flourishing this land with the fruits upon the tree amen we're not talking we must have been a time where you must have been tired you must have been wary going year after year in a message and saying where are these things that were spoken of but there's like an eagle that renews the strength oh you're not looking at later Sia you are looking at all the situations around you you are looking at all the anxiety that's going around you are not looking around the fear that people mankind is seeing you are not looking at that no you are looking above you are strong into the Heavenly oh yeah amen because why you are receiving from above amen amen you are receiving because why who is here amongst you amen it's the Holy Ghost that's come down it's the Holy Ghost that's moving amongst you amen feeding you From Another Dimension amen thank you Lord but what you have to do there was a cleaning up time amen because why a holy God cannot dwell among filthy people amen there's no holy people the scripture says only God is Holy yes amen but if you want to have the holy God if you want to be a holy person if the holy God living in you amen but if you are the holy God living in you understand the nature of your God yes you've got to understand the nature and the way it dwells you've got to understand the nature of the Holy Spirit yes true the holy spirit is not like the devil his nature is different the makeup is different amen amen there to be a cleaning up the vessel's got to be cleaned amen you've got a letter of yourself yes if you want to be full with more and more of him let up of yourself amen yes let off yes amen amen he said then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the Earth of the death shall be unstopped amen then shall the lame man leap as a heart and the son of the dumb Singh now these are all talking about Supernatural things happening yes amen where where else is the world going to see this amen the church world is not going to produce this you know what happened to Saul when he got in a vaccine condition he tried to there was no prophet Samuel was of the scene he went to the urum tamim he wouldn't there was no answer from the eurom time he wouldn't light up for him there was no word for him there was nothing that he could do from God because God departed from him because he was in a back certain condition God wouldn't speak to him amen God used wouldn't use any method that he used to speak to him but he was he knew that he had to hear from God but he was in a vaccine condition just like this world the church was it wouldn't listen they wouldn't come and accept the true word of God what God Said through His prophets yes because Samuel gave the word to Saul and Samuel Saul wouldn't listen yeah if you only obeyed every word that was spoken through Samuel you wouldn't have been in the condition yes but they wouldn't accept His prophets they rejected God's prophets and now God is not going to speak to them so what did Saul do because Saul know he must hear from God oh you must and the only way you can hear from God was through his Prophet mm-hmm so what he did he went to a familiar Spirit yes yes to try and contact Sam here Samuel the prophet so what do you think these people are doing what what Spirits upon them he looks real you said you might say God is amongst them but they are familiar spirits just like this like how you get a prophet and they call it what they was calling it mental telepathy the reason why they call it that because they got all his familiar spirits they got this fortune tellers and all that but this was the real thing how do you check the real thing take it back together yes take it back to the world so if God is working amongst you and the Supernatural is amongst you take it back to the West yes take it back and see which scripture amen but if I come and tell you oh did the blood come here from my hand there's oil come here from my hand that's not scripture take it back to the Europe yes yeah you know as they do away with the gifts amen you know with it be afraid of the gifts but he said take it back to the word but if it's from the words if you're walking out of the scriptures and say this is my scripture amen this is what the scripture speaks about me amen amen there's supposed to be a super Church upon the Earth amen they're supposed to be a super race upon the Earth amen they're supposed to be an invincible Army Amen in year 2015 in year 2016 no in year 2023 amen hallelujah amen amen amen this is a present God we're not talking about a Jesus in the tomorrow we're talking about Jesus in the now amen and the Podge ground shall become a pool and the Thirsty land Springs of water how many can testify to that inexhaustible Fountain of Life Springs of water amen in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grasped with wreath and rushes and then I we shall be there amen anyway she's putting in Highway shall be the comma and their way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over yes yes over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men the fool shall not earth therein no lion shall be there no any ravenous Beast shall go up there on it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walked amen but he will not walk under the third pool amen he will not be there under the third pool amen he come to impersonate the first two pulls but not under the third pool amen amen this is the hidden secret this is for a special class of people amen you have to have the makeup you have to have the whom for it amen yes that's why he's going to say to them oh but many came to me in that day shall come to me Lord I wanna prophesied in Your Name Lord ever not cast out demons in your name amen he said depart from me yes workers of inequity I know you not no Union they never come by Union amen [Music] parasites he said no lion shall be there no revenants be shall go up there on it shall not be found there but they're redeemed shall walk thee and The Ransom of the Lord shall return and come to Zion whoever you're coming this hour amen what songs and everlasting Joy upon the air they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sign shall flee their way now he says in this code he says in the message Hebrews chapter 1. 69 and he says now and he's a conjunction a highway it wasn't a Highway of Holiness it shall be a highway anyway and it shall be called the way of Holiness not the Highway of Holiness yes the way of holiness it comes back to Holiness what the Holy Ghost brought us to the way of holiness if you want to see God working it's the way of holiness holy living consecrated lives amen amen the earlier scripture I read constantly praying always in prayer amen and the way of the road is the middle of the road he's built like this so that the waters will wash off the trash to both sides keeping the road clean amen amen amen you don't you have puddles standing in the road all the time if it isn't built rights yes the way is the middle of the road amen now on this side when people get converted their mind is set right on Christ and it is just a little scholarly and don't keep under prayer they'll get real cold stiff starchy and indifferent bring the Baptist Doctrine in the message yeah opthyology in the message scholarly try to bring everything in a scholarly in a theological manner yeah try to denominate around an idea a teaching and what happened to become stiff and starchy can't see the move of God amongst them amen amen because why they gone to one side yeah and if they just a little bit nervous if you don't watch they'll get radical and Wild on this side see they go into Sensations and everything now but the real church is a real same gospel right in the middle of the road amen it's not cold and starchy see he's not saying you was you must go and decide oh that's it yes this church is not cold and starchy but neither is it fanaticism because it's got the word amen he's got the word he's just not not any word it's a fresh word amen it's a fresh word all the time by divine revelation amen amen it's a real good old warm gospel heartfelt love of God Amen bring them back old-fashioned altar bring them back old-fashioned consecrated live bring them back old-fashioned fasting in prayer because it never wears out amen hallelujah because it will still bring down the Holy Ghost amen it will still produce the results yeah yes amen amen heartfelt love of God going right down the middle of the road calling from both side that's right now and are you going to get the church right out of the word the urum tamam amen yes amen she's going to be produced out of the word because she sees herself in the word amen she sees herself as a people that's carrying out the Mandate in this hour Revelation 10 8 to 11 yes she recognized I have a responsibility man as his responsibility is upon me amen amen so you find that there was a time yes there was a time to receive but now is a time to produce amen by the time he said God sent out the prophets God came down and we saw this beautiful things happening God revealed him Vindicated himself with a pillow of Fire Vindicated himself in a supernatural cloud but now you need to be their testimony that God is vindicating himself amongst you and I amen amen they ought to be a people on the Earth who recognize the call for the hour amen amen and recognize that there's been a slackness yes yes in the message world men have been so happy and fascinated with the way God has shown him the word and they went into theology and there's been somewhere into radicals as well yes but there's got to be a group of people that will be in the middle of the road amen will have the revelation of the word we'll have fresh Revelation as a day is getting closer the world is becoming more clearer because that's part of the third pool yes the third pool is the word the opening of the word amen the power of the spoken word the temple must have all the manifestations yes because the temple is that's right amen absolutely amen as the need arises under inspiration there'll be different needs in every home you go to a house you got you might have a baby you might have different children different size uh different age group in amongst your children then you got the mother you got the father not everyone is the same and everyone would eat a different according to their needs a baby will be different from the from the Teenage children the teenage children might eat different the appetite is different from the parents yes it's just like that in the church that's why you're going to have the German in the church amen amen when the world is coming out the different levels of people in the church so sometimes there might be a need for an article there might be a need for going to the person's house using the scripture call the others yeah he's using the scripture then there will be a need under the anointing which you are not controlling now this is when the anointing drops down and you'll be able to speak that word amen amen when that need arises amen amen but those are not needs you want to go those are happening now behind closed doors those are situations going to be happening when the Lord sees foot for you to happen but there's also a time where now your faith if you believe if you ask anything and you believe it you shall receive what you are amen amen so you've got to have this hour and you need to know how to operate and use the word of God but you cannot do that with intellectual thinking right amen then you're not gonna understand the Supernatural and you're going to throw away the supernatural you're going to take the supernatural put it under the carpet because you're happy with your theology but if you've got the Holy Ghost and you are working with the Holy Ghost man I tell you it becomes a nature it becomes normal to you yes to operate in the spirit amen amen amen because when you're walking in the with the spirit of God Amen moving in you then it becomes second nature to you amen and then you're operating in the spirits yes yes amen I'm not talking about history I'll be talking about reality yeah we're talking about things that we are seeing we talk about testimonies that come amen we're talking about a church that is walking in a position amen we're talking about a church that's rejoicing in the land amen we're talking about a church that's growing and being prosperous in that land amen yes the world is jealous about the Jewish people amen they can't understand how the Jew can come from the Holocaust and come to a land that is Desert yeah desolated and now the land is so successful the land has produced so much yes naturalism how much more for the spirit yeah amen you come out from all parts of the world it wasn't an organization God has called us as individuals amen amen not all I mean we we come from different Works some some from from denomination some from Hinduism some never knew God but God has brought us here now the people are astonished at the things that you are saying that's right because the people who are even theologians can't understand the things you're talking about yes amen but you can see it people in the jungles of Africa can see yes people in South America and the generals they can see it in Amazon people in the mountainous areas can see it people in the most remote Villages unlearned people vacancies amen this is not the work of a man that's right amen amen this is a supernatural work because the same people bless your name like how the angel came to Mary they received this word amen I said to me according to Thy word amen and now there's a bride being produced around the world hey man a bride walking in full maturity now because this is the hour where they must come of people who've come to full maturity amen at the end of the hours you take out the first fruits and there must be a people that is waved amen amen amen the prophet has produced his part in the hour yes amen that was one man Ministry messenger of the age amen prophet of the age but now there must be a bride yes also waved amen amen because why there's nothing left for us but the next thing to happen now is the voice of the Resurrection yes amen yes the time if I spent yes thank you Lord speaking about the Feast of Pentecost yeah but it's also now the Jews might have their time to call come to the Feast of atonement yes amen they can't have their time without us leaving the Earth that's right Moses and Elijah can't come to them yes till we leave the Earth yeah and Satan have to come in for ease fulfillment he has to also come down incarnate himself into the pope when we leave the Earth yes they on the other side are waiting for us amen time to produce amen a season of receiving is over you've already received [Music] and now you if you don't see any anyone producing it means you haven't come in your union with him amen you have to come into Union to produce the resurrected Jesus Christ amen the world needs to see the same Jesus Christ amen not not a polished of Jesus Christ not the theological Jesus Christ another one with flowery words the one that walked upon the Earth two thousand years ago amen The Works that he did Hallelujah Greater Works that is they shall do amen who are those people a Greater Works initiation yes who are the people yeah who are the people that's supposed to be the Super race who's those people that's supposed to be the Invincible Army amen yes Lord if not for now amen that will not be saved for such a time as this yes amen but people like Abraham when before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah he would intercede for his loved ones yes a people like Esther before the destruction of the Jews she will intercede for for the people have you not been preserved for such an hour like this amen couldn't do it man couldn't call you then why God has created us for his specific work amen he's not a big it's not a long work take notice of this it's a work that already started if you haven't connected with it connected it tonight amen amen if you haven't collected it

go back on your knees yes go and pray Lord say Lord I want to let off of myself amen because every day we backslide yeah you're in this world every day you are flourished with all the circumstances of life amen but if you are walking in the knowledge of who you are yes you know when your face a situation you gotta you're living you're walking with the spirit and you have your closet time when you're coming in a situation you're not going to be screaming and praying you're not going to be shouting yes and praying in a situation yes no did you see the prophet doing that did you see Jesus doing that the Bible say Jesus shouted or he spoke Jesus Took the word he spoke the word amen the prophet did the same and his prayer life then you compare the prophet meeting to other people that came up after the prophet meeting the healing revivals look at their prayer and look at the prophet's prayer line if you know who you are yes and if you know you got the backing you know you've got the authority The Authority is given to you yes and you know what you're speaking amen amen then when you're praying you're not shouting you're not screaming yes you don't say I keep the yeah so you speak with authority amen and the devil recognizes Authority amen you speak with an authoritative voice amen you don't speak as if you have no confidence in what you're speaking right but if you're walking with the spirits then you will speak with confidence and the devil will those demons will obey that those demons will acknowledge that then don't demons say that Paul and Silas I know yes all the disciples I know Jesus I know but who are you yeah got to walk you've got to know what you're working with amen because if you receive this word and he said be it unto me according to that word there must be you must produce now produce Jesus Christ again upon the Earth amen you must produce again it must come from you amen amen when Jesus walked into a situation read the gospels when you walked into a situation he just spoke when when Peter and John when they went up to the gate beautiful and the man that was there begging there at the gate they knew the authority they had the experience they knew it was whatever they were walking in the spirit amen when they were walking they wasn't walking when you're walking you see do you see your circumstances they wasn't looking at the circumstances they wasn't looking at the man the the the symptoms of what's what they saw there but they already knew the authority and the backing that they had and they fixed the eyes on the man and they started the man to look on them amen and they spoke with authority because they knew when they speak with authority they knew they had the backing amen when Elijah went in the Mount Carmel Showdown amen he knew he's walking with the Lord yes he knew what the Lord had already shown him amen so he could speak with authority amen amen when the prophet was there in India and then he challenged all those religious leaders yes from in the Hinduism and so forth when a blind man that were worshiping one of the muhammadin Gods looking at the sun yes and then he got blind because he's worshiping the sun god when he challenged them right there in a public show he knew he had the backing yes amen he knew that he had Authority and he told them if one of your Gods can heal his men about unto your God because he knew that never happened yes yeah but he said if my god do it you worship my God Amen he said you couldn't hear a pin drop yeah so you see a man that walked a man a son and daughter of God that walking this hour in the spirit recognizing that he's not a normal race but they are super racist yes yes recognizing that they are invincible Army amen recognizing that they are the super Church amen recognizing that they are that body of Christ on Earth yes they are Jesus Christ reproduced in his hour they come into the image of Christ they are not there to scream and scream at a demon case whatever amen they will speak with authority amen and they will speak with authority but saying that you can't just go there and speak that's why the demon said to to the sons of seven sons of skiba the Seven Sons given he said Peter and John we know Jesus we don't but we don't know you yeah you have to have a walk with him amen you've got to walk with the spirit yes amen you're going to have a prayer life yes you've got to have a consecrated life or the demon will come out Hallelujah that same demon will call you out you know I think I've said this some time back we was we went to a case one night at work it was a demon case it was at the Durban boys college and this person escaped from the from the world where they keep mental patients at the independent Hospital and you and he claimed he took a letter and he clamped up a ledge balcony and he was standing on the ledge of the balcony and they call us out there because it was Durban boy's eyes they they stay in it it's called The Domain they got a dominant he was the exactly player and he was a big size guy so when he went there as we have to climb up the ladder so he said when I see police I kill that's what he says so all the policemen now they were fighting the claim of this letter so anyway we managed to claim up the ladder because he went to he moved apart and all went as soon as I went up I said hold your peace in the name of Jesus Amen and he just went like this I just spoke to him later amen amen so I told the guys I said to you we had a lot of police one day quite a few of them and he was alone I said this is a demon case because it manifested itself right so I told him it's a demon case and the left is that so what one of the policemen I went from behind him now from where this guy was telling there was a staircase and it's a squares it's a corridor you know you get to say the square part of the staircase the corridor and then you got the stairs so the guy pulled him from behind he tried to like throttle him from behind and try to put him down this demon whoops hit the pull all this policemen hit them badly and they were quite well for policeman there too all of them
