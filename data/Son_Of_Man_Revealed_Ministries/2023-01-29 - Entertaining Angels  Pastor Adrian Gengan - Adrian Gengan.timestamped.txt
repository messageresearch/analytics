[6:19] He will be faithful to bless us amen so
[6:22] I pray that you all blessed let's go
[6:24] into the word of the Lord this morning
[6:25] amen hallelujah
[6:28] easily worthy to be praised let's turn
[6:30] to Hebrews book of Hebrews
[6:34] chapter 13.
[6:36] and we'll read verse 2.
[6:46] Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 2.
[6:53] we'll speak for a little uh title in the
[6:57] subject and I'll just says be not
[7:00] forgetful
[7:02] strangers by some amen you may be seated
[7:05] may the Lord and blessings to the
[7:06] reading of his word amen
[7:13] we find we're living in a very exciting
[7:16] time
[7:18] amen
[7:20] we're living at the brink
[7:23] of the closing of the Gentile
[7:25] dispensation amen
[7:30] and the title this morning will be
[7:32] entertaining Angels amen taken from that
[7:35] scripture
[7:38] so in this body that we live in
[7:43] we are limited to what we can see
[7:48] but there's more going on in this
[7:50] three-dimensional world
[7:52] than what meets the human eye
[7:56] amen there is an Unseen World that the
[7:58] natural man can miss
[8:02] but we can train ourselves
[8:05] to be more sensitive to the Unseen World
[8:10] amen
[8:13] now Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 is
[8:16] talking about the lives of the Prophet
[8:18] coming before the great as I references
[8:21] scriptures you can throw them up amen
[8:23] Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 because
[8:25] I want also these scriptures to be
[8:28] embedded in the Arts of the young people
[8:31] these are our scriptures young people
[8:33] amen you've got to know these Scriptures
[8:35] it pertains to the hour that we have
[8:37] because we have received the Elijah the
[8:40] prophet in our day yeah
[8:43] now when Elijah the prophet comes he's
[8:45] going to turn off heart back to the
[8:47] faith of the original Pentecostal
[8:49] fathers amen now when our hearts are
[8:52] turned back to the original Pentecostal
[8:54] fathers
[8:56] and we're looking at the book of Acts
[8:58] because that's the Pentecostal father
[8:59] does everybody agree
[9:01] and we look at the book of Acts and
[9:03] we've got to see a mirror mirror image
[9:06] of ourselves
[9:09] amen and the book of Acts is it's
[9:13] actually the acts of the Holy Spirit
[9:16] in the apostles
[9:19] amen and you cannot deny the working of
[9:22] the supernatural power of God
[9:24] in that early church
[9:28] now we have received the opening of the
[9:30] word we have received the word because
[9:33] remember man made Theology and programs
[9:36] could only lead us so far
[9:39] in fact we gave the Catholic Church a
[9:42] chance
[9:43] gave the denominational World a chance
[9:46] and they could not meet enzyme
[9:49] conditions
[9:50] Amen in fact men on their own had failed
[9:54] completely
[9:57] and that is why at the end of this
[10:00] seventh Church age at the end of the
[10:02] Legacy and church age man God cannot
[10:05] rely on just men
[10:07] and even though he got his seventh angel
[10:10] Prophet on the Earth
[10:12] the prophet can only move up until a
[10:15] certain point
[10:16] so there's got to come in word from this
[10:19] Unseen World
[10:20] in Revelation 10
[10:24] . so the word that we are receiving you
[10:26] cannot find it in a Bible School
[10:29] you can search every Bible School you
[10:31] will never find the revelation of the
[10:33] hour
[10:34] it came via an angel a mighty angel in
[10:38] the Bible says
[10:40] amen so God at so set it forth that a
[10:43] mighty Angel would come with the most
[10:45] important message to give us a faith to
[10:48] take a translation in this hour the
[10:51] changing of our bodies so we are not
[10:53] living in ordinary times amen we are
[10:57] living in extraordinary times amen
[11:00] amen so we've got to be sensitive to the
[11:03] things of God now the prophet would say
[11:05] here we can go to the first slide with a
[11:07] quote he's talking about electricity
[11:09] and he's bringing this as a type he says
[11:12] there's no one in the world that knows
[11:14] what electricity is
[11:17] amen
[11:19] he says they can harness it they can
[11:22] make light they can cook with it they
[11:24] can heat it
[11:26] they can light with it but no one knows
[11:29] what it is it take two pieces of
[11:31] material rolling together makes the
[11:34] continuity and sends out the electricity
[11:37] so that's the way when a Christian gets
[11:40] to working with God rolling together
[11:42] that brings an unseen force that does
[11:46] Mysteries that none of us knows nothing
[11:48] about amen amen
[11:50] amen
[11:51] Hallelujah
[11:54] you and I are not ordinary people
[11:57] even if you take us in our secular jobs
[12:00] in our secular position you are not an
[12:02] ordinary person
[12:03] you're an extraordinary person
[12:06] amen amen have you ever seen a holy
[12:10] ghost-field policeman
[12:11] well we have two of them yet
[12:16] and these are unconventional policemen
[12:20] because they carry an anointing
[12:23] have you ever seen holy ghostful lawyers
[12:27] when we got two of them and more on the
[12:31] way
[12:32] in there
[12:35] amen
[12:37] you put that in your line of work and
[12:39] what you do I'm bringing it down to the
[12:41] Natural because you are not ordinary
[12:44] amen if you are in the flesh then yes
[12:47] you are ordinary then you are just an
[12:49] electrician you're just a burger
[12:52] but when you're born again you know Born
[12:55] Again electrician
[12:56] you're a born-again businessman amen you
[12:59] don't do things according to the world
[13:01] Amen you're an anointed son and daughter
[13:04] of God and every place that you go you
[13:07] carry this anointing with you
[13:09] what am I trying to say you carry this
[13:11] unseen force and Unseen World with you
[13:14] amen amen and we've got to become more
[13:17] conscious of this world
[13:20] we cannot operate in the ordinary
[13:22] anymore
[13:24] amen if we want to go forward with the
[13:27] things of God and his program in this
[13:29] hour we've got to mirror ourselves back
[13:32] with the book of Acts yes
[13:34] and I mentioned this on Wednesday if we
[13:37] take the message church as a whole
[13:41] there's a key element missing
[13:44] and that's the moving of the angel of
[13:46] God
[13:49] now we can hide behind yes the angel of
[13:51] God is moving through the opening of the
[13:53] word yes
[13:54] undeniable
[13:56] we know it
[13:58] we've seen it we've heard it
[14:01] but they've also seen physical
[14:02] manifestations of the angel of God they
[14:05] actually saw the angel of God Amen
[14:08] amen
[14:10] and the angel of God can appear in many
[14:13] forms amen
[14:14] now if we go to that second slide there
[14:17] the second slide of that scripture I've
[14:20] got something highlighted there
[14:23] amen not this we need to get to the
[14:25] scripture when I say scripture I mean
[14:26] scripture not quote amen Hebrews chapter
[14:29] 13.
[14:31] it says here be not forgetful
[14:35] amen
[14:37] so what is he saying Human Condition can
[14:40] make us forgetful right
[14:43] amen be not forgetful
[14:46] what makes people forgetful
[14:49] especially with age
[14:52] it's called amnesia
[14:55] amen
[14:56] but a word has been given to us in this
[14:59] hour to take away our amnesia
[15:02] so he says be not forgetful
[15:05] to entertain strangers
[15:08] now these angels now they are mining
[15:11] angels and there is the angel of God
[15:13] many angels can visit us in our homes
[15:16] amen
[15:18] and if you have ever met the met an
[15:20] angel of God
[15:22] how many of you ever had an encounter
[15:24] let me see your hand I wear an encounter
[15:26] with an angel of God amen amen
[15:29] but I want you to know that more people
[15:32] have had encounters with angels and what
[15:34] raised their hands
[15:36] sometimes we appear to us in forms that
[15:38] we did not recognize
[15:40] Sometimes they come in the form of a man
[15:44] but yes amen so the Bible says be not
[15:47] forgetful to entertain strangers amen he
[15:51] says because thereby some have
[15:54] entertained angels unawares amen amen
[15:58] unaware we have entertained these angels
[16:00] amen
[16:03] now we have got to make room in our
[16:05] lives to entertain his presence
[16:09] and the only way we can do that is to
[16:12] start changing the atmosphere around us
[16:14] all right amen we cannot expect to live
[16:17] in the world and do the things of the
[16:19] world and expect to have Angelic
[16:21] visitation and the presence of God in
[16:23] our homes
[16:25] amen we've got to do introspection and
[16:28] see and get away everything that's not
[16:30] of God
[16:33] amen
[16:34] I'm going to reference now and we can
[16:37] get to it you can open it up in your
[16:38] scripture amen Genesis chapter 18.
[16:46] this is the second time that the AIM
[16:48] that an angel is mentioned
[16:50] in scripture the first time in fact it's
[16:53] quite surprising you think the angel of
[16:56] God would appear
[16:59] two
[17:00] two a Believer first
[17:02] I mean if you know the angels of God
[17:04] appeared to the first time it was aega
[17:08] amen you remember when she ran away from
[17:11] Sarah
[17:13] the angel of God appeared to her and
[17:16] told her go back
[17:18] amen
[17:19] so watch even
[17:23] we would regard that as unbelief right
[17:25] Abraham impregnating agar but the angels
[17:28] of God was concerned about it he was
[17:30] even concerned about the seed that was
[17:32] in her and he said I'll make this nation
[17:34] a great nation amen
[17:37] so in Genesis 18 it says the Lord
[17:40] appeared unto Abraham in the plains of
[17:42] memory and he said that the tent Door In
[17:45] the Heat of the day
[17:47] and he lifts up his eyes and he sees
[17:49] three men
[17:51] standing by him
[17:52] and he runs to the tent door
[17:55] and he bows himself to the ground so
[17:58] watch worship amen watch how he's
[18:00] entertaining the Angels amen
[18:04] amen
[18:05] he says if I found favor in your stride
[18:07] past not
[18:10] let me get a little bit of water
[18:12] now watch he gets to the physical yeah
[18:15] and I can show you numerous times in the
[18:18] Bible where food and water is involved
[18:21] yeah
[18:22] the Unseen comes to the natural world
[18:25] and the partake of natural substances
[18:28] amen
[18:29] amen so don't be afraid to entertain
[18:31] strangers and give one another food amen
[18:34] amen
[18:36] because the angel of God
[18:39] and the spirit of God that's living
[18:41] within you you can also entertain that
[18:45] there's nothing wrong with you inviting
[18:48] me me inviting you over a meal amen like
[18:50] we're going to see
[18:52] in fact
[18:54] if you don't want to really do it I'm
[18:57] going to make you do good to everyone
[18:59] I'm just going to come visit you and
[19:01] expect something
[19:03] because the Bible says that even if you
[19:06] offer something
[19:08] to one of these little ones
[19:11] amen address you want
[19:14] so I'm going to force you not to be mean
[19:16] yes
[19:20] amen I know you're not mean amen I know
[19:23] you're very giving people amen but watch
[19:26] how he gets you entertaining he doesn't
[19:29] think of some super super spiritual
[19:31] thing he doesn't go for his message book
[19:35] learn now it doesn't go for his message
[19:37] book
[19:38] it doesn't go for any literature
[19:42] he sees the need and he says let me get
[19:45] you water let me wash your feet
[19:49] and he says rest under the tree
[19:53] I will fetch a morsel of bread Comfort
[19:56] your hearts and after that you can go
[19:58] right he tells him now watch and they
[20:01] said do as thou I said so they were in
[20:05] agreement
[20:06] amen with hospitality
[20:10] amen they were in agreement with
[20:12] entertaining the angel of God
[20:16] so Abraham Eastern into the tent and to
[20:19] Sarah
[20:20] I want you to catch just because the
[20:22] prophet had intent vision
[20:25] and all the while while there was
[20:28] Angelic presentation shower remained in
[20:30] the tent
[20:34] amen didn't the prophet see a little
[20:37] room in the tent
[20:39] amen amen
[20:41] Hallelujah
[20:43] now watch Supernatural things are going
[20:45] to happen to Sarah and a word of
[20:47] Prophecy is going to be given to her
[20:49] while she remains in the tent amen
[20:54] amen amen
[20:57] so Abraham goes and he makes really
[20:59] three measures of fine meal now I can
[21:01] take each thing and type it out with
[21:03] Christ right because you know the meal
[21:05] offering amen you see that the meal of
[21:08] ring and he makes cakes upon the earth
[21:10] now if you were to go back to Eastern
[21:12] tradition you will know he was making
[21:14] some nice parathas
[21:16] awesome non-bread
[21:21] that's how they make this thing right
[21:24] falling out quickly I don't have time to
[21:26] dwell in detail then he runs through the
[21:28] herd and he gets a young lamb come on I
[21:31] need to decide to wake up I'm not
[21:32] getting any image from this side
[21:34] he said brother Joshua
[21:37] amen it sounds like I'm listening in
[21:40] mono
[21:41] if you know what mono is I need stereo
[21:45] amen otherwise I'm going to shift you
[21:47] all around and put some amen people on
[21:49] this side and put some people on this
[21:50] side
[21:52] amen
[21:54] and he says to settle back to the side
[21:55] because she was a good amen calling her
[21:57] this side amen you know they say uh you
[22:00] you get influenced by the people around
[22:02] you so if the people around you are not
[22:04] saying amen maybe they push you there so
[22:06] you can scream amen very strategic move
[22:08] there amen
[22:10] Hallelujah so maybe a little fire a man
[22:13] will liven up all of us amen can I get
[22:16] some emails from the back
[22:18] amen hallelujah yes yes amen
[22:21] we're talking about an atmosphere
[22:23] Abraham was trying to create an
[22:24] atmosphere so don't even now while I
[22:27] told you that don't get what's wrong
[22:32] I'm not picking I'm trying to make you
[22:34] change the atmosphere
[22:36] amen amen so he says so watch now all of
[22:41] those three things go and study it he
[22:43] takes fine meal amen he takes a young
[22:45] tender lamb and you know who the lamb
[22:47] represented amen and he takes all of
[22:50] these things and he begins to sacrifice
[22:51] it because the one sitting in front of
[22:54] him will become all of those sacrifices
[22:56] amen
[22:58] amen and then look he took butter and
[23:02] more
[23:05] and enjoyed it add garlic garlic now
[23:08] [Music]
[23:10] it messed it and he said it before them
[23:12] and stood under the tree and they didn't
[23:14] eat and watched after that way Sarah thy
[23:17] wife in the tent vision
[23:21] she's still in the tent Vision yes
[23:26] amen
[23:28] and I want you to know she remains in
[23:30] the tent
[23:32] even while the discernment is taking
[23:34] place pay attention now while the
[23:36] prophet Ministry is going on she's still
[23:38] mailed behind the tent amen
[23:41] because they are no not being a mess
[23:43] right right
[23:46] I'll be following this if you know 10
[23:48] Vision you know what I'm talking about
[23:52] and he tells and now what's the
[23:54] discernment because he entertain the
[23:56] angel of God
[23:59] Supernatural things are going to start
[24:01] to take place
[24:02] and this is God in the scripture this is
[24:05] dealing with the body change yes amen
[24:10] this same Mighty Angel appeared in this
[24:12] day in Revelation 10.
[24:15] and now if you know there is also eating
[24:18] taking place in Revelation 10. amen
[24:24] amen
[24:25] so he took what he says I'm going to
[24:28] return unto thee according to the time
[24:30] of life and Sarah thy wife shall have a
[24:33] son and Sarah Heard It In The Tint door
[24:38] which was behind him
[24:41] so you'll see there 11 is confirming
[24:44] that they were old and stricken in age
[24:45] so this is going to take a supernatural
[24:47] intervention for Cerro is part of the
[24:50] age of childbearing to now be a child
[24:53] amen amen amen
[24:55] so you know the terror laughs we're not
[24:57] going into all of that my point was I
[24:59] want to show you that they entertain the
[25:02] angel of God Amen
[25:05] job 29 and verse 12 says
[25:08] because I deliver the poor that cried
[25:11] and the fatherless and him there had
[25:14] none to help him
[25:16] this is beautiful now
[25:20] job 29 you know what they say job is one
[25:23] of the oldest books in the Bible
[25:26] John 29 and verse 12. he says because I
[25:29] delivered the poor that cried
[25:32] are we hearing the cries of the poor
[25:36] and the fatherless
[25:38] and him that had none to help him
[25:41] the blessing of him that was ready to
[25:45] perish Came Upon me
[25:50] there's a blessing attached to it
[25:53] did you follow amen amen he says the
[25:56] blessing of the one that is about to
[25:57] perish Came Upon me
[26:00] and I caused the Widow's heart to sing
[26:03] for Joy amen
[26:06] amen amen I caused the Widow's heart to
[26:08] sing for joy
[26:10] hallelujah amen moving along now amen
[26:14] God can use you and God can use the
[26:17] prophets and God can use situations and
[26:20] circumstances in our lives
[26:22] to bring about a blessing upon us
[26:25] now we come to Elijah the prophet in
[26:27] First Kings chapter 17.
[26:29] I'm going to move through these stories
[26:31] very quickly
[26:32] here it is now now remember I'm gonna go
[26:35] from Elijah to Elijah and show you
[26:37] something here amen so Elijah is typing
[26:39] the prophet
[26:40] and Elisha is typing the bride everybody
[26:43] say amen amen amen so Elijah the cheese
[26:47] fight you know
[26:48] he's coming before air
[26:51] and he is causing judgment to come upon
[26:54] the land because AF was walking wickedly
[26:56] before the Lord and he caused Israel to
[26:58] sin
[27:00] so what did he say they shall not be due
[27:03] or Reign for three years
[27:07] but according to my word
[27:09] right so the Lord tells him in verse 3
[27:11] get the ants tell the Eastward and hide
[27:13] themselves by the Brookshire that is
[27:15] before Jordan and it shall be that thou
[27:18] shalt drink of the brook as I have
[27:20] commanded the Ravens to feed thee there
[27:26] and he did according to the word of the
[27:28] Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook
[27:30] sheriff and the Ravens brought him bread
[27:32] and flesh in the morning
[27:36] so not only can we entertain the angel
[27:38] of God
[27:40] or the angels of God but God can also
[27:43] provide Supernatural food for us amen
[27:48] Ravens are bringing bread and flesh in
[27:50] the morning and bread and flesh in the
[27:52] evening and he drank off the brook
[27:55] and he came to pass after a while that
[27:57] the brook dried up because there had
[27:59] been no rain in the land now learn
[28:01] something from this now
[28:03] the judgments of God that are coming
[28:05] upon the Earth even now the vials that
[28:07] are being poured on
[28:09] even the Believers I will be subjected
[28:11] to it
[28:12] to all the economic crisis and the
[28:15] turmoil that's happening the Believers
[28:17] will be affected by it
[28:21] because the land of the Prophet said
[28:23] there'll be no rain and even himself had
[28:25] to endure Without Rain
[28:29] and God did not make it Supernatural
[28:32] that he would have water only I'm
[28:34] talking about now in the wilderness
[28:35] there
[28:36] God could have continued letting the
[28:38] brook to run yeah and let Ravens feed
[28:41] him
[28:42] but God subjected his own prophet
[28:46] to the Judgment of the Earth
[28:50] that even the brook that he was drinking
[28:52] from dried up yes
[28:55] so the believer is is affected by the
[28:57] Judgment that is passed on the Earth
[29:00] that is why you're feeling it
[29:01] economically tough times now
[29:03] you're feeling it hard
[29:06] you cannot get anything from the grocery
[29:07] stores
[29:09] amen with the money that we once spent
[29:12] 500 before you could get some decent
[29:14] stuff now very few items
[29:17] amen so you are experiencing
[29:20] difficulties because of the judgments
[29:23] that are being poured out upon the Earth
[29:27] anybody feeling it
[29:29] anybody feeling it
[29:32] anybody feeling it when you get to the
[29:33] gas stations
[29:36] amen
[29:38] so some of the judgments you don't know
[29:39] it but why are they subjecting the Earth
[29:43] to the Greenpeace deal
[29:47] everyone must conform to it
[29:54] because the Judgment of the Lord
[29:56] apparted upon the Earth and God is going
[29:58] to destroy them that destroyed the Earth
[30:01] man has destroyed the Earth it has shook
[30:04] the Earth of its materials
[30:06] and pollute to the Earth
[30:09] not only immorally but also physically
[30:16] but the Caleb was sharing something we
[30:18] shared this a few months ago or last
[30:20] year but he reminded us amen they put
[30:22] the new Doomsday Clock out
[30:24] yeah
[30:25] and they said 90s remember the prophet
[30:27] preached three minutes to midnight now
[30:29] they're saying 90 seconds to midnight
[30:33] amen
[30:37] so the Lord will sustain us through all
[30:40] of it
[30:42] because the Lord is going to sustain
[30:44] Elijah the prophet now
[30:46] and when we follow the lord he will work
[30:49] all things together for our good amen
[30:55] so the Lord instructs him to go to the
[30:58] Widow of zeropheth
[31:01] we just read the scripture right he's
[31:03] going to cause the Widow's heart to sing
[31:05] that was in job
[31:06] sing for joy
[31:10] in other words the twofold purpose for
[31:13] God doing the supernatural in This
[31:15] Woman's life
[31:19] so he goes to zeropheth and he says I
[31:22] have commanded him with a woman to
[31:24] sustain thee there amen he said I
[31:27] commanded that you do it yes but when he
[31:30] gets here the woman knows nothing about
[31:31] it
[31:37] amen so the woman comes to the gate the
[31:41] Bible says in verse 10 of the city and
[31:43] behold the woman was gathering sticks
[31:46] the prophet says she was taking two
[31:48] sticks to make the last fire and have a
[31:51] last meal
[31:53] and she and a son were preparing
[31:55] emotionally physically
[31:58] they were preparing mentally that this
[32:00] is going to be our last meal
[32:02] and we are going to die
[32:07] and even as you begin you can turn to
[32:10] Psalm 37 they put it up on there
[32:13] amen even as she began
[32:16] to walk
[32:17] now remember this is after the days of
[32:20] King David
[32:21] the Psalms are already written
[32:24] and while she's Gathering the streets
[32:27] she begins to recite his sound
[32:29] trust in the Lord and do good
[32:31] so shall not dwell in the land
[32:34] and verily Thou shalt be fed she starts
[32:37] to remember the word of God Amen
[32:40] she starts to recite the word of God and
[32:43] she says Delight thyself in the Lord and
[32:45] He Shall give you the desires of your
[32:47] heart she says commit your ways to the
[32:49] Lord and Trust all to heal him and he
[32:51] shall bring it to pass amen amen amen
[32:55] she goes to verse 7 it says rest in the
[32:57] Lord and wait patiently for him fret not
[32:59] thyself
[33:01] because of him who prospered in his way
[33:03] because of the man who bringeth Wicked
[33:05] devices to pass and she goes to verse 11
[33:08] and says the meek shall inherit the
[33:10] earth
[33:11] and shall Delight themselves in the
[33:14] abundance of peace
[33:16] amen
[33:24] then she goes to verse 23 and she says
[33:28] the steps of a good man are ordered of
[33:30] the Lord he delighted in his way though
[33:32] he fall he shall not be utterly cast
[33:34] down for the Lord upolded him with his
[33:37] hand and now she says I have been Young
[33:40] she remembers this verse now of King
[33:42] David
[33:43] and says and now I am old
[33:46] and yet I have never seen the righteous
[33:48] forsaken no exceed begging amen
[33:56] Now watch how the Holy Spirit tied that
[33:59] psalming with the scripture amen
[34:01] because after this meal
[34:04] what would she have to do if she wanted
[34:05] to survive
[34:06] she would have to
[34:08] be big
[34:10] but you remember the scripture
[34:13] I have never seen the righteous forsaken
[34:16] no is he begging bread
[34:20] and just about then Elijah calls to her
[34:23] we need to go back to the description
[34:24] says fetch me I pray thee a little water
[34:27] in your vessel
[34:29] an emotion of bread in that hand now
[34:32] notice the continuity of where we
[34:34] started it's dealing with bread and
[34:36] water and natural things
[34:38] and when we become obedient to these
[34:41] kind of things and hospitality and
[34:42] entertain strangers
[34:44] it opens up the Unseen World yeah
[34:50] and she says as long as the Lord God
[34:52] liveth I am not King but I am full of
[34:55] meal in the barrel yes it again being in
[34:57] the barrel
[34:58] and a little oil in the cruise and I'm
[35:01] gathering two sticks that I might go in
[35:03] and dress it for me and my son we may
[35:05] eat and die and Elijah said unto our
[35:08] fear not go and do as thou I said but
[35:11] make me therefore a little cake first
[35:13] amen yes amen
[35:19] Hallelujah and bring it unto me and
[35:22] after make for thee and thy son
[35:27] and she went and did a calling to the
[35:29] saying of Elijah and she said
[35:33] and she and he and the house did eat
[35:35] many days right how many days you say
[35:38] and the barrel of meal wasted not amen
[35:42] neither did the crews of oil fail
[35:44] according to the word of the Lord which
[35:46] he spake by Elijah
[35:49] amen so there's a reason the Lord is
[35:52] sending him to the Widow
[35:54] not only for him to sustain her
[35:57] through this difficult time because the
[35:59] judgments are passed upon Israel
[36:03] but also because Elijah is going to be
[36:06] there
[36:08] he also needs sustenance through three
[36:11] and a half years
[36:12] and the Lord is not going to send him
[36:14] house to house baking yes
[36:16] yes he's coming to a specific woman amen
[36:19] good during the time
[36:22] of the judgments remember amateur
[36:26] judgments are upon the Earth
[36:28] and the word of the Lord has come to a
[36:30] specific woman in this hour amen and the
[36:32] word is remaining with her yes amen
[36:35] through the judgments amen amen and as
[36:39] long as the prophet stayed with her and
[36:42] she stayed with the prophet they were
[36:44] going to make it through the time of
[36:46] famine amen amen this was God's provided
[36:49] place of sustenance for Elijah and it
[36:51] was also a provided way for the woman to
[36:54] make it through the famine that's the
[36:56] message we've been given in this hour
[36:58] Amen to make it to spiritual famine but
[37:01] we've got to stay with the prophet and
[37:03] his message
[37:07] amen this was the meeting and a Divine
[37:10] Arrangement that was going to lead to a
[37:12] greater miracle for the women
[37:14] now watch
[37:15] beautiful type you know Elijah is typing
[37:18] the prophet
[37:19] and we know that our Elijah the prophet
[37:21] what in a great what Ministry Healing
[37:24] Ministry
[37:28] amen
[37:30] you'll find in verse 17 it goes where it
[37:33] says the one the Mistress of the house
[37:35] felt sick a sickness was so sore and
[37:38] there was no breath in it the son of the
[37:40] woman right so the woman's son goes sick
[37:44] and Elijah said what have I to do with
[37:47] thee o man of God at that time to call
[37:49] my sin to remembrance and slay my son
[37:51] and he said unto a gift so the son does
[37:54] not die the sun is sick
[37:58] and he performs
[38:00] a sign
[38:02] and the sign is healing
[38:06] so you'll find here in verse 22 the Lord
[38:08] the voice of Elijah and the soul of the
[38:10] child came into him again and revived
[38:12] and Elijah took the child and brought
[38:14] him down under the chamber into the
[38:16] house and delivered him unto the mother
[38:18] and said see thy son liveth and the
[38:21] woman said to Elijah now by this I know
[38:23] that what a man of God and that the word
[38:26] of the Lord is in thy mouth is truth
[38:28] amen
[38:29] amen
[38:31] so that Elijah meeting the woman of
[38:35] xerophyll the widow woman right
[38:37] but Elisha who is the type of the bride
[38:41] and has a double portion anointing amen
[38:46] also meets another woman amen
[38:50] amen you'll find this in second Kings
[38:51] chapter four we'll start at verse eight
[38:53] and this is the shulamite woman
[38:57] amen
[38:58] one brought healing to the boy
[39:05] there was healing in the days of the
[39:06] prophet
[39:09] but are they double portion anointing
[39:12] shall come forth the resurrection of the
[39:14] Dead
[39:15] shall come forth the resurrection of the
[39:17] sleeping Saints amen
[39:22] because yeah the sunamite woman is
[39:24] bearing and unfruitful
[39:26] you know that
[39:28] watch again verse 8 it fell on a day
[39:31] Elijah passed to show them where was a
[39:33] great woman and she constrained him to
[39:36] eat what
[39:38] bread
[39:41] and so it was that ought as he passed by
[39:43] it until that we eat bread
[39:46] sell the physical elements
[39:49] still Hospitality still entertaining
[39:52] strangers
[39:54] and she said unto a husband
[39:56] see she doesn't know who he is she just
[39:58] knows he's a stranger but she talks to
[40:00] her husband and says I perceive that
[40:02] this is a holy man of God which passeth
[40:05] us continually
[40:07] yeah
[40:09] let us make a chain by praying on the
[40:11] wall let us set for him there bed a
[40:13] table stool Candlestick and it shall be
[40:16] when he comes he shall turn internal
[40:20] so you know the he comes in there and
[40:22] then the prophet asks and he says
[40:27] in verse 13 that was being careful to
[40:30] take care of us what it should be done
[40:32] for thee
[40:34] can we speak to the king the captain of
[40:36] The Host
[40:37] and
[40:39] because he said verily she had no child
[40:42] her husband is old and he said call her
[40:44] and when he had called her she stood at
[40:46] the door and about the season according
[40:48] to the time of what
[40:53] according to the time of life same thing
[40:55] in Genesis 18 thou shall Embrace a son
[41:00] now this is a spoken word by the bride
[41:03] Ministry amen amen you shall have a son
[41:07] yeah
[41:08] you shall have a daughter
[41:09] you shall have whatsoever you desire
[41:11] amen spoken word under the bright
[41:14] Ministry
[41:19] and verse 17 says the woman conceived
[41:21] bear son at the season that Elisha had
[41:24] said unto her according to the time of
[41:26] life
[41:27] pay attention now
[41:29] the Joshua labeled last week and he told
[41:31] you the angel of God moving in a
[41:32] specific season right we're telling you
[41:34] the season is open now amen amen but if
[41:39] you know well if you read the proper
[41:40] message when the hunting season is open
[41:42] that's when they went hunting
[41:44] when the answer of season is closed they
[41:46] didn't go until
[41:48] when it's the right time and the right
[41:50] season you got to move for the things of
[41:52] God Amen we cannot remain in the old and
[41:55] expect new things yeah
[41:57] amen right
[42:00] so what a better than unfruitful woman
[42:02] brings forth a child
[42:05] so what is this a type of
[42:07] this is type of Peter
[42:10] that this woman is now built up into the
[42:12] pyramid because Peter says if these
[42:14] things abide in you that's Faith virtue
[42:16] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[42:18] brotherly kindness you'll be neither
[42:20] Barren nor unfruitful amen so this woman
[42:22] has all the virtues now we know she has
[42:25] produced the word son the spoken word
[42:27] son is now standing in manifestation
[42:31] even in your life you can see the Son of
[42:34] God revealed in your life you are a son
[42:36] and daughter of God Amen you can see the
[42:38] life is on display amen
[42:43] amen amen
[42:44] surely amen we have come so far in the
[42:46] message and all of the word we were has
[42:48] produced the sun in our life
[42:51] has produced the image in our life
[42:55] amen
[42:57] amen but now the boys in the field
[43:01] working with the Reapers
[43:03] and you know that the sun strikes him
[43:05] and he says my head and the boy dies
[43:09] you know what happens the woman settles
[43:12] and asks and she goes out to The Prophet
[43:14] where does she go to mount Kama what is
[43:18] Mount Carmel the original place where
[43:21] the hearts of their children were turned
[43:23] back to the faith of their fathers
[43:27] yes so she goes back to the place where
[43:31] her heart was turned back
[43:33] and that's where we are coming back to
[43:35] we are remembering what has turned our
[43:38] hearts back to the faith of the original
[43:40] Pentecostal fathers because the time has
[43:43] passed by and people have forgotten the
[43:46] Gen truths the hidden mysteries of God
[43:48] that were revealed to us and the power
[43:51] that's associated with those Mysteries
[43:57] because this word has come to release
[43:59] her power and an anointing upon the
[44:02] bride yes we have not had seven Shields
[44:05] revealed to us and seven Church ages and
[44:08] seven trumpets and seven viles and all
[44:11] the Mysteries found in Revelation for us
[44:13] to be ordinary Church going members but
[44:16] we are the supernatural Church of God we
[44:19] are the Invincible Army that's Rising
[44:21] our amen we are the Church of the move
[44:23] that is being led by the angel of God
[44:26] Amen giving praise amen
[44:29] amen hallelujah
[44:32] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[44:35] she gets to working amen so what
[44:38] happened she does not want to see the
[44:41] image of Christ that is now in
[44:42] manifestation die yeah
[44:45] don't let that image die yes
[44:48] amen because remember the situation
[44:51] around you will affect you we just labor
[44:54] to show you that let us here is still
[44:56] going on around us and he's trying to
[44:59] kill the man child
[45:00] The Same Spirit that existed in the
[45:02] first Exodus they tried to kill Moses
[45:05] existed in the second Exodus where they
[45:08] tried to kill Jesus existing the Third
[45:10] Exodus where they're trying to kill the
[45:12] Christ in you amen thank you amen that's
[45:16] right you cannot make the word of God
[45:18] lie it's then every type and every
[45:21] shadow
[45:22] amen amen
[45:24] so they're trying to kill the Sun
[45:26] amen but she believes in a resurrection
[45:30] all the while she's making her way to
[45:32] mount Palmer the sun is dead
[45:35] there's no move
[45:37] there's no manifestation
[45:40] look even in your own lives if you are
[45:42] dead if you are barren
[45:45] amen
[45:46] if you have caused Christ to die twice
[45:48] the word to die in your life
[45:51] all the while she's moving to Mount
[45:53] Carmel and the prophet back to the
[45:55] prophet's message
[45:57] the sun is dead
[45:59] but that doesn't deter from going back
[46:01] to the world the prophet says find out
[46:04] where you left him and go back to that
[46:07] place
[46:08] and make it right

[49:24] to entertaining strangers
[49:28] be sensitive to the angels of God
[49:31] amen Jesus said in Matthew 10 40.
[49:36] here's our Lord Jesus Christ now who is
[49:38] Jesus
[49:40] I want to I'm looking for three words
[49:42] Jesus is
[49:45] who is Jesus now I'm not looking for
[49:47] that I'm on I want a three-letter word
[49:49] starts with G Jesus is
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] come on I want you to help the young
[49:55] people because they need to establish
[49:57] these things in their heart who is Jesus
[49:59] Jesus is God
[50:02] Matthew 10 and verse 40.
[50:05] says he that receiveth you receiveth me
[50:09] amen and he that receiveth me receiveth
[50:13] him that sent me
[50:14] he that receiveth a prophet in the name
[50:17] of a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[50:19] reward and he that receives a righteous
[50:22] man in the name of a righteous man shall
[50:25] receive a righteous man's reward
[50:28] and whosoever shall give unto these
[50:31] little ones a cup of cold water only in
[50:34] the name of a disciple verily I say unto
[50:37] you he shall in no wise lose his reward
[50:41] are you a disciple of Christ amen
[50:45] amen then give opportunity for people to
[50:49] be kind to you
[50:50] you know the Bible also says that God
[50:53] loves a cheerful Giver
[50:56] but you know sometimes people have a
[50:58] problem with receiving
[51:00] sometimes you give them something no I
[51:02] don't want it
[51:04] no man you take it you'll give it to
[51:06] someone else
[51:07] people have a hard time receiving
[51:09] they're making the person lose their
[51:11] blessing because what did the scripture
[51:14] just say now
[51:15] they won't lose their reward
[51:18] yes
[51:21] amen so be gracious to care but also be
[51:24] gracious to receive amen and say brother
[51:26] I thank you so much I really appreciate
[51:29] it may the Lord bless you
[51:32] amen
[51:33] because you don't know with one heart
[51:36] and what intention that person is giving
[51:38] perhaps the Lord told him to give them
[51:40] to you
[51:45] but you're looking at that 10 grand and
[51:47] you are thinking what am I going to do
[51:48] with this 10 grand give it to somebody
[51:50] else sure
[51:53] but God is checking your heart
[51:56] amen God wants to see what what heart
[51:58] you receive them
[52:00] amen
[52:01] Hallelujah
[52:03] in Matthew 25 and verse 34
[52:07] Jesus now talking about the kingdom now
[52:10] you really know that Matthew 25 deals
[52:12] with the seventh seal because it's
[52:13] talking about the kingdom because
[52:15] Matthew 24 he preaches all six seals
[52:18] Everybody follow
[52:20] Matthew 24 he preaches all six seals
[52:23] Matthew 25 is dealing with the kingdom
[52:25] and we're going to read from verse 34
[52:27] where the king is going to say come here
[52:30] blessed of my father he never the
[52:32] kingdom prepared for you from the
[52:33] foundation of the world now watch what
[52:35] our lord Jesus says for I was hungered I
[52:38] was hungry and you gave me meat I was
[52:42] thirsty and you gave me drink
[52:49] I was a stranger and you took me in
[52:54] naked and you clothed me I was sick you
[52:57] visit me I was in prison you came to me
[53:00] then shall the rights just answer him
[53:03] and saying Lord when saw we thee and
[53:05] under and fed thee or thirsty and gave
[53:08] the drink when so we be a stranger and
[53:11] took the Inn or naked and lothy or we
[53:13] saw the sequin prison and came unto thee
[53:16] and the King shall answer and say unto
[53:17] them verily I say unto you in so much as
[53:21] you've done it unto the least of my
[53:22] brethren
[53:24] you have done it unto me
[53:28] like the Lord Jesus was standing here in
[53:30] flesh
[53:31] how many of you wouldn't want to take
[53:32] him for lunch
[53:34] I don't know why you're laughing
[53:36] I don't have an agenda behind this point
[53:39] how many of you want to take the Lord
[53:41] Jesus for lunch
[53:49] not only for lunch we will tell brother
[53:51] Ramesh you're taking for lunch please do
[53:53] not feed him too much because I'm taking
[53:54] him for supper
[53:57] give him a light lunch right
[54:04] but God is ways and opportunity God
[54:06] provided an opportunity for the Widow
[54:10] to entertain a stranger
[54:12] God provided an opportunity
[54:15] for the shulamite woman to entertain a
[54:17] stranger
[54:18] God provided the opportunity for Abraham
[54:21] to entertain a stranger
[54:26] but it happened to be not ordinary
[54:28] people
[54:30] amen
[54:32] then you know the the Lord if you read
[54:34] the rest of the verse the Lord does that
[54:36] in Reverse now and he tells them those
[54:39] that didn't visit him and didn't feed
[54:42] him he says you've done it unto me right
[54:46] what are we doing we are looking for his
[54:49] presence
[54:50] and to entertain his presence
[54:53] because when we entertain his presence
[54:55] it releases the Unseen World
[54:59] a supernatural world
[55:01] amen
[55:03] let me break it down for those of you
[55:05] that didn't get it
[55:07] the Supernatural is not only unlocked in
[55:09] the prayer line
[55:11] or in a religious setting yeah in a
[55:14] religious service that's the underlying
[55:16] senior it's happening in your in a
[55:19] natural daily life
[55:21] amen these people are entertaining
[55:23] strangers and in an unlocked
[55:25] Supernatural world today
[55:27] unlock Supernatural experiences to them
[55:31] so the woman received the healing of the
[55:34] son by being kind by entertaining the
[55:36] word
[55:38] look at the woman who came and washed
[55:40] Jesus feet when they didn't want to
[55:42] entertain him in Simon's house
[55:44] she caught the opportunity to entertain
[55:46] Jesus and wash his feet
[55:53] awake they didn't even want to give it a
[55:55] waiter's job to bring the food to Jesus
[55:58] she found the lowest of jobs
[56:02] and she went to washing his feet
[56:06] to what length are we willing to go
[56:09] to accommodate Jesus
[56:10] and to make sure he is comfortable in
[56:13] our homes and in our presence
[56:16] are we willing to take the lowest of
[56:18] jobs
[56:19] or do we always want
[56:22] to be seated in a restaurant
[56:26] he's not always going to have a
[56:27] Zacchaeus moment
[56:28] where are you going to have a feast and
[56:31] you got any abundance and you're going
[56:33] to give back to the poor he's going to
[56:35] provide
[56:36] like Mary now an opportunity for you to
[56:39] wash feet
[56:41] to become low to become humble amen amen
[56:45] Hallelujah
[56:49] we can go through many more scriptures
[56:52] amen let's just find I'm going to close
[56:55] it now because I feel the spirit is
[56:57] right
[56:58] you got the message
[57:00] amen I this I've only touched the
[57:03] introduction part because that was
[57:05] teaching us how to entertain strangers
[57:07] and showing you how the supernatural can
[57:09] be unlocked through the physical
[57:11] but maybe that's where we need to stop
[57:12] and we can go into the other thing some
[57:14] other time amen but
[57:19] maybe we can just read something else
[57:20] right
[57:28] let's read I will go to slide six amen
[57:31] the prophet here says
[57:34] and this is why we emphasize the
[57:36] revelation of the word we must have a
[57:37] revelation of the word yes
[57:39] right he says when you receive the
[57:41] revelation of the word
[57:43] something slips out of the Unseen World
[57:45] Yonder and comes rolling down through a
[57:48] mystical Channel some way into your soul
[57:50] that says now I see your eyes brighten
[57:54] your lips are hung down straighten up
[57:56] and smile every muscle in your body
[57:59] seems to Rejoice amen so watch what the
[58:02] association of the world can do right
[58:04] let's go to the next one he says Angelic
[58:07] beings associate together
[58:10] and I hope you get that
[58:12] that just dropped right down free what
[58:15] is he telling you
[58:17] that's first revelation
[58:19] he says if you've got the holy spirit in
[58:21] you you're a candidate for association
[58:24] with the Unseen World and the
[58:26] supernatural amen
[58:30] amen
[58:33] when you when the Holy Spirit comes into
[58:36] the heart quickly he becomes a twofold
[58:39] being one of the year to die one of the
[58:41] able to live in this body is subject to
[58:44] death but in his soul is passed from
[58:45] Vietnam to life in his body he has
[58:48] Earthly contact with his five senses but
[58:50] in his Spirit he has contact with God
[58:52] through the Holy Ghost and the angels of
[58:55] God visit them
[58:56] speaks with them
[58:58] and they are messengers from God to
[59:01] reveal and to bring messages from God to
[59:04] the individual amen
[59:10] angels are coming
[59:11] bringing messages to us
[59:14] amen he says if a boy is knocking at
[59:17] your door
[59:19] and he's got a telegram for you
[59:21] he would be a messenger or an ugly angel
[59:25] right he says your pastor when he stands
[59:28] here on the platform ministering the
[59:30] word of God he is God's angel to the
[59:31] church Messenger to the church therefore
[59:34] a pastor should never leave that word
[59:36] and stay straight with the word because
[59:39] he's feeding the shepherd's place the
[59:42] word pastor means Shepherd look it up
[59:44] find if it ain't right a posse the
[59:46] shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him
[59:48] overseer over a certain flock
[59:51] feed them with what the word of God
[59:55] Amen let's just leave it right there
[59:57] amen Give the Lord a good answer for
[59:59] praise
[1:00:00] [Applause]
[1:00:02] so God can use natural
[1:00:05] situations
[1:00:07] and I really was rejoicing with that
[1:00:09] part where even Elijah was subject to
[1:00:12] the entire conditions
[1:00:17] his own word brought judgment upon the
[1:00:19] land
[1:00:21] and I indict this generation
[1:00:23] who said that amen the end time prophet
[1:00:28] so we are all subjected to that
[1:00:32] the curse is upon the land
[1:00:35] you can put
[1:00:38] me or you
[1:00:41] as every president in the country
[1:00:43] in every country take a message believe
[1:00:46] and place them in every position make
[1:00:49] them a president of every country it
[1:00:51] will still not change end time prophecy
[1:00:53] this world must be destroyed amen Bible
[1:00:57] scripture must come to pass amen amen
[1:01:00] not even we can stop the judgments of
[1:01:03] God that are coming upon the Earth but I
[1:01:05] want you to know there's a prophecy
[1:01:07] given to you that God will see you
[1:01:08] through this time amen keep trusting God
[1:01:11] keep serving God church God loves you
[1:01:14] amen God is concerned for you amen and
[1:01:17] God will never leave you nor forsake you
[1:01:19] amen I want you to know if you've left
[1:01:21] the Lord if you wandered away from the
[1:01:23] Lord maybe you try to do things of the
[1:01:25] world God is calling you back into an
[1:01:28] association with the Unseen World

[1:02:07] that the angel of God always came from
[1:02:09] the right hand side
[1:02:10] he says because
[1:02:13] the angel was standing at the right hand
[1:02:16] of the altar and he says he always came
[1:02:19] from the right hand side

[1:11:27] you're sharing me his experience amen
[1:11:30] and he shared this testimony before I
[1:11:32] remember it very clearly
[1:11:33] he spoke about him going through his job
[1:11:35] interview
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:39] and I had encountered this man remember
[1:11:42] Julia more from him amen very briefly
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:53] nevertheless amen
[1:11:55] will be prepared to give God all the
[1:11:58] honors Amen in 1989
[1:12:03] first got determine Toyota but before
[1:12:05] that when I went to the interview
[1:12:08] or David and Goliath you know David was
[1:12:11] she the cops in the Sheep no experience
[1:12:15] in Warframe when I got to the interview
[1:12:17] the next morning
[1:12:21] piece of paper that we have the full
[1:12:23] reforms
[1:12:24] there's just not no experience with the
[1:12:26] name mattress
[1:12:27] no experience and then there was the
[1:12:30] other guy with me is he had all the
[1:12:32] experience in the world
[1:12:33] to qualify for this job
[1:12:35] and
[1:12:38] if you ask me
[1:12:40] you don't have any any experience I said
[1:12:42] I have the confidence and as I drove out
[1:12:45] out of the premises
[1:12:49] no I don't know what made me to stop for
[1:12:51] this man he was a
[1:12:54] not a very tall man but he hadn't walked
[1:12:57] white like offline cooked dust coats so
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:02] I asked him like what what was his name
[1:13:04] and what do you think was his name
[1:13:06] he told me his name was David there and
[1:13:09] then I I said Thank You Lord and I've
[1:13:11] already got this job amen so and I just
[1:13:15] started you know testifying about the
[1:13:17] lottery many never spoke but he was just
[1:13:21] listening to me and he was sitting at
[1:13:23] the back in the back seat
[1:13:24] so as we're coming down
[1:13:27] on the entry so you get the road going
[1:13:30] to the South and the north onto them too
[1:13:33] and he told me to leave him just on that
[1:13:36] into the South Dakota last week but
[1:13:41] as you got up the vehicle
[1:13:44] when I looked to them
[1:13:46] there was no one
[1:13:47] in the Lord amen amen hallelujah
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:13:53] so the Bible says be not forgetful
[1:13:58] attained strangers but I'm not telling
[1:14:00] you to pick up everybody
[1:14:02] but being able to have discernment
[1:14:04] to know amen opportunity to be presented
[1:14:07] to us and I'm expecting I told you this
[1:14:10] before amen I'm expecting many more
[1:14:12] testimonies to come from you
[1:14:14] and to tell me your experiences with the
[1:14:17] angel not only the angel of God but the
[1:14:20] prophet is telling us they are minor
[1:14:22] Angels sent to us
[1:14:24] other angels can come to us
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:27] and they can visit our homes
[1:14:29] next time you may go into the conditions
[1:14:32] that need to exist in our homes
[1:14:34] in order to entertain the angels of God
[1:14:37] we're going to come to a point where
[1:14:39] we're going to be serious with God yes
[1:14:41] and you see sometimes it's scary because
[1:14:44] some people call them ghosts
[1:14:48] now let me let me say this way if the
[1:14:51] world
[1:14:52] is so fascinated and they are also
[1:14:56] entertaining fallen angels
[1:14:59] yeah that's right
[1:15:02] most every home is entertaining fallen
[1:15:04] angels
[1:15:06] we have been elected to entertain the
[1:15:08] angel of God Amen
[1:15:10] and sometimes they are destitute they
[1:15:12] don't know where to go because even when
[1:15:14] they come to the believer's homes
[1:15:16] the condition is not right amen the
[1:15:18] atmosphere is not right they go away
[1:15:22] shall I say maybe even hungry
[1:15:24] amen so let us be sensitive to the
[1:15:27] spirit of God be sensitive to what is
[1:15:28] God is doing in the church be sensitive
[1:15:31] to where what is being spoken in the
[1:15:32] church amen and just pray and say Lord
[1:15:36] expecting the supernatural remember what
[1:15:38] we said this is going to be our most
[1:15:39] Supernatural year
[1:15:41] to make Supernatural experiences with
[1:15:43] the Lord
[1:15:44] respect the supernatural to take place
[1:15:46] in your life
[1:15:47] and if you have that expectation in your
[1:15:49] heart God will show up
[1:15:51] amen I guarantee it
[1:15:54] I don't know if you have an expectation
[1:15:55] for the supernatural how many of you had
[1:15:57] an expectation for the move of God how
[1:15:59] many if you want to see more of God amen
[1:16:02] hallelujah amen amen God bless you amen
[1:16:06] so tonight there'll be a afternoon
[1:16:07] meeting at 4 pm
[1:16:09] the Durban girls Secondary School amen
[1:16:12] for the first combined meeting of
[1:16:13] January 2023 and it will continue every
[1:16:17] last Sunday of the month amen so beyond
[1:16:20] expectation for that and go and support
[1:16:22] the meetings I'm sure you'll be blessed
[1:16:23] through the word of the Lord amen let's
[1:16:25] dismiss now and greet one another bless
[1:16:29] one another amen hallelujah and love one
[1:16:32] another
[1:16:32] amen if you've never heard me tell you
[1:16:35] this before I love you I appreciate you
[1:16:39] amen I appreciate every one of you
[1:16:41] appreciate from the young one to the old
[1:16:43] one I appreciate every chance I get to
[1:16:46] have a conversation with you amen these
[1:16:48] are just not conversations I take this
[1:16:50] as moments with you amen because each of
[1:16:53] us has moments in our lives that we
[1:16:55] share with one another a portion of your
[1:16:57] time that you may never get back
[1:17:00] I may never get to speak to you again
[1:17:01] you may never get to speak to me again
[1:17:03] so I value each conversation and that's
[1:17:06] the way we should be with one another so
[1:17:08] always be kind to one another always say
[1:17:10] a good positive word to encourage one
[1:17:12] another because we don't know when it'll
[1:17:14] be our last time to influence one
[1:17:16] another for the things of God so God
[1:17:18] bless you we love you appreciate you
[1:17:20] let's sing amen
[1:17:22] take the name of Jesus with you
[1:17:28] child of Sorrow
