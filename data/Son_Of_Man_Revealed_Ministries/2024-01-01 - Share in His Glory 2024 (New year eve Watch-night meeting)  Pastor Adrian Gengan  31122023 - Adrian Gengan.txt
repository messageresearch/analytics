Ronnie's church and I'm going startop stop referring it as Pastor Ronnie's church now and refer it to as as a brother Adrian's church amen Pastor Adrien amen certainly I can see that this church has moved forward amen can feel the presence of God every time I come into this house amen I feel the Holy Spirit moving amen you got something special Amen in this church amen and hope you can always accept that we are part and pel of this church amen I think the the the the song that sister Amanda sang he sent out to way he can be attributed to all the STS of this message amen where we grew up and and came into this church amen and and Pastor Ron used to preach this message Amen to us and some of us are here who who took this message and and some of us are not here but we're grateful that he sent the truth our away amen and all the other brothers that that were yeah amen they sent the truth away and and and brother Adrian is doing a fantastic job as the other ERS of this church amen and I'm so grateful that I can come and still Fellowship here and he the same message that was preached then being pred here amen with the Holy Ghost Revival amen amen I don't really have a testimony as in such what has God has done for me but I'll tell you that God has done everything for me amen amen I can tell you that uh God has held me close closer to him Never Let Me Go anything that I wanted God has provided amen amen anything that I needed healing on God has healed me amen so my biggest testimony is that God has gotten me closer to him amen amen but what I want to really say is that every time I come to this church I notice that there's a a new generation growing amen amen I feel like there's inadequate people here brothers and sisters to be the beion to be Pastor amen and I know once upon a time I was at the brother's age so I I just wanted to share something that that will will help our young brothers and sisters and I thought about it and I said be influenced by the word and not the world Amen amen amen because I know what it is to go to nightclubs on a New Year's Eve and I know what it is to go party with the world and not come to church amen and I think in this church here there's a mature young brothers and sisters that's going to take this Bon on that's going to move this church forward but what I encourage your brothers and sisters is not to be influenced by the world and I say this because it was my biggest struggle Amen brother son Sam Sons brother Joshua's Sons brother suban the young sisters there sisters don't go looking for worldly things if you want the worldly things world is going to pull you cuz what you find in this words he better than what is in the world Amen you might find that somebody is weaving Air Jordans and somebody is dressing up in this style and that's good for you we don't have any competition out there God has given us everything you know what I'm saying don't go change your way of eating now they cooking sheep at home you say no mommy how want Sushi because your friends are enjoying it that's not the way you know while growing up what we what I noticed growing in this message is that the message is consistent there's no you cannot increase it or decrease it the prophet's word what he told us the word from God is consistent told us how to dress how to act and the most humble people around the world world is the people from this message so if you think you want to be with the world and you the best person you're not amen amen but I can tell you stay with your pastor you know we can go shopping but we can't go shopping for the word of God shopping for clothes yes shopping for cars you can't go shopping for the word of God the word of God is the Revelation it's in your heart and I can tell you that if you the word of God Is Right preach from this purp which it is cu brother adan's got a special gift he's taken that token and he's r with it what's that famous Sprinter guy he's even faster than that Sprinter amen so stay with your pastor you all been great stay with your pastor a he's a great man of God your church is in good hands amen and young brothers and sisters you know if you need any help anything we need to we need to share and help but don't be influenced by the world be influenced by the word amen God bless amen we have our sister Angelia it's going to bless the Lord in song I

to thank the Lord for all that he's done for me and my family past year and I can share the same uh sentiments with brother Marvin and brother rames that everything we've ever asked the Lord for in this year he's given it to us amen he's been our healer our protector he's been our Jehovah chra even when we didn't ask for it he's done wonderful things for us am and um today um I think you all know my testimony how the Lord had so good to jayen and I um when we had an accident in March and I just want to thank him for healing me I stand here today I don't even feel like I've had an accident and my body is totally healed and amen jings well and you know it's only the grace of God um people go people have accidents and it takes them a long time to recover but we are we are well and I believe that's only the grace of God Upon Us amen today I'm going to be sharing um testimony with you it's actually not my testimony it's Janice's testimony and uh I just want to thank the Lord on her behalf and and she's trying to come forward but uh I'm just going to share for you um with you how uh the Lord uh has been with her and made a way for her so um Janise studied um through dut and when it was time for her to graduate she couldn't complete her 6 months internship because it was Co and the companies that she could have got an internship with were not taking people in because people were working from home and things like that and the time went and she couldn't get an internship and during that time my dad was very ill and um he was at home bu recovering from his operation and things like that and jice was the only one who could do certain things for my dad so when he he had difficulty breathing she would go and cup his chest and help him um you know alleviate the pressure on his lung and things like that and as the months went and she would also help in the shop and things like that months went by an entire year went by J didn't get an internship and she would always say mom you know am I ever going to graduate because without this internship I'll never be able to graduate I'll never get a I'll never get myself certificate so that I can apply for jobs and I would always tell her and we' always talk about it and say look we think that the reason there's this delay is because you need to be at home you have a purpose to fulfill and when the time is right God will provide you with your hearts desire and as the time went and I could see the the discouragement in jise the the frustration and I kept telling her you know there's a reason for everything and God has a plan for you you just have to believe you just have to be positive and everything's going to be fine um at some point I took her for an interview with uh one of the shipping companies and she came out of there and said Mom those people were so horrible and you know I I I can't work there I can't go there hope they don't even call me back and I said look if it's meant for you and if it's God's plan for you it's going to happen so we carried on and then out of the blue last year a company called her for an interview and I was so skeptical because I never heard of the the ca or this uh institution so I did some research and I said okay it looks it is a legitimate institution let's go we went for the interview she got the internship and it was always my desire that jise gets placed at a very reputable company when she has a internship because it makes more sense and it so happened that she got a very reputable company and she completed her six months internship and when she completed a six month months internship they offered her a further oneyear learnership and um she eventually graduated and she not only graduated I think many of you saw her she graduated in celebration she was interviewed by the media her picture was all over the newspapers and you know um it's not something that we expected she graduated with Kumi she had many distinctions amen um her passing with that also resulted in us getting um the discount we had most of our fees paid back to us and uh you know Hallelujah all these delays brought uh so much of the things to us and then during her her learnership you know uh she just an article and she decided to apply for a position she went for the interview she came back home and said Mom I was so nervous and I don't even know what I was saying and I'm never getting this job and I said to her look whatever it is whether you're nervous or you did bad if it's God's plan you will get the job and she has got the job in fact she had to terminate her learnership with with the other company in order to get a job and we give God all the praise and honor and I also thank God for her because every day when I pick her up and when she talks about her experiences um she always tells me you know Mom God is so good to me I don't know why God is so good to me and I always tell her that just appreciate it and give glory to godah you know uh we are just so blessed and we just thank God for everything he's done for us amen and um yeah we are truly grateful thank you amen amen we call S CN forward amen I greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen finally that I would come after uh sister elain who had a hectic accident we were also in my kids and I I didn't want to share this but I thought no the angel of the Lord was definitely with us this day and uh funny enough Zion normally sits on the passenger behind the passenger seat but this particular day he decided no he wants to sit almost on utm's lap and utum saying mommy Zion is pushing me against the car please like let him move so I'm like Zion please move but Zion is refusing to move and as we so I said just leave him man he wants to sit there so as we left I see this car parked like few meters away from the robot he's not moving so as we I'm coming there's two lanes for us and two lanes for the oncoming traffic so as I pass him he decides now he needs to move so what told me was the car just li like went forward and I thought this guy didn't put in his clutch he just started his car and the car Jed like forward and then he didn't wait for me to like pass him and he into my uh you know the bachel cap is and it happened in slow motion because first we hear the the knock then the car like sways this way and I'm saying Autumn that that's our car because now we we this way now so then I moved and I stopped and I'm thinking Lord please I don't want to be in the situation right now I have things to do I need to be somewhere anyway so I got out and this drunk man black man gets out of his car I'm so sorry and his hands are out and he wants to hug and I don't know what he wants to do I said sir please this is not the time to hug or do stuff now you bumped my car so he says oh but I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I said just hold on I need to check the damage on my car before we converse and so I checked the damage and funny enough the bump was so loud but nothing no dent on my car no scratches nothing the kids are okay I'm fine so I walk back and I look at his car his light is hanging the bumper is funny I'm have to deal with your mess now so then I get I took his uh numbers and everything I said no uh I'll phone you he said yeah but I'm sorry I'm S I said yeah it's fine but I'll phone you and I thought no you just deal with your mess my Carie is fine my kids are fine I'm fine we're leaving now so I said goodbye and then um that's how it ended I found uh a said I was in an accident he's like are you okay he was like really stressed but I believe the angel of the Lord was with us that particular day because there was oncoming traffic and they could have bumped into me when I was you know swayed that way but I thank God that we were we Sav oh thank you [Applause] [Music] Lord [Music] at times thead is heavy at times the road is long when circumstances come your way you feel you can't go on when you're feeling at your weakest Jesus will be strong he'll provide the answers when you feel all hope is gone he'll find way for I know that if he can paint put the stars in know that he can raise

storm away and he can conquer [Music] forever to open Heaven Gates I know for you he see you through he find the way [Music] find amen amen we call our sister AUM brother William going to read scripture for us I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ um just want to read a scripture 2 Corinthians 57 therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation the old has passed away behold the new has come Isaiah 43:18 to19 remember not the former things nor consider the things of old behold I am doing new things amen amen hello I'm going to read a scripture for I know the plant I have for your declares the Lord plans of supp um you and not harm and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future hallah amen amen amen I'll be grateful amen that the Lord knows the plans that he has for us amen amen so I like just to bless the Lord give him thanks for another year that he seen us through amen I want you to sing a song but we running out of time and I thought it would be more important just to share a few testimonies um just to encourage you and uplift your faith amen so you all know the testimony that I shared uh earlier on this year um when Judah was born how that before uh he was born that the doctors told us that whil in the home he is having problems growing and we brought the need before the church at that point um was 2 days before Judah was born that um he was only about 2.1 uh CES at that time and after we prayed the church and we trusted to God in the space of one day he grew from 2.1 to 2.7 kgs in the space of one day something that he was struggling to do for weeks but after prayer and believing God in the space of one day he grew and I shared with you how you know in the beginning of the year when Pastor Adrian spoke about the year 23 and how uh Mark 11:23 is our scripture and now Judah which is praise is tied in with that and it just Co not coincidentally but by the Lord orchestrating it Judo was born at around 1123 he's the 23rd grandchild U great grandchild my granny and if you take the number he has 2.73 kgs that adds up to amen I can't remember the exact K is now but it added up exactly to 11 because he has born in the 11th Hour amen so I just like to thank the Lord once again for that but more importantly whilst we were there in and and Judah was born the nurse came in and the nurse was a bit um you know upset saying that you know she's not happy with the condition of the baby seems like he's struggling to breathe and she went into to try and get the pediatrition urgently and at that point when she walked out I turned to uh Sister Kim and I said you know don't stress I'm just going to pray and I went over the baby and instead of praying um if I can remember the correct words now I said Judah you're the son of the most high God now let your lungs breathe amen and I didn't realize that the nurse was walking in just behind me like a second after I said those words and she just came in and said you know everything just seems fine now I don't know what happened everything is just perfectly fine and now as I said he was starting with 11:23 but here's the manifestation now 11:23 when we speak the word amen and uh you know I was thinking about something uh quite funny uh at work we have something called book meetings which means work in progress where the boss wants to sit with you and go through all the masses that he gave you and and see how far ahead the matters have gone and whenever they have those kind of meetings I I I hesitate and I don't like it when they have those meetings because I like to do my work in my own time I don't like to be told when my work must be done and all of those things so whenever they announce that they're having those meetings I just cancel those meetings when I say I cancel it I mean I speak the word and I say that this meeting is not going to happen and they don't know how but somehow those meetings always get a Jour whenever I speak the word and I say I don't want to have this meeting now it's it's been happening for quite a few times and I just laugh about it every time because we can control circumstances around us we don't realize how powerful that is Sir because we only want to apply now the things of God to spiritual things but you see God put Adam on the earth not to just apply amen things to his spiritual life but Adam was to be a God on a physical Natural Earth see Adam want to exercise his authority on a physical Natural Earth come on you see so when God gives us these things it's not to be all also spiritual but it's to exercise in our daily lives it's like imagine your father gives you a credit card now and that credit card has a million ran on it and we just sitting with that credit card just deciding no we'll maybe use it once a year maybe sometimes not even use it in the whole the whole entire year but that's what our heavenly father has given us because didn't the prophet say we have a blank check yes sir but now how many times have we used that check this year how many times has the bank of heaven received that check this year from you amen how many times have you received from the Heavenly store room because I can tell you that it's more plentiful than the sto rooms of Egypt amen I can tell you that it's not going to run out because our heavenly father is the inexhaustible Fountain amen we're never going to dry amen his resources out amen so for 2024 I believe 2023 was just a training ground for us I believe all the great Supernatural things that we've started to see is only still in its infancy I believe we're going to see much greater things than that because amen we've read the quotes Missy limbs are going to appear amen the prophet said would we leap over walls amen the things that God has ordained for us to do amen it's for us to do amen because amen there's no denomination church that's going to do it there's no denomination that's going to fulfill the remaining scriptures amen it's only the bride of Christ amen so for it's us to equip ourselves amen how by coming to church by coming to the training camp getting the right training amen building up our faith amen because Satan is out there every day of the week whether it's at work whether it's at school to try and influence us so when we miss a service amen we are missing amen a serious amount of time of training amen because you're not missing anything out in the world when when the enemy is their influencing you you're not missing out on that because you're going to work you're going to school but when you miss out on Church you're missing out Amen on that building up your faith you're missing out on that training amen and more than that amen church is only Sundays and on Wednesday day but more than that we got to equip ourselves during the week amen even if it's during the work meditate upon the Lord amen like David said Thy word have i hidden in my heart that I may not sin against thee amen Jesus told the disciples amen pray that you that you don't fall into temptation amen so these things are Keys amen for us to exercise in the kingdom of God Amen so be grateful amen we thank the Lord for this year he's revealed so much to us amen more than you know we thought all the seals were open we thought we have the open book that there's nothing more that the Lord can reveal to us but he can take the same word that we've been hearing all these years and make it fresh to us amen hallelujah I also like to thank the Lord for amen his hands upon my life when it comes to um Ministry in the word I can say that the Lord has um taken me um through this year in this year greater and greater into his word understanding his word more and more and I like to thank the the Lord for that because it's only the Lord you know sometimes um when Pastor agent asks me to uh Minister you know I don't ever get a message just like that it's usually in the last day or maybe sometimes the day that the Lord say to now drop inspiration and that's when you know that the Lord is leading you because you're not just trying to take something from your own intellect or something that you've learned but you're relying upon the Lord so I like to thank the Lord for that because we know that the Lord has entrusted people to minister unto his bride yes sir he's ordained man to preach the gospel amen amen and we got to respect the various officers we respect our pastor we respect the various officers in the church because that's the way God moves through amen amen amen so I pray you have also been blessed this year I pray you've also been catching on the revelation of how God is moving in the hour and you that you've not been remaining stagnant but that you are pressing forward because if God has chosen to reveal these things to us it it gives us great responsibility amen amen hallelujah I'd like to call our brother Joshua at this time amen just to say a few words before we hand over to our pastor Adrian amen I greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen you feel the sweet presence of the Holy Spirit tonight amen so just to recap a few things of the Year 2023 want to start reading a scripture book of 2 Chronicles chapter 7 reading from chapter 7 reading from verse one it says now when Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord fill the house amen somebody says the Lord fill the house amen say I am the house that the Lord fill somebody say I am the house that the Lord has filled in the year 2023 amen amen and the priest could not enter into the house of the Lord because of the glory of the Lord and filled the Lord's House amen somebody say I am the Lord's House Lord amen and when all the children of Israel saw out the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house they bow themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worship and praise the Lord saying for his good his mercy endureth forever how many of you can say his Mercy endured forever the Lord has been good to me how many of you can say the Lord has been good to my family am the Lord has been good to me in all circumstances and his Mercy endure it forever verse four says then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord that's what we come to do this year amen we've come to DED rededicate Our Lives amen we've come because there was a temple of God there was a time for the food the spiritual food that the prophet has been preaching was Tau up for the special season that people the different Stone from around the world will be heed down brought together to form this mystical Body of Christ and we are the temple of God Amen but we can say surely in this year 2023 we had a visitation from the angel of the Lord amen the Bible said the prophet of God come so our faith can be turned back to the faith of the fathers and what happened in the book of of facts they to wait and car in Jerusalem until they were enjoyed with power from on high what is power it's the Holy Ghost amen we don't have our own power amen it's the Holy Ghost in US amen amen it's the power of God that does the miracle it's the power of God that brings Deliverance it's the power of God that brings the anointing that breaks the Yoke of bondage that is why in this year 2023 you'll find in many families in all our home we found that people that were in bondage those things those Yoles were broken amen because why the anointing has come down and it's the angel of God that brought forth the anointing amen and how he's bringing forth the anointing through the five-fold ministry amen bringing the same word amen and now it's shedding light on the same word we've had this word all these years but now the Holy Ghost comes down bringing the Dynamics amen amen verse 5 says and King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 sheep so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God and the priests waited on their offices the levite also instruments of music of the Lord which David the king had made to praise the Lord because his Mercy endured forever and that's what we've been doing amen giving praise to our God Amen when David praised by the ministry and the priest sounded trumpets before them and all Israel stood moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because of bra of the Brazen because the Brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat offerings and the fat also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days and all Israel with him a very great congre congregation from the entering in of ID unto the river Egypt and in the eth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast 7 days and on the three and 20th day amen yes listen to the scripture now and on the three and 20th day that's the 23rd day of the seventh month amen he sent the people away into the tents glad and merry not for the goodness that the Lord had showed unto David and to Solomon and to Israel is people amen amen so in this year 2023 the Lord has been good to us am amen was a rededication of our life bringing us back to the altar coming back to consecration again and when the life was consecrated again what happened the Shak of Glory comes down upon who upon us the temple of God Amen we are the temple of God because why Jesus Christ must dwell in us and the world now must see the resurrected Jesus Christ to us so if anybody ask you where is Jesus is Jesus in me the hope of glory amen because that is why we come to die to self so it's not I that live it it is Christ that deled in us so as we recap this year the Lord has been good to us we identified that it is the Angel of the Lord that been with us in many circumstances we have identified to the grace of God the digital Footprints of the Angel of the Lord that you was tied to the number 23 amen and you seen supernaturally in many circumstances in every home in the church is brought forth healing amen this is all under the third pool now because the has come down you may ask how is discernment here through the preaching of the word you know that your need was spoken through you know that through the preaching of the word the Lord has been Discerning your your needs he's been speaking to each one of you in every circumstances in every area of your life from the small to the middle age the to the whole to everybody yes amen but the greatest Miracles that he done this year he's been restoring the Holy Ghost back into families back into individual Liv lives Amen in our person in our family Josephine had a personal experience from the Lord we had our brother Noah had a personal experience from the Lord am amen we've had Miracles we have people speaking the word yes and things were coming to pass amen we saw God clearing Debs amen we saw sicknesses all types of sicknesses God has seen them through people have been getting jobs we seen God in every area of Our Lives amen but what is he been doing is preparing us because why we are the temple where the glory of the Lord has come now to dwell in and we are the people that he wants to use now to go and possess the gates of the enemy amen for we are the people that he says Thou must prophesy again before Nation tongues and King we are the people who will have to represent Jesus Christ to this dying generation to this world without hope to this world that's in darkness to the world that is that is in chaos right now they need to see the Living God the resurrected Jesus amen and he's going to work in and through his body amen and the Lord has been good to us and surely we can say his mercy and J forever amen prophet of God I just want to read a quote it says Solomon was a four type of Christ in that he buil the Temple and so forth and then in that age God gave Solomon a gift and all of Israel recognized that gift and all Israel prospered under the reign of that gift but if they had not have believed that gift that God sent through Solomon then they would not have prospered they wouldn't have recognized it and they when God sent this great marvelous gift all Israel flourish amen and you find that when God has sent his gift which is the Holy Ghost amen come our way everybody flourishes under that amen and they became the mighty nation of the Earth because they recognize the gift of God that was in Solomon so what was in Solomon it was the gift of God which is the Holy Ghost everyone with one art and one Accord was testifying of this great gift not of the great Solomon the great gift in Solomon amen it's not the holy people it's the holy spirit in the people not the holy church but the holy God of the church amen as Peter referred the Holy Mountain it was not the holy mount it was the holy God that was on the mountain and Solomon was just a man that God had for you and give him a great wonderful gift and when Israel saw that it was it truly was the gift of God every one of them red to him that was made the Revival and we know the prophet preacher message is greater than Solomon is yet amen and how many of you can say in this day it happened in the prophet's time how many if you can say right now a greater than Solomon is here he's here amongst us amen the same angel of God that was with the prophet is here amongst us doing the great Great and Mighty Works amen because why this bride must do the Greater Works before we we about to leave the earth now yes one of these days we're going to leave here but before we leave on the earth there must be an impact and that's what all is is preparing was for these things that we are seeing here are only there's still more to come amen because why before we leave we must impact the Earth it must whatever we whatever is going to happen is going to impact the Earth in such a way that it will reach Israel because when Moses and Elijah com down the news must go out that there was a people on the Earth Hallelujah God was with them amen God works through them amen and they have left the earth a supernatural people they was a super race an invincible Army that's the message that will end up in Israel amen I pray that God going to 20 2024 I pray the Lord richly bless every one of you from my family to yours I pray the Lord bless every one of you in your homes I pray that as the Lord has been restoring families together he's been restoring the family altar you know a supernatural things can take place in a family altar yes I receive my healing in the family altar amen something that might seem so simple is just a family altar but on on this one specific night while having the family Altar and and the prayer was finished and the wife looked at me and she start and she walked towards me and I recognized that this was not a normal look that she gave me and I discerned that this was the angel of God present amen and when she came I just raised my hand because I knew what was going to happen and she prayed for me and I asked her what made you do that she couldn't understand herself what made her come towards me it was the angel of the Lord so every s situation in this church as well when I when I've listened to the people's testimony I've recognized that it was the angel of the Lord that was doing these things amen it's a coincidental brother mvin was burdened for the young people in our family altar we mentioned brother mvin I was I was mentioning to the children about brother mvin as an example of how God supernaturally intervened in his life and transformed his life taken him out of the world and brought him to this marvelous message that how it couldn't be him that would receive this message had it not been for the grace of God Amen he had to be predestinated so God does Supernatural things but the greatest thing that he can do when he can take a person and transform his life by his transforming power I was actually telling speaking to the boys about you brother M telling them how giving them an example of your life and I was just sharing with them this last night and coincidentally the Lord has been burdening your heart to speak to young people so God knows how to put things together amen nothing is done by coincidence we thank God for his grace we thank God for the year 2023 just one quick testimony how we I know we always spoke about how the Lord we identifi these digital prints how he works with the number 23 so during the course of this year I was at the shooting range and you normally shoot on a total of 25 so we did a warm up shooting and before the the shooting I prayed Lord I said show me that you are here and then you can help me get through the shooting you know you got all the young people now and you now come off age now you don't want to embarrass yourself one of the young people so cuz you know in our young days we knew how to shoot so anyway and I just said a simple prayer like that so we did the warm-up shoot and we challeng the scores and you know what my score was on the board there was 23 out of 25 I said Thank You Lord now I know that you're here when it came to the final shoot I got total amen but it wasn't me I knew that he was there hallelujah amen so I'm just showing you the simple things one night we were after the Wednesday meeting I was uh we went to buy a something to eat and brother Adrian sent me his b uh his reed when he went and bought something to eat and it was number 23 he tied up I said no the was a brother aen he must be with me then I it so happened at night uh the wife went to buy something and they went to buy a again and they put the two receipts together you know what he comes up to a perfect 23 so this is how the Lord Works amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so if the anointing is here if you catch if you recognize the gift in the church that God is God has placed here if you recognize the gift then you will receive the same place yes amen so God richly bless every one of you as we entering the new year as we took the time this year to reconsecrate our life to dedicate our life we've seen the supernatural because of that amen amen he said if you humble yourself my people could humble themselves and call upon my name amen and repent of all his sins surely he will come and heal the land amen and we've seen the hand of God upon every one of us if we continue to do these things amen work out your own salvation with fear and trembling because it's there's coming a time of economic crisis it happened in the ministry of Elisha Elisha had the double portion but and he lived in the time when there was economic crisis there's coming a time let me tell you something now all the training ground that you've been through is only preparing you for what's coming on the earth amen because it's coming a time when you're not going to cry you're going to recognize the authority within you you're going to recognize your sunship you're going to recognize that you got dominion and the power of God is in you you and you're going to speak the word you're not going to cry you're going to speak with confidence amen amen because why when the when you have the faith of God which is walking in perfect Faith by you recognizing who you are and what the scripture says about you you're going to speak to your circumstances you want to speak and God and the things are going to come to pass from what you speak God will honor the things that you speak because why you are a son and daughter of God so when you hear about the economic crisis coming on the earth when you hear about all the squeeze coming about don't be dismayed Be not Afraid amen know that the angel of God is before you yes amen amen even right now Israel fighting the battles they're trying to fight their battles it's not them that will fight the battle eventually they will realize that all the world will turn against Israel the Army the military will not help them the military will not be able to fight the whole world God himself will have to come and fight just like that God is fighting our battles he said the battle is his and the Victory Is Ours it's the angel of God going before us every time Israel went they put the hark of the Covenant before them yes amen but every time the the hark was not there they were defeated but when the hark was before them they won amen so we pray that the Lord will be with each of you the Lord bless you and the Lord keep you amen [Applause] amen amen let's all stand together even as we get ready to hear the word of [Music] God the angel of the Lord is here the angel of the Lord is here feeling in the atmosphere the angel of the Lord is here the angel of

I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen I I tell you I was enjoying those testimonies and it's a pretty time is going I know many of more of you would have liked to come amen hallelujah but we'll continue maybe in the next service or if you continue to share your testimonies and don't forget the life of God came in 2023 Zoe Rose you don't know who that is that's Caleb's daughter amen we ended the year December with Zoe amen hallelujah and these things are not coincidental amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we'll uh go into our scripture amen and if you had seen my inspiration was share in his glory amen I put out the church notice for the New Year's Eve service amen I don't know about you but I hope you understand that I don't just get inspiration from counting sheep at night amen amen amen there's a waiting on the Lord yes right there's a waiting to hear what he would say to us amen amen I was telling brother Caleb earlier if we were talking about continuity if you go look how we ended December 2022 we spoke on the wings of a mighty angel amen and then 2023 would come and reveal himself in a greater way why we created the expectation so we are saying share in his glory in 2024 amen yes amen now that's not just given to anybody amen hallelujah amen we greet our sister amen here with sister Vanessa is that your relative's brother's mother amen welcome sister let's give a amen praise the Lord amen pray you be blessed in the presence of the Lord we know you could have been many places celebrating this time of the year but we thank you for coming into the house of the Lord to worship Him amen I pray you'll be blessed amen Romans 8:1 17 reads now if we are children then we are HS yes amen and that should finish it for us imagine if you heir of God Almighty the creator of Heaven and the Earth the one who owns it all you mean you're an air yes amen now if we are children then we are AES HS of God and coair with Christ if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory amen amen amen hallelujah now you would know that Romans 8 is the chapter when it when it goes all the way to verse 23 talking about Creations grown but it starts out here identifying who we are as sons and daughter of God that as Sons and Daughters if we are HS we can make a claim that's right amen so you see the inspiration is not fetch but it's in the word if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory you can't say about scripture that's scriptural amen 2 Corinthians 3:7 amen hallelujah I had to eliminate one verse one CH one chapter I was going to read Because brother Joshua took my chapter you were stepping into the anointing there amen hallelujah 2 Corinthians 3:7 says now if the ministry of death which was engraved in letters of stone came with such Glory that the Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its fleeting Glory will not the ministry of the spirit be even more glorious amen amen amen amen for if the ministry of condemnation was glorious how much more glorious is the ministry of righteousness amen indeed what was once glorious as no glory now in comparison to the glory that surpasses it for if what was fading away came with Glory how much greater is the glory of that which endures therefore since we have such a hope we are very bold we are not like Moses who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of what was fading away amen you may be seated praise the [Music] Lord amen you know this year we have many highlights that we can talk about amen but I was trying to summarize for you early in the morning service and tell you if there's anything you remember about 23 it's how the angel came to us yes amen amen amen it's very notable Hallelujah and you would note yeah why I'm saying this is because a prophet is without honor right you know the scripture and if you hear Brother mvin sentiments he's somebody who's not part of every week's service so he would pick up on things that you wouldn't pick up amen but if you really understood what he was saying he was telling you the movie is on my Lord mov on Amen praise the Lord so we appreciate you brother Marvin you're welcome to spend every year here with us no problem amen hallelujah you know Sister Amanda was telling me how she spoke for briani and when she arrived on Sunday last week briani was provided amen so brother mvin you got any needs just tell sister Amanda to speak amen praise the Lord you know we have great woman of faith I said we got great woman of faith in the church God has risen great woman of Faith amen and one of the highlights for me this year was we were doing some Outreach and out of that Outreach came sister Michelle and her family back to church let's give the Lord a great hand of Praise amen and I'm asking you amen hallelujah to raise an altar I'll teach you about raising an altar amen at another C but we've got to raise an altar amen for the total Deliverance of brother Denver and I'm putting it out before the church because if you got nothing else to pray for you pray for him yes amen that he'll receive total Deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah you believe you have the power of the spoken word amen then death and life lies in your power of your tongue amen yes Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord now Isaiah 60 says arise Shine for thy light has come amen amen that light is talking about the glory of God that light is talking about the shakina of God amen amen it's not just any light it's the seven sea light oh yes amen hallelujah amen amen we've had many other words for many other ages but at the sounding of the seventh Angel's message down comes the revelation of the Seven Seals and it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers and by God's grace it has turned our hearts back yes amen yes that's right amen I'm not talking about it in the future tense my heart has already been turned back amen for behold Darkness covers the earth you can't tell me that you look in the earth and you can't see Darkness cover the Earth nakedness filthiness amen man gone insane you must have seen this documentary they don't can't Define a woman documentaries what is a woman people are afraid to say what is a woman people are afraid to say that marriage ought to exist between a man man and a woman amen that God created Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve amen now they've gone Eve and weave they gone insane what is it another Sodom and Gomorrah Luke 17 amen as it was so shall it be you see the reason why Sodom is in the condition it is now prophecy must be fulfilled they must have come the Angels again investigating angels and you know that's what the prophet says when those angels came down that was a judgment sign yeah because he was wigged and he was trying to figure out why why was he wigged but then he says that was the judge of all the Earth yes and and he says the Angels themselves was his wig so judgment has come down on the earth in fact judgment has been pronounced on the earth because you remember when the seventh angel messenger took off The Rock and you threw it in the air you go read the seventh angel when he's pouring out his VI he takes something and he pours it out in the air and brother Brandon very significantly while he's there he picks up a rock and he throws it in the air and a wallwind comes down cuts through the Rocks pyramid shaped rocks and they asked him he says judgment about to strike that's right and he says about a few days later that Good Friday Alaska almost sunk yes amen and he says that great earthquake he said it won't stop it will continue amen so we at the closing scenes of the Gentile dispensation amen hallelujah we are moving ahead but you know what if I told you the Lord was coming in 2024 I guarantee you half of the church wouldn't even be interested you ask me what date and you ask me okay what do you know the time because you'd want to make last minute preparations but the Lord told us that no man know the time no man know the hour because we are to be ready at all times amen hallelujah for Darkness covers the earth thick darkness is over the people but the Lord will arise upon you and His glory will appear over you am now here brother brandom is talking in the message of paradox pre 1965 and watch are significant now he's a prophet and God speak to him through the word when I picked this up I was rejoicing he says when I opened the Bible so the prophet got a new Bible and he opened up the Bible and he says in the Bible there were two ribbons and he opened the first ribbon in the Bible was a very strange thing where it was was when Solomon dedicated the temple of God and the glory of God was so great that she kind of Glory in the building till the priest couldn't even Minister amen that's 2 Chronicles chapter 7 now that's one marker talking about the Shak of Glory coming down and the next string was laying where Ezra returned and dedicated the temple uh you got you got to know the hien mystery here on the 14th of March I didn't write the the prophet is putting this up here right brother Jeff I can't make this up this is the prophet preaching okay some of you will catch on the 14th of March what really happened on the 14th of March there was a order given of the Prophet says to go rebuild the walls of Jerusalem amen you remember am the prophet gives a date to it it says on the 14th of March the decree was given and all I'm going to say somebody was elected Pastor on the 14th of March and the third little marker that my wife had gotten me and put in the Bible not knowing with my name on it and so forth was laying to Mark 11:23 amen now how perfect can that be she just stuck it in the Bible and then that's what it was if you say to this mountain be moved and all of you know when that scripture was in my mind you tell people that's when those squirrels came right in that's exactly now come on give God praise if you call what we can identify with all three of those markers amen and I tell you the angel put it there for a certain time in a season amen praise the Lord now St John 14:20 says at that day you shall know that I this is now Jesus talking I'm in the father and and you in me and I in you amen right are you following that thought now Jesus was in the Father the father was in him and now he says I in you amen what am I trying to tell you the Shak of Glory is no longer just falling from the sky coming down the Shak glory is in you that's right amen amen you carry the presence of God yes that's right now this is my main quote for the evening and I want you to really get it he says God had so much control of them now this them he's talking about the prophets of old God had so much control of them till he was their voice their Action Now how many of you know the Bible says we are the temple of God we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost I want you to know the same Glory that came down that your kind of Glory is the Holy Ghost yes that's right now if we are temples Tabernacles of the Holy Ghost oh yes amen watch what he says now so I'm asking if we are Tabernacles of the Holy Ghost what are you doing with the holy spirit's hands what are you doing with the holy spirit's feet what are you watching with the holy spirit's eyes amen amen love the quote now I'm not going to say anything here cuz you think I'm into numbers here but I see it's paragraph 124 it says give me a church that's so completely Anointed with god Till They every action and move is thus say the Lord amen thank you Lord how many of you want to be that church amen yes he says now this is a quote I'm giving you as part of the inspiration give me a church that's so completely Anointed with god Till the every action and move is thus say the Lord walk in that Shak of Glory amen I'll show you a messiah anointed one of God standing upon the earth oh yes you mean I can become the Messiah yes amen Messiah means anointed one amen you are called to be the anointed one for this day amen but but I thought the message taught us that everything lay in brother brandham then you've been taught amen you come short oh yes that's right you come short yes he came to a group of people and bring them to glorification amen his message will bring you to glorification you stay with the message of the hour this message is designed to bring you to glorification amen some of you don't know what I'm talking about I got to detail it to you we are not in our aut to be condition oh yes man was made in the image and likeness of God Amen but man fell from his position man was a god of the earth God was God of the heavens and he said I'll make man and he shall be he shall have dominion and authority over the Earth amen not only shall he have dominion and authority over the Earth he shall operate in Ministry of multiplication yes yes one of the things opened up to us this year was multiplication how it operates in the kingdom of God because Luke 6:38 says give and it shall come back to you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over amen yes sir anything we do it comes back in multiplication amen hallelujah you go read there about Elisha's Ministry how he was the first one even before Jesus to take bread and multiply it amen Jesus took two fish and Five Loaves and in a ministry as Adam restored back on the earth he multiplied it amen amen we told you that 20us 10 in the Kingdom of Earth is 10 but in the kingdom of God 20 when you give 10 you're giving to the poor you're giving to the needy you're giving amen hallelujah it comes back to you 100 fold in the kingdom of God it's multiplication 20 - 10 is 100 but don't go write that now in your math test okay so everybody remember this because it's a message called who do you say this is I asked you who do you say this is amenallah am you are the Messiah now this is strong for some people but we are in the bright coming of Christ amen okay let me detail this to you very quickly in the first coming there had to be a virgin who brought forth a physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen for his first coming but his first coming with with uh it entail many things about his life he had to show forth the fruits of Messiah but then the ultimate thing was that he had to sacrifice his life and this is what I was trying to tell you amen that Adam lost three things he lost eternal life he lost his fellowship with God and he lost dominion over the Earth before the fall Adam could speak to a mountain Adam could speak to a tree and it would move amen you know the prophet who dramatize it uh evil would say oh that sun is so hot amen and Adam would speak a tree to come and provide shade for Eve amen hallelujah he says Shah would come amen the lion would come there and he stroke the the head of the lion he had perfect control over animal life he had control over the fish of the sea he had control over animal life amen hallelujah thank you Lord but he lost that so he lost eternal life life he lost fellowship with God and he lost power that's dominion over the Earth yes am so when Jesus Christ comes to pay the price of redemption if those three things are not restored then Jesus work was partial you say you're making a strong statement yes otherwise what's the need for Jesus dying on the cross if man is not going to be fully restored back to his eeden Beauty amen hallelujah so what happens amen you know when Jesus died and he rose again you find in Revelation chapter 5 amen they are looking for a man because the title de to man's inheritance is laying with God Amen there's a book The Prophet says that's a title deed to man's inheritance it's with God but the book don't belong in heaven right amen come on now amen Dominion don't belong in heaven the Dominion belongs on the earth yes sir amen so they're looking for a man and there's a search made that says they look all through Heaven they can't find a man they look on Earth they can't find a man amen the Bible says they even look beneath the Earth telling you that they are looking for the ones that have gone on in this life they're looking in Paradise or maybe the sixth Dimension they're looking for a man a worthy man yeah amen but they can't find anyone but wasn't Jesus a man why couldn't they find him because it must type the Bible when the high priest goes in into the sanctuary nobody can go in after him they have to wait for him to come back out amen amen so for seven Church ages he had to make intercession in the sanctuary in the temple of God but at the end of that seventh age he is coming back out am and that's when John is now weeping and he's crying and he's saying because there's nobody found worthy and then one of the elders say John don't weep for the lion of the tribe of Judah have prevailed to take the book amen John turns Amen in anticipation to see who's this lion but when John a type of the Bride you know a line now is typing because remember the the only ones that will see him come as a line is the Israel people yeah John is the type of the Bride when he turns to look he sees the same lamb he says I saw it as it had been slain meaning the blood was still fresh amen there's still blood for you and I amen people may say amen hallelujah the blood is of the mercy seed I say you're a liar amen the blood still amen is available for you and I thank you Father I want you to know no matter how much you fall no matter how much you fail get back up immediately repent and get back into his presence you know what most people do they go back into the world and say oh no when I'm fine when I'm right with God then I'll come back no that's not what to do amen you have to come back immediately into the house of God repent immediately amen amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah in a moment of weakness you might make a mistake but repent immediately amen that's no excuse for you not to say okay uh you see maybe I'm not see Satan is playing with you amen hallelujah oh no things are not working out for me let me tell you the waiting period God has you in a waiting period and that waiting period is not to show that you're a failure the waiting period is to show God in his power if you can hold on and believe in patience God will come in on the scene amen hallelujah so that's your scripture who do you say this is God is going to show you to be a messiah on the earth so what happens Jesus now takes the book from the end of the Angel sorry the end from God and now he takes and you know then from Revelation chapter 6 he opened each seal he opens each seal showing a symbol but then it goes forth in the symbol but then there must be one on the earth remember I said the book don't belong in heaven so Revelation 10 shows you how the book is coming back to the Earth Amen in fact Jesus showed them beforehand what Authority lay in man they had forgotten what man was about when he spoke to the winds when he spoke to the Seas when he spoke to amen he spoke to the blind man he spoke to the man and they all got healed he spoke to the tree and the tree withered away then they said what manner of man is this Glory we don't know about such a man let me tell you something you can go to Every denominator school every Bible school every Seminary Nobody Knows the condition that Adam was in go look it up go see if they will tell you that Adam was a God man that Adam could speak have you ever read their writings like that only in the message of the hour you'll find that where the Prophet tells us that we bypass our theophany they don't know anything about theophanies so here Revelation 10 the mighty Angel comes back down and he's got an open book in his hand titled deed to man's inheritance you know what a title deed is it's coming back to you to tell you that you are the rightful owner of the earth and the mighty angel now we know that's 1963 he's coming to connect with a prophet messenger Amen to tell him I'm going to reveal the mysteries of God and these mysteries of God is going to give you such a faith that it's going to put you back in your condition come on yes sir but you see only a few are going to catch it and Mark 11:23 he's telling you how man must believe his own word yes amen the reason why things are not happening in your life you don't believe your own word you don't believe that you possess the power in your own mouth on Amen you when Joshua was speaking to the son you think he he went to go and pray somewhere no did Joshua go to pray or did he say Amen in a moment of need he spoke to the son yes yes come on he said Son stand still yes sir the title de comes back to a man on the Earth but if you find from verse 8 to 11 it's speaking to John John is the type of the Bride he's talking to you and telling you you can have the same Authority that Jesus had you can share in his glory if you take the book and eat the book you become the [Music] book and then you can speak again you see your prophecy is different from every other Prophecy in the Bible because your prophecy is now back in the image of God back in the image and likeness of God amen amen hallelujah amen so I'm telling you Jesus Christ when he died and he rose again he paid the price for your Redemption not only for you to be saved amen but for you to come back to your original condition and yet the part people don't like the way for you to come back to just into your sunship Authority there's only one way provided amen but it's a way people hate because it's called the Holy Ghost amen ah here you go again I thought I'll just get super duper power without the Holy Ghost you know this Holy Ghost he so demanding I can't do nothing I can't think my own thoughts I can't do my own things I can't look to the left I can't look to the right it convicts me of everything amen right makes me love everyone yes it makes me forgive everyone yes you know we're talking about multiplication you know when Jesus is teaching about forgiveness he's telling you to forgive in multiplication as well 70 * 7 that's how the kingdom operates everything in multiplication amen now yes title did coming back to a man and let me show you William brandom a man who could speak to Flying bees a man who could speak to the beast in the field A Raging Bull a man who could speak to a dead fish amen he could speak to the fish of the sea he could speak to a cyst he could speak to a storm amen what manner of man is this a God man a man back in the image and likeness of God Amen but that doesn't Elevate him to tell me hey that he is something that I must idolize no that's showing me that the first wave sheep has been waved amen and the first one has come to maturity and I can come to maturity yes the first wave sheath is only showing you that there's a harvest coming am amen hallelujah Exodus chapter 24 amen Exodus chapter 24 says when Moses went up to on the mountain the cloud covered it now if you know anything about any Exodus there's a cloud there's a cloud in the first Exodus there's a cloud that overshadowed them on Mount Transfiguration and there's a cloud that came down this day and we know what those cloud is the cloud is seven angels amen come on you you to give a better amen than that if you know the message of the hour amen anytime you see a cloud a mystery Cloud a supernatural Cloud know that it's formed by seven angels amen and the glory of the Lord settled on Mount Si for six days the cloud covered it and on the seventh day the Lord Called Moses from where in the cloud so who's in the cloud amen amen hallelujah the Angels himself was his wig who's in the cloud amen they were looking at it like this even now if you look at Life Magazine they look at it like this only one got secret Revelation from the Lord and said you're looking at it the wrong way you better to turn it to the right am and he said when I turned it to the right I saw that's our Lord up there yes and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a consuming fire on the Mountaintop in the eyes of the Israelites and Moses entered the cloud as he went up on the mountain and he remained on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights oh what sweet communion Jesus is a friend of mine amen you see how much do you want the glory anointing am if you want to share in his glory in 2024 how much are you desirous of his glory anointing yes Moses wanted to see his glory and God showed him his glory and it was performing what is the glory you say the revelation of the word the Deep hidden Mystery Secrets is the glory of the Lord in this day here what brother Bram is saying Moses wanted to see the glory and God showed him his glory and it was performing Miracles and Divine Healing amen is that right that must be God's glory talk about shakan Glory we ought to have it tonight I don't want a dead Church yes Amen Brother come look at this deep Revelation don't only show me the mechanics oh yes we had the Mechanics for too long I bummed into a pastor earlier on and we were sharing some things and he was telling me he was talking about the angel of God and I told him we were talking about the angel of God as well and he was you know I'm trying to be Nic here for so long people told us you know we've come up a long way this is my spiritual voice KN you didn't know brother we in the algebra how about I never seen your ABCs we so skilled in algebra because you know in algebra they got X and they got a equal x y and they got hey so even in algebra they got letters they tell you find X you don't know where X is hey you lost him now you're asking me to find the X they can't show you the ABCs the the high beand quotes but the gospel is both mechanics and Dynamics am so yeah I'm going to say it again Moses wanted to see his glory how many if you want to see his glory how many if you can say you've seen his glory god showed him his glory and it was performing Miracles and Divine Healing is that right that must be God's glory talk about Shak Glory we ought to have it tonight it says and brother we all Christendom is looking for the coming of the Lord and the of the church all that's got any knowledge of the word well if we can't have faith enough for Divine Healing how are we going to have a rapturing faith oh I believe there's a great calling coming forth I believe as David said he laid there and waited until you see he listened and waited after a while he heard a rushing wind go through the malberry leaves going around he know God was going before him oh brother I'm listening for the rushing of the leaves the noise in the malberry bushes God's going before the battle then let's rise and put on the full armor of God pull the sword go after it The Battle Belongs to us when we see the hand of God moving on through signs and wonders let's start following on that's why I say we can't go backwards you see why I say that song even we've seen the supernatural scene is past tense that's why I told him drop the end we see the supernatural in our day amen 1 John 3:2 says beloved now are we the sons of God and it do not appear what we shall be but we know when we shall see when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see as he is how is Jesus now in a glorified body so when we see him we shall be in a glorified body so what is it telling now are we the sons of God so being a child of God is not a future event we are children from the point we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ born again baptized into his kingdom filled with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah so we find here that his glory was so strong that the Angels min mining to him cover their faces you know the seraphim they cover their faces they got six wings two they cover their face to they cover their feet amen hallelujah when Isaiah remember Isaiah had a revelation of God's glory so the glory of the Lord that's why I say people don't want this word because the glory of the Lord will uncover all your weaknesses yes yeah that's right amen yes sir because when saw the glory of God he says oh woe is me I'm a man of unclean lips he started to remember all the things he was saying yes I dwell in the land of unclean people not only uncover your weakness uncover the land's weaknesses that's the glory of God I'm going to reiterate you carry the glory within you if you're filled with the Holy Ghost amen so now how can you go sit with unbelievers yes right yeah amen imagine the down down down praise the Lord there's brother Denver Give the Lord a good ank of praise that's the sh of Glory I'm talking about amen you wouldn't even know what we're talking about sister Michelle amen hallelujah but we are talking about you just now brother Denver but all good things praise the Lord good to see you amen imagine sitting in the pub and you're singing down down down it's coming down the glory of the Lord is coming down I'm so strong none of these things will tempt me what does Psalm one say blessed is a man put it up some one some people don't know the scripture they don't read their Bible amen nothing shall tempt me you think so you know the woman who was delivered from a life of sin the prophet says she walk past the dance all one day amen and she stayed to listen to that song he and she heard she was walking past she can hear Whitney Houston I Will Always Love You and she remembered herself in the arms of her lover and says before she know it she was back in the ball what does the prophet always teach us don't see how close you can get onto Satan's grounds see how far you can get away from it don't see how close to the ledge you can get see how far away you can get from it what he says blessed is the man not only is this man now this man is blessed he's the man that WTH not in the Council of the ungodly you see why we got Godly lawyers here now you don't have to go to ungodly counsel I can't go to these brothers they know my hidden mysteries rather they know because the Bible says why don't you let them judge the matter why are you going to the courts let them judge the matter amen walks not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stand it in the way of Sinners nor sit in the seat of the scornful because we all know in the barrooms they hey they not SC hey we know in the barroom they're calling on the name of Jesus too hey right but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate on a Sunday morning only on Sunday day and night on Sunday no no sorry I misread it it's Sunday and Wednesday night in his law that he meditate on Sunday and wednessday night you see you can be that super chur super race but it takes her life I can show you the way back to the glory and I know you are good students from what I can see happen this year you want and they thirsting after his presence as the dear Panther for the waters so my soul long after you sing with me you alone are my heart desire and I long to Worship You You See I can show you the way back to your Adam condition but it requires a lot of consecration Amen in fact there's no situation that can stand before you you can get out of every situation through the word the word is the ultimate and tonight we're going to break strongholds amen yes strongholds that exist in 2023 you can't take to 2024 I'm here to break strongholds I'm here to tear down Satan's kingdom yes Lord amen hallelujah you may have possess you in 2023 but in 2024 he's got to find a new body but don't be Happ it about it otherwise he's coming with seven of his [Music] friends if we break addiction it's got to leave amen hallelujah but you got to fill it with the Holy Ghost if we bind the strong man making war in the heavenlies tearing down principalities that exalts itself against the knowledge of God God's glory will reveal your true state to you we're talking about Isaiah there in the presence wrong motives and all manner of evil is exposed am you see as I in the temple saw the glory of God and it exposed his weakness that's why through the preaching of the word it comes to expose your weakness amen why because his strength is made perfect in our weakness when when the spirit of the Lord is convicting you it's not to pull you down is to pick you up yes sir that's God's love to you not to tear you down not don't never ever feel insulted if the word is coming in a way and Discerning your heart say that's the grace of God to me amen because through the foolishness of preaching the word that's what God has chosen for the Salvation of man now when the Bible says you are the Temple of the Holy Spirit it is saying that God's spirit lives in you it is saying much more than that God is saying that you you are the holy place that means that you need to take good care of yourself both spiritually physically and mentally amen amen you see when his glory is revealed to us and we stand in the midst of his glory we must recognize his glory I'm saying this again because the glory has already been Fallen amen when we stand in the midst of his glory we must recognize his glory yes sir amen and we must respond to the Glory by bearing fruit the seed within us must bear fruit or the life in our branches must show forth life amen if we don't respond to the glory of his presence like Aaron's Rod did when it laid in the Ark of the Covenant and the glory of the Lord was upon it that a dry dead Rod started to bear for armonds in the presence of the sh Glory there now I got to slow this down they had a rod somebody gave me flowers from the Holy Land who is this Josephine is your flowers amen praise the Lord must be here for a reason this look like fig trees too is a fig okay could be for a reason right cuz I'm talking about a fig tree now what they did was aon's Rod that was used you know they cast it down it turned into a serpent yes that was now almond Branch they cut it from an almond tree so they took this rod and they placed it in the Ark of the Covenant now this Rod was dead for many years dried up but when they placed it in the Ark of the Covenant in the presence of the sh of Glory that Rod started to Bear forth leaves and he started to Bud come on if you know these things say Amen am he started to Bud and bear armonds that's what the shanic glory of God will do now why I'm telling you that is to tell you this the sh same kind of Glory was in Jesus Christ amen and when he appeared before this fig tree the Fig Tree didn't respond like that Alon Branch oh yes yes it refused to recognize the sh of glor come on Amen yes come on that is why Jesus cursed it when you can't recognize his presence then you are cursed with a curse then we end up like the Fig Tree cursed wither to the root amen because here a tree that had life it failed to recognize the presence of God Almighty and refus to bring forth its fruit so the king of glory cursed the Fig Tree and and said no man eat of thee don't be like the Fig Tree and not recognize the presence recognize his glory and live and dwell in the glory the prophet says here and when you go to talking about being born again now this is what I'm talking about and this I found this evening when I was going home I was telling my wife I said you don't know what happened this morning service when I mentioned the Holy Ghost there was a wave come back unbelief rejection of that people can't surrender to the Holy Spirit and when I found this I said I must read it to the church in preparing now when I went home he says when you go to talking about being born again receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost nine times out of 10 them spirits will show their colors what they areen the rejection of the Holy Ghost yeah and that's what the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into the people's heart and they don't recognize what it is my brother carries a sh of glory amen my brother carries a sh of Glory my sister carries the sh of Glory why you think that Jesus said in that day you say one thing against them it's better than a millstone come on put around your neck and thrown into the sea right you're carrying the presence of God Amen they think it's a little church joining or something like that you see we think hey maybe we're in the message of the hour because of the Holiness standards no because of the dressing standards no because their woman don't wear makeup up no because they don't wear earrings no we're here because we are carrying the presence of God come on Amen the presence of God doesn't will not will make you conform to the Bible to the word of God and won't make you deviate from the word of God if you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost your battle is won amen amen amen amen he says but that is the god the Creator living in you and giving you some of the power you know brother I always wonder why I look at these men Ministry and I see hey the power of God is moving in there you don't see the price they pay yes you don't see the hours they spend in prayer yes you don't see the hours they spend in the word all you see is them come forth in the pulpit and maybe preach and then you're so critical of that you don't see the labor that goes on connecting with the anointing connecting with the angel of God what is he saying but this is for you now God living in you giving you all the powers he said but I've never seen any miraculous in my life you've not spoken that's right you've not believed your own word yes say well I'm going you know any any military army must test the Weaponry your weapon is your words next time you have a need speak and believe your word amen your word is based on the word of God you believe the word you quote the word you say Lord according to Mark 11:23 you said if I speak to this mountain and I tell it to be removed and I don't doubt in my heart I'm refusing to doubt I believe your word you said I shall have what I have said amen I'm laying it there and you watch if that word will not come to pass yes Lord thank you Lord but that is the god the Creator living in you giving you all the powers and you're in possession of anything that he had why you can't leave a mythical Jesus I love to read about his power and the glory that he had but he wants to share his glory with no man we know that Bible says that he will share but that is talking about another aspect now that is talking about man taking glory for himself he won't share that Glory of any man but his wife he will withhold nothing from you yesall right you see in the first coming he fully restored Adam through Jesus Christ he's the last Adam in the second coming he's fully restoring Eve that's you and me amen that's the nutshell of it Hallelujah got to read this quote and you're in possession of anything that he had so is it in you to abstain from Evil to do good to shun evil and flee to righteousness to turn away from Temptation you you say you say it's hard the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee no no no I got to pray to God that this devil is on my back now and he's making me do this no the Bible says you resist the devil and he will flee amen all malice hatred Strife envy and so forth turn away from it for that'll take him from your heart if you will receive him Embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him I can tell you the church together in that kind of a power as the power to bind the heavens heal the sick Open the Eyes of the blind Hallelujah the deaf speak the dumb speak and the deaf hear the cripples walk the blind see why it's recognizing the power of almighty God into your heart they is the deity amen I say we all United the body of Christ amen thank you Lord amen he says your dear brother sister if you have got the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning run into the kingdom of God as quick as you can the ceiling time is on the enemy has coming like a flood he's raising a standard against it the drama set the church is going home just as certain as anything you haven't got always to wait friend you haven't got all the time to wait you better come you better make it today that's right while today is today make it now amen amen yes than you Lord speak amen amen amen glory we don't know if 2024 is the year we move to glorification oh yes but we are moving another step towards glorification because the same spirit that did it for the groom must do it for the bridegroom the Bible says that the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you the same spirit that quickened his mortal body will also Quicken your body The Same Spirit that Rose Jesus from the dead into a glorified state is the same spirit that dwells in you and his final work must be to bring you to glorification you see why the Holy Ghost is important without the Holy Ghost you are not coming into glorification the same spirit that did it for the groom must do it for the bridegroom if the last Adam was changed from a mortal body to a glorified body so will the last Eve be changed amen my last scripture will be Psalm 24 Psalm 24 says the the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and all who dwell therein for he founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the waters we're talking about going to the glory now to the glory anointing watch now what he says who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord who shall go into his glory anointing who may stand in his holy Place watch now come back to consecration you can't get away from from it he who has Clean Hands and a pure heart that's the ones who will have a glory anointing who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear deceitfully yes now not only that he will receive blessing from the Lord and Vindication from God of his salvation such is the generation of those who seek Him who seek your face oh god of Jacob lift up your heads oh he Gates be lifted up oh

I don't want to say you might go give your iPhone away brother Kaleb amen praise the Lord but what am I telling you if you really want an object what would you do you would pay the price for it because you know the value Jesus knew the value that you have that's why he paid the price thank you Lord the Bible says for the glory that was set before him he endured the cross you were the glory that was set before him Jesus knew that in order to have dominion on the earth in this last day he would have had to have a people where he Spirit can dwell in their hearts I want you to Bow your
