[16:21] bring you low. May bring you low. but
[16:25] never bring me down. Oh, let's give
[16:28] praise now. Sit out.
[16:31] I know the master of the
[16:36] wind. Thank God. I know. I know the
[16:41] maker of the maker of the
[16:46] rain. He can't

[17:22] Lord. We've sung, Lord, from the purity
[17:24] of our hearts, oh God, to offer up to
[17:26] you a sweet smelling savor, oh God. And
[17:28] I pray, Lord, that you would come down
[17:30] and consume the sacrifice of praise. Be
[17:33] pleased with us, oh God, and come and
[17:35] speak to us through your precious word.
[17:37] We pray, Lord, for even those that are
[17:38] traveling right now, that you, Lord,
[17:40] bring them safely to the service, Lord.
[17:42] Those that are not here, Lord, that you
[17:44] will undertake for them, Lord Jesus.
[17:46] Lord, those that are sick and body, we
[17:48] pray, Lord, that your healing virtues
[17:49] will flow through their bodies and touch
[17:51] them and make them every withhold even
[17:53] as your word has declared that they are
[17:55] already healed in the name of Jesus. Oh
[17:57] God, we pray Lord that the angel of God
[18:00] will go forth and touch them and deliver
[18:01] them. I pray, we commit all things into

[18:28] you see God answering a prayer one time,
[18:30] he says every time we meet God on the
[18:32] same conditions, Amen. According to the
[18:35] same word, he's obligated to answer it
[18:37] every other time. Amen. Because he's an
[18:39] unchanging God. Amen. So this morning,

[20:09] redirect himself when I called him about
[20:12] a few minutes ago. He was still at
[20:13] macro. Amen. So he's probably be about
[20:15] another 10 15 minutes. So it gives us
[20:17] another opportunity to worship him.
[20:20] Amen. Give him praise. So I'm going to
[20:21] ask you maybe I'm going to take you off
[20:23] guard, but if you got a testimony, you

[22:56] Lord in
[22:57] song. Praise the Lord. I asked him to
[23:01] sing a song today. Amen. Called the
[23:02] message of a wounded dove. Now, while
[23:04] he's coming, I don't if you heard the
[23:06] prophet dramatized this.
[23:09] Amen. Third Exodus actually put it to
[23:11] some music as well and it's very
[23:13] dramatic the way the prophet, you know,
[23:16] if you can visualize it. There's
[23:17] actually a clip on YouTube where they've
[23:19] taken war footage and they've put it
[23:21] together with the song and they'll show
[23:23] you how these soldiers were trapped.
[23:25] Amen. It was a a group of soldiers and
[23:28] they were trapped. They were pinned down
[23:30] by the
[23:31] enemy and they they needed to get word
[23:34] back to the
[23:36] headquarters and the only thing they had
[23:39] was this homing bird, this dove. So they
[23:43] put this message
[23:46] on the foot of the dove. Yes. Thank you,
[23:49] Lord. And they released the dove. Amen.
[23:53] And this dove was flying. But I think it
[23:55] was German soldiers that saw this dove
[23:57] flying and they knew that it was
[23:59] carrying an important message. Amen. So
[24:02] they started to shoot at this dove and
[24:05] the prophet would dramatize it such that
[24:06] he would say, "Amen. They shot its one
[24:08] wing." Amen. And he's typing that with
[24:11] Jesus on the cross now. And he's saying
[24:13] they shot that thing. They wounded that
[24:15] dove. He says, "But the dove managed to
[24:17] fly all the way back to the headquarters
[24:19] and pass the message in the camp." Yes,
[24:22] he did. And then they they they got the
[24:24] message and they sent reinforcements.
[24:27] Amen. And he says Jesus Christ did the
[24:29] same thing for us. Amen. The message
[24:32] landed safely. Denominations tried to
[24:35] kill it, but the message of the wounded
[24:37] dove has come forth. Amen. And that's a
[24:39] song I wanted brother show to sing.
[24:41] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand as he
[24:43] comes forward. Amen.
[24:45] from the outer regions of the
[24:49] lost. God has brought us back.
[24:56] Gates are the gates of hell, you see.
[25:00] And many enter.
[25:06] [Music]
[25:09] Yes, Lord. The thunders
[25:12] [Music]
[25:15] are this time spoke
[25:19] clearly the mystery of the seven sea.
[25:22] Yes
[25:24] Lord church listen.
[25:29] Hallelujah. So here we are in the second
[25:33] of a twofold mystery. Yes, Jesus.
[25:40] Heart spoken by the son of man and the
[25:44] other in you and me. Yes.
[25:50] The message
[25:52] [Music]
[25:54] of went old.
[25:59] Now he's come
[26:00] back
[26:02] again in the power of the word. Speaking
[26:09] resurrection, speaking
[26:12] rapturing faith for
[26:17] redemption from a father's
[26:19] [Music]
[26:26] day with the power that will judge the
[26:29] earth. You
[26:30] see, we are lifted higher.
[26:37] higher and higher and higher until we
[26:41] reach that 7.
[26:44] [Music]
[26:46] And from there we'll change
[26:50] dimension across into another
[26:56] land where we'll meet friends and loved
[26:59] ones and they
[27:03] already. Yes.
[27:06] Come on. The message of the
[27:14] world. Now we come
[27:17] back
[27:19] again. The power of the word speaking
[27:24] resurrection.
[27:27] begin rapur in faith for
[27:35] redemption day.
[27:40] Hallelujah.
[27:43] A window now is

[34:44] And transform them oh God. Oh, with your
[34:48] transforming power, Lord.
[34:50] You took away our stony hearts, given us
[34:53] a a new heart, oh God. Oh, one that
[34:57] could come, one that could be united
[34:59] with you, one that can have fellowship
[35:01] with you, one that is not contrary to
[35:03] your nature, oh God. Lord, oh father,
[35:07] thank you. Oh, we so appreciate you this
[35:10] morning, oh God.
[35:12] We so much love you, oh God. Amen. Oh,

[35:17] angel of God in our midst. Yes, Lord.
[35:20] Oh, is he?
[35:22] Yes, Lord. We know nothing can stop your
[35:25] move, oh God.
[35:27] Lord, nothing can stop that move. Oh,
[35:30] many obstacles may come, but your
[35:33] purpose must be fulfilled, oh God. And
[35:36] we are here this morning, oh God.
[35:39] Because, Lord, you have predestinated us
[35:40] to be, Lord. before the foundations of
[35:43] the world, you knew that we would be
[35:45] here and you add us in your thoughts, oh
[35:48] God, and we pray this morning as you've
[35:51] already made provision for us, oh God,
[35:53] Lord, and continuing to do so, may you
[35:56] make provision for us this morning for
[35:58] the things that we have need of, Father.
[36:00] Lord, and now we pray, Holy Spirit, as
[36:02] we reverence you. And we know that
[36:04] you're here amongst us. We pray that
[36:06] you'll come and speak to our hearts.
[36:08] Come and speak to our needs. Come and
[36:10] speak to our different circumstances,
[36:12] our different situation. And come Lord,
[36:15] have your own way. Have free cause this
[36:17] morning. Oh God, if there's anything
[36:18] that will hinder the move, anything that
[36:20] is contrary to you right now, we come
[36:22] against it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[36:25] And that you will have the preeminence
[36:27] over every situation. We ask it now in
[36:30] Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[36:34] Amen.
[36:35] We thank God once again that we can be
[36:38] found in his house. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:40] You know the devil is an obstructionist.
[36:44] You know obstacles has come our way this
[36:46] morning. We left home left in good time
[36:49] thinking that we once we reached the
[36:50] freeway we will get in a certain time.
[36:53] But as we come on the freeway and as we
[36:55] already passed a quarter way past our
[36:58] home suddenly there's a major accident
[37:02] and the freeway comes to a standstill.
[37:04] And I could you could see there was no
[37:06] end to this and and definitely we knew
[37:09] that we in a problem now because the
[37:11] freeway is a complete stencil from where
[37:13] we were. And I didn't have my phone to
[37:16] have seen what's happening because I
[37:17] would have known at you know with my
[37:18] work phone I would have known what's
[37:19] going on and I left my phone at home.
[37:22] And then thank God but God makes a way.
[37:25] Then there was this construction and
[37:26] they had a little gap that I could take
[37:29] my car off of off the freeway, divert
[37:31] onto the other to the southbound and I
[37:35] said, "What? Let me try and get onto the
[37:37] beach route." So I go on to Durban and
[37:39] try to get to the beach route. Then
[37:42] there's a major race. The entire beach
[37:45] road is closed. And I said, "Okay, the
[37:48] only way now is for me to divert to get
[37:51] road and uh try and go to the old north
[37:54] coast road." And as we get to road is
[37:56] all the traffic is on road. I said,
[37:59] "Okay, let me try and get to
[38:00] Morningside." And from
[38:03] Morningside, we said the best way from
[38:06] Morningside for me was to get through
[38:08] metro and get back onto the freeway.
[38:10] That eventually I did that and as I come
[38:12] back on the freeway now all the traffic
[38:14] is on the M4. But anyway, thank God I am
[38:16] here and he made a way for us. Amen. And
[38:19] uh God has the reason for everything.
[38:21] Amen.
[38:23] So anyway, if you got your Bibles this
[38:25] morning, I see many believers, some
[38:27] believers are gone away. Pray that God
[38:29] will be with them. And those that are
[38:31] here, we pray that you'll be blessed
[38:32] this morning. Amen.
[38:34] We'll turn our Bibles to the book of
[38:36] Joshua, chapter 1, reading from verse 8.
[38:51] You know Joshua 18 is God's success
[38:53] formula.
[38:56] Amen. Amen.
[39:00] So in verse 8 he says the book of the
[39:03] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[39:05] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[39:08] night. Amen. and thou mayest observe to
[39:12] do according to all that is written
[39:17] therein. For then, so firstly, there's a
[39:21] commandment. Yes. To to meditate upon
[39:24] the
[39:25] word, to observe, to do everything
[39:28] according to the word. Amen. In other
[39:30] words, then you want to be all of the
[39:31] word. Yes. Right.
[39:34] And then it says, "For then thou shalt
[39:38] make thy way prosperous." Yes. "And then
[39:43] thou shall have good success." Amen. You
[39:47] may be seated. Amen.
[39:53] So, we just want to speak for a thought
[39:56] this morning. Being successful God's
[40:00] way. Amen.
[40:03] And for the subtitle, we call it success
[40:06] is doing the will of God.
[40:10] Amen. So we know that when God was
[40:13] preparing Joshua to lead Israel into the
[40:16] promised land, he did not give him a
[40:18] strategy based on worldly wisdom.
[40:22] Amen. He gave him a spiritual
[40:27] strategy and that was to meditate on the
[40:29] word. Amen.
[40:31] to speak it, to live it, and obey it.
[40:37] God said that would lead him to success
[40:41] and prosperity.
[40:44] But not the kind of success the world
[40:46] defines.
[40:49] Amen. So God's success is fulfilling his
[40:52] will.
[40:54] Amen. The prophet said that God told
[40:57] Joshua turn don't turn to the right or
[41:00] to the left from it.
[41:03] And he said then thou shalt make thy way
[41:07] prosperous.
[41:08] Then you shall have good success.
[41:13] And he said when the church all unite
[41:15] itself
[41:16] together away from its
[41:19] creeds and if we could put it now in
[41:21] modern terms away from our own ideas.
[41:24] Yes. Away from our own opinions of the
[41:28] word and upon the word of God,
[41:31] the revealed word that is given to us.
[41:35] Then the church will have good success.
[41:38] Amen. Amen. He says that in a message, a
[41:40] trumpet gives an uncertain sound.
[41:44] So we know that the prophet of Torah
[41:45] that success is doing the will of God.
[41:47] Yes. Regardless of what it looks like.
[41:50] Amen. In the eyes of man. Amen.
[41:54] So to be successful in God's eyes is to
[41:57] find your calling and fulfill the
[42:00] fulfill the word that's written for you.
[42:03] Yes. Amen. You can't you can't take a if
[42:07] you want to be successful, you can't
[42:09] take a word that's for another person.
[42:11] Yes. Amen. There was a dispensation of
[42:14] the prophet. He had his part. He had his
[42:16] word. There was a dispensation of Jesus
[42:19] Christ. He could come and take the word
[42:21] that pertains to him and he could walk
[42:22] in perfect faith because he saw himself
[42:24] in the word and he could walk in the
[42:26] word of his day.
[42:28] Same with the prophets. So for us to
[42:31] walk in this perfect faith, we've got to
[42:33] take the word that pertains to us.
[42:37] So that's the only kind of success that
[42:39] God recognizes.
[42:43] Now God is a standard and the world as a
[42:45] standard. Yes. Now a dictionary meaning
[42:49] of success is success is the achievement
[42:52] of a desired
[42:53] goal such as for obtaining name and fame
[42:57] or wealth or higher degree for which a
[43:00] person has tried his level best. It is
[43:03] the positive consequences of one
[43:05] achievement.
[43:07] Now it is good to have something
[43:09] positive to achieve. It's good to have
[43:12] things that you have a vision for in
[43:14] this life. Hallelujah.
[43:16] But
[43:17] ultimately you got to recognize that you
[43:19] are put here for the purpose of God.
[43:22] Amen. There is your purpose made out of
[43:25] your own free will. But there's also
[43:26] God's eternal purpose. Amen. Which was
[43:29] already predestinated for your life.
[43:31] That's why he chose you for a time and
[43:33] season to come into this age that you
[43:36] are living in. Because in this age
[43:39] there's a group of people has to make
[43:40] the rapture. Amen. There's a group of
[43:44] people has to have rapturing faith.
[43:46] Amen. There's a group of people whose
[43:48] work has to change. And there was a time
[43:50] when Mary said, "Be it unto me according
[43:53] to thy word." Now under that, when she
[43:58] said, "Be unto me according to thy
[44:00] word." In other words, she agreed with
[44:02] the word. She had no doubts, but she
[44:05] accepted the word as it was given to
[44:06] her.
[44:08] Amen. But when she did that, what
[44:11] happened? conception took place within
[44:13] her. Amen. And now something happened on
[44:16] the inside that nobody could see on the
[44:18] outside. But as the months went
[44:22] along, it began to show on the outside.
[44:26] That something took place on the inside.
[44:28] Glory. Hallelujah. And our walk couldn't
[44:30] be the same because she's not walking as
[44:34] a normal person. Now she's walking as a
[44:36] pregnant person.
[44:38] So her walk is different cuz she's
[44:40] impregnated with the word.
[44:43] Amen. So her walk began to change. But
[44:47] after the the the
[44:50] the she the word is birthed out of her.
[44:54] Amen. And the word comes forth out of
[44:56] her.
[44:58] You're no longer looking at Mary now.
[45:00] Amen. You are now looking at all you're
[45:03] seeing is Jesus. Yes. So there was a
[45:06] time where your walk you have to receive
[45:08] the word. There's a time where your walk
[45:11] start to change. And there comes a time
[45:14] where now it's no longer you that the
[45:16] world sees. The world must see the
[45:19] manifested Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[45:23] The word that was received that you you
[45:26] received the spoken word. Amen. You
[45:29] conceived the word. But then the word
[45:32] came forth out of you.
[45:34] And what happened now? You are now you
[45:36] are hid behind the word. All you are
[45:39] seeing is Jesus Christ.
[45:43] Amen. So the world the world measures
[45:47] success by
[45:49] achievements, right? Achievements of
[45:51] this temporary achievements. They
[45:53] measure success by wealth that you
[45:56] accumulate. They measure it by how
[45:58] popular you are.
[46:00] You know, we're living in a time of
[46:03] social media. People try to get popular
[46:06] by posting things on social media. And
[46:09] the more likes they get, the more views
[46:12] they get, they become popular. Amen. And
[46:16] then they have an influence
[46:18] because they have a following. Yes.
[46:21] Because I mean, if you look at it, back
[46:23] in the days when there was no social
[46:24] media, when a person was popular, they
[46:27] had fans, right? and pian were following
[46:29] them. But now every other every person
[46:32] now has social media and now they become
[46:36] popular by keep posting stuff that
[46:39] attracts people and when people are
[46:41] attracted to it people be people start
[46:43] following them. Yes. And as they
[46:45] following them they become popular and
[46:48] then as they following the things that
[46:50] they do becomes an influence to those
[46:52] people. Yes.
[46:55] Right. But these are temporal things
[46:59] and often deceptive in Islam. Amen.
[47:03] Amen. Agree. For example, if a person is
[47:06] very popular and they present you maybe
[47:09] a certain outfit. Now, because they are
[47:12] so popular and they have such a great
[47:14] influence, you're going to follow their
[47:16] trends.
[47:19] Or if they don't like a certain outfit,
[47:21] you won't like it.
[47:23] You see, we got to watch by who we
[47:25] influenced by.
[47:27] Amen. But God measures success by
[47:31] obedience.
[47:33] Faithfulness and alignment with his
[47:36] word. Amen. He's given us his word. He
[47:40] wants us to be obedient to his word. He
[47:43] wants us to be faithful to his word. And
[47:46] he wants us to align to his words. Amen.
[47:49] Amen. And there's no other age that you
[47:52] could come into perfect alignment as
[47:54] this age because now is the age of
[47:57] oneness. Father, may they be one as even
[48:00] as we are one. When the headstone comes
[48:03] down to the body, Amen. They must come
[48:06] into perfect alignment. Thank you, Lord.
[48:09] Because everybody that's not in the
[48:11] alignment misses the rapture. Only those
[48:14] that come into this perfect alignment
[48:16] with the headstone. Amen. they are going
[48:18] through. Amen. Amen.
[48:21] Now we know the prophet speaks about the
[48:24] rich rang ruler and he said notice this
[48:27] now we find that find out that he was a
[48:30] great success.
[48:32] Then we find him later till he was a
[48:34] greater success until he said I have got
[48:38] so much he said boy it made a real
[48:42] genuine guy of this day wouldn't he? He
[48:46] said even my barns are swelled out.
[48:49] They bursting. So he was measuring his
[48:52] success by what all by the things that
[48:55] he achieved.
[48:57] When the time remember this this young
[48:59] man had the opportunity to receive
[49:01] eternal life. Yes. Cuz he was talking to
[49:03] the person of eternal life. He had the
[49:06] opportunity right there. Yes. But it was
[49:09] too hard for him at the time.
[49:12] It's just like we're living in a time
[49:14] now people make choices in life. God
[49:17] made us free moral
[49:18] agents. We sometime uh we we go down a
[49:22] life's path and we say you know what we
[49:24] got to make a career choice and sometime
[49:27] we find these things takes us away from
[49:29] the things of God. But because they we
[49:32] we we see the blessings or we call it
[49:35] blessings. You know there's many things
[49:38] you can call blessings. Yes. But doesn't
[49:40] mean it's the blessing of God. Amen.
[49:44] You might find yourself, I chose this
[49:46] career. I made this choice and look, I'm
[49:48] being blessed. I've got accumulated
[49:50] wealth.
[49:52] I got a new good car. I've got a good
[49:55] home and I've accumulated a good bank
[49:57] balance.
[50:00] But what if that career was taking away
[50:03] from the things of God? Yes. Can we say
[50:06] that God blessed you?
[50:08] What if that career never give you time
[50:10] to spend in the house of God
[50:13] made you join kind of business friends
[50:16] or or friends in the in the career world
[50:20] with great accolades and so forth who
[50:21] are ungodly and they became your
[50:24] influence.
[50:26] They became your idols people that you
[50:28] look up
[50:29] to. You think God will you be pleased
[50:32] with that? So this rich young ruler, he
[50:35] turned away eternal life and he walked
[50:38] away. But when he began to see his
[50:40] wealth accumulate, he thought that God
[50:41] is with him. He said, "I haven't missed
[50:44] out on anything because I'm still being
[50:46] blessed. I'm still being prosperous."
[50:49] You see how dangerous it is that you can
[50:52] miss the mark if you measure your
[50:54] success to the world's measuring stick.
[50:56] Amen. We got to measure it to the yard
[50:58] stick of the word. Amen. Amen.
[51:02] So he find that he said even my buns are
[51:04] swelled
[51:05] out. So he's boasting now. He said they
[51:08] bursting and I've got so much. And I
[51:11] said, "Oh soul, take your rests."
[51:15] In other words, I don't need to do
[51:18] anymore. I've accumulated so much. I
[51:19] don't even I don't need God. I've
[51:22] achieved this because of my hard work,
[51:25] my own
[51:28] accolades, my determination.
[51:31] I've achieved all this. Now he said, "Oh
[51:34] soul, take your rest." Are we in this
[51:37] world to rest? The prophet said, "We on
[51:39] a battleground." Amen.
[51:42] Amen. This is not our resting place
[51:45] here. There will come a day we will go,
[51:48] we'll cross beyond the curtain of time.
[51:50] Or if the Lord carries, we'll go in the
[51:52] rapture and then come back in the
[51:54] millennium reign. And then he'll create
[51:56] a better place for us here. We will have
[51:58] our time of fellowship and rest. But
[52:00] this is the battleground.
[52:05] Our success is measured by completing
[52:08] the cause. Amen. Amen. Lord,
[52:13] you find that he said this. He said, "Oh
[52:15] soul, take a risk." But what he done at
[52:17] the beginning, he rejected the
[52:20] leadership of Jesus Christ.
[52:23] His church, his intelligence, his
[52:26] education, and all had led him to a
[52:29] success. You see he was in religion.
[52:31] Yes. He had good education
[52:34] and obviously his hard work and
[52:36] determination it led him to a good
[52:38] success.
[52:39] All the Jews loved him. You see he he
[52:41] was
[52:42] popular and he could he be an influence
[52:44] onto other people. So he gave to them.
[52:47] He helped them. He might have done this
[52:49] that or the other. But you see he
[52:52] rejected the leadership of Jesus Christ
[52:57] the eternal life. And the Bible said,
[53:00] "Thou fool, tonight your soul is
[53:03] acquired."
[53:05] And we know what happened. We And now we
[53:07] find him the next place in hell. Lifting
[53:10] up his eyes and seeing that beggar that
[53:13] he turned out the street in the bosom of
[53:15] Abraham. What a fatal mistake. How that
[53:18] the churches had been all right in the
[53:20] way that they went, but he still hadn't
[53:23] had eternal life. You see how dangerous
[53:26] it is when you're measuring success?
[53:28] Yes. He said, "Now you see in a message
[53:31] forsaking all, he says, now you
[53:33] see that young man was asked to forsake
[53:37] all, but he refused to do it." And
[53:41] sometime if we apply prosperity and
[53:43] riches and so forth, success. But this
[53:46] young man was a successful young man and
[53:50] still didn't have eternal life. So
[53:52] sometimes success doesn't always mean
[53:55] that God is blessing. Yes.
[53:59] Matthew 6:33 says, "But seek ye first,
[54:03] not second, not last." Yes. Not because
[54:07] everything else is fails. No. Seek ye
[54:10] first. Amen. The kingdom of God. Amen.
[54:14] Make sure you got the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[54:17] And is righteousness. Sorry.
[54:21] And all these things, the things that
[54:25] you need by to get by in this mortal
[54:28] life,
[54:30] because you have to get by in this
[54:32] mortal life. You need a job. You need a
[54:36] good home. You need a shelter over your
[54:37] head. You need clothes to wear. You have
[54:40] you need food to eat. These are things
[54:43] that you need in this mortal life
[54:46] shall be added unto you. Yes. Then Jesus
[54:50] said, "Take no thought
[54:52] of what clothes you're going to wear,
[54:53] what food you're going to eat. Your
[54:55] father never knows the things that you
[54:56] have need of." Amen. But Jesus was
[54:59] trying to say, "You come up higher."
[55:02] Think on higher thoughts.
[55:04] Don't think on temporal thoughts.
[55:08] Amen. So we make choices and the choices
[55:11] you make are sometimes selfish choices.
[55:14] Unfortunately,
[55:19] Not all the time but there are sometimes
[55:21] we do make choices that are
[55:24] selfish because sometimes we want to do
[55:27] things that satisfy ourself that pleases
[55:32] ourselves as if we are living for
[55:35] ourselves only. You see that is a person
[55:38] that hasn't have the doesn't have the
[55:40] Holy Ghost. That's a person now that
[55:43] doesn't see themsel in the body. Yes.
[55:46] that doesn't see themsself as a person
[55:49] who has purpose, a person that put on
[55:52] the earth for a purpose, for God's
[55:54] purpose and by divine choosing. Amen.
[55:57] Yes.
[55:58] We are not living in this world for
[56:00] ourselves. Amen. Not us in the message.
[56:03] Not us that are elected. The elected
[56:06] ones are not called out to live for
[56:09] ourselves. Eternal life is living for
[56:12] others. Amen. Amen. That's what the
[56:14] prophet taught us. Yes.
[56:16] Amen. But we are living for God.
[56:20] For God's purpose to be achieved in and
[56:22] through our lives.
[56:25] Amen.
[56:27] We are pleased here because we got a
[56:29] work to do. Amen. And our work is to
[56:33] manifest Jesus Christ again to prove to
[56:36] the world that Jesus Christ has been
[56:38] risen from the dead and he's alive and
[56:41] he lives forever more. Yes. Amen. And
[56:43] eternal life is only through Jesus
[56:45] Christ. Amen.
[56:48] Amen. So we are living unaware of things
[56:50] that are to be. Yes. Amen. The message
[56:54] of the hour, the opening of the word
[56:55] comes to reveal to us all the things
[56:58] that are happening on the earth right
[56:59] now. Amen. That's why the Bible says all
[57:02] the world will be
[57:04] deceived and go into the systems. this
[57:07] antichrist system, but not those that
[57:10] are elected. Not those where the word is
[57:13] revealed to. That's why you know who the
[57:16] antichrist is. You know who the great ho
[57:19] is. You know who the hells are. You know
[57:21] who the daughters are. You know right
[57:23] now where's America's place in the
[57:25] Bible. Yes. You know where's Russia's
[57:27] place in the Bible. Amen. You know
[57:30] where's Vatican's place in the Bible.
[57:33] Nothing is unfair toward you. Amen.
[57:36] You
[57:37] hear of what economies that want to
[57:39] crash. You know what is happening. You
[57:41] know what's happening with the money
[57:42] system. Amen. All these things have been
[57:45] revealed to you. Amen. Amen. You know
[57:48] who controls the wealth of the world.
[57:50] Amen.
[57:52] And you know why the world has to go
[57:54] into one world religion. Yes. Amen.
[57:57] Because that is what Satan's plan was
[58:00] all along. Amen. But you are not unaware
[58:03] of it. Yes. Yes. You're also made aware
[58:06] of the destruction of Sodom. Yes. Modern
[58:08] day Sodom.
[58:12] So we find that we make these choices.
[58:15] But we must live our lives not for
[58:17] ourselves but for God. Amen. The only
[58:20] way to really be successful,
[58:24] it has to
[58:26] be we must be in the will of God and not
[58:29] for ourselves. Amen. Yes.
[58:32] When you seek first the kingdom, all you
[58:35] have need of will be added. Amen. But
[58:38] you've got to have faith. When you
[58:40] seeking the king said, "No, I'll seek
[58:42] the
[58:43] kingdom, but I need to do certain things
[58:46] because I need to achieve the certain
[58:48] things."
[58:50] And then you want to try and achieve
[58:51] those things by your
[58:53] own abilities.
[58:55] Everything you do as a believer must be
[58:58] in the will of if the Lord will it.
[59:00] Amen. It must be in the Lord will it.
[59:03] Amen. We must seek the face of God in
[59:06] every choice we make. Every decision
[59:08] that we make in this life, we must seek
[59:11] the face of God. Then you will have good
[59:13] success. And it must be in line with the
[59:16] word. Amen. It must it might seem good.
[59:20] It might seem religious sometimes.
[59:23] It must it might seem pious sometimes,
[59:26] but it might not be the will of God.
[59:29] Yes. Sometimes you might want to be a
[59:32] person that showing sympathy.
[59:34] But you must have discernment when
[59:36] you're showing sympathy. Amen. When
[59:38] Jesus walked to the pool of Bethesda,
[59:40] there were many sick people there. Yes.
[59:42] That pool, that area was like a clinic.
[59:45] There were people just laying there all
[59:46] over sick people. But Jesus went to one
[59:49] person. Amen. Amen. Cuz he said I the
[59:52] son can do nothing le except the father
[59:54] shows him and every son of god and
[59:57] daughter of god must come that way.
[59:59] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:01] Cuz we are all success lays in the
[1:00:03] father's business. Amen.
[1:00:07] So when you seek first the kingdom of
[1:00:09] god all you have need of will be added.
[1:00:12] But that is trusting God and believing
[1:00:14] he will keep that word. Amen.
[1:00:19] So you know the problem it doesn't
[1:00:22] matter what type of person you
[1:00:24] are. If you trust in God and you are
[1:00:27] staying in his word whatever you are be
[1:00:29] the best for what he put you. Amen.
[1:00:32] Amen. Yes.
[1:00:35] So the prophet say that whatever god put
[1:00:37] made you be be the best that he made
[1:00:40] you. Yes. Amen. Don't try and have
[1:00:44] measure your success of somebody else
[1:00:45] where God placed them. Amen. I can't
[1:00:48] measure my success and say another
[1:00:51] brother his ministry is so and so I want
[1:00:54] to be like that brother. Yes,
[1:00:56] that I can't have success by following
[1:00:58] another brother's ministry. Yes, I got
[1:01:01] to have success in what God has placed
[1:01:03] me. Amen. Where I'm positionally placed
[1:01:06] and I only can be blessed if I'm in a
[1:01:09] place that God has placed me. Yes. Thank
[1:01:11] you, Lord. Amen. Amen. God don't look
[1:01:14] like the world sees it. Yes. God don't
[1:01:17] look at church and pal, how big the
[1:01:19] church is, how much pomp it has, how
[1:01:22] many members he got. No, God don't
[1:01:24] measure like success like that. Amen.
[1:01:30] It's true. So we will look at certain
[1:01:33] things, the foundation of success and
[1:01:35] knowing God's will. Amen. Ephesians 1:9
[1:01:40] says, "Having made known unto us the
[1:01:44] mystery of his world, Amen. According to
[1:01:47] his good pleasure. Yes. Which he had
[1:01:49] purpose in himself. Amen. So it was
[1:01:52] God's good pleasure to make known to us
[1:01:54] the mystery of his will. Yes. Amen.
[1:01:57] That in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:01:59] of time he might gather together in one
[1:02:02] all things in Christ. Amen. Christ is
[1:02:06] the word, right? Out of the word you
[1:02:09] can't be gathered. Amen. So you must be
[1:02:12] gathered in Christ. In the word. both
[1:02:15] which are in heaven, which are on earth,
[1:02:16] even in him. Amen.
[1:02:20] So we find that we
[1:02:22] must God has made known the mystery of
[1:02:25] his
[1:02:27] will. Romans 12:2 says, "Be not
[1:02:29] conformed to this world." Yes. In other
[1:02:32] words, to this world system. Yes.
[1:02:35] this world that was where Eve was
[1:02:38] influenced by and sin came into the
[1:02:41] world and then Satan could offer Jesus
[1:02:44] his kingdom. He said if you bow unto me
[1:02:47] I will give you all his kingdoms. So we
[1:02:50] can't be conformed to this world. The
[1:02:53] pattern of this
[1:02:54] world, the politics of this world,
[1:02:57] right? Amen. Every politics is corrupt.
[1:03:00] Yes.
[1:03:01] Every kingdom is corrupt in this world.
[1:03:03] Yes. Cuz all this life is Satan is a god
[1:03:08] of this evil age. That's right.
[1:03:11] But be transformed.
[1:03:14] Hallelujah. How are you transforming? By
[1:03:16] the renewing of your mind. Yes, sir.
[1:03:20] That may prove what is that good and
[1:03:22] acceptable and perfect will of God.
[1:03:25] Thank you, Lord. So, finding God's will
[1:03:28] is foundational. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:31] Otherwise, you'll be walking without you
[1:03:34] thinking you're doing God a service but
[1:03:36] out of his will. Right? Didn't the
[1:03:38] Catholics do that? Didn't the Catholics
[1:03:41] think, don't they? Even now, don't the
[1:03:43] Catholics think that they're doing God's
[1:03:44] will?
[1:03:49] They think by being religious, by doing
[1:03:51] all the good works they doing and being
[1:03:53] a religious shirt, they think they're
[1:03:54] doing God's will. Don't the denomination
[1:03:56] think the same thing?
[1:03:59] trying to do God a service without his
[1:04:01] will.
[1:04:03] Wasn't the the Jews jealous? They
[1:04:06] thought they doing God's will.
[1:04:10] So finding God's will is foundational.
[1:04:14] Amen. It requires what? Us to be
[1:04:17] consecrated unto him and a desire to be
[1:04:21] led by his spirit. Yes.
[1:04:26] Thank you, Lord. The message of the hour
[1:04:28] that comes. Amen. It comes to reveal to
[1:04:31] us God's will in this age. Amen. God's
[1:04:34] purpose in this age. God's will in this
[1:04:38] age was to have a people called out.
[1:04:40] Amen. Yes. Amen. To have a bride for the
[1:04:44] bridegroom. Yes. To have a bride for
[1:04:46] Christ. And then he comes down the the
[1:04:50] mighty God unveiled before us. Amen.
[1:04:53] There must be a union, visible union
[1:04:55] between the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:04:57] earthly bride. That was God's will.
[1:05:00] Amen. That they will come into a union.
[1:05:02] They will come into a marriage. And
[1:05:05] God's will in this day was that you will
[1:05:07] come out of amnesia and recognize your
[1:05:09] true identification. Amen. It was God's
[1:05:13] will for that. Amen. Amen. It was God's
[1:05:16] will that you'll be united with Christ
[1:05:17] in his day. It was God's will that you
[1:05:21] must now conceive and reproduce Jesus
[1:05:25] Christ again. Yes.
[1:05:27] It was God's will that in this age the
[1:05:30] title needed will come back to the
[1:05:34] earth. So we find
[1:05:38] that the greatest thing, the greatest
[1:05:40] way to find what God wants to do is stay
[1:05:42] with the word. Amen. Stay with the
[1:05:44] message that's revealed to us. Amen. So
[1:05:47] stay with it, appreciate it, don't let
[1:05:49] it become common to you. Meditate upon
[1:05:51] it day in and day out. Amen. Yes. This
[1:05:57] message is of vital importance. You
[1:06:00] don't realize how important this is.
[1:06:02] Amen. These are words of eternal life.
[1:06:04] Amen. In this message laid rapturing
[1:06:06] faith. Amen. This very word that you're
[1:06:10] eating, something is happening on the
[1:06:12] inside that is going to change your
[1:06:14] mortal body from mortal to immortality.
[1:06:19] Not we know the end result is the end
[1:06:22] result part of adoption is the body is
[1:06:24] going to change. We with the redemption
[1:06:26] of our bodies. Yes. But the process that
[1:06:29] going through God is taking you back to
[1:06:32] the original condition. Amen. God, you
[1:06:35] are remember we must fulfill the
[1:06:37] ultimate part of being successful is to
[1:06:40] finish the cause that God has placed you
[1:06:42] here for. Yes. And God has placed us in
[1:06:44] this age cuz they will not ask it or be
[1:06:47] made perfect because it's in this age
[1:06:49] when title deed comes down
[1:06:52] and God now has rightful claims over his
[1:06:56] bride. Amen. When now he can claim and
[1:06:59] say now I can produce seed in her. If
[1:07:01] he's in this age, it couldn't happen in
[1:07:04] any other age. Amen. But in this age, he
[1:07:08] could come into union with her. Amen.
[1:07:10] Amen. That's why in the end of the age,
[1:07:12] he says, "Those that will come to me and
[1:07:14] say, Lord, have I not prophesied in your
[1:07:16] name? Have I not cast out demons in your
[1:07:19] name?" He said, "Depart from me workers
[1:07:21] of iniquity. I know you not." There was
[1:07:24] no union. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:27] So we find
[1:07:29] that it is in this age
[1:07:33] that God's purpose must be fulfilled
[1:07:35] that they will be this people on the
[1:07:37] earth. Amen. There will be be a people
[1:07:40] that will carry forth his name. Amen.
[1:07:42] There will be be people that will
[1:07:43] manifest his life. Yes. There will be
[1:07:46] people that will manifest his very
[1:07:48] nature, his very attributes. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:52] His very character. Yes.
[1:07:54] Because all you must see, remember as I
[1:07:57] said the final part of adoption is be
[1:07:59] with the redemption of our bodies, the
[1:08:03] the final change of the body. But he's
[1:08:05] in this age is taking us back showing us
[1:08:08] where man originally fell from. Yes.
[1:08:11] What was man's condition before the
[1:08:13] fall? Yes. And he's showing us this
[1:08:17] condition was achieved. This was shown
[1:08:19] there by 2,000 years ago. It was shown
[1:08:22] by Jesus Christ. But in this day, there
[1:08:25] was another man named William Marin
[1:08:27] Brandom who could come to that and show
[1:08:29] another son of God in his day who could
[1:08:31] walk into dominion. Amen. Who could walk
[1:08:34] where there was a killer bull. Yes. And
[1:08:36] he could speak to the bull. Amen. Who
[1:08:38] could walk who could speak to the owners
[1:08:40] to go to its place.
[1:08:42] Who could bring that little fish back to
[1:08:44] life. Yes. Who could speak to the storm.
[1:08:49] Yes, sir.
[1:08:51] Amen. in this day. So there must be
[1:08:54] another people on the earth because
[1:08:57] Jesus said, "Greater works than these
[1:08:59] shall he do." Amen. Because I go to the
[1:09:02] father. Yes. There must be a people in
[1:09:04] this day who fulfill their scripture.
[1:09:07] John 14:12. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:11] 1 Samuel 15:22
[1:09:14] says, "And Samuel said, "At the
[1:09:18] Lord as great delight in burnt offerings
[1:09:21] and
[1:09:21] sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of
[1:09:25] the Lord, behold to obey is better than
[1:09:29] sacrifice." Yes. Amen. and to hearken
[1:09:32] then the fat of
[1:09:34] rams. For rebellion is as the sin of
[1:09:37] witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:09:39] iniquity and idolatry. Amen. You want to
[1:09:42] have success? Obey his word. Yes. His
[1:09:45] word gives us precepts how to live by.
[1:09:50] His word shows us the condition we ought
[1:09:52] to be in. His word gives us warning of
[1:09:55] what not to follow. He give us the
[1:09:56] examples. Don't follow this part. This
[1:09:59] will be the end result. Don't take this
[1:10:02] way. This is where it will lead you.
[1:10:04] Follow this way and this will be the
[1:10:06] right way. There's an answer for
[1:10:08] everything. Amen. The prophet said is
[1:10:10] there's a Bible question, there's a
[1:10:12] Bible answer for it. Yes. In everything
[1:10:14] that you go through in this message, we
[1:10:16] have an answer for everything. Amen.
[1:10:18] Amen. Whether it's a marriage problem, a
[1:10:20] relationship problem, whether it's
[1:10:22] sickness, whether what financial
[1:10:24] problem, whatever problem, whether it's
[1:10:25] a spiritual problem, whether it's a
[1:10:27] demon problem, whatever problem you
[1:10:29] have, the answer is in the word. Amen.
[1:10:32] And God gives you the solution. Amen. If
[1:10:35] you go to your doctor and your doctor
[1:10:37] prescribed medicine and you don't follow
[1:10:39] the prescription, you can't go blame
[1:10:41] your doctor and say the doctor is a bad
[1:10:43] doctor
[1:10:44] if you don't follow the prescription. So
[1:10:47] the word give you the prescriptions of
[1:10:49] what you need to do in a particular
[1:10:51] problem. Amen. He has the solutions cuz
[1:10:54] God wants you to have great success.
[1:10:56] That's why he said meditate upon it day
[1:10:57] and night. You should have good success.
[1:10:59] Amen. Don't depart from the sin. Amen.
[1:11:03] But if you don't follow it then you now
[1:11:06] when you don't follow it now you're
[1:11:07] trying to do good works. Your good works
[1:11:10] can't save you. Amen.
[1:11:13] God Jesus said if you love me you will
[1:11:16] keep my words and my words will not be
[1:11:18] grievious unto
[1:11:20] you Samuel is saying be to obey is
[1:11:23] better than sacrifice to hearken than
[1:11:26] the fat of rams. He says for rebellion
[1:11:29] is as the sin of witchcraft and
[1:11:32] stubbornness is as iniquity and
[1:11:35] idolatry. So when the word is coming and
[1:11:37] the word is bringing
[1:11:40] correction you can't rebel from it. Yes.
[1:11:43] You've got to recognize that every time
[1:11:45] the word is being spoken, God is
[1:11:47] speaking through you. Say, "Thank you,
[1:11:48] Lord." Yes, Lord. You are dealing with
[1:11:50] me. You know that is the love of God.
[1:11:53] You've got to understand God's love is
[1:11:55] corrective. God loved you so much that
[1:11:58] he can rebuke you through his word. And
[1:12:00] you must be so great. You know, if you a
[1:12:02] true son and daughter of God that has a
[1:12:04] teachable spirit, you say, "Lord, I
[1:12:06] thank you that you are correcting me. If
[1:12:09] you're walking in this hour, you've got
[1:12:10] to walk in humility. Amen. Amen. You're
[1:12:13] going to walk with a meek spirit. You're
[1:12:15] going to walk humble. Amen. Before the
[1:12:17] Lord
[1:12:18] and say, "Lord, I thank you that your
[1:12:20] word is correcting because the word is
[1:12:22] there to edify you. The word is there to
[1:12:24] build you up. The word is there to make
[1:12:26] sure you complete your cause." Amen.
[1:12:32] Amen. So he said, "We may have good
[1:12:36] zeal, good intentions. Oh, we want to do
[1:12:38] the work of the Lord. We want to do
[1:12:40] things for the Lord.
[1:12:42] But the main ultimate thing is God is
[1:12:44] saying but obedience to God's revealed
[1:12:46] word is better than religious works.
[1:12:50] Amen.
[1:12:53] You know God had many examples in the
[1:12:55] Bible. We see Joshua's success was
[1:12:57] rooted in his faithfulness to the
[1:12:59] commission given through Moses. Yeah.
[1:13:03] Joshua 11:15 says, "And the Lord
[1:13:05] commanded Moses his servant." Sorry. As
[1:13:09] the Lord commanded Moses his servant.
[1:13:11] Joshua 11:15. As the Lord commanded
[1:13:13] Moses his servant, so did Moses command
[1:13:17] Joshua.
[1:13:19] And so did Joshua and left nothing
[1:13:22] undone of all that the Lord commanded
[1:13:25] Moses.
[1:13:26] You see, this is a rich heritage. Yes.
[1:13:29] It is passed on from generation to
[1:13:31] generation. Amen. That's why God said
[1:13:33] Abraham will teach his children. Amen.
[1:13:36] Amen. That's why Brandham could teach
[1:13:38] could store up this food because he knew
[1:13:40] generations will come and they will take
[1:13:42] from that word. They will obey that word
[1:13:44] and they will continue that part. Amen.
[1:13:47] Amen.
[1:13:49] But if you want to repel and go on your
[1:13:51] own and say no I don't want to take from
[1:13:53] that word I will have my own opinions
[1:13:54] upon his word. You see then you are
[1:13:57] having to receive commandments.
[1:13:59] You see commandment is passed on from
[1:14:02] the prophets then the ministers that
[1:14:04] came forth first generation of ministers
[1:14:06] that took this message that swept this
[1:14:08] message across. Amen. That labored that
[1:14:11] brought people through and they
[1:14:13] commanded this word and then there was
[1:14:16] another generation that received that
[1:14:17] word that obeyed that word. Amen. And
[1:14:20] now they can take that out and pass it
[1:14:22] on to another generation. There must be
[1:14:25] a continuation of the word. Amen.
[1:14:29] Because the cause is not completed as
[1:14:31] yet. Amen. The cause is completed when
[1:14:33] the rapture goes. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:37] So we find
[1:14:39] that when Christ came on the earth,
[1:14:41] imagine Christ, he did all his great
[1:14:45] meetings, healing crusades and so forth,
[1:14:48] casting out demons, discerning the
[1:14:49] hearts of the people. And he could have
[1:14:51] left the final part. Amen. But he had to
[1:14:54] complete the cause. Yes. Amen. He had to
[1:14:57] go all the way to Calvary. Then he had
[1:15:00] to be risen from the dead and ascended.
[1:15:02] Not only was he ascended, he he took
[1:15:05] others with him. He took the captives
[1:15:07] that were out there in the grave. He
[1:15:08] took them took them up into the seven
[1:15:10] dimension. Amen.
[1:15:14] Yes. So Jesus was the perfect example of
[1:15:17] success cuz
[1:15:18] he fulfilled the father's will in every
[1:15:22] way possible. Amen. Amen. He left
[1:15:25] nothing, no stone
[1:15:26] unturned. Jesus kept all the word. Amen.
[1:15:30] Amen. And he is our example. Amen. Yes.
[1:15:33] That if we must produce Christ again, we
[1:15:36] keep all the word. Amen. That's why when
[1:15:39] Mary could come to him, the word will
[1:15:40] correct the error. Yes. Amen. That's why
[1:15:43] when you go to John the Baptism, John
[1:15:44] the Baptist, the word was going to the
[1:15:46] prophet because why? He was obedient to
[1:15:48] the word. He knew that the word must go
[1:15:50] to the prophets. Yes.
[1:15:52] He didn't go present himself to anybody
[1:15:55] else. Jesus didn't try to be popular in
[1:15:57] his day, present himself to the high
[1:15:59] priest and so forth and say, "Look, I
[1:16:01] know so much. I know this." When he was
[1:16:03] young, when he was 12, he was there
[1:16:04] among the scholars discussing the word.
[1:16:07] Yes.
[1:16:09] But he didn't go when ministry now and
[1:16:11] produce a great meeting in front of
[1:16:12] them. Yes. Yes. He went to the
[1:16:15] publicans. He went to sinners. Thank
[1:16:16] you, Lord. You see, you want to have
[1:16:19] good success? What is the father's
[1:16:21] business? Is the father's business come
[1:16:22] to preach those to those that are saved
[1:16:24] only or you should have a
[1:16:29] concern. When you are convinced, you
[1:16:31] must be concerned. Amen. The prophet
[1:16:33] says, when you are convinced, you are
[1:16:35] convinced that the rapture is going to
[1:16:37] go. You are convinced that the world is
[1:16:38] going in circulation. You are convinced
[1:16:40] what is going to happen to this world.
[1:16:43] You are convinced that the message is
[1:16:45] genuine. Amen. Aren't you concerned?
[1:16:47] Hallelujah. Those that are full of the
[1:16:50] Holy Ghost are crying and signing for
[1:16:52] the abominations of the lost.
[1:16:55] If you're convinced that this is the
[1:16:57] truth,
[1:16:58] then aren't you concerned about your
[1:17:00] families that are lost? Aren't you
[1:17:01] concerned about people that you
[1:17:03] associate with that are lost to tell
[1:17:04] them the truth? Thank you, Lord. Because
[1:17:07] being good with them is not the what's
[1:17:09] going to save them, but speaking the
[1:17:11] truth. Amen. Because the truth shall set
[1:17:13] you free. Amen.
[1:17:22] So Jesus was successful because he
[1:17:24] stayed in the father's will.
[1:17:26] Amen. In Paul in 2 Timothy 4:7 and 8, he
[1:17:31] said, "I have fought a good
[1:17:34] fight. I have finished my cause." Amen.
[1:17:38] I have kept the faith.
[1:17:40] Yes. Paul now come at the end of his
[1:17:42] journey. Yes. He knew his calling and he
[1:17:45] made his calling. election shore. He
[1:17:48] knew what he was predestinated for.
[1:17:50] Amen. He knew the end result of his
[1:17:52] journey and he could measure his
[1:17:57] journey and he could measure his success
[1:18:00] by the fact that he was obedient to his
[1:18:02] vision. Amen. For what he for the
[1:18:05] purpose that he was called for and he
[1:18:07] could when he could see that purpose was
[1:18:09] now fulfilled. Now he says, "I have
[1:18:11] fought a good fight."
[1:18:14] So you're fighting a fight. But it's a
[1:18:16] good fight. Amen. Amen. Because it's a
[1:18:19] good fight because this fight is to
[1:18:22] what? To show that they are citizens of
[1:18:26] a faith
[1:18:27] civilization. That they are citizens of
[1:18:29] another kingdom. Amen. Of an eternal
[1:18:32] kingdom. Amen. You are showing the you
[1:18:36] are showing Satan and his demons that we
[1:18:39] are children of the most high God. We
[1:18:42] know who we are. We know what this
[1:18:44] battle is about. We know Satan what the
[1:18:47] end of the battle is. That you'll be
[1:18:49] cast into the lake of fire. So it is a
[1:18:52] good fight. Amen. Because you know what
[1:18:54] the end result is. Amen. You know that
[1:18:57] God is going to establish his kingdom on
[1:18:59] the earth. Amen. Amen. It is going to be
[1:19:01] an eternal kingdom. Amen. And there is
[1:19:04] going to come as son of David again.
[1:19:08] Yeah.
[1:19:10] So Paul says, "I have fought in good
[1:19:12] fights.
[1:19:14] I have finished my cause."
[1:19:17] Talking about his own doing a self
[1:19:19] inspection of himself. He said, "I have
[1:19:21] finished my cause." Each one of us have
[1:19:24] a cause. God have placed us here on a
[1:19:28] cause. Are we walking in line with the
[1:19:31] cause that God has placed us for? He
[1:19:33] says, "I have kept the faith." Yes. He
[1:19:36] didn't have doubt. He's not reasoning.
[1:19:38] This is the time to come up higher. This
[1:19:40] is the time to enter the Holy of Holies
[1:19:42] where there's no doubt, where there's no
[1:19:44] reasoning. Amen. There's no there's no
[1:19:47] your own opinions or my opinion and your
[1:19:50] opinion or his opinion or her opinion.
[1:19:53] It is God's word and God's word alone.
[1:19:56] Amen. And God's word must prevail. Amen.
[1:20:00] Yes, Lord.
[1:20:03] So Paul's success wasn't measured by the
[1:20:06] churches he built
[1:20:09] but by fulfilling his portion in the m
[1:20:13] mystery of Christ. Amen. What is your
[1:20:16] portion in the mystery of Christ
[1:20:18] that Christ must be reproduced
[1:20:21] again? Christ must be now in human
[1:20:24] walking again in human flesh. Christ
[1:20:26] must be manifested in human flesh. In
[1:20:29] what? in redeemed bodies again. Amen.
[1:20:33] What is greater? God coming to Jesus
[1:20:35] Christ. That's why saying the greater
[1:20:37] works they shall do. What is greater?
[1:20:39] God coming in a through a virgin birth
[1:20:40] or God coming and transforming you
[1:20:44] coming to sin a redeemed body and now
[1:20:47] coming and manifesting himself through
[1:20:48] you.
[1:20:50] Amen. That is greater in Christ eyes.
[1:20:53] Amen.
[1:20:55] Yes.
[1:20:56] The bride's success. What is our success
[1:20:59] in this time? Amen. Finishing the
[1:21:02] mystery. Yes. Our portion of the word.
[1:21:05] Amen. Brother Brennan did his
[1:21:08] diligently. Yes. Amen.
[1:21:11] Amen. He did it. He didn't do the work
[1:21:13] of God haphazardly.
[1:21:16] He was serious about the work of God.
[1:21:18] Amen. He was consecrated to the service
[1:21:21] of God. Yes. You were.
[1:21:24] And he had his ups and downs. Yes.
[1:21:28] And he had his own lessons learned. He
[1:21:30] was a person. He was a human being like
[1:21:32] everybody else. He had emotions.
[1:21:35] He had his own neurotic problems. He had
[1:21:38] a nervous condition being a
[1:21:41] prophet. And he was abused by the church
[1:21:44] world. But he still finished his cause.
[1:21:47] Amen. Amen. He was still diligent to the
[1:21:50] things of God. Hallelujah.
[1:21:53] Now every son and daughter of God that
[1:21:55] comes must not realize must realize that
[1:21:59] this work of God is not done.
[1:22:01] God doesn't run his kingdom passively.
[1:22:04] God have order in his kingdom. Amen.
[1:22:07] Amen.
[1:22:09] Amen. God has a way of doing things.
[1:22:12] Amen. And if we want to do anything, it
[1:22:15] must be in line with his words. Yes.
[1:22:18] That is why this is the hour we are
[1:22:20] coming into perfect alignment. Say to
[1:22:22] God.
[1:22:26] Amen. Revelation 10:11 says, "And he
[1:22:29] said unto me, thou must prophesy again
[1:22:33] before many peoples and nation and
[1:22:36] tongues and kings." Amen. The book is
[1:22:38] revealed to you. You've got the book
[1:22:41] given to you. The names are in the book.
[1:22:44] Amen. Now, if the book is given to you
[1:22:46] and you got the names in the book, that
[1:22:48] work is done for somebody else.
[1:22:52] You can't say to people, "Oh, just take
[1:22:54] a just take a tape and play." Wonderful.
[1:22:57] God put you now to go speak that word.
[1:23:00] To bring that word out fresh to the
[1:23:02] people. Amen. God do you your life. You
[1:23:06] might be a sister and say, you know, I'm
[1:23:08] not a preacher, but your life,
[1:23:10] the life that you live, the world can't
[1:23:12] live. Amen.
[1:23:14] Because you can truly believe his words.
[1:23:17] Not taking as a rule of law or being I'm
[1:23:20] not talking about a person being
[1:23:21] legalistic because you can get the
[1:23:23] Muslims doing that. You can get the
[1:23:25] other religion doing that. But I'm
[1:23:26] talking about a person that say this is
[1:23:28] the word of God. This is the word for my
[1:23:31] day. This is the way I live. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:36] Just by the life that you live according
[1:23:38] to the
[1:23:39] word that can make a difference. Amen.
[1:23:43] Colossians 1:27 says, "Through whom God
[1:23:46] would make known what is the riches of
[1:23:49] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:23:51] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[1:23:54] hope of glory." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:23:58] Amen. So we are in age where that is we
[1:24:01] are called to fulfill all that is
[1:24:03] written. Yes. The apostle that was
[1:24:05] written now is in us. We are the word
[1:24:08] made flesh. Amen. We're not in the
[1:24:11] written word. There was a time for the
[1:24:13] spoken word. There was the written word.
[1:24:15] But now the time for the word made
[1:24:17] flesh. Amen. She is him. Amen. She is
[1:24:22] the final voice.
[1:24:26] You know what she is? She is the success
[1:24:28] of Christ's plan. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:24:30] Amen. Amen. The greatest success for
[1:24:33] Christ is when his bride reproduced
[1:24:36] himself. Amen. when he has when he
[1:24:38] himself is being introduced to the body
[1:24:41] whom he has chosen. Amen. Cuz Christ had
[1:24:43] to choose a body where he's going to
[1:24:45] bring seed from where he's going to put
[1:24:47] his seed in. Amen. Christ had a
[1:24:50] choice and that's how he chose his bride
[1:24:52] where he chose the bride where that
[1:24:56] which bride did he choose the ones where
[1:24:58] the gene of God was in because he chose
[1:25:01] of his own that that's where I'm going
[1:25:03] to place my seed and these ones are
[1:25:07] going to reproduce my life life my life
[1:25:11] of my life word of my word amen
[1:25:14] spirit of my
[1:25:16] spirit so there must be a manifesting of
[1:25:19] the word in this hour.
[1:25:22] Amen. Romans 8:19 says, "For the earnest
[1:25:25] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:25:29] the manifestation of the sons of God."
[1:25:33] Amen. Now, you can't say there's another
[1:25:36] age that they're waiting for.
[1:25:40] It had to be in this
[1:25:42] age where sons of God
[1:25:47] now have received the word and sorry
[1:25:50] Christ being manifested now on the earth
[1:25:53] again. Sons of God being reproduced.
[1:25:55] Amen. Christ again in human flesh doing
[1:25:59] what? Doing the works that he did the
[1:26:01] greater works. Amen.
[1:26:04] So we find the age has produced a people
[1:26:07] who are the word in flesh again walking
[1:26:11] on two feet. Amen. Amen. The words that
[1:26:14] we speak Christ is speaking. Through our
[1:26:17] eyes Christ is looking through our
[1:26:19] hands. Christ is working. Through our
[1:26:22] feet God is spreading forth the gospel.
[1:26:24] Through our mouth is speaking his word.
[1:26:26] Amen. Through our hands. He's healing
[1:26:28] the sick.
[1:26:31] That's God idea of success was to
[1:26:34] reproduce Christ again. Amen. Becoming
[1:26:36] the word made
[1:26:38] flesh. So what are the things that I'm
[1:26:40] saying here this morning? We must stay
[1:26:42] in the word. We must meditate on it. We
[1:26:45] must live by it according to what Joshua
[1:26:48] 18 says. We must be led by the spirit of
[1:26:50] God.
[1:26:52] Amen. And then we must obey the word
[1:26:56] with faith, not with reasoning, not with
[1:26:59] doubts. Amen. Don't be like the
[1:27:03] fundamentalists. They knew what they
[1:27:04] knew the word, but they go and question
[1:27:06] the word. They're very word that they
[1:27:08] know they will go and question it. Amen.
[1:27:11] We must obey with faith.
[1:27:15] And we must fulfill our calling. Amen.
[1:27:17] Amen. Matthew 25:21 says, "His Lord said
[1:27:20] unto him, well done, thou good and
[1:27:23] faithful servants." Amen.
[1:27:26] Thou has been faithful over a few
[1:27:28] things. I will make thee ruler over many
[1:27:31] things. Enter thou into the joy of the
[1:27:34] Lord. God has given us these entrusted
[1:27:37] us with a sacred trust. He's placed his
[1:27:41] word upon us. He's placed talents upon
[1:27:43] us. He's positionally placed us into the
[1:27:46] body for a purpose. What are we doing
[1:27:49] with the things that he's placed upon
[1:27:50] our lives? You want to measure your
[1:27:53] success, measure the things by what are
[1:27:55] you doing with what God has placed upon
[1:27:56] you. Amen. Because seek ye first the
[1:28:00] kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[1:28:03] Amen.
[1:28:05] And also when you are if you want to
[1:28:07] sure that you are in God's way of
[1:28:09] success, you got to have eternity in
[1:28:12] view. You got to have you have to come
[1:28:14] up high and see the way God sees it. You
[1:28:17] can't just see life as the way you as
[1:28:19] every other human being sees it. I got
[1:28:21] to wake up in the morning. I got to go
[1:28:22] to work. I got to earn a living. I got
[1:28:24] to make so much money. I got to do this.
[1:28:26] I got to do that. And you just get a
[1:28:28] busy become a busy body. You're busy
[1:28:31] busy
[1:28:32] busy without taking time for
[1:28:37] God. We busy with socializing. We busy
[1:28:40] with family. We busy with friends. We
[1:28:42] busy with
[1:28:44] everything. But we wouldn't take the
[1:28:46] time to have fellowship with God.
[1:28:51] So, Philippians 3:14 says, "I press
[1:28:53] towards the mark for the price of the
[1:28:55] high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
[1:28:59] Amen. We are pressing towards the mark
[1:29:01] for the price of the high calling of God
[1:29:03] in Christ Jesus. Amen. We know we are
[1:29:05] rapture bound. We know we are people
[1:29:08] that are living this dimension. But at
[1:29:11] the same time, while we are while we
[1:29:13] know that we are living, you got to be
[1:29:15] convinced. You can't say that you are
[1:29:18] sincere Christian full with the Holy
[1:29:20] Ghost and you want to leave but you're
[1:29:22] leaving. You know the names in the book
[1:29:23] that are here. You know there are people
[1:29:25] that are in captivity. You know there
[1:29:27] are people that are bound by the devil.
[1:29:29] That is why you find that in every
[1:29:33] assembly. Amen. You you have people
[1:29:36] growing in different maturities. So if
[1:29:38] your brother is weak, lift up your
[1:29:40] brother. Amen. Don't leave your brother.
[1:29:42] Bring your brother to your level. Don't
[1:29:44] turn your don't turn a blind eye. If you
[1:29:45] see a brother doing something wrong and
[1:29:48] don't go there and rebuke him in a bad
[1:29:49] way. No, out of love because you have a
[1:29:52] concern for the brother. Try and help
[1:29:53] that brother. Try and help them in their
[1:29:56] weakness. Show you know if you are
[1:29:58] mature now in the word help them where
[1:30:01] they are weak that they will come up
[1:30:02] higher. Amen.
[1:30:05] You can't you can't be say you know what
[1:30:08] uh I'm going now. I got the I got the
[1:30:11] message of the hour. I'm going to go in
[1:30:13] the rapture and you know there's people
[1:30:14] that are lost here until all the time
[1:30:17] till we go till we leave you will always
[1:30:19] have a concern. Concerns for souls
[1:30:22] concern for those that are bound with
[1:30:24] the demon
[1:30:25] powers concern for those that are in
[1:30:28] captivity.
[1:30:30] Amen. So you'll have that is now being
[1:30:33] kingdom minded
[1:30:36] and yet not just concerned that we have
[1:30:38] a little assembly God is blessing us.
[1:30:40] God is no. You want to see the whole
[1:30:42] body. You want to see the body come into
[1:30:45] alignment. Amen. You want the body to be
[1:30:48] in his position. You want every part of
[1:30:50] the body to be together.
[1:30:58] Amen. So we got to ask ourselves this
[1:31:00] morning, am I
[1:31:03] successful in the eyes of men or in the
[1:31:06] eyes of God? Or do I want to be the type
[1:31:09] of Christian want to be a man pleaser or
[1:31:12] do I want to please my heavenly
[1:31:14] father? Have I surrendered my life to
[1:31:17] his
[1:31:18] purpose? Now it's very easy to be
[1:31:21] distracted. It's easy. You know we all
[1:31:24] go through that life sometimes journey
[1:31:26] sometimes and we can be easily
[1:31:28] distracted by things of this life the
[1:31:31] cares of this
[1:31:32] life and we want to try and achieve
[1:31:34] things to help us get by in his life but
[1:31:38] have we surrendered completely to his
[1:31:42] purpose am I doing what the word of this
[1:31:46] age requires me to
[1:31:47] do amen so God doesn't judge success by
[1:31:51] crowds or buildings He judges it by
[1:31:54] obedience to his word.
[1:31:57] Amen.
[1:32:00] So, you know, in God's kingdom, he
[1:32:02] doesn't reward ambition. You know, Satan
[1:32:05] was ambitious. Yes.
[1:32:08] But God will reward obedience. Jesus was
[1:32:11] obedient unto death. Amen. Jesus showed
[1:32:14] the opposite. The contrast to Satan.
[1:32:16] Amen.
[1:32:17] And he will show it with fa and he'll
[1:32:19] also reward faithfulness
[1:32:22] and identification with yourself in the
[1:32:23] word. Amen.
[1:32:26] So he's not how much you have but how
[1:32:27] much of Christ lives in you. How much
[1:32:30] have you let out of yourself? The more
[1:32:33] of Christ in you, the more humble you
[1:32:35] become. Not the more puffed up you
[1:32:37] become. Humble yourself, you walk in
[1:32:40] humility. And when you have more of the
[1:32:42] word, you will know how to handle a
[1:32:44] matter better. Amen.
[1:32:48] So just some some of the things the
[1:32:49] prophet says he
[1:32:53] said just what I've seen in my own
[1:32:56] ministry seen him done you couldn't pile
[1:32:59] the volumes on this platform here if I
[1:33:01] wrote it in details what I've seen him
[1:33:02] do just in my own ministry seen him do
[1:33:05] it he had more success in my ministry
[1:33:08] than he did in his own that is right
[1:33:12] that is recording now remember he had
[1:33:15] more success Now, not me. He had
[1:33:19] if you watch the wording here. Glory.
[1:33:22] Hallelujah. He had more success in
[1:33:25] Jeffersonville than he did in
[1:33:28] Nazareth. He did in that wicked city and
[1:33:31] the w this wicked city. Amen. Glory. Cuz
[1:33:33] he could perform no miracles there. But
[1:33:36] he did. Yeah. He finally broke through.
[1:33:39] Yeah. He got it done. Yeah. He might
[1:33:42] have had to get people somewhere else,
[1:33:44] but he got it done. Anyhow,
[1:33:46] so he had more success right here than
[1:33:48] he did in Capernium or Nazareth in the
[1:33:51] in that. He done more miracles right
[1:33:53] here in this tabernacle than he did in
[1:33:56] the entire ministry on earth. That's
[1:33:58] right. He did it. Now what about the
[1:34:01] rest of the world?
[1:34:04] Now what's he done? Now remember he's
[1:34:06] done. Now he never said I done it. See
[1:34:09] no cause I didn't do it. I just didn't.
[1:34:12] I just loved him and just submitted
[1:34:14] myself to him. He's giving the secrets
[1:34:15] now and said what he said and the Holy
[1:34:18] Spirit went to the other people and they
[1:34:21] believe what he said and then he done
[1:34:24] the work. That's all. If I can get all
[1:34:27] of us believing it, what would he do
[1:34:31] right
[1:34:31] now? If he could get all of us believing
[1:34:34] it right now, there wouldn't be there
[1:34:37] wouldn't be a feeble person around the
[1:34:39] town. That's right. If he could get
[1:34:41] everybody to believe it, it'll all be
[1:34:43] over. Hold your token over your
[1:34:46] unmovable faith in his promised word and
[1:34:50] Satan will go.
[1:34:52] Amen. He said, "But I'll say tonight in
[1:34:55] the message, go away Jesus." He said,
[1:34:57] "But I'll say tonight that I seen him.
[1:35:01] He's had more success in my life, in my
[1:35:03] little efforts than I put forth." Now
[1:35:05] remember he has had more success than
[1:35:08] the efforts that I have put forth for
[1:35:09] him by his gospel than he did in my in
[1:35:13] his own country where he came from. I
[1:35:15] would write Bibles to know what he has
[1:35:18] done in these last days because he
[1:35:20] promised that these things that I do
[1:35:22] shall you do and more than these you
[1:35:25] shall do. He says greater which is the
[1:35:28] right word there is no one could do
[1:35:30] greater. He's done everything that could
[1:35:31] be done. See, raise the dead, stop
[1:35:33] nature and everything else. But more
[1:35:35] than this shall you do. For the spirit
[1:35:38] that dwelleth in one person, the son of
[1:35:40] God, now sons of
[1:35:42] God are over the world. Amen. I would
[1:35:47] say this is in present tense. Now sons
[1:35:49] of God are being manifested all over the
[1:35:52] world. He said, "Now more than this
[1:35:56] shall you do because I go to the
[1:35:58] father." Yes. See back the Holy Ghost
[1:36:03] upon the church. So this is our where
[1:36:06] sons of God are manifested on the earth.
[1:36:09] And this is our of him doing the greater
[1:36:11] works. And the final part to show that
[1:36:14] we had a successful ministry is when we
[1:36:16] have completed the cause and we have
[1:36:19] this body change and we leave the earth.
[1:36:21] Amen. I pray God bless you this morning.
[1:36:24] Could I have the musicians? Amen.
[1:36:30] The message came in this last stage to
[1:36:35] prepare a
[1:36:37] bride to walk with him and talk with him
[1:36:42] and it is worth.
[1:36:46] It's written in the spoken word and it's
[1:36:51] laying
[1:36:52] there to bring us into rapturing grace
[1:36:57] and take us out of you. Sing it now.
[1:37:03] Overcoming power is what we have
[1:37:09] today.
[1:37:11] Overcoming power keep the devil
[1:37:17] away.
[1:37:19] Oh power till we become the
[1:37:23] word. That's when we leave this love and
[1:37:29] go and meet the Lord and sing now. Our
[1:37:33] Moses has already come. He has been
[1:37:40] away. He brought us to the
[1:37:43] Jordan and he was taken
[1:37:47] away. But Joshua is preparing now to
[1:37:52] sound out his
[1:37:55] command to gather all the saints of God
[1:38:00] to enter the promised land. Let's sing
[1:38:03] it
[1:38:04] now.
[1:38:06] Overcoming power is what we have
[1:38:12] today.
[1:38:14] Overcoming power to keep the devil
[1:38:20] away.
[1:38:22] Overcoming power to become the word.
[1:38:28] That's when we leave this in further. I
[1:38:32] know I need the
[1:38:34] Lord. Well, that's when we leave this
[1:38:38] for I know I need the
[1:38:43] Lord. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:38:47] Amen. God is measuring our success.
[1:38:49] Amen.
[1:38:51] Hallelujah. God is measuring our success
[1:38:54] by what we have done with the word.
[1:38:55] Amen. Amen. Are we allowing the word to
[1:38:58] have its full effect in our lives? Amen.
[1:39:01] How does God measure faithfulness by
[1:39:04] what we have done with promise? And when
[1:39:06] we have done with promise is multiply
[1:39:09] it, then he says, "Well done, my good
[1:39:11] and faithful servant. Enter thou into
[1:39:14] the joy of the Lord." So God is looking
[1:39:16] for multiplication of his word. Amen.
[1:39:19] Amen. God is not looking for Amen. just
[1:39:21] a one-on-one return. He's looking for
[1:39:24] multiplication.
[1:39:25] You must bring forth much fruit. Amen.
[1:39:28] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:39:30] Jesus. Amen. Even as the word of God has
[1:39:34] come forth, examine our hearts and see.
[1:39:37] Amen. Are we
[1:39:38] really allowing the word of
[1:39:42] God to have full effect in our
[1:39:45] lives? Amen. And and if we have reached
[1:39:48] a certain level, say, "Lord, give me
[1:39:50] more." Amen. I want more, Lord Jesus.
[1:39:53] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:39:56] Let's see more of you. More of you. I've
[1:39:58] had it all, but what I need is more of
[1:40:01] you. Of things I've had might fail, yet
[1:40:05] I hunger still. Amen. Don't only strive
[1:40:07] for the natural. Don't strive for cars
[1:40:10] and houses and money and
[1:40:12] land. Strive for the eternal things that
[1:40:15] matter. Amen. Strive that you may enter
[1:40:18] into Jesus. Amen.

[1:40:35] all. I've had it

[1:41:32] More of
[1:41:36] you. I've had it
[1:41:39] all. I've had it
[1:41:43] all. But what I
[1:41:46] need is more. for all of
[1:41:52] you. Things I've had, my feel. All
[1:41:56] things I've
[1:41:58] had, my
[1:42:02] fear. But
[1:42:04] yet I
[1:42:06] hunger
[1:42:09] still, so empty and
[1:42:14] bare. Lord, hear my prayer.
[1:42:19] for
[1:42:19] more of
[1:42:21] you. Amen. Can we just worship the Lord
[1:42:24] and give him praise? Amen. Say, "Lord, I
[1:42:26] need more of you in my life, oh God."
[1:42:28] Father, Lord, I pray you'll take what
[1:42:30] you've given me, Lord, and multiply it
[1:42:32] in my life, oh God. The word that you've

[1:42:55] you'll be well pleased, oh God. I pray,
[1:42:58] Lord, that you do work in our lives, oh
[1:43:00] God, as an individual, Lord Jesus, you

[1:44:48] virtue will flow through her body. Oh

[1:44:52] whole. I pray every chest pain will be
[1:44:54] gone. Lord, if there's any blocked
[1:44:56] arteries, I pray, Lord, they will clear
[1:44:57] the way, oh God, and oxygen, nutrient,
[1:45:00] blood will flow through that, Lord,
[1:45:01] veins, Lord, and through our arteries,
[1:45:03] Lord Jesus, taking, Lord, oxygen to our
[1:45:05] brain, oh God. And I pray, Lord, Father,
[1:45:08] shall be made every with whole. We
[1:45:10] declare 1 Peter 2:24 that you'll bore
[1:45:12] our sins on the cross in your own body,
[1:45:14] Father. And Lord, we live in your
[1:45:16] righteousness, oh God, by whose stripes
[1:45:18] we were healed, oh God. We also pray
[1:45:20] Lord Jesus for sister Jri and her family
[1:45:22] Lord taken up from the flu oh God. I
[1:45:25] pray Lord that your healing virtues will

[1:45:28] every virus Lord thankful to the body. I
[1:45:31] pray you'll bring them Lord a healing in
[1:45:33] the mighty name of Jesus. Oh God, we
[1:45:35] pray Lord that those that couldn't find
[1:45:36] themselves in the service, Lord, through
[1:45:38] the deception of the enemy, oh God,
[1:45:40] circumstances coming in their lives, oh
[1:45:42] God, that they couldn't be found in
[1:45:43] church. I pray Lord you'll bring

[1:45:47] power to them, Lord Jesus. And I pray,
[1:45:49] Lord, for brother Sam and his family,
[1:45:51] brother Caleb, and Lord that will travel

[1:45:59] Father, I pray you'll keep us faithful,
[1:46:01] Lord Jesus. Keep us true to your word,
[1:46:03] oh God. Father Lord, I pray Lord you
[1:46:05] will find full expression through our
[1:46:06] body right now. We pray forgive us our
[1:46:09] wrongs, our failures. Forgive us where
[1:46:10] we faulted you, Lord, where we've let
[1:46:12] you down, oh God. I pray, Lord, we will
[1:46:15] pick ourselves up and stand again, oh
[1:46:17] God. I pray, Lord, we will gather
[1:46:18] ourselves, Lord, and recognize we are
[1:46:20] sons and daughters of the most high,
[1:46:22] God, and we are representing the
[1:46:23] father's kingdom on the earth, oh God. I
[1:46:26] pray, Lord, for every son and daughter
[1:46:27] that's gathered in your presence. I pray
[1:46:29] you'll meet with their need, Lord. I
[1:46:31] pray, Lord Jesus. Father, each need
[1:46:33] differs, oh God. But I pray, oh God,
[1:46:35] that you will specialize, oh God, in the
[1:46:37] individual need, oh God, and meet them
[1:46:39] at the point of their need. We also
[1:46:41] bring the abend you, Lord. Lord, unwell
[1:46:44] in body, but I pray, Lord, that you will
[1:46:46] touch him, you will heal him, you will
[1:46:47] deliver him, oh God. And father, I pray,
[1:46:50] Lord, that the angel of God will touch
[1:46:51] him, oh God. Make him everyone whole, oh
[1:46:53] God, and be found back in the house of
[1:46:55] the Lord, Father, giving you praise,
[1:46:57] giving you glory, and giving you honor,
[1:46:59] Father. We believe you for all things.
