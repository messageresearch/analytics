worthy to be praised this morning hallelujah amen we serve a good God Amen he's given us his word he's given us his truth amen and most of all he placed within us a c Gene amen that's why we can believe this word amen praise the Lord amen so this morning we're going to look into the word of God Amen we'll turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 13 so it's been a while I wanted to speak on this thought amen but I've been building up to this point amen we've always been talking about the eye dimensions of the Holy Ghost amen this morning I want to speak on a three-dimensional being talking about ourselves now a three-dimensional being faith hope and charity which is the essence of love amen this is the god man we are talking about amen not a man operating by faith alone but we are three-dimensional being operating with faith hope and charity amen 1 Corinthians chapter 13 praise the Lord we'll read from uh verse 13 there and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity amen we know the prophet of God says that word means love amen so now abide at faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise the Lord amen amen before we get into the sermon I just want to make some comments amen that there's nothing in your life or in our lives or in the world that will happen or that we can face or go through that will take God by surprise amen God is the designer of Our Lives amen God says that I know the plans I have for you amen so we may be taken by surprise that circumstances and events that are transpiring around us and what's happening in our lives but nothing takes God by [Music] surprise amen he knows the end from the beginning and I'm glad I serve a God Like That amen so when when I'm praying to him for an answer he already knows the end result praise the Lord so if my prayer is not in line with the end result is going to make me come into His will and his plan and purpose to achieve the end result that he wants to have for us amen so we find here amen even in the natural the prophet says if you want to know what time of day it is you look at a normal watch if you want to look at the prophetic eye and see prophecies through Through The Eyes Of God he says you watch Israel how many of you have read that Israel is God's time piece the prophet of God says and the prophet uh the Bible says that when you see the fctory start to put forth its but amen now I want you to know Israel is not putting forth buds at the moment buds started there in 1948 right amen she's now mature country that's right a mature Army amen that is not afraid yes amen if you know something about Israel they are fearless that's right amen and the body of Jesus Christ is a Fearless Army we've got to drive out all doubt and fear now come on amen amen can you imagine Israel she's surrounded by Arab Nations yeah do you think she can operate by fear but if you watch her attack she's fearless so we find the seven front war of Israel I'll just tell you what the prime minister of Israel said they are fighting against amas in Gaza esbah in Lebanon the uis in Yemen the shiat milita in Iraq and Syria the terrorists in Judea and Samaria and Iran now why Iran is important he goes on to say that Iran is be the seventh front war against Israel and who is Iran Iran is Persia am if you go and Google it you'll see that Iran is called the Islamic Republic of Iran but they are also known as Persia and if you go to Daniel 10:12 you'll see here then he said to me fear not Daniel for from the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words but the prince of the kingdom of Persia with stod me one and 12 days but L Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Persia amen so who is that demon powers demon powers had got into the King of Persia right amen if you read Isaiah 14 you'll see demon powers in another king Hallelujah so we know that the countries of this world some of you are looking very at least say an amen at least I know you're alive amen praise the Lord demon powers have possessed the kings of the Earth right amen they are operating through the kings of the earth amen hallelujah so amen even as we look into the word this morning we want to be that Fearless Army amen that army that is Invincible we know the prophet didn't say things amen just to prophesy fancy words amen but when he said she'll be an invincible Army that means we are an invincible Army so we're looking at this morning if you can put up you're having problems with your amen we're going to read statue of a perfect man amen if you can get the screen fixed statue of a perfect man will go to paragraph 354 I want to get this as a basis and I'm not going to try and Rush the sermon because if we complete the sermon today you probably will go home and have supper amen praise the Lord so we just want to try and lay some foundational truths here regarding amen what we are speaking about amen amen so remember at the end of the service I want you to understand that we are preaching that you can't exist in this world with faith alone that's what we are saying right we're going to read First Corinthians chapter 13 again and show you that the man operating with faith to move mountains can be nothing that's First Corinthians say that though I afraid to move mountains I am nothing right so afraid to move mountains Mark 11:23 alone you can't operate with faith alone to operate in that Dimension there's got to be a high power so that's why I'm preaching a three-dimensional being faith hope charity which is the essence of love amen are you still having problems what did you get hey it's it's working so then put up statue of a perfect man paragraph 354 amen praise the Lord hallelujah I'm just waiting for him to get to that paragraph because I want you to follow what the prophet is saying here amen praise the Lord so he says in every in each age God has placed these things talking about these things talking about a statue of a perfect man right the faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity so he has placed these things into the church and patented it by showing that each individual has these amen right so you can't be an individual who doesn't possess the things right and this being when it's completed is the Church of God going to Rapture amen so a man who has all of these virtues is the man that God is going to Rapture and this being and completed is a servant of God amen amen praise the Lord in the church so now he's not talking only about the church he's talking about the individual becomes a servant in the Church of God right I see Satan is giving you hard time here Glory see what I mean there you are there's the full thing is that your cable or is it uh amen praise the Lord so let's just go down to the next one there I want to complete this before I go on he says here coming man Paul laying a foundation I began to pour in onto it the next one poured this now I don't if you know what I said how does how is fullness measured by overflow so they couldn't have ped halfway Paul had to fill Faith to it brim then IR could fill in poured in the next one poured this next one poured that and that and on down till it comes to the last agage but what it is it is the same spirit amen The Same Spirit that dwells in me says hands reach after that case the same spirit says feet make a step see what I mean then the whole stature of your being is governed and controlled by these things but it cannot be completely controlled till it completely possesses these qualities I me if you understand what he's saying the Holy Ghost can't fully control you unless you possess all of these qualities amen hallelujah so if we are talking about getting into higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost we've got to be certain that all of these qualities exist in us to be controlled by the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord amen amen we'll come back to that now praise the Lord is it all your things or is it just one you can go to my notes amen you can go to my notes there praise the Lord praise the Lord let's get to that first uh in faith is a substance the prophet says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen let's take that part of the scripture the substance of things hope for there's three things hope charity and faith is that right hope is one Element faith is another element and charity is is another element charity is love I've seen many people come by lovely people real Christians but didn't have enough Faith to be healed and some sinner passed by and has the faith to be healed see it's another element all together now don't miss that faith is a powerful Dimension amen but he says the charity love is another element all together it's not how well you serve God it's an element can we close the door amen it's an element that you possess Yourself Praise the Lord amen amen it's an element you possess yourself yes amen amen now I want you to see this because it's for your benefit so the prophet is splitting these things now I want you to also understand that hope is very important most people discredit hope but the Bible says there are three things how many if you read it 1 Corinthians 13:13 there is faith hope and charity but the greatest of these is Charity now what is hope faith is a substance of things hope for meaning if there was no hope there Faith can't have a work so hope is your desire hope is your desire for the things of God hope is your desire for healing based on the word of God but Faith goes into action and it puts it amen into Play Amen hope is looking for it coming In A Time Amen in the future the prophet says and he says sometimes if you don't be careful you can operate in the element of Hope alone thinking it's Faith right he says but when faith comes along it gets a hold of your desire and it says that it's already received amen amen so the promise that was given the hope that was given to Abraham is you're going to have a son but Abraham's Faith made him see beyond the physical that he couldn't have a child so he took the Hope yes amen amen let's put Hope Chest there Amen in your message search you can search hope chest and just search it for a specific word not a broad search amen praise the Lord while we on amen if the spirit is bringing this let's bring this out amen hallelujah praise the Lord so here's Abraham he has this Faith amen his faith is based on what God's word told him that he's going to have a son praise the Lord he says thank God we'll have it go ahead make their little booties and get the little jacket ready get all the bird eyeon pins CU we're going to have it that's right I'm expecting it that's right put them in your Hope Chest get ready cuz it's going to cuz it's coming amen yes Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord so faith has got to have a basis to work and the Bible says in Hebrews 11 faith is the substance of things hoped for yes amen I gave you this example before and they say this morning again if you desire that's your hope now to build this ppit right you need raw material to build this ppit so Faith becomes your raw material aterial your raw material to build a ppit is wood okay but in your heart you desire you have this hope to build a ppit but you need the raw material which is f to make the pulpit the same way anything you desire in your heart the hope you have in your heart it requires Faith to bring it into this Dimension amenu Faith makes it happen praise the Lord yes amen is everybody understanding that because there must be faith hope and charity if you are a hopeless person then you'll be a bum on the street that's a person without hope with no ambition no goal amen hallelujah so I'm saying build your Hope on things Eternal we sing that song amen amen didn't Paul say Christ in me the hope of glory I'm just trying to kill that thing where people just want to credit hope hope as long as it's a god-given desire Christ the hope of glory faith can push it to another level and bring it to pass amen hallelujah so the next p i want to show you this now where we getting this thought from and the prophet says watch this is now in the message you swore by himself amen the next one there he says watch three everything in the Bible is a three three blends to a one see father son Holy Spirit not three Gods right we understand that he says one watch he takes the next part now he says faith hope charity not three different things but all the essence of one amen [Music] love amen so we can't be saying amen that we are operating as an individual unit just based on faith or just on Hope or just on love you can have love and no faith praise the Lord you can have faith and no love praise the Lord you can have faith based on no hope so your faith is based on nothing but he says these three function is one unit and it's the essence of one love that is why I titled it amen that a three-dimensional being Faith open charity is the essence of Love Hallelujah you know what the essence is it's the being amen it's what what it consist of the essence amen praise the Lord and and if you remember a few weeks ago maybe even a month or so ago I asked you if you reach perfect faith is that it how many of you remember me asking you and I asked you to say can there be an enlargement past that perfect Faith because love is in a higher dimension yes amen because faith is at the foundation but love comes at the Capstone and I want to show you that that love is not from the earth the capping stone is not from the earth amen praise the Lord love is a higher Dimension than Faith so which means that love is the god Dimension coming to the Earth love is the god Dimension coming upon each and every one of us so when we say we love somebody when the god Kind of Love Comes upon us it is not talking about fil Your Love have I have an affection for brother rames so I love him no I I'm talking about a guppy love that whether he loves me back or not I love him whether he does bad to me or not I love him amen than you Lord so love is not based on conditions sir I'm talking about God's kind of love our human love is maybe if you love me I'll love you back if you scratch my back I'll Str your back but the god Kind of Love is totally different amen yes amen so when we are talking about Frontiers opening up to us spiritual Frontiers opening up to us we were talking about a territory that we need to possess which is love which is Charity it's a territory that needs to be opened up to us because it'll change our lives in the way we we are as Christians amen there there's a frontier we need to open up and when we're talking about the opening up of spiritual Frontiers let us say this morning Lord open to us the frontier of love amen open to us the frontier of Charity hallelujah praise the Lord let's enlarge our borders past Faith am because some of us have had Faith where we've done incredible things we've had Faith to move mountains amen can you say amen amen praise the Lord now you notice that most time when the sermon is preached people don't go past Brotherly Love they talk about the coming down of Charity as a future event Hallelujah they just talk about brotherly love being here in the latan church age but I want you to know without that final step that man is not complete right and if you read the quote we said he said all of these virtues need to be in us to go in the Rapture am amen hallelujah amen so it doesn't come after the Rapture it's got to come before the Rapture amen and I'm saying Satan's deception will be to make you think it's a future thing coming when the thing has already come and you don't know it I'm saying if we don't know it his deception will be to keep us looking at a thing coming praise the Lord so when we are talking about brotherly love we are talking about the Philadelphia Corridor because Philadelphia means brotherly love everybody agree you read The Prophet's message Philadelphia means brotherly love it's a Greek word so we are talking about that Philadelphia Corridor so how are we going to attain and how are we going to get God's dimension of love come down upon us there's got to be a corridor that leads us to this amen amen and it's the Philadelphia Corridor because Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another amen so in order for you to reach that God love Dimension brotherly love there's got to be a bridge to move you past brotherly love and go on to meet agape love I'm trying to break it down amen that we can understand this we can't be stuck in brotherly love because your Brotherly Love still makes you not forgive your brother brotherly love seems to be amen people can't fellowship with one another yet we say we have Brotherly Love now let me ask you to In This Way in every age every virtue the prophet says every age they poured it into it right so Paul would have poured Faith the apostles Faith irus would have poured the next virtue everybody understand amen was it their strength was it their strength or was it exposing their weakness Faith was their strength virtue was their strength right each age that was their strength amen so how can it be that in the age of the latest year and church age brotherly love is not the strength that it's hard for people to fellowship with one another I say we tear down walls I say Amen that God didn't come to build a message Church the message of the hour came to build up the body of Christ and we need to start separating from church names Church IDE ideologies I'm talking about within the framework of the message we've got to be one Army one body amen rising up in this hour we can't be amen isolated Behind the Walls of our church name amen God has called a body of Christ in this hour brother Brandon would have been so against it amen Amen to see the barriers and the denominations we have built around ourselves amen we have one message with one Prophet amen with one Divine interpretation so there can't be so many different men of God saying I see this way I see it that way amen these men of God need to come back to the Altar and see it God's way you can't tell me you had one Prophet with one Revelation and you see it all different ways something is wrong and I told you again amen don't come to me with your elephant the oh I'm feeling the trunk I'm feeling the leg I'm feeling the tail I'm feeling the ears I thought we had the full opening of the word you're supposed to be seeing the full elephant why you seeing the trunk only which means the opening of the word hasn't been open to you somebody say Amen if you're seeing the trunk only something wrong need to come up high your bird's eye view you'll see the whole elephant praise the Lord amen so we are moving in this place called a Philadelphia Corridor and that's why it's a corridor we got to protect Brotherly Love which means you can't listen to something about your brother or sister if we are saying we are protecting that border we can't listen to gossip yes amen we can't be listening to things that are tearing down people amen if we are going to protect the border the moment those things arise we pray about it and you tell the person carrying that tail that we are praying about it this is not the hour to tear down and pull down people hallelujah oh yes yes if we are really serious about the God Dimension charity coming down upon us amen we've got to walk this Philadelphia Corridor that leads us to a gape love the corridor and the passageway must be projected why in the natural the Philadelphia corridor in Israel is protecting them from taking the hostages back to Egypt we know Egypt types the world so the corridor becomes an important section that we've got to protect it to keep spiritual captives from going back into the world if we demonize and we speak bad against our own Brothers amen we can kill their spirit and influence amen that they want to backslide and get back into the world demon powers can take them captive our job is to release the captives amen praise the Lord than so we we find that faith we know is a God's substance we are not talking about your natural faith in things the Apostle Paul in Galatians 220 amen if you can put it up let's read it Hallelujah Galatians 2 and2 if we read the Scripture it says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me that's the kind of Glory we're talking about amen when he's when he's living in you and the glory is being seen through you then you become the banner that is raised in this hour you become n that is raised in this hour amen and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by my own faith who's reading this I live by the faith of the Son of God so if we're crucified with him which means we were perfected in him which means we were our Holiness is found in him which means our righteousness is found in him which means we operate by his faith it's not our human faith it's not me trying to work up my faith because a pure perfect word of God has come down I don't know if you can agree to that we have the message of the hour a pure perfect word and Faith cometh by the hearing of the word so if we are listening to a pure perfect word we've got to have a pure perfect Faith amen the faith I want brother Jeff to be a amen because you'll enjoy the sermon praise the Lord the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me you know the prophet of God says it this way we got it in the quot somewh but I'm just going to paraphrase now he says when I saw what Jesus Christ did for me Jesus Christ conquered my heart and because he conquered my heart he took away all fear so I don't have to doubt his word I can rest upon his word that every promise in that book will come to pass so I approach every situation with that that it must come to pass all fear is taken away because I'm conquered by God's love another reading of Psalms 23 it says though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil it's another version when they say he says I fear no evil because I am already conquered if you have already been conquered how can some else conquer you amen praise the Lord let me say it this way when when a mother is to conceive if seed has already taken conception that whom he sealed praise the Lord so means nothing else can come there the same way amen he's saying yeah that I am already conquered by the love of Jesus Christ so Satan's fear can't conquer me so though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I've already been conquered by Jesus Christ and nothing else can conquer me okay let me say it another way if Satan wants to conquer you he must conquer Jesus Christ because Jesus has conquered you which means you are not your own you belong to Jesus so for in order to Satan to conquer you he must conquer Jesus and he can never conquer Jesus I've already been conquered by Jesus I'm already taken a prisoner by Jesus so Satan can't have me praise the Lord so Faith gives us access we just showed you here now that the faith that we're operating is not our own faith that's the faith of Mark 11:23 praise the Lord when it says there in Mark 11 have the faith of God yes so we seeing that the access to Agape Love the agape love of Jesus is by the Holy Ghost right faith hope and charity the greatest of this is Charity so if I can say this way the prophet says perfect love will give you perfect Faith amen he says perfect love produces perfect Faith Hallelujah you know he goes on and he illustrates he says if I have perfect love for my wife when I'm going away I don't have to give her instruction listen here you Mrs genen when I'm gone don't you look at any other man don't be flirting around with any other man he says my love for her will give me confidence in her already that's why I married her that I don't have to now have this fear that now that I'm gone away she's going to be looking after other men praise the Lord he says what does that is perfect perfect love perfect love produces that Faith hallelujah amen so if I can say it this way that fa faith without love makes you nothing amen let's read it in the Bible 1 Corinthians chapter 13 [Music] let's read from the first maybe some of the younger ones maybe never read this before or maybe you haven't read in a long time let's read it though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol so that is now operating a prophetic gift I'm trying to break it down for you now you can operate a prophetic gift speaking in tongues all right but not charity he says you become a sounding brass tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries I'm say we understand all Mysteries we come into the message of the hour we understand all Mysteries because Revelation 10:7 said the mystery of God will be finished so that does that put us in this category now as well Revelation 10:11 does he say we must prophesy again so that is this putting us in this category don't be afraid to be put in this category now amen because I'm going to show you that when it is activated it actually puts it on Amen it brings a super anointing upon you so this is now our category we have the gift of Prophecy and understand all mystery and all knowledge and though I have all Faith the Mark 11:23 men so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing so you can have faith without that and be nothing is that what the scripture is saying you can have these things and be nothing you can go on to read the rest I'm not dwelling on those points now I'm just dwelling on this one point so perfect faith so how do I have the faith of God is that love when I have a gape love when the Capstone comes upon my faith perfect faith it puts faith on steroids if I can say it that way amen it puts faith on steroids it brings down a super anointing hallelujah amen the Propet of God was walking through a field one day and he was going to pray for somebody and as he was walking along the field he saw this bull and you know how he dramatizes it that this was a killer bull now he had Faith oh yes first his human Faith went to his gun then he realized he left it in the car amen right then he says that something amen now something must happen because he's in the field he says this bull comes charging towards him so I'm showing you that he's trying to show us that faith alone wouldn't have done it in order for him to operate as the Adam man is what we want to operate as as an adopted son something else a super love to come upon him I'm trying to show you that love put his faith on steroids amen sorry for the lack of lack of a better word I'm trying to find a better word than that if you find a better word tell me amen praise the Lord so he's walking through this field this bull come charging at him and he says that he spoke to this bull now this is a Mark 11:23 man but he spoke with love amen he didn't say you demon beast but he didn't call that Satan we blame everything on Satan that was a bull you know he said I spoke to the bull and he spoke to that bull with love now he says now most of us you'll know what I'm talking about when the dog is coming after you you're not speaking to that dog in love you got fear inside you know that fear dog please say there's fear in you how many of you felt that fear you're fearful now that's wasn't it wasn't operating like that he says when he spoke all fear was gone he spoke in love to the bull and he says I'm sorry this is your territory I came and Disturbed you I didn't mean to do that I was going to pray for somebody he says that bull stopped within 5T of him what he says what did it was love his love accompanied by his faith now remember if he didn't have faith he wouldn't have spoken to the bull he would have thought it's worthless to speak to the bull so that showed you his faith to speak but he said love Cast Away all fear amen amen praise the Lord amen so so love puts faith on steroids or maybe I can say it this way love turns Faith Supernatural love makes your faith Supernatural which means you're a natural being but there's a supernatural element comes inside of you which means you no longer walk by faith or sorry you no longer walk by sight you no longer walk after the flesh but you walk after the spirit you're walking after Faith amen amen praise the Lord we're going very slow amen I'm still on my first page here praise the Lord amen but I'm trying to bring it where everybody understands it even the young ones that when you are speaking by faith if you want to operate as a son and daughter of God fear must be removed that is why I've been getting you to pray before you start praying I reject all anxiety fear doubt Satan I reject your fear your doubt I cast it out of me clear the way now the channel for the Holy Spirit to move you start to make these confessions praise the Lord because remember you have the legal authority over your own body praise the Lord so so Faith now needs to operate through love praise the Lord is everybody getting that point your faith needs to operate through love praise praise the Lord amen so in everything that you are facing now in life coming for going forward let it be accompanied by love yes amen maybe you haven't considered that before but if you if you are praying for the sick don't just pray based on a certain idea that you have the prophet says that when you step into the shoe and you have compassion for that person amen you're praying out of love for this person amen Lord this is my brother in the body of Christ and Lord as one member in the body If It suffers oh God the entire body suffers and Lord I love my brother Lord Jesus and I'm praying now based upon your word that these signs shall follow them that believe if I lay hands upon the sick they shall recover Lord Jesus and Lord your word declares that by the stripes of Jesus they are healed oh God hallelujah you can you can pray with love your faith can be boosted by love amen now that wasn't the only time you know the prophet spoke to killer bees the bees also came after him and his faith didn't he didn't just speak the word you be go back to where you came from he attributed to the love spirit that came over [Music] him what does he attribute it to the love spirit that came over him he attributed it to that he doesn't say look at what great faith I have he said it was love he says when that man came that 200 lb man came there on the stage and he and he was hitting other preachers and other men were fearful of him even the policemen were scared of him brother Joshua shared an encounter where he experienced one of these guys demon possessed men and he was telling the prophet I'm going to break every bone in your body the prophet of God stood there with faith in his heart and compassion fell over him and he spoke to this man and he said you're going to bow at my feet and he said me bow at your feet and there he was down at the prophet's feet what will do it love because you can't be 40 years in the message now and not have been built up in faith Hallelujah so surely your faith must be built up you must have some Measure of Faith but I'm showing you that you can equip it with love to get the results that's required the Propet of God also encountering a vulgar situation where this young man and this young girl were sitting in the front row they had come there to tempt the spirit of God and they started to kiss one another and hold one another and they were so vulgar and the prophet of God would tell them don't do that don't do that and they wouldn't listen to him and he could have spoken a word of condemnation and death to them but he says a L's Spirit came over him and the spirit reminded him that this is a test and he turned to them and he says I forgive you yes they were sitting in the presence of the sh glory of God and love came down and [Music] forgave what what do you think was there at the boat when the prophet and the the fish guts was lying all over the place and he says little fishy I give you back your life [Music] amen amen praise the Lord I want you to know when Jesus came on the earth he didn't only come to reflect God on the Earth but he came to show you the type of man you were supposed to be he's called the second Adam yes so when you're reading anything about Jesus you must be able to see that that's supposed to be you you are supposed to be healing the blind man you are supposed to be the withed man's hand you were supposed to be healing the crippled you were supposed Jesus said Greater Works than these shall he do so Jesus didn't come to show you that I am far removed from all of you and you can't touch me and you can't do what I'm doing he came to show you as I do these things The Father loves you amen and I have come to pay the price for your Redemption that when you are fully redeemed and my blood is on that cross and my blood is is is accepted by the father and my sacrifice is accepted I am the man who can go and take back your title deed in Revelation 5 but I'm not a selfish person I'm going to bring it down back to you because Greater Love at no man than he that would lay down his life for his friends and Jesus Christ was not a selfish person the Bible says God so loved the world God conquers the world through love amen people want to try and Conquer through fear people want to try and Conquer through Atomic missiles and warfare but God conquers the world through love amen so in our situations that we will encounter and face can we approach it with love amen am can we conquer every situation with love amen when when the husband says something that's not convenient to your ears you're not used to it can you approach it with love out of rather than anger can you do the same thing when your wife says something back to you and you can you approach it with love rather than anger so the prophet of God you know amen so many times he would bring this example there was a woman sitting there she he says that a top was exposed her shoulders and all of these things and he gave her his coat what did that love sister be respectful in the house of God just cover yourself she took that coat and she flung it she rejected love right and he says if this is what you call religion I don't even want it for my pet cow and you know what happened to her she ended up on a dead bed crying out for the man of God so the prophet was projecting love amen what does the prophet preach a message when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes over what happened to that woman amen I'm not even in my message right now but what happened to that woman that was dragged there caught in the very Act of adultery caught in the very Act of adultery you can be caught in the very Act of drinking smoking you can be caught in the very Act of Amen committing sin fornication pornography caught in the very act but the grace of Jesus is here this morning amen amen yes you are dragged before Jesus this morning and what did Jesus do Jesus loved her and he wrote something in the [Music] sand and the Bible says that he asked those men that were standing there with rocks in their hand ready to Stone her okay yall can Stone her but I want the first person that's without sin to [Music] start amen they started to drop their Stones they all started to drop their stones and Jesus said women where are thine accusers the head must have been down in the sand she looks around she sees no man but Jesus am oh thank you Lord he says neither do I condemn you am go and sin no more thank you the same Grace is being extended to you this morning thank you Lord whatever you are doing in your life whatever situation you are caught up in you are coming before the throne room of Jesus right now you are caught up into his presence right now amen because we are seated together in Heavenly places and I ask you where are thine accusers amen Satan th adversary who has accused you of sin Jesus Christ blood has covered you from all sin but you've got to accept it you've got to accept his free will thank you Lord you've got to accept his grace and his pardon amen amen praise the Lord thank amen so we said faith is believing something before it happens faith is based on the promise of God's word now we know what faith is and I'm going to say it like this Faith requires something in return put up Hebrews 11 Faith doesn't work independently Faith requires a return I don't if you know that Faith requires that whatever it's believing in it must come to pass so Faith requires something in return it says your faith is a substance of things hopeful the evidence of Things Not Seen we know further down in this chapter it says without faith it's impossible to please God right now Faith is the substance of things hoped for so faith can only work with whatever desire is in your heart so if you have the desire of God's word for healing faith can only take that what you hope in your heart the scripture the desire in your heart and it becomes the substance amen amen am Romans [Music] 4:17 amen we won't be much longer we're going to close now because I like I said I'm laying a foundation for something and I don't want you to miss amen the Simplicity of it by speaking too long this is now as this is talking about Abraham and God right showing you how God had had worked on Abraham's heart and he brought him to a condition where this man Abraham started to speak like [Music] God he says as it is written I have made the a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were amen you see what faith does it calls things which are not as as though they are praise the Lord amen that's how powerful faith is Faith can make you if you are Desiring maybe you have a hope or a desire in your heart for a car Faith sees it that you already have it faith will make you go buy a keying that even though you don't have the finances for the car you're showing God your faith and you say I have faith enough I'm going to buy this key ring and I'm keeping it getting ready for my car you go buy a 5 lit petrol and you'll say I'm going to fill this Petrol in my car faith is rugged like that faith has muscles like that faith has muscles that if you're looking for a house amen expecting believing God for a house maybe you can't afford the house right now but you go buy some doily cloths that you're going to put in the house hey you'll start to buy the things in for the kitchen why you're going to show God I got the stuff amen I need somewhere to put it but faith will do [Music] that praise the Lord that's right Fai if you're looking for a girlfriend will make you buy the chocolates and keep it now praise the Lord so you the amen we're going to close now amen praise the Lord I'm trying to show you that Faith requires something I don't know if you just understood it in the scripture Faith requires something in return that because you believe faith will bring something in return love is not like that love doesn't require anything in return yes love does not require anything in return Faith requires something in return I have faith because I want whatever I'm believing for but love doesn't require something in return which means love is not based on conditions you may have faith in a person amen sorry you may not have faith in a person but you can love that person but if you don't love that person you can't have faith in them I'm showing you which is a higher dimension there may be people who have done things to break your trust and you lose faith in them but yet with The Gap love you can still love them maybe you don't have faith in them anymore they broken your trust but love will still make you love them doesn't mean you can't love them praise the Lord and love won't write people off no matter what they've done right no matter how backslid they are no matter which church they Fellowship in I need somebody to say better amen than that come on we're killing Spirits here now love conquers all am so I'm saying maybe your faith in them is gone but your love can still prevail I still love them they're my brother my sister Lord they've hurt me so badly that I've lost all confidence in their word but yet I love them I'm talking about a god kind of love now Lord but my memory was bringing back things to my mind that is just showing me that they've done so evil against me but love conquers me I've been conquered by love and love becomes this conquering force that just flows through me like a river that I can't help but love them amen praise the Lord the Bible says love does not seek its own love is patient love is kind amen amen we know Faith requires patience patience we know James tell us the testing of your faith work with patience praise the Lord love is patient you can have faith to move mountains and you can be considered in the Christian world as somebody great powerful man of God but if you don't have charity the Bible says you are nothing you can prove your faith but you may not have love so what what we are saying this morning when you have increased to perfect Faith it's time to enlarge your territory and push out into Gap love amen push out into a gape love it's time to enlarge a territory and move the faith territory into a love territory because the essence of Love is faith hope and charity it operates as one unit without the Capstone of Charity we are building in faith imagine building all seven virtues and no charity we have built in faith imagine building a house and no roof can you live in the house that's what it is then we've built this beautiful house but no roof we may have even furnished the house but you forgot to put the roof we are building in vain we would have built from Faith to brotherly kindness in vain all of it would profit nothing if charity the Capstone don't come am so the message came to turn our hearts back to the original faith and we know seven Thunders give us Faith so what will it take for that Capstone of love to come down to cap the pyramids of our life we need to grow up to charity add to your faith virtue amen if something isn't adding up in your life you need to add up to charity amen and I tell you as Believers as Sons and Daughters of God we're making a declaration this morning we will not be satisfied until charity comes amen amen tell your neighbor that Hallelujah tell him I will not be satisfied until charity [Music] comes so these are the territories we must take over we know the most powerful force on the earth is love and as we extend our borders past Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness we are ready to cross over into that dimension of love and with this I am something now I can speak to mountains with love and it makes me [Music] something now I can give my body to be burned with love and I am something what makes me something love the agape love yes sir amen without without this love I am nothing but with this love I am something so love gives me my Essence love give me my worth love give me my value how many of you have known people that just unloved in this world they Feel So Unworthy they don't feel worth anything because they are not loved there are two important things you need in this life can I say three now you need to love God you need to have the love of God and you need to be loved amen amen praise the Lord so with this I can become a complete man amen and let the great love Spirit come upon each and every one of us this morning let's just read now in completion amen we are done now with our sermon let's just read our scripture and let's read it with understanding Now 1 Corinthians chapter 13 I pray this is okay this morning am we have learned something amen praise the Lord because we can't be this all powerful man this Adam man on the earth without this elements though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity now remember you can replace that word with love I am become as sounding brass a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing now here's about love charity suffered long long suffering is kind charity envieth not charity wanted not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seek it not her own is not easily provoked think it no evil rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth Bears all things believes all things I thought you just needed faith I'm just trying to show you this is a supercharge now open all things praise the Lord endureth all things Love Never Fails but whether they be prophecies they shall fail whether they be tongues they shall sees whether they be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with amen when I was a child as spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child now you see what he's bringing here now adoption the boy under tutor thought like that he says but now that I've come to full maturity I became a man I put away this childish things am for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face and now I know in part but then I shall know even as also I am known and now abided Faith hope and charity and these three things and these three but the greatest of these is Charity praise the Lord amen let's turn to Peter there amen I just want to read that because I want to show you there's no separation between brotherly love and charity coming upon you hallelujah praise the Lord amen second Peter chapter chapter 1 we close now amen I'm just reading the scripture second Peter chapter 1 we'll read from let's read from verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you may might be partakers of the divine nature so he's talking about Jesus Christ divine nature now having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity you said how a seamless flow it is there wasn't a stop at brotherly kindness and then now something is going to happen it's a seamless flow to grow up how many of you are reading that and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack these things is blind and cannot see a far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall and if you have these things he says so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen let's stand together give God an an clap of Praise he's worthy to be praised amen amen glory to God Amen so I pray amen that that would have helped you Amen to supercharge your faith this morning amen let's approach life differently thank you Jesus a three-dimensional being faith hope and charity the essence of love Faith open charity is the essence of love hallelujah amen It's Time To Worship the Lord time to open up our hearts to him and say Lord let me extend my borders past Faith oh God let me extend it part hope oh God I want to extend my border into charity because the greatest of these is Charity now I'm not saying that the Bible is saying the greatest is charity the greatest is love we've been through the scriptures to show you why love is the greatest and When Love Was personified in a person he was called Jesus Christ Greater Love had no man than he that laid down his life for us God is love the very essence of God is love so if we want to be this Adam man if Adam was made in the image and likeness of God and Adam was a man of love he couldn't have been no different yes Adam would have perfected would have had perfected love he had no fear thank you Jesus e amen let's great this love story so I'm casting all my Care on you I know you love me Redemption it's Redemption by Blood talk about the greatest that's the [Music] greatest Christ has done it all for restoration for Redemption that's what seven angels in
