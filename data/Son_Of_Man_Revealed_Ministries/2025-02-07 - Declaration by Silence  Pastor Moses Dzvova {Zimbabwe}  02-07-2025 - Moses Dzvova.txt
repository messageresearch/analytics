========================================

Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. We greet everyone in the mighty, the matchless name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. You may be seated for a few moments. Amen. So I can see everybody. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Give you a warm welcome into the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And pray that you'll be blessed even as you Amen. hear the word of the Lord. Amen. Come expecting a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you know that God exceeds our expectations? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So some, you know, in the book of Luke 6:38, it says, "Give, it'll come back." Now, some people may be expecting a a mediocre blessing, but he says, "It'll come back pressed down." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shaken together. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Running over." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God always deals in the overflow. That's why the wise virgins will always have extra in their lamps. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They also got a vessel &gt;&gt; because he knew that there will come a time when gross darkness will come across the earth. So he he says when God calls a man, he equips the man. &gt;&gt; And he sends him out. So we the wise virgins &gt;&gt; are no longer just the wise virgins. &gt;&gt; We are the married wife of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; and we are not mothers.

Jesus Christ has finally found a woman that he can put seed into &gt;&gt; and bring forth &gt;&gt; the original seed again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a time and season we're living in. &gt;&gt; And you know what? God has chosen you. Tell your neighbor, God has chosen you to be a part of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a blessed opportunity. Amen.

Pastor Rodney. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With his wife. &gt;&gt; They almost killed me in Peter Mary's bed. So I preached one service in the morning by the girls eye there. Then two more services in Peter Mar. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we had wonderful times. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I'm happy to see brothers and sisters. So because of time we let's go straight to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I also want to say pastor Denzel was a a blessing when he pastor Adrienne when he came to Harare he came to preach for pastor Kichi and also brother blessing mane. So we were tremendously blessed. &gt;&gt; So you people you are so blessed to have a gifted minister among you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe the angel of the Lord was there. &gt;&gt; When Pastor Adrian was preaching, I could feel the anointing and the presence. &gt;&gt; We were thoroughly blessed. &gt;&gt; So I want to tell you that he did not disappoint you. &gt;&gt; He represented you well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So people really appreciated uh this church because of him. He was a very good ambassador. And we also had lunch together. We were fellowshipping. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm happy to see Pastor Eshko. &gt;&gt; God bless you my friend. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let's go straight to the word. First Kings chapter 17. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The atmosphere is so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those were playing instruments and singing. I felt hey we could have continued for another hour just in worship. &gt;&gt; How many agree with me? &gt;&gt; It was so wonderful. And I also want to appreciate brother Matia that I came with my countryman, my homeboy. Amen. Oh yes. Yeah, he's there. So he's with brother Rodney. So I'm with him. So let's read first Kings chapter 17. We will start from verse uh 8. And the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to Zarifat which belongth to Zidon &gt;&gt; and dwell there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have commanded what? a widow woman there to sustain thee. So ar So he arose and went to Zarif. And when he had come to the gate of the city, behold the woman were the woman was there gathering of sticks. And he called to her and said, "Vetch me, I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink." &gt;&gt; May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. So let's be seated. So I'll read as well. Revelation &gt;&gt; chapter 8. I wish I was with brother Denzel because when I was when I'm always with him in the car, he's always telling me naked. So, but today I'm in trouble with no nugget. So, when I'm with brother Denz, we always enjoy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's always preaching to me. So, Revelation 1 &gt;&gt; it says, "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence &gt;&gt; in heaven about the space of half an hour." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to give a small title. I just want to say a declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Declaration by by silence. &gt;&gt; So, you know that God speaks in silence. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Matthew, God speaks in silence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now the Bible says to Elijah, I have already commanded the W of to sustain you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So can can you can we repeat it again? Maybe the same first kings. I want you to see something. Let's go to first kings chapter 17 verse 9. M &gt;&gt; we we we we go back. He says he says yes arise get thee to Zarif which belongth to Zidon and dwell there. Behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. &gt;&gt; So I was thinking on myself to say where huh can anyone show me where God commanded the woman? Huh? Can anyone show? Can anyone show me where God commanded her? Where God spoke to this woman, &gt;&gt; Pastor Tensel? So that's why that's where I took my title &gt;&gt; declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because listen, Elijah comes and says, "Can you give me food?" And the woman says, "No, I'm only left with only a few so that I eat and I die with my son." And then uh but she did not know are we together &gt;&gt; that God had already commanded her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; It was a declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; God, how many times &gt;&gt; does God speak to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does God commission you &gt;&gt; in silence? &gt;&gt; So sometimes you hear someone saying, "God has called me to go and preach. God has called me to do this. &gt;&gt; Huh? Don't worry. It's declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; Are we together friends? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. I want to start with a quotation. You are going to see what brother Brhamam says. How many love the prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, pastor Denzel, I wish I gave you my notes so that we we fellowshipped with this declaration by silence. Amen. So I just want to I want you to see this. Amen. How many under expectation? &gt;&gt; So it's in the message Elijah and the meal offering. So let's start paragraph 57. This is 60310. This blessed me. He says now on paragraph 57. Oh there it was. And when they walked, okay, let's jump that maybe. Okay, let's just read. When they walked in the fiery furnace under trial, under a test, they held true to the end. But God was there just in a spare of a moment and he delivered them. We know the Hebrew children. They know that they they were prayed up. Their sins were confessed. They know they had met every requirement. And yet he seemed to be silent. &gt;&gt; He's only silent to test you. &gt;&gt; To see really what you are, &gt;&gt; what's on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; See if you really mean from your heart. &gt;&gt; What you are saying with your lips. &gt;&gt; Let that go deep. &gt;&gt; We can sing with our lips. But in our heart say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; But is our heart saying it? &gt;&gt; You must mean what you say &gt;&gt; and say what you mean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some brothers don't mean what they say &gt;&gt; and they they don't say what they mean. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham says here, let that go deep. We can say with our lips, but is is our heart saying it. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 58. Now when this little woman knowed that she had met all these requirements and still God was silent seemed like he didn't even care for her. He didn't care whether she lived or died but all the time God was working. &gt;&gt; Do you see my brother? &gt;&gt; Even when God is silent but all the time God is working. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be praying for a job. You might be praying for healing. You might be praying for a heart desire. And God seems to be silent. But all the time, God is working. &gt;&gt; God works by silence. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm enjoying. And still God was silent. Sinned. He didn't even care for her. He didn't care whether she lived or died. But all the time, God was working. &gt;&gt; Listen now. She didn't know about it. &gt;&gt; But God told Elijah, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; He dried up the brook, reached out his hand and stopped the brook from running. And Elijah said, "Lord, why did it stop?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I have commanded a widow woman to feed you." &gt;&gt; Listen now. He had already commanded her. &gt;&gt; She didn't know it. Pastor Jason, he had already. So, how many times does God command you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You must be sensitive to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You must be spiritually sensitive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Many times God commands us &gt;&gt; to do certain things. But we what we we miss it somehow. He says he had already commanded her. She didn't know it. &gt;&gt; That's my message. &gt;&gt; Declaration by silent. &gt;&gt; Huh? God silently commanded her to sustain Elijah. &gt;&gt; So maybe after service you want to see the pastor and the deacons and say, "I'm struggling. Things are difficult. Pastor, can you help me?" But you might not know that God had already commanded you to sustain the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, do you understand what I'm saying? You might be thinking, you know, I'm poor. Things are difficult. God is not answering me. But do you know what God has commanded? &gt;&gt; Ask your neighbor said, "Do you know what he has commanded?" I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, Pastor Rodney already. So, you don't know. Maybe you are the one that is supposed to sustain this ministry. &gt;&gt; Maybe you are the one who supposed to sustain your family, &gt;&gt; but you don't know. &gt;&gt; But God has already commanded you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Pastor Denzel, I have commanded a widow woman to feed you." He had already commanded her. She didn't know it. &gt;&gt; Listen now. Oh, I like this. I like Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He might have commanded of you a testimony of your healing. &gt;&gt; You might not know it. For those who are sick, he might have commanded you, Pastor Lord, a testimony of your healing. &gt;&gt; You might not know it, &gt;&gt; but just hang on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to He might have commanded a testimony of your dream car, of your dream house, of whatever. You might not know it, but just hang on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He might have commanded a testimony of your healing. &gt;&gt; You might not know it, but just hang on. When you are sure that you have met all the requirements, when you know that you have done everything that you know to do and made yourself before God, there is only one thing to do is hang on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to his promised day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Pastor, stay there. &gt;&gt; God promised to answer. &gt;&gt; He will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't know what he has commanded? &gt;&gt; What angel? &gt;&gt; I also know if I have been commanded also. &gt;&gt; I'm an angel also. &gt;&gt; Says, "Who is greater? The angel in heaven or the angel in the pit?" Bible says, "I can tell you an angel in the pit is more powerful &gt;&gt; than an angel in heaven." &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He might have commanded me. &gt;&gt; I might not have known it. Maybe he told pastor and I did not know it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Maybe he commanded me to come to T but I did not what know it. &gt;&gt; Maybe he told pastor what? &gt;&gt; You don't know what he has commanded. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many are going to pray for sensitivity? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother was so sensitive to the leadership of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Even when he was walking in the woods, when God was passing, brother would remove his &gt;&gt; brother could sense &gt;&gt; that I'm not alone here. That Jesus is here. Billip when he saw the angel brother says he became sensitive &gt;&gt; every time the angel came was the first one to know &gt;&gt; before brotherham says he's here knew all &gt;&gt; can you say hallelujah &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; let's be sensitive &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; hey pastor Rodney he might have commanded of you a testimony of your healing you might not know it but just What? Hang on. When you are sure, when you are sure that you have met the requirements, when you know that you have done everything that you know to do and laid yourself before God, there is only one thing to do. Hang on to his promise. Then stay there. God promised to answer. He will do it. You don't know what he has commanded, what angel or what to do. It may be this night. &gt;&gt; If you want God to bless you, personalize the quotations. &gt;&gt; Personalize the scripture. &gt;&gt; It may be this night. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It might be this night. &gt;&gt; How many knows that God hates a powerless religion? &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's be honest. God has a powerless nature. &gt;&gt; Where God is, there is power. &gt;&gt; Where God is, there is healing. &gt;&gt; Where God is identified by his characteristics. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone must be healed today. &gt;&gt; Someone must see Jesus desires &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, don't force me to preach in Zulu. Amen. Today, hallelujah. Are you being blessed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you enjoying? &gt;&gt; And then he says, you don't know what angel or what to do. It it may be this night before the healing service starts tomorrow night. God might have seen your condition today. &gt;&gt; He might have heard your your prayer. &gt;&gt; Listen to this now. He says, "I felt so sorry for these deaf and dump people. I want to lay hands on them and pray for them. Started to started to stop last night." But I said that wouldn't be right for the rest of them. But how do I know that somewhere and a silent God who knows the heart? &gt;&gt; These people has met their requirement. &gt;&gt; Church, you might have met God's requirement. &gt;&gt; And they are ready &gt;&gt; and there is an angel here tonight &gt;&gt; to deliver them &gt;&gt; from all their affliction. &gt;&gt; I believe the angel is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in the land of the angel. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Brother, things happened in De. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord was told go to De &gt;&gt; and we are in Deon. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot be sick in the land of the of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot l in the land of the prophet, &gt;&gt; in the land of the angel. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Huh? He says, "God, he says there's an angel here tonight to deliver them from all their what? Affliction." How do I know? &gt;&gt; God might have commanded their deliverance tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Whether I pray for the sick or not, &gt;&gt; they will get it &gt;&gt; because God has required it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be sure &gt;&gt; of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's certain of God. &gt;&gt; And then hold on. &gt;&gt; Meet his requirements. &gt;&gt; God knows how to do things. That's right. Knows how to do it in the right way. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor and say, "You don't know what he has commanded. &gt;&gt; Brother, you don't know what God has commanded." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know the thoughts which I think towards you, thoughts of what? Peace &gt;&gt; and not of evil. to give you an expected end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've never seen the righteous forsaken. &gt;&gt; Neither is he taking bread. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take no thought of what you're going to eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Consider the liies. &gt;&gt; They know they toil or spin. But yet Solomon in yet in all his glory was not arrayed like the &gt;&gt; brother. Amen. May God grant us grace. I like this quotation. You don't know what God has commanded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; That woman God had already commanded her. &gt;&gt; And then when Elijah came, you know, maybe she was frail, she was weak, you know, hungry. And then she sees Elijah saying, "Can you give me food?" She might have said, "Hey, this cruel man is is looking so strong and is looking for food from me. Why?" But Elijah, when she said, "Uh, I've only left with a meal for me to eat and die." Elijah might have said, "You liar. You are not left with a meal. God has commanded you to sustain me." &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; So God had told who? Elijah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but she thought, you know, she was gone. &gt;&gt; She was dead. Are we together? But God had silently what? &gt;&gt; Commanded. &gt;&gt; How many times? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your pastor preaches the word. &gt;&gt; Maybe he does not mention about your school fees. He does not mention in that sermon about your healing, about your job. And then after that service, &gt;&gt; you hear a sister saying, "Thank God I'm healed." You hear another brother say thank God I'm promoted. You hear someone say thank God I'm in courtship. But when we analyze that sermon you don't see whether pastor spoke about courtships spoke about houses but it will be a silent declaration. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; God will be speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God speaks in silence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I give another example? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know you can see brother Brham there is every time brother Brham did not speak openly &gt;&gt; that he was Elijah. How many knows that &gt;&gt; he never even spoke openly that he was a prophet. You hear brother say how many believe that I'm his prophet says sorry. It st people do you believe I'm his servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you heard that pastor? Brother Brham did not open are we together claim that he was a what? a prophet. But I'll show you that he did it silently. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; So one day he was speaking as if he's talking about his marriage with sister Ma, but he was declaring to us that he was &gt;&gt; Malach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, he said, you know, I I was saying to sister Ma, no, I think, you know, you must get married to someone who is better than me. Amen. How many understand that story? So, brother Brham was dey darling. He was not being straight. But sister Ma really loved brother Brham and sister Ma was not like our African sisters. You know that our African sisters because of culture you are not allowed like to approach a man. But sister Ma went to God to report brother. Can you imagine? But our sisters can't do that. Pastor Rodney. Hey my sister. Sister Rodney. Hallelujah. Amen. Pastor Denzel, brother, sister Ma went to the altar to report brother. &gt;&gt; She said, "Lord, look at Billy, he's wasting my time. He does not want to marry me. You know, I'm not happy." And then God opened the Bible &gt;&gt; straight to Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6. And when she said amen, she saw behold I send you Elijah. &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you the connection. &gt;&gt; How many can say of marriage? She's praying about marriage, pastor. Huh? But God gives her a scripture. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So sister knew the scriptural identification of brother. &gt;&gt; How many can say &gt;&gt; hallelujah? Huh? And then said then she knew that we were going to be married. &gt;&gt; Why? It means she knew that Billy is Elijah &gt;&gt; because she's praying about marriage and God says, "Behold, I sent you Elijah." &gt;&gt; It was a silent declaration and she caught it. Are we together? So brother is like he's talking a story but he's also telling us I am Elijah. Behold, I said you who was the Elijah who was being revealed to it's brother. &gt;&gt; How many can say silent declaration? &gt;&gt; So even pastors sometimes they might feel you know if I tell you who I am you know in the message it's like a taboo to say I'm an apostle I'm a prophet I'm an evangelist. So but the pastors they say it silently. How many can say amen pastor? You can see if you are careful, if you are spiritually intelligent, you can know. &gt;&gt; Brother so and so has declared that he's a prophet. Brother and has declared that he's a pastor. How many understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. &gt;&gt; You can even reject the message in a subtle way. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Like for example, I know it's not about brother brand. Are we together? It's about the Lord Jesus Christ. Hey, don't misunderstand me. Don't take me for what I what I say, but take me for what I mean. &gt;&gt; It's about the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Brother Brham was the angel. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. But the message is Christ. &gt;&gt; But you can hear now a minister every day &gt;&gt; of his message. It's not about brother. It's not you know until you can say what's wrong with this. But the statement is true. Are we together? But if it is repeated, continuous, you can see that no me I'm not comfortable with. How many can say &gt;&gt; pastor Rodney? Are we together? &gt;&gt; The statement is right &gt;&gt; to say it's not about brother, but it's about what? Christ. He is the principal theme of our preaching. He's the principal theme of our conversation. He's the principal theme of everything. But when every day you come and say it's not about brother, it's not you can see that you are trying to drive something. &gt;&gt; It's a silent declaration &gt;&gt; and then after some time you hear that brother has lifted a message. &gt;&gt; You won't be surprised. You said, "Oh, we could see the way he was preaching. We could see the statements." &gt;&gt; Is that right, Pastor Ley? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about silent a declaration by silence. How many knows that you can ask man silently? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Without asking it. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you are spiritually intelligent, you can catch it. You can ask a job in a subtle way. Can I give you an example for that? You know, Joseph could interpret dreams and he interpreted the dream of what? &gt;&gt; Of Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; And then Pharaoh was troubled when there was no man. You know when I was watching when I was following I saw that no no normally when the word is revealed when the seals are revealed you know it brings life it brings joy &gt;&gt; but when there is no revelation &gt;&gt; it brings death can someone say amen &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; receiving revelation &gt;&gt; hh brings life &gt;&gt; and not having revelation brings death &gt;&gt; can I show you you know that even in in the Bible in the days of King Nebuchadnezzar there was a you know the the dream Nebuchadnezzar dreamt a dream of the head of gold the bracelets of silver the thighs of brass the the feet of iron and clay. So the Bible says King Nebuchadnezzar was troubled because there was no child here. There was no wise man. There was no magician that could interpret that dream. &gt;&gt; Huh? And then the king said all the wise people are going to die. If this image, if this dream is not interpreted, people will die. &gt;&gt; So I want to show you that even in Revelation chapter 5, who is worthy h to take the book and to open it? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that the prophet says if there was no man that was worthy to open the seals, brother says the human race was going to die to perish. The whole human race was going to perish. That's why when there was no man in heaven, when there was no man on earth, John was crying. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And then when the lab, the line of the tribe of Judah opened the seals. Are we together? John was happy. Brother says he might have seen his name in the book. &gt;&gt; So that revelation brings life. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And even the king Nebuchadnezzar he said if this dream pastor Rodney is not revealed is not interpreted all the wise people are dying. Daniel went to his friends and said friends let's pray &gt;&gt; if God does not reveal this dream we are finished &gt;&gt; and in a night vision God came and revealed are we together and they did not die &gt;&gt; so do you see that where revelation is there is life &gt;&gt; where there is leg of revelation there is death &gt;&gt; how many can say amen &gt;&gt; and revelation &gt;&gt; is given from God Yeah. &gt;&gt; Silver. He says, "Whom do men say I, the son of man?" Others said, "You are Elijah." Others said, "You are Isaiah's." But he says, "You, who do you say I am?" &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "You are Christ, the son of the living God. For flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you." [Music] &gt;&gt; So we can't give you revelation. &gt;&gt; It's divinely given. &gt;&gt; It comes from God. &gt;&gt; How many can say &gt;&gt; amen? How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Who? Listen, if you know who God is, &gt;&gt; he will reveal to you who you are. &gt;&gt; If you want to know your position, you must first of all know his position. &gt;&gt; When Peter says you are Christ, &gt;&gt; are we together? And then says you are Peter, &gt;&gt; you are a rock. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? When you know who he is, he will reveal to you who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What says thou of thyself? &gt;&gt; Are you the one or shall we wait for another? They came to John the Baptist and said, "What says thou of yourself?" &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So you you you you want to tell me that they did not know that he was called John Zachariah. &gt;&gt; Even the people who worked at the home affairs, they knew this is John Zachariah. But they come to him and said, "What says thou of thyself?" They were not expecting him to say, "No, they wanted his script identification." &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What says thou of thyself? &gt;&gt; Are you the one or shall we wait for another? &gt;&gt; He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Brother, it's very important &gt;&gt; to know who you are. says the reason the reason Jesus did all the miracles, healed the people, performed miracles, he knew who he was. &gt;&gt; There's power in knowing who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you can see pastor Rodney in his church when there's a prayer line, maybe there is a demon that is causing are we together? And pastor Rodney says to the Tim as the pastor of this church, &gt;&gt; I cast you out. &gt;&gt; He's not trying to be proud. &gt;&gt; He wants to for the demon to know who he is &gt;&gt; because the demons they take advantage that we don't know who we are. &gt;&gt; So when you come pastor me and say as the pastor of this church I rebuke you. When you see pastor as the pastor of this church come out, &gt;&gt; it's not pride. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says a sister who knows her position, &gt;&gt; she is more powerful than a pretending preacher. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He want people who knows who they are. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ah, come on church. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Hallelujah. You must know who you are. &gt;&gt; We are looking for sisters who knows who they are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We cast out demons by revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be manipulated by a demon. And can I shock you? There was a minister, you know, he you know sometimes you know pastors and what I don't know what happens sometimes they will be owing people money and things. It happens. So this pastor owed people a lot of money. So he was casting out a demon. That says I won't go. You are a demon says I won't go. You must first of all pay up. You must first of all pay the people that you owe. And the pastor knew who he was. Pastor, he said to the demon, "It's true that I owe people money. It's true that I'm in a foreign state, but still in my fall fallen state, I'm more powerful than you. Come out. Come out. I'm going to go and pay up after you are gone. &gt;&gt; Say amen. The pastor knew who he was. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My circumstance does not determine who I am. &gt;&gt; If I you come out, &gt;&gt; we must know who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The power of knowledge. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Joseph, how many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joseph came and said, "Your dream is one. &gt;&gt; There is seven years of plenty and seven years of fine that are going to come." So listen now. Joseph is now applying for the job silent &gt;&gt; in a subtle way. Pastor D. He speaks everything and then he says to V, "You know what? You must look for a wise man. Look for a what? That will prepare, you know, the the Ghas and store the food. And Pharaoh said, "Hey, I don't suffer for gladly." &gt;&gt; You understand? You want a job, &gt;&gt; you are the man. I'm telling you, Far could see, but Joseph was not speaking direct, &gt;&gt; but he was applying for a job. &gt;&gt; You can apply for a job indirect, in a silent way. How many can say it? You can ask money in a silent way. &gt;&gt; You know pastor people can see it. Pastor Rodley silent declaration. &gt;&gt; May God help us. You know that people in the blood they are so wise. They are so intelligent. So some people think people cannot see through. People can see this one is applying for money. This one is looking for money. This one how many understand that? &gt;&gt; May God silent declaration. &gt;&gt; Huh? Sometimes you don't have to chase away someone from work, but you can chase him silently. Can I give you an example? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You know, a was giving Sah hard times and Sarah went to Abraham and said, "Look at this man." I'm talking about declaration by silence. You know me, I'm not deceived by words. &gt;&gt; People say words, they deceive. But if you want to really know what someone thinks about you, watch their actions. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, pastor. I can't deceive you. I watch actions. &gt;&gt; Someone can say, "I love you, pastor. I love you." But you see the actions. &gt;&gt; See someone coming, oh pastor, I like you. God bless you. But is a trouble go around telling people, did you hear that sermon? How did you see it? But after that, God bless you. Me, I don't care about God bless you. I watch the what? The actions. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Can you say hallelujah? &gt;&gt; Are you there? &gt;&gt; I do not want to go there. I do not want to go there. You know me. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; I was just passing through somebody. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; You even in your heart whatever you are, how many have experienced that? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you see the people's words not matching what actions, there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So now we see Sarah comes to Abraham. He says, "Hey, look at this man what she's doing." And Abraham said, "Behold." Are we together? &gt;&gt; That your handmade is in your hands. Do to her as it pleases you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And Sarah, the Bible says she dealt hardly with hugger and she fell and she left. She was not chased away together hagger. Sarah did not just away but silent declaration &gt;&gt; declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; You know like right now I know I am loved here. &gt;&gt; You can feel it. &gt;&gt; How many can say &gt;&gt; you know when I am not loved pastor Rodney I can even feel it. You just see me go God bless you is over and I run away. What you think people will be quiet? Can I tell you those people who were saying bab they were not speaking like what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; The prophet says they were thinking in their minds to say this man is what but he could pick it because he says you know your thoughts they speak much louder in heaven. You know the pulpit is the closest place to heaven on earth. This place is so sensitive that whatever people say I hear it let's say you say are you just close man when I when you speak like in your mind me I'll be hearing go back to Zimbabwe &gt;&gt; yeah here in the pit it is magnified how many can say amen &gt;&gt; there's no one saying that but it's just an example how many are being blessed &gt;&gt; declaration by what &gt;&gt; that's why brother comes and Then Jesus said to them, you you what? You say one thing and &gt;&gt; against me now, you'll be forgiven. But time will come when the Holy Ghost is what is revealed to say one word. You will never what? But those people, Pastor Rodri, they never spoke loudly. &gt;&gt; They were speaking in silence. &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. &gt;&gt; Do you see my brother, my sister, may God grant us grace. when you are talking when you are quiet. &gt;&gt; Hey, I went somewhere you know it was at I'm sorry to say that. So I went not not in my church a brother somewhere. So I went so I wanted to see a a a minister friend. Then we just when I arrived they were eating breakfast but I did not come for breakfast. The minister had called me he was outside of the country said no brother come and see me. So when I went there then they put the food in the table. They said, "Pastor Moses, join us." But I could feel it. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; That the sister was not comfortable with me eating. So pastor Rodney, I just I I I was just fellowshipping. I was not eating. When the sister goes out to the kitchen, I remain eating. But when she comes, I could feel it's heavy. There's something wrong. How many I'm talking about declaration by silence. Pastor Eden, did you hear that? We are in the table there. The the people speak with their mouth. With their mouth. &gt;&gt; You are free, brother. Let's read this. I want to read something here. H in the message. There's something that I want to read here in Numbers. Let's go to numbers. We are moving well. Numbers chapter 30. Declaration by silence. Numbers chapter 30. Let's just go quickly. Numbers chapter 30. How many are with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many see where I'm going? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it says here, Numbers chapter 30. [Music] Numbers chapter 30. So, let's go there quickly. Numbers chapter 30. Let's start. from verse two. If a man vow a vow unto the Lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedth out of his mouth. So when a brother vows a vow in the house to say maybe I want to do this for brother so and so I want to do this, he must do what he has found. But watch verse three. If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth like some of you brothers when your daughters vow a vow and those daughters are still under your your care watch what brother the scripture says and her father vow and and her bond wherewith she had bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her. Then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith sheath bound her so shall stand. But if her father disallow her in the day that he uh not any of her vows or of her bones wherewith she had bound her soul shall stand. and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her. &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to see something. I'm talking about declaration by silence. So, brother, the scripture says if maybe pastor Denzel's daughter just speaks and say, "Oh, I want to take that micro. I want to take those dresses and give sister so and so. I can see I'm no longer fitting these dresses. Let me go give that sister." She vows a vow unto the Lord and Pastor Denel hears her vowing and keeps quiet. The Bible says that quietness he's he is concerning. He is agreeing. Do you hear what I'm saying? So if the the Bible says if the father keeps quiet, &gt;&gt; it's a declaration. &gt;&gt; How many hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm saying declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if pastor Denzel hears it and said, "My daughter, no, don't give those dresses to her." The Bible says the vow will be disallowed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The vow will be what? So, but you see where I'm I'm heading to. Uhhuh. So, you say, "No, my father was quiet." That that quietness, huh, it's a concern. When the father is quiet, it's a sign to say go ahead and do whatever you want to do. &gt;&gt; So don't say ah no my father was just quiet. So are you seeing brothers &gt;&gt; that when you hear things and you keep quiet your silence hallelujah is a statement. Your silence is an announcement pastor declaration by silence. Hey, &gt;&gt; I don't want to go into doctrine, but there's something which I enjoyed in this, but it's not what I want to say. &gt;&gt; You know, he says if the man vows a vow, &gt;&gt; the wife or the daughter cannot disow that vow. But the wife, if she vows a vow and the daughter, the man can say no. I I I don't want to introduce things. How many can sisters please forgive me sisters for that? But I was just reading. I saw that. Hey. Yeah. So the man is the post. I said, "Lord, I'm happy to to see this." Amen. How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Declaration by what? &gt;&gt; By silence. Hallelujah. Amen. I wish one day I would preach and talk about that. So even in a church as well, the pastor hears something, people say, "Let's do this. Let's do this." that if the pastor keeps quiet then let it happen but if the pastor hears that and say no no no no how many can say amen &gt;&gt; and I also want to to drop this pastor Rodney I saw that in Egypt God sent Moses to go deliver the children of Israel and there was one man I want you to see one man that came and said to Moses you who made you our leader who made you our You killed a man in Egypt. You did this. And Moses and that man rejected &gt;&gt; and Moses. &gt;&gt; But when Paul comes now, he comes and say &gt;&gt; Moses whom Israel rejected. &gt;&gt; I want you to see &gt;&gt; there is what we call condemnation by representation. &gt;&gt; How many understand that? &gt;&gt; The condemnation by what? Listen, it was not the whole of Israel that rejected Moses. But it was one person that said, "I don't want what we don't want you. Who who sent you?" But Israel was what? Was quiet. So the quietness of Israel was a a sign that they were agreeing with this man. &gt;&gt; So I learned something that sometime we are in a minister's group as ministers and someone blast another minister. Oh my &gt;&gt; in a rude way and everything and then you are quiet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God will you come down and say you ministers are we together pastor so and so that you blasted and ridiculed and but it was brother pastor so and so God will say but you silence. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So one time someone was blessing another minister. I just said no brothers me it's not in me. I exited. I don't want to be what identified. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, pastor declaration. So when you see people backbiting the pastor, saying bad things about giving another brother, if you keep quiet, it's a sign of concern &gt;&gt; cuz it has happened in your presence and God will come and say Moses &gt;&gt; whom Israel rejected. So you hear God say brother so and so you you rejected brother. You said when did we reject? Then you said when a pastor came and spoke bad about Malachi 4 in the pit &gt;&gt; and you came to quiet and you saying you are humble. &gt;&gt; God will say Malachi 4 who was rejected in but it is just one person. Pastor I don't know why I'm saying this. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm just showing you the principles. I'm not saying that pastor, pastor, we pastor, we should be rooted. What? &gt;&gt; There are certain things &gt;&gt; that you can tolerate. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know like even in my church someone can preach, how many can say amen? And maybe say it is Elisha that went to heaven in a whalewind. It's a slip of a tongue. I know it's Elijah. I can't correct that. I just leave it. But when someone comes, how many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. and say brother is fake. He's a liar. Is what? And then we say amen. How many can say amen? God will come. &gt;&gt; I say refute word fellowship. You rejected my s. &gt;&gt; Remember sister Weber someone came I this is coming fresh now. Since someone came he was blessing brother Brham. He was doing this and sister Weber stood up pastor Rodney and said no no no no I know William Bran. How many can say it's not like this? He's a man of God and sister was dying. How many she was sick and the angel of the Lord heard it &gt;&gt; and say thus say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Go tell sister Weber that she's not going to what to die. Why? She did not keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor and say there are certain things pastor that we can't tolerate. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you keep quiet, it's a sign of consent. &gt;&gt; You are agreeing. &gt;&gt; I come here and say no. If the sister is always challenging you do this, just put her away and marry another. And then you say, hallelujah. Praise God. Sisters are problematic. God will come &gt;&gt; and say you people you believe polygam. You say, but wait, sis, you were quiet when pastor Moses was preaching poly. You agreed with it. How many can say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; I hope we are learning. &gt;&gt; How many things have we agreed to in our silence? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pastor can say &gt;&gt; no. I never I never said this. But why were you quiet? &gt;&gt; Even in a family group, they will blast your father. Your your your siblings will be blasting your father. in a family group and you keep quiet. You say no no no no you must give respect as our father don't talk like that &gt;&gt; then God honor you but if you keep quiet they will say you blessed your father in the group &gt;&gt; said but me is my brother but why were you quiet &gt;&gt; how many can say &gt;&gt; declaration by silence &gt;&gt; how many can say &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying this &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; look at he wanted to grab the kingdom Using silence declaration he told you know says please can you go and talk to Solomon and ask theite for wife to wife are we together and then went he said to Solomon you know can you give a huh to to Adonia and Solomon was very wise he says what are you asking the kingdom for adonia it was a silent declaration. Some people can what? Some people can show their intentions, their interest. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If someone wants to be the pastor, pastor Rodney in your church, you can see that no, this one wants a one he wants to take over. Yes. Let's be honest. How many pastor &gt;&gt; if someone shows interest to take over he can come the style but now but she could not see that &gt;&gt; you know but Solomon he said no it's not about asking what forish he's asking the kingdom &gt;&gt; how many can say &gt;&gt; no I don't want to go how many can say I'm talking about declaration So we we must be sensitive. &gt;&gt; You can see my brother. Hey my brother, do you hear? You can see no something is happening here. &gt;&gt; So when he was asking for the wife of the father, &gt;&gt; he was asking for for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; How many can say so Solomon was wise says no Adonia you have asked for your death. You are going to die for this. But when you just read you think Solomon was cruel. How can he do that? But it was a cool went into orchestrated. It was treasonous. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; But he did it in a subtle way. What am I saying? Declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right, friends? &gt;&gt; Someone says the seventh seal is not open. &gt;&gt; You see where I want to finish now? &gt;&gt; When there was listen, it was thunders. It was silence in heaven. But standard on earth. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; During that silence something was happening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Lord Jesus was coming down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was the reason of the silence? Brother say that was the minute and the hour that the Lord would come down. &gt;&gt; Can I hear that? &gt;&gt; So you hear someone say the seven seal is not opened. Where were you when it was opened? How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; The seventh seal, how many can say was open but not to the public, &gt;&gt; but you and we are not public. &gt;&gt; Can you say &gt;&gt; if our gospel is hit, it is hid to them who are lost. &gt;&gt; How many say amen? &gt;&gt; You need a password. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; For you to download the seven. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was talking to other people, he was speaking in parables. &gt;&gt; But when he was talking now &gt;&gt; to the elect. Are we together? It's a love letter, &gt;&gt; silent declaration. &gt;&gt; Someone is reading one spoken word. Oh, I'm feeling good now. &gt;&gt; I hope corruption won't set in. &gt;&gt; When time is prolonged, corruption will. &gt;&gt; So, don't worry. I've got many services to go. So I have to to see how I just give few examples. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Someone read a quotation a spoken word. Two people the other guy said hey. The other guy said no this man I don't want to read these books again cuz this man in here who is preaching said I am a a a a crow. I'm a hog. I'm a crow. And then another one &gt;&gt; who was reading the same spoken word. He said thank God. &gt;&gt; This man says [Applause] &gt;&gt; declaration. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; God speaks in silence in a simple way. &gt;&gt; God hides and reveals himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the seventh is seal. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Was revealed &gt;&gt; but it was not revealed to the public &gt;&gt; but it was revealed to the elect. &gt;&gt; It's like a love letter we read in between the lines. &gt;&gt; Can I read this quotation quickly? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know I was just putting my background. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I want you to see this. I enjoyed this quotation. spiritual food in Jerus. He says 65718. He says &gt;&gt; then back out there at the beginning of the seven seals. It's 65 0718. I like this quotation paragraph 83. Then back out there, brother Denzel, he says at the beginning of the seven seals, &gt;&gt; when those seven angels came down in that pyramid form, are you seeing it? stood there and told me to return back here and speak on those seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he would be with me. &gt;&gt; He would show me what they were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says he would show me what they were. &gt;&gt; The lost things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He would show me what they were. &gt;&gt; The lost things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was praying the lost things in my church. &gt;&gt; I always thought it was sealed on the back of the book &gt;&gt; and it would be something wasn't wrote in the book. Listen says I thought it was not something wrote in the book but it turned out that it was made known that he could not do that. &gt;&gt; It isn't something that's written in the book. &gt;&gt; It's something that's been &gt;&gt; hid. It's something that has been what? Leave in the book. &gt;&gt; Why? Silent declaration. &gt;&gt; He hides it. &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word. So it is a mystery that's been in the book in these seven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Out of the what? Churches comes the seals. Yeah, he does. &gt;&gt; Out of the seals comes the trumpets, the thunders. How many can say &gt;&gt; you know the the seals is the history of the church ages. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; It has been hidden in the what? In the church edges. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what struck me, Pastor Tenzel, he says it was made known that he cannot do that. It isn't something that's written in the book, but it's something pastor Rodney that's been hid in the book. &gt;&gt; If our gospel is is hid, it is hid to them who are lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall take one word or add one word. So it's a mystery that's been in the book in these seven church ages. Each one of them produced a mystery. all about water baptism and all these things that they are fumbling about &gt;&gt; so long &gt;&gt; we read in between the lines &gt;&gt; so there's something and then he says here it is the rising of the sun 654 18 it is the rising of the sun 30 he says he is the one who opened those seals &gt;&gt; he is those seals For the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened. &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals then? Revealing Christ. &gt;&gt; How many say amen? &gt;&gt; All the seven the purpose of the opening of the seven seals is to reveal Christ. &gt;&gt; We take people to church. Brother says we are supposed to take people to Christ and Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; How many he never said Jesus but he said Christ is the mystery of God revealed &gt;&gt; because Jesus is the body. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? But Christ is the anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ is the logos that dwelt in Jesus. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is only the body, but Christ is the anointing. Christ is the log ghost. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; So really when I was seeing this brother me, I just said, "Oh my hallelujah." The purpose of the opening of the seven seals is to reveal Christ. &gt;&gt; Are we together friends? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham preached a message. Are we together? Indictment. He said, "I indict this generation for crucifying who?" Christ aring on my own. I said, "Why was indictment preached after the SS were were were preached?" Indictment was not preached before the SES. But indictment was preached after the SES were preached. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Because if indictment was preached before the Zeus was going to be indicting what? &gt;&gt; Because the seventh seal brings him back. &gt;&gt; It was the opening of the seven seals that brought Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Through the opening of the seven seals. Hallelujah. The full word is born into manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this Jesus whom who was received in the heavens until the times of the restitution of all things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; All these other messengers, how many can say amen? Were not mistaken for the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; But why is it brother and Paul they were mistaken for the Lord Jesus Christ? Do you know why? &gt;&gt; If you look at Luther, he was still smoking. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Others they knew in part, understanding in part. But I want to tell you that people who worship brother Brana, they are not far from the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes, we don't worship brother Brana. But the full word was veiled in him. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? That's why he says, "Huh, we have heard of many Elijah and Elijah's mantels, but the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Because the word was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise God. I can show you that you know sometimes the Holy Spirit would just come and take over brother. One time brother was calling an himself. While he was calling an altar call, God came and took over and started speaking as if brother Brham was speaking in tongues. But it was God himself speaking. &gt;&gt; Can I read that? &gt;&gt; Are you ready for that? &gt;&gt; Can I read it quickly? Put it there. It's in the message. Looking at the unseen. I want you to see 590410. Hallelujah. We are moving so well now is in the message. Pastor Rodney, it struck me. Looking at the unseen. 5904 10. Let's go now. We start here. I know you'll catch it. Let me read quickly. He says, "Brother Branam has finished preaching, my brother. He's finished preaching my sister." Then he says while you are standing on your feet praising God, how many ones? He says you that raised your hands a while ago believes that God will hear my prayer for your salvation of your soul. Brother Brham says now come walking down here now as we sing I will praise him. Brother Brham says I will praise him. He says, "Come on, walk right down the aisles here now, right down to receive Jesus, Pastor." Then he says, "Keep your heads up. &gt;&gt; Keep looking at the unseen." &gt;&gt; Then he says that little pulsation. Watch now in your heart. He says, "Come moving right on down." And then brother panam says is he pulsating to you? &gt;&gt; Watch now if you listen to the tape you can see the tone changing. Then he says here all of a sudden pastor esho he says I'm the lord &gt;&gt; that raised up Christ from but it was brother &gt;&gt; calling the altar call. But all of a sudden something comes to take over. He says, "I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave. I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost." This is no longer brother Brham. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm the one that keep the promise." &gt;&gt; Listen to this B. &gt;&gt; He says, "Brother Brham has nothing to do in this." &gt;&gt; But is brother speaking? &gt;&gt; He says, "Brother brother has nothing to do in this." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not me &gt;&gt; I'm reading here. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He says brother has nothing to do in this. &gt;&gt; He surrendered his life to me. It was not another sister or another brother &gt;&gt; speaking in tongs. No. God came and took over and started speaking through brotherham. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Brother Branham has nothing to do in this. He surrendered his life to me. I'm using his spirit. I'm talking through his lips. &gt;&gt; That's me. I'm the Lord. Come down. &gt;&gt; The prayer the altar call started by brother &gt;&gt; but it ended. &gt;&gt; God calling himself. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that me &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord &gt;&gt; come down. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why people you could understand them who misunderstood brother for Jesus &gt;&gt; because it was too much. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we don't worship brother. &gt;&gt; We must defy &gt;&gt; but it was what too much. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he will come and say good evening friends. You you think it's brother prana yet it's God himself. &gt;&gt; Can I read another quotation? Yes. Can I read this quotation &gt;&gt; in the message smiling church? You know I saw that hey we English people we are so blessed &gt;&gt; because God did not come speaking French. He did not come speaking or I want to tell you that God in this generation he came speaking English. &gt;&gt; English is a special language. That's why when things are tough for me, I pray in English. How many? Then I see I know that the family spirit they did not go to school, they went to night school. If you pray in school, they will hear you. But if you pray in English, how many can say &gt;&gt; I was in trouble one time. I prayed in English and God came down. How many can say &gt;&gt; pastor Hallelujah. How many are going to pray in English? Oh man, I know you know people English is your language. But watch why I'm saying that. How many are ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; How many believe that God came speaking in English? &gt;&gt; Listen, in the morning, I see people are laughing now. When I'm in trouble, I pray in English. So smiling we say father God we are standing in the threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence which the world has never seen. How many can say amen &gt;&gt; and God will come down. &gt;&gt; Smile and change. Watch now. He says paragraph 13 34 if you can put it. He says then he arose up from the grave and ascend it on high. Watch now. Brother Brham says, "Are you there? Jehovah returning in the form of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; So you you think it was brother Brham who was creating squirrels. I want to tell you &gt;&gt; a man cannot create. &gt;&gt; Only God can create. &gt;&gt; It was God. In another quotation I saw brotherham says God the creator &gt;&gt; who is now his church. God the creator who is now his judge. &gt;&gt; A man cannot create. I want to ask you who delivered the children of Israel. You will say it was God. No it was God in Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Huh? But watch but God himself he spoke and said I am going to come down. I've seen how my children are suffering and after 400 years I will come down myself. But watch now after 400 years my brother the children of Israel they see a man with a crooked stick with a a wife and a small baby. And brother Brham said some people said where are you going Moses says I'm going to Egypt to do what? He says to take off. &gt;&gt; It was a oneman invention. How many can say I want you I want you to see &gt;&gt; that it was no longer a man anymore but it was God in Moses &gt;&gt; when he arrived there he said Pharaoh let my people go &gt;&gt; did Moses save people it was no longer man speaking it was God in Moses &gt;&gt; how many can say amen even the Bible says the lamb took the book and opened the seals &gt;&gt; pastor Denzel where did you see the lamb opening the seals. Brother Brham says, "I went east to open the seven seals for God." &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; So the lamp was in William Brham. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where did you see the lamp opening &gt;&gt; the seals? Brother Brham says, "I went east to open the seven seals for God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Pharaoh let my people &gt;&gt; Amen. He arose up from the grave and ascended on high Jehovah returning in the form of the Holy Ghost to live in his church among his people. &gt;&gt; He says glory Jehovah walking down through the churching the thoughts of the mind. &gt;&gt; So you you think it was brother is Jehovah deselling the thoughts of the mind. Jehovah healing the sick. Jehovah speaking through lips. Pastor Eshko till the man hasn't got no control of himself &gt;&gt; like the that we had. Brother Pam did not have control of himself. What he says brotherham has nothing to do with this. I'm the Lord. I send the Holy Ghost. Brother did not could not control himself. And then he says Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Can you highlight it? coming back in English and translating it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Can you highlight it? Jehovah &gt;&gt; coming what &gt;&gt; pastor Jehovah come what inh coming back in what &gt;&gt; not in your language in English. So that's why I pray in English coming what &gt;&gt; and translating it. &gt;&gt; That's why you see the message is translated from English &gt;&gt; into different languages because it was Jehovah coming back in what? &gt;&gt; English. &gt;&gt; And pastor me Jehovah coming back in English and translating it. He says I want a SP there. I want another one there. Who was that? Men cannot create. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You wasn't a sign. Amen. That Jehovah come down to a prostitute. Rise up where she saw no down till the dogs won't look at her and wash her white as snow and give her a heart as pure as. Oh my. Jehovah taking a drunkard. laying there in the alley and the fly blows all over his mouth and making him preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ cleans his eyes. &gt;&gt; Can you say hallelujah? &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. So when you know when the seals were opened you know it was a silent declaration you know even Elijah huh when he was going to be raptured it was a silent declaration this is coming fresh it was not in my notes you know even the sons of the prophets are we together they knew that Elijah was going you remember Elijah Elishah could feel he started following what Elijah Elijah I was going to Beth. I went to G. He followed him. Says, why are you following him? They went to Jordan. They went to Jordan. Why? God himself silently spoke to Elijah that your time is come. &gt;&gt; So, we are not going to be taken by surprise. &gt;&gt; When when you are going, you are not going to be taken by surprise. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a silent announcement. It won't be like those news readers that will say you know the rapture that has been spoken of for 2,000 years is going to happen in December 25. No, it will be a silent announcement. &gt;&gt; Just like Elijah, he could feel something is happening and Elisha could feel it and Elisha was following Elijah. And then when they passed by the company of prophets, the sons of the prophets, the sons of the prophets, they said, "You, do you know that your master is going to be taken away?" And Elisha said, "I know it. Keep quiet." Why? It was a silent &gt;&gt; declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; That's why the singer said, "When you see me living right, when you see me coming to church, when you see me doing all these things, I'm getting ready to go. We are not going to be taken by surprise. &gt;&gt; We know something is happening. &gt;&gt; How many understand that &gt;&gt; pastor ten pastor? We are not going to be taken by surprise. &gt;&gt; When the time of the rapture comes, you will know. &gt;&gt; How did Elijah know? How did Elijah know? How did the sons of the the sons of the prophets know? It's a declaration by silence &gt;&gt; that God will just fix up that thing. &gt;&gt; Go confess to that. Go confess that this is someone. Listen, there is a brother &gt;&gt; who died in Tanzania. He was working, you know, to go buy cars and sell them. So, but before he died, I'm talking about declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; He went to the brothers that owed him money says you you owe me money. when are you going to pay back? The brother just said, "Oh, okay. I'm going to give you like this." And then he went where he owed people money. Just said, "Brother, can you forgive me? If I get money, I'm going to what? To to pay you back." And he went to the brothers and sisters that he wronged. He made peace with them. Made right and everything. After that, he got involved in an accident. &gt;&gt; What was that? You are not pigs. You are not dogs. We've got a soul where God speaks to us. &gt;&gt; Say, &gt;&gt; you know, sometimes, pastor Rodney, &gt;&gt; I don't want to say this, but you, you are my friends. I tell you, sometimes I don't hear a voice. I don't hear anything, but I just tell my wife, I say, you know, so and so is going to go and say this. And for sure like that, the person calls and says, exactly. But I can't explain it. I'm talking about declaration by signing. &gt;&gt; We are supernatural people. &gt;&gt; I'm being honest. &gt;&gt; One time I was standing pastor wrote me with a me I don't normally want to talk about my I just want to talk the word but it happens that that's the sermon that I'm preaching. So one time I was with a a a brother you know a a a deacon. No it was a brother. Yeah. A simple brother. So I just looked like this. I saw a brother. I don't know what was happening like in the church. So I was talking to the brother on on a Monday. So I said hey I don't think brother so and so is going to come to church again. Pastor the brother said pastor Mo what are you saying? I said ah something you know I can't explain but that brother I don't think we are together anymore. While I said that the deacon called me right there. Then I put it on loudspeaker. The brother said that he said pastor please can you help that brother says that brother came to me he says he does not want to came to come to church anymore. That brother was shocked. &gt;&gt; Pastor Moses how to deal we are we are super pastor when you see pastor Denz when you see pastor Rodney don't think that we are just no no no no God speaks. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Hey, &gt;&gt; God speaks to us. &gt;&gt; How many? We are supernatural beings. &gt;&gt; Even you, sister. How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; I remember pastor George Martin, he told me, you know, sometimes brothers, may God help us. Sometimes God speaks &gt;&gt; through our wives and sometimes we don't listen. We say, "No, I'm back again to support your sisters." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You listen. Pastor George Martin a brother came and said he wanted to borrow pastor George Martin money then pastor George Martin wanted to give him sister George Martins just said no d can I see you just put him aside Martin said please brother George don't give this brother the money won't come please and sister George Martin said no no no I'm the head of the family this I'm going to give you this is an honest brother I said okay okay it's fine that They arrived when when the brother said he was going to pay back the money did not come until pastor George Mati died. Do you understand? So now the sister went and said did I not tell you? Did I not tell you? Yes, we are the head of the house but these are God's daughters. Sometime God does not only speak to brothers, he can also speak to sisters. &gt;&gt; Say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Sometimes my wife comes and tells me things. How could you know it happens? How many can say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; Are we together friends? &gt;&gt; Huh? We are not prophets, Pastor Rodney. But we are supernatural. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God sometimes can reveal even things before they happen. &gt;&gt; God speaks. &gt;&gt; Can speak by the pit. He can speak when you are listening to the tape. He can speak when you are reading the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Declaration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Silent declaration that woman of Memphis that the son was dying. She was sick and he was she was reading. And then she saw it's exactly the setup and the scenario of her situation. And then she said, "I shunite. &gt;&gt; Where is Elijah?" &gt;&gt; What is that &gt;&gt; declaration by silence? She was reading the story of the Shudamite. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; We have overcome demons sometimes by reading the Bible, by listening to the tape, by reading the spoken word. &gt;&gt; God declares something. &gt;&gt; He can say, "Brother Andrews, you are healed of that house. Go home." And you you say, "Hallelujah." You hear a brother who is not called Andrew saying I'm healed. It's over. Why? A declaration by silence. &gt;&gt; You can see a situation which is in the spoken word. How many can say amen? Which is exactly like your situation. It's God declaring that you are healed. It's over. &gt;&gt; The taps are supernatural. The spoken word are supernatural. I remember brother Babs I want to close now. He gave a a Muslim in prison a spoken word. Are we together? And there was the pillar of fire and the Muslim had a what? A spinal problem. And then while the Muslim was reading he the Muslim said he saw the pillar of fire coming out of the pages of the spoken word coming. The Muslim wanted to run away and then it came on his back. Touch his back. He was healed and a Muslim came to brother Peps and said, "Brother Peps, there's something in you know how brothers who used to tell us, &gt;&gt; there's something in the book. There's something in this book." &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; We are not alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This message is powerful. &gt;&gt; The son of man is here. &gt;&gt; We are in the age of the son of man. &gt;&gt; How many can say &gt;&gt; hallelujah? I pray &gt;&gt; that you receive your heart as desires. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. &gt;&gt; Something must happen. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes God's things, pastor, they happen in a silent way. &gt;&gt; Great things happen in silence. &gt;&gt; Remember Elijah, he saw fire, but there was no God. He saw an earthquake, but there was no God. But there was a small still voice. How many can say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you my friend that don't are we together? &gt;&gt; You must keep secrets. I want to close now. Don't reveal everything. &gt;&gt; Huh? Because you get yourself in trouble. Brother Brham says the devil cannot what? Get what is in your heart. &gt;&gt; But he waits for you to say it. That's why sometimes most of our plans they don't go through. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the devil hears it. &gt;&gt; I don't have time to read quotations. Brother Brham says you know the the first book it was impersonated. The second B it was impersonated. But when it came to the third B there was silence. &gt;&gt; Why? Brother says if the devil ever got a hold of that seventh seal, he says he was going to do great damage. &gt;&gt; So do you see that why the seventh seal is spoken in mysteries is because God wanted did not want the devil to know because the devil was going to do great damage. So if God can hide it so that his plans cannot be damaged, what about our plans? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything about your life, you put it on Facebook. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm going to K. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to Australia, brother. That's why you are always in trouble. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; There will be great damage. How many can say amen? Can I read that for you? &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; I hope you are not going to stone me. &gt;&gt; I also preach on Facebook. But you must understand always on review preaching. Hear me. American say I want you to see what brother Brandham says. Hey pastor Rodney. When I saw this quotation I said Lord help me. Listen, I know some of you pastors have seen it in the message 7. God bless you, Pastor Adrian. He says, "But here is seven straight thunders right in a row." 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 That perfect number. Seven thunders in a row. &gt;&gt; Just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 straight. Brother Brham knocked on the pulpit seven times. Then he says heavens could not write that heavens can't know about it. &gt;&gt; Nothing else because there is nothing to go on. &gt;&gt; In another quote he says if a an angel made a move it might give away the secret. We must be secretive people. &gt;&gt; Nations have got secrets. Churches have got secrets. Families have got secret. Don't just devout. How many can say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was a relaxing time. It was so great till it was kept secret from the angels. &gt;&gt; Now, pastor Denzel, why if Satan should get a hold of it, he might do great damage. &gt;&gt; There is one thing he don't know. Now he can interpret anything he wants to to impersonate any kind of a gift. I hope you are learning. But he can't know this. It's not even written in the word. It's a total &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The angels everything shut up. If they made a move, it might give something away. So they just shut up, quit hopping and everything stopped. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I read this? Brother Branham says paragraph 258. Go to 258. Listen what Malachi 4 says. If you want something is brother Brham, not me. If you want something, huh? Now you will have if you want something to happen, you will have to take my word for this. If I'm planning on doing something, I know better than to tell anybody about it. Not that that person would tell it, but Satan will hear it. &gt;&gt; See, he can't get it in my heart there. As long as God has got it closed up &gt;&gt; with the Holy Spirit. So that's between me and God. See, he don't know nothing about it until you speak it. &gt;&gt; Then he hears it. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; I tell people, I will do a certain certain thing and watch the devil cut off every wheel he can to get there. &gt;&gt; Do you think see to beat me to it? Yes. &gt;&gt; But if I get the revelation from God &gt;&gt; and just don't say nothing about it, &gt;&gt; then it's different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? I met the right of he said I must come inside. I'm a millionaire now. And the devil hears it. How many are saying &gt;&gt; and they lose the election? &gt;&gt; The TV is gone. You were talking too much. How many have seen deals slipping in their fingers? How many have seen, let's be honest, even myself, I lost a lot of things because of talking. &gt;&gt; You see, even Joseph, I want to bring this. Yes, he was going to go to to prison, but he was talkative. Number one, they hated him. He knew this person hate me. Then he comes, I saw you, you were bowing down to me. Hey, the Bible says they hated him the more Then he comes again says I saw seven stars they met. He was making it worse. How many can say &gt;&gt; Joseph was what? &gt;&gt; And I also want to drop this pastor Rodley while we are here. Do you know that the devil does not use any other thing to attack you? You only have one temptation. Joseph had one temptation. All his problems that he went through, it was because of the jacket. How many knows that? &gt;&gt; Because when they saw the jacket, they were envious. They were jealousy. Then they took that jacket as well. Tim took him blood. They said to the father, "Look at is this the jacket of your son?" &gt;&gt; Do you see now? And then when he went to Portifa's house, &gt;&gt; he went to prison because of the jacket. &gt;&gt; When Portifa's wife wanted to rape him, Joseph ran away and grabbed the jacket. Hey And when father general came from work, how many can say amen? There was a story there and generals and policemen and everything and poor Joseph just came and then he saw policeman standing there. &gt;&gt; Hey, they said you I want the police said, "Can you answer me yes or no?" &gt;&gt; We are not talking about rape and what but answer me. Is this your jacket? Yes or no? When Joseph said, "That's my jacket." He went to hell. He went to prison. How many say amen? &gt;&gt; So his all problems and everything it was the &gt;&gt; So brother says you must guard where your temptation where your weak point is guard it. Put more there. &gt;&gt; Some people even when they repent it's just cigarettes. It's just cigarettes. Even if someone comes and preach from Zimbabwe others come and preach from Namibia when he comes to the altar it's cigarettes. How many is temper, someone is women, someone is money. So the devil won't waste time. He will just come where you have got a weakness. &gt;&gt; How many can say? &gt;&gt; So we see Joseph his problems on the jacket. &gt;&gt; So don't devout things. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to read my last scripture. I want you to see what happened in the Bible. I liked that 1st Samuel 10:16. Let's go there quickly. How many are being blessed? &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. So the seventh seal was revealed in silence. So we the children of God, we know what it is. That's why he always speaks in parables so that other people won't catch it. He says 1st Samuel chapter 10. Amen. 1 Samuel chapter 10. Hallelujah. 1st Samuel chapter 10 verse let's start from verse 15. Hallelujah. You must have tell your neighbor and say you must have information management. Don't just reveal things. Tell your neighbor you must have information what? &gt;&gt; Amen. I once preached a message information management. He says now and Saul's he says and Saul's uncle said tell me I pray thee what Samuel said unto you. We we know the story. Saul had gone and he was anointed to be the king over Israel. So when he was coming back his uncle was suspicious &gt;&gt; and then he says where we are tell I pray thee what Samuel said unto you. Verse 16. and saw said unto his uncle, listen to this, he told us plainly that the asses were found, &gt;&gt; but of the matter of the kingdom, where Samuel spake, he told you not. &gt;&gt; Brother, do you see now? &gt;&gt; So now, so he told his uncle plainly about the asses. He says the asses were found plainly. &gt;&gt; Are we together? But the matter of the kingdom, he did not say it. I want you to see the first seal. It was explained by brother Brham plainly. How many can say &gt;&gt; the white horse rider is the antichrist is the blainly. The second s it was said plainly. How many can say? says the same rider, are we together? He's now on the red horse. He's now using political power. And then when he came to the seventh to the third seal, he said it plainly &gt;&gt; says a measure of wheat for a penny. Are we together? He was now using a demon power. Are we together friends? The fourth is he comes on a pale horse. He was now what? A mixture of white, red and black. It was dead now. Are we together friends? Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was explained plainly. The fifth seal was explained plainly. Souls in the all those things. The sixth seal plainly. But when it came now to the seven, &gt;&gt; yes sir, &gt;&gt; they were silent. &gt;&gt; Why? It's the matter of the kingdom. Can you see? Even in Zimbabwe in 2008, we are not in Zimbabwe. We are talking. How many can say in the harmonized elections where people were voting for the MPs for the counelors for the president. So now they after the elections when they were explaining those who won the parliamentary elections they explained so and so one in har they were saying it plainly those who won who became counselors were explained plainly &gt;&gt; but the matter of the kingdom it took more than 3 months to explain the results it's the matter of the kingdom how many can say amen you don't devouge the matter of How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many are learning? &gt;&gt; How many are going to to silent declaration? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The 70 has been revealed. Are we are we together friends? So I just want to leave you with one quotation that I believe is going to be a blessing and then we call pastor pastor Adrien. How many were blessed? &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. How many are ready for this quotation? &gt;&gt; I just saw it. I just felt. Let me end with this one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Silent declaration. Let's see what brother Brham says here. I believe it's going to uplift somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
