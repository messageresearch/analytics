[0:10] Dad, God's masterpiece.
[0:12] God took the strength of a mountain, the
[0:15] majesty of a tree, the warmth of a
[0:18] summer sun, the calm of a quiet sea, the
[0:23] the generous soul of nature, the
[0:26] comforting arm of night, the wisdom of
[0:29] the ages, the power of the evil's
[0:32] flight. Then God combined all these
[0:35] qualities when there was nothing more to
[0:38] add. He knew his masterpiece was

[17:07] Glory.
[17:08] Jesus is alive.
[17:10] Amen.
[17:13] You know when you are just called to say
[17:15] something
[17:17] and that's skip you know we've been
[17:19] preaching for so many years but every
[17:21] time you are called to say something the
[17:23] heart skips the beat
[17:26] but this morning I just want to greet
[17:27] you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ.
[17:30] It isn't a privilege for us to be
[17:32] gathered like this
[17:34] in the grace of God.
[17:36] We have cherished this gospel for many
[17:39] years. I've seen many young men grow up
[17:41] in front of me. Many a young men become
[17:45] preachers.
[17:46] Amen.
[17:47] Many young men become evangelists.
[17:50] Many a young man become witnesses for
[17:53] Jesus Christ.
[17:55] The responsibility of a father
[17:57] is great.
[17:58] Hallelujah.
[17:59] And young man, when you look at
[18:03] yourself,
[18:05] think of how your father brought you up.
[18:07] Yes.
[18:08] One thing you can never do is to outgrow
[18:11] your father.
[18:12] Amen.
[18:14] Because you have a great responsibility.
[18:18] Never shake your responsibility
[18:21] because one day you are going to be
[18:24] answerable
[18:26] for your
[18:28] wrongdoings or for your uh mishaps.
[18:32] You know the prophet always taught us.
[18:37] It says you will answer for your
[18:40] children.
[18:41] You will answer for your neighbors.
[18:45] You will answer for your friends.
[18:49] So remember one thing you know I I have
[18:54] businesses in the in the CBD and we see
[18:57] something very very different. You know,
[18:59] in our days, uh, when we did something
[19:02] wrong, we knew we did something wrong
[19:05] and we'll try to run away from the
[19:07] elders.
[19:09] I started smoking when I was very young.
[19:12] But every time we took out a cigarette,
[19:14] we looked around first.
[19:17] We looked around first. And we had a
[19:20] cigarette. One day I had a cigarette
[19:22] burning in my pocket
[19:27] because okay, this man was an elderly
[19:30] man. I didn't know him. But one thing I
[19:33] knew, if he saw me with that cigarette,
[19:36] he wouldn't say this is not my son.
[19:40] You sure?
[19:41] You're sure to get something coming. And
[19:44] uh I tell you these are the things. And
[19:47] today you'll find young boys asking the
[19:50] old men for matches.
[19:53] And it's shocking.
[19:55] And I pray this morning that you young
[19:58] boys that are here, respect your elders.
[20:04] Respect those that are elder than you.
[20:07] Treat them like your father because
[20:09] you'll never ask your father for a
[20:11] match.
[20:12] I hope nobody's smoking.
[20:17] And uh this morning uh I'd like to
[20:20] remember our our pastor Ronnie, our
[20:23] spiritual father.
[20:26] And uh he has brought us thus far.
[20:29] And uh he must be proud this morning to
[20:34] see that his son has taken the reign.
[20:38] Praise the Lord. Like I said, I've seen
[20:40] many people grow. I've seen many people
[20:43] become preachers. many many of them and
[20:46] today I'm I'm glad that I can sit and
[20:49] listen for the foundations are built
[20:52] were built and we can listen to the ones
[20:54] that we grew up with where we grew up.
[20:58] So this morning for all the fathers I
[21:01] want to say God bless you.
[21:04] May you continue with the work as a
[21:06] father because you grow old you're still
[21:08] a father.
[21:09] If you're still young you're still a
[21:11] father. Yes.
[21:12] And so just grow old in the grace of
[21:14] God. The prophet says somebody some
[21:18] sometimes you can grow old and not and
[21:21] not see death. You'll make it in the
[21:24] rapture. So just pray that you can make
[21:25] it in the rapture. And that is our
[21:27] desire is to make it in the rapture.
[21:30] Take your responsibility in your home.
[21:32] Take your responsibility outside and see
[21:35] that that you can portray Jesus Christ
[21:39] all the time. May God bless you. Enjoy
[21:41] your day every father this morning.
[21:50] Amen. Thank you, brother Sunonny.
[21:52] Amen. You appreciate those words of
[21:53] wisdom.
[21:54] Amen. You know, brother Brandham, when
[21:56] he was talking about the older men and
[21:58] uh I think it was TL Osborne came to
[22:00] him, he said, "It'll do you good to go
[22:02] sit under that great oak tree talking
[22:05] about FF Bosworth because these men have
[22:07] come through experiences." Amen.
[22:09] Amen. So, our brother Sunny has been in
[22:10] the ministry for a long time, served in
[22:12] the kingdom of God. Amen. And I pray the
[22:15] Lord will continue to keep him. Amen.
[22:17] Let's stand together for the reading of
[22:18] the word. Thank you, band. Amen.
[22:39] Seeing that it's Father's Day, we'll
[22:40] center our thoughts around that. Amen.
[22:43] Let's turn to Proverbs chapter 20 and
[22:45] verse 5.
[22:54] Amen. Proverbs chapter 20 and verse 5
[22:56] says, "Counsel in the heart of man is
[22:59] like deep water."
[23:02] Amen.
[23:03] Now consider what we are reading.
[23:09] If you want the counsel that's in the
[23:10] heart of a man, it's like deep water.
[23:13] And not everybody likes to go into deep
[23:15] water.
[23:17] But if you really want that godly
[23:19] counsel, you've got to get into deep
[23:21] water. Amen. But a man of understanding
[23:25] will draw it out. So we know how to draw
[23:28] out that good counsel. Praise the Lord.
[23:32] Most men will proclaim everyone his own
[23:35] goodness.
[23:36] There's tons of preachers now
[23:40] that's promoting themselves.
[23:42] Most men will proclaim everyone his own
[23:44] goodness. But a faithful man who can
[23:48] find
[23:51] Amen. How does God measure faithfulness?
[23:54] By what we have done with the promised
[23:56] word.
[23:58] But who can find a faithful man? We're
[24:00] taking that from what Jesus is saying.
[24:02] Amen.
[24:04] Well done, good and faithful servant.
[24:07] Why? They handled what was given to them
[24:11] well.
[24:13] The just man walketh in his integrity.
[24:15] His children are blessed after him. So
[24:18] you see what what a heritage we are
[24:21] giving our children because your
[24:23] children start to walk in your
[24:25] blessings.
[24:26] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's go to uh
[24:29] Genesis chapter 18. Powerful, powerful,
[24:31] powerful scripture because Genesis 18 is
[24:34] typing Revelation 10.
[24:38] Elohim coming in the flesh.
[24:40] Hallelujah. Amen. And it is in this
[24:44] chapter that the Lord speaks a word over
[24:47] Abraham.
[24:49] His wife is barren. The man is old. He
[24:52] can't reproduce his life. But look at
[24:54] what he says. And the Lord God, let's
[24:57] read from verse 17. And the Lord God,
[24:59] And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from
[25:01] Abraham that thing which I do?"
[25:05] Seeing that Abraham, now watch, he
[25:08] speaks what he wants to see.
[25:09] Hallelujah.
[25:10] He's not speaking this man's condition.
[25:13] Seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[25:15] a great and mighty nation,
[25:17] and all the nations of the earth shall
[25:19] be blessed in him. Amen.
[25:22] A man who can't have children,
[25:24] his wife is barren. Speak over your
[25:27] situation.
[25:28] No matter how dead it is, speak over
[25:30] your situation.
[25:32] For I know him. Or there's a father who
[25:35] knows his children. Father knows the
[25:37] caliber that's within you.
[25:39] Father knows the fruit he's put within
[25:41] you. I know him that he will command his
[25:44] children
[25:47] and his household after him. And they
[25:50] shall keep the way of the Lord to do
[25:53] justice and judgment that the Lord may
[25:56] bring upon Abraham that which he had
[25:58] spoken of him. Amen. The Lord blessings
[26:01] to the reading of his word. You may be
[26:02] seated.
[26:06] Isn't that powerful?
[26:08] Amen. You say, why? Why is that
[26:11] powerful?
[26:13] God had wanted to work through Adam,
[26:16] but because of the fall, he couldn't
[26:18] work through Adam.
[26:20] Amen. Then you find there was a decline
[26:23] of mankind
[26:24] all the way to the time of Noah when
[26:26] Noah alone found grace in the eyes of
[26:28] the Lord. Then God destroyed the earth
[26:30] with water and now he was looking for a
[26:33] man that he could work through
[26:36] and he had now found a man by the name
[26:39] of Abraham.
[26:41] But God was going to take a portion of
[26:42] his name. And when God is giving him a
[26:46] portion of his name and changing it to
[26:47] Abraham, brother Brandham's saying he is
[26:50] adopting
[26:52] Abraham by giving him a part of his own
[26:54] name.
[26:56] Hallelujah. Even with Sarah, he puts the
[27:00] H in there.
[27:01] With Abraham, he puts the H in there.
[27:03] Hallelujah.
[27:05] So, we are finding here that God found a
[27:07] man that he could work through.
[27:10] A man without any capabilities to do
[27:12] what was God in God's mind physically it
[27:15] was impossible.
[27:18] Even when he had the strength to
[27:19] reproduce his life, he he reproduced it
[27:22] the wrong way by listening to Sarah.
[27:26] Hallelujah.
[27:28] Now, sometimes people say, and I know
[27:30] it's a good advice, don't marry the
[27:32] wrong wife
[27:34] because your life will be hard.
[27:37] Marry somebody who believes like you.
[27:40] The Bible says talking about marriage,
[27:42] how can two walk together except they be
[27:45] agreed?
[27:47] Now I tell you that two Christians can
[27:50] marry. One is a message believer, one is
[27:53] a denominational believer, but their
[27:55] father is not the same.
[28:00] Hallelujah.
[28:02] Their father is not the same. Praise the
[28:04] Lord. So what we are finding you can
[28:07] have the correct wife.
[28:10] Who would disagree that Eve was the
[28:12] perfect wife for Adam?
[28:16] She was the perfect one. He said this is
[28:19] bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh. So
[28:22] the the question then doesn't come is is
[28:25] she the right one. The question is is
[28:27] she able to listen to her head?
[28:33] That is the question.
[28:36] Is she able to take on his spirit?
[28:41] That's the mystery of marriage.
[28:44] She must take on his spirit because any
[28:47] spirit is his nature, his character.
[28:51] It is ridiculous that now in the 21st
[28:53] century, the wives are trying to make
[28:55] the men like them.
[28:57] But the pattern is designed for the
[28:59] woman to be like the man because she was
[29:01] taken out of man.
[29:03] Yes sir. So they come with independent
[29:05] movements and all of these movements
[29:07] coming out of the plan of God.
[29:10] But God's original design and purpose
[29:12] was she was taken out of man.
[29:17] But she must reflect the character of
[29:19] the man.
[29:20] We're not preaching on marriage this
[29:21] morning. Amen. But Amen. I just thought
[29:23] we'll throw that in there. So wives, if
[29:25] you're going contrary to what your
[29:26] husband's vision is and purpose and plan
[29:28] is, you've got to align
[29:32] with his vision,
[29:34] right? How do you become the fifth
[29:36] gospel? Where are you getting your
[29:37] gospel from? Where are you getting your
[29:39] teaching from? You've got to get it from
[29:41] your head.
[29:44] We empower you by saying yes to the
[29:46] fifth gospel. You are teaching the
[29:47] children. But if you are not in
[29:49] subjection and receiving teaching from
[29:51] your husband,
[29:53] he's the one who sets the teaching at
[29:54] home. He's the one who sets the
[29:56] instruction at home.
[29:58] You are basically feeding off him. He's
[30:00] the one that establishes the prayer
[30:02] altar at home. He is the one that
[30:03] establishes the Bible reading at home.
[30:08] So the wife is only and and if you're
[30:10] saying that is a wrong teaching, I'll
[30:12] have you to know that God wants us to
[30:14] take his spirit and we are the bride of
[30:16] Christ, but he wants us to take his
[30:18] spirit.
[30:22] Praise the Lord.
[30:25] In 1 Corinthians chapter 4:15,
[30:28] and I'm so glad that we have had a
[30:32] spiritual father in this house.
[30:34] There are many churches
[30:37] but go and trace their roots.
[30:39] You'll see their root starts with them
[30:42] because they haven't had a spiritual
[30:44] father.
[30:46] Hear what the apostle Paul is saying in
[30:48] 1 Corinthians chapter 4:15. For though
[30:51] you have 10,000 instructors in Christ,
[30:56] yet have you not many fathers.
[30:59] Now watch what Paul is saying next. For
[31:02] in Christ I have begotten you through
[31:05] the gospel.
[31:08] So where is the seed coming through?
[31:11] Through the apostle Paul
[31:16] and I tell you we've had another mighty
[31:18] prophet in the land
[31:21] who amen through Christ has begotten us
[31:24] through the gospel.
[31:27] Hallelujah.
[31:28] Praise the Lord. So there can be many
[31:30] instructors but whether people have
[31:32] spiritual fathers
[31:35] they don't know who their spiritual
[31:36] father is.
[31:38] Where are you getting your teaching? Who
[31:40] is your source? Where are you getting
[31:41] your resource from? They don't have a
[31:44] spiritual father.
[31:47] Praise the Lord.
[31:48] Yeah. You know, amen. That the apostle
[31:52] Paul is also telling us that I planted
[31:56] here in this church. Pastor Ronnie
[31:58] planted,
[32:00] ministries are watering,
[32:02] but it's God who's giving the increase.
[32:05] Praise the Lord. So, a church ought to
[32:08] have, Amen, a continuity
[32:11] because the life of the church is always
[32:13] in the youth.
[32:17] We can't be, I say this again this week,
[32:19] we can't be building ministries where
[32:21] the pastor is elevated to a godlike
[32:23] status
[32:24] and the people are left impoverished.
[32:31] It should be the other way around
[32:33] because when you are having a good time
[32:35] on a Saturday night, there is one person
[32:38] who is laboring in the kitchen of God to
[32:41] prepare a sermon spiritually for you.
[32:44] And you tell me, is that not a servant?
[32:47] That while the others are having a good
[32:49] time.
[32:51] That's why he's called a servant.
[32:55] Here to serve the people, not be lords
[32:58] over God's heritage.
[33:04] Amen. Hallelujah.
[33:05] Amen.
[33:06] So in Hebrews chapter 12,
[33:10] I'm just laying these scriptures 9-10.
[33:13] Furthermore, we have had fathers of our
[33:15] flesh which corrected us, and we gave
[33:19] them reverence.
[33:21] Shall we not much rather be in
[33:23] subjection unto the father of spirits?
[33:25] Hallelujah.
[33:29] You see, our earthly father and mother
[33:30] gave us this body, but God gave us our
[33:33] spirit. Now we were so obedient to the
[33:36] earthly father and mother. He's saying
[33:37] what about your spirit?
[33:39] The father of your spirit.
[33:41] Can we not be obedient to him?
[33:45] And live. Why? The flesh that they the
[33:48] flesh body our parents gave us is dying.
[33:52] Whether you choose to believe it or not,
[33:54] whether you think you are in the prime
[33:56] of your life, death is no respector of
[33:58] person.
[34:00] You've seen after co young people, boys,
[34:04] young girls taken away. 10 years old, 11
[34:07] years old.
[34:09] Amen. Death is not for the old.
[34:15] No man knows the day he's going to leave
[34:16] the earth.
[34:18] Hallelujah.
[34:20] He says, "For they verily for a few days
[34:24] chasened us after their own pleasure,
[34:27] but he for our profit that we might be
[34:30] partakers of his holiness."
[34:33] Earthly fathers wanted to chasen us so
[34:35] that they can get the benefit off of us.
[34:37] But he's saying when God chastens us,
[34:39] he's doing it out for our benefit so
[34:42] that we become partakers of his
[34:44] holiness.
[34:47] You see why people are struggling in the
[34:49] flesh, struggling with abbots,
[34:51] struggling with things of their life.
[34:52] They are not willing to to surrender
[34:55] their spirit to God
[34:57] to make them holy.
[35:01] Now, if I had a bunny chow here and I
[35:04] told you partake of it,
[35:07] you must come and share this bunny chow.
[35:09] That's the best bunny chows. When you
[35:12] put it on the hood of the car, you got a
[35:14] high school coke there and you're both
[35:17] fighting for that food. The last piece
[35:19] you're hoping, he says you have it,
[35:22] right? But that's what it becomes part.
[35:24] So he has given us holiness. He's put
[35:26] the holiness here and he says become
[35:29] partakers of it.
[35:31] But sometimes you're not willing to
[35:33] surrender.
[35:35] So then you're starving spiritually.
[35:37] Praise the Lord. Now we know as we have
[35:39] been saying God was Elohim. Elohim means
[35:42] allsufficient one.
[35:45] Amen. He is self- sustaining.
[35:48] God is source and sustainer of
[35:49] everything he created. And he is the
[35:52] father of all things.
[35:54] Hallelujah. He's the father of creation.
[35:57] Now Malachi 2:10 says, "Have we not have
[36:00] we not all one father? Did not God
[36:03] create us? Why do we profane the
[36:05] covenant of our fathers by breaking
[36:07] faith with one another? So God is called
[36:10] father and not mother.
[36:12] People like to call mother earth and
[36:14] mother this, mother Mary.
[36:17] But God is our father.
[36:18] Amen.
[36:19] Masculine.
[36:21] Amen.
[36:22] Praise the Lord.
[36:25] So he's saying, Amen. It has to do with
[36:26] function. The word father has to do with
[36:28] function. He's source and sustainer. And
[36:31] everything came from father.
[36:39] If you got a father in your house,
[36:42] everything ought to come from the
[36:43] father. That's God's design.
[36:46] If all the source of sustenance and the
[36:50] resources are not coming from the
[36:52] father, that is a house that is not
[36:54] designed on the kingdom principles of
[36:56] God.
[36:57] Somebody say amen. Amen.
[37:01] Men, you are supposed to be the sole
[37:04] provider at home.
[37:06] If there's a need, the wife can assist
[37:08] you by working to assist you, but the
[37:12] man's responsibility is to be the
[37:14] provider.
[37:15] Come on. I need the men to say amen to
[37:17] that.
[37:18] The man's responsibility is to be the
[37:20] protector.
[37:22] You say protect what? You you perform
[37:24] gates around your house and you protect
[37:26] what comes into that house and what goes
[37:29] out of that house.
[37:30] Especially today with modern day social
[37:32] media, you ought to be protecting what
[37:34] comes into the house
[37:37] because people can be locked up in their
[37:39] bedroom, but things are coming through
[37:41] the house. Spirits are coming through
[37:42] the house. Amen. And you've got to be
[37:44] vigilant in this hour because Satan,
[37:47] your adversary, is coming like a roaring
[37:49] lion seeking to devour the children.
[37:54] You don't know, but you've got somebody
[37:56] in the room gambling,
[37:59] doing soccer bits.
[38:00] Before you had to go into a public
[38:02] place, hide, put a hat, disguise
[38:04] yourself to go and gamble.
[38:07] Amen.
[38:08] Now you can sit in the comfort of your
[38:10] bedroom and start gambling.
[38:12] Let me do a soccer bit.
[38:15] Amen. You're sitting in your room. You
[38:18] went in there so happy.
[38:22] You know people support teams.
[38:25] Their team could have lost 10 times but
[38:27] the next match they going joyful there
[38:31] with some hope.
[38:34] But people one two times a pastor
[38:36] rebukes them. They don't want to come.
[38:39] Why you don't have the same attitude
[38:40] with your team?
[38:43] You're still so loyal.
[38:45] They haven't won something in how many
[38:47] years, brother Tyson?
[38:50] But you're still loyal to the team. I
[38:53] don't even know who he supports. I'm
[38:54] just using him. Amen.
[38:59] People like colorful devils.
[39:05] Amen. They like colorful ones.
[39:09] Praise the Lord.
[39:11] But we are so faithful to keep
[39:13] supporting what can sustain us. That's
[39:15] right.
[39:18] But the word of God that's coming from
[39:19] the pilpit, we can't come to sustain
[39:21] ourselves.
[39:25] Praise the Lord.
[39:27] Let's talk truth.
[39:29] Let's talk truth.
[39:31] Church is full tonight
[39:32] or this morning. Come on a Wednesday
[39:36] and see. Now, nobody is given a pass to
[39:41] be excluded from a Wednesday service. I
[39:44] certainly didn't issue it out. Brother
[39:45] Joshua, did you issue it out? Brother
[39:47] Sunny, did you issue it out?
[39:49] Excusing anyone from being in church.
[39:53] I've got new people coming into the
[39:55] church. Faithful every Wednesday and
[39:57] every Sunday will not miss a service.
[40:00] But I've got old people. They say, "I'm
[40:02] old and now I'm cold."
[40:07] Praise the Lord. We ought to have a
[40:09] fervent desire to come into the house of
[40:11] God. Once we get a revelation why we are
[40:14] coming into the house of God, these
[40:16] things become non-negotiable.
[40:18] I've got to go into the house of the
[40:20] Lord to worship.
[40:24] Praise the Lord. No problem. Do you know
[40:26] what the 11th hour workers?
[40:28] You ever heard about 11th hour workers?
[40:31] God will pull in the 11th hour workers
[40:33] because there are no laborers here on a
[40:35] Wednesday. God will pull in the 11th
[40:36] hour workers and give them the same pay.
[40:43] Praise the Lord.
[40:44] Hallelujah.
[40:46] Hallelujah.
[40:48] Now look at our heavenly father. I got a
[40:50] very short quote I want to read and the
[40:52] prophet details why he came in the form
[40:54] that he came the our God which spoke
[40:56] about Elohim. Right? And we read here
[41:00] then God conceived his thoughts. He
[41:02] said, "I'll take their place." Talking
[41:04] about Adam and Eve. I'll take their
[41:06] place. I'll die in theirstead. That's my
[41:09] boy.
[41:12] Hallelujah.
[41:14] How many of you got sons here?
[41:16] Let somebody touch your son.
[41:18] Then you watch the father's nature come
[41:20] out.
[41:21] That's my boy.
[41:22] If anyone's going to correct him, I'm
[41:24] going to correct him. If there's anyone
[41:26] going to teach him, I'm going to teach
[41:27] him.
[41:29] So what is that? Brother Sunny Smith. He
[41:31] takes personal responsibility
[41:34] over what came out out of him.
[41:38] Now how much more God we came out of
[41:40] God.
[41:40] Hallelujah.
[41:41] He takes personal responsibility over
[41:43] every one of us.
[41:46] That's my boy. I can't let him go like
[41:48] that.
[41:51] Do you know sons? Let me talk to you
[41:54] daughters. When your father is
[41:55] correcting you,
[41:57] you think it's easy to correct you, but
[42:00] his heart on the inside is he wants you
[42:02] to come into his image and likeness.
[42:04] He wants you to get his thoughts of his
[42:07] life for you that he has planned out.
[42:10] I can't let him go like that. That's my
[42:12] girl.
[42:14] When the father calls a pastor to come
[42:16] and correct you and to to give you some
[42:18] admonition, don't think it's the end of
[42:20] the world. All they want you is to
[42:22] correct your path. come to the right
[42:24] path.
[42:25] But father, let me tell you something
[42:26] about father's love. He will never cut
[42:29] off the source of father's love.
[42:31] I don't like this modernistic trend that
[42:33] say the day you leave this house, you
[42:35] are not my child anymore. That's not
[42:36] God's principle.
[42:38] A father will never cut off his
[42:39] children.
[42:40] A father will always love his children
[42:42] because a father is an attribute of God.
[42:44] No matter how far they are gone. Amen.
[42:47] His heart will always reach out to the
[42:48] children. Amen.
[42:50] Amen.
[42:52] Look at our father what he did. I'm
[42:54] talking about God our father. I'll die
[42:56] in each place. He said just in it. Amen.
[42:59] I'll put emnitude between thy seed and
[43:01] the serpent's seed and your seed shall
[43:03] bruise the serpent's head.
[43:05] Amen.
[43:05] Praise the Lord.
[43:08] Amen. In other words, I will overshadow
[43:10] a virgin someday and come down and be
[43:12] made flesh
[43:13] myself and I'll take the sinner's place.
[43:16] Man was made in the image of God. And
[43:18] then God was made in the image of man to
[43:20] redeem man back to himself.
[43:23] That's why Jesus Christ came in the
[43:25] flesh
[43:26] to redeem man back to himself.
[43:29] God had taken his place. That's how I
[43:31] know Jesus is God. That's right.
[43:35] Amen. Let's read Ephesians 6 and1. Amen.
[43:38] I need to go quick. Amen. Hallelujah. I
[43:41] know some of you got plans to take your
[43:43] fathers out. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm
[43:46] certain brother Romesh already got
[43:48] plans. He's loved by his daughters.
[43:50] Amen. I'm sure he's going to get spoiled
[43:52] today. Amen. But we're not going to rush
[43:54] unnecessarily.
[43:56] Hallelujah. I know how you love the
[43:58] word.
[43:59] Amen.
[43:59] Amen. I know how some of you are going
[44:01] to ask how you gave me half chicken
[44:02] today.
[44:04] Amen. Because you like full pack.
[44:06] Praise the Lord. Ephesians 6 and 1 to4
[44:10] is not how long the service is, it's
[44:12] about how much you can get out of the
[44:13] service.
[44:15] Ephesians 6:1-4 children. Straight away
[44:18] a chapter is directed to children.
[44:22] Obey your parents in the Lord for this
[44:24] is right.
[44:29] Now children like to tell their parents
[44:30] that they are wrong but the Bible is
[44:33] saying this is right.
[44:35] So when it's saying obey, sometimes you
[44:37] may not understand the instruction
[44:39] coming from your father
[44:42] but it says obey it.
[44:45] To obey is better than sacrifice.
[44:48] Praise the Lord.
[44:50] Honor thy father and mother.
[44:54] Esteem high.
[44:56] Hallelujah.
[44:58] Honor thy father and mother.
[45:02] I don't have time to get into this, but
[45:04] do me a favor. Go type up fatherless.
[45:10] There's a problem in the world today
[45:12] because of people who have no fathers.
[45:14] And it's not because the fathers have
[45:16] died. Yes, some fathers pass away. We
[45:18] remember Amen. the loved ones that have
[45:20] gone on before us. We remember brother
[45:22] Dicki. We remember Amen. Pastor Ronnie.
[45:25] We remember Sean. Any other fathers I'm
[45:27] missing out here?
[45:30] Amen.
[45:32] We remember the fathers. But there is a
[45:34] generation that has come up now. Their
[45:37] fathers are alive but they are
[45:39] fatherless because the fathers shook
[45:42] their responsibilities.
[45:44] They have not guided their children.
[45:47] It says honor thy father. So why I'm
[45:49] saying go type up fatherlessness or
[45:52] fatherless and go watch what it's even
[45:55] in the commandments that we must take
[45:57] care of the fatherless
[45:59] and attached every time you see the word
[46:01] fatherless it speaks about widows.
[46:04] Why? Both the fatherless
[46:07] and the widow don't have headship.
[46:12] So he says even when you are when you
[46:14] are reaping your field and you forgot a
[46:16] sheath in the field, he says don't go
[46:18] back for it. Leave it for the fatherless
[46:21] and the widows.
[46:23] You remember how Nomi told Ruth that's
[46:26] what they they got it from there from
[46:28] the Lord's commandment. And he says, "Oh
[46:31] my, I I tell you, please go and read
[46:33] about fatherless
[46:35] and widows." He says, "Dare you mistreat
[46:38] the fatherless."
[46:39] This is Bible. Now he says, "Dare you
[46:42] mistreat the fatherless and the widows."
[46:45] You know what he says?
[46:47] God will make you fatherless and a
[46:49] widow.
[46:52] I don't have time to give you the I can
[46:54] put the quote up on the group if you
[46:56] want.
[46:57] He says if you mistreat the fatherless,
[46:59] you see God's passion for the
[47:01] fatherless.
[47:02] Now, nowhere in the Bible does he talk
[47:04] about the motherless.
[47:09] There is a problem in the world today
[47:11] because fathers have become delinquent.
[47:15] They say most of the people in prison
[47:17] because they didn't have a steady home,
[47:18] a father that was there to lead them, to
[47:20] guide them, to give them instruction.
[47:26] When a father is removed from the home,
[47:30] God takes it very seriously.
[47:35] Nowhere. Go and read it again. There's
[47:38] no way God makes reference to the
[47:39] motherless. He's talking about the
[47:42] fatherless alone because he understands
[47:45] the seriousness of headship of having a
[47:48] father.
[47:50] So who will do that? Go and type up
[47:51] fatherless in your Bible and read from
[47:55] when God is giving the commandments and
[47:57] see what he is saying about the
[47:58] fatherless and the widows. Amen.
[48:01] Hallelujah.
[48:03] Why would he put it there in the
[48:04] commandment? He says, "Honor thy father
[48:06] and their mother, which is the first
[48:07] commandment with promise." What is that
[48:09] promise? That it may be well with thee.
[48:14] Number one, it may be well with thee. So
[48:17] if you tell me what do you mean about
[48:19] well with me? Well, talk to me about
[48:21] your finances. If you want your finances
[48:23] to be well, what does it says?
[48:26] We tie well with thee just to living
[48:29] long. But he says in all aspects of your
[48:31] life, it'll be well with you.
[48:34] And he says, and thou mayest live long
[48:37] on the earth.
[48:39] Amen. So there's a double benefit there.
[48:42] In all your ways, you shall prosper
[48:45] and you shall have long life.
[48:47] And he's a joining word.
[48:51] Praise the Lord.
[48:53] And you fathers, now this is important
[48:55] as well. If we're going to speak to the
[48:56] children, we must speak to the fathers.
[48:58] Fathers, provoke not your children.
[49:04] To wrath,
[49:06] but bring them up in the nurture and
[49:07] admonition of the Lord. Don't apply the
[49:09] message like a law.
[49:11] Thou shalt do this. Thou shalt do that.
[49:14] Beat them up. If they beat them into
[49:16] submission, you know what you're causing
[49:17] them to do? to hate your teaching.
[49:22] How many people have left the message
[49:24] because they were forced and whipped
[49:25] into doing things?
[49:27] They didn't understand why they had to
[49:29] do it.
[49:32] Let me tell you, there's some older
[49:34] people yet still still rebelling because
[49:36] of how they were brought up. Still can't
[49:39] uh be under some mission because how
[49:41] they were brought up.
[49:46] those things linger. Praise the Lord. He
[49:50] says, "But bring them up in the nurture
[49:52] and admonition of the Lord.
[49:55] Tell them why. Teach them why."
[49:58] The Bible says, "Train them up in the
[50:00] ways of the Lord." How many of you when
[50:02] you're giving your son weights, you
[50:03] first give him 10 kg. If he can't lift
[50:05] the 10 kg, you take a cane and you give
[50:07] him.
[50:09] No. But he says, "Train him up.
[50:11] First give him 5 kg. Let him build a
[50:14] muscle for the 5 kg. Then you train him
[50:17] and you give him the 10 kg.
[50:19] Amen. Then you give him the 20 kg.
[50:23] But train them up in the ways of the
[50:25] Lord. Otherwise, you're going to drive
[50:27] them away and make them hate the very
[50:29] message that was sent to deliver us.
[50:31] And God is saying he wants you to teach
[50:33] your children. Look at how he said, "I
[50:35] know that Abraham will teach his
[50:37] children."
[50:38] And God will hold many men in this
[50:40] message accountable for taking this word
[50:42] as a law and beating the family with it.
[50:50] You know why? We lead by example.
[50:55] Colossians 3 and 20:21. Children, obey
[50:58] your parents in all things, for this is
[51:02] well pleasing unto the Lord.
[51:04] Fathers, provoke not your children to
[51:07] anger, lest they be discouraged.
[51:11] Hear
[51:13] what brother Brandham is saying now in
[51:14] uh YM he says I've got nine brothers now
[51:17] this is why I'm putting this in here we
[51:19] can't treat all the children the same
[51:23] all of them have different temperaments
[51:26] all of them have different nature
[51:28] there's one if you score them he'll like
[51:30] water off a duck's back he's fine the
[51:32] other one he'll go preserved
[51:35] he takes it very hard
[51:38] amen
[51:40] praise the Lord He says, "There's one
[51:42] here that looks like me and he's not a
[51:44] preacher in the bunch. I've got another
[51:46] brother next to me. Great, big, tall,
[51:47] blonde, blue-eyed, fair skin. Why? He
[51:50] don't like the things I do."
[51:53] Our appetites are not the same. Our
[51:55] desires is not the same. But his daddy
[51:58] is my daddy.
[52:00] I say we apply that in the message of
[52:02] the hour. We find faults with all our
[52:04] brothers and our sisters. We we don't
[52:06] like one another's differences, but it's
[52:08] our differences. We are coming from the
[52:10] same source.
[52:14] His daddy is my daddy.
[52:18] If we can come with that attitude,
[52:21] then we don't start cutting off people.
[52:26] If we don't start kicking people to the
[52:28] curb,
[52:30] okay, brother, that's fine. That's the
[52:32] way you like it. You like apple pie. I
[52:36] can't stand the taste of apple pie. But
[52:38] that's your the way you are designed.
[52:42] Some people, let me put it in ways that
[52:44] may be more refreshing to you. Some
[52:46] people just love seals, thunders, vials,
[52:49] trumpets. That's what excites them.
[52:54] Others may like baptism. Others may like
[52:56] godhead.
[52:57] Different portions of the word.
[53:00] But we're all brothers and sisters.
[53:03] Amen. Hallelujah. Now, this brother
[53:06] that's eating from the seals, he opened
[53:08] it and he ate from the seals.
[53:11] Like if somebody opened your Doritos
[53:13] now,
[53:15] he's eating from it. He's enjoying it.
[53:17] You can't go and tell him, "I know that
[53:19] Doritos is in the cupboard. It's not
[53:20] open.
[53:27] You didn't open it."
[53:29] Praise the Lord.
[53:31] Now, we've got to develop an appetite
[53:33] for the word.
[53:34] Amen.
[53:35] We've got to start to develop our
[53:37] appetite for the deeper things of God.
[53:41] Like if I gave pass the mic around and I
[53:43] ask somebody, please tell me your
[53:44] understanding of the seven seals and the
[53:47] seven thunders.
[53:49] Amen. But we ought to come to a place
[53:52] where when you give you the mic, you can
[53:54] just speak it freely.
[53:56] Brother, this is what it means. This is
[53:57] what it is. This is the open book that
[53:59] was sent for us to understand it.
[54:02] Praise the Lord.
[54:04] So we understanding the thought that all
[54:06] of us are not made the same yet we are
[54:09] coming from the same source. Praise the
[54:11] Lord.
[54:15] Now
[54:17] the prophet is going to give us an
[54:18] illustration and he's going to tie it in
[54:21] with the nature of God and how he wants
[54:22] us to behave. He says remember friends I
[54:25] love you and I must be honest with you.
[54:27] I have a little boy here. He's talking
[54:29] about Billy Paul. He's on the platform.
[54:32] I have him with me. If you want to love
[54:34] somebody,
[54:37] if it's between me or he,
[54:40] he says you love him.
[54:44] Hello.
[54:46] Watch where he's going to take this
[54:47] thought. Now that's my boy. And if our
[54:50] heavenly father wants me to love
[54:52] somebody between he or you, here what
[54:55] he's saying. If God wants you to love
[54:58] him or your brother,
[55:02] he says, "Love you."
[55:07] No issue going and saying, "Lord, I love
[55:08] you. I love you, but you hate your
[55:10] brother."
[55:11] He says, "God would prefer you love your
[55:13] brother."
[55:14] Oh, who's reading this?
[55:16] God is saying, "I prefer you love your
[55:19] brother.
[55:22] You're his children." And you see,
[55:23] wouldn't you rather someone love your
[55:25] children than to love you anytime?
[55:28] Well, our heavenly father, what about
[55:30] him? If we being kind know how to do
[55:32] good things for our children, say, "I
[55:34] love you and I'm here to help you."
[55:37] Right?
[55:40] So, he says, "We've got to face up to
[55:42] responsibilities." Sometimes it takes a
[55:44] very hideoff of us to do that as a
[55:46] father to face up to the responsibility
[55:49] to give your child a whipping.
[55:52] No. 21st century, we don't whoop
[55:54] anymore.
[55:56] 21st century. Why you looked at him like
[55:59] that? See, he's crying there now.
[56:03] You gave him such a bad look.
[56:09] Hey,
[56:10] I saw another article there. They got
[56:12] two pictures. A man from the 1940s in
[56:16] military fighting World War II. this
[56:18] other fellow from the 21st century
[56:20] crying that his Starbucks is not the
[56:22] right order.
[56:26] Generations have weakened.
[56:30] Amen.
[56:31] People in war had their their limbs torn
[56:34] off, but they were real men, rugged men
[56:36] standing there to defend their country,
[56:38] standing there to defend their families.
[56:43] Praise the Lord.
[56:45] He says, "But as a father and mother,
[56:47] you've got to face the responsibility of
[56:49] raising that child." Remember, God put
[56:52] that boy into your care, that girl into
[56:54] your care. He wants you to raise them up
[56:56] in the ways of the Lord. Now, listen to
[56:58] me. Parents, don't neglect raising your
[57:00] children in the ways of the Lord.
[57:04] You can do many other things for them,
[57:06] but that is one thing that has eternal
[57:08] value.
[57:10] Don't strive for the other things. first
[57:12] establish the word of God in their
[57:14] hearts.
[57:18] It says
[57:21] the Bible says spare the royal spoil
[57:22] your son. And that still stands good in
[57:24] the sight of every psychologist there is
[57:26] in the world. That still remains God's
[57:29] truth.
[57:31] Right? If there had been more of that
[57:34] practiced, we wouldn't have had so much
[57:35] juvenile delinquency and stuff and the
[57:37] rot we got in the world today. But the
[57:40] whole golden rule of the whole room has
[57:41] been broken long time ago. And they let
[57:43] the kids do whatever they want. You know
[57:46] what? This, let's assume this is a
[57:49] corner.
[57:52] Doesn't replace a good spanking.
[57:54] Now they say go in a naughty corner.
[57:58] This fell think he's so nice here. No
[57:59] hiding. I'll stand there for how long
[58:01] you want me to. But give him a hiding
[58:04] one time.
[58:07] I remember this. I'm going to share you
[58:08] with the secret. Now, we'll keep the
[58:10] secret.
[58:12] YouTube, you keep the secret.
[58:14] Ask my mother. Apparently, I had very
[58:17] colorful words growing up.
[58:20] I used to speak in tongues.
[58:25] I don't know why. I think maybe I don't
[58:26] know if I picked it up from the
[58:27] neighbors or whatever.
[58:31] But I remember my father had a cure for
[58:33] speaking in tongues.
[58:35] One day he caught me and he put me in
[58:36] the room and he had a bottle of green
[58:39] chilies
[58:42] and all I know is that chilies was being
[58:43] rubbed in my mouth until their tongues
[58:46] went away.
[58:51] Hey,
[58:54] but what happens if he said go stand in
[58:56] the corner? I would have been speaking
[58:58] in tongues in the corner.
[59:03] So don't neglect our responsibilities.
[59:06] Chastisement and correction
[59:09] is biblical.
[59:13] Right? I want to get to this point here.
[59:15] Very important. Amen. In the next quote.
[59:17] Amen.
[59:21] Now watch. Let's see now in our families
[59:23] how we supposed to handle things. Let's
[59:26] see what the prophet's pattern is.
[59:27] Right? He says the first step you
[59:29] probably take in life speaking of
[59:30] leadership is probably the hands of some
[59:33] kind mother. So the the mother has the
[59:36] child first.
[59:38] I think there's a step missing. That's
[59:39] why I'm bringing this point. Okay.
[59:42] Mother has the child first. Then he says
[59:45] their mans may be still tonight out here
[59:47] in the se some cemetery somewhere. But
[59:49] that was the hand that held you. Make
[59:51] your first step. Then after mother
[59:53] taught you how to walk. Make a few
[59:55] steps. fall down and get up. After you
[59:58] thought you were doing great things, she
[1:00:00] turned you over to the school teacher.
[1:00:03] So, next is a school teacher. Watch, I'm
[1:00:06] getting to a point here. I don't want
[1:00:07] you to miss this. And then she begin to
[1:00:10] lead you to an education of how and what
[1:00:12] you must do and how you must lean and so
[1:00:14] forth like that. Watch now. I think this
[1:00:17] is a step we are missing. Then after you
[1:00:21] after
[1:00:24] the school teacher got through with you,
[1:00:26] you returned back. Your father got a
[1:00:28] hold of you.
[1:00:30] Now let's be honest. They returned from
[1:00:33] school around the age of 18, 19.
[1:00:37] Who must get a hold of you?
[1:00:40] Your father.
[1:00:44] Your father must now lead you and
[1:00:46] instruct you. Do you know the most
[1:00:48] successful people in the world go look
[1:00:50] at doctors, engineers and go see if
[1:00:53] their parents wasn't guiding them all
[1:00:55] all the way.
[1:00:58] The parents were always involved in
[1:00:59] their decision making.
[1:01:02] Not this casual attitude we have. After
[1:01:05] they finish school, what you going to
[1:01:06] do? I don't know. That fell, he's so
[1:01:07] lazy. I don't know what he's going to
[1:01:08] do.
[1:01:10] You got no plan for your son's life.
[1:01:14] All his life he's been depending on you
[1:01:16] and mommy to lead them and make
[1:01:19] decisions. Suddenly now when they come
[1:01:22] uh 18, 20, 21, they must even go find
[1:01:26] their own girl.
[1:01:28] Listen what I'm saying. The biggest
[1:01:30] decision in life they have to make,
[1:01:32] they've never made decisions before.
[1:01:36] The most important decision and you want
[1:01:38] to be excluded from that decision.
[1:01:41] Look at Abraham. He was involved in this
[1:01:44] decision for the wife of his son.
[1:01:47] That is a biblical pattern.
[1:01:50] You can't look at Jacob. Jacob ran away
[1:01:51] because he was he stole his brother's
[1:01:54] birthight.
[1:01:56] So Isaac couldn't implement the same
[1:01:58] thing.
[1:02:00] But they sent him in the right
[1:02:01] direction.
[1:02:04] But I'm saying parents after the school
[1:02:06] teacher they come back to father
[1:02:12] So now let's think about this. If the
[1:02:15] relationship is strained,
[1:02:18] if the relationship is broken,
[1:02:21] if they can't trust you, they're not
[1:02:22] talking to you, do you think they're
[1:02:24] going to come back to father?
[1:02:26] So what we supposed to do? Keep the
[1:02:28] relationship.
[1:02:31] You know, there's also other things
[1:02:33] where the prophet is admonishing us,
[1:02:35] we've got to know how to handle
[1:02:37] teenagers.
[1:02:38] He says you need to be their friend. You
[1:02:41] need to know how the they're going
[1:02:43] through changes in their bodies.
[1:02:46] All you're hearing is nose and this and
[1:02:48] that and fussing. But he says,
[1:02:49] understand a lot of those things are
[1:02:51] coming out of emotions within them.
[1:02:55] But you maintain the friendship. You
[1:02:58] maintain that son, I'm always here for
[1:03:00] you. Daughter, I'm always here for you.
[1:03:04] Hallelujah.
[1:03:05] So he says after the school teacher you
[1:03:08] returned back to your father and he got
[1:03:10] a hold of you. Then when a father got
[1:03:13] off hold of you he perhaps
[1:03:16] you taught you business how to be
[1:03:18] successful businessmen how to do things
[1:03:20] right. You see fathers what
[1:03:21] responsibility we have we start to guide
[1:03:24] them now. Okay you've done grade 12
[1:03:27] that's fine. Now let's see what you are
[1:03:30] good at. Let's see what interests you
[1:03:33] and go and develop yourself in that
[1:03:35] field.
[1:03:38] Fathers, we've got to take
[1:03:39] responsibility for these things.
[1:03:42] We are ending up with more educated
[1:03:43] women than men.
[1:03:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come on,
[1:03:48] somebody say amen.
[1:03:52] The women are becoming highly qualified
[1:03:54] and the men, they're twiddling their
[1:03:55] tums.
[1:03:57] Has
[1:03:59] anything I said been out of what I'm
[1:04:00] what the prophet is saying here? Is it
[1:04:02] out of Bible?
[1:04:04] So let's correct it.
[1:04:10] He says they taught you business, how to
[1:04:12] be successful, how to do things right.
[1:04:14] Your mother taught you how to be a
[1:04:16] housewife, how to cook. Oh my.
[1:04:24] Now they got married and they don't know
[1:04:26] how to cook.
[1:04:28] They want left hand pot.
[1:04:32] I'm left-handed. I need a left hand pot
[1:04:37] and a left hand pan.
[1:04:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:41] You see where the mothers are failing as
[1:04:43] well? You mean they never crossed your
[1:04:45] mind. Your daughter's going to get
[1:04:46] married.
[1:04:49] I'm going to have to cook one day.
[1:04:56] Who dropped that pin?
[1:05:00] Never ever cross your mind. You had them
[1:05:02] for 20 years.
[1:05:08] You want to treat them like your queen.
[1:05:11] You're not realizing you're raising
[1:05:12] somebody up
[1:05:15] to be the mother of a home.
[1:05:18] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:20] Right. I'm not saying anything. I'm
[1:05:23] reading the prophet's quote here. You
[1:05:24] want to get angry? Go get angry with the
[1:05:25] prophet. I'll buy you a ticket to
[1:05:27] Jeffersonville. You can go there to the
[1:05:28] grave and complain.
[1:05:32] Your mother taught you how to be a
[1:05:34] housewife, how to cook and so forth like
[1:05:36] that. Then after this, so am I gone past
[1:05:39] that. Then after they were through with
[1:05:41] you, who's next?
[1:05:45] Sorry, somebody read this loud.
[1:05:48] So I'm still expecting some of you to
[1:05:50] come my by my way.
[1:05:52] Hey, are we following a prophet's advice
[1:05:55] here?
[1:05:56] Then after your father gets through with
[1:05:58] you, then your minister or priest gets a
[1:06:01] hold of you.
[1:06:04] Which means he needs to be included in
[1:06:06] your decision making
[1:06:09] in your counsel. Is the council like
[1:06:11] deep waters?
[1:06:13] Did we read the opening scripture?
[1:06:15] Counsel is like deep waters,
[1:06:17] but a man of understanding knows how to
[1:06:19] draw it.
[1:06:21] Your minister gets all of you. I've got
[1:06:23] young men here married. They make
[1:06:25] decisions. The first thing they come and
[1:06:27] see me, brother. This is what we want to
[1:06:30] do. Can you pray with us?
[1:06:35] It's not everyone. There's a few,
[1:06:38] brother. I'm struggling with this thing.
[1:06:41] Can you help me pray and overcome this
[1:06:43] thing? You see, if we know there are
[1:06:46] resources and we don't go and you know,
[1:06:49] we only know how to make use of
[1:06:50] government resources. If we know there's
[1:06:52] a child grant, we know how to go apply
[1:06:54] for that child grant. We know there's
[1:06:56] 150 rand unemployment grant, we know how
[1:06:58] to apply for that grant to withdraw it.
[1:07:00] But God has resources in his kingdom
[1:07:03] and we need to know how to apply these
[1:07:05] things to go and make maximum benefit
[1:07:06] from these resources because God says
[1:07:09] when he ascended on high, he gave gifts
[1:07:11] unto men. And unless you know how to
[1:07:13] draw from that gift.
[1:07:16] Amen.
[1:07:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:20] So what he says after your father gets
[1:07:22] through to you, your minister or priest
[1:07:24] gets a hold of you because your father
[1:07:27] could have guided you to become an
[1:07:29] engineer, a doctor.
[1:07:34] But if you are not careful, those things
[1:07:36] will take you away from God.
[1:07:40] So your pastor will always give you
[1:07:41] godly advice how to stay in the confines
[1:07:43] of the word
[1:07:44] and how to keep serving the Lord
[1:07:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:54] But now who leads you? That's the
[1:07:55] question. We're all led by something
[1:07:58] tonight. We have to be we led. Amen.
[1:08:02] Very quickly we close with this. In
[1:08:04] Matthew 19 verse from verse 16 you can
[1:08:06] read about the the rich young ruler.
[1:08:10] He was very successful. The mother led
[1:08:13] him, the teacher led him, the father led
[1:08:15] him to wealth,
[1:08:17] to prosperity. But nobody led this boy
[1:08:20] to eternal life.
[1:08:24] He had finally come to the greatest
[1:08:26] minister,
[1:08:29] the greatest priest
[1:08:32] to find out because he could find no
[1:08:34] help in his father.
[1:08:35] He could find no help in his mother. He
[1:08:38] could find no help in the teachers and
[1:08:40] the guides. And he says, "I know there's
[1:08:42] something lacking. What must I do to get
[1:08:45] eternal life?" Amen.
[1:08:50] But he turned down the greatest priest
[1:08:53] who gave him advice
[1:08:56] when he said, "Your riches are stopping
[1:08:58] you from getting eternal life." That is
[1:09:01] the hindrance.
[1:09:03] Your wealth is stopping you from
[1:09:05] receiving me. Your education has got in
[1:09:08] the way.
[1:09:12] But he didn't want to forsake that. I I
[1:09:14] studied for four years.
[1:09:19] You can study for four years. God can
[1:09:21] call you to full-time ministry. What you
[1:09:22] going to do?
[1:09:26] Amen.
[1:09:27] You can study for seven years. Be a
[1:09:29] doctor.
[1:09:31] Who was a doctor? Luke.
[1:09:34] Not this brother Luke. Now,
[1:09:38] he was a doctor.
[1:09:42] But he says he chose me to follow him.
[1:09:46] I emptied myself out my whole life
[1:09:50] completely.
[1:09:52] Amen.
[1:09:53] Because when God calls you, he equips
[1:09:55] you.
[1:09:56] You think God's going to call you into
[1:09:57] full-time ministry to starve,
[1:10:00] to not take care of you.
[1:10:04] We don't know who you're playing with.
[1:10:05] You're playing with God.
[1:10:06] If he calls you, he'll equip you.
[1:10:10] Amen. He'll take care of you. Yes,
[1:10:12] we've got to trust in him.
[1:10:14] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:18] So I I want to read this, brother. Amen.
[1:10:21] Let's close with this. Let's You got
[1:10:22] that? I think it starts with paragraph
[1:10:24] 50, right? But let's drop to paragraph
[1:10:27] 56. So parents can give you money,
[1:10:29] inheritance, you can get houses, land,
[1:10:31] and wealth.
[1:10:32] But let's see what he's saying here. You
[1:10:34] got to face one thing. Eternal life.
[1:10:36] And there's only one person who can give
[1:10:38] that to you. Mama can't give it to you.
[1:10:41] Papa can't give it to you. Your pastor
[1:10:43] can't give it to you. Your leader here
[1:10:44] can't give it to you. Everybody that
[1:10:46] gets eternal life has got to come to
[1:10:48] Jesus Christ.
[1:10:51] Young boys, young girls, you can get
[1:10:55] houses, land, cars, money, but eternal
[1:10:57] life you can only get through Jesus.
[1:11:02] He's the only one who can give that
[1:11:04] part. Your teacher can give you an
[1:11:06] education. She can teach you. You have
[1:11:08] to learn it. Your mother can teach you
[1:11:09] to walk. Your father can teach you how
[1:11:11] to be a businessman. But only Jesus can
[1:11:13] give you eternal life.
[1:11:16] Fathers, I want you to know if you have
[1:11:18] instructed your children, you can
[1:11:19] reinstruct them.
[1:11:22] It doesn't mean a father's word is
[1:11:24] final.
[1:11:26] Because our father god, his word was not
[1:11:28] final like that. In one age, he told his
[1:11:31] children to live by justification.
[1:11:33] In the next age, he told gave them
[1:11:35] another instruction live by
[1:11:36] sanctification. In another age he said
[1:11:38] the outpouring of the gifts. But in this
[1:11:40] day
[1:11:42] so father is always instructing
[1:11:44] according to his plan and purpose.
[1:11:46] So when you have a plan and purpose for
[1:11:47] your son when you have a plan and your
[1:11:50] purpose for your daughter don't say I
[1:11:52] have to stick by my word. I'm a man of
[1:11:54] principle.
[1:11:56] No you are also developing
[1:12:00] and you can reinstruct your son. You can
[1:12:02] reinstruct your daughter and say, "Son,
[1:12:05] daughter, I am the head of this home.
[1:12:07] God has placed me as a spiritual head of
[1:12:09] this home, and I see it fit that we do
[1:12:11] things this way."
[1:12:17] Amen.
[1:12:19] And don't be afraid to take your
[1:12:21] position as a as the priest of the home.
[1:12:24] We got so many people afraid. Call your
[1:12:27] family, say, "Let's read the Bible
[1:12:28] tonight."
[1:12:30] They're going to get a shocker dick a
[1:12:31] dayare.
[1:12:34] They're going to get a shock.
[1:12:37] But you know what? They will all come
[1:12:40] because they are you. Do you know how
[1:12:42] they are longing for you to take the
[1:12:44] headship?
[1:12:45] Do you know how your wife is longing for
[1:12:47] you to take the headship?
[1:12:49] Do you know how your children are
[1:12:50] longing for you to take the headship?
[1:12:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:58] Amen.
[1:13:02] Okay, let's leave it there. Let's give
[1:13:04] the Lord a good hand clap of praise.
[1:13:05] Let's stand. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:09] Amen. We can take it longer, but I think
[1:13:11] time is gone now. Amen. I think we got
[1:13:15] the point of the message.
[1:13:17] Amen. Fathers, instruct your children.
[1:13:20] Teach them. Don't neglect our duty. What
[1:13:23] God has called us to do in this hour.
[1:13:39] If you don't know who your father is,
[1:13:42] we got some machines here. We can run a
[1:13:44] DNA test for you this morning.
[1:13:48] But one thing's for certain,
[1:13:51] the DNA test is going to come back
[1:13:53] telling you that God is your father.
[1:13:56] How many of you want to run a DNA test
[1:13:58] this morning?
[1:13:59] How? What is the DNA test? The word. If
[1:14:01] we can take the word.
[1:14:03] If we can take the word.
[1:14:06] It's showing us our pedigree.
[1:14:09] Let me tell you something about us. We
[1:14:12] are not in a ministry of
[1:14:13] self-realization
[1:14:15] and self-discovery.
[1:14:18] The only way that we are going to be
[1:14:20] connected to our origin is through
[1:14:22] Malachi 4. Amen.
[1:14:24] Go read Malachi 4:5 and 6. It'll be
[1:14:28] Elijah the prophet who will turn our
[1:14:30] hearts
[1:14:31] back to our religion,
[1:14:33] back to our father.
