[0:00] The goal or the
[0:02] redeemer as obligations and
[0:05] rights. Amen. The obligations and rights
[0:08] of the redeemer. He has certain
[0:10] responsibilities which he must fulfill.
[0:14] Amen. And the obligation is placed from
[0:17] the person that is now in distress.
[0:22] So the redeemer, the nearest kinsman has
[0:24] an obligation to fulfill the request of
[0:27] the one that's in distress. Amen. And
[0:31] maybe for a title, I'll just call this
[0:34] the taking of the book gives the
[0:37] redeemer rights.
[0:39] Amen. The taking of the book gives the
[0:41] redeemer rights. So in Deuteronomy 25,
[0:45] we'll read from verse 6
[0:49] there. If brethren dwell together and
[0:52] one of them die and have no child, the
[0:55] wife of the dead shall not marry without
[0:57] unto a
[0:59] stranger, a husband shall go in unto
[1:02] her, and take her to him to wife, and to
[1:06] perform the duty of an husband's brother
[1:09] unto her.
[1:12] And it shall be that the firstborn which
[1:14] he shall which she beareth shall succeed
[1:17] in the name of his brother which is
[1:19] dead, that his name be not put out of
[1:23] Israel. And if the man like not to take
[1:27] his brother's wife, then let his
[1:29] brother's wife go up to the gate of the
[1:31] elders and say, "My husband's brother
[1:33] refuses to raise up unto his brother a
[1:36] name in Israel. he will not perform the
[1:39] duty of my husband's
[1:41] brother. Then the elders of the city
[1:43] shall call him and speak unto him. And
[1:46] if he stand to it and say, I will not
[1:47] take her, I would like not to take her.
[1:50] Then shall his brother's wife come unto
[1:53] him in the presence of the elders and
[1:55] loose his shoe from off his foot and
[1:57] spit in his face and shall answer and
[1:59] say, So shall it be done unto that man
[2:02] that will not build up his brother's
[2:05] house.
[2:06] And his name shall And his name shall be
[2:09] called in Israel the house of him that
[2:12] hath Ishu
[2:13] loosed. And when men strive together one
[2:16] with another, and the wife of the one
[2:18] draw near, for to deliver a husband out
[2:20] of the hand of him that smiteth him, and
[2:22] puteth forth a hand, and taketh him by
[2:24] the secret, then thou shalt cut off a
[2:27] hand, thine eye shall not pity. The Lord
[2:29] had blessed you through the reading of
[2:30] his word. You may be
[2:32] seated. Amen. Want to remind you of
[2:34] another scripture.
[2:36] Amen. Hallelujah. You remember Judah's
[2:40] daughter-in-law, she needed seed raised
[2:42] up to her lineage.
[2:44] Amen. And none of the the brother that
[2:47] was now the near kinsman didn't want to
[2:49] perform the duty to raise up seed.
[2:53] So then you know how she disguises
[2:54] herself.
[2:56] Amen. It's Tama. Is it Tama? Amen.
[3:00] disguises herself and now entices
[3:05] Judah. Amen. So she's got to go into
[3:07] another type of role there to play the
[3:10] outlet in order to fulfill the
[3:12] scripture.
[3:13] Amen. So as we are reading this now, I
[3:17] want you to
[3:19] understand that Adam
[3:22] died without raising up the type of seed
[3:26] that he was supposed to raise.
[3:29] Yes. Amen.
[3:31] The type of seed that Abel was or sith
[3:33] was not in the perfect will of God.
[3:38] So we can say that Adam died without
[3:41] reproducing his life in the type of
[3:43] species that he was. Yes.
[3:48] So now like we read in the scripture
[3:51] when a brother dies without raising up
[3:54] sea to carry his
[3:55] name the nearest kinsman must come forth
[3:59] to take his wife and raise up sea.
[4:04] But now there's a problem. There is no
[4:06] near kinsman. There is no perfect man on
[4:08] the earth to raise up Adam's name. Yeah.
[4:14] And God can't take Eve and use her
[4:17] because she was part of the defilement.
[4:20] She was part of the deception there.
[4:22] Hallelujah. So in John 6 and 63, I want
[4:27] to read
[4:29] this. It is the spirit that quickenth
[4:32] the flesh. Amen. It is the spirit that
[4:34] quickenth. The flesh profitth nothing.
[4:38] Now watch what the statement Jesus is
[4:40] going to make. Now remember Jesus is the
[4:42] kinsman that's going to raise up the
[4:44] seed of Adam.
[4:47] The type of species that Adam was. It's
[4:49] only Jesus Christ was born of a virgin.
[4:54] Wasn't born of a sexual act.
[4:57] Wasn't even the egg of Mary.
[5:00] Mary was just the incubator. The prophet
[5:02] calls it the immaculate conception.
[5:05] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So God had
[5:09] created both the egg and the sperm and
[5:11] placed it inside of Mary as an incubator
[5:14] to bring forth the only begotten son of
[5:17] God.
[5:19] So Jesus is going to speak these words.
[5:22] And he's saying the words that are
[5:23] coming out of my mouth. Amen. The type
[5:26] of man that Adam was,
[5:29] I am speaking words. And he says my
[5:32] words are spirit. Amen. And they are
[5:35] life. Amen.
[5:37] So a son of God when words come out of
[5:40] his mouth they are spirit and they are
[5:43] life.
[5:45] We are no different from our bridegroom
[5:47] the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen.
[5:51] So now that we have back redemptive
[5:53] rights, we've got to understand that our
[5:55] words are spirit and our words are life.
[5:59] Amen. That's why the when God in the
[6:01] beginning could say let there be light
[6:04] things started to create to to happen to
[6:07] materialize because his word was spirit
[6:10] and life. Amen. Hallelujah.
[6:14] Amen.
[6:15] So if we're emphasizing Jesus on words
[6:19] and we are saying the word of God is
[6:21] just not words. The words written in
[6:23] your Bible are just not words.
[6:27] But it has a lifegiving power and a it
[6:31] carries a source. Amen. Of spiritual
[6:34] sustenance. Amen. The prophet of God
[6:36] would say here in the church book, he
[6:39] knew that the man originally got away
[6:42] from God was first by leaving the word.
[6:46] Yes. If you leave that word, you have
[6:49] left God. So what were they leaving?
[6:52] They were leaving spirit and life. Yes.
[6:57] To live the word is to leave spirit and
[6:59] life. To leave your source and power of
[7:02] your life. Praise the Lord.
[7:07] Now, the prophet in this message,
[7:08] spiritual amnesia, he says, "I wonder if
[7:10] the church hasn't got amnesia so much
[7:14] now that they don't, some of them don't
[7:16] even believe such a thing as the Holy
[7:21] Ghost." Just the other day, I was
[7:23] listening to a minister
[7:25] in the message makes a statement. Some
[7:28] of you go to churches where they keep
[7:30] emphasizing about the Holy Ghost.
[7:34] Amen. But watch what the property is
[7:36] saying. They got spiritual amnesia and
[7:38] they don't even believe there's such a
[7:40] thing as the Holy Ghost.
[7:44] See where the church has got a very bad
[7:47] case of amnesia.
[7:49] The prophet will go on to say, don't get
[7:51] spiritual amnesia. you'll identify
[7:54] yourself with something else. Stay right
[7:57] with that word because the word is
[7:59] revealing our true identity. The word is
[8:02] taking away spiritual amnesia. Amen. In
[8:06] fact, the prophet of God says it will
[8:08] take those seven unknown thunders to
[8:10] wake her up again to make her realize
[8:12] who she is. The part of God's economy
[8:15] she is. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[8:18] Now I just want to define some of the
[8:20] things the prophet is saying because
[8:22] it's a very profound thing he's saying
[8:23] and this message is preached in 1964 and
[8:26] he's showing you some key scriptures
[8:28] that if we don't operate the scriptures
[8:30] he is telling us that we in a case of
[8:32] spiritual amnesia.
[8:35] Amen. He says I want to be identified
[8:38] there with these signs shall follow them
[8:39] that believe. Amen. Can't be identified
[8:42] in that. Have you got have you got some
[8:45] spiritual amnesia that you find out you
[8:47] don't believe those signs follow the
[8:48] believers?
[8:50] Follow his thought. If you don't believe
[8:52] it, you got spiritual amnesia.
[8:57] See, you've gotten you've forgotten that
[9:00] God promised that. He said, "These son
[9:02] shall follow them that believe." Don't
[9:04] forget it. You can't forget it to be a
[9:06] Christian. Amen. Amen. And brother Sam,
[9:10] is that echorn very high in uh because
[9:13] it's warm here. It's like blowing hot
[9:14] air. Amen. Just check this main econ
[9:17] brother Caleb. Praise the
[9:21] Lord. In 109 that paragraph there he
[9:24] says now remember Mark 16 was these
[9:27] signs shall follow them. How many of you
[9:29] here believes Mark 16?
[9:31] Amen. Then I'm then you are part of the
[9:35] candidates that are not in spiritual
[9:36] amnesia. Right. Then he takes another
[9:39] scripture St. John 14 and 12. He that
[9:42] believeth with me though in me the works
[9:45] that I do shall he do also. Now if we
[9:48] don't believe we carry those potentials
[9:50] then we are in spiritual amnesia.
[9:53] Amen. He that believeth in me, the works
[9:56] that I do shall he do also. Don't forget
[9:58] it. If you do, you've got spiritual
[10:01] amnesia.
[10:03] You've forgotten who you are. You've
[10:05] forgotten what your testimony means. How
[10:08] about that? He said, "If you abide in me
[10:10] and my word abide in you, that's spirit
[10:12] and life, you can ask what you will, it
[10:16] be done for you, are you identified
[10:18] there to believe that that is the
[10:19] truth?" Amen.
[10:22] Then he takes one more scripture that I
[10:23] want to emphasize. He takes Mark 11:23.
[10:26] If you say to this mountain, be moved.
[10:28] Don't doubt in your heart. Believe what
[10:30] you have said will come to pass. You can
[10:32] have what you said. Can you be
[10:34] identified there? to believe that is the
[10:37] truth. Amen. If it hasn't, then you're
[10:40] getting spiritual amnesia.
[10:46] Amen. Then I want to get
[10:49] to the church age book and brother
[10:52] Brandon makes a statement. He says, "I
[10:55] wonder if we are sufficiently impressed
[10:59] with the word in our midst." Yes. Amen.
[11:04] Are we satisfied with what we have
[11:08] or are we like John? Are you the one to
[11:10] come or should we look for another?
[11:13] I am saying the word in our midst is the
[11:15] shout. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Are
[11:19] we sufficiently impressed with a shout?
[11:21] Amen.
[11:22] Now that we've come out of all our
[11:24] denominations, out of all these
[11:26] religions, are we sufficiently impressed
[11:28] with a shout? or as a time period gone
[11:31] by where we don't even now acknowledge
[11:34] the power of the shout. Yes.
[11:38] Amen. I want you to know the power of
[11:41] the shout, the word in our midst is
[11:43] still an ongoing process in our lives.
[11:47] It is the shout that is delivering us.
[11:49] Brother Brandham calls the shout the
[11:51] living bread of life.
[11:54] Amen. That's right. He calls it the
[11:57] living bread of life. Amen. He said it's
[12:00] a message going forth to gather the
[12:02] living saints.
[12:04] Yesterday we were preaching at Sister
[12:06] Baby's memorial service there. Amen. And
[12:08] I was showing them that when you are in
[12:11] Christ, now remember there's only one
[12:14] body in Christ.
[12:16] Amen. The sleeping saints are part of
[12:19] the body. So can there be any part of
[12:22] the body of Christ that's dead?
[12:25] That is why in heaven's language, Jesus
[12:28] never refers to them that are gone on as
[12:31] dead.
[12:32] Because no part of his body can be dead.
[12:35] Amen. From our perspective, they have
[12:37] left the earth. And from our
[12:39] perspective, they are dead. But from
[12:41] God's perspective, they are alive. Amen.
[12:44] So God's body exists in two dimensions.
[12:47] One in this dimension and in that
[12:50] dimension. But both are alive. Amen.
[12:53] Amen. Doesn't the scripture say Jesus
[12:56] even said that? Amen. When he's talking
[12:58] about he said, "I am the God of Abraham,
[12:59] Isaac, and Jacob." And he said, "God is
[13:01] God of the living." Amen. He's not a God
[13:04] of the dead. So, we've got to change our
[13:06] perspective and our language. Remember
[13:09] when Jesus was going to raise up
[13:10] Lazarus, he told the disciples, "Our
[13:13] friend sleepeth."
[13:15] So, they said, "Well, if he sleeps, it's
[13:17] good." Then Jesus to come down to their
[13:19] earthly language, he said, "Lazarus is
[13:21] dead."
[13:23] But in the kingdom language, it's
[13:25] asleep. Asleep in this dimension, but
[13:28] alive in that dimension.
[13:31] Hallelujah. Because the body of Jesus
[13:33] Christ can never die. Amen. No part of
[13:37] his body can die. Amen. So rest assured,
[13:42] if we draw our last breath in this life,
[13:44] it's not the end of us. Amen. people in
[13:47] this life from this
[13:48] perspective we feel sorry for the person
[13:51] that has gone on
[13:54] but who has a better quality of life
[14:00] yes who has a better quality of life
[14:02] they are in a perfect body they are in a
[14:05] young body they in a body that doesn't
[14:07] age now in this life we subject to our
[14:11] sorrow our pain our sickness and death
[14:14] we feeling sorry for them who have gone
[14:15] on before and they're in a dimension
[14:17] where there's no time, there's no
[14:19] sickness, there's no sorrow, there's no
[14:22] pain. So they actually should be feeling
[14:25] sorry for us. Amen.
[14:28] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[14:32] So God's got a body and they that are in
[14:35] Christ, they are asleep in Christ.
[14:38] Hallelujah. And we are in Christ in
[14:40] heavenly places. Both are in Christ.
[14:43] Yes. And that's what matters to be in
[14:45] Christ.
[14:47] So, brother Brandham is making this
[14:48] statement. I wonder if we are
[14:50] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[14:53] our midst. Now, can I elaborate on that?
[14:57] If we were sufficiently impressed, you
[15:00] can't get me to stay away from
[15:01] fellowship. Hallelujah. If we were
[15:04] sufficiently impressed with the shout,
[15:06] you can't wait for the assembly together
[15:08] of the saints.
[15:10] If you were sufficiently impressed with
[15:12] the shout, you'll go and prophesy again
[15:15] to many nations, tongues, and kings. If
[15:17] we were sufficiently impressed with the
[15:20] shout,
[15:21] we would be more on fire for God. Amen.
[15:28] Praise the Lord.
[15:31] Now, the paragraphs that I'm reading now
[15:34] is going to go
[15:35] into what we call pick up your pen and
[15:38] write, which the prophet would say it's
[15:40] God's love letter to the church. Right?
[15:44] But I I found this very interesting in
[15:46] his preceding paragraphs going into that
[15:50] some of the statements he's
[15:51] making. Now, let's follow along. Amen.
[15:55] And see, follow the thought of the
[15:57] prophet. He's asking us how we pray. We
[16:00] pray in Jesus' name. Every prayer in his
[16:03] name or there isn't any
[16:06] answer. So you can't pray in the name of
[16:09] Jehovah. Yes, sir.
[16:12] Come on. Yes. And expect an answer. He
[16:16] says you've got to ask in my name.
[16:20] So he's saying if there's no prayer in
[16:22] his name, there is isn't any answer. In
[16:25] John 5:14 we are told this is the
[16:28] confidence we have in him that if we ask
[16:30] anything according to his will he
[16:32] heareth us and if we know that he
[16:35] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[16:38] our petitions that we desire of him. Now
[16:40] this might help somebody when you are
[16:42] praying for something.
[16:44] Now we ask what is the will of God?
[16:47] There is only one way to know his will
[16:50] and that is by the word of God. Amen.
[16:53] Yes. Right. Then he quotes lamentations
[16:56] there. He says, "If it isn't the word,
[16:58] you can't have it." That's right.
[17:03] So, we can't ask unless it's in the
[17:05] word. And we can't petition or ask
[17:08] unless it's in his name. Amen.
[17:11] Amen. So, watch how he ties the two
[17:13] things together. Now, there it is again.
[17:16] Jesus, the name is the word, the will.
[17:19] Amen. So, the will of God is for you to
[17:21] ask in the name of Jesus. Yes. You can't
[17:24] separate God and the word. They are one.
[17:28] So if you're ever asking that question,
[17:30] how do I ask according to his will? You
[17:32] ask in his name. Amen. His will is his
[17:36] name. That's you ready there for
[17:38] yourself. The prophet is saying
[17:40] it. Amen. So then he goes on to progress
[17:43] the thought and he's saying the word now
[17:45] that we have our
[17:46] Bibles that's in the printed page is a
[17:49] part of him when you accept it by faith
[17:51] into a spiritful life. He said that his
[17:54] word was life but that is exactly what
[17:56] he is. John 14:6 I am the way the truth
[18:00] and the life. Amen. And Romans 8:9 says
[18:03] if any man have not the spirit of Christ
[18:05] he is none of him. There it is. He is
[18:07] spirit and he is life. Amen. Now watch
[18:10] where he goes with
[18:12] this. That's exactly what the word is.
[18:15] Spirit and life, right? Watch where he
[18:18] goes.
[18:18] Now that's exactly what Jesus is. He is
[18:21] the word. Now when a spiritborn,
[18:23] spiritful man, can I get some witnesses?
[18:26] A spiritful
[18:29] amen.
[18:30] Spiritborn, spiritful man in faith takes
[18:33] that word into his heart and places it
[18:36] upon his lip. Hallelujah. Amen. Remember
[18:38] that's Romans now 10. If you believe in
[18:40] your heart, confess with your mouth.
[18:43] When you take it and you place it upon
[18:45] your lips, why? That is the same as
[18:47] deity speaking. Amen. Amen. Thank you.
[18:54] Every mountain has to go. Yes. Amen.
[18:57] Satan cannot stand before that man.
[18:58] Amen. So don't tell me Satan is opposing
[19:01] you. Take the word that's coming to your
[19:03] heart, put it on your lips, and speak.
[19:05] Amen. Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. He
[19:07] says, "Satan can't stand before you."
[19:09] Oh, thank you, Lord. He's only a bluff.
[19:11] Yes. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:14] Amen. Oh, wonderful. Thank you, Jesus.
[19:17] Hallelujah.
[19:19] If the church way back there in the
[19:21] third age, had only held on to the
[19:23] revelation of the living word.
[19:27] Amen. In the midst, in their
[19:30] midst, the power of God would not have
[19:32] faded as it did in those dark ages.
[19:35] Amen. Amen. And right today when the
[19:38] church returns to the word in faith,
[19:40] what is that? Somebody tell me Malachi 4
[19:42] verse 5 and 6. Amen. The hearts of the
[19:45] children being turned back now to the
[19:47] faith of the fathers because they got
[19:49] lost through the dark ages. He's saying
[19:51] so Malachi 4 is coming to restore back
[19:53] the spirit in the church. Amen.
[19:57] He says, "When the church returns to the
[19:59] word in faith, we can say without doubt
[20:02] that the glory of God and the wonderful
[20:04] acts of God will be in our midst again."
[20:07] Amen. Amen. We just come through 2024
[20:09] showing you the glory of God returning
[20:11] to the church. He's saying the glory of
[20:14] God will be in our midst again. Amen. So
[20:17] that's what we are contending for. We
[20:19] are contending for the glory to return
[20:21] back to the church. So we're living
[20:23] consecrated lives. We are living Amen.
[20:26] lives humbly before the Lord, walking in
[20:28] reverence, in humility.
[20:31] Amen. Remember those angels how they are
[20:32] clothed. Amen. They cover their face.
[20:34] They cover their feet. Amen. They cover.
[20:37] Amen. Their cherubams are covered. He
[20:40] says they are walking in humility.
[20:44] Now, here's where he goes
[20:46] to remember opening scripture. It's all
[20:48] going to tie in. Now, one night while I
[20:51] was seeking the
[20:53] Lord, now think of this. He just gave
[20:56] you a thought of creative power on your
[20:58] lips. Amen.
[21:01] And then he suddenly brings this
[21:04] in. He's trying to show
[21:07] you that Adam's
[21:09] seed, which was supposed to speak by the
[21:12] spoken word, that kind of a man didn't
[21:15] exist.
[21:17] But he's going to show you now how Jesus
[21:21] the
[21:22] bridegroom is going to write a letter to
[21:25] his bride and tell her something. Now
[21:28] remember the basis of it. Brother
[21:31] Brandham says when a man is writing a
[21:33] letter to his wife, he says she can read
[21:36] in between the lines. She can know
[21:38] exactly what he is saying. Amen. Amen.
[21:41] Amen. So can we declare that he is the
[21:44] bridegroom? Yes. Can we declare you are
[21:47] the wife? So can you read between the
[21:49] lines what your husband is telling you?
[21:51] Amen. Thank you Lord.
[21:56] So he says one night while I was seeking
[21:57] the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick
[22:00] up my pen and write. As I grasped the
[22:03] pen to write the spirit gave me a
[22:04] message to the church. I want to bring
[22:06] it to you. It has to do with the word
[22:11] and the bride. Amen. Now remember what
[22:13] we said the word was. The word is the
[22:15] will of God. The word is the seed of
[22:17] God. So it has to do with seed and the
[22:20] bride. Amen.
[22:24] So we have to read between the lines
[22:26] because only his wife will know what
[22:28] he's really saying.
[22:31] Brother, if you can go onto the message
[22:33] search there and find this here, right?
[22:36] Maybe pick it up from there.
[22:42] You can type up one of these letterings
[22:44] there and then pick up that quote. I
[22:45] didn't want to copy it here. I said
[22:47] we'll just read it off that slide there.
[22:49] So, we must be reading between the lines
[22:52] and only his wife will know what he's
[22:53] saying between the lines.
[22:56] Right? He goes on to say, "Here is what
[22:58] I'm trying to say to
[23:00] you. The law of
[23:03] reproduction." Hey, this
[23:07] you started writing your letter about
[23:08] reproduction.
[23:14] You're writing a love letter and you
[23:16] start writing. Are you reading between
[23:18] the lines?
[23:21] He's saying that God's specy, Adam died
[23:24] without his species.
[23:27] But Jesus Christ has come now as a
[23:29] redeemer.
[23:30] He's found a wife. And he's talking
[23:33] about reproductive rights of the
[23:35] redeemer. Amen. Because the redeemer has
[23:37] rights to reproduce the seed. Amen.
[23:39] Thank you, Lord.
[23:42] The law of reproduction is that every
[23:45] species bring forth after its own kind.
[23:47] Amen. So when he was looking on the
[23:49] earth, there was no Genesis 1:26 27 man.
[23:52] So that species didn't exist. But it's
[23:55] going to exist now. Amen. No other time
[23:58] and age could Jesus be married. I'm
[24:01] going to say it again. No other time and
[24:04] age could Jesus be married but after the
[24:06] book is taken. Amen. Amen. Paul even
[24:09] said, "I've espoused you." Yes. Thank
[24:13] you, Lord. Because you can't take back
[24:16] the right of a redeemer to marry that
[24:18] woman if you don't have the title deed
[24:20] in your hand. And tell me, did Jesus
[24:23] take the title deed back 2,000 years
[24:25] ago? Yes, sir. Or did he have to wait
[24:27] there in the mediation role till every
[24:31] name was expressed on the earth? Yes.
[24:34] So after 2,000 years, he's coming back
[24:37] out of the sanctuary and there's a call
[24:40] made. Who is worthy to take the book?
[24:46] Amen.
[24:47] So I'm saying it was only in
[24:50] 1963 in the first seal. That's right.
[24:53] Brother Brandham is saying, "I no longer
[24:54] call you bride because you can't
[24:56] impregnate bride.
[25:00] You got to marry her first.
[25:04] He says, "I no longer call you
[25:07] bride." Or he says, "I no longer call
[25:09] you church. I call you bride." Right?
[25:12] Because now he's found the woman that
[25:13] he's going to reproduce his life in. Now
[25:17] bride goes on for the ceremony in the
[25:20] invisible union. The ceremony is
[25:22] performed and I pronounce you husband
[25:25] and wife. Right?
[25:28] So he says the law of reproduction is
[25:30] each species brings forth after its own
[25:33] kind even according to Genesis 1:11.
[25:37] Now I'm going to say it again. The
[25:40] opening subject of the letter is
[25:42] revealing the theme of the letter.
[25:44] He is not concealing the matter. He is
[25:47] very direct and going straight to the
[25:49] point. Amen. This is not a letter to the
[25:52] public.
[25:54] This is a letter to the one that is
[25:55] chosen to be his wife. Amen.
[25:59] Thank you, Lord. So, what we are
[26:01] learning here is that God wants to
[26:03] reproduce himself.
[26:07] And create again the God man specy.
[26:12] The one after his image and likeness,
[26:15] the one in Genesis
[26:17] 126:27. Maybe we can put it up. We can
[26:19] read it. Amen. Maybe you're familiar
[26:22] with the scripture. But repetition is
[26:25] good. Amen.
[26:29] Amen. Repetition is good because once it
[26:31] gets into your spirit because in your
[26:34] spirit is memory.
[26:36] Amen. Memory is not held up in your
[26:38] brain. Memory is part of your spirit
[26:41] realm. Amen.
[26:44] Amen. Genesis 1:26. Praise the Lord.
[26:49] He's saying here, "Let us make man in
[26:52] our image, after our likeness, and let
[26:55] them have dominion over the fish of the
[26:57] sea, the fowl of the air, over cattle,
[27:00] over all the earth, and over every
[27:02] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[27:04] earth." So this kind of a man, God wants
[27:07] to reproduce. Yes.
[27:10] So God created man in his own image. in
[27:13] the image of God created ye him. Male
[27:16] and female created ye them.
[27:20] Right? Now notice there as well. If you
[27:22] go back to 126 there, he's saying image
[27:25] and out to our likeness.
[27:29] But if you go to 27, you'll see he's
[27:31] saying God created man in his image.
[27:36] Nothing about likeness there. In the
[27:38] image of God created him. Male and
[27:40] female created he them. Which means man
[27:43] was going to have to come up to this
[27:46] perfect state of the word which was
[27:48] Mazdc.
[27:50] Amen.
[27:51] That's what the process was going on
[27:53] with Adam. Adam was coming into the
[27:55] perfect state of the word. He had
[27:57] dominion over the fish of the sea, over
[27:59] the foul of the air. He could speak to
[28:01] mountains, but he was coming up to the
[28:03] perfect state of the word which was
[28:05] Melzdc.
[28:07] Praise the Lord. Amen. Where he could
[28:09] have creative power to speak and
[28:12] reproduce his own life. But Eve couldn't
[28:16] wait for him to come to that potential.
[28:18] So the serpent presented to a way an
[28:20] idea. He says you can wait for your
[28:22] husband to reproduce his
[28:25] life. Amen. By God's way
[28:30] or you can reproduce the animal way.
[28:34] She chose the animal way of
[28:35] reproduction. Yes. Praise the Lord. Now,
[28:39] let's go back to that quote there and
[28:40] continue reading. So, we are seeing the
[28:42] theme of this letter is to deal with the
[28:45] reproduction of the God kind of man. The
[28:47] man that can take the word that's sown
[28:49] in his heart, put it on his lips and
[28:52] speak.
[28:55] Right? And God said, "Let the earth
[28:57] bring forth grass, the herb yielding
[28:58] seed, fruit yielding fruit after its
[29:00] kind." Right? So, he's trying to show
[29:02] you how everything must bring forth
[29:03] after its kind. Whatever seed started,
[29:06] the church will come forth and be like
[29:08] the original seed
[29:12] because it's the same seed. So if Jesus
[29:15] who is the kinsman redeemer is raising
[29:17] up the seed of Adam, it must be like
[29:20] Adam. Amen.
[29:23] Hello.
[29:25] He's saying it must be like the original
[29:27] seed. In these last days, the true
[29:29] bright church, which is Christ's seed,
[29:31] will come to the headstone.
[29:35] Amen. She will be now watch what kind of
[29:38] seed this is. The kind of seed that Adam
[29:41] was was a super church, a super race.
[29:46] Hallelujah. As she nears him. Amen.
[29:49] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[29:52] Now, if you read this very carefully,
[29:54] he's not saying once she is united with
[29:57] him, she'll be the super church.
[30:02] Hello. Hello. Come on. Walk work walk
[30:04] work walk work walk work walk work walk
[30:04] work walk work walk work walk work walk
[30:04] work walk work walk work walk work walk
[30:04] work walk work walk work walk work walk
[30:04] work walk work walk work walk work walk
[30:04] thing think she as she nears him so why
[30:09] are we putting it to some future event
[30:13] yes
[30:15] amen he says as she nears him she'll be
[30:19] the super race so I'm saying the thing
[30:22] that's holding it
[30:24] back I got a picture of it
[30:30] here the thing that's holding it back is
[30:33] This you
[30:36] see. You want me to walk around? You can
[30:39] see who's holding it back. Can you see?
[30:43] They look beautiful,
[30:46] right? You saw who's holding it back.
[30:49] Okay. This is the guy
[30:52] responsible. There's a
[30:54] culprit. Can you see sister Jason?
[30:57] Joseph, you can see this is the guy.
[31:02] Joseph, who didn't see it in the back?
[31:05] All of you saw it. But the same, you're
[31:07] looking very puzzled. Let me show you
[31:09] this picture of who is holding Jack the
[31:13] Super
[31:17] Race. You see it? Can you see it with a
[31:21] D? This is the person holding it back.
[31:25] You get the idea. You want to see such a
[31:28] victory? You know,
[31:36] now remember what he's saying. He's not
[31:37] saying when she's united with him, she
[31:40] becomes a super race. So what's our
[31:43] problem? Ask your neighbor, what's your
[31:50] problem? As she nears him, she's a super
[31:54] church super race. We are waiting to be
[31:57] united with him for us to be the super
[31:58] church super race. That's not what the
[32:00] quote is saying. Don't make the quote a
[32:02] liar. Amen.
[32:07] And she will be the super church super
[32:09] race as she nears him. They and the
[32:11] bride will be so much like him that they
[32:13] will be in his very own image. Amen.
[32:16] Watch now because you're that super
[32:17] church and super race. He says this is
[32:19] in order to be united with him. Amen.
[32:22] Amen. Hallelujah. So which means he's
[32:24] already given you the potential to be
[32:26] like him.
[32:28] Amen. That's the Holy Ghost that he's
[32:30] given us. The spirit of Christ that's in
[32:33] us. Now we only want the Holy Ghost to
[32:35] work in the end time and apply Romans 8
[32:39] there. If the spirit of him that raised
[32:42] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, it
[32:44] will also quicken your mortal body.
[32:46] Well, if that spirit that dwells in us
[32:47] is so powerful that it will quicken us
[32:50] from the dead. Amen. How about now?
[32:53] While we are living, can't we see the
[32:56] characteristics of the Holy Ghost in us
[32:58] that it is power?
[33:01] Amen. Amen. Every day there in the city
[33:03] of Jerusalem, you shall receive power.
[33:06] Amen.
[33:08] It's unlimited, untapped resources. This
[33:10] deity that's in you,
[33:13] they will be the Now remember my
[33:16] thought. This is the kind of life he
[33:18] wants to reproduce to raise up Adam's
[33:20] seed again.
[33:22] That is in order to be united with him.
[33:24] They will be one. They will be the very
[33:27] manifestation of the word of the living
[33:29] God. Denominations cannot produce this
[33:32] wrong seed. They will produce the
[33:34] creeds, their dogmas mixed with the
[33:36] word. Amen. Mongalizing brings forth a
[33:39] bread product. And the word ibid means
[33:41] you can't reproduce yourself.
[33:44] Praise the Lord. Now he approach goes on
[33:46] in the thought and he says that Adam the
[33:49] first spoken seed word of God
[33:52] right now watch what he's saying there
[33:54] now just to connect with what I
[33:56] statement I made earlier a seed it's not
[33:58] in maturity
[34:01] can everybody say amen to that if you
[34:04] want oranges I can't give you orange
[34:05] seed and say yeah here brotherh eat this
[34:07] orange amen if you feeling for nandos I
[34:10] can't give you an
[34:12] egg and say here's an
[34:14] Right? So in seed form, it's not in its
[34:18] maturity. What is brother Brandham
[34:20] calling Adam?
[34:21] Seed. So I told you he had to grow up to
[34:24] the statue of Melkazedc. He's calling
[34:27] Adam a spoken seed word of God. He was
[34:30] given a bride to reproduce himself. That
[34:33] is why the bride was given to him to
[34:35] reproduce himself to produce another son
[34:38] of God. But she fell. She fell by
[34:41] hybridization. She caused him to die. So
[34:43] I'm saying the earth had never seen a
[34:45] son of God reproduced in the image of
[34:48] Adam until Jesus Christ came upon the
[34:50] earth. Amen.
[34:54] Amen. Amen.
[34:56] And the now the earth is going to see.
[34:58] That's why all creation is groaning
[35:01] waiting for the manifestation of the
[35:03] sons of God. Amen. Amen. Then now he
[35:07] talks about Jesus also a spoken seed
[35:10] word of God was given a bride like as
[35:13] was Adam. But before he could marry her,
[35:16] she also had fallen. So like Adam's wife
[35:18] was put to the test whether she would
[35:20] believe the word of God and live and
[35:22] doubt the word and died. She doubted.
[35:24] She left the word. She died.
[35:27] Now he's talking about you. So he says
[35:31] from a little group of the true seed of
[35:32] the word. God will present Christ with a
[35:35] beloved bride. She is virgin of his
[35:38] word. She is virgin because she knows no
[35:40] man-made creeds or dogmas by and through
[35:42] the members of the body of the bride
[35:45] will be fulfilled. All that was promised
[35:47] of God to be made manifest in the
[35:49] virgin. Amen. The promised word of God
[35:53] came to Mary. But the word of promise
[35:55] was he himself to be made manifest. God
[35:58] was made manifest himself acted at that
[36:02] time and fulfilled his own word of
[36:04] promise in the virgin. It was an angel
[36:06] that brought her the message. But the
[36:08] angel's message was the word of God.
[36:10] Amen. He quotes the scripture. He
[36:12] fulfilled at that time all that was
[36:14] written of him because she accepted his
[36:18] word to her. Now watch the members of
[36:20] the virgin bride will love him. Can we
[36:23] say that we love him? Amen. And they
[36:25] will love they will have his potentials
[36:31] Lord. You have the potentials of Jesus
[36:33] Christ.
[36:36] For he is their head and all power
[36:38] belongs to him. They are subject to him
[36:41] as members of his own body. Body are
[36:44] subject to the our heads. Now this comes
[36:47] with St. John 5:19. Right? So he's going
[36:49] to give you the scripture here. Now
[36:51] notice the harmony of father and son.
[36:53] Jesus never did anything until it was
[36:56] first showed to him by the
[36:58] father. This harmony is now to exist
[37:01] between the groom and his bride. He
[37:03] shows her the word of life. She receives
[37:06] it. She never doubts it. Therefore,
[37:09] nothing can harm her, not even death.
[37:11] Amen. Now, did we establish that the
[37:14] word is a seed? He's saying she he gives
[37:16] her the word of life which is he gives a
[37:18] seed, she receives it, she never doubts
[37:21] it, nothing can harm her, not even
[37:23] death. For if the seed be planted, the
[37:26] water will rise it up again. Here is the
[37:28] secret. The word, the seed, the will is
[37:31] in the bride. Amen.
[37:35] Amen.
[37:37] The bride has the mind of Christ for she
[37:39] knows what he wants done with the word.
[37:41] She performs the command of the word in
[37:44] his name. Amen. Remember we took it in
[37:46] his name earlier and showed you that's
[37:47] his
[37:48] will.
[37:50] Amen. For she has thus sayeth the Lord.
[37:53] Then watch now. This is where many
[37:55] people are missing it. We have the
[37:58] opening of the word. We have the opening
[37:59] of the word. He says then the word is
[38:02] quickened by the spirit. Amen.
[38:06] Oh, we have the opening of the word. We
[38:08] don't need the Holy Ghost. No, you're
[38:09] wrong.
[38:12] He says the dynamics of this church is a
[38:14] refilling of the Holy Ghost. Amen. He
[38:18] says which we have dealt with in a small
[38:20] measure as we were nearing the
[38:21] headstone. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[38:30] Let's read that. Then the word is
[38:31] quickened. Let's all read it. Then the
[38:34] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[38:37] comes to pass.
[38:39] Amen. The word must be quickened by the
[38:42] spirit.
[38:44] Praise the Lord. Those in the bride do
[38:46] only his will. No one can make them do
[38:49] otherwise. They have thus said the Lord
[38:51] or they keep still. They know it has to
[38:53] be God in them doing the works
[38:55] fulfilling his own work. Now watch what
[38:58] he says. He did not complete all his
[39:01] work while in his earthly ministry. Now
[39:04] he has to work in and through the bride.
[39:07] Amen. So God's not going to come down in
[39:09] a physical form and do things on the
[39:11] earth. Who is he doing it through?
[39:14] Somebody say me.
[39:16] Amen. She knows that it was not time yet
[39:19] for him to do certain things that he
[39:21] must do now. But he now but he will now
[39:25] fulfill through that bride through the
[39:26] bride that work which he left for this
[39:29] specific time. Amen. I don't have time
[39:33] to read the entire letter. You can go
[39:34] home and read it. The prophet of God is
[39:36] going into amen some deeper stuff there.
[39:39] So I am saying he's writing a letter to
[39:42] his bride to his wife to reproduce his
[39:44] life to bring forth the god man species.
[39:48] Amen.
[39:50] Now if I could summarize what the
[39:52] message of the hour is, that's what the
[39:54] message of the hour is. You remember
[39:56] later on in in the years of the prophet
[39:58] when he was still Amen in the latter
[40:02] part and he was having these thoughts
[40:04] about the ministry and leaving it and
[40:06] things and he said Lord okay give me a
[40:09] scripture and the Lord opened up the
[40:11] scripture to Eliza finding a bride for
[40:14] Isaac and he said that's my message he
[40:17] said go hunt my bride
[40:20] how many of you remember that
[40:22] so the ministry of William Random was to
[40:25] find and hunt out the bride that would
[40:27] receive the word of God. Amen. So that
[40:30] Christ could now have a bride. Amen.
[40:32] That he can reproduce his own life.
[40:34] Amen.
[40:39] Amen. I'm going to make it more
[40:42] simple. You can you should be nothing
[40:44] less than Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[40:47] Amen.
[40:48] Amen.
[40:50] We have it. Didn't we read? We have his
[40:52] potentials. Yes.
[40:54] So the effects of the word what it
[40:56] should be having on us is to make us
[40:58] more like Jesus Christ.
[41:03] Hear what the prophet of God saying. Now
[41:05] I'm just want to define the God man
[41:06] species right here in the message
[41:09] question and answers on Genesis. He says
[41:11] when God created me William Brandham I
[41:14] was before the foundation of the world.
[41:17] He made my being my spirit. I wasn't
[41:19] conscious of anything as far as I know.
[41:23] I don't believe you're getting
[41:25] it. Now, just a minute. Jesus told them
[41:28] he knew them before the foundation of
[41:30] the world. Paul said he chose us in him
[41:33] before the world began. Now, there was
[41:35] some part of me or Neville, the rest of
[41:37] you that's in Christ Jesus before the
[41:39] world ever
[41:40] began. And here's to my analysis of
[41:43] that. I think that the people
[41:46] today that are possessed with the
[41:48] spirit, how many of you are possessed
[41:50] with the spirit? Amen. Watch what it
[41:52] says about you. A part of these angelic
[41:55] beings, spirits which rotated off of
[41:58] God.
[42:00] Amen. Amen. Adam was a part of God's
[42:04] spirit that rotated off of him.
[42:07] I told you before if I had to make this
[42:09] pulpit, the substance I would use is
[42:12] wood. So when God is saying, "Let us
[42:14] make man in our image and after our
[42:15] likeness," the substance he used was his
[42:18] own spirit that rotated off of him.
[42:20] Because Adam was a spirit man.
[42:24] Praise the Lord. The first man that God
[42:26] created was his spirit man. That's the
[42:28] God's species that God's trying to
[42:30] reproduce back on the earth.
[42:35] Amen. I pray it's not too hard for you
[42:38] to understand this morning. Amen. Amen.
[42:40] I'm trying to break it down as simply as
[42:41] possible because this is the end result.
[42:44] Adoption of children is the end result.
[42:47] Praise the Lord.
[42:52] He says, "Spirits which rotated off of
[42:54] God that never fell in the beginning and
[42:57] resisted the devil's lie in heaven."
[43:00] Where were you when the sons of
[43:03] God shouted for Amen. Amen. The morning
[43:07] stars sang together. The sons of God
[43:09] shouted for joy. Amen.
[43:13] Praise the
[43:14] Lord. Now, I don't want to read it, but
[43:16] I want you to read. There's only four
[43:18] chapters in the book of Ruth, but it's a
[43:20] very beautiful story of a kinsman
[43:22] redeemer coming to raise up the seed of
[43:24] Elimc.
[43:26] Amen.
[43:28] Ruth's husband was Elamec.
[43:31] And she died without reproducing his
[43:33] life. Oh, sorry. He died without her
[43:35] reproducing his life. So the law came
[43:38] into effect what we read in Deuteronomy
[43:40] 25 that the near kinsman must now raise
[43:44] up seed.
[43:46] So she comes. Amen. You know the story
[43:48] of the character of Ruth. Nowhere in the
[43:50] book of Ruth does it describes
[43:52] Ruth's outward appearance as in a
[43:55] charact facial beauty and all of those
[43:57] things. But what Boaz saw about her was
[44:00] character. Amen.
[44:03] That she knew she was tied to this
[44:05] family.
[44:07] That even a mother-in-law said, "Why
[44:08] don't you go back? I don't have any more
[44:10] sons." She said, "No, your people will
[44:13] be my people. Your God shall be my God.
[44:17] Thank you, Lord.
[44:19] Something inside of her was driving her
[44:20] to go back with her mother-in-law. So,
[44:23] you know how she comes into the field of
[44:25] Boaz. And now Boaz when he sees her,
[44:27] Amen. he starts to talk to the chief
[44:29] reaper. The chief reaper in the story is
[44:32] typing William Brandom.
[44:34] Amen. He is the chief reaper. And he
[44:37] says, "Tell them to drop a little extra
[44:40] for her so that she can collect it."
[44:42] Amen.
[44:44] Praise the Lord.
[44:48] Amen. Some of you guys who are looking
[44:50] for girls, you must go eat boys.
[44:53] You see how he's dropping extra on
[44:55] purpose.
[45:00] Hey, and you'll see how Ruth, you know,
[45:04] some guys are very
[45:06] shy. The girl has to nudge
[45:11] them. Nobody knows what I'm talking
[45:13] about here.
[45:15] Hey, the girl has to like nudge them in
[45:18] the right direction. Caleb, you smiling
[45:23] there.
[45:25] Amen. So if you go and read the book of
[45:27] Ruth now in chapter 3, you'll find Nomi
[45:30] now when she comes back with this
[45:32] handful of six measures of barley or
[45:35] just before that Ruth is saying he is
[45:37] your kinsman. go down to the threshing
[45:42] floor, uncover his
[45:45] feet, praise the
[45:47] Lord, and lay
[45:50] down. So, a very specific time at
[45:54] midnight, Boaz
[45:56] awakes because she uncovered his
[46:01] feet. Amen. And he arose. Now, you got
[46:04] to type in now Matthew 25. At midnight,
[46:06] a cry was made.
[46:09] Praise the Lord. Amen. This has to deal
[46:12] with a shout. Now,
[46:14] the shout part is an old Jewish
[46:18] tradition. That's why the Lord is
[46:20] descending with a shout. It's a loud cry
[46:24] to awaken.
[46:26] Praise the Lord. It's a tradition. If
[46:28] you don't understand the Jewish
[46:29] tradition of marriage, you won't
[46:30] understand what the shout is. The shout
[46:33] is where the bridegroom and his friends
[46:35] come making a loud noise to awaken the
[46:37] bride
[46:39] to let them know that they have arrived.
[46:41] They didn't have WhatsApp then to say,
[46:43] "Babe, I'm around the corner
[46:47] here." So, they had to make a loud shout
[46:53] to bring out the interested parties or
[46:57] the bridal party. Are you getting what
[46:59] the shout is? Amen.
[47:02] Isn't the brother Brandon further
[47:04] defines it to say the the shout gathers
[47:06] the living saints.
[47:08] So the shout is to bring the bride
[47:10] together
[47:12] to take you out of denominations, take
[47:14] you out of religions. The shout is to
[47:16] gather you for the marriage of the lamb.
[47:18] Amen.
[47:20] Praise the Lord.
[47:22] So now she comes, she uncovers his feet.
[47:26] The co cold hair probably awakens him.
[47:29] And when he sees there, he asked
[47:32] her, "Who are you?" Now remember, you're
[47:36] living in a time where there were a lot
[47:38] of things going on. She didn't come
[47:40] there for to be intimate with Boaz.
[47:45] She didn't uncover his feet to be
[47:46] intimate with him. And Boaz is also very
[47:49] respectful. He wants to identify who she
[47:52] is. I'm asking you, do you know who you
[47:54] are? Because Boaz askked her, who are
[47:57] you? Amen. Identify yourself. Amen.
[48:02] What happened if she had amnesia?
[48:05] She starts to say who she is. I'm Ruth
[48:08] the Moabites who came with Naomi and
[48:11] then she asked doesn't ask anything for
[48:14] herself. She asks for the redemption of
[48:16] Naomi.
[48:20] Praise the Lord.
[48:23] Then Boaz starts to tell her, "I am not
[48:26] the dear kinsman. There is one who is
[48:28] more nearer to me. In the morning, I'm
[48:31] going to go before the elders and I'm
[48:34] going to now tell him that he must
[48:37] redeem your husband's
[48:39] property." Amen. Raise up now Naomi's
[48:42] bloodline
[48:44] again. So anyway, he gives her six
[48:46] measures of Bali. And you know, six
[48:48] measures he's giving her because the
[48:50] seventh measure is Boaz himself. Amen.
[48:52] You know, all of those types. So when
[48:54] she goes back and shows Naomi all of
[48:56] these things, Naomi says, "This man
[48:58] won't rest till this matter is
[48:59] finished." So in the morning, Boaz
[49:01] awakes. He comes, gathers all the
[49:02] elders. Now think Revelation 5. Jesus
[49:05] comes before the elders. Now, Amen.
[49:10] Amen. Yes. He must have the book of
[49:13] redemption. Boaz must have the legal
[49:16] right to redeem them otherwise he can't
[49:18] do anything. Jesus must take the book
[49:20] otherwise he can't do any further works.
[49:25] Praise the Lord. Amenise. So Boaz now
[49:28] declares it true. Amen. The near
[49:30] kinsman. And this man tells him yes I
[49:34] will redeem the land. Boaz
[49:37] is he says okay no problem. You want to
[49:41] redeem the land, you must also marry
[49:44] Ruth and you must raise up children.
[49:46] Amen. Hey, this guy says, "Now," he
[49:49] says, "No, that doesn't sound good to
[49:51] me, lest I m my
[49:54] inheritance." Amen. Cuz remember, he
[49:57] also had children. And if he raised up
[50:01] seed, that boy was raised up now would
[50:04] want his inheritance. He wasn't prepared
[50:07] to share his inheritance. So what I am
[50:09] trying to tell you in this last days
[50:11] charity is important
[50:16] is not the headstone charity. Yes.
[50:20] Yes. Capstone coming grace. Grace to be
[50:24] able to redeem your brother's property
[50:26] means you must have charity. Yes.
[50:29] To be able to avenge your brother's
[50:31] blood because that's what the goal of
[50:33] the redeemer was as well. If somebody
[50:35] killed him, he must avenge his blood.
[50:37] You must have charity because now you
[50:39] are going to sacrifice your own
[50:42] resources. You're going to avenge it
[50:44] yourself. You now have to take on
[50:46] another man's wife and raise up
[50:50] sea. And if you don't have charity, how
[50:53] are you going to do it? Amen.
[50:56] How you going to go after your lost
[50:58] fallen brother? If you don't have
[51:00] charity, how you going to prophesy
[51:01] again? Amen. Amen. Without charity, we
[51:06] will sit and we'll say, "I got the
[51:07] message. It's okay."
[51:09] But charity will drive you to prophesy
[51:11] again. Amen.
[51:14] Praise the
[51:15] Lord. So Boaz now tells him, "You got to
[51:18] raise up seed." Then he declines. He
[51:20] says, "Lest time my inheritance." So
[51:23] Boaz is happy now because even though
[51:26] he's redeeming Naomi and her
[51:29] property, he's high. His heart is fixed
[51:32] on
[51:33] Ruth. He declares immediately to them,
[51:36] "This day I will redeem no homie and a
[51:38] property, and I'm also telling you, I'm
[51:40] going to take root to be my wife."
[51:44] Amen.
[51:47] Amen.
[51:48] Now, just to go back to Jesus, I'm going
[51:51] to close now.
[51:54] Amen. To take the
[51:56] book. Amen. Is also a type
[52:00] to redeem the woman that came out of his
[52:02] side at Calvary. So Jesus is appearing
[52:05] now in Revelation chapter 5 because
[52:07] remember there was a bride that was
[52:09] taken out of his side at Calvary.
[52:12] Hallelujah. Yes. But now he's he's there
[52:14] in the intercessory role for 2,000
[52:16] years. But he has no legal rights unless
[52:19] he has Adam's book. Amen.
[52:25] Remember the prophet now is telling us
[52:27] when Adam fell he lost his book.
[52:30] inheritance. The book went back to
[52:31] heaven. So, he must now get the book in
[52:34] order for him to reproduce his life back
[52:36] on the earth.
[52:39] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[52:44] I wonder if we are catching this that
[52:46] what we are going to end up is going to
[52:48] be far greater than Pentecost.
[52:50] Hallelujah.
[52:53] Yes. Hello.
[52:59] In no other time and season was the book
[53:01] taken but now. The book wasn't taken in
[53:03] the days of Peter. The book wasn't taken
[53:06] in the days of Paul or somebody get it.
[53:08] Amen. The book was only taken now in
[53:11] 1963. Yes. Amen. Amen. Yes. Now watch
[53:16] what brother Brandham says here. So
[53:17] after Amen. So we know that after two
[53:19] 2,000 years of church history, it's time
[53:22] and now in the end time, there's a woman
[53:25] Amen. that finds herself where a
[53:28] denominational husband is dead. So she
[53:31] now needs C to raise up, right? Remember
[53:33] what we read there? Jesus' bride also
[53:37] fell. So he has to find another. So he
[53:41] can't marry her if he doesn't redeem
[53:42] her. So he comes looking for his queen.
[53:45] Showing us what his intention is. Here's
[53:47] the quote in the bridge paragraph 228.
[53:50] There he says, "The lamb is the only
[53:53] mediator. He was the one that come
[53:55] forth. And what did he do now? He had
[53:58] been back here interceding until his
[54:00] blood had atoned for every person. And
[54:02] the lamb now knows what's written in the
[54:05] book. He know from the foundation of the
[54:07] world the names that were in there. So
[54:09] he stood back there done mediator work
[54:12] like until the mediatorial work till
[54:15] everyone that's been put in the book has
[54:17] been redeemed and it's finished. And now
[54:19] he walks out. He's done his kinsman
[54:21] work. You know what the kinsman work
[54:23] was? To testify before the elders. You
[54:26] remember Boaz taking off his shoe and so
[54:28] forth. He has done all this
[54:32] now. Now he comes to take his
[54:35] bride. Now he comes as king. He is
[54:39] looking for his
[54:41] queen. Lord. Amen. Amen. In this book is
[54:46] the old secret of it wrapped up around
[54:48] seven seals. Oh brother, seven seals
[54:52] waiting for him to come. Amen. So the
[54:55] book is giving him legal rights to take
[54:57] this woman
[54:59] you like it gave Boaz the legal right to
[55:02] take Ruth.
[55:04] The taking of the book gave him the
[55:06] legal right to redeem you
[55:11] to reproduce his life in you. Right here
[55:14] the prophet of God is saying sorry in 1
[55:16] Corinthians chapter 6:1 19 it's saying
[55:19] knowing not that your body is the temple
[55:21] of the Holy Ghost which is in
[55:24] you which you have of God and you are
[55:27] not of your own for you are bought with
[55:29] a price. Therefore glorify God in your
[55:32] body and in your spirit which are God's.
[55:34] So we have been bought with a price. The
[55:36] kinsman redeemer paid the price for us.
[55:38] Amen. Ephesians 1:13:14, I got the
[55:42] amplified here. He's telling us that the
[55:44] Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost is the
[55:46] guarantee. The prophet calls it a down
[55:49] payment. Amen. Amen. He's calling it
[55:51] here. Amen. The first fruits. He's
[55:54] calling it Amen. He's calling it here
[55:57] the installment, the down payment of our
[56:00] inheritance until the redemption of
[56:02] God's own purchased possession to the
[56:04] praise of his glory. So, the Holy Ghost
[56:06] is the down payment. Amen. Amen. The
[56:09] spirit of God is is the guarantee that
[56:11] he will give us the rest of the
[56:13] inheritance.
[56:16] Amen. Luke 8:11. I just want to read
[56:19] this so you get the scripture. Now, the
[56:21] parable is this. The seed is the word of
[56:24] God. Amen. It's further down in the
[56:26] quotes. I'll just skip some things in.
[56:28] The seed is the word of God. Now, I'm
[56:31] going to close by saying this. No seed
[56:33] can grow unless it's planted in a beding
[56:35] ground. Amen. It must receive water,
[56:39] light, air, amen, to germinate your
[56:41] life. Praise the Lord. So, we establish
[56:44] the word of God is a seed. And the seed
[56:46] word must have a bing ground. And God
[56:48] has chosen you as the bedding ground for
[56:50] the word of God to be planted and grown.
[56:53] Amen. Praise the Lord. In the rapture
[56:56] message, Jesus wants fruit for himself.
[56:59] Amen. His wife must bring forth the
[57:01] children that he
[57:02] is. Amen. Bright children were children
[57:06] in the message second coming of the
[57:08] Lord. The church is married to Christ.
[57:11] We are the wife of Christ bringing forth
[57:13] children.
[57:15] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[57:23] So now I'm going to close with this
[57:27] thought to tell you again and reiterate
[57:29] that the taking of the book gave the
[57:32] redeemer the right to reproduce his life
[57:35] in you. Amen. Because he has a right
[57:39] over every one of those names that are
[57:41] in the book.
[57:44] So will now you have a choice. Will you
[57:47] be like Vasti and and refuse it
[57:50] or will you come like Esther? Amen.
[57:53] Amen. The new queen.
[57:56] He's looking for his queen. He's writing
[57:59] a love letter to you. Amen. Telling you
[58:01] about the law of reproduction.
[58:07] Amen. So we can't just be singing I want
[58:09] to be more and more like Jesus. He wants
[58:11] to have his life in you. Amen. When it
[58:15] is all said and done, we will have an
[58:17] army of Jesus.
[58:20] Each one fitly framed together. Amen.
[58:22] Amen. Each one fitly framed together.
[58:26] Amen. I'll close on that. Amen. How many
[58:30] of you feel like it is too much of a
[58:33] ask?
[58:36] If we are feeling like it's too much of
[58:38] a ask or too much of a thing, then we
[58:40] have missed the main thing because we
[58:43] can't produce this. It's the Holy Ghost
[58:46] in us. Amen. That's doing the work.
[58:49] Amen. So the only thing we can do is to
[58:52] yield oursel to the Holy Spirit, the
[58:55] Holy Ghost, and say, "Holy Ghost, I give
[58:57] you full control of my spirit being, my
[59:00] flesh being, my soul. have full control.
[59:03] Yes. As I'm taking in the word, let it
[59:06] bring forth the life of Christ in me.
[59:08] Amen. Because the word that you're
[59:11] receiving in your heart, put it on your
[59:13] lips. He says, "Satan can't stand before
[59:16] you." Amen. Now, with that, I want you
[59:19] to stand together. Amen. And I want you
[59:22] to be able to now ask the
[59:25] Lord, "Am I the right kind of wife? Am I
[59:30] allowing you to put your seed word in
[59:32] me?
[59:35] Do you know there are some woman who
[59:36] receive seed and go on to abort the
[59:39] seed?
[59:41] Jesus talks about it about how the seed
[59:43] is sown. He says sometimes they grow a
[59:46] little while and then the cares of this
[59:47] life come and choke them up. Yes.
[59:51] He says some will rejoice for a little
[59:53] while but
[59:55] then other things come in the way and
[59:58] choke it as well. But then he says there
[1:00:00] are some seed that fall on good ground
[1:00:03] that bring forth the hundfold that
[1:00:06] starts to
[1:00:07] multiply. So the question is again am I
[1:00:11] the right kind of
[1:00:13] wife receiving the seed of
[1:00:17] God? Amen.
[1:00:26] Hallelujah. While the musicians come, I
[1:00:27] want you. Thank you, Lord. Amen. All be
[1:00:30] reverent.
[1:00:35] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:00:38] We can't expect to see a display
[1:00:41] of the God man
[1:00:43] species if we don't come as a submissive
[1:00:46] wife to him. Hallelujah.
[1:00:48] So I want you to repeat after me. Dear
[1:00:51] Lord,
[1:00:52] am I the right kind of wife
[1:00:55] who is allowing you
[1:00:57] to have redemptions right
[1:01:01] and reproduce your life in me?
[1:01:11] Amen. Thank you
[1:01:15] Jesus. Amen. And as you ponder on
[1:01:18] that, I want you to examine your daily
[1:01:21] activities, your daily lifestyle, and
[1:01:24] see how if we allowing the cares of life
[1:01:27] to choke the seed word from developing
[1:01:29] in us, the kind of communications we
[1:01:32] have, the kind of interactions we
[1:01:34] have. Otherwise, you know, we can go on
[1:01:37] having church and just having good old
[1:01:39] sermons and the word not really have an
[1:01:42] effect on us.
[1:01:44] How about this morning we really take
[1:01:49] stock of our lives and see in our daily
[1:01:53] lives are we allowing the word to take
[1:01:56] root in our hearts and reproduce his
[1:01:58] life in us
[1:02:01] I don't want to go for years and years
[1:02:03] and years 10 years 20 years 30 years and
[1:02:05] see no growth something is wrong

[1:04:07] the Lord now? Just worship him. Say
[1:04:09] father I can't expect to see adoption of
[1:04:11] son if I don't reproduce your life as
[1:04:14] wife oh God
[1:04:16] father I want you to have full access to
[1:04:19] me Lord Lord let your word have free
[1:04:22] course in my life oh God help me oh God
[1:04:24] to apply your word with faith in my
[1:04:26] heart oh God and Lord that your holy
[1:04:29] spirit will come upon the word and
[1:04:30] quicken it lord to life oh god that I
[1:04:33] can reproduce your very own life oh god
[1:04:36] I can lord reproduce lord that god meth
[1:04:38] species. Lord, the kind of man that Adam
[1:04:41] was supposed to be, but he died, oh God,
[1:04:44] having not reproduced his own life, oh
[1:04:46] God. But Lord, in the fullness of time,
[1:04:48] God had sent forth his son, oh God, to
[1:04:51] raise up Adam's seed again.
[1:04:56] Oh, to give us a new birth,
[1:04:59] he said, except a man be born of water
[1:05:01] and spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:05:04] heaven. Lord, Lord, are you sent forth,
[1:05:07] Lord, our Lord Jesus Christ to come as
[1:05:10] the kinsman redeemer to pay that price
[1:05:13] with your very own blood. Oh God, we
[1:05:16] thank you, Lord, for that perfect work,
[1:05:17] that perfect sacrifice, oh God, that was
[1:05:20] shed on the cross of Calvary, Lord. And
[1:05:23] we know, Lord Jesus, he conquered death,
[1:05:25] hell, and the grave.
[1:05:28] And when he rose up, he rose up
[1:05:29] triumphant and he said, "I am he that
[1:05:32] was dead and now I'm alive and have the
[1:05:35] keys of death and of hell."
[1:05:38] And Lord, all that you work to achieve,
[1:05:40] you don't keep it to yourself. But Lord,
[1:05:43] through the church ages, you were
[1:05:45] working and paying that price at Lord
[1:05:49] redeeming Lord for 2,000 years. Every
[1:05:51] name that was in that book, we find Lord
[1:05:54] now in the end time when those names
[1:05:56] were revealed. Oh God, you could come
[1:05:58] back out of the sanctuary and take the
[1:06:00] book. The inheritance, the rights for
[1:06:03] redemption was now in your hand, oh God.
[1:06:06] Thank you. But Lord, the bride was not
[1:06:09] in heaven. Thank you, Lord. The bride
[1:06:11] was on the earth. So therefore, you come
[1:06:14] now in Revelation 10
[1:06:17] to bring the book back to the earth.
[1:06:18] Yes. To a woman, John, the type of the
[1:06:22] bride. Yes. to a woman who can now
[1:06:26] receive the seed word and eat the book,
[1:06:29] take the book and reproduce the life of
[1:06:32] Christ, now there's a God species on the
[1:06:35] earth. Now there's a God species on the
[1:06:37] earth that can prophesy again. Thank
[1:06:40] you, Lord. Tell them about redemption's
[1:06:42] rights. Oh God, how we love you, Lord
[1:06:44] Jesus. Help us, Lord, to treasure that
[1:06:47] which we have, oh God. Help us, Lord,
[1:06:49] not to take lightly which we have, oh
[1:06:51] God.
[1:06:52] Oh hallelujah. We give you praise. We
[1:06:55] give you glory. We give you honor Lord.
[1:06:57] All that the prophet worked to achieve.
[1:06:59] Oh God. All the sacrifices he made.
[1:07:01] Lord, let it not go in vain. Father, I
[1:07:04] pray Lord you'll raise up a people. Oh
[1:07:06] God. You'll raise up this army. Oh God.
[1:07:09] Father. Sometimes it may seem dead
[1:07:12] former Lord. But raise up Lord that bone
[1:07:15] in that valley Lord Jesus. Raise up a
[1:07:17] powerful army oh God. Oh, raise up that
[1:07:20] super church. Raise up that super race.
[1:07:22] Oh God, Lord, I want to be a part of it,
[1:07:25] Lord. I want to be a part of that
[1:07:26] program, Lord Jesus. I want to be a part
[1:07:29] of your economy, Lord Jesus. Thank you.
[1:07:31] Oh, forgive us, Lord, where we were
[1:07:33] slotsful. Forgive us, Lord, where we
[1:07:35] haven't allowed you to work, oh God, in
[1:07:37] your full measure, Lord Jesus. And I'm
[1:07:39] praying even now, Lord, that you will do
[1:07:41] a work, oh God. I pray you will take
[1:07:44] every pride, Lord, and kill it, Lord
[1:07:46] Jesus. I pray Lord we will apply the
[1:07:48] word the token in our lives Lord Jesus
[1:07:50] that Lord we will take this word oh God
[1:07:52] and realize the reason we are not seeing
[1:07:54] adoption of sons is because wives have
[1:07:57] not taken his seed yet
[1:08:00] have not given him reproductive rights
[1:08:01] yet
[1:08:03] oh God I pray Lord Jesus that we will
[1:08:06] not worry about our shape our figure we
[1:08:09] will not worry about the cares of this
[1:08:10] life oh God but we will love Jesus
[1:08:13] Christ thank you father oh full access
[1:08:16] to have the seed word, the opening of
[1:08:18] the word to come and have effect. Not
[1:08:21] just the revelation of the word, oh God,
[1:08:23] but Lord, let that revelation come to
[1:08:25] manifestation, Lord, where we allow you
[1:08:29] to have a son again. We allow you, Lord,
[1:08:33] to bring forth your own
[1:08:35] life. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:39] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
