be here amen it's meant to be taken out amen it's meant for the bride for the body of Christ amen so we thank God that you know God prophecy comes to pass in God's way Amen in God's timing and in the way he does things uh the word of God can go forth but he makes his word come to pass by when it happens amen and so we just got to remain faithful in the things of God and that's what we want to do we want to be found faithful in our duty post wherever he's placed us amen amen we want to be found faithful in the things that he has called us to until we leave this earth amen amen until we make until we go into the rapture we want to be found faithful in our father's business amen that's what we want we don't to be about any other business amen every other business is temporary we got our jobs we've got all the things that we do in this circular life those are necessary but it's temporary yes but our father's business the things that we do are Eternal it has an eternal purpose amen amen and it's the only thing that can give us fulfillment if you are truly a bride of Christ amen if you're truly calling this hour the only thing that will give you true fulfillment is fulfilling your father's business amen amen so we got our Bibles this morning and turn to the book of of Revelation reading from chapter 19 verse 7 the bible says let us be glad and rejoice so say the way it's saying you to be glad and rejoice amen and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come amen and his wife had made herself ready amen amen so you can't take anything out of the Bible you can't add anything to the Bible and the Bible whatever is written there must come to pass amen every scripture must be fulfilled amen you may be seated so the Bible is saying let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready why we give honor to him because it's what he has already done amen he's come to sacrifice to be the sacrificial lamb he's come to make provision for his bride amen and he's come to sacrifice his life for his bride Greater Love Greater Love at no man that he that laid out his life for his friends amen it is Christ that come down and knew that you couldn't save yourself he knew that he had to be the atonement amen yes amen and nothing could stop that love put him on the cross amen love put him on Calvary amen his love for you and I because why locked up in him were you and I yes locked up with in him even when he went on Calvary his street we were locked up in him amen amen and out of his side we came forth amen we speaking this morning on the marriage of the lamb and the bride's responsibility amen so we know that the bride the marriage of the Lamb is not something that happened after the Rapture amen it's taking place right now amen under the shout amen Revelation 10:1 says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pullet of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Ro it and when he cried seven Thunders utter their voices we know that the mighty angel coming down with an open book he come with a three-fold purpose that is a shout a voice and a trump amen as he's descending is doing all three things amen and the shout is what to gather the living Saints amen amen to to to to what to put you into the secret place amen this great secret amen that the world knows nothing about that is an invisible Union that been taking place amen what it was that this prophet of God had to wait on the earth till till he receive the message and the message was what a message was for a bride amen amen yes amen and while he was called from 1946 to God in the field he was busy fishing amen and under the first two pool he fishing but he was fishing for that for that third pool for that rainbow trout amen but he had to wait for a message amen and the message comes down in 1963 amen and this message amen that is preaching to Pentecostal babes was Tau up in books and tapes because it was the Holy Ghost that was going to run this Trail again and it was the Holy Ghost that is going to take this message around the world and it was the Holy Ghost that going to pick you and I going to pick people in different parts of the Earth in different kindreds and tongues in different nations and going to bring this Holy Ghost message to them and they are going to identify with his message because they have representation within them amen within them lies the Gen of God Amen and when the word strikes there amen when light comes and Strikes the Gen oh it steps forth into life amen hallelujah thank you Jesus but where were you lying for all these years you are lying in denominational Graves amen amen amen but in the rising of the S amen amen this St body this cold body the sty body that was dead in denominational Graves had to step forth into life am amen amen so we know that the marriage of the Lamb is the most one of the most glorious event in the history of redemption Amen in the entire God's Plan of Redemption this is a glorious event amen this is the union of Christ and his bride yes amen the elect who have been called out Chosen and sealed in this day amen this is not an event to come but a reality not to come in the future now it's a reality that's unfolding right now where this Union where he said father may they be one even as we are one amen this Oneness is taking place right now this Oneness is where Christ now has moved away from a oneman Ministry he's moved now in bright form amen he's walking once again in you and I he's working once again in a many member body that's why it was time where he said John 42 y shall do the Greater Works that was stored up for the bride amen so we know that they all this was spoken of but they had to be a bride amen because why for the next we know that the wedding supper takes place in the sky but yeah is where the marriage takes place amen yeah is where the union takes place amen that's why many he said many will come to me in the days said Lord have I not prophesied in your name I have not done this in your name but he said depart from me workers of iniquity I never knew you not amen they did not come into a union he says and that we know there's going to be a BRI there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies just that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church amen and they going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice it said she has made herself ready now we know that when Adam and Eve sinned the glory of God departed from them and they were seen to be naked amen but before that before the sin comes in they were clothed amen not with Earthly clothing as you think but with the glory of God amen amen and just like them that the Bible speaks about the souls under the altar that they were given robes they are to be given robes but blessed are they that come under the first resurrection amen the rest of the day don't come up in the first resurrection amen when there's going to be a resurrection now that is those that are in Christ will come up amen that means those that are in the union those that make up the bride from Seven Church ages right until now they will come up in his resurrection not the rest of the dead because he said blessed are those that come up in the first resurrection the rest of the Dead comes up in the second Resurrection amen but those that come up in the first resurrection already have The Robe Hallelujah the rest of the Dead they were chosen they were given robes amen you find that many came out of tribulation they were given robes even the souls on were given robes but you already in yeah right now when you come under the union you've already given the wedding robe amen which is the Holy Ghost amen which is the righteousness of the Saints which is what his word has come to clothe you amen the message of the hour the Holy Ghost message has come to clothe you in this hour thank you Lord so we find that those that will come up in the first resurrection are those that died in Christ or are all part of the union or part of the marriage Union amen and then we which are alive and remain because we are being clothed right now amen clothed with his word amen we will have a body change amen amen so he says there going and he said we know that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be his church and they going to appear before him without spot and wrinkle and they have the materi on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice it said she has made herself ready so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you've got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other's end and then saying blessed disas that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself amen amen he made us free modal agents amen I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God Abraham was promised a child but he must maintain his promise for 25 years the ups and downs that he had and Temptations in those 25 years but he held on to the word of the promise amen and Israel was promised a Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of it wherever The Souls of your foot Treads upon that have I given you God said to Joshua it was all there the land was there and God gave it to him but they must fight for it amen the same way it is about Divine Healing God has got the power to heal you if you got the courage to accept it but you have to fight every inch of the way amen so amen he's given us the overcoming he's anointed us with an anointing to overcome every UNL of the devil in this day amen every attack of the enemy in his day but he said all we are Co with Christ he's given us his inheritance amen we are partakers of his inheritance but but you got to fight every inch of the way amen how do you fight you got to keep in your position you got to recognize who you are you got to recognize what the word says about you you got to recognize that you wrestle not against flesh and blood you don't fight the devil with flesh and blood you fight him with spirit in in spiritual warfare amen thank you Lord amen the Bible say with prayers and supplication so we know that the marriage of the Lamb it's a Divine Union right so now in this Union many it's not meant for everybody we know Matthew 25 speaks about the V wise virgin and the foolish virgins amen but those that were shut up with him they were in a union in a secret Union so many will come and say oh but I'm glad I can shout I can sing I can dance I can enjoy all this healing and enjoy all his benefits but they wouldn't accept all the word this is the ones that love the word this is the ones wants to come in completeness of the word you want all of the word we don't want some of the word we want all of the word amen you have an appetite all the time you have a craving within you and all the time the devil was trying to satisfy that thirst amen until you come to draw and drink from this inexhaustible fountain of life amen until you come to to drink from this Fountain of Living Waters yes Lord amen and when you and what happened you began to have a holy man's taste you began to put on a thinking man's filter your taste bus began to change once you walk like the people of the world lasting after the things of the Flesh and all the things that the people of the world seek after but when you came into realization of who you truly are when you come to the knowledge of the truth of who you truly are and what God purpose for you are then you begin to realize I'm not like every other person there's something different about me because why and I coming now I have I am called to come into the union with Christ amen I am the bride of Christ don't you know that is the same bride don't you know the the the bride she's going to judge the Earth yes all the people that's claiming to have all the the things of the world and claiming to have land and TR and so forth but it's the bride that's going to judge the Earth that's right the only difference is the Earth at the moment is not a f dwelling place for you to dwell in yes that is why he has to renovate the Earth before you come and dwell in it amen it's going to renovated just for you amen he's going to make it a foot dwelling place for you he's going to bring it back to Eden again so we find that Paul is saying in 2 Corinthians 11 to for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I espouse you to one husband that I may present you a Chase virgin to Christ now Paul is already saying that because he can see what was starting in the church and then we know what happened after that but we know that God always had a little group of people through all all the ages though Satan was trying to to to to copy what God did and bring his own church God is still got a selected group of people in every age who is making up the body which is making up the bride amen but we find that this bride is from all the bloodlines on the earth she was she is the most purest and cleanest blood light on the earth because why she's washed with the blood of the Lamb amen is Justified she never sin in the first place amen but she's got a responsibility amen there's a responsibility upon her let's see what the prophet says about that and then invisible un say now notice she has a sacred Trust of virtue that's been given her trusted to her by the Lord God gave her that virtue and just as it was in the Garden of Eden she can say yes or no she has a sacred Trust of Womanhood committed to her that she must not break the Womanhood I'm speaking of is a conduct a character around men now now he's speaking here he's going to Propet going to take you to the Natural side and the spiritual side on the spiritual side we know what he's talking about not to go into any man-made system or any man-made dogmas and Creeds amen but to remain faithful to the word because the bridegroom is the word and she loves nothing else but the word but when she's venturing out into the world and out of the world then what she's doing now she's breaking that sacred trust amen amen but he's calling her now to because she's committed it's a responsibility that when his word is given to her she has a sacred responsibility amen that she's got to be faithful to the word amen she's got to display the word she's got to operate under the same word amen that he was operating under and she's got to manifest him amen because she is going to bear for Christ amen amen she was she had to have a virgin home amen and she had to take this unadulterated word and receive of it and say like Mary beat unto me according to th word and then she had to reproduce Jesus Christ amen it had to be nothing less than Jesus Christ again on display amen he says what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see while she's a type of the Church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to a husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to word and to Christ just the same as the woman has amen so our dedication to the things of God Amen because why this word has come to place us into our position yes amen amen because it brings us into a place where God can use us amen because if you didn't come under this word he couldn't use you he had to come bring you under this word and then bring you from call you for a total separation from all unbelief only when you come from a total separation from all unbelief and you believe only his word then he can bring you now into the land into the land of the Holy Ghost into this land of inheritance amen and then you can be placed in the land amen and when you are placed in the land then you're going to be fulfilling your responsibility of the body amen now we know that uh we when the when the wedding call went forth there was a budding being done amen Luke 14:15 speaks about it in Luke 14:15 it says and when one of them that sat at meet with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and made and bath many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bden come for all things are already now and they are all with one consent began to make excuses excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground I must need go and see I pray the have me excused and another said and I have bought and I must and another said I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray the have me excuse and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord this thing then the master of the house being angry said to his servants go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in either the poor and the m and the alt and blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and edges and compel them to come in that my house may be fulfilled for I say unto you that none of those men which were burden shall Chase of my supper amen so those that rejected rejected this messenger's word amen will not taste of the supper amen Matthew 22 also bring the same illustration it says and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by Parable and saying the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were burden to the wedding and they would not come and again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are burden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are already come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servant and treated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was rought and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burnt up their cities now we know to seven Church ages what happened each messenger was rejected amen as they was going out during the bedding for the wedding supper each messenger was rejected except the ones that were sealed away amen and he said destroyed the murders and burned up their city so we know eventually this city this Roman church amen this church this Babylonian system is going to be burnt up in an hour amen amen then said he to his servant the wedding is ready but they which were burden were not worthy go you therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find but to the marriage so the servants went out into the highways and gathered as many as they found both good both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guest and when the king came in to see guest he saw there a man which had not a wedding garment and he said unto him friend how CEST thou in either not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the king to the servants buy any man and food and take away and casting into other doctors there shall be weeping and ning of teeth for many are called but few are chosen so see this one comes in with his own way coming to his own seminar coming to his own denominational system that doesn't work amen we got to come in the way the God has called us to the shout Amen to the message of the hour amen and we know the key to the age was the prophet amen he that received a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet reward amen Ephesians 5277 says that he might present it to himself of a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen so we find that we know that the prophet always told us that perfect faith is recognizing your position in the word amen and seeing this word being interpreted in your own life now we can see this we can we can recognize the word for somebody else but until we seeing the see the word being interpreted in our personal lives amen then we are not recognizing our position when Jesus came he took the scripture and he read the scripture that pertained to him when the prophet came he went up to Revelation 10 1-7 amen but he didn't go to tell Revelation 108 to1 because that was for another people amen but he knew that there was going to be a people that will come and receive this word that will take the book that will eat the book amen yes that will become one with the word amen that this word will be the makeup will become part of the word and then when we recognize that when we recognize when we see that word now being interpreted in our own life amen what we see that that scripture pertains to us we are coming to this Union with his with his bridegroom and we are in so much in love with him amen that every time we hearing about him his word we we have so much in love with his word we don't want to deny this word amen we want to accept every part of this word yes we want to live out this word amen amen amen and we love this word so much that we can't wait now to see him physically see him amen amen we know everyone is Will to physically see him but we are going to have that opportunity but right now he's here amen yes he's here in word form amen he's come to unite with us yes and when we are coming in Oneness with him amen that you you are now tied to self once you was a slave to sin you just change your Masters now amen amen amen but this master now he's got giv you eternal life amen amen this master is not holding you bondage this master is not accusing you this master is saying that you are sinless spotless bright this master is saying you a super Church you an invincible Army this master is saying you are a super race this master is saying I give you you are partakers of my inheritance you are partakers of my divine nature amen you are word of my Word Flesh of My Flesh amen thank you Lord thank you Jesus oh you have become my the my mouthpiece you are the final voice in the final age amen yes Lord that's what this m is saying but now you're saying I die to self so it's no longer the I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me so you become so much of part of him that now it's all Christ being displayed you surrender your own thoughts you surrender the eye WS your own thinking your own reasonings amen Because deep within you there the battle same like the the difference between AA and Sarah amen right within you there's a AA and a Sarah amen there's the born woman and the free woman amen amen but the free woman shall rule amen amen this the free woman is the one because in marriage there's a responsibility there's there's a something that takes place in marriage amen the bride takes the husband's name amen she's no longer under her own name she takes the husband name and she become one now what does the name speaks of a name speaks in a name it has identification in a name it has status in a name it Bears Authority amen so if you are taking on Christ's name you take take on his status you take on his identification you take on his authority amen that's why you are called Mrs Jesus Christ he said I not call you Mrs Jesus Christ amen and if he is the word then you must be the word yes amen thank you Lord he says in this message in the message marriage of the Lamb he says and that's the way the churches are too many today we just taking the name of Christian Church pretending to be the bride when it's artificial we not connected with Christ in any way we like an artificial toot artificial arm artificial ey see it's something that's artificial if we just putting it on well you can't put on Christianity you've got to be connected with it and then a church that just artificial called The Church of Christ well so what he trying to say you can have an artificial toot right if you don't have a toot you can put on an artificial toot that's fine but if but it's not connected to you right it's there to help you but it's not connected to you amen and said then a church that just artificial call the Church of Christ well them children then are not in there that's born of the same organization that's not Christ children they are denominational children not children of Christ if the woman isn't connected with the man in tress then they that then it isn't a husband he just a man that she's taken a vow to live with and she took a wrong vow she pledged to love him and she and she said she loved him and she didn't do it all the time the man is deceived but there's only but there's one thing sure friends we're not going to deceive Christ he knows his own amen that's why you always say you want to know if someone loves if truly in this word give them a word test then you'll see a different side of them you see a lot of people I love Jesus I love the things of God and they love to they will shout and sing and everything but give him the word chest tell him this is what the word says You must do come into the repentance be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the word s the prophet in his day this is what the word says our woman should behave there should be no woman preachers all these things give them the wordes and then you'll see whether they truly love Christ if the woman so you'll know that they not connected with Christ amen if they're not connected with the word his pledge to love him and he said but the but you see first decisions he said he's talking about in a marriage now first decisions are made the next is the engagement and then is the promise amen so you make a decision that you want to serve Christ amen you have to make this decision on your own this decision nobody can force you this has to be a personal decision amen if you are coming to church because your wife is coming to church then there's a problem you haven't sincerely made that decision you are coming because your husband coming to the church only then you haven't made the decision you are coming because your parents are coming to church then you haven't come to the point of making the decision you've got to make the decision to follow Christ amen when on in Acts 238 in the book of Acts when the Holy Ghost came down and the apostles being filled with the Holy Ghost they preaching preaching this profound sermon and the people being pricked in the Heart by the sermon they be convicted now and now they want to know what do we do now Peter we believe we we we believe the things you are saying but what do we do now to be saved now he's giving them Peter is opening the keys to the kingdom amen amen because didn't Jesus say scriptures f scriptures before that amen before Jesus death when he said who do who do people say the son of man is amen who do you say that the son of man is and he said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God and he said Peter Upon This Rock This Rock of spiritual Revelation I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen so the church is always built upon spiritual Revelation and he said I give you the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven what you loose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven and here's Peter opening the keys now he had spiritual Revelation amen yes sir and he says firstly you're all believing this right now to come in this way you got to repent every one of you first you must come by repentance there's no shortcut in Christianity amen you've got to come by repentance cuz the Bible says for all have sin and fallen short of the glory of God everybody coming to God must come to repentance don't try to caught a girl and get happy that she's just coming visiting your church and thinking because she's visiting your church started to wear long dresses stop wearing makeup she's going to believe this message if she hasn't come by true repentance amen you've got to give them the word test same with the girls cting a boy don't let them be excited the boy just following you and coming to church he just doing that for maybe other reasons give them the word test amen what is the way the criteria it can't change it hasn't changed through all the church AG from the time it started repent every one of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen for the remission of your sins so are you remitting sins now at the bread of Christ you have the power to remit sin God has given you the authority to do that but you got to follow you got to come and take the same criteria you tell the people repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins so you're going to give them the antidote you're going to give them the criteria amen and you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen you shall receive that robe amen so youve got to give him that criteria amen so you as the bride the wife of Jesus Christ that come into a union with him now because roles and responsibility changes in marriage courtship is different from marriage in courtship everything is loving everything is nice all good times amen but in marriage you got to go to trials and testings amen amen in a true marriage you have must go to trial and testing now every son and daughter of God must be tried and tested in the fire amen gold must go into the fire amen so we find that in marriage you must be tried and tested but you are the one saying no I stand with my beloved bridegroom my husband amen I take every word of his no matter what the what the circumstances might be no matter what sickness might come our away no matter what problem I'm going through I take the words I will stand with the words because this Bride As does say the Lord which you keep still amen amen so R and responsibility changes Your Role is to take the word believe his word act upon his words amen and his role and responsibility as the bridegroom is to nurture you and keep Pro providing you with spiritual food amen and then providing the things that you have need of that's why he said seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness then all his things the things that you have need of the caral things we all need carnal things we all need m material thing we all need food we all need clothing those things will be taken care of that's his responsibility amen because he is Jehovah Gyra our provider that's part of his Redemptive blessings amen you need healing is Jehovah Rafa your healer that's part of God's Redemptive blessings amen he wants to fulfill every part of his Redemptive blessings but he needed the family to display His blessings too amen amen he was waiting for the family amen in the back part of his mind he had the family album but he waited for the time and season when they will be manifested now if you are still lying dead to sins and trespassers then you can't receive this blessing amen you got to come out that is why in the there in the S so n time amen when the light has come your way he come to bring you out of denominational Graves he come to make you rise up amen amen recognize who you are then you can use those with them to blessings and then you can come into full manifestation in this hour amen now he couldn't put the robe in any other age it had to come in the time of adoption amen it had to come in this age because only in this age can in this age of adoption can you have The Robe of adoption amen because in adoption in adoption ceremony what happened you had to be given the robe amen but you wasn't just given the robe you have to go to the tuts right amen the Holy Ghost had to give a reports yes this son and daughter of God is now ready to be adopted amen amen yes so therefore you are given the r that this bride is now ready amen she's ready ready to take on the responsibility of wife amen amen amen so he says in that same paragraph 96 and he said and then when the church has the ceremony makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom's name okay let's read from paragraph 95 because we read in 94 he says about decisions made the next engagement then the promise he says and 95 he says and then the ceremony and that's when the bride takes the bridegroom's name she's no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name and then when the church as the ceremony makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom name then she's no longer a church of the world she's a church of the Lord Jesus christall amen he said I now I don't mean that by name I mean that by birth by Nature amen by the power of God by the revealed truth of God in the heart she becomes a Christian Church the great Universal Apostolic Christian Church she becomes a part of Christ when she does that Christ injects into her his own Spirit his own life amen amen amen that's what the purpose of Calvary was for that his own life amen that the life in the old Testament under the sacrifice the life under Bull and goats couldn't come on to the believer amen but yeah the Life of Christ must come onto the believer which is a token which is the token is the literal Life of Christ being on display amen she becomes part of a Christ so and the Bible said to Adam and Eve you are no longer Twain but one and when the woman church is married to Christ they are no longer two they are one Christ in you amen his life has been brought into you then you become the bride amen then another thing after she's taken all these vows and so forth and the ceremony has been said like my like my wife's name was bro before she was married now she's no longer a bro she's a brandom now she isn't no more BR the gram and when you come into Christ you know more of the world you of Christ amen you care not then for the things of the world they are dead to you for he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in him so you see you can be an artificial Christian you can be an artificial professed Christian but you can't be a Christian become until Christ injects himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost unto you am then you are connected with him so you see out of this new birth then you if you don't have the new birth then you like every other person only when you have a new bird you are a different species amen you are part of the god species amen because you are now a new creation amen walking on the earth and New Creation walking on the earth you connected with him you are no longer Tain you are one Christ promised to be in us as the father was in Christ I and my father are one you and I are one the Christ in us all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church to continue the work of the Gospel then we become not by artificial name not by a reality of the Holy Spirit of Life connecting us into Christ then through the power of his resurrection we are raised from the dead things of the world and sitting with him in Heavenly places amen amen tonight we sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus resurrected with him died to the things of the world and took on Christ and when we take on Christ then the world is dead then no we know more care for the world the world is dead to us and is dead to us as we did to it amen amen we have to be dead to the things of the world Amen you see what a glorious thing this is amen so we find that the literal Life of Christ must be displayed in US it must be the token amen then the Bible says in Acts 188 but yes shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and Y shall be Witnesses upon me unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria to the uttermost part of the world Amen so we have that promise when the Holy Ghost comes upon us we shall receive power and when we receive power there must be a continuation of Christ's Ministry on Earth amen amen and Christ Ministry started to continue in the book of Acts and then we find that it stopped went through the Dark Ages and a little and a little bit of light was shown in every other age but in this age amen there must be the fullness of Christ again in the bride amen all that Christ was must be poured again into the church because in this age title leaders come back down Amen in this days our names are revealed amen that we are part of him amen our names are shown we we can see our names in a book how do we see our name when we see oursel as part of the word and when we see oursel walking out of the scripture pulled out of the scripture amen we see that part of the word that belongs to us amen amen and it and in this age we also have a responsibility to play thou must prophesy again because why the book is given to us and if the book is given to us that means we must call out the names in the book amen how do you call out the Nam of the book by going and preaching the same message amen that's speaking this message and the Revelation and that's how you're calling out the names amen you're calling them out the ifying thems by seeing the name in the book by speaking this very word that you have received the same word that you are eating you are speaking it out you're prophesying it again before Nations and tongues amen amen and therefore the Bible said you can't cast your Pearl to swine because now you have discernment when you are speaking to somebody you're speaking them giving them the words you are seeing if there's a pull amen amen if there's a pool you feed them more you give them more nuggets if there's no pool and people are condemn you walk away yeah amen amen that's how you know D must prophesy because you can see the names in the book amen how do you see the name word identify word amen word must identify word so you go to your own amen how you identify your own when you are preaching the word when you are preaching the gospel when there's a pull you start to give more you start to disciple amen your job is to go and preach the gospel amen if people reject you you preach the gospel you walk away but if there's a pool you have the right to disciple his people amen amen thank you him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God Revelation 3:12 him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I right upon him my new name so just as he was supposed to be subject to Adam the bride must be subject to Christ's word amen but this eve will not fall as he fell in even this bride will not fall as the bride fell in Eden amen because he already prophesied I will present myself a glorious church and whenever God puts the word I there an i that's of the I will Covenant and that word must be fulfilled he said I will amen provide myself a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle without blemish amen so we know even this bride has such a glorious position because what's left now this is a union people are thinking that the union the marriage is going to take place when we go in rtion no if you don't have if you don't come into the union now if you are not in the marriage now there is no Rapture for you that's righten let's get that established quite clear if there's no union now if there's no marriage now there is no Rapture for you because the Rapture is for those that come into a union amen amen the Rapture is for those that come in the marriage now amen amen the Rapture is a way supper we are going to a wedding supper to enjoy to celebrate to Rejoice amen hallelujah yes but now is where the union takes place Amen to be shut in your Li in the secret place yes Lord amen to to to hear all the secret things that he's telling us telling us all these mystery truths these divinely mystery truths amen and it couldn't be done until the headstone comes down that's why Paul say said we prophesy in part we we we do all the things in Parts but when that which is perfect is come amen what do what which is perfect amen all the divinely mystery revealed truths when these mystery truths are being revealed that's been revealed now that's which is perfect is come amen The Headstone come down the mind of Christ comes down and therefore the bride has a not a mind of her own that's is why now because we know the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body right but if the soul has the gene of God and the Soul has the Holy Ghost amen It cast off reasoning and doubt and takes in faith to believe God's word then and now when you have the mind of Christ then you your body is moving conjunction with that amen then your body is moving now in in tune with the mind of Christ and to God's purpose on earth into the father's business don't you know you must be about your father's business Christ the word yes down on the earth when he was here on the Earth being the word what he was worried about he said when when Mary and Joseph started to look for him and he was in the temple and they came Mary said don't you know your father's been looking for you he said don't you know I'm to be about my father's business the word for correcting the error amen so our business is our father's business our business is not year to come and and establish how much wealth we can accumulate in this world and how long how long life we can have on this Earth what a good life we can have this Earth how we can build an Empire on this Earth no our business is about establishing what am I doing what is my purpose for the kingdom what have God placed me where has God placed me to be effective in his kingdom what can I do for the kingdom of God why did God keep me in this hour what is my position that I'm supposed to be placed in the body of Christ that I can be effective in the Kingdom amen then nothing will be W from you amen you got to do that part then nothing then he will fulfill his part as the bride room which is to nourish you who is to provide for you amen provide the things that you have needed that's why he said don't take thought what food you're going to eat what clothes you're going to wear for your father knows the thing that you have need of Amen yes but we find that the next step now when we the bride coming to marriage Union there must be a weding supper amen but the makeup of the Bride come from seven Church ages and the Bible said they without us cannot be made perfect they are waiting for us Amen to walk in to come into perfection in his hour amen and how you come into Perfection by coming to a union with him by coming in wonders with him because now you are perfected in him you are perfected through Christ amen amen and just like Esther before she could present be presented to the king she had to go to a time of preparation so we know that when we come in his word it was a process amen we had to go to a pro process before she could present herself to the king she had to go to a process of preparation she couldn't go and conduct herself like how she used to conduct herself a manism had change amen maybe the culture that she had he had to change because now she's in royalty now amen a look at the change the way she wear garments had to change the way she walk it had to change amen when you come to Christ your work is got to change therefore you find Jacob had to have a name change but before that he his walk had to change yeah he had to have a change in his step yes when he met the angel of God he had to have a change in his step your your your walk can't be the same once you meet the angel of God you can't be walking the same walk amen amen you can't present your king to yourself to the king knowing that you are the Queen of Heaven you are royal you can't be conducting yourself the same like how you used to do in times past amen we not any longer under the master of sin amen we are now under Christ amen we are connected with Christ and now you are a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people amen and you are walking with the whole host of Heaven backing you up and he's given you all of the land to enjoy he's given you power over every demon power amen he's given you the authority to go and cast out demon he's giv you authority to pray for the sick amen all the things is given to the church but you got to fight every inch how does it fight now they are to fight natural Israel for a physical battle how do you fight we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against powers and darkness and rulers of darkness in our places how do you fight you battle in prayer you battle in fasting amen you come for a total surrender in the flesh amen it's a spiritual warfare the weapons of our Warfare are not caral amen so we're now in the final hour before the wedding supper but we know the voice of the Resurrection must take place next there must be a resurrection because We Go Together amen but the prophet being a prophet he saw a preview of the bride and he saw the filthy filthiness of the church world but he saw this bride again much he saw the initial bride and then he saw it again coming again after the Fess then he saw the bride again but then he saw her coming out of line and he screamed being a prophet he screamed out St stay in line stay in line stay in line why are you saying that stay in line stay in line with the words amen don't don't come out of the covering of the word amen stay in line of the word so what the fivefold ministry is doing making you stay in line with the word bringing you the same word the word hasn't change amen amen the word is just becoming clearer to you it hasn't change but it's become more clearer you begin to understand the word in the time that you are living in amen and you be coming to see your responsibility more clearer as you come as your your walk changes then you begin to take on your responsibility more amen so the responsibility of the the bride is To Be watchful prepared and in full Union with Christ before the Rapture amen and to produce Jesus Christ again because we know this bride the prophet said will have thus save the Lord oh she will keep still that means she's got the complete word amen Revelation 1979 says let us be glad amen and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready amen now we know that this only could take place under the shout amen it only could take place under the shout Ministry where where this bride is called now into this Rapture amen into this Union the shout is called her called her away from all the denomination all the Creeds and all these things and it's shut her up shut her in amen shut in with Christ nobody else can come in there she shut in with Christ if anybody else come in you must come by the right way you must come through the door amen amen they can't come through the window or any other way they must come through the door yes amen just the way that you come in amen yes wonderful they don't want to come through the door they don't want to believe his Prophet they want to take all their part of the Bible say but it's all good it's all nice the minute you bring them to the messenger of the hour they don't want to receive it how can you receive the message without the messenger exactly the messenger is the one that carrying the message amen a lot of even the you you'll never hear this even in the church World they all speak about a church because they know who they are but they'll never speak about being a bride yes yes they will never mention the word bride bridegroom yeah because it's a mystery amen amen and the Mystery of this marriage is the bride being united through with Christ through Revelation amen that is why this name they don't want they they just want to say Jesus Jesus but they don't want to take on to take on this name is a responsibility to take on this name of marriage it come you have the authority but to have this Authority it comes with responsibility amen it comes to full submission if you want to see God work in your life if you want to see the fullness of his word being manifested in your life you've got to come under full submission you got to come it's a love affair Amen brother and sister there's no shortcut amen this marriage is a love affair you got to love Christ that's the bottom line you you you got to love him it's a marriage of love amen lot of people come under Church to satisfy conscience people go to religious organization to satisfy the conscience but this is a union this is a union by love amen and this is the greatest love story ever told oh yes amen of Christ and his bride amen the things that he did for his bride how he laid down his life for his bride and what it took this gospel to come through it's a gospel that's dripping with blood amen and it took even in in the last day to this last Church AE messenger it wasn't easy to take a message AC cross this Messenger to be persecuted this me Messenger to face the wrath of God when when he would listen when he was forced to listen to denomination he didn't come easy he didn't come on a Bed of Roses amen and just like that every son and daughter must be tried and tested you yourself know that when you receive this word that when you decided to take sight with Christ when you decided to take on his name how you are to be persecuted from your families from your friends when you have to take a stand for the word how they mocked at you how they scorned at you how they scorned at the sisters for the way they dress up how they sced you for not allowing for for for for believing his message they call you different names and so forth you know what you had to go through but what made you believe it nevertheless amen what made you love it so much because you were part of him am eternal life was laying in you the gene of God amen amen there's only two things in the world life and death and life can only come from him amen amen amen we know we want the V and you always for the word you want more vitamin from him amen amen you want to eat more of him you want to eat more of the word amen because what he doing it's aligning you with your theophany amen amen you're coming to alignment in this hour the word is the the preaching of the word is bringing you into alignment to align with your theophany amen if you never had a theop there he don't bother you but you want more of it because every time you are listening to it when you're having revelation of the word when you're getting stimulated because the preaching of the word is aligning you is bringing you to alignment amen that is why when you look at things you realize you you you know there you are sensitive knowing that there's Angels around you the angels of God are here you know in the move you know the presence of God is amongst you amen amen you conscious of it because you are seated in Heavenly places but if you are seated with a caral mind and a caral thought all you are seeing things in the flesh yes you are seeing things when your fleshly in the fleshly side of thing that is why when you go to the doctor and the doctor give you a report you have our trouble you're going to see it in your carnal mind you're going to get all your emotions going to get worked up and you're going to get depressed but you see that a son and daughter of God Amen yes you said daughter you say doctor that is your prognosis but I believe that your education and what you studied that's true what you can see from what you studyed but I come from a different place doctor amen my father is the creator of the art that you are complaining about amen my father created that heart yes and he can give me a new heart right now I can choose doctor to accept your word or I can choose to accept his word that by his stripes I am healed amen yes and I accept his word because he said let every man be a liar but my word be the TRU and he is the same yesterday today and forever if he one if he healed one person without trouble he can do it again amen amen wonderful thank you he's not obligated to me but he's obligated to his word amen amen thank you so we see that this word has transforming power amen he has he can take the violent sinner amen the person in the worst condition you can bring the person with the worst condition they can be the most hated sinner but this word has power to transform them amen amen he can make an a a saint amen oh yes he can make nobody nobody a somebody that's what this word has come to do amen a transforming power but you got to be clothed with his righteousness you got to be robbed with the Holy Ghost amen you got to be robbed with his righteousness his life must come upon you amen that's the wedding garment that you have in this hour to make yourself ready so your is to take him by his word amen we look back and you see the Old Testament times Rebecca came to a bridegroom when it was it was in the evening time yes amen Ela was telling him telling her all about Isaac and as Eliza was telling her about Isaac something with connected something with made her fall in love with Isaac before she even see him amen just by the way El was so sincere you are so sincere Amen to to Abraham that he will follow everything that Abraham told him amen Bram was so sincere to what God has commissioned him to do amen and he when he was telling you about Christ and he was telling you about this message this word he was so sincere and you and when you when you began to hear he said I never heard a man like this man I never heard a man so sincere about the gospel amen amen and she heard this word she saw many men many LLY men in the time maybe but this man was so sincere in the way he spoke and she began to tell him about Isaac and his sincerity of telling him about that she believed it amen she believed every word of ela amen and there was a connection amen she already fell in love with Isaac even before she sees him amen we know when Ruth when she was married to Boaz when it was it was in the harest time amen and when it was in the time when Naomi went back in omand amen so we know this invisible Union takes place when Israel went back into the Homeland in the end of the Harvest amen it was Harvest Time amen that this Union took place we know we also see the book of Esa after vashi rejected the seven voices of the king amen what happened esta came in and was chosen after the nomination world has has rejected hey man this church age messenger and this bride has coming amen this Esther has coming but what happened after Esther comes in when there was a problem one day and she was kept for such a time as this that it's now going to be the debt of a people and even herself that she didn't know at that time that she was preserved for such a time as that then she began to put a royal robe on she began to recognize her true identity she began to recognize what she truly had all the time and then she went to the king that even if he'd been dead but she was she had so much of confidence that she knew this King loved her and she knew she loved the king but even then even even if it me dying to self es to go forth amen and the King could throw a deceptor amen and give us to even to have the kingdom but then the Royal Decree already went forth and the King couldn't change that so what EST to do EST to rewrite the laws amen amen so this bride must speak again amen this bride must prophesy again before Nation tongues and kings and then this bride said if you say to this mountain be thou removed it shall be removed amen when this Bride come in the fullness of the word amen Greater Works than this yes shall do now the power of the spoken word lays in there and he says now if you say to this mountain hallu be thou remove it shall be removed amen so we can take this out and speak about the servant that went forth doing the budding we can see and and look at it our time from 1946 he went out called the alt the lame the name the blind under the first two pools great healing revivals taking place amen sweeping the land all this was happening but it was happening before the marriage but in 1963 he said I'm waiting for a message this message was going to catch the rainbow trout amen this m message was going to attract the bride this message was going to bring her into the Union thank you Lord cuz the headstone come down to meet with the body am amen and what was it the Capstone of love amen charity amen yes to bring her into Perfection to bring her into Oneness to bring her into this great Union amen that she will produce Jesus Christ again and there are to take place before the married supper so the mind of Christ comes down upon this people amen revealing his plan for us re revealing his plan of all the ages amen revealing what he's going to do amongst us revealing what he's going to do in the future revealing all the secrets what's going to happen to the Jews and so forth all these things have been revealed plainly before us just like how when he went to Abraham you said can I hide from Ab what I'm about to do for them amen after after revealing the The Secret of Sarah's heart he goes and reveal to abraam what he's going to do then he reveal to us what's going to happen to this world what's going to happen to the World Systems amen so we find right now in the uniting time and sign the bride is uniting with the word nations are uniting the businesses are uniting armies are uniting yes we see it all over the world every day but there another uniting taking place Amen in the spiritual realm the bride is uniting with the word amen to become what M Jesus Christ am to produce Christ again upon the Earth Christ being displayed again Christ being displayed upon the Earth amen Christ drawn out of History the resurrected Christ amongst his people people doing the same works that he did amen but he said Greater Works that did he shall do amen he had to go to enure us with power Amen to what to Rob us with his holy spirit amen to have the baptism of the holy spirit so we find that the roles and responsibility lays with us now amen to fulfill our part we've got all the word the word is open to us we've got to take the word now and act upon it amen amen and fulfill our parts amen it's not a time to shook in this hour not a time to shook in our hour of
