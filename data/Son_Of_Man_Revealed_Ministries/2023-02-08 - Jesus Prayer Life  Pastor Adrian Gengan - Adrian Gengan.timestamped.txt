[3:22] in our father's house there is Liberty
[3:25] there is freedom
[3:29] Freedom Festival they had worked no
[3:30] doubt maybe you had a hard trying day
[3:32] trolls of life and circumstances but in
[3:36] his presence there is fullness of joy
[3:38] amen so we can just release that into
[3:41] his presence amen hallelujah amen so
[3:44] brother Jeff was not here this evening
[3:46] he's going to
[3:47] king or somewhere even on a work trip
[3:49] pray that the Lord be with him and bless
[3:51] him amen hallelujah we're going to speak
[3:54] tonight and we're going to learn a few
[3:56] lessons we may start a series and I
[3:58] think it's vitally important to speak on
[4:00] Jesus prayer life
[4:02] amen
[4:04] Jesus prayer life
[4:07] Hallelujah
[4:09] and this has to do with the topic of
[4:11] spiritual discipline
[4:13] amen we see that we are heading into a
[4:16] season into a time where we want to
[4:18] encounter the supernatural
[4:21] and see the moving of the Holy Spirit
[4:24] but their secrets to these things
[4:28] amen and we're going to learn from the
[4:31] word of God we'll touch on a few things
[4:32] this evening we may keep the sermon
[4:34] short because we want to get into a time
[4:36] of prayer amen but we will hit the
[4:39] highlights
[4:40] amen so that we get the main points and
[4:42] we look as we look at the prayer life of
[4:44] Jesus Amen everybody feeling good amen
[4:48] hallelujah amen
[4:51] maybe for scripture we can uh
[4:55] let's go to the Book of Mark
[5:02] [Music]
[5:11] Hallelujah
[5:20] this would be the names of the Lord you
[5:22] know I'm just trying to find a place
[5:23] here
[5:25] amen
[5:29] so in The Book of Mark if you can read
[5:31] amen let's just read the first scripture
[5:33] and then we'll get seated amen
[5:41] let's read Mark chapter 1 and verse 35.
[5:45] says and in the morning rising up great
[5:48] while before the day he went out and
[5:50] departed into a solitary place and they
[5:52] prayed amen may be seated
[5:55] [Music]
[5:57] amen
[6:00] so even as we approach this topic
[6:02] I want you to make notes
[6:05] and I want you to start to apply these
[6:07] things to our life
[6:09] amen
[6:10] because there is a world that exists
[6:14] that's unseen to the human eye
[6:17] and science is probing and searching for
[6:21] extra terrestrial life
[6:24] but even if we convince them that this
[6:27] world exists
[6:29] they do not have means to communicate
[6:31] with this world
[6:33] with all these scientific gadgets
[6:36] and the advancements in science they do
[6:39] not have the technology to communicate
[6:42] with this world
[6:45] amen
[6:47] but as a Believer we have the
[6:50] communication Channel
[6:53] we have the communication mechanism
[6:56] that we can use to communicate with the
[6:58] Unseen World
[7:00] amen and that is called prayer amen amen
[7:05] amen our bodies we live in a flesh body
[7:08] governed by our five senses
[7:11] but our body is trapped in a
[7:12] three-dimensional world
[7:14] of time space and matter
[7:17] amen
[7:19] but our prayer can pass through
[7:22] Dimensions
[7:24] amen our body can't leave this Dimension
[7:27] lest we die
[7:30] but we have an effective tool so
[7:32] powerful
[7:33] that he can pass through dimensions
[7:36] and go right into the seventh dimension
[7:39] amen where God himself is sitting
[7:42] hallelujah amen right before the throne
[7:45] room of almighty God our praise gonna
[7:48] sin and touch the heart of God
[7:51] amen amen yes
[7:54] and we can get the attention of God
[7:56] through our prayer
[7:59] amen
[8:02] tonight you'll hear things that maybe
[8:04] we haven't had a long time
[8:06] maybe we'll speak in a way that we
[8:08] haven't not spoken before
[8:10] amen but we want to learn from our Lord
[8:13] Jesus Christ amen so if you are a son
[8:16] and daughter of God
[8:18] I want you to know because sometimes we
[8:20] think God does not hear our prayer
[8:23] if you are a son and daughter of God I
[8:26] want you to know that God hears our
[8:29] prayer amen amen he loves it when you
[8:32] pray and by faith believe and by your
[8:36] faith you believe that he will answer
[8:37] you amen
[8:40] so if I had to ask you a question before
[8:42] we get started where does prayer rank in
[8:46] your priorities in life
[8:49] is it first place
[8:51] second place
[8:53] third place
[8:55] or right now is there no place at all in
[8:58] your life for prayer
[9:00] amen that you can answer for yourself
[9:03] amen
[9:05] isn't it sure to pray
[9:07] is it difficult to pray
[9:13] do we become lazy
[9:16] to pray
[9:17] or is prayer our number one priority
[9:21] now this is the spiritual discipline
[9:23] that we need to instill in our lives
[9:25] amen
[9:27] amen
[9:29] now we can model ourselves after many
[9:32] people many spiritual men
[9:34] in fact we can model ourselves after all
[9:36] the apostles we can even try to model
[9:39] ourselves after the prophet
[9:43] but there is no one greater than the
[9:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[9:49] amen so if we are going to model
[9:51] ourselves
[9:53] with somebody let us rather choose to
[9:56] model ourselves after the Lord Jesus
[9:58] Christ because he is the original image
[10:01] of the perfect man and we must strive to
[10:04] be like him
[10:06] do you know what happens if you try to
[10:07] copy something from a copy
[10:11] everybody wants to be a copy of the
[10:13] original
[10:14] if you got a painting that if you can't
[10:16] have the original painting they want a
[10:18] copy of the original but as you start to
[10:21] make a copy of a copy of a copy of a
[10:23] copy
[10:25] the picture starts to lose it value the
[10:29] picture starts to lose its quality
[10:32] so we don't want to be copies of
[10:34] somebody else's Ministry
[10:36] we want to be like
[10:39] a copy of the original our Lord Jesus
[10:41] Christ that's my point in driving that
[10:43] right so he was the ultimate example set
[10:46] for us he operated in an anointing and
[10:49] an atmosphere and lived in a world of
[10:51] perfect faith that we know nothing about
[10:54] we may have experienced glimpses of this
[10:57] world but to truly live in that world of
[11:00] perfect faith
[11:03] Jesus had spiritual discipline
[11:06] even though he was the son of God
[11:11] amen and the spirit of God descended on
[11:14] him at the Jordan River
[11:16] our lord Jesus taught us to be obedient
[11:18] to the will of the father
[11:21] and he prayed to the father
[11:24] you see if we if we move past these
[11:27] things and we don't notice Jesus life
[11:29] and Ministry
[11:30] we are going to miss key elements in how
[11:32] we operate
[11:35] if we think Jesus was the god man he was
[11:37] deity and he just did and spoke things
[11:39] but if you follow carefully we'll see
[11:42] his life amen
[11:45] praise strengthens why why am I
[11:47] emphasizing on prayer I'll give you some
[11:49] cheese prayer strengthens the spirit of
[11:51] the spirit man amen today I had a
[11:54] manager come to me in the morning and he
[11:56] tells me hey Pastor why don't you come
[11:58] and meet with us in the boardroom and
[12:00] we'll have some privity and teach us how
[12:01] to do this and that
[12:04] yeah sorry all the conversation started
[12:06] there was a song playing on the you know
[12:08] in the dealership to pay songs and he
[12:10] said hey I love the song You know the
[12:12] song I said no I don't know the song he
[12:14] says hey how you don't know the song
[12:15] such a popular song
[12:17] I said I don't listen to ungodly music
[12:20] he says Ah you can't be so spiritual man
[12:24] then I said no
[12:26] do you only want to satisfy the flesh
[12:28] man
[12:28] I said do you know you have a spirit
[12:31] do you know you possess a soul he said
[12:33] no no I want to sit here now I want you
[12:35] to tell me what you're talking about
[12:37] you see because the denominational world
[12:39] only caters to the flesh they preach to
[12:42] the flesh
[12:43] they say things to satisfy the flesh
[12:49] so he says I want to learn more I spoke
[12:51] to him a bit and then he tells me oh how
[12:53] can I develop this thing because I find
[12:55] myself not doing these things no matter
[12:57] how much we pray for you
[12:59] if I pray for you you cannot get
[13:02] spiritual discipline you are good to do
[13:05] it spiritual I can't lay hands on you
[13:07] and you get spiritual discipline
[13:09] he says oh my pastor sent me a long
[13:11] message another Pastor sends me a short
[13:13] message I need is one and I delete my
[13:15] pastor's wife
[13:17] I said you see
[13:18] you do not want it he's saying how do I
[13:20] make time for God how do I get along
[13:21] with God
[13:23] he's questioning these things
[13:25] I said it starts with you the holy
[13:28] spirit will call you to prayer amen
[13:30] right keep the warning of the spirit and
[13:33] when you feel the call don't go to tick
[13:35] tock don't go to Instagram don't go to
[13:38] Facebook don't go to Whatsapp get on
[13:40] your knees and stop praying amen we need
[13:43] to understand and be sensitive to one
[13:45] another in the family as well and
[13:46] realize our roles and our purposes amen
[13:49] don't always try to look to the Flesh
[13:50] and look to them sometimes the person
[13:52] needs to be in prayer
[13:54] yes amen because there's so much going
[13:57] on and so much of attack on the enemy
[13:59] amen
[14:01] and that's why it takes a good wife he
[14:03] takes a good husband he takes good
[14:05] children to be sensitive to the
[14:07] atmosphere that you know this is not the
[14:09] times of this this is not it's not time
[14:10] for that
[14:11] you know amen so prayer strengthens the
[14:14] spirit man and it kills the flesh man
[14:18] if you want to be spiritually strong we
[14:21] must have spiritual discipline of
[14:23] getting alone with God and pray to him
[14:27] tonight I will speak in a way that might
[14:30] develop a hunger in some of us amen and
[14:32] that's what I'm trying to do
[14:34] as I'm speaking I want to actually stop
[14:37] and just pray because I want to develop
[14:39] such an anger and a passion for God yes
[14:42] amen
[14:44] like when we develop a strong prayer
[14:47] life we start to grow in the spirit
[14:49] Spirit may have start to grow the Holy
[14:52] Spirit can move in us and operate in the
[14:54] authority and power that he did in Jesus
[14:57] and the apostles amen the reason we did
[15:00] not see the power flowing in the
[15:01] authority and the anointing flowing in
[15:04] the power and anointing
[15:06] is because we are not realized we have
[15:08] no consecrated time
[15:10] [Music]
[15:11] so let's get started someone may ask
[15:13] young people may ask how many times a
[15:15] day should I pray
[15:18] how many times should we pray let's get
[15:21] some answers how many times do you think
[15:23] we should pray brother Caleb
[15:28] sorry
[15:30] foreign
[15:31] we can pray whenever you want
[15:33] okay we will follow your prayer life
[15:37] you pray whenever you want so I may
[15:39] never want to pray
[15:41] that's whenever I want right
[15:43] I may want to pray once a week
[15:47] get my point
[15:49] we will leave it to us with a lack of
[15:51] spiritual discipline and we say I'll
[15:53] pray whenever I want
[15:56] then it's putting it out to own a
[15:58] spiritual discipline and we could pray
[16:00] once a week once a month
[16:02] how many times a day do you think we
[16:03] should pray
[16:05] brother Jaden
[16:07] ideally how many times should we pray
[16:10] sorry
[16:12] two times a day amen anybody else want
[16:15] to give me an answer
[16:18] pray without seizing amen but brother I
[16:21] wish you got what you got the phone so
[16:22] answer you got lots of things to do
[16:25] it's not always possible right because
[16:27] we in the flesh body as well we have
[16:29] jobs
[16:31] so let's look to the scripture because
[16:32] I'm not giving him my own opinion my own
[16:35] thoughts
[16:36] we have scriptural chat we go to the
[16:38] scriptures let's go to our first
[16:40] scripture and it's found in Psalm 55 and
[16:43] verse 17. now King David
[16:46] here is talking
[16:48] and here we're going to learn that the
[16:50] Jews why they pray three times a day
[16:54] so King David was a devout Jew
[16:56] and he declared that he prayed three
[16:58] times a day it was now after that it
[17:01] became customary for the Jews to pray
[17:03] three times a day and hear what he says
[17:05] evening and morning and at noon
[17:09] evening
[17:11] morning and noon and I love them because
[17:14] he's writing line with Genesis because
[17:17] the evening and the morning was the
[17:19] first day
[17:22] so he starts his day in the evening
[17:25] everyone's following my phone the Bible
[17:27] says the evening and the morning was the
[17:29] first day
[17:31] so you guys think David saying evening
[17:34] and morning
[17:36] and at noon will I pray and cry aloud
[17:39] and he shall hear my voice
[17:43] let's move along now
[17:45] you move along and we come now to a time
[17:47] of Daniel Daniel chapter 6 and verse 10
[17:50] and he says now this is the time when
[17:53] they pass a decree to catch Daniel it
[17:56] says now when Daniel knew the writing
[17:58] was signed he went into his house and
[18:01] his windows being opened in his chamber
[18:03] towards the Jerusalem he kneeled upon
[18:06] his knees three times a day
[18:10] and prayed and gave thanks before his
[18:13] God as he did a fourth time so he did it
[18:17] before
[18:18] it was his custom to pray three times a
[18:22] day
[18:22] now those of us who are more spiritual
[18:25] and can pray five times a day can pray
[18:27] 10 times a day or pray without teasing
[18:30] you should do that
[18:32] but as a minimum
[18:35] we should pray three times a day
[18:38] now I know a lot of message people right
[18:40] now even if they're listening here oh we
[18:43] don't mean of religious in their message
[18:46] don't try to bring religion at least get
[18:48] religious and pray three times a day you
[18:50] demon amen
[18:54] because it's always the religious people
[18:56] that were
[18:58] come against things of God when you're
[19:00] trying to instill spiritual discipline
[19:02] amen
[19:04] so I asked you young men young women men
[19:06] and brothers sisters
[19:09] I don't want you to raise your hand can
[19:11] we commit to praying three times a day
[19:15] evening morning at noon
[19:18] set a reminder because we've got to
[19:21] train
[19:25] I don't need many amens
[19:27] amen amen
[19:30] I don't want you to get uncomfortable
[19:31] when we talk about prayer
[19:33] if you want to see the power of God flow
[19:35] in your life if you want to see the
[19:37] anointing if you want to see yourself
[19:38] get closer with God this is how you
[19:40] start right amen okay
[19:43] before we get to Jesus I want to get to
[19:45] two scriptures to show you the lifestyle
[19:47] of the disciples
[19:48] in Acts chapter 3 and verse 1 it says
[19:51] Peter and John went up together into the
[19:53] temple
[19:57] Happy Hour of Prayer
[20:01] so there was a call to prayer amen
[20:04] amen being the ninth hour
[20:08] so they were following the evening
[20:09] morning and noon
[20:11] they were going to pray
[20:14] now notice what happens we're not really
[20:16] going to go into it but what happens is
[20:19] they come to the game called Beautiful
[20:25] bring it up
[20:27] they come through the gate called
[20:29] Beautiful they see a man in need yes
[20:32] they're Christians
[20:35] they see a beggar and they want to give
[20:38] him something but they said silver and
[20:40] gold have we met amen amen Peter
[20:44] you got any change on you no I don't
[20:46] have any change Peter you gotta I don't
[20:48] have change oh I really wanted to help
[20:50] you but soon and goal that we none am en
[20:53] but such as we have
[20:54] [Music]
[20:56] the name of Jesus raise up and walk
[20:59] amen amen what does it teach us now even
[21:02] if you don't have money and don't just
[21:04] tell the beggar I don't have
[21:05] tell them Silver and Gold Have I None
[21:08] yes
[21:09] yes how about we model that how many
[21:11] times we just do this
[21:14] we don't even say silver and gold there
[21:17] are none but such as I have
[21:19] even if it's a word
[21:21] impart something to somebody
[21:25] we're going to our second scripture Acts
[21:28] chapter 10 and verse 9 it says on the
[21:30] moral as they went on the journey and
[21:32] Drew Naya to the city Peter went upon
[21:35] that I'll stop to pray about the sixth
[21:37] hour
[21:39] hmm
[21:41] he's making time to pray I'm going to
[21:43] summarize this very quickly because it's
[21:44] a long story Peter has a vision while
[21:47] he's praying and in that vision
[21:49] it leads him to meeting Cornelius
[21:53] and the Holy Spirit falls upon them
[21:56] the Holy Spirit falls upon the Gentiles
[21:58] and it opens up the great mystery to the
[22:01] early church that the gospel was not to
[22:03] the Jews only but it was also for the
[22:06] Gentiles we'll read Acts chapter 10
[22:08] you'll get the full story so it all
[22:10] started with Peter's spiritual
[22:12] discipline and the desire to pray to God
[22:15] so as this is where we want to start now
[22:18] your prayer life is the foundation of
[22:20] your ministry your praying life is the
[22:23] foundation of your anointing your prayer
[22:25] life amen you can only operate in the
[22:28] spirit well and as good as your prayer
[22:29] life is amen
[22:32] with the level of anointing that you can
[22:34] operate him
[22:36] it depends on your prayer life so when
[22:38] we pray remember this now when we pray
[22:41] we are not forcing God to change his
[22:43] mind
[22:45] we're not asking God to do something
[22:48] outside of his will amen when we pray we
[22:51] are praying to align ourselves with the
[22:53] will of God Amen
[22:55] and when we begin to align ourselves
[22:57] with the will of God Amen we become a
[23:00] channel that God's power can flow
[23:02] through
[23:05] so we said you start by praying three
[23:07] times a day
[23:09] you say how do I pray I've never prayed
[23:11] in my life we're going to show you a
[23:12] sample prayer of how that when they came
[23:15] to Jesus and said Lord teach us how to
[23:17] pray let's start there Matthew chapter 6
[23:20] and verse 9. amen
[23:23] he says after this manner therefore pray
[23:27] he
[23:28] Our Father
[23:30] so when you're calling him our father
[23:33] you're recognizing yourself as the son
[23:35] as his son and daughter right that's
[23:37] relationship now
[23:39] who shot in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[23:42] holy is your name start by worshiping
[23:44] him
[23:45] don't just bombard heaven with I want I
[23:48] want I want
[23:50] Lord sought
[23:52] sort this out for me no hello would be
[23:56] thy name amen
[23:58] because thy kingdom come
[24:00] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[24:04] heaven
[24:06] so he's starting by worshiping him he's
[24:08] standing by inviting the will of God
[24:11] into your life
[24:13] when you're inviting the will of God you
[24:15] are saying change the circumstances
[24:16] around me to align with your will
[24:19] give us this day then he starts would
[24:21] give us this day I'll give you bread and
[24:24] forgive us our death as we forgive our
[24:26] debtors
[24:29] lead us not into temptation but Deliver
[24:32] Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom
[24:35] and the power and the glory forever amen
[24:41] so you start with worship you end
[24:43] worship
[24:45] okay you can go and study that even more
[24:49] now we get to Jesus our lord Jesus
[24:54] and we turn to Matthew chapter 14.
[24:58] we're going to learn here now
[25:01] Jesus just performs
[25:03] A great miracle
[25:06] there's five thousand people five
[25:08] thousand men on a hill beside the woman
[25:10] and the children
[25:11] that follow him to listen to his
[25:13] teaching
[25:14] and after such a great miraculous thing
[25:16] that happened way he takes the fish and
[25:19] the bread the Loaves and he multiplies
[25:21] it and he feeds five thousand men
[25:26] let's see what our lord Jesus Does
[25:29] pay attention now amen and when he sent
[25:33] the multitudes away
[25:35] he went up into the mountain apart to
[25:38] pray
[25:40] spiritual discipline amen
[25:42] he didn't say did you see what I did
[25:45] there guys
[25:47] I fed five thousand men alone
[25:53] the Son of God goes to a mountain apart
[25:56] to
[25:58] truth it was coming
[26:00] they say oh you're a religious man
[26:02] there's Jesus now I'm going to show you
[26:04] three times he prayed evening morning
[26:06] noon time
[26:09] Jesus goes to the mountain apart to pray
[26:12] when the evening was come he was there
[26:16] [Music]
[26:18] alone time with God is very important
[26:22] so think about it now because virtually
[26:25] Jesus
[26:28] every time he does a miracle every time
[26:30] he has a vision
[26:33] Everybody follow yeah
[26:35] when you drive your car for too long
[26:37] what runs out
[26:39] you need to refuel and prayer is the
[26:42] fuel
[26:44] you refuel your spirit man with prayer
[26:47] amen
[26:52] amen so he goes there alone
[26:55] and he comes back fully charged
[26:57] and when you got a full take of you what
[27:00] you're going to do
[27:02] go and read
[27:03] Jesus now looks for his disciples and
[27:06] where are they
[27:07] on the sea
[27:10] and because he's so fully charged of the
[27:12] anointing he walks on the water
[27:14] to get to them
[27:17] charged in the presence of God Amen
[27:21] amen he went from one Miracle to the
[27:25] next amen he was so full of the
[27:27] anointing and power Jesus lived in the
[27:30] world of perfect Faith there he was
[27:32] thinking it's normal for him to walk and
[27:34] walk and the disciples was who's this
[27:36] walking on the water
[27:38] Maybe
[27:41] Matthew chapter 6 and verse 6.
[27:45] now Jesus goes to the mountain apart to
[27:47] pray he goes in the evening and he goes
[27:51] alone let's listen to his instruction to
[27:54] us
[27:55] Matthew chapter 6 and verse 6 but thou
[27:58] when thou praised stop
[28:01] [Music]
[28:04] what did we learn there
[28:06] Jesus is not saying but thou if you pray
[28:14] Jesus is expecting
[28:17] his disciples and people who say yeah
[28:20] his followers to pray
[28:24] he's not saying if you pray
[28:28] the word is when you pray
[28:35] enter into thy
[28:37] closet
[28:42] the ones that are looking for an excuse
[28:44] right now saying I have no closet
[28:51] and when that was shut the door
[28:55] what is that teaching us No Interruption
[28:59] no distraction
[29:01] don't shut the door with your cell phone
[29:03] in there
[29:08] pray to thy father which is in credible
[29:11] and thy father would see it in secret
[29:14] shall reward me openly there's a reward
[29:18] in prayer amen you know
[29:23] how far is so good there's nothing we
[29:25] can do for him that he will not give us
[29:27] more he will not rewarded even in prayer
[29:31] he rewards Us by answering us
[29:34] so what did we learn there
[29:37] When you pray
[29:38] go into a private place private space
[29:41] shut the door
[29:44] pray to your father in secret he will
[29:47] reward you openly now that is
[29:49] confirmation of what Jesus is
[29:52] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[29:55] him
[29:59] and in Matthew verse chapter 6 you can
[30:01] learn this one key When you pray do not
[30:04] use repetition
[30:07] do not use vain repetition what does
[30:10] that word mean in effect your prayer
[30:12] becomes ineffective
[30:13] ineffective repetition
[30:16] so that was Jesus praying in the evening
[30:18] let's go to Mark chapter 1 verse 35
[30:22] it says and in the morning
[30:26] rising up a great while before the day
[30:32] he went out and departed into a solitary
[30:36] place
[30:38] and there pray
[30:45] if you read the verses before
[30:50] you'll find amen what what's happening
[30:53] there right but he rises early in the
[30:56] morning that's what we wanted so we saw
[30:58] the previous verse he goes in the
[31:00] evening he goes alone
[31:02] amen
[31:03] here he's going in the morning rising up
[31:06] before the day it starts and he goes out
[31:08] into a solitary place and he prays
[31:13] even when Jesus ministry is becoming so
[31:17] popular
[31:19] Jesus goodrew himself from the crowds
[31:21] let's go to Luke 15 and sorry Luke 5 and
[31:24] verse 15. it says and so much more
[31:27] Wednesday Fame abroad of him and great
[31:31] multitudes came together to hear and to
[31:34] be healed of him of the infirmities
[31:37] but Jesus didn't mingle with him he says
[31:40] he withdrew himself into the Wilderness
[31:43] and prayed
[31:45] amen so don't get excited about crowds
[31:48] don't get excited that so many people
[31:50] are following my Ministry amen
[31:54] people who are anointed know the key to
[31:56] their power
[31:58] prayer
[31:59] amen prayer
[32:03] so we're gonna go to our next point now
[32:06] Jesus spent time in prayer before he
[32:10] made important decisions
[32:12] I hope I'm stripping this down for you
[32:14] to show you
[32:16] that even though he was the Lord God
[32:18] Almighty in flesh
[32:22] he consulted the Lord in prayer
[32:26] he spent time in prayer before making
[32:28] important decisions sometimes we ACT
[32:31] first and then we want to pray
[32:33] when things don't work out or go away
[32:35] then we want to pray we want to make
[32:37] decisions without praying about it
[32:40] Amen in fact some of us believe we are
[32:43] so anointed
[32:45] um
[32:45] [Music]
[32:47] amen
[32:49] some of us believe we are the bride of
[32:51] Christ
[32:52] we are so anointed we can just go
[32:55] forward and do things
[32:57] surely everything I do is right and we
[33:00] don't pray about it
[33:03] but look at the most anointed man
[33:07] the God man amen he prayed before making
[33:10] important decisions we'll go to Lucas
[33:12] for that amen
[33:15] Jesus it says he came to pass in days
[33:18] that he went up into a mountain
[33:21] to pray
[33:22] and continue
[33:24] all night amen in prayer to God Amen
[33:31] amen why would Jesus have an all-night
[33:32] prayer meeting
[33:34] and he just didn't pray throughout the
[33:36] night
[33:37] listen what it says and when it was day
[33:41] he prayed all night going into the day
[33:44] what's he going to do tell me what's
[33:46] this important decision
[33:48] is going to select his 12 disciples
[33:54] so when he's making his most important
[33:56] decision about which 12 he will choose
[33:59] he just doesn't go choose that
[34:00] personally amen when you're choosing for
[34:03] a wife for a husband don't choose a
[34:05] personally amen amen Jesus choosing his
[34:08] disciples he goes all night into the
[34:10] mountain to pray yes
[34:13] for those of you are streaming
[34:14] unfortunately the stream is going to be
[34:16] cut now because of load shedding and the
[34:19] towers cell phone towers are going to go
[34:21] off so we built thee farewell
[34:24] and I encourage you to use this time to
[34:26] pray
[34:28] amen and again
