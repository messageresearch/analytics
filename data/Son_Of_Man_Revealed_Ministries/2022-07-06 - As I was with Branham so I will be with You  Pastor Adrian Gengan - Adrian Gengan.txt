========================================

amen he passed through the dry land and they buried the same enemies in that same sheep behind them amen they walked over into the dry land god was with moses up on the mountain when the glory cloud came down amen moses was living in the supernatural receiving direct communication from god so much that god even asked the angels to transport this man's body god provided transportation because he did not want moses body to decay because he had a further work for a future time amen amen that's how god was with moses and he said as i was with moses i will be with you joshua but only be those strong amen and be now courageous amen amen and joshua now god didn't just tell him that and leave him to his own devices god backed up his word and joshua proved to be a mighty general full of courage strong in faith he led the people in the land and was fighting and overcoming amen just that god promised him he would never leave him he was with him he was true to his word and joshua was not doing it alone this became evident when the captain of the host came into the camp amen he realized that the battle was not his he says the battle is mine said the lord amen just the same way our battles are not ours if we give it to the lord god will fight our battles for us amen but we gotta surrender over to him amen he promised he would never leave him nor forsake him even the sin of achar did not enter the move of god amen that was a quick word they dealt with the sin of aiken and they kept on moving off don't let sin stop the church this was an army that was marching according to the orders of the general who was receiving orders from the captain of the host amen joshua add other platoon leaders amen you know our war is amen you have leaders you have centurions you have all these people captains and platoon leaders amen and one of those platoon leaders was caleb amen caleb was one of the original believers that left egypt he was a man full of faith he was he had a different anointing on him the bible says he had a different spirit amen in fact his art was turned back to the original faith of the fathers hallelujah he experienced when moses went up into the mountain was caught up into the cloud and received instruction to go and take the ten commandments to the people amen in fact caleb was a law abiding citizen he obeyed all ten commandments amen nothing could shake his experience he had seen it all from egypt right until this time when they entered the promised land he was one of them that went to spy out the land and came back with the evidence that the land is overflowing with milk and honey now remember all 10 spa said the same thing the lamb is good it's overflowing with milk and honey then they said but yes amen but when the doubters want to doubt you use the word but but we have another butt in revelation 10 7 amen we see these people in the land they are like giants amen we look like grasshoppers in front of them amen but a little unbelief should not put fear into the people of god amen amen hallelujah don't let a little little living amen live in the whole lamp amen you eliminate that little level that little unbelief pluck it out of the church amen hallelujah he got the others trembling but while they were trembling caleb stands up before moses and in numbers 13 verse 30 he says caleb steal the people before moses i've got something to say and here's the testimony of caleb he says let us go up at once don't delay go today and possess it for we are well able to overcome it what was he saying how moses has already amen he was saying overcoming power is what we have today so god gave joshua the promise that he was to invite remember now listen to this god told joshua he was going to fight the entire campaign with an army but without a medical team there was no medical staff there was no nurses there was no first aid kits they didn't have the salvation army the land is yours go fight amen think of finding a war with no medical staff because nobody's gonna get hurt amen and that's what was promised to them amen amen they slew the amorites they slow the intakes without a single soldier being injured or killed that's a church marching in the will of god marching in the program of god no casualties amen hallelujah that was the first exodus amen that's how god was with moses and he proved that he was with joshua amen same scientific manifestations same overcoming power amen one spoke about them going into the land and one led them into the land with caleb backing them up amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord he says here but the believers the caleb and joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and they took the land and settled down in the land as a possession he says we the same way now remember we are going into our promised land which is the holy ghost he says let us stop at justification sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the holy spirit let's not stop at believing on the lord jesus christ being baptized let's not stop because he cleanses us up from a life of sin amen did he cleanse us from a life of sin amen but now we are pressed on into a position to a promise of the baptism of the holy ghost for peter said on the day of pentecost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call aren't you glad he called us amen after seven church ages he was still calling us amen now he says joshua let's put this up so the people that back and see amen you can't scroll joshua and caleb had that faith they said we are more than able to conquer anything that would come before us that's the trouble with the church we can conquer every disease we got the power in us that was a weak amen he says we got the power in us amen amen awaken ourselves this evening amen we are the sons and daughters of god nothing can stand before us amen nothing can stand before us yes he said only thing we want to find somebody who will believe it amen can we find somebody else every promise of god amen who will believe what god has already done for you not we will be we are now not we will be we are now amen and that and the ever living presence of the spirit is with us there you are amen hallelujah oh isn't jesus good to us amen isn't he wonderful he's a mighty god he's the prince of peace he's the everlasting father amen can we give the lord a good ankle for praise amen hallelujah awaken our tightness awaken us same as this evening jesus said as i was amen god said as i was with moses i will be with you amen hallelujah some people don't want the lord to walk with us amen some people only want the lord to walk with us on a sunday some people want the lord to walk with us amen on another day wednesday but every other day lord lead me to my own devices amen we should never be that way amen let us be like joshua and caleb was depending on the presence of the lord amen they couldn't go a day without it hallelujah we come to the second exodus and as i was with jesus i will be with you did he promise that to every believer you shall be endured with power luke 24 48 just before our lord jesus ascends up to heaven he says you are witnesses of these things and behold i personal pronoun i send the promise of my father upon you but carry in the city of jerusalem until you endure with power from an eye amen what was he telling him as i as the father said as i was with jesus i will be with the new testament believer you're going to be endured with power amen how is god with jesus amen he turned water into wine he healed the he raised the dead he opened the eyes of the blind he created eyeballs our god is a creator he opened up the deaf ears he walked on water amen he forgave the sinners amen he loved the unlovable he saved the unsavable amen hallelujah he spoke to the wind on the stormy sea and the man and one time he cursed the fig tree amen and god backed up his word hallelujah this was the creator in flesh creation for the first time after 4 000 years would see another adam amen what was jesus doing like moses destabilized the egyptian empire jesus was destabilizing the roman empire amen he was rocking the religious kingdom amen he was shaking up the spiritual realm of hell amen they didn't know what to do with jesus the religious leaders didn't know what to do with him so they conspired a story amen but pilate couldn't find no in him amen but still they whipped him with 39 stripes amen they nailed him to a cruel cross and put a crown of thorns upon his head thinking that they would silence him that that would be the end of this fanaticism hallelujah but that was only the beginning that wasn't the end of jesus that was just the beginning amen the grave couldn't hold him down three days in the grave was enough for him to do his work beyond the grave amen once it looked like he was defeated and his body lay in a borrowed tomb they even set up god around the tomb to guard the body amen it looked like he was defeated but in reality he was defeating satan and his kingdom in his theophany body melchizedek was at work amen then on sunday morning at the rising of the s-u-n amen the s-o-n raised triumphantly amen from the grave and he stepped into his glorified body hallelujah now you can't separate jesus from melchizedek anymore amen there were one body in this body he did the greater words he walked two walls amen he changed dimensions he ascended 40 days later and he passed every star he passed the sixth dimension he passed amen all the heavens amen and god raised him up so high amen into the seventh dimension and gave him a name above every other name amen a name that at the name of jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that he is lord amen amen hallelujah give the lord another good answer for praise amen that's the king of kings and that's the lord of lords and god backed up his word when he told him go into the upper room and carry there amen we know what happened in acts chapter 2 the holy spirit comes down like a sound of a mighty rushing wind he says like cloven tongues of fire and set upon each and every one of them 120 in the upper room waiting for the promise all of them endured with power amen all of them stumbling out of that room like drunk man amen filled with the holy ghost hallelujah amen amen the prophet of god tells us if it fell on them that way it will fall at every true believer in the same way amen we should be so drunk in the spirit of god that somebody should scream amen you know you can't keep a drunk man quiet he's just rowdy all the time amen so too are people that are drunk of the spirit of god amen they said amen they say hallelujah hallelujah amen and god backed up his word when he said as i was with jesus i'm going to be with you and new testament believers and these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover amen so much soul peter walking through the gate called beautiful one day and here's a man begging amen and he said silver and gold am i not but such as i have give i unto you in the name of jesus rise up and walk same power same manifestation amen hallelujah you can read how they raised up darkest a woman that was dead they called for peter to come peter come her name was tabitha also called jokers i think you'll find it in acts chapter 9 amen and similar thing happen watch the experiences they learn from the experiences because when jesus went to raise up another tabitha jamie's daughter you remember what he said take them out of the room he took peter and john inside amen only the believers were full of faith amen hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord amen some of you don't know the john that he took inside was the same john in revelation 10. amen amen hallelujah and he took unbelief out of the house amen and jesus said daughter arrives you see peter does the exact same thing he goes into the house everyone else is sent out and the holy spirit comes into the room and that girl is raised back to life amen same sign same manifestations same power amen what he could what jesus was one man and the signs could only go wherever you went physically amen but here now the power was split into 120 people and from there that one service that they have the bible says about 3 000 souls were baptized in jesus name the gospel started to spread hallelujah amen you can read miracle after miracle in the book of acts and the brother of god says that this bride will rewrite the book of acts amen hallelujah so get your testimonies ready be rewriting the book of acts amen build upon your most holy faith this evening hallelujah because these signs still follow them that believe amen hallelujah aren't you glad that you are a new testament believer endured with power from an eye amen jesus said greater words than thee shall he do for i go unto my father amen amen hallelujah you have a divine quality about you that divine quality is the holy spirit the holy ghost anointing that's upon you amen it's not there for fancy words amen is there to display the power of god yes amen hallelujah coming to the third exodus now as i was with branham so will i be with you amen i don't need to tell you the state that the church was in by the time brother branham came in on the scene amen it had started out with the outpouring of the holy spirit at azusa street but it soon died down into denominationalism into creeds and darkness and baptisms and all of these things like paul says let us not lay the foundations again but let us move on to perfection but they are denominated around an idea amen and each church was trying to win the lost and each one had a slogan a million more by 44. amen each one was trying to build up their organization hallelujah scripture for this is revelation 10 10 as i was with branham so will i be with you and i took the little book out of the angel town that same book was in branham's hand in revelation 10 7. i took the book out of the angel's hand and ate it out and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again amen before many peoples nations tongues and kings amen and this bright prophecy is not of the letter only because the letter killeth but this bride is filled with the spirit of god amen hallelujah she is packed with the mechanics but she also has the dynamics amen hallelujah we cannot out quote one another amen we cannot win arguments by quotes you cannot win arguments and defeat satan kingdom by the mechanics hallelujah satan loves to quote in fact he's got the church word and the message world so much against one another that it's one fighting the other with another quote quote against quote but you cannot fight this battle with the mechanics you gotta have the dynamics to give the mechanics life amen hallelujah we cannot say that we are just heroes of the world in fact we have become fat eagles in the message too much quotes that we know too much intellectualism that we know but the same person has no power within them only quote quote quote tell them pray for the sick and see the results of it there's no result they do not have faith but these signs shall follow them that believe amen amen hallelujah it seems like people don't want to believe the scriptures anymore oh we have the opening of the word we don't have need for any other thing you lying demon amen the church of god in a power packed church amen it's the holy ghost field church amen people you know why they want doing there they want to only injure on the one part of it is because they are backslidden when it comes time for the evidence god is not going to ask you how much quotes do you know repeat to me he wants to see the life back it up for the dynamics he wants to see the life amen hallelujah don't tell me about seven virtues when that seven virtues are not in you you can preach it as a doctrine you can preach it amen as a quote you can preach statue of a perfect man but let's see the evidence let me step on your toe a little bit and see how much patience you got how much temperance you got somebody don't see the something the way that you do don't want to fellowship with them and we as we and then we claim to be the statue of a perfect man unfortunately i'm here to tell you the statue of an imperfect man amen hallelujah how was god with branham amen god was with brannon from birth he led him and he guided him amen throughout his life even when he was tempted amen we are not exempt from temptation but even when he was tempted the voice admonished him do not drink do not smoke do not defile your body in any way amen for when you grow older i ever worked for you to do amen and what a glorious work it was amen from the voice in the ohio river telling him that his message would forerun the second coming amen to the angel meeting him in the cave and telling him he would take the gift of healing to the nations of the world he manifested and displayed the power of god amen he proved jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he did the greater works he was a son of man revealing the son of man amen he healed the sick he raised the and blind eyes were open death years could hear again the lame walked amen he spoke to the storm sounds similar to what we were talking about jesus he spoke to the storm amen hallelujah and it was calm again he spoke one time to a killer bull amen and he did not attack him amen he spoke to her on it killer on it and they did not harm him amen you spoke to squirrels and they came into existence hallelujah amen oh what a rich heritage we have amen and what a legacy that has just passed us by and the patron has been passed over to us and we are walking around with stupid shoulders shoulders feeling defeated when satan just got the whipping of his life a few years ago amen now he wants to come try is luck with you but we want to give it to the devil every time we feel down and our feelings are hurt we want to leave church and church hopping we got a lot of bunny rabbits in the message who like to hop amen up over here hop over there hop everywhere but they still claim to be in the body of christ but they have ought against you and enmity against you they think by leaving this church and going to another church or leaving that church and coming to this church solves the problem it doesn't solve the problem because you are the problem no amen's for that people don't believe people like to sit on the fence people don't have discernment the lord paul told them how are you going to judge the earth when you can't deserve matters amongst you you ask people to judge a matter i can't take sides i want to sit on the fence how do you know who was right and who was wrong you're a lying demon yes you know what that is an hypocrite that's an hypocrite a person who cannot judge between right and wrong wants to sit on the fence and say i don't want to take sides you're not take you'd rather take sides with jesus yes take sides of the word amen people don't like straight preaching but you need to hear them amen amen we're tired of what wishing washing christians with no backbones and that's how you let unbelief stay in the church by leaving people like that we need rugged christians we need soldiers in the church amen that's why the gospel is not advancing forward wish you worship what the prophet called him jellyfish christians amen keep popping one day you'll make your last stop amen he spoke squirrels into existence he spoke meera's tumor out of existence yes he gave salvation to actually writes two boys and there was no impersonation of this ministry show me an impersonation of the pillar of fire above three grams head show me the impersonation of the pillar fire over oral robertson you can't impersonate it even hollywood with a special effects can't reproduce the cloud happening okay because they didn't know to turn it to the right when these heathens on on youtube are trying to dispute the cloud and they're turning it to the right they have no business turning you to the right because they don't know if they're turning it to the right then they're believing the prophet that's right because he told him tonight to the right it was viewed the way it was taken the moment they turn it to the right and try to dispute it tell them you're lying demon amen the enemy will be exposed amen unbelief will be exposed when the spirit of god is moving you will root out all unbelief but you'll find resistance to it but we've got to press forward amen so no impersonation of the pillar of fire no impersonation of the throne room that was caught you all know the throne room picture the one where the lilies came up one picture the plants are normal next thing there's amber light lilies are grown up that's called the throne room one right caught in the camera while she was preaching then he was caught up in the constellation of seven angels nobody wanted to impersonate that and receive the commission from the mighty angel the mighty angel that came down in revelation 10 william branham met him yes how do you know he met him brother brandon when he's talking about him standing there with his hands raised to the air and he says that sword fell into his hand amen and then he's trying to understand why the sword and then he said it must have been somebody standing there next to me it was wreaking sword amen hallelujah what a mighty ministry can we compare that is not based on us he's based on our submission yes he's based on our faith yes but he's gonna back up his word yes amen amen he unsealed the seven seals and the seven thunders the trumpets the files and the glorious mysteries that are locked up in the book of revelation yes amen there shouldn't be a single thing in the book of revelation that this bride does not understand that's right amen yes because every step of the way didn't an angel come before him and reveal to john and show showing these things so majestic was his angel and so similar was he to christ that john wanted to bow down before him but sons and daughters of god amen are following william branham sons and daughters of god have been following william branham amen when i say following william branham they have come after him amen they have been called out from every genominational system they have been called out amen to come up a little higher amen sons and daughters have a greater weapon then now they're talking about an atomic bomb you must have heard belarus the one that's in alliance with russia he's asking russia to what they call it he says to prepare your nuclear warfare they just asked them to do that the other day it says please prepare your atomic warfare because nato is about they feel that nature is going to attack the whole world is trembling because of atomic warfare amen but we as sons and daughters of god we we spoke about moses destabilizing egypt we spoke about jesus destabilizing the roman empire we spoke about branham destabilizing the religious system of that day and even took on 300 denominational giants that came there to challenge him amen but when he went in the front with his bible and he said if any of you can dispute or disprove anything that i've preached from this bible bring your bible and come stand next to me he says not one of them moved all of them shut up he silenced them if they they stabilized destabilized all of these kingdoms the pride of jesus christ is here to destabilize satan's kingdom at the end time and this time they are going to do a good and complete work because it's the end of time amen satan's kingdom is going to be brought down amen i'm talking about the curtain of the gentile kingdom this bread closes up the gentile kingdom amen and satan cannot mess with the gentile kingdom anymore because this bride finishes off once and for all even he can't find us when the rapture takes place satan is going to put a missing person's report for you i should love to torment this person i can't find them yes amen amen hallelujah and how do we destabilize and annihilate the kingdom of satan reports head knowledge reminding him what happened two thousand years ago reminding him what happened in the days of the prophet we need to raise him out of history jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever satan is not interested in how much you can quote yes amen is looking for that life what life holy spirit life power now he says let's see what atomic warfare we got you want to see if we got atomic warfare let's read what man calls great god calls foolish what man calls foolish god calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of god and find out after all what god wants us to do and the only way i know to do it is prayer i thought it would be some super duper thing i can go stand on the mountain and say here he or phoenix people he are doomed i have atomic warfare no he says the only way i know to do it is prayer yes amen and prayer not like the muslim man now you don't get the idea yes i'm going to get this loud on and pray for the secret prayer prayer is the key amen wow yes you want 21st key don't get 21st key without this key okay prayer is the key you want an answer to your to what you're asking the lord he says that's the answer so prayer is the key prayer is the answer prayer changes things amen prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings one time the prophet came to the king you're going to die i don't want to beat around the bush and tell you hey you know things are looking fine he said you're going to die the prophet says i didn't copy the whole culture the next paragraph after this he deals with that he says prayer changed the mind of god and he added 15 more years to his life he says prayer changes things pray is the most powerful weapon that was ever in the control of the human beings there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer amen prayer will change the mind of god did you know that it did do it one time and then he goes to explain it now please when you go home don't pray for putin not to release the bonds don't pray that lord prolonged things pray tell do like jesus said tell judas go do what you must do quickly if you've got social media accounts put the hashtag hashtag him putin whatever go find his handle and tell him do what you must do quickly amen we know that hallie's shaking do you know when you walk into a place why demons tremble why spirits manifest when you walk into a room and people are not happy to see you that's a spirit within them yes sometimes in the flesh we take it personally i was telling our brother joshua is there he says no man that's a spirit being upset that you walked into the room hey hell is shaking when you walk into their presence you walk into a home and you watch how they scatter like cockroaches when you put the light on your power i have given you power amen what power holy ghost power to train on serpents and scorpions and overcome all the power of the enemy not some of the power now jesus is not talking about little serpents and scorpions here he's talking about satan's kingdom he's calling them serpents and scorpions and all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you what the enemy means for evil god will turn it for your good yes amen they're planning at work to fire you they're to promote you stop being fearful you're going for a job interview tell them how much you want tell them otherwise you cannot have the son of god don't be fearful do you know what fear has done fears let you settle into the job that you are in right now you took whatever they offered you and you're hoping they don't fire you but faith will tell them this is how much i require i am no ordinary person you are employing a holy ghost field son or daughter of god if you want to know references phone this reference here see joseph in the bible they put him in port of his house that's my relative you want contacts they ask me for context isn't it where what contact who's your contact person tell them joseph in the bible they can put me in part of his house they can put me in prison but pharaoh made me in charge over the whole land amen you know even pharaoh's children had to bow before joseph the bible says everyone everybody had to bow before joseph the only one that was exempt was pharaoh even pharaoh's children when joseph was coming and they blew that trumpet must bow before joseph so tell them i come from a rich heritage i know what i am i know i'm worth i don't go there and slack on the job now i'm ready to switch to the family name okay you wanna claim joseph what you're gonna work like laban no don't do that make the family name proud okay he says here not with standing now watch he says i've given you all of this power trample on snakes scorpions overcome all the enemy schemes but he says notwithstanding now watch he's going to give you a revelation here don't rejoice in the souls only that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven amen amen and let me tell you there's only one group of people that have seen the unsealed book with their names on it that can truly rejoice because when john saw john like the prophet says he says all of heaven and all of earth heard me rejoice amen greater than that amen hallelujah if you really want hell to tremble is see your name in the book show him your title dear kick satan off your property kick satan off he's a squatter in fact satan is used to being kicked out he was kicked out of heaven when jesus went into hell he gave him another kick yes amen he got kicked in hell when jesus took the keys of death hell and the grave satan knows your shoe size anytime you get you don't forget your shoe size or somebody wants to buy your payoff shoe and you forgot ask satan because your foot is supposed to be honest he should never speak to you from an elevated position that's right amen if he wants to speak to you he must speak to you from the dust of the earth amen amen satan knows your shoe size because the believer has their foot on the head of the serpent now here's prophecy amen you are the invincible army you're close he says christ in the true church are you the true church is a continuation of the book of acts are you rewriting the book of acts amen hallelujah the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless so anything that's coming now to make you lukewarm formal and powerless don't only look for the catholic church judas was in the church within the message if they are trying to make you formal if they are trying to make you look warm and powerless that's the antichrist spirit it says it exposes satan revealing his works amen right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do the greater works that's prophecy for you you shall do the greater works in fact you are doing the greater works amen she will be an invincible army invading satan's kingdom pulling down every principality pulling down every stronghold amen satan will be powerless before her amen how many of you play mortal kombat young people don't know what mortal kombat is you know when you're eating that guy in the end his only body is only going like this and that's voice is finishing so satan is powerless he's standing like that before you but is he sinking you know what is he saying when jesus kicked him all his teeth came out that's why he whistles like that hey amen he says satan will be powerless before you yes amen he will be as definitely toward it today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen in another another message in church book he says the people who took his revelation from god became living epistles read and known of all men for their generation right better than knowing the dynamics better than you quoting the dynamics they must read the dynamics sorry better than them you're quoting them the mechanics rather let them read it with your life don't just quote poor quote if you love somebody they can truly see that you love them it's not fake amen there is no love in the denominational world out there so people know when the bride of jesus christ is genuine amen and sometimes love may be corrective amen amen sometimes maybe we go too hard on them amen they feel like we're coming on too hard amen but what you're trying to do save their soul amen so he says follow his thought now the people who took his revelation from god that's got the book now in the hand become the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation what will they say of us when our time has come and it's time for us to go maybe not even in the rapture but when the lord calls us home what
