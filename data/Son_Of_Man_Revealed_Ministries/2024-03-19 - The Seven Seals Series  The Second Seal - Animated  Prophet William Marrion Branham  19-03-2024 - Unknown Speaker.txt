========================================

now tonight we are studying this uh second seal and for the first four seals there is four harsh Riders then I grab me a pencil right quick and start writing down as fast as I can while he's there he's doing something real Supernatural now too and so we're just expecting great things now I'll read the third verse now and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse fourth verse that was red and power was given to him that set thereon to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and he didn't see what it was he just saw a symbol and that symbol for the reason it was he said come see but he saw a symbol that he was to symbolize it to the church and remember the secrets was to be revealed in the last day and how does he reveal his word is Secrets the Bible notice the first church when the Catholic Church says that they were the first original Church they're exactly right they were they began at Pentecost that's where the Catholic Church began now I once didn't hardly believe that I read history and I find out it's right now let's go to the second seal when the slaying risen lamb opened it and the second uh C like Beast said come see what the seal m stre is now we get it the lamb you remember has to open every seal the second first was a line the next was a was a was like a calf or ox or something he see we find here that he saw what a red horse go forward let's just read and see what he says here and there went out fourth verse there went out another horse that was red the first in his wife and power was given unto him that set there on to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given him a great sword now there symbols here and we want to look at him real close let us now consider what John saw then of these things what he saw a red horse and his riter Goes Forth power given to him to slay with with a great sword now here's my revelation of it this is Satan again it's a devil again in another form now we know that that U seals pertained as it said the other night and trumpets pertain to to to to Civil Wars you see amongst the people among nations but you find out here that this man had is a sword so he pertains to church political war you might not think that but just watch it a minute notice the change of color of these horses same Rider change of color of horses and a horse is a beast and the Beast in the Bible and her symbol represents a power the same system riding on another color power from the innocent white to a bloody red see watch him now he's coming when he first started he was just well he just a little Doctrine in the in called the nicoladis of course it wouldn't slay anything that's Revelations 2:6 if you want to put it down then after while he was given a crown of course you can't put a crown crown on a spirit's head but when this Spirit become incarnate the second work of his of his dispensation of his Missy the second work he become a crowned false prophet to the working of the Antichrist Spirit now we see now now now he becomes that when he takes that then he uh is already Satan control the political powers of the world now he gets into a place that he's going to make a universal church power taking religious power and do you not understand my brothers that in when this nation appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation this little animal raised up like a lamb and it's got two horns civil and ecclesiastical power but he done the same thing the Beast did before him now when he did that he did not have the ecclesiastical power yet but he started in with a demon of a false teaching and that teaching become a doctrine that Doctrine become incarnate in a false prophet and then he went just to the right place he never went to Israel now he went went to Rome n see of Rome the council was held and they elected a head Bishop amen and then by doing this they United church and state together then he dropped his bow he got off his White Horse he got on his red horse or he can kill anybody that don't agree with him there's your seal same fell watch him right on into eternity under see unites both his powers together now we find out he unites his power then when he become both state and church ecclesiastical then what are you going to do he forms his own religion and now he can do whatever he wants to then he has the right to put the death whosoever not agree with him that's exactly what he did too amen he went back down to hippo and he was a very one that signed that that paper that had the Revelation from God that was all right and pleasing God to put every person to death that didn't believe with the Roman Catholic church now listen I'm quoting from the martyrology from the time of of St Augustine of Hippo until 1586 on the Roman martyrology the Roman Catholic Church put 68 million Protestants to [Music] death was his sword red was he right a red horse what was it the same power the same Rider there's the seal they admit 68 million on the mar Ry besides all that was put to death outside of that oh mercy during the Dark Ages there were Millions fed the Lions and Slaughter and every way because they wouldn't bow down to that Catholic dogma now let me say something brother there's something fixing to happen and all these big old ecclesiastical walls are go to collapse go right back over on and agree because we go to do it as certain as I'm standing here there's an image to that beast that's a c as I'm standing you're in this nation tucking according to the word of the law amen listen when you feel that little funny feeling you get away from them walls get away you'll die there don't do it come out of it get away from all this stuff please to safety as quick as you can ask God for Mercy let's bow our heads Heavenly Father oh I I just sometimes Lord stand year in and I tremble I think of that awful hour that's approaching and uh there's no way to stop it it's predicted it would come now I thought of why don't the people come and and and listen and won't they come and accept it but of course I know that that you you said they would so they want but there is some that's got their names written on the Lamb's Book of Life and when them seals are thrown open there they see their name there and the Holy Spirit speaks to them they come you can't keep them away no one can no one we we want you to search our hearts if there's anything wrong Lord let us know now please don't let us come to that hour y one it's too late search Me Try Me Lord we want to be able when that mysterious Thunder Thunders out down and the churches taken up we want to be ready to receive it Lord granted granted I pray that God will give you this charge in Jesus Christ's name
