[0:04] Amen. I greet you all in the precious
[0:06] name, the holy name. Amen. The name that
[0:10] is above every other name. Amen. The
[0:12] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[0:14] Christ. Amen. I pray that everyone is
[0:17] well. Amen.
[0:18] And hallelujah. Good to be back in the
[0:21] house of the Lord. We'll go to 1 Peter
[0:22] chapter 2:9.
[0:34] Amen. 1 Peter chapter
[0:38] 2:9 says, "But you are a chosen
[0:44] generation." Amen. A generation that is
[0:49] chosen, a royal
[0:52] priesthood, and holy nation, a peculiar
[0:56] people. that you should show forth the
[0:58] praises of him who had called you out of
[1:01] darkness into his marvelous light. Amen.
[1:06] The Lord had blessings to the reading of
[1:07] his word. Amen. You can find the quotes.
[1:11] Amen. I'll send it to you there. Amen.
[1:13] You may be seated. Praise the
[1:19] Lord. Amen. A chosen
[1:22] generation. Amen. They say a generation
[1:25] lasts between 25, 30 years. Some say 40
[1:28] years. He's a
[1:30] generation.
[1:33] Amen. But God has a special chosen
[1:36] generation for the end time.
[1:39] Not like any other generation that we've
[1:41] seen before.
[1:43] Amen. It's a special class of people.
[1:46] Amen. And I want you to hear what the
[1:48] prophet of God would say here in the
[1:51] message. Amen. The spoken word is the
[1:54] original seed. Amen. He says each
[1:58] generation has its own revival.
[2:01] Amen. Each generation has its own
[2:05] revival.
[2:09] Amen. Now, since the prophet went away,
[2:12] it's now 60
[2:13] years. So, I say a generation is having
[2:17] a revival.
[2:20] A word revival. Yeah. Amen. By what was
[2:23] sent to us by this vindicated prophet.
[2:28] And as the prophet would say, as light
[2:30] is needed, it'll be given. And we can
[2:34] see the unfolding of that statement. As
[2:37] light is needed, it is now given to us.
[2:40] Amen. You'll find that in the spoken
[2:42] word is the original seed, paragraph
[2:43] 110. Amen.
[2:46] Hallelujah. He says, "Each generation
[2:49] has its own revival.
[2:52] Amen. Now, what is a revival? It's a
[2:55] churning out. It's a getting rid of all
[2:58] the dross. If you watch, you go to the
[3:00] ocean, the beach, the beach is having a
[3:02] revival. It's throwing all the trash
[3:04] back onto the earth. Amen. So, when the
[3:08] Holy Ghost comes in our lives, it's
[3:11] cleaning out all the unwanted things in
[3:13] our lives.
[3:15] Amen. And he's trying to reestablish his
[3:18] purpose in our life.
[3:22] Now when Jesus is saying seek you first
[3:24] the kingdom of God, he's asking you to
[3:26] seek the Holy Ghost.
[3:28] He's saying the first thing must be the
[3:30] Holy Ghost.
[3:33] Hallelujah.
[3:34] The first thing must be the Holy Ghost.
[3:38] Because that's the kingdom of God that's
[3:40] within you. The Holy Ghost is the
[3:43] kingdom of God within you. So he says
[3:44] each generation has its own revival, a
[3:47] chance at the word. Amen. And then you
[3:50] go to paragraph 113
[3:53] there he says that's why each generation
[3:56] has its
[3:58] revival God raises up a man sets him
[4:01] with the word with his word and starts
[4:04] him out for the message for that age.
[4:08] Hallelujah.
[4:10] So we have come now to a stage in the
[4:13] journey where we have seen scriptures
[4:14] unfold before our eyes. Scriptures that
[4:17] are hid from the wise and the prudent.
[4:20] Scriptures that people can read. They
[4:23] got physical eyesight. They can read
[4:24] scriptures, but they can't see it come
[4:26] to pass.
[4:29] Amen. They can read Malachi 4:5 and 6.
[4:33] They can read Revelation 101. Amen. All
[4:36] the way to verse 11. But nothing is
[4:38] quickened to them.
[4:40] But the Holy Ghost is placed in our
[4:42] hearts to quicken the word for our age.
[4:45] Amen. And praise the Lord. I want you to
[4:47] see what the prophet of God is saying
[4:48] here. Amen.
[4:51] Hallelujah. Amen. You can pick up this
[4:53] message in I have heard but now I see.
[4:55] This is all now in
[4:56] 1965. Amen. I have heard but now I see.
[5:00] I want you to see. Amen. I want you to
[5:02] leave your
[5:03] confident that the Holy Ghost, you have
[5:06] received the Holy Ghost.
[5:09] Amen. The fact that you are sitting here
[5:12] is evidence that you have received the
[5:14] Holy Ghost. I want you to hear how the
[5:16] prophet of God says this. Amen. In I
[5:19] heard by now see paragraph 103. He says
[5:22] no matter how religious you are, how
[5:24] many churches you belong to, how many
[5:27] books your name's
[5:29] on, if that genuine Holy Ghost is in
[5:32] you, which is the word manifested.
[5:37] So the Holy Ghost in you is the word
[5:40] manifested. Watch what he says. Now
[5:43] you'll see the message and the hour
[5:47] because it's the Holy Ghost that does
[5:49] it. That's why you got to seek the Holy
[5:51] Ghost first.
[5:54] Amen. So he's saying the Holy Ghost, if
[5:56] it's the genuine Holy Ghost, you'll see
[5:58] the message and the hour. Not only the
[6:01] message, you'll see the hour. Amen.
[6:05] Because it's the Holy Ghost that does
[6:07] it.
[6:09] Hallelujah. Let's put up that picture if
[6:11] you can. Amen. If you got that picture
[6:13] this, now I want you to know things
[6:15] happen on and and it's not for no
[6:17] reason. This picture fleshed all over
[6:19] the news, fleshed all over the internet.
[6:23] This here is a culmination of Revelation
[6:25] 13. It's not there for no reason.
[6:32] Because there's a voice that will speak
[6:33] like the dragon.
[6:36] But watch how they flesh it in the
[6:37] media. But watch what the prophet of God
[6:40] says. If you go back to the quote,
[6:41] you'll see the message and the hour.
[6:47] You'll see the year being marked.
[6:52] Hallelujah. You'll see Revelation 13.
[6:56] The voice speaking for the dragon.
[7:00] Praise the Lord. Signs coming closer and
[7:03] closer and closer.
[7:05] Amen. Hallelujah.
[7:08] Praise the Lord.
[7:11] Now, if we go back to that quote, I just
[7:14] want to finish
[7:18] off watch where he takes us.
[7:21] Now,
[7:23] right, there has to be something light
[7:27] that off. Inspiration must strike you.
[7:32] If you pour water on the ground and
[7:34] there's no seed in there to strike it,
[7:36] how can it bring forth
[7:38] anything right now? Remember, there's a
[7:41] gene seed within
[7:44] you. There's nothing there to bring
[7:46] forth. That is it. That only the elected
[7:50] of God will see it.
[7:54] Now you know why we are called a special
[7:56] class of people.
[7:58] Hidden from the eyes of the wise and
[8:00] prudent but revealed to babes such as
[8:02] would learn.
[8:04] Amen. So I want you to see yourself as
[8:07] God sees you. God sees you as the most
[8:11] royal priesthood, a chosen generation.
[8:15] Don't matter what the world thinks of
[8:16] you or how they view you. Don't matter
[8:18] what denominations think of you, family,
[8:20] friends, whatever they think of you, God
[8:22] sees you as the most important people on
[8:25] the earth right now. You are moving
[8:27] God's program forward.
[8:30] Hallelujah.
[8:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. How many of you
[8:35] know why the Holy Ghost, you don't feel
[8:37] the Holy Ghost move like a mighty
[8:39] rushing wind right now, even though God
[8:40] could do
[8:44] it? How many of you know why?
[8:48] Amen. God could come. Mighty rushing
[8:51] winds sweep through this place right
[8:55] now. Hey, pin
[8:58] drop. How many of you know why? So the
[9:02] Holy Ghost, now think of God's
[9:05] condescension. He was father, spirit. He
[9:09] condescended to
[9:10] word, theophony
[9:13] body, and he was made flesh.
[9:16] Right? But in the in the Godhead, it is
[9:18] father, son, and holy spirit. But the
[9:22] holy spirit was not made to float around
[9:25] like a ghost.
[9:26] The Holy Ghost was sent to tabernacle
[9:28] men.
[9:33] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is not meant
[9:36] to be around like a mighty rushing wind.
[9:38] When it's coming to tabernacle men,
[9:40] hello. Come on, somebody catch this.
[9:42] When it's coming to tabernacle men, it's
[9:44] coming like a mighty rushing wind.
[9:49] But then it appears to them like cloven
[9:52] tongues of fire and then it goes into
[9:54] man.
[9:56] So if there is to be another mighty
[9:58] rushing wind,
[9:59] the church must be in action and must be
[10:02] on the move for you to see the mighty
[10:04] rushing wind move.
[10:08] If the church is still, the Holy Ghost
[10:10] won't be moving.
[10:12] So the only way you'll see another mover
[10:14] like a mighty rushing wind is when the
[10:15] church is on the move. When God is in
[10:17] the in the church in action.
[10:21] Hallelujah. We're looking for physical
[10:23] manifestations on the outside when the
[10:25] Holy Ghost is inside us.
[10:30] And we are supposed to unleash.
[10:35] Hallelujah. Stop looking for external
[10:37] signs. Stop looking for sensations. The
[10:40] one that was sent is in you. Amen.
[10:43] Hallelujah.
[10:45] Glory be to his name. So I'm saying be a
[10:48] generation that has a chance at the
[10:49] word.
[10:51] Amen. That's what the prophet said
[10:53] there. Each generation has a chance at
[10:55] the word. This is no other time and no
[10:58] other age. This is a chance for the age
[11:01] of adoption.
[11:02] Hallelujah. We are candidates. Amen.
[11:05] Where Amen. The Lord is working in us to
[11:08] bring us to such a place now where the
[11:10] final part will be our body change. The
[11:12] final process of adoption.
[11:17] Amen. So now's the time not to slack up.
[11:20] Now's the time, Amen, to be on fire for
[11:22] God. Now's the time to move with the
[11:25] Holy Spirit. Amen. Now's not the time to
[11:27] backslide. In fact, you can't get a son
[11:29] and daughter of God to backslide.
[11:31] Backsliding is not in our language.
[11:33] Amen. We don't know what it is to
[11:34] backslide. Amen. We only knew what it is
[11:37] to move forward, onward, and upward.
[11:40] Amen. The church is likened to an eagle.
[11:42] The church is not an eagle, but it's
[11:45] likened to an eagle. Come on, somebody.
[11:48] Amen. You The church is made up of sons
[11:51] and daughters of God. And sons and
[11:53] daughters of God are higher than an
[11:55] eagle. But it's likened to an eagle
[11:57] because it flies to the heavenlies. It's
[12:00] not a a earthbound bird. Neither does it
[12:03] eat stagnant meat. old food lying around
[12:06] every day. The the meat must be fresh,
[12:09] must have a fresh kill. So have your
[12:11] chance at the word for your generation.
[12:16] Amen. You were chosen for this time and
[12:18] season. Praise the Lord. Amen. You were
[12:21] not chosen, Amen. for no other season,
[12:23] no other time. You're not chosen for the
[12:25] tribulation.
[12:27] Praise the Lord. You were not chosen for
[12:29] the tribulation. Neither were you chosen
[12:32] prior at the outpouring of the gifts.
[12:34] You were not chosen for
[12:36] Pentecosta street outpouring.
[12:39] So then you must be chosen for something
[12:40] else.
[12:45] You were chosen here when it's the first
[12:49] time the gentile world has seen a
[12:50] gentile prophet
[12:53] and all of them missed it except you.
[12:59] That's why he's saying it's the Holy
[13:01] Ghost in you recognizing this.
[13:05] Hallelujah. Now, let's follow that. He
[13:07] says only the elected of God will see
[13:09] it. The elected of God seen it in Noah's
[13:13] time, Moses time, Jesus time, the
[13:15] apostles time, Luther's time, Wesley's
[13:17] time, Pentecostal time, because that was
[13:20] the seed that was on the earth when this
[13:22] inspiration was poured out. Amen.
[13:25] Then he says, "Now while the
[13:28] inspirations poured out to gather the
[13:30] bride together." Somebody tell me that's
[13:32] a shout.
[13:36] To gather the living saints. He says,
[13:38] "Now while the inspiration's poured out
[13:42] to gather the bride together, it's only
[13:44] those who are elected will see it."
[13:48] Amen. Hallelujah.
[13:51] Jesus said, "So I thank thee thou that
[13:53] that thou has hid these things from the
[13:55] eyes of the wise and prudent and
[13:57] revealed it to babes such as we'll
[13:59] learn." Watch how he ends it. He says,
[14:02] "Now inspiration has to strike it."
[14:11] So he's saying that that's like saying
[14:14] the dynamics must come upon the
[14:15] mechanics. Yes.
[14:18] Remember, this is not child's plane.
[14:20] Now, this is 1965. He's fixing to go off
[14:22] the scene. So, he's giving in nuggets
[14:24] here.
[14:26] Inspiration must strike it. Dynamics
[14:28] must come upon the mechanics.
[14:31] Hallelujah.
[14:32] So, when he's saying dynamics must come
[14:35] upon the mechanics, he's saying it's
[14:36] time to switch it up a higher gear.
[14:40] Amen. It's saying it's time to get away.
[14:43] Amen. From the automobile age.
[14:46] Time to get away from the aeroplane age
[14:48] and time to get into the astronaut age.
[14:51] Amen. Glory,
[14:54] pressurized different. Amen. Hallelujah.
[14:58] Glory. Amen. Conditioned different.
[15:01] Amen. Conditioned to to to leave the
[15:05] elements of this world and move into
[15:06] heavenly places.
[15:08] Amen. Do you know there's a certain
[15:10] level in the atmosphere where a normal
[15:13] man can't breathe?
[15:16] But we are conditioned now to move into
[15:18] heavenly places.
[15:22] Glory. Now watch the cares of this life
[15:24] will come to choke that seed and pull
[15:26] you back down to the earthly realms.
[15:29] Hallelujah. You're a son of God.
[15:31] Somebody comes now to interfere with
[15:33] you. God is putting you through testings
[15:34] and trainings and trials in your life
[15:36] every day.
[15:38] As a son of God, you're under a tutor,
[15:41] under a guide. Amen. So watch how we
[15:45] react in these situations because what
[15:47] is that pulling you out of heavenly
[15:49] realms into a hurtly realms. Now
[15:52] suddenly you want to pull up your
[15:53] sleeves and fight. Suddenly you want to
[15:55] argue with somebody. Suddenly you want
[15:58] to be carnal and be
[16:00] fleshly. What is that? That is not
[16:03] representing the kingdom of God. You
[16:05] can't be one day in the kingdom of God
[16:06] or maybe one minute in the kingdom of
[16:08] God, the other day in the kingdom of the
[16:10] world. Amen. You're coming back in the
[16:12] kingdom of God and calling yourself a
[16:13] son of God. The Bible says, "Don't be a
[16:15] reproach for his name."
[16:22] Hallelujah. We find people are too proud
[16:24] in this time. Amen. Too proud in this
[16:27] season. Pride. Hallelujah. Very hard for
[16:32] people. Amen. To humble themselves. To
[16:35] humble themselves to the word of
[16:37] God. Hallelujah.
[16:41] Yeah. The Bible says clearly, if you
[16:44] offend one of these little ones, he says
[16:46] it's rather that a milstone be taken
[16:48] around your neck and you thrown into the
[16:50] ocean than to rather offend one of my
[16:53] little
[16:54] ones. I ask you again, we thrown into
[16:57] trials and situations every day of our
[16:59] lives, emergencies. Amen. Uh may maybe
[17:04] situations at work. Amen. Testings,
[17:06] trials at school. Amen. Wherever we
[17:09] are, how are we now reacting in those
[17:12] situations? You know what God is doing
[17:14] in those? You think God is bringing
[17:16] those situations? He says, "If you're my
[17:19] son, I will put you through these
[17:20] situations to try train you and bring
[17:23] you through those things. It's training
[17:27] grounds. The Christian walk is not a bed
[17:31] of roses.
[17:34] God is trying to develop or not he's
[17:36] trying God is developing our character.
[17:40] God's not going to take you push you
[17:42] through a pipe and pull you out on the
[17:43] other end and say you've overcome. He
[17:46] says no. You have to pay a price as
[17:48] well. There's a cross that you and I
[17:50] must carry.
[17:52] Amen. And I want you to know that when
[17:54] you come into God's
[17:57] kingdom, God's kingdom is not a kingdom
[18:00] of lack.
[18:07] Amen. God doesn't tell you seek the
[18:09] kingdom first because in the kingdom
[18:11] there's
[18:14] lack. Hallelujah. The kingdom of God is
[18:17] a superior kingdom.
[18:20] Amen. It's one that you can't compare
[18:23] with the worldly kingdom.
[18:26] Yeah. We earn a few rands, we buy a few
[18:28] things, and we walk around with status.
[18:31] in God's kingdom. Amen. Everything is
[18:34] unlocked to
[18:35] us in that kingdom realm
[18:39] where even the gold is
[18:42] pavement which means it becomes
[18:44] worthless.
[18:45] If the most treasured thing here on the
[18:47] earthly kingdom is some gold that you
[18:49] put around your neck or you put on your
[18:52] finger and you think you're somebody now
[18:54] you got
[18:56] gold here in God's kingdom he puts it on
[18:59] the
[19:02] floor.
[19:08] Amen. In God's kingdom there's no
[19:12] lack. Amen.
[19:14] is the prophet of God in this message.
[19:16] It says here, if you're laying sick or
[19:18] afflicted, there's a king of kings
[19:20] watching over you. So even when you're
[19:23] afflicted and in your your sick bed,
[19:25] there's a king watching over you.
[19:29] He says, "Do you not know that he's
[19:31] interested in your healing and in your
[19:33] welfare?"
[19:35] Come on now. Not just your healing, but
[19:37] your welfare.
[19:40] Do you know what gyra is? Provider. the
[19:44] God who provides. Amen. So in the
[19:46] kingdom, there's no lack. There's no
[19:48] lack of healing.
[19:50] There's no lack of welfare. Here in the
[19:53] welfare, they give you a couple hundred
[19:54] grand and you must be help happy with
[19:56] it. But that's Ramapora's economy.
[20:00] But I'm talking about the economy of the
[20:02] King of Kings, the economy of the Lord
[20:05] of Lords. Amen.
[20:07] Now every every government, every
[20:10] kingdom must provide basic rights for
[20:12] its citizens,
[20:15] rights to education, rights to
[20:17] protection. Amen. Hallelujah. Rights to
[20:22] uh they they even say it in our in our
[20:24] constitution, rights to decent
[20:27] housing, rights to clean water, rights
[20:30] there, they they list a whole lot of
[20:32] rights. Amen. Hallelujah. But I want you
[20:35] to know that in this kingdom of God that
[20:37] he's telling you to seek first, God has
[20:39] an economy set up for you. And that's
[20:42] economy that can't be equated with the
[20:44] earthly economy. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[20:48] the currency, what is the currency that
[20:50] operates in this economy? It's faith.
[20:53] Faith is the currency that unlocks every
[20:56] promise in this economy.
[20:59] Hallelujah. In this economy, you can
[21:02] unlock everything. And it's all by
[21:04] believing the word of God. Do you know
[21:06] if you're you got a sick person right
[21:08] here now, you can go to God's economy,
[21:10] which is his word, and use the currency
[21:12] called faith, to activate that word, and
[21:15] that sick can be healed right now. Thank
[21:17] you, Lord. Lord, if you're in lack and
[21:20] you need finances, come on now. There
[21:22] was a woman
[21:29] this woman at two sticks
[21:33] She had a cup of flour.
[21:36] She had some water oil. And she was
[21:37] going to She was in the earthly
[21:40] economy of Ahab. Was it Ahab? Of King
[21:45] Ahab. But yet she didn't know that there
[21:48] was supernatural was coming towards her
[21:52] and God had told his prophet, "Get to
[21:54] this woman for I have commanded a woman
[21:57] to nourish you."
[22:00] She didn't know that her last meal was
[22:02] going to nourish the prophet of God.
[22:07] Hallelujah. I'm telling you, there's
[22:09] another woman on the earth right now
[22:10] that's nourishing the word of the
[22:12] prophet of the Lord. There's no other
[22:14] group of people that's nourishing the
[22:17] word that stored up spiritual food in
[22:19] due season that's giving life to the
[22:22] prophet's word. There's only one group
[22:24] of people that's giving life to the
[22:26] prophet William Brandham's word. Thank
[22:28] you, Jesus. And that unlocks the
[22:31] supernatural economy.
[22:34] Because from the earthly now, she
[22:36] stepped into the heavenly economy. She
[22:39] stepped into God's economy. And there
[22:41] the barrel never run dry. There the
[22:43] cruise of oil never run dry. Hallelujah.
[22:46] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[22:48] the Lord.
[22:51] Amen. Amen. So I say whose economy do
[22:53] you want to live in? Amen. Here we have
[22:56] Amen. the South African Defense Force
[22:58] for protection but and even the South
[23:00] African police and need I say the metro
[23:02] police but you can't trust these
[23:04] protection.
[23:06] Hallelujah. But in the army of the Lord
[23:08] Jesus Christ, he's taking care of our
[23:10] protection. Amen. He's Jehovah n our
[23:13] banner. Amen. Amen.
[23:16] Glory be to his name. Amen. And he's got
[23:18] angel armies that are watching over us.
[23:20] He says, "Don't you know though you that
[23:22] fear the Lord, the angel of the Lord
[23:24] encamps around you?"
[23:27] What does that mean? When you go to
[23:29] work, the angel of the Lord is going
[23:31] with you. It encamps with you. Amen.
[23:34] When you're going, Amen. to court, when
[23:36] you're going to school, wherever you're
[23:38] going, Amen. Though you're walking
[23:40] through the valley of the shadow of
[23:41] death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
[23:44] with me.
[23:47] We got to walk with a confidence.
[23:50] Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[23:53] Hallelujah. God cares for our welfare.
[23:56] God cares for our everyday needs. Amen.
[23:59] God is a God who watches over us and his
[24:01] economy is unlocked to them that seek
[24:04] the kingdom of God first.
[24:09] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. He
[24:11] says, "Oh, come on."
[24:15] And if you are in his kingdom, you ought
[24:16] to operate like Jesus.
[24:19] I don't expect anyone to be in his
[24:20] kingdom and look down on people.
[24:23] Where you think you're superior than
[24:25] someone, I say even prostitutes can come
[24:27] to the church. I say even drunk can come
[24:30] to the church because the church is an
[24:32] hospital of God. It's here where sinners
[24:34] are made saints. Amen. It's the
[24:36] cleansing power of the Lord Jesus
[24:38] Christ. Amen.
[24:40] If we don't have that attitude, we'll be
[24:42] like Simon sitting in his house,
[24:44] scoffing at Jesus because an adulterous
[24:47] woman was washing his feet.
[24:50] Watch what he says now. He says, "Do you
[24:52] not know the King of Kings is watching
[24:54] you? Do you not know he's interested in
[24:56] your healing and in your welfare?"
[24:59] Now, how about you put a claim like
[25:01] that? Lord, you said you are interested
[25:03] in my welfare and I have need of this
[25:05] now. I don't have need of this tomorrow.
[25:08] Hallelujah. I have need of this now. In
[25:11] fact, your word already said by his
[25:13] stripes I was already healed. Your word
[25:15] says that I have a father who owns a
[25:17] cattle on a thousand hills. And I'm
[25:19] making a claim in this economy.
[25:22] Thank you, Jesus.
[25:28] You may be ever so
[25:30] sinful. Oh, once I was a
[25:34] sinner. Oh, nobody wants to agree to
[25:37] that. The Bible says we were born in
[25:39] sin, shaped in iniquity.
[25:43] You may be ever so sinful, but did you
[25:45] know he's interested in you becoming his
[25:47] subject?
[25:51] Sin knows no bounds. Sin can sin goes
[25:54] from I can name start naming it. So
[25:58] there's no limits to what he's saying
[26:00] here. You may be so
[26:02] sinful, but do you know he's interested
[26:04] in you becoming his subject? Hallelujah.
[26:06] Amen. Hallelujah.
[26:09] You say, "But I'm just an insignificant
[26:12] person."
[26:14] Amen. But you're not in the sight of
[26:17] God.
[26:19] Somebody say this. I am not
[26:22] insignificant
[26:23] in the sight of my God.
[26:26] Thank you, Lord. God wants you.
[26:30] Come on. You may have been rejected by
[26:32] people on this earth, people that didn't
[26:35] want you. People that rejected you, but
[26:37] God wants you. God wants you. Somebody
[26:41] needs to hear this. God wants you. Amen.
[26:47] He loves you. And God so loved you that
[26:50] when his love was projected, sovereign
[26:52] grace taken its place and sent a savior
[26:55] to redeem you back to himself.
[26:57] Hallelujah.
[26:59] You see, when he was wounded for your
[27:01] transgressions, because God loved you.
[27:03] God saw the afflictions of his people
[27:05] and with his stripes, you were healed.
[27:07] God's grace making a way for his love
[27:10] required it. Praise the Lord.
[27:14] Hallelujah.
[27:17] Amen. And sometimes you don't know why.
[27:20] You can't fathom how things have
[27:22] patterned out the way it is. But there's
[27:24] a God who's been watching over you. And
[27:26] he says, "This is my beloved son. I've
[27:29] been watching over you. I've been
[27:32] protecting you. In the moments when you
[27:34] saw one set of footprints in the sand,
[27:37] that wasn't your footprints, my son.
[27:40] That was my footprints. And I was
[27:42] carrying you through every trial,
[27:46] through every circumstance, through
[27:48] every situation. I was the one carrying
[27:51] you.
[27:55] So don't be despondent.
[27:58] Don't be depressed. Don't be in anxiety.
[28:01] The King of Kings, the one that stood
[28:03] there, Amen. There in the beginning and
[28:07] said, "Let there be." He's our father.
[28:13] And yet we walk around living this life
[28:15] thinking that nobody loves me. Nobody
[28:18] cares for me.
[28:21] Praise the Lord.
[28:23] Let's put up Exodus 23 there. Amen.
[28:26] Hallelujah. Do you know the Lord knows
[28:28] how to comfort us?
[28:32] And just today, you know, coming home
[28:33] and and pondering on the service and
[28:35] what to speak on and then the Lord
[28:38] brings me back to the commission and he
[28:41] says, "Never forget this."
[28:46] Amen.
[28:49] He says, "Behold, I send an angel before
[28:52] thee to keep thee in the
[28:55] way and to bring thee into the place
[28:58] which I have prepared."
[29:00] Now, I'm going to say the only prepared
[29:03] place for you and I is the what, brother
[29:07] Joshua? Is the
[29:11] shout. It's the only prepared place for
[29:15] us. People want to be in the voice then
[29:19] I say
[29:21] die because the voice is for the
[29:24] sleeping
[29:28] saints. We have a lot you know we have
[29:30] moved into dangerous times where you got
[29:33] to be careful what you hear.
[29:36] People are preaching it with such
[29:37] authority but you won't find a quote for
[29:41] it. Come on now. It's either we got a a
[29:44] prophet that we believe, a vindicated
[29:47] prophet and we don't unnecessarily read
[29:50] between
[29:53] lines and create things in there that
[29:56] you can't back up with quotes. And now
[29:59] call it revelation, light of the
[30:03] hour. He says, "Bring the So who's
[30:07] bringing us through this place?"
[30:08] Somebody tell me the angel.
[30:11] Do you know the prophet of God says in
[30:13] that message uh when he's preaching
[30:16] about Rebecca I forget the message maybe
[30:18] time of
[30:19] decision he's talking about Rebecca and
[30:21] he says the angel of the Lord hooed her
[30:24] to the
[30:27] waters he was drawing her to the
[30:30] waters.
[30:32] Amen. The angel of the Lord was leading
[30:34] her to the prepared place. Behold, I
[30:37] send you Eliza the prophet.
[30:45] Amen. Which I have prepared. So who is
[30:48] leading
[30:49] us? The angel of the Lord led them in
[30:52] the first
[30:54] Exodus. The angel of the Lord led Paul
[30:57] in the second exodus. Acts 27:23.
[31:01] For they stood by me this night an angel
[31:03] of God whose I am and whom I serve.
[31:11] And the prophet of God when going to the
[31:13] cave,
[31:16] he said, "I left $23 in my bank account
[31:20] and I went to the cave.
[31:23] And when I went there, he said, "Out of
[31:25] a ball of light came a man, a 200lb man
[31:29] stood there all of
[31:31] complexion." He said, "I have come from
[31:33] the presence of God to tell you your
[31:36] strange and misunderstood
[31:38] life." Amen. As Moses was given two
[31:42] signs, you shall be given two
[31:44] signs. But every
[31:47] generation has a chance at the word.
[31:51] I say that same
[31:53] angel didn't des didn't ascend back to
[31:56] heaven.
[31:58] That same angel is here on the earth
[32:00] right now. The prophet of God says the
[32:02] angel of the Lord is on earth right now
[32:04] fixing everything. He's fixing it.
[32:07] Things going wrong in your life, there's
[32:09] a fixer here.
[32:11] Amen. Call the fixer.
[32:14] So say, "The angel of the Lord is here."
[32:17] The angel of the Lord is here. Even when
[32:21] you don't see him, I can feel him in the
[32:22] atmosphere.
[32:24] The angel of the Lord is here. In the
[32:27] face of death, start to sing. The angel
[32:29] of the Lord is here. When your cupboards
[32:32] are running dry, sing the angel of the
[32:34] Lord is here. I can feel him in the
[32:38] atmosphere.
[32:40] The angel of the Lord is here.
[32:46] To the prepared place. Let's go. Amen.
[32:48] Hallelujah. Beware of
[32:51] him. He's not one to be played with. Oh,
[32:55] if you read the book of Joshua, you'll
[32:57] see this angel of the Lord was not one
[32:58] to be played with. He didn't have time
[33:01] for fancy words with Joshua.
[33:04] Amen. Joshua went pulled out. He said,
[33:06] "Are you for us or against us?" He says,
[33:09] "I am, Amen, the captain of the host,
[33:11] and I've come to set the battle in the
[33:13] ray." Joshua, you think you're leading
[33:15] the battle, but the angel of the Lord is
[33:17] going before you. Amen. Hallelujah.
[33:20] I love this. Provoke him not for he will
[33:23] not pardon your
[33:27] transgressions. For who's what is in
[33:30] him? My name is in him. Amen.
[33:36] My name is in him. Now pay attention to
[33:40] this. Back here it was God above us.
[33:46] So it was like a distant relationship.
[33:53] When Jesus was there, it was God with
[33:57] us. So the relationship came
[34:00] closer. But when he ascended on high, he
[34:04] sent back his own spirit.
[34:08] And he came in me. Somebody say in me.
[34:12] So which means this angel and I share
[34:16] the same name. Oh, come on.
[34:22] So which means in the third exodus he
[34:23] changed brother Joshua because of
[34:26] marriage
[34:28] now and I give you two two scenarios
[34:31] because two witnesses one because of
[34:35] marriage and one because of birth the
[34:39] son that's born through the marriage has
[34:42] the same name as the father but remains
[34:45] a servant until the appointed time
[34:51] then he has given the same rights as the
[34:54] father's name.
[34:56] Praise the Lord. So the angel that's
[34:59] here on the earth right now is carrying
[35:01] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[35:04] there's a people on the earth right now
[35:05] that's carrying the name in of the Lord
[35:07] Jesus Christ. And I say if two or more
[35:10] shall agree upon anything, if you and
[35:12] the angel of the Lord shall agree upon
[35:14] anything, oh come on somebody. If two or
[35:17] more shall agree upon anything touching
[35:19] anything, it shall be given.
[35:23] I say again, you are not alone. You walk
[35:25] into a situation, you walk, Amen. And I
[35:28] when I say situations, I'm not always
[35:30] meaning Amen. highlevel
[35:33] situations. Sometimes it could be an
[35:36] appliance. Sometimes it could be
[35:38] something in your home. Sometime it
[35:40] could be anything, any situation. It
[35:41] could be your car.
[35:45] Maybe a car got
[35:46] stolen. If you read Restoration of the
[35:49] Bright Tree, you'll see there prophet of
[35:51] God says, "We went on our knees and we
[35:53] called on the great enforcer to enforce
[35:55] a claim." Hallelujah. That vehicle
[35:57] belongs to this brother. Somebody
[36:00] illegally took his vehicle. We are
[36:02] commanding right now that that man
[36:04] returns a vehicle.
[36:09] That is enforcing a claim carrying the
[36:12] rights of the father's name.
[36:15] Next verse.
[36:17] Amen. If you shall indeed obey his voice
[36:19] and do all that I speak, then I will be
[36:22] an enemy unto thine
[36:25] enemies. There's fourth dimension. If
[36:28] you read the fourth seal there, you'll
[36:30] see what I'm talking about. Whole of
[36:32] hell is emptied out. But I will be an
[36:35] enemy to thine enemies and an adversary
[36:39] to thine
[36:40] adversaries. Praise the Lord.
[36:47] For mine angel shall go before thee, and
[36:50] bring
[36:51] thee unto the Amorites, Itites,
[36:54] Perizzites, Canaanites, Elites, and
[36:56] Jebusites, and all these filthy
[36:58] websites.
[37:03] I will cut them off.
[37:06] Amen. Why? My angel shall go before
[37:08] thee. I want you to put up there verse
[37:11] uh okay let's just leave it there let's
[37:14] just leave it there for now amen we'll
[37:16] get back there to that amen maybe if not
[37:18] today some other time but I was just
[37:21] trying to show you and position you and
[37:22] show you the angel that's leading us
[37:25] now he's the one that do you know when
[37:29] Jesus is saying ask anything in my
[37:32] name there's a group of people called
[37:34] the
[37:35] Pentecostals that ask using the name and
[37:39] they get the results using the
[37:43] name,
[37:46] right? Because at the name of Jesus,
[37:48] even demons tremble. Is that what the
[37:50] word of God says? Amen. At the name of
[37:54] Jesus, even demons tremble. Praise the
[37:57] Lord. Even this computer is trembling
[37:59] now. It's
[38:00] frozen. At the name of Jesus, demons
[38:03] tremble. But there's a class of people
[38:08] who are
[38:09] moving who have been under tutors and
[38:11] guides. Amen. Come to the adoption
[38:15] ceremony where the father's name when he
[38:18] now says they carry the authority of the
[38:21] father.
[38:25] Carrying the authority of the
[38:28] father. So a
[38:30] name means
[38:32] something right? When you go in the name
[38:36] of something, it carries authority. It
[38:38] carries power. A name has rights to
[38:42] unlock. Tell somebody, I sent
[38:44] you. Influence. A name has
[38:47] influence.
[38:48] Amen. But what we are talking about here
[38:51] carrying the father's name, ask anything
[38:54] in my name is
[38:56] different because you're now a
[39:00] son who is equal.
[39:04] When I say equal, an heir with
[39:11] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[39:14] You're an heir with Jesus. What day is
[39:17] this day? In that day, you shall ask me
[39:25] nothing. Hello. Who's speaking here?
[39:28] Somebody tell me. Jesus.
[39:31] What is Jesus saying? In that day, when
[39:34] sons come to their
[39:36] position, when sons come into authority,
[39:39] I'll put it in verse 23, that in that
[39:42] day you shall ask me
[39:45] nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[39:48] whatsoever you shall ask the Father in
[39:52] my
[39:54] name, he will give it you.
[39:59] Adam didn't ask in Jesus name.
[40:02] Peter and John going to the
[40:04] man gate beautiful such as I have give I
[40:09] unto
[40:11] thee. They spoke with the authority in
[40:13] the first person but God is moving us. I
[40:17] am saying a chosen generation and each
[40:20] generation has a chance at the word.
[40:24] Adam is
[40:26] what prefall is what we are headed to
[40:29] right now. The prophet of God is telling
[40:33] us that Abraham had a name
[40:39] change and he says he took Abraham and
[40:43] he gave him a part of his own name and
[40:46] he said he adopted him.
[40:49] Amen.
[40:51] God adopted Abraham by giving him a part
[40:54] of his own
[40:55] name. He took part of the name of Elohim
[40:59] and he put it in to Abram and made the
[41:01] name
[41:04] Abraham. So as God adopted Abraham, he
[41:08] says then he comes
[41:11] now for the time of life in Genesis 18.
[41:16] Amen.
[41:18] So, and he's trying to type that now.
[41:20] The adoption comes before the promised
[41:22] son comes back to the earth to take them
[41:25] away. Amen. The point I'm also trying to
[41:28] make is show you that we have had a name
[41:30] change as well.
[41:35] Amen. We we've got to we've got to come
[41:38] to maturity, church.
[41:41] Amen. And I'm going to say this again.
[41:45] The revelation of the word was not open
[41:47] to us for nothing. It is by the
[41:50] revelation of the word that we are
[41:51] overcoming this age.
[41:54] Seven seals, seven church ages, seven
[41:57] trumpets, seven vials were not opened up
[42:00] to us for us to think it is
[42:04] boring for us to think we don't know the
[42:07] don't need to know those things. Some of
[42:09] us only want us to preach to their
[42:11] mustard seed faith.
[42:15] because we want to meet daily needs. We
[42:18] are not interested in those things.
[42:22] Jesus to bring a point across told the
[42:25] people even if you have the faith of a
[42:27] mustard seed you can ask what you will
[42:31] but in this
[42:33] age we need perfect faith.
[42:39] We need perfect faith in this age. And
[42:42] what will give us perfect faith in this
[42:43] age is the opening of them seven seals.
[42:47] Is the opening of the word.
[42:50] Do you know there's no rapture without
[42:52] those things?
[42:54] Without the opening of the word to give
[42:58] us rapturing faith. The opening of the
[43:01] word was sent to give us rapturing
[43:03] faith.
[43:08] So as a church, as a people, we need to
[43:12] understand those deeper
[43:13] things. We need to understand the
[43:17] revelation of
[43:18] God because that's what makes her
[43:21] invincible. He says when she knows who
[43:23] she is, what she stands for, that she
[43:27] can do the greater works, he says Satan
[43:30] will be powerless before her. The word
[43:33] that came forth was to establish sons
[43:36] and daughters of God. Position them.
[43:38] They can stand firm. Nothing will move
[43:41] them.
[43:43] Amen.
[43:45] Sickness or no sickness, nothing will
[43:46] move them. They are immovable.
[43:54] I also don't want to candy coat the
[43:55] gospel
[43:58] because Edith's right did not get
[44:00] healed. But that's what I'm saying.
[44:02] Immovable faith. Though he slay me, yet
[44:06] I will trust him.
[44:10] In every situation, in every trial,
[44:14] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[44:18] Why?
[44:20] You know, all of us want the power of
[44:22] God. How many of you want to be like
[44:24] Jesus?
[44:28] All of us want to
[44:31] operate greater works than these shall
[44:33] he do. All of us want to operate the
[44:36] power, the greater works. He said, in
[44:39] order to match the
[44:41] power, you've got to match the
[44:46] surrender. Direct words to me. In order
[44:49] to match the power, the greater works,
[44:52] you've got to match Jesus surrender.
[44:57] Without that we are flapping our wings
[45:00] trying to gain some ground
[45:03] here trying to produce something with no
[45:08] surrender. Jesus had a prayer
[45:11] life. Jesus had alone time with
[45:14] God. Jesus went morning, noon, and
[45:17] evening.
[45:21] You see, we all want the great
[45:23] things, but we can't have the power
[45:27] without matching the
[45:30] surrender. Willingly lay down his life.
[45:34] Took the wrong. Jesus said, "Somebody
[45:36] slapped you on this cheek. Why don't you
[45:38] turn the other cheek?" We forget all of
[45:39] those
[45:42] things. We just want to give people a
[45:44] mouthful.
[45:46] But Jesus said, "Why don't you rather
[45:48] take the
[45:50] wrong?" Jesus said, "If your brother's
[45:52] offended, why don't you go and apologize
[45:54] to him? Why don't you rather take the
[45:56] wrong so that your brother can be
[45:58] reconciled to the
[46:01] faith?"
[46:03] Amen. I thought we love all the word of
[46:07] God. Don't we love all the word of God?
[46:10] So I am saying maybe it's not a word for
[46:12] you but the Holy Spirit told me this to
[46:15] match the greater works you've got to
[46:17] match the surrender
[46:20] without that and that's where we coming
[46:22] to St. John 5:19 the son can do nothing
[46:26] except what the father
[46:28] showeth. Amen. That which the father
[46:31] showeth the son does likewise. You were
[46:33] chosen for this time this season.
[46:38] You are a chosen
[46:40] generation. 1 Peter 2:9 says, "But you
[46:44] are a chosen generation."
[46:46] The prophet of God is saying every
[46:48] generation has a chance at the
[46:53] word, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[46:58] a peculiar people that you should show
[47:00] forth the praises of him who had called
[47:03] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[47:08] light. What a light we have. He says in
[47:11] the midst of gross darkness there will
[47:14] come a
[47:15] light.
[47:17] Amen. It's neither day nor night but at
[47:20] the evening time it shall be light. It
[47:24] shall be evening. It shall be light in
[47:26] the evening time. The path to glory you
[47:29] will surely
[47:31] find. I say again as a
[47:36] church, can we consecrate ourselves
[47:38] again?
[47:43] Amen. We now in
[47:46] May, we made a petition to the church.
[47:49] Start reading your
[47:51] Bible.
[47:53] Amen. If you had, if you were consistent
[47:57] with that, reading it every day, you
[47:59] would be reading 33% of the Bible
[48:03] already. That's according to my app. 33%
[48:06] of the Bible daily consistent reading.
[48:11] Amen. I can't pray for you to have a
[48:14] closer walk with the
[48:15] Lord. If you want to have a closer walk
[48:18] with the Lord, it's up to
[48:19] you. I can't pray for you to have a
[48:21] consecrated
[48:23] life. I can't pray. I can't pray for
[48:26] you, Lord, make time for him to pray.
[48:28] You've got to make time to pray. You've
[48:30] got to make time for
[48:33] surrender. Amen.
[48:36] So if we are awake for 16 hours, maybe
[48:39] 20 hours, I don't know how long you're
[48:40] awake in a day, how much of that time
[48:43] are you allocating for the things of God
[48:46] for the purpose of God? Every day. And
[48:49] and be honest, if all you have is 15
[48:51] minutes, you know what? The Lord will
[48:54] take that 15
[48:58] minutes. He'll take that 15 minutes.
[49:03] But when you gain capacity to extend
[49:05] your borders, he'll also take that half
[49:07] an
[49:08] hour. Isn't there a song called Sweet
[49:11] Hour of Prayer? Sweet Hour of Prayer. I
[49:17] know it's hard. Sometimes you're
[49:19] praying, you check the clock, you
[49:21] thought you prayed for one hour,
[49:23] meanwhile, you only prayed for five
[49:24] minutes.
[49:27] Do you know the what the Bible says in
[49:30] Romans 8 that the Holy Ghost starts to
[49:33] pray when we don't know what to
[49:36] say. But we got to stay there. Now he
[49:40] says now the Holy Ghost with groaning
[49:42] starts to pray and makes intercessions
[49:44] on our behalf when we don't have the
[49:48] words. You see these experiences are
[49:51] lacking in the church.
[49:54] For example, if we called for a prayer
[49:56] meeting, how many people would come?
[49:58] You'll find maybe five people coming.
[50:01] Call for a prayer meeting, call for
[50:03] Bible class, call for something around
[50:06] the things of God. I am saying that
[50:09] those things are not coming without a
[50:11] surrender. No
[50:13] way. You know what the prophet of God
[50:16] says? He says if God did something a
[50:18] certain way, he's got to do it the same
[50:20] way every single time. Don't tell me
[50:23] God's going to come and pour out his
[50:25] power on a message church that's just
[50:26] lukewarm and cold and formal. Just come
[50:28] to church on a Sunday. Come to church
[50:30] when they feel like have no value.
[50:32] Disrespect every office. Disrespect
[50:34] everything principle.
[50:36] Every every conduct. People are just
[50:40] forgetting about it. Order and doctrine,
[50:42] dressing, all those things that were
[50:44] supposed to be our foundational truths.
[50:46] People are just disregarding it.
[50:47] Thinking we are bygone that now the
[50:49] elders have gone. These young ones don't
[50:51] care. God cares. And what did the Bible
[50:55] what would it read? God will watch over
[50:56] his word.
[51:00] So who's going to give life to conduct?
[51:02] You and I. Who's going to give life to
[51:04] order? You and I. Who's going to give
[51:06] life to doctrine? You and I.
