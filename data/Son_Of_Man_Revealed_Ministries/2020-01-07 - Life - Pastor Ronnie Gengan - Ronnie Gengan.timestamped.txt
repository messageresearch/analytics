[1:20] numbers are spiking every day and
[1:24] they're still advising people to stay it
[1:26] open where your boss and always think so
[1:29] as far as possible you don't want to be
[1:32] doing the curbs out there it's gonna get
[1:35] worse because you know the taxi this we
[1:37] all going full swing you find the loss
[1:41] so people that are infected that spread
[1:47] it around so it's a it's a very trying
[1:51] time we are living it right along the
[1:53] world also today the first of July the
[1:58] mentioned Israel is going to take parts
[2:00] of the West Bank under their control and
[2:04] there's gonna be a lot of protests with
[2:08] the Palestinians already they're
[2:09] starting firing rockets into the
[2:10] Mediterranean Sea and things like that
[2:13] so they're still calling for the
[2:15] destruction of Israel right so we know
[2:19] what the Lord told us to watch for the
[2:23] victory amen we know the gospel is going
[2:27] back to the Jews already right
[2:29] and God is got a hundred and forty-four
[2:32] thousand a thank you you will take care
[2:35] of
[2:35] so we're just gonna go through a little
[2:38] excitation in the book of Genesis also
[2:50] like to once again wish discover happy

[2:56] she's a very generous sister with the
[3:00] family very accommodating and they like

[3:13] Robert Genesis chapter 2 we're going to
[3:17] speak on getting to life life here how
[3:21] we can have life if we stay with God's
[3:23] Word if you still God's Word we live
[3:27] life see and speed of light and unbelief
[3:33] unbelief will bring death and
[3:37] destruction right get assist up to -
[3:42] really from verse 15 and the Lord God
[3:46] took the man and put him in the Garden
[3:49] of Eden to dress it and to keep it and
[3:51] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[3:54] every tree of the garden thou mayst eat
[3:59] freely freely eat but of the tree of the
[4:04] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[4:07] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[4:11] eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
[4:16] praise Allah
[4:18] so the day they eat of the tree then to
[4:21] the guy we went to Genesis chapter 3
[4:27] verse 1 now the serpent was more subtle
[4:31] than any beast of the field which the
[4:33] Lord God had made and he said unto the
[4:35] woman yay and God said you shall not eat
[4:38] of every tree of the garden and the
[4:41] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[4:44] of the fruit of the trees of the garden
[4:46] but of the fruit
[4:48] the tree which is in the midst of the
[4:51] garden God and said you shall not eat of
[4:54] it neither shall you touch it lest you
[4:57] die and the serpent said unto the woman
[5:00] ye shall not surely die for God doth
[5:05] know that in the day you eat thereof
[5:08] then your eyes shall be hoping and you
[5:11] shall be as God's knowing good and evil
[5:15] let's pray you have any Beechnut to just
[5:20] raise your hand Lord Jesus thank you
[5:23] Lord even as we came this evening long
[5:25] songs that have been sung to praise you
[5:28] and give it gonna Rob the prayers that
[5:31] went forth and all the exhortation and a
[5:34] proof single day we give you praise
[5:36] tonight Roy thank you rob we can be
[5:39] standing here a few of us back in this
[5:42] country Lord with our country and the
[5:46] whole world is it a penny
[5:48] lots of people like hospitals a lot of
[5:52] people are in quarantine and Lord lot of
[5:56] people have died and Lord the fear is
[6:00] still gripping the hearts of the people
[6:01] and although we have great scientists in
[6:05] the world people that are learning that
[6:09] study but not there's not one single
[6:12] thing they can do at the moment a lot
[6:16] therefore our fight will only bested me
[6:19] we are trusting you Lord that you'll
[6:21] make a way for us keep us by your grace
[6:23] Lord each and every one of us
[6:25] you see our hearts you see our requests
[6:27] will make a way for us and Lord in at
[6:30] this present world you're already to be
[6:32] caught about as it was in the days of
[6:34] Solomon and Lord it's a shame to mention
[6:38] things that are being done in this world
[6:39] today God is pathetic the condition of
[6:43] the people had way to look or what we
[6:46] just kind feel calm and do what you said
[6:49] you'll do again we pray that you bless
[6:51] over 200 hot slob and baby think
[6:54] understanding lorded and know what your
[6:56] one is telling us that we may not come
[6:59] short
[6:59] but find grace in your eyes Lord bless
[7:02] us tonight given as you come at me ask
[7:04] it all in Jesus precious and never
[7:06] failing name amen
[7:08] please let me be seated so blocked all
[7:15] that but then you heat up the tree
[7:17] you're gonna die and the separate set
[7:20] you'll not die how do you believe then
[7:25] Adam and Eve and by the grace of the
[7:28] Lord we go to him and one day are we
[7:30] going to see anybody amen
[7:33] how many of you believe never see them
[7:35] but God's are they gonna die and they
[7:40] did what God told him not to do how are
[7:44] you gonna see them he did anybody got
[7:47] upset so God said you bet that so he
[7:55] never means that they're gonna die
[7:56] straight front of them physically fall
[7:58] down and die right the death is
[8:01] separation from God
[8:02] they'll be separated from God that's
[8:05] what he meant the day that you eat
[8:07] thereof will be separated but what God
[8:11] did by His grace and mercy need to be
[8:15] him go cause I'm concerned he wouldn't
[8:18] have slain and anymore must have been a
[8:21] man or something and make clothing for
[8:24] them he was still concerned although
[8:29] they disobeyed it so to get that animal
[8:32] skin there was a nice day to the dog so
[8:38] god straightaway native atonement and
[8:43] also after he brought the cases upon
[8:46] death and he told him the seed of the
[8:50] woman he sees spoke about the seed of
[8:53] the woman to come which is Jesus Christ
[8:57] praise the Lord light day the Garden of
[9:00] Eden right there when they disobeyed God
[9:03] he spoke about the seed of the one what
[9:05] is the will come and do he is going to
[9:08] be the reality of them
[9:09] aim
[9:10] and mentioning his own blood so no no
[9:14] God said they you know they couldn't tie
[9:17] and you know we friend God also eat you
[9:23] that he wanted this to happen
[9:27] like God wanted this to happen so
[9:30] knowing that we put them on a free moral
[9:33] agency they must make a choice
[9:36] see so we find that's why Satan couldn't
[9:41] come to to help
[9:42] he was always on creation I became too
[9:46] he was taken out of an editor
[9:49] but and he take them through he the
[9:54] woman right and this devil you already
[10:00] what God told it because I mean said oh
[10:03] we we must not eat of all the trees and
[10:05] don't eat of all the trees but what we
[10:07] don't eat
[10:08] he said you shall not die what is it you
[10:11] put one word Amen and that brought chaos
[10:16] destruction amen
[10:19] did cursing and it was guessed that you
[10:24] you work by the sweat of his brow to
[10:28] endure living and also the woman will
[10:33] bring for child in sorrow there will be
[10:37] a painful experience see all because of
[10:41] disobedience amen see so when when
[10:46] people disobey God right that is
[10:50] unbelief the Prophet tells us that is
[10:54] the biggest sin unbelief amen
[10:56] so what he said I believe not believing
[10:59] the Word of God is unbelief right so God
[11:04] God didn't make a total death but God
[11:08] continued the wrong and he still gave
[11:11] his word
[11:12] he still established his word when he
[11:16] brought Israel the children of Israel
[11:18] out of Egypt he still established it
[11:21] world
[11:22] gave them a covenant getting the
[11:24] commandments in that you must keep this
[11:27] one a matter if you don't keep this way
[11:31] you're going to be destroyed
[11:33] amen so God always kept his word see
[11:37] it's a word that the people must feel
[11:38] amen
[11:39] and if they don't keep that word like
[11:42] that is how belief not really believing
[11:46] the word like in our day now if they
[11:49] don't really keep the word the revealed
[11:51] word for our day that came by the hoping
[11:54] of the word and the restoration of
[11:56] baptism and got it and many other things
[12:00] marriage and divorce if they don't keep
[12:02] that and go against at work that's
[12:04] unbelief amen
[12:06] see they can be Christians that can be
[12:09] great to chirp so you can do all these
[12:10] things but because of unbelief
[12:12] God is gonna deal with them see when it
[12:17] comes to his word but on play Amen see
[12:21] God buddy when they say something is
[12:24] very serious
[12:25] amen people must keep that word see we
[12:29] don't meet people now they they take the
[12:31] Word of God lightly amen and you tell
[12:35] them sure of the scriptures baptism
[12:38] Godhead and elegent divorce and serpent
[12:41] seed and oldest thing now in order
[12:43] believe whether the same and the other
[12:49] says in the book of Revelation there at
[12:51] 22 if you add one word or take one word
[12:54] the name is gonna be thinking about a
[12:55] man they know that see so it's a it's a
[13:01] very serious situation let's go to
[13:05] Deuteronomy chapter 30 we just confirmed
[13:12] it that God is keeping his word if I we
[13:18] can come to church we can say we believe
[13:22] God we can save me in the message and we
[13:28] don't keep the world it doesn't mean
[13:30] much hey but keeping that word
[13:35] important amen see living before the
[13:40] Lord even as God set the limit I know
[13:43] that you you you come out this house
[13:45] well if daddy shouldn't it be
[13:48] destructive see so just to confirm Mia
[13:53] Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 15 so
[13:58] God is telling the children of Israel
[13:59] yeah they came out now and then we're
[14:02] going to go possess the land and then
[14:05] and God went to them for himself this
[14:09] nation you know for his Americans and he
[14:12] wanted them to keep the word amen see
[14:15] all he's asking them to keep the word
[14:16] and acknowledge him he says don't go to
[14:20] these other gods simply gods of the
[14:23] people of the way and why you're gonna
[14:26] take over but just keep my word and
[14:30] knowledge me that's what he's asking see
[14:33] and then he says look what it says to
[14:37] them to their army Thank You verse 15
[14:41] see okay I need a little bit up to get
[14:46] for you to pick up what is happening for
[14:56] this commandment which I command you
[14:58] this day is it not hidden from thee
[15:01] neither is it far off it is not in
[15:05] heaven that perhaps for the same we
[15:07] shall go up for us to heaven and bring
[15:09] it to us that we maintain it and do it
[15:11] neither is it beyond the sea and Bowsher
[15:15] to say one shall go over the sea for us
[15:17] and bring it unto us that we may get it
[15:20] he said he says you don't have to go
[15:22] searching and looking for the word I'm
[15:23] giving it to you amen
[15:24] right but the word is very near thee say
[15:30] in the mouth in the heart the Dharma is
[15:33] do it amen whatever you do it the world
[15:38] is in your heart the word is in Arma we
[15:43] must do it pay zero even
[15:48] but the word is very near up to me in my
[15:52] mouth in da Gama's do see I've sent me
[15:57] for me this day life and good amen
[16:01] death and evil exactly what he told Adam
[16:06] and he did the day you need to go to die
[16:09] I'm giving you my way if you're not
[16:12] gonna keep it dead an evil amen
[16:16] verse six in this I command thee this
[16:19] day to love thy God amen
[16:23] to walk in his ways and to keep his
[16:26] Commandments and statutes and his
[16:30] judgments that there is love and
[16:33] multiply and that God is only good you
[16:38] know good for them amen
[16:39] you want to bless bless them amen
[16:43] and the Lord our God shall bless thee in
[16:47] the land where the God goes to possess
[16:48] it justice
[16:51] just acknowledge me keep my word I'm
[16:53] gonna bless you I'm good
[16:56] it'll prosper in the sled what it does
[17:03] not turn away huh so people they don't
[17:08] want to keep the word if your heart turn
[17:11] away even friends it's time that we took
[17:15] the Word of God
[17:17] serious amen see when we come and stand
[17:21] in the chat will this will be too late
[17:24] like we're speaking to her brother and
[17:26] we were showing in the scriptures a
[17:29] marriage of the wash took you through
[17:32] the Word of God took it through the
[17:34] quotes in spite of that you still wanna
[17:38] go do wrong it's part of knowing the way
[17:45] see
[17:47] but he's got not turn away so he's hot
[17:50] turned away from from the world so
[17:56] people have can turn away from the world
[18:00] meet other people about their the world
[18:03] of work today
[18:04] and how they must connect themselves as
[18:06] Christians and everything the heart
[18:08] turns away from the world and they will
[18:12] still tell you I'll give you to
[18:13] understand how my Christian I said God
[18:18] and I wish you bought it
[18:20] see but if I not turn away so the doubt
[18:25] will not get maybe some people don't yet
[18:30] amen don't speak to us it's messy you
[18:33] know yo y'all want to believe it you go
[18:35] believe it leave us alone me okay and
[18:40] that will stand in the judgment against
[18:42] them but if they're not in a way so that
[18:47] thou shalt but yet but shall be blown
[18:50] away and worship other gods and serve
[18:53] them and denounce up to you this day
[18:55] that we shall surely perish and the tree
[18:59] shall not prolong your days upon the
[19:01] land whether the parcel of a Jordan to
[19:05] go to possess it look at this time I
[19:08] call heaven and earth to record this day
[19:11] against you that I have set before you
[19:14] life and death amen
[19:18] I'm calling every to witness I'm sitting
[19:23] before you life and death blessings and
[19:29] cursings
[19:30] therefore choose life amen amen
[19:34] choose life that broke down and I see
[19:39] may live man choose life and I was that
[19:45] by keeping the world
[19:47] amen amen nothing nothing either that
[19:50] that disc eating the world what's in
[19:54] them cakes Jesus there
[19:56] and also demonic treatment buddy what do
[19:59] you want not keep the world but Jesus
[20:03] those three times holy Satan it is
[20:05] returned hey man it is returned it is
[20:09] Richard price alone so we must have why
[20:13] the word - Amen if we are confronted
[20:16] with something or whatever situation
[20:18] find the one and say it is written
[20:20] hey man if we can stay like that it is
[20:23] written this is where I want to stay say
[20:27] so remember you must choose between life
[20:30] and death
[20:31] amen and God is giving the people at
[20:34] church today just get into my chance I'm
[20:41] giving you the word you have a choice so
[20:45] in that way God is not going to be a
[20:47] beauty I'm giving you my word
[20:50] you make a choice amen see the promises
[20:54] God don't send anybody to help
[20:56] they send themselves praise the Lord
[21:00] agreement so that's why he even though
[21:04] he'll believes brought death and
[21:06] destruction and sorrow she humbly dead
[21:12] destruction sorrow to the human race but
[21:17] thank God there was a second added so we
[21:22] say but we asked him if anybody was
[21:24] going to be there that's gonna be very
[21:27] very unfair because he had a very
[21:32] something really take with the worship
[21:35] of God and one except Abel Abel came
[21:40] with his burnt offering and Gora Gora
[21:42] accepted it so who told him that Xiaomi
[21:48] had an asset or me what happened now he
[21:54] was laying he was led to do the right
[21:56] thing and take note you can read that in
[21:58] the Bible when God put the curse he said
[22:00] by the sweat of your brow we shall kill
[22:02] them and it's gonna bring forth thistles
[22:06] and thorns and everything
[22:08] he's gonna have a hard time but you find
[22:12] when Adam and Eve is when Cain and Abel
[22:14] is born who does the telling of the
[22:17] ground Cain and Abel is a keeper of
[22:21] sheep varies a lot so he was looking
[22:27] after sheep over there and that wasn't
[22:31] he said 12 ton brother past is there the
[22:36] Greenglass the waters and he was just
[22:39] looking up the sheep but Cain was
[22:41] tilling the ground see how the cascada
[22:46] fell onto Cain so Abel had him told him
[22:52] about you know what the original sin was
[22:56] and some light was revealed to him he
[23:00] must take a lemon slate Freddy's alone
[23:04] and God had respect unto that so God is
[23:06] going to accept Abel right if you go to
[23:11] book of Hebrews by faith Abel offered
[23:15] that regarded more excellent sacrifice
[23:18] but now nothing's mentioned about Adam
[23:22] knowing he was mentioned about enemy see
[23:27] when he talks about Cain and Abel saying
[23:32] sacrifice God rejected he was gone
[23:36] accepted prays a lot so I believe
[23:42] they're gonna be there because God made
[23:43] an atonement in the way the Prophet
[23:46] described it he says God took that skin
[23:51] and read them and he and he had them
[23:54] going out of the garden those skins
[23:56] flattening as they walked to be good
[23:59] blood but something's too bloody you put
[24:04] the buddies think about them because
[24:06] they make the whole cavalry and what the
[24:08] Prophet said the covering is religion
[24:10] today people wanna put the whole
[24:13] covering see God is giving us the word
[24:18] amen
[24:19] and when the word that the bride will be
[24:21] blessed he plays a lot he's given us a
[24:26] word to be dressed it we can't be
[24:28] pressed to the Word of God see
[24:31] so let's go three places the sea so I
[24:34] was looking up there and a lot of people
[24:38] are saying it is not living anywhere
[24:40] that where they can enable will be sorry
[24:43] anybody will be you know I'll be
[24:45] revealing I mean the first letters the
[24:52] first two people are left and brought
[24:54] life upon the earth
[24:56] so God maybe atonement see now let's see
[25:06] so if God said that anyone's going to
[25:12] die now I mean how many of you know how
[25:16] many years ever lived
[25:18] anybody here how many years in animal oh
[25:24] nine eleven thirty years but God said
[25:30] you shall die but he virtually lived a
[25:34] full life 930 years right and he's a
[25:43] great great grandson Ben tolosa he lived
[25:48] for I think 969 years but another
[25:55] descendent from there lived also for
[25:57] over 900 years see there never died
[26:02] instantly
[26:04] see but God ended the torment for him
[26:07] amen see and they they are the first
[26:10] ones I believe we're definitely going to
[26:14] see them and God after all he he wanted
[26:18] them to for well because a promise
[26:22] anyone assurance attributes see what all
[26:26] this display so I bet you that never
[26:29] happened so
[26:30] to display this means that we tried to
[26:35] separate here was the most subtle of all
[26:38] the beasts of the field but he was
[26:42] kicked out from him because the first
[26:45] one was country dilemma so you can
[26:49] imagine before Ben was created the was
[26:52] started in heaven and this Lucifer was a
[26:58] very beautiful created beautiful looking
[27:06] and you were so powerful he was able to
[27:11] include two-thirds of the angels to come
[27:15] on inside
[27:18] see it was a fight what happened he was
[27:21] kicked out enough so ever since then he
[27:24] was looking to come against God's plane
[27:30] he thought he was coming against God's
[27:32] plan but it was working one cosplay
[27:36] because God allowed it say so we find
[27:40] those two seats the serpent seed right
[27:46] so you look in the genealogy if you look
[27:51] it comes right up and stop by sin
[27:57] bypasses Kate goes to they two-headed
[28:02] see Adam said okay he's left up so Kang
[28:09] wise father hid him he's supposed to be
[28:12] there also then should be there
[28:15] amen so he was the one includes him amen
[28:22] he was a was bringing unbelief so are
[28:27] the people not believing today goddess
[28:31] send them a strong delusion then believe
[28:35] a lie
[28:37] the Bible says that
[28:40] amen they'll depart from the truth and
[28:48] they'll bleed everything else for the
[28:51] will of God
[28:53] okay so Ramona once unbelief sets in but
[28:59] so that's why God start drawing the line
[29:03] people know how to believe he's given
[29:06] them the way they got a hunter slate
[29:12] nobody could come and say I don't know
[29:15] God probably gave the word amen
[29:20] I read it from Revelation 12:9 okay this
[29:26] is one of the other translation that
[29:29] thinks amplified translation revelation
[29:34] 12:9
[29:34] and the huge dragon was cast down that
[29:39] whole serpent who is called the devil
[29:43] and Satan e e o is the seducer the
[29:52] deceiver of all humanity the world over
[29:57] he was forced out and cast down to earth
[30:01] and his angels were flung out along the
[30:07] sea to tens of the angels the deceiver
[30:12] the seducer
[30:14] so you thinking other people are
[30:17] adorably but they are they are
[30:18] influenced by the devil not to believe
[30:22] see because he came to say to the said
[30:25] you know if that be the Son of God and
[30:27] you can do better codes you can do this
[30:29] ever
[30:29] why should be a no see so that's what
[30:33] this devil has got the people it's given
[30:36] them all these things that is offer them
[30:40] things which the LORD refused okay the
[30:46] message gives and colleagues are without
[30:47] repentance he says here the gift itself
[30:52] doesn't do
[30:53] there's no way for anybody to ever have
[30:56] anything from God except by faith
[30:59] amen see to accept anything from God it
[31:04] must be by faith God has made that is
[31:10] way that was from the beginning for the
[31:14] people to believe God by faith that was
[31:20] given to Adam and Eve to believe God's
[31:22] Word and when Eve disbelieved God's Word
[31:26] then he brought death sorrow sickness
[31:30] seemed to disbelieve God Amen you would
[31:35] be now to disbelieve God see so he would
[31:41] be you must be very careful you might
[31:45] eat now but how am I gonna displease God
[31:48] well as young young people youngsters
[31:52] yeah male and female you might need a
[31:55] partner
[31:56] they're going to take you away from the
[31:58] world are you going to stay with a word
[32:02] and believe the word are you going to
[32:05] disbelieve the word and go with an
[32:09] unbelieving partner it's happened a lot
[32:13] of places see so you have to stay with
[32:18] the word and blink God's Word are you
[32:21] going to discipline works with right
[32:29] right so they're a brand staggered not
[32:33] at the promise of go through and believe
[32:38] that he grew stronger amen no unbelief
[32:42] is gonna move a grin the father of faith
[32:49] Craig's a lot thank God that his face
[32:51] was slide then we can be the children of
[32:54] Abraham through Jesus Christ amen amen
[33:01] okay in the message at thy word now only
[33:06] thing you can ever get from God is my
[33:08] fake amen so we got em tremendous faith
[33:15] if you want anything from God
[33:18] you know you'll only get it by faith
[33:23] amen now many of us take now okay what I
[33:28] want is a good faith I'm going to pray
[33:30] just work great no look this is what I
[33:33] need this is what we do for me
[33:35] no you must be that's a Vienna doll so
[33:40] what about that with a woman that came
[33:42] to the king
[33:44] she bested him amen he sent you away but
[33:50] she came every time then he said himself
[33:53] listen yet she's troubling me give her
[33:55] what you want let it go you gotta be
[33:59] persistent she wants something from God
[34:02] really mean business
[34:04] amen be persistent and then I will not
[34:10] leave you till you bless me oh who said
[34:14] that take her I will not sleep alone
[34:20] get me to a wrestle rule alone thank you
[34:25] I simply get into a rest of the road
[34:27] Amen lord I need this law please I won't
[34:30] leave I would and I'm going to believe
[34:32] I'm going to trust you hmm amen praise
[34:37] the Lord not going to come easy so only
[34:44] thing you can ever get from bodies by
[34:45] faith and the reason that I say that
[34:50] they will be turbid here or either coat
[34:55] what's wrong with in and told the reason
[34:59] why they can't be is because I believe
[35:02] what he told me is a truth so I talked
[35:06] to my discernment now that people come
[35:07] right and for these years he stood by me
[35:12] and I know he will
[35:14] now it's because I believe it just
[35:18] believe it just with all my heart and
[35:22] soul and body and mind and you believe
[35:26] that and then if your number is called
[35:30] tonight in the prayer line and if God
[35:33] reveals your heart and speak to you and
[35:36] give you totals here don't you never
[35:40] have any kind of testimony only that he
[35:43] healed you because if you do if you one
[35:48] can testify to the other side that
[35:52] negative side he'll come back to you
[35:56] worse then it was it was so let me say
[36:01] you God said something and having
[36:04] pronounced you an ear or something
[36:06] don't be negative about it be positive
[36:10] about amen
[36:11] see if you don't be positive then even
[36:14] telling us see so God said something
[36:18] believe it and press on hold on to that
[36:22] word amen
[36:25] just remember if he can't accept it from
[36:28] those bases don't come at home in that
[36:31] seat to the plane ride don't come at
[36:34] home see cause it would be embarrassing
[36:38] yeah before the audience any RV and you
[36:42] have to be told them and so don't come
[36:45] at home look what I said if you're going
[36:48] to be negative about what God is going
[36:50] to tell you don't cut it off
[36:51] amen and if you get a doubt at all you
[36:54] waste your time gonna work against you
[36:57] so what I say if God is going to tell us
[37:01] something and tell us it won't be
[37:03] positive about Amen keep that word cp+
[37:10] see because the Bible said go and sin no
[37:13] more
[37:14] the worst people come up on you now sin
[37:18] is unbelief see the first sin was
[37:21] committed by him because she disappeared
[37:24] God's Word that's where the whole thing
[37:27] weighs tonight
[37:28] disbelieving gods would see you believe
[37:32] God's Word as it is written yeah you
[37:35] don't need nothing else plays a lot
[37:38] don't disbelieve God's Word we leave
[37:40] nothing else
[37:41] amen see that God's Word is not a man's
[37:45] word to remain even out and rising and
[37:49] trying to say well you cannot listen to
[37:51] me you're going to believe what we
[37:54] believe then you're going to make it
[37:58] no it's God's Word amen
[38:04] see so I said bleep God's Word and
[38:10] nothing else our ancestors by the time
[38:16] we are living in
[38:17] how many people have defected and went
[38:23] to the tulips Kiki come on up how did
[38:28] people believe this machine and walked
[38:30] for a while then the 2 loxp she gave all
[38:36] the scriptures were there you know all
[38:42] day in church acres Christ a mystery of
[38:45] God reveal Christ is the mystery of God
[38:50] revealed but now we can now go and say
[38:54] now we believe in two logs and the
[38:58] proverb reaches every time he changed
[39:01] his mask he took on a body of flesh and
[39:06] he came amen
[39:12] so before before he can even visit the
[39:15] library Help listening so are these two
[39:22] lots
[39:24] see the the left teaching now unbelief
[39:28] setting why because of a man and then
[39:33] came to influence them and stopped it
[39:37] and they left it whipped but I want to
[39:42] say if you don't believe this never seen
[39:44] you would stay with the words you're not
[39:47] gonna run with the crowd a man so the
[39:52] British never see will finally be a
[39:55] small group of people that were really
[39:57] stable the word and and regard some real
[39:59] faithful ones around the world and
[40:02] really staying with a true message of
[40:04] God see and then you got all over the
[40:09] world people are saying this and saying
[40:11] nothing and running year running their
[40:13] dream over but the true bride is
[40:15] predestinated she's not good either the
[40:20] unbelief people take it you know so
[40:27] likely to leave the word and we'll do
[40:29] something God's one that's why I said
[40:36] man shall not live by bread alone but
[40:40] every word that God sends a man see so I
[40:46] tell you what we we can't stay with this
[40:49] work that we are nothing much say to
[40:54] stay with the word is what net is so
[40:59] constant word is nothing much okay
[41:10] the message Redemption by judgment now
[41:17] God when he loved adamant he so much
[41:20] that the intersession blood the judgment
[41:24] was dead and he had to do something
[41:30] something had to die in the stead and
[41:33] then they could stand there in his
[41:36] presence now if there was judgment he
[41:42] first listened to sent him and he
[41:46] whitewashed the word over
[41:49] so what degree they are whitewashing the
[41:52] went over same thing and the discipline
[41:57] oil and the word then became God's
[42:01] judgment amen the world became God's
[42:06] judgment not this word the Word of God
[42:10] will judge every person in this world
[42:15] that's been preached yeah this morning
[42:16] his big preach Tonya at the Wall Street
[42:20] preached over there at Christian Church
[42:22] down to the Brisbin championship
[42:25] wherever the word is be preached it
[42:27] becomes the judgment men are judged by
[42:32] the world and here is one good thing you
[42:35] know either of judgment goes before us
[42:39] or it'll follow after us amen happy for
[42:45] sure we've got to be judged by Jesus
[42:50] Christ the word now every man here today
[42:56] doesn't have to be judged and the him he
[43:01] can be judged this morning if he wants
[43:03] to be judged
[43:05] now there has to be a preparation made
[43:09] for judgment now if God in order to
[43:16] bring everybody into his presence he had
[43:19] to make a propeller
[43:21] and what did what did what what did that
[43:26] see if you don't believe in grace what
[43:31] will be grace they have extended his
[43:36] presence and his to Earl and first see
[43:45] cranes provide a preparation amen oh how
[43:52] happy I'm for that grace provided and
[43:55] preparation grace Islam God's will love
[43:59] these fallen creatures that he provided
[44:01] a preparation to stand then in his
[44:04] presence before judgment see what it did
[44:08] before he could judge them and
[44:10] pronouncing his grace word first
[44:14] Fluellen see
[44:18] so the atonement was already made but
[44:23] the paid for the home see yet they had
[44:28] to pay for the wrong God rented killed a
[44:34] sheep or Hannibal's and and put skins on
[44:37] them to cover them up and blood was
[44:39] first made before judgment the judgment
[44:43] was through the blood of course and then
[44:47] he shed the blood of the innocent to
[44:50] cover up the guilty the guilt of the
[44:52] guilty praise Allah now there is no
[44:56] other gods in any other religion does
[44:58] that amen truly the God of the Bible
[45:05] crazy
[45:10] okay so the Bible tells us here would
[45:16] God brought them out of Egypt
[45:18] why didn't ever make it to the promised
[45:20] land because of their unbelief the
[45:25] provoked God cuts in oh my god
[45:28] their letter prophet they went through
[45:31] the baptism your letter cloud
[45:33] experienced five pillar of fire
[45:37] experience but you know where the bugs
[45:40] are then they make spot while a serious
[45:46] thing was taking place
[45:47] Moses gone there God is busy writing out
[45:50] the Word of God to bring the
[45:52] commandments to them they will make spot
[45:55] they were playing they made the calf and
[45:59] they started worshipping the cows can
[46:03] you make it a time like that and the
[46:08] Prophet was there let me become of the
[46:10] wind so I destroyed all of them why the
[46:15] Bible says because of the hot belief so
[46:19] Paul tells us in the book of Corinthians
[46:20] a 1 Corinthians let us be we're like how
[46:26] they provoke God and fell that does not
[46:31] be guilty of the same things
[46:32] amen so he tells us the same thing since
[46:37] today when you use voice I did not your
[46:39] heart a man see as in the provocation
[46:45] God I'll be up they're going to come and
[46:48] stand in the judgment now the world of
[46:51] the word of God say God the Word of God
[46:56] came clear in the last days look around
[47:01] and see would share tower or leader
[47:03] somebody brought the Word of God in the
[47:07] measure kept in the message none of them
[47:12] that I'm in this preaching but God sent
[47:17] a message to bring the full word that
[47:24] razor oh so this word that was delivered
[47:31] unto us it meant to disbelieve that
[47:36] we're coming the judgment say what they
[47:42] do they take the Word of God
[47:44] traveling under faith isn't it put him
[47:48] to an open shame that's what the Apostle
[47:52] Paul said see it wouldn't be guilty
[48:00] Hebrews 3 18 and 19 and to hope that is
[48:04] well and they should not enter into his
[48:07] rest but those who disobey see who had
[48:14] not listened to his word or refused to
[48:17] be compliant or be persuaded so we see
[48:22] that they were not able to enter into
[48:26] arrest because of an unwillingness to
[48:30] adhere to and Trust in and rely on God
[48:35] and believed and shut them out humbly
[48:42] shut them out so we brother brother told
[48:47] us God is a very fair God which ever way
[48:50] he acted in the past must do the same
[48:51] things he's going to bring the same
[48:55] judgment amen
[49:00] so the helis take note of it when it's a
[49:02] Word of God we need to stay and believe
[49:06] and obey that word of a man
[49:08] see because say that word was given to
[49:11] Adam and Eve as a defense defense they
[49:16] came out of the defense and would
[49:22] Elizabeth the servant they disobeyed God
[49:27] but listen to the serpent which was
[49:31] inspired by the devil
[49:35] see so people would more bleed lies
[49:42] today that misinterpreted don't believe
[49:47] the Word of God same thing
[49:51] they listen to the devil and listening
[49:53] to the Word of God breaks a lot proving
[50:02] his word
[50:07] look what it says in proving his worth
[50:09] don't you realize but dear precious
[50:11] friends at this planet that Satan makes
[50:17] you a promise he will make you one of
[50:23] the best ministers in the Association he
[50:27] will give you the front seat in every
[50:28] Church and make you a deacon he will do
[50:32] anything if you'll just get away from
[50:35] his world so what is the promise signal
[50:42] Satan can promise in the church notice
[50:56] kill him the world and all the kingdoms
[51:00] he would take them he was trying to get
[51:04] him to break that word cuz he knowed he
[51:07] had him right there if he could he made
[51:11] most of Britain's he may even break it
[51:14] but he hit the wrong guy this time plays
[51:18] a lot I'll be glad for that jeez have to
[51:22] stand the test he was not Moses or
[51:26] anybody else he was a word made flesh
[51:29] and I'd say to came there he hit the
[51:33] wrong throw guy says he was a word and
[51:38] he didn't know it he was a word himself
[51:44] I can see him we want to picture him
[51:47] kind of a kids picture I can see that
[51:50] being all black wings flap against him
[51:54] and saying now I'll tell you what its
[51:56] pleasant you should fight and God said
[52:01] if we did we would die oh well Charlie
[52:04] you know you won't I see oh that's
[52:08] nonsense
[52:09] that same old fogey idea
[52:12] don't you believe man but God said so
[52:17] God proved it
[52:18] right and it's brilliant right now
[52:23] people are dying this minute he will
[52:27] prove it right notice when you cut to
[52:31] Moses who said Moses you know you gotta
[52:34] hook him see your high-tempered look
[52:36] what that bunch of the Renegades has
[52:39] done see why don't you just go there and

[52:59] against him and he said oh listen said

[59:32] ba is word only not just one word
[59:37] misplaced see one word kill the human
[59:43] race in the Bible amen
[59:45] see and he says in revelation 22 one
[59:49] word will still kill the whole thing his
[59:54] name will be taken on the book of life
[59:56] and see we should also mention had one
[1:00:00] or take one word see I I don't mean not
[1:00:07] two words just one word not one sentence
[1:00:11] one word one word he says o people do
[1:00:15] you understand one word can change the
[1:00:18] whole thing so
[1:00:23] now I am NOT just exactly talking to
[1:00:28] this audience
[1:00:29] this is staked you see and it goes all
[1:00:33] over the world
[1:00:36] so it's for us he meant turning their
[1:00:40] way is bitching because all over the
[1:00:42] world see to be honest game people of
[1:00:49] the world that one word one word not one
[1:00:54] sentence not one paragraph one word
[1:00:58] that's all Eve disbelief
[1:01:01] I will think cultural overlooked it and
[1:01:08] watch it up forgiven them she said Satan
[1:01:14] begat me and me we should have got to
[1:01:18] deal with that but Satan for the 7 know
[1:01:25] ye although the game is what you put up
[1:01:28] a free bottle agency because you have
[1:01:32] done this thing and headed what's wrong
[1:01:35] with you you suppose with our little
[1:01:38] creation I know the woman you gave me
[1:01:44] kind of expected to stand up see passing
[1:01:50] the buck now you see the movement you
[1:01:53] gave you another story I mean you put me
[1:01:56] to sleep
[1:01:56] I don't know she she's awakened this is
[1:02:01] this is good
[1:02:03] see pass the buck
[1:02:06] and then got her to be with him also you
[1:02:12] know what imagine he could call all the
[1:02:15] animals name them like in giraffe zebra
[1:02:21] he was like a god of the ever chat wat
[1:02:25] what's he done
[1:02:27] yeah but now he disbelieved God would
[1:02:34] eat and he went in telephone so when he
[1:02:40] was not supposed to do say well the
[1:02:46] serpent couldn't answer nothing he just
[1:02:49] you must go crawling on their on your
[1:02:51] belly the rest of your life he be eating
[1:02:53] the best day so much he was an upright
[1:02:57] man only his seat can mix with a human
[1:03:02] race and God allowed it that way they
[1:03:06] did that way but after the city constant
[1:03:11] say we find even today science is trying
[1:03:15] to mix human and animal see them another
[1:03:19] one they've tried it with everything
[1:03:22] else that missing link was a certain
[1:03:26] caste see now let's say they've got the
[1:03:31] wrong foot here so one word disbelief
[1:03:39] God prove it but then if you keep
[1:03:42] everywhere you Shalu
[1:03:44] they doubted one word rug dead to the
[1:03:47] human race I mentioned not love a bread
[1:03:51] loaf for his physical state but every
[1:03:56] word every word just the way certain and
[1:04:00] the Bible says if you have no private
[1:04:03] interpretation no manners anywhere any
[1:04:09] at all to try to interpret the Word of
[1:04:13] God God is his only temperature and how
[1:04:18] does he definitely what I'm making it
[1:04:20] come to pass place a lot so let us earth
[1:04:25] believe that now know as a little group
[1:04:28] I wonder how the past and manage of this
[1:04:32] big groups
[1:04:36] dancing and running around and
[1:04:38] everything else
[1:04:40] but are they paying attention to the
[1:04:42] world is a word preach that there was
[1:04:46] ketchup dancing and getting emotional on
[1:04:51] is gone but rock obama say we must stay
[1:04:58] with the word amen
[1:05:01] so blood sisters I don't know one day if
[1:05:05] I'm not here and your sugar can't be
[1:05:07] continued
[1:05:08] stay with that word today would that
[1:05:13] work if you want to make it on the other
[1:05:16] side
[1:05:16] stay with it would say whatever you know
[1:05:20] the promise of so many things but I'd
[1:05:23] closing right now he said so many things
[1:05:25] he said sometime a little chat will stop
[1:05:28] and the past a simple humble you know
[1:05:31] led by the Holy Spirit then the enemy
[1:05:34] will come and offering another position
[1:05:39] now I know what you small I'm gonna
[1:05:41] cover join our group you know and you'll
[1:05:44] be big and then here salary will reach
[1:05:48] ten times huh and he says it goes there
[1:05:55] and everything out said before you know
[1:05:57] it the enemy comes and they be defeated
[1:06:00] without stating the word but when they
[1:06:04] humble and support the shame of the
[1:06:06] world say but the enemy will come offer
[1:06:10] big things see that's how that's how the
[1:06:14] church will going to see they got
[1:06:16] deceived by getting into big things
[1:06:19] we're going to be big for God million
[1:06:23] more in 44 without the word plays wrong
[1:06:29] so how did he get overpowered and sent a
[1:06:36] nude or whether it's sacred go to the
[1:06:37] word Torah
[1:06:39] see Satan can quote the world see so
[1:06:46] don't let the this come this Satan they
[1:06:49] never become and white wash wash that
[1:06:55] word away see after all what the
[1:06:59] prophets of the bride is she's a word

[1:07:33] in line with the word then we better
[1:07:34] watch it
