want to say God bless to you we love every one of you and we're living in time where we cannot meet but we know in spirit we can be joined together under the fellowship of the precious word that's provided for us in this day and that's where we find comfort in God's word you look at the newspapers and you look at the news you look at the social media there's nothing that will be comforting to you everything is bringing sadness in people thoughts everything pertains to fear everything is talking about no holes a hapless society but we thank God that we can find comfort in his words a man and complicate what he come to Jesus Christ no matter what man would search and no matter what man would do comfort can when he come to Jesus Christ peace can come from inkle he is the Prince of Peace and he is the one that can give joy that is unspeakable amen joy can when he come from him and we thank you for all that is done if you got your Bibles we're gonna turn the book of Revelation the book of Revelation reading from Chapter II now we know that the Greek word for revelation is the populace and pocalypse means the unveiling right so it's something that the book of Revelation is a mysterious book it's a book in simple form and all these things were was meant to be that way God designed it that way so it would not be known to everybody the book of Revelation cannot be understand stood by man's wisdom he cannot be understood by theology he had to be revealed by God himself it is the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ Himself came at him which was revealed to his servant John on the Isle of Patmos runabout 1895 revelation chapter 8 verse 1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour hey man we think what's the reading of his word and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated in a couple of moments yeah the book of Revelation says and what Johnny singing simple for me saying when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of an hour so we know that the moment the whole 16 Matthew 24 Jesus is reading the six seals and that's in written form in metrically form amen we have the seals in written form in the book of Revelation chapter 5 we find the book is closed and Revelation chapter 6 the Lamb steps and began to open the seals but that's in simple form but God decided in such a way that in the end of the seven church age when the seventh messenger is there by was a revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished so we know that here we see revelation it will come to the seventh seal we see a space of half an hour but we find in Revelation Jan 1 it says and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven amen so we know there was there was something happening in Revelation 10 in Gen 1 and this mighty angel is coming down to Revelation 2 and 7 to the seventh age messenger on to the earthly messenger to the earthly angel on the earth at a time he must come to him amen and this mighty angel is coming from an unseen world amen so we find here a great secret a great secret that is locked up in the Bible and Jesus speaks about all the six seals now when he comes to that seven seal it's a secret johnny is now seeing the field in seven former he comes in at seven seal their silence in heaven hey man so we know that the Seventh Seal was a great secret it wasn't to be known to everybody we find that when when the son of man ministry come D as three pools the first two pool was to attract the attention of the people healing the sick multitudes were healed it was a mass ministry then we had the discernment but the Dead Pool was a secret because this was only going to be revealed at in a certain place Amen God was going to reveal this secret in a certain place amen you see I got two things matrimony for 26 days wherefore if they shall say up to you be always in a desert go not forth we are always in the secret chambers believe it not for as the Lightning cover of the east and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be for whereas the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered together amen he wants to meet us in a certain place and that was God's provided place of worship and the secret has been going on for 57 years amen there was an invisible union taking place and he is going on for fifty seven girls because what is the secret that there was silence in heaven amen God had to come himself and reveal himself to his bride amen because why there must be an awakening those seven thunders come to awaken it come out to make it it comes to make a realize then there was a wedding band of grace put on earth as a problem God puts it a wedding band of grace put on air before the foundation of the world she was predestinated for a time like this she was predestinated for a purpose amen but here's the proper of God under us at this time and prior to going to the West he speaks to the church about when God showed in a vision that are you what will happen what will take place and when he must go to the Wizards he had to be in a certain place amen and the time comes when he is there hunting and he's in a certain place then what happened there's a great shaking there's an earthquake takes place what happened seven angel breaks the time barrier come down from an unseen world and it comes to this property management amen revelation 10:1 coming down feeling it to Revelation ten seven solely for the purpose of Revelation 10 8 to 11 solely for the purpose of an elected people on the early man amen God was meeting a prophet not meeting a Pope not meeting a president not meeting a king God cannot change the order of things the Word of God must come to a prophet amen you find this day you find in the Bible when the prophets want to see the Prophet would go to the king and the prophet of prophesy and the prophet who tell the King exactly what he does say the Lord the Prophet wouldn't compromise the proper wouldn't be a soothsayer he will go and tell the king you have done dust dust dust and therefore the Lord is going to do this the Lord is going to bring these plagues upon you because of your action you have turned away from God but now we have false anointed ones on the earth they are purely before Pope's appearing before the Kings appearing before presidents and being soothsayers to them God did not call us for that amen amen amen we are not from this earthly civilization although we come here because of the first but we come here we have put chair because of for six buds but through the second Adam amen - Jesus Christ we are going to be taken out of here we are going to go back to our original condition but there was this great secrets that God eat from everybody what is this great secret then the world nobody else preaches about it until now and everyone's getting awakened to what is happening around them they want to know how called the coming of the Lord but this was a secret all these years amen amen what was that it was this rupture the Bible doesn't use the words actually it talks about being caught up being translated but it was a secret and while also that the process of the rapture began already what what the Book of Paul says you want just thrown Ian's holy saying he said the Lord Himself he meant not anybody else when he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven amen with a shout what is the shout the shout was a message coming forth the Prophet although the earth but he was waiting for a message he had a great ministry a great ministry that was acknowledged by many people that even spearheaded the healing wave but he was waiting for something else he meant he was waiting for the visitation he maintained that he knew that God was with the people now God was in the church in his people but he wanted God you you you know the Son of Man must appear again there must be an appearing of son of man just before between son of God and between the son of David there must be an appearing of the son of man again man there must be thus appearing of son of man and there he comes and he revealed himself amen and this world was torn up it wasn't for that time to be the true God restore the front of God was told by the angel don't try to teach this to Pentecostal babe amen because why his ministry was acknowledged among the Pentecostals at a time but it was to come that rainbow trout he meant that special catch of fish amen that special fish and this was a special catch there was a special people a species there was a special species they had to catch this revelation then had to be quickened amen and why would they be quicker because they already was a gene of burning them if you even wondered for the gene of God they wouldn't have representation to receive this name Amen there was a deep calling to the deep and there was a deep willing to receive it amen so we find this thing has been maybe been going on for 57 years and the bride has been receiving and receiving she receive all those mechanics she's come to the type of purification she's coming to this time of accepting yourself as the Queen she's come to the sign of accepting myself that she is now ready to be amongst the royal with a royal apparel but all these things was good saying Lord I serve you know I've conformed myself to church on the induction not fun for myself into modest living lot of fun for myself to a true Christian living but it's time for this awakening it's a time for real desperation hey there's a time for her to realize a position is more than just going to church it's more than just saying yes I believe in accept this message amen get the time coming and as that is upon the earth right now further to realize it's more than just modest coding living a good clean Christian life then he's wrong unless she's living but it was she must kept for this season amen there was a great secret she must care for the seat for the season what was she kept for amen she had to be kept like Esther for the preservation of life hey men she herself had to be shaken amen she wasn't she was kept under the confines of the message on the Box provided place she was kept secure but there - there's gonna come a time where squeeze will come upon him hey man was she herself will be shaken and she realized that she has to Centrify yourself for this position she's got the royal apparel it's already given to her she can wait but she has to come gently fine she can't come here presently she have to come with a total surrender consecration simple sight everything now because now she's realized she's check from an unseen world up on a fix of annihilation amen amen wonders come and show there are the things that are to be amen one come to show her that if this earthly tabernacle be resolved you already have one waiting for you one time to show that this life is temporal you are trapped in a Pistols amen you are trapped here because of your first birth but you are going to now go to my father's house amen and in my father's house are many mansions I go to prepare the place for you if it's not so I would have told you why would he say many mansions because the problem of God says that's really directly for what he says he says now notice in my father's house is many mansions I do not mean to add to the world will take from it because we did we not to do that the revelation 20:2 said whosoever will any water take out of it but let me just make this not an editor but just to bring out a point in my father's out is many mansions I don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just everybody would look just exactly alike I don't believe that all will be blondes or brunettes or little old big oil giants I believe that God is a God of variety a man aren't you glad for that you will be yourself there your very makeup your very characteristics will continue in heaven amen but he's talking about the many many areas the prophet of God coming and revealing what Jesus is saying revealing his mysterious truths that Jesus is speaking here and he's talking about the many mentioned he's not talking about a physical bullying he's talking about the bodies that we have in heaven amen our theophany bodies and God got them from different nations different kingdoms different tons look at the God that we serve a man and even he see the real place amen heaven is more real than we see the simple life in my name Amen every is more life is more lively that is real life that we have he said there'll be mountains every rivers will be different things according to how you character how your character is somewhat like the mountain some fight like valleys somewhat like the plain god made things to your liking that's our Father he meant me and he said like an athlete parents before they why they expecting to a receive a child on the earth before the child come fall they will make preparation for the child and he will prepare all the things that the child would need and just like that she said I've gone to prepare the place for us now all these things was even from us out of this word because hidden from us it was even from how we are gonna leave this earth amen but he says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout hey man he comes down to the message and what happened seven thousand thousand invoice in the seven thunders mysterious trips death shows us their secrets of the Bible it's all it has a word out of the Bible its secrets that are locked up in the scriptures all the way from Genesis to Revelation secrets that were looked up in a life of Abraham and Sarah see children are locked up in a life of Esther secrets that are locked up in a life of Ruth and Boaz all these things that were hidden in the genealogy of Jesus our Jesus are the people that were coming in on his woman from how to come in and we save Gentile woman had come in secret in the life of Joseph I'll chose the better to choose the Gentile bride at the time when he's better than I was coming in he had to reveal himself to his president but before he revealed himself be president he had to dismiss his wife to the palace so all these things were hidden secrets hidden truths and all this invisible union a chicken place while all this is happening Satan knows of the straighting his plan Satan was orchestrating his plan when the spiritual Babylon which is now wrong what's coming to power was taking over the King Pablo was sitting a stage was sitting a secret plans to take over the stage to take over the whole world and this is not taken wrong we're talking about his people wrong amen it was people rope coming to take over this whole world what is this Lucifer's plan then he planned from heaven then he already had in his mind from heaven he was unfolding on the earth and he is the god of this evil age when Jesus wasn't near Jesus than arguing when he claimed to give him the kingdom he said if you bow down to me he is the god of this evil age and Lucifer is orchestrating his plan yeah we find spiritual Babylon on the earth and what's happening she's gonna have all the targets faced off with his bride she's going to come out to this bride but he finally we thank all that all these things have been revealed to us hey man amen [Music] we find that the Seventh Seal in love they would everything is being assumed only eight people would have liked and elected people who have like yes what I'm saying everything is being deceive I mean everyone that didn't come into the knowledge of the truth of this day he's being deceived when they read the new sleeping deceive name when they were watching all these plagues that are coming on here they're being deceived our governments are being deceived you think you look at your news and you hear a low coming from your government you think that from your government but yeah you're the word they say you see we are being advised we are being advised by scientific evidence and from the whu-oh who are all these people controlled by who is behind the scenes and all the companies are being advised by these people so your government is not making their own rules our governments are being in violence a man and all this is coming from room because Jezebel is treacherous and behind the scenes Jerry Bell is working this is Jersey Bells cunning clan [Music] gross darkness will be upon the people hey man but the bride will have light amen because why he was like he said Shalom arise and shine that light is come when growth darkness is only good and I didn't shine die light is come that seven seniors come amen amen it's come to reveal to bring light to us because all of Christ is no light but when crises come he's come to bring light to us he's come to show and light will shine in darkness I'm trying darkness so we are not the children of the darkness we are the children of the light of the day amen we are the children of the nights when we are children of the day and we walk in lights even as he is alive so God in order to keep his hidden secrets between himself and they elected alone he didn't want anyone else to know it and at the same time Satan is moving to destroy the earth you want to destroy the Christians that destroy is his church world none destroy people that have part in his movement he's getting the people together as God and there was an invisible union with the bride in Christ there's also a union a confederation of churches there are also Union TV please a dialogue with all religions religions politics everything was coming together just like in the days of Jesus before they crucified Jesus what happened people like my enemies here coming together with Pilate coming together when they're Jews with Sanhedrin all these people are coming together and they have the same thing that's happening today and therefore we Matthew 24 Jesus giving out the seals there when he came through at 7 seal amen he said that's to be known and given he kept it further in time he kept it because they were the proper that will come him an and picking up from there hey man the last Church a messenger will come you know come and pick up from there but he was the proper himself you wouldn't know what this thing until he had to hear from an unseen world he had to go and be obedient to God see a program bodies of beat in the world he will follow God and he's keep still until God shows him because appropriate God will only move in the pillar of fire moves when they pull up - stops he stops I want to put a fire moves he moves and the people that come out they're missing you will follow the same pattern hmm when they pull out fire stops she stops when they pull out fire move she moves because she knows that when the pillar of fire is moving and she's moving under that put a fire then ask what you worried about me and I am fine you ask what you will and you shall receive Amen because you know now you are under the protection of God nothing gets changing your way at that time amen when the fellow fire is moving and you are moving no enemy can stand between you and he come Jesus come in written in written form is speaking about the first six here John come in simple form is giving on a stick she'll come to at seven they were silenced I'll be glad for that Jesus said what did Jesus say to Peter blessed are thou simon barjona flesh and blood have not revealed this to you and this is the time when Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he said for my father which is in heaven as reveals to you and he said upon this rock I will build my church what does it spiritual revelation God's church is built upon spiritual revelation this third pole is a total sequence amen Satan knows nothing about it amen because they had he known he would have brought he would have brought what he did in the first two pools he would have brought a fake or a copy like of it but God kept it a total secret amen he couldn't make he couldn't make something out of the water is not there amen so we find that God has chosen and elected people all over the earth amen every age glutted a messenger every age God had a message and he sealed him up for the rage as soon as they come through he seal them up for the range and right here now he called out out a man he called us out that he's given us his word but we know it's coming to a cuts now it's coming to a chiming where this world is not is not good enough for us to do many more you might see in brother but I'm still planning my child still wants to be an astrophysicist your child want to be an S 2 physicist but my God has come to reveal to me about how I'm gonna have another body I'm going to change dimension you worry about the natural but I worry for the spiritual oh my child want to be a an engineer but God showed me the blueprint allow me to the bullets pyramid city I was gonna build a new Jerusalem oh but but brother why I want to be a chemical engineer my God shows me how how a person can be a it can be changed from Mortal to immortal 'ti amen how corruption can put on incorruption Oh much I want to be a doctor my God chose me billions on the sea they shall recover you see that they're ugly my new thing about the things but the spiritual mind will think about spiritual things we are living in a time way it's time to let off it's time to come to total consecration to God it's time to let off the pressure of this world and come into God's providing place of worship amen because this great secret has been revealed to us and us alone a man is coming a secret chambers it's comin a place of worship and he's coming to reveal to us oh you are my beloved bride you are going to take your flight one of these days I come to reveal the secret I'm happy to take you away that way I am yeah my day may be also amen some of other unconscious of the unseen world that is why we get on the way we do but we are conscious that the angel of God is yet hasn't left the earth he's come to make reparation for us to leave he come to show us things amen every time you reading the news you're watching the people looking at it and spiritual eyes that's what they you know God company we come to show you thing we come to show you yourselves in the scriptures before the seals are open you didn't see your name in a book but now when the seals all open you began to see your name you begin to see your part in the scripture amen and you began to be awakened to these things and that's what something some of us did you be conscious sometime we need to have a conscience here's a man to recognize his presence amongst us if you recognize his presence you wouldn't continue in living in the only things living in carnal things you recognize that God has sent his angel amen for what to be preparation for us to leave preparation for us to take our flight others who are of this temporal world some people want to sacrifice temporal living you'll get a person's life span the most you can live a proper life from 70 after that you go 80 and your body can't take it you don't want to live on the earth anymore every day you're getting older you don't want to live on the earth it only makes you realize that you are meant to have life each day you're dying you recognize that you are meant to look because wouldn't you you can the death the body is showing the results but what in you you still feel youthful because in you within you the real you you want to live because you're not meant to die you the first but makes you die but by the new world you don't mean to die when you got the new but you don't see yourself time remaining because when you see it when you watch your person here the person says but I watch my last my loved one take the last breath what you saw was not death taking the last breaths they left that body and that's why that body took the last breaths that person if they wanna believe they left that body when the spirit comes out of the body the body died but that person never time that's why it's Steven when he was big stone he said I could see heavens opened because he has already anything to that dimension he already was gonna leave that body and he saw that body died it but he left that body and that is why pockets say old tips when you're singing oh great with radio actually amen there is no fear in death to a believer in fact the Bible says perfect love custody we all feel a man and perfect long is one your Christ and when you come in perfect love you can walk in perfect faith because now you come on is provided place of worship you come into obedience to Christ and you can walk in perfect faith knowing who you are and now you can go like a structure the king she knows that its depth it can take depth but you know she is she knows the king she knows she wasn't I'm sure for long as the Kings love for her she knew how much the King loved it she knew how much he loved it so she ran by faith even though she said it can be dipped she said she's willing to do that she waiting to crunch but she consecrated her life she didn't this go after hasn't lead to the king she consecrated her life amen she got the people to consecrate themselves she got the people to fast and pray she got the people surrender the price because now she's waiting for the preservation of life and she just didn't go to any outfit that you want she put on the royal apparel in other words she put on a position of authority hey hey man she put on a position of authority and she will go to the king in that manner and when she goes out to the King she go in full submission amen amen she go in full submission and she followed every ordinance that the way she had to go and go down bow down to him and go down and reach out so he can he can put up so he can reach out and put on the sceptre she didn't go out passively so justly I would god we don't come back acidly God has given us his word he told her that we should approach him in what manner we should approach him each one of let to misplace is what Muslim kate is what misinterpret is world each one of the many we should come with this word did not come from some Bible school this word did not come from some human understanding this come from an unseen world the angel of God come down with this word

living will be quicken and they together in a glorified body will go up to meet the Lord in the air amen amen so why we one is why we living in fear why is there fear of death there shouldn't be a fear of living in the time that we living all that we are seeing now on the earth with all that adapting around us Jezebel is plotting Satan Lucifer is orchestrating this whole thing in his kingdom bringing to the world to a stage for him to come and rule on the earth he's gonna commit rule the world is becoming more and more awkward for us the more you get into Christ the more you tap into the spiritual dimension you will smell decay you will spell pollution you will smell soon on the earth and you'll be crying and sign for the abomination of the laws because there's an intercessory role within you because if the Spirit of Christ is in you you must want come into the image of Christ and you must produce the characteristic of Christ which is crying in sign for the lost hey man you know if are you convinced if you are convinced that this message is true then you are convinced that is coming to be a destruction of the earth then you become concerned about those that idea you'll be concerned about your loved one they're like Esther you'll be there for the preservation of life crying out for your people amen trying out for them trying out for the Alliance what likely talk nothing lives on earth to live a comfortable life for them to be blessed for them to be prosperous no you can't open a soul like every I money when they even leave god was in the store you never say how one day would she are going to destroy the whinnies no he believed he knew what God is telling him in the truck God is gonna destroy he began to be in the scene immediately put on ESP roll and he began to intercede for what's going to take place and he asked God to be merciful but God couldn't even find him righteous in front and you look at the world today you telling me that people are gonna repent in a time of crisis right now where people should actually looking up to God and say God be merciful upon us god we have 34 sins god we are sorry that this world in such a condition you didn't people are crying for alcohol people are saying where can we go and buy a alcohol in the black market where can we get our secrets in the black market where can we get our drugs in the black market where can we find some some form of pleasure in the black market yet God is bringing people on their knees to repent time to come to consecration to him time to not to be all about us less of everything of the world time to die to yourself and let Christ live in you but the people don't want that no do you want to live their own lives Paul says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ when blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ I like the way he puts it because people will take this and a man that is Cardinal a man that put looks looks after more of the flesh will look at the spiritual blessings and start to say that he I like to work the use so often they say we have the favor of God we highly blessed we are highly favored they want to take things that the Bible says and speak about the material blessings man is always wanting to concentrate on earthly things but we are not of the civilization we are aliens in this world amen we are aliens of this war be alert citizens of this world we are from another world we didn't know that until the time where we will become awakened from spiritual amnesia to make us realize who we are that we are citizens of an earth a heavenly kingdom and eternal Kingdom we're not from a government we are from a kingdom in a kingdom we are subjects amen and there's different roles in the kingdom in the kingdom the king instructs and we do we obedient to the Kings commands we subject our self to the king amen amen but he says yea blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us you take that as a personal to yourself he has blessed us he didn't bless the whole world he blessed us the elected one with all that would some with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ amen why would you say the one in heavenly places because it's not from an earthly dimension we're not receiving it from this we're receiving it in this dimension but it's coming from another dimension and we have checked into the dimension amen if you not jump into that I mentioned today then Joe go and call yourself a plumber and unclog all those things in the line that dirty in the line remove of all the dirt that's clogging the line that you may tap into the dimension a man called a spiritual plumber amen let the Holy Ghost come down and transform your life remove all the things then he's talking the line you might have a direct line with God a man it must be a clear line there must be no food in it clear of all your earthly thinking clear of your own thoughts clear off all your doubt in reasoning amen your doubt and reasoning in a stripe on your face amen it's a time for you to be rejoicing in the world blessed are all spiritual blessing it's a time for you to have so much of the world in you and you've connected to the spiritual and I mentioned that one of these days you know work as you walk you in have the inner work and you are going to change from mortal to immortality one of these days I'll be working then what are we taking place inside of you he's going to take place and the change that already started within you it's gonna change you know another dimension according as he hath chosen us in him amen he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy you not blame before him in love that's why we have that band amen that's why we have the better grades than waiting man of grace upon us amen the chosen of him him before the foundation of the world you see when God does things you don't say like today today I've decided that take off some of my Scripture because you know I'm going to do this for a certain reason no God already planned things he's got a blueprint and he's got a plan you got every characteristics I'm sorry you got every character to come at a certain season to play out the part and go play out the part and go play on a part and go God will go according to his plan God doesn't change his mind about his word amen having predestinated as to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his world amen so he predestinated us for the purpose now we find that when you look at the world and you're seeing all these things happening around you in the news and the people are wondering why I would add a person question me why is God doing this but when you are seeing that you are seeing them as modern events made clear by property man amen because you are the prophetic voice of this day you have prophetic insight amen amen you have prophetic insight because why someone speaking to you amen from an unseen world you have prophetic insight amen what he's doing is waving dreams before you envision before you amen he's saying all these things when you are seeing the news no you made back to the scripture are you analyzing the news with a scripture with the word has revealed to you amen and you can see Satan and all his plan you can see how it's controlling everything now he's controlling the politics he's controlling the Churchill he's controlling the finances so now he's coming to his crux now he's coming to his reaching is going to be reaching its climax soon ways that are coming to full control that is happening then we are we hey man we are we if you come to your position have you come to recognize that you should be putting on your royal apparel have you come to the pool yesterday now is the time for them kept mi kept for a time such as this for the preservation of life I wasn't kept all the time I

blessings of God's it's time to tap into the dancing way keep everything clear keep all your things that is keeping you at bound clear keep taking all that filth out consecrate your life to God

enough food for us until God renovated then only can we come back here because we are going to go up now to the wedding supper and then we will come to the Millennium on the earth amen God is gonna learn the window set for us we're gonna come remember the Bible said what God said to Adam and Eve he said on the day you eat of the fruit you shall surely die and we know what the Bible says one day with the Lord is like a thousand years to us and what happened man never looked as yet four thousand years a man make you salah and I lived about 900 something they always meant to look on the earth but nobody reached a thousand years again and God will prove death in a millennium when man should look for a thousand years in humanism and Beyond amen because life can only come from thoughts life
