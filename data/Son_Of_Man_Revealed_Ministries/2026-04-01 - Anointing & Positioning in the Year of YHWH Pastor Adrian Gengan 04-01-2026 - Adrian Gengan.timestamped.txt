[0:00] Meet everyone in the mighty name of
[0:01] Jesus. I trust the new year's been kind
[0:03] to you thus far.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you command the new year.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Don't say we'll see what the new year
[0:09] brings. You speak
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; over your situation.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; There are certain walls that God is not
[0:15] going to bring down.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; You need to bring it down.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; There are certain mountains that God's
[0:20] not going to move. You need to move it.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; God could have moved the walls of
[0:24] Jericho himself.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; But they had something to do to march
[0:27] around those walls. Amen.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; Take possession. Take authority.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not the time and season to
[0:33] pray to God. Move this mountain. Move
[0:35] this mountain. This is the time of Mark
[0:37] 11:23 where you speak to the mountain.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; So, let's turn to Isaiah 10:27. And all
[0:44] of this is because of an anointing
[0:45] that's been released to us.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know God's not working with
[0:52] denominations?
[0:53] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; God is working with us.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you brother.
[0:59] Amen. Amen. And uh let's remember those
[1:01] that are unwell. I think this is Kim's
[1:03] unwell. There was a few people. Remember
[1:05] brother Joshua his family. Amen. On the
[1:08] way to Johannesburg.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; I told them to get in touch with you. I
[1:13] believe they're not too far from you.
[1:14] Amen. Fellowship day. Amen. So our
[1:18] brother's a worker here. So try and get
[1:19] him involved.
[1:22] Amen. So we we need somebody else to do
[1:24] our projection and our camera work for
[1:25] now. Praise the Lord. Amen. Then also
[1:28] remember Sister Grace that's unwell with
[1:30] the flu, but God's been gracious to us
[1:34] &gt;&gt; that even though Sister Grace is not
[1:35] here, he gave us another Sister Grace.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; He will not leave us in 2026 without his
[1:41] grace.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We welcome you, Sister
[1:43] Grace.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pray you be blessed in the house
[1:46] of the Lord. Amen. Let's turn to Isaiah
[1:48] chapter 20 uh chapter 10 verse 27.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05] Amen. Everyone feeling good in the house
[2:06] of the Lord?
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the Bible says, "And it
[2:14] shall come to pass in that day that his
[2:16] burden shall be taken away from off thy
[2:18] shoulder."
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Now remember the shoulder is his body
[2:22] &gt;&gt; and his yoke from off thy neck.
[2:26] And the yoke shall be destroyed because
[2:28] of the anointing.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of the anointing you are
[2:33] carrying.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; Yolks shall be destroyed.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Sicknesses shall be healed.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; You shall not be in lack because of the
[2:44] anointing. Then we go to 1 John 2 verse
[2:48] 20.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:55] Praise God.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:20 says, "But you have an
[3:00] uncction from the Holy One, and you know
[3:03] all things."
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; Do you know we are positioned in this
[3:08] time where none of the word is hidden to
[3:10] us.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:7 has already sounded. The
[3:14] mystery of God is already finished.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; Seven seals have been opened. Seven
[3:19] thunders have been been known to the
[3:20] bride. The mind of Christ has been
[3:22] revealed to her. I'll read it again. But
[3:24] you have an uncction from the Holy One,
[3:27] &gt;&gt; and you know all things.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; We drop down to verse 27 there.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; But the anointing
[3:37] &gt;&gt; which you have received of him abideth
[3:40] where?
[3:41] &gt;&gt; In you.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; The anointing is in you.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; So don't doubt yourself.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. much forward with purpose.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; There's an anointing in you.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; And you need not that any man teach you.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's something on the
[4:00] earth right now called artificial
[4:01] intelligence?
[4:02] &gt;&gt; And man is teaching artificial
[4:04] intelligence,
[4:05] &gt;&gt; and they are going to teach you to a
[4:07] place where artificial intelligence will
[4:09] take over most of the jobs,
[4:11] &gt;&gt; most of the commands.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Do you know right now there's a system
[4:14] on the earth that are guiding millions
[4:16] of people. It's Google maps and city.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Thousands, millions of people around the
[4:22] world are instructing that thing to
[4:24] please guide them wherever they are
[4:25] going.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; But we are saying there's an anointing
[4:27] in you, the Holy Ghost which is leading
[4:29] you and guiding you.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; It is much more superior than artificial
[4:33] intelligence.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:36] The anointing which you have received of
[4:38] him abideth in you, and you need not
[4:41] that any man teach you, but as the same
[4:43] anointed teacheth you of all things and
[4:46] is truth and is no lie and even as it is
[4:50] at
[4:51] &gt;&gt; taught you, you shall abide in him.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray. Father, we thank
[4:57] you for your word. We pray Lord that you
[4:59] bless your word. We know your word is
[5:00] already blessed, anointed. Father, I
[5:02] pray Lord you'll find an abiding place
[5:04] in our hearts now even as we father
[5:05] continue. We pray for your Holy Spirit
[5:07] be in attendance. Oh God, we ask it in
[5:09] Jesus name. Amen. May be seated.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; So what a time and season we have
[5:17] entered into now.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; We are at the brink of our body change.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. Glory to God.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just for a little illustration,
[5:31] when the prophet came and the seals were
[5:33] opened up to him, that was a shout
[5:35] message to gather living saints.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; Now, for a little illustration, if this
[5:41] was 63, seals are open.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; 60 years have passed. We are not there
[5:48] anymore.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; If this is now eternity, I'd say we are
[5:53] almost here.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. Amen.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. The prophetic wheels have moved on.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; We can't be looking at the message from
[6:03] a historical point of view.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; The message have progressed with us.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; The message has been moving with us.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are the final voice to
[6:12] the final age.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; So, we are talking about this anointing
[6:18] that's in us.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; And we've got to awaken that anointing
[6:21] in us.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; I pray that this you will awaken greater
[6:24] potentials within you.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. greater giftings within you.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there are giftings within the
[6:30] church, we are praying that this will be
[6:31] the year, the season that will unlock
[6:33] those doors for you.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That it will not remain dormant
[6:37] anymore.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; God may have had you in a season and a
[6:41] purpose in a specific area for a time in
[6:44] your life. You may have been taking care
[6:46] of sheep.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; But you're already anointed by the
[6:49] prophet Samuel.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when time and season comes
[6:53] around, he positions you in front of a
[6:55] giant and you can't go back to taking
[6:57] care of sheep.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was one stage of the
[7:03] journey.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; David didn't sit there as being king and
[7:05] wondering what's happening to the sheep.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; That season had passed.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; So when GOD ANOINTS YOU, WHEN GOD
[7:11] PROMOTES YOU, you've got to move with
[7:12] the anointing of God.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We find here the
[7:17] prophet is saying now in the message
[7:19] shalom God stands on the promised word
[7:22] for each new year
[7:24] &gt;&gt; 2025 is finished people.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; 2025 is finished and all the promises
[7:30] associated with 2025 is finished.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Whatever anointing God had for 2025,
[7:40] it's finished.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; God is not scrambling now. I didn't
[7:44] forget. I didn't do certain things in
[7:45] 2025. Let me doubt do it in 2026. The
[7:48] prophet is saying he stands on the
[7:50] promised word for each new year.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; There are things that will try and creep
[7:56] up in into your life now that was there
[7:58] in 2026 that was plaguing you.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; The Amalachites were upon you.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Demon powers were oppressing you.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; DON'T LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR them to
[8:07] come into the new year.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; SHUT THE DOOR ON IT.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. CLOSE YOUR EARS TO ALL NEGATIVITY.
[8:13] YES.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; CLOSE YOUR EARS TO ALL PROBLEMS. AMEN.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE VICTORIOUS IN CHRIST.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; You got to declare it WITH YOUR OWN
[8:20] MOUTH. THIS IS NOT THE SEASON THINKING
[8:22] about your problems. This is the season
[8:24] for you to speak.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen to what he says now.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Now, it's a new year, right? 2026.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Our prophet IS TELLING US THAT GOD
[8:35] stands on his promise for each new year.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I want TO UNLOCK THOSE PROMISES.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I WANT TO unlock the anointing for
[8:43] this year.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; He stands on it. Who stands on it? God
[8:47] stands on it.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; If God is standing on the promise for
[8:50] this year, I WANT TO STAND ON the
[8:51] promise for this year.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; To fulfill what he's got promised for
[8:57] this year.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; Don't just think your life is just
[9:01] continuing the same. I have the same old
[9:03] problems, the same old worries. No.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; You put your worries under your feet.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; You put your problems under your feet.
[9:10] Amen.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; You declare that I am victorious in
[9:12] Christ.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; Now listen, whatever it is, now you can
[9:19] replace whatever with whatever you are
[9:20] trusting the Lord for.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, I want to be right in
[9:24] the center of his will in the future
[9:27] like they did like the people of the
[9:29] past.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; They trusted in the promise of God.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; So he's saying, I want to be right in
[9:34] the center of his will.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:38] So for the the new year is determined by
[9:41] God.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Now many people think I'm going to
[9:45] determine the new year.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; They they run ahead of God's plan.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; God positions you in a certain place.
[9:52] You people can't wait for the promise to
[9:54] come to pass.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; People get anxious.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; Other people are getting promoted. Other
[10:00] people are getting married. Other people
[10:02] are thriving. Other people are
[10:03] progressing. What about me? You wait.
[10:05] God has a plan for you. Amen.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; If the if the neighbor has a building
[10:09] plan here, I can't build my house on his
[10:11] building plan.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; God has blueprints for my life.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; You know what you're going to do? Sell
[10:19] yourself short.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Because the neighbor may have a
[10:22] singlestory house designed for his life.
[10:24] God has a doublestory house designed for
[10:25] your life. If you do according to his
[10:27] plan, you're going to do yourself short.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:36] Don't be mistaken. God is not haphazard
[10:38] regarding his plan for you.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; He's got a blueprint for every one of
[10:42] our lives.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; We've got to trust his plan.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO TRUST HIS PURPOSE.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; Do you know what God's ultimate design
[10:50] for you? For you to reach glorification.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; For you to have a BODY CHANGE.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS SPECIFICALLY designed a plan
[10:56] for your life.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Joseph's life was not like David's life.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; It was different.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. If you do a study on
[11:04] on how God delivers because 40 is the
[11:07] number of God's deliverance.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; And he says at the 41st year everything
[11:11] he delivered them. The 41st year. Go
[11:14] look at that.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; In the 41st year.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; So I am saying God's going to deliver
[11:20] you from things that you thought you
[11:22] would never get out of.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; Sicknesses that were plaguing your body
[11:26] that you never thought you would
[11:27] overcome. God already healed you. God
[11:30] already delivered you. Yes.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Sister Grace was telling us, "Amen, she
[11:35] put shoes on that she hadn't put on for
[11:37] 2 years
[11:38] &gt;&gt; since the accident."
[11:39] &gt;&gt; And she says, "I don't care about the
[11:40] pain. I'm putting my shoes on and I'm
[11:42] going to the house of the Lord to
[11:43] worship."
[11:44] &gt;&gt; That is faith in action.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; Do things that you couldn't normally do.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; If sickness has held you back in certain
[11:56] area of your life, you go and do things
[11:58] that your body won't allow you to do.
[12:01] and you command it and you already
[12:03] declare 1 Peter 2:24 over your life and
[12:05] declare by the stripes of Jesus I am
[12:07] healed.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Your body has to obey your confession.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Now listen, before nature can uh obey
[12:14] your confession, how about we start with
[12:16] our own body obeying our confession.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Before we speak to the wind, before we
[12:20] speak to animal life, BEFORE WE SPEAK TO
[12:22] PLANT LIFE, speak to your own body.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Speak to your own situation.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; So he says the new year is determined by
[12:35] God. Just determined to stay in his
[12:37] word. Walk where the word says walk.
[12:40] Don't wander off on our own path.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; God is speaking in this hour.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; Walk where the word says walk.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; He says new year. New year. What about
[12:51] the new year? Brings new hope. So don't
[12:53] be hopeless.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; Your prophet is telling YOU IT BRINGS
[12:56] NEW HOPE.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; We're one year closer, one day closer
[13:03] than we was yesterday. We don't look
[13:05] back, we look forward.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; New year doesn't mean turning a page,
[13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We turn to the word.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we don't know what
[13:15] tomorrow holds,
[13:16] &gt;&gt; but the word does.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; So, we turn to the word and he will
[13:20] guide us. He says, now I just put this
[13:23] here because I want to show you
[13:24] something about artificial. He says just
[13:26] like that light shining out there, the
[13:27] sunshine, that's God's spoken word.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else can give light like
[13:33] that.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing else can give light like the
[13:39] sunlight.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; He says any artificial light burns out
[13:44] in a little bit, bulbs and everything
[13:47] else, but that never fails for it's the
[13:50] spoken word of God made manifest. Now,
[13:52] as the world is positioning themselves
[13:54] now and trusting in artificial
[13:56] intelligence,
[13:57] &gt;&gt; yes,
[13:58] &gt;&gt; I am saying there's an intelligence put
[14:00] into you.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Since the day of Pentecost,
[14:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN RELYING on that
[14:06] intelligence.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; It is supreme intelligence.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; IT IS SUPERNATURAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS
[14:12] IN EVERY SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD THAT IS
[14:14] BORN AGAIN. IT IS CALLED THE HOLY GHOST.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO JOHN 14 SAYS that this
[14:19] Holy Ghost, you know, artif artificial
[14:22] intelligence will have to train you to
[14:23] comfort you.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe if you're depressed or down and
[14:26] out, this can now speak to you.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; Think about your thoughts.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Just breathe in and breathe out.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; They can design it.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Calm down.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; I can have very soothing things.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in St. John, Jesus is
[14:47] telling us, I'm going to send you a
[14:48] comforter.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; We want to go to a psychiatrist to find
[14:52] comfort. The the comforter that was sent
[14:54] is in you.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; In fact, YOU SHOULD GO TO THE
[14:59] PSYCHIATRIST AND COMFORT HIM
[15:01] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT MAN IS LISTENING to
[15:02] nonsense THE WHOLE DAY. HE'S LISTENING
[15:04] TO A BUNCH OF MAD PEOPLE THE WHOLE DAY.
[15:06] AND MOST PSYCHOLOGISTS AND psychiatrist
[15:08] go mad anyway.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Listening to all their problems.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says you watch the
[15:13] company you keep.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; I'd like to tell every psychiatrist and
[15:16] every psychologist, watch what company
[15:18] you keep.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; You invite hundreds of people into your
[15:20] office every day and you listen to all
[15:21] their nonsense. Their spirits jump on
[15:23] them. That's why psychiatrists are
[15:24] living off medication and all of these
[15:26] things.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Don't fall for the trap of the devil.
[15:29] This year you go to the doctor's office
[15:31] and there is proclaiming stuff
[15:33] &gt;&gt; over your life.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; He's asking you about your family
[15:36] history. He's asking you, did your
[15:38] father have this? Did your mother have
[15:39] this?
[15:41] &gt;&gt; He wants you to attach to some earthly
[15:43] inheritance and limit. some earthly
[15:45] sickness.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Your father is God. I'm going to
[15:47] reestablish that. Your father is God and
[15:49] God HAS NEVER BEEN SICK. SO YOU ASK YOU,
[15:52] HAS YOUR FATHER ever been sick? And
[15:53] never.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; My father has never been sick.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; There is no HISTORY OF HEART TROUBLE IN
[15:57] MY FAMILY. THERE IS no history of Oh,
[16:00] come on, PEOPLE OF GOD. THERE IS NO
[16:01] HISTORY OF CANCER IN MY FAMILY.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Refuse to accept sicknesses
[16:08] that have your name on it.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; REFUSE TO ACCEPT PROBLEMS THAT HAVE YOUR
[16:12] NAME ON IT. RETURN TO SEND HER.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Satan knows how to maneuver us out of
[16:18] our position and our plan of God.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; He knows he's a deceiver.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; So don't fall for him.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Artificial intelligence. Believe me,
[16:30] some of you are aware. You're in
[16:31] business world. Maybe you are more
[16:33] advanced than us in knowing how advanced
[16:35] this artificial intelligence is
[16:37] becoming.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the prophet of God is
[16:42] establishing something here. He's saying
[16:44] artificial intelligence can never match
[16:46] the sunlight. Artificial light can never
[16:48] match the sunlight.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; I'm reestablishing artificial
[16:51] intelligence will never outdo the Holy
[16:54] Spirit.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was sent to lead YOU AND
[16:58] GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; YOU GO TO GOOGLE THERE, they got AI
[17:02] there. You ask him about some truth. But
[17:04] there's a greater truth in you.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know artificial
[17:09] intelligence is only based on what they
[17:11] feed it?
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; So if you go and ask AI regarding the
[17:16] message of the hour, it's going to also
[17:18] bring up negativity which is false
[17:20] truth. Falsehood.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; But the spirit of truth in you,
[17:24] &gt;&gt; yes,
[17:25] &gt;&gt; will not be deceived by artificial
[17:27] intelligence.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying start to rely on the
[17:33] anointing.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; David knew that he was anointed. Yes.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; He started to rely on the anointing. The
[17:40] prophet Samuel had anointed him.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Even Jesus began to rely on what the
[17:45] word said about him.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; When they presented him the book in the
[17:48] temple that day, he went to where the
[17:50] scriptures was written of him.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; When it's your time and season now, let
[17:55] me tell you people OF GOD, WHEN IT'S
[17:57] YOUR TIME AND SEASON NOW,
[17:59] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S YOUR TIME TO BE COUNTED, YOU
[18:02] CAN'T GO TO ANOTHER MAN'S SCRIPTURE.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GLORY.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not open to I am the voice of
[18:10] one crying in the wilderness.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; That season HAD PASSED.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE light of that day when it
[18:16] was when John the Baptist WAS ON THE
[18:18] EARTH BEFORE JESUS CAME.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; YES.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN JESUS WAS THERE, THE SCRIPTURES
[18:22] REGARDING HIMSELF HAD TO BE ESTABLISHED.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; He had to say the spirit of the
[18:28] sovereign Lord is upon me.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; The the spirit wasn't no more in John.
[18:34] The spirit of the sovereign lord is upon
[18:36] me because he has anointed me
[18:39] &gt;&gt; to preach.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Let's read that scripture. Amen. I got
[18:42] it here somewhere. Amen. So here the
[18:44] prophet is establishing John the Baptist
[18:46] was the light of the hour.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; He was the light before Jesus was the
[18:49] light.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet Isaiah prophesied about him.
[18:52] Right.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus said you did walk in the light.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; But when WHEN HE'S MOVED PAST JOHN NOW
[19:00] &gt;&gt; YES.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus the WORD MADE FLESH IS THERE.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; YES. YES.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; You can't stay in John's message when
[19:06] Jesus is here.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope some of you are here while
[19:09] I'm saying
[19:11] &gt;&gt; 1963 HE SAYS THAT'S OUR LORD UP THERE.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T STAY WITH A LADY MESSAGE.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; YES.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE LORD HIMSELF, SHALOM IS HERE.
[19:23] ARISE AND SHINE FOR THY LIGHT IS COME
[19:26] AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD IS RISEN UPON
[19:28] THEE.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR
[19:33] LIGHT ON THE OUTSIDE. THE THE BIBLE SAYS
[19:35] IT'S RISEN upon thee.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; You see, you can't walk in the Lutheran
[19:42] light.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; No.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Lutheran light is finished.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; WESLEYAN LIGHT IS FINISHED. METHODIST
[19:48] LIGHT.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; PENTECOSTAL LIGHT IS FINISHED.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE LIGHT OF THE HOUR. The
[19:53] prophet say THE LIGHT HAS COME. RISE AND
[19:55] SHINE. THE WORD LIGHT manifested word of
[19:58] God is a light.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. says not turn a new page. Turn to
[20:02] the word.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; See what the word promises for today.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; See what the light of this day is
[20:07] supposed to be.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody ask you, where are we in the
[20:14] word? Where are we in the word? If you
[20:15] go to Malachi 4 and Revelation 10, you
[20:18] are pointing to another man's ministry
[20:20] that he already vindicated.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You must open to what it is
[20:29] written of you.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; You must be able to say, "Lo, I come in
[20:32] the VOLUME OF THE BOOK.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; THE WORD IS MADE FLESH IN ME."
[20:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; I am the one who went to the angel and I
[20:37] took THE BOOK AND I ATE the book. And
[20:39] this is THE SEASON OF MY PROPHECY.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; I AM IN REVELATION 10 11. I AM
[20:44] PROPHESYING AGAIN.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; You know, we will be defeated if we are
[20:50] not operating in our scripture.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Because I am not Revelation 10:7.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; No.
[20:57] That's right.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; So, I can't have authority
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; on Revelation 10:7.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Because I am not the seventh angel.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; BUT I AM JOHN, A TYPE OF THE BRIDE.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; YES.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Who went to the ANGEL AND TOOK THE BOOK
[21:14] &gt;&gt; AND ATE THE BOOK.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; YES.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; YES.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; AND NOW PROPHESYING AGAIN.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; There are things that we must do.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; It always ends up in an action. AND THE
[21:24] HOLY GHOST IS THE ACTION OF GOD IN YOU.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Taking the book was good.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Eating the book was good.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; BUT THE FINAL PART OF THAT IS TO
[21:32] PROPHESY AGAIN.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; AND this time it season the SPOKEN WORD
[21:36] HAS RETURNED BACK TO THE CHURCH. AND TOO
[21:39] MANY people are silent.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; It's the power of the spoken word.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; It's not the power of the thinking word.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Some people are deep thinkers.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; I'll think about my problems.
[21:53] I'm plotting our plan. How am I going to
[21:54] do it? No. There's an anointing in you,
[21:56] the spirit of truth which will lead you
[21:58] and guide you out of EVERY TRIAL, EVERY
[22:00] PROBLEM, EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; And God loves you too much to let you
[22:05] remain in sin. Let me tell you that GOD
[22:07] LOVES YOU TOO MUCH to let you remain in
[22:09] A BACKSLIDING CONDITION. HE'S GOING TO
[22:12] BUST EVERY CONCRETE. HE WILL BREAK
[22:14] THROUGH EVERY WALL AND EVERY BARRIER
[22:16] JUST TO RELEASE YOU IN THE
[22:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; GLORY. PRAISE THE LORD.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; WHEN IT COMES TIME AND SEASON FOR HIS
[22:25] WORD TO BE MANIFEST,
[22:26] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; HE WILL BRING HIS WORD TO PASS
[22:29] REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITION YOU FIND
[22:31] YOURSELF IN.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Genesis 18,
[22:34] &gt;&gt; time and season had passed.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; 25 years had passed.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Sarah is still in doubt and unbelief.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; But not Abraham.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Here the angel comes.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yahweh.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, this is the year of
[22:52] Yahweh.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Where he is Lord.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Yahweh.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Lord. Lord means owner.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Let let him be your owner this year.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; He The Lord comes to Sarah and tells
[23:08] Abraham, "Time has come now. You're
[23:11] going to have a son. Where's Sarah?
[23:13] &gt;&gt; You can't operate like this on your own.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; I need both male and female. Hey,
[23:18] &gt;&gt; hey,
[23:19] &gt;&gt; he came. That's our Lord up there.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; But he's looking for Isara now.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Because he needs both parties.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; One as a seed, one as the egg.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; He needs both of them to come together
[23:29] to reproduce his life on the earth.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Where is Sarah?
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Sarah is sitting in a tent.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Sarah is sitting in the tent.
[23:40] The Lord's back turned towards her and
[23:42] he discerns a heart.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:45] While he's telling Abraham about this
[23:47] promise,
[23:48] &gt;&gt; it's time and season now. I'm going to
[23:50] reproduce my life.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Sarah laughs.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you are laughing. You're
[23:55] thinking, "What am I talking about?"
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; You lived with this problem for so long,
[23:59] the situation for so long. You can't see
[24:01] a way out for yourself. I say you don't
[24:04] laugh in the face of God. You accept it.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; The Lord is discerning your heart even
[24:08] now and ask me why are you laughing?
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Why are you doubting?
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Some of us are managing
[24:15] symptoms. God didn't call us to manage
[24:17] symptoms of sicknesses and diseases.
[24:19] Manage problems.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[24:22] &gt;&gt; some of us have self-appointed managers
[24:23] here.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[24:27] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, brother Sam, but that's an
[24:29] acronym of Sam.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Selfappointed managers. SM.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; They are self-appointed.
[24:39] The spirit of negativity is upon me
[24:42] &gt;&gt; and I am anointed to be negative all my
[24:44] life.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; They created their own scripture.

[24:54] hope things you hope things work out for
[24:56] you this year

[25:02] &gt;&gt; You can't hope things.
[25:06] Lord, help me.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody turn to Genesis 1:26 there.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; When God created you, I've got it here.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; When God created you, you know what
[25:16] blueprint he used?
[25:18] &gt;&gt; He used the blueprint of Jesus Christ.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; To create you.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; That was the blueprint he used.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "AND GOD SAYS, LET us make man
[25:30] in our image."
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; The blueprint he used.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:35] was man Jesus.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[25:42] of Jesus,
[25:45] &gt;&gt; thank you, LORD.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S A MOUNTAIN?
[25:49] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE WIND?
[25:50] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S A BLIND EYE?
[25:52] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE WIND AT HAND?
[25:53] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. DON'T PLACE IT ALL ON
[25:55] JESUS. HE'S GAINING RIGHT FORM.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN DO IT.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU YOU GOT THE FAITH. AMEN. YOU GOT
[26:02] TO UNLOCK THE HOLY GHOST THAT'S IN YOU.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; DON'T THINK IT'S FOR ANOTHER PERSON.
[26:07] It's you.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU FOR THIS TIME AND
[26:10] SEASON.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says, "Let us make
[26:13] man in our image after our likeness."
[26:15] And they must have dominion.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; God's original blueprint designed for
[26:19] you is for you TO HAVE DOMINION.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; DOMINATE YOUR SITUATION.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; DOMINATE YOUR FINANCES.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; DOMINATE YOUR MARRIAGE LIFE.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; DOMINATE YOUR JOB.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; DOMINATE YOUR SCHOOL.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:31] AMEN.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE CALLED TO DOMINATE.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; DOMINATE THE BUSINESS AREA.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; When God has uncommon favor on your
[26:40] life, even the unbelievers start calling
[26:42] your name.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; I was hearing the other day.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Just so happens I don't know whether to
[26:47] be here. Even people high up in the in
[26:50] the in the uh corporate world are
[26:53] messaging us telling us please send me
[26:56] number.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. because they know he carries a
[27:00] certain grace. They want to connect with
[27:01] him for business. Now,
[27:06] &gt;&gt; but God can only release it to people
[27:07] who know how to handle it.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Who stay humble.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; So, if you're expecting God to open
[27:14] certain things in your life, you know, I
[27:16] was hearing uh uh my cousin tell me this
[27:19] the other day
[27:20] &gt;&gt; and and we were chatting and he was
[27:21] telling me, you know what, you know,
[27:23] it's human tendency when God gives us
[27:25] all these blessings, we turn away from
[27:26] it. Turn away from him, you know. So I'm
[27:28] thinking if you know that is a wrong
[27:31] thing to do.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Why would you do it?
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; It seems like the human nature is that
[27:42] when God starts to bless them, they
[27:44] start to turn away from God. That's the
[27:45] time to seek him even more.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Because he has he's found something in
[27:51] you that he can entrust.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like the the if you read Genesis
[27:55] 25, the man that he could entrust with
[27:57] 10 talents.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; He says he gave them according to their
[28:00] several ability.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; According to the ability with which you
[28:04] can handle.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; God knows if he gave you a million grand
[28:07] right now, some of you will just blow
[28:09] it.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Do you know that there statist uh
[28:13] statistics
[28:15] &gt;&gt; that most of these people that win lotto
[28:17] hope no one's putting lotto here.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Please don't get poor in your room now.
[28:21] Gambling and things like that.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:24] Yes,
[28:25] &gt;&gt; people don't have to go anymore to the
[28:27] &gt;&gt; betting houses.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they got apps now on their phone.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; They're getting poor in their room.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Oh god.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Before the parents used to say, "Don't
[28:37] go out the house." Now they're not going
[28:38] out the house.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Before it was a thing where they go to
[28:45] meet prostitutes.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Now the prostitutes are coming in the
[28:47] house through the phone.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Pornography coming through the phone.
[28:53] All kinds of food coming in the house.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; And we're wondering why the church can't
[29:00] progress. We wondering why the home
[29:02] can't progress. People are living secret
[29:04] lives.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Do you know when the prophet spoke
[29:10] against television, he was speaking
[29:11] against a fourth dimension that science
[29:13] tapped into that was bringing images
[29:15] into the homes of people.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; It is now not an that TV was an infant
[29:20] stage. Yes.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Now it's a full grown adult.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; And he's bringing to you every sin
[29:27] that's
[29:27] &gt;&gt; like, you know, in the days of Sodom.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Everything that's against God's thoughts
[29:32] and plans, he's bringing it into your
[29:34] home and he's feeding your mind with it.
[29:36] Feeding it, feeding it, it
[29:39] &gt;&gt; you can use it for the good.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; But how many people can say they got the
[29:44] Holy Ghost's anointing to know how to
[29:46] handle it?
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Glory. Wonderful.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; So have dominion.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; You are made in the blueprint of the
[29:54] Lord Jesus Christ.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Now when he's fully redeemed us, we come
[30:00] back to that blueprint.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Have dominion.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Have dominion. Praise the Lord.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Watch your
[30:07] I find the scripture here. Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; I just want to bring this here to show
[30:13] you the year 2026.
[30:16] 26 in the Hebrew. You know the Hebrew
[30:18] letters have a number attached to it.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; The Hebrew number is 26. It's it means
[30:24] the divine name of God which is Yahweh.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; If if you do your natural breath
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; like this. They say in our natural
[30:34] breathing we are saying Yahweh.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; They say in our natural breathing we are
[30:41] constantly calling Yahweh.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Yahweh.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Yahweh. We are in our natural breathing.
[30:47] Breathe in and out. It brings out
[30:50] Yahweh.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; So it's the divine name of God.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Yahweh.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; So in 2026, make him Lord of your life.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Make him Lord of everything.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; It's formed by this.
[31:14] hair
[31:15] &gt;&gt; 10 565 those alphabets
[31:18] &gt;&gt; and the sum of these are 26
[31:21] &gt;&gt; symbolizing God's eternal presence
[31:24] &gt;&gt; because if you make him Lord his
[31:26] presence is
[31:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say with you his
[31:28] presence is in you
[31:31] &gt;&gt; we are past that time now I was just
[31:33] listening to a song in the car and the
[31:35] Holy Spirit convicted me and I told my
[31:37] wife I turned the song off
[31:38] &gt;&gt; and I said let's keep sing the next one
[31:40] and told my wife why
[31:41] &gt;&gt; because God's start looking for infants
[31:44] now. You know, children,
[31:46] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[31:46] &gt;&gt; you you hold a hand and you make them
[31:47] walk,
[31:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:50] &gt;&gt; But you see Zoe is walking now. She
[31:51] don't need
[31:53] &gt;&gt; assistance.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Is Sister Sarah holding a hand to walk?
[31:59] &gt;&gt; No, we're in Galatians 2:20. Where?
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Christ is
[32:05] &gt;&gt; in us.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; It's not God with us anymore.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; It's God in us.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we start to unlock the wrong
[32:12] anointing, we'll be walking with a
[32:14] picture skewed.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; So, we can't sing songs like, "I can't
[32:18] even walk without you holding my head."
[32:21] &gt;&gt; God's looking for mature sons and
[32:23] daughters of God who can stand and take
[32:25] the position of the earth. Now,
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, amen.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; If you apply that scripture, if that
[32:31] song, I can't even walk without you
[32:33] holding my hand, then you won't be able
[32:35] to speak to your mountain
[32:36] &gt;&gt; because you are expecting God to move
[32:38] mountains. Yes. Yes. Lord.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We sing other songs to which we
[32:41] need to stop.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; He can move mountains.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Where in the scripture does it say he
[32:46] must move the mountain?
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; He calls walls to fall. Jericho walls.
[32:51] He didn't break it down. The people had
[32:52] to physically go and do something. Let
[32:54] me tell you something. If the children
[32:56] of Israel didn't walk around those
[32:57] walls, those walls would have not
[32:58] fallen.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURAL INSTRUCTION WAS YOU WALK
[33:02] AROUND THE WALL.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; And if you walk around the wall, the
[33:05] wall will fall.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE SCRIPTURAL INSTRUCTION IS NOT
[33:08] IF YOU PRAY TO GOD AND ask him to move
[33:10] the mountain.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURAL INSTRUCTION IS IF YOU SAY
[33:14] TO THE MOUNTAIN.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Tell it what to do and where to go.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Tell it be thou removed. That's what to
[33:23] do. Tell it where to go. Some of us are
[33:25] not speaking over our situations. People
[33:27] of God. We are expecting somebody else
[33:28] to speak over our situation. The
[33:30] scripture doesn't say call the pastor
[33:32] and let him speak over your situation.
[33:34] It says if you say
[33:36] &gt;&gt; yes,
[33:36] &gt;&gt; if you say
[33:38] &gt;&gt; amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you know demon powers
[33:40] oppressing your family members. Demon
[33:42] powers oppressing your your wife, your
[33:44] daughters, your sons. Demon powers are
[33:46] all around you, maybe even in your boss.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; But you're just constantly oppressed by
[33:50] him. Why don't you speak to that demon?
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Don't go speak to your boss now and call
[33:57] him a demon,
[33:59] &gt;&gt; but speak.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:03] Amen.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Because the devil will find ways to get
[34:07] to you.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; And he knows if you are standing on the
[34:10] word, he's going to use every means
[34:12] necessary.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; They're going to use lethal force.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of heaven suffer with
[34:18] violence.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; They are using lethal force to come
[34:21] against you.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; So speak to every demon power that is
[34:27] coming against you.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Isaiah 54 there that
[34:31] no weapon formed against you shall
[34:33] prosper.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; And every tongue that speaketh against
[34:36] you, God shall shall be condemned.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; You see, we are not in the age of
[34:44] infancy now where God is babying us. We
[34:47] are not
[34:48] &gt;&gt; the Lutherans.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; No,
[34:51] &gt;&gt; we are not the Wesians.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; We are not the Pentecostal babes.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know babes babble.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; No, we are not in the age of the spoken
[35:06] word.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; We speak
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; fluently.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; We speak clearly.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; We dominate.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; We dominate every sphere of life.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; We dominate every area.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; I declare over you right now. Amen. That
[35:21] this is the sovereign year of the Lord.
[35:22] It's the year of Yahweh. If you make him
[35:24] Lord, you shall unlock uncommon favor
[35:27] upon your life.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Psalm 5:12 says that his favor shall
[35:33] surround us like a shield.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; But only if we make him Lord.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Praise God.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; God has attached something here now.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Yahweh.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Numeric value 26.
[35:50] Let me tell you, it's so close. I told
[35:52] you we are so close here that if you
[35:54] refuse to do it willingly,
[35:55] &gt;&gt; yes,
[35:56] &gt;&gt; the scripture says,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; let me rephrase if some of you are not
[36:00] following what I'm saying.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; He refused, if you refuse right now to
[36:03] willingly make him Lord,
[36:05] &gt;&gt; we are almost at this point when he's
[36:07] going to return. And the Bible says
[36:08] every knee shall bow
[36:10] &gt;&gt; and every tongue confess that he is
[36:12] Lord.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; So you can choose to do it willingly.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; To make him Lord.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Or you'll be forced to do it when he
[36:20] comes.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; So, could it be in the year of Yahweh?
[36:28] &gt;&gt; That he's asking you to make him Lord.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Now, now we we are not easily deceived.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And neither are we not deceived in any
[36:40] way to make make us think that because
[36:42] we grew up in the framework of the
[36:43] message that we are message believers.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; No.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:52] The eagle that grew up in the chicken
[36:53] ear didn't make it a chicken.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; It was always an eagle.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; So there are people that grown up within
[37:02] the framework of the message
[37:05] &gt;&gt; that have accepted the prophet
[37:08] &gt;&gt; but have not accepted Christ.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Because we only made them focus on this
[37:18] is the prophet. Yeah,
[37:20] &gt;&gt; we focus on the dos and the don'ts,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; but they never establish a relationship
[37:24] with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; To make him Lord and Savior.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; We have a generation,
[37:33] &gt;&gt; a silent generation that can't worship.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; A silent generation where there are no
[37:38] preachers coming out, where there are no
[37:40] song leaders, there are no deacons.
[37:42] They're just happy to go into the
[37:43] corporate world. Am
[37:48] I right?
[37:51] &gt;&gt; They floating in the framework of the
[37:54] message.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And their focus is only academic,
[37:59] &gt;&gt; corporate,
[38:00] &gt;&gt; corporate, corporate. How can I climb
[38:03] corporate ladder?
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; You know, God can bypass protocols for
[38:10] you if you're faithful. You don't even
[38:12] have to have a degree. He will make you
[38:14] progress at such a level
[38:16] &gt;&gt; that even they will wonder
[38:18] &gt;&gt; how you got to that.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know there's
[38:22] some testimonies here.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Some of you can testify right here,
[38:25] right now.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; You don't hold any official degree.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; But God raised you through the ranks.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Because of his uncommon favor.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Some of you were not supposed to be
[38:38] sitting here perfectly well, but God
[38:39] brought you here perfectly well.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It bypassed the doctor's
[38:43] diagnosis of your life.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; And what they said you were going to end
[38:47] up,
[38:48] &gt;&gt; you didn't end up
[38:49] &gt;&gt; that way.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; So,
[39:00] &gt;&gt; it's also in the 26th verse that God
[39:02] says, "Let us make man in our image."
[39:06] &gt;&gt; So, the image was put into man in the
[39:08] 26th. So, could it be in the 26 years
[39:10] that image is going to come back again?
[39:13] &gt;&gt; I'm just asking the question.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Could it be in the year 2026 the image
[39:16] shall be back on the earth?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 man back on the earth.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Yes, sir. Glory.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Could it be?
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; We don't know. Could
[39:34] it be
[39:35] &gt;&gt; because the prophet uses what? Psalm to
[39:38] preach the rapture message.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Psalm 27.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; 27. Yeah.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; To preach the rapture message.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; I promise you there's no theologian
[39:47] that'll ever take Psalm 27 to preach the
[39:50] rapture.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:00] Wonderful.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; But before he takes us away, we must
[40:03] come in his image.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me uh put a disclaimer
[40:09] right there. I never said the Lord is
[40:11] coming back in the year 2027.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; You introduce yourself with your own
[40:15] thinking.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; I never said that, right? I'm just
[40:19] putting it out there.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Give the Lord a good
[40:24] clap of praise. Amen.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Now watch here the scripture, right? The
[40:30] Lord Jesus takes the spirit of the Lord
[40:32] God is upon me because the Lord had
[40:34] appointed me. It's you must find your
[40:37] own scripture and start to declare it.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Now watch the scripture how it unfolds.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; He's going to start to preach good
[40:47] tidings to the meek. He's sent to bind
[40:49] up the brokenhearted, to proclaim
[40:51] liberty to the captives, and the opening
[40:53] of prison doors to them that are bound
[40:55] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[40:57] Lord.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus closes the book and he stops
[41:00] reading right then.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; The acceptable year of the Lord is the
[41:02] year of Jubilee.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; He came to pronounce the year of Jubilee
[41:05] that captives can go free.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; CAPTIVES CAME FREE. The Holy Ghost, the
[41:10] supreme intelligence came into man.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Right. Then now you know the prophet
[41:16] also took the book.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. The priest
[41:19] &gt;&gt; gave him books
[41:20] &gt;&gt; and he preaches this day the scripture
[41:22] is fulfilled.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; We are in the second part of the
[41:26] scripture because Jesus closed the
[41:27] scripture and we are now in the day of
[41:29] the vengeance of our God.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; That's why he's called the wicked one.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; The supreme judge, the cloud,
[41:36] &gt;&gt; the wicked one.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; He's appearing as judge. It's judgment
[41:40] to the world but mercy to the bride.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because a judge has
[41:44] potential to proclaim judgment, but he
[41:46] also has potential to proclaim mercy.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; To comfort all that mourn,
[41:53] &gt;&gt; to appoint them. So watch what he's
[41:56] doing now. In the second part of his
[41:57] ministry, he is not. Now, the first part
[42:00] SAID, "I HAVE COME TO do it.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; I have come to SET CAPTIVES FREE. I HAVE
[42:04] COME TO BIND up brokenhearted." But in
[42:05] the second part, IN THE BRIDAL PART of
[42:07] the ministry, he is appointing THEM THAT
[42:10] MOURN IN ZION TO GIVE UNTO THEM
[42:12] BEAUTIFUL ASHES.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; THE OIL OF JOY.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; YES.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Joy is a oil.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; You know, people got scars in their
[42:27] life, they use bio oil
[42:30] &gt;&gt; to get rid of scars.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; The oil of the Holy Ghost can remove
[42:33] scars permanently. Hallelujah.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Internal scars.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; See, the oil of joy for mourning, the
[42:41] garment of praise for the spirit of
[42:42] heaviness that they might be called the
[42:44] trees of righteousness, the planting of
[42:47] the Lord that he might be glorified. And
[42:49] listen,
[42:50] &gt;&gt; and after it makes you have the oil of
[42:53] joy and equips you, now you must do
[42:55] something.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; It always ends with action.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; What must you do? They shall build old
[43:00] ways.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. They shall raise up former
[43:03] desolations and they shall repair the
[43:05] wastities.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; We want God to do everything but he
[43:09] comes to equip us so that we can do
[43:11] things.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; And they shall repair the wastities. The
[43:19] desolation of many generations and the
[43:21] strangers shall feed your flocks. The
[43:24] sons of the aliens shall be your plowman
[43:26] and your vine dressers. And you shall be
[43:28] named the priest of the Lord. I wonder
[43:31] who are kings and priests in this hour.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. After he took the book, he
[43:35] says, "You shall be called kings and
[43:37] priests.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; You shall reign on the earth."
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; You shall be named the priest of the
[43:42] Lord. Men shall call you the ministers
[43:45] of our God.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; You shall prophesy again.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; You know what a priest does?
[43:52] &gt;&gt; He offers sacrifices.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; On behalf of the people.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Now, if you know something about the law
[43:57] of first fruits, it's January. Yes.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; First fruits mean you offer the first of
[44:02] your crop, the first of your finance,
[44:04] the first of your increase back to the
[44:06] Lord.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; So offer back first fruits to the Lord.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Now we are the living sacrifice, holy
[44:16] and acceptable.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; And God wants us to offer our lives back
[44:19] to him
[44:20] &gt;&gt; as a living sacrifice.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; So the first fruit offering is our lives
[44:24] back to him.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Some of you got nervous on I
[44:29] said that first.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; You thought I'm asking you to put your
[44:36] hand in your pocket.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; See, some of you are smiling.
[44:45] You should spend so much on the turkey
[44:46] and the chicken and now school fees and
[44:48] all of these things.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; I never I never ask you for money. I'm
[44:51] saying offer your lives a living
[44:52] sacrifice
[44:54] &gt;&gt; as your first fruit offering back to the
[44:55] Lord.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] Praise the Lord.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Offer it back to him to say, "Lord,
[45:02] &gt;&gt; in the year of Yahweh, you be my Lord."
[45:05] &gt;&gt; You know, some of some of you may be
[45:07] renting and the person is called the
[45:08] land Lord.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; He's the owner.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; He owns that land. He owns that
[45:15] property.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; God is now the owner.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; He is Yahweh.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; He is the owner of my being.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; I just want to end with this now.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul recognized Yahweh
[45:34] &gt;&gt; as Lord.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; When he was struck down, he answered,
[45:36] "Who art thou?"
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, him being a devout Jew
[45:43] would never have called anything by any
[45:45] other name.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Who art thou?" Yahweh.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said unto me, I am Jesus of
[45:54] &gt;&gt; whom thou persecutest.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; That's Acts 22:8. I am Jesus of
[46:00] Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 18:3, Abraham comes to the
[46:07] angels and he he goes to the one in
[46:09] specific and he says, "My Lord,
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. If now I found favor in thy sight,
[46:16] pass not away, I pray thee, from thy
[46:18] servant. Right now, while you are there,
[46:20] I want you to pray this prayer. Lord,
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord,
[46:24] &gt;&gt; if I found favor in your sight, don't
[46:26] pass me this year.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God. Now, I I showed you
[46:33] there. Amen. Three scriptures. Paul,
[46:35] Abraham, I'm showing you the prophet
[46:37] now. He's there in the and he's lost in
[46:39] this uh storm. And the voice speaks to
[46:42] him. says, "I am the God of heaven.
[46:44] That's Yahweh
[46:45] &gt;&gt; who created the heavens and the
[46:46] &gt;&gt; earth."
[46:47] &gt;&gt; I jerked up my hat cap. I just sat
[46:50] still. I listened again. I thought that
[46:52] wasn't the wind.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; it was blowing. Said, "I am the one who
[46:56] still the winds upon the mighty sea.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; I am the one, the creator. I created
[47:00] squittles in your presence. I did these
[47:02] things." I said, "Yes, Yahweh."
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; I believe you.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Said, "Stand on your feet." I stood up
[47:08] to my feet. Now speak to the storm.
[47:13] It will do what you tell it to do.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; I want you to speak into your situation
[47:23] in 2026. And I say to you, it will do
[47:26] &gt;&gt; what you tell it to do.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[47:37] When a man confesses his sins, gets
[47:39] right with God, God drops the sin of
[47:41] this confession into the blood of his
[47:43] own blood.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to confess your
[47:46] sins and bring it before the blood?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he's saying. Now,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; he drops that sin in the confession of
[47:53] his blood and forgives that sin and
[47:56] replaces in that man the original
[47:58] spirit, the Holy Ghost.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; That should be in there,
[48:02] &gt;&gt; his own spirit, making him a son of God.
[48:05] Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; So if you're willing and obedient right
[48:08] now to confess your sin,
[48:10] &gt;&gt; he'll replace that that left because sin
[48:13] is unbelief. A demon will leave you.
[48:15] He'll replace it with the Holy Ghost
[48:17] making you a son of God. And watch it
[48:19] doesn't end there. Now
[48:22] &gt;&gt; how much more are the creative power of
[48:24] God to be in the church?
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; He goes from a sinner if you follow his
[48:29] thought.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit coming into him.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; But then he immediately goes to creative
[48:36] power.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost in you
[48:40] &gt;&gt; is creative power of God.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; How much more of the creative power of
[48:44] God to be in the church, it'll break
[48:46] down every wall.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, you mean pastor, you were saying
[48:51] earlier that I must pray to God to come
[48:53] move Jero walls. Yes. Here he's
[48:55] confirming it.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in you.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. The creative power of God in you
[49:01] will break down every wall.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; So you're not looking for something
[49:05] externally in this time and season.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; You need to look for it from internally.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; The power is internal.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Stop looking for external forces.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; The most powerful internal force is
[49:17] within you.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Watch the very same thing that I'm talk
[49:24] speaking of will be done. There'll be a
[49:26] power put into the church.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And now he's coming in.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. We learn about this
[49:40] anointing that's in us.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Will so anoint the people till they'll
[49:45] speak the word.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; You may have spent the last 40 years
[49:51] telling people how another man spoke the
[49:53] word.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. He's now telling you this same man
[49:56] that you keep quoting is telling you
[49:58] you'll speak the word.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And it will create itself where?
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Right then.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; So which means when I speak I must wait
[50:10] for it to create itself right here.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; It'll create itself right then.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to high grade level faith
[50:19] now.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to perfect faith people.
[50:21] We haven't seen powers like this coming
[50:24] into the church. Now I know it for the
[50:25] fact. Say unto this mountain, be moved.
[50:27] Don't doubt in your heart. Believe what
[50:29] you've said shall come to pass. You can
[50:31] have what you have said. The placing of
[50:33] the church in position. That's why I
[50:35] will label the service an anointing and
[50:37] positioning service. We are placing you
[50:39] in position for the year so that you are
[50:42] not overcome by the situations, the
[50:44] trials, the testings that are in 2026,
[50:46] BUT YOU DOMINATE in 2026.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; The placing of the church in position
[50:58] where the fullness of the power of the
[50:59] Holy Ghost comes into the church. The
[51:01] fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost
[51:03] coming into the church.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; The fullness of the power of the Holy
[51:06] Ghost coming into the church.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You don't need to go anymore
[51:10] and read about Peter and uh John coming
[51:13] to the blind man. It shall be seen in
[51:16] your very own life. AMEN.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; YES.
