[0:00] notice now we're going to read in the
[0:03] Bible in the the seventh seal that's
[0:07] found in Revelations the 8th
[0:10] chapter and when he had opened the
[0:12] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[0:15] about the space of a half
[0:19] hour that's all we have one now we're
[0:24] going to notice I remember after the
[0:27] fourth chapter of Revelations the church
[0:29] is gone
[0:31] after the the uh four harsh Riders has
[0:35] went
[0:36] out church has gone
[0:40] see and then they was Satan and his
[0:44] angels was kicked out and then they come
[0:47] to the earth and the battle set in again
[0:49] because Eve broke down the barrier from
[0:52] where she was uh isolated behind the
[0:55] word of God you believe in God's
[0:58] mathematics you don't you you're sure
[1:00] lost in you'll sure get lost in the word
[1:02] if you start putting a four or six or or
[1:05] something besides this the mathematical
[1:07] words running in order you'll sure have
[1:10] in your seen a cow picking grass on top
[1:12] of a tree somewhere you'll you certainly
[1:15] run out because God does not his whole
[1:18] word does run completely in in in
[1:21] mathematics that's perfect the most
[1:24] perfect there's no other literature
[1:25] written like it like it so perfect in MA
[1:28] mathematics now
[1:30] the the eighth chapter only reveals the
[1:34] scene of uh the scene of the seventh
[1:38] seal where nothing else is revealed not
[1:42] nothing all the way back from Genesis
[1:45] this seven chapter the seven seal is
[1:48] spoke
[1:49] of from the very beginning in
[1:53] Genesis the seven Jesus Christ in
[1:56] speaking himself told of the end time
[1:58] and when he got told all SE six seals
[2:00] when he got the seven he
[2:03] stopped there it is it's a great thing
[2:06] and nowhere through the church age since
[2:10] in the early Apostolic church has the
[2:15] Protestant church ever had a
[2:18] prophet tell me who it was
[2:21] short never but we are promised in the
[2:25] last
[2:27] day that to return to the church again
[2:30] for the benefit of straightening up all
[2:34] that has been Mis Mis undone left undone
[2:38] for it's predicted here that the seventh
[2:40] Angel's message would finish the
[2:43] mysteries of God
[2:45] am now we've went through it all we see
[2:48] that it's perfectly in harmony with the
[2:51] scripture that's the reason now could
[2:53] you imagine when this person comes on
[2:55] the
[2:56] scene when he does remember if it'll be
[3:00] so humble and things the the churches a
[3:03] miss it a long ways if there be one
[3:06] among you who's spiritual or a prophet I
[3:10] the Lord my thy God will make myself
[3:12] known to him and speak to him in
[3:15] Visions through dreams interpret dreams
[3:18] somebody have a dream a prophet will be
[3:20] able to interpret it and if if he has a
[3:23] vision he speaks it I'll make myself
[3:26] known to him through visions and dreams
[3:30] make myself knowing and if what he says
[3:33] comes to pass then hear that Prophet
[3:37] because I'm with you
[3:40] now we'll turn now to the eth
[3:44] verse of the uh of the first verse I
[3:47] mean of the eth chapter Revelation uh
[3:51] 81 we must remember at this seven seal
[3:56] is the end of time of of all
[4:01] things
[4:02] right the things written in the seven
[4:06] seal book sealed up of the Plan of
[4:10] Redemption from before the foundational
[4:13] World it every bit
[4:15] ends it is the end it is the end of the
[4:19] struggling world it's end of struggling
[4:21] nature it's the end of everything in
[4:24] there is the end of the trumpets it's
[4:26] the end of the vials it's the end of the
[4:28] Earth it's a it's even the End of
[4:31] Time Time runs
[4:34] out the Bible said so it's the end of
[4:37] the bows and even in the ushering in of
[4:41] the
[4:43] Millennium that's on the seven seal it's
[4:46] just like firing a rocket into the air
[4:49] and that rocket explodes here and it
[4:51] goes up then explodes again it puts out
[4:54] five stars one of those stars explode
[4:57] and blows out five stars from m
[5:00] and then one of them Stars explodes
[5:02] blows out five stars from mid see it
[5:04] fades on out now how is he going to do
[5:07] it that's what we don't know
[5:10] is we don't know notice the breaking of
[5:14] this seal was so great that heaven was
[5:20] hushed by it in silence for the space of
[5:23] a half
[5:25] hour uh is it
[5:28] great what is it
[5:30] it was hushed Heavens it wasn't a thing
[5:34] move for a half hour when this seven
[5:38] sealed mystery in the book of redemption
[5:41] was broke
[5:42] [Music]
[5:44] open think of it but it's broke
[5:48] amen the land breaks
[5:51] it you know what they were OD by it I
[5:55] mean they didn't know there it was they
[5:58] just stopped why what is it I'm going to
[6:02] tell you in my my revelation of and
[6:07] now uh
[6:09] certain as I stand in the
[6:12] platform
[6:15] tonight uh had the Revelation that
[6:19] revealed it's in a three-fold manner
[6:22] send it there when this left me
[6:25] something has come to me and said Don't
[6:27] Fear now I didn't hear no voice like on
[6:29] inside of me spoke I have to just tell
[6:32] you the truth just exactly what happened
[6:34] something hit and said Don't Fear this
[6:36] is that third pull I was standing with a
[6:40] a little baby shoe when he told me say
[6:42] make your first pull and when you do the
[6:44] fish will run after the lure said then
[6:46] watch your second pool said because
[6:48] it'll only be small fish he said then
[6:51] the third pool will get it and this
[6:53] three great things that goes with it and
[6:56] one unfolded today or yesterday the
[7:00] other one unfolded today and there's one
[7:04] thing that I cannot interpret because
[7:06] it's in an unknown language but stand
[7:09] right there and look right straight at
[7:11] it and this is the third pole coming up
[7:15] amen that's the reason all heaven was
[7:18] silent amen remember the seventh
[7:21] messenger was the seven Messengers was
[7:27] the noted one to me the seventh angel it
[7:30] seemed more to me than any I see they
[7:33] were standing like this and I was
[7:35] standing here and I was watching those
[7:38] other see one first bunch of little
[7:41] birds feathers all beat down you
[7:43] remember them and they all flew
[7:46] Eastward and the second Bunch were
[7:50] brighter bigger birds look like doves
[7:53] pointed
[7:54] Wings they flew Eastward first pull
[7:58] second pull
[8:00] then the next was
[8:02] angels and I was standing right there
[8:04] and this explosion left and I was
[8:07] looking this way towards the west and
[8:08] they come and just picked me up in there
[8:10] and I went PL out of my
[8:13] knowing and then one of them coming was
[8:16] the one that looks so strange to me was
[8:19] the one on my beat the left where I
[8:21] entered the constellation at but
[8:24] counting from the left to the right it
[8:26] would been the seventh
[8:27] angel coming across
[8:30] now remember the seven Messengers do you
[8:34] remember the Pyramid of White Rock now
[8:39] notice this that now when this taken
[8:43] place Junior was standing in a field
[8:45] that had a had a big pyramid to it like
[8:48] that and there was something wrot on the
[8:50] rocks and I was revealing that to the
[8:52] people is that right Junior about a year
[8:55] before it happened and notice the next
[8:57] thing now I took some kind of have a bar
[9:00] and cut it off and on the inside was
[9:02] White Rock that had nothing wrot on it
[9:04] and at that time I started to the west
[9:07] and I told them all I said don't go out
[9:10] west stay here and look on this till I
[9:15] return went West for the blast returned
[9:20] back to the east with the Holy Spirit
[9:25] interpreted this Unwritten word amen
[9:29] Hallelujah now if that isn't perfectly
[9:32] God Almighty I want you to know what is
[9:34] but I know that it was in seven Thunders
[9:38] uttering themselves right close together
[9:40] just banging seven different times and
[9:42] it unfolded into something else that I
[9:45] seen then when I seen that I looked for
[9:48] the interpretation it flew across there
[9:49] and I couldn't make it out that's
[9:52] exactly right the the hour isn't quite
[9:55] yet far amen what happens is is that
[10:00] those seven
[10:02] Thunders that he heard thunder and was
[10:05] forbidden to
[10:07] write that's what the mystery is laying
[10:10] behind those seven consecutive Thunders
[10:12] rolling out now why let us prove it why
[10:17] it is the secret that no one knows about
[10:21] John was forbidding to write about it
[10:23] even even not a symol about it why this
[10:27] is why there was no active in he
[10:31] activity in heaven it might give away
[10:34] the
[10:35] secret do you see it now amen but here
[10:39] is seven straight Thunders Right In A
[10:41] Row 1 2 3 4 5 6
[10:45] seven that perfect number
[10:49] then Heavens couldn't write that Heavens
[10:53] can't know about it nothing else because
[10:55] there's nothing to go on it's a relaxing
[10:58] time you is so great till it's kept
[11:00] secret from the
[11:03] Angels now why if Satan should get a
[11:08] hold of it he might do great damage
[11:11] there's one thing he don't know
[11:15] am if they made one move it might give
[11:17] something away so they just shut up quit
[11:21] harping everything
[11:23] stopped uh seven God's perfect number
[11:28] seven just right down the road seven
[11:32] Thunders utter straight
[11:35] together like you're spelling out
[11:37] something notice at that
[11:40] time John started writing he said don't
[11:43] write
[11:45] it Jesus never spoke of
[11:49] it John Couldn't Write it Angels know
[11:52] nothing about it amen what is it it's
[11:57] the thing that Jesus said said even the
[12:00] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[12:02] about it
[12:04] see he didn't know it himself amen said
[12:08] only God would know it
[12:10] amen now what this great secret is that
[12:13] lays beneath this seal I do not know I
[12:18] don't know it I couldn't make it out I
[12:21] couldn't tell it just what it what it
[12:24] said but I know that it was in seven
[12:28] thunders of UT themselves right close
[12:30] together just banging seven different
[12:32] times but it's moving into that cycle
[12:36] see it's coming up close so the thing
[12:39] for you to do is to remember that I
[12:42] speak to you in the name of the Lord
[12:44] amen hallelujah amen Lord hallelujah and
[12:49] here when the seventh seal when he
[12:51] opened it he also omitted it again see
[12:55] so we see that it is a complete mystery
[12:58] therefore the hour is not yet for this
[13:01] mystery to be known therefore we're this
[13:04] far and the rest of it will be known
[13:07] right around about the time that Jesus
[13:09] appears on Earth again for his bride or
[13:13] whatever takes place at that time now
[13:15] until that time let's just all pray live
[13:18] good straight Christian lives looking
[13:20] forward for his coming now the Vision
[13:24] Plus the word plus the history plus the
[13:27] church ages and all blend together so I
[13:30] could truly say that to the best of my
[13:34] understanding and according to the word
[13:36] of God and the vision and the Revelation
[13:39] the interpretation thereof is thus
[13:42] sayeth the Lord now may the Lord bless
[13:45] you all each one real richly as we stand
[13:49] now and sing uh this good old song of
[13:54] the church God bless you each one
[13:58] amen
