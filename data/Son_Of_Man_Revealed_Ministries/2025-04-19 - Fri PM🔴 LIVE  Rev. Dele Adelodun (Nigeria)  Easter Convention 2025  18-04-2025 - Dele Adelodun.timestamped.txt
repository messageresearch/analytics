[37:21] sin. Give her
[37:24] redemption, but he made you free from

[37:32] stand." But he said,
[37:34] "Nevertheless, let my will be
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:42] done." Oh, redemption.

[38:42] Jesus.

[38:55] pastor Musa

[39:02] to come and pray for the tithe and the
[39:04] offering. But most

[45:21] Is indeed the mighty warrior.
[45:25] is the greatest in battle.
[45:30] How we thank him once again tonight.
[45:32] Amen. May we please bow our heads
[45:36] gracious almighty God, we thank you one
[45:39] more time
[45:41] for this privilege we have to be back in
[45:44] your house.
[45:46] Thank you for what you did for us in the
[45:48] morning.
[45:50] Your love and the hearts of your
[45:51] children to have come back again this
[45:54] evening.
[45:56] We want to pray that you will take us
[45:58] deeper in your love.
[46:01] Please take us higher in your joy.
[46:03] Hallelujah. Let there be surround of
[46:06] your presence.
[46:08] Do wonderfully among us one more time in
[46:12] the name of Jesus Christ.
[46:15] Amen. Amen.
[46:18] God bless you, saints.
[46:20] Please, before you take your seats,
[46:22] let's turn our Bibles to the book of
[46:25] John that we read in the
[46:29] morning. We read at three places in the
[46:32] morning.
[46:34] And uh we are unifying them all under
[46:37] one. Amen. Which is John chapter 19
[46:41] verse 30.
[46:50] John
[46:51] 19 the 30th verse.
[47:00] If you are there say amen. Amen.
[47:04] When Jesus therefore had received the
[47:08] venne, he said, "It is finished." and he
[47:13] bowed his head and gave up the ghost.
[47:16] May the Lord add his blessings to the
[47:19] reading of his holy word. Amen. You may
[47:22] be seated.
[47:33] We thank the Lord for assembling our
[47:36] feet again this evening in his presence.
[47:39] Amen. In the morning we started a
[47:42] subject
[47:44] when the Lord said it is finished.
[47:47] And I told us that three things happened
[47:52] uh from the scripture that we read. Yes.
[47:54] It said
[47:56] uh uh the veil of the temple rented into
[48:00] truth. Yes. Amen. The graves of the
[48:04] saints were opened. Yes. Prepare your
[48:07] entry to resurrection. Amen. Amen. So,
[48:11] and then we also said the bleeding lamb
[48:14] stood before the throne. Yes. To take
[48:18] back the book. Amen. So, in the morning,
[48:22] we showed us how the book got back to
[48:24] the throne. Yes. When Adam fell. Amen.
[48:28] Amen. The prophet said the hand of Satan
[48:31] was too huggly
[48:33] and dirty. Yes. To pick that book. And
[48:37] God wouldn't allow him because the book
[48:41] owes the title to the earth. If Satan
[48:45] ever got a hold of the book, we all will
[48:47] become his tenants.
[48:49] Will become scatters. He will become the
[48:51] owner. Yes. But thank the Lord, he took
[48:55] the book by himself.
[48:57] Hallelujah. And he swept it back to
[49:00] glory. Amen. waiting for such a time
[49:04] until the right price will be paid.
[49:07] The shedding of the blood that brings
[49:10] remission of sin. Amen. Bloods have been
[49:13] shed right from that time till Christ
[49:16] came. Yes. But the problem with those
[49:19] blood is that they were not perfect.
[49:22] They could only cover. They cannot
[49:24] remain.
[49:26] And that is why the saints who died in
[49:29] Christ were still kept in that paradise
[49:33] that them was because nothing was strong
[49:36] to remit their sins
[49:39] and give them access into the presence
[49:42] of the Lord. Amen. And uh that was why
[49:45] Christ came in order to unlock death
[49:49] prisoners.
[49:51] In order to also take the book. Yes. and
[49:54] they give hope to the living. So both
[49:58] the past and the present and the future
[50:00] must be taken care of. Hallelujah. That
[50:03] was when the prophet in uh told us while
[50:07] Christ was in Gethsemane, he said the
[50:09] decision of the cross. Yes. Will
[50:13] determine what you know what will will
[50:17] determine what is going to happen to the
[50:19] past saints. Yes. And it's going to
[50:21] determine what's happening to the
[50:23] present. And it will determine what's
[50:26] happening to the future. The future is
[50:29] you. The present was when Christ was
[50:32] here. And the past was when before
[50:35] Christ came here. Amen. So everything
[50:38] hands upon his decision.
[50:41] And they told us when he said not my
[50:43] will but let the will of the father be
[50:46] done. Hallelujah. And he went to the
[50:48] cross as we have shown us the in the
[50:50] morning. And uh when his blood touched
[50:53] the ground, he declared it is finished.
[50:58] The prophet said, we are starting on
[51:00] that tonight. The prophet said the sins
[51:03] of the past.
[51:04] The sins of the present and the sins of
[51:08] the future were all forgiven.
[51:14] Are you with me?
[51:16] I'm going to make it very flat.
[51:20] The things you will do when you have not
[51:23] done
[51:26] Hallelujah. Show all the failures, all
[51:30] the all the sins you will commit.
[51:33] That you've not committed
[51:35] because you were not here. Amen. God
[51:39] forgive them already
[51:42] before you take
[51:46] And I want that to run deep in your
[51:48] heart. It says, "The sins of the past,
[51:52] that of the present, and those of the
[51:56] future, we are already forgiven."
[51:59] Hallelujah. Let me tell you, Christ is
[52:02] not presently forgiven sins.
[52:05] Amen. That's right. He has already
[52:08] forgiven s.
[52:14] As a matter of fact, the prophet said,
[52:17] everything Christ wanted to do for you,
[52:21] he has already done.
[52:25] That is why if you look at the
[52:27] scripture, every redemptive blessing was
[52:31] written using past tense. Amen. Amen. by
[52:36] his stripes. Yes,
[52:39] you are healed.
[52:43] We've been healed. He said you already
[52:46] healed.
[52:47] The chastisement of your peace
[52:51] has been placed.
[52:53] And let me tell you this was even before
[52:56] Christ came physically
[52:59] because everything took place in the
[53:02] thought of God. Amen. That is why
[53:04] brother Abraham said if you can
[53:06] understand the thought of God, you will
[53:09] understand many things. The thought of
[53:12] God is as real as his word.
[53:17] Amen. You're not getting it. If I think
[53:20] in my heart I will buy this brother a
[53:22] shirt and I never said it out, you know,
[53:26] he cannot hold me responsible
[53:29] because he does not know. Yeah. But you
[53:32] see that is not the way God does. Even
[53:35] if he doesn't know, as long as he
[53:38] conceived it, God holds himself
[53:41] responsible.
[53:43] Hallelujah. So meaning his thoughts,
[53:47] they as real as his word, whether God
[53:51] says it out or not,
[53:55] he makes himself obligated to whatever
[53:58] he thinks. So he cannot change it. He
[54:01] must do it.
[54:04] The Lord
[54:07] by his stripes the chastisements of your
[54:10] peace. Amen. He said those whom he
[54:14] forneew
[54:15] be justified.
[54:17] Those whom he justified he predestinated
[54:21] to be conformed to the image of his dear
[54:24] son. Meaning that even your adoption is
[54:27] a finished work. Amen. You are just
[54:30] here. Amen.
[54:32] You are just here to express what God
[54:35] has already done.
[54:39] And you say, "What must I do?" If God is
[54:41] not presently doing anything, all you
[54:44] need to do is to accept what he has
[54:45] done.
[54:48] And when you accept it, it will become
[54:50] your personal possession.
[54:53] Because God has done it already. That's
[54:55] why the prophet said if Christ were
[54:57] coming here we are here today dressed
[55:00] like you are dressed and you think it
[55:02] gives you uh an advantage to say God is
[55:06] here now I will just walk up to him and
[55:08] say Lord do me this
[55:12] you will never listen to you yes if you
[55:14] will answer you will say what you want
[55:16] me to do I have already done
[55:20] so what a preacher does is to knock out
[55:23] every cloud of unbelief Yes. And doubt
[55:26] from your part so you can walk into your
[55:29] inheritance. The real show you what God
[55:32] has done, not what he will do because
[55:36] everything he wanted to do, he has
[55:39] already done.
[55:43] You must accept your forgiveness.
[55:46] You don't need that audible voice to
[55:49] tell you my son, my daughter, you are
[55:51] forgiven. Amen. If you come by the
[55:54] provided word, if you meet the
[55:56] requirement of the word, knows that the
[55:59] word has come to pass. Hallelujah. He
[56:02] said if we repent and confess our sins,
[56:06] it is just to forgive.
[56:08] Hallelujah. I don't need an audible
[56:10] voice to say, "Son, you are forgiven. I
[56:13] will simply accept my forgiveness. I
[56:16] will simply accept my healing. I will
[56:19] simply accept my blessings." And I start
[56:22] confessing them. And guess what? As I
[56:24] go, the angel of the Lord will go with
[56:27] me to confirm my word prophet.
[56:34] Are you here, church? Amen. So
[56:36] everything he wanted to do, he did.
[56:38] Hallelujah. The sins of the past were
[56:40] forgiven. The sins of the present were
[56:43] forgiven. The sins of the future,
[56:47] they were all forgiven. Amen. Believers
[56:50] live under advanced atonement.
[56:54] [Applause]
[56:55] Thank you, Lord.
[56:59] Amen. And what a blessed ground it is to
[57:02] receive your pardon. Because what the
[57:05] message came to call you to as we're
[57:06] going to show tonight is your genuine
[57:09] atonement.
[57:13] Hallelujah. Your sins are not actually
[57:15] perfectly atoned for until you come
[57:18] under the message of your atonement.
[57:21] Amen.
[57:23] The scripture said, "If you walk in the
[57:25] light, as he is in the light, the blood
[57:29] of Jesus Christ, does what? Cleanses."
[57:33] Is a continuous cleansing.
[57:37] Amen. Hallelujah. The blood of Jesus
[57:39] cleanseth us from all our sins if we
[57:43] walk in the light. Yes. And Zechariah
[57:47] said it shall be light in the evening.
[57:50] There must be a message of light that
[57:53] brings people under atonement. And when
[57:56] they come under the atonement, there is
[57:58] no power. Yeah, there is no force or
[58:02] forces that can destroy them because
[58:05] they have come under the protection of
[58:08] the almighty.
[58:11] You love him tonight.
[58:17] So when it when that took place
[58:20] and he proclaimed it is finished in the
[58:23] morning we said the veil of the temple
[58:26] rented. Amen. Amen. The graves of the
[58:29] saints were opened. And the bleeding
[58:32] lamb stood to take the book. Now these
[58:36] all are connected and we'll see it as we
[58:38] go on. Amen. Now when the book was
[58:42] taken, we're talking about in the
[58:44] morning. Yes.
[58:47] When Okay. when uh when the veil was
[58:49] rented, I meant to say when the veil was
[58:52] rented, the paths to the tree of life
[58:56] was made open again
[58:59] for the believer to go and partake of
[59:01] life. Amen. Now, but that tree of
[59:07] life must be physically restored to us.
[59:12] Amen. In this last days, hallelujah.
[59:15] Amen. Amen. Glory. And what is the path
[59:18] to restoration? Amen. The lamb had to
[59:21] stand before the throne. Yes. To take
[59:25] the book.
[59:27] Amen. And that's what takes us to
[59:29] Revelation 5. If you watch the man
[59:33] sitting on the throne, the Bible said it
[59:36] wasn't comfortable to keep the book.
[59:39] Amen. That it took in Genesis chapter 3.
[59:43] Yes. So for 2,000 years, yes, he was
[59:47] crying and wishing for somebody to come
[59:49] take that book. Amen. You know why?
[59:53] Because the book is not meant to be
[59:55] resident in heaven.
[1:00:00] It's a book meant to be resident here.
[1:00:05] It was by that book Abra Adam proved his
[1:00:08] sunship.
[1:00:10] Amen. I told you in the morning that
[1:00:13] Abraham Adam never needed any support,
[1:00:16] any technology, any civilization to
[1:00:19] live. Amen. And guess what? He lived
[1:00:22] better than we did. Yes.
[1:00:25] With all our technology.
[1:00:28] We don't travel like a thought. Amen. We
[1:00:32] travel distances and count hours. But
[1:00:35] with that book in Adam's heart, if he
[1:00:37] wants to get to Johannesburg, all he
[1:00:40] needs to say, I want to be in
[1:00:41] Johannesburg and he find himself in.
[1:00:45] Amen.
[1:00:47] He doesn't need any assistance. He
[1:00:49] doesn't need any support. He adds the
[1:00:52] power of the spoken word.
[1:00:55] And when that book is fully restored to
[1:00:57] us, that is the realm is taking us to.
[1:01:00] Amen. Amen. All right. So, but this book
[1:01:03] before it can come back to us, it must
[1:01:06] be taken from the hand of him that sat
[1:01:09] on the throne. Amen. Amen. For 2,000
[1:01:11] years, a challenge went forth. Who is
[1:01:14] worthy? Yes. Amen. And for 2,000 years,
[1:01:18] nobody proved worthy.
[1:01:21] Until the lamb paid the price.
[1:01:24] Hallelujah. And his price was accepted.
[1:01:27] Then he stood before the throne. Hey,
[1:01:30] and even the 24 held said worthy is
[1:01:33] alive.
[1:01:35] But because nobody was worthy, John,
[1:01:38] yes, your representation
[1:01:41] in the book of Revelation was crying.
[1:01:45] He was crying for the hopelessness
[1:01:48] that is going to befall human
[1:01:50] generation. If that book wasn't taken,
[1:01:54] if that book wasn't taken, there's no
[1:01:56] need for us to sit here tonight.
[1:01:59] Because there's no real Easter,
[1:02:01] Easter was made possible. And Easter
[1:02:04] came personally to you by the taking of
[1:02:07] the book and the opening of the book.
[1:02:11] Hallelujah.
[1:02:13] Because Easter is to bring back to the
[1:02:15] end of man what he lost in the
[1:02:18] beginning. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] So the bleeding lamb stood there and
[1:02:27] John was so carried away in weeping of
[1:02:31] hopelessness until they couldn't see
[1:02:33] that intervention.
[1:02:35] But thank God for the elders.
[1:02:39] The elders said we not jump.
[1:02:43] Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] And that's what the elders are doing in
[1:02:46] the last days.
[1:02:49] We do not dream of this hour. They are
[1:02:51] not going to show you what God will do.
[1:02:54] They will show you what God has done.
[1:02:58] We do not jump. For the lamb has
[1:03:02] prevailed
[1:03:04] to take the book and to lose the seals.
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:14] Amen.
[1:03:15] If he took the book and did not lose the
[1:03:19] seals, no work done.
[1:03:22] [Music]
[1:03:25] I'm going to show you your history. Now,
[1:03:28] if he took the
[1:03:30] book and didn't loose open the book, no
[1:03:35] work done. Amen. Amen. Amen. You know
[1:03:39] why? Because the content in the book
[1:03:44] has got to be called out.
[1:03:48] Yes.
[1:03:51] They will speak supernaturally.
[1:03:54] Hear their names.
[1:03:57] Hallelujah.
[1:04:01] My So the prevailing lamb took the book.
[1:04:05] Hallelujah. The taking of the book alone
[1:04:09] changed the whole dynamics. Yes. It
[1:04:12] turned it from weeping. Yes. Into
[1:04:15] worship.
[1:04:18] The 24 elders
[1:04:21] who knew the power of that book. The
[1:04:24] Bible said in Revelations 5, they
[1:04:26] started worshiping
[1:04:28] and John waited for them to finish.
[1:04:32] When they finished their worship, John
[1:04:35] took his turn because John being your
[1:04:38] representation, he knew the importance
[1:04:41] of that book.
[1:04:43] He has been through all contracts. And
[1:04:46] he sees himself being redeemed. That was
[1:04:49] the essence of God's designing salvation
[1:04:52] plan.
[1:04:53] Amen. God doesn't want us to be
[1:04:56] worshippers that is so distant. Yes.
[1:04:59] Yes. To the one who is worshiping.
[1:05:03] I told you in the morning. Okay, let me
[1:05:05] put it like this for you. You can enjoy
[1:05:09] light
[1:05:11] but may not appreciate light.
[1:05:14] Yes. Am I confusing you?
[1:05:18] Amen. We can enjoy this light but may
[1:05:22] not appreciate it. You know why? You
[1:05:26] have not seen absence of light and the
[1:05:29] effect of absence.
[1:05:35] But in one day,
[1:05:37] there is a light out
[1:05:40] and you have to grow in darkness even
[1:05:42] with the best eyesight.
[1:05:45] That's right. You can have a very good
[1:05:47] eyesight. But if darkness is everywhere,
[1:05:50] you are not better than a blind man.
[1:05:52] Yes. Right or wrong. That's right. Amen.
[1:05:55] With your eyes without light, you cannot
[1:05:57] move. You will stumble on this, you will
[1:06:01] eat that one. You will get yourself so
[1:06:04] injured. Then you begin to tell
[1:06:06] yourself, "Oh, if there was light now,
[1:06:09] if there was light." So this light is so
[1:06:11] important. Oh, I never appreciate it. Oh
[1:06:14] God, if you can bring back light. Amen.
[1:06:17] Amen. Because you have seen the effect
[1:06:20] of darkness. When light comes back. Yes.
[1:06:24] Yes, you enjoy it with a sense of
[1:06:27] appreciation.
[1:06:33] That was all God was devising in his
[1:06:36] redemption plan.
[1:06:39] It doesn't just worship. It doesn't just
[1:06:41] want worshippers who are not connected
[1:06:43] to him.
[1:06:45] Everybody can sing holy, holy, holy
[1:06:50] and that ends the music. But you will
[1:06:54] differentiate it from a man who comes to
[1:06:56] sing Amazing Grace.
[1:07:00] You know what? He's singing from an
[1:07:02] angle of experience
[1:07:07] and that will unconsciously affect his
[1:07:09] singing where he can tell you once I was
[1:07:13] blind
[1:07:15] but now I see
[1:07:17] because he knew what it means to be
[1:07:20] blind. I now know what it means to see.
[1:07:24] Once I was lost, but now I'm found.
[1:07:30] Praise the Lord. Are you getting it?
[1:07:32] Because he's been through this way. He
[1:07:35] could appreciate what it means to have
[1:07:37] this. That was all God was doing. He
[1:07:41] wanted a worshipper with a sense of
[1:07:43] appreciation.
[1:07:45] That was why it was important for him to
[1:07:48] demonstrate all his attributes
[1:07:51] and that was why he brought Satan in the
[1:07:53] picture. So Satan is not a bad guy after
[1:07:56] all.
[1:08:00] Amen. If all the perfection remains, you
[1:08:04] will never be connected. You will never
[1:08:06] be intimate with God. Yet you could be a
[1:08:09] religious worshipper. Yes. But God
[1:08:12] wanted it from an angle of experience.
[1:08:15] That was why when John took his own
[1:08:17] tongue to worship, read it in
[1:08:20] Revelations 5, every other thing
[1:08:22] stopped.
[1:08:24] And they were listening to John because
[1:08:27] there were songs that John was singing
[1:08:30] that angels couldn't sing.
[1:08:33] Angels will sing holy, holy, holy. But
[1:08:37] when come
[1:08:41] for you
[1:08:43] from here to my
[1:08:46] heart.
[1:08:48] Glory to
[1:08:50] his angels quiet.
[1:08:54] They didn't know what that means.
[1:08:56] They've never fallen. So they didn't
[1:08:58] know what it means to rise again.
[1:09:01] They've never been sick. So they didn't
[1:09:03] know what it means to heal. to give us
[1:09:05] all God's blood to make worippers with a
[1:09:09] sense of appreciation.
[1:09:16] And that was why John became the center
[1:09:20] of worship in Revelations 5. And I guess
[1:09:24] you are the John because when we came to
[1:09:27] that point, I saw your response.
[1:09:31] He covered to the if God was your
[1:09:34] servant and you are the reality you will
[1:09:37] not have
[1:09:38] any act the same.
[1:09:42] Glory to God.
[1:09:46] Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] So the taking of the book created so
[1:09:52] much joy.
[1:09:56] But like we said, if he took the book
[1:10:00] and he never opened the book, waste of
[1:10:03] time. Yes. That's right. Amen.
[1:10:06] Hallelujah. Because the reason he took
[1:10:09] the book is to actually make redemption
[1:10:12] claims. Yes.
[1:10:15] He's got names in the book. That's
[1:10:18] right. He's got characters in the book
[1:10:21] that he must bring to glory.
[1:10:24] Amen.
[1:10:27] Hallelujah.
[1:10:29] Thank you, Lord. So, Revelations 5 began
[1:10:33] to fulfill physically in this last day.
[1:10:36] Hallelujah.
[1:10:39] Is that exactly? Hallelujah. No sir.
[1:10:43] Amen. Amen. But do you ever see where it
[1:10:46] fulfilled in the Bible?
[1:10:47] Hey, Revelation book of symbol.
[1:10:50] Revelation book of prophecy. The
[1:10:53] fulfillment was in this last day. Amen.
[1:10:56] Yes, sir. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. I
[1:10:59] told you I will bring your Easter to
[1:11:01] you.
[1:11:03] Amen. Because this is not Easter of the
[1:11:07] groom. This is the Easter of the bride.
[1:11:13] And this is the way your Easter came to
[1:11:15] you. Amen. That book that was taken and
[1:11:18] began his loosening fulfilled on earth
[1:11:22] in 1963.
[1:11:24] Follow me. Amen.
[1:11:27] Hallelujah. And he took the book. The
[1:11:31] Bible said the job of opening was too
[1:11:34] urgent. Yes. So right in the next
[1:11:38] chapter, Revelation 6, it began to open.
[1:11:42] Amen. He opened. Yes. Seal one, seal
[1:11:45] two, until the seventh one, he opened
[1:11:47] all. I hope there's no dispute there.
[1:11:51] All the sevens were open. Yes, sir. All
[1:11:53] the contents may not have come to pass,
[1:11:56] but according to the scripture, they
[1:11:58] were all open.
[1:12:00] Let us agree on the scripture first.
[1:12:04] And when he had opened the first year,
[1:12:06] and when he had opened the second, and
[1:12:08] when he had opened the third, and when
[1:12:10] he had opened the fourth, did you hear
[1:12:12] it in your Bible? You read it like that.
[1:12:14] And when he had opened the fifth, and
[1:12:16] when he had opened the six in
[1:12:18] Revelations 8:1, and when he had opened
[1:12:20] the seventh, the Bible said he opened.
[1:12:25] Yes, sir.
[1:12:26] So at least we can agree that he opened.
[1:12:30] When we agree on that, we have a good
[1:12:32] foundation.
[1:12:33] Then we can start dealing with the
[1:12:35] content. Amen. Wonderful. Are you here,
[1:12:39] brother? Yes, the job of opening was too
[1:12:42] important.
[1:12:44] That was why immediately he took the
[1:12:47] book. Yes, he started opening.
[1:12:51] What was he doing? And who was he
[1:12:54] opening it to? This is where we are
[1:12:56] coming. Yes sir. He didn't open it to
[1:13:00] everybody.
[1:13:02] There were characters around it opening
[1:13:04] event. Amen. Amen. Christ himself was
[1:13:08] near the lamp. The four living creatures
[1:13:12] were there. The four living creatures
[1:13:14] are the cherubims.
[1:13:16] Amen. Jerobims are the anointing. Yes.
[1:13:19] By which the seven messengers in the
[1:13:22] seven church age dispensation. I'm
[1:13:24] glossing over some things because I'm
[1:13:26] dealing with believers. So I'm riding on
[1:13:29] the effort of your pastors. Amen. So the
[1:13:32] the four living creatures, they are the
[1:13:34] cherubs, the anointing, the power by
[1:13:38] which the seven age messengers worked.
[1:13:41] Amen. In order to prepare a people, to
[1:13:44] call out a people, to get a bride ready
[1:13:49] to resurrect certain people out of
[1:13:52] certain condition.
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:57] Amen.
[1:13:58] Amen. So they were four.
[1:14:02] Amen. But the messengers were seven.
[1:14:05] That's right. Blessed be the name of the
[1:14:07] Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Many
[1:14:09] have attempted you of portioning them
[1:14:11] the way. But if you study the seals, the
[1:14:14] prophet portioned them correctly. So
[1:14:16] don't take any other portioning than
[1:14:18] what the prophet did. Amen. Brother
[1:14:21] Abraham said the first the first
[1:14:24] cherubin with the face of a lion it ran
[1:14:27] from Ephesus down to minor down to
[1:14:31] Pagamos. That was what he thought. I
[1:14:34] know people caught it differently but
[1:14:35] you look at the seals that's what he
[1:14:37] said. Then the second uh Jerob run up to
[1:14:44] you know the that's right the fourth
[1:14:46] age. That was when he operated. Then the
[1:14:49] third one, the face of a man took care
[1:14:51] of Sadis and Philadelphia. Yes. And the
[1:14:54] seventh one and the fourth one which is
[1:14:56] the hele anointing
[1:14:59] took care of this age. So each of this
[1:15:03] living creature has got something to do
[1:15:06] with the opened book.
[1:15:12] Hallelujah.
[1:15:14] Amen. And when he opened the book in its
[1:15:18] entirety,
[1:15:19] now he was opening it in the presence of
[1:15:22] only one person. Amen.
[1:15:25] In the presence of John
[1:15:29] and John was your representation
[1:15:32] as a believer.
[1:15:35] John was the one to be quickened. Yes.
[1:15:38] But John couldn't get the revelation
[1:15:41] of what was opened without the
[1:15:43] mediation. Hallelujah. Of the of the
[1:15:46] living creature, the cherubam pertaining
[1:15:50] to his age. Amen. Amen. That is why if
[1:15:52] you watch Revelation 6 character, it
[1:15:55] said, "And when the lamp had opened,
[1:15:59] even though it was opened, the first
[1:16:01] four seals, when the lamp had opened,
[1:16:04] even though it's been opened, yet John
[1:16:07] did not have an access to the open book
[1:16:11] until one of the cherubimans will say,
[1:16:14] John, come and see."
[1:16:17] Is that the way it was written in your
[1:16:19] life?
[1:16:20] So it was the cherubim that showed John
[1:16:25] what the lamb revealed.
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:30] So maybe before you can see the
[1:16:31] revelation of Jesus Christ, before you
[1:16:35] can get the revelation of the lamb,
[1:16:37] before you can come under your
[1:16:38] atonement, you need to be under the
[1:16:43] cherubim of your head.
[1:16:45] Outside of this, you will never make it.
[1:16:49] That's according to the scripture.
[1:16:52] [Applause]
[1:17:00] Come and see. Amen. So whatever is
[1:17:03] opened will be shown to you. Amen. It
[1:17:07] means that you don't have eyes by
[1:17:09] yourself.
[1:17:11] To decode what the lamb opened. Can you
[1:17:15] see that? Can you see that? Yes. So if
[1:17:18] you tell me to come back to the Bible, I
[1:17:20] need a road map to the Bible. I need a
[1:17:23] guide back to the Bible. The spirit of
[1:17:26] truth in these last days came in a
[1:17:29] messenger
[1:17:30] to do what? To interpret the word to you
[1:17:35] and I. Somebody builds the pillar of
[1:17:38] fire to interpret the word for you and
[1:17:43] her.
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:49] Now we're coming close. Amen.
[1:17:53] Now before this opening event that the
[1:17:56] lamb
[1:17:58] did the lamb when you go back to his
[1:18:01] ministry, he was on earth. Amen. It
[1:18:05] didn't started with the opening of the
[1:18:09] word. No. When he was here on earth in
[1:18:12] his ministry. Amen. It started with
[1:18:15] signs
[1:18:17] and wonders. Is that right? Now, signs
[1:18:20] and wonders are not actually meant for
[1:18:23] the bride.
[1:18:26] It's not a sacred. Don't worry. Signs
[1:18:29] and wonders also will attract the bride.
[1:18:33] But signs and wonders cannot retain the
[1:18:36] bride.
[1:18:40] It can't maintain the bride. Yes, he
[1:18:43] can't retain the bride. He cannot
[1:18:45] satisfy the bride.
[1:18:48] Because
[1:18:50] ordinarily signs and wonders are meant
[1:18:52] to follow the bride.
[1:18:56] The bride is the puller
[1:18:58] of signs and wonders. Signs and wonders
[1:19:02] are not the pullers of the bride.
[1:19:04] [Applause]
[1:19:08] Are you catching me?
[1:19:11] The bride is designed to get something
[1:19:14] greater.
[1:19:16] Amen.
[1:19:18] And that is why there will be the
[1:19:20] generation that will stay just by signs.
[1:19:25] They can move beyond there. Yes sir.
[1:19:28] Amen. They will stay by wonders. But
[1:19:31] something in the bride always call for
[1:19:33] something higher.
[1:19:36] That is why in the message as it was
[1:19:38] with Moses.
[1:19:40] Amen. 62 or 61 somewhere there. The
[1:19:45] prophet said, "We have had great
[1:19:47] manifestations." That's right. Of
[1:19:49] supernatural signs and wonders until the
[1:19:53] brethren are beginning to settle down.
[1:19:56] That's right. Thinking this is all of
[1:19:58] it. That's right. Then he said, "Do you
[1:20:00] remember in the first Exodus?" Yes. That
[1:20:03] there were some two tribes, two and a
[1:20:06] half tribes that got their inheritance
[1:20:08] before Jordan. That's right. And they
[1:20:11] were so happy to stay before Jordan,
[1:20:14] settle down and enjoy their life. He
[1:20:17] said, "But remember, there were some who
[1:20:19] were not comfortable with because their
[1:20:22] inheritance lays across Jordan." Amen.
[1:20:26] The prophet said, "I feel like one of
[1:20:28] them, and as many as are dustminded,
[1:20:33] let us cross over this Jordan and enter
[1:20:37] into our inheritance."
[1:20:39] [Applause]
[1:20:40] Do you feel like one of them?
[1:20:46] So the ministry of Christ began with
[1:20:49] signs and wonders, but signs and wonders
[1:20:52] gather all congregation. Yes, multitude.
[1:20:56] Mixed multitude.
[1:20:58] Different categories of people.
[1:21:01] Hallelujah. And that was why you saw
[1:21:03] those who were so excited.
[1:21:06] They were ready to make Christ king.
[1:21:10] He withdrew from among them. They said,
[1:21:11] "No way." They shattered a old boat.
[1:21:15] That's expensive. To go and look for
[1:21:18] King Jesus. And the Bible said, "Look,
[1:21:21] they were not following him." Yeah.
[1:21:24] because of the word or because of the
[1:21:27] miracles.
[1:21:29] It's in your Bible.
[1:21:32] There were generations like that. They
[1:21:35] enjoy the healing. They enjoy the
[1:21:38] messing discernment.
[1:21:41] And they feel this was all to it. Amen.
[1:21:45] But in the midst of that crowd was also
[1:21:47] the bride
[1:21:51] because everybody was attracted. Yes.
[1:21:54] But the bride are not going to be
[1:21:55] satisfied with that.
[1:21:58] They want something more.
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:02] But watch when the something more began
[1:22:05] to come
[1:22:07] which was Jesus began to sound his
[1:22:10] message
[1:22:12] which the prophet called the dead pool
[1:22:16] that will bring the rainbow trout. Yes.
[1:22:19] From among all sea creatures.
[1:22:22] Yes sir.
[1:22:25] The crowd 5,000.
[1:22:28] Christ had 5,000 one time in his
[1:22:30] convention. In another time he had
[1:22:32] 4,000. And I tell you there could have
[1:22:35] been more than that. You know why?
[1:22:37] Because only men were counted.
[1:22:40] The women were not counted. The children
[1:22:43] were not counted. So that might have
[1:22:45] been 10 to 12,000 crowds.
[1:22:48] What a mighty campaign that was. But by
[1:22:51] the time he started sounding his
[1:22:53] message, the crowd began to think down
[1:22:56] until it came to 70 and 12. No, 701 and
[1:23:01] 11.
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:04] That's right. And he threw another
[1:23:06] thing. Amen. And 70 left. He became 11
[1:23:11] and one.
[1:23:13] The one endured till the cross, but he
[1:23:16] couldn't survive the cross onslaught.
[1:23:20] eventually became 11. Amen. Maybe
[1:23:23] through the cross some people were also
[1:23:26] attracted you know this must be the Lord
[1:23:29] and it became 120 that went to the opera
[1:23:32] room.
[1:23:36] Hallelujah. Out of several thousand. Why
[1:23:40] did he think down to the 120? Because
[1:23:42] the real message the voice behind the
[1:23:46] sign is a separator.
[1:23:51] The voice is only for John, the believer
[1:23:55] of that hour.
[1:24:00] That's right. All those things happened
[1:24:03] to the Jewish and the Samaritan church.
[1:24:06] Amen. Then in the book of Luke 17:30,
[1:24:11] we receive the promise.
[1:24:13] That Christ will not come physically
[1:24:16] but his ministry will be reincarnated.
[1:24:19] Yes. The full ministry of Christ will be
[1:24:22] back. Yes. To take care of the gentile
[1:24:25] church. Amen. So we will not have his
[1:24:28] person but we will have his ministry.
[1:24:31] Yes. So this ministry will be given to
[1:24:34] somebody. Amen.
[1:24:36] to come and project for us.
[1:24:39] The person that find favor in these last
[1:24:41] days to project that ministry was
[1:24:44] brother
[1:24:46] fully vindicated
[1:24:48] without question in our mind regardless
[1:24:50] of all opposition and attack. It won't
[1:24:54] change nothing for the real believer.
[1:25:02] And in order to bring the exact ministry
[1:25:05] of Christ, listen to me. I will crack
[1:25:08] some bones now. In order to bring the
[1:25:11] exact ministry of Christ, Christ has to
[1:25:14] give him his exact ministries.
[1:25:19] So it's a unique healing ministry
[1:25:22] that comes with meic discernment.
[1:25:28] Did you hear me? Amen. We have a lot of
[1:25:31] impersonators
[1:25:33] calling themselves discerners but they
[1:25:36] are impersonators. Yes. Discernment as a
[1:25:39] gift of the spirit is the ability to
[1:25:42] judge between right and wrong.
[1:25:46] That's what the word says. Are you with
[1:25:49] me? Amen. There is nobody
[1:25:53] that would demonstrate messianic
[1:25:54] discernment outside of the messenger of
[1:25:57] this day.
[1:25:59] I repeat, nobody but the authority of
[1:26:02] the revealed world.
[1:26:05] Hallelujah. That is why the ones that
[1:26:08] are proclaiming it and getting you
[1:26:10] attracted and walk over, they were doing
[1:26:12] it with margins of error. The prophet
[1:26:15] said, "We don't accept a gift with
[1:26:18] margins of error."
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:23] Because the reason for me gift is to
[1:26:27] identify Messiah.
[1:26:31] By the time the prophet finish his
[1:26:33] ministry, he said, "Christ has been
[1:26:36] thoroughly identified before you."
[1:26:38] That's the quotation. Hallelujah. Rest
[1:26:41] has been thoroughly identified. Why do
[1:26:44] we need it to be reidentified?
[1:26:46] Hallelujah.
[1:26:48] [Applause]
[1:26:50] The prophet said your pastors will never
[1:26:53] be able to demonstrate this. Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] It is given to holy one person who is
[1:26:58] not under a son. Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Let me
[1:27:06] tell you that discernment ministry
[1:27:10] wasn't even a gift of William Brown.
[1:27:12] Hallelujah.
[1:27:14] Thank you, Lord. It was the exact
[1:27:16] preserved ministry of Christ. The reason
[1:27:20] he operated it was because Christ said
[1:27:23] he will not be here physically. Yes.
[1:27:26] Amen. Yes. And according to Luke 17:30,
[1:27:30] the Gentiles must enjoy every blessing
[1:27:34] like the Jews and the Samaritan enjoy.
[1:27:37] That was why God looked for one man. He
[1:27:41] gave him all. That is why Christ
[1:27:44] ministry has three faces.
[1:27:46] Healing, discernment, and the opening of
[1:27:50] the word. That is why the prophet
[1:27:52] ministry must have those three faces.
[1:27:54] Yes. Healing which is sign in the hand.
[1:27:58] Discernment ability to tell the secrets
[1:28:02] of the heart and the breaking of the
[1:28:04] open book.
[1:28:11] I repeat the prophet said your pastors
[1:28:14] can do it. I know impersonators will go
[1:28:17] far. James and James went far. Read it.
[1:28:21] For everything Moses produced, they were
[1:28:22] producing up to the fourth plague.
[1:28:26] Did you hear me? Read your Bible. Up to
[1:28:29] the fourth plague. Yes. It was on the
[1:28:32] fourth they burnt out. Yes. That's
[1:28:35] right. Amen.
[1:28:38] Hallelujah.
[1:28:40] Yes. Amen. Amen. So God to fulfill
[1:28:46] Revelation 6, Revelation 8, Revelation
[1:28:49] 10. Yes. in these last days to bring the
[1:28:52] event that took place there to reality.
[1:28:55] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. He got somebody.
[1:28:59] Now while the prophet while the Lord was
[1:29:02] in his ministry of signs and wonders, he
[1:29:05] had the crowds that were moving him
[1:29:07] around. Part of the crowd were those who
[1:29:10] put pamprons and everything singing Oh
[1:29:12] Zam as he made entry to Jerusalem.
[1:29:16] Unfortunately, they were the same crowd
[1:29:18] who shouted crucify him.
[1:29:21] Everything they enjoyed never mixed with
[1:29:23] faith in their house. Amen. All the punk
[1:29:27] revivalist Yes. eventually became the
[1:29:30] crucifier.
[1:29:34] Amen. All right. So when the prophet
[1:29:38] came for the ministry to do tail, yes,
[1:29:42] the signs and wonders aspect of the
[1:29:45] ministry was also accepted by all. Amen.
[1:29:49] Do you realize that it was said the
[1:29:51] prophet rounded the world seven times?
[1:29:54] South Africa was among the countries
[1:29:56] that he came India and the rest of them
[1:29:59] and the brothers were telling me
[1:30:01] yesterday and that that sounds very
[1:30:03] great. They said it is only there are
[1:30:05] only two countries the prophet gave
[1:30:08] missionary report on India and South
[1:30:10] Africa. What a pleasant people you are.
[1:30:16] Hallelujah.
[1:30:18] Amen. Now, the money that took him
[1:30:22] around were the monies of the
[1:30:24] Pentecostals
[1:30:26] and the full gospel businessman.
[1:30:28] Did you realize that? Amen. Because that
[1:30:31] was the face of the ministry. That's
[1:30:33] right. But gradually as that ministry
[1:30:36] came to a climax,
[1:30:38] you know, the prophet preached Christ is
[1:30:40] the mystery of God revealed. And he said
[1:30:42] at 2:00 a.m. 2:00 p.m. on the door.
[1:30:45] That's right. He said the second pool is
[1:30:47] over and the third pool is beginning.
[1:30:52] Saying it's over does not mean that we
[1:30:54] will not still have messianic
[1:30:56] discernment. But it has lost uh the
[1:31:00] position of the attraction.
[1:31:03] Are you getting it? Healing was the main
[1:31:06] phase. Discernment became the main
[1:31:08] phase. But now, yes, from this point,
[1:31:12] the opening of the word, because you
[1:31:15] know why Christ was ready to make
[1:31:18] redemption claims,
[1:31:21] he was ready to call his John out of the
[1:31:25] crowd,
[1:31:27] the congregations that was attracted,
[1:31:29] the good, the bad, the ugly, the
[1:31:32] believer, the unbeliever, the make
[1:31:34] believer, all kind of people from among
[1:31:36] this ground. God is ready to separate
[1:31:46] and that was why
[1:31:48] in 1962 the prophets preached the
[1:31:51] message end times sign
[1:31:55] you read that message in that message
[1:31:58] what was it doing was addressing what
[1:32:00] looks like a crisis of the hour yes
[1:32:04] because something took place when the
[1:32:06] bridegroom was to be burned. Three stars
[1:32:09] appeared. We call them in geographic
[1:32:12] planets. Amen. And when they aligned and
[1:32:15] they came as one, astrologologist will
[1:32:17] tell you something supernatural will
[1:32:19] take place on the earth. And it actually
[1:32:22] did took place. Yes. Christ was born.
[1:32:25] Amen. And those magi, they follow the
[1:32:28] direction of that planet as it moves in
[1:32:31] its channel. And where it eventually
[1:32:34] dropped proved to be the birthplace
[1:32:37] where Christ was born. But in 1962,
[1:32:42] a new announcement happened. Amen.
[1:32:45] Hallelujah. It wasn't three this time
[1:32:48] around. It was five stars. Yes. Now
[1:32:52] three is the number of God when it
[1:32:54] aligns to one but five is the number of
[1:32:57] grace and that is the number of his
[1:33:00] bride. So a lot of people including
[1:33:03] scientists were explaining what
[1:33:06] happened. Then the prophet came back to
[1:33:08] the church. He said you have had all
[1:33:10] kind of explanations. He said now let me
[1:33:13] give you the truth.
[1:33:17] And what is the truth? He linked it back
[1:33:20] to the three stars that appeared when
[1:33:22] our Lord was born. He said this being
[1:33:25] five is an announcement that a bride is
[1:33:28] in its infancy.
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:31] It's ready to be made manifest.
[1:33:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:36] And February 1963, seven angels came
[1:33:39] down
[1:33:46] to do what? Amen. To call the bride
[1:33:51] out of loudness.
[1:33:54] Amen. By what? By the open breath.
[1:34:00] So what the lamb did in Revelation 6 is
[1:34:03] about fulfilling on the earth. Amen.
[1:34:07] You getting it?
[1:34:08] That was why before the prophet preached
[1:34:10] the message seven seals,
[1:34:13] he preached God hidden and revealed in
[1:34:15] simplicity
[1:34:17] to show to the people that these great
[1:34:20] things we read, mighty angel, one leg on
[1:34:23] the water, one leg on the sea, one leg
[1:34:25] on the land, they aren't going to happen
[1:34:28] like you are reading them because
[1:34:30] revelation is a book of symbol. This
[1:34:33] thing will go on and happen in its
[1:34:35] simplicity.
[1:34:38] until it will run over the edge of great
[1:34:42] intellectuals.
[1:34:44] Are you following? Then the next message
[1:34:47] was the bridge. Yes. Oh my. I love the
[1:34:52] message on the bridge. The bridge
[1:34:54] between the seven church ages and the
[1:34:57] opening
[1:34:58] of the seven seals. The seven seals
[1:35:01] haven't been opened, but God is forming
[1:35:04] a bridge. If you understand that topic
[1:35:07] alone,
[1:35:10] it's your redemption.
[1:35:12] Let's understand the topic. Amen.
[1:35:16] God is creating a junction
[1:35:19] of turning between seven church ages.
[1:35:23] Yes. And the opening of the seven seals.
[1:35:26] Yes. If you form a bridge, a gap in
[1:35:29] between. Yes. A gap stands in between
[1:35:31] the end of one thing Yes. and the
[1:35:34] beginning of another.
[1:35:36] Is that right? The seven church ages was
[1:35:39] ending. Yes. And the new dispensation is
[1:35:43] beginning.
[1:35:46] Yes. Amen.
[1:35:48] Are you catching it? Laia was ceasing.
[1:35:53] There are those in those life condition
[1:35:56] will cease. Yes.
[1:35:59] Amen. Hey, are you projecting another
[1:36:02] age? Come down. I'm not projecting
[1:36:05] another age and I'm projecting another
[1:36:08] age.
[1:36:11] Amen.
[1:36:13] Is it an eighth age? No. Is it an age
[1:36:17] inside an age? Yes.
[1:36:20] Because that follows the types of the
[1:36:23] scripture.
[1:36:25] Amen. Yes, sir. Yes. So, I've answered
[1:36:29] your concerns. So, relax and enjoy the
[1:36:32] Lord.
[1:36:34] In the hour of Exodus,
[1:36:37] the conditions always change.
[1:36:40] Go was in Egypt. Is that right? But in
[1:36:43] the hour of Exodus, the condition of Go
[1:36:48] and that of Egypt was no longer the
[1:36:51] same.
[1:36:55] Because God was ready to call out his
[1:36:57] church.
[1:37:00] His people out of the nation.
[1:37:03] Hallelujah.
[1:37:04] And this last day must be against the
[1:37:08] first.
[1:37:10] Amen. In the second exodus, God was
[1:37:13] calling a church out of religion. In
[1:37:16] this last days, he's calling a bride out
[1:37:19] of the church.
[1:37:24] All the conditions must out. The Bible
[1:37:28] said in the first episode there was
[1:37:31] darkness in Egypt
[1:37:33] but there was light in
[1:37:36] in
[1:37:38] it will seem like Goan and Egypt were
[1:37:41] two different places. Amen. Go was a
[1:37:44] town in Egypt but in the hour of Exodus
[1:37:48] God separated Exodus people.
[1:37:52] from the conditions of Egypt.
[1:37:55] [Applause]
[1:37:57] That is what I'm saying. So the nation
[1:38:00] was made out of the nation
[1:38:07] in this last days when the full word of
[1:38:10] God was born into manifestation. Amen.
[1:38:14] The same drought that has carried the
[1:38:16] messenger all over the world, it started
[1:38:18] pushing back. That's right. What was the
[1:38:20] condition of loudia?
[1:38:22] When we read loudia, where did we find
[1:38:24] Christ?
[1:38:26] Outside. Christ is the revealed word. He
[1:38:30] was thrown outside. And when you drop
[1:38:33] Christ outside, you lose every article
[1:38:36] of redemption. That was when Laesia went
[1:38:40] into oblivion. Lesia became wretched,
[1:38:44] naked, poor.
[1:38:46] I am so bright and on top of it amia
[1:38:52] in that condition nothing good can
[1:38:55] drive. So God must come and call us
[1:39:00] out of that condition.
[1:39:03] That is your Easter.
[1:39:10] [Applause]
[1:39:14] He called us by the open book, the
[1:39:17] revelation of the word. That was when
[1:39:20] that full word was made manifest. In
[1:39:23] 1963,
[1:39:24] everybody rejected the prophet. To
[1:39:27] reject the messenger is to reject his
[1:39:30] message.
[1:39:33] You hear me? They pushed him out. And
[1:39:37] there was another call. And the prophet
[1:39:40] said, "If I called you out and I do not
[1:39:43] have a place to take you, he said I've
[1:39:45] done a poor job. That is why I will call
[1:39:48] out the prophet call it a resurrection
[1:39:52] out of that denomination
[1:39:54] into the glorious age of the cloud."
[1:39:58] Say, "God supernaturally,
[1:40:00] come out another economy." Out of now
[1:40:04] this year, inside loud this year.
[1:40:08] Amen. But these people who will live in
[1:40:11] that economy will take the council of
[1:40:14] God and will never be covered by every
[1:40:18] condition of La. So today in Laian age
[1:40:22] there are people who are not blind. You
[1:40:25] are not related. You are not related.
[1:40:29] You are not
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:32] miserable because of your
[1:40:41] open is your resurrection. That is the
[1:40:44] history that we are celebrating. that
[1:40:48] God brought us out of the dead.
[1:40:51] [Applause]
[1:40:58] Let me prove it further to you
[1:41:04] in the message recognizing your name and
[1:41:07] it message. How many of you ever are
[1:41:09] ready?
[1:41:11] Let's fellowship a little. Yes. The
[1:41:14] prophet said right now people are coming
[1:41:17] for revival.
[1:41:19] Did you ever read it? I said fast, pray,
[1:41:22] fast, pray. It's not too late yet. We
[1:41:25] got to have the breaking of the day.
[1:41:28] This that and the other. Brown says will
[1:41:31] they preach? Will they preach any
[1:41:33] magazine without a call to fast and
[1:41:36] pray? That's right.
[1:41:39] Amen. The prophet said, "Why do they do
[1:41:41] that?" Yes. In 1964,
[1:41:44] when something has taken place in 1963,
[1:41:48] why were they still doing that? He said,
[1:41:50] being Christians, they feel they feel.
[1:41:53] Yes, sir. The pull of the house. That
[1:41:57] something has to be taken place. You
[1:42:00] know why? That child that was born from
[1:42:04] Jubilee, Amen. Amen. 50 years in 1956.
[1:42:10] Yes. And for the next 6 to seven years,
[1:42:14] hallelujah, God used the prophet to go
[1:42:16] around the coast of all the lines where
[1:42:20] those jubilees, you know, we celebrated
[1:42:22] where they happened. Yeah. Go stud the
[1:42:25] messages. And he was preaching several
[1:42:27] messages like Jubilee year, this that
[1:42:29] and the other. The last one they
[1:42:31] preached was return in Jubilee. And in
[1:42:33] that message, he was saying time has
[1:42:35] come for the old fighters to give way.
[1:42:39] Yes. so that the children of light can
[1:42:42] come into the inheritance.
[1:42:44] It was very prophetic.
[1:42:50] You know why? Because in the bridge that
[1:42:53] was at Kadesh. Amen. The reason for the
[1:42:57] bridge, it was a bridge of 40 years.
[1:42:59] It's a bridge of time. The reason for
[1:43:01] that bridge was because of unbelief. And
[1:43:05] God told Moses, "I will respect you."
[1:43:08] Yeah. You don't want me to kill
[1:43:09] everybody as one man, but I will kill
[1:43:12] them in in gradually for the next 38
[1:43:17] years from Kadesh in Kadesh. All those
[1:43:20] old people who say we cannot make it.
[1:43:23] They were all wiped out. That was the
[1:43:26] scripture of the prophet that old
[1:43:28] fighters have to give way so that the
[1:43:30] children of light, those who believe
[1:43:32] they can make it can move into the
[1:43:35] inheritance. Because the last day must
[1:43:38] be to the first read your Bible. The
[1:43:42] journey never resumed until all those
[1:43:45] people died. Yes. Amen.
[1:43:50] So brother had to go through the coast
[1:43:53] of all those places of revival. Yes. And
[1:43:56] the final message must return in
[1:43:58] Jubilee.
[1:44:00] Then in 1963, seven angels came down
[1:44:03] gave the commission for the open for the
[1:44:06] book to be opened. What took place in
[1:44:08] Revelation 68 and 10 to be fulfilled
[1:44:12] upon the earth. Amen. Yes, sir. In order
[1:44:15] to liberate the children of the light,
[1:44:18] to come out from the ground. Amen. After
[1:44:21] they were liberated, some were still
[1:44:23] singing fast and pray. You know why?
[1:44:26] because they lived on milk for too long.
[1:44:30] 50 something years old, still on milk.
[1:44:33] He's not cracking cold. He's not eating
[1:44:36] salsa. He's not eating all those other
[1:44:39] food, rice and everything. You going to
[1:44:41] kill that child because his orans are
[1:44:44] too developed for those level of meal.
[1:44:48] Amen. That is what brother said. Amen.
[1:44:50] Good Christians, he felt the pull of the
[1:44:53] hour. But he said what they were asking
[1:44:56] for had already taken place.
[1:45:01] And they didn't know it.
[1:45:05] Oh God. Hallelujah. Then he began to
[1:45:09] tell. He said, "Oh Jerusalem, yes. Oh
[1:45:12] Jerusalem,
[1:45:14] how long will I have over you? As end
[1:45:16] over our prophet was in Los Angeles
[1:45:19] preaching." Yes. And he turned around.
[1:45:23] He said not in any way, not in any way
[1:45:26] becoming Christ. But you see, you know
[1:45:28] why he has to do that? He carried the
[1:45:30] ministry of Christ. Yes.
[1:45:32] Jesus did the same thing on his road to
[1:45:36] crucifixion. Yes. Amen. The sin must
[1:45:39] repeat for the Gentiles. And he said,
[1:45:43] "Oh, not in any way acting like Christ,
[1:45:47] but it continues." He said Los Angeles,
[1:45:51] you that were called by the name of the
[1:45:53] Lord. Los Angeles became the symbol of
[1:45:56] the destruction of the earth like
[1:45:58] Jerusalem was there. He said, but your
[1:46:01] hour has come.
[1:46:04] Yes. You have missed. And they told the
[1:46:07] people, he said, remember,
[1:46:10] he said, my name is on it. Amen. He
[1:46:13] said, I do believe this age is past
[1:46:15] redemption. Yes. Amen. He said you can
[1:46:18] call it my opinion, you can have yours.
[1:46:20] Glory what I'm saying is there. And he
[1:46:23] said it has passed it some few years
[1:46:25] back. Yes.
[1:46:27] Amen. What happened few years back.
[1:46:31] Amen. Yes. In Chicago was when we had
[1:46:36] another showdown of 400 prophets of B.
[1:46:39] That's right. Come on church.
[1:46:43] You want to see your redemption. Amen.
[1:46:45] We have those vow prophets gathered
[1:46:47] again to do what? To challenge the
[1:46:51] message of the hour.
[1:46:56] Just and it's an opportunity to settle
[1:46:59] lingering doubt. Yes. In the minds of
[1:47:02] the people because Elijah asked, "How
[1:47:05] long would you linger between two
[1:47:07] opinions?" Yes. If God become
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] the one who answer by fire, he will be
[1:47:17] our God.
[1:47:21] The one who answer by fire, let him be
[1:47:24] our God.
[1:47:26] Amen.
[1:47:28] So in these last days, there's no point
[1:47:32] lingering between two opinion.
[1:47:35] Is either right or wrong. Yes.
[1:47:38] Amen. And those guys gathered and they
[1:47:41] tried to kind of brought it in a
[1:47:43] deceptive manner. He said, "We want
[1:47:46] fellowship."
[1:47:47] And they send somebody to bring
[1:47:49] invitation. I hope I can still go a
[1:47:50] little while.
[1:47:53] They sent somebody with an invitation.
[1:47:55] He said, "You are close to him. Go
[1:47:58] entice him to come." But they don't know
[1:48:00] who they were dealing with.
[1:48:04] They don't know that is a person of
[1:48:06] interest in the kingdom of God. Yes.
[1:48:08] Anytime you mention his name, yes, God
[1:48:12] must appear.
[1:48:14] So God saw through everything they were
[1:48:16] discussing. And before the brother could
[1:48:20] come, God visited the prophet and told
[1:48:23] him what happened. And he said, "Don't
[1:48:25] worry, you go. I will be with you."
[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:30] And the brother brought invitation.
[1:48:32] Amen. He said, "Brethren, I really they
[1:48:34] really appreciate you. They want to have
[1:48:35] fellowship with you." And brother said,
[1:48:38] "You are my friend, right?" He said,
[1:48:41] he said, "Let us say I cannot make that
[1:48:44] meeting. Can you please stand for me?"
[1:48:47] He said,
[1:48:48] "Brother, he said, it is you the one."
[1:48:51] He said, "But my friend, I've stood for
[1:48:52] you in many meetings. The ones you can
[1:48:55] attend, we ask me to come and have done
[1:48:57] that for you. Do this for me." He said,
[1:48:59] "Brother Brown, it is you the one."
[1:49:00] Amen. And the prophet told him, he said,
[1:49:02] "I expect you to speak like that. Uh,
[1:49:05] they really don't want me." They wanted
[1:49:08] a showdown.
[1:49:10] How did you know? But you just told me
[1:49:13] they want me for fellowship. Amen. You
[1:49:15] are asking how I knew. So, don't worry.
[1:49:18] When that day come, they chose uh golden
[1:49:22] tulip. What are the hotels here? Amen.
[1:49:25] Do you have
[1:49:27] rain hotel?
[1:49:29] You have protein. Okay. They choose
[1:49:31] protein hotel, but they're not going to
[1:49:34] use protein. They will use
[1:49:37] marriott. Brother, we've already paid.
[1:49:41] The prophet said, I don't care whether
[1:49:43] you've paid or not.
[1:49:49] Then when that day come, brother so and
[1:49:51] so we sit in this position.
[1:49:55] This will be the color of his shirt.
[1:49:57] This will be the color of his tie. And
[1:49:59] this will be the color of his suit.
[1:50:00] Brother so and so. Brother so and so.
[1:50:02] Brother so and so. Amen. He said, "Don't
[1:50:04] worry. I'll be there." Amen. So when the
[1:50:06] day came, the managers of your hotel
[1:50:09] suddenly realized somebody paid early.
[1:50:11] Yes.
[1:50:13] Before they paid and they said, "Don't
[1:50:15] worry, we've got it all covered. We
[1:50:17] can't give you project, but we've
[1:50:19] arrived
[1:50:21] because the Lord can never
[1:50:28] When they go to marry us, the brother
[1:50:31] was careful to watch all the brothers
[1:50:34] the prophet mentioned. He saw them
[1:50:36] dressed and seated
[1:50:40] where he said they will sit. Hallelujah.
[1:50:43] The man became afraid. So as the program
[1:50:47] was about started, he said, "Excuse me,
[1:50:50] brethren." That's right. Before you call
[1:50:52] the prophet, before you call brother,
[1:50:54] let me say something, I want you to know
[1:50:58] that brother knows what he's talking
[1:51:00] about and he's not afraid of any of you
[1:51:04] because he told me we are not going to
[1:51:07] use protein. We will use Marriott. We
[1:51:09] are inside Marriott now. He told me you
[1:51:13] will sit where you are sitting.
[1:51:15] This will be the cover of your shirt.
[1:51:17] Exactly what you are wearing. you.
[1:51:19] Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. I think that
[1:51:21] was a messy enough
[1:51:24] to somebody who will be sober and think
[1:51:27] of his soul. But they still threw the
[1:51:30] challenge. And the prophet came out and
[1:51:34] used the opportunity to open up the
[1:51:37] blessings that we know.
[1:51:39] The message of the harbor. Of course,
[1:51:42] these people were scared of putting him
[1:51:44] on their pulpit, but now they had an
[1:51:47] opportunity to hear. Yes. Amen. And when
[1:51:51] they finished, he said, "If there be any
[1:51:53] among you who could come up and
[1:51:55] challenge this by your Bible, please
[1:51:58] come out." Amen. Reverend, nobody came
[1:52:00] out.
[1:52:02] So believe the son is wasting his time
[1:52:04] today.
[1:52:07] Their fathers never came out.
[1:52:11] It's too late for them to make any
[1:52:13] noise.
[1:52:14] These things were not done in the
[1:52:16] closet. They were done in the open.
[1:52:19] Hallelujah.
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:24] And when nobody came out, the prophet
[1:52:26] said, "You see, you had an opportunity
[1:52:28] now, but you never did." You see that?
[1:52:32] So from today, lay off my back. Amen.
[1:52:35] And after the service, all of them came
[1:52:37] and said, "We didn't realize that that's
[1:52:39] the way it is. In fact, we are coming to
[1:52:42] be rebaptiz
[1:52:45] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:52:48] We will buy all these gifts and send to
[1:52:51] our people." Then the prophet waited for
[1:52:55] them for some years. They never came.
[1:52:59] Then they brought the message
[1:53:00] indictment. Yes.
[1:53:04] Yes. We following those messages and the
[1:53:07] message indictment. He said, you
[1:53:09] remember those folks said they were
[1:53:11] coming. That's right. But they never
[1:53:13] came. Yes. Because the price is too
[1:53:16] great. He said, but do you know what
[1:53:19] they have done?
[1:53:22] Yes. Do you want me to tell you what he
[1:53:24] said they did? They committed
[1:53:26] unpardonable sin. Yes. That's what the
[1:53:28] prophet said. Yes. He brought Hebrews
[1:53:31] chapter 2 and chapter 6. Yes. Amen.
[1:53:34] Because unparalleled sin means you get
[1:53:38] the truth.
[1:53:40] You acknowledge it is the truth. But you
[1:53:44] refuse it and refuse to walk in it. Here
[1:53:47] is your unpardonable sin. That's right.
[1:53:50] Amen.
[1:53:52] Amen. Hallelujah. And he said from that
[1:53:55] moment they represent Laodesia and Laian
[1:53:59] churches that lost the articles of
[1:54:02] redemption. Yes. He said no denomination
[1:54:05] can never come as a group to accept the
[1:54:08] light again. They lost it. That was why
[1:54:11] that was 63. That was why in 64 he
[1:54:14] pronounced them past redemption.
[1:54:17] So we are still getting excited by
[1:54:19] Pentecostalism. Something is
[1:54:22] wrong. Right. Amen.
[1:54:27] Glory. 100%. So we receive the message.
[1:54:31] Yes. That it was that resurrected us out
[1:54:36] of that dead condition. That has brought
[1:54:40] us into an economy. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:54:43] Praise the Lord. Where all things are
[1:54:44] possible. Amen. That is why it was
[1:54:46] important for the lamb. Amen. The
[1:54:49] bleeding lamb to stand and take the
[1:54:51] book. Yes. Are you catching it? He took
[1:54:54] the book in Revelations 5. In Revelation
[1:54:57] 6 and 8, he opened the book. Amen. In
[1:55:00] Revelation 10, he had the book
[1:55:02] completely open.
[1:55:05] Is that still the message?
[1:55:08] Amen. Amen. And when he had it
[1:55:11] completely open, Revelation 101.
[1:55:14] Amen. Amen. When he had it completely
[1:55:18] open, he was looking for a man. Yes.
[1:55:21] That's right. a faithful steward.
[1:55:24] An elazza.
[1:55:27] That's right. And uno. Amen.
[1:55:30] Amen. Who is not going to inject his
[1:55:33] [Applause]
[1:55:35] thoughts? Who will say like Apostle Paul
[1:55:39] that which I receive from the Lord
[1:55:43] the same I deliver.
[1:55:46] Yes sir.
[1:55:48] Huh. Amen. There was somebody in this
[1:55:51] day who said I was not the one that
[1:55:54] appeared at I was only there. I was only
[1:55:57] the person there.
[1:56:03] Praise the Lord. I was only the person
[1:56:06] there. You are not feeding on me because
[1:56:10] a man is what will fail. For you are
[1:56:14] feeding on the unfailing body
[1:56:17] of the son of man.
[1:56:21] One man said it in this day. Oh God. So
[1:56:25] as God began to search in Revelation
[1:56:28] 107. Amen. He found one man. Amen. He
[1:56:33] said, "But in the days
[1:56:36] of the voice,
[1:56:39] Amen. of the seventh angel.
[1:56:42] when it shall begin to serve. Yes.
[1:56:46] [Applause]
[1:56:49] The mystery. Just one mystery. No, no,
[1:56:53] no, no. No mysteries. Yeah.
[1:56:57] This is it.
[1:56:59] Revelation 7. It didn't say mysteries.
[1:57:03] So don't look for two, three, four
[1:57:04] Bibles.
[1:57:07] This is the mystery of God.
[1:57:10] Amen.
[1:57:12] should be finished
[1:57:15] as he has declared to his servants the
[1:57:19] prophet. This is the declaration of the
[1:57:21] prophet. Hallelujah. Everything in here
[1:57:24] from Genesis to Revelation should be
[1:57:26] completed. Amen.
[1:57:30] Hallelujah. Glory. And friends
[1:57:36] when the messenger completed it.
[1:57:39] Yes. He cannot keep it to himself.
[1:57:44] The completion wasn't meant for him.
[1:57:46] Yes. Amen. That's right. It's not a
[1:57:50] sacment, friends.
[1:57:52] Amen. Beyond anything, brother Abraham
[1:57:55] knew his purpose. Yes.
[1:57:58] Hallelujah. His purpose is that of
[1:58:01] exposure. Yes. Bringing in contact.
[1:58:06] That's right. The bride. Yes. And
[1:58:09] agroom. Yes. Once that is established,
[1:58:13] it must decrease. Yes.
[1:58:17] Amen. And the groom must increase.
[1:58:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:58:23] Are you here? Let me tell you, the
[1:58:26] messenger of this age did not decrease
[1:58:29] for a five-fold minister. Hallelujah.
[1:58:32] Hallelujah. For those of you who have
[1:58:35] several Joshua, you're just a confused
[1:58:38] man. Amen. How can a greater decree for
[1:58:41] decrees for the lesser?
[1:58:44] When John decrees, he decrees for
[1:58:46] somebody greater than him. Amen. Simple
[1:58:50] scripture.
[1:58:52] He said, "This man is so great, but you
[1:58:54] are not worthy to untie the lace of his
[1:58:57] feet.
[1:58:59] There is no five-fold minister that is
[1:59:02] greater than the prophet Messenger.
[1:59:07] No.
[1:59:10] None will send to you and to the angel
[1:59:13] of love this year
[1:59:16] not angels as of many. So with Abraham
[1:59:21] the messenger will never decrease for a
[1:59:24] lesser man.
[1:59:26] Who was a product of his own ministry.
[1:59:28] No sir.
[1:59:31] Hallelujah.
[1:59:33] Yes sir. You are saying Joshua Moses
[1:59:37] never decreases for Joshua
[1:59:40] perish that thought. Do you know Joshua
[1:59:44] lived under Moses
[1:59:46] throughout his life? Even when Moses was
[1:59:49] not physically present, did Joshua bring
[1:59:52] a fresh revelation?
[1:59:54] Did he have a fresh understanding?
[1:59:57] Even to the division of the land, it
[2:00:00] didn't according to what Moses,
[2:00:03] what was the commandment to Joshua? He
[2:00:06] said this word of the Lord
[2:00:09] that the Bible called Moses. Do you know
[2:00:12] that the Bible called Old Testament
[2:00:14] Moses? Yes. He said wherever Moses is
[2:00:17] being raised
[2:00:22] shall not depart from your mouth. Amen.
[2:00:26] And let me float with you. If you think
[2:00:28] it was a big man, then Joshua means
[2:00:31] Jehovah savior. Amen. So Moses decrees
[2:00:35] for Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah. Uh-huh.
[2:00:40] Uhhuh. Amen. Whichever way suit
[2:00:43] yourself. Amen. I've given you something
[2:00:45] to cry. Hallelujah. But you know what
[2:00:47] friends? When he said I must increase
[2:00:51] and he must increase. It is the ministry
[2:00:54] of the seventh angel
[2:00:57] giving way to the full ministry of
[2:01:00] Christ himself. the ministry of the
[2:01:03] seventh angel of loud desire. Amen. That
[2:01:06] was why even when he decreased, he never
[2:01:09] lived until 65.
[2:01:12] Amen.
[2:01:15] Did you realize that? Amen. When John
[2:01:18] decreased, he left the sin. God has got
[2:01:21] no two people to do the job. He was
[2:01:25] first a messenger to Laian age. Yes.
[2:01:28] Then he carried the ministry to the
[2:01:30] bride because the ministry of the
[2:01:32] seventh angel to Lesian age cannot
[2:01:35] produce the bride. My
[2:01:38] it is the full ministry of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:41] Amen. The ministry to Lesia was first
[2:01:44] and second pool. That's right. That was
[2:01:46] why when the third pool which is the
[2:01:47] opening of the Lord was ready, Lesia
[2:01:50] rejected it. And God still used the
[2:01:53] messenger to do what? to bring the full
[2:01:55] mystery revealed unto who? Unto the
[2:01:59] John, the bride of this hour. For the
[2:02:02] last three years, we were dealing with
[2:02:04] the open book.
[2:02:07] And when brother Brown was able to
[2:02:09] establish that contact between the
[2:02:12] heavenly bridegroom and the heavenly
[2:02:14] bride, he preached the message invisible
[2:02:17] union and he said, "It's my thanksgiving
[2:02:19] message.
[2:02:22] My purpose is accomplished. I've been
[2:02:25] able to bring the bride and the groom in
[2:02:27] contact. So I must take the backstage
[2:02:30] whereas they take the center stage and
[2:02:32] consumate their relationship.
[2:02:37] The marriage has been done. It's the
[2:02:40] wedding supper we are going for.
[2:02:44] [Applause]
[2:02:47] Hallelujah. By the way, by the way, in
[2:02:52] the Eastern marriages,
[2:02:54] do you
[2:02:55] realize even according to the Old
[2:02:57] Testament law,
[2:03:00] after a marriage is
[2:03:02] performed, before there can be a
[2:03:04] reception or a wedding feast, there must
[2:03:07] be consolation.
[2:03:09] Uhhuh. Do you realize that? Do you re
[2:03:13] You don't know. Okay, I'm showing you.
[2:03:15] Go back to the Old Testament. Yes. The
[2:03:17] father of the bride will furnish a room
[2:03:20] for consummation. Amen. The outcome of
[2:03:23] consummation will determine whether
[2:03:25] there will be a wedding feast or a
[2:03:27] funeral. Amen.
[2:03:30] Amen. Amen. Read your Bible. Yes, sir.
[2:03:33] It is sounding sacrilege.
[2:03:35] If the woman is made pure, there'll be
[2:03:38] wedding feast. The man comes out with a
[2:03:41] token of virginity. Yes. And it's handed
[2:03:43] over back to the father of the bride.
[2:03:45] Amen. as an evidence of the chastity of
[2:03:49] a do of his daughter. Yes. But if the
[2:03:51] man comes out and said there's no token
[2:03:54] Amen. the the ceremony will become
[2:03:58] sober. Who did it? Amen. Under what
[2:04:00] circumstance? Yes. And you have been
[2:04:02] stoning a funeral. Yes. That is eastern.
[2:04:07] Christ is marrying us in an eastern way.
[2:04:10] Amen. That is why after we said I do,
[2:04:13] Amen. is cultivating with us. Amen. In
[2:04:17] order for us to bring forth
[2:04:20] [Applause]
[2:04:22] must reproduce the life of Jesus Christ
[2:04:26] on two feet.
[2:04:30] And that is why we qualify you and I for
[2:04:33] the wedding feast.
[2:04:36] Are you with me, brethren? This is why
[2:04:39] he brought us into the secret place.
[2:04:43] We came out of loud Asia. We got into
[2:04:46] the bride age. A secret economy that is
[2:04:51] not governed by the conditions of
[2:04:53] loudness. In here, what are we doing? We
[2:04:56] are feeding on nothing. Yes. But the
[2:04:59] open book. Yes. That was why in
[2:05:02] Revelation 10:8, John was commanded.
[2:05:05] Yes. To go do what? Take the book.
[2:05:09] From the hand of him. Yes.
[2:05:12] from the hand of the mighty angel. Do
[2:05:15] you know why it's like that? Because the
[2:05:17] seventh angel made no contribution.
[2:05:20] There was no addition. There was no
[2:05:23] subtraction. So these last days, the
[2:05:25] seventh angel brought us an opportunity
[2:05:28] to fit directly from the hands of Jesus
[2:05:32] Christ. Hallelujah. It is not a
[2:05:34] creature. It is not a dogma. It is not
[2:05:37] the understanding of men but the pure
[2:05:40] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:05:45] What a job he did that he made us fell
[2:05:48] in love with Christ that we have not
[2:05:50] physically sent.
[2:05:53] Didn't Rebecca fell in love with Isaac
[2:05:56] that he had never met?
[2:05:59] You know
[2:06:00] why did a perfect job? Yes. Whenaz went
[2:06:04] to Rebecca, he went with the message
[2:06:07] revelation of Isaac. Yes. And by the
[2:06:10] time he preached that message, the
[2:06:12] picture of Isaac was so clear to Rebecca
[2:06:16] till she fell in love. Have you seen
[2:06:19] Christ physically today? You haven't
[2:06:22] seen him, but you have fallen in love.
[2:06:25] You can even die for him. Thank God for
[2:06:27] our
[2:06:29] thank God for the voice of the seventh
[2:06:32] angel.
[2:06:36] Hallelujah.
[2:06:38] And as we feed on these blessings. Amen.
[2:06:42] We are becoming what we are eating. It's
[2:06:45] so sweet to us, isn't it? He said it
[2:06:47] will be sweet in your mouth, bitter in
[2:06:50] your belly. The professor does your
[2:06:52] digestion. Amen. When the word becomes
[2:06:54] you and you become that oil. The life
[2:06:57] that you produce is going to quake the
[2:06:59] kingdom of the devil and there will be
[2:07:01] reaction. That is the bitterness. But
[2:07:04] don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. This
[2:07:08] is why Christ died.
[2:07:11] Do not be afraid. It is your Easter.
[2:07:15] It's your opportunity to give an
[2:07:17] evidence that Christ is not dead. He is
[2:07:21] alive. Hallelujah. It is your
[2:07:23] opportunity to give the proof of his
[2:07:27] resurrection.
[2:07:29] Don't be afraid because John must
[2:07:32] prophesy.
[2:07:35] The Bible says so. The testimony of
[2:07:38] Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy.
[2:07:41] You won't leave here without giving an
[2:07:43] evidence that that same Christ of 2,000
[2:07:47] years ago is alive. Amen. God bless you.
[2:07:52] [Applause]
[2:08:13] Hallelujah.
[2:08:15] Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:08:26] Amen. Let's all
[2:08:31] Amen. It's already done.
[2:08:35] Amen. The highest thing to accept is the
[2:08:38] sovereignty of God. Amen. Amen. It's
[2:08:41] already done.
[2:08:43] Family come we sit together
[2:08:47] before we ask our elder pastor general s
[2:08:52] he's still there to come and
[2:08:55] close. Amen. Isn't the lord good?
[2:09:00] Amen. How many love his presence?
[2:09:04] How many
[2:09:05] [Applause]
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:16] people get behind their head and come to
[2:09:21] due season. Amen. I can't wait for the
[2:09:24] climax. I know we had a seven course
[2:09:27] meal today. Hallelujah. Amen. And I
[2:09:29] can't wait to go a little higher
[2:09:31] tomorrow. How many is coming back
[2:09:33] tomorrow?
[2:09:35] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:38] It's already done.
[2:09:41] He's going to do it. It's all Let's all
[2:09:45] sing together. We're going to talk to
[2:09:47] the Lord all together after that. Amen.
[2:09:52] It's
[2:09:56] already fighting.
[2:10:00] The battle
[2:10:02] is fight. The victory is won. It's
[2:10:08] already done.
[2:10:12] [Music]
[2:10:16] It's already done.
[2:10:22] It's already done. It's already done.
