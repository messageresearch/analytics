[59:44] him right
[59:48] you know what is
[59:52] I can preach that one awesome even if

[59:58] toilet because inference stands for
[1:00:01] Generations yes
[1:00:04] what is being invested in this church in
[1:00:07] you yes by Pastor only
[1:00:10] stands for Generation
[1:00:13] you can see
[1:00:16] it's amazing
[1:00:23] do you think you as a very very bad kid
[1:00:26] to sacrifice something and God was not
[1:00:29] him about that but what
[1:00:32] he was a God-fearing King
[1:00:34] watch the influence
[1:00:37] it came from his father who was his
[1:00:39] father
[1:00:41] and his father
[1:00:43] he was a considering King
[1:00:46] in his interest he called it from
[1:00:48] somewhere so his father was his father
[1:00:51] he said to us
[1:00:52] but to us
[1:00:55] but it responds for Generations yes so
[1:01:00] in the work in reference is excited it
[1:01:03] is fun for Generation but where
[1:01:06] Authority is excited it won't last amen
[1:01:11] all of you are working maybe
[1:01:15] when the blessings of it is
[1:01:33] he was preaching the true message of the
[1:01:37] hour amen let that true messages
[1:01:41] what was preaching his pass for
[1:01:43] Generations better than
[1:01:48] if you use Authority
[1:01:52] the children they said okay he's here
[1:01:56] because you are there
[1:02:04] they give you a nickname
[1:02:08] when you're dead because they said oh
[1:02:11] he's coming
[1:02:12] it's okay
[1:02:15] you see
[1:02:18] that day you know
[1:02:21] because Authority is being excited
[1:02:24] that we're influence real influence is
[1:02:27] excited hey
[1:02:30] it's responsible Generations
[1:02:32] in your children
[1:02:35] it's harmful I can take that in the
[1:02:38] Bible and show you yes that's why the
[1:02:40] prophet said in the message in France
[1:02:43] influence about Abraham Lincoln
[1:02:46] what happened Abraham Lincoln Abraham
[1:02:49] Lincoln his influence he got it from his
[1:02:52] mother she was a Godly mother
[1:02:57] and that mother was teaching
[1:03:01] amen
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:20] together
[1:03:23] is better than Authority you know
[1:03:26] sisters
[1:03:27] you know what the prophet says
[1:03:30] he says we've got four bushels
[1:03:33] much look John and
[1:03:37] yes
[1:03:40] but see the fifth one
[1:03:43] his mother amen
[1:03:46] yes amen
[1:03:49] not that your preachers
[1:03:53] no
[1:03:57] not that your preachers
[1:04:00] your children
[1:04:02] is the gospel
[1:04:04] He said Out The Gospel you know sisters
[1:04:12] can you teach your children how to talk
[1:04:15] oh
[1:04:20] the father teaching the children the
[1:04:22] child in the top but the mother knows
[1:04:25] how to do it because he is in them
[1:04:27] that's why he said Mother's time
[1:04:30] Mother's Day that's why the prophet to
[1:04:32] his mother's day are in their church
[1:04:35] amen so we want the innocence of the
[1:04:37] Holy Ghost here to spans for Generations
[1:04:41] that's when the near church start
[1:04:43] started the way it dependencies
[1:04:46] inside the kitchen you're still here

[1:05:04] point yes that it wasn't sure from the
[1:05:08] beginning he passed himself from that
[1:05:10] time why because the influence stands
[1:05:13] for Generations amen amen
[1:05:28] it just flows
[1:05:31] I've noticed
[1:05:35] [Music]

[1:05:48] there's people being magnetized
[1:05:51] oh you might be the message from that
[1:05:54] victory
[1:05:56] it says oh you might be is she but love
[1:06:00] unless you are magnetized
[1:06:03] put the power of them and said and the
[1:06:08] confirmed of his power by the amen
[1:06:15] this
[1:06:18] this God is going to switch it on Amen
