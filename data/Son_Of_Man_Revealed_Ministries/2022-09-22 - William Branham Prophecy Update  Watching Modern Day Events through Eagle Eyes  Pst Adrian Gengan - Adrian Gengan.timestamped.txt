[0:00] from verse 1 and after these things I
[0:03] saw another Angel come down from heaven
[0:05] having great power and the Earth was
[0:08] lightened with his glory
[0:11] and he cried mightily with his strong
[0:13] voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen
[0:15] is fallen and it's become the habitation
[0:17] of devils
[0:19] and the old of every fouled Spirit and
[0:22] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[0:24] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[0:27] wine of a rush of our fornication and
[0:29] the kings of the Earth have committed
[0:31] fornication with her and the merchants
[0:33] of the Earth are West Rich through the
[0:35] abundance of her Delicacies
[0:38] and I heard another voice from Heaven
[0:40] saying come out of all my people that
[0:42] you be not partakers of her sins and
[0:45] that you receive not of her plagues amen
[0:48] you may be seated the Lord at blessings
[0:49] to the reading of his word amen on the
[0:52] first slide even just for our title we
[0:54] can be speaking this morning amen now
[0:56] this evening watching modern day
[0:59] events through eagle eyes
[1:02] amen watching modern day events through
[1:04] eagle eyes
[1:06] when the Ancients called Leticia the
[1:09] Metropolis it was looking forward to the
[1:12] One World Government
[1:13] that we are now setting up the One World
[1:17] Government is not a conspiracy theory
[1:19] this is the prophet of God telling you
[1:21] that there is coming a one-world
[1:23] government
[1:26] amen so when the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:29] is talking about a One World Government
[1:31] we are not talking about a conspiracy
[1:33] theory
[1:34] you have seen things unfold before your
[1:37] very eyes of how they can take control
[1:39] of the entire world
[1:41] some of us have considered that a
[1:43] conspiracy theory
[1:45] amen until it will get so much so that
[1:49] you'll get swept up into the mark of the
[1:50] beast
[1:51] because you are thinking everything is a
[1:53] conspiracy theory
[1:56] the Bible is not a conspiracy theory
[1:58] amen it is called the New World Order
[2:02] and they said that after covid-19 it set
[2:04] the platform for a new world order
[2:07] all the economies of the world could be
[2:10] reset amen now here's the Pope
[2:14] vote calls for a one-world government
[2:17] whether we just read they go back a few
[2:19] slides brother Caleb when the Ancients
[2:22] call later Sia and talking about their
[2:24] legacy in church called it later seer
[2:27] they were looking for a one-world
[2:30] government
[2:31] and he says that we are now setting up
[2:36] okay so go back to that slide you see
[2:40] in the face of the pandemic the pope is
[2:43] calling for a one-world government
[2:47] here's what he says Pope Francis spoke
[2:50] of the need of all nations of the world
[2:52] to submit their governmental powers to a
[2:56] reformed and more powerful United
[2:58] Nations in the hope of leading a
[3:01] one-world government to benefit all
[3:03] mankind
[3:06] yeah they Pope in 2020 speaking but a
[3:09] prophet had spoken back in 1960.
[3:14] using the exact same word of One World
[3:17] Government
[3:18] who is this man
[3:21] it's the son of man
[3:23] amen
[3:24] not only did he make the statement
[3:28] that all nations of the world to submit
[3:31] their governmental powers
[3:32] you know what that means
[3:34] every government must surrender their
[3:37] power
[3:38] through this one world government
[3:41] did you notice that during the pandemic
[3:44] whatever was being processed from the
[3:47] World Health Organization
[3:49] was being administered throughout the
[3:52] countries of the world it wasn't one
[3:55] country excluded
[3:57] but they all had to conform
[3:59] not only now who is this revelation 13.
[4:03] everybody agreed this man speaking about
[4:07] the Roman Catholic Church
[4:10] the Beast whose deadly wound was healed
[4:13] amen everybody together
[4:16] let's go to the next Beast that arises
[4:18] from there and hear what he is saying
[4:20] and this is now Biden whose slogan is
[4:23] built back better the only way you can
[4:26] build that better is if you reset
[4:28] something and you rebuild it now listen
[4:31] to what he says and now is a time when
[4:33] things are shifting there's going to be
[4:35] a new world order out there
[4:37] and we've got to lead it
[4:40] when she speak with the voice of the
[4:43] Beast amen amen so he's saying we've got
[4:45] to lead it we've got to unite the rest
[4:48] of the Free World in doing it
[4:50] yay scripture being unfolded before our
[4:52] very eyes and that is why we're tackling
[4:55] it watching more than if they events
[4:58] through eagle eyes
[5:00] okay you will know that this was being
[5:03] administered through the world economic
[5:05] Forum a very important Forum that's
[5:07] being held in Davos every year when the
[5:10] world leaders gather together and their
[5:13] slogan is this you'll owe nothing and
[5:16] you'll be happy
[5:18] anybody want to be a part of that
[5:20] movement to own nothing and you'll be
[5:23] happy
[5:24] but look at how cheerful the guy is
[5:28] okay and funny enough on that top
[5:30] quality if you can see it somebody put
[5:33] the inscription there The Fifth
[5:34] Dimension
[5:35] do we know what is coming out of that
[5:37] fourth dimension
[5:39] okay
[5:41] here is the leader of that world
[5:43] economic forum and his name is cross
[5:45] Klaus Schwab is a German right so he's
[5:49] the leader of the world economic Forum
[5:50] I'm going into a point with this
[5:53] he says the pandemic represents a rare
[5:56] but narrow window of opportunity to
[5:58] reflect reimagine and reset our world
[6:03] right who is Klaus Schwab he is the
[6:06] founder and executive chairman of the
[6:09] world economic forum
[6:12] but this great reset and This Global
[6:14] reset
[6:16] the brains behind it is a man who has
[6:19] come into power just last week
[6:22] [Music]
[6:24] we know him as Prince Charles
[6:26] yeah
[6:28] many people think that the British
[6:30] government like we had Boris Johnson and
[6:33] Margaret Thatcher that they run the
[6:35] country
[6:36] but they have to report back to the king
[6:39] or the queen
[6:40] the king of the queen has the authority
[6:42] to fire any of them
[6:44] to change any laws or bills that's
[6:47] passed in the parliament
[6:48] the King has the ultimate Authority
[6:51] so we see this guy called Prince Charles
[6:55] he was known as Prince Charles
[6:58] remember God is a god of order things
[7:01] don't happen on the earth for for no
[7:04] reason
[7:05] things are happening according to God's
[7:08] plan and his purpose amen so who is
[7:11] cloud Schwab they are they've got a
[7:14] young economic forum
[7:17] and their trained world leaders from
[7:20] that world leaders training they have
[7:23] taken two people and placed them as
[7:25] presidents
[7:27] they come out of this world economic
[7:29] forum and you'll see them with radical
[7:31] ideas
[7:33] these two men you'll see them there
[7:35] Trudeau and macron one is the president
[7:39] of France one is the president of Canada
[7:43] right you see them in the next slide
[7:45] moving with the
[7:47] Beast
[7:49] he symbolizes the Beast right but they
[7:53] have one agenda one goal what are they
[7:56] doing trying to set up a one-world
[7:59] government
[8:00] trying to get the rest of the world to
[8:02] unite with it
[8:04] but there's one man who stood in their
[8:06] way
[8:09] and his name is Trump
[8:12] because he's not from the political
[8:14] system
[8:17] and he is he is uh agenda is America
[8:20] first
[8:22] not all become one he says no no no you
[8:25] guys take care of yourselves
[8:27] we put America first
[8:29] he's a true American
[8:32] so this one man stood in the way of
[8:34] their plan
[8:36] and that is why you will see events like
[8:40] last month what happened everybody know
[8:42] what happened last month
[8:44] they raided Trump's house in Florida
[8:48] never been done in the history before
[8:50] that an FBI raids the house of a
[8:52] president
[8:53] former president
[8:55] what are we saying
[8:58] listen to what the news is saying
[9:01] the far right is calling for Civil War
[9:04] after the FBI raid on Trump's home
[9:06] experts say that fight won't look like
[9:09] the last one
[9:11] foreign
[9:14] Airlines Americans predict second Civil
[9:18] War after FBI raid on Donald Trump's
[9:21] Florida home
[9:24] when is this going to happen
[9:27] if they steal this election again when
[9:29] is the next election 2024
[9:38] okay
[9:39] 2024 is the next election
[9:42] so that happened in August
[9:45] there is something sinister about it
[9:49] amen
[9:52] they are changing the order of the U.S
[9:54] causing unrest in the country
[9:58] but you've got to watch with eagle eyes
[10:02] because in the moment in the twinkling
[10:04] of an eye things can change
[10:07] you remember when we told you that
[10:09] things the world can change overnight
[10:10] and it did
[10:13] watch amen look did anyone predict that
[10:17] the Queen of England would die
[10:20] the death of a queen
[10:23] amen the one that ruled through from
[10:26] 1952 she was here in the days of the
[10:29] prophet
[10:32] the prophet prayed for her father
[10:35] you remember the prophet prayed for King
[10:37] George that was a father
[10:40] multiple sclerosis and he was healed
[10:46] here is what the queen represents this
[10:49] is a title now a most excellent Majesty
[10:52] Elizabeth II by the grace of God the
[10:56] United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and
[10:59] other Realms and territories Queen head
[11:02] of the Commonwealth she is supreme
[11:04] governor of the Church of England and
[11:06] defender of the faith
[11:11] the queen is the head of the England
[11:12] church church of England what is the
[11:15] Church of England it's the Anglican
[11:16] Church
[11:17] amen they represent the most powerful
[11:21] Church
[11:24] now there's a new King in town
[11:29] and in yeah Elizabeth II was Queen of
[11:32] the United Kingdom and of other
[11:34] Commonwealth Realms in from 6 February
[11:37] 1952 until a death in 2022
[11:41] she was Queen region of 32 Sovereign
[11:44] States during a lifetime
[11:46] and 15 during a time of death
[11:49] so we are seeing now it was announced
[11:52] last week you know September 8th The
[11:55] Queen Is Dead
[11:58] September 6th another queen was born
[12:01] catch that but The Queen Is Dead and
[12:05] long live the king
[12:07] reach the headlines
[12:09] but Daniel 2 and 21
[12:12] must come into consideration when he
[12:14] says he changed the times and the
[12:16] seasons he removed things and he set it
[12:21] up Kings
[12:24] what was the aim to set up a one world
[12:26] government
[12:28] watch the political realm change
[12:32] amen watch everything change in the
[12:34] world
[12:35] now remember the last title of the king
[12:37] or queen is defender of the faith
[12:41] that is defender of the Christian faith
[12:44] that title was given to by the pope to
[12:48] King Henry
[12:51] the pope gave him that name because they
[12:54] so fiercely defended the Christian faith
[12:57] and any king must become a defender of
[13:00] the faith
[13:04] now here is the
[13:06] this is what he said the pandemic his
[13:08] chance to reset the global economy says
[13:11] Prince Charles this is when he was still
[13:13] addressing the
[13:15] World economic Forum you'll see in the
[13:18] next picture he's sitting there the
[13:19] crown next to him watching The Purple
[13:21] Crown now remember my point I just made
[13:24] now he's supposed to be the defender of
[13:27] the faith watch now that he comes into
[13:29] power watch his first statement that he
[13:31] makes
[13:33] King Charles says I will protect all
[13:36] faiths not just Christianity
[13:41] watch how they come with satility now
[13:44] Queen Elizabeth stood firm she was
[13:46] defender of the faith
[13:48] you watch your make statements regarding
[13:50] Christianity and of faith in God
[13:53] here comes a shyster
[13:56] King Charles
[13:58] I will protect all faiths not just
[14:01] Christianity
[14:03] does it sound familiar
[14:05] remember when we preached one word
[14:06] religion
[14:08] and we showed you how the pope was
[14:09] moving
[14:11] trying to unite the religions of the
[14:12] world
[14:15] he says the new head of the Church of
[14:17] England tells his person of his personal
[14:20] commitment to Christianity Judaism Islam
[14:24] Buddhism and other religions
[14:28] they are working right in line with that
[14:31] Pope
[14:33] Queen Elizabeth may have soon firmed
[14:36] maybe shouldn't want to bend
[14:38] but he has a man that was trained
[14:41] coming to power
[14:44] amen
[14:47] on the next one this is very important
[14:49] because of the one of the quotes we're
[14:51] going to read this is the list of the
[14:53] wealthiest religious organizations
[14:58] watch on top of the great Orthodox
[15:00] Church
[15:02] and it's worth 700 billion US dollars
[15:06] notice the second one is the only season
[15:08] Vatican and there's no amount now you
[15:12] ask me if there's no amount after they
[15:14] put him second
[15:15] [Music]
[15:16] laughs
[15:20] his country is a Vatican City and his
[15:23] religion you see there Catholicism
[15:26] Christianity how come the list of
[15:28] wealthiest religious organizations every
[15:31] one of them if you look on the right
[15:33] hand side there is Christianity
[15:35] not one other religion no
[15:37] the Muslims don't even feature here
[15:41] you see how Abraham's seed is blessed
[15:44] even the wild seed because they're
[15:47] coming under their blessing under their
[15:49] anointing look at that church of the
[15:52] Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints
[15:54] Church in Germany Church in France
[15:56] church in Australia Seven Day Adventists
[16:01] look at that that type of brilliant you
[16:03] call them what
[16:05] now if you have to take all of that
[16:07] Catholic money
[16:09] and you tie it together and you count
[16:10] all of that who holds the wealth of the
[16:13] world
[16:14] but where did we hear that
[16:18] somebody told us these things amen
[16:21] amen
[16:23] what did he tell us
[16:25] he told us to follow the money
[16:30] aren't you glad that we had a prophet
[16:33] amen amen a prophet told us to watch
[16:35] certain things
[16:36] and he said when you see these things
[16:38] coming to pass then watch it's about
[16:40] time for the Rapture of the church
[16:44] now if they're going to reset Global
[16:46] economies
[16:48] you think that they would
[16:50] they'd want to lose out can you imagine
[16:52] let me give you an example of what I'm
[16:54] trying to say now the church the
[16:57] Catholic church in South Africa holds
[16:59] their funds in South Africa they
[17:01] invested in Banks here
[17:03] it's not held in the Vatican Bank
[17:06] the Catholic church in France will all
[17:09] their money in France
[17:11] now if economies of the world start
[17:12] crashing what's going to happen to the
[17:14] vatican's money
[17:16] if the economy of South Africa crashed
[17:19] what will happen to the money in our
[17:20] banks the vatican's money
[17:22] it will be gone everybody agrees
[17:27] everybody get my thoughts
[17:30] but the prophet says watch the money
[17:36] what are we speaking about watching
[17:38] modern day events through eagle eyes
[17:43] you see we watch sometimes you read the
[17:45] news and we think I just they just rated
[17:47] Trump's house
[17:49] they uh the queen died Charles came in
[17:53] unless you look through the eyes of the
[17:55] prophet and what he said you will never
[17:56] catch modern day events
[17:58] and what's transpiring let's go
[18:02] here's a quote he's preaching he says
[18:05] now Jacob as you come up now the first
[18:08] thing you know he got a longing to go
[18:10] back to the Homeland
[18:12] right oh that's exactly what Israel has
[18:15] done Jacob is Israel he just has his
[18:18] name changed you know
[18:20] he's getting to a point now he says he
[18:23] got out there and he got all the money
[18:26] he had
[18:28] second
[18:30] watch I broke down that quote in colors
[18:32] now he got all the money he had and all
[18:36] and he could get
[18:38] and he took it any way he could
[18:43] and when we come to
[18:44] three rights where he took all the money
[18:47] he could
[18:48] this writer
[18:51] from his skin folks and anybody else
[18:54] he's typing it with Jacob now how we
[18:56] deceive Laban
[18:58] and now he gathered all the money to try
[19:00] and entice Esau
[19:03] I mean if you remember that story
[19:05] so watch he got all the money he had and
[19:09] he could get and took it any way he
[19:12] could from his kinfolks or anybody else
[19:15] so cheating stealing lying anyway could
[19:20] get it he got it
[19:24] what she's using a natural attack now
[19:26] but follow his thought
[19:28] he's talking about someone else and he
[19:30] says and watch
[19:32] this is where he tells us to follow the
[19:33] money now
[19:35] watch the money
[19:38] the money proposition
[19:40] just like the now he's making an example
[19:43] he's saying it's just like the Jew will
[19:45] try making this Covenant with Rome see
[19:47] in their money proposition
[19:49] Esau doesn't didn't need the money and
[19:53] neither does wrong
[19:55] you know
[19:57] she got the wealth of the world in her
[20:00] hand
[20:01] they can have zero there when they're
[20:03] trying to show us the wealth of the
[20:04] Catholic Church they say the Catholic
[20:06] church is one of the most secret
[20:07] churches they will never disclose their
[20:10] wealth
[20:13] but here's a prophet telling you she's
[20:15] got the wealth of the world
[20:19] and if the prophet said it there's no
[20:21] need to go and wonder about it they have
[20:23] the wealth of the world
[20:27] he says the Catholic Church owns the
[20:29] wealth of the world she's got the money
[20:31] she's got the gold to buy our bonds
[20:35] again
[20:36] and you think these whiskey dealers
[20:37] tobacco dealers and great people of the
[20:40] country won't sell out to keep from
[20:42] losing all their businesses and
[20:44] counterfeiting the currency
[20:46] it says they'll go right back and take
[20:50] that money from the Catholic Church
[20:52] you see they're gonna go broke and
[20:54] they're going to go to the Catholic
[20:55] Church
[20:57] now I want you to know this has not
[20:59] happened yet
[21:01] what you are reading is prophecy waiting
[21:04] to be unfold
[21:05] okay
[21:07] they'll go right back and take the money
[21:09] from the Catholic church and then she
[21:12] sold
[21:12] don't the Bible predict that the wealth
[21:15] of the world he said I'm not a
[21:16] politician neither a smart man but I
[21:19] thank the Lord I know him and that's
[21:21] right there is where she's going to lay
[21:24] right there
[21:27] he says you watch it
[21:30] are you watching are you watching with
[21:33] eagle eyes he says you watch it and see
[21:35] if that ain't right I hope we all live
[21:37] to see it
[21:39] know and I don't think we'll have to
[21:41] live too long
[21:45] he says I believe I preached on each
[21:47] year not long ago what will happen to
[21:49] this United States on this money
[21:51] situation
[21:53] we are now paying our debt on taxes that
[21:56] will be paid 40 years from today that's
[21:58] how far we are behind and you know after
[22:01] the pandemic they went into trillions
[22:04] and trillions of dollars into worse debt
[22:07] what happened after World War II they
[22:11] changed the way we treated they took it
[22:14] off the gold standard because they did
[22:17] not have enough gold and they began to
[22:19] trade based on their reputation
[22:21] saying that we are America and we are
[22:24] good for it
[22:25] and that's how they train
[22:28] and don't forget there's still a war
[22:30] going on between Russia and Ukraine
[22:34] everybody's forgotten about that because
[22:37] we are trying to scramble to buy a loaf
[22:40] of bread and buy some milk and to make
[22:43] ends meet
[22:45] but prophecy is unfolding the Jews are
[22:48] being rushed back to their Homeland
[22:49] right
[22:53] amen
[22:57] it says here
[22:59] that's how far we are behind amen
[23:05] he says we are completely busted what
[23:07] does bastard mean broke that's all
[23:10] what's the matter the goal is housed up
[23:13] and the Jews hold the bond so who holds
[23:16] the god
[23:17] Catholics all the Jew the bonds the Jews
[23:22] it's going to be Rome
[23:25] we know who owns the big apartment
[23:27] stores you know the Jews on that right
[23:29] he says but Rome has the greatest part
[23:32] of the wealth of the world
[23:34] the rest of it the Jews have now watch
[23:37] this now just listen to this how the
[23:40] Holy Spirit brought us out for me so who
[23:43] told brother Brandon this
[23:46] who is the Holy Spirit
[23:49] it's God
[23:53] you want to question anything that's
[23:55] being said here tonight you're
[23:56] questioning God
[23:59] told Brother Branham all of this in the
[24:01] first seal
[24:04] that's what we are reading we are
[24:05] reading the first seal
[24:08] and we are watching watch when we get to
[24:11] the end we're almost at the end now
[24:12] because I'm trying to move as quickly as
[24:14] possible
[24:16] so that we don't get caught in darkness
[24:19] but we can be in the light amen I'm just
[24:23] trying to give you the highlights of
[24:24] this message so that you catch it thank
[24:27] you
[24:28] so Rome has the greatest part of the
[24:30] wealth of the world the rest of it the
[24:32] Jews have now watch this just listen to
[24:36] this how the Holy Spirit brought this
[24:38] out for me
[24:40] right he says watch oh what a true thing
[24:43] he is yeah he is now we got a picture
[24:46] know that he is wrong we know that he's
[24:48] a white horse rider he went we know that
[24:51] he went forth as a Doctrine and then
[24:53] what was Pagan Rome converted into papal
[24:56] Rome and crowned
[24:59] now watch in the end time the prince at
[25:02] that time is going to make a covenant
[25:04] with Daniel's people which is the Jews
[25:07] now you ask the question will the bride
[25:09] see it yes brother branham's answer
[25:12] that's when the bride is taken out now
[25:15] she won't see it
[25:19] so shame on you shame for you if you're
[25:21] waiting to see the Covenant being signed
[25:23] between the Jew and the Catholic church
[25:24] and you say I'll make myself right then
[25:28] what does brother Brandon say she won't
[25:31] see it amen
[25:33] and in a more spiritual meaning if you
[25:36] are blinded you should want to see it if
[25:39] you are spiritually blind you still
[25:40] won't see it and even tonight what I'm
[25:43] telling you you're thinking I'm going
[25:44] crazy
[25:46] this guy's a fanatic
[25:48] he's reading something that was in the
[25:50] books from the 60s and act like it's
[25:52] fresh tonight
[25:55] doesn't it sound crazy if you think
[25:57] about it from a literal standpoint
[26:01] he says that's when the bride is taken
[26:03] up now she won't see it amen so that's
[26:06] not a sign to watch you remember a few
[26:08] weeks ago we preached the final sign
[26:10] given to the Gentile age was the back
[26:13] turned
[26:14] to the audience and the discernment of
[26:17] their hearts the final sign given to
[26:19] Sarah before the body change was the
[26:21] discernment of the heart
[26:25] now this nation is going to be busted
[26:28] and the rest of the world that's on the
[26:31] gold standard is busted
[26:36] watch what he's saying now there's only
[26:38] one thing can happen to call in the
[26:41] currency and pay off the bonds and he
[26:44] says we can't do it why they can't do it
[26:47] the Tobacco Man won't do it the big
[26:50] whiskey companies won't do it
[26:52] just similar to what I just tried to
[26:54] explain to you if the economies of the
[26:56] world crash their money is gone how many
[27:00] of you ever invested in a stock exchange
[27:02] one day it's a hundred thousand tomorrow
[27:05] you got 50 random
[27:07] what happened to your money
[27:11] markets crashed
[27:16] he says they won't do it
[27:19] and there's only one thing to do the
[27:22] Catholic church can pay it off
[27:25] she is the only one that's got the money
[27:27] and she can't do it
[27:30] and she will do it
[27:35] so
[27:38] here's the story let me reiterate what
[27:40] I'm trying to tell you tonight
[27:42] the Catholic Church money
[27:44] is not controlled in one Central Bank
[27:48] it's controlled and it's spread around
[27:51] the world
[27:53] but if if the Catholic church is fixing
[27:56] to
[27:57] and and watch when they're moving
[28:00] King Charles comes into power and they
[28:02] know something is fixing to happen
[28:06] so what they need to do
[28:08] if you're a smart businessman and you've
[28:10] got your money all over the world what
[28:12] will you do
[28:15] I hope you'll gather at home
[28:19] and bring it all to one central location
[28:22] wouldn't that be the smart thing to do
[28:26] he says she will do it what will she do
[28:28] she will pay off the debt but she needs
[28:31] all the money to do that
[28:35] he says now he's going to hold the money
[28:37] but I just told you he doesn't hold all
[28:39] the money right now you saw there in the
[28:41] list of the churches it's held by
[28:43] different churches
[28:45] the Church of England holds it in
[28:47] England
[28:49] the church wherever they are they're
[28:51] holding in that country he says and
[28:53] that's where I think it'll come in
[28:56] hello
[28:58] watching modern day events through eagle
[29:00] eyes
[29:02] watch I'm breaking down the quotes So
[29:04] that you can understand it today
[29:07] he is going to hold the money and that's
[29:10] where I think it'll come in
[29:15] decide for us to watch
[29:18] now when he gets the money
[29:21] all under control
[29:23] what will he do he'll have all the world
[29:27] trade and commerce a packed with the
[29:29] world because he'll hold the wealth of
[29:31] the world completely
[29:35] so the thing for the pope to do and
[29:37] maybe somebody should write him a letter
[29:38] he said
[29:40] bring all the money to the stores
[29:44] or maybe he's already done it
[29:47] this month
[29:50] you don't know it
[29:53] because these things are kept Under
[29:55] Wraps
[29:56] let's go to the next slide Pope Francis
[29:58] instructs Vatican entities to move all
[30:01] France to Vatican Bank by September 30th
[30:05] when is September 30th
[30:08] he gave them a deadline
[30:11] the pope made an announcement he wants
[30:15] all fans that's out in any part of the
[30:18] world to be moved to the Vatican bank
[30:20] and he gave them a deadline
[30:25] if you've been following what I've been
[30:27] telling you if King Charles is on the
[30:30] trajectory to reset what economy is
[30:35] you see why the Pope needs his money
[30:37] he doesn't want his money to be reset
[30:43] Pope Francis instructs Vatican entities
[30:46] to move all funds to Vatican Bank by
[30:49] September 30th
[30:52] let's get to another headline day hope
[30:54] imposes deadline
[30:56] for Vatican to transfer assets to bank
[31:00] is imposed right September 30th all oec
[31:05] officers Vatican linked institution to
[31:08] deposit the asset with the Vatican Bank
[31:12] by next week Friday
[31:14] do you know what that means for
[31:15] economies of the world
[31:19] just say for example the Catholic church
[31:21] in South Africa
[31:23] has 20 billion
[31:26] by next week Friday 20 billion rent must
[31:29] leave South Africa
[31:30] [Music]
[31:33] now if you're a bank you know the bank
[31:36] is the bank is not sitting with your
[31:38] money
[31:38] the bank has your money invested
[31:42] so what must they do
[31:44] they need to get 20 billion
[31:46] and transfer the funds
[31:50] how many countries are there around the
[31:52] world how many Catholic churches this is
[31:54] going to cause a ripple effect around
[31:57] the economies of the world because he's
[31:59] given them a deadline hey guys next week
[32:01] Friday I want all the money
[32:03] in my bank account
[32:06] so if any of you are Catholics please
[32:08] who are your transfers
[32:11] the pope is calling for the money
[32:14] but didn't we read that in the first
[32:15] seal
[32:17] let me just say I think that's when it
[32:19] will happen
[32:20] when he brings all the money under his
[32:22] control
[32:24] Church what time are we living in
[32:27] amen is he Gathering all the money
[32:28] because he now needs to pay off the debt
[32:33] but he said the bride won't see it
[32:36] she'll be gone
[32:39] can you see the impact of it it's going
[32:41] to have on world economies
[32:46] watch
[32:48] let's read continue reading watch now in
[32:50] the third seal what is he doing
[32:52] in the third seal
[32:55] listen to The Prophet now he says
[32:58] bringing the wealth of the world to him
[33:02] into himself
[33:05] into the church itself and he is still
[33:08] writing
[33:11] oh sure he is yes sir still riding
[33:16] when you see that Pope making that
[33:18] announcement all fans transferred that's
[33:21] a right
[33:22] he's writing
[33:25] look at what he's saying in the third
[33:27] seal bringing the wealth of the world to
[33:30] him into himself and he is still riding
[33:33] sure he is yes sir still writing
[33:41] I said and it's astounding to see that
[33:44] we're living the hour that we're living
[33:46] in it frightens me it frightens me not
[33:49] in my heart The Joy birds are ringing
[33:51] knowing that the coming of the Lord is
[33:53] so close at hand but what frightens me
[33:55] is that so many is unprepared for the
[33:59] hour that we are facing
[34:01] that's the bad part
[34:08] you see we go like I said struggling to
[34:11] live
[34:12] trying to make ends meet
[34:14] but yeah world leaders
[34:17] shifting
[34:20] if you capture the queen
[34:24] you almost won
[34:27] the queen has been removed he set it up
[34:31] Kings and he removes Kings
[34:34] in the game of chess they have taken the
[34:36] queen
[34:37] and they have set up a king
[34:40] listen what he says so many is
[34:42] unprepared for the hour that we are
[34:44] facing and that's the bad part so many
[34:49] message people
[34:50] are unprepared for the hour that we are
[34:53] facing
[34:55] because they brought television back
[34:57] into their homes to entertain them
[35:00] 24 hours watch Channels 24-hour YouTube
[35:03] 24 hour anything
[35:06] no time for the message of the hour
[35:09] no time for the promise of today
[35:14] amen what Satan will keep you distracted
[35:17] what's the promise of this hour
[35:20] the promise of this hour is not
[35:22] Revelation 10 7.
[35:24] Revelation 10 7 has already come and
[35:26] gone
[35:28] the mystery of God is already finished
[35:31] but the revelation of this hour
[35:34] is that
[35:35] it will come again another group of
[35:37] people in the land who under the
[35:39] Messenger will become the final voice to
[35:42] the final age
[35:43] but we find that people who claim to be
[35:46] under the messenger
[35:48] I become the final voice of gossip
[35:50] become the voice of jealousy become the
[35:53] voice of Envy you'll never hear them
[35:56] speaking something good about the next
[35:57] brother and sister anytime you mention
[36:00] somebody it's always to tear them down
[36:02] and bring them down

[36:23] wants to work why mightily in your life

[36:33] William Branham wants to anoint you

[36:39] the Holy Spirit more than you desire it
[36:44] amen let's read our last quote here
[36:47] he says you may think I'm crazy
[36:50] but when my voice is silenced in death
[36:53] these tapes will still be playing
[36:56] there might be a pastor who will still
[36:57] be reading it like tonight
[37:00] and you recognize that what I've said
[37:03] has come to pass

[37:29] the world are about to be shifted and
[37:31] changed because the man behind the great
[37:33] reset is now in power
[37:37] he says and you might think I'm crazy
[37:39] tonight

[37:43] prophet he says when my voice is
[37:45] silenced in dear these tapes will still
[37:47] be plain and you recognize that what
[37:50] I've said has come to pass
