Greetings in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our soon coming king. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've always got to keep that in our mind. He's our soon coming king. Amen. I just want to read a scripture. Nehemiah chapter 8. Maybe you're wondering why we stand for the reading of the word or why we say amen in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll see in the Bible why. Amen. They did. Okay. See if it's biblical, right? Nehemiah chapter 8 and verse, let's read from verse 5. And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people. And when he opened it, all the people &gt;&gt; stood up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then now we're going to see why. We say, "Amen." And Ezra blessed the Lord. The great God and all the people answered, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Not one amen. Amen. Amen. So we need to give double portion amens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With lifting up their hands. Not just saying amen, but lifting up their hands. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And they bow their heads and worship the Lord with their faces to the ground. &gt;&gt; So, all of these things are biblical. &gt;&gt; It's part of worship to God to say, "Amen." To stand up when we read the word of God. Amen. Amen. So, we're very excited this morning to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. Good to see our brother Sebastian, Sister Christina, Brother Jaden. Amen. Brother Matthew. Amen. They're not uh they're back home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, they're sitting right in their seats, too. We deserved it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many more months left? We're counting down the months. Amen. So, we Amen. We're surprised to see them this morning, but I pray the Lord is keeping you well. Amen. Continue serving him by his grace. They're fellowshipping out there in Emanuel Gospel Center. Newly elected pastor there, Pastor Marshall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we pray that the Lord will continue to bless him as they fellowship out there and serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Very glad to have with us our dear Pastor Rodney this morning. Let's give our pastor Robbie and sister a hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. No strangers to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are warriors for the kingdom of God. Have been serving the Lord for many, many years in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And Pastor Rodney has a heart for the unity of Durban. &gt;&gt; Amen. Always striving. We share the same goal is to unite the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's very giving. He's very generous. He's also a very busy man. So he's got two churches. He's got one here in Durban and one in Peter Merittsburg. Amen. So you know just one church alone can keep you busy. But the Lord has given him grace. That's a grace God has given a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know Paul said the grace that has been given to me. &gt;&gt; So grace has been given to our dear pastor. Amen. To shepherd these church churches. And I pray the Lord will continue to strengthen him and give him the strength and grace that he needs. Amen. So we're grateful to have him here this morning. We've been trying to get him here for some time, but uh he's no stranger to us. He's been here before, maybe not at this place, but at this at the school to minister for us. Dad used to enjoy his ministry and invite him quite often to come and share the word for of the Lord to us. Amen. So, we're going to be blessed this morning. How many of you have come under expectation? &gt;&gt; And if you come under expectation, God will meet you. &gt;&gt; How many of you enjoyed Wednesday service? &gt;&gt; If you came with expectation, &gt;&gt; you got to have preparation. &gt;&gt; Yes. You got to start to prepare now. So if you come with your pots full, you got to empty out. Start to prepare &gt;&gt; because God can only fill if you empty out. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got this much space left here, see this little space? That's all you're going to get full. &gt;&gt; So we're going to empty out and then say, "Lord, fill my cup." &gt;&gt; Amen. So we want the Holy Spirit to speak this morning and minister to the needs of the church. And I pray, Amen, even as our dear pastor is sharing the word of the Lord. Amen. that the angel of God can move through this place, &gt;&gt; sweep through this audience and meet you at the point of your need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the time. Don't wait for tomorrow. Don't wait for another time. Say, "Lord, I've come now. Now I've come to meet with you." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, dear Pastor, welcome. Thank you for accepting our invitation. And I pray, amen, that even as he begins to minister the word of the Lord, you'll open up your hearts and begin to say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just water that word with your amen &gt;&gt; and watch the Holy Spirit take control. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's worthy to be praised. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I've come expecting Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I've come expecting Jesus. I've come expecting God. [Music] Sweetest Holy Spirit. Sweetest Holy Spirit. Say, I'm desperate for your touch. I'm desperate for your touch.

Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. I'm coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I'm expecting you, Father. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads and close our eyes, &gt;&gt; Lord God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Eternal Father, King of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. This morning we gather before you not as strangers, not as guests, but as bloodwashed sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Standing under the token, Lord, and sealed under the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And positioned in this final hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; As your chosen elected bride. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. We approach the service Lord with much re reverence with much respect oh God knowing this is the hour is not a gathering of men father. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord &gt;&gt; but a meeting with the living words. &gt;&gt; Oh yes Lord &gt;&gt; you promised in your word father where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in the midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Lord we pray that you walk amongst us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Move down every eye, touch every heart, &gt;&gt; meet every need. &gt;&gt; Let the angel of your presence, Lord, Lord, &gt;&gt; stood at your prophets, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; stand with us this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; May that angel discern the hearts. &gt;&gt; Heal the sick, deliver the captive. &gt;&gt; May this May set this atmosphere ablaze with faith. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We bind every spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; Bind every spirit of doubt and distraction in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let there be freedom of worship. &gt;&gt; Let there be liberty to shout Lord &gt;&gt; to shout in the joy of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the service, oh God, be a service of encounters with angels, oh God. &gt;&gt; Let there be breakthroughs, oh God. Let there be quicken revelation this morning. Oh God, we are not yet to be entertained. We are here to be changed. &gt;&gt; We are waiting for a revival. &gt;&gt; Father, we are the revival. God, awaken the gifts in your sons and daughters. Oh God, open up, open the word to us, oh God, not as information, but as a revelation to get us in the rhythm of your father, let your bride, Father, rise in her authority, oh God. Let the voice of the archangel sound in her soul. Oh God, let your word be made fresh this morning, Father. And as we stand under the seventh seal, Christ himself, oh God, Lord, we are living in the day of the third pull. Oh God, so Lord, we are expecting the supernatural to be made manifest once more amongst us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, this service is yours, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord Jesus. Be glorified in every moment, Father. And when it's all over and when everything is said and done, Lord, may we say, did not our hearts burn with us while he spoke? with us by the way. &gt;&gt; For we ask it in the mighty &gt;&gt; and wonderful name, the allconquering name, the all sufficient name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's put our hands together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; I just greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You happy this morning? Yeah, it's always a privilege. It's always a joy to gather around the word of God, &gt;&gt; the very word that we love, the very word that we cherish. And of course, it's always a blessing to be with the children of like a precious faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm happy this morning. &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm excited this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I really appreciate the um invitation just to come and warm fellowship. And uh I want to just express my sincere thanks and appreciation to my dear brother, my friend in Christ, our pastor um Adrien um Genanon for this opportunity just to come. May God richly bless the assembly &gt;&gt; and bless the government of the church, all the supporters and the helpers. He can't do it himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He he need helpers. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I always say when I when when God called me to the ministry to preach, I said, "Lord, give me good men &gt;&gt; to stand behind me, to support me, that can love me unconditionally, not judge me, but catch the same vision that I have to move the kingdom of God um forward." So may the Lord richly bless um this assembly. Amen. and not forgetting our dear sister Grace &gt;&gt; and also honoring the memory of our pastor Ronnie Genan and to um brother Sha. I'm sure they're looking down from the banister of time this morning, smiling down upon us from eternity. Amen. And no doubt their lives and labors are not forgotten. &gt;&gt; Their memories live amongst us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his wonderful name. Amen. I would like you to invite your attention to the book of Exodus and then to the book of Numbers. Um I I I want to take a little talk this morning. Uh uh a little subject, you know, sometimes I'm I I I'm a bit of a drawn out preacher, you know, and I can remember, you know, Brother Beck we preach in many places. One time he said to me, Lord, just land this airplane. Just land it. Please, man. Just land this airplane. Amen. So, um, but I pray that God will just give us, uh, grace. Yeah. That, uh, wherever we need to stop, we'll stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever he wants us to say, we'll say. &gt;&gt; If he says go on, we go on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I I want to speak on a little subject, the unseen realm. &gt;&gt; The unseen realm. And for a little uh theme this morning, angels to keep us in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in the way. May maybe you'll be seated for just a few minutes. And then maybe uh my brother if you could find that quote from the for us from the revelation the book of symbols. So I want to speak on the unseen realm you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in the way because God has a ministry of angels. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know something uh it took me time to really understand some of these things. &gt;&gt; You know brother Brandham had the Holy Ghost for sure. You see, and I believe that I have the Holy Ghost. I believe that the congregation, the people that seated here has the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham had the Holy Ghost. The believers that were seated before him, they had the Holy Ghost. But if you had noticed in the meetings, Brother Brandham when he would come to the pulpit, he would just talk and talk and maybe even tell some stories and talk and talk and talk and then he would pause and he would just say, um, you know, I'm waiting on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then after a few moments, you know, he would speak and stand. Then you would say, "No, now he's here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that is a that is a reality. &gt;&gt; That is a supernatural being that sent from the presence of God Almighty that will come down into that meeting. And just as brother Brandham depended upon that angel, we are also depend on that angelic presence this morning because that angel didn't just come for one man. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel came with the message. The angel of the Lord is the message. &gt;&gt; He came out to a people. He came to a bride. And he's still here. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Leading us in the way. Amen. And if we have eyes to see this morning and if we have hearts to believe this morning, then we can also say the angel of the Lord is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So let me read this quote for you here. Make a few comments and then we can read our scripture and get into our thought. But this is the crux of what I would like to share with you this morning. The prophet of God says, "Angelic beings associate together." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. angelic beings associated together. He says, "Oh, I hope you get that. That just dropped down." He had free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Look, if you've got the Holy Ghost in you, then you're a candidate for association with the unseen world and the supernatural." &gt;&gt; He says, "No wonder people can't believe in those things. They have never come in contact. &gt;&gt; They've got nothing in here to believe with. But when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly, &gt;&gt; he becomes a two-fold being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the earth to die and one of heaven to live. Amen. He says in his body is still subject to death. But in his soul, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In his soul, he's passed from death unto life. In his body, he has earthly contact with his five senses. in his spirit. He has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and watch them. And the angels of God visits them, &gt;&gt; speaks with them. &gt;&gt; And they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name to the individual. Lord. &gt;&gt; So if you've got the Holy Ghost according to what the prophet says, then you're a candidate. Hallelujah. For association with the unseen world. Amen. Amen. That means if you have the Holy Ghost, you become you have access. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you are eligible. The Holy Ghost makes you eligible for angelic visitations to give you divine communication. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why you know many believers today they walk like tourists in a &gt;&gt; realm &gt;&gt; where they are called to govern. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they don't have their spiritual passports that don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Listen the prophet says he says quickly when you get the Holy Ghost he becomes a two-fold being. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Twofold being because the believer is now a mystery to himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. He's dying and living at the same time. His flesh is mortal, but his soul is crossed over. &gt;&gt; He walks here in Der. He walks in Phoenix. He walks in in tax. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he's a twofold being. He lives in Christ. &gt;&gt; He eats food for this earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he feeds on mana from another world. &gt;&gt; That's why the world can't understand you. They confused about you because you're not just human anymore. You are housing eternity in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "No wonder people can't believe in those things. They got nothing in here yet to believe in." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Carnal minds will always scoff at at angelic visitations and visions and angelic healings and supernatural power. &gt;&gt; You you can't expect dead men to respond to a living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see? Amen. That's why we just don't need we don't need sermons just absolutely &gt;&gt; we need the fire of God to work in our life. &gt;&gt; What we preach must be living in us. It must be seen. It must be in manifestation. We must enjoy divine visitation. We must know that he is here. &gt;&gt; He is not here then this meeting is a waste of time. &gt;&gt; That's why the god says if you could see him he said you run down you fall down and you worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says in his body he has earthly contact with five senses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even five senses put for the earthly contact but in the spirit God has given you a dedicated channel &gt;&gt; through the Holy Ghost. You are designed to hear from the author himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But because God has designed his bride to walk under revelation &gt;&gt; not information. And then this last part he says, "And the angels of God visits them and speaks to them." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you give testimony to that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have you enjoyed a visitation from the angels? Have you enjoyed a visitation from the presence of the living God? &gt;&gt; Because the same God who sent angels to Abraham, he sent to Daniel. He sent to Cornelius. He sent to brother Brandon. Amen. &gt;&gt; These are just these are not stories. No, &gt;&gt; this is a divine that is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You say sometimes no I haven't seen angels. It's because you are insensitive &gt;&gt; because your channel is blocked. Your message is not heed. He's not healed it. &gt;&gt; Angels don't waste time with people who flirt with darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Angel says there's an angel standing right by your chair. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's a quote. Hallelujah. They're standing there. They are ready, ready to speak, ready to guide, ready to warn, ready to comfort, ready to confirm his word to those that are walking in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So from this quote here, we want to just set a little tone so that we can get into our scriptures. So um maybe we could just stand for a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 23 and we want to read from verse 20. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. He says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee &gt;&gt; to keep thee in the way &gt;&gt; and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared." Praise his wonderful name. You You may be seated. Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we are speaking on the unseen ren and angels to keep us in the way. Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in the way because sheep have to be led. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sheep can't lead themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I I I I recently went and I was speaking to some a brother who they didn't come to church for a long time and he says, "God is keeping me. God is keeping my family. God is so wonderful. So good." I I when I when he finished, I said, "Brother, you're backsliding and you don't even know it. You can't lead yourself. &gt;&gt; You need God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need a church. You need a pastor. You need a home because a church is an extended family. It's a support structure for your spiritual walk with God. &gt;&gt; You need church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need a pastor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name. So here in Exodus chapter 23, God himself is speaking to Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And who is Moses? Moses is a prophet &gt;&gt; and God is speaking to Moses. He says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, if you can picture this, the angel of the Lord going first, Moses standing behind the angel, and the people of God standing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. An angel before thee to keep thee in the way. You see that angel? This was absolutely necessary because you must remember now this is the first exodus. The path that they were going to travel was unlike any other path that they had traveled before. &gt;&gt; It was more than just a natural train. &gt;&gt; It was not some kind of a detour on a map. You see, no GPS, no G, no Google map &gt;&gt; could guide them to that place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because this was more than a natural journey. Yes, &gt;&gt; this was a prophetic journey. This was a transition from one realm to another realm. This was from bondage to liberty. This was from Egypt to the promised land. &gt;&gt; And listen saints, we are all in the same kind of way this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This we are not here on a on a Sunday religious detour. No, we are here on a journey. We are here on a sacred march. When we are here in the house of God, it's one step closer to eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because at the end of the road, amen, we will become the word again. &gt;&gt; We become fully restored, fully redeemed. And every stain of sin, everything that is connected to the fall will be completely wiped away. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We are in a journey. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way." &gt;&gt; Yes. and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared, &gt;&gt; which God has prepared. So in other words, God has a specific destination in his mind, &gt;&gt; a place he himself prepared to bring his children into. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a place that is connected to the birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a place where they'll come to a full realization of who they are and what they are born for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if you can just catch that this morning. Sometimes you look at your life, you look at back at your birth, you look at your upbringing, you say, "Lord, uh why you make me like this? Lord, what I'm doing upon this earth, Lord, why why I'm made like this year? Lord, what is your will for my life?" We ask all these questions, but the word says one day it will be so real. &gt;&gt; It will be so plain, so clear because you shall be known as you were known. Hallelujah. You'll understand that you were in the thoughts of God. that your life has always been part of his eternal plan. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And this exodus is the journey to that place, to your inheritance, to your originality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were making a journey. They were journeying to a place where nobody could occupy or take their place there. &gt;&gt; They were journeying to a place that they were born to occupy. &gt;&gt; They were going to a place where they could have all things under their feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is speaking about a place in the Holy Ghost. It's speaking about a place in the Holy Spirit. And listen now, for them to make that journey, God prepared a prophet. &gt;&gt; And then God sent an angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; That shows you something that these people are highly favored by God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't let them to navigate this journey on their own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God prepared a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and sent an angel. &gt;&gt; It is his divine provision. Tell me who can who can who can provide this kind of provision just to make sure &gt;&gt; just to make sure that you're kept in the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He sent an angel then he sent a prophet to keep you in the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at the provision because God know what kind of people you are because sometimes you know you you get up to nonsense and now you want to wrigle off. Sometimes you lose your way. Sometimes you lose your bearings. Sometimes you lose your consciousness. Sometimes you lose your focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he knows how to keep you. &gt;&gt; He knows how to keep you keeping on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you believe this morning you being led into that place? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not by might, not by power, not by uh power, but by my spirit. Say the Lord. They that are led led by the spirit are &gt;&gt; sons of God. Hallelujah. Divine leadership, heavenly leadership, &gt;&gt; leadership from above. &gt;&gt; So we are speaking about the unseen. &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in the way. And we're seeing an angel here that is leading the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in verse 21, he says, "Beware of him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And obey his voice. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. My hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We must beware and obey because sometimes this angel leads you into strange places. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This angel sometimes leads you into dangerous places. When the children of Israel was coming out of Egypt and they came he Moses God stepped in Moses to camp between the mountains of at the place called Mikdoll and you and then and then Mikdoll was between two mountains. mountains on this side, mountains on this side, and they were camping here, the Red Sea in front of them. &gt;&gt; And then now when you look at the picture there, yet there's no way to escape. I mean, mountains side, mountains this side, Red Sea this side. Then you turn back, then you see Pharaoh's army, &gt;&gt; racing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming with full speed for you. Hallelujah. Then you you you feel trapped. You know, there's no way to escape. Then he say, "Oh God, I'm sure Pharaoh is going to get me here. I'm sure I'm going to die here." &gt;&gt; But that's exactly why God doesn't tell us everything up front. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why our life, our earthly life is very mysterious. &gt;&gt; It unfolds day and day by day, moment by moment, second by second. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe some of us won't survive before by the end of the year. Hallelujah. Some of us will go to eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see our our our predestination God is very easy to understand. &gt;&gt; We know we were taught genes in God. We know we can say all of that. We know our final destination. We know our eternal destination. We know what we will be. We know the perfection that's there. &gt;&gt; But the earthly life, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is most mysterious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why sometimes it's always wise to just look back, see your upbringing, see where God rose you from, see your mother, see your father, see your family. It tells a story and God's divine intervention in our king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. And God doesn't tell us everything up front &gt;&gt; because God knows when the enemy is coming. &gt;&gt; God knows. God sees the enemy coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you something. God is always prepared for the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Always prepare for the enemy. And when you feel vulnerable, when you feel most exposed, when you feel confused, then he comes sweeping in like mama. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He comes sweeping down from the heights above. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you can say, "Where he leads me, I will follow." Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; God is always ready for the enemy. Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name. Because sometimes, you know, sickness wants to destroy your life. Sometimes frustration wants to make you insane and send you to a mad house. Sometimes the devil just comes and he busts up your home. Hallelujah. And you don't know what is happening and you seem forsaken and you and you when you just you just want to give up. &gt;&gt; No, brothers and sisters, you have been led this morning. &gt;&gt; There is an angel. He's keeping you in the way. &gt;&gt; He is saying beware of him and obey his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. M &gt;&gt; he says provoke him not. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For he will not pardon your transgressions. &gt;&gt; Pardon is in this angel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This angel can pardon. &gt;&gt; How many needs a pardon? &gt;&gt; And the prophet always tells us the pardon is not a pardon until it is accepted as a pardon. &gt;&gt; Have you heard of the pardoning grace of the living word that comes out of his mouth? Your sins which are many, they are forgiven. Pick up your bed, walk and walk and go. Sin no more. &gt;&gt; Pardon is in his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for a leader that can pardon. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for a leader who knows the way this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for a leader who's interested in showing me what I'm born for. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for a leader who's picked me up from the market to put me back in the economy of God where I belong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he says, "For my name is in him." &gt;&gt; Powerful. &gt;&gt; My name is in him. God is telling Moses, &gt;&gt; "This angel is not just a messenger. &gt;&gt; This angel, this one that is going before you, he carries my identity. &gt;&gt; The one that is going before you, he has my character. He has my attributes. &gt;&gt; He is not coming in his own name. My name is in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; The angel of God, hallelujah, is God in another form. &gt;&gt; This is Christ in another form. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "But if thou shalt indeed obey, obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; an enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Unto thine enemies. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to fight your battle. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the covenant promise. &gt;&gt; He can't go back on his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not just protection for you. &gt;&gt; This is warfare on your behalf. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, how many of us faced enemies on this journey? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Enemies. Enemies of the soul. Enemies of the mind, &gt;&gt; enemies of the family, &gt;&gt; enemies of the body, &gt;&gt; how many times there's Amalachites standing there waiting for you, &gt;&gt; Canaanites waiting for you, &gt;&gt; Hitittites waiting to stop you and prevent you from entering &gt;&gt; into your inheritance to stop you from becoming what God ordained you to be. How many time there's cancers and tumors and sickness trying to bring you &gt;&gt; to a premature grave? &gt;&gt; How many time Mr. Frustration is standing there. &gt;&gt; Mr. Stress is standing there, they want to kill you and take away your peace and and and fool you with tension. &gt;&gt; But God said if you hear his voice, if you follow the angel, he will be an enemy unto your enemies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if the enemy comes to steal your peace, to steal your joy, that angel will say, "That's my child. That's my son. That's my daughter. I give them peace. I give them joy. Satan, you get back on them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He told Abraham, "I am your shield and thy exceeding great reward." &gt;&gt; That's what he said to Abraham. He said to Abraham, "They that come against you, I will come against them." Are we not the seed of Abraham? &gt;&gt; He said to Abraham, "He that hates you, I will hate them." &gt;&gt; He that comes to fight against you, I will fight them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He that blesses you, I'll bless them. Hallelujah. Why? Because Abraham is family. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like he said to Saul, he said, "Why persecute us the why persecuted the thou me?" Saul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Who was Saul persecuting? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was persecuting the church. &gt;&gt; Yes. the genes of God, the attributes of God, the saints in the church. &gt;&gt; But when God shook him off his ass, the angel asked him, "Why persecute thou me?" &gt;&gt; Because if you come against these people who come against thee, &gt;&gt; oh my hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "I will be an enemy to your enemies &gt;&gt; and an adversary unto thine adversaries, &gt;&gt; for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee in." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. to the place that he has prepared into your placing. Hallelujah. If you have not placed this place, this one, this one that we're talking about in place this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 23. Unto the Amorites and the Hittites and the Pyizzes and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, and I will cut them off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Reading. &gt;&gt; I will cut them off. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you want to see God cut off &gt;&gt; Yes. the enemies in your life. &gt;&gt; Do you want to see God cut off the enemies that are trying to stop you from coming into your inheritance? &gt;&gt; Do you want to see God break the powers of those things that are hindering you from walking with God? &gt;&gt; Or you just want to come here to Son of Man Ministries and be a nice church member &gt;&gt; or do you want to see the enemies your enemies come down? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I &gt;&gt; will cut them down. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are speaking about the unseen heaven. &gt;&gt; Angels to keep us in this way. &gt;&gt; Our thoughts this morning is just to raise your level of awareness. Amen. Because many people uh you know they walk through life unconscious of the unseen world. &gt;&gt; They're not sensitized to that reality that there is another realm more real than what our eyes can see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like the prophet preached a great message looking to the unseen. &gt;&gt; We want to open our eyes to the other world &gt;&gt; because in that realm God has a ministry of angels and they are here to keep us in the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to Numbers chapter 22:15. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I have a strong um biblical background, Bible background. always when I first came to the message I I I found it very strange that you know the people were reading quotes and if you came from a biblical background it was very hard for me but when you find that the prophet said everything that I preach is in the Bible then you take what he preached and you'll find it in the &gt;&gt; you see hallelujah that this message is thus said the lord can't shake you can't move you everyone is falling apart can't shake &gt;&gt; hallelujah when you have a personal experience with this message. Can you &gt;&gt; can she? Hallelujah. Let me tell you my own experience. For me, God spoke to me directly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many of the people that came along in our journey, they've gone back to the world, back into denomination and so on. But for me, it became real and personal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me give you this short testimony. You know it was maybe in ' 81 or ' 82 I was at university and you know those days you just um when you present the gospel you just want to completely annihilate the your opposition women standing in your way you just want to crush them down you just memorize all the scriptures and the quotes and whatever it may be if they're talking about you know the godhead and they're talking about you know baptism and all of those things there you you got the scriptures just flowing like that there and you just crushed them there and there There was this one boy, his name was Mvin and and he he he was he was he was overwhelmed. He comes from a strong Christian, you know, his brothers, his daddy, you know, were pastors in the denomination. And then um he was so excited. He took some message books from me and he went away and I was very happy and I was waiting for him on Monday to come back. So when we got back on Monday at campus and and then he he came to see me and then he began to tell me things that I never knew about brother. &gt;&gt; I never knew about the tax case. I never do because now they presented like the man was a thief. He was a rogue. He was, you know, a hocus pocus and all the funny things inside there. And now I never heard of this thing. Sir, I came home. I was asking my wife, she doesn't know. I asked my brother-in-law, you know, I even he doesn't know. I asked the pastor, he was more confused than me. I asked another one, another one, more confused. And it was just my whole foundation under me was shaking. Brother Willie, I didn't know what to do because I'm not getting the answers that I actually need. And at that time I was with pastor Dan Naidu and I used to run the tape service. I never had a car. I so I had a a box I used to put all the tapes inside take it to church with my book and you know write it and you know grew up in a very legalist those days you know. So and then you know like if the tape is not wound to you know I mean personing is not wound it used to irritate me you know. So you know I used to tell people don't buy food buy a tape recorder and all those funny things. So and then um and and I was so troubled by so many things because of what they had shared with me. Then um uh one sister came to me, in fact it was sister muan and they had she's still living. She's at brother Tony uh at Eagle Tabernacle. And then she came to me and said to me, "Pastor Rodney, this tape is not working." &gt;&gt; The message is called All Things Spre 1962. It's not working. &gt;&gt; And then you know um for me um I said in my mind I'm saying you need to buy a new tape recorder. you know, nothing wrong with the tape. So, anyhow, I I came home and for me, I'm I'm a person where everything before I go to bed has to be back in place. &gt;&gt; So, I'll never go to bed until I put the tapes back until it's all rewound and put it in. We living in a in a small building there, one room, you know, our bedroom was the bed was here. All the tapes was around us. We used to sleep in the center. We we just had one daughter at that time. And then um uh my wife was making tea for me. You know the lounge and everything's open planned because you you sleep there, eat there, everything is there. And then whilst I'm sitting there and I'm getting all sorted out, I said, "Let me leave this tape for the last." And then when I pressed that tape to play, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. What I needed to know, &gt;&gt; God spoke to me directly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He began to explain the how the text came tax case started what happened all the different things inside there and many other things God gave me and vindicated and proved to me that this message is the same &gt;&gt; more and I can give you countless ones that's why it doesn't bother me when this one says that one that one he's finding evidence he's finding mistakes and so on for me I can see it hallelujah &gt;&gt; this is a profound Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you can see yourself that your message is anointed for you, nothing can sh &gt;&gt; nothing can actually move you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. So yeah, Numbers chapter 22 and from verse 15. So I'm just picking up a few scriptures to just dramatize the moment to help crystallize our thoughts and to kind of make this thing real today. Now you know numbers chapter 22 it deals with a time when Israel was marching towards the the promised land and they were on a journey under a pillar of fire they were under a prophetic miss message they were under divine leadership &gt;&gt; and whilst of course they're coming under the lead of Moses and whilst they the uh they are in this exodus and they're coming out of Egypt they encountered Balam &gt;&gt; and Balam was a man was a prophet He was a man with a gift. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he was misaligned to the will of God. &gt;&gt; So it is in this chapter that God pulls back the veil and and we will begin to see the how the unseen realm intervenes in earthly matters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now verses 1 to 14 tells us how saw the children of Israel marching and he became so afraid. He had heard of what had happened at the Red Sea and how they had defeated the Amalachites. He had heard about the prophet Moses. He had heard about the pillar of fire and ba this Moabitete king became terrified. &gt;&gt; Now he tries to cut them off from their inheritance. He tried to destroy his people because he feels threatened by them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Satan sees a church. He sees a bride that is raising up in this hour &gt;&gt; and he wants this earth for his kingdom and he sees a people who has a title to inheritance and he's trying to stop her from going in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Bale now solicits the help of Balam &gt;&gt; and he sends his people and he sends some of his messages. He sends some of his officials to get Balum to come and curse them. I mean you know the story. This is Sunday school. Hallelujah. And Bale means you know um destruction and Balum means the destroyer of the people. &gt;&gt; And Balam lived by along the uh the river Euphrates. And in that hour he was coming up against the church of God in all subtlety to destroy them. &gt;&gt; He was part of a false kingdom that was opposed to God's kingdom. He was under the headship of Bao. &gt;&gt; Yes. But Moses, a prophet, is led by an angel. I want you to see that. &gt;&gt; Moses is led by an angel. &gt;&gt; Moses was born a deliverer. &gt;&gt; Moses was was Moses met the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Moses was commissioned by the great I am. &gt;&gt; Moses was given the word to break the powers of darkness around the people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Moses was taking them to an inheritance by divine leadership. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. Every true minister, true minister is a Moses. &gt;&gt; Every true minister is doing that in his church. &gt;&gt; Every true minister has a church. Has a true flock because God gives him the flock. Hallelujah. Every true church has to have a shepherd ministry. That shepherd ministry is to break the bondage. Is to lift the oppression of the people that the task masters of Egypt is putting upon them and to bring them into their inheritance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So watch this now here. Whether it's in the natural or whether it's in the spiritual, there's always conflict in these realms. &gt;&gt; The world we live in is just a reflection of the unseen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You if you want to know what realm someone is under today, &gt;&gt; watch what comes out of their mouths. &gt;&gt; Watch they speak. Watch their speech. Watch where their thoughts dwell. Watch their dress. Watch the their craving in their hearts. Watch the the desires. Watch how they live their lives. And it will reveal where they are being influenced from &gt;&gt; because this is an age of flesh and spirit uniting. &gt;&gt; This is the age where hell is formed on the earth. This is the age where devils are becoming incarnate. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there are devils. Hopefully not here but there are devils that are sitting here today. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir. Through nicolatanism through paganism through Jezebelism devils are becoming incarnate through the antichrist spirit through the false prophet through the beast devils are becoming incarnate. But glory to God through justification, through sanctification, through the battle of the Holy Ghost, God is coming down to the hearts of his sons and daughters. Hallelujah. While Satan is binding the people and conquering the lady, God has a message that is washing and cleansing his church. Why there is a false prophet bringing a corrupt form of worship? While there is a doctrine of Jezebel that is exalting herself and trying to kill the the the true prophet and the true word. Whilst that is happening, God has a true ministry &gt;&gt; that can bring the new birth that can bring the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is happening brothers and sisters. Satan incarnate in three stages. And God incarnated in three stages. &gt;&gt; The wheat and the tears. Children of light, children of darkness, children of wisdom, and children of faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The tree of life and the tree of death standing side by side. &gt;&gt; The natural church and the spiritual church, Israel and Jacob in the womb of this age. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Moses is leading the children of Israel out of Egypt and he's bringing them into their inheritance &gt;&gt; into the Holy Ghost to place them positionally. &gt;&gt; But along the way he meets another man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who follow me who is preaching about the same God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In a different way. &gt;&gt; A man who has a ministry but he has unclean lips. M &gt;&gt; and a false doctrine is flowing out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; two trees in the garden of &gt;&gt; Eden. &gt;&gt; He He who eats the Balan tree &gt;&gt; will die. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he who eats the Moses tree will live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One to lead you into your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The other one seek to hybridize and destroy the original seed. Amen. What an hour we are living. &gt;&gt; What a place to walk with God. Yes. &gt;&gt; May the Holy Ghost enlighten your minds. May you understand. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What the Holy Spirit is to accomplish in our lives. &gt;&gt; What the seven se is to do for us. This this isn't small talk here. This isn't word play here. &gt;&gt; Quickening power is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The energize that God himself is present letting his people into a rhythm of faith. He wants to make you faith the children this this morning. Why? Because faith is the victory that overcometh the world. &gt;&gt; So Moses now is leading his church into an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Along the way, he encounters a man who's operating from a different realm. But this man also carries a measure of the supernatural. M &gt;&gt; and when you look at this man Balen very carefully from verses 1 to4 um in numbers chapter 22 &gt;&gt; we watch him where we going to pick up is under temptation. Yes, &gt;&gt; this prophet of God, &gt;&gt; he's under temptation and he's going through a trial. &gt;&gt; And in that late hour, we find him having a desire for popularity. &gt;&gt; And in the late hour, he was willing to sell and market his gift to the world. &gt;&gt; He was a man who had the measure of genuine spiritual manifestations in his life. &gt;&gt; He was a man who had access to God. He he was a man who knew how to approach God correctly. &gt;&gt; But now we are watching him in a time of temptation. &gt;&gt; First he resists to a degree. &gt;&gt; In verse 12, God speaks to him directly and says, "Thou shalt not go with them." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he and Balam refuses the first offer. And he sends Bailock's messengers along the way with all the gifts, all the officials, with all the flattery. &gt;&gt; It seems like he's he seems like he has victory. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But here's the teaching. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't back down because you won the first round. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Satan does not give up and fold in because you resisted once. &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah. He studies you. &gt;&gt; He learns your vulnerabilities. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I always say to the church, if you got no problems, you got problems. You have a big problem. Hallelujah. If Satan is not doing something upsetting your home, upsetting your family, upsetting your business, upsetting your job, upsetting something in your life, something otherwise what are you before him then? You like a big marshmallow, a big lollipop or something like that comes and give you a nice good lick. Oh, you came Sunday to church so tasty and hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan does not give up and folding &gt;&gt; because you resisted once. &gt;&gt; He studies you, brothers and sisters. He's not worried about the denomination. He's got you under his microscope. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And for many, this is where deception sets in &gt;&gt; because it becomes temporary &gt;&gt; because people have hollow victories. They have emotional testimonies. Oh, I overcame. Oh, I resisted the devil. Oh, they shout and scream. Hallelujah. But what they don't realize, &gt;&gt; what they don't realize, this is not a one round fight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, Satan lets you throw some punches in the first round to see where your strengths are. And it gives you a sense of overconfidence &gt;&gt; because watch the scriptures. Bail studied him. &gt;&gt; He studied Balam because watch how Bale responds after he says no. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he's going to come with the same enticement to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because Bao is a type of Satan. When his first attempt fails, he doesn't give up. &gt;&gt; He upgrades his approach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch in verse 15. &gt;&gt; And Bale sent yet again princes more and more honorable than they. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. First he sent some common messengers and some officials. Now you upgrades &gt;&gt; more and more honorable than they. Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the devil fails the first time, he doesn't stop. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's not stopping until you're changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He escalates. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And verse 16, and they came to Balam and and said to him, "Thus sayeth Ba the son of Zapor, let nothing I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me, for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me, come therefore, I pray thee, and curse this people." M &gt;&gt; watch the evil influence. &gt;&gt; A man trying to pull a prophet to his side &gt;&gt; to express his own will to him. &gt;&gt; Bailic is flattery. He's offering wealth. &gt;&gt; He's offering position. He's offering power, seduction by influence. &gt;&gt; Why? so that he can channel his own hatred and fear through another man to curse a people he feels threatened by. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And today nothing has changed. &gt;&gt; How many people today fall for the same old trick? &gt;&gt; How many people are gullible who are soft and compromising? &gt;&gt; How many people are so easily seduced by position, by praise, by prosperity, by money? How many people get tied into influences that is bent on on destroying the truth? &gt;&gt; How many people get lured into a trap only because they have a crave in the heart for things that are not theirs and they're discontented with their portion in life &gt;&gt; and they lack godliness or contentment which is great gain. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they get sucked up into uncertain riches and pierce the souls with many sorrows. And Bale is caught up in the danger zone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he began to reason, you know, maybe God didn't hear me. No. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's a way we can make this thing working. &gt;&gt; After God didn't tell me pain, we don't go now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us. And now he begins entertaining the thought that perhaps God might be okay with this. &gt;&gt; And there you find people wrestling with their own thoughts and they're trying to quote the word not to submit &gt;&gt; but to justify their desire. &gt;&gt; Find people living in limbo, pretending it's spiritual, &gt;&gt; but knowing deep inside they're trying to get permission to do what they already want. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Let's pause for a moment. Let let that settle in. Think a little bit. Watch how God is defining it for us this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking on the unseen angels to keep us in the way because me too. I'm looking for that influence. &gt;&gt; I want to surrender. I want to yield to that unseen influence. I want to become a channel of communication for that unseen this morning. &gt;&gt; Friends, listen to me. I don't want a Holy Ghost that that that just wants to dodge hell. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't want a life that is just better than a sinner in a nightclub. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost to give me an uncction to teach me all things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch how Balam watch how they came unto Balam. And they said said unto him in verse 16, "Thus said Bale the son of Zapor, let nothing I pray thee hinder thee for uh from coming unto me." &gt;&gt; Wow. forceful persuasion. &gt;&gt; Thus say not thus say the Lord thou th say thus say Satan. &gt;&gt; See let nothing hinder you from coming unto me. &gt;&gt; Watch now. Now now comes the bait. &gt;&gt; The bait is verse 17. For I will promote thee unto very great honor. &gt;&gt; Does that sound familiar? &gt;&gt; That is what Lucifer did in heaven. That is what Lucifer did in the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; You shall be as God's. You shall um not surely die. &gt;&gt; Breaking the unity. That is what he did in heaven. &gt;&gt; You see, always promising position and power &gt;&gt; while sowing division. &gt;&gt; Satan's oldest trick is to elev itself. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Elevate self. &gt;&gt; Appeal to ambition. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love him. &gt;&gt; You got nothing to be scared of this morning. You're walking for God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're hungry for God, you got nothing to be scared of. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost is finding you, living in sin this morning, blood is available. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a fountain open in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you confess your sins, he's just faithful to forgive your sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Watch this man here with a watered down &gt;&gt; faith lusting for power. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Bale sends his ambassadors and they plead with him for I will promote thee unto very great honor and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me. Come therefore I pray thee and curse this people. Verse 18. And Balam answered and said unto the servants of Baal, if watch now he's answering. M &gt;&gt; if Bale could give me his house full of silver and of gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more. &gt;&gt; Discern what's happening here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It looks like the man is making a real stand for God here. &gt;&gt; Just like Eve, too. &gt;&gt; We shall surely die if we eat that tree. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But &gt;&gt; he kept talking. &gt;&gt; He kept talking. &gt;&gt; He kept talking. &gt;&gt; It did not end there. &gt;&gt; And then finally, she saw it was good for food. &gt;&gt; He saw it was good for food. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Finally, she saw it was a tree designed to make one wise. &gt;&gt; Too much talking. &gt;&gt; Too much talking. &gt;&gt; And then living a life of pretense and hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But see how Bum starts off. Hallelujah. Give me a house full of gold and silver. And God help me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch the very next verse. &gt;&gt; Verse 19. when you talk talk talk too much. Now therefore I pray thee Terry don't go &gt;&gt; after saying that there hallelujah don't go wait your t stay one more night &gt;&gt; also he had this night that I may know what the lord will say unto me &gt;&gt; no more &gt;&gt; what the lord will say unto me more hallelujah after said to him in verse 12 thou shalt not go with M &gt;&gt; now Bam is seeking a second opinion. &gt;&gt; Not because he's confused, &gt;&gt; but because he's hoping for a different answer that suits his desire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan found something. &gt;&gt; He found Bam did not have a true revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Satan found the place that wasn't covered up. &gt;&gt; Satan found a place where there was no evidence of the new birth. Satan found the place where this man could halt between two opinions because this man never really sold out to the true living God. &gt;&gt; Satan found that place where this man just had mental faith. &gt;&gt; Satan found that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you find your place too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't bluff the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't bluff the word. You can't bluff God's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And you can't bluff the devil neither &gt;&gt; because the devil knows when you are bluffing. &gt;&gt; It's like God says, well, you know, when you say you believe and you genuine, you know, the the ur the yurum lights up and and and shows that you have faith and that you you are speaking the truth. &gt;&gt; Well, the devil has something true. When you're bluffing, &gt;&gt; he knows that it is own self coming back to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knows that it is his own tactic because bluff originated in him. God don't &gt;&gt; bluff. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is Satan that has a bow and no hell. &gt;&gt; It is God that has a quiver full of arrows. Is the word that goes forth like a sharp sword. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you following? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hi. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is our life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We speaking about you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So as we look further here now, we see this man is under real temptation. He's slipping away from the word of God in verse 20. And God came unto Bam at at night and said unto uh unto him, if the men come to call thee, rise up and go with them. But yet the word which I shall say unto thee, thou shalt um that shalt thou do, &gt;&gt; this is not God going along with B. &gt;&gt; No, this is God exposing him. &gt;&gt; Friends, God don't tolerate nonsense. &gt;&gt; God don't tolerate foolishness. &gt;&gt; This is God. Catch me here. This is God realizing I have revealed truth to you and you don't realize that truth has a responsibility. &gt;&gt; When I reveal truth to you, I expect you to walk in obedience to truth &gt;&gt; and I expect you to value the privilege of knowing truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You mean you want to play around the truth &gt;&gt; after truth has already been revealed to you. You want to play around with truth. You want me to give you something? What do you ask for? Something more. &gt;&gt; You want me to give you something more? You want me to give you something else after I've expressed my will and made it clear and plain to you? Well, &gt;&gt; I see you've shown me what your real desire is. &gt;&gt; Your real desire is that you don't have a love for the word. &gt;&gt; So now you're going to need a strong delusion to believe the lie and be damned by it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So God came and said unto you, okay, &gt;&gt; since you want your desire more than the revealed word, &gt;&gt; since you feel God must deal with you differently, &gt;&gt; you find people like that, they want to be extra special. &gt;&gt; God must deal with you differently. God have one plan for everybody but one special plan for you to do what you want to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God said okay you want to go go ahead go and walk in the live and live in the thing that you want because you don't want Christ to be &gt;&gt; and God was giving the man his own desire. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But if Bam had any revelation, any fear of God, he would have cried out to Bailo and said, "What are you trying to involve me with? &gt;&gt; What's wrong with you? Are you mad? Are you suicidal? &gt;&gt; You coming up against the kingdom of God? You never hear about the slain lamb. You never hear about water from the rock. You never hear of man from heaven. You never hear about the dead angel in Egypt. You're coming up against God's anointed prophet Moses. &gt;&gt; You want to curse God's people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Didn't you hear what happened down in Egypt? You're not afraid of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; You're bypassing all of that and you come with your evil plan to seduce me and make me an accomplice in your scheme. &gt;&gt; If you don't love God, I love God. &gt;&gt; That is how the man should act. &gt;&gt; But the man is playing around with people who want to curse God's people. &gt;&gt; That's why compromise is always getting to someone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you become a compro compromiser, the first thing happens is you lose the fear of God. &gt;&gt; Then you lose respect for &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you start you start to flirt with the enemy for personal gain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is people that are walking in the realm of the flesh, &gt;&gt; just religious in their mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But missing the real calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is people who fail to discern the word and the plan of God because they're so self-centered and egotistic. &gt;&gt; And they fail to realize that this is God's people. &gt;&gt; That's God's servant. Hallelujah. That's God's promise that it is God that is amongst us that is bringing his word to pass. &gt;&gt; My we are speaking on the unseen realm. Angels to keep us in the way. I'm I'm still reading my my scriptures. I forgot what time I started. And Bam rose up. What time did I start? And B. Okay, we we'll find a place to stop. And Bam rose up in the morning. Watch now. Hallelujah. God says, "Okay, you want to go, go. &gt;&gt; Go do what you want. If you don't want Christ to be your head, go. &gt;&gt; Go, go." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't waste time. If you want to go, go, &gt;&gt; go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Bam rose up in the morning and settled his ass and he went with the princess of Mo of Moab. My now he's un unequally yolked. &gt;&gt; Now he's in a false union already. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit is checking. You know, I wonder how high this promotion is going to be. &gt;&gt; I wonder about my new office they will give me. Hey, my new car, petrol car. Hey, my iMac, my new salary. Oh my. Just look at the honor, the respect they giving me. What a privilege. What a position. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the man is boasting in his heart. And he said, I tell you what, if I was not perseverant perseverant, if I did not persist, not even God could have stopped me. &gt;&gt; I I I get God to change his mind. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; He had me go. You see, this man is in the permissible will of God. &gt;&gt; He's in his own will. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, some people can twist the word and live &gt;&gt; convincingly. &gt;&gt; You better have rugged faith in this hour. &gt;&gt; God is looking for real sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's anger was kindled because he went my Hallelujah. God's anger was kindled because he went. &gt;&gt; Because when God said go, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; he should have fallen on his face and said, "Lord, I'm so sorry for thinking like this. &gt;&gt; You said go because you want to show me how far I've gone under that influence already." &gt;&gt; You get that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I hope you are catching the &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Of his divine will and desire. Let the word stimulate your faith. Amen to walk deep with God &gt;&gt; because there is a conscience consciousness where I have to look in my own self to see where I am standing where my desire is. Hallelujah. I've got to see the foundation where I'm standing upon. &gt;&gt; Can I be easily moved when I'm under a little pressure? &gt;&gt; Can I be exploited and manipulated because I'm gullible and I can't tell big high people lay off me. Hallelujah. Because pressure moves a lot of people out of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Pressure moves people into false union. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Pressure bursts pipes. &gt;&gt; You better have something in you to keep the pressure out of your mind. &gt;&gt; Because brother madam tells us this is an age of pressure. &gt;&gt; You better have the place to let off the pressure. &gt;&gt; Is alive. You have all kinds of pressure. You have family pressure, husband pressure, wife pressure, job pressure, church pressure, children pressure, school pressure, peer pressure, money pressure, all kinds of pressure. He's alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't forget, we got high blood pressure, too. &gt;&gt; See, but the eagle is pressurized. &gt;&gt; The astronauts are pressurized in the zero hour astronaut faith. They have a pressurized suit, the word suit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; So we are seeing through the scriptures. We are following a man under temptation. &gt;&gt; We are following the warfare that is unfolding in the man's mind. Things that war against the man's soul. &gt;&gt; We are seeing that God is watching this man under trial. And we read where it says obey the angel and provoke him not. But we find this man struggling to obey the voice of the angel and he's not being kept in the way anymore. He's been pressured to go another way. &gt;&gt; Because the same angel, Hallelujah, that was talking to Moses was the same angel that was talking to Ba. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ba Bam did not believe like Janice and Jamus. &gt;&gt; Bam believed in one God. &gt;&gt; Bam offered the same sacrifice just like Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's not about being fundamentally correct. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's not mental faith that God wants us to possess. You need revelation. You need God in the control tower of your soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this man, watch this here. &gt;&gt; This man Balen was not void of spiritual activity. &gt;&gt; Genuine spiritual activity. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He had visions. He had encounters. The angel came to him. &gt;&gt; God spoke to him. Yes, &gt;&gt; this man operated in the measure of the supernatural. And then when people look at this man and say, "Oh, look how great he is." &gt;&gt; But watch how God is looking at the man's heart. &gt;&gt; He's resisting the very angel that was sent to guide him. &gt;&gt; How many knows our scriptures are given for inspiration? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many know laws is given for our correction, &gt;&gt; for instruction &gt;&gt; in righteousness, and it is profitable for doctrine? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God's anger was killed because he went, not because of the people he was going with, but because of what was in his heart when he went. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the moment he went, the moment he became unequally yolked, the fellowship between him and God began to get interrupted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Find out find out look at your spiritual life and see if your fellowship with God has been interrupted. Find out how much time that you listen to a tape, how much time you spend in prayer, how much time you want to read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How much time you want to really fellowship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now this this man was unequally yolked. And the fellowship between him and God began to become interrupted &gt;&gt; because of a desire &gt;&gt; that was overriding obedience to God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God realized this man can sell out. &gt;&gt; God realized this man can be bought and turned around. &gt;&gt; God realized that this man can be pressured and easily influenced. &gt;&gt; God realizing that this man wants a kingdom here on earth instead of walking with God who has a greater kingdom. God realizes that this man is not like Moses who gets his information and instruction from the logos, the angel of God, &gt;&gt; and to follow that angel for that angel was to keep them in the way. &gt;&gt; God realizes that this man could argue &gt;&gt; with that angel &gt;&gt; and this man resisting the angel all the time. He's trying to be compatible and nice to an earthly king &gt;&gt; Bao. Hallelujah. That's why you have to watch yourself under the light of the word. &gt;&gt; Watch yourself in circumstances. Watch yourself when you pressurize. Watch yourself and see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you said, Lord, just order my steps in your &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Nearer, my God, to thee angels to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're talking about angels to keep us in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This angels could have led Balen straight to his destiny. &gt;&gt; Straight to his destiny. right to the fulfilling of all his potential where he could be a blessing and where he could be content with his portion in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's caught here in a place of decision of testing. He's in a trial. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's taking sides against the truth. He's making the greatest mistake that he could ever make in his life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's thinking, my &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; that he can outsmart God. &gt;&gt; Just like Judas, &gt;&gt; smart Alex. Hallelujah. Judas thinking, you know, he's clever. He's thinking, you know, these uh uh Pharisees and Sadducees, these are just suckers, you know. You know, easy change I can make make from them. &gt;&gt; I'll point out Jesus. I'll give him a kiss. I'll point out Jesus. And you know, Jesus will just disappear into the crowd like he always does. You know, he just slips slips away. And me, I'll keep my cut. There'll be none the wiser. I'll keep my part of the bargain. And they can't claim the money back. Amen. &gt;&gt; He thought he could manipulate the word for profit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you find people like that always scheming, always angling to increase their earnings, even if it meant handling the son of man irreverently like him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People can't show reverence to the word. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, there too many people they are enjoying a spot of authority and influence in the message of the hour. the same as this man here. All the while the angel is watching you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My who was his adversary? &gt;&gt; God is adversary. What did we read before? Didn't he say I'll be an enemy unto your enemies? Didn't he say I'll be an adversary unto your adversaries? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now God has become an adversary to this man. &gt;&gt; Now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him. And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the wind. &gt;&gt; This year &gt;&gt; the ass gets conscious of the unseen world. &gt;&gt; The ass breaks into the realm of the supernatural &gt;&gt; and begins to see in two realms into two worlds in the visible and the invisible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet who had visions and spiritual manifestations, he's so blind. &gt;&gt; One minute he's talking to God the next morning, he's getting up early and he's riding his ass and he's speeding after the lust of the flesh and the pride of the life and he's moving along headlong into self-destruction. And God is his adversary and he don't know it. &gt;&gt; He's out of fellowship, out of position, out of the will of God. and he's totally unconscious of it. &gt;&gt; He has a memory. &gt;&gt; He has memory of spiritual experiences but no present tense awareness of his condition. &gt;&gt; That's a that's a trouble with a lot of people today. They're living on memory. &gt;&gt; They can't see present tense in their life. &gt;&gt; They are out of the will of God at present. They are bound up in sin. They misled. They have been exploited. They've been manipulated. And they're unconscious of it. M &gt;&gt; that is the state of Balum but he's still preaching &gt;&gt; and he's still prophesying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 23. And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and he saw drawn in his hands. &gt;&gt; My the ass realized he has no pardon in his hand, &gt;&gt; no mercy in his hand, no grace in his hand. He got no open book in his hand. He has no seal of God in his hand. But he has a sharp sword in his hand. Revelation 10:1, he had an open book in his hand. Revelation 7:2, he has the seal of God in his hand. Revelation 1, he has seven stars in his hand. But we have the angel stands with a sharp sword unshak. Hallelujah. The word going forth in judgment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like David, you know when he saw the angel with a drawn sword, you know what David did? He ran quickly and made atonement and the angel took the sword back. Shields the sword back. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because David went numbering the people in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Looking for popularity. &gt;&gt; Measuring success kindly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hear me here. He who marries the spirit of this world will become a widowerower &gt;&gt; in the world to come. &gt;&gt; Yes. having a lot of friends and having a lot of contacts &gt;&gt; in this world and making enemies in the next world. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you don't walk the way God wants you. &gt;&gt; The message don't have the desired effect and results it's supposed to have in you. &gt;&gt; Satan traps a lot of people in the mental realm of Christianity, making them think that they're having fellowship with God in the Holies of Holies. But what they have is that they don't even know that they're in the outer court. They they are just in the inner court. &gt;&gt; What they have is information. &gt;&gt; You meet people, they have a lot of information. &gt;&gt; They can tell you what's in the they can tell, "Oh, there there's the ark of the covenant. Oh, there there's the man with the golden pot. Oh, there it was Aaron's rod that bothered and bloomed overnight. Hallelujah. Oh, there the shakina." They can tell you a lot of things, but they themselves have never been there. &gt;&gt; Yes. They never entered into real fellowship with God. Where the veil of self has been rendered and where the veil of God has shut the world out and they shut in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For verse 23 and he says, "And the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balen now watch this fellow. He sought the ass to turn into the way." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the angel of the Lord stood in the path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side and a wall on that side. And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she thrust herself um into the wall and crushed Bum's foot against the wall and he smoked her again. Hallelujah. I mean, look at this. &gt;&gt; Bam full of rage. &gt;&gt; He's like, you know, he's he's trying to control this donkey now. What's the matter with you? &gt;&gt; What's wrong with you? We finally got you want Ba to give this appointment to somebody else now. &gt;&gt; You know how many people want this position? &gt;&gt; Didn't Didn't you hear the angel say, "If I don't get there on time, I could lose out on this thing here. What's the matter with you now? &gt;&gt; You slowing me down here? I mean, I look after you so well. I give you water. I give you food. I give you nice shelter. I gave you nice rest last night. And and and and this morning you're going slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. I checked your wounds. Nothing wrong with your feet. Your tires are in good condition. I'm expected to make so much mileage per hour. I'm supposed to get that in a certain time and you slowing me down here. What's the matter with you? &gt;&gt; You know, help us. &gt;&gt; But the ass is sensitive to the unseen dimension &gt;&gt; that has opened up to her. &gt;&gt; Angelic beings. She saw an angel with a drawn sword, eyes like flames of fire and feet like fine brass and an angel was counting and shine like the sun in his full strength. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the ass look at Bale and says, "Oh, you can beat me as much as you want. You need somebody more crazy than me to go in there. You're not going to push me in there. You rather beat me and kill me here because it's easier to deal with you here than to deal with the one that is standing there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may not fear God. You might be some big puffed up shirt and you might think that you are somebody with all your little spiritual experiences, but me, I'm just a little donkey. &gt;&gt; Just a small little donkey, old donkey. And and brother, I don't want to die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't want to die because that man with a drawn sword ain't looking friendly at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. The men of Bao seduce him and pressurize him in a way that he could not pressurize his own donkey. &gt;&gt; The donkey had more resistant power than he had to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; The donkey is a type of the unbeliever. Is that right? But it's original. It's not a mule. is not hybridized. He could be redeemed accord according to um Exodus chapter 13, but here now he's sitting on the donkey is already hybridized and seduced. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You ever see people fight things that are trying to help them? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This angel here is there is to help him. He's fighting that angel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see people in the church fight the things that are trying to help them. They fight the wives. They fight the husband. They fight this person. They fight the pastor. They fight everybody. &gt;&gt; They fight the angel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he starts to beat this donkey. He couldn't move the donkey, I tell you. &gt;&gt; Verse 26. And the angel of the Lord went further and stood in a narrow place. Are you catching that? Yes. &gt;&gt; First the angel blocks the field in the blocks the path in the field and then Bam beats the donkey. Then the angel moves and stands in the vineyard at a tighter space and Balam strikes the donkey again. And now the angel goes further still with the sword in his hand to a narrow place. No room to turn left or to turn right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see what's happening? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And and and I'm telling you, be sensitive to what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is closing the road inch by inch. &gt;&gt; But Bam keeps lashing out. &gt;&gt; You see believers sometime God puts roadblocks in their lives. &gt;&gt; God is blocking their way. Hallelujah. And sometime things are not working out. You know, business is drying up, that relationship falls apart, doors keep closing and nothing seems to work about. And God God just doesn't want you to go down the road. He don't want you to have that business. He don't want you to go with that boy. He don't want you to go with that girl. He don't want you to have that relationship. He don't want you to get involved in those things. And God is blocking the way. But all the time we are looking for a detour. &gt;&gt; He block your way. You're trying to climb over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at Ben. He's so drunk with prestige, with greed, drunk with ambition, so gripped for by lust for earthly things, and he can't see that God is angry and God is blocking up the way. &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen? &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord went further and stood in a narrow place. There was no way to turn either to the right um hand or to the left. Always trying to negotiate, &gt;&gt; trying to find a way. He go there, the angel is there. He go there, the angel is there. &gt;&gt; Look at him. Hallelujah. Hellbent, hellbent, self-will, greed, lust for power. Amen. In the book, Peter says in second Peter 2, he says, he said, the madness of the prophet, self-will and eyes full of adultery, and the dumb ass spake with a man's voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, and Peter said, many have gone in the way of Bam in the New Testament. I'm quoting that because when you read the New Testament, you see Peter walked with angels, too. &gt;&gt; The same angel that came to Moses, the same angel that came to Balam is the same angel that came to Peter. &gt;&gt; He's the same angel that took him out of prison. He's the same angel that came on the rooftop revealing the vision. It was the same angel that brought the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. It was the same angel that came to Cornelius and and told him, "Send for Peter at the house of Simon the Tanner." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like Moses walked with the angel in his Exodus journey, Peter walked with the a same angel in his hour. And just like Moses faced Balam, Peter had men in his day going in the way of Balam. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Balam is not history. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit that still lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's still amongst us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So catch this now. Amen. In this very rhythm here, right here in time, we are either being anointed by angels from the presence of God or we are being influenced by fallen angels and demon spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We walk in this world in this three-dimensional world. &gt;&gt; We are influenced from somewhere. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, not one of you are walking neutral here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are walking under influence from somewhere. &gt;&gt; You are reflecting something. &gt;&gt; Paul says Satan transforms his angels into ministers of light. &gt;&gt; But we thank God that Michael has angels too. &gt;&gt; Anointed messengers who can catch the revealed word, who can sound the trumpet in Zion, who can wield the sword of the spirit, who can lead the bright church forward in &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I fought with beasts at Ephesus." He wasn't talking about wild animals. &gt;&gt; He meant the people who rose up against the world. &gt;&gt; He said, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers and rulers of the darkness of this world and spiritual wickedness, high places." So, who was So, so who was Moses really contending with? &gt;&gt; A king, yes. But more than that, he was a ruler &gt;&gt; of darkness. &gt;&gt; He was a man sitting on a throne operating with authority and dominion. &gt;&gt; He was a principality. &gt;&gt; That's not just politics. &gt;&gt; That's spiritual power embedded in earthly systems. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing that? &gt;&gt; Can you catch the word? &gt;&gt; That was the Old Testament, but it shadows our day. Paul takes the same battle and brings it into the New Testament. Brings it into this generation. &gt;&gt; Then we have men that are walking in high places. Not necessarily in evil form, but driven but driven by another spirit. &gt;&gt; Look at the modern examples. Men like Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, all those big names. When the real confrontation came, when the challenge came, the word challenge came, you find these men disappeared, vanished into the denominations. Oral Roberts went to Australia. They run him out as a fake trying to play gimmicks with the word touch radio and touch post and pretending they had a gift in their hand too. Pretenders, imitations &gt;&gt; and when imitations always fail, the real is made manifest. Brother Brham went to India and he challenged every devil. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham came on to the African continent onto African soil and he defeated every unclean spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whilst there were men that were trying to rise up and impersonate like Janice Jamas, they didn't know where these things were coming from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't know that this prophet William Brandham was moving under the pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't know that this prophet was being led by an angel to hunt out the seed of God and to bring sons into manifestation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My you love me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going too slow like the donkey. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to hold you here in type because the first Exodus is typing this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believers are unconscious of the unseen world. That's why they live anyhow, speak anyhow, say anything. &gt;&gt; But God has a ministry of angels to keep us in their way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, &gt;&gt; angels took Peter out of prison. &gt;&gt; Angels made Paul on the ship. &gt;&gt; Angels took Philillip to Samaria. &gt;&gt; Is that in the Bible? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Angelic beings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ministers carrying the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to hear me what I say. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Who Who were they? Hallelujah. Who was Philillip? &gt;&gt; Who was Peter? Who was Paul? Who were they? &gt;&gt; They were not Sadducees. They were not Pharisees. &gt;&gt; They were message ministers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And angels came to shepherd message ministers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You hear me? What I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Angels came to shepherd message ministers. God can't break his pattern. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, &gt;&gt; watch veil him closely. This man is unaware of the unseen world and he was making the most disastrous mistake of his life. He didn't even realize it. His mind was in bondage to the seducer. &gt;&gt; He's going straight into destruction. He's been led out of the way into error to come against God. M &gt;&gt; didn't the Bible says in the last days that men will give heed to seducing spirits &gt;&gt; and they will turn away from the truth. They will give heed to fables and to doctrines of devils and then hybridize the church. &gt;&gt; Didn't Bam didn't Balam end up in a false doctrine? &gt;&gt; Isn't that what is repeating in our day? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was in the first Exodus shows up in the second second exodus &gt;&gt; and is multiplied in the third exodus. &gt;&gt; It's here again. &gt;&gt; Go in the Bible and look at the procession of that spirit of Balum. Peter called it the way of Balum. Jude called it the error of Balum. John identified it as the doctrine of Balum. &gt;&gt; See, it kept going deeper and deeper and deeper. &gt;&gt; You know what Balen Balenism is? It's a corrupt form of worship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's men that's puffed up. putting confidence in the flesh, making a show, marketing their gift. They want a following. &gt;&gt; We got many men like this. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about denominations. Look in the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet God wants men to be a prisoner &gt;&gt; to his word. &gt;&gt; I tell you, some people are so spiritual, they don't even know they have been seduced. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Just look at the longsuffering of God. He goes this way, God goes there. He goes that way, God goes there. He goes that way, God goes there. &gt;&gt; Verse 27, I think we are here. And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she fell down under Balam. And Bam's anger was kindled, and he smoked the ass with a staff. &gt;&gt; And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balam, &gt;&gt; "What have I done to thee &gt;&gt; that thou has smitten me these three times? What have I done today? &gt;&gt; You smitten me these three times. You beating me. You beating me. &gt;&gt; And you beating me. &gt;&gt; You can't see the angel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you something about the unseen. &gt;&gt; You can't see the unseen. &gt;&gt; There's a man standing there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bam. Verse 29. And Bam said unto the ass, "Because thou has mocked me, oh my who?" Balam said unto the ass, "Because thou has mocked me." &gt;&gt; Look, look here. Careful. Look, look, look. &gt;&gt; The man is so unconscious. &gt;&gt; He and the donkey having fellowship. &gt;&gt; They are talking. &gt;&gt; They're talking. Friends, you think blindness is an easy thing. &gt;&gt; What was bringing the blindness? &gt;&gt; Obsession. &gt;&gt; Obsession. &gt;&gt; Obsession. His mind was captured. It shows how he was seduced by Bao. &gt;&gt; Bail and his messages had preached him to a place where he was blind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet of God says, "The day that you take man as your leader, that's the day you die." &gt;&gt; Yes. That's a quote from leadership. Let me tell you something. The bride can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The bride can't be caught up in cunning cunningly devised fables, &gt;&gt; man tricks and smart ortors. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come back to the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you want to enjoy the word before you can enjoy the ministry in church, enjoy the ministry at home. &gt;&gt; Enjoy your fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; Enjoy your time in the presence of God Almighty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. If you don't listen to a tape at home, if you don't pray, if you don't fast, if you don't if you don't read your Bible and you come to listen in the church, you'll be a critic. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll be a critic. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Ba, "What have I done to thee that thou has smitten me these three times?" And Balam said unto the ass, because thou has mocked me, and I would, catch this, mocked me, I would wear a sword in mine, for now would I kill thee. Man, this fellow can imagine now trying to control this donkey. Yeah. And he's now he's boiling with rage. And he says, I beat you these three times with my staff and you are still so stubborn. He says, if I had a sword in my hand, you'll be a dead bleeding donkey right now. He wanted a sword in his hand. &gt;&gt; The angel had a sword in his hand. What he wanted to do to the donkey is what the angels wanted to do to him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many knows the man's judgment was coming right out of his mouth? &gt;&gt; How many knows that Joshua kindled him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Numbers chapter 31 with a sword. &gt;&gt; Verse 30. And the ass said unto Balen, "Watch, am not I thine ass upon which thou has ridden ever since I was dying unto this day." &gt;&gt; He's like the ass is complaining now. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, you know, have I ever let you down? You know, I am not I thine ass upon which thou has written ever since I was dying until this day." I mean, you just hop on, you just hop off. I mean, I I've never broken down on the road before. &gt;&gt; I'm so reliable. You don't even take a maintenance plan for me. You don't even take insurance for me. &gt;&gt; And this is how you're treating me. &gt;&gt; Treat your transport better than that now, would you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has God has some of your cars talking to you &gt;&gt; and you still can't see him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, help me here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let me be a blessing to your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was I ever one to do so? And he said, "Nay." Hallelujah. You've never let me down. &gt;&gt; Then in verse 31, then the Lord opened the eyes of Bale. &gt;&gt; Just like the Lord opened the eyes of Gahazi, Elisha's servant, and he saw &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Another realm, chariots of fire, horses of fire, an army in the invisible realm. &gt;&gt; Verse 31. Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balen and Hallelujah and I trust he'd open your eyes to this morning. &gt;&gt; And he saw the angel of the Lord standing the way and he sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and he fell flat on his face. Verse 32. And the angel of the Lord said unto him, wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? My the angel was checking every time. Every time he start to curse, every time he he he he get vexed, every time he get full of rage and anger, &gt;&gt; the angel was marking it down, recording every bit of his stubbornness and his selfworth because the angel knows how many times you give him a roadblock. But he hardened, rebellious. The angel is standing in the way not to destroy you. &gt;&gt; Angel is standing in your way to save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if some of you could see that angel with a sword this morning say, "Thy way is perverse before me because I find you this morning not walking in my word." M &gt;&gt; I find you this morning in self work, &gt;&gt; pressured by man, pressured out of my way. I find you this morning seduced and manipulated and exploited. I find you this morning this morning chasing after your own lustful desires and ambitions. And I find your way perverse before &gt;&gt; and the ass saw me and turned from me these three times. Unless she turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee and saved her alive. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is saying, "I would have killed you &gt;&gt; and saved the donkey." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Catch that. &gt;&gt; I would have killed you and saved the donkey. &gt;&gt; Yes. You see, you might have an accident and you may go flying through the windshield and lying in some ditch with your neck snapped dead &gt;&gt; and somebody else come, maybe not even a saved person will come and push your car out of the ditch, knock out the dents and send it back on the road. &gt;&gt; God is saying, "I'll save their ass and kill you." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that in your Bible? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that in your Bible? Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought I read something wrong here. Somebody look, some of you look like you seen a ghost. &gt;&gt; I hope it's the Holy Ghost. Verse 34. And Bam said unto the angel of the Lord, I have sinned, for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me. Look at this fellow now like believers pinging ignorance after they know the will of God. Oh, God. I didn't know that there. Didn't God say the angel is to keep you in the way? Obey his voice and provoke him not. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he allowed himself to be pressured and seduced and be taken into separate places. &gt;&gt; And now he says, "I have sinned for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me." That's not revelation. That's regret because he got caught. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. People repent because they get caught. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at how many are like Bam today. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; They come to the altar, small tears fall down. There's a soft voice. Lord, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Lord, I was confused. momentary repentance &gt;&gt; like Ahab walking softly after the prophecy fell &gt;&gt; like Saul you know after um uh the prophet Samuel found him he says I have sinned yet he was saying in the next verse honor me now before the people you see service is going on and people get uh uh you know the anointing is there and uh people get convicted and they get emotionally moved moved &gt;&gt; and then when they step out of church, they step right back into the very things that they repented. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Often people repent, but they walk out of church with the same appetite, &gt;&gt; with the same plans, with the same secret lust, right back into the thing they just said they are leaving behind. &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God, let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; You might please man here in this realm because man is always watching you. man is always judging you. But what I'm trying to open to you this morning is that there is another realm. There is a another dimension that there is another world right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the tragedy is that people live completely unconscious of the unseen world. &gt;&gt; They are so unaware, so insensitive. But this morning, this message is designed to make you more sensitive to help to raise your level of awareness, to make you conscious of the unseen world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; What is the time? Somebody tell me when he's saying 12:00. Okay. I'm showing you in the Bible a man whose way is perverse before God. &gt;&gt; God wants to kill him. He's out of the will of God. &gt;&gt; He's a man who has had supernatural manifestations in his life. &gt;&gt; But God is saying to him, I find your way perverse before me. &gt;&gt; You see, he isn't seeing the kind of fruit he's bearing. &gt;&gt; Because the tree is known by the fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit. and a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit. &gt;&gt; Now, let me try and summarize and then find a place where we can stop and I'm sure your pastor or other brothers can pick up these things. There's so much there. &gt;&gt; Now, everything that you read in the Bible, you examine the scriptures from Genesis all the way down to Revelation. You track every supernatural manifestation in the Bible. You look for every great act of faith, miracles, signs, wonders, deliverances. It's always traced back to this one fact that it was people who was conscious of the unseen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Nothing, hear me? Nothing was done outside of that dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything came from that dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham had faith to receive a promise because an angel called him out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; An angel revealed to him the mystery of circumcision. &gt;&gt; The angel revealed to him the mystery of justification. &gt;&gt; The angel revealed to him the mystery of the time and the season when the promised son would come. &gt;&gt; It was an angel that revealed the destruction that was coming upon Sodom. It was an angel that stayed his hand when he was about to slay Isaac. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was the angel that declared, "Your seed shall possess, hallelujah, the gates of the enemy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels, friends, we are speaking about &gt;&gt; Jacob's first experience with God was at battle. See, angels ascending and descending a ladder. &gt;&gt; God top man at the bottom. &gt;&gt; That's why he could say, "This is the gate to heaven. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. &gt;&gt; God said to Moses, "I send my angel to keep the inway." &gt;&gt; An angel came to Gideon to give him assurance when he was hiding at the wine press. &gt;&gt; An angel came to Joshua to take people into the inheritance. An angel came to Daniel in Babylon. &gt;&gt; An angel came to Elijah and give him special cakes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. to take away his frustration and to calm him down so that he could go and finish his ministry without complaining. &gt;&gt; Angels was with Elisha. Angels was with David. &gt;&gt; Whether it's the Old Testament or whether it's the New Testaments. Amen. It is angels all &gt;&gt; angels ministered to Jesus after his temptations. &gt;&gt; Angels strengthened him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Angels with Peter, angel with Philip, angels with Paul. And when it comes back to the apostolic age, &gt;&gt; angels come back to a prophet to open the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And began to show him his strange and misunderstood life. &gt;&gt; When it came to the opening of the seventh seal to call out a bride and to set her in order to bring her into an invisible union, to bring her into rapturing faith. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Angels came from heaven to open up the &gt;&gt; sea. &gt;&gt; Nothing in the entire Bible, the whole book of Hebrews chapter 11 is by faith angels. &gt;&gt; Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Abraham, Rehea, all received angels. &gt;&gt; Whether it was Revelation, an angel came to Daniel to open up the book. An angel came to Paul and open up the book. An angel came to Malachi 4 and opened up the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether it was healing, an angel came down to the pool of Bethesda. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said that the brass serpent never healed nobody. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it was the angel Jehovah Rafi the Lord that healed all thy diseases. He sended into the pool. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many knows this story here? You know um brother brother Bossworth he you know him and brother Brandon were bosom friends and buddies. He had come to South Africa and and normally he when there was big healing campaigns, brother Bosworth would go forth first and he would set the platform and set the tone and then brother Brandon would come and minister and you know have those services and brother Boswood had come to demon uh come to South Africa and when he was in South Africa he got sick. &gt;&gt; He had picked up an amieba see and he was dying. So the brothers sent a telegram to brother Brham saying brother Boswward is dying please pray for him. &gt;&gt; See and brother Brandham brother Boswood is in South Africa and brother Brandham is in America. He was on the hills of I think New Albany. He had took his wife sister Mina for her drive. See all the time the brothers in South Africa are saying check if the check check check if the telegram has received it. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, it's not like what we have today. You know, it's not um you know, where we have WhatsApp instant messaging and all these different things and and you know, uh video calling and video conferencing and all of that. No, it didn't have anything of that sort. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, the brothers are all the time checking to see if the telegram had reached brother Brandham. Then while brother Blan is driving on on the hills of New Albany, he breaks into a vision and he sees what's happening in South Africa that brother Boswood is dying. &gt;&gt; The man says that he was driving for more than 10 minutes around around those those hills and he says and then he stopped the car and he says to sister Mira um brother Boswell is dying and then he steps out and he leaves and he prays for brother Boswell. &gt;&gt; All the time the brothers are checking to see if the telegram has reached brother. You see, and then the brothers all of a sudden say, "Don't bother about contacting Brother Brandham." Somehow, Brother Bosworth is healed. Mysteriously, &gt;&gt; he recovered Philly. &gt;&gt; The next day, Brother Brandham went to the Pan-American Airlines to check for the telegram. And brother Brandham makes this statement here. He says, "The angel of the Lord beat the telegram by 24 hours. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you that same angel is writing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That same angel knows you got a brown shirt, a denim skirt. Hallelujah. That same angel is more than able to meet your heart's desire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This that same angel can change your life tonight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe it, angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. live in the pull pits this morning if you have discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where do we live then, brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; Why is there such an unconsciousness, such a lack of awareness? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The angels. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me give you this last illustration and and and then then we'll close. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How how many of you have spoken to um someone um maybe overseas on the telephone? Mhm. &gt;&gt; It's not a trick question, please. So, don't get nervous here. But I want to show you something. You you speak to people, you know, thousands of miles away and you think nothing of it. &gt;&gt; You dial the number with confidence. You believe it's a channel of communication and once the voice comes through, you know exactly who you are talking to. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you and that person are in two separate locations, &gt;&gt; two different worlds. Yet you are in communion because you have a channel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now man through signs wasn't content with just a voice. So what did he do? He broke into another barrier. &gt;&gt; Opened up another dimension. Now we have FaceTime, Zoom, &gt;&gt; video calls. &gt;&gt; Now you don't just hear the voice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see the one that you are speaking. Yes. &gt;&gt; You see the image behind the voice. &gt;&gt; Are you following? &gt;&gt; Like the prophet said, I heard the voice in the tree. &gt;&gt; I heard the voice by the river. &gt;&gt; But when I was in the cave, &gt;&gt; I saw the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He went from hearing the voice to seeing the image face to face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he was just a young boy, a reckless sinner, you know, yet God gave him access to a whirlwind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A voice in nature. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But after the new birth, God stepped in another realm with him and opened up the word and unveiled his own presence. &gt;&gt; Not a visitation. God stepped into him, &gt;&gt; used his voice, spoke through his lips, moved through his body. Not just a communication, but it was an incarnation. &gt;&gt; Friends, God is raising his church to a higher place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bringing them to meet him face to face. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's bringing them into a oneness, into a holy union in this very hour under a message ministered by angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel of the covenant calling the bride into divine fellowship into the unseen realm made visible by revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Signs opening up a channel. &gt;&gt; Opening up realms that was previously invisible to man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God in this hour opening up mysteries to the church that was previously shut up. But an angel opened up that angel. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; An angel ministered a new and a living way to bring God's people into the unfailing realities of his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon could say the Bible has become the road map to the power of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This morning, Hallelujah. The angel, he's saying, I am that angel that can change your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. He changed Jacob's name because Jacob needed a new walk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jacob came into it because he got a hold of an angel. &gt;&gt; That's right.
