[2:22] of the Lord amen amen amen hallelujah
[2:26] amen reach all in the precious name of
[2:28] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[2:31] even as we see it the day fast
[2:32] approaching we are getting more and more
[2:35] excited amen we can see scriptures
[2:37] coming to pass amen we can see prophecy
[2:40] is coming to pass and more especially we
[2:43] can see we are becoming more into his
[2:44] word image hallelujah amen yes that's
[2:47] our biggest sign are we becoming more
[2:49] and more like Jesus and if you can
[2:52] testify to that bless you Lord amen
[2:54] hallelujah you know even as the day is
[2:57] fast approaching that should be our

[3:22] thank you Jesus wonderful is your name
[3:26] amen
[3:27] thank you Jesus amen I notice a lot of
[3:30] songs were being sung about coming of
[3:32] the Lord and amen going away
[3:36] amen and I believe that's the time and
[3:39] hour that we're living in so we'll try
[3:40] to Titus Chapter
[3:42] two
[3:45] amen read from verse 11
[3:50] . you speak a little thoughtful and I'll
[3:52] pray night service amen
[4:02] maybe just a little question in our
[4:04] title to ask how are we making
[4:06] preparation amen amen
[4:09] amen
[4:11] so Titus Chapter 2 verse 11 says for the
[4:14] grace of God that bringeth salvation
[4:17] at the pier to all men
[4:20] amen just that verse alone I just want
[4:22] to Rejoice because it's by Grace the
[4:26] grace of God and brought salvation
[4:28] it's not my own words it's not your
[4:30] words it's not our own choosing it's God
[4:32] who chose us
[4:34] therefore I can't fail Hallelujah if he
[4:38] shows us from before the foundation of
[4:39] the world how are we ever going to fail
[4:41] how are we ever going to fault her how
[4:43] are we not gonna make it amen hallelujah
[4:45] we have already made it
[4:49] yes yes if healing is to be taken by
[4:53] that attitude
[4:54] that we are already healed
[4:56] salvation is the same thing he that
[4:59] believes confess with his mouth believe
[5:01] in his heart amen he shall be saved so
[5:05] everything in this life is working by a
[5:07] law and it's to believe by faith so it's
[5:10] the same way I've already made it it's
[5:13] already done teaching us that denying
[5:16] ungodliness
[5:18] and worldly lust we should live soberly
[5:21] righteously and godly in this present
[5:24] world
[5:25] so how are we making preparation there
[5:27] are we following this are we living
[5:29] soberly righteously and godly in this
[5:31] present world now what is the condition
[5:33] of the present world the present world
[5:35] is unworthy it's unrighteous amen it's
[5:38] in drunkenness nakedness amen looking
[5:42] for that blessed hope
[5:45] and the Glorious appearing of the great
[5:48] God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen
[5:51] thank you amen that's what we are
[5:53] looking for that's where our eyes are
[5:54] looking and focusing now that's what we
[5:57] are making preparation for looking for
[5:59] that blessed hope and the Glorious
[6:01] appearing of the great God and our
[6:03] Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for
[6:06] us that he might redeem us from all
[6:09] iniquity and purify unto himself a
[6:12] peculiar people yes

[7:26] so to all our Godly women the world
[7:32] is celebrating women's day and that's
[7:34] why we got the day off right
[7:38] so but they are Godly women
[7:41] amen and we thank God for godly woman if
[7:43] there were no godly woman
[7:45] we wouldn't have families yes amen we
[7:49] wouldn't be able to keep the morals and
[7:50] standards of the message yes
[7:53] I don't know if you're thinking about
[7:54] that right now
[7:56] but if our woman didn't support us amen
[7:58] yes in the gospel and in the Kingdom the
[8:01] woman were always co-workers in the
[8:03] kingdom of God you read the book of Acts
[8:05] that were always co-workers for the
[8:07] Branham says when God calls a man he
[8:09] calls his wife also
[8:11] oh I don't know if you hear it yes amen
[8:13] amen amen yeah yeah amen when the
[8:17] prophet was preaching and hammering the
[8:19] woman he was hammering the ungodly women
[8:21] right but we are to honor Godly women
[8:26] your wife is listening to you right now
[8:28] and she's not happy with your your
[8:31] sad amen
[8:33] we are to honor Godly women
[8:36] yes amen hallelujah woman that God is
[8:39] raised up in this hour Amen to stand
[8:42] beside us in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[8:45] and I want you to know if you trace down
[8:47] to history you will see that women were
[8:50] used
[8:52] in the lineage of Jesus Christ
[8:54] women were used at his crucifixion and
[8:57] at his resurrection
[8:59] the men were scared they ran away yes
[9:04] if these two women didn't uh three women
[9:07] didn't go down there
[9:09] on Sunday morning the angel couldn't
[9:11] have told anyone he's risen
[9:14] yes but because some women had a concern
[9:17] amen
[9:20] they went there and they met the angel
[9:22] of the Lord
[9:24] amen amen amen praise the Lord praise
[9:27] the Lord so women the fall came through
[9:29] women but Salvation has come through a
[9:32] woman as well Mary
[9:34] amen The Chosen vessel that was highly
[9:36] favored amongst all women amen and then
[9:39] you see amen how God used amen people
[9:42] like Rahab amen people like Ruth amen
[9:45] glory be to his name amen I see you very
[9:47] uncomfortable when we talk about godly
[9:49] woman and praise them amen amen you're
[9:52] so used to bashing the woman
[9:54] okay but we thank God for women so we
[9:57] say God bless you to all our Godly women
[10:00] and mothers amen they can create homes
[10:02] for us that we can live the gospel
[10:06] we can teach the gospel amen praise the
[10:10] Lord Give the Lord a good act of Praise
[10:11] come on
[10:13] amen
[10:14] Rejoice I don't know why you're like hey
[10:18] it's good things about women yeah come
[10:20] on now
[10:23] amen hallelujah
[10:25] so we we're talking here about how are
[10:29] we preparing for the promise
[10:32] how are we preparing for whatever now
[10:34] the promise can be anything
[10:36] but we are talking here we just read
[10:37] about the promise of the coming of the
[10:39] Lord right but you may be preparing for
[10:41] many other things in your life
[10:43] now you can't approach things without
[10:45] preparation anything in life requires
[10:48] preparation and we as humans are so
[10:50] particular about our preparations
[10:53] we will take a great time and strengthen
[10:56] and create sacrifices to make
[10:58] preparations for Earthly things
[11:00] you younger people that's in school or
[11:02] maybe you're preparing for exam or
[11:04] preparing for whatever the test you're
[11:06] doing you will take great pains and and
[11:08] go late hours into the night to study
[11:11] make preparation because you want to
[11:13] pass your test
[11:15] but when it comes to the things of God
[11:17] we don't take that same time
[11:19] the same pains the same efforts
[11:23] the things of God become casual to us
[11:26] yes amen we don't we don't approach him
[11:28] to the same fervency about sleepless
[11:31] nights studying the word of the Lord I
[11:32] know there's a few but I'm saying in
[11:33] reality how much of how many of us have
[11:36] sleepless nights
[11:38] because the word of God is so impressed
[11:40] Upon Our Hearts and all we can think
[11:42] about is him
[11:43] all we can think about is his word yes
[11:46] Lord amen how many of us can get up amen
[11:49] early parts we burn the midnight oil for
[11:51] an exam but how about we Burning
[11:53] Midnight Hour to understand this word to
[11:55] read his word to get closer to God amen
[11:58] amen but that's how we are making
[12:00] preparations
[12:01] for the coming of the Lord amen so real
[12:04] faith will create an expectation in you
[12:06] we've been talking about freed for a
[12:08] while now amen you know that we said
[12:11] that this year shall be the most
[12:12] Supernatural year for the church but how
[12:14] have you been preparing for it have you
[12:16] been a casual Observer waiting to see
[12:18] all the supernatural or have you become
[12:20] involved in it are you part of the
[12:22] supernatural acting of God Amen but real
[12:25] faith will create an expectation and
[12:27] will move you to make preparations
[12:30] whether you see it or not
[12:32] whether you see signs of it or not you
[12:34] will start to make preparation for it
[12:36] amen amen now the prophet teaches us
[12:39] that there are two things that control
[12:41] the world and that that control people
[12:43] that control churches controls
[12:45] individuals control Nations and that is
[12:47] fear and
[12:49] faith
[12:51] only two things he says Russia and even
[12:54] right now Russia is in the news he's
[12:56] trying to control Everyone by fear
[13:00] and we are trying to amen get the people
[13:03] of God to move into faith in this time
[13:05] amen hallelujah I mean if you know the
[13:08] thing required for the Rapture is sweet
[13:11] that's why it's called rapturing faith
[13:14] amen hallelujah so what is that if
[13:17] you're calling about let's say healing
[13:19] Faith you need to have confidence in the
[13:21] word of God what he says about his word
[13:24] that even if there is a sickness come
[13:26] upon the Earth today
[13:29] that God has never healed that sickness
[13:31] before
[13:32] follow my thought now don't base it on
[13:35] because God healed that person of cancer
[13:37] one time he'll heal me again yes if it's
[13:39] met on the same conditions yes but I'm
[13:41] saying believe the word of God so much
[13:43] that even if it's a new disease even if
[13:45] it's a new sickness he's still able to
[13:47] heal it because when he said
[13:50] we were here for all sicknesses he
[13:53] didn't label the sickness
[13:55] yes well thank you Jesus amen thank you
[13:59] Lord
[14:00] it just says bye you swipes we were
[14:02] healed
[14:03] now if you really understand the mind of
[14:05] God when he's saying bye you sweat you
[14:07] were healed he was dealing with
[14:09] Redemption so he redeemed man completely
[14:11] so that every sickness was covered under
[14:14] that yes
[14:16] so don't care what comes tomorrow thank
[14:19] you she'll apply the word that's why the
[14:21] word of God is the same yesterday today
[14:23] and forever thank you Lord sicknesses
[14:25] that exist today didn't exist probably
[14:27] back then but he's still the same God
[14:29] who heals amen
[14:32] so you can't have both fear and faith
[14:35] sometimes it happens and it cripples me
[14:37] but one will cancel out the other amen
[14:40] yes one will cancel out the other you
[14:43] can't be fearful and then saying I'm
[14:44] having free then you're like that boy
[14:46] walking through the graveyard whistling
[14:49] amen is fearful but he's whistling as if
[14:52] he's got faith and he's Brave
[14:54] amen now we also know that fear has no
[14:58] value to it
[15:00] absolutely no value
[15:03] because fear is useless yes amen
[15:07] fear hasn't got one good thing about it
[15:09] amen the prophet will use this example
[15:12] and he says if you were going to be shot
[15:13] in the morning
[15:15] what good would it do to be fearful
[15:18] will fear change the situation he says
[15:21] what good amen but he says if you have
[15:23] faith faith can do you some good because
[15:25] faith can get you out of that situation
[15:30] Faith could deliver you but fear won't
[15:33] help you
[15:34] amen your fear will just get you all
[15:36] worked up
[15:38] amen fear will get you more nervous
[15:42] amen now take that away from being shot
[15:44] now and into your situation some of you
[15:47] are trusting God for things but you are
[15:49] fearful
[15:52] you are thinking maybe God won't answer
[15:54] me you are thinking what in case this
[15:56] doesn't work
[15:58] then your faith is not based on the
[16:00] absolute that's right amen hallelujah
[16:03] you can't be double-minded about the
[16:05] things of God and about the promises of
[16:07] God Amen Faith could deliver you amen
[16:10] feel one helped me didn't Jesus tell us
[16:12] amen not to worry he said do not worry
[16:17] do not worry do not be anxious about
[16:20] anything worry cannot help the situation
[16:22] but amen what can turn it around his
[16:24] faith in the word of God
[16:27] amen so we got to stay in the right
[16:29] atmosphere of faith
[16:31] amen anybody that's coming to India your
[16:33] atmosphere of Faith you've got to tell
[16:35] them hold on hold on hold on now that's
[16:37] right I'm trying to live in this world
[16:39] of perfect faith and you're trying to
[16:40] bring all your unbelief and negativity
[16:42] around me I will have none of it amen
[16:44] you go change your atmosphere and then
[16:46] you can talk to me
[16:48] yes don't allow people to change the
[16:50] atmosphere around you yes
[16:53] thank you Father
[16:55] amen hallelujah
[16:57] at work they play music
[17:00] and it creates a bad Vibe and a bad
[17:02] energy
[17:03] so I got them I got this guy yesterday
[17:05] yeah yesterday I told him please come I
[17:09] don't care I put the letter there and I
[17:10] cut the wire so there's no music coming
[17:12] into my office now
[17:14] amen yes
[17:17] amen we've got to stay in the right
[17:19] atmosphere
[17:20] sometimes it'll make you do bold things
[17:23] but you gotta stay in the right
[17:25] atmosphere why we're allowing these
[17:27] unbelieving Devils to come and
[17:28] intimidate us and breath in a bad
[17:30] atmosphere because these strong scary
[17:32] spirits
[17:35] amen but you don't care
[17:38] you wait to jump in the taxi you'll wait
[17:40] that tax you got no speakers so you're
[17:41] waiting for the next taxi that's got
[17:43] some
[17:45] [Music]
[17:46] hey
[17:50] so what I'm saying preserve your
[17:51] atmosphere of Faith you've been laboring
[17:53] so long to live in an atmosphere of free
[17:56] you can't allow other people to come now
[17:58] and and change your atmosphere to
[18:00] influence you you're supposed to build
[18:03] upon your Most Holy Faith
[18:05] amen so we ought to be progressing we
[18:08] ought to be able Faith ought to be
[18:09] measurable
[18:13] and faith is miserable because Jesus
[18:15] spoke about it
[18:16] amen he spoke to the disciples and he
[18:19] says oh yeah little faith yeah
[18:22] yeah then when he seen another person he
[18:24] says I've never seen such great faith in
[18:26] all of Israel so faith is miserable amen
[18:31] and if God had to ask you this evening
[18:32] how miserable is your faith how does it
[18:35] stand on God's feet scale
[18:39] amen will your faith chip the scale
[18:43] or if you'd wait in the balance and
[18:45] found wanted
[18:46] amen hallelujah but we're coming now
[18:49] into a time where we must have perfect
[18:50] Faith amen amen yes it's no longer just
[18:54] an option
[18:55] we've got to have perfect faith
[18:58] amen amen hallelujah amen so we're going
[19:02] to stay in the right atmosphere and you
[19:04] must believe in God and believe in his
[19:06] word as the absolute I need that to sing
[19:09] now from just your head to your heart
[19:11] that this Bible and everything that's
[19:13] written in the Bible is the absolute
[19:15] amen even if the flesh be resisted amen
[19:18] you believe it in your soul thank you
[19:20] Lord yes
[19:22] yes amen hallelujah God keeps his word I
[19:25] mean if you believe that God I mean if
[19:27] you have experienced God keeping his
[19:29] word amen he'll do that amen hallelujah
[19:32] God will never go outside of his word
[19:33] for anything whatever amen God will not
[19:36] change his mind about his word amen he
[19:39] makes it amen he gives his word once and
[19:41] he never goes back to change it and God
[19:43] promises are the best
[19:45] the world gives us the worst but God
[19:48] promises are the best
[19:50] amen I wouldn't be happy with any other
[19:52] promise beside the promise of the word
[19:54] of God Amen the world may think amen we
[19:57] are living boring miserable lives amen
[19:59] so no no join it no fun amen because he
[20:02] quit fun to drinking smoking gambling
[20:05] maybe a little amen drugs
[20:07] a partying and dancing
[20:10] amen that's how they quit
[20:13] these things but we are living the most
[20:15] joyous life we are living the most
[20:17] prosperous life Amen in Jesus Christ in
[20:20] his word
[20:21] amen amen hallelujah now the prophet is
[20:25] going to give us an example here and
[20:26] he's telling us about this doctor that
[20:27] he knew
[20:30] Sam can I get some water amen
[20:33] he's telling us about this doctor that
[20:35] we knew that he knew and this doctor's
[20:38] brother-in-law
[20:39] add cancer in the throat
[20:43] and he tried to operate but he couldn't
[20:45] get to the cancer
[20:46] so this man came to the prophet and he
[20:49] had uh Faith to believe
[20:52] right watch the way I'm saying it now
[20:55] because you must have faith to believe
[20:57] amen even with the Divine gift yes yes
[21:01] it takes the faith of the person
[21:03] the Divine gift is there to raise your
[21:05] faith up to that level that if God can
[21:07] know and discern a thing about me surely
[21:09] his word is true
[21:11] amen hallelujah because heavens and
[21:14] earth will pass away but my word will
[21:16] never pass away amen the reason that we
[21:19] said this on Sunday the Reason God sent
[21:21] a Divine gift and the son of man
[21:22] Ministry coming to return now to the
[21:25] people people do not believe the Bible
[21:27] yes go there to get the attention again
[21:30] thank you brother Sam God had to get the
[21:32] attention again
[21:33] amen the message of the hour came to get
[21:36] us back to the word
[21:40] seven Church ages that come amen and
[21:43] they are teaching had gone away from the
[21:44] word of God but your karma David in the
[21:46] hour
[21:47] in the midst of Goliath amen he came
[21:50] amongst all denominational Giants to
[21:52] stay with the word of God he came to
[21:54] tell them that Hebrews 13 8 is still in
[21:56] existence he came to tell them that Mark
[21:58] 16 is still in existence
[22:01] but they didn't want to believe it
[22:04] amen so God gave him a gift and he said
[22:07] if you get the people to believe you
[22:09] yeah not even cancer will stand in your
[22:11] way so this this man got healed and hear
[22:13] what the prophet is saying now
[22:16] you're speaking to this Doctrine you
[22:17] know doctors are scientists
[22:20] and they don't believe the things of God
[22:21] so this doctor is telling him
[22:24] I believe if it went out and touched a
[22:27] tree
[22:28] and he had faith in it
[22:32] if you have faith you would have been
[22:34] healed the doctor is telling the
[22:36] prophetess
[22:40] I believe if it went out and touched a
[22:43] tree and said he had faith in it
[22:45] so the prophet stops him and he says no
[22:47] it won't
[22:49] so what is he telling you don't listen
[22:52] to people's nonsense
[22:54] stop them in the tracks correct the
[22:56] error yes
[22:58] amen if somebody is telling you where I
[23:00] went to this one priest and he prayed
[23:02] for me and
[23:03] stop them
[23:05] salvation is only through Jesus Christ
[23:07] healing is only through Jesus Christ
[23:09] amen
[23:12] he says no their own work
[23:14] he's got to have grounds for free
[23:18] catching a tree
[23:20] that Superstition the prophet is saying
[23:22] touching a tree superstition
[23:25] amen you've got to have ground by faith
[23:27] and Faith cometh by that
[23:29] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[23:32] amen so
[23:34] you can't approach the word of God like
[23:36] a newspaper because you can't have
[23:38] confidence in the newspaper that's
[23:39] written by man that's written based on
[23:42] the opinion
[23:43] that's based on biased reporting so
[23:47] God's word is not biased
[23:50] amen hallelujah and God is no better
[23:53] than his word just like how you and I
[23:55] know better than our world Amen
[23:57] Hallelujah so whatever the Bible says
[23:59] it's settle forever
[24:01] now we've got to understand this one
[24:04] concept how do you know you are saved
[24:09] you came to the Lord you asked him
[24:11] forgiveness of your sins
[24:12] you confess with your mouth you believed
[24:14] in your heart
[24:15] and you believed you are saved
[24:18] or if you've got any evidence of it
[24:21] so you're telling me you're saved by
[24:23] faith you believe you believe you're
[24:24] saved by faith
[24:27] grace through faith right
[24:29] but you get what I'm saying you believe
[24:31] the Lord's word
[24:33] you believed Jesus Christ when he said
[24:36] no man can come to the father except
[24:38] through me you believe Jesus when he
[24:40] said I am the way the truth and the life
[24:42] you took the words of Jesus and you have
[24:44] faith in the words of Jesus and you
[24:45] believed it
[24:47] the same way it comes to Healing
[24:50] you believe the scripture the same way
[24:53] because I'm sure there's not one of us
[24:54] sitting here today that doubts our
[24:56] Salvation the same way healing is a
[24:58] finished work don't doubt it believe it
[25:02] right you've got to come right back to
[25:04] know the word is the truth so whatever
[25:06] we established so far
[25:08] make the word of God our foundation it's
[25:10] the absolute it will never fail
[25:14] so we know Hebrews 4 tells us the word
[25:16] of God is powerful the word of God is
[25:18] sharp then any two-edges sword cutting
[25:22] amen even to the marrow of the bone and
[25:24] it is the designer of the thoughts and
[25:25] sees the intent of the heart now the
[25:27] Holy Ghost in you can bring any word of
[25:30] God to pass
[25:33] you hear what I said yes it takes the
[25:35] Holy Ghost in you to make the word
[25:37] manifest
[25:42] amen
[25:44] so we are living right now and we are
[25:46] believing and expecting God to fulfill
[25:48] all that he has promised in his work for
[25:50] this end time
[25:52] he has an end time being people
[25:54] believing his word to meet the entire
[25:56] conditions
[25:58] Amen in that condition that's virtuous
[26:02] so he's got to have a people so built up
[26:04] to withstand this end time conditions
[26:06] amen
[26:08] amen and a real expectation in our heart
[26:12] right now is built on thus saith the
[26:14] Lord
[26:15] we believe that we have that said the
[26:17] Lord just like our Noah had thus saith
[26:20] the Lord
[26:21] and he told them it's going to rain they
[26:23] laughed at him
[26:24] they mocked him
[26:27] and now I have to stand in the midst of
[26:29] a time when it never rained before
[26:31] and he had to preach rain amen
[26:34] yes you think it was easy for Noah
[26:38] amen but he believed God's word so much
[26:42] and it wasn't even the written word
[26:44] [Music]
[26:47] amen we have the written word to read it
[26:50] day and night and understand it and
[26:51] believe it and you know go over it he
[26:53] heard God's word once
[26:56] God give to give him the blueprints and
[26:58] he had to go about making it while he's
[27:00] busy preparing and making it watch the
[27:02] type now with us while we are making
[27:04] preparations the scoffers are coming
[27:06] scoffers are coming amen scoffers they
[27:09] couldn't stand in the day of the prophet
[27:12] and and would stand him amen
[27:15] with the pillar of fire in 1950 they
[27:19] couldn't withstand him when he told him
[27:21] about the seven angels in the cloud
[27:24] and the prophet whipped those 300
[27:26] denominational breaches
[27:28] and now their children are mad about it
[27:31] yeah
[27:33] now that he's dead and gone
[27:35] well he's in the sixth dimension now the
[27:38] children are saying hey look how we eat
[27:39] our fathers
[27:42] let's raise up
[27:45] let's question this thing
[27:48] why don't they question it then yes
[27:51] when the witness was there yeah
[27:54] when you could have answered the
[27:55] question
[27:56] but you see Satan let it lay
[27:59] he said I'll bring doubt in the end time
[28:00] did God say
[28:03] did the prophet say this
[28:07] nice don't reason with the Enemy amen
[28:10] when they come ask you a question hey
[28:11] I've got no time for you please that's
[28:13] right amen
[28:14] I don't want to reason about this Cloud
[28:17] I don't want a reason about the pillar
[28:19] of fire yes please go your way yes yes
[28:24] don't even entertain it
[28:28] amen so just like how Noah had to build
[28:32] in a time where of grapes or scoffers we
[28:35] are building now
[28:37] we are building this Great Pyramid City
[28:39] seven steps to the king's chamber amen
[28:42] seven steps of perfection yes amen so we
[28:45] are building in this great time amen and
[28:47] we must build
[28:48] with a sword in our hand and build
[28:52] you remember they were building the
[28:53] walls of Jerusalem again they had a
[28:55] sword in their hand and they were
[28:56] building with the other hand
[28:58] amen
[29:00] so you know what the prophet is saying
[29:02] you know
[29:06] he says this is 31 years
[29:09] okay
[29:11] just wait for this power
[29:16] maybe you're asking the Lord for
[29:18] something
[29:21] and you're not getting an answer that
[29:22] you want
[29:25] amen
[29:27] maybe you're trusting the Lord for
[29:28] something
[29:29] and you are not getting the answer
[29:32] for what you want God won't leave you
[29:35] wondering
[29:37] amen that's what the prophet is going to
[29:39] bring to us now
[29:46] just tell me if this thing is showing
[29:47] for you
[29:49] okay you got it on the screen as well so
[29:53] he says this is 31 years in the ministry
[29:55] for me
[29:57] and I know what I speak of
[29:59] and I've never sincerely in all my life
[30:01] ever asked God anything with this Bible
[30:04] open unless he gave it to me or he told
[30:07] me why he couldn't do it
[30:12] because there's sometimes he can't give
[30:14] it to me because I think I want it and
[30:17] he knows better but he's always come and
[30:20] told me why amen
[30:23] amen now what does that tell us he
[30:25] waited for an answer
[30:27] whether it came or not
[30:29] but how many of us are waiting for you
[30:31] know most of us are using God like a
[30:32] lucky charm
[30:34] we don't really want to commit to him we
[30:36] just want to use him for the blessings
[30:38] then we know better than denominations
[30:40] are you hearing me
[30:46] we have access to the promises of God
[30:48] because we believe the word we can't
[30:50] only come to God and only focus on bless
[30:53] me Lord bless me Lord bless me Lord you
[30:55] know what you're asking him you're
[30:57] actually asking in disbelief
[31:03] you are asking God to do something
[31:06] that you already got
[31:08] don't ever pray bless me Lord bless me
[31:10] Lord bless me Lord he's already blessed
[31:12] you yes amen yes amen you know where we
[31:14] are in Ephesians
[31:17] how many of you know that that's right
[31:18] but the Joshua quoted in his prayer
[31:21] Ephesians we are blessed with all
[31:23] spiritual blessings
[31:24] but you see if you don't believe that's
[31:26] another promise in the Bible amen so you
[31:28] keep going the Lord bless me Lord bless
[31:30] me Lord bless me Lord
[31:32] you're already blessed
[31:34] with all spiritual blessings
[31:37] in Heavenly places
[31:39] but did you where are you blessed in
[31:43] heavenly
[31:45] but maybe you're not there in Heavenly
[31:47] places that's why you keep asking him
[31:48] I'm not talking about all of you now the
[31:50] person that's always asking for blessing
[31:52] ask yourself maybe I'm not in a Heavenly
[31:55] place that's why I can't attain these
[31:57] blessings
[32:00] so what the key is
[32:01] Lord take me to Heavenly places
[32:04] come on now take me to Heavenly places
[32:07] so I can access all of these blessings
[32:08] amen
[32:10] don't really want to approach God and
[32:12] say oh no I just want this Lord
[32:15] I don't want that
[32:18] no
[32:19] amen so teaching us here now that the
[32:22] prophet waiting for an answer
[32:25] so he was determined
[32:27] he was dedicated amen so to me to come
[32:30] just come here now and use God as a
[32:32] lucky charm and just think hey I'm going
[32:34] to say this one thing here and God's
[32:35] gonna answer my prayer no are you
[32:37] waiting on the Lord
[32:39] amen amen the spirit just opened that
[32:41] very clearly to you now amen get into
[32:43] Heavenly places first amen
[32:46] so we know that Noah had to wait
[32:50] where to build in the time of great
[32:52] scoffing right
[32:56] when it was there was no rain
[32:58] and then we we went
[33:03] we went into our Abraham
[33:06] lift his own Hometown and I just want to
[33:09] get to this quickly because the prophet
[33:10] tells you beautifully how
[33:13] just to just to maybe build your faith a
[33:15] bit he says Abraham was 75 years old his
[33:18] wife was 65 years old and Abraham
[33:22] you're going to have a baby by your wife
[33:24] Sarah
[33:26] well he went out and got all the
[33:29] arrangements made
[33:30] what we were talking about how are you
[33:32] preparing
[33:34] for the promise
[33:36] how are you preparing for whatever
[33:38] promise you are waiting for
[33:40] the spiritual promise we are waiting for
[33:42] is the
[33:44] body change the Rapture yes right that's
[33:47] the spiritual promise but maybe you've
[33:48] got other promises in the word of God
[33:50] maybe it's healing maybe it's salvation
[33:52] maybe it's the Holy Ghost how are you
[33:54] preparing for that promise Whatever
[33:55] You're Expecting
[33:59] he went out and got all the arrangements

[36:19] he says put them in your hope chest and
[36:21] get ready because it's coming
[36:26] you see if you really believe what
[36:27] you're talking about you go testifying
[36:30] about it
[36:32] you want you won't care if you sound
[36:34] like a madman
[36:36] even if you don't have it
[36:39] like the next time somebody asks you and
[36:41] you believe in I know I'm bringing it
[36:43] down to something very final now right
[36:44] but please I'm just trying to bring it
[36:46] for a point
[36:47] if you are believing in your dream in
[36:49] your imagination that you are driving
[36:52] a BMW
[36:54] whatever M4 and whatever
[36:59] and somebody asks you what car are you
[37:00] driving
[37:02] if you really believe it
[37:05] even though you don't have it
[37:07] you will tell them what car you're
[37:08] driving
[37:10] you see
[37:12] I've got one amen
[37:14] for the Caleb you know I try to buy it
[37:19] what am I saying your confession will
[37:21] become
[37:22] an expression of your faith
[37:25] you go around telling everybody
[37:28] you go around telling everybody whether
[37:31] it brings you a bad reputation or not
[37:33] because it's faith
[37:36] you remember John Ryan
[37:37] the blind man
[37:39] was he could he was he still blind when
[37:41] he was testifying he went and told
[37:43] everyone praise God I'm Healed praise
[37:45] God I'm Healed praise God I'm Healed
[37:49] amen
[37:54] he says put them in your hope chest and
[37:57] get ready cause it's coming
[37:59] a year passed oh my God
[38:02] any difference here not a bit
[38:06] we're going to have it anyhow I'm
[38:08] expecting it
[38:11] amen
[38:12] God said separate yourself from your
[38:14] Kindle that's what you have to do a lot
[38:16] of times amen amen so start to look now
[38:18] why why why isn't the promise coming get
[38:21] rid of the unbelief get rid of all the
[38:23] the Netflix get rid of all the movies
[38:25] get rid of all the junk
[38:29] and get into the word of God get into
[38:31] the promises of God
[38:34] because I tell you if you're really
[38:35] desperate for God if you're really
[38:37] desperate for you to come to pass you
[38:39] will sacrifice everything for it
[38:43] that's what you've got to do separate
[38:44] yourself from a lot of unbelief
[38:47] amen
[38:49] and remember until Abraham fully obeyed
[38:51] God the blessing never come until he
[38:53] fully obeyed God he took daddy along he
[38:55] caused trouble he took luck finally
[38:57] caused trouble
[39:00] and then as soon as he got separated
[39:02] from everything he fully obeyed and when
[39:06] he come to full obedience then God
[39:08] brought the blessing
[39:13] so
[39:15] are we walking in full obedience
[39:17] amen are we walking in full obedience in
[39:19] this hour that's what God is expecting
[39:21] from us right just to reiterate this
[39:24] point now about our our attitude should
[39:26] be now this I want you to take it far
[39:29] above just healing now anything in life
[39:32] this should be our approach this is what
[39:34] I'm saying already confess it why don't
[39:36] you come on your own faith now being
[39:38] that God has proved that he's coming
[39:39] that is here come on your own faith and
[39:41] go out of the building rejoicing saying
[39:43] thank God I'm healed amen that's what he
[39:47] said
[39:49] yes amen amen yes
[39:56] so whatever it is in life
[39:58] whatever is in that hope
[40:00] whatever's in your thought desire
[40:04] that's what he said too already
[40:06] confessing
[40:08] Romans 10. amen confess with your mouth
[40:12] believe in your heart
[40:14] you know what the problem was in Mark 11
[40:16] there what did Jesus say man had come to
[40:19] a point where he doesn't even believe
[40:21] his own word that's why he's powerless
[40:23] on the Earth but Jesus told him if you
[40:26] believe
[40:27] what you have said
[40:29] people speak and they don't believe what
[40:31] they say yes
[40:34] Jesus Is Telling if you believe what you
[40:36] say yes
[40:39] you shall have what you have asked
[40:43] amen
[40:46] I want to take you now to another
[40:48] another example
[40:50] now we all know John Ryan right
[40:53] but here's another man
[40:57] and this man had come through the prayer
[41:00] line
[41:04] and the Lord told him
[41:07] that uh
[41:09] I'll just read a bit of it
[41:12] maybe you'll you'll get a what I'm
[41:14] trying to say maybe you won't go through
[41:15] a whole lot of it amen but I believe
[41:18] amen it'll help some more of us
[41:20] amen what's the thing needed in this
[41:22] hour faith
[41:24] but I'm asking how are you preparing for
[41:27] the promise
[41:28] how are you preparing I'm trying to show
[41:31] you how you hold to the promise how you
[41:33] make preparations for the promise
[41:35] so he says little fellow pass by and
[41:37] said God bless God bless you brother you
[41:38] believe
[41:40] a home now let your faith make you whole
[41:43] passed on by like that wow
[41:47] no prayer
[41:53] amen some of us if we didn't get prayed
[41:55] for we'd be very discouraged

[45:54] Healed and went on you know and kept
[45:56] saying praise the Lord he was healed
[45:58] about six weeks to be safe
[46:02] so he he went back home now and he
[46:04] started to tell everybody he started to
[46:07] testify in the town that he's healed of
[46:09] this jerking condition
[46:12] and the prophet was in another meeting
[46:16] and he received a phone call from this
[46:18] boy's mother
[46:20] with his man's mother and she started to
[46:22] tell him about how this man was
[46:25] testifying and causing a racket in the
[46:27] city and telling all the friends and
[46:29] neighbors and everybody that he was
[46:31] healed and everybody was laughing at him
[46:36] he came here a few weeks ago saying some
[46:38] Divine healer and healed him he's been
[46:40] going around your hollering praise the
[46:41] Lord he's healed and everything else
[46:42] like that he's got the whole
[46:44] neighborhood talk well there's no
[46:46] difference in to the boy amen
[46:49] said now we Christian people
[46:54] she's beginning to tell the boy now we
[46:56] are Christian people as well then he
[46:58] tells the mother he says mother I saw
[47:00] blind people see I saw deaf people here
[47:03] I seen cripples walk away and pass
[47:05] through the line and he told me to
[47:07] believe that I was healed he said the
[47:09] angel told him that and what the angel
[47:11] told him on the other things he's right
[47:14] and I'm Healed and nobody is going to
[47:16] make me say different I'm gonna stand
[47:18] right with it
[47:20] even
[47:21] and said he did that for several weeks
[47:25] and he said he would come down and set
[47:27] in a chair and say well thank God for
[47:28] healing me just shaking his heart as he
[47:30] could
[47:35] and said the people why he got an
[47:36] approach the neighbors would laugh at
[47:38] him they'd all go saying well I guess
[47:40] he's healed there he goes look at him
[47:42] shaking now isn't that a shame that
[47:44] somebody has deceived somebody like that
[47:45] isn't that ashamed the neighbors would
[47:47] say
[47:48] well that's why I want to be arrested
[47:50] ought to be run out of the country for
[47:52] telling the boy that
[47:55] he says my and the lady starts to say my
[47:57] relative from the country what's the
[47:59] matter with him he got down there and

[48:03] him he was healed he's been carrying on
[48:04] like that ever since
[48:07] saying he was healed
[48:09] laughing at him you know and then the
[48:11] mother got to laughing at him
[48:13] just to make him stop them
[48:17] even his own mother laughed at him
[48:19] thinking he listened to the mother
[48:23] said he's bringing your approach he'll
[48:24] never it'll never bring a reproach on
[48:27] testifying for what Christ died on
[48:29] Calvary
[48:30] no sir he healed every person when he
[48:33] died on Calgary you have to accept it

[48:39] on the chair he was shaking like that he
[48:41] kept on shaking he said he got to crying
[48:43] and he said we got to laughing at him
[48:46] and he said all of a sudden he jumped up
[48:48] to his feet just as still as he could be
[48:52] said now I'm Healed

[51:27] are we looking for the next Netflix
[51:29] movie
[51:30] are we looking amen for the next soccer
[51:33] game for the next Premier League match
[51:35] what are we looking for
[51:37] the Bible says
[51:39] where your treasure is
[51:44] that's where your heart is
[51:48] so the thing you spend the most amount
[51:50] of time that's where your treasure is
[51:52] yes you don't have to tell me a single
[51:54] thing you don't have to tell your wife a
[51:56] single thing you don't have to tell your
[51:58] children a thing they see it
[52:01] wow look at my father how enthused
[52:05] he gets so excited
[52:07] when he's involved in this thing
[52:17] [Music]
[52:22] Holy Night other times his emotions are
[52:25] all over the place
[52:32] where your treasure is that's where your
[52:34] heart is yes Lord
[52:37] now you see some of us get really
[52:39] excited in church
[52:40] then you know where our treasure is
[52:43] amen hallelujah

[52:46] starchy if you've been cold and formal
[52:48] that can change right now yes amen
[52:51] and God's not going to change you
[52:54] Force you and change you who's gonna ask
[52:56] for the change
[52:59] because the Holy Ghost is a
[53:01] gentleman is waiting for you to ask him
[53:05] yes that's right you know I was going to
[53:07] read the sport and maybe we'll read it
[53:08] some other time
[53:10] I don't have it here that's why I won't
[53:11] read it now is the prophet of God is
[53:14] telling you that he was sitting in the
[53:16] church and he saw this young lady and
[53:18] she's began to dance she got it from the
[53:19] piano and she began to dance
[53:21] and she was dancing and praising the
[53:23] Lord dancing and praising the Lord and
[53:26] he says I got a little critical
[53:28] about her
[53:31] he says that he went back to his church
[53:33] and he says you know what the spirit of
[53:35] God began to move there
[53:37] and he says before you know when he
[53:38] started to tap his foot and I remember
[53:40] he was a really good Baptist
[53:42] so he was coming amongst the
[53:43] Pentecostals
[53:45] amen where the spirit of God was moving
[53:47] amen hallelujah praise the Lord and You
[53:51] Feel The Beat come on now yeah
[53:54] amen and he says come to find out I
[53:57] found out why dancing is so important
[54:00] he says because dancing proclaims the
[54:02] victory that you are victorious and a
[54:05] victory is that you have already
[54:06] obtained it amen so you ought to dance
[54:08] and praise the Lord and thank him and
[54:11] give him praise with a victory amen amen
[54:14] hallelujah some of us have never
[54:16] worshiped in church some of us have
[54:19] never raised our hands in church some of
[54:21] us have never said a good praise the
[54:22] Lord some of us have never said amen
[54:25] amen
[54:27] thank you Jesus but that's going to
[54:30] change
[54:30] and the only person can change it is
[54:34] amen turn to your neighbor and say I'm
[54:36] going to change
[54:38] see now and tell them now I'm going to
[54:40] talk a bit more louder than that when
[54:42] I'm praising God
[54:44] [Music]
[54:45] the Bible says
[54:50] Triumph
[54:51] don't be ashamed be boastful we just
[54:55] read about a young man here amen
[54:59] you think fear could have got him
[55:00] anywhere
[55:02] I mean think of the embarrassment the
[55:04] shame that he must have been facing in
[55:06] that approach being laughter and you
[55:08] know when when normally you got a
[55:10] problem and you're shaking like that
[55:12] people are always looking at you
[55:17] and they treat you inferior
[55:20] so he had to withstand all of that I'm
[55:23] asking you young man younger what
[55:25] complexes are you facing

[55:47] it's not normal
[55:51] amen

[56:09] you know what I mean
[56:11] then why don't I see you talking to the
[56:13] next brother
[56:16] that's a complex that needs to be
[56:18] eliminated
[56:20] there's nobody in the church that should
[56:22] be without a voice amen that should be
[56:24] without the Praises of God Amen all our
[56:28] communication all our speech amen should
[56:30] be

[1:00:40] you can't live without faith
[1:00:42] if you're living without faith you are
[1:00:44] living a defeated life

[1:00:50] those unseen things into the real world
[1:00:52] Faith looks Faith believes Faith holds
[1:00:55] faded muscles faith has hair on its
