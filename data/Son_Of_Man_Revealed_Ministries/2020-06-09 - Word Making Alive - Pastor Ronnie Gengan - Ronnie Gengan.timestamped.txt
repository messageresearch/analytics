[24:36] hearing and yelling of the word
[24:39] let's forget all about what happens at

[25:10] recovery lord
[25:11] yes blessings bless your will to our
[25:14] hearts now
[25:15] even as we have gathered here may our
[25:18] offer
[25:19] quick means to make a lie amen quick
[25:23] means
[25:24] to make a lie amen the word of god makes
[25:27] a lie
[25:29] and it's powerful how many of you know
[25:32] what powerful means
[25:33] yes powerful
[25:38] how many of you know what powerful means
[25:42] full of power
[25:45] the word of god is quick and powerful
[25:47] amen
[25:48] the word of god makes alive amen people
[25:52] can be
[25:53] gloomy and down and all but let the true
[25:56] word of god strike them
[25:58] place them alive amen so to make a line
[26:03] see sharper than the two-edged sword
[26:09] i don't know how many of you see the
[26:10] sword and i believe it's very sharp
[26:14] amen the brother described the sword
[26:18] when he fell into his hands amen he goes
[26:22] glistening
[26:23] man and he was scared of holding swords
[26:26] because
[26:26] they're very sharp that's right so the
[26:29] word of god
[26:30] is sharper than the sword amen amen
[26:33] so what the sword does in the i know in
[26:36] the old
[26:37] days they used to do the swords fight
[26:40] with the sword
[26:43] and if that can cut the guy's head off
[26:46] [Music]
[26:49] it was sharp
[26:55] [Music]
[26:59] because david never had a sword
[27:04] he killed him with a slingshot but he
[27:07] cut off his head with the saw
[27:08] amen and they say goliath was a big guy
[27:12] and you know 10 feet tall
[27:16] now with david the bible says he was
[27:19] running
[27:21] for him to take that sword and really
[27:23] swing it and cut his head
[27:25] that took the power of god amen he had
[27:28] to cut his head off
[27:30] so the word of god is quick powerful
[27:33] sharper
[27:34] than any two-edged sword amen
[27:37] it cuts asunder see
[27:40] the true word of god cuts the people
[27:42] amen
[27:43] amen you see where people are true that
[27:46] if god is speaking to them
[27:48] they get upset because the world cuts
[27:49] them
[27:51] when you tell them the truth when they
[27:52] get angry
[27:54] what is cutting them
[27:58] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[28:00] soul
[28:01] and spirit see the word can divide and
[28:05] cut
[28:06] between the soul and the spirit amen
[28:10] praise the lord and of the joints and
[28:14] narrow
[28:25] the word of god can cut right there amen
[28:28] amen right in the middle
[28:30] [Music]
[28:32] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[28:35] intents of the heart
[28:36] amen amen the word of god is a designer
[28:41] amen amen of our hearts
[28:44] the intent of our hearts which is the
[28:48] actions of our hearts
[28:50] the word of god knows the actions of our
[28:53] hearts
[28:55] praise the lord i'll be glad for that
[28:56] amen
[28:59] neither is there any creature that is
[29:02] not manifested in sight
[29:05] he knows all things amen he knows about
[29:08] every creature
[29:11] but all things but all things are making
[29:15] and open until the eyes of him
[29:18] with whom we have to do amen praise the
[29:21] lord so
[29:22] he knows all things the word of god is
[29:24] powerful
[29:25] and uh you can kind of sunder you know
[29:28] any part of your body can know the
[29:31] thoughts of our hearts
[29:33] and we've seen that in our day amen amen
[29:37] so it's a word of god knowing the
[29:40] secrets of the hearts yes
[29:41] amen the son of man was here
[29:44] amen the word making known the infants
[29:48] of the heart
[29:51] those people that were blinded and
[29:53] confused
[29:54] they said it's a man they said it's a
[29:58] mind reading mental telepathy
[30:01] but the word of god is powerful amen
[30:05] quicker than any two of the songs i was
[30:08] going to mention this but i forgot about
[30:09] this brony to my memory now we're going
[30:11] to give the young people some

[31:15] and take it right down to the old
[31:16] testament amen
[31:18] and you can see that paradox is
[31:20] continued from there right to this day
[31:23] you know like elijah the man borrowed a
[31:25] hex
[31:27] and the hex fell into the water amen
[31:31] yes and he didn't know what to do borrow
[31:34] it

[31:45] elijah came to know about it he took a
[31:49] sticker through it in the water there
[31:51] and that hex that came swimming up
[31:56] amen amen
[31:59] against the force of gravity but god has
[32:02] done the same thing today
[32:04] many things yes right so what you're

[32:39] amen right so he knows the actions of
[32:41] the heart
[32:43] god knows the actions of our hearts amen
[32:46] right about and it says here
[32:50] as a man thinking it is so easy amen
[32:54] as a man thinks so easy
[32:58] what our thoughts are all the time

[46:43] do with it
[46:45] amen we know we are safe
[46:49] we are here in our human elements also
[46:52] i mean the problem said we can't get on
[46:54] with our own selves
[46:56] if you can't get on with your own
[46:58] subject we get on with somebody else
[47:00] that's right so that must be the real
[47:02] grace of god
[47:03] amen so we thank god for that saint john
[47:07] chapter 6
[47:08] reading for verse 63 what
[47:18] you will read from 62 and what
[47:21] what and if you shall see the son of man
[47:25] ascend up where he was before
[47:30] yeah he's standing right on the earth
[47:32] and talking now
[47:34] what and if you shall see the son of man
[47:38] ascend means growing up
[47:42] where he was before
[47:46] so before he came here he was there
[47:50] it is the spirit that quickeneth amen
[47:53] see the word of god is quick and
[47:56] powerful amen
[47:57] it is a spirit that quickeneth amen
[48:02] the flesh prophet nothing the words that
[48:05] i speak unto you
[48:07] they are spirit and they are life amen
[48:10] the words that speak unto you the word
[48:14] is created
[48:15] amen so his word is spirit and life amen
[48:18] so where is the word of god today amen
[48:21] with the churches
[48:25] praise the lord the world is here with
[48:27] the bride today amen
[48:30] amen and and god has given her the word
[48:35] and he will know what she must do with
[48:37] that word amen amen
[48:39] i'll be glad for that she knows what you
[48:42] must do with that word amen
[48:44] so the word of god his word is spirit
[48:46] and life amen
[48:48] see so jesus said now someplace he said
[48:52] in vain to men worship
[48:55] teaching for doctrine commandments of
[48:58] men
[48:59] in vain i think that is in the book of
[49:02] matthew
[49:04] that's in chapter 5 i think somewhere
[49:06] there
[49:11] so what we're feasting on today the body
[49:13] word of the son of man amen amen
[49:16] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[49:18] blood you've got no life in me
[49:21] that is where his word is yes praise the
[49:23] lord
[49:24] right so it is a spirit
[49:28] that quickeneth
[49:32] the spirit that quickeneth
[49:36] the flesh provided nothing
[49:42] the flesh prominent nothing
[49:45] the words that i speak unto you
[49:48] they are spirit and they are life
[49:52] so when you're taking god's word you
[49:55] have life
[49:56] yes amen you have life
[50:01] don't don't believe that coke had no
[50:04] coke gives life
[50:09] they lie amen coke don't give life
[50:14] and some people say it's talking death
[50:18] isn't it but the words i speak unto you
[50:22] they are spirit in their life
[50:24] but there are some of you that do not
[50:27] believe
[50:29] jesus knew from the beginning who they
[50:32] were that believe not
[50:34] yes see we read the scripture there he
[50:36] knows everything
[50:37] deserve our thoughts intents of our
[50:40] hearts
[50:42] he knew from the beginning who won't
[50:45] believe
[50:45] yes praise the lord so you've got no
[50:49] problem that's what i say we know who we
[50:50] are
[50:52] but he knows who won't believe and
[50:55] they'll be
[50:55] part in the churches that go to church
[50:58] and fellowship and everything else
[51:00] but he knows from the beginning who
[51:02] don't believe
[51:05] right so that's his right now become the
[51:08] spirit
[51:12] jesus knew from the beginning who they
[51:14] were that believe not
[51:15] and who should betray him amen
[51:19] he do it and he was calm cool and
[51:23] collected
[51:24] that's right when judas was there he
[51:27] never got
[51:28] excited he knew
[51:31] he knew judas had a work to do
[51:35] he was born for that purpose he was born
[51:37] the son of petition
[51:41] isn't it so he knew somebody had to
[51:44] deceive him
[51:45] as the scripture also said
[51:51] and he said therefore i said you
[51:55] no man can come unto me except
[51:58] it were given unto him of my father
[52:02] nobody can come to god unless god has
[52:05] called us
[52:06] amen that's why you can go and
[52:09] plead and beg get everything to some
[52:11] people they will never come
[52:15] but it was intended of god for
[52:28] now when you're fishing there you throw
[52:30] that net in
[52:32] catches all types of fish yes all type
[52:35] of sea life
[52:37] you pull that metal you only take the
[52:40] fish
[52:42] all the others throw it back so you
[52:44] throw the gospel net down there
[52:48] lots of catch can come but there are
[52:51] genuine fishes there
[52:53] every time god we are rainbow trout amen
[52:58] we're not just any fish
[53:01] you know that signal of a fish is a
[53:04] christian

[53:06] you see in the back of the car the
[53:08] signal of a fish they it means they are
[53:11] christian
[53:12] but we must put on our cars a rainbow
[53:15] trout
[53:18] we're special fish
[53:22] special fish costs a lot of money
[53:25] isn't it you really want some good fish
[53:28] you're gonna
[53:28] spend a lot of money 100 200 land
[53:32] and you can also get some jellyfish
[53:37] brother dennis will like jellyfish you

[53:52] amen nothing can be hidden from him amen
[53:56] and if that blood was predestined to
[53:59] come forth you'll come forth amen
[54:02] amen see we know the bible says there
[54:06] if it was possible the elect will be
[54:08] deceived because the spirits are there
[54:11] are so close they're deceiving the
[54:14] people with all that
[54:15] you know the gifts and all these wonders
[54:17] and and all this thing
[54:19] that's not the real gift the real gift
[54:23] is the word amen
[54:25] amen amen and they get to see by the
[54:27] directing some people get
[54:28] caught by the gift you know recently our
[54:31] basic people were running after a gift
[54:34] of some false prophet
[54:38] running after the gift
[54:41] see so the bible tells us that if it
[54:45] were possible
[54:47] but he said it's not possible amen amen
[54:49] for the elect to be deceived amen
[54:51] absolutely
[54:52] see we don't fall a hook line in sick
[54:54] see

[55:15] but today he's not elohim because he's
[55:18] got a family amen god is not living
[55:20] alone
[55:21] so there's no other hell of himself amen
[55:25] there's no false elohim amen
[55:28] because god is not anymore elohim
[55:32] he's not self-existing anymore amen he's
[55:35] got a many members
[55:38] see people are running after that false
[55:41] teaching
[55:43] of somebody claiming to be a hell of him
[55:48] and people are blinded and shouting and
[55:50] jumping and praising
[55:51] says elohim hello him elohim amen
[55:59] hello it is jesus christ now

[56:16] god
[56:18] cutting us up there making us alive
[56:21] bringing the word to our remembrance

[1:01:22] see a christian can't die now he knows
[1:01:25] where he's going
[1:01:27] lord jesus received my spirit
[1:01:32] and he kneeled down and cried with a
[1:01:35] loud voice
[1:01:37] lord lay not the sin to the church
[1:01:43] and when he had said this he fell asleep
[1:01:48] he knew where he was going amen
[1:01:51] he fell asleep
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:56] and you comfort on that resurrection
[1:01:57] morning amen
[1:01:59] he'll be quickened made a lie
[1:02:03] praise the lord
[1:02:07] amen the word of god cuts
[1:02:10] you know a lot of time you get
[1:02:14] people that are debating the word of god
[1:02:17] when they can't take what is being
[1:02:19] presented
[1:02:21] they can guest get into fights
[1:02:25] real fights can happen
[1:02:30] see the word of god make people fight
[1:02:34] yes one trying to prove i'm wrong the
[1:02:37] other one trying to prove i'm
[1:02:38] i'm uh sorry i'm right the other one
[1:02:40] proving i'm right
[1:02:43] they're getting the fights
[1:02:46] see so that's what the word of god does
[1:02:49] amen so what it says you know
[1:02:53] shall i speak so the people rejected the
[1:02:57] word they rejected the preaching
[1:03:02] now these men believe they were saying
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:07] because they rejected the source that
[1:03:09] was there in their day
[1:03:12] to receive salvation to
[1:03:15] they christ it
[1:03:19] and what have they done today that god
[1:03:22] sent the message to the elected bride
[1:03:26] rejected the word so god sent the
[1:03:30] message
[1:03:30] to the elected bride
[1:03:33] what he says there shocked us out of
[1:03:36] those denominations amen
[1:03:39] what is that the word of god amen
[1:03:43] us out of those denominations
[1:03:48] see to make the world of god non-effect
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:54] so that's why god had to send the
[1:03:55] message to make the
[1:03:57] word of god non-effect by saying
[1:04:01] the days of miracles is fars and only
[1:04:03] those men receive the holy ghost
[1:04:05] in the upper room nobody else can get
[1:04:08] the holy ghost nobody must
[1:04:12] pray and cast out devils
[1:04:16] since the conviction was not given
[1:04:20] but it's all day in the bible amen these
[1:04:23] sons shall follow them they believe
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:30] scholars led by the devil said no no no
[1:04:32] that's not in the original manuscript
[1:04:35] it was added later
[1:04:38] huh these sons shall follow them the
[1:04:42] glee
[1:04:43] amen amen
[1:04:49] so that the bride the bride
[1:04:52] to be word part of a sin
[1:04:55] cannot be received see the bride that is
[1:04:59] part of in the world cannot be deceived
[1:05:02] right so eve came under the inside of
[1:05:04] heaven
[1:05:05] and was deceived
[1:05:08] and adam was straightened he was first
[1:05:11] image of god
[1:05:13] then he was put in the flesh he was
[1:05:16] given dominion power authority
[1:05:19] amen he was the enemy to god
[1:05:24] and he came out of him but got deceived
[1:05:27] but this bride came back from christ's
[1:05:30] side
[1:05:31] amen amen cannot be received amen it's
[1:05:35] not possible for that to be deceived
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:39] see she came up from his side
[1:05:42] amen she's part of him
[1:05:45] cannot be deceived praise the lord now
[1:05:50] jesus will be the word
[1:05:51] he'll never be the word the word of god
[1:05:54] is freaking powerful
[1:05:55] sharper than any two edges so let's go
[1:05:57] to revelation 19.
[1:06:00] revelation 19.
[1:06:09] so you follow the scriptures here you
[1:06:12] know it is written
[1:06:13] young people you know it is written
[1:06:16] you know the pastor read the scripture
[1:06:18] there it's written
[1:06:19] amen amen see god knows all things
[1:06:24] you know something about god he knows
[1:06:27] all things
[1:06:28] amen amen he doesn't forgive
[1:06:31] there was a case where i rented some
[1:06:34] time back
[1:06:35] and uh there was a person that
[1:06:39] died and went to heaven and things like
[1:06:42] that and
[1:06:44] was uh was asked a question
[1:06:47] who is your god and he didn't know he
[1:06:50] says
[1:06:52] he wasn't saving god
[1:06:55] who is your god
[1:06:58] then sometime
[1:07:01] in his young boy days
[1:07:06] he remembered going to a sunday school
[1:07:09] just a sunday school
[1:07:13] and he heard something about jesus
[1:07:17] and the voice said again who is god
[1:07:20] and the voice said say jesus
[1:07:25] amen and then and then you remember
[1:07:28] in sunday school you hear about jesus
[1:07:31] so god knows you can look way back
[1:07:36] and he said somebody said jesus germans
[1:07:38] came to him
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:40] see so god knows everything amen
[1:07:44] many cases like that so when you read
[1:07:47] the word you know now
[1:07:48] you know what the word is so revelation
[1:07:50] 19 let's see now who he is now the word
[1:07:53] reading from verse 11 now this is when
[1:07:56] jesus is coming
[1:07:57] now we find we are living in the in the
[1:07:59] prophetic times
[1:08:00] the scriptures are being unfolded yet we
[1:08:03] find
[1:08:04] in the last week or two so many nations
[1:08:07] have become friends with israel
[1:08:10] yes signing agreements
[1:08:15] of working together and an
[1:08:18] economy and business and all this thing
[1:08:22] now we have the letters i was reading
[1:08:24] this morning serbia and crossover
[1:08:28] they're there in europe they were in one
[1:08:31] of those two countries
[1:08:32] but they have made a peace agreement
[1:08:34] with israel
[1:08:35] and they're moving their embassies to
[1:08:37] israel
[1:08:39] right and then we've got saudi arabia
[1:08:42] then we've got uh
[1:08:45] bahrain dubai there uae
[1:08:50] american there's 22 arab nations
[1:08:53] possible to make peace with israel now
[1:08:56] they are recognizing
[1:08:57] israel to be a nation and jesus said
[1:09:01] watch the fig tree
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:05] when you see the what's putting forth
[1:09:07] right from 1948
[1:09:10] right up to now
[1:09:13] now they say no we recognizing you as a
[1:09:15] nation
[1:09:17] and there's a few that iran and others
[1:09:19] that you know we won't recognize them
[1:09:21] and we're going to bomb them and
[1:09:23] everything else now in the making
[1:09:25] friends with all these other nations and
[1:09:27] they're going to be strengthened
[1:09:31] by military might
[1:09:34] and all those bases are going to build
[1:09:35] over there to withstand the enemy
[1:09:39] what's the number one is iran right
[1:09:42] so jesus said now look at all these
[1:09:44] things happening now we're living in
[1:09:46] those times

[1:09:51] with israel they're all enemies

[1:10:00] and contention is going to be amongst
[1:10:01] them that's palestinians and all
[1:10:04] so these things are not happening
[1:10:06] without the reason
[1:10:08] scriptures are being fulfilled see
[1:10:14] so sorry so this is happening
[1:10:18] after all the nations are going to come

[1:18:23] then revelation of the world amen praise
[1:18:26] the lord
[1:18:27] so that is where the real church is
[1:18:30] the rock the revelation of his word
[1:18:33] that's where she's built on it's not
[1:18:36] creeds and programs
[1:18:38] and do this and don't do that
[1:18:41] come on it's a man
[1:18:45] washing pots and washing hands no
[1:18:49] upon bulma church
[1:18:53] saying that god is called and revelated
[1:18:57] we are his church
[1:19:00] praise the lord
[1:19:06] one said well you're a great man you're
[1:19:08] like moses
[1:19:09] you're a great man you're like that
[1:19:12] ain't it
[1:19:13] but the revelation said that was the son
[1:19:15] of god
[1:19:18] he said flesh and blood never revealed
[1:19:20] it to you
[1:19:21] but my father which is in heaven upon
[1:19:23] this revealed truth
[1:19:26] amen so brian do not fear
[1:19:30] your faith is on the revealed words
[1:19:33] [Music]
[1:19:35] so we know who we are amen
[1:19:38] we're not doubting whether we're going
[1:19:40] to be saved
[1:19:42] if our faith is in the word of god and
[1:19:44] it's a real word of god
[1:19:45] and the scriptures have been made alive
[1:19:50] then it was advanced of god for us to
[1:19:52] believe it
[1:19:56] otherwise we can't believe it
[1:19:59] what is it 168 of shalom
[1:20:03] what is it he is the word
[1:20:07] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:20:09] word was god and the word was
[1:20:11] where was god and the word was god and
[1:20:14] the word is still
[1:20:16] god amen see what is that
[1:20:20] god the prophet is gone
[1:20:26] but we got the word of god
[1:20:31] men spoke led by the holy spirit
[1:20:38] and they had words so the words that men
[1:20:41] spoke became the word of god
[1:20:44] meant for the holy ghost
[1:20:47] when spied to speak that became the word
[1:20:50] of god
[1:20:51] amen now we've got to accept that by
[1:20:53] faith and believe it
[1:20:55] because you got atheist theologians
[1:20:59] doubters they say listen yeah we don't
[1:21:02] want to believe that
[1:21:04] new testament it's words by men
[1:21:09] you take these debates like
[1:21:12] you know he got this uh debaters
[1:21:14] debating about jesus and
[1:21:16] the bible and god creation and all here
[1:21:22] but the bible says holy men moved
[1:21:25] amen amen by the spirit of god we're
[1:21:28] inspired to write
[1:21:32] just like in our day god said to the
[1:21:34] prophet take up your pen and write
[1:21:38] that became the word of god amen
[1:21:42] so that's what peter said the word of
[1:21:44] god is of no private interpretation
[1:21:47] amen private interpretation
[1:21:51] if the word of god said it believe it
[1:21:53] amen
[1:21:55] amen can't make it any other way
[1:21:59] so you spill the word the same yesterday
[1:22:04] same today manifest as he was
[1:22:08] moses and elijah on down and jesus the
[1:22:11] same
[1:22:12] god today makes him jesus
[1:22:15] save yesterday today forever see
[1:22:18] he will stand in line they never pointed
[1:22:21] you to a group
[1:22:22] they pointed you to a person amen
[1:22:26] pointed you to a word god
[1:22:30] praise the lord where the word pointed
[1:22:33] us to him
[1:22:36] not pointing to somebody calling himself
[1:22:38] elohim
[1:22:40] the word of god is pointing us to
[1:22:42] himself he is the word
[1:22:45] absolutely amen so he says
[1:22:49] what do i begin to do brother brandon
[1:22:53] at the cross begin at the cross with him
[1:22:56] repent
[1:22:57] believe the word that's what the bible
[1:22:59] says
[1:23:00] that follow through the rhythm of the
[1:23:02] risk of the world
[1:23:05] see another said now get yourself some
[1:23:07] bible scholars and teachers and all
[1:23:09] they must teach you follow him
[1:23:13] with the rest of the rhythm of the world
[1:23:16] praise the lord you say well what shall
[1:23:18] i do
[1:23:20] just keep on following the rhythm
[1:23:24] of the world amen
[1:23:27] if repair is the first thing
[1:23:30] in recognizing to do that
[1:23:33] that's your first step put your next
[1:23:37] step
[1:23:37] where the work says on and on
[1:23:41] and marching on within keep marching
[1:23:44] with the word
[1:23:46] see if this is the time that we don't

[1:34:07] has made a way for us
[1:34:09] he brought us to all his growing pains
[1:34:12] since he said
[1:34:13] uh further down they says we must be
[1:34:17] a part of the world not a part of the
[1:34:20] creed
[1:34:21] part of the world not a part of a church
[1:34:24] a part of the bride
[1:34:27] god church is condemned we know that she

[1:34:31] into other darkness but the bride goes
[1:34:34] up

[1:34:41] the word of god is quick and powerful
[1:34:43] sharper than maybe two edges
[1:34:45] and that is what we got that's why when
[1:34:48] the prophet was confused now
[1:34:50] what's going to happen he had that great
[1:34:51] blast over there and he said now
[1:34:54] my uh god is going to take me away
[1:34:57] is it for me to go because he said
[1:35:01] nobody can stand the blood the blast
[1:35:06] then he wondered now what is this
[1:35:09] he told his wife he said you know what
[1:35:11] you think i don't think so
[1:35:14] then he said no i seen little joseph
[1:35:16] there
[1:35:18] so he knows now you can't go because
[1:35:21] joseph was there
[1:35:22] amen the nearly one morning holy spirit
[1:35:24] said
[1:35:26] go up the mountain day we went to cebino
[1:35:30] canyon
[1:35:31] and when he went there all those rocks
[1:35:34] around there and between
[1:35:36] there's a v-shaped place there the sun
[1:35:39] was glistening to that one place
[1:35:42] and the holy spirit go there
[1:35:45] you want to know what this is all about
[1:35:47] and while he was standing prey
[1:35:48] a sword fell in his hand
[1:35:52] with the hand and a twisting curl
[1:35:57] and he said he's real
[1:36:00] so he says where'd this thing come from
[1:36:05] in the mountains nobody around
[1:36:10] and he says now what is this am i going
[1:36:13] to be knighted
[1:36:15] you know i'm honored as a great man
[1:36:19] because i believe they use that time one
[1:36:21] day the making
[1:36:22] they call it the night calendar ghd
[1:36:26] then the voice and spoken said no this
[1:36:28] is the king's sword
[1:36:32] not aching so the king's
[1:36:36] sword
[1:36:39] brother this is the word of god

[1:36:49] that's right
[1:36:51] what is it the word the opening of the
[1:36:54] word
[1:36:56] the sharp two-edged sword and the
[1:36:59] prophet said
[1:37:00] it takes a strong arm of faith to handle
[1:37:03] this word
[1:37:06] to cut preach the word be instant
[1:37:10] in season other season rebuke
[1:37:14] exalt some people like one sissified
[1:37:18] preacher
[1:37:20] must have cut and rebuke the bible
[1:37:23] scuttle rebuke
[1:37:25] pull some out of the fire
[1:37:28] the word of god is quick and powerful
[1:37:33] that's why you find all these guys 65
[1:37:35] joel or steve
[1:37:36] do you find him cutting that saw a word
[1:37:38] in the sword
[1:37:40] you're very preaching that word like a
[1:37:42] cutting sword

[1:37:48] are you going to be uh you know rich
[1:37:53] god is going to bless your business
[1:37:57] no cutting sword
[1:38:00] when you look in that audience there you
[1:38:02] can see the word me to be preached
[1:38:03] to the woman that running paint and
[1:38:06] lipstick
[1:38:07] and shots and slacks
[1:38:12] oh 65 bleachers
[1:38:23] you can't preach about sin the holy
[1:38:25] ghost keeps away sin
[1:38:28] so you're going to preach it don't say
[1:38:32] people in the bride don't sin
[1:38:36] the greatest sin is unbelief
[1:38:39] they do all the wrong because they don't
[1:38:40] believe the word
[1:38:43] and the bible says if the righteous is
[1:38:45] scarcely saved
[1:38:47] where will the ungodly and the sinner
[1:38:49] appear amen
[1:38:51] so the word of god must be preached it
[1:38:54] was cut
[1:38:56] but divine let's go to the meadow
[1:39:02] huh
[1:39:06] the holy ghost keeps the church clean
[1:39:10] amen see so that's why
[1:39:13] the word of god must preach sometimes to
[1:39:14] cut us
[1:39:16] to mold us to shape us
[1:39:21] nothing else can do that amen
[1:39:24] a program can't do that i'm gonna stop
[1:39:28] right now because it's gone two hours
[1:39:29] two hours
[1:39:31] i never preach for two hours but it's
[1:39:33] gone two hours
[1:39:36] praise a lot you love him amen he is our
[1:39:39] sin
[1:39:40] he is our refuge amen so what it is
[1:39:44] it's the world what is keeping allah
[1:39:47] al-assad the holy ghost and fire
[1:39:50] is keeping us alive praise the lord amen
[1:39:54] spend time with that word
[1:39:56] stay with the rhythm
[1:39:59] praise the lord amen it's standard not
[1:40:02] to focus anywhere else
[1:40:05] just observe what's happening and be
[1:40:07] faithful to the lord
[1:40:10] amen amen we're going to look at life
[1:40:14] that is what shakes the devil we can
[1:40:17] come and tell the devil all the
[1:40:18] mysteries
[1:40:19] we know but sometimes he can make us run
[1:40:25] because he'll say all right now and
[1:40:27] silence and over who are you
[1:40:29] amen amen amen
[1:40:33] see it's a it's a life love that shakes
[1:40:35] the devil
[1:40:39] see if we can know all the mysteries we
[1:40:41] can give our body to be burned and
[1:40:43] all this thing but we haven't got love
[1:40:47] we're like a tinkling brass and a symbol
[1:40:51] praise the lord so the word of god is
[1:40:53] quick and powerful and that word of god
[1:40:56] somewhere along the landscape quicken us
[1:40:58] cut us up
[1:41:00] when we're doing wrong that word cuts us
[1:41:02] up
[1:41:10] see the word of god recognized makes us
[1:41:13] recognize who we are
[1:41:16] like jesus now the word of god was

[1:41:44] quickening and one day
[1:41:47] the prophet the word of god so inspired
[1:41:50] him
[1:41:51] and said charles and ella are brandon
[1:41:56] they're not my parents
[1:42:13] the same with us
[1:42:16] don't go to your parents and tell them
[1:42:20] i'm not your son
[1:42:26] i'm a son of god but he said

[1:42:35] praise the lord he knew he had a
[1:42:37] heavenly father

[1:42:42] father is
[1:42:44] our parents were only instrumental bring
[1:42:45] us here
