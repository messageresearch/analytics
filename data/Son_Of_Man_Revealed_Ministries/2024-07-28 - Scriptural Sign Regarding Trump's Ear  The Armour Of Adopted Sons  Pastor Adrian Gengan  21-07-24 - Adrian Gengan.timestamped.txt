[1:09] overtake the Earth but God is calling us
[1:11] to come and counter these forces amen
[1:14] amen God didn't send Angels he's saying
[1:17] we wrestle not against amen not the
[1:19] Angelic world we wrestle not against
[1:21] flesh and blood but against
[1:23] principalities against Powers against
[1:25] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:28] against spiritual wickedness in I place
[1:30] places now we need an armor for this
[1:33] wherefore take unto you the old Armor of
[1:35] God that you may be able to withstand in
[1:38] the evil day having done all to stand
[1:41] amen stand therefore having your loins G
[1:45] about with truth and having on the
[1:47] breastplate breastplate of righteousness
[1:50] and your feet shod with the preparation
[1:52] of the gospel of peace above all taking
[1:57] the shield of Faith wherewith you shall
[1:59] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[2:02] the wicked amen amen and take the elmet
[2:05] of Salvation And The Sword of the spirit
[2:08] which is the word of God praying always
[2:12] with all prayer and supplication in the
[2:14] spirit and watching there unto with all
[2:17] perseverance and supplication for All
[2:20] Saints amen as for me that utterance may
[2:24] be given unto me that I may open my
[2:26] mouth boldly to make known The Mystery
[2:29] of the Gospel for which I am an
[2:31] ambassador in bonds that therein I may
[2:33] speak boldly as I ought to speak amen
[2:36] the Lord had blessings to the reading of
[2:37] his word you may be seated so we come
[2:40] with the authority of what the Lord has
[2:43] placed in our hearts and we take control
[2:45] of atmospheres amen we take control of
[2:47] principalities and Powers amen amen and
[2:50] when we speak words these are not idle
[2:51] words that we are speaking we are taking
[2:53] control of territories even now as we
[2:55] speak hallelujah amen I don't if you
[2:58] know the Lord
[3:00] is the spirit of Truth he said he'll
[3:03] give us the spirit of Truth amen and
[3:05] when that Spirit of truth comes he'll
[3:07] take away all doubt he'll take away all
[3:08] reasoning and he'll make his word very
[3:11] clear to us amen while it's coming fresh
[3:14] how many of you like fresh food oh yes
[3:15] amen amen you got to like fresh food
[3:17] because nobody likes stale food nobody
[3:19] likes leftovers from yesterday my father
[3:22] was like that he liked fresh food every
[3:24] day so this morning amen we be speaking
[3:26] on the armor of God why are we speaking
[3:29] on the of God we're still dealing with
[3:31] likeness of God now remember we said
[3:33] that the Bible doesn't document that man
[3:36] was created in the likeness it said in
[3:38] the image and likeness but verse 27 of
[3:40] chapter 1 in Genesis said and he created
[3:43] man in his own
[3:44] image right and it doesn't say anything
[3:46] about the likeness so the likeness is
[3:48] the development part where you're going
[3:50] to grow up into Christ you're going to
[3:53] function like Christ you are going to
[3:55] function like Jesus amen amen hallelujah
[3:58] amen amen
[4:00] Amen in every area of your life you
[4:02] ought to be functioning like Jesus
[4:04] meaning we will think like Jesus speak
[4:06] like Jesus act like Jesus he like Jesus
[4:09] amen We Will Walk Like Jesus am amen we
[4:13] will come into His very own likeness now
[4:15] I'm going to put a scripture here for
[4:17] you to understand if you are wondering
[4:19] what does the likeness look
[4:21] like it's exactly what Peter describe
[4:24] when he's telling you to add to your
[4:26] [Music]
[4:27] faith what what Peter is trying to Des
[4:29] describ to us is the likeness of God to
[4:32] have the virtue of Jesus to have the
[4:34] knowledge to have the temperance the
[4:36] patience the godliness the brotherly
[4:39] kindness that is the likeness yes amen
[4:43] and then when we fully have that
[4:44] likeness what is there at the top to
[4:46] meet us at the adoption ceremony amen
[4:49] come on
[4:50] now it's the Holy
[4:52] Ghost Brotherly Love is part brotherly
[4:55] kindness is part of those virtues we
[4:57] need to add before the capsule of love
[5:00] comes down and who is that Capstone of
[5:01] love amen God is love before he comes to
[5:05] cap the individual before he comes to
[5:07] kept the the the the the church there's
[5:10] the Holy Spirit to meet you at the
[5:12] adoption ceremony so the holy spirit
[5:14] that gave you your birth at the
[5:15] beginning amen and put that faith in
[5:17] your heart he here now building you up
[5:19] into the likeness of God into the
[5:22] likeness of Jesus Christ until you come
[5:24] to the top there for your adoption
[5:26] ceremony somebody give God praise amen
[5:29] amen that's the likeness of
[5:31] God Amen that's not a
[5:33] [Music]
[5:35] Doctrine Seven Virtues in the church is
[5:37] not a
[5:38] Doctrine it's the Life of Christ coming
[5:41] to the church to bring you into his
[5:42] likeness amen we know what the image of
[5:45] God is the image of God is priest and
[5:48] King
[5:49] Hallelujah so we can preach the message
[5:52] who is this priest and King because that
[5:54] brother Brandon preached who is this
[5:56] mdic and mdic is both priest and King
[6:01] Jesus is Prophet priest and King while
[6:04] the bride is also given a prophetic
[6:06] Ministry amen she becomes the final
[6:09] prophecy of this age yes amen so she's
[6:12] not only priest and King but she also
[6:13] has a word of Prophecy thou must
[6:16] prophesy again amen hallelujah praise
[6:19] the Lord amen amen so we are coming now
[6:22] when we are building ourselves up into
[6:24] that very own image and likeness
[6:26] Hallelujah now you say but how does a
[6:29] type I'll show you our types who was
[6:31] Esther was Esther a type of the Bride
[6:34] Hallelujah Esther was a type of the
[6:36] Bride but then who is mesic mesic the
[6:39] Bible says he without father and mother
[6:42] amen but somehow the Bible describes
[6:44] Esther as being without father and
[6:48] mother Esther was without father and
[6:51] mother so she was left to the care
[6:56] of Hallelujah who has she left to the
[6:58] care of
[7:00] under a prophetic
[7:02] Ministry Hallelujah so this bride is
[7:05] without father and mother I'm not the
[7:07] son of Charles and Ella brandham without
[7:10] father and without mother you are not
[7:12] the Son and Daughter of of whoever your
[7:14] parents are amen we are here to Quicken
[7:17] that se genene within you and reconnect
[7:19] you back to your roots amen that your
[7:22] father is
[7:24] god without father or mother without
[7:26] beginning of days without ending of days
[7:29] came to show you amen through the
[7:30] message of the hour that you are in the
[7:32] back part of God's
[7:34] mind amen hallelujah and that you are
[7:37] Eternal as God is his eternal that's why
[7:40] mic is without father and mother you
[7:42] were there in the back part of God's
[7:43] mind without father and mother you were
[7:46] bless in the mind of God Amen praise the
[7:49] Lord hallelujah so amen just to show you
[7:52] something very quickly and now to see
[7:54] the time and season that we are living
[7:55] in and that things happen in the world
[7:58] and it's not appaz it
[7:59] yes am there are things that could
[8:02] happen in the world as a sign post for
[8:04] you yes amen like you
[8:07] know we know these two famous pictures
[8:10] we
[8:11] have and this was at the time when they
[8:14] were doing the study of
[8:16] UFOs they were probing and they were
[8:19] looking for unidentified flying objects
[8:22] and they were beaming out signals into
[8:24] the universe is there anybody out
[8:27] there but God Cales down in a pillow of
[8:30] fire and God is
[8:32] light God is light and brother Bram says
[8:36] when you have a birth there's a light he
[8:38] says the size of my button of my shirt
[8:41] that comes into your soul a light comes
[8:44] into you you that's reading the message
[8:46] know that the prophet is saying when you
[8:48] go for an x-ray x-ray it's not an
[8:50] external light giving that light from
[8:51] the inside he says there's an internal
[8:54] Light Within you that produces that
[8:56] light to give it an x-ray so inside of
[8:59] you there's light do you know in the
[9:01] Demonic World they recognize you because
[9:02] of the light you carry yes amen you are
[9:05] the light of the
[9:06] worldall Jesus said you are the light of
[9:09] the world a city on a hill cannot be
[9:12] hid so there's a PowerPoint there
[9:14] brother Josh amen you can put that up
[9:16] Hallelujah so you'll notice here
[9:18] something that happened last week amen
[9:20] last week Saturday it was July the 13th
[9:22] and 13 is signifying
[9:25] [Music]
[9:26] what it's America and prophecy
[9:29] Revelation chapter 13 is speaking about
[9:32] USA yes so on July the 13th there was
[9:36] something that significant to place here
[9:37] at Butler
[9:39] Pennsylvania now
[9:41] notice and this literally got in the
[9:44] room
[9:46] now in Butler
[9:49] Pennsylvania right you know what a
[9:51] butler does he opens the
[9:54] door a butler opens the
[9:56] door okay you go to the next slide I'm
[9:59] just showing you this picture so you can
[10:01] get a glimpse of what I'm saying so you
[10:03] see they're flying under four banners
[10:05] can see the four Flags there and is the
[10:07] church under four
[10:08] banners amen has the church been under
[10:11] four banners yes praise the Lord and
[10:13] then you find here they took a
[10:17] bullet and you can see how it missed him
[10:21] narrowly and it did his here oh yes amen
[10:25] come on now amen you can see it it is
[10:28] here amen
[10:30] praise the Lord if he had turned his
[10:32] head the other way it would have gone
[10:33] through his
[10:34] head right but this is not an I just a
[10:38] random incident so you find here
[10:40] something very significant it hit him on
[10:42] the air but watch here left ear or right
[10:47] ear hit him on the right ear amen praise
[10:50] the Lord you see he falls to the ground
[10:55] and you see the blood
[10:58] dripping now they they said that he he
[11:01] asked the doctor how come there's so
[11:02] much of
[11:03] blood okay how come there's so much of
[11:06] blood he says when when that's the part
[11:08] that bleeds the most your ear for some
[11:11] reason okay and then you see the next
[11:14] picture that he's there at the RNC
[11:17] convention and he's got a bandage on his
[11:19] ear praise the Lord so I know we all
[11:22] wondering what do this type what is it
[11:24] significant
[11:26] of
[11:27] amen and if you want to find an answer
[11:30] we can only go to the word of God yes
[11:32] amen how me if you can say Amen to that
[11:34] amen amen because we find here this is
[11:37] not this is a sign to the church just as
[11:40] much as this was a sign to the church
[11:43] because if you don't know what this is
[11:44] this is the Judgment signs coming upon
[11:47] the Earth amen investigating Angels
[11:50] coming to judge the Earth yes seven
[11:52] angels form the wig what does a wig
[11:55] represent the judge judge of all the
[11:58] Earth so what is he coming to judge now
[12:01] there's a fresh word coming here at this
[12:03] time to a people
[12:05] amen amen that's what we have in the
[12:08] form of the message of the hour fresh
[12:10] word coming to the people amen so then
[12:12] they must be judged based on the word
[12:14] that they
[12:15] preached but what is this also this is
[12:18] the Year of Jubilee yes
[12:21] amen amen this is Jubilee trumpet being
[12:24] sounded amen this is title deed coming
[12:27] back to the Earth yes
[12:30] amen amen what Adam Lost In the Garden
[12:33] of Eden has come back to the Earth amen
[12:36] the title Deeds of man's inheritance
[12:38] meaning you are now have the right to
[12:40] speak with authority oh yes the message
[12:42] come to take away doubt from your heart
[12:44] so therefore you can speak to a mountain
[12:47] and don't doubt because there's no doubt
[12:49] in your heart therefore amen Satan has
[12:51] got no room to walk with because he can
[12:53] only walk through doubt and reasoning
[12:55] but this bride has no doubt and
[12:57] reasoning because the message of the
[12:59] power came to take away all doubt and
[13:00] reasoning amen so therefore she can
[13:03] speak to a mountain and it can move and
[13:05] she don't doubt in her heart but believe
[13:07] what she has said shall come to pass
[13:09] somebody give God praise yes hallelujah
[13:13] thank you Lord thank you Lord amen so
[13:15] we've been called for a time and season
[13:17] as this amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[13:21] now if you go quickly brother Josh you
[13:22] can put up the Exodus 21 for those of
[13:24] you who don't want to turn to your Bible
[13:26] but if you want to mark it down you can
[13:27] read it in Exodus chapter 21 we're going
[13:31] to find the reason for
[13:33] this now he that in Year let in yeah
[13:37] amen what the spirit is saying that's
[13:39] right and Faith cometh by the hearing
[13:42] hearing amen so Exodus chapter 21
[13:48] says let's read from verse one now these
[13:51] are the judgments see talking about
[13:53] judgments now right which Thou shalt set
[13:55] before them if thou buy an Hebrew
[13:57] servant six years He Shall Serve and in
[13:59] the seventh he shall Go free for nothing
[14:02] meaning no price shall be paid it's the
[14:04] Year of Jubilee He must go free
[14:09] am if he come in by himself he shall go
[14:12] out by himself if he will married then
[14:14] his wife shall go out with him if his
[14:16] master have given him a wife he shall
[14:18] have borne him Sons and Daughters the
[14:21] wife and her children shall be a masters
[14:23] and he shall go out by himself if the
[14:26] servant shall plainly say I love my
[14:28] master
[14:29] Master my wife and my children I will
[14:32] not go
[14:35] free then his master shall bring him
[14:37] unto the judges and shall bring him unto
[14:43] the
[14:45] hello shall bring him
[14:47] where B
[14:50] Pennsylvania amen shall bring him to the
[14:53] door
[14:54] yes
[14:56] amen or un to the door HST and his
[14:59] master shall bore his year through with
[15:02] an all and he shall serve him
[15:05] forever meaning that that that this is a
[15:07] sign that they have now totally rejected
[15:09] the message not just any message the
[15:12] message of Revelation
[15:14] 101 amen the message that we have been
[15:17] prophesying again it's a sign amen
[15:20] hallelujah
[15:22] amen put him out there by the butler at
[15:26] the
[15:26] doorpost yes and drove a sign right
[15:29] through his ear amen hallelujah amen
[15:33] showing that they have rejected the
[15:35] Gospel of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[15:38] here what the prophet of God is saying
[15:39] in this now choosing of a bride there's
[15:41] only one message like that preached 1965
[15:44] paragraph 42 he says remember when the
[15:47] Jubilee year come and the priest rode
[15:50] with his trumpet sounding did our priest
[15:52] ride without trumpet sounding amen amen
[15:56] hallelujah that every slave Go free but
[16:00] if they refused to accept their freedom
[16:03] then he had to be taken to the temple to
[16:05] a post and they all bore him through the
[16:07] air and then he served his master always
[16:10] it was put on his ear as a type of
[16:12] hearing Faith cometh by hearing he heard
[16:15] that trumpet but he didn't want to
[16:17] listen to
[16:18] it amen and many time men and women will
[16:21] hear God's truth see it Vindicated and
[16:24] proven truth but yet they don't want to
[16:26] hear
[16:27] it there there some other reason there's
[16:30] some other choosing that they have that
[16:33] then to face up to truth and facts
[16:35] therefore the years can be closed to the
[16:38] gospel they'll never hear it
[16:41] again my advice to you when God speaks
[16:43] to your heart you act right
[16:46] then Elijah gave them a choice you see
[16:49] how Elijah gave them a
[16:51] choice choose in this day whom you will
[16:53] serve if God be God serve him but if Bal
[16:57] be God serve him now we see that all the
[17:00] Natural Things is a type of spiritual
[17:04] things as we went through our lesson
[17:06] this morning
[17:10] amen
[17:12] hallelujah amen now that was for those
[17:14] who believe what I just said amen amen
[17:18] amen for the others it was just a story
[17:21] for
[17:22] you but I'm posting you into the time
[17:24] and season now
[17:26] yes because they rejected brother bram's
[17:29] message remember but now this is a sign
[17:32] that they have rejected the bride's
[17:34] message to prophesy again amen they have
[17:39] totally rejected it
[17:42] yes hallelujah amen a total rejection of
[17:46] the word word so watch now very quickly
[17:49] now what is this guy's name
[17:52] Trump Hallelujah his name is
[17:55] Trump so he could be the last Trump the
[17:59] last time Trump serves a natural typing
[18:01] is spiritual is what I'm trying to tell
[18:03] you amen so pay attention of these
[18:06] things note these things and amen I was
[18:08] just blessed when I read that scripture
[18:10] amen and I saw that the door was there
[18:12] and it was Butler and all of these
[18:14] things and now it's tying up and it's in
[18:16] the right year amen amen as a sign as a
[18:19] mark to show them that they are now been
[18:22] marked and they have chosen to stay with
[18:25] demon powers yes yes yes but we are here
[18:29] to serve notice on the devil amen when
[18:32] I'm reading Revelation 6 and I'm seeing
[18:36] this writer come forth you can throw up
[18:38] Revelation chapter 6 there amen I think
[18:42] it's verse
[18:44] 8 you see this Rider coming
[18:48] forth and the Bible says the rider on
[18:50] the horse is called
[18:52] death yes death is sweeping through the
[18:56] land gross Darkness has covered the
[18:58] people
[18:59] and what does the Bible say death and
[19:02] Hell Followed himen meaning if I took
[19:04] you to the fourth dimension right now
[19:06] you'll see it emptied
[19:12] out because hell is on the
[19:14] earth you look at the insanity of man
[19:18] you look at the insanity how demon
[19:20] powers have invaded the human body and
[19:22] how even at this incident people are
[19:24] laughing and saying how could the
[19:25] shooter have
[19:27] missed They're laughing
[19:29] it reminds me of that story where this
[19:31] girl told this preacher I could see my
[19:34] mother fry in hell and I'll just
[19:37] laugh
[19:39] yeah there's actually a group of people
[19:41] that's laughing people are getting fired
[19:43] from their jobs amen people are posting
[19:45] things on the internet amen de crying AR
[19:48] could the shooter of missed it was the
[19:49] only chance to take out a man talking
[19:51] about
[19:52] killing and calling it normal the
[19:55] imaginations of man's heart is
[19:57] continually evil amen it's a sign of the
[20:00] end time
[20:01] Insanity yes but then on the other side
[20:05] behold they God they hail this man as
[20:07] their
[20:10] savior they hail this man as one to
[20:13] bring solution not realizing that
[20:15] there's a king of kings and there's a
[20:17] Lord of lords and his name is Jesus and
[20:20] he is the only solution Amen to men's
[20:23] problems but they have rejected Jesus
[20:26] Christ yes Hallelujah
[20:30] he has made us Kings and Priests unto
[20:31] our God Amen am amen therefore the Bible
[20:36] calls in King of
[20:39] Kings there's King sitting here this
[20:41] morning oh yes but there's one who's
[20:44] King of Kings there's one who's Lord of
[20:47] lords amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[20:51] you know there's

[42:55] food they gave him the same food that
[42:57] the slaves were
[42:59] eating they treated him the same way as
[43:02] the other slaves he slept in the same

[43:27] Rory amen so in the book of Ephesians at
[43:31] first he tells you what you are
[43:32] predestinated unto what God put you on
[43:35] the earth for he says you were put on
[43:37] the earth for adoption of children and
[43:40] in Ephesians chapter 6 it ends there now
[43:42] with the man fully adopted fully clothed
[43:45] with the full armor of God fully that's
[43:48] part of the dress we're now fully
[43:50] clothed fully robed ready for
[43:54] Authority ready for battle hey we are
[43:57] going to fight until we get out of here

[44:14] Adam am the seventh from Ephesus amen
[44:18] the seventh from the church of Acts is
[44:20] here now on an Enoch walk and she's got
[44:23] Supernatural assistance she's amen H

[44:28] supernatural world meaning that Enoch
[44:30] was in association with the Angelic
[44:32] beings amen even science can't figure
[44:34] out how he moved tons of stones and he
[44:37] created this pyramid they don't know

[44:44] was writing another Bible there amen
[44:46] that he could

[45:51] oncom somebody there to meet you to take
