[1:27] our purpose oh God for which you have
[1:29] called us we ask his Blessings Now in
[1:31] the mighty name of our Lord and Savior
[1:33] Jesus Christ much Thanksgiving
[1:36] amen amen I VI you all in the precious
[1:38] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:40] amen it's certainly good to be found in
[1:42] the house of the Lord amen so we can
[1:45] come and worship Him amen let's turn to
[1:47] the book of Hebrews praise the
[1:57] Lord Caleb if that you can go a bit
[2:00] lower if not you can switch it off
[2:13] amen amen we'll we'll read
[2:16] from amen I'll read the first verse then
[2:18] I want to
[2:19] drop Amen to verse 5 now Faith is the
[2:23] substance of things hoped for the
[2:26] evidence of Things Not
[2:28] Seen amen
[2:30] faith is the EV faith is the substance
[2:32] of things hoped for the evidence of
[2:35] Things Not Seen verse 5 says by faith
[2:38] Enoch was translated that he should not
[2:41] see death amen and was not found because
[2:46] God had translated
[2:48] him for before his translation he had
[2:52] this testimony that he pleased God Amen
[2:55] but without faith it is impossible to
[2:58] please him for he that comes come to God
[3:00] must believe that he is and that he is a
[3:03] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[3:06] Him
[3:09] amen I want to read one more portion
[3:12] there from verse 8 about Abraham by
[3:14] faith
[3:16] Abraham amen why I'm reading this both
[3:18] Enoch and Abraham we know had a change
[3:20] of body by faith Abraham when he was
[3:23] called to go out into a place which he
[3:26] should have receive for an inheritance
[3:29] obeyed and went out not knowing whether
[3:31] he went by faith he sojourned in the
[3:34] land of promise as in a strange country
[3:37] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[3:40] Jacob he hirs with him of the same
[3:42] promise for he looked for his city which
[3:45] had foundations whose Builder and maker
[3:49] is God Amen the Lord had blessings to
[3:51] the reading of his
[3:52] word
[3:57] amen praise the Lord amen if if I want
[4:01] to title this tonight I want to speak on
[4:03] a spiritually successful man of vision
[4:06] amen
[4:07] [Music]
[4:08] amen I titled it that way specifically
[4:11] because normally when I talk about
[4:12] success people just want to focus on the
[4:14] natural amen so I'm speaking on a
[4:16] spiritually successful man of vision
[4:20] amen
[4:22] hallelujah and just uh to highlight
[4:25] something in the scripture there
[4:26] regarding Abraham the Lord had told him
[4:28] I'm going to take you to a phys physical
[4:30] land but something transpired in this
[4:32] land in this man's
[4:34] life amen even though he was living in
[4:37] the land you can see the Bible is saying
[4:39] he focused his attention away from the
[4:41] natural land and he was just living in
[4:44] tents amen and he was looking for a city
[4:48] whose Builder and maker is God so he got
[4:50] his eyes off the carnal Natural Things
[4:53] hallelujah amen and he focused on the
[4:55] Heavenly but he was super abundantly
[4:57] blessed in the natural land amen amen
[5:00] amen so a man if he wants to access the
[5:03] keys of success needs to know that he
[5:06] needs to access the keys to the kingdom
[5:08] and seek the kingdom first am amen now
[5:12] when we are saying a spiritually
[5:14] successful man this man must have access
[5:17] to untapped
[5:19] resources resources that are not easily
[5:23] accessible to just anyone else amen
[5:26] others could have tried to copy what
[5:29] Abraham was
[5:30] doing you know when somebody sees you
[5:32] investing in something they want to
[5:34] invest the same way amen somebody sees
[5:36] you buy a property they probably think
[5:38] okay I should buy a property as well so
[5:41] even if they tried to copy the pattern
[5:43] of Abraham they wouldn't have succeeded
[5:45] because he had a covenant am amen amen
[5:50] he had a covenant with him amen
[5:53] hallelujah so we see as well as the
[5:55] Bride of Jesus Christ with the seven
[5:57] seal open up to us a new land we have
[6:00] access Amen to Supernatural untapped
[6:04] resources amen and I say that we need to
[6:07] tap more into it amen amen hallelujah
[6:10] and and the access to these unta
[6:12] resources like we say are not accessible
[6:14] to anyone and you have to work by
[6:17] spiritual laws of the kingdom of God to
[6:19] be able to access these Supernatural
[6:22] resources amen if we are you know in the
[6:25] natural you have to work with natural
[6:27] laws to attain natural results
[6:30] so when we are coming into spiritual
[6:31] laws you got to work by these spiritual
[6:34] laws amen praise the
[6:36] Lord now many times it'll seem
[6:39] mysterious to everyone around you how is
[6:42] Abraham successful yeah amen what is his
[6:47] key you know in this day and age through
[6:50] the social media and YouTube and all of
[6:52] these accesses through Instagram
[6:54] everybody wants to tell you that you
[6:56] need to sign up with them and they will
[6:58] unlock the secrets of everything how to
[7:00] do
[7:01] things now you would know Does Elon Musk
[7:04] share his
[7:06] Secrets does Bill Gate share secrets so
[7:10] these guys are
[7:12] lying because man is naturally selfish
[7:15] if he is making millions and billions
[7:17] it's not in his natural thing for him to
[7:19] share that information
[7:21] absolutely so what they trying to get
[7:23] you on he sign up onto my cause I will
[7:25] teach you how to do this so they are
[7:27] making money of you
[7:30] amen so to access these things like we
[7:32] saying you got to walk with spiritual
[7:34] laws and it will be mysterious to those
[7:37] that are around us who are not caught up
[7:39] and living in this realm of divine exess
[7:42] remember this realm of divine exess is
[7:45] only open to the bride am amen amen when
[7:49] brother brandom is saying that the
[7:50] Rapture is a revelation only for the
[7:54] bride he's telling you that only she can
[7:57] access this dimension
[7:59] amen yes Lord amen to everyone else
[8:03] it'll be foreign
[8:05] language they won't be able to digest
[8:08] what they hearing and amen and convert
[8:10] it into rapturing
[8:13] faith when they hear it amen hallelujah
[8:16] they they are seeing it still as a
[8:18] mysterious word they can't understand
[8:21] it amen so there are certain Realms and
[8:24] certain excesses that are reserved for a
[8:28] son only when the sun comes into the
[8:31] position of adopted son there are
[8:33] certain Realms and excesses in the
[8:36] kingdom of God that are Reserve when
[8:39] amen for your spiritual maturity amen
[8:41] amen you can't access his Realms amen if
[8:44] we are immature we got to be fully
[8:47] adopted sons in order to qualify to
[8:50] access these hidden Realms amen
[8:53] hallelujah
[8:56] amen amen maybe we'll just uh start out
[9:00] with the prophet and and get some
[9:01] background into what he's saying
[9:03] here he says science has taken man
[9:06] forward more forward greater things with
[9:10] his
[9:10] mind right he talks about the tree of
[9:13] knowledge and he's saying they have
[9:14] taken him greater in the mind farther
[9:17] than ministers have taken him with the
[9:20] spirit which is unlimited
[9:23] yes amen now I want to say that that was
[9:28] 1954 yes and he's talking about the
[9:30] denominational world but we had a
[9:32] prophet amen we had a Watchman amen that
[9:35] was here amen hallelujah and we have the
[9:38] fivefold ministry which is being led by
[9:41] the spirit and is taking the bride into
[9:43] Dimensions which is unlimited
[9:46] amen hallelujah he says but here is what
[9:50] it is SS ain't looking
[9:53] back to what science said a few years
[9:56] ago science is taking what they got now
[9:59] moving forward for something else I say
[10:02] we take the opening of the word and move
[10:04] into something else amen all the
[10:07] promises that have been locked up there
[10:08] for the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[10:12] amen praise the
[10:14] Lord amen now is not the time for us to
[10:17] access Realms of how the angel came to
[10:19] the prophet in the
[10:21] cave how you walked in the first pool
[10:23] Ministry how you walked in the second
[10:24] pool Ministry how you walked in the
[10:26] third pool Ministry if we are still
[10:28] trying to unravel those things something
[10:31] is
[10:32] wrong that was not left for us to
[10:35] analyze am that was the prophet's
[10:38] Ministry and I want to declare that he
[10:40] successfully completed all three polls
[10:43] amen the third pool would get a rainbow
[10:45] trout a people of God Amen which we are
[10:48] called out by the message of the hour
[10:49] amen praise the Lord amen so we are not
[10:53] looking for things to come to pass they
[10:54] have already transpired the bride is
[10:57] called out sealed with the Holy Ghost
[10:59] amen the bridegroom has come for the
[11:01] marriage
[11:02] now praise the Lord amen amen so yeah
[11:07] the prophet again now I just want to
[11:09] amen elaborate on this sence 150 years
[11:12] ago made a statement that if a man ever
[11:16] went the terrific speed of 30 m hour
[11:19] that's pretty slow gravitation would
[11:21] take him off the
[11:23] Earth cuz he was riding in an ox cart do
[11:27] you think science looks back to that
[11:28] today
[11:30] no sir they're going, 1600 M an hour in
[11:33] a jet plane and still going moving
[11:35] further
[11:37] yes we're up to a place where we can
[11:40] believe now he's taking the spiritual
[11:42] application now we are up to a place
[11:45] where we can believe in the baptism of
[11:46] the Holy Ghost we can believe in the
[11:48] healing of the sick and he says let's
[11:51] move on to the resurrection of the dead
[11:53] and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:55] amen amen amen now if that wasn't Within
[11:59] in the capabilities of Sons and
[12:01] Daughters of God brother Brandon won't
[12:03] be telling us let's move on into that
[12:06] yes hallelujah amen as sence can only go
[12:10] so far then it falls back we got
[12:13] unpacked he wants to say untapped we got
[12:16] unpacked Resources by a Divine promise
[12:19] from none other than the Son of God
[12:21] saying whatsoever you ask the father in
[12:23] my name I'll do it am amen hallelujah
[12:29] I want you to really understand what
[12:31] Jesus is saying there when you as a Son
[12:33] of God asked something he said I will do
[12:36] it amen
[12:38] hallelujah he says I feel religious now
[12:41] to think of that all things are possible
[12:43] to them that believe amen he says God
[12:46] I've got enough faith for the sick now
[12:48] God give me enough faith for something
[12:50] else amen amen hallelujah don't ever
[12:53] settle amen there are more dimensions of
[12:55] the Holy Ghost that are able to be
[12:57] opened up to us if we can allowing it
[12:59] and we have the expectation for more
[13:02] amen amen we should never settle and say
[13:04] oh we've reached this level now yes for
[13:07] example my faith is at a level that if
[13:09] our lay hands upon the sick they are
[13:11] recovering he says that shouldn't be our
[13:13] goal he says look for something else
[13:15] amen look for the dead to be raised move
[13:18] into higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost
[13:21] praise the Lord so in other words be
[13:24] more spiritually have a more spiritual
[13:26] vision amen a higher Vision yes amen God
[13:30] is not limited amen by accomplishing
[13:32] certain things God has a complete vision
[13:35] of the complete Plan of Redemption amen
[13:38] and according to God's Vision it's not
[13:40] complete yet yes when God sees it he
[13:43] sees it as already complete but it's
[13:46] still in the process of time but I have
[13:48] good news for you it's almost at the end
[13:50] for the Gentile dispensation God has got
[13:53] a people on the Earth right now who are
[13:55] becoming the word amen amen we know in
[13:58] John 1 we talked in 114 the word was
[14:01] made flesh and dwelt amongst us now
[14:03] flesh is becoming the word amen so what
[14:06] changed when we read about Abraham there
[14:08] what change what experience did he have
[14:11] that would change his Focus from off the
[14:12] Earthly and look for a Heavenly City it
[14:15] was the meeting of
[14:17] MDC MDC shifted his entire
[14:21] Focus why MDC was Priest and King MDC
[14:26] was the image of God amen amen
[14:29] Hallelujah so when Abraham is looking at
[14:31] this man he's saying this is the Genesis
[14:33] 12 126
[14:34] man I was made in this image am amen I
[14:38] was made in this likeness and this is
[14:40] what I am
[14:42] after Abraham knew amen that he was old
[14:45] in body and he knew when the Lord is
[14:48] telling him that your children and your
[14:50] children's children will be prosperous
[14:52] he knew he wasn't going to live forever
[14:54] he was going to go down to the Grave
[14:56] praise the Lord amen amen so the world
[15:00] can celebrate their things but we need
[15:02] to celebrate our things in the kingdom
[15:05] of God Amen you see right now what's
[15:07] happening in the USA they are
[15:09] celebrating their Superman that's right
[15:12] amen but the man is 78 79 years old he
[15:18] himself knows on the outside he can
[15:21] maybe have some energy but in the
[15:23] inside he's going to must up that
[15:25] strength but I want to also draw the
[15:27] parallel and tell you that's a man of
[15:31] vision he's got a goal in mind a purpose
[15:34] in
[15:35] mind amen what he wants to achieve and
[15:38] even though he got defeated amen the
[15:40] second time you know there in 2020 was
[15:43] it he got defeated the man never gave up
[15:47] on his
[15:48] vision amen hallelujah yes the law
[15:52] allowed him to be the president one more
[15:57] time and you would know amen I'm not
[15:59] here to preach politics or I'm not
[16:01] condoning it amen I'm just telling you
[16:04] the amount of persecution he faced the
[16:05] court cases he fac the man was
[16:09] perseverance now are we going to back
[16:11] down every time we come against some
[16:13] sickness some illness some opposition
[16:15] some discouragement oh I don't want to
[16:17] go to church I don't want to do this I
[16:18] don't want to do that are we going to be
[16:21] like a person without a backbone or we
[16:23] going to be persevering for the kingdom
[16:24] of
[16:25] God do we have a goal in mind amen have
[16:28] we caught the mind of Christ concerning
[16:30] our lives yes amen praise the
[16:35] Lord he says but man
[16:37] keeps we go to the next one there right
[16:40] he says but man keeps progressing keeps
[16:44] getting more
[16:46] wiser your grandfather went to see your
[16:48] grandmother in an ox cart your daddy
[16:50] went to see mother drive a horse and
[16:53] buggy I went to see my wife in Immortal
[16:56] tea my boy got an eight cyinder Speedway
[17:00] whatever what you call it probably the
[17:02] children will have a Jet
[17:05] Plane so what is showing you the
[17:07] progress of
[17:08] Science and as brother Bram is detailing
[17:12] it they once took a ox and they attached
[17:14] a car to it what was that somebody had a
[17:17] vision to travel
[17:19] differently it was a vision in a man
[17:22] deep was calling out to deep for
[17:25] more and as the age increases God puts
[17:28] the desire in man for something more yes
[17:32] amen amen man man makes declarations you
[17:35] would heard they made a declaration they
[17:37] want to now oist the flag in M they'll
[17:40] never do it but I'm saying they have a
[17:44] vision amen like they wanted to raise up
[17:47] a tower to B Amen to the heavens yes
[17:49] they they never did it but they had a
[17:52] vision of doing it and it even even got
[17:55] the attention of God that said look how
[17:57] United they are yes amen if they are so
[17:59] United in one speech one Accord man will
[18:02] be able to achieve much more so I'll go
[18:05] down and confuse their
[18:07] language amen so he
[18:11] says that's the way we keep
[18:15] progressing so somebody had a vision hey
[18:17] this hor is too slow for me let me get a
[18:21] horse horse is faster amen then somebody
[18:25] said no why have one horse
[18:29] so they went how many power ores
[18:32] it they took the power of so many OES
[18:35] and they somebody God gave somebody a
[18:39] vision of an
[18:42] engine the mechanics of it yes somebody
[18:46] amen so God anointed people for each age
[18:49] because he needed them to progress yes
[18:53] yeah Hallelujah praise the Lord so what
[18:56] were they doing God was allowing them as
[19:00] time was progressing access to his
[19:04] laboratory praise the
[19:07] Lord
[19:08] amen he says that's the way we keep
[19:11] progressing why why do we keep
[19:13] progressing like that he says because we
[19:15] have a soul
[19:18] amen hallelujah amen we have a soul yes
[19:23] now we read about all of these men that
[19:25] were great engineers and all of these
[19:27] things we don't know if they were
[19:29] selected of God and will be there on the
[19:31] other
[19:32] side we don't
[19:35] know praise the Lord
[19:43] amen he so because we have a soul a bird
[19:46] doesn't have a soul and he goes on to
[19:48] say Amen that a
[19:50] bird is still making this the way did in
[19:53] the Garden of Eden yes they didn't
[19:55] progress
[19:57] yes amen
[19:59] amen
[20:02] hallelujah but we have the bir doesn't
[20:04] have a soul but we have a soul we're not
[20:06] a Creator but we can pervert now we
[20:08] can't create Timber but we can take
[20:11] Timber after God has created and make a
[20:13] house out of
[20:15] it amen because we offsprings of God
[20:19] Sons and Daughters of God no matter how
[20:21] we've Fallen still we have to recognize
[20:23] that we are Sons and Daughters of God in
[20:26] our fallen estate we're still sons and
[20:28] daughters God made a promise God has to
[20:30] keep that promise amen hallelujah now
[20:35] science no matter how advanced they get
[20:37] even now they made an announcement amen
[20:40] we we heard about artificial
[20:43] intelligence now they talking about
[20:45] super artificial
[20:47] intelligence it's gone super now they're
[20:49] talking about that amen praise the
[20:54] Lord but even AI requires is the
[20:59] resources of the
[21:02] Creator no matter how advanced they get
[21:04] they still need resources from God
[21:09] almighty praise the Lord yes amen they
[21:12] were talking about the advancement of
[21:14] signs and what they are going to do with
[21:16] super artificial
[21:18] intelligence they say within 48 Hours

[21:24] you had
[21:26] cancer the inoculation the vaccine

[21:32] cancer will be produced specifically for
[21:34] your body according to your genetics
[21:36] within 48
[21:37] Hours what are they trying to do I only
[21:41] know other one other thing that can work
[21:42] instantly like that is Mark 16 the

[22:05] got to wait couple of
[22:06] days am then they've got to administer
[22:10] whatever medication they have but
[22:12] they're saying now it'll be so
[22:15] Advanced that amen that uh artificial
[22:19] intelligence will be able to analyze
[22:21] your blood and the cancer that's in your
[22:22] blood and the vaccine will be able to
[22:25] specifically attack that cancer cells
[22:29] amen so what am i showing you man has a
[22:32] vision for more yes they are not saying
[22:35] okay we have now chemotherapy and we
[22:37] have other radiation treatments we sort
[22:40] it they're always wanting to achieve
[22:44] more why man knows that his capabilities
[22:48] are
[22:49] Limitless
[22:51] amen amen so can't we as the Bride of
[22:54] Jesus Christ amen realize that our
[22:56] capabilities are Limitless and we are to
[22:59] match the capabilities of the Lord Jesus
[23:04] Christ yes Lord amen that just what I
[23:07] just said
[23:09] there Jesus said all power in Heaven and
[23:12] Earth is given unto me Amen Hallelujah
[23:15] Jesus said Greater Works than these
[23:17] shall he do for I go unto my
[23:20] father amen but where is the where is
[23:24] the dividing now that we can't match
[23:27] what Jesus did
[23:29] what is stopping the flow of unte
[23:31] resources in our
[23:33] lives amen how are we going to become
[23:36] spiritually successful men of
[23:38] vision and and access this realm of
[23:41] untapped
[23:43] resources
[23:45] Hallelujah there's only one way amen and
[23:48] if you put up St John 5:19 there Jesus
[23:51] is giving us the
[23:53] key praise the
[23:55] Lord and unfortunately the keys are not
[23:59] what people
[24:00] like so we don't have screens up we got
[24:03] it this way amen Jesus said to them
[24:05] verily I say unto you the son can do
[24:08] nothing of himself but what he seeth the
[24:11] father do for what things soever he
[24:14] doeth that also doeth the son
[24:19] likewise amen yes so it's a complete
[24:22] submission yes Amen to the will of the
[24:25] father amen a complete surrender to the
[24:28] Holy Ghost yes because then it's no
[24:31] longer us doing it yes amen but it's
[24:34] Christ in me the hope of
[24:36] glory amen so as we are planning now
[24:39] it's gone the third week about the third
[24:41] week now I think in
[24:43] January by this time most dreams most
[24:46] Visions most plans start to fizzle
[24:52] down the same enthusiasm you had on the
[24:54] 1 of January starts to fizzle down
[24:58] amen but you got to have be a man of
[25:01] vision a man of purpose amen amen to
[25:04] keep the dream alive to keep the vision
[25:06] alive to keep the goal
[25:08] alive
[25:12] amen I don't know if it was Columbus or
[25:14] somebody amen these early Travelers when
[25:16] they were traveling they told them that
[25:18] at a certain point if you're traveling
[25:20] on the ocean you're going to fall off
[25:22] the
[25:23] Earth but that didn't stop them yes do
[25:26] you know if that was true they would
[25:28] have Di
[25:29] died but you think it stopped
[25:32] him so he said even at the cost of my
[25:35] life there something in my soul telling
[25:37] me that there is a land
[25:41] amen something was driving him to go
[25:45] west amen something was driving him Amen
[25:48] to go and and and find a country that
[25:52] they had never seen
[25:54] before amen and it should be so with us
[25:58] with Abraham something was driving him
[26:00] he knew there's a land where did mes
[26:02] come from that's the land I
[26:05] want yes amen amen
[26:09] amen
[26:12] the the prophet was telling us I'll just
[26:15] uh illustrate the
[26:17] story he says you can find it there in
[26:21] Believers believe from the heart
[26:24] 57623 paragraph 48 he says in Australia
[26:28] they wanted to build this
[26:30] bridge but the place that they needed to
[26:32] build the bridge had sinking
[26:35] sand and they brought the best Engineers
[26:38] from around the
[26:39] world Amen he says they brought the best
[26:42] Engineers from around the world and all
[26:44] of them said it's impossible for us to
[26:47] erect a bridge in this
[26:49] spot until he said one man spoke up and
[26:52] he said I'll be able to build
[26:55] it now he was a man of vision the
[26:58] prophet says it there finally there was
[27:00] a man who was a man of vision a bridge
[27:02] builder in
[27:03] England he came over looked at the sand
[27:07] surveyed it tested the soils sounded the
[27:10] water looked over all over first he says
[27:13] oh I love it he looked it all over Jesus
[27:16] said a man buying a ground amen first
[27:19] sits down count the cost am amen I want
[27:21] to get to the point
[27:24] amen so the man tested the soils
[27:28] amen and in each bed there was quick
[27:32] sell finally he went to the officials he
[27:34] said I will build a bridge and it will
[27:36] be
[27:38] safe Hallelujah now consider how are we
[27:42] speaking over our situations
[27:44] yes when we are encountering a trial a
[27:47] sickness a circumstance are we going to
[27:50] the word examining it testing it finding
[27:53] the scriptures the promise to know how
[27:55] to activate the keys to be spiritually
[27:57] successful coming back and saying this
[27:59] thing will be well amen I'll overcome
[28:04] this where is our resource I tell you
[28:08] nothing shall be impossible to us
[28:11] am Hallelujah yes Amen in the realm of
[28:15] Finance in the realm of healing Amen in
[28:18] the in the realm of the Holy Ghost yes
[28:20] in the realm of uh children in the realm
[28:23] of marriage in the realm of school in
[28:24] the realm of college nothing shall be
[28:26] impossible amen
[28:29] [Music]
[28:32] Hallelujah the bridge Builders of
[28:34] America and different parts of the world
[28:36] laughed about it the man is mentally
[28:38] heal no one can put a bridge across that
[28:42] even if a chicken should walk the
[28:45] bridge amen it would sink the bridge
[28:48] can't stand the vibrations of a dog you
[28:50] see how people will come against your
[28:53] vision but who analyzed it who did the
[28:57] testing yes who went into the word amen
[29:01] amen hallelujah amen amen who followed
[29:05] the
[29:07] prophet praise the Lord You Have To Be
[29:10] An Eagle to be able to follow the
[29:12] prophet so who did the hard work but now
[29:15] people are going to say no it can't be
[29:17] you mean you all are the only ones saved
[29:19] you're all the only ones going in the
[29:21] Rapture what about all these people what
[29:24] about all these
[29:26] churches he says even if a dog runs
[29:28] across the bridge of
[29:32] vibrations
[29:34] amen which shake the Sands and the
[29:36] bridge would go down it can't be done
[29:38] but this man was a man of vision yes I
[29:42] say this to you in both your spiritual
[29:44] life and natural life never let
[29:47] anyone speak against your vision amen
[29:51] amen God gave you that Vision yes God
[29:54] placed it in your heart amen amen amen
[29:57] hallelujah UAH but this man was a man of
[30:00] vision and he knew what he was talking
[30:02] about for something down in there told
[30:05] him he could do it yes now what he says
[30:08] God give us men in the church like that
[30:11] I say amen amen hallelujah amen oh no we
[30:16] can't do
[30:17] this we can't do certain
[30:19] things how about we try it and let God
[30:23] determine whether we can do it or not
[30:26] amen amen you always I get the msers yes
[30:30] praise the Lord on why we can't do
[30:32] things you notice sometimes when we want
[30:34] to go ahead and do something you always
[30:36] getting someone why we can't do it that
[30:38] way
[30:39] yes well then what's the
[30:44] solution amen praise the Lord now from
[30:47] all the scientific research it could not
[30:50] be done science proved that it could not
[30:53] be done but this man had a vision he
[30:55] could do it so he took the contract
[30:59] now he was a very smart man you see
[31:01] quickly went to work testing the soil
[31:03] sounds the depths of the quicks sand
[31:05] bear tested every bolt every piece of
[31:07] wood every piece of metal every concrete
[31:10] everything had to be perfectly tested
[31:12] because his great name and his character
[31:14] and his ability rested on whether the
[31:17] bridge stood or not and if a man of this
[31:20] Earth by a vision would show that that
[31:23] everything was tested perfectly before
[31:25] he put it to the bridge because of his
[31:27] character because of his name how much
[31:29] more did our blessed Heavenly Father
[31:31] test every word that was ever said or
[31:34] wrote in the Bible amen he tested every
[31:36] word every Prophet the material that
[31:39] goes into the Great Highway every Rock
[31:41] every
[31:42] material before it's placed in the body
[31:45] of Christ has to be tried chasen amen no
[31:49] exceptions
[31:51] everyone had to be tested by the holy
[31:55] spirit so he says I've he forget his
[32:01] name so he got the best mechanics best
[32:04] concrete man he could find amen so I
[32:08] want to get to the part what he did
[32:10] you're probably wondering how did he
[32:11] build it on quick
[32:13] sand
[32:14] amen we going to go past this
[32:17] amen so what he did was he started to
[32:20] dig away all the quick
[32:23] sand amen go down
[32:26] further he he started to dig all the
[32:29] quick sand see the prophet is now
[32:31] bringing it spiritually he started to
[32:33] take away days of Miracles his
[32:36] pasted all the unbelief all the quick
[32:39] sand and he went down down down for
[32:42] hundreds of feet beneath the water
[32:45] even until he blow that shifting Sands
[32:48] out of the
[32:49] way
[32:52] amen he put this concrete anchored in
[32:54] the Rock on the bottom of the sea
[32:59] amen and anything that worth having has
[33:02] a price attached to it how great the
[33:05] Salvation what a great price you know I
[33:07] was telling a brother I forget who it
[33:09] was and you know when you say you're
[33:11] going to do this do that they're going
[33:12] to first most people just say oh but
[33:14] this is in the way I said I don't care
[33:16] what's in the way of the
[33:18] building if it's if the price is good
[33:21] enough see that if it's worth having
[33:24] brother Brandon is saying it has a price
[33:26] attached to it
[33:30] yes amen it might cost a bit more but it
[33:34] can be done yes amen hallelujah amen and
[33:39] my my other statement to him is that we
[33:42] are not not going to do something
[33:44] because of the
[33:48] cost amen because if we attach your
[33:52] value to it then we are telling God is
[33:54] incapable of meeting the
[33:56] need amen we are telling God you are
[34:00] limited in your
[34:01] resources praise the Lord
[34:04] yes but then again that's a vision for
[34:08] the church amen amen it's a vision where
[34:12] we can all get together with one mind
[34:14] one Accord amen hallelujah praise the
[34:17] Lord so he got rid of all the shifting
[34:20] sand until he reached Solid Ground and
[34:22] from there he began to pour the
[34:26] concrete amen so I'm saying let us get
[34:29] rid of all the shifting SS of doubt the
[34:32] shifting Sands of unbelief do you know
[34:35] that a man of vision has to be highly
[34:37] motivated yes amen amen a man of vision
[34:41] is not an ordinary man amen nothing can
[34:45] distract him from his goal from his
[34:47] vision from his purpose so that's why no
[34:50] matter how they try to distract Jesus
[34:52] from his goal and his purpose yes for
[34:55] being the Lamb of God for giving his
[34:57] life life on the cross nothing could
[34:59] separate him from his
[35:02] purpose praise the lord the devil even
[35:04] tried to offer him stuff yes amen praise
[35:06] the Lord so let's get rid of all doubt
[35:09] all reasoning all fear insecurities you
[35:13] know insecurity is a bad
[35:15] thing that oh maybe this is not my
[35:18] portion in life no the Lord says that if
[35:23] you put your hand to work God will bless
[35:25] it yes God put man in the garden and he
[35:27] said work yes Hallelujah do you know we
[35:31] still have access to the
[35:33] ground but we are so lazy we want to go
[35:35] to the
[35:41] shop
[35:43] amen God still blesses if you plant
[35:48] yes yes whatsoever you s there scripture
[35:51] whatever you s you will reap we only
[35:54] want to apply that monetary wise to
[35:57] Blessings
[35:59] but God still has given us access to the
[36:02] ground because that was man's primary
[36:04] purpose when he was put in the body of
[36:05] Flesh till the ground God has got to
[36:09] honor that law amen amen for I got
[36:12] shocking news for some of the younger
[36:14] people here that Apple that orange and
[36:18] all that fruit and veg that you see in
[36:20] the store didn't just appear
[36:25] there if you ask someone where CES come
[36:28] from they'll tell you from
[36:30] Checkers or from Pick and Pay whichever
[36:33] store
[36:35] amen but there's a farmer behind
[36:38] it there's somebody who's tilling the
[36:41] ground
[36:43] yes we we seeing all our fancy devices
[36:46] and all our our gold and all of these
[36:49] things somebody is working the
[36:53] ground
[36:55] amen so God has amen still these
[36:59] accesses to
[37:02] us like we saying Columbus he was told
[37:05] to fall off the Earth he was a man of
[37:07] vision
[37:08] Edison now this is very powerful Edison
[37:11] tapped into a resource that belongs to
[37:15] God
[37:21] Amen it was actually was the guy
[37:25] before amen
[37:28] uh I got it here somewhere the prophet
[37:29] is speaking about it Benjamin
[37:31] Franklin praise the
[37:34] Lord now you would know that electricity
[37:37] even now they can't Define what it
[37:40] is people think they know what it
[37:44] is they know it's
[37:46] a it's a force that's there yes they've
[37:51] learned over the years now how to harest
[37:53] it and how to bring it down to usable
[37:56] appliances
[37:58] they've learned how to take that current
[38:00] amen we don't use that raw
[38:03] current amen that current is stream I
[38:06] don't know the right word but it's
[38:07] streamlined
[38:09] reduced you put
[38:11] resistance okayy to reduce the current I
[38:13] don't know they bring the current down
[38:17] to be able to handle the wattage on the
[38:21] speaker
[38:23] amen if you probably connect this thing
[38:26] straight to that power lines the thing
[38:28] is going to blow up
[38:30] yes
[38:32] amen praise the
[38:39] Lord why I'm saying that he tapped into
[38:43] what he tapped into was a resource from
[38:46] God at one time man didn't have
[38:48] electricity on the
[38:50] earth man didn't have
[38:52] light but God allowed them to access his
[38:55] laboratory for a reason amen amen so
[38:59] here the prophet now I'm just going to
[39:01] go through it we're going to close now
[39:02] amen he says the holy spirit is overseen
[39:05] that through the age that all God's word
[39:07] is inspired and in time the old Wheels
[39:10] gr slow but it show it gr sure so things
[39:13] may go slow but the wheels are
[39:19] moving it's got to be just the way God
[39:22] said it was going to
[39:23] be no matter how unreal it seems it's
[39:26] going to be that way
[39:28] one time they didn't have electricity
[39:30] but some men believed there was such a
[39:32] thing he kept walking tiess hours until
[39:35] he discovered what it was and the same
[39:37] thing by television by automobile and so
[39:39] forth God put these things here for our
[39:45] benefit amen
[39:48] hallelujah God is putting these things
[39:50] here for whose
[39:51] benefit our
[39:54] benefit now if we were acquainted with
[39:56] the supernatural
[39:57] oh there he's talking to me somebody say
[39:59] he's talking to
[40:01] me if we were acquainted with the
[40:04] supernatural just take a man where the
[40:07] man in his senses is limited to his
[40:09] senses but a man in his spirit is
[40:13] unlimited so don't try to do things in
[40:16] the
[40:17] flesh he says a man and his spirit is
[40:21] unlimited the tree of knowledge can only
[40:23] climb so far and breaks back but the
[40:25] Tree of Life goes on Amen
[40:28] and now the science has taken man
[40:29] farther with his five senses than we
[40:31] have with his soul but now look at look
[40:34] at the key to it read past that what
[40:37] came to access our soul the Holy Ghost
[40:41] with what the the word of the message of
[40:44] the
[40:46] hour so I'm saying there's only one
[40:48] prophetic class of people that have
[40:50] accesses to the realm of the
[40:53] soul that can access his untapped
[40:56] resources
[40:58] yes amen I pray somebody's getting it
[41:02] tonight so there's only a certain class
[41:04] of people that can access these things
[41:07] and if you want the type of it it's
[41:09] Enoch Enoch was tasked to write the
[41:11] second
[41:13] Bible but there's no blueprints for it
[41:16] we don't have recorded documents for it
[41:19] but God tked him to write the second
[41:21] Bible in the
[41:24] pyramid what accesses did he have
[41:27] what realm did he tap
[41:29] into praise the
[41:31] lord well we've got untapped resources
[41:35] where all things are possible amen talk
[41:38] about split atoms and waves
[41:42] amen when Benjamin Franklin first found
[41:45] electricity he said I got it I got it
[41:48] but he didn't know what he had a long C
[41:51] Thomas Edison said it'll work for us and
[41:54] he didn't care how long it took he tried
[41:56] 10 thousand different
[42:00] wires but yet he found a wire that would
[42:03] finally carry the electronic or the
[42:06] electricity into the wire he know it was
[42:08] power and that power would work in our
[42:12] benefit and now we found salvation that
[42:14] will save us from
[42:18] sin take the violence man or woman drunk
[42:21] up prostitute make a child of God that
[42:25] same faith that same power will lift up
[42:28] a fallen man woman of that it'll work
[42:30] for us in many different ways it'll heal
[42:33] our bodies if you can just find the
[42:34] right approach you've got to find how to
[42:37] do
[42:42] it so there's no sickness no disease
[42:45] incurable what is brother Brandon saying
[42:48] you've got to find how to do it when
[42:51] when Jesus was coming back from the
[42:52] mountain there and his disciples
[42:54] couldn't cast a demon out from that boy
[42:58] was there a way to do
[43:00] it were the disciples asking Jesus how
[43:03] can we do it so they is a way to do it
[43:06] amen
[43:08] yes the question is are we willing to
[43:11] spend tireless hours
[43:13] yes get into the word build our faith
[43:16] till we believe the promise to get the
[43:19] desired result because brother Bram is
[43:21] saying here if we can have the right
[43:24] approach you've got to find how to do it
[43:26] yes
[43:28] so nobody should be able to say that I
[43:31] was born poor and I'll die poor because
[43:33] you can find a way to get out of your
[43:35] poverty
[43:36] [Music]
[43:39] Hall praise the Lord amen are we using
[43:43] the same principle the same
[43:46] law and let me tell you a lazy attitude
[43:49] a lazy mentality will never do you any
[43:53] good it's going to require determination
[43:56] it's going to require Focus yes praise
[43:59] the
[44:03] Lord last quote now can you imagine this
[44:06] building here being energized tonight
[44:08] for light by the electricity electricity
[44:10] is the Unseen Force when it's Earnest
[44:13] and brought on when Benjamin Franklin
[44:15] first screamed I've got it he didn't
[44:18] know what he had but Along come Edison
[44:20] and put it to work and today we can send
[44:23] a wireless telegram from right this
[44:25] place here to any around the world by a
[44:28] wireless telegram an unseen Force moves
[44:31] it through space that no one can catch
[44:34] it only Machinery can catch it because
[44:36] it's too fast for the eye but yet
[44:39] there's a force that telegram coming
[44:41] through now brother Brandon would have
[44:44] been you can send a WhatsApp to someone
[44:46] in America right now you can even call
[44:49] them you can even video call them
[44:52] technology has
[44:54] advanced praise the Lord if the natural
[44:57] laws of God which is electricity and
[44:59] things once handed in the right capacity
[45:03] can do those things I am saying the the
[45:06] open book The Open Word in the right
[45:09] hands in your hands amen praise the Lord
[45:14] how much more could the power of the
[45:15] Holy Ghost once passing through the
[45:17] human heart by faith what it could do
[45:21] yes now I'm going to close and tell you
[45:24] this that electricity is not an ordinary
[45:26] Force
[45:29] every name of God starts with
[45:35] what what does electricity start
[45:38] with amen they know it's not a natural
[45:45] force that's why they named it
[45:48] e praise the lord it's a resource of
[45:53] God that God allowed them to tap into
[45:56] that Laboratory
[45:57] amen praise the Lord amen even the
[46:00] fourth dimension we talk about the
[46:01] opening of spiritual doors yes is a door
[46:03] open to us that we can see this how is
[46:06] he projecting
[46:08] it what is controlling there you are
[46:10] able to
[46:12] see
[46:15] hallelujah it's a it's a resource open
[46:18] to us so I'm saying to be spiritual
[46:20] successful and a man of vision there are
[46:23] untapped resources that God has only
[46:26] allowed his specific class of people to
[46:28] get into to tap into am we can choose to
[46:31] be complacent about it we can choose to
[46:34] not go into it and we can continue
[46:37] living Our Lives as normal or we can say
[46:40] I will dedicate my time I don't care if
[46:42] it takes me countless hours I don't care
[46:45] if it cost me my
[46:47] sleep praise the Lord amen I'm looking
[46:50] for men of vision I'm looking for men of
[46:54] purpose who's not going to rely on their
[46:56] natural five senses of the flesh man to
[46:59] get them by in this life but are able to
[47:02] tap into spiritual resources and Realms
[47:05] of the Holy
[47:07] Ghost praise the Lord amen
[47:13] amen let's read one more quote paragraph
[47:15] 112 in perfect Faith praise the Lord
[47:23] [Music]
[47:27] I'm looking for somebody who's going to
[47:29] connect with this
[47:31] tonight that's not going to come here on
[47:33] Sunday and say I forgot what you preach
[47:38] Wednesday but a man moving with a vision
[47:41] with a purpose to say if there's
[47:44] untapped
[47:46] resources and Realms that have not been
[47:51] accessed and maybe it was accessed One
[47:53] Time by The
[47:55] Prophet but now
[47:59] the wells have been covered the caves
[48:03] have been covered to this Realms I'm
[48:06] going to uncover it amen here what the
[48:09] prophet of God says Jesus lived in a
[48:11] world that no one know it about I've
[48:14] been trying to express this the last
[48:16] couple of weeks now the shout is a realm
[48:18] that nobody knows
[48:19] about except the
[48:22] bride yes right it's a door open to
[48:25] us he was an odd person he lived in a
[48:28] world of perfect faith in the perfect
[48:31] God in which he was am now he says if we
[48:35] live in a perfect faith of a Christian
[48:39] amen so you see that's an exis we can
[48:41] but he's saying if we yes so there's a
[48:43] choice there yes if we lived in a
[48:46] perfect faith of a Christian to what we
[48:48] are we'd be a Mystic to the whole
[48:51] world the people won't understand you
[48:55] you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit
[48:57] said you would do see St John
[49:00] 5:19 You' walk in the spirit what the
[49:03] spirit said you would do what it forbid
[49:05] you would not do then people began to
[49:08] say you're a Mystic person to them
[49:11] that's the way it is to all believers
[49:13] they were Mystic people don't understand
[49:15] because they live in a world to
[49:18] themselves Jesus lived in a world that
[49:20] no one else could touch the disciples
[49:23] couldn't understand him when he spoke
[49:25] they say this and then they said you
[49:28] talk in riddles we don't understand this
[49:30] how can you be there wasn't in the world
[49:32] that he lived in so they couldn't
[49:34] understand him nobody could understand
[49:38] him and so when a man lives by faith and
[49:41] walks by faith I mean substance Faith
[49:44] he's isolated from the entire world and
[49:47] becomes a new creature in Christ there
[49:50] you're getting into bright
[49:52] material you're getting into rapturing
[49:55] condition that means for each one of us
[49:57] not just pastors deacons trustees means
[50:00] for the Ley every individual walks in
[50:03] the world with God Alone you're baptized
[50:06] into the kingdom and there's nobody in
[50:08] there but you and God he gives the
[50:09] orders you pack them out whatever he
[50:12] says there's not a Shadow of Doubt
[50:13] nowhere you walk right on if the Lord
[50:16] says this there's nobody in the world
[50:18] can talk you out of it you got right on
[50:21] just the same now you're coming into
[50:23] perfect Faith perfect Perfection that
[50:25] nothing that cannot
[50:27] fail that faith never fails he was a
[50:30] Mystic with his perfect Faith so is it
[50:33] now with those who have perfect Faith
[50:35] are a Mystic to
[50:38] others
[50:40] amen I'm
[50:42] saying that we have been limiting
[50:45] ourselves to access
[50:48] Realms to access dimensions of the Holy
[50:52] Ghost
[50:54] Hallelujah number one it could be
[50:56] through ignorance if we don't know we
[50:57] have the ability to access his Realms
[51:00] amen amen we're too scared to walk in
[51:04] the
[51:06] Supernatural
[51:08] or we are too caught up with the carnal
[51:12] life that those things don't even
[51:14] concern
[51:17] us contacting the supernatural World
[51:21] praise the
[51:22] Lord hallelujah but what we are looking
[51:25] for and trying to inspire in us right
[51:28] now is to raise up that man amen amen
[51:31] that's got that deep call within him to
[51:33] say whatever you saying I see myself in
[51:36] that
[51:36] amen I'm able to live in those
[51:39] Realms I'm able to tap into those
[51:43] Dimensions praise the Lord
[51:47] yes and what I'm saying is because
[51:49] sometimes you can be so consumed so
[51:52] burdened by the normal circumstances and
[51:54] pressures of life I am saying by living
[51:56] in this world you can rise above those
[51:58] circumstances amen amen the flesh
[52:01] becomes nothing amen amen you speak to
[52:05] mountains they
[52:07] move you speak to winds and they obey
[52:10] yes so in order to access and be take
[52:14] control of the natural realm you first
[52:16] got to take control of the spiritual
[52:18] realm hallelujah amen amen praise the
[52:23] Lord I wish I was getting a better amen

[52:52] work it's not when I get a
[52:55] chance yes
[52:57] that's right God study men who had
[53:01] success in the Natural Life who tapped
[53:04] into electricity who tapped into laws
[53:07] you'll see they dedicated the entire
[53:09] life to it that's right entire being
[53:13] they eat sleep and smell these
[53:16] things
[53:18] amen how determined are we to be all
[53:22] that was prophesied about us
[53:27] how determined are we to be a
[53:28] spiritually successful man of
[53:30] vision
