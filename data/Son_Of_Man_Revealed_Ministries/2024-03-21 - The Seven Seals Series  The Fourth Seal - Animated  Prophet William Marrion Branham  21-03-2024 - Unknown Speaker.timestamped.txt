[0:20] verse seventh and eth is always two
[0:23] verses the first is the announcement and
[0:26] the second verse is what he saw and when
[0:30] when he had opened the fourth seal I
[0:32] heard the voice of the fource fourth
[0:35] Beast say come and see and I looked and
[0:39] behold a Pale Horse and his name that
[0:42] set on
[0:44] him that
[0:46] set was was death and Hell Followed him
[0:51] and power was given unto them over the
[0:55] four parts of the earth to kill with the
[0:57] sword and with hunger and with death and
[1:00] with beast of the
[1:02] earth and um the fourth Beast the living
[1:06] creature Like an Eagle said to John come

[1:15] Plan of Redemption has been hid in this
[1:18] book and he said come and see the fourth
[1:21] mystery of the book of redemption that's
[1:24] been hidden in this book come see and
[1:28] John went to see and he saw a Pale
[1:34] Horse and again the same riter upon this
[1:38] Pale Horse now he has a
[1:43] name called
[1:45] Death now notice none of the other Rider
[1:50] none of the other horses or no time that
[1:53] this rider ever wrote they didn't have
[1:55] that man had no
[1:57] name but now he is called death it's not
[2:04] mentioned he's revealed now what he is
[2:07] is death but now when it comes forth the
[2:10] eagle
[2:11] age that's the one that God always
[2:14] Likens His prophets the Eagles he calls
[2:17] himself an eagle the eagle goes so high
[2:20] he ain't nothing else can touch him amen
[2:22] not only is he up there but he's built
[2:24] for that position when he gets up there
[2:26] he can see where he's at 68 million in
[2:30] Protestants as we talk from from
[2:33] Smuckers uh uh glorious reform the of
[2:37] the mology of Rome last night we find
[2:40] that up to the 1500 Mark I believe it
[2:43] was or 18 I don't remember exactly now
[2:46] but it was
[2:48] 68 million put to death to protest the
[2:53] first Roman
[2:55] Church oh no wonder he could impersonate
[2:59] himself but in the
[3:01] personified uh name of and called Death
[3:05] you sure was
[3:07] now God only knows how many he caused to
[3:11] spiritually die by his anti-bible word
[3:15] teaching this is the one he put 68
[3:18] million to the sword and
[3:20] kill and probably literally billions
[3:25] died spiritually on his false
[3:28] teaching no what you can think the name
[3:30] of death the fourth stage of his
[3:34] ministry is's called the
[3:37] beast and in this fourth horse if you'll
[3:41] notice all the first one was
[3:44] white and then the next one was red and
[3:48] the next one was black and the fourth
[3:50] one all of these other three was
[3:53] representing it because pale is red and
[3:58] and uh White and is so mixed together
[4:01] see it it is all mixed in this one horse
[4:05] now I want you to notice the four of
[4:08] them notice the off Mark of four of the
[4:12] spiritual mathematics God is
[4:15] threes this is four he's in four here
[4:20] first Antichrist white second false
[4:24] prophet red third viker of heavens and
[4:27] earth and and purgatory black forth the
[4:31] Beast Pale Horse Satan being kicked out
[4:34] of heaven you want to read that
[4:36] Revelations 12 and
[4:39] 13 Satan being kicked out of heaven then
[4:42] in Revelations 1318 he is Incarnate in
[4:45] the person of the
[4:48] Beast he's first the Antichrist yes just
[4:51] the teaching called
[4:54] Nicolia then he becomes from that to a
[4:57] false prophet if he an antichrist
[5:01] Antichrist is against anything that's
[5:03] against God's word is against God
[5:06] because a word is God and then when he
[5:09] come to crowning time then he become the
[5:12] false prophet of his Antichrist
[5:14] teaching get it then he gets a sword
[5:17] because he unites his powers together
[5:20] then he don't have to ask nobody he's
[5:23] governor of state he's governor of
[5:25] Heaven receives a Triple Crown makes
[5:28] himself an idea called
[5:30] we find it put it on down through the
[5:31] Bible count his numeral numbers and
[5:33] everything else here is playing right
[5:35] back here in number four not number
[5:37] three number four see now let's turn
[5:40] Revelations 12 let's just read this just
[5:42] a little bit because we we'll have time
[5:43] to do it and um let's read uh
[5:46] Revelations the the 12th chapter and the
[5:50] 13th verse and when the dragon saw and
[5:54] he was cast out into the Earth he
[5:58] persecuted the woman with which brought
[6:00] forth The Man Child now I see he was
[6:03] cast out of the earth and becomes
[6:06] incarnate as the Antichrist Spirit
[6:09] become incarnate into a man that man
[6:11] changes from one thing to another from
[6:14] an antichrist Spirit to a false prophet
[6:16] and then the Beast comes into him how we
[6:19] find out here that this Satan after
[6:22] being kicked out of heaven incarnates
[6:24] himself in the Beast and now he is a
[6:28] beast and Antichrist false prophet now
[6:32] beast and given the name of death and
[6:35] Hell follows him amen fully Satan on his
[6:38] throne oh my on the earth is Satan
[6:43] representative on the earth that he now
[6:48] is head of the kingdoms of the world the
[6:53] very same kingdoms that he offered to
[6:55] the Lord Jesus and Matthew
[6:58] 4 Satan now becomes a full King all
[7:02] right notice now he be given a heart of
[7:05] a beast at that time and Satan will
[7:07] incar himself because when the church
[7:09] goes up Satan's cast
[7:12] down it's done man all these accusing is
[7:15] done see as long look as long as the
[7:20] intercessor is still on the
[7:22] throne Satan can stand there and
[7:25] accuse because he is the attorney of the
[7:29] other side he is the opponent of Christ
[7:32] but when our Lord appears here on Earth
[7:36] he will be riding on a Snow White Horse
[7:40] and he'll be completely fully the emmanu
[7:45] the word of God incarnate in a
[7:48] man how much different there is in
[7:51] that's the difference of
[7:53] it notice the Antichrist is on a pale
[7:57] horse mixed colors of horse is a beast
[8:01] that represents a power his power is all
[8:03] mixed up why it's

[8:14] powers it's all kinds of powers mixed
[8:17] together a mixed Pale Horse was he's got
[8:20] all kinds of powers but when Jesus comes
