[1:29] oh amen glory be to his name amen and
[1:32] he's worthy of all praise amen let's
[1:35] turn to our Bible amen
[1:40] [Music]
[1:42] if you want
[1:43] [Music]
[1:48] let's start off reading in
[1:52] Philippians chapter 3
[1:55] .
[1:56] in verse 14.
[2:07] we can start from verse 13 amen he says
[2:10] Brethren I count not myself to have be
[2:13] apprehended
[2:15] but this one thing I do
[2:18] forgetting those things which are behind
[2:22] amen isn't that a good thing to do
[2:25] we can't do a thing about the past
[2:28] he says forgetting those things which
[2:30] are behind and reaching forth unto those
[2:34] things which are before
[2:37] amen how many of us are living life like
[2:40] that
[2:41] not looking backwards amen but Reaching
[2:44] Forward
[2:46] to find many that walk with us on this
[2:49] journey of faith are looking backwards
[2:52] and still trying to figure out stuff
[2:53] from the past
[2:55] but he said reach forward amen answer
[2:58] the things which are before
[3:01] that's why the property is preaching
[3:03] things that are to be amen he said I
[3:05] press toward the mark for the prize of
[3:08] the eye calling of God in Christ Jesus
[3:11] amen while the world is being mocked by
[3:14] rejecting the Holy Ghost we also take on
[3:17] the mark of Christ
[3:18] it says I press toward the mark for the
[3:21] price of the High Calling of God in
[3:25] Christ Jesus
[3:27] amen what a high calling we have what a
[3:30] privilege and a blessed people we are
[3:32] amen and I'm so grateful to be
[3:34] associated with you amen who have been
[3:37] called the highest calling upon the face
[3:39] of the Earth amen amen you are
[3:43] Overcomers in this last days amen
[3:45] hallelujah and let's read Revelation
[3:48] chapter 22 amen the last chapter in the
[3:51] Bible
[3:52] amen
[3:55] could read from verse 11
[3:59] the Bible says
[4:02] we get the remember
[4:05] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[4:09] still
[4:12] and he which is filthy let him be filthy
[4:16] still
[4:17] and he that he is righteous let him be
[4:20] righteous still
[4:22] and he that is Holy let him be holy
[4:26] still
[4:27] amen everyone's going to remain in the
[4:30] condition
[4:31] amen hallelujah you may be seated bless
[4:34] the name of Jesus
[4:38] amen
[4:44] amen some of you have already picked it
[4:48] up in the spirit that the separation has
[4:50] already started
[4:52] and those that are faithless Who Remain
[4:54] faithless
[4:56] and those who have faith will move into
[4:59] another sphere another dimension another
[5:02] gear
[5:04] amen hallelujah because this is the time
[5:07] and this is the season this is the time
[5:09] for the opening of everything that was
[5:11] prophesied regarding the Bride of Jesus
[5:13] Christ
[5:15] amen amen so glory be to his name that
[5:19] we are part of that aren't you grateful
[5:21] that you are part of that amen amen
[5:23] doesn't it fill your heart with joy
[5:24] tonight to know
[5:26] that you have overcoming faith
[5:31] game
[5:32] amen
[5:35] thank you
[5:36] so
[5:38] this
[5:40] rocket launching of
[5:44] all the barriers of unbelief
[5:47] amen it's time to rocket launch our
[5:50] faith past all the barriers of unbelief
[5:53] amen
[5:54] amen we haven't received a word in this
[5:58] hour and in this day to remain amongst
[6:01] denominational chickens amen amen amen
[6:04] mean that we receive the word just to to
[6:07] cruise along yes but the word was sent
[6:10] to give us rapturing faith and what is
[6:14] rapturing Faith it's afraid to change
[6:16] these bodies
[6:18] so how can we use this word to get along
[6:22] in a natural life
[6:24] the world is not designed to accommodate
[6:26] the Natural Life
[6:29] amen the word is not designed to
[6:31] accommodate the natural man
[6:34] because the natural man will war against
[6:36] the word of God
[6:38] war against the things of God the
[6:41] natural man doesn't want to get into the
[6:42] program of God
[6:44] but inside of the natural man is a soul
[6:48] amen into the gene of God in that soul
[6:51] and the spirit man of God Amen
[6:55] be a Revival
[6:58] looking at a rocket launching our faith
[7:01] we cannot remain in the ordinary anymore
[7:03] right
[7:05] amen not if you're tired of the ordinary
[7:07] amen how many of you are tired of just
[7:09] all going to church and going back home
[7:11] amen how if you want to move into
[7:13] another gear where you know you're
[7:14] walking with God Amen you're communing
[7:16] with God Amen you are seeing a
[7:19] supernatural manifest in your life yeah
[7:23] amen now's not the time to hang around
[7:26] chicken
[7:27] amen hallelujah we can't have chicken
[7:30] feet
[7:31] and take a eagle Journey amen amen we
[7:36] need to leave all unbelief behind amen
[7:39] amen and there are levels who are free
[7:42] we are talking about rocket launching
[7:44] our faith but there are levels to our
[7:47] feet
[7:48] amen
[7:50] I don't wanna well I'm out
[7:54] not equal
[7:56] that's the same
[7:58] same anointing I think you believe that
[8:00] amen because when we preach it we preach
[8:02] like all of us will be able to do
[8:04] exactly the same thing that we are all
[8:06] carbon copies of one
[8:10] let's turn to current
[8:13] ly how the spirit was able to appreciate
[8:15] one another's giftings and in the body
[8:18] we are quickly framed and we cannot do
[8:20] without one another let's read this
[8:22] quickly enough now concerning spiritual
[8:24] gifts Brethren I would
[8:27] not have you ignorant this is First
[8:29] Corinthians chapter 12. amen
[8:33] amen
[8:34] okay let's go to verse
[8:37] 4. now there are diversities of gifts
[8:39] but the same spirit amen amen watch now
[8:42] there are differences of administrations
[8:45] right but the same Lord
[8:48] they are diversities of operations
[8:51] but it is the same God which worketh all
[8:55] in all
[8:56] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[8:59] given to every man to profit with all
[9:02] for to one is given the spirit the word
[9:05] of wisdom
[9:09] you see why I'm saying not all of us are
[9:10] equally gifted amen
[9:12] to one is given the word of wisdom
[9:17] to another the word of knowledge
[9:20] by the same spirit amen
[9:23] to another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[9:26] another the gift of healing by the same
[9:28] spirit amen
[9:31] Amen to another Faith by The Same Spirit
[9:34] to another the gift of healing by The
[9:36] Same Spirit right
[9:38] hello what
[9:41] you alone
[9:43] I've been empowered with that Faith amen
[9:46] don't take your faith and speak to
[9:49] another brother who's going to tell you
[9:51] no brother that day is passed
[9:55] God revealed it to you amen God called
[9:58] you for it
[10:00] you've got to fulfill it because you
[10:02] have to wait for it
[10:04] no
[10:06] I want miracles
[10:07] [Music]
[10:14] to another the interpretation of tongues
[10:17] but all these workers that one and the
[10:20] self-cent spirit dividing to every man
[10:23] severally as he will amen yes amen so
[10:28] don't be discouraged when others don't
[10:29] see your vision
[10:31] don't be discouraged when others do not
[10:34] want to connect with you in their
[10:35] grammar they are not called to connect
[10:37] with you in that Rhythm they are called
[10:39] with another gifting another anointing
[10:41] let them operate under their gift under
[10:43] their faith
[10:46] and you operate under your gifting a
[10:48] lady your faith right
[10:51] right
[10:52] amen hallelujah
[10:56] amen
[10:58] everybody feeling good amen if you read
[11:01] from verse 12 onwards it tells you that
[11:03] we are one body and many members right
[11:05] we don't have time to break that down
[11:07] now
[11:08] amen let's go to our next slide
[11:10] now when we have faith the prophet says
[11:13] that Faith does not notice our age who's
[11:17] the youngest amongst us here
[11:19] probably also
[11:22] who's the oldest amongst us
[11:25] amen
[11:31] but free don't notice your age
[11:35] Frank can work in a nine-year-old
[11:38] as good as it is in our 21 year old
[11:41] brother
[11:44] amen
[11:45] free don't notice your age
[11:48] and the sister said
[11:51] and the sister said
[11:55] we got a Brother's meeting going on here
[11:57] and the sister said
[12:00] amen
[12:01] because sisters don't want anyone to
[12:03] know to say age
[12:05] so sisters love Faith because Faith
[12:08] don't notice your age
[12:10] faith is not a respecter of age
[12:15] they don't know the circumstances the
[12:17] prophet says
[12:20] amen
[12:22] circumstances we spoke about that last
[12:24] week
[12:25] the symptoms that we experience in
[12:28] life's journey amen whatever challenges
[12:30] we are facing he says faith knows no age
[12:33] limit or circumstance Faith knows one
[12:36] thing
[12:37] God said so and that settles it amen
[12:41] amen Faith rest upon the solid word of
[12:44] God
[12:46] amen amen hallelujah
[12:49] we're entering a season now where it's
[12:52] time for the adoption and placing amen
[12:54] all right yes we've been treated we've
[12:57] been trained yes right the Holy Ghost
[12:59] have led us through the word
[13:01] amen and while we were going through the
[13:03] word now remember there are seasons of
[13:05] your faith when you are teaching
[13:07] somebody something it does not mean that
[13:09] they understand it immediately
[13:11] learning all of this time but suddenly
[13:13] something clicks and they understand it
[13:15] amen it all comes together
[13:18] amen when the bride recognizes who she
[13:21] is yes hallelujah amen and what she is
[13:24] called for yes she will do the Greater
[13:27] Works yes yes this is the season
[13:30] now is the season amen
[13:33] amen so it's a time where Christ is
[13:36] coming now looking for Sons and
[13:38] Daughters of God you say looking for
[13:40] sons and daughters I thought we are the
[13:43] wife yes every wife must produce his own
[13:46] life
[13:48] you must produce the life of the Lord
[13:50] Jesus Christ you must bring forth the
[13:53] son
[13:54] it says here the prophet we realize that
[13:56] the own law that the son was born in a
[13:58] home and he was a son but he too to
[14:00] raise him and then when he was of age if
[14:03] he had been the right kind of son he was
[14:05] taken out put a Purple Rope on in his
[14:08] ceremony and adopted right we all know
[14:10] that
[14:12] and he says that's what now he's praying
[14:15] Prophet is praying and he's talking to
[14:18] God and he says that's what you're
[14:19] trying to do
[14:22] to this Full Gospel now we are the only
[14:25] people that really believe the Full
[14:26] Gospel amen that's why I put it in
[14:28] Brackets message people
[14:30] that's what you're trying to do to
[14:32] message people now
[14:34] to get them out to themselves somewhere
[14:37] along with you in faith
[14:42] to adopt them into the kingdom and to
[14:44] give them the right to go forth and to
[14:46] do the things that you did
[14:50] amen I think we need to remind ourselves
[14:53] of the things that Jesus did
[14:56] amen
[14:58] oh Hallelujah
[15:00] amen because God wants to get us alone
[15:03] with him
[15:04] God wants to adopt us into the kingdom
[15:06] and to give us the right to go forth
[15:10] amen the son as long as he was not
[15:12] adopted he did not have the right to use
[15:16] the father's name
[15:18] he did not have the authority to use the
[15:20] father's name but once he is adopted
[15:24] amen his name on the check he's signing
[15:27] the church he's as good as the father
[15:29] signing it
[15:31] amen are you ready for that adoption
[15:34] amen are you ready for that season of
[15:36] Faith amen we're all the working of our
[15:39] faith amen the word amen but there's got
[15:42] to be a manifestation rate
[15:44] and for reaping amen yes and right now
[15:48] we're preaching
[15:50] but it's a special class of people
[15:53] that's going to connect with it in this
[15:55] hour amen some are looking out they're
[15:57] gonna make the next buck
[15:59] amen some are looking amen where they
[16:02] gonna find the next chicken or the next
[16:04] lamb amen the next meal amen but we are
[16:07] looking to the Unseen we are pressing
[16:10] forward amen
[16:11] amen
[16:13] Hallelujah
[16:16] amen amen
[16:21] he says God is known by simple Faith by
[16:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:25] I think that's where we need to stop
[16:29] because we really need to get desperate
[16:31] with God and make sure that we have been
[16:33] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[16:36] amen we cannot go another second another
[16:39] step forward until we are certain that
[16:42] we have got the baptism of the Holy
[16:44] Ghost
[16:46] there are millions on the earth
[16:47] proclaiming to be Christians walking and
[16:50] saying that they're walking a Christian
[16:51] walk but they do not have the baptism of
[16:54] the Holy Ghost
[16:55] we do not want to be found in that same
[16:57] boat amen he says God in you
[17:01] thank you Lord we know the scripture
[17:03] that's it Emmanuel
[17:05] we called Emmanuel
[17:07] that means god
[17:11] Emmanuel
[17:15] but he wants to be
[17:19] in you
[17:21] and he says God in you truly brings you
[17:24] of God changes your name you know your
[17:28] nature represents your name the name
[17:30] represents your nature amen so when he
[17:33] changes your nature it's going to give
[17:34] you a new name
[17:36] God the Creator made all things and
[17:39] spoke the word into existence by his
[17:41] word that same Spirit In You
[17:46] now these are the kind of things we
[17:47] ought to meditate upon
[17:51] God the one that in the beginnings and
[17:53] let there be that same Spirit dwells in
[17:55] you and I
[17:58] am
[17:59] everything God says
[18:02] and there's nothing impossible amen amen
[18:05] amen
[18:07] Hallelujah
[18:10] the prophet was talking to a doctor one
[18:12] time and he
[18:15] the doctor said you know what I tried
[18:16] studying what you believe I studied it
[18:19] for four years and I come to the
[18:21] conclusion there's nothing to it
[18:22] the prophet says it depends on what you
[18:24] believe he says you've got the best
[18:26] x-ray machines amen you look through the
[18:29] human body and so forth and that's
[18:31] wonderful he said you're looking because
[18:33] you're taking of the tree of knowledge
[18:35] he says that tree was from the Garden of
[18:37] Eden
[18:40] the doctor couldn't make sense of what
[18:42] he was reading but he has the prophet
[18:43] breaking down and saying you by your
[18:45] science are eating from the tree that
[18:47] was in the Garden of Eden right
[18:51] he says but that was in the Garden of
[18:54] Eden and man's been eaten from the tree
[18:56] since Eden and it's got a limitation
[19:00] amen so the tree of knowledge has a
[19:02] limitation amen yes
[19:05] yes oh we can have the best education we
[19:08] can have the best jobs
[19:10] but that limited
[19:12] we are not satisfied with that
[19:14] amen
[19:16] I guarantee you if I paid you a million
[19:18] grand every month you'll never be happy
[19:20] you'll be the most miserable person on
[19:22] the face of the Earth right right some
[19:24] of you thinking that's impossible now
[19:29] amen
[19:31] he says it's got its limitation but the
[19:34] tree of faith of God is unlimited amen
[19:39] amen
[19:40] amen he says you believe scientists fire
[19:44] science can go and then when you can
[19:46] scant scientifically search it out
[19:49] anymore then step off and start
[19:51] believing from there on what is he
[19:54] saying you need to rocket launch
[19:55] yourself
[19:57] you need to step out into the unknown
[19:59] amen
[20:01] he said that's the way you will have to
[20:03] do it
[20:08] and if you want to take a step tonight
[20:09] amen amen
[20:11] amen amen
[20:13] amen let's leave all carnality amen
[20:16] let's leave all human reasoning amen
[20:18] let's step forward into what God is
[20:20] saying
[20:22] amen
[20:25] son he goes on to say that some are
[20:27] afraid to ask God something that they
[20:30] are bothering God
[20:31] would they request
[20:33] he says you can never exhaust God's love
[20:36] and mercy to you
[20:38] oh aren't you thankful for that
[20:40] because I need his love and I need his
[20:42] Mercy every day of my life how about you
[20:45] amen amen amen I need his love and his
[20:49] Mercy every day he says well I hate to
[20:51] bother you so much father
[20:56] amen
[20:57] not here's what he says he wants to be
[20:59] bothered that way
[21:06] even though he didn't want to entertain
[21:08] that sort of Phoenician woman he loved
[21:11] it when she begged him he loved it when
[21:13] the persistent Widow came yes
[21:16] he says he wants to be bothered that way
[21:19] he does don't never think that you could
[21:22] ever ask too much of God Amen
[21:26] amen
[21:29] I want you to stop now whatever you're
[21:32] believing God for
[21:34] if you had 100 belief I want you to add
[21:37] another zero
[21:39] and if you have enough Faith add another
[21:41] zero take it up another thousand million
[21:44] I'm not talking rents now but if you
[21:46] want that's what you're praying for then
[21:48] I pray you'll receive it amen I'm
[21:50] talking about the level of your faith
[21:52] take it from 10 to 100 take it from 100
[21:56] to a thousand percent
[21:58] amen
[22:00] thank you
[22:01] he says don't never think that you could
[22:03] ever ask God to ever ask too much of God
[22:09] I believe the scripture said you have
[22:11] not because you ask not yes and you ask
[22:14] not because you believe not and then you
[22:16] know the Bible goes on to say and even
[22:18] when you ask you ask a miss
[22:22] amen
[22:25] how many if you know what Oscar Miss
[22:26] means
[22:30] you ask without faith
[22:34] here the prophet goes on to say now
[22:38] he wants you us to ask and believe that
[22:40] our joy would be full
[22:44] right he wants you to ask abundantly
[22:51] ask for big things
[22:54] yes don't limit your faith to some
[22:57] little mustard seed or some love the
[23:00] scripture where Jesus Jesus is just
[23:02] trying to get your faith started there
[23:03] but we are not at the start anymore amen
[23:06] we are in the astronaut age amen we need
[23:09] to rocket launch yes
[23:11] amen
[23:13] he says don't limit your faith to some
[23:15] little mustard tree Seed Faith
[23:21] some go to the Lord Lord you know I have
[23:23] just got the faith enough
[23:25] the grain of a mustards
[23:28] no
[23:30] deal your favor
[23:32] amen how do you say how do I build my
[23:35] faith faith cometh by the hearing how
[23:38] much of time are you spending with the
[23:39] word yeah
[23:40] amen
[23:43] we've been speaking on the angel of the
[23:45] Lord
[23:46] we've been speaking about communing with
[23:49] angels where we will see in general
[23:51] visitation amen
[23:53] we can't do that with unbelief in our
[23:55] life right because while angels are yet
[23:58] to influence and guide us they are other
[24:01] Angels here as well called fallen angels
[24:04] known as demons they are also here to
[24:07] influence us how do they influence us
[24:09] through television through movies
[24:11] through media to things we are reading
[24:14] so there's a great war going on we're
[24:17] always talking about the white dog and
[24:19] the black dog
[24:21] look in your own life for the white dog
[24:23] and the black dog look every day in your
[24:25] life
[24:26] look at the phone because that's you
[24:29] know is what possesses you these days
