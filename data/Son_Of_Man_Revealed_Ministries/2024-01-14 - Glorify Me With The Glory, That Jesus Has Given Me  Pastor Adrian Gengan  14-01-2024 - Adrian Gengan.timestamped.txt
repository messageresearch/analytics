[3:33] the glory that Jesus has given me oh yes
[3:37] amen glorify me with the glory that
[3:40] Jesus has given me now as I read the
[3:45] scriptures I want you to be conscious of
[3:48] the fact that we are standing before the
[3:49] angel of God Amen we are standing in the
[3:52] presence of God the angel of God the
[3:54] great Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit
[3:56] is moved by faith amen and he wants to
[3:59] connect with your faith oh yes so ask
[4:01] yourself now what is my expectation amen
[4:05] and have I created the right atmosphere
[4:07] now for the word of God which is a seed
[4:09] to be swn in my heart amen so St John
[4:12] 17 the Bible reads from verse one these
[4:17] words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes
[4:20] to heaven and said father the hour is
[4:24] come glorify thy son that thy son Also
[4:28] may glorify thee
[4:30] amen and as thou has given him Power
[4:32] Over All
[4:34] Flesh that he should give eternal life
[4:36] to as many as thou has given him and
[4:39] this is eternal life that they may Know
[4:42] Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ
[4:45] whom thou has sent I have glorified thee
[4:49] on the earth I have finished the work
[4:51] which thou gavest me to
[4:53] do and now oh Father glorify thou me
[4:58] with thine own self
[5:00] with the glory which I had with thee
[5:03] before the world wars amen praise the
[5:06] Lord you may be seated the Lord had
[5:08] blessings to the reading of his
[5:10] word amen praise the Lord just before we
[5:14] get started into our message
[5:17] amen we know the prophet teaches us that
[5:20] Natural Things type spiritual especially
[5:22] when it comes to
[5:26] Israel amen especially when it comes to
[5:29] Israel the natural is typing the
[5:31] spiritual so we look this week and we
[5:34] see of all the countries in the world of
[5:37] all the Muslim
[5:39] nations that could have taken Israel to
[5:44] court to the
[5:48] icj why did South Africa take them there
[5:52] are so many Muslim countries surrounding
[5:55] Palestine why didn't any of them take
[5:59] Israel to to court
[6:01] amen
[6:03] so why South Africa is my
[6:05] [Music]
[6:07] question we see that South Africa has a
[6:09] part to play in end time
[6:13] prophecies so in moving the prophecy
[6:16] forward and moving the prophecies
[6:20] concerning Israel and the end times
[6:22] forward amen we ask ourselves a question
[6:25] does South Africa have a part to play in
[6:27] the prophecy concerning spiritual isra
[6:29] [Music]
[6:33] amen what is it about South Africa that
[6:35] the angel of God wanted brother brandham
[6:37] to come here especially to Durban amen
[6:42] amen last year we see there was attack
[6:44] on Israel on the 10th month of the
[6:46] seventh day they entered the New Year
[6:49] 5784 hundreds were taken hostage now
[6:52] Israel is engaged in Warfare with amas
[6:54] but amas is using the Palestinians as
[6:57] human Shields and they have hostages
[6:59] yes amen we know the Bible says in
[7:02] Matthew 11:12 that the Kingdom of Heaven
[7:06] suffered violence and the violent take
[7:08] it by
[7:10] force so I'm asking
[7:13] you we have entered the new year and we
[7:16] are engaged in spiritual warfare amen
[7:19] will South Africa arise in the spirit
[7:20] and be counted in the fight in the
[7:23] greatest battle ever
[7:26] fought will South Africa arise yes Amen
[7:29] in the spiritual warfare Amen in the
[7:32] greatest battle ever fought yes who will
[7:35] lead the attack I ask you Hallelujah who
[7:37] will God use could it be South
[7:42] Africa amen question to be asked amen
[7:47] you know what if we are not concerned
[7:48] about the things of God the Prophecies
[7:50] of God then I tell you it's okay to get
[7:54] a good
[7:55] job and to get a good
[7:57] house and to make your your life as
[7:59] comfortable as possible while you here
[8:02] on the earth do that do it with all
[8:05] diligence do it with all your might
[8:08] because that's all you're building for
[8:10] enjoy it while you can help us Lord but
[8:13] when your last breath is taken
[8:15] away and when you close your eyes in
[8:19] Sweet
[8:20] Death that'll be the
[8:22] end all your wealth will go to somebody
[8:25] else amen so what are we really looking
[8:28] for what are we really striving for amen
[8:32] surely it can't just be to live 70 80
[8:35] years and that's the
[8:37] End Amen but the word of God has been
[8:39] open to us so I'm asking you Believers
[8:42] of God and when I'm asking you I don't
[8:44] want you to forget that it's your duty
[8:46] to say Amen to the word of God Amen it's
[8:49] your duty to connect with the word of
[8:51] God amen amen my opening statements if
[8:54] you remember it I said the angel of God
[8:55] is here waiting to connect with faith
[8:58] how will he know you Faith by your
[9:00] response to the word amen amen so I'm
[9:04] asking you we are enter the new year we
[9:07] are engag in spiritual warfare in the
[9:08] greatest battle ever for who will stand
[9:11] up and be counted amen and who will lead
[9:13] the attack yes amen amen
[9:18] hallelujah so we see here that Jesus is
[9:21] saying glorify
[9:23] me with the glory I had with you before
[9:27] the world began
[9:31] amen we know Jesus prayed this
[9:34] prayer now Jesus Christ as a man on
[9:37] Earth his life was fixing to
[9:41] end and he knew the next step was to go
[9:43] to the
[9:44] Cross
[9:47] yes and we know that Jesus was the
[9:49] manifestation of the glory of God in
[9:52] human form amen somebody say amen amen
[9:54] amen so he comes to a junction point in
[9:58] his life
[10:00] he comes and he prays this prayer father
[10:02] glorify me with the glory that I had
[10:05] with you before the foundation of the
[10:07] world yes amen
[10:10] amen
[10:12] amen he had a successful life of
[10:15] ministry he healed the sick raised the
[10:20] dead he spoke to winds and waves he
[10:23] spoke to trees amen he spoke to all
[10:26] creation and they obeyed him but was
[10:29] looking for something more yes amen
[10:34] amen Jesus didn't say father I finished
[10:36] the word and that's it now take me
[10:38] home he's striving for something more
[10:42] amen he is looking for glory amen but he
[10:45] realizes there's no glory on the earth
[10:48] so he's asking the one that created all
[10:51] things and Jesus didn't bypass his
[10:54] theophany so he had knowledge of the
[10:56] form he was before the foundation of the
[10:58] world and he's saying father you have
[11:00] glorified me on the earth now you have
[11:02] expressed your glory through me but I
[11:05] have one
[11:08] request amen
[11:11] amen glorify me with what with thine own
[11:16] self put that scripture amen he says
[11:19] there with thine own self there's no
[11:22] greater glory we can attain than the
[11:25] glory of the king
[11:27] Almighty that's be our ultimate goal our
[11:30] ultimate
[11:31] desire amen praise the Lord amen Romans
[11:34] 8:17 we see it says now if we are
[11:37] children then we are a HS of God coair
[11:39] with Christ if indeed we share any
[11:41] sufferings in order that we may also
[11:44] share in his glory right so there's no
[11:47] glory without suffering there's no glory
[11:50] without
[11:51] trials amen if you look in the natural
[11:55] anybody hoping to achieve glory in a
[11:57] certain field a certain area in their
[12:00] life they become the master of that
[12:04] field and and glory is the end result if
[12:08] they're an athlete glory is the end
[12:10] result there's much suffering through a
[12:13] training there's many lonely hours spent
[12:17] While others are enjoying life they make
[12:19] sacrifices amen they suffer for the
[12:21] cause why they are after glory amen oh
[12:25] yes Lord now if they can be so diligent
[12:28] in the natural What About Us in the
[12:30] spirit amen amen are we really looking
[12:33] for glory amen amen amen praise the Lord
[12:39] amen now 2 Corinthians 3:18 reads this
[12:44] but we all with open face beholding as
[12:48] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[12:50] changed into the same image from glory
[12:54] to glory amen even as by the spirit of
[12:57] the Lord the spirit of the Lord is the
[13:00] Holy
[13:01] Ghost I want to slow that down and read
[13:03] it again we all with open face beholding
[13:07] as in a glass the glory so we are
[13:10] looking at the glory of God that's what
[13:12] this verse is telling us we are
[13:14] beholding the glory of
[13:16] God right we are looking at the glory of
[13:19] God he says as we are looking it at it
[13:22] we are being
[13:23] changed into the same image amen we are
[13:26] being changed into what we are looking
[13:28] at Oh Yes Lord From glory to glory amen
[13:32] so I ask you what are you looking at
[13:34] hallelujah what is before you amen amen
[13:37] what are what are you focusing on yes
[13:39] Lord amen what are you reading yes Lord
[13:42] what are you placing before you as an
[13:44] image you are being changed into that
[13:47] you know recently I was reading I think
[13:48] it was last week or
[13:50] somewhere just to show you in Ty the
[13:53] spirit of somebody can possess people
[13:55] that even after they are gone they can
[13:57] still have an influence on the Earth
[13:59] year after year they have this contest
[14:02] called impersonations of Elvis Presley
[14:04] you must have seen
[14:06] them why year after year how long ago
[14:09] did he
[14:11] die why is it Spirit still influencing
[14:13] people that that man people that didn't
[14:16] even meet him that were not influenced
[14:18] by his music people still impersonate
[14:21] him what is that it is a spirit yes amen
[14:26] a spirit that has possessed people yeah
[14:28] amen so we are looking at the image that
[14:31] people are be placing before them and
[14:33] they are being changed into that
[14:35] image I'm reminded now about a scripture
[14:38] that says that this Antichrist spirit is
[14:41] sitting in the temple of God making
[14:43] himself God presenting himself as God
[14:46] and as people are beholding His Image
[14:48] they are being changed into His Image
[14:50] that's right amen that's why the the the
[14:53] daughters are no better than the mother
[14:55] yes yes they are beholding the image
[14:59] and that image is being passed down from
[15:01] mother to daughter amen but we thank God
[15:04] that our image is being passed down from
[15:06] father to son fathers to daughters amen
[15:09] and we are coming into His Image whether
[15:12] we like it or not we are coming to his
[15:13] image because that is prophecy whether
[15:16] you are prepared for it or not we are
[15:17] coming into his
[15:19] image L amen God is moving the wheels
[15:22] forward now the wheels of Prophecy are
[15:25] moving forward amen I want to read amen
[15:29] praise the
[15:31] Lord I want to read in Exodus 33 and:
[15:37] 18 he talking about the glory of God
[15:40] here and I want you to conscious what
[15:42] Moses is saying and what our lord Jesus
[15:45] is saying so in Exodus 33 and: 18 it
[15:48] says and now Moses is telling the
[15:51] Lord and he said I beseech thee show me
[15:55] thy glory amen wow
[16:01] amen this man had seen the glory of
[16:04] [Music]
[16:06] God he spoke and flies came up to
[16:10] existence he spoke and frogs came into
[16:13] existence he threw down the rod and he
[16:16] turned into a serpent he saw the mighty
[16:19] Nile turn to blood yes he saw Locust and
[16:24] Nets and flies come across plag have to
[16:28] play strike
[16:31] Egypt you saw how God had delivered them
[16:33] with a mighty
[16:36] hand this man saw the glory
[16:39] [Music]
[16:41] Cloud this man saw the pillar of fire in
[16:44] a
[16:45] bush but he was not satisfied amen yeah
[16:50] are you satisfied with the
[16:52] manifestations you have
[16:54] seen or can you come to a place show me
[16:58] your your glory amen thank you Lord but
[17:01] I want to show you how Jesus switched it
[17:03] up a little
[17:05] higher Moses says Show Me Your
[17:09] Glory and he
[17:11] said I will make all my goodness pass
[17:15] before thee Now watch how God is going
[17:18] to reveal his
[17:20] glory I will make my goodness pass
[17:23] before thee so part of the glory is the
[17:26] goodness of God hallelujah amen and he
[17:28] says I will proclaim the name of the
[17:30] Lord before thee part of the glory is
[17:32] when his name is proclaimed am and in
[17:35] knowah the age has the name been
[17:36] restored back back to the church amen
[17:39] but through Malachi 4:5 and 6 through
[17:41] Revelation 10:7 the name of the Lord has
[17:44] been restored back to the
[17:49] church so is that his
[17:51] glory
[17:54] yes now watch also grace and mercy and I
[17:57] will be gracious to to whom I will be
[17:59] gracious and show Mercy on whom I will
[18:01] show Mercy but is that what really Moses
[18:04] is asking
[18:06] for what are those attributes of his
[18:12] glory so now here God tells him thou can
[18:15] not see my
[18:16] face for there shall no man see me and
[18:19] live and the Lord said behold there is a
[18:21] place by me and thou shalt stand upon a
[18:23] rock and it shall come to pass while my
[18:26] glory passes by that I will put the in
[18:28] the Cliff of The Rock and will cover
[18:30] thee with my hand while I pass by and I
[18:33] will take away mine hand and thou shalt
[18:35] see the back see my back Parts but my
[18:37] face shall not be
[18:40] seen so we know that Moses saw the back
[18:43] parts of
[18:44] God but I want you to notice again what
[18:48] Moses is asking for Show Me Your Glory
[18:51] and what Jesus is asking
[18:53] for you can desire to see the glory of
[18:56] God or you can come come to a place and
[18:59] say glorify me with your own self amen
[19:03] yes then what am I really telling you
[19:05] you become the glory of God yes amen God
[19:08] expresses his glory through you yes
[19:11] amen amen we haven't come up so
[19:15] far in algebra and the statue of the
[19:17] perfect man to be preaching baby
[19:19] [Music]
[19:21] stuff this is the image that God wants
[19:23] to manifest on the
[19:25] earth amen hallelujah
[19:28] praise the Lord
[19:34] amen now the glory of God we find here
[19:37] in
[19:38] Genesis just to background it a little
[19:40] [Music]
[19:44] bit we see the glory of God is coming on
[19:47] the
[19:47] [Music]
[19:49] earth the earth is dark it's void now
[19:53] what's your situation in your life if
[19:55] your situation in your life is dark and
[19:57] void and formless no
[20:02] purpose then your life is gloomy and
[20:04] dark like genesis
[20:09] 1:2 so the glory of God is descending
[20:11] Upon A Dark Void formless
[20:13] [Music]
[20:16] Earth but when the glory of God descends
[20:19] it has transforming power amen amen the
[20:23] Bible says the spirit of God moved upon
[20:25] the waters
[20:27] am but the glory of God is going to be
[20:30] manifest upon the Earth and it has
[20:32] transforming power it has transforming
[20:35] power to Resto it back to the original
[20:37] condition
[20:39] amen nothing can come into the glory of
[20:42] God and be the same again amen if you
[20:46] walk into church week after week and you
[20:49] go out the same way then you have not
[20:51] experienced a glory of God the glory of
[20:53] God is transforming power the glory of
[20:56] God will change your life the reason
[20:58] being people don't want the glory of God
[21:00] to affect their lives and influence
[21:02] their lives therefore you can walk into
[21:04] service and go out of service the same
[21:06] way you're doing it out of ritual you're
[21:09] doing it out of religious ceremony but
[21:11] when you once allow the Shak of Glory of
[21:13] God to say Lord come and fill me with
[21:16] your glory Lord you can never be the
[21:18] same again you can never think the same
[21:21] again your very life is governed by the
[21:23] glory and the presence of God
[21:26] amen amen amen
[21:29] hallelujah thank you Lord so either it
[21:31] dies in his presence or it
[21:35] lives and that's why the prophet says
[21:37] it's a dangerous thing to come into the
[21:40] presence of
[21:41] God because e it's the house of judgment
[21:44] or it's a House of
[21:46] Mercy amen so people can be getting
[21:50] eternal life being saved or people can
[21:53] be sealing their faith by rejecting the
[21:55] gospel yes two things can happen there
[21:59] so you see in the glory of God can be
[22:02] either life or
[22:05] death amen praise the Lord hallelujah so
[22:09] if amen if there is no original life
[22:12] there tied back to predestination from
[22:14] before the foundation of the world and
[22:16] he dies yeah if you have no original SE
[22:19] Gene of God within you that's tied in
[22:22] the back part of God's mind amen then
[22:25] you will
[22:26] die but if you have representation if
[22:29] you are Original Seed amen if you have
[22:32] original life in you amen then you will
[22:34] live in his presence amen you will live
[22:36] in his
[22:38] glory so we find that if you read that
[22:41] chapter there you'll see the Earth and
[22:43] everything in it he being transformed by
[22:45] the glory of God as God says Let There
[22:47] Be The Glory of God is
[22:49] transforming the glory of God is
[22:51] creating yes the glory of God Amen is
[22:54] moving in Fish Life animal life bird
[22:57] life
[23:02] thank you Lord it took 6,000 years or 6
[23:05] days whichever you want to look at it
[23:08] for God for the earth to be filled with
[23:10] the glory of God and when God is
[23:12] finished with it on the sixth day here
[23:14] stands a man clothed in the glory of God
[23:17] a man in the image and likeness of
[23:23] God when God is finished with anything
[23:27] his glory is manifest and the highest
[23:30] form of creation he standing in the
[23:32] glory of God Amen he represents the
[23:34] glory of God on the
[23:35] [Music]
[23:37] earth I'm showing you where we fell from
[23:41] I'm showing you how God ended Creation
[23:44] With His glory being revealed in a
[23:46] man if that's how the alpha started
[23:49] that's how the Omega will start and I
[23:51] tell you the Omega what didn't finish in
[23:53] William brandham even though the glory
[23:55] of God was manifested through William
[23:57] brandham he was the first wave shei that
[24:00] was waved before the people testifying
[24:02] that many more Sons and Daughters of God
[24:05] are coming for to Life come on give God
[24:09] praise somebody say
[24:11] [Applause]
[24:12] glory amen he showed us that it can be
[24:15] done the glory of God can be manifest
[24:17] through a man through a man born of sex
[24:20] amen through a man amen hallelujah even
[24:23] with no education God is not looking for
[24:25] those kind of things but God is looking
[24:27] for your to will

[24:33] with anything it shines in his glory of
[24:36] God man is standing on the earth as a
[24:38] god of the
[24:41] earth so Moses here he's saying show me

[29:57] if you want me to preach under the
[29:58] anointing because under the anointing it
[30:01] can be 10 minutes but if I stick to my
[30:06] notes it could be longer
[30:09] right Hallelujah it could be longer but
[30:12] you know when the anointing strikes and
[30:14] the message is received and the people's
[30:16] Faith have come to a level then we can
[30:18] close the
[30:19] service then there's nothing more to be
[30:22] said but allow the work of the Holy
[30:23] Spirit to come now amen hallelujah
[30:26] praise the Lord amen so we are praying
[30:29] that Lord glorify us with thyself not
[30:32] looking for manifestations only not
[30:34] looking for signs only but we want you
[30:37] yourself oh God glorify me with
[30:40] thyself
[30:43] amen oh yes Lord now with all the
[30:46] Mysteries that we have known all the
[30:49] Mysteries that have been revealed to us
[30:50] with all the things we have preached
[30:52] through the years we have come to this
[30:54] season in our time we have come to this
[30:56] Junction of time
[30:58] amen where all that is left is for God
[31:01] to reveal his glory through his
[31:04] [Music]
[31:06] body
[31:08] yes can any one of us deny that it was
[31:11] Glory was fully expressed through
[31:12] William
[31:14] brandom as Luke
[31:17] 17 a son of man revealing the son of man
[31:20] can any of us deny it none of us can
[31:23] deny it we saw the signs we saw the
[31:26] evidence yes how many of us can with the
[31:28] shity say that we have seen the glory of
[31:31] God manifest through I'm talking about
[31:33] the entire body we haven't seen it but
[31:36] it said we have come to the climax
[31:39] now we are coming
[31:43] now yes with all the Mysteries we have
[31:46] known all the things being preached now
[31:47] is the time now is the season and all
[31:50] that left is for God to reveal his glory
[31:52] display his glory through his
[31:55] bride until his glory comes we are
[31:57] incomplete yes we may know all the
[32:02] Mysteries come on now I want to type it
[32:04] again so you don't get lost Jesus
[32:06] performed signs wonders Miracles there
[32:08] was no one could touch his
[32:10] life did he was he satisfied show me thy
[32:15] Glory anoint me with your glory Lord
[32:18] what am I saying if we until we come
[32:21] into His glory we are
[32:25] incomplete so I pray should be the same
[32:28] glorify your people oh godu glorify us
[32:31] Lord Jesus the children of Israel had
[32:34] one thing in common what was
[32:36] that they had the glory of God this was
[32:39] a covenant people they had a I will
[32:42] Covenant from Jehovah God himself but
[32:44] the sign of the glory of the glory
[32:47] Covenant was what
[32:50] circumcision that's why even David could
[32:52] say who is this uncircumcised
[32:55] Philistine that will defile the armies
[32:57] of the Living
[32:58] God Abraham was given sign of
[33:01] circumcision it was their Covenant with
[33:04] God Amen that was their Glory if I could
[33:07] say it that
[33:09] way they had to be
[33:16] circumcised
[33:18] amen now
[33:20] circumcision is a sign it's a type of
[33:23] the Holy
[33:25] Ghost but there's a Covenant people that
[33:28] God has and it's not the whole of the
[33:31] Christian world that has the sign of
[33:34] circumcision some think they have
[33:38] it because when the Holy Ghost fell amen
[33:41] they ran with one part of it they ran
[33:44] with one manifestation of it and they
[33:46] didn't wait yes they didn't carry long
[33:51] enough amen trying to explain to you
[33:53] that when something starts in its
[33:55] infancy it grows to to its full Glory
[33:58] Hallelujah but when something starts at
[34:00] the root on its infancy and there comes
[34:03] the speaking in tongues and the
[34:04] manifestations that is not the full
[34:06] Glory
[34:08] yes you got to wait for it to grow
[34:12] amen amen praise the Lord so some went
[34:15] went out oza street amen some went out
[34:19] with Luther's message that was a holy
[34:21] ghost Falling come on that was the Holy
[34:23] Ghost falling revealing
[34:25] justification the Holy Ghost fell again
[34:27] in Wesley's day revealing amen
[34:29] sanctification yes then it was the
[34:31] outpouring of the gifts but they didn't
[34:34] [Music]
[34:36] wait they ran for the gifts but there's
[34:39] a group of people amen who under the
[34:42] messenger I've Waited For The Giver of
[34:44] the gifts Hallelujah yes Lord thank you
[34:48] Jesus thank you
[34:50] Lord so let me ask you what determines
[34:53] the quality of your
[34:55] existence
[34:59] what determines the quality of Our Lives
[35:01] if it's not the glory of God the
[35:04] anointing of
[35:06] God maybe you ask yourself now what what
[35:09] Glory do I carry what glory of God do I
[35:11] carry in my life Lord reveal to me what
[35:13] Glory what level of Glory what level of
[35:16] anointing do I carry in my
[35:20] life if your life has no glory then your
[35:24] existence is no different from an animal
[35:31] what made Adam different
[35:33] from animal
[35:37] world the glory of
[35:39] [Music]
[35:42] God by staying behind the word come on
[35:46] now when he left the word what happened
[35:48] did he lose his glory
[35:52] yes amen I ask you again what determines
[35:56] the quality of your
[35:58] existence what determines the quality of
[36:01] your life it's the glory of God
[36:04] Amen if your life has no glory we are no
[36:07] better than an animal and this I'm
[36:09] taking from the prophet of God for those
[36:11] of you who think I'm calling you an
[36:12] animal amen but I know there's nobody
[36:14] here without the glory of God Amen
[36:16] you'll find that in the quote there
[36:17] question and answers on Genesis you take
[36:19] the Holy Spirit off a man is lower than
[36:22] the animal you see I was nice and I said
[36:24] you're an animal the prophet is saying
[36:26] you're lower than an
[36:28] animal this is in question and answers
[36:30] you take the Holy Spirit off of a man he
[36:33] is lower than the animal he's worse than
[36:36] the
[36:39] animal so what determines the
[36:42] quality the Holy Ghost
[36:45] Glory therefore you find people doing
[36:48] what they do no Holy Ghost you find a
[36:50] man who's addicted to things living in
[36:52] the world lasting after things he's got
[36:55] no glory you can't tell tell me the Holy
[36:57] Ghost is living in that body no that man
[37:00] needs to die to
[37:01] self that's another thing we want to
[37:04] touch on here
[37:05] now what was Jesus saying I have reached
[37:08] one level of Glory because you have
[37:10] expressed your glory through me but in
[37:12] order for me to reach the glory of
[37:15] anointing you with your your own self I
[37:19] got to go to the
[37:22] cross the next level of
[37:24] Glory awaits
[37:27] beneath de to
[37:31] self on the other side of De to self is
[37:34] the glory of God Amen how many want to
[37:37] die to self amen welcome to my funeral
[37:41] I'm dying to myself that's why Paul says
[37:44] I Die
[37:46] daily what was he after the glory but in
[37:50] order to experience the glory on the
[37:52] other side of death to self is the glory
[37:54] of God how many of us are willing to lay
[37:58] down and say Lord For Your Glory I am
[38:01] willing to die to self amen here in
[38:05] another quote in from the beginning it
[38:07] wasn't so paragraph 17 it says man
[38:09] perverts things that's what man does a
[38:12] man in his Fallen state is worse than
[38:14] animal do you believe that it proves it
[38:17] man will do things that an animal won't
[38:19] do there is man now man is not muscles
[38:22] you say oh he's a man I've seen men that
[38:25] weigh 200 lb didn't have an ounce of man
[38:28] about them man is not measured by his
[38:31] muscles that's a
[38:33] beast man is measured by
[38:37] character a man is a man by character
[38:42] that's the reason Jesus was the greatest
[38:44] man that ever
[38:46] lived there was nothing that could ever
[38:48] measure to his character or compare with
[38:51] him he was a real man
[38:54] hallelujah amen you think you real man
[38:57] be like
[38:58] Jesus Jesus is the real
[39:03] man
[39:06] amen the Bible says husbands love your
[39:08] wives even as Jesus the real man love
[39:11] the
[39:16] church so what makes our existence
[39:18] valuable the glory that we
[39:20] carry the glory that we carry true
[39:23] wealth is not measured by what a man
[39:25] possesses true wealth is is amen
[39:28] measured by what we possess by the share
[39:30] of Glory that we carry so therefore amen
[39:34] hallelujah this message came to bring us
[39:36] to glorification
[39:39] amen the message of the hour is to bring
[39:41] us to our final
[39:43] Glory people may be thinking hey what's
[39:45] happening no move I telling you the
[39:47] message of the hour is going to take you
[39:49] to your final Glory stay with the
[39:51] message of the hour it's the message of
[39:53] Truth in this
[39:55] day this m message amen can make us end
[39:58] partakers of his glory amen because if
[40:00] we don't come to Glory I'm saying it
[40:02] again we are nothing we can do so many
[40:04] things in life we can preach we can
[40:06] dance we can sing but if there's no
[40:08] glory attached to it there's no blessing
[40:10] to it many people sing but there's no
[40:12] glory to it no anointing to it many
[40:15] people preach but there's no anointing
[40:16] to
[40:19] it amen so what gives value to preaching
[40:22] is the glory of God that accompanies the
[40:24] preaching amen what value to singing the
[40:27] glory of God that accompanies the
[40:29] singing what gives glory to music the
[40:32] glory of God that accompanies the
[40:36] music so if the glory of God doesn't
[40:38] accompany any of those things we are
[40:40] doing it according to religious form
[40:42] because the glory of God didn't descend
[40:47] upon Cain's
[40:51] sacrifice but what accompanied the glory
[40:54] was the able sacrifice
[40:57] amen praise the Lord
[41:01] amen so the glory of God in our lives
[41:04] must be our Pursuit the glory of God in
[41:07] our life must be the reason for our
[41:09] existence amen don't say now make your
[41:12] promise to a girl oh I only live for
[41:15] you for your precious love I will climb
[41:18] the highest
[41:19] mountain For Your Precious Love I will
[41:22] swim the deepest
[41:25] sea
[41:29] amen For Your Precious
[41:34] Love I will swim across the deepest the
[41:37] widest
[41:37] [Music]
[41:39] river
[41:41] Hallelujah but he don't mean it
[41:44] amen praise the
[41:48] Lord after they get
[41:50] married they can't even climb the stairs
[41:52] for
[41:53] you they want to climb mountains
[41:59] after they get married they can't even
[42:00] cross the street for you how they going
[42:02] to cross an
[42:04] ocean amen praise the
[42:08] Lord
[42:09] Glory will be the end result of this
[42:13] bride
[42:17] amen nobody reaches Glory at the
[42:19] beginning I'm saying it again glory is
[42:21] the end result to anything we said
[42:23] whether you're an athlete studying doing
[42:25] an assignment you look at Noah Abraham
[42:28] Moses the glory didn't come when Noah
[42:30] first started building the ark the glory
[42:32] came at the latter end hallah Glory
[42:35] didn't come amen
[42:37] hallelujah when Abraham left his
[42:39] father's house the glory came at the end
[42:42] when his body was changed and he they
[42:44] gave birth to a
[42:46] son Glory comes at the end and we are
[42:50] living at the End
[42:54] Amen Hallelujah amen hallelujah turn to
[42:58] your neighbor and say you a
[43:00] Believer say how about you say amen
[43:03] amen that's what believers do come on
[43:06] now amen
[43:08] hallelujah amen praise the Lord I
[43:11] promise you I'll end very shortly amen
[43:14] but you got to pull on the gift
[43:16] otherwise I told you if I don't e the
[43:18] Highlight then you'll wait for the day
[43:20] of redemption
[43:22] now amen praise the Lord so glory is the
[43:27] final result after the pain after the
[43:29] suffering even Jesus we see after 3 and
[43:32] 1 half years Ministry he suffered he
[43:34] endured but the cross would bring him to
[43:35] his final glory to be clothed with the
[43:37] glory he had to with the father at the
[43:40] beginning now Jesus was in a flesh body
[43:42] and Jesus body had
[43:45] limitations some of you say no yes Jesus
[43:49] body was aging they thought he was 50
[43:51] years old his body was aging and to
[43:55] prove it it when they hurt him he bled
[43:59] when they whipped him he
[44:00] bled so his body had limitations amen
[44:04] the body was subject to death but Jesus
[44:07] was longing for
[44:09] glorification
[44:14] amen and the Bible says that we are
[44:16] groaning within ourselves in fact all
[44:18] creation is groaning for what our
[44:21] glorification amen
[44:24] amen the souls under the altar are
[44:27] crying how long how long what they are
[44:29] crying for
[44:31] glorification the Saints in the sixth
[44:33] Dimension they are there in a temporal
[44:35] body but they are crying for
[44:40] glorification you say h you making that
[44:42] up I'm not making it up it's you who
[44:44] don't understand
[44:46] things didn't brother brandom tell them
[44:49] where is Jesus I want to see Jesus he
[44:53] wasn't happy being in a theop body Jesus
[44:55] was in a glorified body so when he's
[44:57] saying I want to see Jesus he is saying
[45:00] I'm clothed now with a theophonic body
[45:02] but I want to be glorified so that I can
[45:04] also see
[45:09] Jesus you see that's why our preaching
[45:11] must also be powerful to make people

[54:17] want to say Lord glorify me with thine
[54:19] own self amen by God's grace amen we
[54:23] have added and added re
[54:25] I'm closing now these are my closing
[54:27] remarks through the years we've added
[54:29] Revelation upon Revelation we've
[54:31] preached it by Revelation there was a
[54:34] season we preached Revelation 108 to1 by
[54:36] Revelation am we don't need to amen we
[54:39] didn't need to preach Revelation 10:7 by
[54:42] Revelation because it was already
[54:44] finished am you understand what I'm
[54:47] saying it was already manifest on the
[54:49] earth there was no denying that William
[54:51] Brandon was Revelation 10:7 there was no
[54:53] denying that William Brandon was m
[54:55] 4:5 so we didn't need to preach it in
[54:57] Revelation
[55:00] form but the bride needed to come to her
[55:03] position so we were preaching that in
[55:05] Revelation form that after the ministry
[55:08] of Revelation 10:7 comes the ministry of
[55:10] Revelation 108 to1 so for years we labor
[55:13] to tell the church you are John you are
[55:15] to take the book you are to eat the
[55:17] [Music]
[55:19] book but you know both Revelation and
[55:22] manifestation is a thing that can't be
[55:24] manufactured
[55:26] because who is it that give revelation
[55:28] God who is it that brings the
[55:29] manifestation God so there's two things
[55:32] you can't bring before its time that's
[55:34] Revelation and manifestation am thank
[55:38] you Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[55:41] so we've added Revelation upon
[55:43] Revelation amen hallelujah and we were
[55:47] what were we doing all the time while we
[55:48] were preaching it in Revelation 4 we
[55:50] were saying Amen to the word of God and
[55:52] who are standing back and watching all
[55:54] of this the angel of God what saying
[55:56] these people it's not yet time for the
[55:58] manifestation but here I'm presenting
[56:00] the Revelation and they are amening the
[56:02] word of
[56:06] God while we are being built while we
[56:09] were being built into the statue of a
[56:10] perfect man amen hallelujah things start
[56:13] to change around us things didn't change
[56:16] overnight you went through a journey
[56:19] amen you went through a suffering you
[56:21] went through a dying to self you went
[56:23] through a deep journey in your life
[56:25] and you come now to this point and
[56:26] Junction in your life amen amen where
[56:30] things will not just happen overnight if
[56:32] anything happens you've got to work for
[56:33] it you've got to suffer for it because
[56:35] if we share his glory we must suffer
[56:37] with him
[56:40] amen but all this time there was an
[56:42] angel watching us respond to the word
[56:44] how we were building Upon Our Most Holy
[56:46] Faith Revelation upon Revelation upon
[56:49] Revelation upon revelation we Rejoice
[56:51] with the revelation of the word but now
[56:53] has come the time for the manifestation
[56:56] amen we must stand up and be counted we
[56:59] have been called for such a time as
[57:01] this amen praise the
[57:07] Lord so in order for you to perform Mark
[57:12] 16 you can't perform Mark 16 if the
[57:15] glory is not within
[57:17] you the glory must be within you first
[57:21] in order for the glory to flow out of
[57:23] you the anointing has to be within you
[57:26] first in order for the anointing to flow
[57:28] out of you yes no spring can give water
[57:31] if there's no water within
[57:34] it so the angel is leading us amen
[57:38] hallelujah the angel has been leading us
[57:40] all this time Jesus defined it as
[57:43] glorify me with thine own self he does
[57:45] did not say glorify me with your
[57:47] goodness that is of a different kind of
[57:49] Glory you see Jesus didn't say glorify
[57:53] me with your goodness he says glorify me
[57:56] with thine own self that's a different
[57:58] kind of Glory his goodness is a
[57:59] different kind of
[58:02] glory
[58:04] amen Pentecost settled for the gifts
[58:08] we've settled for The Giver of the gifts
[58:10] thank
[58:11] you they missed the person Jesus said I
[58:15] have finished the work that you have
[58:16] given me I've healed the sick I've
[58:19] raised the dead I've raised a man who
[58:21] was dead 4 days what can be more
[58:23] glorious than that
[58:25] Jesus tells you what's more glorious
[58:27] glorify me with
[58:29] thyself the angel is leading us as we
[58:32] are climaxing to the point of we shall
[58:34] be changed if we miss these
[58:37] steps to glorification you Miss the
[58:40] message if you miss the message you miss
[58:43] the
[58:44] Rapture Sons and Daughters of God are
[58:46] coming to maturity ready to answer
[58:48] Creations grown you have to have his
[58:50] glory first before others can experience
[58:53] the effects of the glory
[58:55] yes
[58:57] amen what is the essence of his glory
[59:00] the essence is his character his nature
[59:02] you can't hide that you can't tell me
[59:03] you're carrying the nature the the glory
[59:06] of God and then his nature is
[59:08] different amen so those are the telltale
[59:10] signs
[59:12] amen God's agenda now is not to give you
[59:15] some gift to make you puffed
[59:18] up God's agenda now is to glorify
[59:21] himself through you because you're a
[59:23] trained son you're a mature son you know
[59:25] how to handle the glory you know how to
[59:27] handle the anointing you won't take
