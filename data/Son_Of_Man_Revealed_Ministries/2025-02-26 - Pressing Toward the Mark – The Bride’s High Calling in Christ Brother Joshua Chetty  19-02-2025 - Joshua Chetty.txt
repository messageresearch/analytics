am we ask it now in Jesus name giving reverence to your Holy Spirit amongst us amen and amen amen praise be to God amen amen amen I greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and I was just thinking uh I was driving to my house and I've seen this Branch from a tree from one of the Ed edges edges it was broken down by the monkeys and within a day or two it withed it's withering away there's no life in it you know I'm thinking because it's just like the Shar at one time they had life yes but now that the life is gone to the grain amen and the Shu has pulled away yeah when it's pulled away from the original amen then there's no life there amen so the life can only be in the original amen and those that are part of the original you you got to abide in the vine to have life amen you got to draw from the vine amen you got to be part but if you pulled out there's no life you'll wither away amen amen that's what brings the separation between man and God Amen that's what sin brings sin is unbelief and sin brings the separation it brings spiritual death amen so if you're not abiding in the word it brings forth spiritual deaths amen there's no life that's why you can't see the any any product you can't see it producing the fruit amen and the fruit is Christ amen so you got your Bibles we sent tonight to the book of Philippians read the book of Philippians 3:14 coincidentally the first time I ever exalted or ever took the Bible to say something I was called to preach I was in I think I was in Stand n or grade 11 or 12 and it was in this house meeting and this was the scripture so Philippians 3:14 it says I press towards the mark for the price of the eye calling of God in Christ Jesus amen I I press toward the mark amen for the price of the ey calling of God in Christ Jesus amen so it's a pressing towards this Mark amen amen for what for the price yes of what of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus yes amen and just before you SE be seated with 1 Peter 2:9 read 1 Peter 2:9 says but ye are a chosen generation yes am a royal priesthood an holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Lights amen you may be seated amen so that already telling you if you are chosen is telling you already you were predestinated M it's already speaking about election amen you had to be elected to be in the royal priesthood yes and royal priesthood had to come by birth amen you have to be B birthed into this royalty amen you have to be birthed into this peculiar people you have to be birth it to be this holy nation amen not your natural birth it had to come by the new birth amen but Paul is saying in in Philippians he's pressing toward I press toward the mark of for the price of of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and we know that the bride is the word manifested amen amen and she will come in this hour in this hour amen into perfect harmony with the groom am yes amen that's the ey calling amen and the final prize is when we come into fullness when Christ is fully manifested in his bride and we come into full Redemption yes amen amen and it couldn't happen in any other age until it come to the age of adoption because this is the hour where she is coming into Perfection amen amen because we find that every age was manifesting an attribute amen it was manifesting an attribute of God yes because there was walking in the Faith of Christ there was walking in the virtue of Christ amen into godliness into Temperance all of Christ walking to Patient into the patience of Christ walking to brotherly kindness amen but in this age we can bypass every age manifested a little bit in part in part in part yes but in the final hour Amen in this final age yes for us to come into Perfection it means we have to manifest from Faith virtue knowledge all these things we can't bypass those things but it's already there it was being formed but the Perfection was left until the edstone comes down amen it was left for the final parts yes but for us to come into the final part first we have to come into the new birth amen amen and how how we come because why we were chosen already Yes by election amen we once were walking in darkness but now we are called out other Darkness Into His Marvelous Light what happened it was a shout that came forth amen amen it was a shout that brought it was the evening time when the shout came forth it was the evening time light amen amen and why speaking about evening time because in evening time A Love Affair happens between Rebecca and Isaac amen where it was in the evening time when this love of fair takes place it had to be in evening time and in the evening time a union takes place between the bride and the bridegroom amen and therefore the world will know nothing about it because now she is shut in with him am amen it's a private affair yes you could come and meet him outside but in the bedroom oh in the privacy of his bedroom it's only him and the bride nobody else is allow there amen amen no matter how much you want to shout no matter how much you want to say that you worship God no matter how much you want to profess Christianity no matter how much you profess to be a Christian but as long as you are not elected to be part of the inside the of the Bride then you cannot come into the privacy of the invisible Union amen amen but he says but yeah are a chosen generation amen a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness amen into his marvelous life amen and 2 Peter 1:4 says whereby we whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises amen that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature amen having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so we are called to perfection in his hour and we are pressing toward the mark for the price of the eye calling yeah but when you was in Amnesia you was living like every other Mortal being on the earth and walking in darkness like every other person on the earth yes walking after the lust of the flesh but now that you are called into the Glorious lights yes amen and you are coming to this Union where now the word is being formed in you amen where you are becoming one with the word yes you are becoming so much like him that the world in this hour we coming to the hour now when the world will mistake you for Jesus Christ amen I'm talking about your characteristics your life and the manifestations of Christ amen because now it is no longer now the literal word just the WR word it's a manifested word amen amen just like in the Old Testament when they were reading the scriptures but the written the manifested word came and took the written word it took the manifested word to bring out light into the written words amen and just like that in this hour it's the one that will walk out of the scriptures amen that will manifest the word that will show light to the written word that will bring life because the Bible says the let it kill it but the spirit give it life amen because what what's come down it's the Holy Ghost come down in this hour hallelujah it's the holy ghost that bring this word if the Holy Ghost says I'll run this Trail again it's the holy ghost that taken this message around the world Amen to the jungles to the Amazon to the mountains to different countries to the highlands Amen to different tribes and Nations how did it happen not the work of a man but the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah a supernatural message and it's for a peculiar people it's for the chosen generation amen hallelujah amen many people can read the same scriptures that you read yes but it's only those that come to the knowledge of the church that now are now striving towards the mark of the price of the eye calling yes because why they know now they they not like every other human being yes they're not like every other Mortal on the earth they know that the Gen of God is within them they know eternal life lives with them they know royalty lays within them they know that the the the the very god of the universe the creator of Life his own gen his own life is laying within her and she knows by faith according to the word that she is now being expressed out each one is being expressed an expressed image of Christ amen amen amen hallelujah everyone got a different part to play in the body yes but everyone is needed in a body amen because why she's one body she's by one baptism she's brought brought into this body amen if the Holy Ghost baptized by one Spirit she's baptized into this body yes amen amen but she might be have a different part to play but she's from that body amen amen so you see someone with a with a different Ministry that is their Ministry don't try and imitate somebody else's Ministry amen God called you to do something stay with what God called you to do because why in this hour you are now coming to Perfection what that means you are now being placed into your position am amen the B Ministry is coming with a word to place you in your position into your rightful inheritance now if I place you in my inheritance you can't benefit from it it is my inheritance but you got to be placed in your inheritance because until you are placed there no one else can benefit from it but when you are there you you'll enjoy that inheritance and not only you will enjoy it because you are enjoying it now you are cultivating the land the bride is going to enjoy and have this wonderful time because everyone is coming to their position so she's now becoming an army an invincible Army she's becoming that super race amen because why she's not an isolated people but she's L she's an army amen there's different units in the Army amen but she's a complete Army amen so when each one is rightful in the rightful place she's going to be this invincible Army she's going to be that super church that's why Satan didn't want you to focus on yourself amen Satan was making you focus on History FOC focus on other Ministries but when it come the time for channeling this word into yourself that's the time for introspection amen and see where the Lord has placed you amen amen yes so so we got to understand what this High Calling of God is in Christ amen Ephesians 1:4 1 verse 4 and 5 says according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen amen but you see it requires spiritual maturity there was a time where we were we have to grow up and progress in our walk and each one as he growing up immature fighting with one another quarreling with one another I got it I got this I I saw this word first I saw that first but a mature person when he has knowledge he wants to impart it amen he doesn't get popped up yes he'll humble himself because the mature person in Christ realize that he can't do nothing without the Holy Ghost he always needs the Holy Ghost a mature person in Christ always recognize that they need they are dependent on the Holy Ghost always am you won't go anywhere unless the Holy Ghost leads you and it and it's shown us through the scriptures without the leading of God when the children of Israel followed their own ways they went they angered God and we know what happened to them it's same with the right here we had an example with the prophet amen the Holy Ghost would lead him but because man was pushing him and pushing him and he listen to what they say eventually and we know what had to happen amen yes so therefore any any person that's mature now learn from the mistakes will realize that you can't do nothing without the Holy Ghost amen and therefore you are not interested in all the quarreling yes you're not interested but you are interested in the price you are focused on the price we almost at the finish line now amen we on the last left amen amen that's why Hebrews 61 says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go unto Perfection amen yes not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and our faith towards God so we are pressing on to Perfection amen yes we've come by justification we've come by sanctification we come by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we coming now this is the hour where where the Holy Ghost himself must come and say yeah e them this is my beloved people Amen in the hour of adoption hear that voice she's the final voice amen she's given the authority by me yes amen I give her the authority to become the final voice in this day yes I give her the prophecy to I give her the authority to prophesy again more Nation Tong and Kings am amen it's the holy ghost that come and say they are now ready to go and prophesy they are now ready to go forth they are now mature amen they are now ready to take on the Nations they are now ready to spread forth the gospel they are now ready to walk in Supernatural because I will go before them because they are being obedient to my voice I sent my angel before them and if theyken unto my angel then now I will send my angel before them amen amen yes so we find that the bride must recognize their position yes if he doesn't recognize a position she could be squatting on somebody else's inheritance and not benefiting not growing and just being stagnant yes Christ did not call us in this to and to call you to be in a bride to be in orinary person just coming to church amen he didn't call everybody to be ministers he's chosen his fivefold ministry that's by the Bible says the fivefold ministry is chosen even before birth amen they already Chosen and the the gifts and calling are out repentance but every person in the bride of Christ ought to be a Powerhouse of God Amen yes every person in the bride of Christ ought to walk in the Supernatural in this hour amen amen because if we talking about having a continuation of the book of Acts yes there must be a progression from what we read in the book of Acts amen history must repeat itself but in progression amen hallelujah amen the supernatural must it must you know even in the Bible it says Jesus did so many miracles even the books couldn't contain it you couldn't write books about it you know even now they're finding letters and people are speaking they found many letters in history people eyewitnesses of Jesus time speaking about things that he did there because not everything could be contained in the written bible amen amen it's same with the prophet's Ministry there's so much of super natural happen you hear the things that he tells you on the tape but there so much of other things that were happening amen that's not even recorded yes so it's just like that if I can take you to your own life if I can take it bring it right here to the local assembly how many things have been happening that we can't even now keep track of Amen yes amen there certain things yes we will remember now and then but there's so many things am that when we start talking about it might be seem that we trying to make an air of ourselves but it's not about that it's people walking in the continuation of the book of Acts it's people that's living in the Supernatural people that become the manifestation of the word in hour amen amen so you got to come into your position amen amen and we know that this journey is always been pressing towards the mark this this journey didn't come okay we working in justification and we stopped there oh we come to sanctification and we stop there we come to baptism of the Holy Ghost and we stop there no we got to see the full image you got to come into the full image of Christ Hallelujah you must come into the full fullness of Christ amen amen because now the feminist part of Christ must be manifested on the earth amen and you've given the overcoming power in this age you are anointed to overcome all the distractions of Leia amen Lea is right there yes because in this is the hour where demon power political power and religious power are all join forces together amen but this is hour that you have anointed have been anointed to overcome thank you Jesus amen so we find that the world is full of distractions and Satan has improved himself over time he don't bring distruction that are obvious he don't just take you into a brle he won't just take you to a drug den no he'll bring things subtly yes he'll bring things by your people that you work with people that are close to you people that are in your family people that are your neighbors bring things like that Satan will come subtly yes and work his way to try and hinder your walk amen but we are not to focus on the distraction we are need to focus on the Press on am we got to press on toward the price amen amen because we are you must always come back to what what was your reason that you come here God have called you a people who is called by his own name amen amen called you to be a peculiar people he called you to be different from everybody else amen he called you to be ambassadors of his kingdom yes he's he's called you because he's preparing you now you can't just go and renovate the Earth without a people ready amen and you are the last of the people that will that has to come forth from the bride because until you are ready the other ones out there who are waiting to come on the Earth again they can't come amen they got to wait for you to come to Perfection they are waiting for us the then they say they without us cannot be made perfect amen so we find that we also have trials and testings but it's all coming to perfect the bride amen amen yes James 13 says the trying of your faith worketh patience so what is every test meant to do it's meant to refine us to shape us Amen to shape us into His Image amen that's what he's doing it's all shaping us into His Image yes amen amen and you find that it's also you'll find that each one of us chest are different yes your test will be different from mine amen my test will be different from yours because according to what I'm placed to be according to my position where I'm supposed to be positionally placed I will have a different testing yes amen but you have given the overcoming power amen you have given the power to overcome and he will never give you more than you can enjoy yes amen amen and everything that you need is equipped you with in this hour yes he's given you everything amen you you you lack of nothing you have lack of nothing in this hour Amen to overcome the enemy amen but now we going in our final stretch in the hour to make the Rapture amen yes that's why it says in Luke 21:36 says watch therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted to worthy to escape all these things amen so we must watch and pray not watch with your natural eyes watch with your spiritual eyes walk watch according to what's revealed to you through the word watch according to what the word Wars you of amen amen and how does the word War you that's why you've got to under a covering yes that's why you got to be under a fellowship that's why you got to have the five Watchmen in his hour you've got to come under a pastor amen you got to have a Shepherd otherwise you'll be sheep cannot lead itself sheep got to be led by a Shepherd amen amen no sheep can say no I'm I'm a spiritual person I'm studying the word I know this I know that no a sheep has to have Shepherd now that that's why we that's why I'm speaking about coming to Perfection is our when you are coming to perfection you will understand about total obedience to the word amen yes about being obedient to the word amen first you to come by total separation from all unbelief yes then you know the word says obedience is better than sacrifice because you come what is total submission to the word so total obedience to the word it means you are coming under a full submission amen what is full submission now that is showing your reverence and your love towards God amen amen Lord amen full submission is like a wife if she doesn't come into submission to husband she shows I don't care about my husband I don't respect my husband I don't care what he says I will do my own things no full submission mean you love your husband and then he will do his part it's like I'm venturing into something that I'm focusing on for another message but what I'm saying is when the the wife the bride of Christ coming to submission to Christ then he is obligated to fulfill his Parts Amen to nurture you to take care of you Amen to give you all the things that you have need of Amen but you've got to come under full submission the concubines when he wanted to come and use his name yes use him for benefits amen concubines want to use him for the benefits but they wouldn't come under full submission therefore they can't have the same connection amen the connection that you have amen amen amen amen that is why because the that's why I said the blessings are falling on the earth because of the Bride the blessings falls on the just and the unjust so they enjoying all the blessings using the very law of God they enjoying certain Privileges and blessings but one thing they will never do they can never reproduce Christ amen because they why to reproduce Christ you've got to come in the union he will never come into a union with them amen Christ will only come in the union to a virgin bride and unadulterated one will come unadulterated word into full submission amen amen into full obedience to the word amen that's why you find even in the natural if the wife doesn't come into full submission to her husband she will never replicate her husband she you you'll never see the couple you never see her representing a husband that's why they give you the scripture in Proverbs that he represents a husband if you if you read the scripture properly if you understand the scripture properly she's a represent representation of the husband amen the husband is honored because of the way the wife conducts herself amen amen and for Christ to be honored for Christ to be glorified is the way you will conduct yourself as the bride of Christ amen amen amen so this bride must press Beyond reasoning beyond all human whatever Satan puts in the way whatever comes in your mind whatever you want to do on your own your own humanistic thinking amen you got to go beyond that even you got to bypass you know there's a Battleground going on in the mind amen but you also know that the control tower if you got if you got faith there amen if you got God in the control tower then that must control the spirit amen and then the spirit will control the body amen amen so you got to bring this flesh under subjection Amen to what they must come to full obedience to what what's in the control tower yes full obedience to the words amen amen she must manifest she must walk out of the scriptures in this hour recognizing her position recognizing what she is and as she walks out of the scriptures now she will bring life to the written words amen she bring life to prophecy in hour so we look at the price now we know that is the full manifestation of Christ in his bride yes amen the full manifestation of it it was the full manifestation of God in Christ on the earth he was the fullness of the word that walked on the earth amen and they were looking at the little Temple but what they didn't see was the temple of God was right there on the earth amen amen and that's why he said you destroyed this temple in 3 days time I'll build build it up again amen so we find that if that was the temple of God then he said now what house will you build me yes amen this is the house not made of ends amen this is the house that is been building through seven Church ages in part in Parts until this in this hour amen where is where do now there must be a full manifestation where this bride has come to this full Temple amen the temple of God where he The Headstone come down yes and the sh Glory come and dwell in the temple amen amen it's no longer e board yes where the spirit has departed amen but now the spirit is dwelling in the house of man amen hallelujah the spirit is dwelling in human flesh amen and if the spirit is dwelling in human flesh there must be the supernatural amen because why the supernatural must take place if a Supernatural is dwelling in you then the supernatural must be reflected through you yes amen amen oh if you only can understand that part walk into a hospital room walk into a situation of death amen and know that greater is he that is in you amen than he that is in the world Amen listen did Satan not defeat Satan sorry did God not defeat Satan yes amen amen then where what is disease what is sickness to the demons yes those are spirits right so greater is he amen the one that defeated Satan dwelling in you yes amen then what is that him what is that little Spirit am what is that demon amen amen thank you Lord greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen You' got to recognize that amen so why you worry about a sickness cancer is a spirit it's a demon then the prophet of God teach us all these things yes so if that is a demon but the one that defeated that demon is dwelling in you yes then why do you fear cancer amen amen or any sickness for that matter so we find there must be the full manifestation of Christ in the bride that's right amen Romans 8:19 says for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God they have been waiting for this hour yes this is the hour this is the hour where the bride had to recognize who she is yes she come to know who she is amen and what's her part of the prophecy amen and this is the hour where the bride now can move in perfect Faith yes doing the greater work John 14:12 amen he said verily verily I say unto you amen he that believeth on me the works that I should I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do am because I go to my father now what do you mean by Greater Works he's saying that John 142 Greater Works amen because why is now in the many member body amen it's not in one person not in a one man Ministry amen it's now in a many membered body amen yes amen so you can't say the scripture was healing or the supernatural was just for the days of the Prophet yes it moved now to the Greater Works John 42 amen into a many membered body amen so we find all the way from Genesis to revelation we find as it was in Shadows and types and so forth until we had Jesus coming which was a full word which was Veil before the people and every time when they reading the scripture the word was veiled amen amen but the word that was veiled was he was reading the right there manifested before them but because the scripture was veiled to them they couldn't see him amen and so we find even today if you're going to go back and keep looking at history the word that you're supposed to be manifesting becomes available for you every time you focus on history and not look at the present what God is doing now the word becomes Avail for you and then you won't see the manifestation of the word yes amen but if you are able to look Beyond the Veil amen and see God in your brother see God in your sister see God in your pastor see God working now in the 54 Ministry amen then you see God being manifested before you yes amen amen yes because why this is the hour now where she must produce all of that was brought in the Ser she must come to full Perfection amen amen she everything that was revealed through all the ages it was to be gathered now in the bride amen because why she as the family Spirit the feminist part of him amen because you are part of his faith God's faith amen you are part of his virtue his knowledge his works of his work you are doing amen whatever whatever works he did Greater Works than his yes shall amen amen what what is that for to prove that she is also the word amen if he are the word why must you do that because why you are come you have come to a complete reflection of him yes yes he are dwelling in you you must reflect him so you are proving Now by doing the supernatural by the supernatural being manifested to your life The Works that he did because he did Works he didn't just come and just talk words Jesus didn't come and just teach the word he was doing the works amen amen the Apostle Paul came he didn't just teach the word and he brought the the New Testament but he manifested the word yes the the apostles didn't just teach the word they did The Works yes the brother Bram came he didn't just teach the word he produced The Works amen amen so it must happen to prove that she's part of the word she must have the works as well amen amen works of his works because we are life of his life and he works of his Works amen yes but he said Greater Works than these ye shall do amen so don't look at yourself as just an ordinary person because this is for many member body amen yes so we know when Paul is speaking he bringing the scripture now he's talking about pressing towards the Mark it's representing Our Journey coming to the full adoption in this hour coming to a full adoption and the final part of the adoption we know what that it is that is a change of the body yes because the final part of the body is a complete healing amen so if you can't believe for normal healing for temporary healing how you going to have the healing for something be completely healed from Mortal to immortality amen amen that's the final part of the the adoption this body is going to be changed completely amen amen is going to be taken out of the time element amen so we find that we are Marching now into rapturing Faith amen that's what we doing we pressing towards that now amen so we're in the final lap amen so we now as Paul said let us lay aside every weight every P every thing and just run with this price amen run for with patience for the price that awaits us amen we've been patient we've been receiving the message this message has come for many years from 1965 19 1963 the word was opened amen but the prophet I was telling Pastor Adan what a difficult thing it must have been for him preaching among babies can you I mean can you imagine yourself in front of a baby talking mature things talking complete mature language to them it's difficult now that what the prophet was doing at that time preaching amongst Pentecostal babies yes but it was a word St up for a peculiar people amen for the people that was predestinated to come out in an hour that even though that word was St up and even though the prophet wouldn't be here but the Holy Ghost yes the angel of God that one that took the message around the world he's going to go and bring life to it amen amen amen he's going to take this word across and he's going to have an encounter with each one that will come across this message yes it was the Holy Ghost when you received his message the Holy Ghost was part of the work amen it was the Holy Ghost somebody may have gave you a book somebody might gave you a tape somebody might expounded the message to you but he was the Holy Ghost was amen amen that's what makes it Supernatural amen we got to recognize the urgency of the hour amen yes we got to recognize we are now in 2025 it's a critical year for prophecy amen that's right because prophecy is unfolding before our very eyes amen yes amen we seeing right now Nation th T yes they heading for the World War III we know the Third World War come quickly but we know that the bride also W be here when that happens yes but we can see right now what we thought was so calm you know maybe about 10 20 years ago amongst Nations Nation Nations having civilized conversations with each other we can see things tense right now amen we can see moral Decay yes we can see the the world in such a SN condition we can see that we know the church was already deceived amen they've been deceived years ago and we can see the deception that they wouldn't even listen to you don't want even hear from you yes the minute you mention the name William brandham the they don't they will hear all the nice things all if you can take them to the scriptures and show them things it's all fine but the minute you mention that name because they've been thoughts it's like how you know you get the the the the Muslim terrorist children they they they learn from small to eight Israel to hate the Jews just like that they they they learned from the from the from the church organization and so forth not to listen to this message that this is a false prophet and so forth but what made you believe this amen amen what made you read the same book that they read and you saw yourself as an eagle yes and they said why this person is calling me a buzzard yes but you said he's calling me an eagle they said but he's calling me a jezebel for wearing my paint for painting my lips but you said he called me a bride amen he called me m Jesus Christ am amen amen they had the same message how they saw the name there Jezebel how do they see the name as a buzzard how they saw the name as a holl amen how you saw your name as a super Church how did you see your name as a municipal Army how did you see your name as Mrs Jesus Christ thank you Lord amen amen thank you Jesus how do they see they br in the tribulation but you saw that you're having a body change amen the kep foot s it amen amen amen Luke 21:36 says watch ye therefore and pray always that they may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man yes amen this is the last call for the bride amen this is the hour she must now step fully into Christ yes there's no time to play around amen there's no time for message gossip amen oh message sorry I used the wrong word for message politics yes that's the word I was looking for there's no time for message politics there's no time for strife and envy and so forth not in the hour of perfection amen amen because you're in a final rep now in the final rep of this race pressing to come coming in what into the image of the word what is the image of the word a complete reflection of Christ amen amen you see me you must see Christ I see you you must see Christ amen amen but you find that the world is gone into darkness the world is gone into chaos but this bride has awakened to make herself ready amen what it was it was seven tles that came and under their voices to awaken her out of spiritual Amnesia amen and now being shed through the five-fold ministry to shed light on the same word that was spoken out through the prophet Amen to bring light to it to bring it into a position in this hour to bring it into perfection in this hour to bring it into maturity in this hour where she come to that part that she must now where she come to such into such a fullness of Christ that the part left now is that the sleeping s must be raised up amen amen that is the that the voice of the Resurrection must take place yes amen amen there must be nothing left but the voice of the Resurrection but just before that takes place she must come she must completely be Christ manifested yes she must Mar to the price of the ey calling where fullness of Christ must be manifested and the supernatural must be on display amen amen because why that is taking Christ out of history and showing that Christ is now working in bright form amen Jesus Christ in bright form drawing him out of history there they going speaking to the sick raising the Dead doing the works that he did amen amen but what is doing to do this you must it call you for a total separation yes amen come out of all my people completely a complete separation from the from the thinking from the idea ideologies from The Narrative of the world and the world systems amen and we must come under the token amen the token must be on display yes which is a literal Life of Christ amen yes in each one of us amen and it must be a people that's walking in Revelation and knowledge of the words amen you can't be walking now 20 years 10 20 years in the message and be still teaching your Bible you you're going and you're understanding Bible school lessons sorry Sunday school lessons you must walk in knowledge of the truth you must your knowledge of the word must progress yes amen you can't be sitting under a Ministry that is giving you the word week after week and you're not seeing it it means that you have to come back to the beginning and have that birth right get that birth right again amen because otherwise the world will become low to you the letter that we preaching will become low to you and it will kill you but his Spirit give it life amen therefore you must have the new birth and then you can walk in this amen because to get in there your body your natural body can't take you there amen even now if you climb up the high mountain you can't make it imagine going up yes that's why I think you mentioned that one where did you think about did you consider when the prophet was caught up in the cloud the cloud coming to 28th February but the prophet was caught up in the cloud he couldn't have went with just in the Natural Body yes amen I mean how isn't to be caught up in the atmosphere even when clouds are not form it's higher than that amen absolutely this wasn't a normal Cloud this is not the natural clouds this is the supernatural Cloud formed by seven angels and formed higher than the normal clouds so how when he's caught up there a natural person with his Natural Body can't breathe there yes amen amen consider that amen this is is not normal things right amen this this message is sent around the supernatural yes that's absolutely amen this is centered around the Supernatural is that normal yes amen so we find that we come under the token amen 2 Corinthians 3:6 says who has also made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen so how do we press on this 2025 now we're in 2025 now how are we pressing on WE dying to self amen yes we must die to self amen come under full submission amen come how do you do that come into full obedience to the revealed word amen amen and we live under the token not just claiming the message but becoming the message yes amen the message must be manifested to us not claiming I believe the message yes but becoming the message amen yes because why this is the hour where foolish virgins are going to be left behind that's right because they were unprepared those that were not willing to come under the revealed word come and manifest become the message amen yes become the word and you can't become the word unless you have a union with him and you can't have a union with him unless you die to self unless you have a new birth amen you have to die to the own nature then you got to die to the things of the world to have the Holy Ghost manifest your life you must have the atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to dwell in amen yes to to walk in the Supernatural the atmosphere in your life must be right for the supernatural to dwell in you which is the Holy Ghost and for the then the prophet said this will not the angel of God won't be happy with this the angel of how many times there was a time where a person was waiting for the prophet and it took long because he was dealing with other matters and then eventually he took the prophet head and thing he traed it and when the prophet came in he just took the head he it up there and he said the angel saw that angel was not happy with that so you got to be conscious of the Holy Ghost amen yes you got to be conscious of his presence in your life amen cuz he's there to guide you amen he's there to show you the way that's why sometimes you you you want to you want to make a decision and and he's giving you that's why you got to be so sensitive and he already is telling you not to do this but you go and do it anyhow yes and the whole thing becomes a mess but when he Le but when you become sensitive to him you become in Chun dream you say no I learned from mistakes now I'm become a amen amen amen you can't be making the same mistakes over and over you got to learn from them amen amen so we got to be pressing on to our trials amen because why we are entering the kingdom amen yes we know that all the the governments everything are all worried about economic crisis they all doing that they had a time in Israel when there was a Siege in Israel while there was a Siege there but God the prophet in the land amen yes amen and when he came back the supernatural took place when when the eventually when the prophet came back you know the when there was a Siege in Saria and the people were where there was actually had to eat the baby and so forth and they were even eating from the doves droppings and things like that from the bird's droppings eventually when the prophet came and the people that besieged them they ran away and left all the things behind whenever the children of God come no matter what economic crisis take place the supernatural will take place as long as God's children are around amen yes amen didn't happen to the to the to the widow woman when the Prophet Elijah went there amen when he asked for a meal amen didn't the prophet speak about the meal offering amen which was the last meal of death is representing Christ amen and it was going to be the last meal that she was going to have but when that was the last me that was that was there but when the when when the prophet came and spoke to her and she was obedient to the prophet when she was obedient to that word the supernatural to place amen so if you come into full obedience to the word it might not seem possible it will be a paradox but when you come into full obedience to the word the supernatural takes place amen amen I think I've spent my time you want to pray so we got to check out our own selves amen amen pressing on yes or are we standing still or are we stagnant are we coming to 2025 are we progressing or are we stagnant amen are we being forced to serve God are we forced to pray are we are we being forced to fast are we being forced to read our Bibles you know your best prayer is not when in front of your front of people your your best prayer is that front of your family yes your best prayer is when your yesen your breast prayer that's how you know you're walking with God when you're driving in your car when you're alone isolated from everybody is your best prayer because there the time you can keep quiet and listen to the Holy Spirit after you speak and watch how he brings things to you amen it's your own personal time with him and then are we committed to Total obedience in this hour the door is closing amen the door is closing because why Gentiles Gentiles had this gospel for 2 now it's 25 2025 2025 years the gospel must go back to the Jews yes and we know that what's holding all of it everything the only thing that's holding everything now including the resurrection is the bride yes cuz when she come to Perfection that's when the resurrection take place and then when we go up with them then the goel goes to the Jews amen there must be a transition from the bride this bride this revival is taking place the prophet said this revival goes to the Jews amen this revival goes to the Jews they must have the Holy Ghost amen the way you come in they must get in amen amen just want to read this one quote in closing but the purpose of this is seeing you seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into or something that might have you merited somewhere but it's what God did for you himself not that you were so good that you went to church one night that some poor brother LED you up to the Altar and it wasn't that it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life amen when you get there that day no wonder the four and 24 Elders laid off their crowns everybody laid down their crowns everyone fell on their faces they didn't have one thing they could say no preacher no Elder no nothing all praise to the lamb God will gather in him all things at that day amen amen that's in the message adoption oh yes let me this one now God or the Bible said here that Steven spoke of Solomon building a temple and the most high don't dwell in temples made with hand for Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol and where is the place of my rest but a body as thou prepared me amen there you are a body as thou prepared me God dwells in the sture of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship God in us being his Tabernacle God manifesting oh how we could stay on that till you would almost suffocate in here from heat notice that God has always at all all time reflected himself in man that was God in Moses look at him born a leader Christ in the time he was born there was a persecution of children trying to find him same it was with Christ and he was delivered in their time so as Christ he was a lawgiver so as Christ Moses went up 40 days and got the Commandments and come down Christ went into the Wilderness 40 days and come back saying you've heard of them of old time thou shallal not commit adultery but I say unto you whosoever lookth upon a woman to last after her as committed adultery with her already all these different things that God reflecting himself you see each time the word is coming but it's coming in a higher form amen okay I want to get to for woman part the prophet gives an illustration about all Roberts he's talking about praying for the praying of Faith the prayer of faith and he's saying all Rob telling the people who touch the radio and they get healed he's saying you don't need that he saying see what he says here how many ever or Rob this morning when he was preaching this morning or Roberts I heard him say something or other about there was faith that of Deliverance praying the prayer of faith of Deliverance he said make your contact by touching radio make your contact by touching something he said the man was doing that so that he could he would give the people something that they could put their hands on something you say I got it now because it told me to touch my ra I got it that's all right but now real genuine Faith doesn't have to touch none of that stuff now I'm not condemning brother or not at all doing a great work and godly man I sure think a lot of him a lot of a Roberts we said too bad we ain't got more of them but he says but what I'm trying to say that Faith does not doesn't need anything Faith believes God's word yes for Faith cometh by see you got the word touching is not touching he said no faith cometh by by hearing and hearing the word of God that anchors it it's there and faith and as it said it has no distance to it faith is right now Faith is here not like it was not like it's there somebody's you understand Faith come by hearing of the word amen amen so we have to come into the fullness of the word amen we got to hear the word we got to eat of the word when you eat and eat of the word then now you are pressing and you are now producing Christ amen amen amen let's [Applause] stand have musici I think there some only beli in here thank you [Music] [Music] Lord hallelujah thank you Lord all things are POS only [Music] only [Music] oh oh all things [Music] are Jesus is here Jesus is Jesus is [Music] all things are POS Jus Oh my Jesus Jus Savior Jesus isor oh
