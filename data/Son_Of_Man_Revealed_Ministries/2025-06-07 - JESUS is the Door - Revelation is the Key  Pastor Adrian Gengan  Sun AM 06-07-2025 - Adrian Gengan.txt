Oh God we commit all things into your hands and we ask you to come and speak to us now in the precious name for Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with much thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. I greet you all in the precious name for Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Why don't you greet your brother and sisters? Say, "Welcome the house of the Lord." Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Through it all, we've learned to trust in Jesus. &gt;&gt; We've learned to trust in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our happiness doesn't determine on our circumstances. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't determine if things are going good or bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we remain joyful at all times in our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So we greet our brother Lionel. Amen. Sister Lydia, Dilia, and brother Malachi. You know, I was thinking these children are getting so big. Every time we see them, they just advance. We need to see you guys more often. Amen. So, God bless you. Amen. I pray that you're blessed. Amen. And serving the Lord faithfully. And I pray you'll be blessed this morning in the house of the Lord. Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles. We'll turn to second Peter chapter 1. Hallelujah. We've been reading second Peter chapter 1. Amen. And you know we've been speaking on divine the divine nature, the divine character, the divine power. Amen. How many of you have been following the series? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And all of it is divine. It's not earthly. &gt;&gt; So we want to progress. Amen. into a further verse there. Amen. And just read second Peter. So you'll find that after all of these things are built from faith to charity, it says, "If these things abound in you, you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now we want to get to a point where we are speaking second Peter 1 11. And I want to speak this to be able maybe you want to place the message correctly. place why the prophet and what his ministry is for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And and in there is our ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came with a ministry for a purpose. &gt;&gt; So 2 Peter 1:11 says, "For so an entrance, an entrance is a door." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall be ministered unto you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we need a ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need a ministry to open this door. An entrance shall be ministered unto you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way that door is being opened is through a ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And how is it being opened to us? He says abundantly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What rich revelation we have of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now an entrance is ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom. You can't get into the kingdom unless you come by this ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? You're being ministered into this kingdom, &gt;&gt; into the everlasting kingdom, not an an ordinary kingdom now of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. You may be seated. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord had blessings through the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice if you were paying attention you would find in second Peter chapter 1 it's coming through seven church ages &gt;&gt; from faith to charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? So the legacy church age was the seven church age. &gt;&gt; So which means that this entrance &gt;&gt; is coming after the seven church age. &gt;&gt; Come on. I need a better amen than that. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What we have in the form of the message of the hour, you can't place it in the church age. &gt;&gt; Because this is not a ministry to get people to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not a ministry to get church members. &gt;&gt; This is a ministry to prepare you for the greatest triumph of our lives, the changing of our bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not interested in church membership. &gt;&gt; Sure, if you come to church, we'll preach. We'll be happy to see you. But we are more concerned. Amen. To prepare you for the translation of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you want just ordinary eternal life, you can go to any denomination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They will not be lost. They will come through great tribulation. You'll have eternal life. &gt;&gt; But this message, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This message takes you to the throne room. &gt;&gt; This message, Amen, takes you to be married to the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a different message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're not saying you can't get a salvation in denominations, you can. &gt;&gt; And if that's all you're looking for, by all means, go there. &gt;&gt; But if you're wanting, Amen. to be a united with the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; Then this is the ministry, the message of the hour to prepare you for that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know many people preach, oh, denominations, you lost. No, he's speaking non. &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelation, it says they came out of great tribulation. He asked John, "Who are these?" He says, "These are they that have come through great tribulation." &gt;&gt; And he says he couldn't number them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we are a special class of people. &gt;&gt; So an entrance, a door is open to us. And it came via a ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And ministries after him. &gt;&gt; Yes. to open the door and abundantly put us into the everlasting kingdom. So you would know that this kingdom is not in the legacy in church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this morning, we're just laying foundation. So we won't get to everything. Amen. I'm very conscious of giving you digestible things to ponder upon and then coming on the next service and building on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we won't rush everything this morning. Amen. So we are finding here that when Jesus says in John 10:7 that I am the door, &gt;&gt; the door to the kingdom. You can put up the next slide there. Amen. Praise the Lord. So I'm contrasting this. If you put up the next slide, you'll see there it says, "For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you." But if you look at Malachi verse 4 and 5, it says, "I send you." &gt;&gt; So it's both tied together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The entrance being ministered is coming via Malachi 4 because he's sending Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, if you go to the very last slide there, slide 19. Jesus is saying that I am the door. Right? Jesus said unto them, verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door. I am the door to the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And in Revelation 10:7, it says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin the sound, the mystery of God should be finished." &gt;&gt; So maybe you're wondering, how does this two relate? Yes. &gt;&gt; He's going to open. This is now the key to the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God is now going to be the key to the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know that any door needs a key to unlock the door of Jesus because Jesus said, "I am the door." We want to unlock the key to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And why unlock the door? If you are reading here the mystery of God, the door being opened, it's a door to marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are reading this, Revelation 10:7, he is sending a prophetic gift to open the door to bring you to the marriage of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Because what is the mystery of God? Yes. &gt;&gt; In that day you shall know as I was in the father, the father in me, I in you, you in me. &gt;&gt; We are all one mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is speaking of marriage in and Jesus is saying in that day, what day? This day &gt;&gt; after denominational ages have run out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So to unlock the door of Jesus. Now many people want to know Jesus but it's not given to everyone to know Jesus. &gt;&gt; They know the Jesus of salvation but they don't know Jesus the husband. &gt;&gt; Oh come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People have heard of Jesus and they can receive salvation but yet he's coming to unveil himself in a personal way to his lovely wife. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That sounded like glory, glory, glory. that you were saying there. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of the mouth of babes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we've got to have a key to open the door to marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to have the key. Now, what did Jesus say the key was? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 16 verse uh we'll read there verse 19. Let's see what the key to open the door is. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll take it from the Bible so you can see these things and get these things. So in Matthew chapter 16, Jesus is saying, "And I will give you the keys to the kingdom." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He's going to give the keys to the kingdom, and whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; Before we get to that part, let's just go two verses up to 17. Amen. Now what Jesus had just asked him who do you say I the son of man am? &gt;&gt; And now Peter is saying blessed art thou Simon Peter told him thou art the Christ. If you put up verse 16 you'll see it there. Thou art the Christ the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; In verse 17 Jesus is now saying flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; The byproduct has not revealed it unto you. &gt;&gt; He says but my father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Right? Then he goes to verse 18 there. And I say unto you that thou art Peter and upon this rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will build my church. &gt;&gt; So our identity is locked up in revealing Christ. &gt;&gt; When Simon Peter told Jesus who he was, he revealed to him who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the prophet of Malachi 4 is coming to reveal to us the mystery of God, he is also revealing to us the mystery of ourselves. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Upon this rock I will build my church. So what is he saying? Upon revelation I will build my church. &gt;&gt; So what we are saying revelation is the key to the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation is the key to unlock Jesus. &gt;&gt; Revelation is the key to marriage. &gt;&gt; And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Why will the gates of hell not prevail against it? Jesus has got the key to the gates of hell. &gt;&gt; And that key that he got to the gates of hell, he gave to his church. &gt;&gt; If they don't want to open up the gates, you don't even have to kick it down. Amen. You got the key to open up the gates of hell and pull your loved ones out. &gt;&gt; I don't think some of you heard me. You've got the key to open the gates of hell and go and claim back your loved ones. &gt;&gt; What did Abraham do? He went to the gates of Sodom and Gomorrah. He went to the gates of hell to pull back Lot. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What do you think Auntie Wright did that day? &gt;&gt; Her sons were lost. &gt;&gt; They were trapped by the gates of hell. But by the spoken word of her own mouth, she opened the gates of hell. And she said, "I want the salvation of my two boys." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We We've not just been called to come to your message, church. I'm in the message. I'm in the message of believer prophet. It's time you start to operate the word. It's time you start to operate in the kingdom. It's about time we start to realize who we are and what we've been called for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say it again. We're not called for church membership. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. So to to get into marriage, to get into the door, you've got to have the key of revelation as we just built now. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the door and revelation is the key to unlock the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? We want to get into the everlasting kingdom. Praise the Lord. So to get the key of revelation, God can't bypass scripture. &gt;&gt; How do we get the key then? You're saying upon this rock, I will build my church. &gt;&gt; Upon revelation, I will build my church. &gt;&gt; So we all want the key. How many of you want the key? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But how do we get the key? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God won't bypass protocol. &gt;&gt; He won't bypass his own word. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you go to Amos 3:7, let's see how the key will come to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Surely, &gt;&gt; Surely, surely. &gt;&gt; Surely the Lord God will do nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he revealth his secret unto his servant, the prophets. &gt;&gt; That's why the church world don't know. It's a mystery to them. They have rejected the prophet. But he is revealing his secret to the prophet. But they don't want the prophet. So they don't get the secrets. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; To reject the prophet is to reject the secrets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He revealed his secret to his servant, the prophets. So you see how important the prophet is. I want the prophet because he's revealing to me the secrets. &gt;&gt; He's revealing to me the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we have the key now. &gt;&gt; Because we have all accepted the prophet &gt;&gt; we've all accepted the message. &gt;&gt; So, we now we got the key to unlock Jesus &gt;&gt; for marriage. What did Ruth do to Boaz? She unlocked him for marriage. &gt;&gt; She put him in a spot. &gt;&gt; Are you getting what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Because you have accepted the prophet of this age &gt;&gt; who is God's provided way. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got the right to take the key. &gt;&gt; And go sit at his feet. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Unlock him for marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we have come God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Now who in this day want to do God a service without it being his will? &gt;&gt; Do you know there are many preachers that are preaching that are not called to preach? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're trying to do God his service without his will. &gt;&gt; They're trying to start a ministry, it's failing. They're trying to start a ministry, it's failing. They're trying to preach and people are getting more confused. &gt;&gt; They're trying to They want to do God his service. &gt;&gt; But it's not his will. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stay in God's provided way and his will? &gt;&gt; His will is his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, we need a prophet. And I'll also say we need the five-fold because I'll show you the quote. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not only the prophet, but we need the five-fold who's under the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. To minister us into the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, a true five-fold ministry will pull you into the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll make every effort to make sure that you get into the kingdom. We can't bring you so far into the church and not get you into the kingdom. We have brought too many people to church, but not into the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that when we unlocking the key to the kingdom, every kingdom must have a king. &gt;&gt; This kingdom, the king has not abducted the throne. &gt;&gt; There's a king on the throne. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And every kingdom, the pride of every king. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Is his queen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of King Asus. He wanted to show Vast the queen &gt;&gt; but she refused to come. &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what Kingerus was singing? Let the beauty of King Aserus be seen in her &gt;&gt; all his wonderful passionate. He wanted his life to be seen in vastly when he had showed all his wealth. He had shown all his riches. He had shown all his military might. &gt;&gt; He realized it was not enough. &gt;&gt; The queen needed to come to be on display. &gt;&gt; And in this time and this season, God has his queen on display. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Every king has a kingdom and our king is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And our king must have his queen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he says when he's coming now in the preach, he says when he's coming out from that intercessory role, he is looking for his queen. That's a direct quote. He's looking for his queen. &gt;&gt; Why is coming into his kingdom? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So this is where now we come into the picture. We know there's a door. We know there's a key. We know we've got the prophetic key, the revelation. But when we when he now came for us, he came to us like Eliza &gt;&gt; to tell us I have called you for marriage. &gt;&gt; I made this journey &gt;&gt; from 1933 &gt;&gt; to 1963 &gt;&gt; for marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; You're just thinking about Elisa making that long journey, but you're not seeing the prophet AI journey from 1933. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. all the way to 1963 &gt;&gt; to get a bride. I no longer call you church. &gt;&gt; I call you bride. &gt;&gt; Our also took a journey and he was also led by the angel of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk about revelation coming fresh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our prophet had an angel leading him. &gt;&gt; Our prophet was the Eliza. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So when he is calling us into the kingdom, he's now showing us that we are part of the picture. &gt;&gt; That we are called to be the queen. We are called. This is why we've been called into the kingdom and called into eternity. Called into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Called into the shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now in Mark 4:11, before we progresses, let's just read Mark 4:11 and see what Jesus is saying that this key is not given to everyone else. &gt;&gt; It's to a special class of people. He said to unto them, "Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; You said, "How was it given?" How was it given? I'm sending you the key. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah. &gt;&gt; Unto you it is given to know the mystery. &gt;&gt; I'm sending you Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you want to understand the mystery, receive Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But unto them that are without doubt, all you see all these churches filled to capacity, &gt;&gt; good music programs, &gt;&gt; I wouldn't say good music programs. They're good in the eyes of the world. &gt;&gt; Very worldly music programs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nice f not nice. I can't say &gt;&gt; not nice fancy lights. Just go lights in the church. Hey, if you walk into the church now, you'll think it's not daylight then. &gt;&gt; Everything is dark. &gt;&gt; They keep it dark and the lights must be bright. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; because they are not the light anymore. &gt;&gt; They need artificial light. &gt;&gt; But he's saying to them that are without all these things are done in parables. &gt;&gt; They know nothing about the mystery. &gt;&gt; They don't they are so bad they can't even understand baptism. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yet baptism is in black and white. &gt;&gt; No, I see it there. But in our church traditions, we follow the elders. &gt;&gt; You'll follow them to nowhere. You know where. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The blind lead the blind. &gt;&gt; They'll both fall into the ditch." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know these are very basic things, but I pray I'm placing it in such a way that it makes sense. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm still a young man. &gt;&gt; The prophet says young man will come and pick these things up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And place it to make sense. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So we are talking about the entrance to the open door of marriage. The entrance which is revelation. The key to the open door of marriage. And the only way that the door can be opened is after the church has been built through seven church ages. He can't marry the church while it's still being built. &gt;&gt; He couldn't marry it in the days of Ephesians. &gt;&gt; Neither in the days of Luther or Wesley &gt;&gt; or the latest in church age. He couldn't do it because he was coming to knock and they didn't want to open up the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he comes. Where is he coming then? If you say, if you put up the second slide, there maybe the third slide. I want that primatement picture. Yeah. Can they come here to brotherly handas for marriage? Come on now, somebody please &gt;&gt; because the latest didn't open up the door. &gt;&gt; So then where must the marriage take place? &gt;&gt; In the headstone. in the bride age &gt;&gt; and she nears their headstone. &gt;&gt; She's so fitted together with him. &gt;&gt; He says those stones are so close together. You see why many message people are preaching the message of the hour trying to preach a headstone message in the legacy in church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They've not been delivered from their mind to think that this bride is not in the legacy in church age change. She's all the way up in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? This book is not revealed until the church ages. What book is he talking about? The seven seal book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seven seals can't be revealed until the church ages. Denominational ages has run out. &gt;&gt; So which means the book is also revealed where? [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go back to school. After. &gt;&gt; Somebody say after. &gt;&gt; After. &gt;&gt; Denominational ages have run out. &gt;&gt; There's time no more. It's only revealed after. &gt;&gt; Can you see after in red? &gt;&gt; It's revealed after &gt;&gt; church ages and denominational ages has run out. So the church. Amen. The seventh seal was opened in the headstone. &gt;&gt; The mighty angel coming down the headstone. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. I know I'm breaking some the church theology here right now. I know I am bringing you up to speed with 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know what that means? Let me let me break this down. If you are saying we're still in the legacy in church age, which means they open the door for you. They didn't open it for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Some people don't know what we're talking about. Go to Revelation 3:21. Is it 21? &gt;&gt; Let's just put this here for the ones that don't know the message. Amen. I I I I can say I know when the service is going up and I see when it's dipping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know when your theology is getting shaken. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go before this 20. I behold I Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm one door. &gt;&gt; Jesus said he's the door. &gt;&gt; They got their own denominational door &gt;&gt; which means they're preaching another Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; So Jesus the door went to their door &gt;&gt; and he's knocking. &gt;&gt; He wants to test his door against their door. &gt;&gt; But their door don't match his door. &gt;&gt; He was looking for someone. This is fresh now. Looking for someone in his image and likeness. &gt;&gt; And they couldn't open it because you need key to unlock door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. if any. So now they couldn't open the door. So he's shouting. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Hey, you that's in there, if any of you can hear my voice." &gt;&gt; Is he shouting through the door? &gt;&gt; Come on. You've read this before, but you've not heard it this way. &gt;&gt; He shouting through the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm knocking. That failed. &gt;&gt; I'm shouting. &gt;&gt; If any of you in there hear my voice, &gt;&gt; come out of all my people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of our sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can do it, I will come in with him &gt;&gt; and suck with him and he with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then he gives a further promise in 21. To you that overcome, I will grant you sit with me in my throne. That's marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even as I overcame, I'm sat down with my father in his throne. But my point I was getting to is this. If you believe you're in the legacy in church age, they open the door to you, which means your door match their door. &gt;&gt; How many of you play matching game? You know when they got on foul here and one foul here, but different pictures, you must unlock the cards. &gt;&gt; Matching they call it. So which means you match there and they open the legacy and door to you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now remember everything I'm telling you, I've got quotes to back it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not in the legacy in church age. We are in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't know what this is, this is the coming of the headstone. &gt;&gt; He said, I'll come with shoutings of grace. Grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many people are expecting headstone to come shouting grace. Grace in the millennium. &gt;&gt; What's your need there for? &gt;&gt; Why you need grace in the millennium? He says, "I will come with shoutings of grace." Grace, &gt;&gt; double grace. &gt;&gt; Unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he coming to do? To unlock the revelation of himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's see. Amen. If we can get back to some of these things here. So, go to the third slide. Just want to read this to lay down. Some of you may have not read the scripture before, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. Now, let me break this down. I hope everyone's listening here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me break this down. We in this church. &gt;&gt; We believe a prophet. &gt;&gt; We believe an end time prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe that he was sent as the seventh angel. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, I put those picture there to show you who that seventh angel is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God should be finished, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; As he had declared to his servants the prophets. &gt;&gt; Now, you'll find that ties in exactly with Amos 3:7, which means his secrets are coming through this prophet. &gt;&gt; You see this is a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll see that above his head is the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the same one that led Moses. &gt;&gt; It's the same one that led Paul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the same one that led brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it's the same one leading us this morning. Lord, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Go to the next slide. God has been building his church from the days of Paul &gt;&gt; all the way up. We have come past this now. &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness. You see here in this picture, it's a wrong picture. They got an eagle there. &gt;&gt; You say, "Yeah, yeah." No, it is an eagle. Yes, brother. It's an eagle. &gt;&gt; But the Bible calls him a flying eagle. Here they got a sitting eagle. We got too many sitting eagles. &gt;&gt; It says it's an anointing of a flying eagle. in action &gt;&gt; and in service. &gt;&gt; People getting tired. They want sitting eagle. &gt;&gt; We've been born in an eagle age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A flying eagle age. &gt;&gt; So we've established it comes after. What is he saying? The seventh seal book is coming after the church ages. Okay, I'm going to say it one more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I want all unbelief to be gone. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal book is opened after seven church ages. &gt;&gt; You'll see now why we are talking about this. Why it needs to be opened after seven church ages. Right now we've been dealing on character, divine character for a while. Let's see now what the prophet of God is going to say here. God's looking for character, &gt;&gt; not membership. &gt;&gt; Character. Eliza, when he went to get the bride of Isaac, he sweated it out until he found character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any man that comes looking for a woman will look for good, godly character. &gt;&gt; A man will be mad in his head if he's looking for a sexy dressed woman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because what you admiring, everyone else is admiring. Hello. &gt;&gt; In me, I want everyone to see how hot my girlfriend is. She'll be very hot in hell. Everyone in hell will see how hot she is. And if we think we're coming to play around in the message, we are going to miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, you miss the rapture, &gt;&gt; you can't go in the tribulation. &gt;&gt; You got a oneway pass. You know, you overplay Monopoly. You know they have a go to jail straight. You all are very good at replacing words. I must say okay and there will be no get out of jail free card. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You read the story of the beggar Lazarus. &gt;&gt; You can't repent when your life is finished. &gt;&gt; Today if you hear his voice repent now. &gt;&gt; Amen. commit. God is looking for surrender. Why don't we want to surrender our life to Jesus? &gt;&gt; Why don't we want to give our life to Jesus? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Eliza went to get the bride for Isaac. He sweated it out until he found character. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for divine character. &gt;&gt; Remember, Abraham put him responsible as God puts us. Oh, yeah. We're getting to it now. Amen. &gt;&gt; As God as Abraham put Elea responsible, &gt;&gt; God put us responsible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. We're ministers. &gt;&gt; Hunt my bride. &gt;&gt; You see why I told you it's not only Revelation 10:7. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's also the ministers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hunt my bride. &gt;&gt; By God's grace, that's what we are doing this morning. Even &gt;&gt; hunting the bride. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, people would say they're evangelist. &gt;&gt; Evangelist. You're in the message called end time evangelism. The prophet saying this is the end time evangelism. Yes, sir. Character. &gt;&gt; What are you saying? Slow it down. Well, if the evangelist don't want to do their job as an evangelist, I will do the work of an evangelist because the work of the end time evangelist is to get character in the people. &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And okay, are we reading this carefully? What message is that? End time evangelism. &gt;&gt; Meaning that this is how evangelism must be done in the end time. leave certain things to denominational people. &gt;&gt; We are here yet to hunt the pride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; What are we saying here? &gt;&gt; What is the top of the quote? Are we anting people for membership? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He's saying we're looking for character. Yes. &gt;&gt; Sure, we can go out and preach and fill the ship, &gt;&gt; but you could get full of people sitting in the chair without godly character. &gt;&gt; But he says end time evangelism. He says this is the end time evangelism. Yes, sir. Character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know some of you are taking tablets, but you don't have water. You know, it's hard to swallow when you don't have tablets when you don't have water. &gt;&gt; That's how I feel. The word is not getting down your throat &gt;&gt; because you are rejecting you because of your theology and how you've been trained all these years. You are rejecting the tablets of God, the gospels. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We think evangelism going on the street there. &gt;&gt; End time evangelism is different. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which means you're sitting in the chair and you don't have divine character. God's molding and shaping your divine character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Tell your neighbor, don't sleep. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help one another. Help them &gt;&gt; because you're you laughing. You don't know demon powers are coming with sleeping pills. Now, &gt;&gt; while I'm giving gospels, demon powers are coming with sleeping pills. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, see that's coming fresh too. &gt;&gt; Now I'm telling you the end time evangelism is hunting the bride and building the character. &gt;&gt; What is the character? We showed you Galatians 5:22. That's the character building of Jesus, &gt;&gt; right? Let's get to the next one now and see. Amen. Hallelujah. Now here the prophet now he just told you what the end time commission is to hunt the bride but here in 19 this was pretty late on in 1964 the prophet was kind of getting disillusioned and maybe the commission wasn't too clear so he closed his eyes and he said Lord reveal to me he closed his eyes and he said let the Bible fall open put my finger on a scripture so when he closes his eyes and he opens the Bible, it falls to Genesis 24:7. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And he says, "Elzah's faith, Abraham's faithful servant, the model servant of the Bible, being sent to the bride for Isaac." &gt;&gt; Remember, we're still dealing. This is how we're getting the key to open the door through him. Chills run over me. Chills don't run over anyone anymore. &gt;&gt; People don't have supernatural experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The prophet says chills run over him. &gt;&gt; Hey, this is 1964. It's quite late in his life. He got one more year to live. And he's saying chills ran down his spine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, do you know people don't have supernatural encounters with the Lord anymore? because they rejecting the moving of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? Why will chills run down? Somebody is fine. &gt;&gt; And you get shocked. &gt;&gt; You get awakened. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Sure. That's right. With the rest of my message, pulling out the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the God of heaven will send his angel before you to direct you. &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham told Eliza. &gt;&gt; And that's what the Lord told Moses, "I'll send my angel before thee." &gt;&gt; That's what the the Lord told the prophet in the cave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; He's going before you. And I want you to know people of God, the angel of God goes before you. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he encamps around you. Do you know what he encamps around? Do you know what encamps around? Meaning you see you don't go to where the angel is in a camping site. You know you got campsites. &gt;&gt; How many of you been to a campsite? &gt;&gt; Meaning you must take your things, your tent, you must take all your equipment and go to the campsite. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this scripture is saying that the angel brings all his equipment &gt;&gt; and he brings his tent &gt;&gt; and he encamps he sets up camp wherever you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We talk about divine character. When God is building up our character, we are saying, "God, get me out of this situation." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many of us are saying that? Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you put up Psalm 23, &gt;&gt; what does he say? Lord, get me out of my situation. But you want character molding. You want God to take you out of the situation. But in Psalm 24, he says he prepares a table before me &gt;&gt; in the presence of my enemies. &gt;&gt; So which means that you want him to come out, God is putting a table and he's saying, "Sit down." Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you all read Psalm 23? &gt;&gt; Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. &gt;&gt; Who? Why would a table be prepared? Somebody tell me. For massage. &gt;&gt; Come on. For food. &gt;&gt; So he's saying, I want you to sit down. I've got a meal prepared for you. And in this trial, I want you to eat. &gt;&gt; Sit. &gt;&gt; Now, if you know that you shouldn't eat and be stressed, &gt;&gt; you must be relaxed. &gt;&gt; You like to eat and be stressed for the kill. The food don't go down nice. How many of you are stressed? You forgot the food is finished and you you don't even know you ate it. But he's saying, "Thou prepareest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies." Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only that, while you sitting there, &gt;&gt; it's so hard to get the woman to bring oil and massage you. &gt;&gt; Not my wife, but she come massaging. See, he's coming to massage your head. How many of you like my Indian head massage? What is he saying? You anoint my head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With oil. My cup runth over where? &gt;&gt; Right in your trial. &gt;&gt; Right in the presence of your enemies. &gt;&gt; You're getting food. &gt;&gt; You're getting oil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And your cup is running over. &gt;&gt; Right in the presence of your enemies. &gt;&gt; Which means he didn't take you out of the situation. &gt;&gt; He blessed you abundantly. An entrance was ministered to you right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's get back to the slide, brother. So the angel of God is very important. He takes up his tent, his equipment and he comes where you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He encamps around you. &gt;&gt; So the God of heaven will send his angel before you to direct you. He went right straight out and began praying and he met the beautiful Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He met the beautiful Rebecca that become the bride of Isaac. Just a perfect message. Back to the word. Go get that bride. That's a duty. That's what I'm here for. That's what I'm trying to do. He's call out a bride. That's end time evangelism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's another scripture that's tied to brother Brandham. It's it's Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; Now, he says, "The son of man is prophesied to be revealed." And what kind of revelation, what kind of key will it be? Come on now. We still looking at key. What kind of a key will the son of man reveal be? Watch what it says. It'll be the revelation of his living after being crucified for 1900 years and he's raised up raised from the dead and he's alive with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we are claiming that Luke 17:30 has been revealed, &gt;&gt; what kind of key will it be? &gt;&gt; Proving Jesus Christ is alive amongst us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I know that brother Brandon proved Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; He raised the dead. &gt;&gt; He healed the sick. &gt;&gt; Blind eyes were opened. &gt;&gt; All kinds of miracles were there. He even created fish. Amen. Brought fish back to life. Created squirrels. Spoke to storms. Spoke to winds. &gt;&gt; It proved Jesus Christ alive. I am saying now in 2025, the key given to the bride, the son of man is still being revealed through the bride. And it must prove that he is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. He says, "And the Holy Spirit always speaks of the word." That's the reason now we're getting to the the nitty-gritty now. Revelation is coming by the seals. &gt;&gt; So the key is coming by the seals. &gt;&gt; Come on now. We're following a fortune. We're looking for the key to the door and we are finding how we are getting the key to the door. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the coming of the seals, that's the mysteries coming to us at the finishing of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's break this down. How many of you believe Revelation 10:7 is fulfilled? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You sure? &gt;&gt; And you can't back down now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he said at the finishing of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Now if you believe the seventh seal is not open, &gt;&gt; you got a problem. &gt;&gt; Because he says at the finishing of the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God should be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which means at the finishing of the seventh seal, Revelation 10:7 sounds. &gt;&gt; Hey, are you reading with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we got good grammar? Yeah. We reading properly. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not mislocating. We're not misplacing. We're reading exactly &gt;&gt; at the finishing of the seven seal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Which means it must be opened. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God should be finished to know what &gt;&gt; revelation. Now, wasn't this what Peter knew to know who he is? &gt;&gt; To know who God is. &gt;&gt; What he is? How he lives? &gt;&gt; His nature. is being &gt;&gt; you're supposed to be all the way up here at that time. He's got a pyramid there in the church. &gt;&gt; And he's showing them the headstone. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's showing them the headstone and he's saying, "You're supposed to be all the way up here by that time." &gt;&gt; For what? We've been laboring on adoption for so long. For what? to bring us into the full stature of sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we're doing very good with time. We will finish on time. So, just relax and enjoy the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, "Lord, come right now. Anoint my head with oil." &gt;&gt; If you didn't realize it, your head is being anointed with oil right now. &gt;&gt; Right now, your cup is running over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right, let's progress this thought. Now, he's talking about Genesis 1:27. We're talking about the bride and groom. We're talking about the door that's open for marriage. He says he created man, male and female. Did you notice the body part was a byproduct? &gt;&gt; Eve's flesh body was a byproduct. &gt;&gt; Right now, this flesh body is a byproduct, &gt;&gt; but not the spirit. Yes. &gt;&gt; Eve's spirit was not a byproduct. &gt;&gt; The spirit was part of Adam for he was both man and woman spiritually speaking both masculine and feminish. In slide 12 there he says we in flesh in flesh are different. We're like a byproduct. You want to do good, but the flesh is failing you. We got all angels here. &gt;&gt; I see Halo's here. Amen. You want to tell the truth, but lies so easy. He says we in flesh are different. We like a byproduct created being by holy wedlock. Oh, he's coming to marriage now. &gt;&gt; But in spirit we are sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; In spirit we are sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; That's why the apostle Paul is saying now do not walk after the flesh. &gt;&gt; Do not walk like a byproduct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says but walk in the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit man must take control of the byproduct. &gt;&gt; You want to lust up to that woman. You want to tell her, "Thou art a neck like a dove." What? What did he call it? Eh, you didn't read Song of Solomon. Your teeth are like the gates of something, he says. And your eyes are like dove's eyes. Your neck is like a goose. Guys, if you want to be romantic, you must read Song of Solomon. I don't know if this 21st century girls will appreciate that language, but Solomon is very descriptive. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "But in spirit we are sons of God, not some other spirit, but the spirit of the living God." &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember that quote, "We were spirits that rotated off of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He is confirming that our spirit being &gt;&gt; is the same as God. &gt;&gt; Not some other spirit but the spirit of the living God. &gt;&gt; We are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the living God because we become sons of sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Right. Next quote. You're going to love this now. Not separated but the same spirit, the same God, the same person joined in wedlock to the eternal. Come on. We are joined in wedlock to the eternal. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So how come we talk about God like he's a distant being &gt;&gt; when we are joined in only only wedlock to the eternal? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch how it progresses us now. When we are joined in only wedlock to the eternal. See how God planned it that we should not be different but him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, somebody read that. Come, come swallow that pill now with your water. &gt;&gt; You mustn't be different to the one that you are joined in only wedlock. He's saying he planned that you should not be different, but you should be him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see how wonderful it is to have the key. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The key to unlock the door to Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; Not some other being of some other tribe, but a real union and offspring of Almighty done by a holy union. Ah, now we getting into it. &gt;&gt; He opened the door to marriage because he needs a wife to put his seed word into. &gt;&gt; And once his seed word gets into the bride, that's why we're eating the word. The life of Christ is reproduced and we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the body comes from mother and father, but the spirit comes from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch. Now, you're not only that, but you're going to the wedding in the sky. &gt;&gt; Yes. And you're wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmmerited grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the marriage of the lamb, he says, "Where's the ring?" I would now require a token. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; What is the token? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many of you have been to weddings? &gt;&gt; They require a token. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm giving you your wedding band is predestinated. &gt;&gt; Unmmerited grace." &gt;&gt; A wedding band of grace unmmerited of your own. God did it himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So he slipped the wedding band on you. where &gt;&gt; I thought when the prophet came and called you out, he slipped the wedding band after that. &gt;&gt; I thought when you received the message of the hour, he slipped the wedding band. &gt;&gt; This God is not taking a chance in Satan's he put the wedding band there in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, when you see the wedding band, you know she's already spoken for. She's already married. You can't go flirt with her. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he slips the wedding band in &gt;&gt; over there. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Put your name on a book." Now you say, "Where's the wedding band?" How did he put the wedding band? He's telling you, but you just need to read it correctly. When he put your name on the book, &gt;&gt; that's when he slipped the wedding band. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the wedding band is as good as him putting the name in the book. &gt;&gt; When he's writing the name, he's saying wedding band. &gt;&gt; Putting your name in the book. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, why was the key given to us? Why was all of this? We're closing now. Amen. Think we got two slides. Why this? What is the opening of? Where's the key? Here it is. He says revealing Christ is the promise of the age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ is revealing himself. He's the promise of the age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, what does Christ mean? The anointed one. &gt;&gt; Revealing the anointed one is the promise of the age. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God revealed brother Brandham as the anointed one, he was the promise of the age. Revelation 10:7, Malachi 4:5 and 6. Amen. Luke 17:30. He was the promise of the age. &gt;&gt; So what's the promise of this age? Is God still revealing Christ? &gt;&gt; Is he still revealing Christ? Thou must prophesy again. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, revealing Christ, Revelation 10:8-11 is now the promise of the age. &gt;&gt; I believe Lord, &gt;&gt; here it is. Now, then what is the opening of the seals? What is the key? What is the revelation? Revealing the anointed one. &gt;&gt; The purpose of revealing the seals is to reveal the anointed one. &gt;&gt; Is to reveal Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's showing us Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals then? &gt;&gt; Revealing Christ. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:8-11 is Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thou must prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the promise of the age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Great is the mystery of godliness. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go quickly to Colossians 1:13. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:13. Watch now. He had delivered us from the power of darkness. &gt;&gt; So, which means that light is also a power &gt;&gt; and has translated us and at finished work. &gt;&gt; How many of you are waiting for the translation? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The other apostle Paul now he hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. Are we talking about the door to the kingdom? &gt;&gt; He's saying he's already translated us &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of his dear son. How did he translate us, brother Joshua? How did he translate us, brother Shan? Via the shout. The shout has translated us. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You say, "But I'm waiting for a physical translation." If you don't have the translation of the shout, you won't have a physical translation. To miss the shout is to miss the rapture. To miss the shout is to miss the prophet. To miss the shout, your body is not going to be changed. &gt;&gt; So the shout then is your down payment that you already translated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why now do you understand the prophet when he says they'll come in that day and they'll say, "Wasn't there supposed to be a rapture?"
