[0:14] morning our pastor Adrian is gone out
[0:16] ministering to at the ill tabernacle in
[0:21] for
[0:23] pastor Jonathan. I believe he's gone out
[0:27] ministering in Pakistan. So he's gone
[0:29] out there. We pray that God will be a
[0:32] blessing to them this morning. Amen.
[0:35] And we pray that God will also the we
[0:38] know there's a mighty move of the
[0:40] spirit. Amen. Around the world, there's
[0:43] a quickening amongst the bride of Jesus
[0:45] Christ. Amen. And we pray that uh as the
[0:51] quickening power moves, God is bringing
[0:53] his bride into alignment. Amen. Yes.
[0:56] He's bringing the bride into his
[0:57] program. Amen. God always had his
[1:00] program. Man had a program, but God
[1:04] always had his program. Amen. And he
[1:06] knew that in time and season, he'll
[1:09] bring a people back into his program.
[1:12] God's purpose must be fulfilled. Amen.
[1:14] Amen. So he said, "I will present
[1:17] myself, yes, a glorious church."
[1:19] Personal pronoun. Amen. I will present
[1:22] myself a glorious church without spot,
[1:24] without wrinkle. Amen. So from the time
[1:28] he's given the covenant, it's always the
[1:30] I will covenant. Amen. So God is able to
[1:34] perform that which he said he'll
[1:36] perform. Amen. Amen. Amen. Because God's
[1:40] interpretation of prophecy is when the
[1:42] manifestation takes place. Amen. That's
[1:45] right. So you and I must be the
[1:47] interpretation of the prophecy. Amen.
[1:49] You and I must be the interpretation.
[1:51] Amen.
[1:53] The prophecy in this hour. So when
[1:55] there's a manifestation, we become the
[1:58] interpretation of that prophecy. Amen.
[2:01] So pray for Pastor Adrian has gone out
[2:04] ministering. Amen. Pray that uh God will
[2:09] uh believe his day a special blessing.
[2:22] Are you
[2:24] back? God
[2:29] bless. Can you hear
[2:33] me? The believers are keep complaining
[2:36] that the engineer sound engineers keep
[2:38] complaining when I use the mic. I keep
[2:39] dropping the mic. So they said I must
[2:41] use
[2:42] this. Amen. So pray that Lord will put
[2:46] out a special blessing. Yes. So as I was
[2:48] saying, pray that the Lord will have it
[2:50] upon Pastor Adrian as he
[2:52] minister. As you have been blessed with
[2:54] the word, as you have been blessed with
[2:56] the gift, so the gift must be sent out.
[2:58] Amen. Yes. Amen. And uh we have
[3:02] a before I go to this uh after the
[3:05] service today, we'll pray that we'll all
[3:08] greet. We'll go outside and we'll come
[3:09] back in. We just want to discuss I see
[3:11] we don't have presation. Yeah. We want
[3:13] to discuss uh about a farewell that we
[3:16] want to have for him. As you already
[3:17] know that he'll be leaving to to stay in
[3:21] he's already working in Johannesburg.
[3:22] He'll be leaving with his family to
[3:24] permanently reside there. So we want to
[3:28] have a special farewell good send off to
[3:30] him because of the dedication that he's
[3:33] been in assembly for many years and
[3:35] served in the office of the of the
[3:37] church. And we pray that when we
[3:41] complete the service, God has agreed, we
[3:43] could just come in and just have a
[3:45] discussion around that. All right. And
[3:47] then just before we go into prayer, we
[3:50] have a prayer request. Sister Maggie is
[3:53] unwell and we also have a prayer request
[3:56] for
[3:58] sister. Uh you all know that the leg was
[4:02] amputated and now the they're saying
[4:04] that she has an infection in the other
[4:06] leg.
[4:08] But we pray that as we pray, we'll
[4:11] rebuke that infliction, that infection.
[4:13] Amen. Believe that we can stand in the
[4:16] gap as believers. And we have we are
[4:19] heirs to the promise. Amen. We are to
[4:21] every redemptive blessing and all things
[4:23] are possible with our God. We believe
[4:26] that he's a supernatural God. And
[4:28] nothing can stand in the way of the
[4:31] prayers of the saint. If you believe, if
[4:32] you ask anything in his name and
[4:34] believing, we shall receive it. Amen.

[7:05] captivity to the obedience of your word
[7:07] right now. Let our focus come to you
[7:09] right now. Be in tune with you. Let us
[7:11] come, Lord, in the rhythm of the
[7:13] composer this morning. We ask it now in
[7:16] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen.
[7:19] You got your Bibles, we turn to the book
[7:21] of
[7:22] Ezekiel, chapter 37.
[7:35] Amen. God bless you. Does that sound
[7:37] good? Praise God. Amen. The book of
[7:40] Ezekiel chapter 37:E 10. And the word of
[7:44] the Lord says, "And the hand of the Lord
[7:47] was upon
[7:48] me, and carried me out in the spirit of
[7:51] the Lord, and set me down in the midst
[7:54] of the valley, which was full of
[7:58] bones, and caused me to pass by them
[8:01] roundabouts.
[8:04] And behold, there were very many in the
[8:08] open valley, and lo, they were dry, dry
[8:13] in leaders,
[8:15] dry in
[8:17] denominations. And he said unto me, son
[8:20] of man, this must take a prophetic
[8:23] ministry. Amen. Amen. Can these bones
[8:27] live? And I answered, oh Lord, thou
[8:30] knowest. Again he said unto me, prophesy
[8:34] unto these bones and say unto them, oh
[8:37] ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
[8:42] Thus say the Lord God unto these bones,
[8:44] behold, I will cause breath to enter
[8:47] into you, and ye shall live. Amen.
[8:52] And I will lay sus upon you and will
[8:55] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[8:58] with skin and put breath in you and ye
[9:03] shall live and ye shall know that I am
[9:07] the Lord. So I prophesied as I was
[9:13] commanded. And as I prophesied there was
[9:15] a noise and behold a shaking and the
[9:18] bones came together. bone to is bone.
[9:23] Amen. Each bone had to be framed. Amen.
[9:26] You won't get the ankle bone going to
[9:28] the shoulder bone. Each bone had to come
[9:30] where it wasly framed into the body.
[9:33] Amen. And when I beheld, lo the sinus
[9:36] and the flesh came up upon them and the
[9:39] skin covered them above, but there was
[9:42] no breath in them. Amen. This body has
[9:45] come now. The body is formed, but now we
[9:48] need life in it. Amen. Amen. Yes. Amen.
[9:52] Then said he unto me, "Prophesy unto the
[9:55] wind." Now do the second prophecy now.
[9:57] Then he said unto me, "Prophesy unto the
[10:00] wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to
[10:02] the wind, thus say the Lord God, come
[10:06] from the four winds, O breath, and breed
[10:09] upon his slain that they may live."
[10:12] That's the second part of the prophecy.
[10:13] The first part was Revelation 10:1-7.
[10:16] Here's the second part. Revelation 10
[10:18] 8-11. Amen. So I prophesied as he
[10:21] commanded me. And the breath came into
[10:25] them and they looked and stood up upon
[10:28] their feet and a great sorry an
[10:31] exceeding great army. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[10:36] Hallelujah. Amen. You may be seated. Now
[10:38] we'll go to Revelation
[10:40] 8 verse
[10:48] 19. 19 says, "For the earnest
[10:51] expectation of the creature waited for
[10:54] the
[10:55] manifestation of the sons of God." Amen.
[11:00] Amen. So for a title this morning, we
[11:02] want we will speak on the manifested
[11:04] sons of
[11:06] God, the invisible army and the power of
[11:10] the shouts. Amen. The manifested sons of
[11:15] God. Sorry, the invincible army. Did I
[11:19] say invisible? Sorry. The invincible
[11:21] army and the power of the shouts.
[11:26] Amen. Right there in the scripture, you
[11:28] could see that invincible army. Amen.
[11:30] Because Ezekiel is speaking about when
[11:33] the life came into them, when the spirit
[11:35] came into them, when the dynamics came
[11:37] to them. Amen. They lived and stood up
[11:40] upon their feet an exceeding great army.
[11:44] Amen. Yes. Amen. We know the prophet
[11:47] said there'll be super church, a super
[11:49] ra and invincible army. Amen. So we
[11:54] speaking this morning on the manifested
[11:56] sons of God, the invincible army and the
[11:58] power of the shouts. Amen. Because there
[12:02] was a time when sons of God had to be
[12:04] manifested, right? Amen. Because why? A
[12:07] prophetic voice had to come down in this
[12:08] hour and he had to wait for a message.
[12:10] He had to wait for the mighty angel to
[12:12] come down with title deed in his hand.
[12:15] Amen. He was waiting for a message that
[12:17] there was a shout. Amen. Because the
[12:19] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[12:21] with a shout with a voice of the
[12:23] archangel and the trump of God. Amen. So
[12:25] it was a three-fold purpose. But Christ
[12:27] is doing all three things as he is
[12:30] standing. Amen. And he was waiting for
[12:32] the shout message to gather the living
[12:34] saints. Amen. Amen. But Amen. So when
[12:37] he's gathering them, he's bringing the
[12:39] mechanics in. He's bringing the word
[12:41] that is forming the body, the structure.
[12:43] The word is forming the structure.
[12:46] taking them out of dead leucia, taking
[12:48] out of the denominational graves. Amen.
[12:51] Where the still bodies were lying and it
[12:54] was happening right in the s day. Amen.
[12:57] What a resurrection that was 2,000 years
[13:00] ago. And what a resurrection this is in
[13:02] the present time. That's what he was
[13:04] preaching. Amen. It was it was coming
[13:07] down in the soom day. Amen. Yes. Amen.
[13:11] And we find that the mechanics was
[13:12] coming to bring this body raise them up
[13:15] out of denominational graves. Amen. But
[13:17] a shout. Amen. Because why it came with
[13:20] a quickening power. Amen. But now here
[13:24] here's the thing. Now this prophet is
[13:26] fulfilling each part of the scripture.
[13:28] But there must be another part according
[13:29] to Ezekiel where the Lord said now
[13:31] prophesy again. Amen. And because now
[13:34] prophesy again goes back to son of man
[13:36] ministry again. And this must be sons
[13:39] manifested again. When sons come to
[13:42] manifestation to realize their position,
[13:45] to realize who they are in this
[13:47] prophecy. Amen. To realize they part of
[13:50] the scripture in the hour when they can
[13:52] walk now in perfect faith by recognizing
[13:55] their true identification in the word.
[13:58] Not somebody else's identification, but
[14:01] their identification in the word. When
[14:03] they recognize why God called them, what
[14:06] was the purpose of God revealing this
[14:08] word to you? What was the purpose of you
[14:12] seeing the message and somebody else not
[14:14] seeing it? Amen. It was not done to make
[14:16] you just uh to come into church and have
[14:19] another form form of religion or to say
[14:22] that you know something better than
[14:24] denominations or you have a higher form
[14:26] of worth than them. No, it's to show you
[14:28] that you are sons of God. Amen. Amen.
[14:32] Amen.
[14:33] It is it is showing you the entire
[14:36] purpose of redemption because the
[14:39] purpose of redemption was not to make
[14:41] you a churchgoer. The purpose of
[14:43] redemption was to bring you back to all
[14:47] that Adam lost. To bring you back to
[14:50] your original condition. And what did
[14:52] Adam lose? Adam lost the Holy Ghost.
[14:55] Amen. And you might have the Holy Ghost
[14:58] back in you. Amen. Amen. We're not
[15:00] talking about the gifts of the Holy
[15:02] Spirit cuz that was big given to the
[15:04] church and it was given to the church to
[15:06] operate. Amen. To show the supernatural
[15:08] God is amongst them. But to have the
[15:11] Holy Ghost himself, Amen. Where God and
[15:14] man has become one where there is a
[15:16] oneness between the father and his son.
[15:18] Amen. And God could come in the cool of
[15:20] the day and have fellowship with Adam.
[15:23] And that's what God's entire purpose of
[15:26] redemption was. Everybody was playing a
[15:29] part of redemption. That's why when
[15:31] Jesus would come on the earth 2,000
[15:32] years ago, he could tell you a greater
[15:35] than Solomon is here. He could take
[15:37] every part of the scripture. But now
[15:39] when you come on earth, you could see
[15:41] yourself in Esther. You could see
[15:43] yourself in Ruth. You could see yourself
[15:45] all through the Bible in Sarah, in
[15:47] Rebecca, in all these types. You are
[15:50] seeing your own selves in the scripture
[15:52] walking in perfect faith all the way
[15:54] back to the to the garden of Eden. Amen.
[15:58] All the way back in perfect harmony with
[16:00] God. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[16:05] So, here we see Ezekiel 37. We know
[16:08] Ezekiel 37. Now, he's speaking is
[16:11] happening now before the time he's
[16:14] showing you now how this this this this
[16:17] army is rising up. Amen. This army is
[16:19] going to be raised up. Amen. This great
[16:21] exceeding army is going to be raised up.
[16:24] But it's happening before because
[16:26] Ezekiel 38 and 39 if you go there that
[16:29] focus more on Armageddon. He's a type of
[16:31] Armageddon. Amen. Ezekiel 40 is type of
[16:34] the millennium. But before the
[16:36] Armageddon, before millennium, there
[16:37] must be this army raised up. Amen. Amen.
[16:42] And before that there must be the
[16:44] prophecy before Armageddon and before
[16:47] the millennium you must have the
[16:49] prophecy of the son of man. Amen. Yes.
[16:52] And is what he's doing is restoring
[16:55] bring you back to full restoration.
[16:58] Amen. That you had to come to full
[17:00] restoration. Amen. Amen.
[17:03] Stuck there denominational graves, not
[17:06] knowing God's purpose for your life. But
[17:08] a shout came forth. Amen. To awaken you.
[17:11] Amen. Take you out of amia. Pull you out
[17:14] of there. Make you realize that you're
[17:16] not a chicken. You're an eagle. Amen.
[17:18] Amen. Yes.
[17:23] Amen. So we saw him coming with power
[17:25] and great glory. Amen. And we have to
[17:28] look up for redemption drawn nigh. Amen.
[17:31] When it's coming in power and great
[17:33] glory, the poor can't see it. Yeah. It's
[17:35] not for everybody. Amen. Amen. That's
[17:38] right. But it's for a special class of
[17:41] people. Amen. Amen.
[17:45] So we find that God is restoring his
[17:49] sons to have
[17:50] dominion. Amen. Yeah. That's what he
[17:53] wants his sons to have dominion. Amen.
[17:55] Because that what his son
[17:58] had. That's what his son lost. And the
[18:02] entire plan of through the ages through
[18:06] the prophets through Christ through the
[18:08] apostles through all the seven church
[18:10] ages bringing you back to what his son
[18:13] lost. Amen. It couldn't happen. It could
[18:16] come in part in part. But the fullness
[18:18] come now when title deed book comes back
[18:21] on the earth again.
[18:23] Amen.
[18:25] So God is not just building a church.
[18:27] Yes sir. He's raising up manifested son
[18:30] of God. Amen. Restored to their original
[18:34] condition. Lord, if people want to be
[18:36] satisfied with church, then they can
[18:39] have church. But God is not satisfied
[18:41] with that. That's when that's when you
[18:44] stagnate the Holy Ghost. When when
[18:46] there's a move of God and God does
[18:49] something, you're happy with it. You're
[18:50] excited, but you don't keep following
[18:52] the leading of the spirit. Yes. We must
[18:54] always follow the leading of the spirit.
[18:57] Amen. Yes. When you think that is all
[18:59] God has done and you are still here on
[19:01] the earth, then you must follow the
[19:04] spirit. But if you if you are still here
[19:06] on the earth and think that you've got
[19:07] all that God and you you denominate
[19:10] around that certain doctrine, then you
[19:12] stagnate the move of the of God. You
[19:14] stagnate the move of the Holy Ghost.
[19:17] Amen. But the Holy Ghost is moving.
[19:20] Amen. Is bringing us people until you
[19:22] have the translation. Amen. Until you
[19:25] have the body change. Amen.
[19:31] Prophet of God thought that redemption
[19:33] is not just salvation. Amen. But a
[19:36] complete restoration. Glory. Back to
[19:39] what Adam lost. Amen. To full dominion
[19:43] as sons of God. Amen. Therefore, we had
[19:46] to come in
[19:48] stages. Now, to have access that full
[19:51] authority, to access that full dominion,
[19:54] you had to come and be tutoed. Amen. You
[19:58] have to come through the word and and
[20:00] how the Holy Ghost is working. It's the
[20:02] Holy Ghost that's tutoring you. But you
[20:04] got to look beyond the veil and see how
[20:06] the Holy Ghost is ting you. The Holy
[20:09] Ghost is tutoring you through the
[20:11] five-fold ministry. Which is now
[20:13] positionally placing you into your
[20:16] rightful part of the body. Amen. That
[20:19] you come into alignment to your
[20:20] theophony. Amen. That your the the part
[20:23] of the body you must be fly framed. Do
[20:26] not fall into somebody else's part of
[20:29] the body. Amen. Fall into your rightful
[20:31] place. Amen. That's what the Holy Ghost
[20:33] has come to do to positionally place
[20:35] you. Amen. And when the and you as a son
[20:39] and daughter of God come and apply the
[20:42] true token which gives you access which
[20:44] gives you which is a literal life of
[20:46] Christ in you. Amen. You throw away the
[20:48] trash of the world. Throw away the trash
[20:50] of Leia. Amen. Yes. And then now you
[20:53] have rightful claims to the true token.
[20:55] Amen. Amen. And then when you have
[20:57] rightful claims to the true token, then
[20:59] you are position and then you are
[21:01] positionally placed. Then God is able
[21:04] now to now manifest himself through you.
[21:08] Give you access to full authority. Yes.
[21:11] Amen. Cuz you are rightful heirs. But
[21:14] there are conditions to these. Amen.
[21:16] That you must apply the token. That you
[21:18] must come to maturity in this hour. You
[21:21] must come to adoption.
[21:23] Every son of God must come to adoption.
[21:28] Amen. And let me say
[21:31] this as you as the son of God cannot
[21:35] come to adoption. And now if you are
[21:37] being tutoed through the five-fold
[21:39] ministry until the five-fold ministry
[21:41] comes to adoption, you cannot be adopted
[21:44] because you are being t the Holy Ghost
[21:45] is working beyond the veil. Amen. You're
[21:48] working through the five-fold ministry.
[21:50] So he's placed shepherds in every
[21:52] church. Amen. He He's given people
[21:54] shepherds to to watch over the his
[21:55] flock. So he must come and adopt the
[21:58] shepherd first. Yes. Amen. Cuz the
[22:00] shepherd's going to positionally place
[22:02] the people. Amen. The Holy Ghost is
[22:04] working through the shepherd. The didn't
[22:05] the prophet say you cannot be higher
[22:07] than your pastor. Amen. So and he said
[22:10] your pastor will see you through. So the
[22:12] the shepherd has to be adopted first.
[22:14] Yes. Amen. See if the shepherd does not
[22:16] come to adoption, how can the people be
[22:18] adopted?
[22:20] So God does everything in perfect order.
[22:24] Amen. Thank you, Lord. This is a God of
[22:27] order. Amen. He's not a God of chaos.
[22:30] Amen. Cuz this is remember God is
[22:33] preparing you. You are people of a
[22:35] kingdom. You are not people of a of a of
[22:39] a of a land of democracy. You belong to
[22:42] a kingdom. You need to be kingdom minded
[22:44] and know how father operates in his
[22:47] kingdom. Yes, sons. If you was born in
[22:50] the royal family, from the time you are
[22:52] small, little little child, you'll be
[22:54] growing up learning about how to perform
[22:57] royal duties and the royal function from
[22:59] the time you are little. Yes, that's
[23:01] right. Amen. And only when you are ready
[23:04] and mature enough and now able to to
[23:07] function in the royal functions, then
[23:10] you can have certain authority. Amen.
[23:13] But God given us full access. Nothing is
[23:15] withdrawal from us. Amen. But we have to
[23:18] come in that stages. Amen. We have to
[23:22] come to maturity. We have to come to
[23:24] adoption. Amen.
[23:27] So the church will have to come to a
[23:30] place where is not just a church
[23:32] anymore.
[23:35] Amen. But it becomes Christ, the word
[23:40] made flesh again. Hallelujah.
[23:44] This bride will be the super church, a
[23:47] super race. Amen. Amen. That's what the
[23:50] prophet of God said.
[23:53] And he says redemption is not bringing
[23:56] man just to be a good Christian.
[23:59] Amen. This is what we are taught. Amen.
[24:01] In the message.
[24:03] Redemption is not that. Because if you
[24:07] want to be a good Christian, there a lot
[24:08] of people can can act out to be a good
[24:10] Christian. Yes. But redemption is
[24:13] bringing a man to where he fell from,
[24:17] what he was,
[24:19] and sorry, and what he truly is. Amen.
[24:23] Which is a son of God. Hallelujah.
[24:26] Amen. But you come, you've got to now be
[24:29] born into this kingdom. You've got to be
[24:33] born again. You can't bypass. Yes. And
[24:35] God doesn't let you bypass any stages in
[24:38] this redemptive work. Because only when
[24:41] you are remember your first birth put
[24:44] you in the natural body,
[24:47] right?
[24:48] And through the natural body you come to
[24:51] the old nature.
[24:53] But your new birth, Amen. Amen. It
[24:57] brings you now into this special class
[25:01] of people. Amen. Into the special race.
[25:04] Amen. Amen. Because you come
[25:07] now through the royal seed of Abraham
[25:10] which is through Christ. Amen. That's
[25:12] right. And through the new birth now you
[25:15] are now a different species on the
[25:18] earth. Different from every other human
[25:21] being on the earth. Hallelujah.
[25:23] Different from every mortal that's
[25:24] walking the earth today. Amen. Amen.
[25:28] Because now through the new birth now he
[25:31] puts he takes your stony heart away and
[25:33] gives you out of flesh. Now we can put
[25:35] his spirit in you because your spirit
[25:40] was contrary to his spirit. His spirit
[25:44] couldn't have fellowship with your
[25:45] spirit. But by the new birth now he
[25:48] takes your stony heart gives you out of
[25:49] flesh. Now he can put his spirit in you.
[25:53] Now you don't be contrary to each other.
[25:55] Amen. Amen. There won't be enmity
[25:57] between each other. Amen.
[26:00] And then now you start when you have
[26:02] this new birth, now you can bring this
[26:04] body under subjection. You can bring
[26:06] this body under dominion again. Amen.
[26:12] So you're finding that Ezekiel's vision
[26:14] is purely showing us that God is raising
[26:16] this invincible army. Yes. Amen. We know
[26:19] it's typing Israel and he's typing us.
[26:22] Amen. But this invincible army that was
[26:25] laid dormant, laid dead in in his dry
[26:29] valley in Leia in denominational graves
[26:33] is now rising up. Amen. Yes, Lord. He's
[26:35] risen up. Amen. Through the mechanics
[26:38] that brought them up. Amen. And now with
[26:40] the mighty outpouring of the Holy
[26:42] Spirit, it'll be what? What will be the
[26:44] dynamics? The hard pouring of the Holy
[26:46] Spirit again. The refilling of the Holy
[26:48] Spirit. Amen. Yes. Amen.
[26:51] to bring her now to quick it comes with
[26:53] a quickening power. Yes. Amen. When
[26:55] she's positionally placed when the when
[26:58] the sons of God are positionally placed.
[27:00] Amen. When they positionally place and
[27:03] they come to mature spiritual maturity,
[27:06] now they can now rightfully access full
[27:09] authority of the word. Amen. Amen. Full
[27:12] authority and be a manifestation of the
[27:14] word on in his day. Amen. Yes, Lord. and
[27:18] exercise the authority of the father.
[27:21] Amen. Now you can conduct father's
[27:23] business. Amen. Amen. Now you can say
[27:25] I'm not about my own business. I'm about
[27:28] my father's business. Amen. Amen.
[27:33] What was the value of dry bones typing?
[27:35] It was a church without power. Church
[27:38] formal. A church dead. Dead in dry bones
[27:41] in little sea. Amen.
[27:44] representing a people who had lost the
[27:46] inheritance.
[27:48] Amen. That's what it is. Representing a
[27:50] people had lost
[27:53] everything. Ezekiel 37:2 says, "And God
[27:56] caused me to pass by them round about
[27:58] and behold, they were very many in the
[28:00] open valley, and lo, they were very
[28:04] dry." So, we know this was the fallen
[28:07] condition of Adam's race. Yes.
[28:09] Because what sinner did is strip mankind
[28:12] of power and dominion. That's what sin
[28:14] did to us. But God had a plan of
[28:17] restoration. Amen. Thank you, Lord. So
[28:20] what is the if you look at Ezekiel
[28:22] there, he's talking about prophesying
[28:26] again. Go back to the pro to the
[28:28] scripture
[28:31] there. Let's go to verse 9. Then he said
[28:35] unto me, "Prophesy unto the wind.
[28:38] Prophesy, son of man, and say to the
[28:40] wind, thus say the Lord God, come from
[28:44] the four winds, all breath, and breed
[28:47] upon these slain that they may live." So
[28:52] I prophesy as he commanded me. And the
[28:54] breath came into them, and they lived
[28:58] and stood up upon their
[29:00] feet, an exceeding great army. Amen.
[29:04] This army must be on their feet. This
[29:07] army must be about the father's
[29:08] business. Amen. Amen. This body, this
[29:11] army is not slack concerning the
[29:14] promises. This army is not slotful.
[29:18] Amen. This army is like the the the the
[29:21] one where God has given that person that
[29:23] person took the talents and and and put
[29:25] it and made great investments out of the
[29:28] talents. Amen. That was given to him.
[29:30] Amen. He brought forth a multiplication
[29:32] of the talents. Amen. Yes.
[29:36] So this is not thoughtful in the
[29:37] father's business. Amen. So you find
[29:40] that we're talking
[29:43] about the Holy Ghost restoring the sons.
[29:46] That's what the wind is typing. Amen.
[29:49] It's the Holy Ghost that's come now to
[29:51] restore the sons of God. Amen. Because
[29:53] we know the word was there. The
[29:55] mechanics was good enough. It was
[29:57] bringing the structure, placing you,
[29:59] bringing the body. Amen. But you had to
[30:02] have the move of the spirits.
[30:05] Amen. The mechanics alone is not good
[30:07] enough. You need the dynamics
[30:10] to hit the mechanics. Amen. To bring
[30:12] life into it. Amen. Amen. To bring it
[30:15] now to become manifested. Amen.
[30:20] So you find
[30:22] that we might have been stiff, starchy
[30:25] in our own ways of thinking. Amen.
[30:28] Denominational ways of
[30:31] thinking. But then the mechanics came
[30:34] and brought us into structure. Amen.
[30:38] But then he says, Ezekiel 37:9 said,
[30:40] "Then he said unto me, prophesy unto the
[30:42] wind, prophesy, son of man, say to the
[30:44] wind, thus say the Lord God, come from
[30:47] the four winds of breath and breathe
[30:48] upon the slain that they may live." What
[30:51] is that typing? The dynamics, the
[30:53] refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[30:57] Amen. Because we know there's two parts
[30:59] of this prophecy. Ezekiel 37:4 to8,
[31:02] which brought the bones together,
[31:04] forming a structured body, but it was
[31:06] lifeless.
[31:07] Right. The second part of the prophecy
[31:10] Ezekiel 37 9 and 10 which called the
[31:14] wind which entered the bodies and turned
[31:15] them into a mighty army. Amen. Into an
[31:18] invincible army. So we had the word all
[31:21] these years. We had the mechanics. But
[31:23] there was a season. Amen. There was a
[31:26] season when now the the prophet did his
[31:29] part. He went off the scene. But there
[31:31] was a season now. He said I'll run the
[31:33] trail again. The Holy Ghost come and
[31:35] ride the trail again. Amen. Amen. And it
[31:38] was the move of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[31:40] And it was happening all over the world.
[31:43] Like a mighty rushing wind. Amen. As the
[31:46] prophet said it would be. Amen. And we
[31:49] find the move of the spirit. Amen.
[31:51] Because why? We had the former rain
[31:54] which was the teaching rain. Now the
[31:55] latter rain. Amen. The former rain and
[31:57] the latter rain must come together.
[31:59] Amen. To bring what? The quickening
[32:01] power.
[32:03] To bring the quickening power in this
[32:04] body. So that now she can be this
[32:07] invincible army. She can go forth and
[32:10] prophesy again before nation, tongues
[32:13] and kings. Revelation 10 8-11. You must
[32:16] take your part. Amen. Yes sir. Because
[32:18] Revelation 10 1-7 was bringing this
[32:22] bringing the structure bringing the word
[32:24] structure for what? For Revelation 8:10
[32:26] and 11 for you and I. Yes. To come to
[32:30] our part. Amen. Amen. where the spirit
[32:33] comes again into his body. Amen. Whether
[32:36] the move of the spirit and who's leading
[32:40] who's leading this move the mighty
[32:41] angels have come down who was with
[32:44] Revelation 10:7 he's now with Revelation
[32:46] 108 and 11. Amen. Because why? The angel
[32:50] of God must lead the children of God. He
[32:53] said, "I will send my angel before you."
[32:55] Amen. Amen. And when you are led by the
[32:58] angel of God, that's the Holy Ghost that
[33:00] is leading you. Amen. Amen. And he's
[33:02] bringing you now to manifest your part
[33:04] of prophecy. Thank you, Lord. Amen. And
[33:07] you couldn't do it until you are to come
[33:10] in the age of adoption.
[33:12] You couldn't do it until sons of God had
[33:15] to come to maturity. Amen. Because why?
[33:18] This takes sons of man, son of man
[33:20] ministry again to prophesy. Amen. Amen.
[33:23] Thou must prophesy again before nation,
[33:26] tongues, and kings. Amen.
[33:29] This is a prophetic ministry. That's why
[33:32] this sons of God must have a prophetic
[33:34] voice again on the earth. Amen.
[33:38] Amen. So it shows that mechanics alone
[33:42] is not good enough. We must have the
[33:44] Holy Ghost to bring life and power.
[33:46] Amen. Amen. Others will kill the move of
[33:49] the spirit. That's right. We can be
[33:51] satisfied with word. We can be
[33:54] satisfied. We had the word. We had the
[33:56] opening of the word. Yes, we add the
[33:58] message of the hour that's come. We can
[34:00] be satisfied with that, but we don't mix
[34:02] the word with faith. What happens? Amen.
[34:05] He said the spirit, the letter, the the
[34:09] letter kill it, but the spirit giveth
[34:12] life. Amen. So you must have the move of
[34:16] the spirit to bring life to this word.
[34:19] Amen. So you operate this word in faith.
[34:21] Amen. Amen. And in this hour, a people
[34:24] that's rising up coming to perfect faith
[34:27] in this hour.
[34:29] Amen.
[34:33] In Acts 2 1:4, it says the Holy What
[34:35] happened in Acts 2 1 and4? We know the
[34:37] illustration there where the Holy Spirit
[34:39] came as a mighty rushing wind filling
[34:42] the believers. Amen. And what happened
[34:45] when they went out and wrote the book of
[34:47] Acts? Amen. They went out and great
[34:50] manifestation took place. Amen. Then the
[34:52] prophet says there'll be another book of
[34:55] acts. Amen.
[34:58] Let's go to that quote where he says
[35:03] that. He says, "Now remember this Christ
[35:07] in the true church is a continuation of
[35:10] the book of acts.
[35:13] But the book of revelation shows how
[35:15] that the antichrist spirit would come
[35:18] into the church and defile it." Yes.
[35:21] making it lukewarm, formal and
[35:23] powerless. So God don't like formal
[35:26] religion. He doesn't like powerless
[35:29] religion.
[35:31] Amen. God didn't give us a gospel that
[35:33] is powerless. Yes. Amen.
[35:37] He gave us a gospel that takes us out of
[35:40] cold letters.
[35:42] Dead letter formal letters. Amen. And he
[35:46] liberate us to the spirits.
[35:49] That's why he said the true worship
[35:51] worshippers shall worship in spirit and
[35:53] in truth. Amen. People that receive true
[35:56] freedom in this hour. A people that is
[35:58] liberated from denominational
[36:00] Amen. from all this uh denominational
[36:03] walls. Amen. The walls were broken down.
[36:06] Amen. That's why there'll be a people
[36:08] accepted say once more Lord. Amen. Let
[36:12] there be a move of your spirit Lord.
[36:14] Once more Lord. Amen. Let there be a
[36:17] mighty move of your spirit, Lord. If if
[36:20] there was a son of God in this day that
[36:23] stood there and said to the storm, "Be
[36:25] still."
[36:28] If there was a son of God that stood in
[36:29] this day and spoke squittles into
[36:31] existence. Yes. Yes. If there was a son
[36:33] of God in this day and said, "Little
[36:36] fishy, I give you back your life." Yes.
[36:38] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[36:41] Then then there must be a move of the
[36:44] spirit again into manifested sons of
[36:46] God. Amen. Y must prophesy again. Amen.
[36:50] There must be a move of the spirit in
[36:52] other sons of God. Mark 11:23. If you
[36:55] say to those mountain be thou removed.
[36:57] Amen. Amen. There must be a time and
[37:00] season for that. And it must be an
[37:01] opening this hour. Amen. I don't believe
[37:04] that God has brought us. You got to
[37:05] recognize the move of God and recognize
[37:08] the move of the spirit where he brought
[37:10] us. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[37:15] Cuz the prophet came to do his part and
[37:17] he's come into and he manifested the
[37:19] part where a son of God was brought back
[37:22] to Adam condition where he could speak
[37:24] to the killer bull. Amen. He could speak
[37:27] to the ons. Amen. Amen.
[37:30] When Adam was there, what was in Adam's
[37:32] original condition? He could say to the
[37:34] mountain, "You go there. You go there,
[37:35] tree. I want you in this." Eve doesn't
[37:37] like that mountain. It's blocking the
[37:39] view. Eve doesn't like that tree. It's
[37:41] blocking the view from the mountain. You
[37:43] go there.
[37:45] Adam could speak to that.
[37:47] We could have a son of God in this day.
[37:49] Yes. That could come and speak to the
[37:52] storm. Amen. Speak to the squirrels.
[37:54] Speak to the pool. Amen. Amen. So other
[37:58] sons of God must come. Amen. Amen.
[38:02] All nature is groaning for sons of God
[38:05] to come into manifestation. They've been
[38:07] waiting for this hour. Amen. This world
[38:09] cannot go on as normal. Amen. Sons of
[38:12] God needs to come into their position.
[38:15] Amen. Amen. Gospel must go back to the
[38:17] Jews. The gospel can't go back to the
[38:20] Jews as long as sons of God don't
[38:22] fulfill their parts. But we saying once
[38:24] more, Lord. Amen. Just like Samson. Once
[38:27] more, Lord. Amen.
[38:37] So you find he says here it exposes
[38:39] Satan revealing his
[38:41] works attempted destruction of God's
[38:44] people and a discrediting of God's word
[38:47] right down to the time he is cast into
[38:49] the lake of fire. He fights that he
[38:52] cannot stand it. He knows that if the
[38:55] people get the true revelation of the
[38:58] true
[38:59] church, what she is, what she stand for,
[39:03] and that she can do the greater works,
[39:07] she will be an invincible army. Amen.
[39:12] Amen.
[39:14] Amen. Once you were dead in
[39:18] divinations, sorry,
[39:24] denominations, but the greater work, she
[39:27] will be an invincible army if they get a
[39:30] true revelation of the two spirits with
[39:34] the framework of the Christian church
[39:36] and by God's spirit discern and
[39:38] withstand the antichrist spirit. Satan
[39:41] will be powerless before her. Amen. He
[39:44] will be as definitely twarted today as
[39:46] when Christ withtood this every effort
[39:49] to gain power over him in the desert.
[39:52] Yes, Satan hates revelation. But we love
[39:55] it. With true revelation alive, the
[39:58] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[39:59] it against us, but we will prevail over
[40:03] them. So you see the gates of hell
[40:05] cannot prevail against revelation. And
[40:08] therefore you find such a move of God
[40:09] now where there's such an opening, amen,
[40:12] of revelation where the word once we saw
[40:14] it dimly but now it's becoming more
[40:16] clearer to us. Where the Lord is opening
[40:19] all his resources. Amen. This
[40:22] inexhaustible fountain of life is
[40:24] becoming more clearer. You be begin to
[40:26] see your part of the prophecy. You begin
[40:29] you begin to see what the father
[40:31] requires of you. Yes. Amen.
[40:35] Praise God.
[40:41] Amen. So we know the the the mechanics
[40:44] represent the framework the word
[40:46] doctrine understanding of truth. Amen.
[40:49] That's what the mechanics is. Brought us
[40:51] into true doctrine. Unadulterated
[40:54] word took away every ism every every
[40:58] creed every dogma. Amen. Brought us into
[41:01] true doctrine. Amen. Amen. biblical
[41:03] doctrine where scripture must line up
[41:06] with scripture. Amen. Everything the
[41:08] prophet said must line up with the
[41:10] Bible. Amen.
[41:12] And the understanding of truth in his
[41:13] hour. What is the dynamics? It's the
[41:16] anointing of the spirit, the wind that
[41:18] gives life to what is already in place.
[41:21] So you it gives life to already the word
[41:23] that's already in you. It quickens that
[41:25] word with a quickening power and brings
[41:28] it into manifestation. Amen. Amen.
[41:30] That's why you say now if you say this
[41:32] mountain be thou removed, it shall be
[41:34] removed. Amen. That is the word. You
[41:36] took that same word and now you're
[41:38] operating that word with the spirit in
[41:40] you. Amen. It brings life to that word.
[41:42] Amen. Amen. When the Holy Ghost is in
[41:45] you and you have rightful claims to the
[41:47] redemptive blessings and you have come
[41:49] to a son that's now in maturity, now is
[41:52] standing as a mature son of God. Say now
[41:54] mountain you be thou removed. The
[41:57] obstacle in your life, the mountain in
[41:59] your life that you are facing this
[42:00] morning, you say, "Mountain, I stand as
[42:03] a manifested son of God in this hour.
[42:06] Mountain, you've been troubling me too
[42:08] long. You've been on my way too long,
[42:10] and now I want you to be removed." Amen.
[42:14] Yes, Lord. It must move. Thank you,
[42:16] Lord. It must obey. Thank you, Jesus. A
[42:18] son of God's voice. That's right. Amen.
[42:21] It must recognize a son of God's voice.
[42:24] Because when you are speaking, it is
[42:26] Christ speaking through you. Because
[42:29] why? What did Adam lose? He lost the
[42:31] Holy Ghost. So if the Holy Ghost is in
[42:34] you and speaking through you,
[42:37] that voice, that demon that you are
[42:40] challenging this morning must be
[42:42] removed. Hallelujah. Yes. Amen.
[42:46] That demon that's troubling your loved
[42:48] one, that demon that you stand in the
[42:50] gap for, it must be removed. If you
[42:54] stand as a son of God and said, "Demon,
[42:56] I am a son of God and I recognize my
[42:59] position according to the word of God. I
[43:02] know who I am in this hour." And demon,
[43:04] just like how when Jesus was here on the
[43:07] earth, he challenged you and you had to
[43:09] obey. Now as a son of God, I challenge
[43:11] you in the name of Jesus. I adore you in
[43:14] the name of Jesus to leave my family
[43:16] member. Yes. Amen. It must go. Amen.
[43:20] Because this bride in this hour is
[43:22] moving beyond mechanics into full
[43:24] dynamics of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Thank
[43:27] you for She wants to operate the word.
[43:31] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you,
[43:35] Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[43:40] Jesus said that those born of the spirit
[43:42] are like the wind. You can hear it but
[43:44] you cannot tell where it goes from.
[43:46] Amen. John 3:8.
[43:49] This
[43:49] means the Holy Ghost moves
[43:53] sovereignly beyond human
[43:56] control. Amen. We must be sensitive to
[43:59] the move of the spirit.
[44:02] Yes. Amen. We are sensitive to a lot of
[44:04] things.
[44:05] We need to desensitize ourselves to
[44:07] things of this world and be sensitive to
[44:10] the moving of the spirit. Amen. You got
[44:13] to understand the nature of the spirit.
[44:16] Understand the nature of God works into
[44:18] in continuation.
[44:21] Right? God works in continuation. And
[44:23] even your walk is
[44:26] progressive. God gives light as light is
[44:29] needed. Even our walk in the word, our
[44:31] knowledge of the truth, yes, is a
[44:34] progressive walk. You'll find that in
[44:37] certain season, God open up certain
[44:39] things, certain frontiers of the word
[44:42] that we never saw before. Yes. But he
[44:44] opens it up as light is needed. Didn't
[44:46] the prophet say that as light is needed,
[44:48] light will be given? Yes. And it become
[44:50] more clearer as it come to the coming of
[44:52] the Lord. It become more clearer. Amen.
[44:56] So that's what's happening now. So you
[44:58] find that you must be sensitive to the
[45:00] move of the spirit.
[45:02] If the spirit is taking you in a certain
[45:04] direction saying right, you are people
[45:06] that call out, you are people that need
[45:09] now to throw out the trash. You are
[45:11] people that I need to work with you. I
[45:14] need to use you. I need you completely
[45:16] surrendered. I need you to come into
[45:18] submission. Amen. You got to be
[45:20] sensitive
[45:22] because God has chosen you already. Yes.
[45:24] And he's not going to go and choose
[45:25] somebody else. Amen. He's chose you and
[45:27] he's been able to perform that which he
[45:29] has chosen. Amen. Amen. But you got to
[45:32] come to surrender. Amen. Amen. Yes,
[45:34] Lord. And you got to come into full
[45:36] submission because he wants to use you.
[45:38] Because why? God wants to do a mighty
[45:40] work through you. Amen. Yes. He's
[45:43] revealing the things to you because he
[45:45] wants to use you. Thank you, Lord.
[45:49] Amen. When he chose the children of
[45:51] Israel, he never choose them and said,
[45:53] "Okay, now that you disobeyed me, I'll
[45:56] choose another army." No, he chastised
[45:57] them when he needed to chastise them.
[45:59] And that's what will happen to you if
[46:00] you don't follow him. You will get
[46:02] chastisement.
[46:04] But he will wait for you to repent. If
[46:07] my people who are called by my name
[46:09] should humble himself and pray, repent
[46:11] of the wicked ways, I will hear the
[46:14] prayer and I will heal the land. Amen.
[46:18] So you got to be sensitive to the move
[46:20] of the spirits.
[46:23] Amen. Because why? He's keep filling you
[46:27] up, refreshing all the time. Amen. Week
[46:31] after week as you hear his word is
[46:32] becoming more clearer to you. Amen.
[46:34] Amen.
[46:39] So we know that the former rain was the
[46:42] word restoration which has come. Amen.
[46:46] But the letter in the spirit which is
[46:48] quickening the quickening power is right
[46:50] here. Amen. He's moving amongst us.
[46:52] Amen.
[46:54] Amen. Joel 223:25 God promised the
[46:57] former and letter rain in the same
[46:59] season.
[47:01] The final wind is blowing. Prepare the
[47:04] bride for what? For translation power.
[47:07] Preparing us to leave. Amen. From the
[47:10] earthly Amen. from this earthly
[47:13] dimension. Thank you, Lord. This
[47:15] dimension what you you you access
[47:18] through your five senses, but through
[47:20] the six sense. Amen. Amen. You're going
[47:22] to access another dimension. Amen. Amen.
[47:25] Through the heavenly dimension. Amen.
[47:29] Can you believe that? Yes. It's the word
[47:32] of God. Yes. Amen. Amen. You're going to
[47:34] defile everything. Amen. You're going to
[47:36] defile the laws of the earth. Amen. The
[47:39] laws of nature. You're going to defy all
[47:41] of that by changing from this dimension
[47:44] to
[47:45] another. Your mortal body. Amen. Which
[47:48] is the final part of our
[47:51] adoption. Amen. You can't go to the
[47:54] final part of your adoption if you're
[47:55] not coming to the other part of your
[47:56] adoption. Coming to a son of God in
[47:59] maturity.
[48:01] Amen. Where the Holy Ghost said, "This
[48:04] is my beloved son. Y him." Yes. If you
[48:07] haven't come to that part, how are you
[48:09] going to come to the final part? With
[48:10] the final part is the changing of the
[48:12] body. Amen. Then the Bible say we with
[48:15] we wait for the redemption of our body.
[48:19] Amen.
[48:22] Amen. So we're waiting for that part.
[48:25] You can't have faith for healing. The
[48:28] prophet said it again like this. He said
[48:30] you can't have they can't have faith for
[48:31] a
[48:32] toothache. How they going to have
[48:34] rapturing faith? Why why he said that
[48:36] was what is the final part? What is the
[48:39] rapture? Your body to go in the rapture,
[48:42] this body must be healed. Yes. Amen.
[48:45] Because from the time sin came in the
[48:48] garden of Eden, dead came in. In other
[48:51] words, you die daily. As you grow, you
[48:54] age, you're dying. Cells are dying.
[48:57] You're dying daily. But the redemption
[49:00] of the body is the final healing of this
[49:03] body where the body is totally healed.
[49:05] So you can't have faithful healing when
[49:08] people deny healing which is only a sign
[49:12] of how God is totally going to heal this
[49:14] mortal body. Amen. By changing it from
[49:17] mortal to immortality. Amen. Yet healing
[49:20] in the normal healing he that person
[49:23] gets healed is a temporary healing. But
[49:26] this healing is a permanent healing.
[49:28] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Because Lazarus
[49:31] at that time was raised up, but he still
[49:32] died. Yeah. Many people healed in the
[49:35] Bible, the the the man at the gate are
[49:39] beautiful. He was raised up from from
[49:42] from being a leper, but he died.
[49:46] Many other people in the prophets came
[49:48] meetings, they were healed, but they now
[49:50] gone. They're of the sin. That healing
[49:53] is temporal. But this healing,
[49:55] hallelujah. Amen. with this mortal body
[49:59] is going to be healed. Amen. But how
[50:02] it's how it's happening? The
[50:04] transforming power. Amen. By the
[50:07] quickening power of God through the
[50:08] word. Amen. The word that's in you right
[50:10] now is doing a transformation. The very
[50:13] word that you're eating of, the word
[50:15] that you're partaking of, Amen. that
[50:18] word is going to change the mortal body.
[50:21] Amen. Amen. Is going to be a total
[50:23] healing. Amen.
[50:26] Hallelujah. Because if we go on any
[50:28] longer, 20 years from now, many of us
[50:30] won't be here.
[50:32] But we have a promise. Amen. Even those
[50:36] that are gone on, they will be
[50:38] quickened. They will be they will be
[50:40] resurrected. Amen. We without them. We I
[50:44] mean they will be resurrected. We they
[50:46] won't uh they will come before us. Amen.
[50:50] We won't hinder them. We shall not
[50:51] hinder them that sleep. They will come
[50:54] first and then they and us will be
[50:57] quickened. Go
[50:59] [Music]
[51:01] together. So we find
[51:07] that Ezekiel's bones came together in
[51:10] Ezekiel's prophecy. These bones came
[51:15] together. They stood when the when the
[51:17] spirit came upon them. They they stood
[51:19] as an exceeding army.
[51:21] And we find right now what has
[51:23] prophesied that this bride will be an
[51:25] invincible army. She'll be a super
[51:27] church. She will be a super race in this
[51:30] hour when the move of God is here when
[51:33] the Holy Ghost is here back on his
[51:34] people. Amen. And the Holy Ghost is
[51:37] moving again. And you must know that the
[51:39] Holy Ghost is moving again because it
[51:41] comes with an anointing. And it's the
[51:43] anointing that breaks the yoke of
[51:44] bondage. Amen. Amen. You might have
[51:46] thought that you'll be in bondage
[51:47] sometime. The devil thought he can keep
[51:49] you in bondage, but you but it's the
[51:51] anointing that comes and breaks the yoke
[51:53] of bondage. That's why he said
[51:55] whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall
[51:57] be bound on heaven. Whatsoever you loose
[52:00] on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
[52:01] Amen. Amen. So you find there's a mighty
[52:04] moving of the spirit again. What it has
[52:06] done? It is now positioning us for the
[52:10] refilling. Amen. Positioning us,
[52:13] refilling us. So what? Christ can be
[52:16] manifested again. Christ in you, the
[52:19] hope of glory. That's what the world
[52:21] must see. Christ in you. Amen. That's
[52:25] why he said the greater works than
[52:27] these, yay shall do. Yes. That's right.
[52:30] Not the world will do. Greater works
[52:32] than this. He said y shall do. Yes.
[52:36] Because he left it for you. He left that
[52:38] other part for the body. Amen. Amen. He
[52:41] left that that part was for the body.
[52:43] Amen.
[52:45] That was for sons of God when they will
[52:48] receive title deed again when they will
[52:50] come back to the original condition
[52:52] again. The reason why they're going to
[52:54] do a greater works because Adam was no
[52:56] ordinary man.
[52:59] Amen. He was superior to everything that
[53:02] was created.
[53:04] Adam walked upon the earth an amateur
[53:06] god. Amen. Adam was a god to the animal
[53:09] world. He was a god to all creatures on
[53:12] the earth.
[53:15] Amen. He was a super race upon the
[53:17] earth. Amen.
[53:20] And that's what every son and daughter
[53:23] of God is upon the earth. You're walking
[53:25] in the earth right now when every mortal
[53:28] human being bound up by demon powers.
[53:32] Yes.
[53:34] Not knowing what is going on on the
[53:36] earth. Not knowing they're walking
[53:39] blindly. Not knowing they're walking to
[53:41] death.
[53:43] But you are superior to them because the
[53:46] Holy Ghost in you makes you a super
[53:50] race. Amen.
[53:53] And he never asked for an invisible
[53:56] soldier. He said an invincible soldier.
[54:01] He said an invincible army. Amen.
[54:05] In other words, it's not a one-man
[54:07] ministry now. It's not a oneman invasion
[54:10] now. Yes, sir. Amen. This is an
[54:14] exceeding great army. Yes. Doing the
[54:18] greater works.
[54:20] Amen. Manifesting Christ on the earth.
[54:23] Amen. So Christ will have a showdown
[54:26] right here in Satan Eden. Right here in
[54:29] Satan's Eden. Christ must have a
[54:31] showdown. Satan knew crept in God's
[54:34] Eden. God already knew that because
[54:37] God's plan was you are my boy. I'm going
[54:40] to be I have an attribute. My attribute
[54:43] is to be a savior. You're just a boy
[54:46] that I'm using. You're just a tool in my
[54:48] hand. But he thought he crept into God's
[54:50] hidden.
[54:54] But now an invisible union in Satan's
[54:59] Amen. An invis in sorry invisible union
[55:06] of the bride of Christ. Amen. And a
[55:08] union took place
[55:10] and this invis
[55:12] invincible invisible union. In this
[55:15] union, it produced what? Sons of God.
[55:19] Amen. It produced Christ again. Amen.
[55:23] Christ again upon the earth. Amen. Adam
[55:26] couldn't do that
[55:28] because Adam was growing in stature.
[55:31] But in this time to the second Adam.
[55:33] Amen. Amen. The one who conquered all
[55:36] things. Amen. The one who conquered
[55:38] dead, hell, and the grave. The one who
[55:41] who said where it was said, all power in
[55:44] heaven and earth is given unto him.
[55:46] Amen. Amen. Through him. Amen. Sons of
[55:51] God when the word is being preached now,
[55:53] spoken word, sons of God can come out
[55:56] through the preaching of the spoken
[55:58] word. Amen. Sons of God, come out. A
[56:02] manifestation in this hour. But you
[56:04] start off as a baby. You start off
[56:06] drinking the sincere milk. You start off
[56:08] by the new birth. Amen. And then you
[56:10] grow up in stature, stature of a perfect
[56:13] man. Amen. Growing up in higher
[56:16] dimensions of the Holy Ghost coming to
[56:19] maturity, exercising that full authority
[56:21] now where the father said, "This is my
[56:24] beloved son here in him. I give him full
[56:27] access. Whatever he says, obey him."
[56:30] Amen.
[56:32] Amen.
[56:34] Everything must obey the voice of a son
[56:37] of God. A son of God that's come to
[56:39] maturity in this hour. Amen. So there
[56:42] must be a final move of God. There must
[56:44] be a final outpouring of the spirit.
[56:46] Amen.
[56:50] A great exceeding army. Zechariah 4:6
[56:52] says, "Not by might, not by power, but
[56:56] by my spirit, say the Lord of hosts."
[57:02] Amen.
[57:05] Just like in Genesis 2:7 when God formed
[57:07] Adam, but he remained lifeless until the
[57:10] breath of God entered into him. So this
[57:13] bride having the structure becoming the
[57:16] body would have been lifeless until the
[57:18] refilling of the Holy Ghost comes in to
[57:21] bring life to the mechanics to bring
[57:23] life into all the word that you had. All
[57:25] the word that was in you now you are
[57:27] operating that words. Now you are
[57:29] bringing it to fulfillion.
[57:32] Amen. To flutation in this
[57:34] hour where you could walk now to the
[57:37] sick and say silver and gold have I none
[57:40] but such as I have I give unto you in
[57:42] the name of Jesus. Rise up from that
[57:44] condition. Yes. Amen. This is the hour
[57:48] he says shall we leap over walls. This
[57:51] is the hour where lips may put together.
[57:54] Amen. This is the hour where even if
[57:57] someone is gone, died, went of the sin,
[58:00] you'll be able to raise up the dead.
[58:02] Sons of God have come in this hour now.
[58:04] Amen. Amen. If it happened in any time
[58:08] in the Bible, it must happen again.
[58:13] Because it's the same Holy Ghost. Amen.
[58:18] Now we find that all this is happening
[58:20] under the power of the
[58:22] shout because the shout has come to
[58:24] quicken us. It comes with a quickening
[58:26] power. Amen. Just like how Mary I mean
[58:31] sorry mother go to call Mary. Amen.
[58:34] Bring her sister to echo the same words
[58:36] that Jesus said. Go and call her and
[58:38] tell her all that the master what the
[58:40] master is here. And we find that this
[58:43] power now this shout has power. that
[58:46] quickening power. How we could take the
[58:49] violent sinner.
[58:51] Amen. How we could transform his
[58:55] life that he could no longer desire to
[58:57] walk the way he used to walk. He no
[59:00] longer desires to live the way he used
[59:01] to live.
[59:03] And everyone thought that that person
[59:05] will never be changed. Everybody spoke
[59:08] evil of this person. Didn't want to come
[59:10] near this person. How can God take the
[59:12] violiner and transform them? the power
[59:15] of the shout. Amen. Amen. He does
[59:17] quickening power. Amen. Amen. Raise you
[59:21] from a dead system of this world and
[59:23] raise you back as a son of God. Give you
[59:27] raise you to your full potential. The
[59:30] shout, what's that? The message of the
[59:31] hour catching the living saints in this
[59:34] hour. Amen.
[59:37] What is the shout? It's a restoration
[59:38] message that awakens the bride and
[59:40] gathers them together. In other words,
[59:43] he gathered the bones from all the
[59:44] corners of the earth. He went around the
[59:47] world gathering all the bones, putting
[59:50] them in the rightful
[59:52] places. Maybe for a period of time,
[59:54] people came together and suddenly came
[59:57] up from a denominations and so forth and
[1:00:00] then you'll find that people say, "Hey,
[1:00:04] in the denomination I used to preach,
[1:00:07] that qualification doesn't qualify you
[1:00:09] here." Yeah. In the denomination, maybe
[1:00:11] this person had a loud voice and could
[1:00:13] speak nice elephant with words. He don't
[1:00:16] qualify you. Yeah. Amen. Yeah. The Holy
[1:00:18] Ghost comes and through this prophetic
[1:00:22] voice. Amen. He must put the bones in
[1:00:24] the rightful places. Amen. Amen. Yes.
[1:00:27] Amen. Maybe there's
[1:00:29] been ministries like that. People just
[1:00:33] coming out and saying that this person,
[1:00:35] okay, you can preach, you'll preach,
[1:00:36] carry on like that, but you're watched
[1:00:38] by the fruit. You shall know them.
[1:00:40] Right? So, but yeah, the bone must come
[1:00:43] bone upon bone upon bone. Amen. It must
[1:00:46] come fitly framed together.
[1:00:49] Amen.
[1:00:51] So, it gather, it awakens the bride and
[1:00:53] gathers the bones together. That's why
[1:00:55] Matthew 25:6 says, "And at midnight
[1:00:57] there was a cry made. Behold, the bride
[1:01:00] bridegroom cometh, go out to meet
[1:01:03] him." Amen. So we know there was a cry
[1:01:06] made firstly and then the bride had to
[1:01:09] be shut in with him. Amen. And when she
[1:01:12] was shut in with him, she come under the
[1:01:14] shikina glory. Where in the shikina
[1:01:18] glory it's a it's a world of endless
[1:01:22] possibilities because in the shikina
[1:01:24] glory did
