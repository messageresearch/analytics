want you to anoint your most holy faith this morning amen amen if you've got your voice on mute this morning i want you to turn the volume up this morning amen but put your phone on mute amen greetings in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ this morning amen it's a blessed day to be in the house of the lord amen another day closer to the coming of the lord how many of you are grateful for that amen and one of these days it will all be over in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen how many of you are satisfied in this flesh body that's getting old and wrinkly amen getting dim eye amen getting bald and all of these things that's associated with old age amen but there's a new body promised to the believer to the believer alone amen hallelujah amen we feel thankful amen to the lord amen we want to say we love you you say we who you talking about country is a personal pronoun it's me and the holy spirit in me we love you amen hallelujah you love one another amen turn around preach your brother and sister and say god bless you amen hallelujah no need to be stiff and starchy in the house of the lord where the spirit of the lord is being liberty amen there is freedom amen how many of you feel bound in your father's house when you go to visit your father [Music] amen some of you end up taking away more stuff from your father's house than you did taking into his house amen so this is father's house this morning amen and i hope you didn't come you're full this morning amen i'm if you came full but come empty out amen amen come amen with a pot big pot amen and take as much as the lord will give to us this morning amen hallelujah amen so if you've got our slideshow amen we can go to there this morning we'll be speaking we are more than conquerors hallelujah amen there's always an element to god that gives us more notice he didn't say we are conquerors he says we are more than conquerors there's been many men that have been labeled conquerors but this bride has the attributes of our husband and he says in romans 8 37 amen he says nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen watch where it's coming from now the original source conquering power is coming through him who loved us jesus wants you to know that you are loved this morning and because he loves you you are more than a conqueror amen you may be seated amen may the lord have blessings to the reading of his word amen hallelujah amen so we look at the definition of a conqueror and it's one who conquers one who wins in a country wins a country in war a sub-jews or he subjugates people and he overcomes an adversary amen that's what a conqueror is amen and the only reason that we are victorious in this life is like the scripture says it's through him that loved us amen our victory doesn't lie within ourselves [Music] it's not our own human ability but it's coming through jesus christ alone amen stop looking at one another's thoughts and mistakes amen amen hallelujah it is through jesus christ amen the love of god for his children is so vast and so deep and so far-reaching that god wants us to know that nothing can separate us from his great love for us amen amen hallelujah amen aren't you thankful for his great love amen hallelujah now we find here that the apostle paul uses the phrase of more than conquerors and it only appears in the new testament it refers to those who gain a great surpassing victory meaning that you are completely victorious amen more than a conqueror means that you are completely victorious it means the battle is already worn even though you don't see it with your physical eyes but through the supernatural eye the battle is already won amen it means gaining a surpassing victory completely victorious and to carry away and overwhelming victory amen let me break it down for you more than a conqueror meaning that you didn't win in overtime [Music] you don't win by one point it wasn't fought me hello [Music] amen the score wasn't 4-3 overwhelming victory means you gave them 28 mil and like we use that term you guys know what i'm talking about when your team wins what you say we gave them a hiding yeah and that's what we are we are giving the devil the hiding of his life amen all right amen in this change we are giving the devil the hiding of his life amen one time the husband kicked him and slapped him laying hell now the wife is following suit amen took him out of your house he came out of your children amen claim the victory in jesus name you are more than a conqueror don't let satan come and rule your family you are the head of their family take authority stand on the word of god amen hallelujah amen now we know throughout history there have been many empires amen many people who have conquered in their time the lord showed us amen through prophet daniel's vision that there would become four kingdoms do you remember the dream that king nebuchadnezzar had there will be four kingdoms amen hallelujah amen i'd like everybody to be in the service if there's somebody outside i want them all to come into the service there's enough room in the cross here amen there's not an overflow amen with the same submission if anyone's right around please bring them back into the service amen amen participation can you please check amen throughout history there's been many empires yes amen the babylonian empire amen and you remember you were shown this image that's right amen have we got a picture of the image there the babylonian empire the media persian empire the greece and empire and the roman empire amen these four kingdoms will rule the world until the time until the end time until another kingdom is being brought upon the earth amen men like nebuchadnezzar like darius like alexander the great amen hallelujah men like napoleon men like hitler were regarded as conquerors [Music] amen they conquered the world in certain stages of their journey but their victory did not last why amen all of them were victorious for a time for a season but they were not over able to overcome themselves they were not able to overcome the human weakness and each one of them had flaws that led them to be defeated [Music] what is that teaching us we need to overcome ourselves in this battle we need to die to self amen but there is one man who came and he conquered everything that was on the earth and everything that was in hell amen this man at the age of 33 years old amen he became not just a conqueror but he became a great and a mighty conqueror [Music] the man i'm talking about is none other than our lord jesus christ amen this is no ordinary man amen he was prophesied to come in the book of messiah as i said unto us his son is born unto us a child is given amen and his name shall be called counselor amen he is not called counselor for nothing counsel with the lord you're going through a situation seek the great counselor amen he is the prince of peace your trouble in mind go to the prince of peace amen amen hallelujah he is the mighty god there is no true mighty god there is only one mighty god amen the everlasting father amen amen this was god in flesh hallelujah amen god and morphe himself amen hallelujah amen now the greatest enemy that man faced and still faces today is an enemy called them amen there's one thing you can cannot escape if the lord carries amen and that is death amen one thing we cannot escape we got an appointment the bible says it's the point of man wants to live amen and then too don't be scared because we see death through different eyes yes you remember pastor clive came and preached and he said i want to make death seem silly to you amen hallelujah we are more than conquerors amen don't care amen what satan can do to the flesh yes but we have eternal life amen we have passed from death and to life amen amen so jesus changed our destiny our destiny was hell amen we were guilty of sin amen we were bound for hell but christ our redeemer died on the cross he died for the sinners and paid all his dues amen hallelujah christ paid with his own blood glory amen he didn't have to do it jesus didn't have to do it amen but the prophet says love constrained him amen that's what it was he says love in his great bosom went out to adam's fallen race and redeemed them through his son christ jesus amen he says look notice this god falls through the bride in the group watch the mystery now he's preaching this it is the rising of the sun 1965 he is telling you that god foresaw the bride in the groom god saw you in jesus christ amen amen he said see to save his wife like adam he had to go with her yes adam knew what he was doing he didn't know what she was doing but adam walked out with his wife and jesus took his wife's place amen jesus took your place amen and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place amen he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what in love what a fellowship what a joy divine leaning on the everlasting arms he says how can we deny it how can we do anything but love him friend amen amen somebody say amen christ died in your place amen sometimes we have taken that for granted sometimes we worry too much amen that we do not value our salvation amen but i want to tell you in another colloquial job this morning catch you wake up this morning amen amen and smell the coffee this morning smell the roses whatever you need to smell but realize what jesus christ has done for us amen amen hallelujah looks like some people have passed out along the journey you know what happened when people faint they put a strong chemical in front of their nose some of you probably know the name i don't not chloroform now the devil uses colorful smelling salts smelling salts you heard that and then the person wakes up that's what we come to do in the house of the lord this morning you probably walked in like a zombie here this morning yes praise god the souls are going to be spread this morning amen i'm going to be throwing salt from the purpose amen and we don't deal with so small salt here you know how they get salt from big salt right they break it down we're throwing rough salt this morning amen so keep your mouth open some of you are lacking salt you know if you lack salt there's a problem in your body so open your mouth every time you say amen i'm going to throw salty amen amen amen hallelujah amen and he said jesus went to calvary one day how many of you know amen that jesus went to calvary amen and there on the cross once and for all he settled the same question yes amen right he conquered the greatest enemy that man ever had yes he conquered death once and for all that's why death is no more fearful for us yes amen we don't do not have to wonder what lays within the next dimension we know that when we close the eyes and breathe our last breath we step into a new body a better body a slimming body a man a perfect body amen you got a missing tooth there here you're gonna have full set of teeth there hey manny manny man start to remember how you used to comb your hair because one day you're gonna get a full set of hair again yes amen hallelujah amen throw away your clothing your short dresses amen and your tight clothing because brother branham says when he went there their garments were flowing down to the ankles didn't run and look for sewing machines and alteration oh man like you're being poured into a sausage you know what vienna is they pour that liquid into that skin and they seal it you know when you sit too you're like i don't want to show you that you know how they sit amen then now there's a wall going on with the seams it's a wall of the seams you hear it from now and again amen let's keep the message pure let's get back to message standards amen hallelujah men throw away your shorts amen hallelujah my brother but we in the what age why are you preaching this thing because i see you don't know your abcs not all of you now to whom it is required we don't know your abc's we're sending you back to great art we're sending you for an assessment you know when you uh sometimes they cancel your driver's license and they reset you for your test yes amen don't let the holy spirit find you out you come to church when you feel like some of us made up our mind we put you know when you when you go don't go to work you have to put in a leave form some have already submitted the leave form for the rest of their lives lord you will never find me in church on a wednesday that's the truth because if it was so that you're missing just one service or maybe you were working then you find them in other times but some i put permanent leave and i want you to know it's unpaid leave yes and god is going to hold you accountable for that you imbreach your contract you know what your employment contract is you in breach of contract and you know what's even worse when you don't inform management amen imagine brother ramesh when is that actually taking place on what day what day possibly a wednesday hey imagine everyone is flying away i fly away and then you seeing the believers flying away and you say holy spirit wait for me is the way you came from i never saw you for the last five years i wonder if if the rapture was based on church attendance how many of us will make it right but thank god it's not based on church attendance amen hallelujah amen why can't we serve the lord better why can't we do remember what that word was more than conquerors why we always want to do less for the lord the least bit we can do just to get by amen god is not a problem amen why don't we give more amen more of ourselves more time more energy more effort into the things of god amen because faith without words his death amen hallelujah amen so with his own blood amen he was so anointed with the power of god that god raised him up triumphantly from the dead amen and he tore down the dominion of satan amen amen he went to the lowest parts of the earth and he was raised to the highest of heavens amen he is the undisputed undefeated champion of love amen one time this champion didn't even have a time to be placed to be born amen or place to die the place where he was born was a border place and the place where the lady's body was a borrowed place amen he said foxes have old and the birds have nests but the son of man had nowhere to lay his head amen hallelujah amen but then god after he resurrected him he said he exalted him so high and gave him a crown and a name above every other name amen one of these days the atheists are going to find out that there is a god and they are not excluded from bowing their knees the bible says every knee shall bow amen amen and every tongue confess that jesus his lord amen i appeal to you this morning don't let that be the first time that you confess he is lord amen if god has given you breakfast morning amen say lord jesus you are my lord amen some of us have never expressed ourselves yes amen this is your father's house we are not going to judge you if you say amen we are not going to look at you funny if you say praise the lord in fact we look at you funny and we think that something is wrong with you spiritually when you stay quiet yes amen yes amen i want you to know because every place you go to has a code of conduct you go to the bank here there's a code of conduct you go to school there's a code of conduct and in the house of god god likes some rowdy people everywhere jesus went there was some noise god's like some amens god like some hallelujahs amen amen you'll be surprised you don't even need the pastor to pray for you you say amen the devil will leave you glory amen people say what if something possesses this guy now i thought i was possessing him now another spirit has possessed him the holy spirit amen [Applause] amen he's the mighty conqueror and he stands in his domain this morning he stand in his domain forever nobody will ever stoop jesus of his domain in fact the bible says the kingdoms of this world will be shaken the kingdoms of this world are going to be crumbled amen he's that stone that was cut out without hands and he's coming to smite all the kingdoms of the earth don't build your foundations on sinking sand first corinthians 15 this is where the apostle paul is telling us oh death it sounds like he's mocking death oh dear where is thy sting yes now if you're not south african you won't know what that means hey grave where is your victory because the person is not in the grave he's laying down his coats amen amen the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law now don't give sin strength you know how you give sin strength by embracing the law yes kill sin by embracing grace grace come to do away with the law christ was the epitome of grace and he said i come to magnify the law amen and he extended grace to everybody he met he says thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ you see where the victory is coming not of our own strength amen hallelujah jesus tore every veil amen jesus tore every veil and defeated the enemy he stripped him off his powers jesus the mighty conqueror rent the veil of the temple in two the bible says from top to bottom amen and also the veil of sin was mentioned too the veil of sickness was 22. amen he says the veil of sickness was real because he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for iniquities and by his stripes we were healed amen amen he tore through that veil of worry this morning why are you worried this morning don't let satan whisper to you amen amen you shouldn't even be able to hear satan's whisper why he should never be able to talk to you from an elevator point of view because where is he supposed to be under your feet supposed to be down there now you can hear that voice why are you not looking at me you're acting like you've got your nose in the air hey you're ignoring the devil and he's telling you all his little lies he's telling you all you can't make it you're a sinner you remember your past thank you lord you remember what you've done thank you man you think you you're not forgiven wait till you get to the judgment throne finish with you then you forgot the prophet says the camera is going to play all what you're going to do boy no come with me in my kingdom i don't give you judgment i say come as you are remain as you are satan comes to bring fear doubt condemnation amen but god is going to tear down that worry yes the bible says you put your sin in the sea of remembrance thank you jesus hey forgetfulness then why do you remember every time what you did do you know how your thoughts played you every day you singing when i remember what i have done i wonder if i can be saved he put it in the sea of forgetfulness amen hallelujah amen you remember that that old man that was reading that geography book past ronnie took a picture of but you know he had a sense of humor let me show you that picture so you've got a geography book and he took a picture with that because he always just referred to that story this lady was getting some visitors home and the father was always saying hallelujah praise the lord because he was always reading the bible and she said dad when my friend comes now i don't want you to embarrass me you know daughters can get embarrassed about their fathers i want you to be on your best behavior just for this time that she's here yeah and don't read the bible take this geography book and go up in the attic and read it so she go he goes into the attic and he's looking through this geography book and this girl is there entertaining a friend and suddenly she hears like a rumble upstairs foot tapping and a hallelujah and i praise the lord she runs up the steps and says daddy what's going on it was a geography book i told you don't embarrass me she said he says hey honey look here in the bible it says they can't find the bottom to the sea amen this is where jesus must have put my sin amen they can't find the bottom glory hallelujah aren't you thankful that he can't find your sin amen you are sinless you are perfect you are spotless now the other 10 give god praise amen let's give the lord a good handcuff of praise amen hallelujah amen this is what the prophet of god says anything that satan put upon you in the way of sickness or whatever it is you every born again person as an abstract warrant from god amen you know the arresting officer must have a warrant otherwise it's an illegal arrest amen but the warrant of arrest came down in revelation 10. he came to give you the arrest warrant for the enemy and he says the holy spirit is here to put any devil out yes that's right no matter if he is cancer for the son man i want you to put your situation in whatever it is the holy spirit is here to do what put that devil out he says whatever it is the holy spirit will put him out if you serve notice on him in the name of christ jesus don't sit with a warrant and not execute the warrant say well i'll see how fire will go sin will take your father then you want to go amen amen it'll make you stay longer than you want to stay and it'll make you pay more than the price you want to pay and how many of you know what the wages of sin is death amen he says serve him notice because he has no legal right i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases is that right he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we are here but you've got to go over and take it amen you've got to go over and take it amen hallelujah aren't you glad that jesus broke every power of the enemy amen what did he do god made a search light from heaven and he started to point that searchlight on the earth and he's hunting down and defeating every principality and every power that is coming against you amen amen he tore down and spoiled everything that satan had the prophet goes on to say in the mighty conqueror he is the mighty conqueror his dominion is from everlasting to everlasting his delegates are those who love him are you one of these delegates the saying his delegates are those who love him amen amen and are willing to die for him he raised he has raised from the dead this morning and living amongst us that's present tense amen do you believe this amen hallelujah now we're talking about a mighty conqueror now we said a conqueror most of the time they it's fought in a battlefield and they overcome a war amen so the mind was the battleground of the soul amen the slideshow should be easy because i've set it up amen all you have to do is press the next arrow amen the mind of the battleground is the soul the mind is the battleground of the soul amen and the first battle that was ever fought was what where preached me this morning was 14 heaven amen when michael and his angels fought against lucifer yes someone said online hey guys brothers sisters come on now amen the first battle was fought in heaven amen i can see where your mind is this morning amen someone stream online now sin also did not originate in the earth it originated in heaven it's in his unbelief amen and it was cast out of heaven we showed you our revelation 9 that is cast out again that star falling from heaven and he says felon who human beings amen then the battle move from angels to human battles these battles that you're facing it's different powers oppressing you amen 200 million demons let loose from the river euphrates amen satan come to destroy god's creation he wasn't happy about what was going on in eden so he came to destroy god's creation and the battle began on earth and the battle has been raging ever since now the prophet says here any battle can be put in a raid they first have to choose the place where the battle is to be fought and he says the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle because decisions are made in the mind that is where satan meets you you've got to make your choice now i i want to break this down because it's not always just spiritual battles that satan gets you through he's not always going to fight you like you know through the preaching of the word like you're always studying the message and he's going to fight you with this doctrine and that doctrine he's going to affect your natural life he's going to introduce you to the wrong type of girl but decisions are made where some men go mental when they meet a girl they can't think anymore some women go mental amen you know many people have ruined their lives like that right so watch out satan can get you because if they can get you defeated in your five senses and in your spirit he is attempting to bring doubt and fear into your soul so he gets you through other ways he gets you through sickness amen he gets you a man through in fighting in the home husband and wife conflict children and and parents conflict what is he doing he's watching your case watching your case and if you cannot identify that this is the enemy he is going to defeat you because that situation is going to consume you and you know what's going to happen to the ramesh they're going to eat the water and like that frog in that bathtub as the water is heated up the situation around you becomes normal that seeing that person in sin becomes just a normal thing it doesn't affect you anymore amen amen we compromise with sin and unbelief the prophet didn't compromise with bully paul he told him as long as you're living that kind of life you cannot live in this house take your things and humber amen no but we want to nurture sin we're not concerned about the salvation of that person's soul amen but where he says here the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle because decisions are made in the mind there is where satan meets you and you've got to make your choice amen i want you to know that we are not in a cold war with the enemy this is a hot wall you know what hot water means you've got troops on the ground yes you've got battle ships there amen you got these tanks on the field you got every artillery you got atomic warfare if you need it but the battle is hot and heavy at the end time because all hell is poured out upon the earth the bible says that hell followed that fourth horse rider his name was dead and hell followed him amen the prophet father goes on to say he says all hell is poured out on the earth and he says as much as hell is poured out on the earth all heaven is come down with the captain of the host amen the mighty angel descending come to set the battle in the rain amen this is not a cold war where we apply sanctions on the devil stop applying sanctions yes satan if you leave me alone with a stinger stop negotiating with this terrorist we do not negotiate with the enemy amen hallelujah and another thing in the battle that's hot and heavy you must be dressed for war you can't come here casual we are not on a picnic amen hallelujah amen no time for casual dress in a time of war you have to have the correct armor you have to have the correct armor for your protection the army is given for your protection you must be trained for combat amen and we know in this day the right armor was given to us amen and the right training was given to us ephesians 6 and verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places [Music] wherefore take unto the whole armor of god that you might be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand he says stand there for having your loins good with truth and having the breastplate of righteousness yes take your righteousness that's your breastplate amen it's not your righteousness but it's god's righteousness because our righteousness is like filthy red but take the righteousness of god and put it as a breastplate amen he says your feet short with the preparation of the gospel and take your shield of faith yes amen faith is a shield amen and you are able to quench the fiery death of the wicked amen and the helmet of salvation salvation is a helmet wait well amen the devil likes to take head shots but where salvation is your helmet amen amen hallelujah and he says here the sword of the spirit the holy spirit is the sword he's not talking about any other spirit there but he's talking about the holy spirit the holy spirit that possesses you is a sword amen amen hallelujah which is the word of god amen and not only having the old armor you need to now equip that armor you are now dressed for battle and he says start the engine how are you going to start the engine praying always praying when i get time praying always afraid in the evening praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit pray in your office you walk past uh you're talking to me now just then i stop and ask you are you talking to me no no i was just praying oh okay the walk past who are you talking to are you gonna cook us no just praying to god amen praying always amen he says and supplication in the spirit watching there and too with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints not only when you're equipped with the armor not only do you have prayer as a weapon amen but god has anointed us for the battle like david was anointed for the battle we are anointed in this hour the bible says now which he which established us with you in christ and has anointed us is god god has anointed us amen so we are victorious this morning because the captain of the host is here with us and nothing shall be able to stand with you all the days of your life only being our strong and courageous joshua being our strong and courageous being conqueror being a conqueror this morning requires courage you cannot go into battle being scared you know what's going to happen you're going to be a deserter and we have many of them you'll see them on youtube why i left the battle they use another word called message then hey why i left the battle i was bi i thought are you throwing some africans [Music] hey so he deserted his fellow brethren amen but being a conqueror requires courage and you are courageous this morning because you are staying with a message in spite of all the adversity in spite of all the criticism you have courage this morning to stand with the truth amen yes amen glory to god amen you must have endurance in this battle amen the battle is not worn overnight you must run the race with patience the bible says amen but i want you to know there'll be days when you you will feel like giving up yes there'll be days you don't feel like picking up your sword amen come on now let's be real yes there'll be days hey man you don't want to go on fighting you know you just want to give up and throw in the towel amen there'll be days of disappointment in your life your strength may be failing you days you don't feel like praying amen am i talking to some real people here there are days you don't feel i pray amen hallelujah this day you don't feel like reading the bible amen this you don't want to hear that sermon from that pastor you are discouraged you are depressed you feel like the world is closing in on you sickness got you to a point where you question whether your life is worth living yes but my message to you this morning is don't give up amen amen you may be feeling knocked down you may be battle scarred you may be weary wounded soldier this morning but you are not dead you are breathing your lungs amen amen recruitment is coming special forces amen reinforcements are on their way amen your your troop may have been blown up amen people may have deserted you all men of man may be against you but you are still alive god has you your free purpose amen encourage yourself in the lord like david did amen and if you need help get back up if you are defeated in the battlefield and maybe you're falling down face down to the ground ain't mad but you can hear the enemy advancing i want you to know gather all the strength that is within you amen and get back up amen and call for some reinforcements the bible says call the elders of the church amen when you are sick when you are discouraged the bible says call the elders of the church amen don't fight your battles alone call some reinforcements amen amen glory amen many many men because greater is he that is in me who greater is he that is in me for greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world greater is he that is in me oh greater is he that is in me for greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world now god doesn't only heal through his word the prophet says he heals through music he heals through medicine amen he heals through nature he'll use the birds the singing of the birds to calm your nerves amen amen when the husband is working on your nerves and you feel like you can't bear it alone amen oh man no brother pat was preaching wednesday and he was talking about that woman was throwing the egg on the wall you remember the one who said must jesus bear the cross alone and i was telling you that the only thing you can throw at your wife is money but not coins that she won't mind amen but greater is he that is in you amen i want you to know that working on one another's nerves is a normal thing it's not reason for divorce that's the one person when you said your vows you said i will annoy her and him forever and you're both signed that you will agree to the terms and conditions and the terms and conditions will answer dead to your part amen but the bible says don't let the sun go down amen upon your wrath upon your anger amen now if he is mercies to us are you every morning then maybe you went to bed angry because you couldn't follow that scripture but when you wake up in the morning have new mercies upon one another amen so greatly is he that is in you the situation that you're going through is temporary amen god wants to be glorified through that trial amen amen hallelujah he will not give you more than you can bear amen more than you can overcome but will with the trial he will make a way of escape for you amen and his strength is made perfect in your weakness you say lord i'm too weak for this then let his strength overtake you amen he is the reason we wake up in the morning amen so praise him through every trial praise him through every circumstances praise him before you see the results amen praise him before you see the path to victory amen praise him like you have already received it this morning amen and what shall separate you from the love of god romans 8 35 says who shall separate us from the love of christ and he says tribulation will not separate you amen hallelujah distress will not separate you persecution will not separate you salmon will not separate you nakedness peril sword cannot separate you from the love of christ he says i am persuaded that neither death can't separate you life can't separate you angels can't separate you principalities powers nor things present your current situation cannot separate you amen hallelujah no any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god he says no things to come no ice no depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord amen he fortified us the prophet goes on to say now we're moving very quickly now amen the prophet says he gave man one thing to be fortified around and that's his word amen he gave man nothing else but his word to fortify themselves around but man got away from the word in hebrews 4 12 it says the word of god is quick yes yes hallelujah you ever watch these uh old western movies and you know that gunslinger how many of you like to clinch used to it yes amen come on now i want some real talk here i'm thinking i'm gonna give the game away uh those gun slingers the first one quick on the draw amen i want you to know that the word of god is faster than that amen the word can go and annihilate the enemy you're not even there but the spoken word can go ill centurion servants it's quick it's powerful it's sharper than what the bible says sharper than any two-edged sword piercing to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit amen amen and the joints of the marrow oh that's a sharp blade penetrate the bone weighing into the metal i don't feel like marrow bone you know what i'm talking about then penetrating through that bone and it's the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen we were talking about that last night around the dinner table how the holy spirit can speak through the minister and discern the thoughts of the people you'll be thinking why is the pastor saying that you'll be even resenting what he's saying amen but the spirit is working amen amen now let's recap we said that we are more than conquerors we have the overwhelming victory god gave us the armor right god gave us the dress where now what is god's dress fear for the church amen the prophet breaks us down he says god fortified his army with what himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was god doing listen did you ever think what that offices of the church is it's god's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer foresee before satan ever gets to do it now you see why if you don't subject yourself to the fivefold you won't have keen eyesight amen because the prophet is saying that the fivefold sees it even before satan can do it so what is the pastor he's a protector of his sheep amen he will tell you don't go down that avenue stay in this pasture watch now it gets beautiful he says what is it god dressed up in his church these offices is god's stress with amen so you see why we should respect the office he says it's god's dress with when you see those officers pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's god's dress where what she breaks it down god's presence god's spirit working through man now i advise you to please respect the office yes amen amen respect these officers yes listen to what he's saying it's god's dress sweet it's god's presence amongst his people because what avenue has he chosen mechanical devices no he has chosen man so he says god's spirit walking through man and if that offers denies any of this word then it's not god's dressing yes right that's what he says it's wolf in sheep's clothing right watch what he says now he says in things that are to be this is one of the late messages before he goes off the scene he says as i'm getting old and as i go along the road that this young fellows will come up and take this gospel in a less powerful way than it is now what is he saying there's that word again more more than conquerors but uh play the tapes i'm playing the tape now i'm reading the tape back to you i'm reading the tape back to you because sometimes some people don't listen they listen too fast or they listen too slow but when you read it let me read it again for jeffersonville amen this young fellows will come up to take this gospel in a more powerful way [Music] and the enemy comes god will drop the standards you see what time we're living in brother joshua the standard is higher now here's a property in things that have to be one of his last messages that he's going to preach he's saying as the generations go have we had a few generations come by and the enemy comes in god keeps raising the standard higher and higher and higher pass the first pull second pull into the third pool until finally we'll meet with christ [Music] amen so let's stay with what the prophet said amen amen he says here in things that are to be so that was in birth pains now he says these men if they pick up this and goes out with it they can make less sense to it there's a word again they'll make more sense to it see now what he's he's got an expectation for the young man that's following him he says to take it to a place to a higher level i just want to lay the fruits what is he laying so can we say that brother brandon lays the seed and who is he relying on to bring it to life then all they yes now the day movement i'm part of the day they make it come to life amen the prophet laid the seat the fight for ministry brings you to life yes amen you can't make the prophet alive amen amen now we're going to close now we spoke about conquering the enemy we spoke about conquering and overcoming your situation overcoming your sickness overcoming your trial overcoming worry overcoming depression there's another fellow you must overcome brother branham calls him the greatest enemy who's there overcome yourself enemy number one the fresh man he says what is the meaning of conqueror of self to conquer yourselves means to dominate and take control of the difficulties you face brother goes on to say now i've often said the greatest enemy i got is william branham he is the one that gets in god's way amen put your name there now the greatest enemy is yourself amen he is the one who gets in god's way god is driving and you say hey give me the steering wheel here god gone right you're saying hey i want to go left he is the one who gets what lazy he is the one that gets to play sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves god right out of the picture but when i can get rid of that guy when i can get to the place where he's out of the way then god can come over and do the things that william graham knows nothing about two things that adrian gender knows nothing about two things that ramish mabia knows nothing about if we can get out the way yes what am i saying overcome yourself get over yourself amen amen god wants to take control then when that's when god can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot he says that's what every man needs is a loss of himself yes amen loss of ability loss of what he said that he might have complete healing to the holy spirit he says the housewife needs that the school boy needs that he says even our little children amen now you gotta know that you gotta fight for every inch of ground amen you gotta fight for every inch of ground that you have amen every man in here that's born of the spirit of god knows you have to fight for every inch of ground to tow the mark with satan isn't that right friends this is not a picnic this is a battleground we should never come here to eat cookies and so forth we're in a battle we've got to defend our god-given rights amen what god said it's ours let's stand right toe to toe with satan they're ours we believe them you might as well move back because you haven't got nothing at all satan hasn't got one legal rights of anything everything he's got is defeated and the only thing is a scarecrow amen he cannot bother you a man that's born of the spirit there's nothing at all that can harm him [Music] the bible says in isaiah 54 17 that no weapon formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall raise up against the v in judgment thou shalt condemn now let's close with this when god shed his blood on calvary the prophet says jesus christ in a deposit box at calgary to heal all men of sickness and disease we draw in closing now with this checkbook you know in most companies they have two signatories right you'll normally have the financial manager and you'll have another person the dealer principal in my case will have two signatories at any work in your environment amen so there's a check there's accountability so he's saying that jesus signed his part with his blood and he left the other part for you to sign yes he says anything that was included in the atonement is the personal property of every believer so don't wander around like you have and you own nothing he said everything in the atonement is your personal property god has given you the victory just believe with all your heart that god is going to pour the holy spirit upon you now amen glory and fill every soul in here with the baptism he promised it when a man is born again of the spirit of god god gives him a checkbook that will last him all through life's journey amen it's not only one he's giving you an open check book each one signed amen to last you through life's journey he says at the bottom of every check has got jesus name signed to it you just have to fill out any redemptive blessing it's yours it's already paid for now surely you're not afraid that it won't be cash amen he's good for you amen if you're afraid you just hold back the book in your pocket will you accept it for you know he's the high priest of your confession he's at the right hand of the father to make a decision for anything that you confess he's done it's all yours the checkbook is in your brother's hand the checkbook is in your hand everything that heaven owns is yours somebody received that everything that evan owns is yours amen you amen the checkbook is in your hand everything ever knows is yours you've got a checkbook the only thing you have to say is i believe it i assign my name to it it's mine get right on believing it testifying about it and you'll get well it's yours believe it god and the obligation to send it to you jesus name is signed at the bottom whatever you desire believe that you receive it and you shall have it what a wonderful promise amen now we're dealing with more than a conqueror i want to close with a story now you remember this boxer amen you know this great boxer he's a heavyweight boxer amen and he's fighting and he's training amen and and people amen don't believe in demon powers today but you are in a battlefield and you are like this boxer that's training amen you got to know your enemy the boxer knows his enemy he chooses his opponent and then he trains for that contest amen he knows the date he's going to meet him amen you know the battleground where you're going to meet him right we just spoke about it your mind amen you know you got to train for the contest one thing's for sure there's a set date you're gonna meet him so you start to train you wake up four o'clock in the morning and you do a marathon you're praying hey man that boxer is training what is he doing when he's running what is he trying to build up endurance he's trying to build up endurance so that he doesn't get tired in the ring he can last all 12 rounds amen hallelujah amen and you know he studies his opponent any good fighter will study the opponent he'll watch footage of that fighter amen he studies his licks he knows where he fights from whether he's assault poor or whether he's orthodox amen hallelujah whether he's baptist whether he's methodist whether he's catholic he knows what angle that sermon is coming from amen whether he leans forward whether he hangs back a smart fighter you get a sparring fighter that fights just like that opponent hallelujah he studies everything if he's a good smart fighter the prophet says he will get inspiring partner that fights just like that opponent amen for you'll know all the licks amen and he says there's a good thing now there's a quote here he says a good thing for a christian to do now if you want to start training you got to walk with your jab now right you know the first thing is your jab you keep jabbing jabbing jabbing and you set him up for the hook okay he says start now jabbing john 3 16 jeff jeff john 3 16. how many of you know what john 3 16 is can you recite it yes okay recite in your mind amen john 3 16 the golden rule start right out with that and then you'll get on the floor now then you got to work on your leg movement fly like a butterfly sting like a bee you know who said that yes hey okay for the young people don't know that there was a good heavyweight boxer called muhammad ali cassius clay a man knows how to fight leg movements amen you gotta know now fight hey i'm not sure to entertain you come on we're closing now amen and he says you gotta train now for the knockout punches amen you gotta train for the knockout punch because you're going to have to use them hey man everyone knows that you have to train to hit the enemy i feel sorry for the guy i just um you gotta try to knock him out some of us need to get angry with the devil true amen amen amen amen train for the knockout punches he said everyone knows this you have to train to hit the enemy god uses his word we must remember that god uses his word to defeat the enemy if god could think or could give his people anything better to defeat the enemy he would have done it when god makes a decision that's the best he is he never alters his decision so the first decision god gave his people to combat the enemy was his word so he says you go around now now he wakes up four o'clock in the morning training every day he goes to the gym he's safari as following sessions now the day arises he's fighting this opponent and at the end of 12 rounds remember he has an overwhelming victory in fact the opponent doesn't even last 12 rounds because he gets knocked out in the seventh round amen this is the age we're living in where safety is going to get a knockout seventh round knockout amen hallelujah and your victory is connected to your confession so remember that always have a positive confession the prophet says god thinks you're what amen fighting for god thinks you're worth saving amen and he says god's not a coward he can't use cowards that's afraid to testify if you're healing he can't use you you're no good you've got he's got somebody that's got a bad bone in them that will stand up and say rights right and wrong wrong that's the kind of people god can use amen amen and if you think you are you know more than god tell god about your plans if you want to make god laugh god about what you want to do amen amen hallelujah now knight comes he knocks the opponent out in the seventh round and you know the wife is very nervous around this time most wives don't even watch the fight they try to preoccupy their mind with other stuff if she knits she'll be knitting during that time because she doesn't want to see her husband being hit taking those punches so it's a very nervous time for the wife so at the end of it when the husband comes home maybe a few bruises bumps he's coming back home and he tells honey i am the champion i am the undisputed heavyweight champion i am the conqueror she says no did you really win the fight look honey 20 million dollars and then he takes the check and he gives it to her and he says bent this check this will secure our future then she becomes more than a conqueror she didn't wake up four o'clock in the morning to train hello she didn't spa she didn't have to take those punches she didn't have to train she didn't have to study the opponent amen but she is more than a conqueror and that's what it's like jesus christ defeated the enemy at calvary amen hallelujah and the only person that is equal to jesus christ is the bride of jesus christ [Music] she is born of his bone flesh of his flesh these two have become one amen and the bible says to him that overcomes i am going to grant that you sit at my on my throne king was a conqueror in his time you read about the provinces he ruled over but esther was more than a conqueror she comes in the end of the chapter then he says hey you're off my kingdom i'll give you you see what a woman can do make you surrender off your kingdom but that's what god has done for us even to off the kingdom he's given us don't be afraid to ask amen hallelujah now revelation 5 is a good picture of this victory he's victorious he's complaining he's the mighty conqueror now he's taking the book no one is found worthy do you know what they say when a search was made through heaven and earth they even looked at you and you were not worthy amen you are not worthy but here is the one that's coming now and he takes the book he's the one found worthy and then in revelation 10 he is bringing the book back down to the earth what is he doing the mighty conqueror is bringing the check down [Music] and he's giving it to who john the type of the right he's giving it to the one who is more than a conqueror amen hallelujah the bible says male and female created in them so the son of god held a mystery and locked up in him with the wife of jesus christ amen so you'll notice in heaven john is the type of the bride he's not worthy but on earth the same john he is now worthy to take the book amen hallelujah the book of redemption in the book has the lamb section which has all the names of the predestinated believers on earth now when the book is given to john these names must be reproduced on the earth manifested on the earth and must come through a bedding ground it needs a woman a man to sow that seed into so john is asked to take the book and eat it amen hallelujah and satan the accuser of the brethren wants to know why you're giving him the book amen because the one who redeemed us he's also our advocate he's fighting on our behalf amen and he tells the judge he accuses us they are not wisely to take the book but the judge is looking at the case he's looking at all the evidence and he's saying but i can't find any fault in this bride amen hallelujah because he is looking through something this devil is not looking at amen but satan accused of the brethren he's coming with his rebuttal arguments amen and he's asking for an appeal to his case and and god is telling satan i don't see your argument i don't see the evidence that you are presenting amen the supreme judge cannot find any truth in the evidence that satan is presenting and satan is appealing the case saying amen if you didn't apply the law correctly isn't that one of the arguments to use brother joshua i think there was an error in judgment you didn't apply the law correctly i want to appeal the case amen hallelujah he says i think you're looking at the facts the wrong way and god looks at satan and he says no i'm looking at the evidence the right way amen and i'm looking at the evidence and this accused through the blood of the advocate he looks at you through the blood amen amen and though your sins be escalated he sees you watch his will amen amen he says i'm looking at the evidence of these ones here that you are accusing and he says oh i priest amen the redeemer he shed his blood and i'm looking at it through the evidence he is presenting amen and he says i find this is my judgment as a supreme judge i find no fault in them they are sinless they are spotless they are perfect hallelujah and he says i'm going to make a judgment now i am dropping all the charges jesus dropped the charges and i'm just missing the case with [Music] i don't have the funds to pay for it you are dismissing the case with cost the supreme judge well if you can't pay the cost there's only one option go to hell amen there's only one place that satan can go to he must go to hell there's another afrikaans word that i don't know if it's too good to use but i don't think it's a swear word and it's called what does it mean amen [Music] let's give god praise amen [Applause] glory to god amen amen we are more than conquerors amen let's sing the song amen we've been made more than conquerors overcomers in this life we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ amen let's sing it maybe out of d or e let's try one of those keys amen hallelujah [Music] we've been made more than conquerors [Music] we've been made victorious and we've been made victorious through the blood of
