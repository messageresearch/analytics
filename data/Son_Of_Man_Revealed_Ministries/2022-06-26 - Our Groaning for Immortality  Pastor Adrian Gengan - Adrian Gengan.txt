========================================
[Music] [Music] [Applause] reds like us amen such a privilege to be gathered in the house of the lord this morning amen greet every one of you in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen our soon coming king king of kings lord of lords everlasting father prince of peace we just love to talk about him amen amen hallelujah we can go on with all the titles of god but then we know him as our husband we know him as our father amen what manner of love is this amen so greet you one and all in the name of jesus amen love and appreciate every one of you amen i'm if you're praying for one another amen even as we see the day fast approaching amen so hallelujah you'll love the lord this morning amen this morning we'll speak on our groaning for immortality amen our groaning for immortality and we'll take our scripture reading from psalm chapter 13 and verse 1 amen amen how long will thou forget me oh lord forever how long will thou i thy face from me how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall my enemy be exalted over me consider and hear me o lord my god lighten my eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death let my enemies say i prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved but i trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation i will sing unto the lord because he had dealt bountifully with me amen so david's cry and he's grown is how long amen how long will thou forget me oh lord how long will you hide your face from me let's turn to romans 8 22 amen it says for we know that the all creation groaneth and travail it in pain it's an anguish together until now amen and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit that's ephesians 1 14 the earnest of our inheritance we have the first fruit of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to the redemption of our body amen so we see creation is groaning and there's a groan in the redeemed there's a groan within each and every one of us if there's no groan there then something is wrong amen there's got to be a groaning within us we are waiting for the adoption towards the redemption of our body amen amen you may be seated amen so outgrown him for immortality amen we find that we are groaning everything around us is groaning because we realize and creation realizes that something is not right amen and the only way you can groan and wait for it is because we know that there is a new life that is coming and it speaks of a new world they are talking about a new world order but god is in the process of bringing his new world order where he is king of kings and he is lord of lords and all the presidents of the world and all the kings of the world will bow down at the name of jesus and worship him as king amen we know that the new life that is here and that is zoe life god's own life amen all nature is groaning for this day of sweet release amen death is as painful as it seems to the human that watching it but to the one that is happening too it's a day of sweet release because they step into a new body but that's only for the believer that is being born again not everyone that dies goes into a new body amen amen you must be born again you must accept the lord jesus as your personal savior so we find that nature is waiting for this glorious day until that day when christ shall come the second time from the heaven amen and we know that god would send him in due season matter of fact the descent has already started he has already started descending with a shout that's the message going forth the rapture is a process and the cycle of the rapture is already started amen amen so we can say we are in the process of the second coming and it will culminate it will end when the dead in christ rise and we are both changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye but first amen we must be ready we are being prepared now the message has come to give us faith for this translation amen then jesus will go to that sixth dimension amen and they will be judged according to what their leaders taught them and if they are accepted then they will come back to the earth to pick up their mortal bodies amen amen that's what we believe amen that's what we are taught amen so the birds are waiting for that amen if you think about the birds sing sweetly wait till the day of full redemption comes you'll hear the birds sing a sweeter song amen the trees are waiting for that all nature is bending and weeping waiting for that time groaning to be closed upon amen amen we look at a tree a tree struggles for life they struggle to hold out their branches and to sing the glories of god amen it wants to live a tree doesn't want to die amen look at the flowers only struggle to live but just for the frost and the cold to tear them down notice an animal how it struggles in its death it struggles to live amen look at the birds look at the beast of the field the struggle for survival everything is groaning everything in nature is groaning all creation is groaning and every time you see this groan you know amen something they are groaning for something every time you see an earthquake the earth is groaning when you see the rivers flooding amen and over flooding the rivers are groaning when you see a tsunami the sea is groaning when you see a tornado the winds are groaning and we ourselves are groaning because we know that something is wrong something has been lost both to man and to the earth all creation has lost something because if you read genesis 1 when god created the heavens and the earth and he created man everything was perfect but something happened amen amen creation lost something and we see from the inspired word of god that it is groaning for some reason you don't groan unless there's a reason amen and we find as we grow older the groan becomes more natural amen there's an ape and there's a pain there's a groan amen you younger people that don't know what a groaning is when your parents switch off your wi-fi and take away your cell phone that's your groan [Music] you know because the young man doesn't know what old age is amen but that's for wrong of you it might be a bigger groan if you take away your cell phone you think the end of the world came amen but something is lost and it's groaning trying to get it back back to its original condition amen amen imagine somebody falling from the earth down to a deep pit somewhere and is struggling and climbing pulling to get out of the pit amen they must by some means get out of the pit i think brother sunny mentions that this is called a pulpit because we are trying to pull people out of the pit of hell amen they're not in the original stage they're frantically screaming because they're in the spit and they're trying to get out of this pit and many people that have turned down the gospel are down in the fifth dimension in hell being tormented trying to get out of that pit this morning amen you remember that when lazarus was taken over into the bosom of abraham and the rich young ruler was there on the other side of the chasm and he couldn't get out of there he was trying to get out of that pit he was trying to get some water amen today if you hear his voice except the lord jesus christ except his plan of salvation hallelujah amen why you still can have salvation amen so what are they doing they're clawing at the walls they say a drowning man would clutch at a straw make a noise and do something they're groaning because they want to get back to the original state and that's why a person that struck with disease aches and pains one time they were not that way but they are groaning for a perfect body they are groaning to be back in good health amen they know there's something wrong they're trying to get back to the original condition of perfect health right now when nature and people are groaning like the bible just spoke about the groaning it shows us that we are not in our ought to be conditioned because man lost what did men lose their claims on eternal life when adam and eve fell we lost eternal life amen we fell to dip in the garden of eden and when adam fell to death he brought death to creation and he caused greece creation to grow he brought it upon all nature and he brought it to death the earth has never been the same since amen that sweet never died before adam fell and animal this is what the prophet is saying now an animal wouldn't die before adam fell but when we fell to sin we sold out our birthright and crossed that chasm now we are beyond the reach of god on the other side of the chasm and the only thing one thing that cannot die is god so if everything is dying and the only thing that cannot die is god then in order for us to have that eternal life who do we need we need god in our lives we need the source of eternity amen and the only way we can ever keep from dying and have that eternal life amen is to become sons and daughters of god and we find in john 3 16 amen it says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen there's the key to eternal life believing on jesus for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved god has a way to save mankind but man is rejecting his way of salvation he that believeth on him not he is condemned anyone that doesn't believe on jesus the bible is saying is condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god now why is nature groaning why is creation groaning they ever grown and we find it in genesis 1 28 when god blessed amen adam and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moved upon the earth amen nature is groaning because man stepped out of this position and the prophet says all nature is waiting for its master the reason nature is grown in creation is groaning the master has fallen the master of the earth is fallen lost his position and the master is the sons of god that was given this earth and now god will have his heavens of course god is god of the heavens he says but this was given to a man and the kinsmen redeemer come back come to redeem us back to death we lost to what we lost amen so creation will never be satisfied if you want to answer creations grown man must come back to their rightful condition amen when its master comes back to its condition where is the master of all circumstance and even though the wind wants to rage he can stand on that boat and say peace be still creation stopped in its tracks and obey the master yes amen even the people man on the earth marvel what manner of man is this that even the winds and the seas obey him hallelujah amen here came a god man walking upon the earth and he was the master of all circumstances amen amen hallelujah he could divide defy the normal laws of the earth he could walk on water amen amen hallelujah after the resurrection he even walked through the wall yes hallelujah amen he could cross dimensions he could go to that seventh dimension and come back to the earth amen and that's what we are coming back to that's our hope that's our inheritance that's our faith that we believe in amen we find that even blood itself has a groan we find with adam in the story of abel we find in genesis 4 10 it says what has thou done done talking to king the voice of thy brother's blood cried unto me from the the blood of the ground martyrs still has a voice it's crying out for their not for for their revenge amen but it's crying out for justice and the goal the great redeemer is the one that is coming with justice to recompense man for all that they've done amen they kill 68 million jews but they're gonna pay for every one of them you can't do something to god's people and get away with it our lord jesus said it's better that a millstone be put around your neck and you'll be cast into the sea then for you to offend one of my little ones that's how much god values you amen hallelujah that's evil's blood abel's blood was crying from the ground but there was nobody to meet the cry of abel's blood amen but hebrews 12 tells us about the amen the last adam and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling he has his blood now that speaketh better things than that of abel abel's blood was crying but jesus blood was the answer see that you refuse not him that speaketh amen amen if you are hearing his voice this morning do not refuse him that speaketh amen for if they escape not which refused him that speak on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven amen watch now his voice then shoot the earth did you hear his voice that shook the earth it says amen but now he has promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken out of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain now dwelling on that verse 26 he says whose voice shook the earth hallelujah that's revelation 10. revelation 10 when he is coming the mighty angel coming down from heaven close with a cloud rainbow upon his head face as it were the sun his feet are spillage of fire that's a perfect description of christ in the midst of seven golden candlesticks that's why the prophet said only christ you could be and in his hand a little book let's hear for the voice now to shoot the earth and he set his right foot upon the sea john you are type of the bride you had a voice saying i was about to write i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders at it and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever which created heaven and the things that are therein and the earth and the things that are there in what is it talking about all creation amen that there should be time no longer that's what time is talking about there should be delay no longer let there be no longer delay but let the seventh angel come forth let him thunder forth his message amen let's hear what brother branham is saying it says here in revelation book of symbols he says then daniel closing at the last he seen an angel come down so that's the scripture we just read right he says time should be no more at the finishing of that time in other words the body of time that we're living in now from the time and coming of the prince until this day at that time the mystery of god should be finished watch what he says now and the world is groaning waiting today why are they groaning listen to what he says why the world is groaning people don't know the mystery of god isn't that a shame when the mystery has been revealed people don't know the mystery of god he asked the question why they have not been taught the mystery of god the only thing they've been taught is joint church yes put your name on the book be a good fellow treat your neighbor right he says that's all right but you must know the mystery of god amen amen and he says no man can reveal it to you but the one that had the book and the bible says no man can call jesus the christ only by the holy ghost this grand old holy ghost church is going to come out one of these days and shine like you've never seen amen this is the hour for it amen prepare for the hour you're gonna shine amen how you shall be endured with power from an eye the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost he says wait until the dynamics strike the mechanics hallelujah thank you amen oh bless the name of jesus amen you gotta know the mystery of god hallelujah now we are talking about a groaning there can be no new body without the holy spirit amen forget about a new body if we have not been baptized with the holy spirit unless we are filled with the holy spirit our groan is in vain ezekiel 9 and 4 and the lord said unto them go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and the cry for the abominations that be done in the midst thereof what is the mark that was set forget the mark of the beast god commanded a mark to be placed upon us the prophet says in the seal of god talking about this man that came dressed in white he said let's stop a minute dressed in white righteous holiness dressed in white with an ink on at his side he said go through the city first before they come and put a mark upon the forehead before the mark of the beast can mock you you've already been marked hallelujah you know what a mark signifies a claim has been put on you amen a amen on the floor of every man woman and boy in the city that sighs and cries for the abominations that's done in the city for the sins of the people put a mark on them amen and then after he went through and march he returned back and said it's done then he sent the men and said go forth and don't you spare nothing but you utterly slay everything that hasn't got a mark on it and he says look here brother now i want to say lookie pay attention what he's saying the marker was none other than the holy spirit he says in in paragraph 188 he says notice if he comes to phoenix tonight you have son of man revealed ministries or any other tabernacle in the city any other church who would he put his mark upon that was so sincere and honest before god that wept that cried and prayed day and night for the sin of the city brother branham knocks on the pulpit two times if we had asked the question amen how many people are signed and crying for the abominations done in the city the master of all circumstances groaned when he came before the grave of lazarus jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it [Music] remember our message our groaning for immortality every groan will be answered [Music] jesus groaning at the grave his groan was answered acts 7 34 the children of that were down in egypt he says i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning god responds to the cry of his people and i am come down to deliver them that's the first exodus we are now in our third exodus amen and revelation 10 he has come down to deliver his people i will send thee into egypt this moses whom they refused saying who made the ruler and a judge the same did god send to be ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel would appear to him in the bush he brought them out after death he had showed wonders and signs in the land of egypt and in the wilderness 40 years let me re-read that this brand in whom they refuse saying who made thee a ruler and a judge that you come to condemn our women you come to condemn our preachers telling them that they shouldn't be married two or three times condemning their teachings we love three gods [Music] why are you making it one we like variety if the father is angry with me i will go to the loving son if the islam is busy i will commune with the spirit give us three gods we want to be like the other nations yes but here who israel the lord thy god is one lord amen amen amen not only they are grown but even though those jews that were persecuted in the great holocaust revelation 6 talks about their groan and when he had opened the first seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice sing out long o lord holy and true thus thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth yes amen they are crying for justice but god will answer god is fixing to answer their cry the soul's under the altar luke 18 verse 6 and the lord said hear what the unjust judge said and shall not god avenge his own elect would cry day and night unto him amen though he be along with him i tell you he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh can he find internet intellectual knowledge on the earth when the son of man cometh will he find big fancy buildings when the son of man cometh will all the preachers have their doctrine when the son of man cometh will the people be heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than the lovers of god when the son of man cometh will he find us rich increased with goods and have need of nothing is that what he's looking for the bible says when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen why we are now in science civilization science has got the people bedazzled that's right we cannot live without modern science amen but will i find faith on the earth amen but there's a secret mystery to it he's asking the question but he's also provided the answer because he sent a message to prepare us for rapturing faith amen amen but it's only a small group it's a minority group let's deal with the groans of the hebrew mothers brother brown telling us that each of those hebrew mothers in their giving birth to their children spoke the very place in their labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land for those of you that do not understand what's happening here the april mothers were giving birth to their children and under supernatural supernaturally mysteriously they were speaking the names of their sons in their birth pains and the name that they spoke that's exactly where joshua placed them in the land amen he says this is a great mystery the groan of the hebrew mothers joshua not knowing this but by inspiration led of the holy ghost after crossing over the land and taking the land then he divided the land and gave each man his promise amen exactly what the holy spirit promised through the birth back there so they were in their back pain they were screaming in frame menaces god and benjamin there was a groan he says watch those names they have meaning every name in the bible when you see one name in the bible it means something did you know that israel's wives when they gave birth to the 12 patriots each one of those mothers when they were having the baby and the baby was being born and them groaning the groans that came out and named those boys and the very groans that they give signified the nature of the child and the place that they'd make their final resting place now spiritual israel us the church the mother also gave birth let's see what the prophet is saying the church body is also groaned in travail but watch many of us won't like now what came out he says the church pride body has also been going through labor pains and god has said some in the church positionally through the labor pains so they were calling names and the church giving birth also produced sans he says when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world believing on the lord jesus that made the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was on pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains and when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom then the holy ghost just sit in the church some apostles he gave birth to apostles some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he's given into their speaking my tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gifts of healings all kinds of miracles with work into the church receive god's gifts to you amen amen he says here your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of god he is god's angel to the church messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave that word but stay right with the word because he's feeding the shepherd's place because the past the word pastor means shepherd look it up and find out if that ain't right a pastor is a shepherd and the holy ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock to feed them with what the word of god he says every groan amen under the power of the holy ghost he says that's the reason we should be groaning in the spirit that don't mean a lot of this put on i mean really a travail in the church then under the holy spirit you can get some real speaking with tongues and interpretation the holy spirit making utterance that tells through groans and prayers be real truth it'll be something right now that you see take place amen so what's our groaning our groaning is to be clothed with an heavenly dwelling place with immortality let's turn to second corinthians 5 and 1. i'm trying to give you a balance of scriptures with the quotes amen because the quotes what came to make the bible a new book yes amen this is just the teaching place this is just the training ground when you go out there in the world you take your two-edged sword and you open up the scriptures and you expound the word amen based on the quote that gave life to the scripture it says for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved what is he talking about for those of you that are lost talking about this body this flesh in this earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and how it's not made with hands eternally in the heavens amen he says for in this week wrong amen earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our heart with our house which is from heaven it's better than the gangnam body better than the churchy body better than the maori body better than the ghanaian body our earthly mother and father gave us this body but the body that's from above much more brighter amen much more glorious hallelujah this one if you don't watch it a few days it stinks we go to a farm and we pull our nose at the stench of the animals but you don't bath a few days because man was made in the image of an animal remember the body was made in the image of an animal right some of you got stumped there you think man was made in the image of god yes the original man spirit man but then he took a body of flesh and he put that spirit in that body some of you acting like you don't know what i'm talking about amen then why does x sell so many deodorants and brute and roll on we are trying to disguise the stinking flesh and every day we are getting older and older and going down to the grave for those of you think you are young brother branham says once you pass 21 you are dying every day amen [Music] he says we honestly desire to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so that being clothed we shall not be found naked what does it teach us there are some that are dying and going to the other side and being found naked they have no body so they are wandering spirits with no place of rest sometimes you find the spirits back on the earth that left committed suicide before their time then they say you saw highway sheila brother branham talks one time about these people that were traveling and this lady said she ate a man and he was thrown up in the air and they came down and they looked for the man and they couldn't find him there don't get scared now some of you afraid of top lotion ghosts they won't arm you amen he says they found out that some years ago a man got run over like that but his spirit was roaming the earth what was he found naked no body to go to he says in verse 4 for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not that not for death we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up to life amen now he that wrought us for the self same thing is god who also had given us the earnest of the spirit what is that ephesians 1 you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory he says we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord amen wherefore we labor that whether we be present or absent we may be accepted of him amen for we must all appear please brother don't read the scripture for me read that quote where it says the bride won't appear in the judgment where we don't have to account please brother don't skip this verse brother for we must all appear are you part of the hall you know brother braham says even though we passed he says we are being judged now by the word he says every man will have to give an account for his life we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive so it's time for rewards that's what we appear there for for rewards remember brother branham when he appeared there at the time ope slipped a hand under his arm and mira slipped the hand they were going for the rewards everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that which he had done whether it be good or bad judgment day is coming people don't like to hear about judgment preach about grace if you want the grace of god you got to accept his word you got to accept the holy spirit he says how we grown in the spirit to be clothed with them immortal bodies yes now you let's stop here now you're saying brother you're talking now for 45 minutes and i'm not groaning like what you're talking about what bro are you talking about i'm living my best life yet i'm following joel osteen seven steps to my best life i'm now on the fifth step what are you talking about i'm following td jake's woman that would lose you're talking about groaning every day the only grown i feel is when i'm hungry is that the groan you're talking about no how many of you know what i'm talking about amen there's a groan within us longing if you don't feel that way something is wrong amen amen let's read he says he doesn't yet appear what we shall be but we know we'll have a body like his we shall see him as he is in our bodies now we groan for that day all the earth is groaning for that day we thank thee that ours made a way for us to be happy yes you've made a way for us to be happy have health and strength and to labor in the harvest for a master now nature's grown and all creations grown let's try and bring this to a close now has been partially answered because of the earnest of the inheritance that makes man an amateur god that puts back the power in man amen because the holy ghost comes with power the holy ghost comes with demonstration don't talk to me about an holy ghost without power that's not the holy ghost in the bible the holy ghost comes to make you a master of circumstances wave you say amen come on don't get quiet on me now wave you say to this mountain amen amen ask anything in my name that came by the actions of the holy spirit so creation is called and creation's grown has been partially answered because of the ironies of our inheritance he says and we ourselves we grown too with them waiting for the redemption of our bodies he says now but now now they did all those years until now talking about creation he's saying they were groaning but up until now right now we have the honest of our inheritance he says oh my what do we have we have the evidence that god lives amen amen we have the evidence that god is with us hallelujah amen this is the time if you don't know cube time to rejoice this is the time we have the evidence that god is with us we have the evidence that god has not forsaken us that we are ears and he is ours because we we are we now tabernacle the holy spirit of god that christ our father amen amen and there is nothing hallelujah amen amen biden or trump neither putin or ramaphosa or zuma nobody can take it away the holy spirit that's been given unto you it's a seal until the day of our redemption yes amen amen he says nothing can ever take that away we are anchored in christ amen on christ the solid rock i stand he says the trees do not have it hallelujah the trees don't have it nature doesn't have it but yet we are still groaning with them because of here we haven't received the fullness of our adoption amen but we receive the honest of it and the honesty is power packed hallelujah if you haven't experienced the understood and been living in the fullness of the holy spirit i invite you this morning to be baptized and be filled with the holy ghost amen it says but we have the honest of it that we were picked up from the things of the world and now become sons and daughters of god what kind of people should we be we should be a power people we should be a church on fire we shouldn't be discouraged and down one day depressed amen but every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before i don't care who falls on one side who falls on the other side but every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before when people are complaining about the petrol price people are complaining about the food prices don't be found among the memories and the complainers but saying my god shall provide amen according to his riches in glory give god praise somebody don't say i don't know how i'm gonna make ends meet when they are saying i don't know i'm gonna make ends meet you tell them but brother i do know how i'm going to make ends meet because my god owns a cattle on a thousand hills even if i lose my job i will still have provision because he promised if he takes care of sparrows how much more will he take care of you and me god will not leave you yes amen amen hallelujah thank you blessed be the name of the lord amen amen what kind of people should we be when we think of that now we have the earnest our spirit is groaning for the full adoption hallelujah you know let me talk to you a little younger ones a little bit you know when you're playing a game and you unlock certain levels and you know they are greater levels but you need to unlock it and now you are groaning now sometimes you may need to buy something you may need to trouble your father your mother to buy you robux or to buy you something in that game so you can unlock its full potential nobody know what i'm talking about nobody amen he says same way we have the honest but we are groaning for the fullness because the earnest is so glorious how much the fullness a many many man when the fullness of time has come god had sent forth his son into the world the master of all circumstance and he walked on water hallelujah and there was a redeemed son not yet fully redeemed because jesus hadn't gone to the cross but he told him peter why don't you step out on the water and you know what forget about the time he doubted peter walked on the water peter walked on the water hallelujah a man full of faith yes that's what we are coming back to that's what we are coming back to amen glory be to his name he says now we have the earnest our spirits groaning for the full adoption but now we have the earnest of it as we receive the holy spirit it is the earnest of all complete adoption or complete salvation oh how beautiful i just love that we are waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when he asks the question now this will take place when at the first resurrection then when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and will have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he is and we shall be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like his a glorious glorified body and all the trials and struggles of this life will fade off into a little mist and blow away to never be no more amen and these earthly tabernacles that which we're now groaning we're waiting for that earnest for the salvation fully in its fullness to come but now in these tabernacles of clay we have something that tells us we have raised up so far amen what is the earnest it's a little down payment that holds it it's the earnest he says oh my oh my don't that makes us all full folks feel good in order to make us all feel good waiting for this hour we understand this will take place at the first resurrection but oh what a blessed hope for the believer that's lifting up hands for our redemption is drawing nigh when he sees these things appearing it's a great time for the believer even more when that mighty angel has descended with the title deed of our inheritance redemption is much closer than when the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost we are at the finishing line this is not the starting line amen he says in faith is the substance while we're groaning veiled in this tabernacle of humiliation oh some of us don't like humiliation you try and correct this fellow muscles start to grow anger muscles cure but poor was it john or james tells us tame this fellow tame him because some people have super power anger for that they don't have the earnest they got the fullness anger like a puzzle but he says sweeten your temper with hello sweeten your temper well i don't like to play why are you asking me to repeat that word sweeten your temple with amen veil in the tabernacle of humiliation he says if you want to see if somebody got the holy spirit and they are dead really dead he says kick them a little bit now please don't all of your russian come after the service to kick me he says then watch if that old nature rises up again we have the earnest of our perfect complete redemption like we was in the beginning when god created adam in the garden of eden amen can we read that let's read it one two three we have the earnest okay let's try that again we have the earnest of our perfect complete redemption back like we was in the beginning when god created adam in the garden of eden amen now if we got it why aren't we using it why aren't we calling those things which are not as though it is why aren't we speaking the word amen why are we lazy you'll say when i see the heavens split open and the glory of the lord descending then i'll know it's time brother now is the time now are we the sons of god yes god has given us amen the ammunition we need he says greater than the atomic bomb is a man filled with the holy ghost we can pray it will annihilate death the devil's kingdom but it's tedious stop asking me to pray but that's the weapon amen he says we have a fourteenth of glory divine by the baptism of the holy ghost the refreshment coming from the presence of god to water the church to make it grow in grace and when we sick we have redemption the blessing the attributes of the death of christ divine healing as a foresight to us that someday this mortal will take on immortality yes sir oh my marvelous he's here to do it glory he says just as there was pains and groanings in the first birth of natural they'll have to be the same thing in the second making
