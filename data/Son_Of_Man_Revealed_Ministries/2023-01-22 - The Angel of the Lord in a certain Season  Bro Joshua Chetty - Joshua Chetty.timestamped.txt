[1:39] amen
[1:42] living in a time where
[1:45] you can see that any longer will be
[1:49] burned up like an oven
[1:52] yeah so we can see the days
[1:55] an earring or departure
[2:00] and while we are here there's a work for
[2:02] us to do
[2:04] because
[2:05] God has put us here for a purpose amen
[2:07] amen
[2:11] and until we find ourselves in his
[2:14] purpose
[2:16] then no matter what we pray for no
[2:18] matter what we ask you we're not asking
[2:20] in line with his word yes we must
[2:22] connect to his purpose amen for our
[2:24] lives
[2:27] you may have heard your Bible this
[2:29] morning we're going to turn to them
[2:31] book of ecclesiastics chapter
[2:33] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1.
[2:36] 50
[2:50] to everything there is a season
[2:53] and a time to every purpose
[2:56] under the heaven amen amen so we know
[3:00] that God works in time then season
[3:04] we know a season is a space of time
[3:10] if it was a winter season now you
[3:12] prepare for the winter season
[3:13] if it's a summer season you're cooling
[3:15] you're getting things to pull off
[3:16] prepare for the summer season
[3:18] if it's talking to the spring season
[3:20] you'll have preparation for the spring
[3:21] season
[3:22] so you've got to recognize the season
[3:24] that you're living in
[3:27] amen we'll also turn to the book of
[3:28] Zechariah
[3:30] chapter 4 verse 1.
[3:58] and the angel of God that talked to me
[4:01] came again and wake me
[4:03] as a man that waked out of his sleep and
[4:06] said unto me what she is down and I said
[4:09] I have looked and be holy Candlestick
[4:11] all of gold with a bowl upon the top of
[4:15] it
[4:15] and his seven lamps there on and seven
[4:18] pipes to the seven left which are upon
[4:20] the top thereof
[4:23] and two olive trees by one the right
[4:26] side of the bowl and the other on the
[4:27] left side they're off so accidents spoke
[4:30] to the angels that talked with me saying
[4:32] what are these my Lord
[4:35] an angel that talked with me answered
[4:37] and said unto my nose thou not what
[4:40] these be and I said no my Lord that he
[4:43] said and spake unto me saying this is
[4:46] the word of the Lord until people saying
[4:49] not by might
[4:51] know by power but by my spirit amen
[4:56] saved the Lord of hosts amen
[4:59] who are thou great Mountain before zero
[5:02] people that I should become shall become
[5:04] a plane and he shall bring forth the
[5:06] eighth Stone thereof with shouting
[5:08] crying Grace Grace unto hits
[5:12] imagine maybe she did
[5:14] so we take that one part he says not by
[5:16] Minds
[5:18] not by power
[5:20] but by my spirit
[5:22] saved the Lord amen
[5:25] amen this morning we're going to speak
[5:27] on
[5:28] the topic
[5:30] the angel of the Lord in a certain
[5:32] season
[5:33] amen
[5:36] and not by another subtropical saying
[5:38] not by mites
[5:40] not by power but by my spirits
[5:45] says the Lord amen
[5:48] amen the angel of the Lord in a certain
[5:51] season
[5:54] and let's look at the scripture to
[5:59] put that in context
[6:01] John chapter 5 verse 1 to 9.
[6:11] John chapter 5 Saint John chapter 5
[6:14] verse 1 to 9. and after this there was a
[6:16] feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to
[6:19] Jerusalem
[6:21] that there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep
[6:23] Margaret pool which is calling the
[6:25] Hebrew tongue but isda having five
[6:28] porches
[6:29] in these lay great multitude of
[6:31] important folk of blind or witted
[6:35] waiting for the moving of the water
[6:37] that was something like how you go wait
[6:39] like at a clinic or at a hospital
[6:42] but this is now they are relying upon
[6:45] God here now
[6:48] for an angel went down at a certain
[6:50] season into the pool
[6:53] and Trouble the water
[6:56] whosoever then first after the troubling
[6:59] of the water stepped in was made whole
[7:03] of whatsoever disease he had
[7:07] so the water was there all the time
[7:10] but it wasn't a certain season that the
[7:13] angel of God will step in amen
[7:17] and when you trouble the water whoever
[7:19] stepped in the hill so whatever disease
[7:21] they had
[7:22] so basically
[7:24] dare to wait there efficiently
[7:27] and wait for that season amen yes
[7:30] amen and the fact they were waiting
[7:33] there they had Faith to believe amen
[7:35] they are fit to believe that in a
[7:38] Southern Season the angel of God is
[7:40] going to step forth into the water yes
[7:43] yes and he's gonna trouble the water
[7:45] they couldn't just be seated there
[7:47] without faith to believe in that the
[7:50] fact that they came there and they
[7:52] waited because it wasn't just just
[7:54] coming there and they're getting here
[7:55] going into the water no the angel of the
[7:58] of the Lord had to step in first
[8:02] travel the water and then they were
[8:04] healed
[8:08] and a certain man was there which had an
[8:10] uniformity 30 and eight years
[8:14] when Jesus saw him lie
[8:18] and knew that he had been now a long
[8:20] time in that case
[8:22] he said unto him now
[8:25] who is Jesus the Same Angel of the Lord
[8:28] that was stepping in
[8:30] now God doesn't change his word but he
[8:34] changes his form
[8:36] in the human flesh now
[8:40] because he knew that he he was it was
[8:42] him in another form
[8:45] who is the Angel of the lord we made it
[8:47] very clear in our past sermon it's God
[8:50] himself he's not a created angel
[8:53] amen this is God himself
[8:56] changing his form amen same God the pull
[9:00] of fire same color of fire materialized
[9:03] to come into a man
[9:06] yes one time they come at a star in 1933
[9:08] and the river when the prophet was
[9:10] baptizing
[9:12] one time you come at the pool of fire
[9:14] the same mother let the children of
[9:15] Israel one time he come in the form of a
[9:18] cloud
[9:21] and here he is now in human flesh
[9:26] but
[9:28] he knew he could discern this man yeah
[9:30] he had his infirmity for a long time
[9:35] but he knew that this man had faith
[9:38] because he was there waiting for the
[9:40] angel to trouble the water
[9:44] amen amen now you know if you wanna
[9:48] how many of you you know you trusting
[9:50] God for something and you want it to
[9:52] just happen but yeah with the people
[9:55] they were patients yes amen
[9:59] the other one that the angel of God
[10:01] comes to this place at a certain time
[10:03] and a certain season
[10:06] the other the preaching of the word amen
[10:09] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of
[10:11] the world Amen so they heard the word
[10:14] yeah
[10:15] we've had the word amen yes we've been
[10:19] hearing the preaching of the words
[10:21] and our faith must turn within us amen
[10:26] what made us to come into this world
[10:30] we have faith to believe it
[10:32] amen if without faith it is impossible
[10:35] to serve God Amen that's what brings us
[10:38] into the message of the hour
[10:40] we heard these things
[10:42] we have the supernatural
[10:44] and we knew that this this is a message
[10:47] that will take us out of this Earth amen
[10:49] this is a message of Deliverance this is
[10:51] a message that will give us a body
[10:53] change
[10:54] amen and we came in
[10:59] and we began to wait patiently yes
[11:02] because we don't move until you tell
[11:04] that to move
[11:06] we said be it unto me according to Thy
[11:09] word Lord
[11:11] but at a certain time in a certain
[11:14] season
[11:15] they materialize us now in human flesh
[11:19] amen
[11:20] amen you stepped on the scene
[11:23] and here's the man with 1814 now 38
[11:26] years of his life he had an infirmity
[11:28] but now this day is going to be
[11:31] different from every other day amen this
[11:34] season is going to be different from
[11:36] every other season that you've been
[11:38] waiting yes
[11:41] you always was believing amen amen the
[11:44] fact that you're here you've always been
[11:46] believing but this is gonna be a
[11:48] different season amen this is gonna be a
[11:51] season where Something's Gonna
[11:53] materialize Something's Gonna Take Place
[11:55] amen that what he believed within him
[11:58] amen that coming upon his heart is now
[12:01] going to materialize in his flesh
[12:08] amen there's coming in our way in your
[12:10] flesh you will see God Amen he's coming
[12:13] now in your flesh you're gonna see the
[12:14] supernatural right here in this natural
[12:16] you're going to see the supernatural
[12:21] because why the things that you have
[12:24] believed now are going to become
[12:25] practical in your life
[12:30] and he said when Jesus saw him lie I
[12:32] knew that he had now been a long time in
[12:36] the case he said unto him will thou be
[12:39] made whole
[12:42] amen don't we want to be made whole amen
[12:45] I'm talking about making all taking a
[12:47] lot of those personals
[12:49] I'm talking about a message that come to
[12:51] deliver us out of the pest house
[12:54] yes
[12:55] amen I'm talking about a problem that
[12:58] was commissioned just like Moses where
[13:01] God sent an angel before him amen amen
[13:03] he gave the two signs I'm talking about
[13:06] when God came in to pull out fire with
[13:07] Moses
[13:08] Moses so was he with His prophets amen
[13:12] amen right amen
[13:15] and we've got and now the prophet has
[13:18] given us a message and he goes up the
[13:19] scene but the person that's still not
[13:22] Leading the People is the Angel of the
[13:24] Lord amen
[13:27] right here amongst us
[13:30] thank you Lord
[13:31] one of the messages have been waking us
[13:33] too to become sensitive
[13:35] to his presence Amen to become sensitive
[13:39] in the season that he's working in yes
[13:41] amen
[13:42] amen because it comes in a certain
[13:43] season amen
[13:46] and when he comes Moses
[13:49] remember Moses now was brought up in
[13:51] Pharaoh's Hearts because his parents
[13:54] knew that he was a proper child yes and
[13:56] knew he was born a prophet he was born
[13:58] for a purpose
[14:01] God and eventually his own mother
[14:08] his real identity is
[14:11] amen but he was cool with all the signs
[14:14] with all the education with all the
[14:16] intellect he had the best schooling in
[14:18] Egypt
[14:21] God had to take the 40 Years of his life
[14:23] yes amen but when he come in that 40
[14:27] Years of his life towards the end of the
[14:28] before he leaves Egypt
[14:31] now he realized hey there's a purpose
[14:34] for me now to be a deliverer now his
[14:37] mother is taught him that
[14:40] didn't even be being taught on that
[14:42] you've got the word we've been teaching
[14:44] we've got the Bible we got the
[14:45] scriptures we've been taught who we are
[14:47] and what amen what our place is
[14:49] but it wasn't good enough he had to meet
[14:53] the pull of fire amen he had to have in
[14:55] the back of the devil experience yes and
[14:58] he hasn't asked that as yet he's been
[15:00] thoughts and he's been reading he's been
[15:04] learning
[15:05] but he hasn't had that personal
[15:07] experience
[15:09] he has to come a time where you must
[15:12] have the personal encounter amen it's a
[15:14] one-on-one experience amen you mean
[15:16] taught that word from the time the
[15:18] message has been preached year after
[15:20] year after year
[15:23] but a couple of time in your life
[15:25] where you must have a prosperity
[15:32] we find that he tried one day you saw an
[15:35] Egyptian fighting with a
[15:37] and what he did
[15:39] kill the Egyptian he buried him in the
[15:41] sand thought it's forgotten
[15:43] he tried to do it with his own strengths
[15:45] yes with his own might amen
[15:49] because he was
[15:51] remember he was brought up in the
[15:53] pharaoh's house so you must have been
[15:55] learning all these skills and kill that
[15:57] man
[15:58] are you talking about the concealings
[16:00] Kentucky is delivering the people
[16:03] and the next day
[16:06] some
[16:07] Israelites we engage in some in some
[16:11] quarrel and they were fighting and you
[16:12] tried to intervene
[16:14] and they revealed to him what he thought
[16:16] nobody saw yes that he murdered a man
[16:20] and then he had to flee
[16:23] Egypt right because he couldn't deliver
[16:27] the people he needed to meet the angel
[16:29] of the Lord
[16:30] man he needed the angel of the Lord to
[16:32] go before him
[16:35] because he's the angel of the Lord that
[16:36] will take the people on Exodus
[16:38] amen it will be the angel of the Lord it
[16:40] will bring forth the plague yes it will
[16:42] bring it will be the angel of the Lord
[16:44] that will turn his tough into his
[16:46] serpents
[16:48] it'll be the end of the Lord and apart
[16:51] the Red Sea amen
[16:54] he was going to do the works but Moses
[16:57] had to go and meet him
[17:03] amen
[17:05] so you can see not by mites not by power
[17:09] but by my spirit says the Lord amen
[17:12] Moses couldn't deliver the people with
[17:14] his might with his power amen
[17:17] he needed something more
[17:21] so he said
[17:24] the important man answered himself I
[17:26] have no man when the water is troubled
[17:28] to put me into the pool but while I am
[17:30] coming
[17:32] another step put down before me
[17:36] Jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed
[17:40] and walk
[17:41] and immediately the man was made holy
[17:44] and took up his bed and walked amen
[17:48] amen so he made it patiently
[17:52] waiting for the Time of the Season yes
[17:55] and in that certain season
[18:00] God was manifested in flesh
[18:13] of course
[18:18] watch one time
[18:20] the disciples were there on the boats
[18:22] Luke chapter five was a bunch of nine
[18:27] and he came to pass that as the people
[18:29] pressed upon him to hear the word of God
[18:31] he stood by the lake of
[18:35] guinnesserit and saw two ships standing
[18:38] by the lake by the fish
[18:41] by the fishermen were gone out of them
[18:45] and we're fishing washing their nails
[18:47] and he entered into one of the ships
[18:49] which were Simons and prayed him that he
[18:52] would trust out a little from the land
[18:54] and he sat down and taught the people
[18:56] out of the ship
[18:57] now when he had left speaking he said
[19:00] unto Simon launched out into the deep
[19:03] and let down let down your nets for a
[19:05] drop
[19:07] and Simon for the drawer and Simon
[19:10] answering synonym to him Master we have
[19:13] toiled all the nights and have taken
[19:16] nothing
[19:18] doesn't do this
[19:19] by their own rights
[19:22] by their own strengths but their own
[19:25] abilities by being seasoned fishermen
[19:28] their toys yeah
[19:30] yeah just because
[19:32] trying to sort of our own issues out
[19:35] we might have our own circumstances
[19:38] we try in the flesh to help ourselves
[19:43] instead of going and laying in other
[19:45] sweets
[19:46] asking God to lead us into a situation
[19:49] sometimes we go and use our kind of
[19:52] thinking
[19:53] and we want to do things on our own
[19:55] abilities
[19:57] and we find that it's just a failure
[20:03] but
[20:08] [Music]
[20:11] and I'm taking nothing he said buddy
[20:13] listen to what Peter said nevertheless
[20:15] at Thy Word
[20:18] I will let down the nips amen
[20:22] so he has obedience to the word now amen
[20:26] as thy word I will let down thyness
[20:29] and when they had done this
[20:32] they enclosed a great multitude of
[20:35] fishes
[20:36] and their net break
[20:39] here's God bringing for His blessings
[20:41] down amen that they can't contain this
[20:43] blessing
[20:45] then the net break yeah and they're
[20:48] beginner to the partners which were in
[20:50] the other ship that they should come and
[20:52] help them
[20:54] and they came and filled both the ships
[20:57] so that they both began to sink look at
[21:00] when God's not blessing now when he
[21:02] poured out his Blessing you won't be
[21:03] able to contain it amen and you are not
[21:06] doing it alone now you are sharing your
[21:08] blessing with others you're calling
[21:09] others come
[21:11] the Lord is Blessing Me This is the time
[21:13] this is the season I'm not talking about
[21:15] just physical things now I'm talking
[21:18] about your spiritual blessing amen I'm
[21:20] talking about when you're rejoicing in
[21:21] this word and rejoicing in this time of
[21:23] this word Revival now and all these
[21:26] great things are happening you don't
[21:27] want to so much the Lord is Blessing you
[21:30] become astonished you won't be able to
[21:32] contain the way he's blessing you amen
[21:34] yes and you want to bring others income
[21:37] see what the Lord is doing here
[21:39] see what the Lord is revealing to us
[21:41] week after week see how the opening of
[21:43] the word is coming through
[21:48] and get the secret Simon Peter saw it he
[21:51] fell down at Jesus knees saying depart
[21:54] from me from a sinful Man O Lord
[21:58] listen to this for he was astonished
[22:02] and all that we are with him
[22:04] and the drought of the fishes which they
[22:07] had taken hmm
[22:10] foreign
[22:11] repentance
[22:14] amen because you can't be in the
[22:17] presence of God
[22:19] and the Lord is revealing things and the
[22:22] Supernatural is taking place and you not
[22:24] began to see
[22:26] that you now need to surrender your life
[22:28] amen you become sensitive to his
[22:31] presence right there when Peter saw the
[22:33] supernatural taking place he began to
[22:35] become sensitive
[22:38] Jesus presence yes
[22:40] and when he began when he became
[22:42] sensitive he realized oh I am a sinful
[22:44] man
[22:45] you see that is why the presence of God
[22:48] yes
[22:50] yeah you come here
[22:53] with all your thoughts and feelings but
[22:55] you cannot go live in the same amen
[22:57] because you will come to realize that
[23:00] Lord I am nothing without you yes amen
[23:02] yes oh Lord I Need Your Grace upon my
[23:04] life
[23:07] thank you
[23:16] the prophet of God says when Israel left
[23:18] Egypt for the promised land in Exodus 13
[23:21] 1 God know that they never traveled that
[23:24] way before
[23:25] either 40 miles but yet they needed
[23:28] something to go with them
[23:30] they lose their weight
[23:32] so God sent them a guide yes
[23:36] something like this I send my angel
[23:39] before you they pull out of fire to keep
[23:41] you in the way to guide them to this
[23:44] promised land
[23:46] and the turn of Israel followed that guy
[23:49] the pillar of Fire
[23:52] by night and Cloud by day
[23:58] when it stops day stops when he
[24:01] journeyed their Journey amen and when he
[24:04] got them close to the land
[24:06] and there wasn't afoot to go over he led
[24:10] them back into the Wilderness again you
[24:12] wouldn't go with them
[24:15] you see
[24:17] when you find that you're not ready
[24:20] but you're not foot and he's not going
[24:21] to work with you
[24:23] he'll leave you there
[24:25] till you come back to repentance again
[24:27] to the surrender your life again
[24:29] and then he moves again
[24:32] he wants a surrendered life amen we
[24:35] cannot be living
[24:36] going to the promised land which is the
[24:39] Holy Ghost
[24:40] and all our inheritance
[24:42] and we're walking in this walk and then
[24:45] we're looking back to legacia
[24:48] you cannot have one leg in Leticia
[24:51] you cannot come into this word rumbling
[24:53] after drumming and murmuring
[24:57] because that is the chest
[25:00] that is the truth yes when the seconds
[25:02] when your finances are low what do you
[25:05] got problems at all when you got
[25:07] difficult that is the chest of a true
[25:09] Christian
[25:09] the kind of nature comes out
[25:12] or you're going to say Lord You Lead Me
[25:14] Lord I cannot make it
[25:17] Lord I need you yes Lord may you be my
[25:21] guide amen
[25:24] that's what he wants he wants to be your
[25:27] guy amen the Lord knows that you cannot
[25:29] go on this walk to the promised land on
[25:31] your own yes that's why he sent you the
[25:34] guide
[25:35] amen that's what we have the angel of
[25:38] the Lord guiding us for
[25:45] not a different person
[25:47] the same God changing his form
[25:50] amen don't make our God into different
[25:52] people
[25:54] God God you've got to understand God in
[25:56] the season that he's working in amen
[25:58] amen you've got to see God in a season
[26:01] that he's working in that is where they
[26:03] missed Jesus when he came on the scene
[26:04] yes they missed him in the season that
[26:07] he was in they knew him to put out fire
[26:09] they knew him in the way he walked in
[26:12] Moses but they didn't see him when he
[26:14] was manifested in the flesh yes
[26:18] it's the same thing we can say today we
[26:21] know him working in the days of the
[26:22] prophets
[26:23] we know him in the Supernatural of the
[26:25] prophet
[26:26] but do you recognize him in your own
[26:28] life amen do you recognize you're
[26:31] sensitive to his leading yes
[26:33] for him to be a guide to you you've got
[26:36] to be sensitive to his leading amen and
[26:38] he will lead you into all Church
[26:41] he will lead you into every part of your
[26:44] life
[26:46] but you gotta you gotta take that step
[26:48] and say Lord
[26:49] not my will be done father but your will
[26:52] be done amen
[26:56] stop using your own ability because he
[26:58] said not by Max
[27:01] you might be applying for a job that
[27:03] might seem impossible for you to get
[27:06] maybe your company informed you that
[27:10] because of the employment the equity act
[27:11] you don't fit the cuts
[27:14] maybe your company informed you that you
[27:16] do not have enough experience as yet
[27:20] but if you really desire that job
[27:23] and if you really want it and you are
[27:25] really faithful to God Amen you say Lord
[27:27] not my mind not by might not by power
[27:30] because promotion doesn't come from man
[27:33] Lord you put Kings in places you put
[27:36] people in positions yes
[27:39] all authority comes from you Lord
[27:41] not by power but by my spirit says the
[27:46] Lord amen
[27:48] you might say Lord I'm trusting I need a
[27:51] wife but Lord are you interested in
[27:54] finding me a partner is that something
[27:56] that you do
[27:57] go back to the Bible
[28:01] who was the one that first again the
[28:03] first marriage in the Garden of Eden
[28:10] who was the one
[28:12] that was leading Elijah to find a bride
[28:16] for Isaac amen was he not interested in
[28:18] marriages
[28:21] who are the one who was the angel of the
[28:23] Lord
[28:24] because Abraham knew that he met his
[28:26] Angel and he knew that he's gonna
[28:30] entrust really either to go because he's
[28:32] being led by the angel of the Lord
[28:35] and he was the one interested in fact in
[28:38] taking in leading him the way
[28:41] was it not the angel of the Lord that
[28:43] directed The Prophet that he was married
[28:46] at a certain date
[28:53] yes amen who is the eye
[28:57] Beyond I send you amen amen
[29:01] he's the same I am
[29:03] it's the same great I am yes
[29:06] yes what does scripture not given to you
[29:07] be all right send you Elijah the prophet
[29:10] amen
[29:14] God is interested in all
[29:17] was he not little interested in a little
[29:19] fishy
[29:21] in that little dead fish with the hook
[29:24] taking out all his
[29:29] God was interested in the fish
[29:31] would God not be interested in you
[29:34] then the Bible says if he cares for the
[29:36] sparrow of the air if he cares for the
[29:39] Lilies of the Field how much more will
[29:40] he do for you so why take daughter what
[29:43] what food you're going to eat what
[29:45] clothes you're gonna wear don't be
[29:47] troubled by these things
[29:52] he said to them
[29:53] I send my angel before you the pillar of
[29:56] fire to keep you in the way to guide you
[29:57] to guide them to the strongest land and
[30:00] the children of Israel follow that guide
[30:02] the pull of Fire
[30:04] with it
[30:08] he said that's what it is the church
[30:11] today
[30:12] no doubt but what the long-suffering of
[30:15] God today as it was in the days of Noah
[30:20] the church would have been would have
[30:23] done been gone if it had just corrected
[30:25] and said in order but it has to lead
[30:28] around
[30:29] lead us around and around and around
[30:33] middle of Israel know when they were
[30:35] shouting on seeing the dead soldiers of
[30:38] Egypt they drowned us pharaohs carried
[30:41] and turned upside down they got their
[30:43] victory
[30:45] Moses in the spirit singing in the
[30:47] spirit Mary Miriam dancing in the spirit
[30:49] and the daughters of Israel running up
[30:52] and down the bank shouting and dancing
[30:55] they were they were only a few days from
[30:58] milk and honey
[30:59] little did they know it was 40 years
[31:01] away because they begin to Grumble again
[31:04] God and
[31:06] guide
[31:08] [Music]
[31:16] another code disease and we without a
[31:19] leader are helpless
[31:21] and Christ is our leader
[31:24] and God was with Moses
[31:27] leader though he sent him an angel to
[31:30] lead him I said my angel who for thee to
[31:34] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[31:37] to the place which I have promised the
[31:42] angel wants to be his leader
[31:45] listen to what he said the angel
[31:47] performed the Miracles
[31:49] Moses never performed any miracles
[31:52] the angel of God in Moses performed the
[31:56] Miracles amen the angel of God in
[31:59] brother Branham performed the Miracles
[32:03] you see what I mean
[32:05] you are the same angel of God that
[32:07] discerned the Hearts and Thoughts of the
[32:08] people amen you've got we got to see
[32:11] that amen yes amen
[32:14] the angel of the Lord was with him the
[32:17] angel of the Lord led him perform Let
[32:19] Them perform the Miracles
[32:21] that is why if you want to see the
[32:24] Miracles again if you want to see God
[32:27] giving you discernment
[32:29] to know your situation because you have
[32:32] to have spiritual discernment is our
[32:34] knowing right and wrong
[32:36] then you have to understand who is
[32:38] leading in this hour amen amen
[32:40] you have to understand the same one that
[32:42] read the prophets he's here on the scene
[32:44] amen
[32:45] now God has always
[32:48] by all men through the scriptures
[32:50] through all ages has ordained that
[32:52] Angels should guide the people
[32:55] there was Moses
[32:57] it was Daniel
[32:59] oh and many more
[33:02] we could we say all the way down someone
[33:05] was speaking to me not long ago said but
[33:07] brother
[33:10] not
[33:11] he said not after the Holy Ghost has
[33:14] come
[33:15] No Angels guide the church or guide
[33:17] individuals
[33:18] Nosa said it's the holy ghost that guide
[33:21] them
[33:22] that's misunderstanding between angels
[33:25] and the Holy Ghost amen that is error
[33:28] see just pass it out
[33:31] the denomination of teaching or the
[33:33] church we are teaching they don't
[33:35] understand that this is not an ordinary
[33:36] Angel yes amen this is not a created
[33:39] angel
[33:40] this is God himself
[33:42] the Holy Ghost he's God amen amen and
[33:45] the angel of the Lord is the Holy Ghost
[33:49] and that is why they could have the
[33:50] gifts but they could not accept the Holy
[33:53] Ghost
[33:54] and therefore that is why he was not led
[33:58] by the Holy Ghost amen they were led by
[34:00] the system of man but he was not led by
[34:03] the Holy Ghost and it's the holy ghost
[34:05] that birth in the church it's the holy
[34:07] ghost that led the church and it's the
[34:09] only God that is still leading the
[34:11] church amen
[34:13] man
[34:17] he says the Angels left the church right
[34:20] on and still leading the church

[34:59] day of Pentecost well when he was laying
[35:01] in prison up there who was it come to
[35:04] and touched him and brought him outside
[35:07] the angel is that right amen how many
[35:11] says sin Paul the Apostle had the Holy
[35:14] Ghost
[35:15] he says lift your hand when the ship was
[35:17] tossed about for 14 days and there's no
[35:21] hopes at all and he could and he come
[35:25] out there and shook his hand and holding

[35:47] angel

[35:55] church to minister to the people amen
[35:57] there's no flesh and Glory before God if
[36:02] anybody could have Glory it would be
[36:04] Jesus but he said it's not me that the
[36:07] works it's my father that dwelled in me
[36:10] that doeth the worst amen amen so you
[36:14] see how important it is
[36:16] to be sensitive to the season that we're

[36:23] the word there was a season to get the
[36:26] people cleaned up

[37:49] dimension
[37:52] you come to reveal to you a different
[37:54] identity
[37:56] that you deep within you there's a gene
[37:59] of God
[38:00] and that is a different species
[38:03] that's from a fake specie
[38:05] come to reveal to you that you come from
[38:08] the Royal seat of Abraham that you are

[39:38] here yes maybe you couldn't see it then
[39:41] you didn't understand it you were
[39:42] thinking
[39:44] all you know is that I'm here there's
[39:45] something I believe there's something
[39:48] that's being preacher that I believe yes
[39:50] I believe in the church
[39:51] but it was the angel of the Lord amen
[39:54] was leading you here
[39:56] because
[39:57] and this Prophet was sent out Jesus
[40:01] for Christ
[40:03] an angel of the Lord was leaving you
[40:07] and not only did he worked with him
[40:09] leading him to Rebecca he also was
[40:12] working with Rebecca amen
[40:15] amen they also had to be an unction

[40:20] something a deep calling with a d with a
[40:23] deep according to the Deep from within
[40:24] you amen
[40:26] you have to be something within you to
[40:28] receive it to respond to the call
[40:32] because
[40:33] no matter how much we come and interpret
[40:35] the word to you if there wasn't a gene
[40:38] of God within you if there wasn't a
[40:40] representation you would not receive it
[40:43] amen
[40:47] God has to give you the faith to believe
[40:49] it that's the grace of God yes
[40:52] you have to be predestinated for that
[41:01] in terms of the Book of Judges
[41:06] [Music]
[41:07] watch out is working
[41:09] in all circumstances
[41:11] Judges chapter 6 verse 1.
[41:22] and the children of Israel did evil in
[41:25] the sight of the Lord
[41:27] and the Lord delivered them in the hand
[41:30] of the million seven years
[41:33] and the Hand of Midian prevailed against
[41:36] Israel because of all the midianites the
[41:38] children of Israel made them the dens
[41:41] which are in the mountains and caves and
[41:43] strongholds
[41:46] and so it was when Israel had sown
[41:49] that the majinats came up and the
[41:51] amalekites and the children of the East
[41:54] even they came up against them
[41:58] so yeah the children of Israel now
[42:00] because of their sin
[42:01] because they first look God
[42:04] and they did evil in the sight of God
[42:06] yeah now the enemy is coming upon them
[42:09] and when the enemy comes
[42:11] he comes
[42:14] he comes with others amen right
[42:17] he comes like a flood against you
[42:21] and then count against them and
[42:22] destroyed the increase of the earth till
[42:24] Thou come unto Gaza and left no
[42:28] sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor
[42:30] Ox nor Earth so they came up with their
[42:34] Kettle and the tent and they came as
[42:35] grasshoppers for multitude for both day
[42:38] and the camels were without number and
[42:41] they entered into the land to destroy it
[42:44] and Israel was greatly impoverished
[42:46] because of the midianites and the
[42:49] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[42:52] now this is something about a child of
[42:54] God the children of God
[42:56] he was in your sin it was in your
[42:58] problem he was in a vaccinating
[43:00] condition
[43:00] but when they cry unto the Lord
[43:04] even in the vaccine condition God must
[43:07] hear your cry
[43:09] if you're a child of God God will answer
[43:11] your prayer amen
[43:13] and it came to pass when the children of
[43:16] Israel Cried unto the Lord
[43:18] because of the Monday nights
[43:21] that's why sometimes when the passing
[43:22] the vaccine condition God puts them in
[43:24] the problem
[43:26] until it brings them onto their knees
[43:29] to cry out to him amen and say Lord I
[43:32] have forsook you Lord I have forsook
[43:35] your words Lord I have not been faithful
[43:37] to the to coming to church
[43:40] to the fellowship I have not been
[43:42] Faithfully in praying I have not been in
[43:44] favor of reading my Bible I have not
[43:46] been faithful in serving you Lord
[43:50] and then a problem comes sickness come
[43:52] and ailment come and infirmity comes
[43:55] and what happened it brings you on your
[43:57] knees
[43:59] but it's not the end of the world
[44:01] if you're a child of God cry out to God
[44:03] Amen
[44:07] says
[44:10] and it came to pass with the children of
[44:12] his great prayer unto the Lord because
[44:14] of the midnight that the Lord sent a
[44:16] prophet unto the children of Israel
[44:18] would sit unto them just say the Lord
[44:21] God of Israel I brought you up from
[44:23] Egypt and brought you forth out of the
[44:25] other bondage and I delivered you out of
[44:28] the hand of the Egyptian and out of the
[44:29] end of all that oppressed you and
[44:31] drained them out from before you and
[44:33] gave you their lands see they give you
[44:37] their land right
[44:40] and I said unto you I am the Lord your
[44:43] God fear not the god of the amorites he
[44:47] knows landed well but you have not
[44:49] obeyed my voice
[44:54] and they came an angel of the Lord
[44:59] and said under an oak

[45:09] be the right and his son give you
[45:11] interest Wheat by the wine press to hide
[45:13] it from the merchandise

[45:18] him and said unto him the Lord is with
[45:21] thee the Mighty Man of Valor amen who is
[45:24] this that deserve his heart who is this

[45:48] bread of the day amen where Beyond The
[45:51] Miracles in God be with us

[45:57] angel of the Lord he's coming now to
[45:59] work with him
[46:00] Amen in a certain season now the angel
[46:03] of the Lord is coming to deliver it
[46:07] he's coming with Deliverance amen
[46:09] and Gideon my Lord
[46:13] did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt
[46:16] but now the Lord had forsaken us and
[46:19] delivered us into the hand of the
[46:20] midianites so
[46:24] we tried to say that becoming a message
[46:26] so long in the Lord
[46:27] wasn't doing anything the Lord had
[46:29] forsaken us he was there so many years
[46:31] ago when the prophet all these things
[46:32] took place
[46:33] but look listen to the beginning of the
[46:35] scripture
[46:36] in the beginning

[46:40] that they was the one the first of the
[46:42] Lord they did evil in the sight of the
[46:45] Lord yes
[46:46] amen
[46:55] and the Lord looked upon him and said go

[47:01] Israel from the hell of the midianites

[47:05] and he said unto him oh my Lord where
[47:08] would shall I save Israel beyond my
[47:10] family is poor in medicine and I am the
[47:13] least in my father's house
[47:15] and the Lord said unto him surely I will
[47:18] be with thee so you're not good
[47:21] God is Not depending upon him yeah right

[48:00] not going into your space in your
[48:01] situation alone
[48:03] you're not going and facing the
[48:04] circumstance alone
[48:05] amen you're not living in this hour of
[48:08] Leticia in his Darkest Hour you're not
[48:10] living it alone
[48:12] it's the angel of God that guy that is
[48:14] leading us yes amen
[48:16] in his Darkest Hour
[48:18] in this most gruesome hour to live upon
[48:21] in his most difficult age to live upon
[48:24] it is the guide that is leading us
[48:27] amen
[48:31] and the Lord said unto him surely I will
[48:33] be with thee and thou shalt Smite the
[48:35] imagination one man and he said unto him
[48:37] if now I have found Grace in thy sight
[48:40] then show me a sign
[48:42] with me
[48:44] your partnered ends I pray thee until I
[48:46] come unto thee and bring forth my
[48:49] present and set it before thee and he
[48:51] said I will carry and doubt until Thou
[48:55] come again and Gideon went in and made
[48:57] really a kid and unleavened case of ever
[49:00] a flower the flesh he put in a basket
[49:02] and he put the broth in a pot and
[49:04] brought it out under him the organ
[49:06] presented it and the angel of God sent
[49:09] unto him take the Flesh and the
[49:11] unleavened cakes and lay them Upon This
[49:14] Rock and pour the brunt and he did so
[49:16] then the angel of the Lord
[49:18] put for the end of the stuff that was in
[49:21] his hand and touched the Flesh and the
[49:23] unleavened cakes and they rolled up fire
[49:26] out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh
[49:29] and then leaving cakes then the angel of
[49:32] the Lord departed out of his sights and
[49:34] Gideon perceived that he was an angel of
[49:37] the Lord
[49:37] Gideon said I left oh Lord God for
[49:40] because I have seen an angel of the Lord
[49:42] face to face
[49:43] and the Lord said unto him peace be unto
[49:46] thee fear not
[49:48] thou shall not die
[49:50] because you know the scripture if anyone
[49:53] knows that when you see God they shall
[49:55] die
[49:55] we knew that in the days of Moses that
[49:57] he couldn't go to the mountain he had to
[50:00] make Moses go and speak for them
[50:02] I said fear not thou shall not die in
[50:05] Gideon building altar there before the
[50:07] Lord and calling Jehovah Shalom amen
[50:10] amen
[50:12] and we have received the message alone
[50:14] in this day amen amen in the days of
[50:17] gross Darkness
[50:19] and says arise and shine
[50:21] that light has come amen amen
[50:28] you can see
[50:30] foreign
[50:34] by causing the fire to come
[50:36] and consuming the Flesh and the
[50:37] unleavened cakes amen
[50:40] chapter judges 13.
[50:42] and you know the story here this goes on
[50:44] Gideon God brought him down
[50:46] to he took years initially started the
[50:49] army of ten thousand men and he brought
[50:51] down the amount of footage that he would
[50:53] use because he wanted to show him not
[50:54] the hand of man
[50:56] but it's God himself that's going to
[50:58] deliver them amen because it's not about
[51:00] might not by power but by by spirit says
[51:04] the Lord amen
[51:06] judges 13.
[51:13] and watch every time the angel of the
[51:14] Lord is coming watch when he's coming
[51:17] and the children of Israel did Evil
[51:20] again
[51:21] in the sight of the Lord
[51:23] and the Lord delivered them into the
[51:25] land of the Philistines 40 years
[51:28] and there was a certain man of zorah of
[51:30] the family of the day night whose name
[51:31] was Manoa and his wife was Barren in
[51:34] bayonets and the angel of the Lord
[51:37] appeared unto the woman
[51:39] not
[51:44] but thou shall conceive and bear his son
[51:48] not therefore beware of breathing and
[51:51] drink not wine no strong drink and eat
[51:55] not any unclean thing
[51:57] follow Thou shalt conceive and be a son
[52:00] and no razor shall come on his head for
[52:04] the child shall be a Nazarite
[52:06] God from the womb and he shall begin to
[52:09] deliver Israel out of the land of the
[52:11] Philistines
[52:14] then the woman came and told her husband
[52:16] saying amen of God came unto me and his
[52:19] countenance was like the continents of
[52:21] an angel of God very terrible but I
[52:23] asked him not when he was neither
[52:27] neither told him me his name but he said
[52:31] unto me be all thou shall conceive and
[52:34] bear his son and now drink no wine no
[52:37] strong drink no neither eat any unclean
[52:40] thing but the child shall be a Nazarite
[52:42] to God from the whole to this to the day
[52:45] of his death
[52:47] so you see before
[52:49] this happened now
[52:53] before the angel of God could work
[52:55] is warning here to now have not to drink
[52:59] any strong drink nor to drink any wine
[53:01] if you want the supernatural to take
[53:03] place in your life
[53:05] you need to separate yourself from
[53:08] unclean living you need to separate
[53:10] yourself from the things of the flesh
[53:11] amen from the thing that will destroy
[53:13] the flesh yes the thing that will be
[53:16] contrary to the spirit man you need to
[53:19] separate yourself from those things
[53:21] because if you want the angel of God to
[53:24] work amongst you then we need to now
[53:26] have a surrendered life amen to become a
[53:29] prisoner to Christ see that I that
[53:31] liveth by Christ that delivered in me
[53:34] yes amen amen I am surrendered to him
[53:36] amen amen to his world
[53:38] and then he can come and work amen
[53:43] then the woman came and told her husband
[53:47] remember I treated the Lord and said oh
[53:50] Lord let the man of God is doubted his
[53:52] sin come again unto us and teach us what
[53:55] we shall do unto the child and and
[53:58] through the child that shall be born and
[53:59] God welcome to the voice of Manoa and
[54:02] the angel of God came again unto the
[54:04] woman that she set in the field but
[54:06] Manoa husband
[54:08] and the woman made Ace and Grand and
[54:10] showed a husband and said unto him
[54:12] behold the man had appeared unto me that
[54:14] came unto me the other day and Manoa
[54:16] arose and went after his wife and came
[54:19] to the man and said unto him as thou the
[54:22] man that speaketh unto the woman and he
[54:24] said and he said I am
[54:25] and Manoa said now let thy words come to
[54:28] pass
[54:29] how shall we order the child
[54:33] and how shall we do unto him
[54:36] in other words they're becoming you want
[54:38] to be obedient out of the world Amen and
[54:41] the age of the Lord said unto him Manoa
[54:43] of all that are said unto the woman let
[54:46] her beware
[54:47] she may not eat of anything the common
[54:49] of the wine neither let her drink wine
[54:52] or strong drink no any unclean thing all
[54:55] that I commanded her let her observe
[54:58] foreign
[55:11] [Music]
[55:13] offering
[55:16] thou must offer it unto the Lord
[55:20] knew not that he was an angel of the
[55:23] Lord and Manoa said unto the angel of
[55:25] the Lord what is the name
[55:28] that when the things come to pass we may
[55:32] we may do the honor and the angel of the
[55:35] Lord said unto him why ask us after my
[55:39] name seeing it is a CPT secrets
[55:42] amen this is
[55:44] it wasn't revealed to everybody amen
[55:48] so manova took a kid with a meat
[55:50] offering and offered it upon a rock unto
[55:52] the Lord and the law Angel did
[55:53] wondrously and Manoa and his wife looked
[55:56] on so he came to pass when the flame
[55:58] went up toward Heaven from off the altar
[56:00] that the angel of the Lord ascended into
[56:03] the flame of the Altar and when Noah and
[56:05] his wife looked on it and fell on their
[56:07] faces to the ground
[56:09] but the angel of the Lord did not did no
[56:12] more appear to Manoa unto his wife
[56:14] knew he was the angel of the Lord
[56:18] amen he came give him the word dare to
[56:21] be obedient to the word you come again
[56:23] and worked through Samson because every
[56:26] time Samson he is in battle he's not
[56:28] Samson yes the angel of God walking
[56:31] through something amen amen and that's
[56:33] why when Samson now fell into sin
[56:37] God couldn't work with him
[56:39] the angel of God couldn't come and work
[56:41] with him
[56:42] until Samson had to come to a time of
[56:44] repentance
[56:47] and said once more Lord amen amen he had
[56:51] to come now to a time of repentance
[56:55] and according to the word that was
[56:57] spoken
[56:58] that the loss will be there was grown
[57:00] now and he was truly repented now and
[57:03] now he cries out one small Lord yes
[57:07] then he comes and works again amen then
[57:09] he comes and strengthens him yes
[57:12] amen you might have found yourself in a
[57:14] need this morning you might have found
[57:16] yourself in a circumstance this morning
[57:18] maybe it's time to evaluate yourself
[57:20] maybe each one of us to do a
[57:23] self-evaluation
[57:24] if you want the angel of God to work in
[57:27] our lives if we want to see the
[57:29] supernatural manifested in and so our
[57:31] lives amen we want to see Miracles
[57:34] taking place
[57:36] and it's time to inspect our own lives
[57:39] amen and say Lord let me surrender
[57:42] myself to you
[57:44] oh Lord
[57:46] I shine on my own abilities
[57:49] I try to make money by trying to get
[57:52] some extra business and try to make
[57:53] money but without consulting you Lord
[57:56] forgive me Lord I'll try not my own
[57:59] ability
[58:00] but Lord now I'm saying Lord not my
[58:03] Minds not by power but by your spirit or
[58:06] loss by your spirit Lord
[58:09] may you help my business and buy your
[58:12] spirit Lord may you help me in my school
[58:15] made by your spirit Lord may I get this
[58:18] promotion by your spirit Lord may I get
[58:21] final wife by your spirit Lord I need a
[58:24] house not by my might Lord may you come
[58:28] Lord and intervene amen the same God
[58:32] that created the ram there for Abraham
[58:34] because Abraham was obedience and if you
[58:38] are obedient just like Amy I'm the same
[58:40] blessing Must Fall upon you amen
[58:44] the same creative power was there when
[58:46] the squirrels came
[58:47] this is all under the third pool because
[58:49] that's when he comes on the scene
[58:51] amen he's come now with the opening of
[58:53] the world it's him coming down in the
[58:55] shower and it is
[58:59] perform paradoxes a circumstance might
[59:02] be impossible to you
[59:04] you might desire something that's so
[59:06] impossible to get
[59:08] you you're trusting God for the
[59:10] Salvation of the loved one and he might
[59:12] be so far-fetched
[59:14] there might be so to you to your human
[59:17] ability they've they've gone far down
[59:19] the road
[59:20] it's impossible for them to be saved
[59:22] what did Jesus say but man is impossible
[59:26] amen but not for God for With God all
[59:29] things done amen possible yes Amen to
[59:33] God all things are possible yes that's
[59:36] why the angel of God loved that song
[59:37] only believe amen All Things Are
[59:42] I mean what did he say to the prophet
[59:43] you can get the people to believe you
[59:47] nothing can stand in your way not even
[59:49] cancer
[59:50] because when he's working
[59:52] who was who he was he was him working
[59:54] with the prophet
[59:56] that is why when the fat woman is coming
[59:57] it's nothing you don't look at the
[59:59] person
[1:00:00] you look at the voice we understand amen
[1:00:02] amen don't look at the flesh
[1:00:06] the one that's working in the flesh amen
[1:00:09] the Holy Ghost the angel of God works
[1:00:12] with its people amen he works with man
[1:00:15] you've got to recognize that everyone
[1:00:16] that is why he says you've got to
[1:00:18] believe the ministry that's why
[1:00:21] president said you've got to believe
[1:00:22] your husband
[1:00:24] the code is so true you've got to
[1:00:26] believe your pastor if you don't have
[1:00:27] confidence in your pastor
[1:00:29] then you have a problem that you're
[1:00:31] wasting your time here amen you've got
[1:00:33] to have confidence in your pastor
[1:00:36] but it goes beyond that
[1:00:38] because the angel of God walking the
[1:00:40] truth amen God
[1:00:43] in these prophets not God in his
[1:00:46] servants amen amen
[1:00:48] got to see that that's why he said the
[1:00:50] prophet God to get the people to believe
[1:00:52] you
[1:00:53] never said because they believe me he's
[1:00:55] saying they believe me
[1:00:57] they know I am God
[1:00:58] but they must believe that yes amen
[1:01:01] he said get the police people to believe
[1:01:03] you and nothing will stand in your way
[1:01:05] yes
[1:01:06] so you got to believe what the preacher
[1:01:07] is saying I mean anointing yes
[1:01:10] then nothing will stand in your way amen
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:15] and that is why I am my job is today
[1:01:19] this morning is to convince you because
[1:01:21] I got to get you to believe the ministry
[1:01:25] and then if you believe the ministry and
[1:01:27] nothing will stand in our way the
[1:01:30] supernatural will take place yes because
[1:01:32] he said
[1:01:34] but by my spirit says the Lord because
[1:01:38] this is a certain season and this is a
[1:01:41] short season when he's working amen
[1:01:43] because you've got to have discernment
[1:01:45] to recognize the hour that you're living
[1:01:47] in amen you've got to recognize the
[1:01:48] season that he's working in and remember
[1:01:50] seasons are for the time in space amen
[1:01:54] catch the season before it ends amen
[1:01:57] amen catch the season while it's here
[1:02:00] when you and somebody enjoy summer
[1:02:02] because when you when he gets cold in
[1:02:04] Winter you say I wish it was somewhere
[1:02:05] then when you're in when someone you say
[1:02:07] I wish it was Winter you have to enjoy
[1:02:10] the season as the season is dead
[1:02:13] amen amen to everything there is a
[1:02:15] season yes and time and to every purpose
[1:02:19] under the heaven amen amen and trust God
[1:02:21] that you will bless them

[1:09:57] like testimonies amen amen you know when
[1:10:03] God does something for us we ought to
[1:10:04] testify and I this is the last time I'm
[1:10:07] going to testify on your behalf
[1:10:09] amen
[1:10:11] the next time you need God done
[1:10:13] something for you you need to testify on
[1:10:16] about it amen but I want to testify to
[1:10:19] show you the power of God and what he
[1:10:21] can do
[1:10:23] amen and God can turn a no into a yes
[1:10:27] if you only believe
[1:10:29] amen you've heard the testimonies in the
[1:10:31] past
[1:10:32] amen Our God can turn and know into a
[1:10:35] yes amen how many of you remember the
[1:10:37] testimony from last year
[1:10:39] was the disabled brother Joshua the last
[1:10:42] year sorry it was last year amen you
[1:10:44] remember when brother Joshua shared the
[1:10:46] testimony how they turned they know into
[1:10:48] a yes so anyway a quick short testimony
[1:10:50] amen so here was Jemima who applied by
[1:10:54] faith for a job it's a teacher assistant
[1:10:57] position it's one of these Youth
[1:10:58] Development programs just for a year 12
[1:11:01] months or something
[1:11:03] so anyway they called her for to come
[1:11:06] and give the documents
[1:11:08] to submit the documents and I know the
[1:11:12] Bible says faith without works is dead
[1:11:13] so over two days we labor to get the
[1:11:16] documents and it was a back and forth to
[1:11:18] the police station and back and forth to
[1:11:19] affidavits and back and forth to the
[1:11:21] school finally while she was waiting for
[1:11:23] a testimonial
[1:11:25] at the high school she was she gets a
[1:11:27] phone call Angela was sorry you were
[1:11:30] unsuccessful in your application
[1:11:32] so now that can be really demotivating
[1:11:35] to get a phone call from them to tell
[1:11:37] you you are unsuccessful in your
[1:11:39] application
[1:11:41] so anyway she told me about it and I
[1:11:44] told her go back to the school
[1:11:47] and tell them to reconsider your
[1:11:48] application
[1:11:50] now there's one thing for me sitting in
[1:11:52] my office to tell somebody but it's got
[1:11:54] to take her faith
[1:11:57] to actually get there because you must
[1:11:59] have courage to do that
[1:12:00] so it so happened to be the last day of
[1:12:02] school
[1:12:03] and you know when it's the last day of
[1:12:05] school nobody really wants to pay
[1:12:06] attention to you so anyway she managed
[1:12:08] to get the teachers attention and she
[1:12:10] told them to please reconsider my
[1:12:12] application
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:15] so you don't always have to take no yes
[1:12:19] you be persistent
[1:12:21] you'll be perseverant you remember the
[1:12:23] woman who said Lord
[1:12:26] when the Lord said why must I take
[1:12:29] the meat and give it to the dogs
[1:12:32] she said Lord even the dogs eat from the
[1:12:34] clowns of the table she didn't accept a
[1:12:36] no
[1:12:37] so anyway we left the I told him we're
[1:12:38] gonna pray about this
[1:12:40] amen because we had no other thing amen
[1:12:42] she needs to study again this year to
[1:12:44] further teaching uh you know a degree
[1:12:47] and whatever she wants to do so we
[1:12:49] prayed about it and we said when schools
[1:12:51] reopen you go back and you remind the
[1:12:54] teacher to read them to the application
[1:12:55] but it so happened we didn't need to do
[1:12:57] that because in the engine room we've
[1:13:00] been preaching in people with vision and
[1:13:02] we've been preaching about the Leaning
[1:13:03] of the angel of God so all we did was to
[1:13:06] learn it to God and we believe that all
[1:13:07] things are possible
[1:13:10] so here comes January the teachers get
[1:13:13] back to school they call her back and
[1:13:15] say come in for an interview
[1:13:17] amen so from a no you are unsuccessful
[1:13:20] to come in for an interview
[1:13:23] then she goes for the interview she
[1:13:25] prepares for the interview goes for the
[1:13:28] interview and they tell her she asked
[1:13:30] him how did I do she said well you are
[1:13:32] the best from all the candidates we had
[1:13:33] amen amen and then last week they called
[1:13:37] her
[1:13:38] last week they called her to come and
[1:13:40] sign the contract amen amen so let's
