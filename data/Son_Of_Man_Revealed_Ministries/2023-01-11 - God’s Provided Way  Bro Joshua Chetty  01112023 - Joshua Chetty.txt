========================================

worship you to honor your name in this prayer night service Lord we pray father that you would come down and commune with us fellowship with us meet with our needs and our desires and our requests Lord because anything we desire is more of you more of your spirit more of your anointing Lord and father I pray Lord even as you are shaping us and molding us into the image that you want us to be Lord we want to come this evening to say Lord You Are The Potter we are the clay and father come and mold us and shape Us One More Time Lord until we come into your Perfect Image oh God I pray Lord for every believer that is coming to the house of the Lord may you bless each every one of them and Lord meet with their need father I pray Lord God even as the word comes forth Lord that your word will meet the need and father bring the result oh God because your word is powerful it's sharp it's quick oh God we come the service into your hands of everything that will be said and done we ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you may be seated praise the Lord amen everybody feeling good in the house of the Lord amen it's a good thing to serve the Lord amen it's a good thing to come into the house of the Lord to worship him you know David was saying I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord am amen so you can see it wasn't a ritual yes amen because if it was a set thing then David would have known he was going but they came and told David let us go into the house of the Lord amen and he said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord amen so we haven't come out of religion or out of just uh amen just a set program please dogmas and just trying to serve the Lord in the flesh but we are come here under a Divine mandate amen hallelujah because heaven has come down to connect with the body amen Heaven has come down to connect with us so we appreciate the Lord amen you may have seen the announcement earlier so that's sister Rosemary that's my aunt amen that was Pastor Ronnie's brother's wife amen you know Sister Rosemary amen so she passed on Monday and uh faithful sister loved the Lord amen been many years serving the lord and it was a time when the Lord would call her home amen so it's not that we didn't have faith and didn't pray and we didn't believe we believed we had faith we prayed amen amen but the Bible says to everything there is a season a purpose under the heavens amen amen a time to be born and a time to die amen so nobody knows that time that we're going to go into that sixth Dimension because death is not a thing not for the old death is when your time is up when he calls me I will answer amen amen so you find many people of many age groups go on to be with the Lord amen so we just have to be constantly ready constantly serving the lord that is the key to be ready at all times amen so none of us know if we're guaranteed to wake up in the morning so that is why when we come into the house of the Lord amen every night we come ourselves before the Lord amen and trust that he will undertake for us so the funeral will be on Saturday amen you would see the notice there and you'll see the address and everything that you need if you're coming to support amen so there'll be a service also at the house on Friday if you want to come amen it's number three bmal Road in D North amen hallelujah so you know death is never an easy thing especially when it's the lady of the house the mom of the house amen and it leaves a void am and uh you remember Pastor Ron are telling you many times that if the father dies it's not as effect well not not effective what word am I looking for you saying it right but really when Mom leaves a home it's leaves a big void because what does Mom represent love amen she nurtures the family amen sometimes she's the go between in the home some sometimes maybe dad may be hard in a hard line but Mom's the one more soft and can bring the balance in the home amen it's a place where children get married they go but they come back home maybe weekends whatever it's like gather around there Fellowship amen so you know what I'm talking about so just pray for the family amen the Lord will give them strength at this time give them Grace at this time amen hallelujah because it won't be easy days ahead you know these days here it'll just be they still like trying to process what has happened but let the funeral finish once they get some closure there then the real Journey Begins the Journey of healing amen hallelujah so we just want to remember them in prayer as well that the Lord will be with them also remember the the funeral service that will be uh done there amen the Lord will be able to speak in a way amen that will bring Comfort to them hallelujah amen let's all stand together for the word of the Lord amen you're under expectation tonight amen amen hallelujah so you know you look around and you think where is the year gone we already in the 11th month amen so where has the year gone amen we had so much to do so much plans we maybe wanted to achieve but the year's gone by amen so even as we reflect on the year and we see it's the 11th month amen it's not the end maybe you've been trusting the Lord for something believing the Lord that it's going to happen this year amen there's still time maybe you haven't had the faith maybe you haven't had the belief amen but now is the time Amen to rise up I believe that numbers mean something amen amen we're in the 11th month of the 23rd year amen and you know what Mark 11:23 says if you say to this mountain amen so that can only work because Jesus is's trying to teach you how to operate in your sunship Authority amen amen and he tells you if you believe what you say yes amen amen did Jesus say if you believe what I say what did Jesus say if you believe what you say everybody believes what Jesus says but man finds it so difficult to believe his own word that he has power he's a God over the Earth so he's coming to put you back in your sunship Authority amen let's just uh sing a song as we invite our brother Joshua to share the word of the Lord amen hallelujah so be under expectation amen even as the word of the Lord is being preached be under expectation amen and I believe you will meet our expectation amen hallelujah thank you [Music] Jesus

when we look at Salvation And The Plan of Redemption and look at our own lives we know Lord that there's nothing that we could have done to be here tonight but to come under this wonderful message is

Departure from this life it's one thing that we can be grateful that we have receive this message amen nobody outside this message has the hope that we have amen and have that assurance that we have that Blessed Assurance amen because if it wasn't for that can you imagine how all of us would react and where would we be right now amen the proper himself wanted to take his his own life he couldn't take it but the angel of God was there amen and when he had that experience amen when he could see beyond the curtain of time and he had the experience then he knew amen there's no fear in death amen

this life all the sin and all the bad thing but every good thing and good memory will be there amen amen amen Jesus thank you thank you so that's the Glorious hope we have in the gospel amen so we have entered into the 11 month of the year 2023 special time we know as the set man of the house the pastor of the church has said that this will be the most Supernatural year amen but it wasn't words it wasn't something just said you got to understand who said it all of us sitting I mean here tonight would say we'd love to hear Jesus speak directly to us or maybe Prophet William brand was speaking directly to us but God as his provided way of working amen amen and you've got to understand the hour when he's using a certain way and what he's working with because if you don't recognize that then you're missing God yeah you worshiping God where God was but you're not worshiping God where God is yes amen amen so you got to worship God in the way he is working in the now yes amen not in the past tense but in the present tense amen amen so when that words was echoed that this will be the most Supernatural year we can say if you don't believe us believe the testimony amen amen go and see the works that was done amen you don't believe us believe The Works that was done so we pass the ninth month and then we know what happens after the ninth month there had to be a birth of something and then we've now entered the 11th month of the year and you know what happened with the what the 11th month si yes amen so this is the end time evangelism of the 11th Hour workers this is now because Christ is Christ already being reproduced so now it's time for the Greater Works am amen it's time for the end time evangelism for the quick short work amen amen it's time for the supernatural to take place it's time to now go and set the city of Blaze amen there was a time for teing amen there's a time to obey and T and to receive power amen but now it's time to take that power amen and have an impact amen with that power to become a powerful to become a power to reckon with to become a powerful force upon the Earth amen you got your bibl let turn to the book of Acts chapter 1 reading from verse 4 amen amen you love the Lord amen amen how many of you all were blessed this weekend amen amen how many you at a double portion how many of you can say you at a double portion from the morning to the evening amen amen and then took that took that anointing and went and anointed your work places hallelujah amen how many of you were so drunk that you left there and then people wondering what's wrong with you why you can't stop talking amen amen so we thank God that we got this special type of wine amen amen amen well fermented amen and new wine amen thank you Lord and he saved the best wine for the 11th Hour workers amen thank you Lord thank you Lord all right acts 1 ver4 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem amen but wait for the promise of the father yes thank you Lord which say ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence Hallelujah verse six thank you Lord when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons yes so when we was walking in his life and we received the the message of the hour we we didn't know how God is going to work we knew that he's going to do certain things we knew there certain prophecies still to be fulfilled but it wasn't for us to know the time and season because God as his ways of bringing his season in his time in his time he make all things amen amen come to pass which the father put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses amen amen you have to be a witness yes amen and to be a witness it means you have to you had to see and have a direct encounter with this incident hallelujah amen you had to be there amen when the incident took place you couldn't hear it from somebody else amen you had to be there when the incident took place amen yes Lord than now that's the witness amen amen and ye shall be Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem in the message amen right there where he's talking now and in all Judea and in Samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth that's where you go now and thou must prophesy again before Nation tongue and King amen thank you amen you may be seated amen also turn to the book of Acts chapter 2 reading from verse one and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one C yes Amen in one place amen amen and suddenly now they couldn't orchestrate this because it happened suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a mighty rushing wind in other words this is Supernatural now amen this is not natural now amen amen and it filled all the hours amen it didn't fill just the ministers yes Hallelujah it fill all the house hallelujah amen amen where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongue like as of fire and set upon each of them oh thank you Jesus thank you Lord and they were some filled with the no they were all filled with the Holy Ghost because why they were in one Accord in one place and they were tearing where they were supposed to be caring am amen yes and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other Tong as the spirit gave them utterance amen we going to speak this evening on God's provided way youall heard this message many times there is no other way but God's provided way but we're going to speak about God's provided way produce the produces the same results amen amen if you come by God's provided way under his law every time in every place no matter where it is must produce the same results yes amen amen and one of you ways is in Ephesians 4 he says he that is descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers yes now somebody say but we've got the message of the hour the message of the hour is the Homeland amen amen it is the Homeland hallelujah hallelujah but how are you going to enjoy the benefits of the message of the hour yes now you want to come under God's provided way you want to see the same results that the message of the hour produced in the message of the age yes you want to see the result the message of the hour produced that you're reading about in all the books and tapes yes then you must come under God's provided way and what is God's provided way is given the 54 Ministry amen he's given the five for Ministry to shed light upon the same message it's not another message but it will bring light it will bring life into it because why it's God's provided way amen and it's going to produce the same results amen amen there is no shortcut to it amen hallelujah amen you got to come under God's provided way and if you want to see the benefits of the message of the hour if you want to rest in the homeland of the message of the hour and enjoy the land then you must come come under God's provided way hallelujah amen we could be anywhere we can say no I just want to sit at home I want I'm still reading my Bible I'm still listening to the Tes but you have to be under a covering yes there there's a reason why you under a covering amen remember this is a time of war in a time of War you can't be fighting alone that's right you got to have you have to come under command and control amen you got to have generals leading you amen yes you got to have captains leading you oh yes and when you come there when you come you can get reinforcements yes that's right amen under the covering but the moment you step out of the covering you on Satan's territory right amen Satan's going to take advantage of you he going to ravish you that's right because Satan is like a roaring lion seeking you devour but when you're under the covering you are protected amen because that is God's provided way amen hallelujah amen amen amen that is why he given us the word to be fortified by the word and Satan can't do anything to you as long as you are fortified by the word by the minute you step outside the word you are stepping into Satan's terrritory then he's got the right to come and attack you yes but under the word he's got no rights he has no claims over you yes amen amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen so given some Apostles some prophets some evangelist some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come he's coming back to same thing again into the unity of the faith amen amen we must come in unity of the faith amen amen because if there's no Unity then we can't be an effective Force amen yes that's right amen now we know that the the the the natural type spiritual now we know that Israel is under attack by every by is under attack right now and we know that before the attack they had a government that was falling apart yes but in the war time they got a thing called Unity government and the unity government is formed because of wartime or disaster all those things so in the time of spiritual warfare right now we must come in the unity of the faith amen amen yes because the five4 ministry is going to be edifying the body of Christ amen amen and this body will have one party in the main in the mystical Body of Christ then another body will have another part but we all come United now amen amen making up the same body different parts of the body different mandates from God different parts to play in the Kingdom but we all have one body and when we come in one mind one Accord in unity of the faith amen that we must produce the same results amen amen because why this this bride must become the super Church yes amen thank you Lord amen amen oh thank you Lord praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus praise God amen hallelujah thank amen we good amen thank you Lord blessed be the name of Jesus you can see the Satan's kingdom is being rubbished right now continue in the me amen so we find that for God to produce this super church this super race the this invincible Army that will impact the entire Earth yes amen he got the fivefold ministry what for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the N AG of the Son of God unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we end forth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wi of Doctrine yes there was an age there was a season for that there was a season where people were focusing on every where people were carried away with every wi of Doctrine and what did it do it brought a separation amen yes he brought Discord amongst Brethren it took away brotherly love it people lost Fellowship yes and when that happened when that happened the the Holy Ghost couldn't work freely right and the church became stagnant yes and then it wasn't producing the results because it wasn't God's provided way Amen to come under Doctrine and to be tossed to and fro when man is taking his own Doctrine and denominating around the doctrine that's not God's provided way and it stifles the move of God and then it wasn't producing the same results amen yes but when now the the but the true father Ministry says till we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man andto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ then we end forth being no more children this is an efficient Church a mature Church yes tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in waight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fly joined together and compacted by that which every joint Supply it according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make it increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now could you imagine when God called the children of Israel and said to Moses that they must go forth and the Commandment was given to Joshua that you must go and take the people over to Jordan now God said to Joshua that the he's given the land into the for the people and all the enemies and all the heite the jebusite the parasite he given them to In His Hands yes there was but God provided way that they had to go fight every inch for the land yes yes they still had to go and fight for it amen now Joshua made the captain of the host the angel of God was with him yeah they had the Ark of the Covenant going before them in other words they have the word before them amen but they had to take the word and now be practical about the word amen amen they are to now act upon the word amen they had the word they believe the word but they are to act upon it and they are to go and drive out physically drive out the nation physically fight amen yes and just like that we have all the promises of God's word but God provided where is God preach the gospel amen if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen amen God preaching the gospel that is God's provided way Paul said I do not come to you with enticing words amen but with the foolishness of preaching the gospel amen so that is God's provided way it's always been God's provided way for each of us to come in we all had to have a personal experience with God Amen you can bring a sinner in the church you can you can tell him everything and try to to to give him theology around salvation try to give him a nice theology upon upon the Plan of Redemption that's not going to change him right because that man's heart need to be changed and it is with anointing that will break the Yoke of bondage amen amen it takes the anointing of the word to come forth and break that turn that Stony Heart to Heart of Flesh amen yes Lord and when that when that hardened heart is changed by the power of God and the preaching of the Gospel then you watch the Power of transformation amen preach under the corrected word amen under God's provided way then you watch the Power of transformation amen because if you don't have the correct word and if the people come because of the music oh yeah maybe they got they came under the the when the music was being plain and it suited them and then it it it brought some kind of a comfort to them like in the bully gram meetings and so forth remember bully was giving the illustration when he went out he preached people come to the altar call and then when he go back you can't even find 30 it's because you have to have the right word and only this word has the power to transform amen because this is not a candy coded gospel this word does introspection this word divides the bone and Marrow amen it comes into it cuts the Thunder amen it goes under is earn the secrets of the heart oh yes Lord amen and intense of the heart nothing could be hid front of this word yeah it cuts it slays but it does its job it doesn't doesn't do a petual from the top it goes from the inside out amen you now that's the power of the Gospel that's why it's always the gospel it's always the preaching of the Gospel amen amen amen if you want to see true Holiness you can go and tell people why you shouldn't cut your hair why you shouldn't that's not going to help them they need to have a change from the inside out amen amen amen and then watch the God's power of transformation then you can use the scripture be not conformed any longer to the pattern of the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen amen when conviction is brought then you watch justification then they come with true repentance right and when they come with true repentance then God will sanctify them fill them up with his holy ghost but you got to still feed them you still got to feed them it's a process it's a process amen because while the process is going on they got to be under covering if they're not under covering and they out there then they Satan's territory that same spirit that left them is going to come seven times worse it's going to bring a reinforcements and because now it's the Sanctified you're going to come and for and come for them so you see why brothers and sisters that are back we need to go yes and bring them back to the F amen amen but if you convince you'll be concerned amen amen he says God always made has made a provided way sometime he don't lead through Pleasant things yes yeah sometime it goes through the hardships but it's God's provided way God makes it anyhow you know I was 18 years old just 18 years old when I was there one day in one of the denomination churches the faith Revival Church in Phoenix and my granny forced me to go for prayer because I didn't have a job at the time and she pushed me to said go pray they had an alter call and that church when they have alter call about 500 people people there they had a guest speaker from the United States he left the entire 500 people now watch I'm showing you how God works now for he predestinated C and you might be wondering why I'm talking about a denomination church God can use a donkey to speak to balum now this person left 500 people and he came to me and he spoke to me that God will call me out to go and things like that I was only 18 years old and uh the first that brought this guest speaker and oh this is what he said he said I don't prophesy he said I'm not a prophet I don't prophesy but this is the first time that God is giving me a dust say the Lord for this young man he said I'm not a problem I never did this in my life it's the first time this happening I don't know you but it's the first time I got to just say the Lord for his young man amen and I was 18 years old now you think somebody is telling you that that's going to change your life that's not going to change your life yes you need the true preaching of the word the true gospel to change your life you need an experience I never had an exper I'm talking about somebody else is prophesying over me that's not my experience he's just telling me what God told him about me but that's not my experience you understand what I'm saying you follow what I'm saying amen then the the the pastor that brought this person said you you need to speak to this young man don't leave him oh yeah sorry the preacher said that don't leave this young man this preacher from America now go and fund him you must you all need to send him to Bible College go and find him send him to Bible College whatever so they said they want to see me at a certain time they called me the first time I went there there was the pastor wasn't there the second time he was there and then he called me I wasn't there and then it so happened that I went into the world and I properly went into the world now when I say I went to the world I really experien the world now so when I went into the world and always asked myself but why Lord if I you call me at that time why did I why you allow me to go into the world cuz nobody when they saved now likes the things that they did in the past nobody because you remember your taste bar changed now when you have your experience with God and God does his power of transformation you have a only man's taste you can't even imagine the life that you lived you know and the company that you kept you can't even imagine how could I be seated with that kind of company how could I been seated with this type of people people you know so I always question why Lord but then the scripture say all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord and are called according to his purpose amen the reason why the Lord showed me why are why you didn't use me at that time because if I went under Day Bible College I would have been influenced under their system yes I would have been saved under their system under the dogmas under the creeds but I was a child of God I was predestinated before the foundation of the world he wanted me a virgin bride amen I might I might have been living in the world on the outside but in the inside the seat of God it's perfect spotless sinless amen he already died for me amen am he said this is my Virgin bride no man can soow seed there amen amen this is my bride only I will put my seed in there you wouldn't allow me to go to the dogmas and creeds and in an appointed time and season I went to another non-denominational Bible college but there I would hear the name William Branham for the first time apart from hearing from I'm talking about outside now I'm talking from teaching now I heard the name William Bram and his teachings about Divine Healing sorry about his ministry about Divine Healing and God will orchestrate these things together because why he would want me to come under his provided way amen so you see how God work so now you look at your life and say these things are supernaturally orated that's right amen God puts things to he fixes things he brings you onto certain points of life to meet certain things amen he does these things for a reason yes thank you and then I said Thank You Lord thank you Lord now I appreciate going into the world it's better than going to the world and being stuck in dogmas and Creed and not receiving this beloved this beautiful message of the hour amen because this is the pearl of great price that I could give everything else up to can buy of this pearl of great price amen am amen so he says the church got to a place where they was kind of cowardly they climbed up in the upper room and stayed up there until 10 days at night and suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind not a preacher walking up the road saying now we'll go take you in by membership not in a Catholic priest to say well we'll give you the Holy Eucharist but the same God's provided way the Holy Ghost came down from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind it f all the house where they were sitting they didn't walk up and say I want to put my name on the church book they did it God's provided way amen they begin to run screaming amen speaking in tongues jumping around around and around shouting praising God amenallah Amen God's provided way amen so is that God's provided way when a man that's full with the Holy Ghost he can't keep quiet when a man that's full with the Holy Ghost they're showing that some life is in him amen that's something to place within him amen and he's going rattling and rattling about Jesus Christ and he's got such a Zeal about him he only wants to talk about Christ every opportunity he get you want to talk about Christ amen yes Lord amen and that's a man that's full of the Holy Ghost thank you Lord every opportunity

witness unto me amen yes go into all the world and preach the gospel he that believeth and baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe

yes yes even if it means we not going to be popular but let's come out of God's mandate amen let's hear from the Lord am let's follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit 1965 before he goes off the city he's still preaching leadership amen because why it's the Joshua Ministry amen the leadership of the Holy Ghost but how is he working through a fivefold Ministry yes amen amen there must be a man on the earth there must be men on the Earth right now that God will use yes amen because there is God's provided way amen oh yes Lord you say brother where is the Holy Ghost speaking to me he's working to through the five-fold ministry right amen thank you Lord so when you when you look at the five-fold ministry preaching you you got to have that you got to put it in your cont you got to put it in your mind that there is not a man speaking to me I am here to hear from the Holy Ghost I am here because Joshua is speaking to me Joshua the Holy Ghost is speaking to me he is the one that's leading me amen amen hey amen that's God's provided way he works the way this he worked it that way through the whole Testament amen he worked the way through through the New Testament yes through the apostles he worked the way through every Church age till he come in this age the prophet is of the scene now you must work through the five amen yes under the third pool he does that amen if you want to enjoy the blessings under the third po then you must come under the five4 ministry amen even it sin when God when you go when you're dealing with sin you got to do it God's provided way there's no shortcut amen he said God's provided way of dealing with sin God has a way we have a way but our ways are not God's ways yes and we can be in our way and God's way at the same time I like the way he says this just like a road map when I get ready to go home I don't say well now I set a compass that perhaps I live directly east and nor from here well I just took out in that direction I wouldn't get out of the city but there's been a provided way made for me yes amen so he say I get a road map see which way the road turns the mark where I turn to the left or to the right and so forth and follow the map closely I'll make my way home by the grace of God well God has a map he has a provided ways for us to go home to GL Glory yes that's what the five-fold ministry is doing right now yeah amen amen that's what the opening of the word come to give you rapturing Faith amen it's come to give you rapturing faith and the fivefold Mery is bringing out the same word to prepare you yes to take you to glory amen correct amen amen and this is your practice ground amen when you're going out now praying for the sick receiving healing and so forth there's going to be a final healing from Mortal to immortality yes this feeble body this pest is going to be healed yes amen and then if you go by the way of death then God has already prepared you amen there's going to be another body come pick you up amen you're going to this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved you already have one waiting for you amen amen God's provided way just like that he's provided a way for salvation amen he provided a way for Divine Healing yes so you can go and try and teach a person into salvation teach a person into Redemption uh The Plan of Redemption teach him teach him and uh or try and force him to come in come to come and come and listen come and listen but one day when the Holy Spirit works and that word drops down there yes amen you're not seeing the supernatural if you want eyes can be only open to Supernatural you can't see the angel of God is right there with the person and now he's working with amen sometime you feel this good bumps sometime you feel these things because Angels wings are passing through you thank you Lord amen because there's an Unseen World right here amen amen yes well sometimes you might have the negative thoughts oh I shouldn't you be you worry about things and the devil bring all thoughts in your mind maybe the devil reminding you of your failures he's reminding you of all the negative things in your life that's how the devil works sometime comes to oppress your mind yeah amen but cast out all these things amen amen cast it out in the name of Jesus thank you Jesus he said all that we lose on Earth shall be loose in heaven yeah all that we bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven amen so cast out every unclean thing unclean imagination amen we got to come back to God's way God has a way to support a church amen he is Jehovah our provider the Lord himself will provide if God has started a work then God will take that work through amen if it's a man it will fail if do God and no one can speak against it Hallelujah yes and even when they come from the back parts and look at the fals and look at everything all they will do is bless it amen am yes so he says today the way we bring men into church is giv him a letter sorry I was read this part God is a way to support a church not making blankets and having soup suppers but every man paying his tithes and offering into the church doing the way God said so said do and that scripture comes with a promise or with a where he said a challenge to God he said prove me yeah and then he also said I'll remove the Devourer from you that's right so if the Devourer devour you he he has the answer to it P your ti that's God's provided way for that God's got a provided way for a man to come into the church today the way we bring men into the church is give him a letter and bring him into the church the right end of Fellowship I had people telling me Oh I like the way my past visit me all the time the way you know they like the good old priest but they also don't know realize what the prophet said the man of God must be set apart giving time to the ministry giving time to prayer there will be a time where the pastor need to counsel with you Pastor needs to pray with you the pastor saw the certain need your need to come and do it but if you are relying on having your Christian work to be comforted all the time with the good old priest coming home then you're not in the right place because that's not going to happen here then you rather go join the Catholic church or the denomination amen I'm I'm just saying what the prophet saying he said God's got a provided way for a man to come to the church today the way we bring men to the church is to give him a the right and of Fellowship sprinkle little salt shaker full of water on top of his head and bring him into the church that's not what God Said God's got a different way from that to bring the people into his church by one Spirit see it's all coming back to the unity yes one mind one baptism amen amen one Accord yes he said by one Spirit we all baptize into one body amen by the holy spirit amen God's provided way of bringing men Christians into the Church Believers amen yes the Bible said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you now we It all becomes common to us but what we forgetting we have young people we have children growing up but he says is unto you and to your children yes and to them that's a far off maybe they in a backl condition amen they are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen so he's still calling the fact that the that the the that he still dealing with the Gentile he's still calling the grace of God is still here amen amen that must continue on as long as the Lord was calling God still promis the Holy Ghost amen amen amen the Holy Ghost is inexhaustible amen it can't finish that's God's provided way of coming to the church the only time the Holy Ghost leaves the the Gentile is when the Gentile doors are closed then he's done dealing with the Gentiles he goes back to the Jews and look at how close we are when all eyes is on the Jews and the whole world is persecuting the Jews but while all that is happening we can see where we are right now for a quick short work yes the work already started yes we're not going to reiterate and say we're going to we have to do this work it started amen amen so get in the business of God get into your father's business and follow the quick short work it's not a long work get in now don't wait for next year don't wait for another time don't wait for another season this is the season thank you Jesus amen the shout of the king is in the camp amen hallelujah he's leading you into this battle and he's going to slay every enemy amen yes Lord thank you Jesus go and possess the gates of the enemy every place that the foot s of your foot shall tread upon you shall possess amen want to go do evangelism work out there possess that land amen possess that place you want to speak to your workmate go and possess that conversation amen am you want to speak to your loved one go and possess the conversation amen he says as Dr BOS what used to say the baby that cries the loudest gets the best service that's the that's about the way it is that goes for God's children he said I could parallel that for you you a man get up get up on say chew is chewing gum real well you know father I'm here tonight if you want to give me the Holy Ghost all right I'm here but if you want to heal me I'm sitting here but if you don't want all right it's your will Lord he's done Dr the W out yeah in the Bible this is your will amen amen amen thank you Lord amen why we call it the New Testament what's the Testament you always have the last Testament of the world why we can't call it the last Testament is because he's alive this is this is him that was dead and now living and alive forever more that's why it's not the last Testament it's the New Testament because it's for a new species amen hallelujah a new generation amen and this is the god species amen because the gene of God is in you yes might be strong for some of us but it's the gene of God it's the god speci amen it's not an animal species you came by the the animal nature the animal species but this is the god species this is the image of God Amen Hallelujah but nevertheless he says this is your will all right this is your will right here and if you want me to have it I'll have it but nevertheless if you don't why it's all right you'll never get no way you know the attitude Lord I want to be healed if you want to it's okay if you don't want it's your world then you are not agreeing with his word then you are disbelieving his word there is unbelief if you believe is what the Lord yes you said you said by your strip we are ill amen that is not my word that is your word you are not man that you should lie amen Lord and you are the same yesterday today and forever amen father I have the back problem right now you heal the other brother with a back problem now you're obligated to heal me because your word says you are the same yesterday today and forever I'm claiming the same promise and under the same condition in the same Atmosphere by the same Faith father you obligated to heal me that's right take him by his word yes be certain of God yes amen but when you show him you don't believe his word then you're going nowhere that's what the prophet of God says he said but let that one get there and cry out amen like bu Robinson he stopped in the middle of the cornfield he tied up his mule he said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back you'll find a pile of bone rain right here I'm going to stay here till I get it that's business am that is believing God's word that is now knowing that I'm going to take you by your word Lord you obligated to your word Lord amen yes Lord amen amen yes how many of us can get in the desperation for the things that we have need of Amen how many of can get in desperation for the things that we have here said Lord that is your word I am claiming this word I'm going to persevere Lord till I get it hallelujah thank you Lord that's God's provided way amen amen thank you God always recommends to his people his believing children to always go in his provided way that's God's idea to recommend to his children is provided way amen cry for what you have need of thank you Lord he wants you to cry out amen oh you thinking God is getting angry when you cry no he wants you to cry out amen amen remember that woman went to the wicked judge for a son and she cried out to him even though he's a wicked judge you don't want to listen to but because of a nagging and cry he had to listen to her so how much much more your lord who is not Wicked he's willing to answer the Cry of his children amen amen amen when the children of Israel went down there in Egypt when they began to cry out to him when the they couldn't take the Tas maskers the whoop of the Tas maskers anymore what happened they begin to cry out to Jehovah God and he began to hear the cry and he answered to the cry yes if my people who are called my name shall humble himself and turn from the Wicked Ways and I will heal the land amen he said Thank You Lord when Peter started out walking on the water he thought he was getting along all right see how big I'm doing he started sinking he didn't say well I guess it failed on down to the bottom a few bubbles come up and that was all of it see no sir he cried out Lord Lord save me amen amen and that Eternal end reached down and picked him up again why he cried outy yourself in a situation and say Lord I can't help myself Lord save me amen Lord help me Lord I layest burden of mine is so heavy Lord oh this financial burden is so heavy but I lay it at your feet right now you are Jehovah J my provider Lord open your windows of Heaven pour out your blessings upon me yes cry out to him amen you receive because you ask not amen you receive not because you

long enough wow God don't want some wishy washy prayer no he wants communication you see sometime we just going and we asking God for things but you can't ask God for something you don't have a relationship with him you know it's so much easier when you have a relationship with somebody to have communication with him if you don't have a relationship with somebody haven't seen somebody for a long time haven't spoken it's not easy to speak to them you feel uncomfortable right so if you're not having your communic your private communication with God yeah and you're not having fellowship with him it's not going to be easy for you to just speak to him he's willing to hear you but you're going to feel uncomfortable you're not going to have the confidence but if you have a relationship a constant relationship with him constant communication with him constant fellowship with him that's true yes then you know how to approach him amen and then when you approach him you have to understand him yeah understand God's nature yes his word makes you understand his nature look at the way he works when you understand his nature then you'll know how to approach him and that is God's provided way of doing things amen that's the what's the matter with the church we don't lay there long enough we don't cry out long enough we don't hold on to it if a little baby want something you kick and scream turn red in the Facey so God wants us to come like that amen cry out to him come like that little baby amen the childlike Faith amen so we find that we were called to possess our homeland amen

to drive you into the Homeland if National Force is driving Israel to the Homeland right now there's a persecution around the Jews around the world and that's going to be driving them driving them back to the Homeland yes so God uses National Force for Israel God is going to use the power the preaching of the Gospel to drive you amen amen yes amen amen so don't let someone tell you you don't
