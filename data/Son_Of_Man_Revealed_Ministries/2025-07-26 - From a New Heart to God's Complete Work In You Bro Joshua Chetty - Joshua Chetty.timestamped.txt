[0:00] Each one needs may differ one from the
[0:02] other, but we know that you're more than
[0:04] able to meet with every need, Father.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; And I pray, Lord, the bless, the best
[0:09] blessing from the service that we can
[0:10] receive now, Lord, is your word, Lord,
[0:13] being implanted in our hearts, oh God.
[0:15] And I pray now as we give praise and
[0:18] glory and honor and reverence to you. We
[0:20] give thanks to you. We ask it now in
[0:22] Jesus name. Amen. And amen.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be found in the eyes of
[0:28] God once again.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We all glad to be found once again
[0:43] &gt;&gt; uh in the house of God on a Wednesday
[0:45] night meeting
[0:46] &gt;&gt; to come and get refreshed in his
[0:48] presence. Amen.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:50] our Bibles to turn to the book of
[0:52] Ezekiel, chapter 36, reading from verse
[0:56] 26- 27.
[0:59] the book of Ezekiel.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; A new art also would I give you, and a
[1:08] new spirit will I put within you,
[1:12] and I will take away the stony art of
[1:14] your flesh,
[1:16] and I will give you an heart of flesh,
[1:22] and I will put my spirit within you.
[1:26] So firstly he's saying here he's going
[1:28] to take away your stony art out of your
[1:31] flesh.
[1:33] Then he said I will give you an art of
[1:35] flesh.
[1:37] Then he'll say then he says then he says
[1:41] and I will put my spirit
[1:43] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:44] &gt;&gt; within you.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; So there got to be a change first. He's
[1:48] got to change your your spirit.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Then he's going to put his spirit in
[1:52] you. Amen. and cause you to walk in my
[1:56] statutes and ye shall keep my judgments
[2:00] and do them. Very quickly to the book of
[2:03] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 1 and 2.
[2:11] D E therefore followers of God as dear
[2:15] children and walk in love as Christ also
[2:19] had loved us and had given himself for
[2:22] us an offering and a sacrifice to God
[2:26] for his sweet smelling savor. Amen.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; Just before we be seated, one more
[2:32] scripture. Uh 2 Corinthians 2:15.
[2:35] It reads, "For we are unto God a sweet
[2:40] savor of Christ in them that are saved
[2:42] and in them that perish." Amen. You may
[2:44] be seated.
[2:51] So God is saying, you know, the prophet
[2:53] of God tells us,
[2:56] he says,
[2:58] I just read it to you the way he says
[2:59] it.
[3:02] He says, notice in the tabernacle, God
[3:04] lived in them three rooms. You lived in
[3:07] three rooms.
[3:09] I've got, he said, brother Madam, I've
[3:11] got 10 rooms in my house, but you're
[3:13] still only living in three. That's
[3:15] right. He said that's the kitchen,
[3:18] dining room, the kitchen, the living
[3:20] room, and the bedroom. So you, no matter
[3:23] how many rooms you got in a home, you're
[3:25] actually only living in three rooms. All
[3:27] right? So you may have three bedrooms.
[3:31] You may have a subkitchen, call a dining
[3:33] room, but there's still only three rooms
[3:35] in your house.
[3:37] You're living in a house, soul, body,
[3:40] and spirit.
[3:42] That's the way God lived in Jesus
[3:44] Christ.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is not going to live in any
[3:46] other way.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; The way he lived in Christ is the way
[3:50] he's going to live in us.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Now it's easy in our Christian walk or
[3:57] as many Christians believe it's easy to
[3:59] focus on the purpose why Jesus come and
[4:02] they focus on yes he came he was born
[4:04] and he had to die and raise again.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; But we are also the the message of the
[4:10] hour comes to bring us into the image of
[4:13] Christ.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are if we have to come into
[4:16] the image of the Christ we have to
[4:19] follow Christ lifestyle.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; And watch his image through the
[4:23] scriptures.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is the mystery of God being
[4:27] revealed. And we know he's a principal
[4:29] theme of the Bible. But when we look at
[4:31] his earthly journey, he showed us the
[4:33] life. Amen. And we got to follow his his
[4:36] his uh image because right from infancy
[4:40] right from there at the age of 12 when
[4:43] he was in the temple
[4:45] and he was speaking to the priest and so
[4:48] forth the scribes and Pharisees and so
[4:50] forth and then when Mary and Joseph came
[4:52] looking for him they they said we your
[4:54] father's been looking for he said the
[4:56] word now in infancy stage is correcting
[4:59] the error.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. He said, "Don't you know about I'm
[5:03] about my father's business."
[5:05] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was showing us there the very
[5:08] type that if we had to follow Christ, he
[5:11] was always about the father's business.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; And the word was growing from infancy to
[5:16] a mature catcher. Amen.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; And there were different stages along
[5:20] the journey.
[5:24] So he says to us, so if Christ lived in,
[5:26] if God lived in Christ in that way, he
[5:29] says that's the way God lived in Jesus
[5:31] Christ, both soul, body, and spirit.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; He said, not me that doeth the works,
[5:37] the father that dwelleth in me.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; So we know that we have to for for God
[5:43] to dwell in us. The prophet of God says,
[5:45] he says, "And in this tabernacle
[5:47] completion, and it was also through the
[5:49] age of Luda, to justification, to the
[5:52] age of Wesley to sanctification, and in
[5:54] this latter day with the baptism of the
[5:57] Holy Ghost, perfecting his church in
[5:59] three stages of the journey, all around
[6:03] everything's three."
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; He said, notice, "And then God taken his
[6:08] church in this great tabernacle.
[6:11] Now those the mana fell outside in the
[6:14] courts
[6:15] &gt;&gt; and remember the people eat this mana
[6:18] but God told them to take up this mana
[6:21] and put it a bunch of it back in the
[6:24] holy place.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; And there was the ark. The ark is a type
[6:28] of the human heart.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; The ark. The place the hidden place.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he says, "God prophesied to
[6:37] the prophet and said, I will write my
[6:40] laws in their hearts."
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; Where I put them in the table of their
[6:45] hearts,
[6:46] &gt;&gt; showing that there that they would be
[6:50] that that would be the dwelling place of
[6:52] God in the human hearts.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Not the human heads.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; But the human hearts.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I will write them in my h in
[7:02] their hearts and they'll they'll keep my
[7:06] statutes and so forth say the Lord. Now
[7:09] God said in another place over in
[7:11] Ezekiel he said I will in that day take
[7:15] out your old flesh fleshy stony and I'll
[7:19] give you a new spirit.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; I'll put my spirit in you.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:26] Now a lot of people even you Pentecostal
[7:29] people a lot of time get mistaken in
[7:31] that you get a new spirit that's not
[7:35] God's spirit that's you.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; That isn't God. You get a little happy
[7:40] because you got a new spirit and you
[7:42] jump up and down, run around all over
[7:44] the floor maybe and shout a little bit
[7:47] and speak with tongues and run around a
[7:49] little bit and think you got the Holy
[7:51] Ghost.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; That's not it.
[7:54] That's a new spirit God gave you.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; That's you. Then after he give you your
[8:00] spirit, then he said, "I'll put my
[8:03] spirits."
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:05] &gt;&gt; You see why God just couldn't put his
[8:07] spirit.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; There had to be a change of heart.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Change your nature. There had to be a
[8:11] nature change because you had to become,
[8:14] you had to adapt to his spirit. Amen.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the matter with the missile
[8:21] cramps you got today. That's right.
[8:24] That's the reason you can get nowhere
[8:26] with God.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; So you see, you can't bypass certain
[8:30] things in the walk with God.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; You wonder why after so many years
[8:34] you've come and you sitted in the
[8:36] message of the hour, received the
[8:37] message of the hour, but you're not
[8:39] progressing in your walk
[8:41] &gt;&gt; because you can't bypass these steps.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; You wonder why sometimes some people are
[8:46] still all still got that old starchy
[8:49] ways. There's still no character
[8:51] development in them.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; There's still no progression in their
[8:54] walk.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; You go there, they're always grumpy.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; They're always miserable. They're always
[9:00] negative
[9:00] &gt;&gt; because there hasn't been a change of
[9:02] heart.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. They still got a stony heart.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; They are still They might be receiving
[9:08] the message, but it's receiving it by
[9:10] intellect.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Receiving it out of this. God wants to
[9:15] dwell in the arts.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; He don't want to he don't want you to
[9:17] have a head knowledge of the message.
[9:19] Yes, Lord.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; It want it want his word to be embedded
[9:22] in your hearts.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the betting ground for the
[9:28] word. Amen.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; Now, notice
[9:32] you put a new spirit, God has to give
[9:35] you a new spirit or you couldn't even
[9:37] get along with him.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[9:39] &gt;&gt; you can get along with yourself.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; That old devil spirit you had in you.
[9:45] So, he's got to put a new spirit in you
[9:48] so you can get along with his spirit.
[9:50] Amen.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will put a new spirit in
[9:54] them. And I will put my spirit in them."
[9:58] He said, "After give you a new spirit,
[10:00] that's you."
[10:02] Don't get it confused with God's spirit.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; It's your spirit. So, you can get along
[10:10] with the Holy Spirit.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's doing a change in you now.
[10:16] Amen. He's preparing you to receive him
[10:18] the Holy Ghost.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because why? He wants to come in
[10:22] the control tower of your heart.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; From there he wants to navigate your
[10:26] life.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; From there he's going to teach you his
[10:29] words.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Because he said I will not leave you
[10:32] comfortless.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; I will be with you even in you.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:41] So he says, "Don't get it confused with
[10:43] God's spirit. It's not you. It's your
[10:45] spirit. So you you can get along with
[10:48] the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to
[10:51] you." Amen. Cuz you in your condition
[10:55] never get along. You can't get along
[10:57] with your wife. You can't get along with
[10:59] your husband. Can't get along with your
[11:01] neighbor. How are you ever going to get
[11:04] along with God? Yes.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; So, he has to give you a new spirit for
[11:09] you can get along with him.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Because God's aim is for you to come
[11:15] into oneness with him.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; God's aim is for you to project his very
[11:20] image.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; For you to walk in his very to be a
[11:23] partaker of his divine nature.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:29] So he says, "So he puts a new spirit in
[11:33] you and then he puts his spirit in you.
[11:36] Gives you a new spirit, a new outlook,
[11:39] new faith, then he puts his holy spirit
[11:41] in you."
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:46] That's why after Peter after the baptism
[11:49] of the Holy Ghost comes down on the day
[11:51] of Pentecost,
[11:53] Peter is preaching a message. Amen. And
[11:55] they're asking Peter, "Now, what do we
[11:57] do to be saved?" Now, Peter had the key
[12:00] to the kingdom. Amen. Because prior to
[12:03] that,
[12:05] he had a revelation of who Jesus Christ
[12:07] is. Amen.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Peter, I give you the
[12:09] key."
[12:10] &gt;&gt; And here's Peter now is now opening this
[12:14] key to the kingdom on the day of
[12:15] Pentecost. Amen. People are pricked in
[12:18] their heart. They believing what he
[12:20] said. He's preaching a profound message.
[12:22] The same Peter that denied Jesus Christ,
[12:24] but they can see a change in him. The
[12:26] same Peter was a hardened man. The The
[12:28] same Peter who would curse God, who
[12:30] would curse the people because he was
[12:32] denying Jesus Christ, but now there's a
[12:34] change in his heart. Amen. There was a
[12:36] preparation taking place so God could
[12:38] drop down his spirit in him. Amen.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; And then he's ask they're asking now
[12:42] Peter, we can see a change in you. We
[12:45] can see something's happening here,
[12:46] Peter. Because we are looking at your
[12:48] life what it was then and we seeing the
[12:50] change. We sing the power of
[12:51] transformation in your life. We believe
[12:54] your message Peter because why you're
[12:56] not just preaching a message Peter is
[12:57] the change in you.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say now what do we do? Be saved
[13:02] Peter. Then he says then Peter said unto
[13:04] them repent every one of you and be
[13:06] baptized every one of you in the name of
[13:09] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[13:12] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[13:15] Holy Ghost.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; You must come first into true
[13:18] repentance. Yes.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, baptism
[13:23] of the Holy Ghost. You cannot bypass
[13:25] these stages.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And true repentance come with a
[13:31] man that man with a son and daughter of
[13:34] God when they come when they come to
[13:36] realization that I cannot do this on my
[13:38] own.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; I cannot save serve God. I'm I am a
[13:42] sinner.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in Romans 3:23,
[13:45] for all have sinned and fallen short of
[13:47] the glory of God. Yes.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You realize that you can't do
[13:51] anything to save yourself.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; And you come to true repentance. Say,
[13:55] "Lord,
[13:56] &gt;&gt; I need salvation. I need to be saved.
[13:58] Lord, true repentance brought by the
[14:01] altar. Having a genuine something must
[14:03] be pricked in your heart. It's a
[14:05] personal experience. Somebody else
[14:07] cannot give you that experience."
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody can preach it to you, but they
[14:11] cannot give it to you. Amen. It's your
[14:13] personal experience with God. You got to
[14:15] have that. It's a one-on-one encounter
[14:18] with God.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; The word will be preached to you. And by
[14:21] the preaching of the word, God uses the
[14:23] preaching of the word to convict the
[14:24] heart. So if your heart is convicted,
[14:27] something's got to take place within
[14:28] you. Then you got to come to a
[14:30] realization of true repentance.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; And then when you come to realization,
[14:35] you got to believe the words.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't we receive the the message
[14:39] the other day? this gentile woman, this
[14:41] widow woman, when the word came to her,
[14:44] Amen. She first had to before the pro,
[14:46] there was a prophecy in there that the
[14:48] barrels don't run dry, oil won't run
[14:51] out, but she had to receive the word
[14:53] first.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. She had to obey the word first.
[14:56] Amen.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; She took the word in her heart and she
[15:00] obeyed the word and she's going now to
[15:02] be to sacrifice all that she had. And
[15:05] she took the two sticks. Amen. But
[15:07] something took place in her. She began
[15:09] to be bubbly. She began to praise God
[15:11] because she saw there was a man of God
[15:13] speaking to her and she knew there was a
[15:15] prophecy that's going to come to pass.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; She believed the man of God. Amen.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; She believed the word of his prophecy.
[15:21] Amen.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; And but before the prophecy come to
[15:24] pass, there had to be a sacrifice that
[15:27] you had to take take place. Amen. She
[15:29] had to become obedient to the words.
[15:31] Amen. Then she took the she took the the
[15:34] flour. She took the oil. But then she
[15:37] had to put it on two sticks. Amen. And
[15:39] then she had to burn the fire. Amen.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Because why? It had to now to for it to
[15:45] come into that proper bread that she's
[15:48] going to bake. Amen. It had to go
[15:50] through the fire. Amen.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; But it took a sacrifice before the
[15:54] prophecy comes to pass.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Before God's prophecy come to pass in
[15:58] your life, in my life. Amen. We've got
[16:00] to become obedient to the word.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a sacrifice. We've got
[16:04] to die to self. Amen.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; So you find that
[16:12] when is the true change in you. Amen.
[16:15] And you receive that. Then you take the
[16:16] word baptized in the way he wants you to
[16:19] be baptized. Amen. In the name of the
[16:21] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[16:24] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[16:26] of the Holy Ghost.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; People stopped when he started shouting.

[16:44] gifts of the Holy Spirit. But when it
[16:47] was he the Holy Ghost himself. Amen.
[16:50] There was a difficult part
[16:52] &gt;&gt; because there's a responsibility on a
[16:55] person when they received him the Holy
[16:57] Ghost.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost will not make you
[17:00] live your life contrary to his nature.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost navigates your life. The
[17:06] Holy Ghost brings conviction upon you.
[17:08] The minute you think evil thoughts,
[17:10] &gt;&gt; the minute you want to do something
[17:11] contrary to his word, he brings you into
[17:13] submission to his word.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He brings you into a full
[17:16] submission to his word.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; He makes you live a surrendered life.
[17:20] Amen.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; People don't want to do that because
[17:23] why? They want to have it the easy way.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Because why? the influence of Leia is
[17:28] upon him.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he's come to give us, he wants
[17:32] us, but he come in this day to give us
[17:34] the mind of Christ to be seated in
[17:36] heavenly places to live above. Amen.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; To live above our circumstances, to live
[17:42] above the worldly situations. Amen. He's
[17:45] given us an anointing of a flying eagle
[17:47] in his day.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's anointed. That's why though
[17:51] you can receive the word, but you got to
[17:53] receive the anointing that comes with
[17:54] the word.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you receive the anointing
[17:57] that comes in the word, Amen. It's the
[17:59] anointing that will keep you above.
[18:00] Amen. In heavenly places.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; So we know the prophet told us about the
[18:08] three stages of God inward work in a
[18:11] believer. Amen.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Just for the topic tonight, we speaking
[18:15] on from a new spirit to spirit. Amen.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; Because firstly, there got to be a
[18:22] change of your heart.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. from your stony heart to heart out
[18:25] of flesh. In other words, he's changing
[18:26] your nature. He's changing your spirit
[18:29] to adapt to his spirit.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; He's changing your spirit that is not
[18:33] contrary to his spirit. The boat must
[18:35] complement each other.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The boat must get on with each
[18:39] other.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; The boat must be in oneness. He said,
[18:42] "Father, may they be one even as we are
[18:45] one."
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Christ and his church must come into
[18:49] oneness.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what King Aasserus was
[18:54] waiting for.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; He was waiting for his queen to come
[18:59] into union with him.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; But he built a complex. When he was
[19:05] rejected by Vashi
[19:07] &gt;&gt; when Vashi rejected him, the king built
[19:09] a complex because this king was a
[19:12] gentleman. He wasn't going to force
[19:14] himself to go to the queen.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; He wanted the queen to come to him. And
[19:19] then he went he must have went to a
[19:22] stage of depression and then he went to
[19:24] the inner court
[19:26] of the king's palace and he was there
[19:29] but Es Esther needed to approach him.
[19:32] Amen. But through the five-fold ministry
[19:35] having the same influence having the
[19:38] influence of Morai of William Brandham's
[19:40] message through the having the influence
[19:42] on the five-fold ministry which is what
[19:44] the Holy Ghost working through the
[19:46] five-fold ministry.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It has to be the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[19:50] But he said, "I'll run this trail
[19:52] again." So, who's riding this trail?
[19:53] Who's riding this trail again? It's the
[19:55] Holy Ghost.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll ride this trail again."
[19:58] It's not man riding the trail. It's the
[20:00] Holy Ghost riding the trail. But the
[20:02] Holy Ghost works with man
[20:04] &gt;&gt; and he's working through the five-fold
[20:06] ministry.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; And so, he brings Esther now into show
[20:13] what you should be doing in an hour.
[20:15] Amen. Then she has that she puts on a a
[20:17] royal apparel. Amen. What it is showing
[20:20] that she's the queen now.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; And then when she goes to the king now
[20:27] that is what he wanted all the time. He
[20:29] wasn't going to force and call for her.
[20:31] He waiting for her to come to him.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet says the Holy Ghost is
[20:37] a gentleman.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; He's not going to force himself to you.
[20:40] Amen. Yes.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; That's why in the letter when he said in
[20:42] this day when the door we know what the
[20:45] door is coming to the message of the
[20:47] hour. Amen. Coming in this day when the
[20:49] Holy Ghost is coming down they put him
[20:52] out the church because why? They are the
[20:54] wrong door.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he's coming to the right door.
[20:57] Amen.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; And then when we know the door is
[21:02] through marriage is through a union.
[21:03] Amen. And we know now when this king
[21:06] when when when this king sees
[21:11] Esther
[21:13] all his complex the complex that he
[21:15] built up this depression that he built
[21:17] up is all gone now
[21:20] &gt;&gt; because when he sees that all he sees
[21:21] how much he loves her
[21:23] &gt;&gt; how much he wants to be with her how
[21:25] much he longs to be with her and then he
[21:28] knows that they two must become one
[21:30] &gt;&gt; there must be a oneness with them amen
[21:33] that's why Jesus said, "Many will come
[21:35] to me in that day and said, Lord, Lord,
[21:38] have I not prophesied in your name?
[21:40] Lord, have I not cast out demons in in
[21:42] your name?" He said, "Depart from me,
[21:44] workers of iniquity. I know you not."
[21:47] &gt;&gt; No union, no relationship, no wonders.
[21:50] Amen. But this king now when he sees
[21:55] they come into they come into your union
[21:58] because what the king what is the aim of
[21:59] the king? He must have someone. He must
[22:02] come into oneness with his queen so he
[22:04] can reproduce himself.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Because he's going to he's going to die
[22:09] otherwise a depressed man.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; He's got a queen and he's waiting to
[22:14] come into oneness with the queen so he
[22:16] can reproduce himself.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what? So so this will be the
[22:21] heir of the throne.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:24] And so when he sees Esther and then he
[22:27] sees himself now this is the time where
[22:30] this king can come in oneness and when
[22:32] she comes into this position when she
[22:36] comes and recognizes uh who she really
[22:39] is and what she can do now that is the
[22:43] time where she can rewrite the laws
[22:46] &gt;&gt; because why that's the power that she
[22:49] possess. Amen. that thou must prophesy
[22:51] again before nation, tongues, and kings.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; He said the church,
[22:58] they've got the they got their own
[22:59] mouthpiece. Amen. But he said they will
[23:02] be one that will have be who speak for
[23:04] him
[23:04] &gt;&gt; in and through this bride. Amen. He said
[23:07] she will become the final voice in the
[23:09] final age.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; God will fulfill his work through this
[23:12] bride. Amen. So he says
[23:18] the prophet of God says
[23:21] here God is working in three stages of
[23:23] of a inward work in every believer.
[23:26] Amen.
[23:27] We know that firstly we were talking
[23:29] about a prophet we have to have a change
[23:31] of heart. Amen. What he does now removes
[23:34] our stony unbelieving heart.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The heart that kind of heart
[23:41] through our intellect we learned we go
[23:43] to school we get an education we
[23:45] influence in school we influenced
[23:47] through the media we influenced by the
[23:49] people around us how we see things in
[23:51] around our life but when there's a
[23:53] change of heart and when we see things
[23:56] to God's word we see things differently
[23:59] amen
[23:59] &gt;&gt; we no longer walk after the way we used
[24:02] to walk
[24:03] &gt;&gt; amen
[24:04] &gt;&gt; and therefore you'll find that people
[24:06] around you people know you will see a
[24:08] change in you.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; They will see a develop a character
[24:11] development in you.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; That they never saw before. They say,
[24:15] "But you used to be this person. You
[24:17] used to be this person that used to
[24:18] drink a lot. You used to be a person
[24:20] that used to swear a lot. Used to be a
[24:22] violent person. What has happened to
[24:24] you?
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Tell me why you changed. They will see
[24:28] it in you. It becomes visible in you."
[24:30] Amen.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; So what happened? It gives you a tender
[24:34] teachable spirit.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. You are able to have a teachable
[24:37] spirit
[24:38] &gt;&gt; and learn the things of God.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; You're not hardened to the things of
[24:42] God.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; That is why when you can when you have
[24:46] when you when there was a time and
[24:48] season for you to receive the message of
[24:50] the hour,
[24:51] &gt;&gt; you had a teachable spirit towards it.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Although you you see you're hearing from
[24:56] a man that that is dead and gone a long
[24:59] time ago.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; What made you believe it?
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Because you had representation in you.
[25:04] Oh, thank you.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You had a teachable spirit. Amen.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; To receive the thing that you're
[25:09] receiving, but yet you didn't have the
[25:12] Holy Ghost as yet. Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Then he says,
[25:17] "The Holy Ghost must come in you now."
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; God himself to dwell in you.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; When you are now ready,
[25:25] &gt;&gt; when there's a change, Amen. When
[25:27] there's a transformation inside you,
[25:30] &gt;&gt; your your stony heart now is a heart of
[25:32] flesh. Now
[25:33] &gt;&gt; he's given you a new spirit which is
[25:35] tender now.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; The one that can receive God. The one
[25:38] can worship God. The one that wants to
[25:40] praise God. The ones that want the one
[25:42] that wants to come into every service.
[25:44] The one wants to read the Bible. The one
[25:46] that wants to pray all the time. The one
[25:48] that want to raise up his hands and
[25:50] worship God.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; And always bubbly. The one that always
[25:56] rejoicing. Amen.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; You must go through the fiery trials.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; You must go through the sufferings. You
[26:27] must be persecuted for Christ. Amen.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; And then when you go through all the
[26:33] stages, you must take up your cross and
[26:35] follow him. But what happened after the
[26:37] cross, the power of the resurrection,
[26:39] &gt;&gt; the power of the resurrected Lord living
[26:41] amongst you.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. What it is? It was a meal offering
[26:46] that the that was there given to the
[26:48] lady. Amen. To the widow woman. Amen.
[26:50] That she gave to the prophet.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what happened when she put it
[26:54] in a fire? That meal offering came
[26:56] alive. Amen.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; It was ready. Amen. So just like that
[27:00] Christ is the meal offering that went to
[27:02] the cross. But when he went to the cross
[27:05] and endured the cross after that comes
[27:08] Christ again. Amen. The bread of life
[27:10] that was available to the church now.

[27:14] Christ. All that was in Christ he poured
[27:16] into his church.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happened? The power
[27:21] of the resurrection must be displayed
[27:22] amongst us.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; It's no longer seeing God of history.
[27:26] It's saying the living God. here amongst
[27:28] us the living God dwelling amongst his
[27:31] people
[27:32] &gt;&gt; to prove that Jesus Christ is the same
[27:35] yesterday, today and forever.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we say he's the same
[27:40] yesterday, today and forever. In other
[27:42] words, we need to watch the lives that
[27:44] he lived.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; The life of Christ must be displayed in
[27:47] his church.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; If Christ started the church and Christ
[27:51] is in charge of the church, then Christ
[27:53] must project his life through the
[27:55] church.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:59] So we find that yes fair enough we we we
[28:02] took our old hearts and he gave us the
[28:04] heart of flesh. Then he gave us a new
[28:07] spirit. Amen. But that spirit was what?
[28:10] So we can get on with the Holy Ghost.
[28:12] But the Holy Ghost now is the one that
[28:15] can bring you now as an adopted son of
[28:17] God. That can bring you now as a son of
[28:19] God, a daughter of God. Amen.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Because out of the Holy Ghost, he said I
[28:25] will not leave you comfortless. In other
[28:27] words, I won't leave you as an orphan
[28:28] here. Amen. I will come and I'll adopt
[28:31] you to myself. Amen.
[28:35] What happened to Esther? When her father
[28:38] and her parents died, she was an orphan.

[29:30] mouthpiece for God when the world is in
[29:33] gross darkness
[29:34] is are you preserved for such a time of
[29:36] this? When the character of Christ must
[29:38] be displayed when you are saved for the
[29:41] greater works in his hour.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. in an hour for manifesting Christ
[29:45] upon the earth.

[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; We want we don't want to manifest a
[29:56] church. We don't want to manifest men.
[29:59] We want to manifest Christ.

[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to manifest Christ in such
[30:04] a way that when the unbeliever comes
[30:06] here, the unbeliever must be convicted.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the sick is here, when the
[30:10] people are demon possessed that are
[30:12] here, the demons don't stand in the
[30:14] presence of God.
[30:16] [Music]
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Just like what the what they said to
[30:19] Jesus.
[30:20] Oh, what what have we to do with you? Or
[30:23] what you have why have you come in this
[30:25] hour? And then Jesus cast him out into
[30:27] the piece.
[30:30] Amen. So the stony art was typing the
[30:34] nature of our sin, sinful nature. Amen.
[30:37] stubborn, unbelieving.
[30:40] It was there before God could dwell
[30:41] indwell in us.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; And he removed that. Therefore, now the
[30:46] things that we used to do, we don't
[30:49] desire them no more.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; If you take someone who's a believer,
[30:54] who's full of the Holy Ghost now, and go
[30:55] leave them there. They won't be able to
[30:57] stand it.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Even if he falls, he won't be able to
[31:02] stay in that condition.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; He will come out of it.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can throw him in the P and
[31:06] come out of it.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[31:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Your ch your chain body has changed. You
[31:17] now have a holy man's taste.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; You can now have a thinking man's
[31:21] filter.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; You are able to see the things that are
[31:24] wrong. You're able to see the things
[31:25] that you used to do. You can't do it
[31:27] anymore.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; You you can't digest it because why? You
[31:31] you you can't digest those things
[31:33] anymore. You're It's contrary to the
[31:36] nature that you have.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:42] [Music]
[31:44] &gt;&gt; So he gives us a new spirit after our
[31:45] conversion, a desire to do right.
[31:50] But many people are happy with that.
[31:53] Many people are just happy I've got the
[31:54] message of the hour.
[31:58] I've received it. I've got a spirit and
[32:00] I received it. But how many people I
[32:03] want to say, Lord, I don't want just to
[32:05] be
[32:07] in the message. I want the message to be
[32:09] in me.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just say I'm in the
[32:12] message. I want the message living in
[32:14] me. I want to be the manifested word.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to just have the
[32:20] written word, the spoken word. I want to
[32:22] be the manifested word in this hour.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; I want to walk out of the scripture that
[32:27] I believe in.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; You know your word. Yes. We can all
[32:31] quote the scriptures about us.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; We all can know the word that we're
[32:34] walking in. But can we walk out of the
[32:37] scriptures?
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Can we live out the scriptures?
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Can the scriptures that pertain to us
[32:43] live out through us?
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Live out in this hour when we
[32:49] about to leave the earth
[32:52] cuz it's time of the change is going to
[32:54] soon to be the changing of the baton.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; The gospel must go back to the Jews.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:00] [Music]
[33:04] Amen.
[33:09] He says, "Now the Bible said that he
[33:14] would give us a new heart and he would
[33:15] give us a new spirit." And and many
[33:17] people,
[33:19] even Pentecostal people and full gospel
[33:21] people have been deceived in that many
[33:24] times, God said, "I'll give you a new
[33:26] spirit." That wasn't his spirit. That's
[33:29] your spirit. He said, "Then I will put
[33:31] my spirit in you. I'll give you a new
[33:34] spirit and I will put my spirit in you."
[33:36] And many times you get the new spirit
[33:38] and think you've got the Holy Spirit.
[33:41] And trusting upon emotions and signs and
[33:44] things when your life doesn't pervy up
[33:49] to that. Now that's just a little raw.
[33:52] But remember it's the truth.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Many people the spirit that spirit that
[33:58] new spirit God had to give you a new
[34:01] spirit to get along with his spirit. Now
[34:02] don't be deceived when people are
[34:04] jumping and shouting and amen. That's
[34:06] that's all good. That's all needed. It
[34:09] creates an atmosphere. But don't be
[34:11] deceived and think that person is full
[34:12] of the Holy Ghost.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Watch the life that follows after that.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Watch if there is a life of consistency.
[34:19] Watch if there's a life of progression
[34:20] in the word.
[34:23] Amen.
[34:24] So he said so doubtful up and down. God
[34:27] has to give you a new spirit, give you a
[34:29] new nature so you can get along with his
[34:31] spirit when it comes. Amen. I hope you
[34:34] see it. God gives you a new spirit for
[34:36] yourself then puts his holy spirit in
[34:38] there to dwell with you and abide with
[34:41] you. Notice the same manner that was eat
[34:45] out in the courts was eat in also in the
[34:48] holiest of holies.
[34:51] But this manner out here give out
[34:54] quickly.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; You met people like that would eat out
[34:58] there and say, "Well, brother Brandham,
[35:00] I had the same thing. I did this and I
[35:02] did that just like they did." But I meet
[35:05] that woman, she's always on the
[35:07] housetop. There's never a worry in our
[35:09] mind. I meet that man wherever he is,
[35:11] he's got a big smile on his face and
[35:12] saying, "Praise the Lord. How you
[35:14] feeling? Wonderful." And every time he
[35:16] gets sick, the preacher comes, prays for
[35:17] him. Brother, he's out and gone. The
[35:20] next day
[35:22] is just wonderful. I just can't my
[35:25] blessing somehow.
[35:27] I can't all my blessing somehow.
[35:30] It's the place you're abiding at. It's
[35:33] where you at. I want you to get this
[35:36] close. Remember that many times on the
[35:39] campground there's blessings run out.
[35:41] You're eating the mana, the correct
[35:43] manner. You see the correct manner. You
[35:47] could be having drawing from the word,
[35:49] the message of Yahweh. Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; But you haven't consecrated your life
[35:53] yet.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; And went into a place like Aaron behind
[35:57] the holiest of holies.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Where he was in there, nothing. He
[36:03] didn't hear the world no more.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; He was shut in with God.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Shut in with God. Amen.
[36:12] And what men and women need today after
[36:15] you've been brought into the kingdom of
[36:18] God is a hidden life.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Men and women who will get with Christ
[36:24] and the curtains drop around. You don't
[36:27] care what the world says. You don't care
[36:30] what people says. You're living in there
[36:32] with Christ where the mana you eating
[36:35] from the golden pot of mana every day
[36:38] day and night all the time living on the
[36:42] mountain and indeed the cloud cloud
[36:44] cloudless sky when Aaron walked in there
[36:48] the curtain fell behind him he was all
[36:51] surrounded in a place to himself with
[36:53] God alone
[36:56] &gt;&gt; amen that's the place that every born
[36:59] again man and woman ought to be abiding
[37:02] today.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; In the presence of God.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; With the rest of the world shut off from
[37:09] around them. Hallelujah.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the church need today
[37:16] is a hidden consecrated life.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; You can be dabbling along with the world
[37:23] and impersonating and acting like them
[37:26] and hid with Christ.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. cuz you're trying to
[37:29] fashion after the world.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; We cannot be caught up in this influence
[37:34] of this age.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; We got to be caught up in the influence
[37:38] of the world.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're trying to live like the
[37:42] next church. You're trying to belong to
[37:45] a better organization, wear better
[37:47] clothes, do so and so. That's not comply
[37:50] with Christianity. Christianity is a
[37:53] sacrificed life.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. in life with God through
[37:58] Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Therefore, when that widow woman would
[38:05] do would would go and make that bake
[38:08] that cake for Elijah, it was a
[38:10] sacrifice.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Because when she was baking that cake,
[38:14] she knew that her substance is going to
[38:16] run out.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; But she was holding on to the prophecy.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; She was holding on to the promise. Amen.
[38:22] because she identified that God was
[38:25] speaking to her directly.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; He was veiled in his prophet
[38:29] &gt;&gt; speaking to her directly. Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; And God could be veiled tonight speaking
[38:34] to you directly.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That he requires a sacrificed
[38:37] life. He required a consecrated life
[38:40] from you. Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz he wants to use you. And there's a
[38:44] promise. There's a prophecy. What is the
[38:45] prophecy? You will be a super church, a
[38:48] super race, an invincible army. You will
[38:50] do the greater works.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; But before that come to pass, there's a
[38:55] sacrifice.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to have the hidden life,
[38:58] the consecrated life. Amen.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Where you are willing to die to self.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Because
[39:07] when that woman did that and the two
[39:09] sticks and lit up the fire baked the
[39:11] cake, then what happened? That was one
[39:14] part of it. Fair enough. She had the
[39:17] substance increased in a household.
[39:20] But death came upon a child
[39:22] &gt;&gt; upon a son
[39:24] &gt;&gt; and now she had all that but she didn't
[39:27] have the spirit yet. Amen.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Because why the life of God must come.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; And what was it? Where was it laying?
[39:34] &gt;&gt; The image. Where was God?
[39:37] Who was going to who was stretching for
[39:40] himself towards the the child? He was
[39:42] the prophet of God. But who was veiled
[39:43] in the prophets?
[39:45] &gt;&gt; It was God. So who brings who is what
[39:48] did Jesus said? I am the resurrection
[39:49] and the life.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; So if somebody is raised from the dead
[39:52] who's bringing them to life.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; It is Christ working through his
[39:56] prophet. Amen.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; God veiled through his prophet bringing
[39:59] that son to life.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bringing it to what now? Now it is
[40:04] spirit there. Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Because he brought him back. Amen.
[40:07] Brought his soul back into that body to
[40:09] come into that image. What is that? Come
[40:12] into the image of the son of man.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the hour. We've come to
[40:17] that. We have to got to come and
[40:18] sacrifice because it's coming to the
[40:20] time where we must come into the image
[40:22] of son of man.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes the hidden life. It
[40:27] takes a sacrifice.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; That's so he says that's what the real
[40:32] Christian life consists of. Not of how
[40:35] well you can do this.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I might not be able to pronounce
[40:39] the word accurately. I might not be able
[40:41] to have the best grammar. I might not be
[40:43] able to to speak the way the certain
[40:47] speak speakers can speak. But it's not
[40:50] about that. Amen. That's not what the
[40:52] rest the Christian life consists of. Or
[40:55] how well you can sing or how well you
[40:57] can preach, that's fine. But that isn't
[40:59] it. It's a hidden life.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. consecrated the veil curtains
[41:04] dropped around you and you dead and
[41:08] buried and you hid in God to Christ and
[41:10] seal in there by the Holy Ghost.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; I must die to self.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You must die in self. So it not be
[41:17] I that liveth but Christ that liveth in
[41:19] me.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It must come to that stage where
[41:23] the world don't see you but they see
[41:25] Christ in you.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Christ in you. The hope of glory. Amen.
[41:30] Devil can't get to you.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; He can't do it.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; He has to come to the same process you
[41:35] did.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; If he did that, he'd be your brother.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; So he can get to you. Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; So stop saying the devil is stoping me.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Rather get to the right process.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Come to the right process. Come to
[41:50] repentance.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Come to the consecrated life. Amen. And
[41:54] get Christ in you. Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Get he the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Because you are promised the gift of the
[42:01] Holy Ghost.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Follow the remedy and you got the gift
[42:06] of the Holy Ghost which is promise to
[42:07] you.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Then the devil, you can't be saying the
[42:09] devil is troubling me after that.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I eat the good things of God. Yay.
[42:15] But you're in the courts out yonder.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you don't hold on.
[42:21] That's the reason this year you're doing
[42:22] pretty good and next year you're back in
[42:24] the world.
[42:27] this revival, you're doing fine while
[42:29] the revival's on. When the revival is
[42:32] gone, then you're gone somewhere else
[42:33] and out with the world. Now, I want to
[42:36] tell you something. You don't judge
[42:38] God's spiritual blessing by material
[42:42] gain
[42:43] &gt;&gt; or by the things of this or the way the
[42:45] world judge standards
[42:47] &gt;&gt; because if you do that then Elon Musk is
[42:48] your brother.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; You don't judge God's blessings by that.
[42:53] These are things God will give you
[42:54] things that you need. But you don't
[42:56] judge a person of how rich they are or
[42:58] how wealthy they are.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; You you judge them that no matter what
[43:02] they go through, you can see Christ
[43:04] projected through them.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; They will praise God in the valleys,
[43:07] they will praise God in the mountains.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. They have a consistent Christian
[43:12] life.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; They won't be grumbling and mourning and
[43:15] blaming God. No, they'll be rejoicing.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; They'll be rejoicing in their troubles.
[43:20] They'll be rejoicing in their problems.
[43:22] They'll be saying, "Blessed be the name
[43:23] of the Lord. The Lord giveth. The Lord
[43:25] take it. Blessed be the name of the
[43:27] Lord.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; My redeemer liveth." Amen.
[43:32] So you don't judge things the way the
[43:34] world judge it.
[43:40] So he says
[43:42] this the reason this year you're doing
[43:44] pretty good and next year you're back in
[43:45] the world and this revival you're doing
[43:47] fine while the revival's on. When the
[43:49] revival is gone, then you're gone
[43:51] somewhere else and out with the world.
[43:53] You say, "Oh, I received the Holy Ghost.
[43:55] I spoke with tongues. I shouted." That's
[43:57] all right. I have nothing to say about
[43:59] that. But why don't it hold out? That's
[44:02] it. That's what the world's looking at.
[44:05] That's what the people are saying. If
[44:07] you're professing this great eye
[44:08] calling, then why ain't you living like
[44:11] that?
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; You know, the best thing is to live a
[44:15] sermon instead of preach one.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You know that you
[44:21] written epistles.
[44:23] [Music]
[44:24] What that means? You written epistles.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; You have to live it out.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to live out the
[44:30] scriptures for your day.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; You can do it in yourself. You can
[44:35] impersonate it for a little while, but
[44:38] your sins will find you out.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; You better consecrate. You better just
[44:43] consecrate yourself to God and get on
[44:46] the inside. Shut the doors behind you
[44:49] and burn every barrier there is behind
[44:52] you and every bridge and launch out.
[44:54] Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; I know it's the truth. I know it'll
[44:58] work. If it hadn't been for that,
[45:01] I don't know what would have become of
[45:03] me. That's right. But it ain't the
[45:05] people that you look at then. It's
[45:07] Christ. Notice in the same place there,
[45:10] they brought Aaron's rod
[45:13] &gt;&gt; and they laid it in there one night.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. and think the same rod. What did
[45:18] it do? It budded. It blossomed and
[45:22] yielded almonds the same night. What was
[45:25] it? It must have been an almond tree.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; That's where it originated from. Amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Staff there on the road must have come
[45:32] off an almond tree.
[45:35] So if we are we are part of Christ.
[45:39] Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; We coming from the Christ tree. Amen.
[45:42] And we coming from him and we part of
[45:44] him and we shut him in him. Amen. In the
[45:47] inner court in the most holy of holies
[45:50] under the shina glory then what
[45:52] happened? You must but for
[45:54] &gt;&gt; you must bring forth Christ.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; You must bring forth the fruits of
[45:58] Christ. Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; You must bear forth the fruits
[46:02] &gt;&gt; because the tree you are you are from
[46:04] the Christ tree. Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; He said I am the vine. You are the
[46:08] branches. If you abide in me and I abide
[46:11] in you, ask what you will.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; So if you're abiding in a vine, then you
[46:14] must bring forth the fruits.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; So this is the hour to become fruitful
[46:21] and multiply.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; To bear forth the fruit of Christ.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; This is the hour not to be starchy, not
[46:27] to be gloomy. Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; But there must be the power of the
[46:31] resurrection must be displayed.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Christ must be on display. It's the end
[46:36] sign. Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; So how is this is the hour where all
[46:45] that the prophet has spoken about people
[46:47] have criticized him. People have there's
[46:49] many critics on the word but now you are
[46:51] on display.
[46:53] You are the people that the word are
[46:55] speaking about. If you are on display
[46:56] what are they going to speak about now?
[46:58] The devil's got nothing to speak about.
[47:00] Amen.
[47:01] [Music]
[47:02] So he says in the message, why is it
[47:05] that so many Christians find it so hard
[47:07] to live the Christian life? He says, you
[47:10] get a new spirit, you quit drinking, you
[47:12] get a new spirit, you quit lying, you
[47:15] get a new spirit, you can do most
[47:18] anything with that spirit. But that
[47:19] isn't what God was talking about.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; A new spirit. He said, I'll give you a
[47:25] new art and a new spirit. Why? He'd have
[47:30] to give you a new spirit to live for
[47:32] him. Why? You couldn't even live with
[47:35] yourself with the spirit you you did
[47:38] have. You couldn't live with your
[47:39] neighbor. You couldn't associate with
[47:41] the next man or the next corner. You
[47:42] couldn't associate with this Christian.
[47:44] Why? You'd have an awful spirit. So, he
[47:47] has to give you a new spirit. I give you
[47:50] a new heart, a new spirit. Now, watch.
[47:52] And I will put my spirit in you. That's
[47:54] the difference. I'll put my spirit in
[47:56] you. So, it's nothing to do with you.
[47:58] You come the right way and he's going to
[48:00] give you the new spirit. Amen.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; It's not your works.
[48:04] You can't put in your mind and say I
[48:06] will be a good person. You can't come
[48:08] out and say today I will decide that I'm
[48:10] going to change my life. I'm going to be
[48:12] a good person. No, you got to come to
[48:14] repentance. He's given you the remedy.
[48:17] Repent every one of you.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be baptized in the name of the
[48:20] Lord Jesus Christ and he shall give you
[48:22] the gift of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[48:28] He says,
[48:32] "Notice now, I'll give you a new spirit
[48:34] and I'll put my spirit." Notice the new
[48:36] heart is put right in the middle of you
[48:38] and the new spirit is put right in the
[48:40] middle of your new heart. And his spirit
[48:43] is put right in the middle of the new
[48:45] spirit. He just like the main spring in
[48:48] a famous watch. When that main spring
[48:51] set in the middle of the watch, it
[48:53] controls every movement of that watch.
[48:57] And that's what the matter friends. Now,
[48:59] I hope you see this. And I'm not saying
[49:01] it try to twist or to be indifferent.
[49:04] I'm only I'm only saying it because I
[49:07] know that someday I'll stand in the
[49:08] judgment with you. You see, if the Holy
[49:11] Spirit is in the middle of your spirit
[49:14] and that watch spring makes all the rest
[49:17] of the movement just tick just exactly
[49:19] to the place keeping perfect time. When
[49:22] the Holy Spirit is in the middle of your
[49:24] spirit, it makes every action of the
[49:27] Holy Spirit in you tick off just exactly
[49:31] according to God's time piece, the
[49:34] Bible, right?
[49:40] One more quote. He says, "When a man
[49:43] confesses his sins and get right with
[49:45] God and God drops the sin of this
[49:49] confession into the blood of his own
[49:51] blood and forgives that sin and replaces
[49:54] in that man the original spirit that
[49:58] should be there, his own spirit."
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Making him a son of God.
[50:05] You see what makes you a son of God now?
[50:07] When his spirit comes in you,
[50:10] I'm talking about adoption. Now, this is
[50:12] talking about adoption. Amen. How much
[50:15] more ought the creative power of God to
[50:19] be in the church.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; It breaks down every wall of sin. It
[50:25] breaks down. People today try to say
[50:29] those words was back for another another
[50:32] age. It is. If you're still out from
[50:35] under that blood, but if you're under
[50:37] that blood, the power of God, by his
[50:39] word remains the same, it's got to be
[50:42] the same. If he could do that by the
[50:44] blood of sheep and animals, what about
[50:46] the blood of Jesus Christ?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; How could he do it? Amen. So, he puts
[50:50] his original spirit in you. Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; And when he puts his spirit in you and
[50:58] then you now doing the will of the
[51:00] father. Amen. When you're about the
[51:02] father's business and you are growing
[51:04] into maturity and the Holy Spirit being
[51:06] your tutor, then he says, "Well done.
[51:10] This this son of daughter of God is now
[51:13] passed the tests." Then he says, "This
[51:16] is my beloved son. Yim, this is my
[51:19] beloved daughter. Y Amen. This is my
[51:23] beloved bride." Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; She becomes now the final voice because
[51:28] why? You have come now to maturity. You
[51:32] have come to adoption. Amen. Because his
[51:34] spirit dwelling in you. His spirit
[51:37] making you act like him. Talk like him.
[51:40] Amen. Do the very works because he did
[51:43] part of his works that was pertaining to
[51:45] him 2,000 years ago. And the rest part
[51:47] of it, the remainder of the word had to
[51:49] be you.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; You had to complete that part of the
[51:52] word. It just like Queen Esther. The
[51:55] king did his part. He wrote his decree.
[51:57] The rest of the thing had to come from
[51:58] Queen Esther.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Now the king knew
[52:07] that if Esther had to die there,
[52:11] part of him is dead because she went to
[52:13] him
[52:14] &gt;&gt; and his seed would be laying in her. If
[52:18] Esther died, part of him is gone.
[52:21] But that part only Esther could do. Now
[52:24] &gt;&gt; he did his part. He said, "I give it off
[52:26] to the kingdom.
[52:27] Now it was her now to go rewrite the
[52:29] laws because the power was ling. He gave
[52:32] her the power. He equipped her. She had
[52:34] all the potential. She had the power.
[52:36] She had to go now and exercise the
[52:39] authority that was laying within her.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Because she took the king's name.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; She has she everything that the king had
[52:45] she could exercise the authority. Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. when she come to out of amnesia
[52:51] and recognize a true position and when
[52:53] she recognized a position she knew now
[52:56] what her potentials are. Amen. All the
[52:59] potential was laying within her. A
[53:01] position brings her into power.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; When she moves into position, it brings
[53:06] her into power. Amen.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; And the part that the king couldn't do
[53:10] because God wouldn't God only works with
[53:13] man.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; And there's things that God can just
[53:16] come and speak, it will happen. But he
[53:18] ordained it in such a way that we'll
[53:20] fulfill the remaining parts.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He did his part when he came here
[53:24] 2,000 years ago. He done the work of
[53:26] grace for us. But our part is now to go
[53:29] and do the greater works
[53:31] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the rest of the prophecy.
[53:32] Amen.
[53:34] That's why he says thou shall prophesy
[53:37] again before nation, tongues, and kings.
[53:39] That part is left for us. There was a
[53:42] part the prophet had to do. There was a
[53:44] part we have to do. Amen.
[53:47] But he said, "I will not leave you
[53:48] comfortless."
[53:50] &gt;&gt; You are doing it with him dwelling in
[53:53] you. Because why? He's prepared you so
[53:56] that his holy ghost is navigating your
[53:58] life. It's the Holy Ghost that lived in
[54:00] you.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; It is him that is making you do the
[54:03] things that you do. It's not you that
[54:05] doeth the works. It is Christ that
[54:07] liveth in you that doeth the works.
[54:09] Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; So it is Christ in you, the hope of
[54:12] glory.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just give you a final scripture.

[54:52] purpose of this message. Amen. That

[54:57] &gt;&gt; That was the message that come when you
[54:59] receive this word to that Christ be
[55:01] formed in you.
[55:04] That the world must see Christ again.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; In a many membered body.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Not a oneman ministry.
[55:11] but a many membered body.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Our whole purpose
[55:16] &gt;&gt; on the surface. Our whole purpose in
[55:18] this life is for Christ to be formed in
[55:21] us.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Growing from glory unto glory. Different
[55:25] stages of our journey. Amen. We know it.
[55:28] The word started in infancy but it must
[55:30] come to maturity. Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Till all we see is the full where we
[55:35] come into the full stature of the
[55:37] fullness of Christ.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand? God bless you.

[58:36] today
[58:39] take away my stony art, Lord."
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; And give me out of flesh.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord," or maybe one of those
[58:46] that say, "Lord, I have a new spirit,
[58:49] but Lord, I want your spirit now. I want
[58:53] the Holy Ghost to come and dwell in me."
[58:57] You know the Lord wants to give you the
[58:58] Holy Ghost even more than you want it
[59:02] because he knows that when he gives you

[59:47] &gt;&gt; dear friends, this is a very late hour
[59:49] now.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; This is not the time where we come just
[59:52] to have a normal service. This is the

[59:56] right with God.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; And to make sure that we want to be in

[1:00:14] of the country or of certain president

[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Without faith, it's impossible to please
[1:00:40] God.

[1:00:45] name of Jesus Christ. Yes. Yes.

[1:02:16] the gap for their loved ones, oh God.
[1:02:18] And maybe that they feel their loved one
[1:02:20] is far too gone. But nothing is
[1:02:22] impossible with you, Father.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Tonight, they can pull them in by faith.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Faith is a substance. Oh God, as they
[1:02:29] can pull them in by faith, oh God, and
[1:02:32] believe, oh God, with all their heart,
[1:02:34] with all their soul, believe your word
[1:02:36] and take you by your word, then we know
[1:02:38] that you are more than able, oh God.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, God. Oh Lord to give them their

[1:03:09] power. They'll be loose from every
[1:03:11] attack of the enemy in the name of Jesus
[1:03:13] Christ. And they'll be able to ro
[1:03:15] receive your word tonight as your word
[1:03:17] has been sown, Lord. May they receive it
[1:03:20] and may be sown on good ground tonight.

[1:03:25] Christ. And those that want to receive
[1:03:27] your Holy Ghost, Lord, pour out your

[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; But like we keep telling the church, the
[1:05:41] holy spirit is not meant to float around
[1:05:44] like a ghost.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; In the air. The Holy Spirit is meant to
[1:05:48] tabernacle sons and daughters.
[1:05:52] So if I had to ask you, it's father,
[1:05:55] son.
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. So that's the mystery that was
[1:06:01] revealed to us.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; By the seventh angel.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost is tabernacling, his
[1:06:06] church now in the end time, it's father,
[1:06:08] son, and his holy ghost church.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we become part of the mystery
[1:06:15] of God.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So which means we can't do without
[1:06:20] one another. That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; God's earthly strength is his bride.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. His power rest in her. Amen. We
[1:06:28] thank brother Joshua for sharing the
[1:06:30] word of the Lord, bringing the word of
[1:06:31] the Lord so faithfully. Amen.
[1:06:33] Crystallizing some points. Amen. But I
[1:06:35] also wanted to say, Amen. We have a very
[1:06:37] special guest here of Pastor Denzel's
[1:06:40] mom is here with us tonight. Let's give
[1:06:42] her a hand and welcome in the beginning.
[1:06:46] Amen. I know she you stay out here in
[1:06:49] Ver. Amen. who stays out here in Vera.
[1:06:52] So, Pastor Denzel was telling me about
[1:06:54] his mom and he has a desire for her to
[1:06:57] come and worship the Lord here with us.
[1:06:59] So, we pray, amen, that you would have
[1:07:00] heard something tonight that would have
[1:07:02] touched you and blessed your soul. Amen.
[1:07:04] And I pray that the Lord will rich and
[1:07:06] bless you.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's just uh pray even as we
[1:07:09] dismiss. Amen. Glory.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe the Lord has spoken to
[1:07:14] our hearts. Yes. Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; And you know, don't think that the
[1:07:18] message was maybe for somebody else.
[1:07:20] Let's personalize it and say, "Lord,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; there was some portion in there for me,
[1:07:24] oh God."
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe the old portion was for you, but
[1:07:27] there was something spoken that you can
[1:07:29] apply to your own life.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't live life aimless in this.
[1:07:34] Amen. In this time and season, dedicate
[1:07:37] your life to the Lord, young people.
[1:07:39] Say, "Lord, I want to I want to have
[1:07:41] this personal relationship with you,
[1:07:43] Lord. I want to know you, Father.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God will reveal himself to
[1:07:48] you. The Bible says if we draw nigh to
[1:07:50] him, he will draw near to us.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The best investment
[1:07:55] you can make is to surrender your life
[1:07:57] to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Invite him into your heart and say,
[1:08:01] "Lord, I want to make you the Lord of my
[1:08:03] life." Amen.
[1:08:06] Hallelujah. Amen. So, we're going to ask
[1:08:08] for brother Kenny to close in prayer.
[1:08:10] Amen.
[1:08:13] Heavenly Father.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
