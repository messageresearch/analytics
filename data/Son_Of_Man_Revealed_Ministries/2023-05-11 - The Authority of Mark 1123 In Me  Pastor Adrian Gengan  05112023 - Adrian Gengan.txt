up of Praise amen you can be seated for a moment greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we're living in a time in a season it's an exciting time in season amen amen how many of you are glad to be alive in this time amen the prophet says you know if you could have chosen any age to live he wouldn't have traded it for any other age the most glorious time when the fullness of the word is going to be is revealed and it's going to be revealed in a people amen amen a people who know their God like Daniel said will do great exploits you know what the age was the Revelation and the Mystery of God revealed like in this age so people who know their God will do great exploits that's what the Bible says amen hallelujah so I invite you this morning to get your

praise the Lord amen amen just an announcement for next week amen sister Ruth Brother Sam they having a Thanksgiving service next week Sunday on the 12th amen so they'll be providing the meals after the service amen just so that you're aware of that you can give your wife a break you don't have to wake up at 4:00 in the morning and cook for you on Sunday amen praise the Lord I like a church who

if the pastor coughs they say amen amen that's we are to be you're expecting something amen amen hallelujah amen so I tell you if something is hindering you this morning just Shake Yourself Loos amen hallelujah this is not the time and season for you to play church for you to think you're coming to a church service and things are happening normal amen this is the time for you to get involved yes amen how many if you know the Holy Ghost is not floating around on the earth like a spirit he needs bodies yes amen the holy spirit is is only effective in a body God works through men he uses men yes amen hallelujah so you got to become the Tabernacle of the Holy Ghost amen full of his Praises Hallelujah so I don't know what you were doing last night maybe yesterday that got you bound maybe even this morning amen hallelujah but we come here to have church amen amen hallelujah we're come here to show the devil whose side we on we come here to serve a risen Jesus amen give him a good ank clap of Praise he's not dead but he's alive prise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen so amen we ask you to keep remembering the family of Brother Willie naid amen and uh yesterday was the funeral and they asked me to do the funeral amen so we were there ministering the word of the Lord just want to share this with you that the word of the Lord can come and penetrate even the hardest of Hearts yes people that you think will never be open to the gospel but when the word of God comes forth amen amen amen yesterday the word went forth and I think it was like busting concrete for the word to get sewn in there amen so apart from all the Believers that were there that complimented the sermon for me that didn't matter to me that the Believers were complimenting because they knew the message of the hour they know about the gospel but there was a Hindu girl St Hindu married to my NE to my cousin brother Joshua knows the family well that's uh because he led the father to the Lord there and these people are so staunch in the Gos in their faith that they wouldn't listen to anyone in all of the family functions they are the most religious ones having prayer and things so I was standing and talking to some of the sisters there after the service think s l and maybe Angelia I forget who was there my wife was standing there and she could have walked past me but she tapped me on my shoulder she called me and she says that was something right there the witnesses here they were standing right there there and I said well you got you think about it she says yeah you left me with loss to think about amen now what can do that except I as a man words can't do that to people it's got to take the Holy Ghost then we were going in the car park and another old man his name is George he gets off the car because he was looking for me he's also a Hindu he gets off the car just to come shake my hand and tell me Well Done I really enjoyed what you were saying what would make unbelievers do that yes it's the power of the Gospel amen amen they must see a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ so I also ask you to remember them in prayer because when the word is sown Satan will come to try and pluck the word out of their hearts now we never know that these things could be playing in the head and they could soften up amen and God can do something so every opportunity we get we ought to be presenting the gospel amen you know yesterday I was challenged there because I knew that there was going to be mostly Believers so I could have preached a message sermon where the Believers would have been rejoicing amen but the Holy Spirit allowed it in the way to present Christ to the people Amen to show them the resurrected Lord Jesus and the benefits of serving the lord Jesus amen so sister Rosemary was a wonderful sister amen served the Lord faithfully and uh the Lord saw it fit to take her home at this time amen you know sometimes we may be sick we may be unwell and you think but didn't we pray to the point of death didn't we have faith didn't we believe God why didn't God touch that person why didn't God heal that person you see all of us have an expiry date there's a birthday and if the Lord carries there's a death date and no amount of prayer can stop God I was reading a quote this morning and the prophet is saying that the sister came into the prayer line and the prophet says she came there for something it could have been a heart problem and the prophet says he prayed the prayer of faith and said go on your way believing you healed but he says as she was walking by he saw this black shadow following her so remember what he was doing confessing Mark 16 as she's going by he sees this black thing over her he calls her back and he tells the sister make yourself ready you're going to meet the Lord he says she goes back into the seat and she's like looking at her husband and saying what was that you know the man says I'm going to die and the prophet say she died right there there to come and take her away not that she was irreverent to anything it was a time to go amen so the Bible says to everything there's a season time to be born yes and a time to die I know nobody nobody da wants to go on the other side you want to hold on to life dear life with your last breath amen but a Believer knows what's waiting on the other side one of the thoughts I was sharing yesterday was about a seed that's planted in the ground when you plant a orange seed what are you expecting out of the ground you're not going to expect apples right so when a human is swn into the ground what must he raise up as amen a Son of God he must raise up but even better when you saw a seed into the ground how you reap a harvest of seeds and you eat seeds are you getting something better something juicy something more glorious than the seed so when a Believer is swn in faith in Christ he's coming back glorious amen he's coming back younger he's coming back wiser amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen let's stand for the reading of God's word amen this morning we'll speak on the authority of Mark 11:23 in me amen amen praise the Lord amen but before we get there on want to read the progression of scriptures I didn't realize that Mark was so packed with Dynamic quickening power most of the scriptures that deal with the church and our faith lies here in The Book of Mark amen praise the Lord Mark 9:23 says if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth amen amen if thou can believe all things are possible to him that believeth we'll go to our focal point in scripture Mark 11:23 which reads for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen if you don't know this is the season we are in now amen amen amen the time for murmuring and complaining is over amen you've got to open up your mouth and speak things that you want yes Lord amen God has put the authority in our mouth Yes amen so he says whosoever is that the priest is that the pastor the Deacon whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he say shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he sayth one more portion of of scripture before you be seated Mark 16 amen so in Mark 11 from verse1 14 we see that Jesus is left with 11 disciples amen so one was walking among them among them but he wasn't a True Believer amen he was always nagging the church telling them you shouldn't use the money for this you shouldn't be doing this you shouldn't be doing this amen the Bible says he had his hand in the purse but that's something with that number there cuz he had 11 disciples left amen afterward he appeared unto the 11 as he sat at meat and upgraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature before I go on there the spirit just wants me to focus on that verse there you see what Jesus did there you think in his parting message he'd be giving them a nice farewell sermon read that verse again afterward this is he Jesus appears unto the 11 and as he set at meat he uped them because of the unbelief and Hardness of Heart so Jesus and he starts calling them now a pastor's job is to rebuke Amen to bring correction yes that's not the job of the other four of the ministry the pro that's a a pastor's job because the pastor is The Shepherd of the flock so any other Ministry comes here it's not their job to rebuke to chastise the church and all of these things it is the pastor's job amen upgraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen now when after it is a rising of the Sun and after it is risen and we are telling you that Jesus Christ is reproduced in human flesh again and in you and I if you don't believe us there's a rebuke coming to you so yeah after Jesus rebukes them I wonder how the spirits must have been now Jesus tells them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature amen he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils so if you tell me that you believe these are some of the signs that will accompany you amen amen anyone can make a profession but Jesus is saying you are going the believer can be clearly identified in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen praise the Lord the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so the authority of Mark 11:23 in me now I'm saying in me I'm not personalizing it to me you need to personalize it to you amen the authority of God's word is in every one of us now we know that every word word of God that is written is the sworn Authority amen this is what the prophet is teaching us now the word of God is God sworn Authority amen it's the absolute for every believer amen it's the infallible truth amen yes amen and the Bible says that heavens and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away Hallelujah and the prophet tells us it must be fulfilled in its season amen amen amen you see Mark 11:23 comes about because of the fig tree that was cursed that the disciples were questioning Jesus regarding the Fig Tree now we know the Fig Tree types Israel amen can everybody agree agree with that the Fig Tree Jesus says he's typing Israel yes amen amen so this was also when Jesus was cursing the tree it was also a figure of what he was doing because here he comes in the beginning of Mark 11 he comes riding he comes into Jerusalem riding on a CT and what scripture was he fulfilling he was fulfilling a prophecy in the Bible that says behold your king comes riding am yes Amen on a CT amen so he was fulfilling scripture but a king if they are declaring Behold a king is coming a king has Authority when a king speaks amen his subjects must obey but this wasn't just any ordinary King oh yes Lord because you can see the king speaking to his disciples and telling them go and you'll find the the cold tide but you speak to those men and they will give you the cat tell them loose the cat for the master they must a natural person wouldn't recognize Jesus to be their Master but y as a king in Authority tell them the master has need of it amen then he's coming now and he sees Israel a far off and she's got leaves she's performing religious ceremon she's performing the duties the high priest is in the temple sacrifice is being presented but yeah God Almighty is on Earth yes amen he sees from a far off she's very religious so he goes to the vict Tre to see if there be any fruit in there oh yes amen help us Lord yes yes help us so when Jesus comes to Israel and he's presenting the word they are telling them we are our Father Abraham but Jesus The Living Word who Abraham spoke about is standing in the midst of them and he tells them before Abraham was I am amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so Jesus cursing the Fig Tree is a figure of speech where Jesus sorry it's not just a figure he literally cursed a victory and it withered away but it is a shadow of him cursing Israel that their eyes will be closed amen amen amen and then when the vi Tre is withered away he comes now to the disciples and he says now the authority is being given to you if you say to the mountain I'm done working with the Fig Tree in fact this fig tree can be found all the way in Genesis Adam ran to it when they fell trying to find the covering so God hates Victory religion man-made religion you find it again in Mark 11 Jesus speaking to the Fig Tree and now there's something about that tree it didn't recognize its creator let me tell you why they put a dead rod in the ark where the same presence of the Lord lay and that dead Rod dried Rod bed in that presence amen this tree was so hard in Earth I'm telling you it's typing Israel in the presence of the same Shak of Glory that tree was supposed to produce fruit but it refused to produce fruit that's why the Bible says Jesus answered the Fig Tree it's a figure it's a type of Israel yes it's a type of Israel who rejected the Messiah in the presence of the Messiah they couldn't burst forth into life but you know that God also says that he blinded them for a season that we the Gentiles could come in am amen so the word of God is our sworn Authority amen and and the prophet tells us that every promise in the book belongs to the believer amen hallelujah when God speaks that becomes a law amen and the Holy Spirit is here to enforce the law amen for the believer amen you have been ordained to do it and it takes the believer how many of you have ever heard the Holy Ghost speak am amen how many of you have heard the Holy Ghost speak amen amen if you were not here Wednesday brother Joshua laid it out beautifully how the Holy Ghost speaks and now you've got to submit to the authority of the Holy Ghost you see I told you the Holy Ghost is not wandering around like a Wandering Spirit the Holy Ghost is working through men amen yes the fivefold ministry is God's dressed way for for the church you telling me are you trying to tell me Pastor that as you speaking now the Holy Ghost is speaking to you yes but the holy spirit is yet to enforce that law you have been ordained to do so and it takes a Believer you've got to have the badge of a Believer we got Authority any law enforcement officer will have a badge but don't be a counterfeit you know you get fake officers coming to your house telling you that they a police officer they can present a badge amen the prophet tells us that the greatest curse on the church today is the church not knowing who they are amen and the prophet is telling us that the word of God will place a believer in his position and show us the authority we have in Christ amen amen then he says here then everybody out there will be praying for the sick let's go back let's follow what he's saying with the help of God this afternoon the holy scriptures he will help us let's try to place the believer positionally in Christ and show what his authority is in Christ for me to just sit in the church and rejoice no then he says then everybody out there am will be praying for the sick amen yes amen thank you amen the believer is so full of the Holy Ghost and faith and the fire of God inside of him holding to the word of Truth amen hallelujah he says that the believer of today don't have to look back at an age gone by he says not one believer of any age need to cry in his heart oh that I might have been back there in in the first age when the apostles were sent forth maybe some of us feel that way oh I wish I was in the meetings of William brandom how I wish I could have seen the move of God I present to you the truth that the same angel of God that worked in William Bram is here today amen yes amen amen you were not born for that time and season because God called you for a greater time and season the season of The Rapture the season of perfect Faith amen yes yes amen there's no need for you to look back 50 years ago 60 years ago he says there's no need to look back where you need to look look up Hallelujah yes amen amen Behold Him who is now even walking walking in the midst of the church through all ages Behold Him who is the same yesterday today and forever amen yes amen praise the Lord never changes either in essence or his ways where two or three are gathered in his name he's there in the midst not only in the midst as a complacent onlooker oh yeah I want to keep the Holy Spirit confined contained I want to discipline the the Holy Ghost he mustn't come misbehaving me who the Holy Ghost think he is he's trying to raise my hand hey the Holy Ghost is trying to change my taste trying to change my desires you know the way I love my Netflix now the Holy Ghost I don't even feel like watching that thing anymore in fact when I watch that thing and my spirit gets grieved I put the that thing off in fact I cancel my subscription some of you cancel it in the name of the Lord Jesus now amen if you don't have enough strength tell your spouse or your husband or somebody to cancel it for you he doesn't want to be a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel he's there expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and The Giver of all good gifts to the church amen amen amen I need you to start praying amen I need you to start praying Lord use me oh God Port your gifts in me Lord Port yourself in me Lord Express Yourself In Me Lord whatever gift is laying Within Me Lord let it germinate your life whatever expression of seed is within me Let It Come to Life yes Lord amen so we know that the opening of the word was to place the believer positionally in the word so that we recognize our place as Sons and Daughters of God and once we know our place our position we can operate in the authority of the word and the Greater Works can be found in us can you say amen amen amen amen praise the Lord yeah the prophet is telling us that Christ in the true church are we the true church yes is a continuation of the book of Acts amen he says if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army amen amen hallelujah so you need a revelation that you are called in this hour to do the Greater Works tell your brother and your sister I have the Revelation I have the re that I can do I can do the Greater Works Works amen yes amen amen hallelujah you don't have to use one another's armor David couldn't use Soul's armor you are called into the Invincible Army and God will Empower you and equip with equip you with what you need if all you need is a sling and five stones and praise the Lord you go out with that amen if you need a sharp sword then you go out with that whatever the Lord has placed in your hand amen you go out with that amen yes Lord thank you Lord you say but all I have is my little humble testimony go out with that amen that is the most powerful weapon you have it's the word of your testimony you know when the people got over on the other side they asked them how did you overcome they said by the blood of the Lamb which they had nothing to do about he did it for them but what was the one portion they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony amen amen that was their part yes thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord hallelujah they know it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so that now he works in and through the bride amen hallelujah yes I thought he was only going to work through the prophet I tell you and I present to you the truth that the prophet was a forerunner of the most powerful Army that was going to rise up on the face of the yeah yes Lord yes John the Baptist was a forerunner of the Living Word who did William Brandon forun amen what is the second form mystery purpose for Christ to be fully expressed in a people amen what did John say the one that's coming is greater than I that may be too much for your theology but the one that's being expressed now through the many membered body amen hallelujah amen amen amen true true true true amen I know the meat is tough but true Hallelujah true you just expressed that I can do the Greater Works what did the first four rers say the one that's coming is greater than I oh yes he says I want you now listen to this right okay let's finish this quote he

time I want somebody to raise up and say that's me there that's me I see myself in that quote I am raised up for this specific time for such a time and season I'm here to defeat Satan amen amen do you

amen know how to express it amen know who is doing it yes Hallelujah know how he works amen didn't we read all those quotes the angel of God comes about because maybe there were evil forces coming the

a Warfare going on Amen but you begin to say Amen Lord tell the devil who side you on because right now he's trying to influence you in your mind thank you you may believe in your heart but he's

Medical Aid no problem we offer you a product called Miracle Aid no problem he free to no monthly subscriptions amen amen underwritten by the Holy Ghost not underwritten by all of these other Fly by Night companies this one is tried and tested amen performed the first surgery day in Eden yes yes from the side of Adam came forth a rib and he formed Eve closed it up Adam didn't have a scar how many of you want operations like that amen then you shall have it you see I also want you to connect with certain quotes because you got to make it live when brother brandham says there'll come a time when a brother will have a need and he'll tell you brother my crops are burning out there I have need of rain who is he talking to he's he praying on his knees and talking to the Lord is that the quote amen he says the brother will come to you and you will tell the brother amen I give it to you you see many times Brothers maybe they don't even know what they're doing Sometimes They Come tell you hey I need this in here and you tell him yeah Lord help you you know I now you going to do it hey brother I'm in such a fixed age that's terrible how you put yourself in that fix but there's a opportunity presented to you say brother and take them by surprise you know Holy Ghost people are fanatical people yes they don't care where they are they tell you there's something wrong with them stop them mid speech while they're speaking you know why El was speaking Rebecca came while they speaking and complaining lay your hands on them and start praying for them [Music] am amen ah but we need some radical Christians we need you know you'll do that when you're convinced about what you believe tell them quickening power is within me just hold your mouth here man please stop confessing negative things just bow your head and pray amen Mark 16 says if I lay hands upon the sick they shall recover I'm tired of your complaining I'm tired of your whining am amen amen amen don't always wait for a church setting for the after for the religious part of the service where we call the alter call and then you want to come and be laid down this is not a Catholic Church hallelujah amen quickening power ought to be in you amen you to have the confidence of poor that even if you preach all night you better not preach all night if you don't have quickening power eh because yeah the boy fell down dead but he had enough quickening power to raise the boy back up amen so he says in the next 5 minutes there won't be a feeble person here he says the thing of it you're looking into a millennium for something to happen when it's already here amen amen now we are the sons of God yes yes what's the use of you being able to speak when you're in a new body when that body won't be sick that body don't need anything who you want to speak for everything will be provided for you yes now amen now are we the sons of God Amen not we will be we are right now when this night this morning right now this minute we seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh if you'd only recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus has given to every believer you see supreme authority the authority of Mark 11:23 is in you and me anything you have desire of need of only thing you have to ask and receive it whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it it' be given unto you amen whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it now he says I can show you in the Bible where God gave his church The Authority by using the name by faith to cast out evil spirits and heal the sick and do great signs of Wonders I can show you where it was given to the church but there's no record in the Bible nowhere where he ever took that power away from the church but this Gospel of the same Deliverance was to be preached to All Nations beginning at Jerusalem and we was to be Witnesses of him in Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the uttermost parts of the Earth this gospel the signs was to follow the believer until he comes again go into all the World Mark 16 you know in anything of this life we've got to we've got got to submit to the authority of it whether it's a law on the earth we've got to submit to the authority of the law if electricity has certain laws you've got to submit to that Authority if you work against the laws of electricity you can kill yourself anything in life amen how many of you know even at work when you go there there's levels of authority you can't just Storm Into the director's office and start telling nonsense amen yes didn't the Centurion tell Jesus about Authority and he says I am command over this 100 men and I tell them do this do this do this and they go and do it we've got to submit to Authority in any matter am we cannot resist the authority otherwise it will not work for us amen amen you know that a police officer when is trained he's got the authority of the state behind him but he can't just go around without his [Music] uniform sometimes they go around plain clothes but what they've got to produce identification so he's got to produce identification the same policeman if he's a traffic officer he can stand on the N2 or N3 and that car can be going 150 M hour could be an 18wheeler Truck moving at high speed if he steps out on that road and he raises his hand and flags them down they better stop that's Authority he doesn't stop the truck by his power he stops it by his authority amen you know same way a fire firefighter works with the laws of fire because in water is oxygen as well and if you sprinkle water the wrong way the fire can actually increase you're feeding the fire so fire fighters also work with the law he knows how to put a fire he studied fire he knows the properties of fire and he knows amen he does not fight against the laws of fire and I'm afraid we've got too many spiritual firefighters I don't think you know what I'm telling you the Holy Ghost and Fire is here but we got too many firefighters that wants to put out the fire of God wants to put out the move of God Amen Hallelujah don't be quiet if if you if you are quiet and think you're one of the firefighters right now amen hallelujah but I say way to spiritual firefighters I say we put spiritual firefighters out of jobs amen I say we defund the spiritual firefighters amen yes Lord amen

saying the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God talking about these denominational churches so God has turned on her he will confounded through the prophet and the bride oh did he confound it through the prophet yes yes and the bride for the voice of God will be in who in her the what she'll have her own voice who is this woman who speaks like God Amen the voice of God will be H her yes it

chapter 2 you mean I must leave gri yes amen hallelujah I can bring badja you can bring the Bader and come share with us on the road you see no use we preaching these things and we're not doing it practically amen we saying preach to the Lost preach to the Lost you're preaching to nobody amen the opening of the word is three things the spoken word oh man the third p is three things you see this is all intellect the opening of the word is three third pull is three things the opening of the word like we writing exam here the opening of the word power the spoken word and preaching to the Lost hey full marks you think we're marking papers here no practical side to it then the thing we writing another testure Christ is the mystery of God revealed God is revealing himself in three ways through Jesus through the bride and he's restoring the kingdom hey well done well done full marks you want stop what's the second full mystery Christ want to be fully expressed through you when you say when you say bride you like put it the far off through you amen amen yes preaching to the Lost how about you start with your brother your sister yes amen yes Lord how about we become practical with the gospel amen amen we become practical with the gospel tell them I need to see you I need to speak to you and you got to be a good fisherman you got to know how to present the word the prophet of God teaches you how he tells you you need to find a topic and a thing and a way to bring it in if he was talking to a mechanic he would talk about certain things and he'll try and bring it in that angle he's talking to the farmer there amen with the apple he takes that angle and he talks about the apple and how the life goes into the ground amen comes back again be a good fisherman yes amen yes don't go start there now brother comes here Malachi 4:5 and 6 Revelation 10:7 know how to fish right amen amen amen what are we saying the prophet says it's better you love me a sermon and you preach me one more powerful this is what I'm telling you is happening this year and this is what I'm telling you is going to happen in the next few years you're going to see here the prophet tells it he says it's Harvest Time have you noticed that in the Harvest time though there is a real acceleration in the right name are we seeing the acceleration did I not I never I only found this quot the other day but have we not seen an acceleration in the spirit has that not been what I've been telling you you'll see an acceleration in the spirit you'll see an acceleration Amen in the move of God at Harvest Time there'll be an acceleration in the right rening he says there's so many spiritualists that know more about the spiritual World talking about now these fortune tellers and these they know more about the spiritual world than people who profess themselves to be Christians amen praise the Lord you see the high priests and the Levites of Jesus day they call Jesus a devil when when he was here on Earth they called Jesus a devil but here the Devil Comes the lowest form of demon man that was bound in the tombs the Devil Himself says we know who you are you're the Son of God the Holy One Devils can recognize who you are more than other people amen he says while educated Theological Seminary preachers recognized him to be beab which was right the devil or the preacher sure people always want to believe the preacher the high priest who was right in that case the high priest was calling him a devil the devil was calling him the Son of God the prophet is asking you a question who was right the devil or the preacher the devil was and he says brother it hasn't change much today they don't recognize the power of God no matter how much teaching you got you can drum that into it he says God is not in big words God is in an honest heart you might stand there speak big words like I don't know what that doesn't bring you closer to God some people sleep with the dictionary I wonder how I'm going to speak this word now and confuse the people you can stand and practice how to repeat teach a sermon and say these things that don't bring you closer to God you can learn the dictionary till you sleep with one is he saying this you can learn the dictionary till you sleep with one and it still wouldn't get you closer to God what gets me closer to God brother Brandon a humble submitted heart in the Simplicity is what brings you to God a humble heart God loves no matter if you don't know your ABCs that don't make a difference just a humble heart God dwells in a humble heart not in education it's in schools not in schools seminaries not big words God dwells in the human heart you see what Mark 11:23 says if you believe in your heart if you believe in your heart the words that you speak you shall have what you say amen amen do you realize that's where man fell from he never believed his own word so they asked Jesus how you spoke to them to the street Jesus said well I spoke with my mouth and I believed in my heart and he tells him you're talking about the tree look at this mountain here if you speak to this mountain and tell it where to go and you believe in your heart and you confess with your mouth you shall have what you said amen but that's too simple man he fell away from knowing who he is that he's the god of the earth amen that he's given dominion over the Earth didn't we read that in Romans 10 if you believe in your heart confess with your mouth you can be saved you shall be saved same principle applies in anything in life confess with your mouth believe in your heart am you see for too long maybe you've been confessing I'm good for nothing nothing good ever comes of me and you believe it in your heart that's why you continue that way right amen so you need to change the your confession yes when you change your confession you change your belief you change the way you think you change who you are amen so he says the lower down you can break yourself the more simple you can become greater in the sight of God Amen he says I see your fields of wheat out here are we wheat in the Bible he calls us wheat right listen what he says a full head of wheat always bows a little old spri sticks out there flopping around like it knows everything it ain't got it in the head that's the way with a lot of these guys that think they got a whole lot in their head nothing in the heart though a holy head will bow to the power oh recognize Jesus Christ amen as the Son of God and believe his Works amen he says now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the first original church was founded and how God manifested himself in her that's what the church was at Pentecost is the standard now listen to this if something is the standard it's the pattern God will never change yes we can't become so Advanced that we bypass God's pattern listen to this quote very carefully now the church at Pentecost is the standard amen amen that is the pattern yes there is no other pattern amen yes no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern amen what God did at pentec because he has to keep on doing until the church age closes yes amen amen I thought I can with my books at home my churches book my SE that's even saying that is like a figment of imagination cuz people don't sit with their Church AG book and they don't sit with their seals book they don't sit with a message book that's like a figment of our imagination now that we but it's not sitting at home doing nothing with the gospel he says the Pentecostal Church talking about Pentecost in the Bible is the pattern God never changed the pattern what he did at Pentecost he has got to keep on doing until the church age closes he says those Scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over don't you believe it such statement is wrong on two counts first it is wrong wrong to suppose that there aren't any more Apostles because the original 12 are dead and Apostle means sent ones there are many sent ones today as long as men are called and sent forth with the word of life there's an Apostolic age going on secondly they refer to the age of manifested holy ghost power as being over since the Bible has been completed that is untrue there's not even one scripture to suggest that here is our proof on both these charges are false acts 238 so he quotes acts 238 right and he says the promise of the power with which the apostles were endured at Pentecost is to you and he's got the Jews and to the children Jews and to them are far off which is Gentiles and many as the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and Gentile until he stops calling the pentec costal message and power will not cease you better sit back in your chair right now because I'm I'm going to preach for another hour I'm waiting for the second wind to come amen because I can see you dying out but you know a boxer he continues continues but then they get a second win so if you're about dying out now I'm going to preach until the second wind comes into [Music] you but you preaching so hard you want me to get involved in the things of God that's what you're asking me to do you're telling me to take my place so what am I telling you you better start saying amen others I'm going to continue you the second win better come in the next minute amen turn to your neighbor and say come on unless we can do this we can do this we can finish it hey because now if you left the roast in the oven I burnt roast you're going to go up to amen this is more important than lunch right now right amen because this what I'm telling you Mark 11:23 even if you don't have lunch you can go home and speak it yes amen you that's a genuine thing sometimes people don't have money for lunch people don't have money for food but what I'm telling you right now is so important that you can speak it into existence amen because the authority of Mark 11:23 is in me amen amen you see until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease what the church haded Pentecost is in a un inable that means absolute and undisputable Undisputed she had the word of power she had the word power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders gifts of the Holy Ghost right it tells you the holy the church was not organized by men led by the Holy Ghost wasn't very big it was hated and despised oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God in stayed with the original word and pattern yeah again he's telling you why is he saying so many time the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to appropriate the early first one and The Messengers of to the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try and approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come the closest to Paul who was free of all men sold out to God and gave forth the word of God only and manifested the Holy Ghost in power none else would do it you have to work from the original am you see the true church will always be the the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first church age it is that simple and that wonderful amen can you put up I see you got the aciron on here that's very good you got fans too who's feeling cold I need two people who's feeling cold here come come go come you're feeling cold come here one second come you shy you feeling cold with the Caleb I see you got your hands come here who else feeling cold what you feeling cold I need another volunteer feeling cold brother ty not who's feeling cold here I'm being serious now Jaden you look like you're feeling cold come here come stand the side stand close to the screen there you stand close to the screen here play that clip there brother stand close here close stand close put your hands there yeah warm yourself feeling warm hey are you feeling warm you saying yes that's probably the nervousness that's heating his body up but I mean can you feel any heat coming from there can you feel you can't get warmed by a painted fire what we are preaching to you is the power of the [Music] Resurrection you going to still stay there and get warm amen I put that illustration there because we go back to the quote and it says that all they recogniz I him sure but it's not a history thing people stand up and say I believe in Pentecost when they had a great outpouring and things like that and paint a fire a freezing man can be warmed by a painted fire go back to the you still want to warm yourself hey I should have called you what he says here people want to paint themselves like they're getting warmed like they're in the church they're in the move of God you can't get warmed by painted fire you see it needs to move from here people love this picture this pull of fire must be there with you must be in you must be warming you up yes if anyone wants to see what holy ghost power you got and they want to see a physical you say see this light here that's the only photograph of the angel of God the same one is leading me and guiding me amen yes make it live amen oh yes what they did at Pentecost when they had early Testament Church we got today how many of you can say Amen yes no no no how many of you can say Amen what they did at Pentecost what they had in the early Testament we got today amen hallelujah amen we are not looking in the book of Acts in amazement anymore and wow look at what they did there we are seeing the same things happen amongst us yes yes and as soon as God can get that thing H out and the church said together the Rapture will come so you can see the Rapture is closed now cuz it's getting ironed out but we can't even faith enough for Divine Healing LED on the Rapture because we've all twisted up one this way one that way dror so and so amen hallelujah so amen now let's just learn quickly as we close now how do we pray with the authority of the word if we say saying we got the authority of the word just want to show you a prayer that the prophet we can learn from these things right how to pray with authority yeah he says but if I could get the people to see that they've got absolutely come clean with God then I believe that I have authority by Jesus Christ break any power of any demon there is amen you say but I to pray for the sick sickness is a demon power yes if you can cast The Demon power the sickness leaves right so brother is saying this now what you got to do submit to the Holy Spirit Come clean with God Amen he says if I can do that I can break any demon power there is when Peter and John passed through the gate called Beautiful they never asked the man if he was a Believer or what he was or anything about it Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I give you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth stand up and walk he picked him up held him there until the his ankle bones got strength and away he went walking right we bringing this for I'm showing you the authority in a Believer now if they did it back there we doing it again and he said whatever you do on Earth I'll do the same in heaven if you lose anyone you on Earth I'll loose it in heaven then if I am representing him truthfully then he has given the authority of vindication in other words to make it true not because I said so but is here it's the truth then if if I should ask for you to be loosed of this heart trouble God will confirm it in heaven amen right and now to obey his word I lay my hands on you and in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God you see how he's praying now watch I loose This Heart trouble as his representative and now Satan you bound her trying to make her take her to the Grave yet aged you see he's saying even though she's old are you following the prophet he saying you're trying to take her to the Grave even though she's old but our God doesn't look at age and I come to serve a warrant upon you as a representative of Calvary as God's agent and you cannot stay in this house any longer you have to move out because as the Holy Spirit the detective of God who here and your secret places are revealed and you can't hide any longer and by the authority of almighty God In The Name of Jesus cursed be the heart trouble of this woman and may she be loose now amen in the name of Jesus Christ go and God's peace be with you amen give God praise amen praying with the authority I'm going to post that prayer on the group because I need you to learn it amen let out to pray with the authority of the scripture amen oh thank you Jesus you must be a Demon Slayer be one who cast out demons amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so we know that God is sending has sent a Vindicated Prophet Amen brother you need to help me I'm not going to read the whole quote because I need to close now he says and those it's in the next quote but you may have to scroll through it a but I'm reading the last sentence of that quote and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works yeah it is here those elect with him talking about the elect with the prophet right see what he's saying here the elect of the last day they will hear a Vindicated Prophet have we heard a Vindicated Prophet so he's talking to us now he will restore the truth the those elect

calling you aside even now if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ is that now amen he will place into the church some of the powers that Christ had in him all the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church amen right now lift your hand and say Lord I want all the power amen give me the power Lord all the power oh God lord I am the church Lord I see myself as this quote Lord all that God was he poured into the church into Jesus right you can look look now all that Jesus was he paused into the church God wanting his work done he sent it into his son the son wanting his work done sent it into the church he says at that day you'll know I'm in the Father the father in me I in you at that day because the same power of God that was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ the same power of God that rested in Jesus Christ rest in the placed sons in the body of Christ you see God took his son out and placed him before Angels the prophet is saying then the person that has Authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on that's the very same thing I'm talking will be

thunders at their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it'll slice it'll cut they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want Glory he'll be slay by the word that proceeds from his mouth he sharper than a two-edged sword they could call for a 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to whatever they say is going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God you're telling me that I am the mouthpiece of God yes you are yes amen amen God always it's his word but he always uses man to work it am God could
