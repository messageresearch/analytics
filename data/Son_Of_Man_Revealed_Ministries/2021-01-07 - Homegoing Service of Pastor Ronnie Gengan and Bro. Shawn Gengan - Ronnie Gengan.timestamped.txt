[9:18] want to read one portion of
[9:20] scripture and in the Book of Romans
[9:23] chapter 8 and verse 11 the Bible says
[9:26] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[9:30] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[9:35] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[9:37] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[9:40] spirit that dwelleth in you may the Lord
[9:43] add a blessing to the reading of the
[9:44] word
[9:48] hallelujah my brothers and
[9:50] sisters there was one time a great
[9:53] Caesar
[9:55] austa who won the Victory and won the
[9:58] battle and as he won the battle there
[10:01] was a celebration that they were going
[10:02] to give him in the land of
[10:05] Rome and uh in order to celebrate he
[10:08] wanted one worthy man to join him and my
[10:12] brothers and sisters he the news went
[10:15] around and all the soldiers and the army
[10:18] people they got ready and they shined up
[10:20] their armors and their swords and so on
[10:24] Hallelujah and they all lined up and
[10:27] when they lined up they went to King
[10:30] Cesar austa and as he looked at the
[10:33] first sergeant or or the general
[10:36] Hallelujah they were able to salute but
[10:39] he shook his head and he and and he
[10:41] passed by because Cesar austa was
[10:44] looking for one
[10:46] person and it didn't meet the
[10:48] requirements and eventually Soldier by
[10:50] Soldier they passed his
[10:52] aasta and after a short while there was
[10:55] a little
[10:56] footman he didn't have any Shield
[10:59] that was polished neither did he have
[11:02] any plume to trim but he walked in front
[11:05] of Caesar he didn't even know the right
[11:08] way to salute but he bowed his head and
[11:11] walked away Cesar said wait a minute who
[11:14] are you come back here he walked up and
[11:17] looked at him he said there's SCS over
[11:20] his face there's cuts and disness and
[11:24] crippled up where did you get them SCS
[11:27] at Cesar Augusta asked him and he said
[11:31] out in the battlefield fighting for my
[11:34] Lord
[11:35] Caesar and Cesar Augusta said climb up
[11:38] here sit down by my side you are the one
[11:42] that's been tested and proved my
[11:45] brothers and sisters a few days ago the
[11:49] same thing happened there was a greater

[12:21] they needed a rest amen and because they
[12:24] needed a rest he said Hallelujah I want
[12:26] you to you didn't look for the salute
[12:28] amen he didn't look for a theological
[12:31] decree for that type of salute
[12:33] Hallelujah he wanted a soldier that was
[12:35] chosen before the foundation of the
[12:37] world was called by almighty God

[25:18] strengthen you and see you through this
[25:20] time my brother only
[25:23] was one of seven
[25:25] children we were two sisters and five
[25:28] brothers
[25:29] Brothers uh my one sister is surviving
[25:32] she's she's closer to 80 now and
[25:37] myself
[25:41] uh Ronnie uh you know we had a very hard
[25:46] life from the very beginning and we were
[25:49] we lost our dad when we were very
[25:52] young
[25:55] uh and my mother she look up seven
[25:59] children and she raised all of us and we
[26:02] all of us including brother Ronnie did
[26:05] our job by helping my mother uh you know
[26:09] uh buying vegetables in the Indian
[26:12] market and selling it they every
[26:16] day uh and mostly on weekends Saturdays
[26:19] I know brother Ronnie My Brother Jay
[26:21] myself we'll all go and help my mother
[26:24] and that's how she raised us up and she
[26:26] raised good children
[26:28] and my brother was one of
[26:31] them he was very humble kind
[26:36] polite never in normal life I saw him
[26:39] angry or upset or
[26:44] violent
[26:45] he survived many tragedies in his life
[26:49] one of them I remember when he
[26:51] was a young boy I think maybe about 12
[26:56] or so we were living in second river and
[27:00] he went to the supermarket there and
[27:03] that Supermarket they had some very
[27:06] vicious
[27:07] dogs and when he went to the supermarket
[27:10] I don't know why that day they left the
[27:11] dogs open so one of the dogs got him LIF
[27:15] I think just above his his knee he had
[27:19] want to go surgery and he had many
[27:21] stitches and then also in life he also
[27:24] had a very serious accident when he uh
[27:27] and he broke his leg and I think he he
[27:30] his shoulder and other parts of his body
[27:32] and then he also had a bypass I think
[27:36] his triple or quadruple bypass and he
[27:38] survived all that by the grace of
[27:41] God and
[27:45] uh as I said I never saw him very angry
[27:49] he came through and done his duty and
[27:52] finished the cause his entire life was
[27:55] dedicated to preaching this gospel
[27:57] anytime you see him at home he's always
[28:01] reading listening to the message or
[28:03] doing something about the
[28:07] gospel and of course brother Sean is
[28:11] also a chip of the old block he's just
[28:13] like his dad very humble jial respectful
[28:17] very decent person I never saw him as
[28:19] well angry or unhappy whenever I saw him
[28:22] he was always happy he was always Jo and
[28:24] you know he got on very well with people
[28:29] you know the Bible says that we must
[28:32] train up our children the way they
[28:34] should go and when they grow up they
[28:37] will not depart from it and I can say
[28:40] that brother on has done a good job he
[28:42] trained his children up in the ways of
[28:44] the Lord and I'm sure that will always
[28:48] remain with them am I pray now and thank
[28:51] you uh uh for the family I pray uh
[28:55] especially now I know it's very
[28:59] but God will see your through thank
[29:03] you thank
[29:06] you bless you next we like to call our
[29:10] brother
[29:11] L give a speech also on of Sean and also
[29:17] our Ron
[29:28] [Music]
[29:39] God blessed brothers and
[29:40] sisters um my dad would have been the
[29:43] person giving speech but um he's not
[29:47] able to because
[29:50] brother was a very close friend of his
[29:53] and Sean being his son-in-law I think
[29:56] it's
[29:59] too much over for and the person that I
[30:03] he friends everywhere he and
[30:10] um thing is that you know Sean if he was
[30:15] angry with him to about something
[30:17] automatically changed because it was
[30:21] that's his nature he just smile at you
[30:23] and and that was way it would end and
[30:26] even UNC R um we've known him for many
[30:31] years um I think he close to about 30
[30:34] plus uh little children we all played
[30:36] together and later on through life um we
[30:41] started dating my sister and married um
[30:44] but yeah we've been really close to them
[30:47] about I think a month or two back uh um
[30:51] Ron was at my house and came to visit
[30:53] and now Al also they we had quite a long
[30:57] conversation and and I think it was the
[30:59] first time actually did as one thing Ron
[31:02] always jokes with me is that he says
[31:04] know this guy doesn't eat Brown because
[31:06] in I was little I used to shouldn't like
[31:08] to get brown bread and uh now uh it's a
[31:12] very sad loss for us I think on all
[31:15] sides whether it's the church the family
[31:18] because they both were very close in
[31:20] that they both have the very same nature
[31:22] similar nature they both had an impact
[31:24] Sean was quite a good Music
[31:26] musician relationships with all
[31:29] different churches all different types
[31:31] of
[31:32] people and if you speak to anybody know
[31:34] but I know Sean either from Phoenix or
[31:37] Springfield Park or wherever he went he
[31:40] had friends and I think we've also seen
[31:41] that past Ronnie he's had friends all
[31:44] over the world and that speaks a lot
[31:45] about their nature and and the
[31:49] humbleness you know past would do a lot
[31:52] of things for people but you never hear
[31:54] him mention
[31:55] it my dad was just telling me the you
[31:58] know
[31:59] this and and the things that he did for
[32:01] people but it's never something that he
[32:04] would say even as a preacher never
[32:06] mention in front of anyone but you know
[32:08] he's he's a true man of God um and
[32:12] um and also like to say to brother
[32:16] Adrian and and and his family as well it
[32:18] must be a very difficult situation that
[32:20] can't imagine what the feeling is U I
[32:23] think a lot of us feel maybe a portion
[32:25] of it because um un was was Ronnie was
[32:29] our pastor um and Sean was also very
[32:33] active within the church and and and
[32:36] even with friends and and so on and most
[32:39] people that we that knew them we had a
[32:42] bond with with both of them it wasn't
[32:44] just one person and um I think for for
[32:49] my sister and and even his daughters
[32:52] it's it's a really difficult thing um
[32:55] and and at that point when this did take
[32:58] place we we were so positive about about
[33:01] him and as well communication was was
[33:05] something that we we didn't even think
[33:07] that things would turn out this way and
[33:10] uh just pray that God blesses and
[33:14] Comforts them is going to something that
[33:17] they going you know God's going to need
[33:18] to assist them through
[33:21] and I just like to thank a lord for for
[33:24] helping us and giving us
[33:32] thank you to
[33:33] that appreciate those kind words pastor
[33:37] and Sean next we have our brother Joshua
[33:41] CH who going to speak on behalf of both
[33:45] Pastor Ronnie and our brother Sean and
[33:47] he's going to also speak on behalf of
[33:48] our church son of man
[33:51] Ministries Joshua is a minister at our
[33:54] church and like
[34:10] greet our
[34:11] pastors Ministers of the Gospel saints
[34:14] of God family and friends the precious
[34:18] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[34:20] Christ on behalf of our assembly son of
[34:24] man revealed Ministries
[34:32] we would like
[34:34] to I like to say a few words on behalf
[34:37] of Pastor Ron genger also Our Shepherd
[34:40] and
[34:41] pastor and his precious son
[34:45] sh if I truly speak of the
[34:49] characteristics of P
[34:51] Ron it will take up volumes of words but
[34:56] truly he was a person of such remarkable
[34:59] character he left an imprint on you he
[35:04] was truly a man of God with a true
[35:07] calling in the office of the 54
[35:10] Ministry under the office of a
[35:13] pastor he was not a person who was
[35:15] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[35:18] every wind of Doctrine but he preached
[35:20] sound Doctrine and never
[35:23] wavered as brother Adrian said to me the
[35:26] other day a Great Oak Tree had
[35:29] fallen Pastor Ronnie was very calculated
[35:32] in his
[35:33] decision if he had made a decision about
[35:35] something we could not convince him
[35:38] otherwise because he had already looked
[35:40] at the pros and
[35:41] cons he groomed young ministers in the
[35:44] church and always encouraged the
[35:46] progression of the music department he
[35:49] loved the worship and he loved the
[35:51] word he loved each family he knew every
[35:55] child individually
[35:57] he labored in the ministry always
[36:00] visiting families in their homes even
[36:03] when they were in
[36:04] hospital always cared for the sick
[36:07] always look after the widows he never
[36:09] wanted to be an old man and always said
[36:13] God must take him home and always spoke
[36:16] of how death was just a door to take you
[36:19] to your Eternal destination today is
[36:21] rejoicing in that that sixth Dimension
[36:24] the church will truly miss him and we
[36:27] will be waiting earnestly for the
[36:29] resurrection to take place to meet out
[36:31] to meet our
[36:32] pastor our precious brother
[36:37] Sean is one of the most humble meest and
[36:41] sweetest characters I personally
[36:43] knew he loves music and always
[36:47] compliments the band when he plays his
[36:49] keyboard Sean was very connected with
[36:51] his
[36:52] father in so many ways when he was young
[36:56] he worked with him for many years
[36:58] and in the ministry he assisted him in
[37:00] music and I believe today they are
[37:02] united in glory together on behalf of
