[4:11] in the world transpiring according to

[4:16] prophecy that's also being fulfilled and
[4:18] that's the bride is making herself ready
[4:20] amen each one of us are making ourselves
[4:23] ready we thank God for his grace in our
[4:25] lives amen amen let's read from Genesis
[4:28] 18 and 1. it says and the Lord appeared
[4:31] unto him in the plains of memory and he
[4:34] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[4:36] day
[4:37] and he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[4:39] low three men stood by him and when he
[4:42] saw them he ran to meet them from the
[4:45] tent door and bowed himself toward the
[4:48] ground
[4:49] amen what reverence that is amen
[4:53] and said my Lord if now I have found
[4:55] favor in thy sight pass not away I
[4:58] prayed thee from thy servant the spirit
[5:01] of the Lord just wants me to say this
[5:02] right now amen Abraham had reverence to
[5:05] that angel and he bowed down before that
[5:08] angel
[5:09] people must bow down before the angel
[5:11] that came down in Revelation 10 amen but
[5:13] people have disrespect to the angel
[5:16] amen but we thank God that we have
[5:18] reverence towards death amen when that
[5:21] Mighty Angel descended amen he says let
[5:24] any little water I pray you be fetched
[5:27] and watch your wash your feet and rest
[5:29] yourself under the tree so remember you
[5:32] already have communion with him
[5:40] amen these ordinance has been restored
[5:43] to the church
[5:44] and I will fetch a morsel of bread and
[5:47] comfort you your hearts after that ye
[5:50] shall pass on for therefore I come to
[5:53] your servant and they said so do as thou
[5:56] I said God won't stop you doing anything
[5:58] for the kingdom amen you may be seated
[6:00] God bless you
[6:02] amen go title this morning we're going
[6:04] to speak
[6:05] the own land of the Bride
[6:08] which is the message of the hour
[6:11] amen our safe place the message of the
[6:15] hour amen so we know that God just to
[6:18] background it a bit God always has a way
[6:21] of getting his people to the place where
[6:22] he wants them positionally
[6:24] amen if you want you in a particular
[6:27] geographical position he will change
[6:29] circumstances and situations to get you
[6:32] to that place amen you remember he asked
[6:35] Abraham to leave his country he was
[6:37] changing his geographical location and
[6:39] going into a land that God would show
[6:41] him Noah was in one geographical
[6:44] location but after the flood God took
[6:46] him to another land
[6:48] amen hallelujah Enoch was living in the
[6:51] land of the Earth but God took him to
[6:54] the heavenlies he changed his occasion
[6:56] amen so God what he does sometimes he
[7:00] changed political conditions he changes
[7:02] the religious conditions the
[7:04] ecclesiastical conditions he changes
[7:06] economic conditions you remember what
[7:09] happened to Naomi
[7:11] and a husband he changed the economic
[7:13] situation so they left the land
[7:15] amen amen so spiritual conditions have
[7:18] also driven people away
[7:21] read that in the latest in churches amen
[7:24] and and when they were down in Egypt God
[7:28] changed the conditions to get them out
[7:30] of a comfortable lifestyle in Egypt they
[7:33] were becoming rulers in Egypt amen they
[7:36] were becoming a great and mighty nation
[7:38] they were building cities for pharaoh
[7:41] but that was not the god ordained
[7:43] purpose your purpose in life is not to
[7:46] work and make your boss rich but your
[7:48] purpose in life is to serve the King of
[7:50] Kings and the Lord of lords amen
[7:53] hallelujah we should never lose focus of
[7:56] that amen so what will God do God will
[8:00] shake up a nation God will bring plague
[8:02] upon plague upon a nation if they refuse
[8:05] to let his people go and if demon powers
[8:08] are holding God's people down God will
[8:11] stop at nothing but he will raise up a
[8:13] standard in this day and in this hour to
[8:16] shake the sinner's Kingdom amen so that
[8:19] these people can go free this morning
[8:22] amen God's not going to let demon powers
[8:24] hold his bride down amen but he whom the
[8:27] son of man is set free he is free indeed
[8:30] this morning
[8:31] amen hallelujah so God is going to
[8:34] change your situation in our lives to
[8:37] bring us to our ought to be conditioned
[8:39] amen amen and we resist God God's gonna
[8:43] bring an even creature shaking in our
[8:45] lives amen hallelujah amen God will
[8:49] shake up Pharaoh's Kingdom God will
[8:51] bring down that that dynasty the family
[8:54] dynasty of pharaoh amen he will kill the
[8:57] succession to the throne and he killed
[9:00] Pharaoh's son right yes
[9:03] that's how God values his people amen
[9:06] Hallelujah and when if God had not sent
[9:09] the mighty angel in Revelation 10 that
[9:12] peace was going to do a walk with us he
[9:15] was going to deceive the old word and we
[9:17] were going to be deceived also
[9:19] yes yes
[9:20] amen oh yeah I did not beat for the
[9:23] coming of that Mighty angel with the
[9:25] open book in his hand to open up the
[9:27] revelation of the word we wouldn't have
[9:30] been able to identify the Beast
[9:33] but we thank God for revelation 10.
[9:36] amen then he came down look at what God
[9:39] did he stopped and nothing to rescue

[9:44] Jericho just to conquer the city but
[9:47] there was a predestinated scene in
[9:50] Jericho that day and God checked into
[9:53] motion a plan to rescue rehab and her
[9:56] family
[9:57] God wants to rescue you and your family
[10:00] amen get your loved ones under this
[10:05] covering under the token of the hour
[10:08] amen rehab didn't go about just being
[10:12] haphazard about it but I believe she
[10:14] persuaded a mother and a father of
[10:17] brothers and a sisters and all her loved
[10:19] ones to come into the house that day
[10:23] what did she have in the house she had

[20:19] can't even look at us for example than a
[20:21] testimony

[21:50] you remember a few months ago we showed
[21:52] you how the review of phrases is drying

[22:02] river
[22:03] so the natural types of spiritual

[22:33] two hundred thousand thousand that's 200
[22:36] million right and I heard the number of
[22:38] them and thus I saw the horses in a
[22:41] vision and them that sat on them having
[22:43] breastplates of Fire
[22:45] and of Jason and brimstone heads of
[22:48] horses as were the heads of lions
[22:51] and out of their mouth issued fire and
[22:53] smoke and broomstone notice those three
[22:56] words the prophet will describe it to
[22:59] you how they unloose their wrath upon
[23:01] the Jews with fire smoke and broom Stone
[23:05] when they gassed him they burnt them
[23:08] amen and they shot them
[23:13] he said by these three was the third
[23:16] part of men killed by the fire and by
[23:19] the smoke and by the brimstone which
[23:21] issued out of their mouths for their
[23:24] power is in their mouth and in their
[23:26] tails they have a good Tales to tell
[23:29] you they tell you about their sins
[23:32] he says not a t-a-i-e-l but a t-a-l-e
[23:36] they got A Tale To Tell You for their
[23:39] Tales were like unto serpents and add
[23:41] heads and with them they do hurt
[23:46] that sounds painful right if you have to
[23:49] see the physical demon
[23:51] or physical Beast that the Bible is
[23:53] describing but these are spiritual
[23:55] demons that are already let loose
[23:59] that we have to encounter every day and
[24:01] these are the demon powers we are
[24:03] fighting
[24:04] let's go and see what the prophet breaks
[24:06] it down he says there was a natural
[24:08] horses
[24:09] they breathe fire they had breastplates
[24:11] of Jasper they had tales and the end of
[24:14] the tail looked like a serpent a snake's
[24:16] head on the end of its stinging it was
[24:19] spiritual horses
[24:21] spiritual Devils charges that have been
[24:24] bound in the Euphrates all these years
[24:27] Supernatural Devils yes
[24:30] now he goes to describe it what was it
[24:33] the old Roman empire being revived the
[24:36] persecution of the Jews
[24:38] they have been bound nearly 2 000 years
[24:40] at the river Euphrates couldn't cross to
[24:43] the promise a religious sect that was
[24:46] trying to get to the other side
[24:48] your French as you know came through
[24:50] Eden and they were bounded two hundred
[24:53] thousand thousand Devils of persecution
[24:56] hmm
[24:57] what's always going to tie to us now not
[24:59] just reading what happened in history
[25:00] he's going to bring it down to us
[25:03] and he says notice what happens under
[25:05] that sixth trumpet Supernatural devils
[25:08] then Loose by Stalin Hitler and upon the
[25:13] Jews you say well that isn't Roman it's
[25:15] the same spirit
[25:17] they've done the same things they did to
[25:19] the Christians in the old Pagan Roman
[25:22] days right now watch the natural Israel
[25:24] the spiritual church now as we separate
[25:28] it here
[25:29] hmm right goes on to say 200 000 demons
[25:33] turned loose upon the Jews when they
[25:36] burned them
[25:37] They Crucified them they put bubbles in
[25:40] their veins
[25:42] they killed him till they had no more
[25:45] gas to kill them
[25:48] they shot them till they had no more
[25:50] bullets to shoot them with
[25:52] they done everything they could they
[25:55] cremated their bodies and everything
[25:56] hung on fences children and all innocent
[26:00] people
[26:01] because they were Jews
[26:03] they were down that way but God said he
[26:06] would give each one of them a rope okay
[26:09] look at what these Supernatural Devils
[26:11] did
[26:13] they brought a physical persecution upon
[26:16] six million Jews
[26:19] that's a six million that died but they
[26:22] brought in upon millions of Jews and six
[26:25] million of them succumbed to these
[26:27] Supernatural devils
[26:29] Stalin Hitler Mussolini
[26:33] Hitler
[26:36] amen what will these demons do to you if
[26:41] you are not covered by the blood if you
[26:43] are not under the protection of that
[26:45] Mighty angel

[26:48] mighty Angel yes you are
[26:50] amen just read your Bible a little
[26:52] you'll see that angel is standing upon

[27:04] the Beast coming out of the sea yes

[27:09] powers

[27:19] the prophet is saying he says we find
[27:21] out that that natural power and the
[27:23] natural tune so that he's talking about

[27:43] Protestant economical Council of work
[27:46] churches have we seen it yes did we go
[27:49] through it yes amen

[27:54] instrumental in bringing the Protestants
[27:55] and the Catholics amen

[28:04] slaughter just like they did the other
[28:07] in the hour to call the bride look at
[28:09] when this is happening when the shout is
[28:12] going out

[28:15] the same time the ecclesiastical power
[28:17] that let loose

[28:45] spirit

[28:50] under the seventh seal
[28:54] I know what seal is the mighty Angel
[28:56] loose

[29:26] guide you every step of the way that's
[29:29] why we've got to be under the anointing

[29:35] he says under the seventh seal the
[29:38] seventh trumpet to the Jews he says look
[29:40] at the Moon darkening out you remember
[29:42] those six phases of the moon he says
[29:44] what under sea drawn out what was

[35:16] of the Bride or be awakened this morning
[35:18] amen and the bride has to be taken away
[35:21] before they can recognize what's
[35:24] happened waiting for the going of the
[35:26] Bride so the prophet of Revelation 11
[35:28] can call them to the Feast of the
[35:30] trumpet to make them recognize what they
[35:33] have done
[35:34] amen hallelujah thank you Lord can't
[35:37] press that button for that bomb even
[35:40] though every day is threatening to use

[35:47] the winds Windsor was in strife
[35:51] yeah amen he can't touch that button
[35:53] until the bride gets out of here
[35:56] thank you he says God has separated us
[35:59] from all dead religions separated us and
[36:02] opened us to a new land amen what are we
[36:05] preaching the homeland of the Bride the
[36:08] message of the hour he says he's opened
[36:10] us a new land a new message for this day
[36:14] the message of the hour is our homeland
[36:17] that's right find your nourishment in
[36:19] the message of the hour
[36:20] amen find healing in the message of the
[36:23] hour trying to deliver it to the message
[36:25] of the hour
[36:27] amen I want to break down the court for
[36:29] you brother Brandon says God heals
[36:31] through music yes God heals through
[36:34] medicine God eats through food amen he
[36:37] says God has different ways of healing
[36:40] but you know some of us reject God's way
[36:42] of healing because we are thinking
[36:44] healing is a miracle
[36:47] so if God is telling you he heals
[36:49] through music how about we listen to
[36:52] some good holy ghost film music and let
[36:55] him bring healing
[36:57] if our body is sick how about we eat the
[37:00] right types of food and let him heal our
[37:02] bodies with food
[37:07] you see what we are doing
[37:09] we are trusting God for healing but
[37:11] expecting a miracle
[37:13] why don't you ask you for a miracle in
[37:15] the first place say Lord I don't even
[37:17] want the healing through music I don't
[37:19] want the healing through food I don't
[37:21] want the healing through medicine
[37:23] I need a miracle a miracle is instant
[37:26] but healing is a process
[37:29] [Music]
[37:30] but this bunny China is looking too good
[37:37] but it'll take sacrifice
[37:41] do you really want your healing because
[37:43] he's given us wisdom amen yes didn't he
[37:47] give us wisdom you read it in some age
[37:50] he says wisdom was there before the
[37:52] foundation of the world Amen if in fact
[37:54] if you go and read Genesis 1 you'll be
[37:56] very sad because God is telling Adam the
[37:59] herbs is for your meat
[38:04] hey he bypasses all the cattle and the
[38:08] Animals he's looking at this big juicy
[38:10] state
[38:11] and then God says the up shall be your
[38:13] meat and the fruits of the tree
[38:18] amen let's go on
[38:21] so what did he say he opened up a new
[38:24] land denominations know nothing about
[38:26] this land
[38:28] believe me malema know nothing about
[38:30] this land
[38:32] he can't take this land without
[38:34] compensation
[38:36] because he didn't die for this land yeah
[38:38] the Redeemer died for this land amen
[38:42] he opened up the seals
[38:44] Mandela can't give it to you yes
[38:49] the message new message for this day
[38:52] he said what did he do watch how he
[38:54] opened up the land he opened up the
[38:56] Seven Seals of the last message
[38:58] you notice that the Seven Seals which
[39:01] all the mysteries of the seven Church
[39:03] age were sealed with Seven Seals the
[39:05] reformers didn't have time to do it in
[39:07] the days they didn't live long enough
[39:09] but this blessed revelation
[39:12] amen let's say it again yes let's let's
[39:14] embrace it like that this blessed
[39:17] revelation of the seventh seal is open
[39:20] to us in this last days from a prophecy
[39:23] that went out in Arizona
[39:25] what was it
[39:27] go to connect with the Angel's message
[39:29] then he had to go back east
[39:33] he says then we've got the Revelation in
[39:36] the last days for the message of the
[39:38] Lord together is bright together
[39:43] no other age has been promised
[39:46] it's been promised in this age
[39:48] amen Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Saint John 14
[39:51] 12 Joel 2 28 those promises is just
[39:55] exactly like John the Baptist identified
[39:58] himself in the scripture
[40:00] he says the church won't be able to
[40:02] receive it that's their pattern neither
[40:04] will the church receive it today he says
[40:07] they didn't receive it then they won't
[40:08] receive it today but listen what he says
[40:10] but through the elected Hallelujah God
[40:13] is calling to the election
[40:15] calling this morning
[40:17] it says they know it
[40:19] calling The Virtuous bride the word the
[40:22] last day Church the elected Lady of our
[40:25] Lord Jesus Christ were amen amen amen
[40:30] now in closing I want to tell you this
[40:32] when they got to the land and they
[40:34] signed the Declaration in the U.N and
[40:37] they told them
[40:38] Israel is now a nation
[40:41] when they went to the land
[40:42] the land was like a desert
[40:46] who had to walk the land yes
[40:51] they couldn't be lazy Jews
[40:55] now I know it reminds you of someone
[40:56] very close by here another Nation close
[40:59] by they want the land but they don't
[41:01] want to walk the land
[41:04] day thinking as soon as you get the land
[41:06] the rates lights and water everything is
[41:08] paid for
[41:10] they don't understand how it works
[41:13] there'll be pay rates we pay for lights
[41:15] yes we pay for water
[41:17] we pay for everything
[41:19] we pay for them to have 10 children then
[41:21] collect the grants
[41:25] but they think it's free
[41:27] because all they do is get a sassa card
[41:29] and go collect at the end of the month
[41:34] now they have to work the land natural
[41:37] Israel I had to walk the land to receive
[41:40] a natural Harvest how about spiritual
[41:42] Israel
[41:44] now that the land has been opened up to
[41:46] us
[41:48] spiritual Israel must walk the land to
[41:51] get the fruits of the spirit
[41:53] to get the fruit of the land to get a
[41:55] harvest in this time
[41:57] and you know what this bride has not
[41:59] been lazy
[42:00] ever since she received the message of
[42:02] the hour from the pioneering fathers
[42:05] that received the message of the hour
[42:06] they went forth amen under Revelation 10
[42:10] 8 even though they may not have known a
[42:12] brother Joshua
[42:13] they didn't even know they were
[42:15] fulfilling Revelation 10 8 to 11 but
[42:18] they began to prophesy again amen and
[42:20] they began to preach the word of God
[42:22] they were not lazy men you heard Pastor
[42:24] Dan last week how they went out intense
[42:27] amen
[42:29] Hallelujah
[42:31] and now they labored and sacrificed and
[42:33] spread the word that even the message
[42:35] came across our way
