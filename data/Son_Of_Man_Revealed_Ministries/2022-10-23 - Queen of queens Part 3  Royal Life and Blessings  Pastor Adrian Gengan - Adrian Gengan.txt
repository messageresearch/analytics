Thanksgiving amen amen we creature one and all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's certainly good to be found in the house of the Lord amen into a it's a really honor amen that we are called to this inheritance amen amen so we love you we appreciate you praying for you and I trust you're praying for us amen first you're praying for one another we need one another's prayer along this journey amen hallelujah and even as we see the day fast approaching you know if we look around things are happening so rapidly you can hardly keep up with the news if you are reading it Through The Eyes of the message because this is exciting you and that's exciting and it's falling into place and the seals are coming alive amen and you know what all of that is telling us it's going home time amen hallelujah and we look forward to that time amen when the Lord will call us away amen Hallelujah you're just going to move the communion service to next week Wednesday Amen to accommodate our brother uh subation was going away for three days of training he didn't want to miss the communion service so amen let's just move it to the next week Wednesday amen so this morning amen will speak on queen of queens or three will speak on Royal life and blessings amen Royal life and blessings let's turn to our scripture Galatians chapter 3 and verse 6. somebody told me the other day I've never ever heard a title of queen of Queens I said yes you'll never hear of it because you got to be in it to know who you are amen [Music] Galatians chapter 3 and verse 6 reads even as Abraham believed God and it was a counter to him for righteousness knowing therefore that they which are Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Eden through faith isn't that us God Justified us through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying indeed shall All Nations be blessed what an inheritance amen and when he said thou must prophesy again he's again telling the people that it through us the nations of the world will be blessed once again so then they would be be afraid are blessed with faithful Abraham so all Abraham's blessings are ours through the Royal Seed of Abraham amen now let's turn to Ephesians 1 and verse 3. remember our topic is the Royal life and blessings amen so Ephesians 1 and 3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ we have all spiritual blessings and we are not just here on the Earth we are seated together with him in Heavenly places amen may the Lord have blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated now just about a quarter of the prophet regarding the message of the hour that we have received now the message is really a sacred trust to you and I and we have got to watch how we handle the message our attitude to the message amen this is really gold given to us if gold is the most precious metal it's it seems uh bad to compare to something material like that but just to give it value this ought to be more than life to us and listen what the prophet says now he said God demands respects God sends his message you listen to it and you reverence it don't care if they call it a bunch of Holy Rollers or whatever they call it let the world do what they want but you give respects amen now we find the more that that we read the message now why why were you encouraging you to read the message I know that you are all listening to the tapes I know that you are reading the messages that when the messages are coming forth week after week you begin to enjoy the messages more amen you'll know exactly where the ministry is preaching out of and you begin to amend the word amen now our lives mustn't be dry we must enrich ourselves with the word of God when we enrich ourselves with the word of God we find ourselves being washed By the Waters of the world we find ourselves being changed we'll find ourselves becoming more anointed we find ourselves being amen delivered of demon spirit because the preaching of the word cast out demon spirits we'll find ourselves being built up by faith because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word the word of God Amen we find that we are the anointed voice for the age we we want the original anointing the original anointing 48 came by the seventh angel and because we received this message amen hallelujah we are now a continuation of that same anointing that same anointing of that flying eagle that's flying through the land amen and what do we have with us we are carrying the blood of Jesus Christ and we are sprinkling the blood of Jesus Christ all across the Earth saying to us whoever will let him come and drink freely amen we are the anointed one for the age and what a prophet messenger we have I tell you you can take all the gifted men of the Earth but what a anointed Prophet messenger we had what a humble anointed messenger of God who stayed faithful to the call of God amen and whose message we are still benefiting from amen this morning amen I believe we are to give you reverence to the message of the hour I believe we ought to appreciate the message of the hour amen this is the Royal life we have been called unto amen amen amen hallelujah and you know people in the world are so unaware that God sent this message so unaware that he sent it by the mighty angel of Revelation 10. to the seventh angel now the prophet said that this messenger of Revelation 10 is on Earth at the time of the coming of the mighty angel yeah yes amen and yeah he was standing on the earth when this Mighty angel came down from heaven and if I had to equate it to something it's like the captain of the horse who ascended amen who descended for to set the battle in the rain when Joshua Was preparing to take over that City now this bride is preparing to take all the New Jerusalem and the mighty Angel has come down to set the battle in the rain amen and and we find amen the seventh angel that this message came to reveal the mystery of God and when that initial mystery of God was revealed when we knew who God is every other Revelation broke through amen you cannot know of God Amen if we don't know our God we cannot understand him we cannot understand his ways but because we understand who God is and that's a blessed Revelation given to us amen I tell you there's nobody else upon the face of the Earth who's living a royal life who knows their God people are confused they don't know God amen the denominational world is believing in the Trinity of Gods even the Oneness do not have a true revelation of the godhead the Jehovah's Witnesses do not have a true revelation amen the Hindu man the Muslim man the Buddha amen take all the religions of the world nobody is living a royal life who has the knowledge of the one true Living God Amen pride is living a royal life amen because like Daniel said of people who knows that God shall do great exploits I asked you to consider that again you are the only people on the face of the Earth who understand the revelation of God and that is no light thing that's a revelation given to us amen and to you it is given to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom amen amen the disciples had that revelation they knew who this was yes amen let's go to John chapter 14. it's not you in the notes amen let's go to John chapter 14. I just want to go there quick while the spirit brings us to mind amen hallelujah while you're turning their amen so we have been privileged to have this most glorious message a message straight from the portals of Heaven brought down to the Earth by God almighty what a wonderful opportunity we have church to be United with Christ amen now this is now Jesus talking to the disciples right he says you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you now you know Jesus is talking about bodies there right we're not talking about this I just want to get to a place let's move to the next verse next let's go down I'll tell you when to start okay let's go back one Jesus said to them I am the way the truth and the life no man covered unto the father but by me now watch the plain language right if you had known me you should have known my father also and from nsworth you know him and have seen him amen I don't know how much more plainer that can be yeah now I tell you millions of people are reading this verse and it is veiled to them look at that he's saying from Edgewood you have known him and you have seen him that's why I say what a glorious Revelation to know our God amen now the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ which is US each and every one is footly framed in the body of Jesus Christ or to be living and I believe that we are living a rich Royal life amen if we have been fortified by the word of God our life ought to be full of goodness full of the richness of God like a land overflowing with milk and honey people should be eating from the fatness of the land thinking from the fatness of the land amen that's what I tell you do not quench the spirit yes amen amen amen let your life overflow with the spirit because people are hungering and bursting out there but you can live a life so full of the spirit of God that you can be a blessing to others don't matter if they are saved or not but you can be a blessing yes because that's who this royal family is amen a life of service a life of blessing yes now what kind of a life is this it's a life of Faith but we know that faith is a revelation so it's a life of Revelation and the fullness of Revelation like we just said only came at the end time because in the evening time it shall be light amen amen this is not a partial light amen but the full strength of the sunlight the son light is shining in its brilliance now some of you do not feel that way this morning but I'm preaching you into a condition I am preaching you into an atmosphere this morning amen the Brilliance of the sunlight is shining in our lives amen amen and this is the hour that Jesus Christ was waiting for the culmination of all things that Jesus had in his mind amen he paid the price for our Redemption on Calvary and he opened up the way for us to come back to our original position and our Authority now we are we are to be a people who are called by his name and he called us and he said I'll baptize you into my name he said I'll baptize you into my body you people who know me I'm gonna tell you now be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and then we go and believe that like Peter on the day of Pentecost and we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so he's baptizing us into the body of Christ amen there is no other formula for baptism you must if you want to be in the body of Christ you must come by this formula be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins so what if I was baptized in titles then you have no remission of your sins strong statement I'll say it again if you were baptized in titles you have no remission of your sins and it says and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen not initial evidence that's what they have settled for but you shall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost amen and when the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall be endured with power come on high am many many men amen and a people that have been called by his name baptized in his name amen now we are all Royal members of the family of Christ listen to what he says you must find yourself a good church a place a church of your choice and there be a royal member of the family of Christ until death sets you free hello isn't that what we are doing now let me read it again some people when they read they read like this you must find yourself a church hop around skip around find a church that suits your itching year hey and there be a Troublesome person in the family of Christ until death sets them free [Music] because really death will set them free from your Troublesome ways but let's read it again you must find yourself in good church a place of your choice how many fear by force did I ever cut the password only ever come to you put a gun to your head and say you need to stay here in church of your choice and there be a royal member of the family of Christ until death sets you free now we know that we are a different people now if you know that being called to Royal life requires you to carry yourself in a certain way yes amen amen you can't dress anyhow you can't carry yourself anyhow that makes sense why dressing was a big part of the message [Music] because you're a royal Queen Hallelujah that's right clothed right Royal apparel you won't find Cape Middleton or the what's this queen concert Camilla dressed anyhow they have the best fashion designers so do we have best fashion designers Hallelujah wait till you get to heaven the prophet says he saw the women diamonds flowing in the Wind you know that perfect picture you always wanted girls wear your dress is just flowing in the wind and flowing the prophet saw you that way hey you know that one where the fan is blowing and the hair is going like that it's your perfect moments [Music] and you won't have bad photographers there you won't be scrolling the photographer that you took a bad picture of me because there'll be no more bad pictures you'll be in the Brilliance of your youth you know some people when they take a picture it's only on this side this is my good sign but then all sides will be good amen you're going back to Brilliance of Youth amen so when you're called to a royal life you are called to a higher order now when you are called to a royal life it means that everything that you have need of will be taken care of the household of the royal King and live a life of squalor and a life of poverty amen now I'm not preaching Prosperity this morning right but yes I am I am telling you that in the king's Palace every need of you should be taking care of you I'm talking about your spiritual prosperity we cannot sulk in the house you know how sometimes the children are when they're angry with you now the KFC is lying there and the Nando's is lying there but because they're angry with you now you're telling them to come eat he said no I'm not hungry but they're starving they're just waiting for you to change the atmosphere a little once the atmosphere changes a little and you watch how the thing is gone before you can see Jack Robinson if you think that Houdini Can Do Magic put food in front of a hungry amen so we are we are peculiar people the Bible says that we are a royal priesthood now what is a priesthood a priesthood offers spiritual sacrifice unto the Lord everybody agreed offering spiritual sacrifices unto the Lord so now you are a royal priesthood a holy nation and the prophet will tell us that our hearts are to Peter's one and what is flowing through the veins if our heart is beating us one what is the heart the heart is a blood pump blood so what blood is flowing through our veins it's the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ amen he says Royal Blood of Jesus Christ is flowing through our veins by faith amen and not only do we have the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ flowing through our blood we have a rich Royal holy oil of God this Rich Royal holy oil of God is the Holy Spirit and it's the bomb needed in this time amen it's the bomb that can minister to people Nations tribes tongues Kings they all need this bomb at the moment in fact the world is crying out for this bomb this healing bomb to be poured out upon them amen I want to declare this morning that we have the solution to the world's problems we have the solution to the economic crisis we have the solution to the political crisis we have the solution to the religious crisis we have the answer amen the bride has been prophesying about the answer it's an age-old answer in fact the disciples spoke about this answer amen and once amen they tried it's a tried answer they tried him they tested him he was tested at all points and the most the person with the most Authority in that day said I find no fault in him in this answer that you are providing I find no fault in him amen amen it's a tried answer it's a tested answer we are not guessing when we say that we have a solution to the world's problems amen but we have the solution and while the world is looking for their Superman and their Superman is getting ready to step in on the scene we have already had our Superman he was a God man amen you may ask who I'm talking about I'm talking about the one who was born in a manger 2 000 years ago he came as a little baby crying in a Manger and the Bible says he grew in the stature and in the spirit of the of the Lord amen hallelujah oh hallelujah amen back then the political system the religious system rejected the answer but he is still the answer I'm talking about j e s u s his name is Jesus amen hallelujah not just Jesus because in Mexico and in the Spanish countries there are many jesuses but I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Jesus amen I'm talking about the lily of the valley I'm talking about the bright and The Morning Star I'm talking about the wonderful counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God amen amen I'm talking about the one who told John I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last I'm talking about King Jesus amen hallelujah I'm talking about the one who told us I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and at the keys of hell and death I am talking about the King of Kings I'm talking about the Lord of lords I'm talking about the one amen who has raised up so high that Heavens cannot contain him amen hallelujah the expanse of the universe cannot contain I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ give this king of King a mighty anthem of Grace because he is worthy of it amen amen amen the prophet says here that this King of Kings now and this Lord of Lord the one that was raised above every principality and every Power is now in a church elect so high that Heavens cannot contain him yet he chooses to live in you and me and that's the god in Simplicity Hallelujah to mystery to the world he says he's in the church the church he let the called out Abraham said by the Royal promise you should be able to pick me up now with the Caleb in uh Revelation chapter five paragraph 164. let's just read about this one we are boasting about this morning you don't mind we talk about a little bit about Jesus amen you don't mind we brag about the King of Kings he says as the son of Abraham is heir to the Royal Grant that's right he's heir to the Royal Grant he's describing what the Royal branch is now he says Palestine and all that China what is he meaning Israel and all that's inner now he's talking about a natural land how much more the spiritual land how much more spiritual Israel he says amen Abraham's seed he was the son of Abraham he says what did man lose he lost the Earth so as son of man is heir to everything in the Earth amen oh awakened to it son of man revealed Ministries this morning and son of man he is heir to everything Amen on the Earth it's no wonder it's no coincidence that you are seated here this morning under a church that is called son of man revealed Ministries because you are Heir over everything on the Earth amen he says all this is God and he has given back to us what a husband what a husband Hallelujah is give it back to us then he's returning back as he was now here he goes on to describe a few more titles he says now then as Son of God he inherits all things let me just drop this here before I go on Queen is called air yes okay let's go you got it a Son of God he never saw things man so as I'm saying that in your head I want you to say how fulfilled his mind okay if you want us to chant it we will chanting a Son of God is here of all things son of David is heir to the throne amen who he promised to sit on your store he's here to the throne son of Abraham is heir to the Royal branch son of man is the heir to the Earth Son of God is heir to all things in Heaven and Earth amen yeah oh my that's Our Redeemer our kinsman redeemer amen amen amen now any King we're just going to backtrack a little bit from our first sermon any King would be proud to have his wife take on his name yes now here in the message the second coming of Christ is it that message or the Philadelphia Church age The Profit now let's just break this down let's read it in its entirety we'll understand it we'll enjoy it too what's the name of God Jesus he said in Heaven and Earth all is named Jesus now you're going to a scripture and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which comes down out of Heaven from my God I'll put oh if you see it's all the same name you should have caught it and put on him the name of the city of my God the city he goes ahead and say which is New Jerusalem right he says the New Jerusalem I'll put on him the New Jerusalem now the Bride of the church is New Jerusalem how many knows that the church itself is the New Jerusalem you believe that he says let's prove it Revelation 21 I think it is that's they're what I want let's look back here we can show you the Bible says prove all things and he says I saw a new heavens and a new Earth for the first heaven and first Earth was passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband now men quickly go back to the day you got married and then you saw your beautiful wife coming dressed he says she this new city coming down from heaven is prepared the same way you remember guys your best man had to get your eyes back from the floor because your eyes fell down and put it back you remember guys how you were crying when you're crying my wife says I was crying hey when you see this beautiful bride approaching you amen some of you forgot how to be romantic you don't know what I'm talking about amen so he says here where was I okay and prepared as a bride a dawn for husband he says the new church is the Gentile church is the bride the Bride is a gentile and the Gentile has his name amen he took people out of the Gentile for his name's sake amen you believe that if you don't believe he says turn to acts 15 verse 14. and then he's going to read there right he's going to read now men and Brethren arcanon to me Simeon had declared out God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name how if you're following me amen brother Branham asked the question what is the name of God right and he said he's reading now Revelation where he says I'll put my name in that City yes right my name in that City so he's breaking that down now so then he took export acts 15 and he's showing you that he's taking a people for his name right and he says I will write upon in the name of my God and the name of the city of my God so he says all that names it's not different names of God he says which is all the same Jesus Jesus Jesus and this is where now we're going to clarify what the prophet is saying because some people don't believe that we are married to Jesus and he says and the bride married to Jesus makes it Mrs Jesus amen amen right there's some mighty fine woman in the building tonight mighty fine but there's one of them that's mine she's got my name I hope you got that she's wearing my name so will his bride so he just baffles the mind that they wouldn't want his name he says now in a message second coming of Christ just to in the mouth of two of three Witnesses let every word be established to show he's just not an isolated quote he says we are not only engaged but we are married the church is married to Christ we are the wife of Christ who are Barren and unfruitful he says we are the wife of Christ bringing fourth children he says that when the woman Church is married to Christ they are no longer two they are one Christ in you his life has been brought into you then you become the bride so you see taking his name is one part but then he comes into a union with you to put his seed word in you and then you bring forth that same word Christ is not just only the written word otherwise why would the bible say that the little killer if you have been following closely the message of the hour you'll know that Christ is always the manifested word he is a prison God amen that's why it's important for you to catch the revelation of the hour see who you are in the world then you become the manifested word other than that we'll be like the lutherans the methodists the Baptists the anglicans just reading from the book but when we say we are married to Christ the word what we are really saying is that we are the manifested word Christ is now manifested through us don't just we're not just talking about a Bible from Genesis to revelation we are talking about a god who's living in the people in fact every day you are writing another book another chapter another page amen now he goes on here in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says if you are married to Christ Christ is the word of God that's what we just tried to explain right let's go to Galatians 3 12. amen I'd like to read the Bible as well amen for young people let's just see in our Galatians chapter 12 3 and verse 12. you know if you add somebody who was living the life of a queen what's the first question you were probably ask him is what's it like living in the palace living under Royal household but now you are the person that people can ask the question to because you are living in this Royal life and remember the purpose of the preaching this morning is that if you are not living in this condition in this level under Royal conditions we invite you to come in and stand here Amen to come up a little higher now let's read verse 12. so now he's talking about the law and how we cannot be perfected by the law what is the law of the Ten Commandments right men in its Fallen nature could never keep the Ten Commandments therefore God instituted the sacrifice if man in his own human ability could keep the Ten Commandments there would be no need for the sacrifice but because man was failing to keep the law there needed to be an atonement made you know right so he says the law is not a faith because the law can never produce faith how can you afraid in your flesh when you know your flesh will fail the law he says the law is not a faith but the man that Drew them shall live in them if you want to keep the law you've got to live by the law and you'll also die by the law right that's what he's trying to express then he says but Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Lord whoa you mean God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and and that the Jews consider the sacred texts and now this who is this Apostle calling him cursed remember he's laying the foundation he's saying the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree so he became a curse for us that now what this is what we are getting to remember we are talking about the Royal life and blessings so we are saying all that the blessings of Abraham listen to what he says why did he do this that The Blessing of Abraham might come unto the Gentiles to Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith so we have the blessings of Abraham in fact I want you to consider this point if the Jews who have rejected Christ are prospering and thriving under the law they have not accepted Jesus right so they are still under the law if the Jews are excelling to such a level under the law how much more spiritual Jews amen under grace the Jews I really bless people you don't know how much of wealth the Jews have actually go and search it out you'll see the Jews are a prosperous Nation not only are they blessed the land is blessed to look at the technology coming out of Israel they are prospering in a desert Land look at the water how they are able to produce water their vegetation and farming you heard of the kaboots amen they have crops that are growing in that once was a desolate place but that's what he's trying to express here and tell us that if they receive this under a natural law how much more glorious should we be living in Christ we should be living a royal life of blessing do not live under god-given privileges speak the word and go forth amen I tell you the authority and the power lies in the power of your tongue amen amen amen and too many times we are just professing negativity but I want you to have a positive confession I want you to go forth in faith and over every situation proclaim the name of the Lord over every circumstance proclaim the name of the Lord amen if you see a dry and a a man a deserted place I want you to speak the name of the Lord over that if Fitness is a drive and deserted place in your life I want you to speak the name of the Lord over that why he says because we have received the promise of the spirit through faith now watch what he says no greater blessing than the spirit which is God in you is that in the Bible hello he's saying there can be no greater blessing oh how grateful we are to have the holy spirit amen no greater blessing amen then the spirit of God which is in US amen hallelujah amen we have the source of all blessings we are not satisfied with blessings alone amen we can say without a shadow of doubt that we have The Giver of the blessings amen amen now he says here for you are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you has been baptized into Christ have put on Christ watches breaking it down now we've just been through it but here it is in the Bible he's showing you how you've come through the stages you were baptized into Christ have put on Christ he says therefore there is no Jew no Greek no Bundle free male or female for you are all one in Christ Jesus now he reiterates this if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise amen let's just leave that for them we go to I'll turn our Focus now to Isaiah chapter 6 and verse 2. we know amen this will speak quite a lot to know pastoran he should take this quite a bit amen Hosea 6 and 2 he says after two days he will he revive us in the third you will raise us up and we shall live in his sight so there is coming a promised Revival amen you'll find the propheties breaking into this down in recognizing your day and its message I don't have the poacher you can go and read it way is breaking the scripture down and he's showing you that after two days right you know each day times a thousand years after two thousand years there is coming a promised Revival now this revival it's a resurrection it says in the third day so remember after two days is the third day everyone agreed after two days you'll revive us in the third day he raised us up and we shall live in his sight so then he's breaking down showing you how six trumpets have sounded driven him to the Homeland waiting for that seven trumpet okay and then he tells you the bride must be taken out of the way now so that Moses and Elijah can speak to them right now we want to go to verse 3 as well then he says then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord he is going forth prepared as the morning oh what a glorious thing two scriptures come to mind there's joy in the morning right what comes in the morning Joy also his mercies and you every morning so he is coming as the morning he is coming with joy he is coming with Mercy [Music] and he shall come unto us as the rain oh Hallelujah if you are not Farmers you don't know the value of brain amen but he is coming to us as the rain now there are two types of rain there is the latter rain and the former rain unto the Earth now the former reign you would know is the one that comes at springtime what is that to water the seed everybody following the first ring is to water the sea but then there is coming a lettering what is rain the province is teaching rain now you know when the prophet was coming with this teaching Reign why they went to him and said brother Graham you have such an anointed gift of healing why are you confusing the people and teaching but he was coming with a letter in the teaching ring amen so he says he is going for prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and the former Reign unto the Earth and I want to tell you that this bride has had both Reigns amen therefore she is living a prosperous life and she is bringing forth the fruit of Christ is because she has had the teaching Reign she has had both the former and the lettering amen and two days has passed and we are living in the third day amen and we are bound to be resurrected in the third day because that's what the scripture says amen how many of you are looking forward to the resurrection and the changing of the body amen when we shall be caught up in the moment in the twinkling of an eye let's go to Esther chapter 5 and verse 1. talking about the life of a royal Queen amen it says here it came to pass on what day why did I read Hosea to get to this amen you should know I don't read things without going to something when was he going to revive us bring us back to life what day hello everybody said third day when is Esther coming now it came to pass on what day the third day that Esther put on a royal apparel and stood in the inner Court of the king not in the outer Court this is the age of the inner Court Hallelujah now I tell you people will read right over those things but the spirit of God is here this morning to I like those things amen I'm telling you that because I only said that right now amen put on a royal apparel and stood in the inner Court of the King's house over against the King's house and the King set on his Royal Throne I like how they use the word Royal for everything here because that's how you must live your life you don't just say Amen you give a royal amen you don't just say hallelujah you give a royal Hallelujah can I hear it this morning amen you know many other women can call your husband but when you call him sweetest note in serif song there's no one can see his name like you now his name is not him no one because he knows when you say hey he's in trouble right but listen now he says here Royal Throne Royal house over against the Gate of the house and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court did she obtain fever in his sight and the King held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand what was in this one that was standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks what was his hand hello students of the word what was the one standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks what was in his hand Seven Stars which people on the face of the Earth have a revelation of those Seven Stars amen where can you find that revelation only in the message of the hour so did he stretch forth his hand over you and give you Seven Stars reveal all their names Esther Junior and touched the top of the septum then said the king unto her now I want you now before I read this I want you to know he is not informing of a privileges but he is reminding us when he is asking at this now he is not that now you are able to ask and do this he is reminding her of her position in the Kingdom let's read what will come Queen Esther you see how it refers to you amen what will down Queen Esther yes what is thy request name you see if you ask anything in my name amen it shall be given didn't the real king of King say that it shall be given given thee to half the kingdom half of it is mine he is reminding her of a position in the Kingdom what will thou Esther what is your request it shall be given thee to half the kingdom of the Kingdom that's where we're going to stop there in that story because we've got to go to Ephesians 1 and verse 13. we have a lot of scriptures to cover this morning Ephesians 1 verse 3 sorry Ephesians 1 and 3 says now let's look at some of our blessings blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ in verse 10 he says now I want you to know that the dispensation of the fullness of time if we have time some other time we'll show you the quotes that is the seventh seal the fullness of time right so remember the fullness of time is the seventh seal I can remember I can jog your memory quickly remember he says it's the end of all things end of the struggling world end of nature he says it's even the ushering in of the Millennium so he says it's the fullness of time so this he says if we read it another way that under the seventh seal he might gather together in one all things in Christ does he gather everything under the seventh seal both which are in heaven which on Earth even in him is that us come read now with understanding where is the bride in that day you shall know as I am in the Father the father in me I knew you in me even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance there's a point on again we have an inheritance you ask what's the inheritance let's get to The Inheritance verse 13. you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance now it's not the fullness of our inheritance it's the down payment of our inheritance right we have an Earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased position which he wrote In Christ when he raised him up from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places now the reason we're going into this I want you again to recognize half of it is yours far above principalities so principality should you shouldn't have a problem with principalities and Powers he raised him above principalities so you can conquer principalities right power half of it is yours might Dominion every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come amen and he had put all things under his feet if it's under his feet it's under your feet and gave him to be held over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that fill it all in all digest that ponder that the fullness of him is you that fill it all in all now Paul is really giving meat there but we don't have time to dwell on that Ephesians 2 and verse 4. talking about now more of our inheritance more of our blessings God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherever he loved us even when we were dead in sins had quickened us together with Christ and it raised us up together to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ I pray that the spirit just quickened that to you now because we just read how Jesus was raised into Heavenly places and now Paul is telling us that we sit together in Heavenly places showing that you are co-ab you are queen right that that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel strangers from the Covenant or promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus you were sometimes were far off a maid nigh by the blood of Christ oh church I don't have time to really dwell on this but I want you to go and you know sometimes when you got to soak something you know when you have to soak your rice or marinate your meat because you want it to become tender read that scripture again because the blood wasn't only for salvation listen to what he's saying there now in Christ you were sometimes far off I made nigh by the blood of Jesus you are brought into the Royal household by the blood of Jesus you are living a royal life because of the blood of Jesus you have the blessings of healing Deliverance salvation because of the blood of Jesus see he says here for he is our peace who had made both one and had broken down the middle wall of petition let's bring this to a close now for two thousand years of church history God has been building his bride for such a time as this time this is the season this is the hour that all creation all seven Church ages I've been waiting for in a play in a flim in a drama everyone is waiting for the climax the tension is being built up during the previous scenes and everyone is waiting to see how it's all gonna end especially in a thriller you don't know how it's going to end now the fate of the world ends in a balance the shift a play for power Satan's about to make his greatest move for the control of the world in the greatest battle ever fought so we are now living in the climax of things and in the climax is when all things will be revealed what they proved there for seven Church ages the prophecies they tied some loose ends but they also missed some loose ends and and through the colors are some loose ends that he said the just shall live by faith and he tied there amen and was recorded another loose end and he said sanctification by the blood of Jesus amen this is a spirit are pouring caught another loose him and they receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit but they never stayed to receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit amen but what was the Holy Ghost doing it was walking through the scenes bringing us to the climax I want you to know the Azusa Street outpouring was not the climax under the first pool it wasn't the climax it was the scene being built up if I could type those pulls it's like Hosea 6 said after two days I will revive you and I will raise you up again after two calls the Revival came under the third pool amen amen Hallelujah the climax came on the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mighty Angel crying with a loud voice and the sounding of seven Thunders amen now I want you to not grow weary with the climax don't grow weary with the climax we are almost at the End Amen amen we should be sledding at the climax amen because all things are ready now in fact the voice is about to ready to be cried with the angels lifting up his hand to heaven to say that time shall be no more amen you remember the time the prophet was going to watch that show and he says the voice came on of a sudden and he said Let the Fire Fall the fire is about to fall over this Legacy and church age and all is ungodliness amen everything is falling into place all that was prophesied about this bride has come to pass I want you to know that everything that brother Branham spoke about you all that the prophets had prophesied about you has come to pass amen amen you are that super race you are the Invincible Army you are the word pride amen you are born of his bone you are flesh of his flesh you are Spirit of his Spirit you are life of his life amen in fact you are him you are Christ in being made flesh to the world Amen you are the final voice to the final age you are in the image and Relentless of Christ you are at the true seed word within you amen and you are reproducing The Life of Christ amen that's who you are amen I want you to know and lift yourself to this elevated position this morning amen you are the one amen that what amen Satan's answer you are the answer to Satan's question yes is there one Worthy on the Earth because remember this is coming fresh now in Heaven There was a sound a voice who is worthy to take the book now that the angel so who was worthy in heaven only Jesus Christ the King of Kings come on now this is coming fresh better catch on to it now when the book is brought down to the Earth the angel is standing there with the open book on his hand and there's a cry going out who is worthy to pick the book and only John the bride the queen of Queens can go to the Angel's hand and take the book amen because she's the life of his life Spirit of his Spirit the word of his word give God praise this morning I know amen many many men Hallelujah all that was prophesied about this bride has come to pass amen this is the time amen there was a time for the Reformation this is not the time for reformation amen the Reformation is over that was not the climax but we were promised a restoration message Elijah the prophet was sent to us like a Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 promised amen he came before The Great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he turned our heart one heart back to the feet of the fathers so where we are are we at church the ministry has come to its fruition now man this ride is fully equipped and ready for action she's ready for war amen we can't be in the message for 40 years sympathizing with the message not showing any fruit but I have to tell you this Bride is a powerful church this Bride is a powerful Army amen hallelujah amen we can't be in the message and our hearts have not been turned back something's wrong but we are in the season this is a season of fully mature Believers say Amen somebody you are the fully matured Believers that I'm talking about this is the time for the latter rain are pouring of the spirit this is a season and a time for the operating of the word amen amen this is a time when the world must be in full operation the opening of the word all Seven Seals were torn open and the Mysteries have been revealed the pride is not left wondering neither is she confused about what was revealed some people say the Mysteries were revealed but they sit and wonder and they are all buggered up in their minds but this bride knows exactly what was revealed amen amen hallelujah it was revealed in a language that only she understands Hallelujah to the rest of them it sounds Greek amen hallelujah it was revealed in a language that only she understands only the father's spiritual Gene understands this encoded language amen it came with an encryption an encrypted message that only those that are the key to the kingdom what is the key to the kingdom come on now Church Peter was given the key to the kingdom what is that revelation so the message came with an encrypted with an encryption and only those with a key only those with Revelation can unlock this encrypted coded message amen what is this message so sacred why is it coming in in every language because it's to produce the greatest victory of victory that was given to Jesus Christ when he rose triumphant from the grave and he stepped into his glorified party amen it's a victory that's going to be given to the people on the face of the Earth one like what Enoch had amen what is it it's a message for a party change it's a message to give you rapturing Faith amen it's a message that the heart has never heard about before amen give God praise for this kind of message amen hallelujah the Earth has never heard this kind of message want to give a rapturing faith want to change the very atoms in your body amen hallelujah only the father spiritual genes understand this encoded language because the pride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he once done with the word the pride has thus save the Lord so what does that mean every move a reaction every step is in line with the word of God she has thus said the Lord or she keeps still amen yeah she has both mechanics and Dynamics amen this is a message that's calling us to perfection we don't want a partial message to make us better better won't cut it we want perfect amen amen we want Perfection we want our faith to be perfected we want our virtue to be perfected we want our technology to be provided perfected we want our Temperance our patience our godliness our brotherly kindness to be perfected and we want our charity to be perfect what did the Apostle Paul tell us in First Corinthians chapter 13 because love charity never fails where there's prophecy is they shall fail hello yeah yeah so prophecies is good but they shall fail sounds familiar believe the sign whether there be times they shall cease sounds familiar where they be knowledge it shall vanish away foreign [Music] amen didn't we just say we want to affection when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when that which is perfect amen has come this day amen amen amen the message of the hour brought Perfection to the bride the message can perfect you but we've got to come in this life of in this Royal household and live a life of Royal blessings Amen to be a part of the kingdom of God we've got a perfect word to give us perfect Faith preparing us for a perfect rapture amen preparation time is over we're waiting for the coming of the Lord to change these wild bodies there was a time to have the wedding garment and get dressed and ready there was a time for that that woman was given the promise to wait outside for The Chariot she couldn't wait for the Cherry to sound first and then run into the house to get ready amen you can't be getting dressed while the Heavenly chariots are swinging low [Music] when the train is coming it's not time to eat peanuts that's flashing red light you know that the bride is waiting with the faith in our hearts to change the physical atoms in our body she's going to defy gravity that which held in this three-dimensional world is going to let loose one of these days and she is going to burst forth from these dimensions and move past that sixth Dimension right into the seven Dimension to be seated with Christ on his throne that is why David said will we leap over walls will we change dimensions listen to what the prophet says now don't fear John dear little flock all that I am you are heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I want you to hear the voice of that Mighty Angel right now and put it present tense you are here to my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant it can never failure I'm letting that settle me somebody needs that this morning listen to what he's telling you living a life a royal life and partaking of his Royal blessings this is his word to you this morning all that I am you are here to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant it can never fail Ure we're going to close with two portions of scripture let's turn to it in Revelation chapter 19. the reason why I want to end with this is we read in the Bible how God promised blessings to Abraham we read how he promised blessings to Jacob Isaac we read many places and sometimes we we sit and we think wow God personally made a promise to him can you imagine God almighty physically coming down and making a promise to those people and keeping that promise so is there a portion in the world that's not claimed but it's directed to the bride but just like how we picked up Revelation 10 8 to 11 and said that's ours somebody needs to go and take this promise and recognized where a blessing lies everyone following my thoughts I'm saying there's portions of scriptures two portions right now that only you as the bride living in this Royal life and blessings can go and pick up let's read it Revelation chapter 19 and verse six let's start from there I heard as you were the voice of a great multitude the voice of many waters you know that's a fightful Ministry voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent brainer let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready amen and to her was granted to be a raid in fine living when was Esther done third day clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints now watch the the one that is speaking to that is making these statements is now turning his attention to John the same one in Revelation 10 verse 8 where we say we are everyone following me amen he's now speaking a word directly to the bride and he's going to bless you he's going to give a blessing bless are they which are called unto the married supper of the Lamb amen amen there's a blessing now in Revelation to them that are called did you even call you behold the private group coming amen going out to meet him who cried that out William Branham so he's telling I want you to know that William Branham speaking here now let's follow it because if you go and read further down John wants to now bow before the same show right and he says don't do it John yes but watch I want you to catch this alone if you catch nothing else you are blessed because you are called to the marriage of the Lamb amen [Music] and he said unto me these are the true Sins Of God what is that that's another way of saying thus save the Lord bless that they were called to the merits of the Lamb thus saith the Lord [Music] let's turn to revelation 22 verse 6. Another Blessing so there's a people that are called to the married couple of the Lamb then here's another blessing he said unto me these are the faithful and true and the Lord God of the holy prophet sent his Angel to show unto his servants of things which must shortly be done behold now this is the Lord Jesus speaking behold I come quickly and what is now attaching and blessing again blessed are is he that keepeth the sins of the prophecy of this book foreign let's break that down you are blessed with your call to the married supper and you are blessed if you keep the prophecy of this book yes there's only one people on the Earth that's called to the marriage that's you yes and there's only one people in the entire Earth that's keeping the prophecy of this book amen so you have a double portion listen yeah a double portion anointing give God praise yeah so he's saying to keep the sayings of the prophecy of this book then one must be able to understand the prophecy of this book right if you have to keep the prophecy of the book you must understand the prophecy of the book now in order to understand it I'm closing now the prophet says you have to get into the spirit of the composer to understand the prophecy so one must what have what prophetic insight and one must have the spirit of Prophecy which is the testimony of Jesus I'm going to close with this quote it's going to take the operation of the Holy Spirit that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people amen you know in school when they told you must go to special class now you are in special class that time it was a bad thing now it's a good thing anyone ask me where you may say I go to special class it's for a special class of people I need to take one or prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God so only you have the year to hear what the spirit is saying to the church this morning amen so the life of a Believer is really a royal life and it's one filled with blessings you are called to the marriage of the lamb and you are keeping the sayings of the prophecy of this book and you are doubly blessed queen of Greece maintain your title maintain your position stand steady you know in the time of War they say hold the line hold hold because now the battle is tense should we break should we retreat Hold the Line steady the defense keep marching
