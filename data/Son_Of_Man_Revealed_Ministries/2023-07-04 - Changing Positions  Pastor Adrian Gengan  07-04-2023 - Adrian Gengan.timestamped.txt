[0:57] sick in body Lord Jesus trusting you we
[1:00] depending on you right now we commit the
[1:02] service into your hands in the mighty
[1:04] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:08] amen amen I greet you all in the
[1:10] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:11] Jesus Christ am amen what a beautiful
[1:14] day to come into the house of the Lord
[1:16] and worship Him amen hallelujah amen

[1:23] house of the Lord praise the
[1:28] Lord
[1:31] amen we under expectation this morning
[1:35] Hallelujah you know when he shows up
[1:38] that's all that matters amen amen
[1:40] anything can happen when he shows up yes
[1:42] so I ask you to be sensitive to the holy
[1:44] spirit because when the angel of God is
[1:47] moving the anointing is strong in the
[1:49] service that's the time to speak amen
[1:52] amen hallelujah that's a time to speak
[1:54] your need yes amen and how many of you
[1:58] know that in order for you to show that
[2:00] you are agreeing with the word of God
[2:01] you've got to say amen amen amen amen is
[2:05] actually telling you that you are
[2:06] actually believing that word the word
[2:09] that you are hearing amen I know a lot
[2:11] of preachers say they Don't Preach for
[2:13] amens I'm preaching for amens amen
[2:16] because my job is to make sure you agree
[2:18] with the word of God Amen so if you
[2:20] don't say amen I know you're not
[2:21] agreeing with the word of God then my
[2:24] brother soan are going to be visiting
[2:25] you why don't you agree with the word of
[2:27] God Amen and saying man is scriptural
[2:31] Hallelujah you know in the book of
[2:33] Nehemiah when you read there you'll see
[2:35] when Nehemiah rebuilt the walls and he
[2:37] was reading the scriptures the Bible
[2:38] clearly states and all the people said
[2:41] amen so saying amen is scriptural the
[2:45] prophet says that the Holy Ghost within
[2:48] you will punctuate every word of God
[2:51] with an amen amen amen hallelujah so you
[2:54] see I'm prepping you up for your amens
[2:56] praise the Lord hallelujah so we also
[2:58] want to wish our sister Victory a happy
[3:00] birthday amen that the Lord will
[3:02] continue to be with her bless her keep
[3:05] her by his grace amen sister continue to
[3:07] be faithful serving the lord Amen in The
[3:10] Fellowship of the Lord amen and the Lord
[3:12] who is your portion and strength will
[3:14] see you through amen when we get to
[3:16] these ages it's the grace of God amen
[3:20] amen and we ought not to take it lightly
[3:22] so we appreciate our sister who
[3:23] appreciate our sister let's give a hand
[3:25] amen praise the Lord many years being
[3:27] faithful in the house of the Lord
[3:29] serving him never wavering through all
[3:31] the trials the amen situation she's been
[3:34] through but she still remains faithful
[3:36] to the Lord amen hallelujah praise the
[3:39] Lord amen so we'll turn to our Bible
[3:42] this morning Ephesians chapter
[3:46] 1 amen for a little title we'll take a
[3:49] title called changing positions amen
[3:53] changing positions amen amen praise the
[3:56] Lord so in Ephesians chapter 1
[4:10] amen Ephesians chapter
[4:13] 1 from verse three says blessed be the
[4:17] God and father of our Lord Jesus
[4:21] Christ who hath past
[4:24] tense blessed us with all spiritual
[4:28] blessings amen in Heavenly places in
[4:32] Christ amen so that is our
[4:35] position Heavenly places in Christ is
[4:38] the believer's
[4:40] position okay and that you come you can
[4:44] see here he had chosen us before the
[4:46] foundation of the world that's what the
[4:48] Bible goes on to say there and he had
[4:50] predestinated us unto adoption of
[4:52] children but my point to emphasize there
[4:55] is blessed be the God and father of our
[4:57] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[5:00] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[5:03] places in Christ amen so if you want to
[5:07] access spiritual blessings you've got to
[5:10] be in Christ amen and then we'll go to
[5:13] Luke
[5:14] Chapter it's Luke chapter
[5:23] 1 you can read from verse 46 amen praise
[5:27] the
[5:28] Lord so we believe that we are another
[5:31] Mary in this time so we reading a
[5:34] portion where the alpha Mary was being
[5:37] was speaking right and Mary said my soul
[5:40] do magnify the
[5:43] Lord and my spirit at rejoiced in God my
[5:47] savior amen for he had regarded the
[5:50] lowest state of his handmaiden for
[5:52] behold from H forth all generation shall
[5:56] call me blessed amen
[6:00] amen prophesy over yourself amen when
[6:04] the word comes to you prophesy over
[6:06] yourself prophesy over your family why
[6:10] you've got the word of God you've
[6:12] connected with the angel of God you can
[6:14] now speak with authority and prophesy
[6:17] over your life
[6:19] hallelujah amen the Lord had blessings
[6:21] to the reading of his word you may be
[6:22] seated so what was Mary rejoicing about
[6:26] the angel had come to change your
[6:28] position she says he has regarded my
[6:32] lowest
[6:33] state but the angel
[6:36] said blessed are you amongst all women
[6:39] amen amen what was he doing changing her
[6:42] position yes amen amen praise the
[6:49] Lord so we find that being in Heavenly
[6:52] places in Christ is an elevated position
[6:56] amen amen yes this is no ordinary
[6:58] position yes
[7:00] it's selected for a specific class of
[7:02] people
[7:04] amen and it's a glorious
[7:07] position it's a glorious position to be
[7:10] in amen now you know in life you may
[7:13] attain a certain position maybe you want
[7:15] to be a manager director or something
[7:17] like that you want to attain the highest
[7:19] position I am saying Christ has given
[7:22] you the highest position that he could
[7:23] give anybody
[7:26] amen it's a glorious position am now you
[7:29] and I can't live higher than our
[7:33] thoughts we live according to our
[7:35] thoughts the type of life we live the
[7:38] kind of home we live the kind of car we
[7:40] drive is all according to our
[7:43] thoughts amen you can't live higher than
[7:47] your revelation of the
[7:49] word amen that is why the prophet is
[7:52] saying you can't live higher than your
[7:54] pastor because he's the one feeding you
[7:57] so you can't live higher than his
[7:58] revelation so you can't live higher than
[8:01] your revelation of the
[8:02] word if you want to change your life
[8:05] you've got to change your thoughts amen
[8:07] amen yes amen you've got to change your
[8:12] thoughts amen if you want to live in the
[8:15] higher Realms where of spir the
[8:17] spiritual realm in Christ you must think
[8:20] higher thoughts amen yes didn't the God
[8:23] say my ways are higher than your ways my
[8:26] thoughts in Isaiah 55 if you want to
[8:27] take it down yeah let's read it let's
[8:29] see what the word of the Lord is saying
[8:32] here seek ye the Lord while he may be
[8:36] found amen call ye upon him while he is
[8:39] near
[8:41] Amen Let The Wicked forsake his way and
[8:45] the unrighteous man his thoughts amen
[8:48] and let him return unto the Lord and He
[8:51] will have mercy upon Him amen maybe
[8:53] you're sitting here and you had your own
[8:55] thoughts doing your own things the Lord
[8:56] is calling you to return to his thoughts
[8:58] amen
[9:01] amen oh thank you Lord and to our God
[9:04] for why he will aband abundantly pardon
[9:08] amen amen doesn't that sound like the
[9:10] prodical son father amen he will
[9:13] abundantly
[9:14] pardon for my thoughts are not your
[9:17] thoughts neither are my ways neither are
[9:21] your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as
[9:24] the heavens are higher than the earth so
[9:27] are my ways higher than your ways and my
[9:30] thoughts than your
[9:33] thoughts now watch if you think his
[9:36] thoughts Watch What Happens for as the
[9:39] rain cometh down and as the snow from
[9:42] Heaven return not tother but WTH the
[9:44] Earth and bring it forth and Bud that it
[9:48] may give seed to the S and bread to the
[9:51] eater so your life is going to be
[9:53] abundantly blessed thank you if you pull
[9:56] down the thoughts of God thank you Lord
[9:59] amen amen and I want you to know the
[10:01] thoughts of God is the mind of Christ
[10:03] and the bride has the mind of Christ so
[10:06] this bride is abundantly blessed amen
[10:09] than you
[10:10] amen so he goes on to say
[10:14] now so shall my word be that goeth forth
[10:18] out of my mouth what word is this the
[10:22] thoughts because the word is a thought
[10:24] expressed am so the word that is coming
[10:26] out of his mouth shall not return unto
[10:29] me void I ask you if you have the mind
[10:33] of Christ and the thoughts of God what
[10:35] words are coming out of your mouth it's
[10:37] got to be the word of God so that word
[10:39] can't return void can somebody say
[10:42] amen hallelujah so you are beginning to
[10:45] speak the word of
[10:47] God Amen so it won't return void but it
[10:51] shall accomplish that which I please and
[10:54] it shall
[10:55] prosper Amen in the thing where to I
[10:58] sent it
[10:59] send your word forth that word must
[11:02] Prosper that word can't return void amen
[11:06] amen for you shall go out with joyah
[11:09] after you speak the mind of God you
[11:11] shall go out with joy and be led forth
[11:14] with peace Shalom amen and the mountains
[11:17] and the hills shall Break Forth before
[11:19] you into
[11:20] singing you see all your whole entire
[11:23] life is blessed and all the trees of the
[11:26] field shall clap their hands instead of
[11:28] the born shall come forth shall come up
[11:31] the F
[11:34] tree and instead of the Brier shall come
[11:37] up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to
[11:39] the Lord for a name for an everlasting
[11:42] sign that shall not be cut off all
[11:45] because you chose to think higher
[11:47] thoughts
[11:49] amen amen praise the Lord so you've got
[11:53] to change in order to change your
[11:55] position you've got to change your
[11:56] thinking yes amen because the the Bible
[11:59] says as a man think it in his heart so
[12:02] is he
[12:04] amen so the highest thoughts you can
[12:06] have is the thoughts of God and that is
[12:08] why the mind of Christ has come down the
[12:11] bride is the mind of Christ and she
[12:13] knows what he wants done with the
[12:15] word amen so maybe you're asking what is
[12:19] the mind of
[12:21] Christ amen what is the mind of
[12:25] Christ amen we'll go to that just now
[12:29] now in a corporate world you know your
[12:33] position determines your level of
[12:38] authority it also unlocks benefits the
[12:41] higher your position is in the
[12:45] company amen I'm talking about your
[12:48] position the higher your position it
[12:51] unlocks
[12:52] benefits amen it unlocks a level of
[12:55] authority the higher you go in position
[12:58] amen that's right so in your home even
[13:02] in your home life God has set it so the
[13:05] position in your home life has a seven
[13:07] certain level of authority amen it's not
[13:11] the children who are running the home
[13:12] yes the husband is the head of the home
[13:16] amen amen praise the Lord the husband is
[13:20] the head of the wife the wife is the
[13:21] head of the
[13:22] children amen so there are levels of
[13:25] authority everywhere you go so so even
[13:29] in the spiritual realm the higher we
[13:32] Ascend into the spiritual realm the
[13:34] higher the level of your Authority amen
[13:36] amen the Bible says that he has given a
[13:39] Measure of Faith unto every man
[13:41] Hallelujah and the prophet of God tells
[13:43] us if he made you 50 cents he said be a
[13:46] best 50 cents coin you can be if he made
[13:48] you a dollar bill be the best dollar
[13:50] bill you can be what was he trying to
[13:52] say whatever level God put you in his
[13:55] kingdom serve God according to his
[13:57] purpose the best you can yes
[13:59] amen amen amen now we cannot be claiming
[14:04] to be in the glory realm and have no
[14:07] Authority amen have no power Amen in the
[14:12] glory realm is Authority is power
[14:15] hallelujah amen position determines your
[14:18] Authority amen your position determines
[14:22] your Authority amen when Adam lost his
[14:25] position what did he lose he lost his
[14:28] authority
[14:31] he lost his power over the earth now
[14:34] something to think
[14:36] about the position was lost not when Eve
[14:44] fell when he fell Adam still had
[14:49] Dominion amen because to him was given
[14:51] the mind of Christ amen he was the guide
[14:54] yeah amen he had the perfect spirit he
[14:59] was not in a fallen State Amen to him
[15:02] was given authority over the Earth
[15:05] hallelujah amen it's only when Eve asked
[15:10] Adam to
[15:12] partake and Adam partt that's the time
[15:16] he was stripped off his title deed and
[15:18] authority over the
[15:20] Earth praise the Lord so when you leave
[15:24] your position you leave your
[15:26] blessing when you leave the word you
[15:29] leave your
[15:31] blessing now you cannot claim the
[15:34] blessings of God if you leave the
[15:36] Heavenly
[15:38] places you may be accumulating wealth
[15:41] people may be accumulating wealth no
[15:43] notice I'm not using blessings there I'm
[15:46] not saying you are blessed I'm saying
[15:48] you're
[15:49] accumulating I'm not calling it
[15:51] blessings you may be accumulating wealth
[15:54] your life may be all right but you are
[15:56] cut off from the blessings of God
[15:59] you are not connected to the source of
[16:01] all
[16:02] blessings amen so which means whatever
[16:06] you accumulating in life you are not
[16:08] getting it from God and your source is
[16:10] from another
[16:12] kingdom amen there are a lot of people
[16:15] who are accumulating wealth in the world
[16:16] non-christians not in Christ they
[16:19] accumulating wealth but where are they
[16:21] getting it from they are getting it from
[16:24] another kingdom didn't the devil offer
[16:27] Jesus the kingdoms didn't he offer him
[16:29] wealth didn't he offer him these
[16:32] things amen
[16:36] now if I ask you brother
[16:40] Jaden can you see the chair in the
[16:44] kitchen can you see it you can't see
[16:47] it in order for you to see it what must
[16:50] you
[16:51] do you must change
[16:55] position you need to change your
[16:57] position to see the chair yeah
[17:01] amen now if you are comfortable where
[17:04] you are sitting and do not if I told
[17:06] gave you an instruction go and sit in
[17:08] that chair because that chair is a
[17:10] higher level of authority that chair you
[17:12] have a better
[17:13] view amen that chair there is got padded
[17:18] seating that chair has got seat
[17:22] warmers that chair has cup
[17:25] holders that chair is fully equipped to
[17:28] make make you feel comfortable I'm
[17:30] showing you a higher level of chair to
[17:33] sit but if you were comfortable there
[17:37] and you did not follow the instruction
[17:39] you will lose your
[17:41] reward
[17:43] amen what if what if you were stubborn
[17:46] or
[17:47] lazy and say well I'm fine where I am
[17:50] you would lose your reward or blessing
[17:53] amen and the only way you can receive
[17:55] the reward of blessing is to follow my
[17:58] instruction amen and do as I tell you
[18:01] then you will receive and live in the
[18:03] blessing amen the same way that is what
[18:06] the preachers are doing they have giving
[18:08] you instruction in order for you to come
[18:10] up into the higher realm and live in the
[18:12] spiritual blessings of
[18:14] God now watch when God changed Abram's
[18:18] position speaking on changing positions
[18:21] right Abram could not be blessed in the
[18:25] land that he was born but God could have
[18:28] done it
[18:29] yeah why didn't God come there in the
[18:31] land and say Abram I'm going to bless
[18:32] you in this
[18:35] land where he was in the condition he
[18:38] was he could not be
[18:40] blessed God had to take him out from
[18:43] where he was placed where he was
[18:45] born and reposition
[18:49] him and even though he was born there he
[18:52] was not going to be blessed
[18:54] there
[18:56] amen you may have been born in a certain
[18:59] home maybe they're religious family but
[19:01] that's not where you're going to be
[19:02] blessed God has called you to a higher
[19:05] realm amen and in this well is a greater
[19:07] blessing and an
[19:09] anointing
[19:12] amen amen
[19:15] hallelujah even though he was in that
[19:17] land and whatever his father had he was
[19:20] going to accumulate the blessing he was
[19:23] going to receive his father's
[19:26] inheritance amen
[19:30] if he stayed in that land all he would
[19:31] have received is his father's
[19:33] inheritance he would have maybe received
[19:35] his father's property whatever he had
[19:38] amen so he could have stayed there and
[19:40] inherited whatever his father was going
[19:42] to give him but that was not God's plan
[19:44] for his life amen he chose because God
[19:47] came to reveal his thoughts to Abraham
[19:50] he said get the out of your country
[19:52] andto a land that I will show you amen
[19:54] so he chose to follow God's thoughts and
[19:57] think higher thoughts
[19:59] and when he began to do that he
[20:01] connected with the mind of God and and
[20:04] God gave him an inheritance where if he
[20:06] looked up to the Stars he couldn't
[20:07] number it if you look to the sand of the
[20:10] sea amen he couldn't number it
[20:16] amen hallelujah amen so what am I saying
[20:21] tell your
[20:21] neighbor When God Says move
[20:25] amen God says move When God Says move
[20:28] move God says move move amen amen
[20:33] Abraham didn't have to listen to the
[20:35] word of God but he chose to listen to it
[20:38] so when God says move move amen it may
[20:41] be uncomfortable it may be all that you
[20:44] ever know you know as humans none of us
[20:46] like change really we are comfortable we
[20:49] don't like
[20:50] change amen hallelujah we like the
[20:53] status quo but God when he's taking you
[20:55] to a higher level he wants you to move
[20:58] so God is moving you changing your
[21:00] position to give you something greater
[21:03] to bless you to enlarge your territory
[21:05] move When God Says
[21:08] move
[21:10] amen now the Bible is full of examples
[21:13] people that God had to reposition in
[21:16] order for the plan of God and the word
[21:18] of God for the age to come to
[21:22] pass here what I said there in order for
[21:26] the scripture to come to pass go God had
[21:28] to reposition them amen hallelujah we
[21:33] just read now about Abraham God had to
[21:35] literally literally reposition him in
[21:38] order for scriptures to come to pass
[21:41] right Jacob had to be repositioned yes
[21:44] he couldn't find a wife in his own
[21:47] country so circumstances made him
[21:51] flee Esau and he went into another
[21:55] country and on his way to that country
[21:58] he met the angel of God
[22:00] Amen he got a touch from the Lord yes
[22:04] his walk was never the same
[22:07] amen amen so God repositioned him and
[22:11] out of that that family lean's daughters
[22:15] came forth the tribes of Israel yes how
[22:18] did he get the blessing by repositioning
[22:21] him I'm going very quickly through these
[22:22] stories Joseph was comfortable in his
[22:24] father's house he was one of the sons of
[22:26] Jacob he was living the best life he
[22:29] could in his father's house he was loved
[22:31] of his father he had a coat of many
[22:33] colors amen hallelujah and his father
[22:37] depended on him to be a snitch in the
[22:39] family and tell him everything the
[22:40] brothers were
[22:42] doing
[22:45] amen but God had a plan for Joseph's
[22:48] life not only for Joseph's life but to
[22:51] save Egypt from famine and the rest of
[22:54] the
[22:55] world so God had to take him through
[22:59] uncomfortable stages of his life

[23:03] him amen and watch the Journeys in his
[23:06] life he got sold as a slave to the

[23:11] be condition that's not what all the
[23:13] word had in store for him he got sold as
[23:16] a slave to Piper's house but that was
[23:18] just another stage in the journey he
[23:21] became the head of all slaves there but
[23:23] he wasn't happy with that position amen
[23:26] false accusation brought against him

[23:39] you're in the prison nobody was bowing
[23:41] down to him you're in the prison the
[23:43] dream didn't line up with where he was

[23:50] keep moving on God is taking into your
[23:52] blessing amen thank you Lord amen if the
[23:57] word of God declares that by the Stripes

[34:17] a son in the house is not good enough
[34:19] you don't there's no level of authority
[34:21] placed on you when you're a baby so just
[34:24] being born Sons doesn't give you the
[34:26] authority doesn't give you the of power
[34:29] according to the old amen you know the
[34:31] traditions of Israel you had to be
[34:33] placed under tutors that's Galatians now
[34:35] you had to be placed under tutors yes
[34:39] Hallelujah the Bible says now are we the

[35:08] we learned well under the tutor and we
[35:11] can take care of father's business amen
[35:14] hallelujah amen so the word of God
[35:17] identifies our position and in order for
[35:19] us to see ourselves clearly in the word
[35:22] we must change our position of how we
[35:24] see ourselves amen
[35:35] we must change our position of how we
[35:37] see
[35:38] ourselves yes we must value

[36:55] revelation of the word amen and he wants
[36:58] her to know what she

[46:30] Heavenly places are Heavenly places says
[46:34] just for a moment is the believer's
[46:36] position in Christ where the believer
[46:38] stands in
[46:39] [Music]
[46:41] Christ in Heavenly places so that's the
[46:44] believer's position what is that
[46:46] Ephesians 1 and3 I'm defining that for
[46:49] you now
[46:53] amen cuz we're about to climax now amen
[46:58] how many of you ready for the

[47:05] Landing when you hit the the ground you
[47:08] also feel
[47:10] that you feel the speed you don't feel
[47:12] the speed in the air so you feel the

[47:45] Holy Ghost amen if you don't have the
[47:47] Holy Ghost you are out of position amen
[47:50] you must have the Holy Ghost in This
[47:51] Time in order to be in position the
[47:54] prerequisite for the Rapture is the Holy
[47:56] Ghost
[47:57] no Holy Ghost no Rapture so the
[48:00] believer's position in Christ is the
[48:02] baptism of the Holy
[48:04] Ghost the Lord that's our inheritance
[48:07] amen the land of the Holy Ghost didn't

[53:42] the
[53:42] earth and his inheritance belongs on the
[53:45] earth yes amen so John is not the
[53:48] Redeemer so he can't take the book and
[53:52] because John is a type of Eve can Eve
[53:54] take the book no who must take the book
[53:57] Adam must take the book come on give God

[55:22] on the throne and the one sitting on the
[55:24] throne told him sorry you're not worthy

[55:30] position just like our women are asked
[55:32] to know their position and not to handle

[56:07] Revelation 5 for the
[56:10] breach so after seven Church ages he's
[56:13] played the part of the M mediatorial
[56:16] work as priest now he's coming back out
[56:19] of the sanctuary showing that the
[56:22] sacrifice was accepted the blood was
[56:24] applied on the altar he coming back out
