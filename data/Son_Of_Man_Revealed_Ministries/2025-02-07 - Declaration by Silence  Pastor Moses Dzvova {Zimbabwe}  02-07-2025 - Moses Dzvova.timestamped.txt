[0:00] Amen.
[0:01] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. We greet everyone in the
[0:03] mighty, the matchless name of our Lord
[0:05] and Savior Jesus Christ.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[0:08] the Lord. You may be seated for a few
[0:10] moments. Amen. So I can see everybody.
[0:13] Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you.
[0:15] Give you a warm welcome into the house
[0:17] of the Lord.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And pray that you'll be blessed
[0:20] even as you Amen. hear the word of the
[0:22] Lord. Amen. Come expecting a blessing.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you know that
[0:27] God exceeds our expectations? Amen.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; So some, you know, in the book of Luke
[0:33] 6:38, it says, "Give, it'll come back."
[0:36] Now, some people may be expecting a a
[0:38] mediocre blessing, but he says, "It'll
[0:39] come back pressed down."
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Shaken together.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Running over."
[0:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God always deals in the overflow.
[0:47] That's why the wise virgins will always
[0:50] have extra in their lamps.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. They also got a vessel
[0:54] &gt;&gt; because he knew that there will come a
[0:55] time when gross darkness will come
[0:57] across the earth. So he he says when God
[0:59] calls a man, he equips the man.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; And he sends him out. So we the wise
[1:03] virgins
[1:05] &gt;&gt; are no longer just the wise virgins.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; We are the married wife of the Lord
[1:09] Jesus Christ.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:13] &gt;&gt; and we are not mothers. Sorry. We are
[1:15] not wives without children.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; We are bearing forth his life.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; Bearing forth his image.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are reproducing the kind of
[1:23] life that Adam was supposed to
[1:25] reproduce.
[1:27] Jesus Christ has finally found a woman
[1:28] that he can put seed into
[1:31] &gt;&gt; and bring forth
[1:32] &gt;&gt; the original seed again.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a time and season we're
[1:36] living in.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; And you know what? God has chosen you.

[2:17] believers in Durban, you can't mess with
[2:19] them. These are the generals.

[2:22] first. And these are mighty gentile
[2:25] warriors. They are very skilled in the

[8:05] many love pastor? Pastor Rodney.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; With his wife.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; They almost killed me in Peter Mary's
[8:12] bed.
[8:15] So I preached one service in the morning
[8:17] by the girls eye there. Then two more
[8:21] services in Peter Mar.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we had wonderful times.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; So I'm happy to see brothers and
[8:31] sisters. So because of time we let's go
[8:35] straight to the word.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I also want to say pastor
[8:39] Denzel was a a blessing when he pastor
[8:43] Adrienne when he came to Harare he came
[8:47] to preach for pastor Kichi and also

[8:56] &gt;&gt; So you people you are so blessed to have
[9:00] a gifted minister among you. Amen.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; I believe the angel of the Lord was
[9:06] there.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; When Pastor Adrian was preaching, I
[9:09] could feel the anointing and the
[9:11] presence.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; We were thoroughly blessed.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; So I want to tell you that he did not
[9:18] disappoint you.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; He represented you well.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; So people really appreciated uh this
[9:26] church because of him. He was a very
[9:28] good ambassador. And we also had lunch
[9:32] together. We were fellowshipping. Amen.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; So I'm happy to see Pastor Eshko.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you my friend.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let's go straight to the
[9:44] word.
[9:46] First Kings chapter 17.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; The atmosphere is so wonderful.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Those were playing instruments and
[9:55] singing. I felt hey we could have
[9:58] continued for another hour just in
[10:01] worship.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; How many agree with me?
[10:03] &gt;&gt; It was so wonderful. And I also want to
[10:07] appreciate brother Matia that I came
[10:10] with my countryman, my homeboy. Amen.
[10:16] Oh yes. Yeah, he's there. So he's with
[10:18] brother Rodney. So I'm with him. So
[10:22] let's read first Kings chapter 17. We
[10:26] will start from verse uh 8. And the word
[10:30] of the Lord came unto him saying arise
[10:33] get thee to Zarifat which belongth to
[10:35] Zidon
[10:36] &gt;&gt; and dwell there.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; And behold I have commanded a widow
[10:42] woman there to sustain thee.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; I have commanded what? a widow woman
[10:50] there to sustain thee. So ar So he arose
[10:54] and went to Zarif. And when he had come
[10:57] to the gate of the city, behold the
[10:59] woman were the woman was there gathering
[11:03] of sticks. And he called to her and
[11:06] said, "Vetch me, I pray thee a little
[11:09] water in a vessel that I may drink."
[11:12] &gt;&gt; May God add his blessings to the reading
[11:13] of the word. So let's be seated. So I'll
[11:17] read as well. Revelation
[11:20] &gt;&gt; chapter 8.
[11:22] I wish I was with brother Denzel because
[11:25] when I was when I'm always with him in
[11:27] the car, he's always telling me naked.
[11:30] So, but today I'm in trouble with no
[11:32] nugget.
[11:34] So, when I'm with brother Denz, we
[11:37] always enjoy.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; He's always preaching to me. So,
[11:41] Revelation 1
[11:44] &gt;&gt; it says, "And when he had opened the
[11:46] seventh seal, there was silence
[11:49] &gt;&gt; in heaven about the space of half an
[11:52] hour."
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to give a small title. I
[11:58] just want to say a declaration by
[12:00] silence.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Declaration by by silence.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; So, you know that God
[12:07] speaks in silence. How many believe
[12:10] that?
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Matthew, God speaks in
[12:17] silence.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now the Bible says to
[12:22] Elijah, I have already commanded the W
[12:26] of to sustain you.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; So can can you can we repeat it again?
[12:30] Maybe the same first kings. I want you
[12:34] to see something. Let's go to first
[12:35] kings chapter 17 verse 9. M
[12:38] &gt;&gt; we we we we go back. He says
[12:41] he says
[12:43] yes arise get thee to Zarif which
[12:46] belongth to Zidon and dwell there.
[12:49] Behold I have commanded a widow woman
[12:53] there to sustain thee.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; So I was thinking on myself to say where
[13:00] huh can anyone show me where God
[13:03] commanded the woman? Huh? Can anyone
[13:06] show? Can anyone show me where God
[13:11] commanded her? Where God spoke to this
[13:13] woman,
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Pastor Tensel? So that's why that's
[13:17] where I took my title
[13:19] &gt;&gt; declaration by silence.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because listen, Elijah
[13:24] comes and says, "Can you give me food?"
[13:28] And the woman says, "No, I'm only left
[13:30] with only a few so that I eat and I die
[13:34] with my son." And then uh but she did
[13:38] not know are we together
[13:40] &gt;&gt; that God had already commanded her.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[13:46] &gt;&gt; It was a declaration by silence.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[13:51] &gt;&gt; God, how many times
[13:53] &gt;&gt; does God speak to you?
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Does God commission you
[13:58] &gt;&gt; in silence?
[14:00] &gt;&gt; So sometimes you hear someone saying,
[14:01] "God has called me to go and preach. God
[14:04] has called me to do this.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? Don't worry. It's declaration by
[14:10] silence.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together friends?
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. I want to start with a quotation.
[14:15] You are going to see what brother
[14:16] Brhamam says. How many love the prophet?
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; So, pastor Denzel,
[14:22] I wish I gave you my notes so that we we
[14:26] fellowshipped with this declaration by
[14:29] silence. Amen. So I just want to
[14:34] I want you to see this. Amen. How many
[14:38] under expectation?
[14:39] &gt;&gt; So it's in the message Elijah and the
[14:42] meal offering.
[14:44] So
[14:46] let's start paragraph 57.
[14:49] This is 60310.
[14:52] This blessed me. He says now on
[14:54] paragraph 57.
[14:56] Oh there it was. And when they walked,
[15:00] okay, let's jump that maybe. Okay, let's
[15:04] just read. When they walked in the fiery
[15:06] furnace under trial, under a test, they
[15:09] held true to the end. But God was there
[15:13] just in a spare of a moment and he
[15:16] delivered them. We know the Hebrew
[15:18] children. They know that they they were
[15:21] prayed up. Their sins were confessed.
[15:24] They know they had met every
[15:27] requirement. And yet he seemed to be
[15:31] silent.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; He's only silent to test you.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; To see really what you are,
[15:40] &gt;&gt; what's on the inside of you.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; See if you really mean from your heart.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; What you are saying with your lips.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Let that go deep.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; We can sing with our lips. But in our
[15:54] heart say
[15:55] &gt;&gt; amen.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; But is our heart saying it?
[15:59] &gt;&gt; You must mean what you say
[16:00] &gt;&gt; and say what you mean.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Some brothers don't mean what they say
[16:05] &gt;&gt; and they they don't say what they mean.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham says here, let that
[16:10] go deep. We can say with our lips, but
[16:13] is is our heart saying it.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 58. Now when this little woman
[16:20] knowed that she had met all these
[16:22] requirements and still God was silent
[16:27] seemed like he didn't even care for her.
[16:30] He didn't care whether she lived or died
[16:34] but all the time God was working.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Do you see my brother?
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Even when God is silent but all the time
[16:44] God is working. Amen.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; You might be praying for a job. You
[16:48] might be praying for healing. You might
[16:50] be praying for a heart desire. And God
[16:52] seems to be silent. But all the time,
[16:55] God is working.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; God works by silence.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm enjoying. And still God was
[17:07] silent. Sinned. He didn't even care for
[17:11] her. He didn't care whether she lived or
[17:14] died. But all the time, God was working.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Listen now. She didn't know about it.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; But God told Elijah,
[17:23] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[17:25] &gt;&gt; He dried up the brook, reached out his
[17:28] hand and stopped the brook from running.
[17:31] And Elijah said, "Lord, why did it
[17:35] stop?"
[17:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "I have commanded a widow woman
[17:41] to feed you."
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Listen now. He had already commanded
[17:46] her.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; She didn't know it. Pastor Jason, he had
[17:51] already. So, how many times does God
[17:53] command you?
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; You must be sensitive to the Holy
[17:57] Spirit.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; You must be spiritually sensitive.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Many times God commands us
[18:05] &gt;&gt; to do certain things. But we what we we
[18:09] miss it somehow. He says he had already
[18:12] commanded her. She didn't know it.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; That's my message.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Declaration by silent.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Huh? God
[18:23] silently commanded her to sustain
[18:26] Elijah.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; So maybe after service you want to see
[18:31] the pastor and the deacons and say, "I'm
[18:34] struggling. Things are difficult.
[18:36] Pastor, can you help me?" But you might
[18:38] not know that God had already commanded
[18:42] you to sustain the ministry.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Brother, do you understand what I'm
[18:46] saying? You might be thinking, you know,
[18:48] I'm poor. Things are difficult. God is
[18:50] not answering me. But do you know what
[18:53] God has commanded?
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Ask your neighbor said, "Do you know
[18:56] what he has commanded?" I'm telling you.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Hey, Pastor Rodney already. So, you
[19:04] don't know. Maybe you are the one that
[19:06] is supposed to sustain this ministry.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe you are the one who supposed to
[19:12] sustain your family,
[19:14] &gt;&gt; but you don't know.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; But God has already commanded you.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Pastor Denzel, I have
[19:23] commanded a widow woman to feed you." He
[19:28] had already commanded her. She didn't
[19:31] know it.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Listen now. Oh, I like this. I like
[19:34] Malachi 4.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; He might have commanded of you a
[19:39] testimony of your healing.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; You might not know it. For those who are
[19:44] sick, he might have commanded you,
[19:47] Pastor Lord, a testimony of your
[19:50] healing.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; You might not know it,
[19:53] &gt;&gt; but just hang on.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; I want to He might have commanded a
[19:57] testimony of your dream car, of your
[19:59] dream house, of whatever. You might not
[20:02] know it, but just hang on.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; He might have commanded a testimony of
[20:09] your healing.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; You might not know it, but just hang on.
[20:14] When you are sure that you have met all
[20:17] the requirements, when you know that you
[20:20] have done everything that you know to do
[20:23] and made yourself before God, there is
[20:26] only one thing to do is hang on.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to his promised day.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Pastor, stay there.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; God promised to answer.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; He will do it.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; You don't know what he has commanded?
[20:44] &gt;&gt; What angel?
[20:46] &gt;&gt; I also know if I have been commanded
[20:48] also.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; I'm an angel also.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Says, "Who is greater? The angel in
[20:55] heaven or the angel in the pit?"
[20:58] Bible says, "I can tell you an angel in
[21:01] the pit is more powerful
[21:04] &gt;&gt; than an angel in heaven."
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen."
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; He might have commanded me.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; I might not have known it. Maybe he told
[21:13] pastor and I did not know it.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Maybe he commanded me
[21:18] to come to T but I did not what know it.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe he told pastor what?
[21:25] &gt;&gt; You don't know what he has commanded.
[21:27] Hallelujah.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many are being blessed?
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; How many are going to pray for
[21:34] sensitivity?
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; You know, brother was so sensitive to
[21:38] the leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Even when he was walking in the woods,
[21:42] when God was passing, brother would
[21:45] remove his
[21:46] &gt;&gt; brother could sense
[21:50] &gt;&gt; that I'm not alone here. That Jesus is
[21:52] here.
[21:54] Billip when he saw the angel brother
[21:57] says he became sensitive
[22:00] &gt;&gt; every time the angel came was the first
[22:03] one to know
[22:04] &gt;&gt; before brotherham says he's here knew
[22:08] all
[22:09] &gt;&gt; can you say hallelujah
[22:10] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[22:11] &gt;&gt; let's be sensitive
[22:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[22:14] &gt;&gt; hey pastor Rodney he might have
[22:16] commanded of you a testimony of your
[22:20] healing you might not know it but just
[22:23] What? Hang on. When you are sure,
[22:27] when you are sure that you have met the
[22:29] requirements, when you know that you
[22:31] have done everything that you know to do
[22:35] and laid yourself before God, there is
[22:38] only one thing to do. Hang on to his
[22:41] promise. Then stay there. God promised
[22:44] to answer. He will do it. You don't know
[22:48] what he has commanded, what angel or
[22:52] what to do. It may be this night.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; If you want God to bless you,
[22:57] personalize the quotations.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Personalize the scripture.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; It may be this night.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about today.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; It might be this night.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; How many knows that God hates a
[23:11] powerless religion?
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's be honest. God has a
[23:16] powerless nature.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Where God is, there is power.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Where God is, there is healing.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Where God is identified by his
[23:27] characteristics.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Someone must be healed today.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Someone must see Jesus desires
[23:36] &gt;&gt; today.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't force me to preach in Zulu.
[23:43] Amen. Today, hallelujah. Are you being
[23:47] blessed?
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Are you enjoying?
[23:51] &gt;&gt; And then he says, you don't know what
[23:53] angel or what to do. It it may be this
[23:57] night before the healing service starts
[24:00] tomorrow night. God might have seen your
[24:03] condition today.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; He might have heard your your prayer.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Listen to this now. He says, "I felt so
[24:11] sorry for these deaf and dump people. I
[24:15] want to lay hands on them and pray for
[24:18] them. Started to
[24:21] started to stop last night." But I said
[24:24] that wouldn't be right for the rest of
[24:27] them. But how do I know that somewhere
[24:32] and a silent God who knows the heart?
[24:36] &gt;&gt; These people has met their requirement.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Church, you might have met God's
[24:42] requirement.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; And they are ready
[24:45] &gt;&gt; and there is an angel here tonight
[24:49] &gt;&gt; to deliver them
[24:51] &gt;&gt; from all their affliction.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; I believe the angel is here. Amen.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; We are in the land of the angel.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[25:01] &gt;&gt; Brother, things happened in De.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord was told go to De
[25:08] &gt;&gt; and we are in Deon.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; We cannot be sick in the land of the of
[25:14] the prophet.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; We cannot l in the land of the prophet,
[25:19] &gt;&gt; in the land of the angel.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Huh? He says, "God,
[25:27] he says there's an angel here tonight to
[25:31] deliver them from all their what?
[25:34] Affliction." How do I know?
[25:36] &gt;&gt; God might have commanded their
[25:39] deliverance tonight.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Whether I pray for the
[25:44] sick or not,
[25:46] &gt;&gt; they will get it
[25:48] &gt;&gt; because God has required it."
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Be sure
[25:53] &gt;&gt; of God. Hallelujah.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; He's certain of God.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; And then hold on.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Meet his requirements.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; God knows how to do things. That's
[26:03] right. Knows how to do it in the right
[26:06] way.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor and say, "You don't
[26:09] know what he has commanded.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Brother, you don't know what God has
[26:13] commanded."
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know the thoughts which I
[26:17] think towards you, thoughts of what?
[26:20] Peace
[26:21] &gt;&gt; and not of evil. to give you an expected
[26:24] end.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; I've never seen the righteous forsaken.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Neither is he taking bread.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take no thought of what
[26:37] you're going to eat.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Consider the liies.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; They know they toil or spin. But yet
[26:45] Solomon in yet in all his glory was not
[26:48] arrayed like the
[26:50] &gt;&gt; brother. Amen. May God grant us grace. I
[26:54] like this quotation. You don't know what
[26:57] God has commanded.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Declaration by silence.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; That woman God had already commanded
[27:06] her.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; And then when Elijah came, you know,
[27:09] maybe she was frail, she was weak, you
[27:13] know, hungry. And then she sees Elijah
[27:16] saying, "Can you give me food?" She
[27:18] might have said, "Hey, this cruel man is
[27:21] is looking so strong and is looking for
[27:24] food from me. Why?" But Elijah, when she
[27:27] said, "Uh, I've only left with a meal
[27:30] for me to eat and die." Elijah might
[27:33] have said, "You liar. You are not left
[27:36] with a meal. God has commanded you to
[27:40] sustain me."
[27:41] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[27:42] &gt;&gt; So God had told who? Elijah. Yeah,
[27:46] &gt;&gt; but she thought, you know, she was gone.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; She was dead. Are we together? But God
[27:53] had silently what?
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Commanded.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; How many times?
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Your pastor preaches the word.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe he does not mention about your
[28:03] school fees. He does not mention in that
[28:05] sermon about your healing, about your
[28:08] job. And then after that service,
[28:11] &gt;&gt; you hear a sister saying, "Thank God I'm
[28:13] healed." You hear another brother say
[28:16] thank God I'm promoted. You hear someone
[28:18] say thank God I'm in courtship. But when
[28:21] we analyze that sermon you don't see
[28:24] whether pastor spoke about courtships
[28:26] spoke about houses but it will be a
[28:29] silent declaration.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; God will be speaking.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God speaks in silence.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Can I give another example? Amen.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; You know you can see brother Brham there
[28:46] is every time brother Brham did not
[28:49] speak openly
[28:50] &gt;&gt; that he was Elijah. How many knows that
[28:53] &gt;&gt; he never even spoke openly that he was a
[28:56] prophet. You hear brother say how many
[28:59] believe that I'm his prophet says sorry.
[29:02] It st people do you believe I'm his
[29:04] servant.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Have you heard that pastor? Brother
[29:07] Brham did not open are we together claim
[29:11] that he was a what? a prophet. But I'll
[29:15] show you that he did it silently.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[29:20] &gt;&gt; So one day he was speaking as if he's
[29:22] talking about his marriage with sister
[29:25] Ma, but he was declaring to us that he
[29:28] was
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Malach.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, he said, you know, I I
[29:34] was saying to sister Ma, no, I think,
[29:37] you know, you must get married to
[29:39] someone who is better than me. Amen. How
[29:41] many understand that story? So, brother
[29:43] Brham was dey darling. He was not being
[29:46] straight. But sister Ma really loved
[29:49] brother Brham and sister Ma was not like
[29:52] our African sisters. You know that our
[29:54] African sisters because of culture you
[29:57] are not allowed like to approach a man.
[29:59] But sister Ma went to God to report
[30:03] brother. Can you imagine? But our
[30:06] sisters can't do that. Pastor Rodney.
[30:08] Hey my sister. Sister Rodney.
[30:10] Hallelujah. Amen. Pastor Denzel,
[30:13] brother, sister Ma went to the altar to
[30:18] report brother.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; She said, "Lord, look at Billy, he's
[30:22] wasting my time. He does not want to
[30:24] marry me. You know, I'm not happy." And
[30:27] then God opened the Bible
[30:33] &gt;&gt; straight to Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6. And
[30:38] when she said amen, she saw behold I
[30:42] send you Elijah.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you the connection.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; How many can say of marriage? She's
[30:49] praying about marriage, pastor. Huh? But
[30:51] God gives her a scripture.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; So sister knew the scriptural
[31:01] identification of brother.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; How many can say
[31:05] &gt;&gt; hallelujah?
[31:06] Huh? And then said then she knew that we
[31:11] were going to be married.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Why? It means she knew that Billy is
[31:16] Elijah
[31:18] &gt;&gt; because she's praying about marriage and
[31:20] God says, "Behold, I sent you Elijah."
[31:24] &gt;&gt; It was a silent declaration and she
[31:27] caught it. Are we together? So brother
[31:30] is like he's talking a story but he's
[31:33] also telling us I am Elijah. Behold, I
[31:37] said you who was the Elijah who was
[31:39] being revealed to it's brother.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; How many can say silent declaration?
[31:45] &gt;&gt; So even pastors sometimes they might
[31:47] feel you know if I tell you who I am you
[31:50] know in the message it's like a taboo to
[31:53] say I'm an apostle I'm a prophet I'm an
[31:56] evangelist. So but the pastors they say
[31:58] it silently. How many can say amen
[32:02] pastor? You can see if you are careful,
[32:04] if you are spiritually intelligent, you
[32:07] can know.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Brother so and so has declared that he's
[32:10] a prophet. Brother and has declared that
[32:13] he's a pastor. How many understand what
[32:16] I'm saying?
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Silent declaration.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; You can even reject the message in a
[32:21] subtle way. How many can say amen?
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Like for example, I know it's not about
[32:27] brother brand. Are we together? It's
[32:29] about the Lord Jesus Christ. Hey, don't
[32:32] misunderstand me. Don't take me for what
[32:34] I what I say, but take me for what I
[32:36] mean.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; It's about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Brother Brham was the
[32:43] angel. Are we together?
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the message is Christ.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; But you can hear now a minister every
[32:52] day
[32:52] &gt;&gt; of his message. It's not about brother.
[32:55] It's not you know until you can say
[32:57] what's wrong with this.
[33:00] But the statement is true. Are we
[33:02] together? But if it is repeated,
[33:04] continuous, you can see that no me I'm
[33:08] not comfortable with. How many can say
[33:11] &gt;&gt; pastor Rodney? Are we together?
[33:13] &gt;&gt; The statement is right
[33:15] &gt;&gt; to say it's not about brother, but it's
[33:19] about what? Christ. He is the principal
[33:21] theme of our preaching. He's the
[33:24] principal theme of our conversation.
[33:26] He's the principal theme of everything.
[33:29] But when every day you come and say it's
[33:32] not about brother, it's not you can see
[33:34] that you are trying to drive something.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; It's a silent declaration
[33:39] &gt;&gt; and then after some time you hear that
[33:41] brother has lifted a message.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; You won't be surprised. You said, "Oh,
[33:46] we could see the way he was preaching.
[33:48] We could see the statements."
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right, Pastor Ley?
[33:52] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about silent a declaration
[33:55] by silence. How many knows that you can
[33:58] ask man silently?
[34:00] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Without asking it.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. If you are spiritually intelligent,
[34:06] you can catch it. You can ask a job in a
[34:09] subtle way. Can I give you an example
[34:11] for that? You know, Joseph could
[34:14] interpret dreams and he interpreted the
[34:17] dream of what?
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Of Pharaoh.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; And then Pharaoh was troubled when there
[34:23] was no man. You know when I was watching
[34:25] when I was following I saw that no no
[34:28] normally when the word is revealed when
[34:31] the seals are revealed you know it
[34:34] brings life it brings joy
[34:37] &gt;&gt; but when there is no revelation
[34:39] &gt;&gt; it brings death can someone say amen
[34:43] &gt;&gt; you know
[34:44] &gt;&gt; receiving revelation
[34:46] &gt;&gt; hh brings life
[34:49] &gt;&gt; and not having revelation brings death
[34:52] &gt;&gt; can I show you you know that even in in
[34:55] the Bible in the days of King
[34:57] Nebuchadnezzar there was a you know the
[35:00] the dream Nebuchadnezzar dreamt a dream
[35:03] of the head of gold the bracelets of
[35:05] silver the thighs of brass the the feet
[35:08] of iron and clay. So the Bible says King
[35:11] Nebuchadnezzar was troubled because
[35:14] there was no child here. There was no
[35:16] wise man. There was no magician that
[35:18] could interpret that dream.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Huh? And then the king said all the wise
[35:24] people are going to die. If this image,
[35:27] if this dream is not interpreted, people
[35:30] will die.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; So I want to show you that even in
[35:33] Revelation chapter 5, who is worthy h to
[35:37] take the book and to open it? Amen.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; You know that the prophet says if there
[35:42] was no man that was worthy to open the
[35:45] seals, brother says the human race was
[35:48] going to die to perish. The whole human
[35:51] race was going to perish. That's why
[35:55] when there was no man in heaven, when
[35:57] there was no man on earth, John was
[35:59] crying.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[36:01] &gt;&gt; And then when the lab, the line of the
[36:04] tribe of Judah opened the seals. Are we
[36:07] together? John was happy. Brother says
[36:10] he might have seen his name in the book.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; So that revelation brings life.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Can someone say amen?
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; And even the king Nebuchadnezzar he said
[36:28] if this dream pastor Rodney is not
[36:31] revealed is not interpreted
[36:34] all the wise people are dying. Daniel
[36:37] went to his friends and said friends
[36:40] let's pray
[36:42] &gt;&gt; if God does not reveal this dream we are
[36:44] finished
[36:45] &gt;&gt; and in a night vision God came and
[36:48] revealed are we together and they did
[36:51] not die
[36:52] &gt;&gt; so do you see that where revelation is
[36:55] there is life
[36:56] &gt;&gt; where there is leg of revelation there
[36:58] is death
[36:59] &gt;&gt; how many can say amen
[37:01] &gt;&gt; and revelation
[37:03] &gt;&gt; is given from God Yeah.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Silver. He says, "Whom do men say I, the
[37:08] son of man?" Others said, "You are
[37:10] Elijah." Others said, "You are
[37:12] Isaiah's." But he says, "You, who do you
[37:14] say I am?"
[37:16] &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "You are Christ, the son
[37:18] of the living God. For flesh and blood
[37:22] has not revealed this unto you."
[37:24] [Music]
[37:25] &gt;&gt; So we can't give you revelation.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; It's divinely given.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; It comes from God.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; How many can say
[37:33] &gt;&gt; amen?
[37:34] How many are being blessed?
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Who? Listen, if you know who God is,
[37:43] &gt;&gt; he will reveal to you who you are.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; If you want to know your position, you
[37:48] must first of all know his position.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; When Peter says you are Christ,
[37:54] &gt;&gt; are we together? And then says you are
[37:56] Peter,
[37:57] &gt;&gt; you are a rock.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? When you know who
[38:01] he is, he will reveal to you who you
[38:05] are.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; What says thou of thyself?
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Are you the one or shall we wait for
[38:12] another? They came to John the Baptist
[38:14] and said, "What says thou of yourself?"
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; So you you you you want to tell me that
[38:21] they did not know that he was called
[38:23] John Zachariah.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Even the people who worked at the home
[38:26] affairs, they knew this is John
[38:27] Zachariah. But they come to him and
[38:29] said, "What says thou of thyself?" They
[38:32] were not expecting him to say, "No, they
[38:35] wanted his script identification."
[38:38] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; What says thou of thyself?
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Are you the one or shall we wait for
[38:44] another?
[38:45] &gt;&gt; He said, I am the voice of one crying in
[38:49] the wilderness.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Brother, it's very important
[38:53] &gt;&gt; to know who you are.
[38:56] says the reason
[38:59] the reason Jesus did all the miracles,
[39:02] healed the people, performed miracles,
[39:05] he knew who he was.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; There's power in knowing who you are.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you can see pastor Rodney in
[39:13] his church when there's a prayer line,
[39:15] maybe there is a demon that is causing
[39:18] are we together? And pastor Rodney says
[39:20] to the Tim as the pastor of this church,
[39:26] &gt;&gt; I cast you out.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; He's not trying to be proud.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; He wants to for the demon to know who he
[39:34] is
[39:35] &gt;&gt; because the demons they take advantage
[39:38] that we don't know who we are.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; So when you come pastor me and say as
[39:43] the pastor of this church I rebuke you.
[39:46] When you see pastor as the pastor of
[39:49] this church come out,
[39:52] &gt;&gt; it's not pride.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says a sister who knows
[39:57] her position,
[39:59] &gt;&gt; she is more powerful than a pretending
[40:02] preacher.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He want people who
[40:06] knows who they are. Can you say amen?
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Ah, come on church.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Hallelujah. You must
[40:15] know who you are.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; We are looking for sisters who knows who
[40:20] they are.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; We cast out demons by revelation.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Don't be manipulated by a demon. And can
[40:29] I shock you? There was a minister, you
[40:31] know, he you know sometimes you know
[40:34] pastors and what I don't know what
[40:35] happens sometimes they will be owing
[40:37] people money and things. It happens. So
[40:40] this pastor owed people a lot of money.
[40:43] So he was casting out a demon. That says
[40:46] I won't go. You are a
[40:51] demon says I won't go. You must first of
[40:54] all pay up. You must first of all pay
[40:57] the people that you owe. And the pastor
[41:00] knew who he was. Pastor, he said to the
[41:03] demon, "It's true that I owe people
[41:05] money. It's true that I'm in a foreign
[41:07] state, but still in my fall fallen
[41:10] state, I'm more powerful than you. Come
[41:12] out. Come out. I'm going to go and pay
[41:16] up after you are gone.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Say amen. The pastor knew who he was.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; My circumstance does not determine who I
[41:28] am.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; If I you come out,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; we must know who we are.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The power of knowledge.
[41:41] Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Declaration by silence.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; So Joseph, how many are being blessed?
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Joseph came and said, "Your dream is
[41:52] one.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; There is seven years of plenty and seven
[41:57] years of fine that are going to come."
[41:59] So listen now. Joseph is now applying
[42:02] for the job silent
[42:04] &gt;&gt; in a subtle way. Pastor D. He speaks
[42:07] everything and then he says to V, "You
[42:09] know what? You must look for a wise man.
[42:13] Look for a what? That will prepare, you
[42:15] know, the the Ghas and store the food.
[42:18] And Pharaoh said, "Hey, I don't suffer
[42:21] for gladly."
[42:22] &gt;&gt; You understand? You want a job,
[42:25] &gt;&gt; you are the man. I'm telling you, Far
[42:27] could see, but Joseph was not speaking
[42:30] direct,
[42:31] &gt;&gt; but he was applying for a job.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; You can apply for a job indirect, in a
[42:37] silent way. How many can say it? You can
[42:39] ask money in a silent way.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; You know pastor people can see it.
[42:44] Pastor Rodley silent declaration.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; May God help us. You know that people in
[42:50] the blood they are so wise. They are so
[42:52] intelligent. So some people think people
[42:54] cannot see through. People can see this
[42:57] one is applying for money. This one is
[43:00] looking for money. This one how many
[43:02] understand that?
[43:03] &gt;&gt; May God silent declaration.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? Sometimes you don't have to chase
[43:08] away someone from work, but you can
[43:11] chase him silently.
[43:14] Can I give you an example?
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[43:16] &gt;&gt; You know, a was giving Sah hard times
[43:20] and Sarah went to Abraham and said,
[43:22] "Look at this man." I'm talking about
[43:24] declaration by silence. You know me, I'm
[43:27] not deceived by words.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; People say words, they deceive. But if
[43:32] you want to really know what someone
[43:33] thinks about you, watch their actions.
[43:36] How many can say amen?
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, pastor. I can't deceive you. I
[43:41] watch actions.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Someone can say, "I love you, pastor. I
[43:45] love you." But you see the actions.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; See someone coming, oh pastor, I like
[43:50] you. God bless you. But is a trouble go
[43:54] around telling people, did you hear that
[43:57] sermon? How did you see it? But after
[43:59] that, God bless you. Me, I don't care
[44:02] about God bless you. I watch the what?
[44:04] The actions.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say hallelujah?
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[44:11] &gt;&gt; I do not want to go there. I do not want
[44:14] to go there. You know me. How many can
[44:16] say amen?
[44:17] &gt;&gt; I was just passing through somebody.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[44:22] &gt;&gt; You even in your heart whatever you are,
[44:24] how many have experienced that?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you see the people's words not
[44:29] matching what actions, there's something
[44:32] wrong.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Silent declaration.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So now we see Sarah
[44:40] comes to Abraham. He says, "Hey, look at
[44:42] this man what she's doing." And Abraham
[44:44] said, "Behold." Are we together?
[44:47] &gt;&gt; That your handmade is in your hands. Do
[44:49] to her as it pleases you.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And Sarah, the Bible
[44:55] says she dealt hardly with hugger and
[44:59] she fell and she left. She was not
[45:02] chased away together hagger. Sarah did
[45:05] not just away but silent declaration
[45:08] &gt;&gt; declaration by silence.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; You know like right now I know I am
[45:13] loved here.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; You can feel it.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; How many can say
[45:17] &gt;&gt; you know when I am not loved pastor
[45:19] Rodney I can even feel it. You just see
[45:22] me go God bless you is over and I run
[45:25] away. What you think people will be
[45:27] quiet? Can I tell you those people who
[45:30] were saying bab they were not speaking
[45:33] like what I'm saying.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; The prophet says they were thinking in
[45:37] their minds to say this man is what but
[45:39] he could pick it because he says you
[45:42] know your thoughts they speak much
[45:44] louder in heaven. You know the pulpit is
[45:48] the closest place to heaven on earth.
[45:53] This place is so sensitive
[45:56] that whatever people say I hear it let's
[45:58] say you say are you just close man
[46:01] when I when you speak like in your mind
[46:04] me I'll be hearing go back to Zimbabwe
[46:07] &gt;&gt; yeah here in the pit it is magnified how
[46:12] many can say amen
[46:13] &gt;&gt; there's no one saying that but it's just
[46:16] an example how many are being blessed
[46:19] &gt;&gt; declaration by what
[46:21] &gt;&gt; that's why brother comes and Then Jesus
[46:23] said to them, you you what? You say one
[46:26] thing and
[46:27] &gt;&gt; against me now, you'll be forgiven. But
[46:30] time will come when the Holy Ghost is
[46:32] what is revealed to say one word. You
[46:36] will never what? But those people,
[46:38] Pastor Rodri, they never spoke loudly.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; They were speaking in silence.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Silent declaration.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Do you see my brother, my sister, may
[46:49] God grant us grace. when you are talking
[46:52] when you are quiet.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Hey, I went somewhere you know it was at
[46:58] I'm sorry to say that. So I went not not
[47:00] in my church a brother somewhere. So I
[47:02] went so I wanted to see a a a minister
[47:05] friend. Then we just when I arrived they
[47:08] were eating breakfast but I did not come
[47:10] for breakfast. The minister had called
[47:12] me he was outside of the country said no
[47:14] brother come and see me. So when I went
[47:16] there then they put the food in the
[47:19] table. They said, "Pastor Moses, join
[47:21] us." But I could feel it. How many can
[47:24] say amen?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; That the sister was not comfortable with
[47:27] me eating.
[47:29] So pastor Rodney, I just I I I was just
[47:32] fellowshipping. I was not eating. When
[47:34] the sister goes out to the kitchen, I
[47:37] remain eating. But when she comes, I
[47:40] could feel it's heavy. There's something
[47:43] wrong. How many I'm talking about
[47:45] declaration by silence.
[47:49] Pastor Eden, did you hear that?
[47:52] We are in the table there. The the
[47:54] people speak with their mouth. With
[47:56] their mouth.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; You are free, brother.
[47:59] Let's read this. I want to read
[48:01] something here. H in the message.
[48:10] There's something that I want to read
[48:11] here in Numbers. Let's go to numbers. We
[48:14] are moving well. Numbers chapter 30.
[48:18] Declaration by silence. Numbers chapter
[48:21] 30.
[48:23] Let's just go quickly. Numbers chapter
[48:26] 30.
[48:28] How many are with me?
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; How many see where I'm going?
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it says here, Numbers chapter
[48:34] 30.
[48:36] [Music]
[48:39] Numbers chapter 30. So, let's go there
[48:42] quickly. Numbers chapter 30.
[48:46] Let's start.
[48:47] from verse two. If a man vow a vow unto
[48:51] the Lord or swear an oath to bind his
[48:55] soul with a bond, he shall not break his
[48:59] word, he shall do according to all that
[49:03] proceedth out of his mouth. So when a
[49:05] brother vows a vow in the house to say
[49:08] maybe I want to do this for brother so
[49:10] and so I want to do this, he must do
[49:13] what he has found. But watch verse
[49:15] three. If a woman also vow a vow unto
[49:19] the Lord and bind herself by a bond
[49:23] being in her father's house in her youth
[49:27] like some of you brothers when your
[49:29] daughters vow a vow and those daughters
[49:32] are still under your your care watch
[49:35] what brother the scripture says and her
[49:38] father
[49:40] vow and and her bond wherewith she had
[49:44] bound her soul and her father shall hold
[49:49] his peace at her. Then all her vows
[49:52] shall stand and every bond wherewith
[49:56] sheath bound her so shall stand. But if
[50:01] her father disallow her in the day that
[50:05] he
[50:07] uh not any of her vows or of her bones
[50:11] wherewith she had bound her soul shall
[50:14] stand. and the Lord shall forgive her
[50:17] because her father disallowed her.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to see something. I'm
[50:23] talking about declaration by silence.
[50:25] So, brother, the scripture says if maybe
[50:29] pastor Denzel's daughter just speaks and
[50:32] say, "Oh, I want to take that micro. I
[50:35] want to take those dresses and give
[50:37] sister so and so. I can see I'm no
[50:39] longer fitting these dresses. Let me go
[50:41] give that sister." She vows a vow unto
[50:44] the Lord and Pastor Denel hears her
[50:48] vowing and keeps quiet. The Bible says
[50:52] that quietness
[50:54] he's he is concerning. He is agreeing.
[50:57] Do you hear what I'm saying? So if the
[51:00] the Bible says if the father keeps
[51:03] quiet,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; it's a declaration.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; How many hear what I'm saying?
[51:08] &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm saying declaration by
[51:10] silence.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if pastor Denzel hears it and
[51:14] said, "My daughter, no, don't give those
[51:18] dresses to her." The Bible says the vow
[51:21] will be disallowed.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; The vow will be what? So, but you see
[51:26] where I'm I'm heading to. Uhhuh. So, you
[51:29] say, "No, my father was quiet." That
[51:31] that quietness, huh, it's a concern.
[51:36] When the father is quiet, it's a sign to
[51:39] say go ahead and do whatever you want to
[51:42] do.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; So don't say ah no my father was just
[51:47] quiet. So are you seeing brothers
[51:49] &gt;&gt; that when you hear things and you keep
[51:51] quiet your silence hallelujah is a
[51:55] statement. Your silence is an
[51:58] announcement pastor declaration by
[52:01] silence.
[52:03] Hey,
[52:05] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go into doctrine, but
[52:08] there's something which I enjoyed in
[52:09] this, but it's not what I want to say.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; You know, he says if the man vows a vow,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; the wife or the daughter cannot disow
[52:19] that vow. But the wife, if she vows a
[52:22] vow and the daughter, the man can say
[52:24] no. I I I don't want to introduce
[52:26] things. How many can sisters please
[52:29] forgive me sisters for that? But I was
[52:32] just reading. I saw that. Hey. Yeah. So
[52:35] the man is the post.
[52:38] I said, "Lord, I'm happy to to see
[52:41] this." Amen. How many are being blessed?
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Declaration by what?
[52:47] &gt;&gt; By silence. Hallelujah. Amen. I wish one
[52:50] day I would preach
[52:53] and talk about that. So even in a church
[52:56] as well, the pastor hears something,
[52:58] people say, "Let's do this. Let's do
[52:59] this." that if the pastor keeps quiet
[53:01] then let it happen but if the pastor
[53:04] hears that and say no no no no how many
[53:06] can say amen
[53:09] &gt;&gt; and I also want to to drop this pastor
[53:12] Rodney I saw that in Egypt God sent
[53:16] Moses to go deliver the children of
[53:18] Israel and there was one man I want you
[53:21] to see one man that came and said to
[53:24] Moses you who made you our leader who
[53:28] made you our
[53:29] You killed a man in Egypt. You did this.
[53:31] And Moses and that man rejected
[53:35] &gt;&gt; and Moses.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; But when Paul comes now, he comes and
[53:39] say
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Moses whom Israel rejected.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to see
[53:46] &gt;&gt; there is what we call condemnation by
[53:49] representation.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; How many understand that?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; The condemnation by what? Listen, it was
[53:55] not the whole of Israel that rejected
[53:59] Moses. But it was one person that said,
[54:02] "I don't want what we don't want you.
[54:04] Who who sent you?" But Israel was what?
[54:07] Was quiet. So the quietness of Israel
[54:11] was a a sign that they were agreeing
[54:14] with this man.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; So I learned something that sometime we
[54:18] are in a minister's group as ministers
[54:20] and someone blast another minister. Oh
[54:23] my
[54:24] &gt;&gt; in a rude way and everything and then
[54:26] you are quiet.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God will you come down and say you
[54:30] ministers are we together pastor so and
[54:33] so that you blasted and ridiculed and
[54:37] but it was brother pastor so and so God
[54:39] will say but you silence.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; So one time someone was blessing another
[54:45] minister. I just said no brothers me
[54:47] it's not in me. I exited. I don't want
[54:50] to be what identified. How many can say
[54:53] amen?
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, pastor
[54:56] declaration. So when you see people
[54:59] backbiting the pastor, saying bad things
[55:01] about giving another brother, if you
[55:03] keep quiet, it's a sign of concern
[55:06] &gt;&gt; cuz it has happened in your presence and
[55:10] God will come and say Moses
[55:12] &gt;&gt; whom Israel rejected. So you hear God
[55:16] say brother so and so you you rejected
[55:19] brother. You said when did we reject?
[55:23] Then you said when a pastor came and
[55:26] spoke bad about Malachi 4 in the pit
[55:29] &gt;&gt; and you came to quiet and you saying you
[55:32] are humble.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; God will say Malachi 4 who was rejected
[55:37] in but it is just one person. Pastor I
[55:41] don't know why I'm saying this. How many
[55:43] can say amen?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; I'm just showing you the principles. I'm
[55:47] not saying that pastor, pastor, we
[55:50] pastor, we should be rooted. What?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; There are certain things
[55:54] &gt;&gt; that you can tolerate.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know like even in my church
[55:59] someone can preach, how many can say
[56:01] amen? And maybe say it is Elisha that
[56:05] went to heaven in a whalewind. It's a
[56:07] slip of a tongue. I know it's Elijah. I
[56:10] can't correct that. I just leave it. But
[56:12] when someone comes, how many can say
[56:14] amen?
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. and say brother is fake. He's a
[56:17] liar. Is what? And then we say amen. How
[56:20] many can say amen? God will come.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; I say refute word fellowship. You
[56:25] rejected my s.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Remember sister Weber someone came I
[56:31] this is coming fresh now. Since someone
[56:33] came he was blessing brother Brham. He
[56:35] was doing this and sister Weber stood up
[56:38] pastor Rodney and said no no no no I
[56:41] know William Bran. How many can say it's
[56:44] not like this? He's a man of God and
[56:46] sister was dying. How many she was sick
[56:50] and the angel of the Lord heard it
[56:52] &gt;&gt; and say thus say the Lord.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Go tell sister Weber that she's not
[56:57] going to what to die. Why? She did not
[57:00] keep quiet.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor and say there are
[57:04] certain things pastor that we can't
[57:06] tolerate.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you keep quiet, it's a sign of
[57:12] consent.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; You are agreeing.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; I come here and say no. If the sister is
[57:18] always challenging you do this, just put
[57:21] her away and marry another. And then you
[57:24] say, hallelujah. Praise God. Sisters are
[57:26] problematic. God will come
[57:28] &gt;&gt; and say you people you believe polygam.
[57:31] You say, but wait, sis, you were quiet
[57:34] when pastor Moses was preaching poly.
[57:36] You agreed with it. How many can say
[57:39] &gt;&gt; amen?
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Declaration by silence.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; I hope we are learning.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; How many things have we agreed to in our
[57:48] silence?
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Pastor
[57:54] can say
[57:55] &gt;&gt; no. I never
[57:57] I never said this. But why were you
[57:59] quiet?
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Even in a family group, they will blast
[58:04] your father. Your your your siblings
[58:06] will be blasting your father. in a
[58:08] family group and you keep quiet. You say
[58:10] no no no no you must give respect as our
[58:13] father don't talk like that
[58:15] &gt;&gt; then God honor you but if you keep quiet
[58:18] they will say you blessed your father in
[58:21] the group
[58:21] &gt;&gt; said but me is my brother but why were
[58:24] you quiet
[58:25] &gt;&gt; how many can say
[58:26] &gt;&gt; declaration by silence
[58:29] &gt;&gt; how many can say
[58:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying this
[58:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[58:36] &gt;&gt; look at he wanted to grab the kingdom
[58:40] Using silence declaration he told you
[58:43] know says please can you go and talk to
[58:47] Solomon and ask theite for wife to wife
[58:52] are we together and then went he said to
[58:55] Solomon you know can you give a huh to
[58:59] to Adonia and Solomon was very wise he
[59:04] says what are you asking the kingdom for
[59:08] adonia it was a silent declaration. Some
[59:11] people can what? Some people can show
[59:15] their intentions, their interest. How
[59:18] many can say amen?
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; If someone wants to be the pastor,
[59:22] pastor Rodney in your church, you can
[59:24] see that no, this one wants a one he
[59:28] wants to take over. Yes. Let's be
[59:30] honest. How many
[59:33] pastor
[59:34] &gt;&gt; if someone shows interest to take over
[59:39] he can come the style but now but she
[59:42] could not see that
[59:44] &gt;&gt; you know but Solomon he said no it's not
[59:47] about asking what forish he's asking the
[59:51] kingdom
[59:52] &gt;&gt; how many can say
[59:55] &gt;&gt; no I don't want to go how many can say
[59:58] I'm talking about declaration
[1:00:01] So we we must be sensitive.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; You can see my brother. Hey my brother,
[1:00:05] do you hear? You can see no something is
[1:00:08] happening here.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; So when he was asking for the wife of
[1:00:11] the father,
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; he was asking for for the kingdom.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; How many can say so Solomon was wise
[1:00:18] says no Adonia you have asked for your
[1:00:21] death. You are going to die for this.
[1:00:23] But when you just read you think Solomon
[1:00:26] was cruel. How can he do that? But it
[1:00:28] was a cool
[1:00:30] went into orchestrated. It was
[1:00:33] treasonous. How many can say amen?
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; But he did it in a subtle way. What am I
[1:00:39] saying? Declaration by silence.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right, friends?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Someone says the seventh seal is not
[1:00:49] open.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; You see where I want to finish now?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; When there was listen, it was thunders.
[1:00:57] It was silence in heaven. But standard
[1:01:00] on earth.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; During that silence something was
[1:01:06] happening.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Lord Jesus was coming
[1:01:11] down.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was the reason of the
[1:01:14] silence? Brother say that was the minute
[1:01:17] and the hour that the Lord would come
[1:01:19] down.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Can I hear that?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; So you hear someone say the seven seal
[1:01:24] is not opened. Where were you when it
[1:01:27] was opened? How many can say amen?
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal, how many can say was
[1:01:33] open but not to the public,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; but you and we are not public.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; if our gospel is hit, it is hid to them
[1:01:44] who are lost.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; How many say amen?
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; You need a password.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; For you to download the seven.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; When he was talking to other people, he
[1:02:00] was speaking in parables.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; But when he was talking now
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; to the elect. Are we together? It's a
[1:02:07] love letter,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; silent declaration.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Someone is reading one spoken word. Oh,
[1:02:14] I'm feeling good now.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; I hope corruption won't set in.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; When time is prolonged, corruption will.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; So, don't worry. I've got many services
[1:02:27] to go. So I have to to see how I just
[1:02:31] give few examples. How many can say
[1:02:33] amen?
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Someone read a quotation a spoken word.
[1:02:37] Two people the other guy said hey. The
[1:02:40] other guy said no this man I don't want
[1:02:42] to read these books again cuz this man
[1:02:44] in here who is preaching said I am a a a
[1:02:48] a crow. I'm a hog. I'm a crow. And then
[1:02:52] another one
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; who was reading the same spoken word. He
[1:02:56] said thank God.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; This man says
[1:03:00] [Applause]
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; declaration.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; God speaks in silence in a simple way.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; God hides and reveals himself in
[1:03:12] simplicity.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; So the seventh is seal. How many can say
[1:03:20] amen?
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Was revealed
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; but it was not revealed to the public
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; but it was revealed to the elect.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; It's like a love letter we read in
[1:03:31] between the lines.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Can I read this quotation quickly?
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know I was just putting my
[1:03:41] background.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I want you to see this. I
[1:03:46] enjoyed this quotation. spiritual food
[1:03:48] in Jerus. He says 65718.
[1:03:52] He says
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; then back out there at the beginning of
[1:03:58] the seven seals. It's 65 0718. I like
[1:04:02] this quotation paragraph 83. Then back
[1:04:05] out there, brother Denzel, he says at
[1:04:08] the beginning of the seven seals,
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; when those seven angels came down in
[1:04:14] that pyramid form, are you seeing it?
[1:04:17] stood there and told me to return back
[1:04:21] here and speak on those seven seals.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And he would be with me.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; He would show me what they were.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Says he would show me what they were.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; The lost things.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; He would show me what they were.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; The lost things. Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; I was praying the lost things in my
[1:04:50] church.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; I always thought it was sealed on the
[1:04:54] back of the book
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; and it would be something wasn't wrote
[1:04:58] in the book. Listen says I thought it
[1:05:00] was not something wrote in the book but
[1:05:03] it turned out that it was made known
[1:05:07] that he could not do that.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; It isn't something that's written in the
[1:05:12] book.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; It's something that's been
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; hid.
[1:05:17] It's something that has been what? Leave
[1:05:19] in the book.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Why? Silent declaration.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; He hides it.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall take one word from
[1:05:28] it or add one word. So it is a mystery
[1:05:34] that's been in the book in these seven.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Out of the what? Churches comes the
[1:05:42] seals. Yeah, he does.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Out of the seals comes the trumpets, the
[1:05:46] thunders. How many can say
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; you know the the seals is the history of
[1:05:51] the church ages.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; It has been hidden in the what? In the
[1:05:57] church edges.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; But what struck me, Pastor Tenzel, he
[1:06:05] says it was made known that he cannot do
[1:06:09] that. It isn't something that's written
[1:06:12] in the book, but it's something pastor
[1:06:15] Rodney that's been hid in the book.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; If our gospel is is hid, it is hid to
[1:06:23] them who are lost.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall take one word or add
[1:06:28] one word. So it's a mystery that's been
[1:06:31] in the book in these seven church ages.
[1:06:34] Each one of them produced a mystery.
[1:06:39] all about water baptism and all these
[1:06:41] things that they are fumbling about
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; so long
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; we read in between the lines
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; so there's something and then he says
[1:06:52] here it is the rising of the sun 654
[1:06:57] 18 it is the rising of the sun 30 he
[1:07:01] says he is the one who opened those
[1:07:05] seals
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; he is those seals For the whole word of
[1:07:09] God is Christ and Christ is the seals
[1:07:13] that was opened.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals then?
[1:07:18] Revealing Christ.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; How many say amen?
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; All the seven the purpose of the opening
[1:07:25] of the seven seals is to reveal Christ.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; We take people to church. Brother says
[1:07:33] we are supposed to take people to Christ
[1:07:36] and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:07:39] revealed.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; How many he never said Jesus but he said
[1:07:43] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; because Jesus is the body.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? But Christ is the
[1:07:52] anointing.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Christ is the logos that dwelt in Jesus.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus is only the body, but Christ is
[1:08:05] the anointing. Christ is the log ghost.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; So really when I was seeing this brother
[1:08:12] me, I just said, "Oh my hallelujah." The
[1:08:15] purpose of the opening of the seven
[1:08:18] seals is to reveal Christ.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together friends?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham preached a
[1:08:25] message. Are we together?
[1:08:28] Indictment. He said, "I indict this
[1:08:31] generation for crucifying who?" Christ
[1:08:34] aring
[1:08:37] on my own. I said, "Why was indictment
[1:08:40] preached after the SS were were were
[1:08:43] preached?" Indictment was not preached
[1:08:46] before the SES. But indictment was
[1:08:49] preached after the SES were preached.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Because if indictment
[1:08:55] was preached before the Zeus
[1:08:58] was going to be indicting what?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Because the seventh seal brings him
[1:09:03] back.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; It was the opening of the seven seals
[1:09:07] that brought Christ.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Through the opening of the
[1:09:12] seven seals. Hallelujah. The full word
[1:09:15] is born into manifestation.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this Jesus whom who
[1:09:23] was received in the heavens until the
[1:09:26] times of the restitution of all things.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; All these other messengers, how many can
[1:09:36] say amen? Were not mistaken for the Lord
[1:09:39] Jesus Christ.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; But why is it brother and Paul they were
[1:09:46] mistaken for the Lord Jesus Christ? Do
[1:09:48] you know why?
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; If you look at Luther, he was still
[1:09:52] smoking.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Others they knew
[1:09:55] in part, understanding in part. But I
[1:09:58] want to tell you that people who worship
[1:10:00] brother Brana, they are not far from the
[1:10:02] truth.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, we don't worship brother Brana. But
[1:10:05] the full word
[1:10:08] was veiled in him.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? That's why he
[1:10:13] says, "Huh, we have heard of many Elijah
[1:10:16] and Elijah's mantels, but the Elijah of
[1:10:20] this day is the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Because the word was in him.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I can show you that you know
[1:10:33] sometimes the Holy Spirit would just
[1:10:36] come and take over brother. One time
[1:10:40] brother was calling an himself. While he
[1:10:44] was calling an altar call, God came and
[1:10:47] took over and started speaking as if
[1:10:50] brother Brham was speaking in tongues.
[1:10:52] But it was God himself speaking.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Can I read that?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for that?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Can I read it quickly? Put it there.
[1:11:03] It's in the message. Looking at the
[1:11:05] unseen. I want you to see 590410.
[1:11:10] Hallelujah. We are moving so well now is
[1:11:13] in the message. Pastor Rodney, it struck
[1:11:16] me. Looking at the unseen. 5904
[1:11:20] 10. Let's go now. We start here. I know
[1:11:24] you'll catch it. Let me read quickly. He
[1:11:26] says, "Brother Branam has finished
[1:11:28] preaching, my brother. He's finished
[1:11:30] preaching my sister." Then he says while
[1:11:32] you are standing on your feet praising
[1:11:36] God, how many ones? He says you that
[1:11:40] raised your hands a while ago believes
[1:11:43] that God will hear my prayer for your
[1:11:46] salvation of your soul. Brother Brham
[1:11:48] says now come walking down here now as
[1:11:52] we sing I will praise him. Brother Brham
[1:11:55] says I will praise him. He says, "Come
[1:11:58] on, walk right down the aisles here now,
[1:12:04] right down to receive Jesus, Pastor."
[1:12:08] Then he says, "Keep your heads up.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Keep looking at the unseen."
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Then he says that little pulsation.
[1:12:17] Watch now in your heart. He says, "Come
[1:12:21] moving right on down." And then brother
[1:12:24] panam says is he pulsating to you?
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Watch now if you listen to the tape you
[1:12:32] can see the tone changing. Then he says
[1:12:34] here all of a sudden pastor esho he says
[1:12:38] I'm the lord
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; that raised up Christ from but it was
[1:12:43] brother
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; calling the altar call. But all of a
[1:12:47] sudden something comes to take over. He
[1:12:50] says, "I'm the Lord that raised up
[1:12:52] Christ from the grave. I'm the one that
[1:12:55] sent the Holy Ghost." This is no longer
[1:12:57] brother Brham.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm the one that keep the
[1:13:00] promise."
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Listen to this B.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "Brother Brham has nothing to
[1:13:06] do in this."
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; But is brother speaking?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "Brother brother has nothing to
[1:13:13] do in this."
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; It's not me
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; I'm reading here.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; He says brother has nothing to do in
[1:13:25] this.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He surrendered his life to me. It was
[1:13:30] not another sister or another brother
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; speaking in tongs. No. God came and took
[1:13:37] over and started speaking through
[1:13:40] brotherham.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Branham has nothing to do in
[1:13:44] this. He surrendered his life to me. I'm
[1:13:48] using his spirit. I'm talking through
[1:13:51] his lips.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; That's me. I'm the Lord. Come down.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; The prayer the altar call started by
[1:14:00] brother
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; but it ended.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; God calling himself.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; He says that me
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; come down. Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So that's why people you could
[1:14:17] understand them who misunderstood
[1:14:19] brother for Jesus
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; because it was too much.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; So we don't worship brother.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; We must defy
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; but it was what too much.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he will come and say good
[1:14:35] evening friends. You you think it's
[1:14:37] brother prana yet it's God himself.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Can I read another quotation? Yes. Can I
[1:14:43] read this quotation
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; in the message smiling church? You know
[1:14:49] I saw that hey we English people we are
[1:14:52] so blessed
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; because God did not come speaking
[1:14:56] French. He did not come speaking
[1:14:59] or I want to tell you that God in this
[1:15:02] generation he came speaking English.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; English is a special language. That's
[1:15:09] why when things are tough for me, I pray
[1:15:12] in English. How many? Then I see I know
[1:15:16] that the family spirit they did not go
[1:15:19] to school, they went to night school. If
[1:15:22] you pray in school, they will hear you.
[1:15:24] But if you pray in English, how many can
[1:15:27] say
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; I was in trouble one time. I prayed in
[1:15:30] English and God came down. How many can
[1:15:32] say
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; pastor Hallelujah. How many are going to
[1:15:37] pray in English?
[1:15:41] Oh man, I know you know people English
[1:15:44] is your language. But watch why I'm
[1:15:46] saying that. How many are ready?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; How many believe that God came speaking
[1:15:52] in English?
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Listen, in the morning, I see people are
[1:15:56] laughing now. When I'm in trouble, I
[1:15:58] pray in English.
[1:16:00] So smiling we say father God we are
[1:16:03] standing in the threshold of the
[1:16:05] greatest vindication of omnipotence
[1:16:07] which the world has never seen. How many
[1:16:10] can say amen
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; and God will come down.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Smile and change. Watch now. He says
[1:16:15] paragraph 13 34 if you can put it. He
[1:16:19] says then he arose up from the grave and
[1:16:24] ascend it on high. Watch now. Brother
[1:16:28] Brham says, "Are you there? Jehovah
[1:16:31] returning in the form of the Holy
[1:16:34] Ghost."
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; So you you think it was brother Brham
[1:16:37] who was creating squirrels. I want to
[1:16:39] tell you
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; a man cannot create.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Only God can create.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; It was God. In another quotation I saw
[1:16:48] brotherham says God the creator
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; who is now his church. God the creator
[1:16:55] who is now his judge.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; A man cannot create. I want to ask you
[1:17:01] who delivered the children of Israel.
[1:17:03] You will say it was God. No it was God
[1:17:06] in Moses.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Huh? But watch but God himself he spoke
[1:17:13] and said I am going to come down. I've
[1:17:16] seen how my children are suffering and
[1:17:18] after 400 years I will come down myself.
[1:17:23] But watch now after 400 years my brother
[1:17:26] the children of Israel they see a man
[1:17:29] with a crooked stick with a a wife and a
[1:17:32] small baby. And brother Brham said some
[1:17:34] people said where are you going Moses
[1:17:36] says I'm going to Egypt to do what? He
[1:17:39] says to take off.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; It was a oneman invention. How many can
[1:17:43] say I want you I want you to see
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; that it was no longer a man anymore but
[1:17:49] it was God in Moses
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; when he arrived there he said Pharaoh
[1:17:53] let my people go
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; did Moses save people it was no longer
[1:17:58] man speaking it was God in Moses
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; how many can say amen even the Bible
[1:18:05] says the lamb took the book and opened
[1:18:08] the seals
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; pastor Denzel where did you see the lamb
[1:18:12] opening the seals. Brother Brham says,
[1:18:15] "I went east to open the seven seals for
[1:18:19] God."
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; So the lamp was in William Brham. How
[1:18:24] many can say amen?
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Where did you see the lamp opening
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; the seals? Brother Brham says, "I went
[1:18:30] east to open the seven seals for God."
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Pharaoh let my people
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He arose up from the grave and
[1:18:43] ascended on high Jehovah
[1:18:46] returning in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:49] to live in his church among his people.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; He says glory Jehovah walking down
[1:18:57] through the churching
[1:19:00] the thoughts of the mind.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; So you you think it was brother is
[1:19:04] Jehovah deselling the thoughts of the
[1:19:07] mind. Jehovah healing the sick. Jehovah
[1:19:11] speaking through lips. Pastor Eshko till
[1:19:14] the man hasn't got no control of himself
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; like the that we had. Brother Pam did
[1:19:22] not have control of himself. What he
[1:19:24] says brotherham has nothing to do with
[1:19:26] this. I'm the Lord. I send the Holy
[1:19:28] Ghost. Brother did not could not control
[1:19:30] himself. And then he says Jehovah.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Can you highlight it? coming back in
[1:19:37] English and translating it.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Can you highlight it? Jehovah
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; coming what
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; pastor Jehovah come what
[1:19:52] inh
[1:19:56] coming back in what
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; not in your language in English. So
[1:20:01] that's why I pray in English
[1:20:06] coming what
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; and translating it.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; That's why you see the message is
[1:20:12] translated from English
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; into different languages because it was
[1:20:18] Jehovah coming back in what?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; English.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; And pastor me Jehovah coming back in
[1:20:26] English and translating it. He says I
[1:20:29] want a SP there. I want another one
[1:20:31] there. Who was that? Men cannot create.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; You wasn't a sign. Amen. That Jehovah
[1:20:40] come down to a prostitute. Rise up where
[1:20:45] she saw no down till the dogs won't look
[1:20:48] at her and wash her white as snow and
[1:20:52] give her a heart as pure as. Oh my.
[1:20:56] Jehovah taking a drunkard.
[1:21:00] laying there in the alley and the fly
[1:21:02] blows all over his mouth and making him
[1:21:06] preach the gospel.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ cleans his
[1:21:11] eyes.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say hallelujah?
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Silent declaration.
[1:21:22] So when you know when the seals were
[1:21:24] opened you know it was a silent
[1:21:27] declaration you know even Elijah huh
[1:21:30] when he was going to be raptured it was
[1:21:34] a silent declaration this is coming
[1:21:36] fresh it was not in my notes you know
[1:21:39] even the sons of the prophets are we
[1:21:42] together they knew that Elijah was going
[1:21:46] you remember Elijah Elishah could feel
[1:21:48] he started following what Elijah Elijah
[1:21:51] I was going to Beth. I went to G. He
[1:21:53] followed him. Says, why are you
[1:21:54] following him? They went to Jordan. They
[1:21:56] went to Jordan. Why? God himself
[1:21:59] silently spoke to Elijah that your time
[1:22:02] is come.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; So, we are not going to be taken by
[1:22:06] surprise.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; When when you are going, you are not
[1:22:09] going to be taken by surprise.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a silent
[1:22:14] announcement.
[1:22:16] It won't be like those news readers that
[1:22:19] will say you know the rapture that has
[1:22:23] been spoken of for 2,000 years is going
[1:22:26] to happen in December 25. No, it will be
[1:22:29] a silent announcement.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Just like Elijah, he could feel
[1:22:34] something is happening and Elisha could
[1:22:37] feel it and Elisha was following Elijah.
[1:22:41] And then when they passed by the company
[1:22:44] of prophets, the sons of the prophets,
[1:22:46] the sons of the prophets, they said,
[1:22:47] "You, do you know that your master is
[1:22:49] going to be taken away?" And Elisha
[1:22:51] said, "I know it. Keep quiet." Why? It
[1:22:55] was a silent
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; declaration by silence.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; That's why the singer said, "When you
[1:23:01] see me living right, when you see me
[1:23:03] coming to church, when you see me doing
[1:23:05] all these things, I'm getting ready to
[1:23:08] go. We are not going to be taken by
[1:23:11] surprise.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; We know something is happening.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; How many understand that
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; pastor ten pastor?
[1:23:20] We are not going to be taken by
[1:23:22] surprise.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; When the time of the rapture comes, you
[1:23:26] will know.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; How did Elijah know? How did Elijah
[1:23:30] know? How did the sons of the the sons
[1:23:33] of the prophets know? It's a declaration
[1:23:36] by silence
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; that God will just fix up that thing.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Go confess to that. Go confess that this
[1:23:44] is someone. Listen, there is a brother
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; who died in Tanzania. He was working,
[1:23:49] you know, to go buy cars and sell them.
[1:23:52] So, but before he died, I'm talking
[1:23:55] about declaration by silence.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; He went to the brothers that owed him
[1:24:00] money says you you owe me money. when
[1:24:03] are you going to pay back? The brother
[1:24:05] just said, "Oh, okay. I'm going to give
[1:24:07] you like this." And then he went where
[1:24:09] he owed people money. Just said,
[1:24:11] "Brother, can you forgive me? If I get
[1:24:14] money, I'm going to what? To to pay you
[1:24:17] back." And he went to the brothers and
[1:24:19] sisters that he wronged. He made peace
[1:24:23] with them. Made right and everything.
[1:24:25] After that, he got involved in an
[1:24:28] accident.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; What was that? You are not pigs. You are
[1:24:31] not dogs. We've got a soul where God
[1:24:34] speaks to us.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Say,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; you know, sometimes, pastor Rodney,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; I don't want to say this, but you, you
[1:24:44] are my friends. I tell you, sometimes I
[1:24:47] don't hear a voice. I don't hear
[1:24:49] anything, but I just tell my wife, I
[1:24:51] say, you know, so and so is going to go
[1:24:54] and say this. And for sure like that,
[1:24:57] the person calls and says, exactly. But
[1:25:00] I can't explain it. I'm talking about
[1:25:02] declaration by signing.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; We are supernatural people.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; I'm being honest.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; One time I was standing pastor wrote me
[1:25:11] with a me I don't normally want to talk
[1:25:13] about my I just want to talk the word
[1:25:16] but it happens that that's the sermon
[1:25:18] that I'm preaching. So one time I was
[1:25:21] with a a a brother you know a a a
[1:25:25] deacon. No it was a brother. Yeah. A
[1:25:27] simple brother. So I just looked like
[1:25:30] this. I saw a brother. I don't know what
[1:25:33] was happening like in the church. So I
[1:25:35] was talking to the brother on on a
[1:25:38] Monday. So I said hey I don't think
[1:25:41] brother so and so is going to come to
[1:25:43] church again. Pastor the brother said
[1:25:46] pastor Mo what are you saying? I said ah
[1:25:48] something you know I can't explain but
[1:25:51] that brother I don't think we are
[1:25:53] together anymore. While I said that the
[1:25:56] deacon called me right there. Then I put
[1:25:59] it on loudspeaker. The brother said that
[1:26:02] he said pastor please can you help that
[1:26:06] brother says that brother came to me he
[1:26:09] says he does not want to came to come to
[1:26:10] church anymore. That brother was
[1:26:12] shocked.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Pastor Moses how to deal we are we are
[1:26:16] super
[1:26:19] pastor when you see pastor Denz when you
[1:26:21] see pastor Rodney don't think that we
[1:26:23] are just no no no no God speaks.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Hey,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; God speaks to us.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; How many? We are supernatural beings.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Even you, sister. How many can say amen?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; I remember pastor George Martin, he told
[1:26:38] me, you know, sometimes brothers, may
[1:26:40] God help us. Sometimes God speaks
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; through our wives and sometimes we don't
[1:26:46] listen. We say, "No, I'm back again to
[1:26:49] support your sisters." Can you say amen?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You listen. Pastor George Martin a
[1:26:53] brother came and said he wanted to
[1:26:56] borrow pastor George Martin money then
[1:26:58] pastor George Martin wanted to give him
[1:27:00] sister George Martins just said no d can
[1:27:02] I see you just put him aside
[1:27:05] Martin said please brother George don't
[1:27:08] give this brother the money won't come
[1:27:11] please and sister George Martin said no
[1:27:13] no no I'm the head of the family this
[1:27:16] I'm going to give you this is an honest
[1:27:18] brother I said okay okay it's fine that
[1:27:21] They arrived when when the brother said
[1:27:24] he was going to pay back the money did
[1:27:25] not come until pastor George Mati died.
[1:27:28] Do you understand? So now the sister
[1:27:31] went and said did I not tell you? Did I
[1:27:34] not tell you? Yes, we are the head of
[1:27:36] the house but these are God's daughters.
[1:27:38] Sometime God does not only speak to
[1:27:40] brothers, he can also speak to sisters.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Say hallelujah.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Sometimes my wife comes and tells
[1:27:48] me things. How could you know it
[1:27:51] happens? How many can say
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about declaration by
[1:27:56] silence.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together friends?
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Huh? We are not prophets, Pastor Rodney.
[1:28:02] But we are supernatural.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God sometimes can reveal
[1:28:07] even things before they happen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; God speaks.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Can speak by the pit. He can speak when
[1:28:14] you are listening to the tape. He can
[1:28:16] speak when you are reading the Bible.
[1:28:18] Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Declaration.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Silent declaration that woman of Memphis
[1:28:25] that the son was dying. She was sick and
[1:28:29] he was she was reading. And then she saw
[1:28:33] it's exactly the setup and the scenario
[1:28:37] of her situation. And then she said, "I
[1:28:41] shunite.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Where is Elijah?"
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; What is that
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; declaration by silence? She was reading
[1:28:49] the story of the Shudamite.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about declaration by
[1:28:54] silence.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; We have overcome demons sometimes by
[1:28:58] reading the Bible, by listening to the
[1:29:00] tape, by reading the spoken word.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; God declares something.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; He can say, "Brother Andrews, you are
[1:29:09] healed of that house. Go home." And you
[1:29:13] you say, "Hallelujah." You hear a
[1:29:15] brother who is not called Andrew saying
[1:29:17] I'm healed. It's over. Why? A
[1:29:21] declaration by silence.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You can see a situation which is in the
[1:29:26] spoken word. How many can say amen?
[1:29:29] Which is exactly like your situation.
[1:29:31] It's God declaring that you are healed.
[1:29:35] It's over.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; The taps are supernatural. The spoken
[1:29:39] word are supernatural. I remember
[1:29:42] brother Babs I want to close now. He
[1:29:45] gave a a Muslim in prison a spoken word.
[1:29:49] Are we together? And there was the
[1:29:51] pillar of fire and the Muslim had a
[1:29:53] what? A spinal problem. And then while
[1:29:56] the Muslim was reading he the Muslim
[1:29:59] said he saw the pillar of fire coming
[1:30:02] out of the pages of the spoken word
[1:30:04] coming. The Muslim wanted to run away
[1:30:06] and then it came on his back. Touch his
[1:30:09] back. He was healed and a Muslim came to
[1:30:13] brother Peps and said, "Brother Peps,
[1:30:15] there's something in you know how
[1:30:16] brothers who used to tell us,
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; there's something in the book. There's
[1:30:20] something in this book."
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; We are not alone.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; This message is powerful.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; The son of man is here.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; We are in the age of the son of man.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; How many can say
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; hallelujah?
[1:30:37] I pray
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; that you receive your heart as desires.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Silent declaration.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Something must happen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes God's things,
[1:30:50] pastor, they happen in a silent way.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Great things happen in silence.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Remember Elijah, he saw fire, but there
[1:30:59] was no God. He saw an earthquake, but
[1:31:02] there was no God. But there was a small
[1:31:04] still voice. How many can say amen?
[1:31:07] Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you my friend that
[1:31:15] don't are we together?
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; You must keep secrets. I want to close
[1:31:20] now. Don't reveal everything.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Huh? Because you get yourself in
[1:31:25] trouble. Brother Brham says the devil
[1:31:28] cannot what? Get what is in your heart.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; But he waits for you to say it. That's
[1:31:34] why sometimes most of our plans they
[1:31:37] don't go through.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the devil hears it.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; I don't have time to read quotations.
[1:31:44] Brother Brham says you know the the
[1:31:46] first book it was impersonated. The
[1:31:49] second B it was impersonated. But when
[1:31:52] it came to the third B there was
[1:31:55] silence.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Brother says if the devil ever got
[1:32:01] a hold of that seventh seal, he says he
[1:32:04] was going to do great damage.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; So do you see that why the seventh seal
[1:32:09] is spoken in mysteries is because God
[1:32:13] wanted did not want the devil to know
[1:32:17] because the devil was going to do great
[1:32:19] damage. So if God can hide it so that
[1:32:23] his plans cannot be damaged, what about
[1:32:26] our plans?
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Everything about your life, you put it
[1:32:31] on Facebook.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to K.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to
[1:32:39] Australia, brother. That's why you are
[1:32:42] always in trouble.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; There will be great damage. How many can
[1:32:48] say amen? Can I read that for you?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; How many are being blessed?
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I hope you are not going to stone me.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; I also preach on Facebook. But you must
[1:32:58] understand
[1:33:00] always on review preaching. Hear me.
[1:33:03] American say I want you to see what
[1:33:05] brother Brandham says. Hey pastor
[1:33:08] Rodney. When I saw this quotation I said
[1:33:10] Lord help me. Listen, I know some of you
[1:33:14] pastors have seen it in the message 7.
[1:33:19] God bless you, Pastor Adrian. He says,
[1:33:22] "But here is seven straight thunders
[1:33:25] right in a row." 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 That
[1:33:29] perfect number. Seven thunders in a row.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 straight. Brother
[1:33:37] Brham knocked on the pulpit seven times.
[1:33:40] Then he says heavens could not write
[1:33:44] that heavens can't know about it.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Nothing else because there is nothing to
[1:33:52] go on.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; In another quote he says if a an angel
[1:33:56] made a move it might give away the
[1:33:58] secret. We must be secretive people.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Nations have got secrets. Churches have
[1:34:05] got secrets. Families have got secret.
[1:34:07] Don't just devout. How many can say
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; It was a relaxing time. It was so great
[1:34:17] till it was kept secret from the angels.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Now, pastor Denzel, why if Satan should
[1:34:26] get a hold of it, he might do great
[1:34:30] damage.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; There is one thing he don't know. Now he
[1:34:35] can interpret anything he wants to to
[1:34:38] impersonate any kind of a gift. I hope
[1:34:41] you are learning. But he can't know
[1:34:44] this. It's not even written in the word.
[1:34:47] It's a total
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; The angels everything shut up. If they
[1:34:53] made a move, it might give something
[1:34:56] away. So they just shut up, quit hopping
[1:35:00] and everything stopped.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Can I read this? Brother Branham says
[1:35:08] paragraph 258. Go to 258. Listen what
[1:35:12] Malachi 4 says. If you want something is
[1:35:16] brother Brham, not me. If you want
[1:35:18] something, huh? Now you will have if you
[1:35:22] want something to happen, you will have
[1:35:24] to take my word for this. If I'm
[1:35:28] planning on doing something, I know
[1:35:31] better than to tell anybody about it.
[1:35:35] Not that that person would tell it, but
[1:35:38] Satan will hear it.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; See, he can't get it in my heart there.
[1:35:46] As long as God has got it closed up
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Spirit. So that's between
[1:35:53] me and God. See, he don't know nothing
[1:35:57] about it until you speak it.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Then he hears it.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; I tell people, I will do a certain
[1:36:08] certain thing and watch the devil cut
[1:36:12] off every wheel he can to get there.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Do you think see to beat me to it? Yes.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; But if I get the revelation from God
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; and just don't say nothing about it,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; then it's different.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; You know what? I met the right of
[1:36:36] he said I must come inside. I'm a
[1:36:38] millionaire now. And the devil hears it.
[1:36:41] How many are saying
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; and they lose the election?
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; The TV is gone. You were talking too
[1:36:48] much. How many have seen deals slipping
[1:36:51] in their fingers? How many have seen,
[1:36:53] let's be honest, even myself, I lost a
[1:36:56] lot of things because of talking.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; You see, even Joseph, I want to bring
[1:37:00] this. Yes, he was going to go to to
[1:37:02] prison, but he was talkative. Number
[1:37:05] one, they hated him. He knew this person
[1:37:08] hate me. Then he comes, I saw you, you
[1:37:11] were bowing down to me. Hey, the Bible
[1:37:14] says they hated him the more Then he
[1:37:17] comes again says I saw seven stars they
[1:37:20] met. He was making it worse. How many
[1:37:24] can say
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Joseph was what?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And I also want to drop this pastor
[1:37:30] Rodley while we are here. Do you know
[1:37:33] that the devil does not use any other
[1:37:36] thing to attack you? You only have one
[1:37:39] temptation. Joseph had one temptation.
[1:37:43] All his problems that he went through,
[1:37:45] it was because of the jacket. How many
[1:37:47] knows that?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Because when they saw the jacket, they
[1:37:50] were envious. They were jealousy. Then
[1:37:52] they took that jacket as well. Tim took
[1:37:55] him blood. They said to the father,
[1:37:56] "Look at is this the jacket of your
[1:37:58] son?"
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see now? And then when he went to
[1:38:01] Portifa's house,
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; he went to prison because of the jacket.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; When Portifa's wife wanted to rape him,
[1:38:08] Joseph ran away and grabbed the jacket.
[1:38:12] Hey And when father general came from
[1:38:14] work, how many can say amen? There was a
[1:38:17] story there and generals and policemen
[1:38:20] and everything and poor Joseph just came
[1:38:23] and then he saw policeman standing
[1:38:24] there.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Hey, they said you I want the police
[1:38:28] said, "Can you answer me yes or no?"
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; We are not talking about rape and what
[1:38:33] but answer me. Is this your jacket? Yes
[1:38:36] or no? When Joseph said, "That's my
[1:38:39] jacket." He went to hell. He went to
[1:38:41] prison. How many say amen?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; So his all problems and everything it
[1:38:47] was the
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; So brother says you must guard where
[1:38:51] your temptation where your weak point is
[1:38:54] guard it. Put more there.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Some people even when they repent it's
[1:38:59] just cigarettes. It's just cigarettes.
[1:39:02] Even if someone comes and preach from
[1:39:04] Zimbabwe others come and preach from
[1:39:06] Namibia when he comes to the altar it's
[1:39:09] cigarettes. How many
[1:39:12] is temper, someone is women, someone is
[1:39:15] money. So the devil won't waste time. He
[1:39:18] will just come where you have got a
[1:39:21] weakness.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; How many can say?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; So we see Joseph his problems on the
[1:39:27] jacket.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; So don't devout things. Are we together?
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; I want to read my last scripture. I want
[1:39:35] you to see what happened in the Bible. I
[1:39:38] liked that 1st Samuel 10:16. Let's go
[1:39:42] there quickly. How many are being
[1:39:44] blessed?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. So the seventh seal
[1:39:49] was revealed in silence. So we the
[1:39:52] children of God, we know what it is.
[1:39:54] That's why he always speaks in parables
[1:39:57] so that other people won't catch it. He
[1:39:59] says 1st Samuel chapter 10. Amen. 1
[1:40:03] Samuel chapter 10.
[1:40:05] Hallelujah. 1st Samuel chapter 10 verse
[1:40:09] let's start from
[1:40:11] verse 15. Hallelujah.
[1:40:14] You must have tell your neighbor and say
[1:40:17] you must have information management.
[1:40:21] Don't just reveal things.
[1:40:24] Tell your neighbor you must have
[1:40:25] information what?
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I once preached a message
[1:40:30] information management. He says now and
[1:40:33] Saul's he says and Saul's uncle said
[1:40:36] tell me I pray thee what Samuel said
[1:40:40] unto you. We we know the story. Saul had
[1:40:44] gone and he was anointed to be the king
[1:40:46] over Israel. So when he was coming back
[1:40:49] his uncle was suspicious
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; and then he says where we are tell
[1:40:55] I pray thee what Samuel said unto you.
[1:40:59] Verse 16. and saw said unto his uncle,
[1:41:02] listen to this, he told us plainly that
[1:41:07] the asses were found,
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; but of the matter of the kingdom, where
[1:41:15] Samuel spake, he told you not.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Brother, do you see now?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; So now, so he told his uncle plainly
[1:41:26] about the asses. He says the asses were
[1:41:30] found plainly.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together? But the matter of the
[1:41:34] kingdom, he did not say it. I want you
[1:41:37] to see the first seal. It was explained
[1:41:40] by brother Brham plainly. How many can
[1:41:43] say
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; the white horse rider is the antichrist
[1:41:46] is the blainly.
[1:41:49] The second s it was said plainly. How
[1:41:52] many can say? says the same rider, are
[1:41:55] we together? He's now on the red horse.
[1:41:58] He's now using political power. And then
[1:42:00] when he came to the seventh to the third
[1:42:02] seal, he said it plainly
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; says a measure of wheat for a penny. Are
[1:42:07] we together? He was now using a demon
[1:42:10] power. Are we together friends? The
[1:42:13] fourth is he comes on a pale horse. He
[1:42:16] was now what? A mixture of white, red
[1:42:19] and black. It was dead now. Are we
[1:42:22] together friends? Yeah,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; it was explained plainly. The fifth seal
[1:42:26] was explained plainly. Souls in the all
[1:42:30] those things. The sixth seal plainly.
[1:42:32] But when it came now to the seven,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; yes sir,
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; they were silent.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Why? It's the matter of the kingdom. Can
[1:42:41] you see? Even in Zimbabwe in 2008, we
[1:42:45] are not in Zimbabwe. We are talking. How
[1:42:47] many can say in the harmonized elections
[1:42:50] where people were voting for the MPs for
[1:42:53] the counelors for the president. So now
[1:42:56] they after the elections when they were
[1:42:58] explaining those who won the
[1:43:00] parliamentary elections they explained
[1:43:03] so and so one in har they were saying it
[1:43:06] plainly those who won who became
[1:43:08] counselors were explained plainly
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; but the matter of the kingdom it took
[1:43:14] more than 3 months to explain the
[1:43:16] results it's the matter of the kingdom
[1:43:20] how many can say amen you don't devouge
[1:43:22] the matter of
[1:43:25] How many can say amen?
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; How many are learning?
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; How many are going to to silent
[1:43:32] declaration?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The 70 has been revealed.
[1:43:36] Are we are we together friends? So I
[1:43:39] just want to leave you with one
[1:43:42] quotation that I believe is going to be
[1:43:45] a blessing and then we call pastor
[1:43:48] pastor Adrien. How many were blessed?
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Silent declaration. How many are ready
[1:43:53] for this quotation?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; I just saw it. I just felt. Let me end
[1:43:59] with this one.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Silent declaration. Let's see what
[1:44:06] brother Brham says here. I believe it's
[1:44:09] going to uplift somebody.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:14] Amen.
[1:44:16] So, you want to see what
[1:44:20] the prophet says here.
[1:44:24] Amen.
[1:44:33] Yes. So he says here in the message he
[1:44:36] was to pass this way. We can put it
[1:44:38] there. He was to pass this way. 570727.
[1:44:43] That's my last quotation. So he says
[1:44:46] here maybe let's begin here. He says
[1:44:50] blessed Lord. So this is the prayer
[1:44:53] brother Brham is praying. So you
[1:44:55] personalize this prayer. Hallelujah.
[1:44:57] It's your prayer. He said, "Blessed
[1:44:59] Lord, no man can come to me, say the
[1:45:03] Lord, except my father draws him
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; God." He says, "You knocked at the heart
[1:45:11] of the door. Four or five people in this
[1:45:15] room this morning." And then let's jump.
[1:45:18] And then he says, "You know them, God.
[1:45:21] May from this hour on."
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Huh? He's talking about you, my brother.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; May from this hour on, Brother Eshko.
[1:45:29] Huh? May they live so godly.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; May they go home. May they go to their
[1:45:37] place of business. How many business
[1:45:39] people here? Don't be ashamed. That's
[1:45:42] yours. May they go to the place of
[1:45:46] business. These men that raised their
[1:45:50] hand, I want to see men raising their
[1:45:52] hands.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he says, these
[1:45:55] women that raise their what?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Heads, may they go as a changed person.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, pastor, pastor, may their
[1:46:06] influence
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; be great in the city
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; where they live.
[1:46:12] May your influence, May the influence of
[1:46:14] this church be great in K.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, Pastor Adrian, may this church have
[1:46:21] so much impact.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May their influence be
[1:46:26] greater in the city where they live.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; May you bless them and prosper them in
[1:46:33] whatever they do.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; If they are in business, are you there
[1:46:38] pastor Rodley? Grant that their business
[1:46:42] will grow
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; and be greater
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; you might not be you might be a pastor
[1:46:49] and you are not in a business but your
[1:46:51] church that's your business you are in
[1:46:53] your father's business may God
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; bless your ministries that's my prayer
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; pastor me pastor Ishko pastor Denel
[1:47:03] Pastor Rodney I pray that may God bless
[1:47:06] your ministries
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:47:09] May your business grow and be greater.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; They got a new partner.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Why is it your business is going to
[1:47:21] grow? They got what? A new partner this
[1:47:24] morning.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; If you partner the angel of the Lord,
[1:47:27] you'll be healing secrets. You'll be
[1:47:29] healing the sick. How many can say amen?
[1:47:32] They got a what?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; A new partner this morning. the king of
[1:47:37] kings. We go further. Let them remember
[1:47:42] Mr. B of the fruit.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; So Mr. Paul was dealing in jail.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; So what are you dealing with? Put your
[1:47:50] name there. Personalize it.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; If it is not now then where?
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; If it is not you then who?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; If it is not here then where my brother
[1:48:00] remember. Oh pastor Denzel.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; This is about you. Your business that
[1:48:05] you showed me, may it be great.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; May you have branches in Bloomington,
[1:48:10] branches in how of the same business.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Some people think pastor Moses is just
[1:48:17] speaking. There is power in words.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Even right now as I speak, may God bless
[1:48:26] you.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; May you receive your heart's desires.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Don't leave that
[1:48:32] building with your situation.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus is here.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Tell him what you want.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; let them remember Mr. B of the fruit
[1:48:44] jar. Let them remember Mr. Craft of the
[1:48:48] cheese.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; This one was dealing with cheese.
[1:48:52] How that he couldn't make a go of his
[1:48:55] cheese. Maybe you are struggling in your
[1:48:57] business. You can't make a go. Brother
[1:49:00] Brham says, "And one day, hallelujah,
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; a voice spoke to Mr. G. Craft,
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; a voice spoke to him and said, "Take me
[1:49:12] for your partner."
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; A voice is speaking tonight in whatever
[1:49:17] business you are doing, take me for your
[1:49:19] partner.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Take me for your partner.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Huh? Huh?"
[1:49:27] Many of the others Colgate.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; When they took Jesus as their partner,
[1:49:34] things changed.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; May it be with them. Lord,
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; may this happen here.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:49:45] today, and forever.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; How did become great? Jesus Christ is
[1:49:50] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:49:54] This is the season where God is going to
[1:49:57] magnify you. Do you believe it?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord is here.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen?
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; How many are going to take him as a
[1:50:06] partner?
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; How many are going to take him as a
[1:50:09] partner?
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Will you will you be my partner?
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Not me, Pastor Moses. The Lord Jesus
[1:50:16] Christ. Pastor Matthew, he's saying take
[1:50:19] me for your partner.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Take me for a partner. How many can say
[1:50:23] amen?
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Once in a while your partner must come.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if you are if you are
[1:50:30] like in a business and it's payday and
[1:50:34] you don't have pay to pay the servants.
[1:50:36] What are you going to do? You call your
[1:50:38] partner.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Say my friend
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; I don't have money anymore.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Then he said how much is the wage bill?
[1:50:45] Just say 50,000 rand says it's done.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Your partner just throws it. What about
[1:50:51] the Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; I'm saying he is your partner.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Take him for a partner. Remember Mr.
[1:50:59] Paul of the fruit. Remember Mr. Craft of
[1:51:04] the cheese.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; How many business people are here?
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to take him for your partner
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; starting from today.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; If you were struggling, if you were
[1:51:14] doing whatever you were doing without
[1:51:16] Jesus being your partner, what about
[1:51:19] right now? How many are having him as a
[1:51:22] partner? Even in my ministry when I came
[1:51:25] here to Ken, he's my partner. I'm not
[1:51:28] scared. I'm not afraid.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; When people need to be healed, how many
[1:51:32] can say amen?
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; He will come and heal them.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; He is your partner.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; He preached a powerful sermon at
[1:51:40] we were so blessed. I could see it's not
[1:51:43] pastor Adrian. It's his partner bringing
[1:51:46] the anointing. How many can say amen?
[1:51:48] How many are going to take him as your
[1:51:50] partner?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; How many are going to take him as your
[1:51:53] partner?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Let's stand upon our feet.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Bless you.
[1:51:59] [Applause]
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; New things are being declared.
[1:52:09] I know very soon
[1:52:11] I'll be raptured.
[1:52:14] The angel of God is here.

[1:52:22] thy invisible

[1:52:27] inconceivable
[1:52:29] faith to believe for the possible
[1:52:34] oh in this new day.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; One more time.
[1:52:44] I know very soon I'll be raptured out of
[1:52:49] here. The angel of God is here
[1:52:54] so
[1:52:57] the invisible
[1:52:59] inorable
[1:53:01] inconceivable
[1:53:03] faith to live for the impossible

[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; One more time.
[1:53:14] Kings are being declared.
[1:53:17] I will soon I'll be raptured out
[1:53:23] of God

[1:53:29] being invisible
[1:53:31] [Music]

[1:53:35] to believe the impossible
[1:53:40] in this new day.
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:44] One more time
[1:53:45] [Music]
[1:53:49] soon. I'll be raptured out there

[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; As we bow our heads, are you there my
[1:54:17] brother?
[1:54:19] declaration by silence.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Where two or three are gathered, he will
[1:54:24] be there in their midst.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; I feel his presence.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; I feel his anointing.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; I believe that we are not alone.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister,
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; I don't care your situation.
[1:54:41] You might be sick. You might have gone
[1:54:44] to the doctors. I want to tell you
[1:54:48] Jehovah Rafa is here.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Those who are in need
[1:54:54] is here.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; He's going to manifest himself
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; in the seven redemptive names.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know your situation.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about silent
[1:55:07] declaration.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord is here. Brother
[1:55:14] Brham says wheresoever the angel of the
[1:55:17] Lord the message is preached the pillar
[1:55:20] of fire will be there in attendance.
[1:55:24] Hallelujah.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; I believe that we are we are not alone.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know your situation
[1:55:32] if you can have faith something is going
[1:55:35] to happen. Amen.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Are you there, my brother, my sister,
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; to say, "Pastor Moses, I've got an
[1:55:42] unspoken request."
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Even if you have an unspoken request,
[1:55:48] prayer changes things.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Prayer is more powerful
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; than an atomic bomb.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; I just want to offer a prayer of faith.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; So that Jesus
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; can come down.
[1:56:04] We want to hear testimonies.
[1:56:06] Will you raise your hand and say,
[1:56:09] "Pastor Moses, I believe the word."
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; I believe the message of Malachi 4. I
[1:56:16] believe that new things are going to be
[1:56:19] declared in my life.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; I believe the prayer of brother Brana.
[1:56:25] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:56:29] today, and forever. What he did to Mr.
[1:56:32] craft. If he cannot do it to you, it
[1:56:35] means he was wrong when he blessed Mr.
[1:56:38] Craft. If he blessed Mr. Mr. Paul and
[1:56:42] Mr. Cage, my brother, my sister, may
[1:56:46] something happen. I don't care what it
[1:56:49] is. Whether it's HIV, whether it's
[1:56:52] cancer, whether it's a chronic disease,
[1:56:55] I want to tell you that burdens are
[1:56:58] lifted at Calvary. The angel of the Lord
[1:57:01] is here.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Whether you are not satisfied with your
[1:57:06] salary, I want to tell you promotion
[1:57:10] does not come from the east, does not
[1:57:12] come from the west, but promotion comes
[1:57:15] from above.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you whether it's
[1:57:19] physical, whether it's financial,
[1:57:22] whether it's material, whatever you are
[1:57:25] looking for, Jesus is here. The seventh
[1:57:28] seal has been opened.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is the end of the
[1:57:34] struggling nature. Is the end of this?
[1:57:38] Is the end of your poverty.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Is the end of your sickness?
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; How many believe?
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; How many believe?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; That Jesus is here.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Your life will never be the same again.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[1:57:57] Lord Jesus,
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; the same yesterday, today and forever,
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; the bright and morning star,
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; the lily of the valley,
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; You said where two or three are
[1:58:10] gathered, he will be there in their
[1:58:11] midst. Lord, we did not hear from a man,
[1:58:14] but from the unfailing body of the son
[1:58:18] of man.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Lord God Almighty, when we started, you
[1:58:21] said you don't know what God has
[1:58:23] commanded. Lord God Almighty, I don't
[1:58:26] know what you have commanded to your to
[1:58:29] your children. I don't know what you
[1:58:32] have commanded to these brethren.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Lord God Almighty, those who are sick,
[1:58:38] may you heal them, Lord, in the name of
[1:58:40] Jesus Christ. Those who are in need, you
[1:58:43] are Jehovah Gyra. Abraham said, "My son,
[1:58:47] my God, we would deliver himself a
[1:58:50] sacrifice." Lord God Almighty, we thank
[1:58:53] you. We magnify your name. We glorify
[1:58:55] your name. Those who are sick, those who
[1:58:58] are afflicted, we believe that the angel
[1:59:01] of the Lord is in the neighborhood.
[1:59:03] Father God, may you heal the sick. May
[1:59:07] you raise the dead. May something
[1:59:09] happen, Lord. Father God, those who are
[1:59:12] seeking for jobs, my Lord and my God,
[1:59:16] may you undertake for them. Those who
[1:59:19] are looking for permits,
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Father God, may you sort them out
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:59:26] Christ. Those who are seeking for
[1:59:28] promotions, may you bless them. May you
[1:59:31] bless the ministries here. May you bless
[1:59:33] Pastor Rodney. May you bless Pastor
[1:59:36] Denzel. May you bless Pastor Eshko. May
[1:59:39] you bless my friend, brother M. May you
[1:59:42] bless the local pastor, Pastor Ed. May
[1:59:46] you raise his ministry.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Father God, may you begin to magnify his
[1:59:51] ministry
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:59:54] Christ.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; May the ministry be accompanied with
[1:59:58] signs and wonders.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; In the spirit of revelation,
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Lord God Almighty, I pray committing
[2:00:04] each and everything into your precious
[2:00:06] hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:00:11] is the pastor comes.
[2:00:14] I
[2:00:18] know
[2:00:22] I belong
[2:00:25] to worship
[2:00:28] you
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:35] and
[2:00:39] I long
[2:00:41] to worship. Worship me. Sing it.
[2:00:50] [Music]
[2:00:55] How we long to worship
[2:01:00] you.
[2:01:03] [Music]
[2:01:08] Lord,
[2:01:11] I come to worship
[2:01:16] you.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I don't bless
[2:01:21] the word of the Lord.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We can truly say our
[2:01:26] cup runth over.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The Lord has been
[2:01:30] gracious to us
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; to speak to our needs. Amen.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, God works through
[2:01:36] supernatural ways.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus even told him, "It's not I that
[2:01:42] doeth the works."
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; But my father that dwelleth in me.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; So the words that are coming out of your
[2:01:48] mouth,
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; the words that you are speaking,
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; it's God speaking through you.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember the
[2:01:56] testimony of Sister Wright.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We all know how powerfully she
[2:02:01] spoke. But can you imagine being in that
[2:02:04] room
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; the testimony hearing the testimony
[2:02:07] about the squirrels
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; and she was agreeing and said that's
[2:02:11] exactly right
[2:02:13] [Music]
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; now she was put under pressure whatever
[2:02:18] you ask right now
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; she had a few moments to think
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; a natural ability would have made her
[2:02:26] speak to us for Edith right healing
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; or for a briefcase of
[2:02:32] But watch God turn the situation around.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; How many of you know who spoke through
[2:02:37] Atright?
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; I just want to close with this porch.
[2:02:40] Let's see who spoke through at Wright's
[2:02:43] lips.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; If you got the porch, you can put it up.
[2:02:47] He says, "Little at Wright sitting in
[2:02:48] the back of the building with the heart
[2:02:50] of the things of the world. She was
[2:02:53] believing." She said, "Brother Brandham,
[2:02:54] that's nothing but the truth." She
[2:02:56] didn't say from here.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; God spoke out of her mouth.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Declaration through silence.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; When we don't know what to speak,
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; he will speak.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Look at that. He says
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; God spoke out of her heart.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. So, who is really
[2:03:18] speaking through the bride?
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; She'll be the final voice to the final
[2:03:21] age.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Declaration by silence.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's sing holy
[2:03:26] forever as we just worship the Lord.
[2:03:28] Amen. I know time is gone. Amen. We just
[2:03:31] want to worship him with a song and then
[2:03:33] we can Amen. Just pray and then we'll be
[2:03:36] dismissed.
[2:03:38] Thousand generations
[2:03:42] falling down in worship
[2:03:46] to sing the song of ages to the land.
[2:03:50] [Music]
[2:03:53] And love is gone before us.
[2:03:57] And all who will believe
[2:04:01] will sing the song of wages to the land.
[2:04:06] I sing your name.
[2:04:08] Your name is the highest. Your name is
[2:04:14] the greatest. Your name
[2:04:18] it stands above them all.
[2:04:23] All
[2:04:25] and dominions,
[2:04:27] all of
[2:04:29] possessions, your name
[2:04:33] stands above them all and the angels
[2:04:38] cry.
[2:04:40] Holy
[2:04:44] all creation cries.
[2:04:48] Holy.
[2:04:51] You are lifted high,
[2:04:56] holy,
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:04:59] holy forever.
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's do that second verse.
[2:05:09] If you've been forgiven,
[2:05:12] if you've been redeemed,
[2:05:16] sing the song forever to the land.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, this bride walks in freedom.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; And if you walk in freedom,
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We be his name.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus Christ. Sing forever to the
[2:05:33] land. Oh yes,
[2:05:37] we'll sing the song forever and amen.

[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Father we see that word no longer just
[2:08:03] being the revealed word
[2:08:06] but the revealed word has now become the
[2:08:08] manifested word.
[2:08:11] Go where you are now. Oh God,

[2:08:29] people whom you have prepared for your
[2:08:30] name, oh God. People, oh God, who you
[2:08:33] have built up from faith, oh God, all

[2:08:56] you, Jesus.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, be lifted up, oh God.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; You told that woman at the well that you
[2:09:06] were looking for a time. The father was
[2:09:08] looking for a time.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; And this is the time where true
[2:09:11] worshippers
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; can worship in spirit and in truth.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; People that know their God will do great
[2:09:18] exploits.

[2:09:44] You may know about it.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:09:50] This man felt he was walking alone.
[2:09:53] He was looking at footprints.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; And he saw one set of footprints.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Little did he know in that silence,
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; It was not his footprints.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.

[2:10:10] Christ.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Amen.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; And he heard the voice of the Lord tell
[2:10:13] him, "It was in those moments."
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; It was in your lowest moments when you
[2:10:19] felt alone.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; That I carried you.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; I was watching over you.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; I carried you through all your trials,
[2:10:28] through all your sicknesses, through all
[2:10:29] your disease. In the silence, powerful
[2:10:32] declarations were made.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll call our pastor Ronnie
[2:10:36] forward. Amen. To come and bring the
[2:10:38] service to a close.

[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads and close
[2:10:55] our eyes. Dear Lord Jesus, as we come to

[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have discerned our hearts
[2:11:14] tonight.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; You know exactly what we needed.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; You know the areas
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; where we are lacking, where

[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; are weak. Amen.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; And your word, Father, can bring
[2:11:28] strength.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Deep encouragement, oh Lord,
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; that we can walk and run this race.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Under your divine guidance, under your
[2:11:38] divine leadership, Lord.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.

[2:11:43] Father.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; We take you as our
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; tonight, Lord. Declaration by silence.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And even as my brother
[2:11:55] started showing Lord this this widow
[2:11:58] woman father didn't know that she was
[2:12:01] chosen.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; She didn't know that she was elected.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; She didn't know that she was handpicked
[2:12:07] by God.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Like every one of us, oh God.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Handpicked by you.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; But we didn't know. And we walked so
[2:12:15] many years in ignorance, oh God.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; But it took an Elijah, oh God,
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; to awaken us to the great truth. bring
[2:12:24] us to a realization, Father, that
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; we're not called just to live in this
[2:12:28] earthly economy,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; but Lord, to raise us into a faith.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Faith economy, Father.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; And Father, we know our final
[2:12:46] destination is in you. Lord,
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; but Lord, our earthly life is declared
[2:12:51] in silence, oh God. because every day it
[2:12:54] is unfolding Lord

[2:13:22] sun rises oh God and he draws millions
[2:13:25] and cars of waters oh God without a
[2:13:28] single sound oh God
