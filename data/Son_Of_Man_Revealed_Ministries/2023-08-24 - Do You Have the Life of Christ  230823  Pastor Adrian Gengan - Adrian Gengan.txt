TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thought that will try to exalt itself against the knowledge of Jesus and father I pray the spirit of Christ will move from Heart to Heart Lord searching out the reins of our hearts oh God trying to find that Abiding Place oh God to reproduce the life of Jesus Christ oh God I pray Lord that you'll come now father and even as the prayer requests have gone forth and Lord we know your healing power has already gone forth to stretch forth the hand to heal o God to deliver and restore we thank you for it in Jesus name we ask His blessings now amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen our Lord and King whom we are looking forward to see with our physical eyes amen hallelujah amen that's how blessed hope and promise amen so greet you all I pray that you all are well and trusting the Lord amen looking forward to the coming of the Lord amen let's turn to Galatians chapter four of us uh we'll start at verse 19 there just one portion of scripture there Galatians 4 19. he says my little children of whom I trivale in birth again until Christ be formed in you you see the faithful Ministry is laboring to bring forth the Life of Christ so the Apostle Paul is saying my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you now you don't know what it is like on a minister amen because you as an individual all you have to worry about is yourself but to the ministry has been given charge over the flock of God and God commanded us to feed the Lambs and to feed the sheep and if you read Ephesians 4 there you'll see the responsibility placed upon the faithful Ministry to bring the body to perfection in the unity of Faith so there's a great burden upon the preachers amen upon the five-fold ministry so therefore we ought to be praying for the fivefold ministry amen and bring them before the Lord and never be critical over them but rather commit them in prayer before the Lord amen hallelujah so they are travailing in birth until Christ is formed in you and sometimes you want to continue in life your own way but you notice the sword is coming to shape you amen so Christ be formed in you so Colossians 1 27 verse 28 and 28 there also says Colossians 1 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles so get his thought now there's a glorious mystery amongst the Gentiles and he does the riches of Christ and it this mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory and Romans 8 10 one more portion will just read that Romans 8 10 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness amen and then we would just want to focus on what that spirit is in Galatians 5 22 this is the fruits of the spirit Galatians 5 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love Joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance so this is how Jesus was Jesus had love he had joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness and Temperance amen you may be seated so I just want to title this in the form of a question do you have the Life of Christ amen it's an important question to ask because he'll only Unite with those that have his life in this time in this day do you have the Life of Christ amen hallelujah so the lord gave his word in the beginning and he's been looking for a woman who would believe his word because through the woman came to fall yet through another woman came the perfect Son of God who would be the perfect Lamb of God that would take away the sin of the world Amen and in Genesis 3 you'll find the first type of woman there and the Lord is giving a prophecy in Genesis 3 15 and he's telling her I'm going to put enmity between thee and between thee and the woman talking to the serpent now between thy seed and her seed now we know that the woman doesn't have a seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel we know this is the first prophecy given about a coming savior about a coming Messiah amen hallelujah the seed of the woman Now watch how God never disclosed to Satan his plan but he put it there in mystery Satan was least expecting for a virgin-born woman to be a son [Laughter] for Adam to speak the word and Eve would have conceived amen so that is why if you trace the line he's always after the seed of God he's trying to get after Jacob he's trying to get after Joseph and he's trying to murder ugly lineage let me tell you if he killed all of them Jesus would have still come forth because Jesus didn't rely on a natural lineage you see how he Bluffs Satan he could have killed every one of them but Jesus came by the spoken word Satan got taken unawares amen hallelujah so we find the first type of woman there the one who just believed then we find another woman that we read in Genesis 18 and even her it took a while to get her to believe she had to get away from all doubt and reasoning and even the Laughing within a heart and even seeing the discernment she even lied to God's face and said I did not laugh telling God I did not laugh and the prophet says that God would have killed her for it but because he already spoke the word and said through you shall come forth the promise seed and because she was a part of Abraham he couldn't touch her life same reason he could not kill Eve amen then we find in Luke 1 30 hear the angel of the Lord finds a woman and the angel tells you have found favor with God you're a different kind of woman Mary amen and he says be old Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great I'm glad I have a great Jesus he shall be called a son of the highest amen and the Lord God shall give him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob of and of his kingdom there shall be no end then Mary said unto the angel how shall it be seeing a No-No man and the angel answered and said the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore the holy thing which is shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God right then he reveals about John the Baptist and here 38 is where I want to get to and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word I want you to know this has been the response of you and I when we heard the message of the hour we didn't reason with the prophet's word everything that he said we said be down to me now one reason with the word which was Eve one had to be convinced after she left within herself before she believed but like we said Mary was another type of a woman she was a pure virgin woman who believed the Angel's word as soon as she heard it and that's the kind of response God wants from his bride now from all the women God could have chosen to write a letter to or type us to when he's writing a letter to the bride remember one night the prophet has a vision or the Lord tells him pick up your pen and write of all the women he types Mary let's read that a bit he says then the harmony of the father and son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed to him by the father he's saying that for a point to show you that the harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride because what kind of a home would it be if the husband and wife are not in harmony it would be a chaotic home amen he shows uh his Word of Life she receives it now what is the word what is a seed she receives it she never doubts it not like Eve therefore nothing can hammer not even death amen for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again now here is the secret of it the word is in the bride as it was in Mary not as it was in Eve not as it was in Sarah the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride is the mind of Christ for she knows what he once done with the word Mary knew what he wanted done with the word amen Hallelujah she performs the command of the Lord in his name for she has thus said the Lord I'm waiting for a prophetic Prophet to come along and and Proclaim that said the Lord who has thus saved the Lord some are waiting for a return Ministry some are studying the messages and typing out that's it the Lord she performs the command of the Lord in his name for who has thou said the Lord somebody say hi then the word is quickened by the spirit that's the Holy Spirit and it comes to pass so that is why we should never lay around around idly in this time and in this season God has commissioned us to go forward some people are waiting for the portals of Heaven to open and God to audibly speak to them when she's already been given that said to the Lord like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full of us serving its purpose amen now we've got to serve our purpose right he says they in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus said the Lord or they keep still now didn't he just tell us we have that saith the Lord so we can't keep still hello a lot of people quote this part you know why they don't have that said the Lord they are backslidden in the message they have settled for the religion of the message they are no better than the scribes and the Pharisees who believe said we have Moses as our prophet we have a bunch of them today we have Branham as our Prophet but no Life of Christ same Pharisee you know something when men die let me just put it this way for you when Holy Ghost filled men die what happens to the Holy Ghost it's waiting to fill more people hello you believe Holy Ghost fooled me and die it's the same way in the other way when men die with demon spirits or demon Spirits get cast out of men they're looking for new bodies to dwell right so the Holy Spirit wants to move in a body of people and the Holy Spirit is a gentlemen amen so they have that saith the Lord and we can't be like the scribes and Pharisees because my point was when those scribes and Pharisees dies where did that Spirit go to those Spirits are still alive on the Earth and that's the worst kind of spirit the religious spirit amen some people are so holy they can't even swallow their own spit we've seen it right through the years amen so he says they know that it has to be God in them doing the works so we don't get puffed up we remain humble it's God in us doing the works amen fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride some are watching it like they're eating popcorn and the what they want to see other people perform signs Miracles wonders they want to be entertained in the message of the hour they don't want to become a co-worker with the Holy Ghost so they want to be entertained amen she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now some would have liked to have read that another way some would have liked the prophet to phrase that another way some would have liked him to say it's not your time for him to do certain things but that's not what he's saying do you know many people read that quote that way he's saying it was not your time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the but the bride keeps saying he did it through the prophet he did it through the prophet he did it to the prophet last 60 years they've been singing that song but what is the prophet saying he'll do it through who so the bride is singing he'll do it through the Prophet The Prophet is saying he'll do it through the bride what's going on that they are saying say what the tape says but I'm saying what the tapes is yes and he is saying you'll do it through the bride the work that he had left for a specific time for which specific time this specific time amen hallelujah now he says yeah the true bride she's already predestinated to take the place I'm not here because of my own choosing God chose me to be here you can't silence me neither can I silence you we both have a voice and we are the final voice to the final age when Christ comes to his bride she will be a virgin like Mary was when Christ the word comes to the bride shall be same as he is a Virgin by the word should be the same product that he is Virgin she is part of him she needs no Dogma she won't have any she's absolutely Virgin by the word she'll punctuate every word of God within oh be it according unto me be to unto me according to Thy word she'll have a virgin whom what is she made of a virgin whom what did Jesus come out of a virgin whom amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now the bride is not pursuing own vision and Christ pursuing another vision the eye is single their mind is single amen the vision the purpose is the second full mystery where Christ is having the preeminence in his bride amen without Jesus we have no vision and if we have no vision we have no purpose amen so we tap into the vision of God and we come God's provided way in this time we come to Jesus and amen and he gives us a vision he gives us a vision for our lives he gives us a vision for his word amen Jesus did not lose his vision at 12 years old he had a vision and he said I must be about my father's business amen hallelujah the father's business was Jesus purpose at 30 years old he comes to the prophet John in the water to be baptized and John feeling unworthy says Lord I need to be baptized of you but Jesus knew that his vision and his purpose must be fulfilled and the word must come to pass so he says suffer it to be so now for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness so we are never to lose our vision don't lose our vision of Jesus keep our eyes ever on him many friends and dear loved ones have lost their way they have lost the vision of him amen hallelujah now Jesus oh Jesus did he just say we if you go back to that slide there we are like Jesus did he say we are like Jesus we are part of him we have the same attributes amen then let me tell you about Jesus the blind came to Jesus and they went away with perfect eyesight the sick came to Jesus and the winter were healed it was a slide before brother killed amen the came to him and they went away walking if you came to Jesus and leper if you came to Jesus a leper you went to a cleansed amen this is I'm talking about the Life of Christ do you have the Life of Christ even they brought to him woman caught in the act of adultery they went away with sins forgiven but people come to us and they live more condemned if you come to him dead You Went Away alive amen that's our lord Jesus amen the Mighty God not even death could hold down his own body even when he was dead in the flesh he was fulfilling his vision and he was doing a work in his theory of any body he went to the regions of the lost and he preached to the souls that were in prison he emptied out paradise amen and on the third day when his ministry beyond the grave was complete the spirit of God raised him up again he came back in a glorified body this was a glorious body one that can't be crucified one that cannot die a body that can pass through walls amen hallelujah a body that can change dimensions and when our lord Jesus comes back again we are told that when we see him we shall have a body like his own glorious body amen amen many many men glory be to his name so we are exactly like our Lord Jesus Christ the only thing we are short of right now is our new body amen that's how a life should be the only thing we are short of is our new body amen Yahweh and slide six now then if God does anything in the church it'll be original back with the word again because the life that's in the tree has to obey its own kind and Jesus wants fruit for himself his wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is bright children were children amen we must produce this is an Rapture message now Jesus once who reproduce his life through you how many of you have fertile ground amen let's not be Barren or unfruitful now Jesus comes to sow his seed his word into you through the message of the hour we take that word in and we are bringing forth the Life of Christ amen there's only one thing that this word will do I'm talking about the end time message it'll give you faith for a Rapture faithful body change thank you that's what Romans 8 is talking about the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead Jesus was the word and if that word is in you that same spirit will Quicken your mortal body he says what we need today is the Life of Christ inside of us that's what purifies he takes the power of the Resurrection Christ to make us what we should be now hear this God has no other plan than to let the Holy Spirit Rule and reign in the church I got my own plan bro I got I want to build my Empire here I want to have four branches people have that kind of a vision I only have four branches but God has no other plan then let the Holy Spirit Rule and reign in the church amen God wants to pull out the whole life and inject The Life of Christ in The Believer then he becomes a new creation a new creature ask yourself do you still have your own life amen praise the Lord so yeah he's saying if the spirit of Beethoven is in you you write songs like Beethoven right you'd live like Beethoven if you had the life of Hitler why you might start killing like Hitler when the Life of Christ is in you you live like Christ and the works of Christ you do yes and that will be if Christ lived today he would do exactly what the word said he would do today and the word says he's the same yesterday today and forever Why Can't This blind ecclesiastical world see the time that they're living Christ's life is reproduced through a bride now she has the life of Christ she's manifesting his works on the earth amen praise the Lord now ask yourself right there what spirit is in you me I got the spirit of a gamer hey I just love my games three four hours five hours yeah I'm a master you know what level I'm at I need to buy the sheet code I need to do this I need to buy a new game that's the life that's in you hi it's innocent really I got the life of Netflix in me I just love watching his latest movies yo I stream the show Max yeah obviously none of you know what I'm talking about here but I love to watch these things they just fill me up inside my latest Idol my idol I want to see what clothes they're wearing I patent myself I want to see what hairstyle you can do it for a certain amount of time you know when you're 60 and 70 you think you can be Googling them hey Sonny do we have energy at that age to be good in this guy and trying to put our hairstyle you know what I mean so that's vanity can you imagine you who like games imagine you're 70 years old and trying to play this FIFA game now it's only for a season it's only for a while and Solomon says it's all vanity he says if I give you the best advice fear God and serve him foreign amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen my plan was to stop here in half an hour my plan was to stop in the next few minutes now you hear what the prophet is saying I am asking yeah I'm not asking this now this is a question from the prophet of God hear what he's saying now I am asking have you got the Life of Christ now you say I've joined Church brother Branham I'm Pentecostal a message I'm not saying that friend I'm not asking that you say brother Branham I spoke in tongues that's good but that's still not what I'm asking you say brother Brandon I never armed anybody that's not what I'm asking about is the Life of Christ in you amen don't take no chance friend don't do that it's going to be when death strikes you it's too late then don't do that please don't how do I get the Life of Christ brother how do I get the life brother Branham he's going to tell you he takes death to yourself to develop the picture of the image of Christ The Life of Christ in you you have to dump your own out so that Christ can come in you have to die to yourself how many of you want to say Kill Me Lord oh yes Lord kill all my fleshly desires kill my worldly desires Lord and let Christ live in me he says I would rather have the Life of Christ in me to live sweet and Victorious than I would have than I would all the gifts of healing the gift of Prophecy all them other gifts Just Give Me Jesus to be like Jesus Hallelujah give me the Life of Christ let me live the life the life is what I want to live I want to live so others will know that's my desire at Christmas I pray that your desire and I pray God would give us this desire amen The Life of Christ is in the church vindicating his word that's how God was in the earth in the form of Jesus being the word to make the word live that should be our desire Lord whatever portion of the word you have for me I want to make it live and the Holy Spirit is today in flesh making the word of God live to every promise and every wonder and everything is Promised it's there it's in the word and the word wants to be expressed through you know so amen we ought to be asking ourselves do I have the Life of Christ amen do I have the Life of Christ amen amen amen is it evident now we know that eternal life is living for others amen and Jesus came to give us eternal life so life should be lived serving others our life should be lived for others Amen in fact the world is craving and looking for somebody who's christ-like you know you can do it in your daily lives you can stretch forth your hand to have somebody in need amen you can stretch forth your hand to touch somebody to speak to somebody to comfort them with the word amen so the question that we ask have you got the Life of Christ now the Life of Christ it's not something you can be an undercover agent that we have to guess whether you have the Life of Christ because brother Branham says you give me a few minutes in that person's company I'll tell you what kind of a spirit they have amen there's some people that you feel very uneasy because you know you can run fellowship with them that spirit is not connecting but there's some brothers you can you can just click and you connecting with the word and you can speak and and time is going then you got to really cut yourself off and say brother I've got other things to do or you know what amen you get so engrossed because that's an eagle connecting with eagle amen hallelujah and that is why I love it when the prophet says you know when we get to the other side I'll talk to this brother and then a thousand years he's gone amen and he says we just got started amen and then it's then you saw somebody else there now you saw Sean they now you have to running or talk to Sean okay you saw sister you saw sister Maggie now you've got lots of stories hey sister Karen after church assistant now she ended up with three children leave that we have to explain to my father amen but what a time that will be amen what a glorious time don't miss it for anything but the thing required is the Life of Christ The Life of Christ we know amen comes by three stages the fourth stage is the final product but it's Amen justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost which brings us into the formed word image which is the Life of Christ backing us now that's where I'm going to stop and I'm going to hand it over to some of the brothers here who's going to come and encourage you you ask me who you know who you are because as the spirit gives utterance man praise the Lord for Lord and Savior Jesus Christ tonight and not strange enough I was just thinking today that I was wanted to say to pastor we should have a special day to like praise worship and testimonies must come forth but I see the Lord has just told him like you know just come forth now you know beyond you know the soldiers always have to be prepared amen amen we have to be prepared We Are Soldiers of the Cross we People Prayed Amen to give a testimony to praise the name of the Lord and to not to be ashamed of his of him amen any time any place anywhere Brahm says we can defeat the Devil any place any time anywhere amen so we are more than conquerors amen and I'm so privileged and I'm so thankful for this message amen because this not only this message has brought me but it's kept me amen you can be in the valley you can be in the mountain he's still the same God amen amen he's the one that can resurrect you he's the one that can uplift you he's the one that increase your faith increase your desire increase your love for him brother I've noticed something I'm I'm this is my my heart saying I'm telling you that God knows my heart you know ever since sister Maggie passed away I haven't been so much closer than what I was to the Lord yes now you know I I sleep I get up word I'm serious and you know this is the amazing thing at last night I was up to late so I was reading a message and I want to encourage every one of you they'll the message entitled the 11th commandment and you know what and these the message contains testimonies about different different people and you know and the amazing thing it was you know I was battling my legs knees and joints and you know I'm trusting the Lord I'm believing I'm I'm you know there's there's I cannot be moved my feet is so much anchored in that I cannot be moved my children can testify to that and you know I spoke to Pastor Eden last week I could feel there's a change in my body I'm serious I'm being I'm here and I'm keep on saying Thank You Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord so why why I'm bringing that point out I asked Bridge Jefferson last week to call me to give a testimony our thing is forgotten forgive you brother right so now but I know but you know what God had a purpose for that because Pastor Adrian came in the end and I figured what what happened but it coincided with what I was what I was to share you know God is not the author of confusion he knows when to put you on the spot and when not to put you so don't worry brother it's fine I had don't worry it's fine so anyway I've sent uh sent a clip of two pages from last night page 21 22 of that same message and look at what we have does say the Lord does say it the Lord so so we can find many disputes about just say the Lord but I want to tell you something this message is real and I'll tell you why because our 17 year old boy I read them a problem with the South African and I lived in a shack chandolo right but look at where the Lord took me out from and pass Aiden preached if you look at how the Lord has blessed us physically materially and whatever and at the current moment now my business is I just can't cope I just can't cope I'm serious I just I just can't cope I'm going home late and then the children asked me what happened Dad you go home later I said no I'm busy but anyway but what I'm bringing a point into uh to say please read that message if you are battling with a sickness if you are badly you know the healing is a process medical happens instantly all right so while I was reading this now and I was thinking you know Lord leclastic I felt you know my knee was like like some operation is going through my knees you know and I don't know whether some of y'all might notice like I sometimes put my one hand on my chin stand up and whatever but that's beside the point but last night when I started to read that there was one incident similar to mine now it says you know what there's a lady that's giving the Testament in the and the neighbor of us tried to put a doubt in him but it's then the prophetology you know what this is how it's gonna that healing is going to take place the tissue is gonna like grow in stages you know things are going to grow and say so what I'm saying to you tonight if you are believing God for a miracle yes hold on to that amen hold on as Jacob held on yes he wrestled with God you Resolute him and you say Lord you put your Yankee your feet in him and said Lord this is that this is your word yes you know like passage in all this is God said did you said it God is not man that he should lie and God will not say something today and change it tomorrow it's not like us instead fast so what I'm what I'm what I'm saying to you and I I'm say I said it to a lot of people in the message go and read that book and I don't know why because and that book has the unusual color of the cover too so you won't miss it it's uh like turquoise and red stripe but go and find that book because he's going to encourage you so if you want a new artist it's there if you are new limbs it's there so whatever you need you know those testimonies will encourage one of you and I believe the Lord has already done a finished work amen praise the Lord amen praise the name of Jesus Amen how many of you believe this we are entered the season of the Greater Works amen John 14 12. this is the season this is the hour you you read the code there a specific time yes you have to see it for your time it was stored up remember when the prophet was preaching he's preaching to a mixed crowd but there was no bride at that time he's preaching for a future time yes and that is why it was the the food had to be stored up and in a time of famine Amen in a time of famine this food was now Unleashed but it's not for everybody it's for a special class of people now this is nothing to do with you and I now when when God when Mary was chosen the first time right she said she said to Gabriel the Angel Beat unto me according to Thy word he doesn't take anything of her he didn't take anything of any human being the complete embryo was formed in it yes so if it happened to Mary then then in this virgin bride yes who have now received the word is nothing to do with air amen the complete Life of Christ formed in US when you receive when you Avail yourself to say beat unto me when you believe the word that's coming this day be it unto me Lord according to Thy word when you believe that word for your day the complete work was formed in you amen and then when it's formed in you what happened it must start to show on the outside amen there comes a time when you're going to meet your cousin when you're going to meet Elizabeth amen that babe that was dead in there leap for Joy when she heard the name of Jesus and the name of Jesus is through who the Bride of Jesus Christ because she becomes the final voice so he's a resurrected Jesus that's in this bride that now your cousin Elizabeth's gonna hear and the baby the life that was in it the Holy Ghost will come up in her amen we are the reflectors of Christ in this hour amen so I was going to work one of these days I think a few weeks ago and I said Lord how can I change how can I be a person to change things around because we we are preaching these things we must be the reflectors of Christ we must have a positive energy within us because the the word is you know the life is in US so we have life we must speak life you must change situations around so I walked into the first person's office and we started to speak and I use whatever opportunity I can Shadow when you when you got the word in you you can you can use any situ any conversation to turn it to Christ amen so anyway before we know it it came into this and I started taking to this person to the things that God is doing in this day God has been doing Through the Ages and where we are now and this person got so engrossed in the conversation take him to you know the true baptism the the church ages where we are and all that foreign come come take over this is this is where I am now hey you got excited now here this thing's happening and he said Denise what what was he what he spoke about he started to say this very brother that's speaking to you now let me share my testimony how I started to believe this truth now so he started to share the East part so you see what I'm saying we have all this within us but this is the hour of the Greater Works this is the hour where we can't be silent we can't be still how can you be the final voice in this final age how can you be the one that must prophesy again but you keep still we can't keep still there was a time for keeping still because when we had to go study and pray and it was a time and we had it in the start of the Season we had ever time of consecration going back to the altar going back consecrating our life time for prayer but it's now the time to prophesy again Hallelujah we're carrying an anointing yes yes you you might because you become accustomed to it you don't realize it but when you're going and facing people that are abound you might be speaking a few nuggets but when you're speaking because you are you're getting life within you when you're speaking the circumstance of spiritual debt they feel convicted there's something that they feel around you they feel an atmosphere around you like amongst you and I we it become common to us but amongst them that are not would have not received as words of life he's not coming to them so when you're speaking you're changing atmospheres you're changing the circumstances around you're changing people's circumstances people are bound because when you talk about love that's love when you have the love for and you see people bound and you know that the enemy is bound him and you know that people are evolved in religion the church world have bound them religion abound them dogmas increase the bound him and you have such a compassion because you know these people are trapped in the system but you have words of life amen amen they can break every barrier it's anointing that will break the anointing that will break the Yoke of bondage amen so we're speaking about the anointing now so when are we talking about the Life of Christ that was the topic today but I'm talking about carrying the anointing yeah so Jefferson I was in quarter was it Monday in court we were in court on Monday so we were having this case so the client was chatting telecasts right there apparently I left a USB in one of the cars that I was using it worked and the people at work they were they were using my car they took my car and I didn't know my USB was there and and a person was very upset very upset with things at work and they were in a very very bad mood from the time they left the office but when they started to drive the car and they put the music on and they annoyed they felt this anointing through the music and everything was soothing I said no it's not just the music the persons that were driving the car was carrying the anointing you're using the car that I was using and if we are using something to be carrying an anointing with us amen then when I left this person called me the client called me and said you know what ew when you left you know there's something about your brother he's telling me my brother now he said your brother is getting an anointing and he's saying uh you know he's talking about he's talking about the word and even one person was speaking in court they were overheard him talking and they came and he started correcting them with the word and he was talking about his William Branham and he's saying you know he said you know your brother is so into the word that's what I'm saying the people they don't have these things that we have we need to realize what we have what we're caring we're carrying some we we're carrying such a blessing from God and we have all of this all of the things that are given to us but now much is required unto much is given much is required the world want to see Jesus they're crying out for Jesus but they're being deceived they cannot see Jesus they want to see Jesus there's people bound they know the only time they can get up is to Jesus and they want to see the Jesus of the Bible yes and there's only one group of people on the Earth right now that can give them the demonstration of the power of the Gospel of the resurrected Jesus and that is the bride of Christ God richly bless you [Applause] praise the Lord amen hallelujah you've been blessed amen glory I used to be I'm going like a tortoise but praise the Lord the fire is still burning the fire is still burning you know what we hear here week after week I want to tell you it's all lining up if you if you want to wait for the prophet is not coming he's not coming he left you with that food he left you with that word and that word must be carried by the bride and nobody else nobody else will carry that the bride will ride this Trail one more time and you know what we're seeing what we're seeing is unbelievable but it's real it's real do not be despondent yes do not be despondent you're carrying that word you know I never stopped I don't know why people are afraid of telling the people that you believe a message for the end time you believe a prophet yes his name is William Branham why are you afraid if you're afraid get off the bus get off the bus if the bus is too fast take the train this is what's happening we are being encouraged don't worry about anything when you come to church just pray and say Lord speak to me not to my neighbor we miss the people we were on we were unfortunate that we didn't have the latest uh what you call uh technology we had to read till two in the morning three in the morning preach at 10 o'clock you see but we thank God you see God had to bring it in time he brought the tape recorder then he brought the other things and then he brought this why it's a season it's moving from one stage to the next stage like they had a buggy and horse a car then we went to plane now you're going to the moon so that's how this gospel is moving always appreciate what you have heard from there to now amen Pastor Aiden was speaking about Vision I want to add to that where there's no reason the people perish people perish so that is why today you can stand up and say you know what we have a vision and we can move on God God will never fail us will never fail us I just want to read one scripture before I continue I don't know if you prepare to stay on how many of you are starting work at six o'clock you're starting work at six o'clock don't worry the Lord will give you good sleep because he said he'll give his children good sleep if you have two hours sleep you'll get up don't worry anyway we can still preach this gospel you know you know Pastor I want to tell you brother Lynn I want to tell you sister you know what when we went to the open air there was no reading books and all you just got onto the pastor would say right start preaching amen you just take your Bible and you have to start preaching that's how you carry the word the word will just the word is automatic in you there's no such thing as you stagnant you see and it has to be in this day it was coming from that time it is here again today don't be despondent God will never leave you nor forsake you even until the end of this world that's a God we serve he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and

I'm just going to read one verse and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power Hallelujah gave them power yes yes and what are you frightened for you know what is power just

to cast them out and to heal all measures of sickness amen and all manner of diseases Hallelujah that's what he gave you power for what are you afraid for I was speaking I was sitting in the shop one day and ate this boy came running you reckon Uncle Sunny Uncle son I I don't know what to do this man fell down in the shop hey I said now what happened to me you got fits he got fits we put in the key I said okay I'm coming with a key now I just went there a stood and looked at him hey yeah now he's you know you know when they when the guys got the epileptic yeah I tell you nobody can hold him these guys are holding his hand and put I said just hold on I said in the name of Jesus hippolytic I want you to take your flight and never to come back again I kiss you right now he just woke up and stood up everybody was shocked he just woke up in Sudan they made him sit on the chair and uh he just said Jesus and you know other people looked and there was guys there was some of the municipal workers sitting outside they all looked they said alfundis you know you see what you're carrying you don't know you're carrying a dynamite you can explode anytime you never be afraid never be ashamed to preach this gospel never be ashamed to pray for somebody you know my brother-in-law was going through us some other times you know he's old and it's also like a little bit of uh you know he got he got some little bit of passion and stuff like that so it's been through a little hard time and I just prayed I said Lord just help him and I told him you know what just phone your daughter-in-law and I left when I left he's got no phones he's not into the phones and speaks to him but I told him he must phone his daughter-in-law but you see what happened there God knew his need he didn't have air time he was going to buy airtime but God didn't allow me to buy the airtime because he knew his need and his need was prayed for let us not stop there my brother my sister I want to tell you this God is great you see when the when the Israelites left when the Israelites left Egypt they never came the one that disrupted the whole thing from outside the camp they came from within the camp detail and Cora came from within the camp never come from outside when he came to Jesus Judas was in the camp you never come from outside in Paul's time what uh Armenia said philidius was in the camp going around preaching the other side of the Gospel and yeah now we got the all in the camp so it's not going to come from outside don't take the wheat and tears and put it outside it's here so when you hear in the gospel receive it take it take it and swallow it when you give John the book when John took the book he ate it now you take the word and eat it and you can become a new creature you can be somebody that is carrying this dynamite and walking around let me tell you something this message is not dead let us raise this Banner it is better of love and let us carry it onwards Christian Soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before us so we shouldn't be anyway nobody should intimidate us whenever you go around when you talk about this word sit down and try and give somebody something I've been doing that all my life and I even said the Lord when I was in hospital I told him Lord you give me back you take me back or take me home if you haven't finished if you have a purpose you leave me here and I'll continue and they never stopped although in my sick bed I was still ministering to the people and I want you to know that God will not leave you he will stand by your side you know what there is one thing I always said Lord if this cancer if this cancer came from wherever it came it must go back a month three weeks ago I had a test I think I put it out in a prayer warriors grew in the group and this is the final test I mean they gave me that test I was almost finished because that I think that medication didn't agree to me I thought I was going to die I couldn't breathe but anyway I got stabilized and something and I went home I said Lord this thing yeah he's not going to bring me down and then I'm thinking hey three days gone four days gone doctor number four it's in what they're looking for you know see the devil see that's what he'll do to you I want you to listen carefully this is what it will do to you now hey this thing now is coming to me now say what three days four days and you said Lord I want a result I want a result hey he phones the next day I'm looking at the phone on number on my that's it it's a local call who's this guy phoning I don't know his number he's not coming up anyway I picked the phone up I answered and he said Mr Guinness I've got good news for you I got good news for you and he said there's nothing we can't find nothing I said all your blood results are all clear your MRI is clear he said we won't see you until another one year we see you next year he said in January you do a blood test we'll see you again next year I said Thank You Lord Hallelujah I want to remind you that this God is our Jehovah Rapha oh God our healer don't be afraid when you see something happening don't be afraid take the name of Jesus he is the author the finisher of your faith may we all rejoice in the presence of God we're rejoicing with the word don't stop let us keep that momentum Rejoice rejoice and let the Lord come in our presence may the Lord bless you I want to tell you something don't be despondent when you see people leaving you know why you see when you say A man was 40 years in the message and he's leaving and that might be something you go home and think about it no don't go home and think about it you see God sent the prophet Malachi 4. he said he will turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal father's faith he never said he said that's what happened to the people acknowledge they they didn't receive the message it didn't drop from here to there such a short distance from here today never drop if it only dropped that wouldn't happen because you come in you see what happened to Aiken what happened to Aiken he went to the people but when he saw that you see because he came from there when he looked at it they came from there he saw it so he wanted it so people thinking they came to this message they were wasting their time there would have been some doctor of divinity some doctor of so and so PhD lld mad that's what it is so they've gone back so don't get worried the Rapture is taking place there is a falling away there's a falling away and that falling away you can see it you can see it other people can't see it so they'll follow you just follow Jesus I will follow Jesus anywhere everywhere he goes follow I will follow Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord foreign once again amen you're having a good time in the presence of God Amen it's refreshing in the presence of God Amen this fullness of joy in the presence of God Amen we like to thank the Lord for what he's been doing this year amen maybe maybe some at the beginning of the year might have been you know skeptical about when we said this was going to be the most Supernatural a year for the church but as we can see the months going on we can truly see God working amen we can see that it's not just a coincidence amen we can see amen how God is working week after week passion after pattern amen we have a special service like this and it's the 23rd amen amen 23rd of August 2023 amen and we can say that we are being changed amen we have been formed into that word image amen one thing I can say personally in in my life in this year is that God is starting to remove out the the fear amen I believe that the message people have been under a lot of fear over the years scared to pray for people scared to see results when they pray you know even we've been here in the last few weeks amen um how we are to be courageous amen God doesn't work with cowards amen we heard that the other week I think on Sunday amen God does not use cowards amen he needs people that are brave amen because if God doesn't present the opportunity for you and if you don't take the opportunity we will never see the supernatural amen if you are never brave enough to go lay hands or to pray for someone amen we will never see the supernatural but God needs brave men amen like Joshua and Caleb who were Brave amen they were not cowards amen even though they saw giants amen they may be in the natural had every reason to be scared amen but they were Brave amen holding their confession amen I had a thought sitting there and I thought that perhaps the current state of where the message church is as a general whole is that when Mary produced Jesus Christ right and she was producing The Life of Christ all we know in the Bible from the early years of Jesus up until the wedding at uh Kane Kane and Cana is that we knew that at the age of 12 Jesus was the word he was able to confound the priest with the word he could debate with the word we knew that we knew that he was a carpenter so he went about his daily life living but we knew nothing else about Jesus Christ in terms of the supernatural happening and that is where's the message as a general is perhaps now we've got the word we can confound any denomination person we can debate with any denomination person or any theological person about the word we go about our general lives working Etc but no Supernatural power of God moving until they come to the wedding and Mary comes to Jesus and say there's a situation here there's a problem there's no wine and Jesus look at what Jesus says to her Jesus says to her it's not my time as yet and doesn't that seem to be the picture of the message says no it's not our time we don't have that say the Lord we don't have to move now but Mary persistent said do what he says and she commanded those men to do what he says so Mary basically moved and and and moved Upon Jesus to then get into action and the bride of Christ the true bride of Christ at this hour is now getting into that place where they are saying no no no we cannot wait anymore it's time to get into action it's time to see the supernatural amen it's time for the Life of Christ not only to produce the word amen but to produce the power that was in the word amen and that is the place that we are God is bringing us into this year amen amen and like Joshua mentioned amen when when John the Baptist was dead in the womb amen but when the name of Jesus was spoken amen that dead baby came to life amen so we cannot be dead amen we have to have life in US amen so like I said amen God does not use cowards amen and over the last um you know over the last week or two weeks I noticed in my own life that God is starting to take away that fear of of wanting to needing to pray for people or even like we said mentioning the name William Branham mentioning what we believe in being true to what we believe in amen not not shocking around about it amen amen I was just the other weekend I was sharing this testimony with brother Adrian and I'm not going to share the full testimony because this has also been recorded and I don't doubt and unbelief to set in before we before I hear the full the victory of the testimony amen but I was on my way to work and I was driving and I was busy praying um as I usually do in the mornings to work and I drove past a beggar that was on the street and he had a condition and I won't say what the condition is but he had a condition and I drove past him I can't continue driving while spraying and then in my spirit the words of what pastor preached the week the Sunday before that was that God will present to you opportunities what are you doing with those opportunities and something urged me urged me to turn and go back and it was so impressed upon my heart that there wasn't even an easy place for me to turn and go back I had to like literally drive like further down come back I turned and came back and then there was cars behind me so I just couldn't get to this person I had to turn like three times just to get to him and because he has begging I firstly gave him money and I asked him I could see what his condition was but then he he explained to me what his real condition is and I didn't pray for him I took his hand and I said in Jesus name you're going to receive it I said in Jesus name you're going to receive this I'm not going to say what it is as I said because I don't want doubt to come in if I'm anyone watching it who might not believe because if I told you what it is some of you might think I'm a mad person amen and we heard on Sunday if you paid attention to the word on Sunday it was directly related to this testimony amen but usually if you look at a condition like that you'd be fearful to pray over something like that because you'd be fearful of what if one in case you don't see the results but something Came Upon me that all fear just went away and I couldn't do anything else but hold his hand and speak the word of him and I drove away and I said and now every day that I drive past there I am looking for this person to see that come to pass I know and I told Brother agent I know that I'm going to see it come to pass whether it's this week whether it's five years or whatever it's going to come to pass and that is when I will share the full testimony of it amen but I'd like to thank God Amen to take that when he's taking out that fear I mean that's when we can operate in faith amen I also have a lot of testimonies to share you know over Sister Kim and the baby but she wants to be here uh when when I share their testimony but brother Joshua also mentioned I didn't know that the brother actually told him about it but we have that course on on Monday and Josh had already left and we were waiting for the matter and so this guy you know yes congratulates me for baby and he and he asked me whether he could bring a candle for me because he's a Catholic you know it's a light for babies so tell him no you know what I don't we don't do that and we don't believe in all that but then I realized as a Catholic and I said this is my opportunity yeah size that are witnessing to him and unashamedly I told him what we believe I told him we believe in a prophet his name is William Branham We Believe In the End Time message and this is what the message says about the Catholic Church and I told him that the pope is the Antichrist and I told him that you know I told him and I and I told I gave him the prophet's favorite line I said you know if you don't believe certain thing keep what whatever you believe if you don't believe the rest you can throw it out but at least hear me out so I took him to the scriptures I told him how the mark of the beast is and how she is displayed in the Book of Revelation and so he has very enthused being a Catholic he has very enthusiant what I had to say because he could not deny the scriptures now he might be able to deny my own opinion but he could not deny the scriptures about the triple six about Rome being seated over seven hills and all of that and then I took him back in history and I showed him how the Catholic Church started to form started to pollute the doctrines Etc and then whilst I'm talking to him I could on the side of my eye I could see this lady continuously looking at me so but I kept on talking to him then when I walked past she got she just got my attention said sorry are you seven day Adventists because you know they have some similar beliefs about the end time so I told her no sorry I'm not I'm not 78 Francis I Believe In the End Time message of William Branham so what I'm trying to say is God is moving out over the years we've been too reserved amen if you look at God's men in the Bible they were not reserved well they were reserved in the maybe in their personal life but when it came to the things of God they were not reserved John the Baptist was not afraid to tell a King Herod what he has reading was wrong amen God's man has always been courageous amen that is what he's calling us to because he cannot use us if we remain cowards amen we've got to be courageous but at the same time we got to realize amen where we are wrong and I think that's where as a church we've come to this year we've we have looked and taken introspection and we've said Lord work in us use us change us if we are wrong in any way change us amen so let's be let's be like that amen every week we are in the word of God the word is molding us it's shaping us let's allow God to shape us amen there's still a lot of work for God to do on us but he is doing it amen and he's faithful and just to finish the work amen if there's anyone else that would like to see anything you can Comfort now you can raise your hands if you are coming amen good evening Saints it probably should be here so um I find it interesting what Jeff was talking about being fearful and I think the problem with a lot of people and in this generation we live in is that the spirit of professionalism and secularism and fearful is in this whole generation and it's something I realized it's you know you see all over social media where people who want to separate themselves from God they even bring in the churches it's what's fascinating is that the the demon he wants to come in the church and he works in he wants to deceive everyone in the church now from out the church and I find it really fascinating and there's one thing about being fearful also when you don't want to spread the word is that you're also being selfish and that's something I realized it anyone especially asking a message the time that we don't use the opportunity we're being selfish yes and I feel like many times I've been selfish and without spraying the word but if I give you one testimony I have a friend who is a Hindu and you know Hindus I feel like they they'll never want to you're your side of being a Christian and so on so you know one day I decided to to just to tell you more about William brand who doesn't know anything about it obviously they they only know their things so I decided to just bring up the name and then and then one day he started to just Google his name and he told me you know you know on Google he says um this is a bit of controversy and and he's like a doomsday prophet and so on so then I started discuss with the Bible I told him to read at least the first book of the Bible Genesis so what he found interesting was that um God made us in the likeness of his image and it's and that's why we've been talking about the whole year is for us to come into the likeness of God and to redeem falling men so as a talking team and so on he started getting intrigued by the message and in triple eyes you have to say and my beliefs so you know I'm praying I pray for him is I told him to even if you want to come to the youths he can come and and he said he actually might come I know and one of my other friends he's a Christian as well and he's in a domination one thing uh we'll be talking about is that there's a spirit of the Pharisees that's similar to what's happening in East church and he started to pick up on it so why are we talking about it one service in Wednesday but the agents start talking about that same Spirit that's from that time is still in this in the churches now so and then he started getting intrigued by when I mentioned the name William random and I still discussed some things that that's going on the judge and people always get uh astounded when they hear about the things that's going on what I believe and so on so yeah [Applause] amen so do you believe God is taking out the fear and bringing courageous men amen that in itself is a testimony amen that God can start to raise up young men amen amen let's stand and sing amen victory is mine victory is mine a victory today it is [Music] Victory today let's enjoy his mind for Joy is mine yes Joy is mine or the joy of the Lord oh we ought to be the most happiest people on the Earth yes [Music] in the Holy Ghost for the Holy Ghost is
