========================================

[Music] God bless you Saints amen greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ when I was asked to give this testimony this morning I forgot to ask Pastor which testimony because there's been so many you know the prophet of God said you know you know like in the book of Acts there were so many things that he couldn't even write and these things are just taking place daily in our lives amen amen but just to give maybe just two things we I just want to read a portion of scripture Mark 11:23 sorry Mark 923 Jesus said unto him if thou can believe all things are possible to him that believe it um just want to give two testimonies uh the Sunday service that uh I've been sitting here and uh recognizing that the angel of God was here amongst us in the service and the anointing feel that anointing and you just know when he's present is you and then I had some discomfort in my ear there was a gland coming up in the inner year and it was and it was very painful it it became so sore during the service that it it was the pain to Su the right to Maria neck and uh I felt that discomfort in the service then Pastor took the quat about the someone at the someone with the problem in the year and uh I knew that that stage that the angel is Discerning my amen so I took it personally to me and I placed my hand on my ear at the end of the service the the swelling the the swelling was gone down and the pain subsided then the next day it became you know when come something come itchy it means healed then I put my hand there and it was not no sign of any swe praise the Lord it was just an itchiness for healing amen so I like to thank and praise God that the angel of God can move through a service but we got to recognize for us amen we got to we got to discern yes that the Lord is speaking to my need amen and no matter what form it may come may come to a word of Correction whatever and say Lord you're speaking to me Lord you are correcting me so we got to recognize the angel of God is here amongst us literally yeah amongst us amen then on uh I don't know I can't remember which day now was a Monday or Tuesday I was at work and uh so I walked into the the administration office at work and there's about one two there's about four four people there about four or five people in the office there and they all had their own desk and computers and phones so as I was there greeted them in the morning and everything said uh as I was leaving this one lady said you know what you a man of God come lay your hands on my phone I'm having a problem with my phone uh and you know the the work phon you get and and I said what's what seems to be the problem with it he said no there the problem from here there's a problem with the connection everybody tried everything I said you take it out and put they said we did everything we could the phone is not working he said but there's a pastor in the other office and he prayed for for his similar situation and God you know he came right then I took the same scripture and I said th can believe all things amen I said the scripture didn't say some things I said all things I saying now you asking me to lay on the Bible said the sign shall follow them that believe when they lay hands the sick they shall recover so it might be a phone might be a phone situation but I believe that if my hands are there I said it must work I didn't say anything negative I said it must work but then in my heart I said Lord if a denominate if this can work through those that are the rainfalls on the just and the unjust if a denomination Minister this person is saying that this miracle took place with a denominational Minister how much you must do it for us now that the people must Rec I said the people need to recognize that you are amongst us Lord and I said this Within Myself and I just and I just quoted them the word I said no the Bible is saying the Bible is very clear he said all things are possible I said not something so I quoted the scripture I said yes it must work now so I said I put I put my hands on it and I just left it and I but I wait but something I wanted to leave but something made me wait within a few second the lady screamed said my phone is working I said praise be to God I said give God a thanks for that give God a thanks because God did that amen amen and even now the phone is working never stopped and everything is no problem they never had a problem so we like to give God the thanks that he's here amongst us and these are the things that he's doing amongst us but the secret is to recognize his presence yeah and recognize what he's doing amen God bless you amen amen [Applause] amen let's stand amen prepare our hearts to listen to God's word [Music] great amen bless name Jesus pray father we thank you Lord that you are great and greatly to be praised father in this city oh god father Lord New Jerusalem oh God we thank you Lord that you are building us up a

this morning we pray in the mighty name of Jesus For Your Glory and for your honor amen and amen amen greetings in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen good to worship Him yes amen especially when we know we serving a God who is not dead amen he's a god who's alive and he's showing himself amongst us we don't have to point at a day gone by we can point right now hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah let's turn Amen to our Bible amen this evening afternoon there'll be a command service amen with Pastor Tara at the D girl Secondary School 4 p.m. amen and then on wedness Day pastor tar will be here preaching for us amen so amen we invite you all to come to the service and be blessed with the word of the Lord amen I don't if you know the fivefold is here to edify and to build up the body of Christ amen amen we shouldn't be missing these Services amen every opportunity the prophet says when the church doors open we should find ourselves in church amen amen hallelujah and the prophet says when the church doors open we should find ourselves in church amen amen amen praise the Lord amen how if you know the only reason we are all gathered together here is because God sent us a prophet amen without the prophet's message you and I wouldn't have common ground but God sent a message to turn your heart to turn my heart and together how our hearts are being turned amen so praise the Lord for that amen hallelujah amen so we were if you were following the service amen we were dealing with angels and demons and connecting with sons of God in this time and we were really dealing with Genesis Chapter 18 because that's when the angels are coming down amen amen the angels are connecting with the sons of God Abraham and Sarah to give them a message for the body change yes and then the angels are going down to Sodom and gomorra in a time of investigating judgment Amen to bring destruction upon the city so that's why we were dealing with spiritual warfare and showing you the present time and condition how the same influence is upon the earth now in another time like Sodom amen if you're not being influenced by the angels of God now you are being influenced by Fallen Angels there's no two ways about it you are influenced by one set of angels either God's angels or the Fallen Angels amen so that's two Services that's what we were trying to do to show you there amen so maybe we want to progress a bit further into Genesis amen chapter 18 and 19 and maybe we'll do 20 and 21 if the Lord permits amen sounds good amen amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen so we find just for a little title amen he's bringing a perfect faith for the body change so perfect faith for the body change dealing with Abraham and Sarah right and then on the flip side of that you're going to see the destruction of Sodom amen praise the Lord amen so maybe we can just pick it up from I think we read the first 15 verses the last time of Genesis 18 we can progress a bit further from verse 16 and when the men got up to leave they looked over out over Sodom and Abraham walked along with them to see them off amen you notice now when William brandham he says both men came to me Oral Roberts amen and Billy Graham and then he also says was it t Osborne that came to him amen amen hallelujah amen so the men got up to leave why I'm reading that watch What's Happening Here the men got up to leave and Abraham walked along with them to see them off amen and the Lord said shall I hi from Abraham what I am about to do Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation and through him all the nations of the earth will be blessed for I have chosen him that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing which is right and just in order that the Lord may bring upon Abraham what he had promised so the Lord is adding nothing back from Abraham and Sarah because it's a type of the seven seal yes amen all the mysteries of God must be revealed am so we've had our Bram amen a type of Abraham yes amen and all the mysteries of God have been revealed amen look at you go look at the sermon titles and you see all the mysteries of God have been revealed to us amen amen so I don't want to labor on that you know that then the Lord said the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great because their sin is so Grievous I will go down to see if the actions fully Justified the outcry that has reached me I'm reading another version amen amen The Cry of it which has come unto me and if not I will know amen and the two men turned away and went to Sodom but Abraham remained standing before the Lord amen you may be seated I don't want to keep you too long here amen so you'll find there that Abraham straight away goes into an intercessory role amen I'm know that inter intercessory role is a Priestly role yes amen amen so how how does he how can he step into the office of a priest did he not meet the image Amen in Genesis 14 King and priest MDC amen so he recognizes his position and he knows that he was made in the image of God so then he steps into the Priestly Priestly role and he starts to intercede so you know they come from 50 40 30 20 and they come down to 10 and they say if I find 10 righteous in the city I will not destroy the city yeah amen hallelujah amen now you notice something here about Abraham he was immediately able to recognize his day amen when he saw the Angels coming immediately he recognized his day amen yes now he's been going through years of preparation like how we were going through years of the preparation amen okay so you read how he came out of Babylon very quickly I'm going to summarize this you remember how he came out of Babylon and he was not partakers of their sins he left everything to follow the voice of God Amen and the Lord would bless him abundantly with sheep cattle donkeys men's servant maid servant and camels yes amen hallelujah then the word of God calls for a total separation from unbelief amen so notice now the some of these things are the titles of the prophet and what I'm trying to do is show you how prophetic the message is amen amen amen so God is calling for a to Total separation from unbelief so he has to separate from lot amen some of us feel like we are separating from a lot amen when we leave the things of the world and follow Christ amen it feels like we have to sacrifice a lot but God wants us to leave lot amen amen so he gives remember now his name natur his character he gives lot First Choice amen over the land that God had promised him God promised Abraham the land but he's given lot First Choice amen amen so lot chooses the plains of Jordan all the way to zoah the well watered Plains and the Bible calls it it was like the garden of the Lord amen so what did he do he went and set up a denominational Church in Sodom and he had a sister branch in gomorra amen his ministry was thriving amen his ministry was flourishing so much that he became a leader in the city right amen amen hallelujah and at this time God reconfirms when lot separates God comes and reconfirms his Covenant with Abram and God is wanting you to separate from all forms of unbelief amen so that he can come and establish his Covenant with you I don't think you heard me God is wanting you to separate from all forms of unbelief yes Lord amen because he's coming now at this time to confirm his Covenant with you this is a serious hour church it's a serious time amen amen amen now is not the time to be relx now is not the time to be lukewarm amen it's a season of body change perfect faith has come in this hour to prepare us for a body change amen that may sound like a a fairy tale to you that may sound like a m to you amen hallelujah but we are believing for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen to change our physical bodies amen yes thank you Lord amen my question to you is are you willing to lay down everything and get rid of all unbelief amen yes amen L thank I'm going to re ask a question some of you didn't hear are you willing to lay down everything and get rid of all unbelief amen please don't use my God like an Aaron boy only when you have a need then you want to make things right and ask the Lord why don't you live in the fullness of his glory why don't you live in it every day amen amen hallelujah amen you find here that in I'm still summarizing Genesis 13:14 but I've got to speak certain things here when he separates from lot because God won't ask you to do something without rewarding you oh thank you the moment he separates from lot amen the moment he separates from lot amen thank you Lord God tells him look northward look South amen look Eastward you can put 13 14 there look Westward all the land that you see I will give to you and your Offspring forever amen amen you see they can't get rid of the Jew they can drive them out of the land of Israel like they did but God gave it to them and it will always belong to them yes am God is not an Indian giver to give now and then take it back oh yes hello Hallelujah God has given you the promises of his word am amen this is the land yes amenallah God has never taken it back amen amen the prophet would say many times you backslid preachers I'll show you where God put in his word you show me where he took get out amen that's right amen he says yeah in verse 15 all the land you see I will give it to you and your Offspring forever how many of us are really searching the land amen amen watch now he confirms and tell him I will make you Offspring like the dust of the earth so that if one could count the dust of the earth then your Offspring could be counted now he tells him get up walk around the land oh thank you come on now thank you Lord you need to walk through the land am amen walk the length walk the breath amen for I will give it to you amen amen God says he will give give it to you but are you walking the length of it are you walking the breadth of it or you sitting in one corner waiting idly there amen you need to possess all the inheritance of God Amen this is the time of perfect Faith where you can claim all the inheritance of God nothing shall be witheld from you at this time you think if he told Abraham shall I withold from Abraham anything he's going to withold anything from you no after the angels have come no no amen so we we got to walk through the land of our inheritance don't be content you know we the prophet says the message of the hour is our own land amen amen but don't be content saying you are in the Homeland the message of the hour walk around the land amen come on now I'm really going to test you now walk around the land know the [Music] Mysteries do you know the Mysteries that's in the message of the hour know the Mysteries know the word that's been revealed in this hour amen walk the land no baptism no godhead amen no the mystery of God no the Seven Seals no the seven Church ages no the trumpets no the vials amen amen the message of the hour hallelujah amen amen don't let your amens go quiet now because some of you scratching your do I really know the thing come on now you're saying you are in the land god is asking you to walk the land amen or you sitting in one corner only looking for blessing the blessing land how you can be blessed amen these divinely revealed mystery truths will literally turn your hearts back to the faith of the apostolic fathers and then you can operate like the apostolic fathers let's not get it backwards amen it's through the mysteries of God hallelujah come on now otherwise we're just a denominational Church it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back to the faith yes amen of the fathers so know the mysteries of God know the seven Church ages know the trumpets know the vials I'm expecting lots of questions Pastor please tell me about the vials please tell me about the trumpets please tell me about the seals [Music] amen amen hallelujah no invisible Union of Christ

easily accessible you have internet connection like never before you can download downlo the land in an instant thank you if you want to walk this portion of the land you can download it in an instant we live in a time where everything must be instant amen hallelujah amen walk the land of your deliverance it's given to you don't be bound by situations don't be bound by trials don't be bound by depression amen you don't have to live with depression you don't have to live with anxiety walk the land Christ has come to set you free amen amen don't live in your situation don't start to talk and and make yourself feel sad oh this person did this and this person you putting yourself into a drunken stup of depression tell them I know who I am through Christ amen hallelujah I'm not concerned about what you say or how you treat me amen I'm concerned about Christ and how he treats me amen I'm concerned about Christ and how I treat him amen I can't allow other people to affect my anointing I can't affect other people to affect the presence of the Lord in my life yes amen amen now let me ask you a question when he's asking him look northward Southward East and West is he asking him to look with physical eyes because the land is inhabited he wants him to walk by faith and not by sight amen thank you amen If Abraham looked now the Giants ahead of you in your whatever trial you are going through all you can see is this mountain all you can see is the trial all you can see is a Goliath but then you're looking through the eyes of the flesh God wants you to look that you have already got the victory God wants you to look at already happened yes Lord amen hallelujah walk the land amen get out of depression you say how do I get out of depression you are not spending time with the number one cure for depression the word of God Amen hello right come on nowen I don't know why I can't hear the sisters saying amen because sisters like to get depressed sisters like to have anxiety and worry and stress amen walk the land of healing amen walk the land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and everybody said amen amen the land of the Holy Ghost amen is where we become possessors of all things amen it's what puts the God man in us hallelujah thank the Holy Ghost amen Footprints mean possession so walk the land don't just sit in one place don't sit idly walk North walk south Walk East and walk Westward it's all yours amen every Redemptive blessing that you can find in this Bible belongs to you oh yes amen amen amen beloved I wish above all things that you prosper even as your soul prospers amen amen hallelujah hallelujah oh we find now lot we find here amen he was found in this position amen we find here he's in a time now where the White House Rider had gone forth lot was satisfied with his religion he was in a religious deception but watch how quickly the rider changes horses from a white horse he moves to a red horse and lot becomes a prisoner of war because red types Wars come on now you see why I say you need to know the Mysteries to walk the land is he not a prisoner of war the rider changed he's caught up in war and he becomes a prisoner of war amen what happened here politics and religion had United amen and you'll see there Four Kings come against five Kings Four typing the four as Riders amen coming to take lot captive amen lot became a prison of war and here he's going amen under politics now and lot's becoming the prison of war and now Abram has now go down and rescue lot but after he rescues him lot still goes back to his denomination yes amen it's at this time after he rescues lot that the mystery of God is made known to Abraham amen he meets mdic the king of Salem the one without father or mother the one without beginning of days or ending of days he meets amen MDC amen and MDC blesses him and he gives him Bread and Wine which is a type amen bread is a type of the body of Jesus and the blood and the wine is typing the blood of Jesus he's showing him a future ministry right now I am condescended amen from Spirit to word but uh Abraham I want you to know something I'm going to condescend even further I'm going to come from this theophany body into a flesh body one of these days amen hallelujah that's Genesis 14 The Mystery of God is revealed to him then we come to Genesis 15 and Abram is found there in the beginning of Genesis 15 he's updating his family will he's met with his lawyers he's met with the people who does the will and they asked him who will be your Heir and he tells him Ela of Damascus I have no hair so they put the all belongings of Abraham will go to elezar of Damascus and the Lord hears him I'm dramatizing it now right right the Lord hears him amen hallelujah and he tells him he reconfirms the Covenant with Abram and tells him one from your own body oh yes yes Lord will be air yes now he tells him take your eyes off the dust now look to the Stars amen see if you are able to count and Number the Stars taking him from the Earthly to the Heavenly Hallelujah taking his eyes of the Earthly to the Heavenly amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord look at the stars and see if you able to number them amen then he makes him do a blood sacrifice you know the slaying of animals now my question to you is are you looking for the promise out of another person God is selling you out of your own body yes amen out of you shall come the Life of Christ amen yes he coming in Genesis 15 to tell you out of your own body Genesis 16 you know they moving to the permissive will and now there's AA involved they're going into permissive will amen there's still some doubt and reasoning going on there amen time is passing but in Genesis day 16 amen you'll find that there's a ishma is not born Genesis 16 Genesis 17: 19 now before there's any seed Sarah is still old Abram is still old there's no promise of a son what does he say there in 1719 Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son and you shall call his name Isaac God knows all your children before you ever had them and he knows their names some of you not reading this with me this is before the birth of Isaac who is this that knows what child you'll have what gender amen who is this amen they didn't go to a doctor for a sonogram to reveal the gender Amen in fact God spoiled it for them they they couldn't have a gender reveal party Sarah says Ah must now no gender reveal God said it's going to be a male child it's going to be Isaac and now no name revealing no christening service the Lord already told him you going to name him they want to name him nine boy but this is no nine boy this is going to be Isaac amen amen I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant amen amen praise the Lord amen then we find that in Genesis 17 amen all this is preparing for Genesis 18 we're almost back at Genesis 18 now Abraham is having a new birth you say New Birth yes yes because what does the changing of name signify name signifies the nature of a person amen so he's getting a new nature he's getting a new birth Hallelujah Abram means exalted father but Abraham means father of many hallelujah amen God is changing his name to fit his role he doesn't want him to be an exalted father with no seed he tell him I'm going to make you a father of many nations so God changes his name to Abraham and gives him a sign of circumcision which is a sign of the Holy Ghost amen amen come on now you got to read between the line here Abraham is getting a new nature he's getting a new birth and he's getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen after all of these things now comes Genesis 18 after the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't think you're getting this after the sign of circumcision after he's sealed after he's done the things he's waiting for the promise amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord oh he's good isn't he amen amen here's something amazing amen you can find it here amen hallelujah you find it here in I think it's Genesis 13 go there quickly Genesis 13 Verse 18 the last verse there I want you to see this he he repositions himself Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the Plaine of mamre mamre means strength right which is in Eon and built an altar unto the Lord right so he's at this place in Genesis Chapter 18 now in mam that's how the verse starts right 181 coming to the plains of mam so what am I telling you Abram was living in one place in Jeffersonville but he repositioned himself to meet the angel of the Lord amen he had to go west yes to connect with the Angel's message yes and he comes Now by The Oaks of memory The Plains of memory and he's sitting at the tent door there right we read all of this I'm I'm just giving you this the the brief summary of this things we're not going to really go into that but here we find in Genesis 18 now his heart is going to be turned back Amen to the god of Enoch and the god of Noah amen amen amen Abraham like we said he immediately able to recognize the presence of God able to recognize his day and his message so he immediately recognized it's God with two angels amen and he goes to entertaining them and that's what we've been dealing with with the last couple of servants how to entertain his presence how to entertain Angels getting our lives right getting everything right amen being able to entertain his presence amen and then Sarah is sitting there without a prayer card she sitting in the tent she's got no prayer card right but she don't need a prayer card amen because the sign of the son of man is going to be performed amen amen and with his back turned to them he would call out that person that person and with his back I'm talking about William brandom now in his meetings he would call out the sickness you sister there in the back amen call out the name call out the sickness call out the address yes same sign amen same one yes doing it amen he's able to recognize the sign just like how you were able to recognize the sign you are sitting here because you recognize Luke 17:30 you didn't come here out of marriage you didn't come here amen because you sympathize with the message you are sitting here today because you're a believer of the message of the hour thank you thank you Lord amen so she's sitting there the prophet say she was a little fuss in all of these things but now when the gift starts to move and discerns her heart and tells exactly what's wrong with her amen what is it a message coming to move you into perfect faith because what's needed for the body change perfect Faith so it must be a message to move Sarah into perfect Faith but this message has a dual purpose it's coming with a message of perfect Faith to put Faith in the heart of Abraham and Sarah but it's also going to now go to Sodom to amen do a time of investigating judgment and pronounce judgment over Sodom now the sin in Sodom is so great that laws have been passed to legalize homosexuality you say see it softly I said laws have been passed to legalize homosexuality you saying talk softer but it's against the word of the Lord to be a homosexual amen yes Lord who's controlling my volume here put a speaker out there right thank you Lord we got too many backslid people in the message who sympathize with their gay cousins and the friends Lord have mercy amen they're good people they're good for a burning that's right amen hallelujah yes do you know what happened to Lot son-in-laws they burned in Sodom right amen if you go read Genesis 19 the Angels tell him speak to your son-in-laws yeah but they refuse friends family that they had meals with they had bries with they had fun times with they even had sleepovers but they burned in Sodom yes God don't care for your open-mindedness that's correct you need your mind examined hello yes that's right God didn't update his gospel to say okay okay maybe I was a bit wrong God hates sin God's word will still stand yes amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen now if you find what happens here lot is not shocked by what's going on so means he's already aware of the situation he's aware of the perversion it's legalized yes did we get it legalized under this Obama yes yes yes now the alab people rights were being exalted you're saying what's the alphabet people we start with a b c d they start with LGB amen the alphabet people's rights were being exalted and promoted the first time this year they had an entire month exalting and promoting this thing yes so what happens the Riders changing to black demon powers have come upon the people yes you see when you're reading The Story You're just reading out the men of Sodom kind demon powers right came to unite with religion and politics because through politics They are promoting this thing through politics they are passing legislation to legalize it so here the black hor writer is writing demon powers are there through Sodom and Gomorrah and through all the plains amen and lot you saw aware of these things but he's accustomed to their sinful ways that the Bible says his righteous Soul was vexed but he did nothing to take his family out of that condition lot could have left with his family at any time that's correct but he did not leave his denomination amen hallelujah amen who which one of you want to leave your family in that situation in a city that's so sinful amen he didn't want to take his family out of the situation he became a compromiser and he was even willing to offer his virgin daughters to these perverted men to save The Messengers amen now we know that not much could be done to save the city because of the wickedness of the people so what are we saying they were preaching to the L no evangelism could be done they didn't give them room for evangelism these men saw these angels enter lot's house and they came knocking at the door where are these men that have come into your house there was no time to look for the 10 the 10 that Abraham bargained for there was no time for evangelism amen hallelujah they did not get the 10 that they were looking for so the Angels asked lot to speak to his son-in-laws but they will not listen his message was strange to them you telling about about angels coming down but the Angels eventually take lot by the hand take his daughter by the hand take his wife by the hand and they drag them out of the city amen and tell them flee to the mountains but now Lot's wife has got a son-in-law or daughters in Sodom and who knows if they got children or grandchildren there and a heart can't help right but turn back and look at the city being destroyed now is not the time to turn back amen amen look at it you would think ah it's just a human it's a human emotion my my grandchild is being burnt in that City can't I look back God said Don't Look Back yes amen it sounds like a heartless thing but we're dealing with God here amen amen we can't be trying to serve God in the message of the hour and we got one hand in the world two hands in the world while the Angels God is one foot on land and sea we think we got one foot in the church and one foot in the world amen amen hallelujah we feed the spirit man a cold meal once a week but we try and feed the flesh man three art meals a day something is wrong how many of you know we are not going to make it out of this life in the human flesh based on the human flesh right it's the spirit man inside of you that's rising up to bring this flesh under subjection and one of these days his flesh has to give way to change amen yes Lord yes thank you sounds ridiculous amen but I'm telling you the word of God is quick it's powerful the Bible says that our very atom shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen these body shall be changed Hallelujah yes thank you Jesus praise the Lord amen hallelujah now you know the prophet had a a vision and in the seventh Vision what did he see anybody can remember what the seventh Vision was amen don't be afraid to say it loud brother raes just I just need one person to just say what that was amen yes praise the Lord so he saw I just want to give you the notes brother take those notes please you can put this up just give you this s amen praise the Lord so he saw in the seventh Vision America go up in a great big cloud of smoke and why was that happening because it had reached another time of Sodom and gomorra that's right amen they would not amen they were not aren to the voice of William Brandon that's correct they rejected their day and their message yes that's right amen so all of them will now have to go through the tribulation period because rapturing Faith only comes via the message of the hour amen yes amen and rapturing Faith only comes by the message of the hour amen not Joseph Prince right no not Billy Graham amen Oral Roberts Joel oin TD Jakes rapturing Faith does not lie in their messages motivational speeches lies in their messages amen yeah Hallelujah yes but I want to show you how Abraham because we're always typing Abraham with Bram but I want to show you a scripture here that that will really show you how he also saw Sodom go up amen so have we got the slide there yeah it says early the next morning this is Genesis 19:7 now Abram got up and returned to the place where he stood before the Lord he looked down towards Sodom and Gora and all of the land of the plain he saw smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace and listen how close that is now to William Brandon's Vision the last and seven Vision was where I heard a most terrible explosion and I turned and looked and I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America oh yes you see how similar that scene is yeah yes amen now if God doesn't judge this world for their sin and their condition the prophet says he's got to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize to them amen the next slide this is where we are now the Gentiles are called out and I want to hear you all say Amen the bride is ready amen the Rapture is at end yes he says can we realize that can we actually believe that is it a story that's been told is it a m to us is it something that sounds real yes is it something that we outside can believe or is it something that's in US that's part of us that is more than life to us he says and I'm going to ask you the question this morning what attitude do we set in this morning in the Tabernacle amen What attitude do are we sitting here now he says remember it'll be a small flock that receives it now in the Homeland waiting for the trumpets oh watch what the Jews are waiting for how many if you know what the Jews are waiting for anybody knows now yeah the prophet's going to tell us right let's read it they're waiting in the Homeland for the trumpets they are waiting for the going of the little bride am amen amen so that Revelation 11 can be fulfilled what are they waiting for for you and I to go the church age has seized the seals has been opened that prove what they left out in the church age and the message has been given Israel is on the scene ready for the Feast of trumpets yes amen now I want to bring these things here because we're talking about it in the message anointed ones at the end time the prophet says three things have been fulfilled and three things lay before you right now he says first the world is in a Sodom condition Jesus said it would happen look at the perversion our women trying to act like men can you agree our men trying to act like women yes can you agree sified rotten filthy low down devil possessed and don't know it the Bible says that would happen and that's where it's at these three things now right you're taking note of the first one we reading about Sodom in Genesis 19 there the world now is in a Sodom condition yes is he being prophetic here when he's saying three things lay before you right now remember he's a prophet amen secondly in that hour according to the scripture that Janice and jamas appears have we had false impersonations yes have now we got the most amount of prophets trying to prophesy on the earth I think we got the most amount of prophets here in Africa right right amen they got Doom yeah and they got gloom and they got grass amen hallelujah Janice and jamus appears thirdly it's the same hour that the son of man is to be revealed amen there is your believer your make believer and your unbeliever there is a genuine word standing out Vindicated there is the make believer impersonating it and there is the unbeliever rejecting the whole thing now which group are you are you 1 2 or three amen are you 1 2 or three tell me what number you are somebody is one okay hey let's personalize it you in a Sodom condition no so why are you saying one one hey who's exposing themselves in so the world is in a I'm asking you to identify your PA so we not number one anyone here Janice and jamas are we number three amen have we seen the son of man being revealed let me ask you quickly and maybe I'll tell you so for the younger ones who don't know what is the son of man revealed so Jesus came in three sons name right so he came a son of man when he was here born on the Earth son of man means Prophet that's right Prophet God in a prophet God in a body of Flesh amen and Jesus operated in Son of Man Ministry then when he resurrected and he he went up to ascended up to heaven he he moved in a Ministry of Son of God which is through the Holy Ghost amen through 2,000 years right then in the Millennium you'll be son of David but now the mystery of Luke 17:30 is this that in between Son of God which is the Holy Ghost and Son of David he comes back as son of man in Luke 17:30 amen but he doesn't physically come back on the earth he uses a prophet's body that's right I don't know if you're just listening and and hearing what I'm saying or you hearing it for the first time or you don't believe that but this is the message of the hour this is exactly what we believe exactly amen that Jesus Christ came and he used the body of William Brandon that's right and that he the one who could discern the hearts because no man can discern Hearts amen praise the Lord you see the next slide here I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared amen I'm not the one that performs these things and for tells these things that happen as perfect as they are I'm only the one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to I hope you're learning here amen that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery of God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man which is Jesus Christ give God praise [Applause] amen now he says if you haven't fully fed on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these denominations and things of this world will you at this time do it while we pray amen hallelujah now we find coming to our current setting now and you watch how the prophet places this year because sometimes he says things in a way that will make you understand he's preaching here in the message recognizing your day and we look how Abraham recognized his day he's he's now telling you that Russia has recognized her place is Russia in place now she has to do it to do what somebody read help me brother Caleb she's here in place to do what fulfill scure now she leads the world in science we're way back behind her all the rest of the world is behind her she leads a the place now he's giving you the reason why Russia recognized herself you see this is a time where everyone recognizes who they are the pope USA Russia the Jews and the bride reason Russia came to herself she had to just like Israel had to get in the Homeland God had to drive Israel back to the Homeland for the trumpets so did God have to drive Russia up there to do exactly what's been prophesied she would do is that why she's there now is that what he's telling you Russia is in a place to do exactly what God prophesied her to do amen see it's a time of recognition you've got to recognized the world is recognized the nation has recognized science is recognized the devil has recog recogniz it's time that he can wreck women wreck the church wreck people he's recognized it and God has recognized that there is people on Earth that he has predestinated to life glory amen hallelujah [Applause] am amen he recognized that this is the time to send his message amen he did it the people has recognized it the bright time has realized the evening light amen if Sodom had be recognized her day when she seen those Messengers come down there like Billy Graham and all Roberts but she didn't right if Sodom had recognized the messenger she would have been standing today Jesus said if she'd have recognized the same as Abraham recognized Abraham knowed that there was a promised son coming he know that there had to be a chain some way because he was too old and so as Sarah but when he saw the one who could discern the thoughts amen of Sarah behind him he recognized the hour he was living he recognized that God was speaking to him out of human flesh he recognized the sign and was blessed of the Lord Sodom didn't recognize the day and was burnt up and Jesus says As it was in the day so shall it be when the son of man has been man manifest and he says well the denominational Church there has not recognized her day right he says here the National Force put Israel in a Homeland and I want you to give you an update now he's not talking about that back then right now Russia is driving them back to their Homeland still driving them back the war is increasing and increasing the largest population of Jews outside of Israel was in Eastern Europe but the war now has made it uncomfortable for them and the largest amount of Jews have been returning back to the Homeland amen amen and could it be that that's why the angels are holding back the winds waiting for all the Jews to go back back go back not only were they in Ukraine they were also in Russia right and in Poland and all of these Eastern European countries there but they all going back go and do a search use Google and make it work for you and go and see how many Jews have gone back to Israel since the Russian Ukraine war go type it there how many Jews have returned back to Israel since the Ukraine Russia War so what's putting it the Wars and strife National Force and what's National Force you see what's going to happen here the National Force calls you to put a mask on National force caus you to stay at home National Force made you stop coming to church I'm trying to bring it to reality right National Force says you couldn't gather so he's saying National Force because that what will happen now will'll put the church that's the denominational now in the world Council of churches do you know right now remember the people don't know what's going on if I belong to a church and the head of that church is signed up with the Pope and signed up with the World Council of churches I am not aware of it I thinking I'm innocent I'm just going to church but you know even in law the guy sitting in the car waiting to make a getaway is equally as guilty as the one in the in the bank robbing right they'll both get charged for the same crime so somebody sitting in the Pew and just because he doesn't know what's going up on up there they'll all be guilty of the same crime amen he says so watch now there's National Force but then there's the power of God Amen the power of God has put the people in The Bride right I'm reading that as past tense because that has happened the spirit of God which is the word of God will put the bride in her place she'll recognize a position in the word then she's in Christ will put her in a place the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it amen oh people recognize your day as Jesus want the sign of Sodom the church conditions of this day look body said in this day will take place the sign of Sodom would take place in this day sign like Abraham the day before Sodom amen now look at what the son of man came to do here right I'm going to close now he says he promised to send you Heavenly light to ripen the word seed that would be swn for this day amen the seed is here the seed is the is the Bible okay let's slow that down he sent the Heavenly light to ripen the word seed but how if you know if you leave seed here if this is a seed can it produce anything what must you do dig you got to bury the seed right you got to bury the seed and then you got to cover it with dirt then you've got to get it enough sunlight and water and leave it no farmer ever digs every week to check how it's growing when you speak a word of faith when you speaking over your situation when you believing God for anything stop going to Red dig it you got to approach it like a farmer you saw the word by faith but every day you are doubting and reasoning will it happen will it happen I wonder if the seed is growing a farmer doesn't worry a farm has F to believe in the law of God that if I put a seed into the ground the natural law of God says that amen every seed must bring forth of its kind amen so I'm sewing the word by faith looks like it's a season of praying over his phones brother [Music] Joshua amen hallelujah last night my wife I just showed a miracle instant amen so we fixed the phone on wedness day was it wedness day I think it was wedness day w Wednesday or Thursday could have been Thursday brand new screen everything but this phone has been water damaged before so there's always problems with electronics right and brother Joshua introduced me to a very nice guy that does our work and sometimes I feel bad because now he knows me because of my association with brother Joshua so he doesn't charge us labor it make us pay for the part now if you keep taking the same phone back to him all the time he's going to think you're taking advantage of him right and the last time when I took the phone back to him he replaced the screen free because the screen was defective after 2 days because of the water damage that runs through the phone that trigger something and the screen stops working you'll hear messages coming through but the screen is black so anyway the last time he didn't tell me he replaced the screen free and he gave me the phone so anyway way when he fixed it this time and yesterday so I spoke to my wife in the morning with the same phone it worked and then I get a call from Autumn later to tell me Mommy's phone is not working the screen is just black doesn't want to come on and she says brother Caleb might try to come home for something and whatever amen so when brother came the phone did I tell you the phone's not working okay so anyway I left it I was fed up with the phone I wasn't moving in Fai I'm thinking you know this phone is Du for upgrade anytime anyway so I'm not going to bother about this phone I I when when I just looked at it and I tried to put it on I see it's not coming on but I can hear it's on you know you're getting vibrations on that phone so I left it back there anyway go to starting in the night I'm coming there and I'm getting some water and then my eyes fall upon the phone but different anointing now amen amen amen am so I look at this phone and I said come I took phone in my hand and I said Lord your word declares and I'm I'm thinking now of St John amen when Jesus is talking about he's the resurrection and the life and he says he that is dead though he be dead yet shall he live and I said Lord I want your Holy Spirit power now to go through this phone and fix it am Amen Let Your holy spirit Power go through this phone right now amen and fix every water damage amen and fix everything in this phone because your word declares that he that is though he be dead yet shall he live again am and he said this is my property and it has no reason to be dead amen and I said amen I press that button and here comes the phone back to life a second later I shows it to my wife and says here you witnessing a miracle the phone is switching on amen amen yeah now we can understand why God would do that because you know we are praying God to God for other things yes that would seem like you want him to work in this situation but God is moving us to perfect Faith oh yes amen amen now if you noticed here last week too we switched the camera off when we were praying for sister Maggie right because it's not our in intention to go and promote ourselves out there and like be boastful about what God is doing in the church yes amen this is a local church it's a sovereign church and God knows how to work with the Sovereign church now it's important for you to recognize the gift of God amen amen amen hallelujah you may be thinking that I'm not operating a gift but I am operating a gift that is why you are seeing the results in the church amen is that because of a gift in operation amen it may not be a flamboyan gift or boisterous gift a gift that's going out there my gift is to raise your faith Amen to such a level where you can believe that all things are possible yes amen amen hallelujah my gifting is not to to handle every situation and then you look at me as the man of the hour that's not my position my position as the pastor of this church is to edify the church is to build the church church is to feed the church amen until she becomes into the statue of Christ until amen she becomes in his very own image and likeness amen praise the Lord amen so now we got two different cell phones that work instantly through prayer amen no technician required amen no technician required Amen in fact it will cost you more to go there because when I went there on Thursday I paid to replace the screen and I got a fine for 500 for parking on the road so it cost me more so I need to see my attorneys it cost me more to be there so I was not prepared that is why I wasn't interested the phone I said I had a very bad experience I'm not going to take this phone back to the guy but you see what faith can do and I really was not I was not planning to have faith for the phone something happened after this was like in the late parts of the night I think it was going on to 11:00 that while I was studying the word I came into the kitchen to get water and this came over me and I took the phone you know how the prophet would say like little fish I give you back your life he said something just came over you it's a supernatural thing amen hallelujah amen so we are living in a time and season now where perfect faith is being restored back to the church amen perfect faith is coming to the church hallelujah praise the Lord amen so Sodom has got to be burned and we find every seed of negativity that you planted before God will take it out in fact I want to cancel every seed of negativity that you have spoken over your life amen amen Every Lie that's lingering over your life I cancel it in in the name of Jesus Christ and why don't you cancel it with me right now every negative thought every thought of depression every thought of worry every thought of anxiety every word that people have spoken against your life I want you to cancel it now in the name of Jesus Christ amen yes thank you Father thank you Lord because what do we find in Genesis 20 Genesis 20 finds Abraham and Sarah going Southward again they're going and they're going now and they find this king of G and you know what happens here the king sees a young beautiful now this is only you know this the king sees a young beautiful Sarah that's right but there's an old lie and a old seed that's still remaining the old lie and the old seed is that this is my sister but God is coming to remove all of it because not after the Angel's message can we still continue like like this not after he changes Abraham and Sarah's body you think he's prepared Sarah's body for the king of G to put his seed in Sarah he wants to take Sarah for wife but God stops him I'm doing a work I'm changing this people not for Satan to come and SW his seed into you amen God is building you up in faith for this hour God is building you up and changing you right now amen making you produce his life but it's not for Satan to come and have his way with you so God stops the king amen and God wants to destroy the entire nation because of this but you know ABC goes to say Lord I didn't even know it I did this with a clear conscience Lord amen the Lord tells him you didn't do this with your clear conscience I stopped you from doing this amen that's in verse 6 in 20 verse 6 amen the Lord tells him I kept you from sinning against me but you restore the man's wife back to him this church will be restored back to a headship this church has been restored back to a headship If any man wants to mishandle this bride after the Angel's message amen God will stop it amen amen God has no time amen for this bride who has been preparing to be manhandled m so God stops the king amen and then what happens the Lord tells him you go to Abraham and he tells him here that Abraham is my Prophet it's the first time that God calls Abraham his Prophet amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen you going and read verse chapter 20 let's read the last verse here now you'll be thinking hey if Abraham is a prophet can he work in signs and wonders and miracles and healings let's read there amen so you see here the Lord what he did here he closed the womb of the of the woman amen the entire so now what must they do verse 17 Abraham prayed unto God and God healed ABC these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover amen so if you've never seen healing in the Old Testament yeah it is yes through prayer Abraham prays for ABC and God heals him and his wife made servants and he reopens the wom of the woman through that amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen God's going to make you laugh again that's 21 now you know Sarah laughed in the tent let's close on this now let's read there 21 remember new body bringing forth Isaac and the Lord attended to Sarah visited Sarah and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken Sarah conceived and be Abram a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him is this the appointed time in season now for you this is the time Abraham called the name of his son whom was born unto him Sarah so he called him Isaac right let's move there's a sign of circumcision I don't want to get to this yeah now Sarah laughs again but this time is not a laugh of reasoning this time it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory God had made me to laugh and so that all that hear will laugh with me Will Rejoice with me amen will give God praise with me amen for what am I holding in my hand I'm holding my son I'm holding my son amen hallelujah
