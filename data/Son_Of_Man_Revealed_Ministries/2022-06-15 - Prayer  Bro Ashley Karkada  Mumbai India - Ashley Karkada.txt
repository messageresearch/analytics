telling god about himself the testimony do you have any kind of a testimony to tell him that lord you remember me he had a testimony god heard his prayer and extended more life to him amen prayer changes the things if you don't have a time for prayer how are you going to read the bible then if you don't have your time how are you going to listen only we are listening when the car is moving

to give him a proper time amen when i am giving a time to him for prayer if anybody comes knocks the door maybe sometimes what we do when he comes he said okay we can't will but that was a time for

when you are given a time to your wife give the time to your wife yes but commit something do something that our life should be changed yes the life should be not the same thing my brother says man the blind the blind man [Music] so you don't want to see him if he's passing today how are you going to see him if you don't have a spiritual eyes he will go past go on practice gone amen then how

night yes you have to see your condition my brother sister it's not a playing time plane time is gone now you're seeing the scripture has been fulfilled with russia and ukraine amen the scripture has fulfilled what brother graham has said the sixth phrase is fulfilled now in our front of our eyes the scripture has been fulfilled what brother branham is saying the angel of the lord is holding russia's hand amen why for one believer amen patiently waiting for us my brother sister why god is holding the hand of russia this scripture is fulfilled in our eyes yes whatever brother brandon so god is waiting for you and me my brother sister but still you are not changing how much patience god is keeping if angel of the lord that the destruction the anger of the lord if he is not holding the

will be you have to think my brother sister please this life god has given unto us and is waiting patiently glory to his name free from your mind from your worries from rest against my brother through your mind keep your mind worries of yesterday what happened don't worry yes it is gone day has come so think about today when blind man cried he got the sight when you will cry whatever you ask he will give it to you because the banana says because of the ukraine god will make upset down to save one bride and god is doing the same thing in our front in our eyes scripture has been fulfilled but still we have not warmed up to ourselves glory to his name amen his name you know what is his name meaning of name in hebrew the pure one innocent the name in hebrew but he was not a honest man he was a dishonest man he was cheating his fellow citizen he was taking money from many people because he was under roman he was under roman system and that time they used to bid for that post now also is in the government form in the customs office if you want to get some good post or good area who can make money they were bearing the same same way in those days they were bidding and he was in under roman system roman wants maybe a hundred thousand rand today so other than what you make that is yours so that's how he was cheating people he made money he'd become rich but see his name what is pronounced he was a pure pure one innocent and sakura worked under the encouraged corruption he was encouraging corruption he was working under human system [Music] when i look over in the bible and seems that every man that ever had have a spiritual office every man that is 63 0 6 investment 293 para when i look over in the bible and see that every man that ever had a spiritual office in the bible was connected with a government to got him because it was a seat of the devil amen see every common the devil is sitting in that government office and you have a spiritual office then the government will harass you you know that brother man was harassed the government was harassed him because he was taking 100 per week you are the retainer yes [Music] how they are going to read your life is not right how they are going to read how they are going to change you yourself is not changing how he is going to change bible is not a story book yes he says you are the living temple of god people is going to read you my brother sister what are you doing with this living temple who is inside you now [Music] when you walk from this earth you know what peter when he was walking from his shadow people were healed see the life the same power god wants to give you my breath amen but you don't want to receive that the same thing happened in india when brother branham hospital the people were bringing the stretcher the diseases people the sick people and they put in the road all the patience with the stretcher you know something brother banner was walking just from his shadow whole people were left they went home and our government doesn't want it that he should stay in india because the doctor also don't want that he should stay in india why because they can't make money the hospital is empty that's why god has given you the power my brother sister amen can you say that whatever was in christ he bore to jesus and whatever jesus was he brought to you what jesus is telling

a life you are living the world is in you or jesus is in you that you are to think yourself glory to his name amen let me read something to you a man ever received the holy ghost don't care whether he begs for bread or not does it make any difference to him he is a heavily born creature amen see it's not me he's a prophet is saying yes if you have a holy ghost whether you ask for bread or whether you don't ask for bread he has declared you you're the heavily grown creature amen you're not from here jesus said where i have come i'm going there amen amen and i will take you there yes his promise

care you are one your road to glory people will mock you maybe you are thinking that your process is gone let them go but you are walking on the road of heaven so if we are a heavenly creature then we will work what god is saying to us what our father is saying to us ob is better than sacrifice amen obey the word whatever says obey sacrifice is okay but first obey amen open the world glory to his name thank you jesus he says your eyes are set on christ you are it's sign oh my it's the assurance that god has received you now after a man has been filled with the holy ghost is it possible that persecution and things would cause him to have to come back and how we aren't going to lose he is still the son of god you are the still son of god my brother sister you're not going to lose anything but you're going to lose the world yes but you are going to embrace jesus amen and his word glory to his name amen he will always be because you are the sealed how long till the day of redemption that's right how long i'm telling you my brother sister you are sealed with the holy ghost your seed what ephesians 4 30 says what he says that can you read my brother that people also hear something yes because the word of god is a life unto us amen ephesians 4 30. so [Music] amen amen till what day you have seen take the time of redemption amen you know something if uh in these customs if they want to export cars so what they do when they clear the paper they put the car in the container right if anything is loose the examiner he will not give the sanction right if anything has been loosed in the container because it's going to be damaged [Music] and it's not going to seal that container if your prayer life is loose it's not going to seal you my brother sister amen if your life is not right he's not going to see you my brother sister even if it is proper then only he will see you amen the custom officer never sealed that container but once he's sealed then nobody dares to cut the

devil can lose that sin amen not even the amount of devil only the owner the seal can open you are a heavily brown creature my brother sister if your prayer life is loose it's not going to seed you once brother level dr lee will ask brother branham what is the evidence of the holy ghost dr lee will ask you know the doctor what is the evidence of the holy ghost that man was thinking is love yeah the man was thinking it's love but what angel of the lord told brother let me give that code so you will understand what i'm saying it's in 640726e broken sixteens yeah tara sixty-seven the when i was saying i said the most perfect evidence i can think is love he's saying that okay but he says but one day the lord in a vision straightened me out see in a reason what he was thinking god is telling something to you yeah that is a human mind what we think sometimes but don't think in a human mind let the mind of christ be in you he is also thinking like a human yeah definitely i will also say something like that also something yeah it's a love yeah love is a portion but he says the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word amen neither love nor speaking intense but it is receiving the word amen amen when you receive the word when you obey the word then the holy spirit will come in you amen but you don't want to receive the word and you want the holy spirit then how he's going to see you love is good because brother branham and jesus said when he went out he said love one another that was his 11th commandment but when you receive the word then the word will change you and the love will come in you amen when the love is coming you then you will have a favor with your brother and sister that's a grace and the same grace god did to us he said i have chosen you you are not chosen that was a favor he had upon us because he was loving us that's why he had a grace upon us he wrote to receive the word and he want the holy ghost first receive the word believe the word what brother branham is saying just believe he never say understand the message [Music] we don't understand [Music] same thing happened in the garden of eden the devil went straight away to the congregation he never went to the pastor if he has gone to the pastor adam then adam would have told him through the word sometimes you don't know the word then be with pastor pray for him if you're not praying for your pastor how he's going to deliver the word he is trying every week lord give me something that i will feed my church but you are not praying have you sometime given thanks to your pastor pastor today was so wonderful it was for me but you don't like correction but the courage is stand from the house of god amen and that is in a love not in a hatred but you know what connection hey pastor you are telling about me only about my family it's not that my brother because this word is connects us amen you know the word is two ages sword yes you'll go inside yeah then you have got pain they have that pain yes his world will heal you that day stay with the pastor amen if pastor says something don't be angry don't mistake him he's also a man like you and me but anytime you have appreciated him given what's up you will do what's a good morning message you will do everyone but have you done anything good my pastor i love you pastor you spoke so wonderfully today i appreciate you if you are not praying for yourself how are you going to pray for others bible says you pray one another amen right amen you're not taking the word then how the holy spirit will come yes then how you're going to go there jesus is passing today amen from this place maybe it's the last chance to change you change your life it's the last chance whether you want to change it's up to you yes whether you don't want to change it's up to you maybe jesus will pass from this side what are you going to do [Music] chakras zakat was very rich man but in curiosity he wanted to see jesus [Music] when he went to that psycho tree on the top because he was small he wanted to see jesus whatever happened see yes because he was curious he wanted to see him he was a dishonest man but still he wanted to see him we also have this honest people but we want to see him amen let the energy come that i want to see him amen let the cure become i want to see him maybe i am wrong today the message it is his grace is still now he is going to forgive you sakais was a cheater he cheated his fellow citizen but you know something when he was up on the tree [Music] jesus was passing you know jesus was passing where did they stop saying under the tree why can you say why because something connections amen the tower is coming that magnetism is coming that magnet is pulling his arm seeing bible says when he was at the top jesus was standing and looking at him how jesus knows his name how he knows his name he knows you and my name also my brother he has bought us from these denominations when lazarus died what happened only he called lazarus jesus the same way he called by name to us if jesus would call come forth all the dead bodies would have come out amen but no by name he called and the same he is calling us today by our name you have to be ready maybe it's the last time for us jesus stood and said come here come first i want to abide in your house and in that house something happened some changes has happened in intent but i'm saying when something has happened that you can see that what's happened in sakai's house something happened he repented himself but still we are not repenting we have to repent for ourselves he said if i have taken anything accusation by anything i have taken i will give fourfold see he repented we don't want to repent but we want to keep the record of others [Music] but don't keep the record of others let your record keep clean with god amen amen because at the time of brother brandon also it's happened same thing that lady one old woman she was playing and drinking something in that slot the game slot or whatever parallel game she was half half-naked but the manner was thinking in his mind lord why you are not

i don't know whether they're a believer or their unbeliever i don't know but god never forgets us amen he never forgets us my brother sister you're always with us he's the same yesterday today amen if
