[3:42] brother Caleb's working amen
[3:44] hallelujah and sister Maggie her mom's
[3:46] not sure amen this morning but amen we
[3:49] are here to Worship the Lord and give
[3:50] him praise amen let's turn to our Bibles
[3:53] amen let's turn to John 1:35
[4:06] amen we're going to be looking at John
[4:08] who the type of the
[4:10] Bride hallelujah amen you know brother
[4:12] Bram tells us that John is the type of
[4:14] the bride and he represents everything
[4:17] that the bride goes through therefore
[4:19] nothing is wit from the bride at this
[4:21] time because only John is given the Book
[4:23] of
[4:24] Revelation amen so it takes a prophet to
[4:27] reveal the book to us hallelujah
[4:30] so for title I'd say let me introduce
[4:32] you to John a type of the Bride so John
[4:35] 1:35 says again the next day after John
[4:38] stood this is John the Baptist now and
[4:41] two of his disciples and looking Upon
[4:44] Jesus as he walked he said Behold the
[4:46] Lamb of God and the two disciples heard
[4:49] him speak and they follow
[4:52] Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them
[4:54] following and said unto them what seek
[4:57] ye they said unto him Rabbi which is
[5:00] which is to say being interpreted Master
[5:02] where dwellest thou and he said unto
[5:05] them come and see now notice one of
[5:10] those disciples is
[5:12] John and when those four beasts are
[5:14] calling him he's told again come and
[5:16] see Hallelujah so the first time John
[5:19] has come and sees on the earth he said
[5:21] unto him come and see they came and saw
[5:24] where he dwelleth and with him that
[5:27] day for it was about the 10th hour
[5:30] amen hallelujah 10 is a very important
[5:32] number to
[5:33] John one of the two which heard John
[5:36] speak and followed him was Andrew Simon
[5:39] Peter's
[5:40] brother he first finded his own brother
[5:43] Simon and said unto him we have found
[5:45] the Messiah which is being interpreted
[5:47] the Christ and he brought him to Jesus
[5:50] and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou
[5:52] Art Simon the son of Jonah and thou
[5:54] shalt be called sephus which is by
[5:56] interpretation a stone amen the Lord had
[5:58] blessings to the reading of his word you
[6:00] may be
[6:04] seated amen so we are given our first
[6:08] look at the Apostle John here in this
[6:11] chapter and we see that John is a
[6:13] follower of John the
[6:15] Baptist amen he's the disciple of the
[6:18] first
[6:19] Forerunner
[6:21] Hallelujah but we see John is equipped
[6:23] with special Revelation because he is
[6:26] equipped to follow the Living Word
[6:28] manifested the word was manifested in
[6:31] John the Baptist he's able to connect
[6:34] with that Ministry because John the
[6:35] Baptist is a Living manifested Word but
[6:38] when there's a progression of the word
[6:40] he's able to follow the progression of
[6:42] the word amen amen so John means god is
[6:45] gracious amen amen God is gracious and
[6:48] if there's any people that have received
[6:51] Grace in this hour it's the Bride of the
[6:53] Lord Jesus Christ amen in fact we've
[6:55] received a double portion Grace in this
[6:57] hour because the headstone is coming
[6:59] with crys of Grace Grace amen amen so we
[7:03] see that John as we said is a type of
[7:04] the church and a type of the Bride of
[7:06] the Lord Jesus Christ amen so here he is
[7:10] a a disciple of the first four runner
[7:13] and how how beautifully is it type now
[7:16] that we were Disciples of William Bram
[7:18] the second Forerunner amen but when 63
[7:21] cames amen the head now appears amen
[7:24] hallelujah and he's introducing Rebecca
[7:27] to Isaac amen must leave just the church
[7:30] age messenger and follow the real
[7:32] messenger for the age amen which is the
[7:34] Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen
[7:37] hallelujah didn't the prophet always say
[7:39] I must decrease and he must increase
[7:43] amen too many people got married to the
[7:44] Forerunner but John won't get married to
[7:47] the Forerunner John will follow the word
[7:50] amen amen so we find here that when he's
[7:54] there at the baptis he's there at the
[7:56] river when John declares Behold the Lamb
[7:59] of God
[7:59] God now John hears this John the Apostle
[8:02] hears this and he's able to identify
[8:05] truth and he leaves John the Baptist to
[8:07] follow Jesus he doesn't denominate
[8:10] around John's message amen amen he
[8:13] doesn't denominate around John's
[8:15] Doctrine amen he doesn't denominate
[8:17] around John's baptism amen but he
[8:20] follows the manifested Living Word now
[8:22] this disciple John is called he refers
[8:25] to himself the disciple whom Jesus loved
[8:29] isn't that a beautiful thing amen he's a
[8:31] type of the Bride but he's the disciple
[8:34] whom Jesus loved and if there's ever a
[8:36] woman that Jesus loves in this hour it's
[8:38] the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:41] amen we find here amen that John we know
[8:44] he lived to be 70 years 90 years old
[8:46] amen and his writing is not like any
[8:49] other writer there's four gospels in the
[8:52] Bible but he writes differently to the
[8:54] other writers if you follow John's
[8:56] writing this man is a highly revelated
[8:59] man
[9:00] his Revelation surpasses Matthew Mark
[9:03] Luke amen hallelujah like he has
[9:07] Revelation like no other Matthew Mark
[9:09] Luke amen takes Jesus life from his
[9:11] birth amen but John is a man of
[9:14] Revelation amen he is given a special
[9:16] Grace and a favor amen he records jesus'
[9:19] birth before he came into flesh he says
[9:22] in the beginning was the word and the
[9:25] Word was God the word was with God then
[9:28] he goes down to say the word became
[9:29] flesh and dwelt amongst us amen he's
[9:33] able to identify Jesus amen hallelujah
[9:36] as the logos the was the one that came
[9:38] out of the spirit God amen amen which is
[9:41] called the Son of God so this is now MDC
[9:45] he's able to identify him as the word
[9:47] yes yes hallelujah amen and we know when
[9:51] we typing these things we can see our
[9:53] Revelation now it fits perfectly amen
[9:56] that's why brother Bram is preaching who
[9:58] is this MDC
[9:59] amen he's preaching Mighty God unveil
[10:02] he's showing us the mystery of God he's
[10:04] showing us how God condescended from
[10:06] Spirit to word to flesh yes amen amen
[10:10] hallelujah so John says the the word
[10:14] became flesh and dwelt amongst us what
[10:16] is he saying the logos the logos became
[10:20] flesh Hallelujah am amen if you only
[10:23] know what the logos meant amen
[10:25] hallelujah in the beginning amen it was
[10:27] Elohim the self-existent one amen
[10:30] hallelujah but out of him came the logos
[10:33] out of him in the logos was locked up
[10:35] all the names that was written in the
[10:36] book amen hallelujah so when the logos
[10:39] becomes flesh John is right next to
[10:41] Jesus who locked up in Jesus is all the
[10:44] names that are written in the book yes
[10:47] Hallelujah and he says all that the
[10:49] father has given me will come to me and
[10:51] not one of them is lost yes amen thank
[10:55] you Lord Jesus came to save and seek and
[10:58] save those that the names that were
[11:00] there in the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[11:03] hallelujah he didn't come amen for just
[11:05] anybody amen amen hallelujah amen
[11:09] whosoever believeth on him can get
[11:10] General salvation but the ones whose
[11:13] names are in the book have special
[11:15] privileges amen has a special access to
[11:18] the heart of God has a special access to
[11:20] the revelations of this hour Lord thank
[11:23] you amen the wife of the Lord Jesus
[11:26] Christ amen has special privileges amen
[11:29] so we find here that when one thing that
[11:31] stands out about John's introduction
[11:33] when he's writing amen John claims that
[11:35] Jesus is
[11:38] God yes if you read John chapter 1 he
[11:41] claims that Jesus is God Amen Hallelujah
[11:44] no other book details that like John
[11:46] does it amen so John here is revealing
[11:50] amen so many different things amen now
[11:53] just want to get to some quotes here
[11:54] very quickly some short quotes and we'll
[11:56] show you how that the four gospels of
[11:58] brother Bram says God's the book of
[12:00] Acts and Matthew is the lion amen
[12:04] hallelujah Mark is the ox Luke is the
[12:07] man but John is the eagle amen and he
[12:10] says in the first quote in Revelation
[12:12] chapter 4 he says boy the South Gates
[12:16] guarded by the
[12:18] ox and he says the East Gate is guarded
[12:23] by the lion so he makes a mistake and he
[12:25] corrects himself so I'm not reading that
[12:27] he says the East Gate is God by The Lion
[12:30] and the north gate is guarded by the
[12:32] Flying Eagle amen and he says John the
[12:36] Evangelist yes amen hallelujah amen now
[12:39] notice something there don't miss
[12:41] it who's at the North
[12:45] Gate come on now you reading it who is
[12:47] at the North Gate John is at the North
[12:51] Gate amen and who's trying to make a
[12:53] move on the sides of the
[12:55] north amen so whose Revelation is he
[12:58] coming after
[13:01] I'm talking about Lucifer now he said I
[13:03] will Ascend I will sit upon the sides of
[13:06] the north the size of the north is Mount
[13:08] Zion the type of the Bride amen he's not
[13:11] going to the south gate he's not going
[13:13] to the East Gate he's not going to the
[13:15] west gate but he's making a move on this
[13:17] end time prde he's trying to descend on
[13:19] the sides of the north amen but there's
[13:21] an anointing of a flying eagle at the
[13:23] northern gate amen that will counter
[13:26] every one of his attacks amen they will
[13:28] not allow allow Lucifer to sit that word
[13:31] sit if you go and look at it it means to
[13:33] be married he's trying to marry this end
[13:35] time bride he's trying to put his seed
[13:38] in her seeds of discrepancy amen but
[13:41] this bride is already pregnated with the
[13:43] word amen she'll take no manmade seed
[13:46] amen she won't fall for the lies of
[13:48] Satan amen she won't fall for the lies
[13:50] of Lucifer amen this one is born of his
[13:53] bone this one is flesh of his flesh oh
[13:56] somebody ought to praise God Amen
[14:00] hallelujah amen so we see John is a type
[14:02] of the eagle a flying eagle amen he's in
[14:06] action ready for service amen he's not a
[14:08] Sitting Duck he's a flying eagle amen
[14:11] he's not in a chicken yard clacking
[14:13] there amen he's not stretching in the
[14:15] chicken yard Hallelujah he's a flying
[14:18] eagle typing the fourth living creature
[14:20] and the spirit of a flying eagle amen
[14:22] what are they doing Eagle to Eagle
[14:24] Revelation under the fourth seal
[14:29] hope you got
[14:31] that what's the fourth c will say the
[14:34] fourth B said come and
[14:38] see who's the fourth Beast what symbol
[14:41] is he eagle and who's
[14:44] John so under the fourth seal it's Eagle
[14:46] to Eagle
[14:48] Revelation amen under the fourth seal
[14:52] all L is Unleashed upon the Earth yes
[14:55] the rider on the horse is called Death
[14:57] and All Hell follows him
[14:59] but the Beast who is the type of the
[15:01] eagle is connecting with John the eagle
[15:04] the bride and saying come and see
[15:06] because if all hell is Unleashed upon
[15:09] the Earth then all Heaven Must Be
[15:11] Unleashed upon the Earth as well that's
[15:14] what Revelation 10 is all about the
[15:16] mighty Angel descending and he not
[15:18] descending alone the host of Heaven is
[15:20] following him
[15:23] am hallelujah amen Revelation 10 is a
[15:27] time of War amen it's a time of judgment
[15:29] you'll see his feet as brass amen
[15:32] pillars of fire amen it's a time of
[15:35] investigating judgment it's a time of
[15:37] warfare amen where 200 million demons
[15:39] are on the Earth but Angelic forces are
[15:43] here amen the angel of the Lord is here
[15:45] amen with Supernatural assistance for
[15:48] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[15:50] won't leave his Eve trapped in Eden
[15:52] without Supernatural assistance amen
[15:55] open the boy's eyes is my prayer this
[15:57] morning open the church this morning to
[16:00] connect with the supernatural realm am
[16:03] amen hallelujah amen amen how many if
[16:07] you ready for Warfare this morning amen
[16:09] I'm coming to you from the dimension
[16:11] amen of heavenly places this morning and
[16:13] I pray that you can extend to that realm
[16:15] this morning Amen to be seated together
[16:17] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[16:21] hallelujah amen you're in the Sixth Seal
[16:26] and when you open the fourth seal we
[16:27] just just detail this Eagle to Eagle
[16:29] Revelation when he opened the fourth
[16:31] seal I heard the voice of the fourth
[16:32] Beast saying come now when the lamb
[16:35] opened the fourth seal let's stop here
[16:37] the fourth seal who opened it the lamb
[16:39] was anybody else worthy no one else
[16:41] could do it no the lamb opened the
[16:43] fourth seal the fourth Beast the living
[16:46] creature Like an Eagle said to John the
[16:49] eagle come and see what the fourth
[16:51] mystery of the Plan of Redemption has
[16:53] been hid in this book cuz the lamb was
[16:56] opening it in other words that's what he
[16:59] was saying there's a fork mystery here
[17:01] I've showed you in symbol now John I
[17:03] don't know whether you understood it or
[17:05] not but he wrote it down what he saw but
[17:07] it was a mystery and he wrote what he
[17:11] saw I want you to know the prophet is
[17:13] saying I don't know if John really
[17:15] understood what he wrote but even if
[17:17] that John didn't understood what he
[17:19] wrote this John this bride amen has been
[17:22] revealed the Revelation has been given
[17:24] to her what has been written because the
[17:26] writer scheme has been exposed we know
[17:29] that righty is we know that Antichrist
[17:31] system amen we know that amen he's
[17:33] fixing Satan is fixing to become
[17:35] incarnate in that beast that's right
[17:37] amen that's right so my point there was
[17:40] to show you Eagle to Eagle Revelation
[17:42] amen hallelujah the prophet in the 16 he
[17:45] says it's the eagle age that gets the
[17:48] word and the
[17:49] Revelation amen hallelujah the bride
[17:52] under messenger becomes the final voice
[17:54] to the final age Hallelujah that's a
[17:57] quote the bride under a messenger
[18:00] becomes the final voice to the final age
[18:02] so you and I have a work to do amen we
[18:05] must prophesy we must speak amen we
[18:08] cannot stay silent amen yes Lord
[18:11] hallelujah amen hallelujah Eagle to
[18:14] Eagle Revelation what we have is Eagle
[18:16] food in this hour amen the prophet of
[18:18] God says in who is this mesic after you
[18:21] recognize the very word of God was Eagle
[18:24] food Hallelujah this message of the hour
[18:28] is Eagle food
[18:29] you can't give it to chickens amen they
[18:31] can't stomach it amen you remember that
[18:33] man the B Paul shares the stest tomor
[18:37] gave him a book and and the boss came
[18:39] back very angry the next day and he said
[18:41] this man in this book he calls me a
[18:45] chicken yes and this guy told the boss
[18:48] well this man in this book calls me an
[18:50] eagle amen hallelujah people reading the
[18:54] message of the hour some get offended
[18:55] amen hallelujah but we are reading it
[18:58] and we see how ourselves in the book we
[19:00] see ourselves in the mystery
[19:02] amen after you recognize the very word
[19:06] of God was Eagle food then you left the
[19:08] other thing yes amen
[19:12] amen you left the other thing brother
[19:14] jaff brother Joshua brother Leslie Amen
[19:18] brother rames you left the other
[19:21] thing Hallelujah yes you left religions
[19:24] amen you left
[19:26] denominations you have been then formed
[19:29] into the living image of the Living God
[19:31] amen amen I want you to know if you have
[19:33] been formed into the living image of the
[19:36] Living God then I say unto you you are
[19:38] little Messiahs you can't be in the
[19:40] image of the Living God and have less
[19:42] power than him he says all authority
[19:45] I've given unto you
[19:47] amen praise the Lord the problem is
[19:51] people don't recognize their identity
[19:53] the people don't realize the power they
[19:55] possess in the power of their word amen
[19:57] always speaking negativity always
[19:59] speaking doubt always speaking fear amen
[20:03] yes sir and there's a lot of people who
[20:05] just wait to Amen to hear those
[20:08] things amen they thrive on those things
[20:10] to hear your doubt your negativity your
[20:12] reasoning amen but the bride of Christ
[20:14] is positive the bride of Christ speaks
[20:17] positive amen the bride of Christ is NE
[20:19] never
[20:20] negative no matter what the situation is
[20:23] she speaks positive amen even if it's
[20:26] just one word the bride of Christ holds
[20:28] on to that one word even sometimes she
[20:30] may not understand a whole lot of things
[20:32] but she's holding on to that one
[20:35] word thank
[20:37] you praise the Lord thank you Lord amen
[20:41] what he says you've been formed into the
[20:43] living image of the Living God you heard
[20:46] from your theophany no other group of
[20:48] people can tell you that they heard from
[20:50] their theophany in fact no other group
[20:52] of people actually know that there is a
[20:54] theop body waiting there Hallelujah we
[20:57] were given a sneak preview by the

[44:22] be a man of the earth therefore God
[44:24] couldn't come illegally into the human
[44:26] race
[44:27] he had to get a woman who would amen
[44:30] agree to his plan agree to lend the body
[44:33] so that he could come through the woman
[44:35] the seed of the
[44:37] woman amen so he came legally into the
[44:40] human race to pay the price for
[44:43] Redemption
[44:44] am amen and they're calling for they're
[44:48] calling for him is there one worthy and
[44:51] they say they searched the heaven they
[44:54] they search the Earth yes they search
[44:56] beneath the Earth
[44:57] and they said no one is
[44:59] worthy oh what a sin what a time no one
[45:04] is worthy to take back man's inheritance

[45:10] John was created to be a God on the
[45:11] earth amen amen just like us our Eternal
[45:14] home is not heaven people want to die
[45:17] and get to heaven amen Heaven is a short
[45:19] space of time we shall come back to the
[45:21] Earth we shall come back to rule and
[45:23] Reign on the earth Man was created for
[45:26] the Earth
[45:29] yes now John being a type of the Bride
[45:32] him being a man he's also not worthy to
[45:34] take the book
[45:37] hallelujah amen he's not even worthy to
[45:39] look there
[45:41] on
[45:43] hallelujah amen now remember in that
[45:46] book is the names that were written from
[45:48] before the foundation of the world so
[45:50] that book is typing the mind of
[45:53] Christ praise the Lord amen
[45:58] amen so John is crying because he wants
[46:01] to identify the ones whose names are
[46:03] written in the book before the
[46:05] foundation of the world but no one is
[46:07] found
[46:08] worthy now where was
[46:11] Jesus why couldn't they find Jesus they
[46:15] searched Heaven they searched the Earth
[46:18] they even searched beneath the Earth why
[46:20] couldn't they find
[46:23] Jesus the Bible says when he ascended he
[46:26] became the high
[46:28] priest to make intercession on our
[46:30] behalf so he in the holiest of holies he
[46:35] in the holiest of holies making
[46:37] intercession for seven Church
[46:41] ages brother Brandon will tell us and
[46:43] it's in the Bible that nobody could go
[46:45] into the holiest of holies they had to
[46:48] wait for the priest to come back
[46:50] out amen after he had P made the
[46:53] intercession after he had sprinkled the
[46:54] seven drops of blood upon the altar
[46:57] so they had to wait for the time of
[46:59] intercession to be
[47:00] over and but in the meantime John is
[47:05] crying John is weeping
[47:11] yes may I suggest to you that it's the
[47:15] Cry of John a type of the Bride his
[47:18] queen that brings him out of the
[47:21] sanctuary amen there's a grown there are
[47:24] people crying out for Redemption
[47:27] there the people on the Earth crying out

[48:43] all tears from your eyes and he knows
[48:46] exactly what to do to stop John's
[48:50] tears amen child your cries have awoken

[49:25] to put her back in her or to be
[49:27] conditioned yes no one was worthy to
[49:29] restore back to a full Glory so she
[49:32] cries out amen praise the
[49:38] Lord your cry touches his heart look
[49:42] here go up one
[49:44] context yeah let's just see it so they
[49:46] know in the same chapter Revelation 5
[49:48] the lamb only mediator he was the one
[49:51] that came forth what did he do now he's
[49:53] back the interceding until his blood is
[49:55] atoned for every person
[49:57] and the lamb knows what's written in the
[49:59] book so if we want to know what's
[50:01] written in the book we need the mind of
[50:03] Christ so he know from the foundation of
[50:06] the world the names were in there I was
[50:07] just preaching all of these things I'm
[50:08] just showing you the quote now stood

[50:24] bride he's coming out of the sanctuary
[50:27] hearing his bride cry he comes to take
[50:31] his bride amen he comes now as king he
[50:34] is looking for his Queen

[50:59] amen it was also time and season for him
[51:01] to come back
[51:03] out
[51:06] hallelujah praise the Lord now you must
[51:08] also make John

[51:13] worthy Revelation 10 he suddenly asked
[51:16] to take the book so he must make the
[51:18] bride worthy and the only way he can
[51:21] make the bride Worthy is to justify
[51:24] her amen and to justify you means as

[51:29] place meaning all your past sins are
[51:32] forgiven not only forgiven but it's

[54:27] 24 Elders you know they cast their
[54:30] crowns yes right but let's look at the
[54:33] identity of the 24
[54:37] Elders they asked brother brandham a
[54:39] question in question and answers Hebrews
[54:42] chapter 3 they asked him who are the 24
[54:45] Elders then now he says he's reading the
[54:48] verse for you Revelation the four
[54:50] chapter and 10th verse and the 4 and 20
[54:53] Elders fell down before him that sat on
[54:55] the throne
[54:57] and worshiped him that liveth forever
[54:59] and ever and cast their crowns Before
[55:01] the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh
[55:04] Lord to receive glory and honor for thou
[55:07] has created all things and for thy
[55:09] pleasure they were
[55:11] created right now he says this he's
[55:14] going to give the answer who are the 24
[55:17] Elders the 24 elders and elders and
[55:20] overseer now notice there were 12
[55:23] Patriarchs and 12 Apostles amen
[55:29] I'm letting it digest so you understand
[55:31] some of you need to calculate who the 12
[55:33] Patriots
[55:35] were do it
[55:37] quickly was Abraham there yes is Abraham
[55:41] one of them casting come on people amen
[55:44] Church of God spiritual thinking caps
[55:46] now Abraham is there Isaac is there
[55:51] Israel Jacob is there amen 12 Patriarchs
[55:56] hallelujah amen let's give identity to
[56:00] them the prophet is identifying who they
[56:03] are some of you feel shy to say amen
[56:06] amen hallelujah you you you never
[56:09] probably understood it this way but I'm
[56:11] telling you this morning identify who
[56:12] they are because I'm trying to show you
[56:14] a point right
[56:15] now so 12 Patriarchs Old Testament and
[56:21] 12 Apostles
[56:23] yes hallelujah amen
[56:27] the Old
[56:28] Testament and the 12 apostles on the
[56:31] other side of the New Testament didn't
[56:33] Jesus say you'll sit on 12 Thrones
[56:35] judging the 12 tribes of Israel they
[56:38] sitting at the
[56:41] throne praise the
[56:47] Lord now here's
[56:49] John caught up in the spirit
[56:52] realm everybody paying attention amen
[56:56] John caught up in the spirit
[56:58] realm but John is also one of the 12
[57:01] disciples
[57:03] amen so John sees
[57:08] John
[57:11] Hallelujah John is one of the 12
[57:15] apostles so John is taken up and John
[57:18] sees
[57:20] himself John sees
[57:23] himself in chapter 4
[57:26] taking his crown and casting it down and
[57:29] worshiping I wonder if that's one of the
[57:31] reasons why John was crying because he
[57:33] was trying to connect with this theop
[57:35] body Hallelujah give God praise
[57:38] somebody come on put your oxygen tank
[57:40] you're going deep now amen John sees
[57:43] John Hallelujah you know if the prophet
[57:46] is making comments like this there must
[57:48] be scriptural backing and here's a
[57:49] scriptural backing for it John sees John
[57:52] amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord
[57:55] praise the Lord
[57:56] so if the apostles they were sitting
[57:58] there bowing down casting the crowns
[58:00] amen worshiping with the theop body of
[58:02] John amen and John wants to be United
[58:04] with his theophonic body and he cannot
[58:06] go there because of the breach the
[58:08] Redeemer so that's why when he comes out
[58:11] and he takes the book Heaven erupts with
[58:15] praise there's an eruption of Praise
[58:18] there's an eruption of worship Amen
[58:20] brother Brandon will say all of Heaven
[58:22] even on the earth they heard John scream
[58:24] for Joy jump for joy and John is the
[58:26] type of the Bride if they were shouting
[58:28] in heaven they ought to be shouting on
[58:30] the earth to be able to see your name in
[58:32] the book to be able to be connected with
[58:34] your theop
[58:36] body thank you
[58:38] Lord hallelujah praise the Lord let's go
[58:41] to the next quote there he says in 298
[58:43] of the breach you know that got next to
[58:46] John he must have seen his name wrote
[58:48] there when them seals broke he must have
[58:51] got real happy listen to what he said

[58:56] the earth under the Earth within the sea
[58:59] all that's in them heard me I blessings

[59:08] the throne now I encourage you if you
[59:10] don't know what to praise the Lord take
[59:12] this line that's you worshiping him in
[59:14] Revelation form amen blessing and honor
[59:17] and glory and power to him that sits
[59:20] upon the throne and to the lamb forever
[59:23] amen amen amen and the four peace said
[59:26] amen and the four and 20 Elders fell
[59:28] down and worshiped him that lives
[59:30] forever and ever John watched his theop
[59:33] body worship and give God praise
[59:36] amen hallelujah he says talk about a
[59:39] Jubilee He says talk about a time amen
[59:41] when the lamb walked forth see the book
[59:45] is even sealed in heaven the Mysteries
[59:47] are say is my name there I don't know
[59:50] talk about a happy time yeah he goes on
[59:53] when them seals broke John must have
[59:55] looked in and seen pass the curtain of
[59:57] time what's beyond the curtain of
[59:59] time amen beyond the curtain of time
[1:00:04] brother Bram s
[1:00:05] thees yeah he's saying John must have
[1:00:08] looked and seen past the curtain of time
[1:00:10] and said there is
[1:00:14] John hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[1:00:18] let's close now very quickly

[1:00:49] perfection amen the number three in the
[1:00:51] Bible represents Perfection Divine oness
[1:00:54] the father Son and the Holy Spirit
[1:00:56] represented in the number three in 1
[1:00:58] John 5:7 it says for there are three
[1:01:00] that bear record in heaven the Father
[1:01:03] the word and the Holy Ghost and these
[1:01:05] three are one amen three is

[1:03:09] refilling of the Holy Ghost meaning that
[1:03:12] come a time when the Holy Ghost will
[1:03:14] pour himself out in another pouring in
[1:03:16] the
[1:03:18] hour praise the Lorden the number 10 is
[1:03:22] seen as a symbol of completion and
[1:03:23] wholeness amen perfection amen it is

[1:03:33] 10 Generations from Adam to Noah amen

[1:03:37] symbols of new beginnings and a fresh
[1:03:40] start he can also Mark the beginning of
[1:03:42] a new cycle and the completion of an old
[1:03:45] one because the old cycle is finished
[1:03:48] amen the old cycle meant that the book
[1:03:50] was without title deed for all these
[1:03:52] years but in Revelation 10 starts a new
[1:03:54] cycle the book is back amen amen the
[1:03:58] book is back what you saw lost in

[1:04:30] is the wicked one he's coming in a time
[1:04:32] of investigating
[1:04:35] judgment this is now Genesis 18 he's
[1:04:37] coming down to lot to destroy Sodom and
[1:04:41] gomorra but before he goes to destroy
[1:04:43] them he stops by the way of Abraham
[1:04:46] yes praise the
[1:04:50] Lord
[1:04:52] hallelujah that's why people get
[1:04:53] confused they say no revelation 10 the
[1:04:56] angel is going directly to the
[1:04:58] Jews well in in Genesis 18 he could have
[1:05:01] gone directly to Sodom and
[1:05:03] Gomorrah but he made a stop Amen to give

[1:05:53] the way back to heaven and being being
[1:05:55] restored to John in Revelation 10 who is
[1:05:58] now the rightful owner of the book amen
[1:06:01] yes only the bride is the rightful owner
[1:06:04] of the book of redemption only the bride
[1:06:07] if somebody wants to find the title deed
[1:06:10] to man's inheritance they can't find it
[1:06:12] in a physical form it's now in a
[1:06:14] manifested form because John took the
[1:06:16] book and John consumed the book amen the

[1:08:34] yes now John you know he's called John
[1:08:39] is called the Apostle of
[1:08:41] love that's the Apostle of Charity amen
[1:08:45] praise the Lord amen what descends upon
[1:08:48] the
[1:08:50] individual and the bride as a whole when
[1:08:52] she reaches the statue of a perfect man
[1:08:56] charity hallelu charity comes and
[1:08:58] captures your life charity comes upon
[1:09:01] the believer charity comes upon the
[1:09:03] church John the type of the Bride is the
[1:09:06] Apostle of love come on I'm talking
[1:09:08] about you you are the Apostle of love
[1:09:11] you are the Apostle of Charity you'll
[1:09:13] say but I thought the edstone is coming
[1:09:14] with Charity amen you can't be any
[1:09:17] different from the edstone you can't be
[1:09:19] any different from the bridegroom you
[1:09:21] must be connected with him to dovil so
[1:09:24] if he is charity than the bright is
[1:09:28] Charity Hallelujah charity is the
[1:09:30] Capstone of the amen The Headstone come
[1:09:33] to cap the church amen Corinthians 13
[1:09:36] talks about charity we know God is love
[1:09:38] amen so perfectly fitting for John who
[1:09:41] types the bride the wife of the Lord
[1:09:43] Jesus Christ to be called the Apostle of
[1:09:45] love the Apostle of Charity why here's a
[1:09:48] quote to
[1:09:49] close he being the groom the bride has
[1:09:52] to come forth cuz it's part of him amen
[1:09:56] hallelujah this is it is the rising of
[1:09:58] the sun he being the groom the bride has
[1:10:00] to come forth cuz it's part of him and
[1:10:03] it can only be the manifestation of the
[1:10:05] fulfilling of all the Revelation any
[1:10:08] others have spoken of the Bride it can
[1:10:10] only manifest if it does something
[1:10:12] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:10:14] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:10:18] she is bone of his bone life of his life
[1:10:21] power of his power she is him amen so I
[1:10:25] tell you the bride is Charity in this
[1:10:27] hour
[1:10:29] Hallelujah I don't have time to read the
[1:10:31] quote now but the prophet says what the
[1:10:33] Catholic church is doing is a perversion
[1:10:35] of what the bride ought to be doing
[1:10:37] because forgiveness lay in the bride
[1:10:39] they are giving themselves fathers will
[1:10:41] say go do three ill marries your sins
[1:10:43] are forgiven but he says the commission
[1:10:45] given to the apostles and the Bride of
[1:10:47] Jesus Christ whosoever sin you remit
[1:10:49] they are remit and whosoever sin you
[1:10:52] retain they are retained so the bride
[1:10:54] has a Ministry on the earth in know his
[1:10:56] perfection in know his charity in know
[1:10:58] is Judgment in his power to forgive
[1:11:02] sins so you can hold it against somebody
[1:11:05] or you can say go and sin no more but
[1:11:07] the bride is born of his bone she knows
[1:11:09] how to speak the bride is flesh of his
[1:11:11] flesh so where he displayed attributes
[1:11:13] of Charity she will display attributes
[1:11:15] of
[1:11:17] Charity Hallelujah in fact the bride and
[1:11:20] and the groom are so in Union that you
[1:11:22] you can hardly tell one one apart from
[1:11:24] the other in fact they complete one
[1:11:26] another's sentences
[1:11:28] amen they are so in Union they are so in
[1:11:31] love amen

[1:11:37] the
[1:11:38] couch when they fighting I don't know
[1:11:41] why you're fighting with the Lord he

[1:11:50] bosom amen amen thank you Lord embrace
[1:11:54] him
