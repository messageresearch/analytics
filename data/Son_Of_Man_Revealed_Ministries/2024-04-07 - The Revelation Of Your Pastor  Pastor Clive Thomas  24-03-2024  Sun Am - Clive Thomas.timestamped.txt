[0:19] details because you told me the last
[0:21] time you were coming and I quite
[0:24] surprised when I saw you here this

[0:56] hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord
[0:59] amen today Service as a reminder to the
[1:01] world that our Lord Jesus
[1:03] Christ amen on the third day he rose
[1:05] again amen so we come to honor the
[1:08] resurrection amen many people are still
[1:10] debating and fasting whether they should
[1:12] gather on the Saturday amen because they
[1:15] say the Sabbath but we know our Lord
[1:17] Jesus Christ fulfilled the law yes so
[1:20] once somebody fulfills the law it no
[1:22] longer needs to be kept as a tradition
[1:26] as a formality amen because there was
[1:28] one man who was found worthy to fulfill
[1:31] the whole law and we enter our rest when
[1:34] we enter into Christ amen that's our
[1:36] rest Christ Jesus amen then we are set
[1:39] free from all Traditions all carnal
[1:41] formalities and and ways of men amen you
[1:44] may be seated praise the Lord
[1:47] hallelujah amen so we wish our brother
[1:49] jefford a happy birthday amen amen I
[1:51] pray that the Lord will continue to
[1:52] bless you keep you by his grace amen
[1:54] thank you for the song blessed with it
[1:56] amen amen
[1:58] hallelujah amen you know part of any
[2:01] celebration ought to be singing yes
[2:03] worship amen and Praises going forth
[2:06] amen amen hallelujah you know there's a
[2:08] thing called Palm Sunday that people are
[2:10] celebrating it was the week before the
[2:13] crucifixion and it's when they lay down
[2:15] the palm branches and our lord Jesus was
[2:17] marching through the streets and they
[2:19] were singing hosana amen hosana blessed
[2:23] is he who comes in the name of the Lord
[2:26] amen amen hallelujah so when we come
[2:28] into the house of the Lord the also are
[2:30] to be shouts of joy and victory in the
[2:33] tents of the righteous of the Lord amen
[2:36] hallelujah amen so we haven't come here
[2:38] now to for funeral service but we've
[2:40] come here to honor the resurrection of
[2:42] our Lord Jesus Christ amen so the song
[2:45] service goes before the preaching to
[2:47] prepare the hearts because you're coming
[2:49] from different atmospheres different
[2:51] walks of life different Spirits amen
[2:53] influencing you but you come now and you
[2:55] submit yourself under the anointing of
[2:57] the spirit allow the music to play amen
[3:00] you remember when the prophet had a bad
[3:02] Spirit Prophet Elijah amen he called a
[3:04] minstral he said bring me a minstral and
[3:07] the music started to change the
[3:09] atmosphere amen so therefore it's
[3:11] vitally important also for the musicians
[3:13] the singers Amen to be prayed up not to
[3:16] come into the house of God app as it as
[3:18] well but there also ought to be a
[3:20] preparation there also ought to be a
[3:22] practice because David says play
[3:24] skillfully before the Lord amen amen so
[3:27] they are here to set the right
[3:28] atmosphere to bring into the right
[3:30] atmosphere of worship amen so when we
[3:32] come we ought not to hold back our
[3:34] worship yes amen but we ought to lift up
[3:37] our hands and begin to praise the Lord
[3:39] begin to worship Him amen don't worry
[3:41] about being dignified in his presence
[3:43] amen don't worry about amen Church
[3:46] Behavior amen but when the Holy Ghost
[3:48] comes Upon Us amen then we start to move
[3:51] and we start to act and we start to
[3:52] Worship the Lord amen you know David's
[3:55] wife was ashamed with the way you
[3:56] Worship the Lord but he was not
[3:58] worshiping for her he was worshiping the
[4:01] Lord in spirit amen hallelujah so we not
[4:03] how to be ashamed when we worshiping our
[4:05] Lord and he said if you thought that was
[4:07] bad he said wait till tomorrow amen I'm
[4:09] going to show you a better dance a
[4:10] better praise amen so we love the Lord
[4:14] and we we're happy to be in the house of
[4:15] the Lord this morning amen we have with
[4:17] us this morning amen our dear Pastor
[4:20] Clive his dear wife amen let's give our

[4:29] to us amen and uh our Elder in the faith

[4:36] in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and he's
[4:38] doing a fine work out there in amas with

[4:41] are growing in Grace amen hallelujah so
[4:44] don't forget the Easter convention

[4:50] starting on Friday Saturday and Sunday
[4:52] so the Friday will be two Services you

[5:00] and Sunday at 10:00 a.m. and 400 p.m. so
[5:02] you look forward to that meetings but I
[5:05] also want you to start to pray for these
[5:06] meetings yes because next weekend is
[5:09] going to be a lot of activity in the
[5:11] spiritual realm amen they're having the
[5:14] Festival of Chariots amen so demon
[5:17] powers are going to be around amen
[5:18] hallelujah and you see now they gone
[5:20] into uh Ramadan and they they coinciding
[5:23] with the Jewish feast amen hallelujah of
[5:26] Passover so what I'm saying the
[5:28] spiritual Realm is going to be full of
[5:31] activity
[5:33] amen I'm talking to spiritual people who
[5:37] understand spiritual things amen so you
[5:39] ought to pray yes amen that there is a
[5:41] breakthrough in the spiritual realm amen
[5:44] when people come into the convention
[5:45] they're not just coming for another
[5:47] Easter convention and a church gathering
[5:49] in that convention I am praying there is
[5:51] Deliverance there is healing there is
[5:53] restoration amen the power of God will
[5:56] be on display amen amen hallelujah you
[5:59] know the of Jesus Christ is not a
[6:00] powerless Army but we are a powerful
[6:02] Army we're an invincible Army amen
[6:05] hallelujah and can you imagine the
[6:07] anointing that's going to be in that
[6:08] place because each one of us carries a
[6:10] lick of fire amen each one of us carries
[6:13] an anointing but when we all come
[6:15] together amen there's going to be one
[6:17] great big bonfire and the devil is in
[6:19] for a problem amen so we are telling him
[6:21] right now you better not show up amen
[6:24] hallelujah because bodies are going to
[6:26] be delivered demon Spirits are going to
[6:28] be on the Run
[6:30] amen hallelujah so you pray for these
[6:32] meetings we are entering a time of
[6:34] spiritual warfare is what I'm trying to
[6:36] tell you amen hallelujah so the devil
[6:39] will try to come and into the meeting
[6:40] he'll also try to hinder you from coming
[6:42] to the meetings but you overcome you
[6:45] already identify his tactics amen praise

[7:05] even as he ministers you pull on the
[7:06] word you know I don't know if you pick
[7:09] up these things but there's a certain
[7:11] time in the in the service where the
[7:12] spirit of the Lord drops down the
[7:14] atmosphere changes when the Pres angel
[7:16] of his presence is here that's a time
[7:19] for you not to remain silent but speak

[11:44] 15
[11:45] amen the Bible says I will give you
[11:50] pastors according to Mine
[11:53] Heart what shall feed you with knowledge
[11:56] and understanding amen now please take
[12:00] note for those of you who
[12:03] believed or still believe that you put
[12:07] your hand up and voted Pastor Adrian in
[12:10] you are
[12:13] wrong because the Bible tells us I will
[12:16] give you pastors amen amen according to
[12:21] my
[12:22] heart Hallelujah so God anointed you to
[12:25] raise your hand God anointed you to do
[12:28] the voting or whatever you did
[12:31] Hallelujah to select your pastor and
[12:33] elect your pastor but my brothers and
[12:35] sisters Hallelujah the Bible says and I
[12:37] will give you pastors according to my
[12:40] heart amen so the pastor that you have
[12:44] that is a pastor of this Tabernacle is a
[12:47] pastor that God
[12:48] gave hallelujah amen which shall feed
[12:53] you with knowledge and understanding
[12:56] hallelujah praise the lord it's on the
[12:59] projection there amen and I believe and
[13:02] for those of you who don't know I
[13:04] respect Pastor Adrian's Ministry and I
[13:07] respect it a lot amen amen and what you
[13:09] need to understand is that you have a
[13:11] pastor who's got a very powerful
[13:13] Ministry at the moment amen hallelujah
[13:16] so it says here which shall feed you
[13:18] with knowledge and understanding the
[13:21] next scripture I want to read is Isaiah
[13:24] Isaiah chapter
[13:28] 40 and verse
[13:37] 11 hallelujah amen praise the Lord the
[13:40] Bible says he shall feed his
[13:44] flock are you with me like a
[13:48] shepherd He Shall Gather the Lambs with
[13:51] his arm and carry them in his
[13:54] bosom and shall
[13:57] gently leave those that are with young
[14:01] amen amen hallelujah let's turn to the
[14:05] next scripture which is Acts chapter
[14:11] 20 acts 20:
[14:14] 28 the Bible says take heed therefore
[14:17] unto
[14:18] yourselves and to all the
[14:21] flock over which the Holy Ghost had made
[14:26] you overseers yes Amen to feed the
[14:30] Church of God which he had purchased
[14:34] with his own blood amen for I know this
[14:38] that after my departing shall Grievious
[14:42] wolves enter in among you not sparing
[14:45] the
[14:46] flock I'll show you just now in one of
[14:49] the quotations the
[14:51] importance of the pastor's role when it
[14:54] comes to Grievous wolves coming in amen
[14:58] all also of yourselves shall men
[15:02] arise speaking perverse things to draw
[15:06] away disciples after
[15:08] them let me not make no bones about this
[15:12] Hallelujah also of yourselves are
[15:15] highlighted in red here also of
[15:17] yourselves shall men
[15:19] arise I don't want to prophesy but I
[15:22] want to kill that spirit amen are you
[15:25] with me the Bible says also of yourself
[15:29] men shall
[15:31] arise amen speaking perverse things to
[15:35] draw away disciples after them this is
[15:38] the cause of breakaways in churches amen
[15:43] hallelujah and my last scripture before
[15:45] I ask you to take your seat is Hebrew
[15:49] chapter
[15:54] 13 and verse
[15:57] 17
[15:59] the Bible says obey them that have rule
[16:02] over you
[16:05] amen and submit
[16:07] yourselves amen for they watch for your
[16:13] souls as they that must give account
[16:18] that they may do it with joy and not
[16:21] with grief amen for that is unprofitable
[16:25] for you the Bible says obey them that
[16:27] have rule over you spiritually speaking
[16:29] who has ruled over you your pastor and
[16:33] submit yourselves amen for the watch for
[16:37] your souls yes amen Pastor Adrian's main
[16:41] interest Hallelujah is yes we thank God
[16:45] for the convention we thank God for the
[16:47] programs we thank God for the services
[16:49] we thank God for all of that but the
[16:51] main purpose is to ensure that all of
[16:54] you make the Rapture that is the main
[16:57] purpose amen so he says for watch your
[17:00] souls as they must give
[17:03] account Hallelujah the pastor must give
[17:05] account for his local assembly and if
[17:08] you c a revelation your soul is in the
[17:11] hands of the pastor and he's got to
[17:14] present it to the Lord one of these days
[17:16] and he's got to account for your soul
[17:20] hallelujah amen must give account that
[17:22] they may do it with joy yes you know
[17:25] sometimes at funerals Pastor Adrian we
[17:28] go to funerals and I'm not a liar I tell
[17:30] you the way it
[17:31] is you know some some some places you go
[17:34] and the coffin is there and somebody is
[17:36] there and these pastors are lying
[17:38] through their
[17:40] teeth Hallelujah they are lying through
[17:43] their teeth saying this brother was so
[17:46] good and this brother was that and that
[17:47] and that and this brother is going to
[17:49] make it in the Rapture is going to you
[17:53] know Hallelujah and in times like that I
[17:56] don't lie maybe I'll give you an idea
[17:58] idea I just come there and I say this
[18:01] brother had his
[18:02] life however he lived his life you
[18:05] know but I'm not here to preach to him
[18:08] he's dead and he's gone I'm here to
[18:09] preach to you so let's
[18:11] preach that's how I run away from
[18:14] telling lies hallelujah amen and the
[18:17] Bible says and they would do it
[18:19] Hallelujah and they may do it with joy
[18:21] and not with grief for that is
[18:24] unprofitable for you my topic today is
[18:27] the revelation of your pastor let's bow
[18:31] our heads and close our eyes our most
[18:33] gracious and Eternal Father we thank you
[18:36] we thank you for this opportunity that
[18:38] we could come behind the sacred desk
[18:40] amen oh Father a sacred desk almighty
[18:42] God that belongs to this local
[18:44] Tabernacle and Father in Heaven they
[18:46] have entrusted me oh Lord to come behind
[18:48] this sacred desk and I pray oh Lord even
[18:52] as I encourage the church this morning
[18:54] oh Father through the holy ghost that
[18:56] they oh Lord will get closer Mighty God
[18:59] to you that they will catch a revelation
[19:01] of their past oh Father in heaven and
[19:04] Father in Heaven as we move forward oh
[19:06] father as they give oh Father honor to
[19:08] their Pastor oh Father who who leads
[19:11] them and soul is in his hands oh Lord
[19:14] and he's got to give an account we ask
[19:16] father that you would bless each one of
[19:18] us bless the reading of the word bless
[19:19] the inspiration as well and take full
[19:22] control of Our Lives this morning in
[19:24] Jesus mighty name we pray and all God's
[19:27] people say amen amen Hallelujah you may
[19:29] take your seats Hallelujah I was
[19:31] preaching one time in India and I forgot
[19:33] to tell them to sit down and they stood
[19:35] there for the whole 1 and a half hours
[19:37] and I thought they were all anointed
[19:39] Hallelujah and later on I heard and I
[19:42] asked the pastor why didn't people sit
[19:43] down he said because you didn't tell
[19:45] them
[19:46] to
[19:47] Hallelujah
[19:53] am
[19:55] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen my
[19:59] brothers and sisters I've got a few
[20:02] points around your
[20:04] pastor and also me but not so much me
[20:08] because you're going to kind of take
[20:11] stock and sorting to put you on the
[20:12] spotlight Pastor Hallelujah you might
[20:16] Hallelujah but uh I believe whatever I'm
[20:19] saying here because I know Pastor Adrian
[20:21] amen he's got his heart in the right
[20:23] place amen hallelujah and so the first
[20:26] point that I want to make amen and most
[20:29] of the things that I want to say Amen
[20:31] I'm not going to be Evangelistic because
[20:33] it's the type of thought that we have
[20:35] today uh the first thing that we need to
[20:37] understand amen hallelujah is that uh he
[20:41] is supposed to be a righteous man
[20:44] obviously a pastor can't be an
[20:45] unrighteous man Hallelujah and the
[20:47] prophet says my brothers and sisters in
[20:50] the message 1952 I am the resurrection
[20:53] and the life amen hallelujah the next
[20:56] slide please Hallelujah he says this is
[20:59] the house of
[21:00] judgment the house of God where God
[21:04] comes down and passes his
[21:08] judgment your
[21:10] pastor is supposed to be a righteous
[21:14] man the
[21:16] congregations supposed to be with him
[21:20] 100% amen yes those of you
[21:24] 99 98 and downwards we'll have all call
[21:28] for you
[21:34] later the pastor is supposed to be a
[21:36] righteous man Hallelujah and that we
[21:39] agree 100% the congregation supposed to
[21:42] be with him
[21:44] 100% you are supposed to be just 100%
[21:50] together if your pastor says we're going
[21:54] left then all of you must go left if
[21:57] your pastor says right we've got to go
[22:00] right now what happens is sometimes amen
[22:04] we feel that we are longer than the
[22:07] pastor in the
[22:09] message sometimes we feel that we know
[22:11] more quotations and we read the church
[22:14] ages 10 times and the seals 20 times and
[22:17] therefore we can actually give the page
[22:19] number and the paragraph number and
[22:22] therefore we know better than the pastor
[22:25] but remember the pastor is the man that
[22:26] has been called by God appointed by God
[22:29] and has been placed here by God
[22:32] am he's been given to you to lead you
[22:35] brothers and sisters you know on wedes
[22:38] day we had a service and we spoke on
[22:41] obedience and you know brothers and
[22:44] sisters uh let me just say this in
[22:49] context many of times the brothers are
[22:52] gone to
[22:54] work so when we go to work at 7:00 we go
[22:57] to work or 6:00 or whatever whatever
[22:58] time you go to work and you only arrive
[23:00] home at 6: 5 6 in the
[23:04] afternoon in the meantime the wife woke
[23:07] up she had breakfast she did whatever
[23:09] she can she went into prayer she then
[23:13] put a message on she listened to the
[23:16] message for 2 hours which you didn't
[23:18] listen to yet are all of you with me and
[23:22] then uh uh you know eventually she goes
[23:25] and reads the Bible or reads a message
[23:27] or do does whatever it
[23:29] and at the end of the day when you come
[23:31] home you know not all of us are
[23:33] preachers Brothers yes but the Bible was
[23:37] very clear and he says you sisters stay
[23:39] silent in the
[23:41] churches and if you want to know
[23:43] anything yes you go home and ask your
[23:46] husband
[23:48] yes now some of us that's the word right
[23:51] amen and some of you sisters believe you
[23:53] know more than your
[23:55] husband it might be
[23:57] true are you with me because you got
[24:00] more time to spend in the word than your
[24:02] husband and when he comes from work he's
[24:05] tired and the amount of time he spends
[24:07] in the word compared to how much time
[24:09] you spend you might not you might know
[24:12] more but what does the Bible say Amen
[24:15] the Bible says still go to ask him amen
[24:19] yes the Bible doesn't say that you need
[24:21] to go minister to your husband the
[24:24] there's an order in the Bible amen and
[24:26] the Bible is saying brothers and sister
[24:28] sisters keep silent in the church if you
[24:30] have any question go home and ask your
[24:32] husband now some sisters believe no
[24:35] what's the use when and asking my
[24:36] husband what does he
[24:37] know are you with me that thing of what
[24:40] does he know be very careful the Bible
[24:43] clearly says go and ask him yes
[24:46] Hallelujah whether he knows it or he
[24:48] doesn't know it your job is to ask him
[24:50] Hallelujah and if he doesn't know he'll
[24:52] consult his pastor and give you the
[24:54] answer but my brothers and sisters what
[24:56] you also need to understand here how
[24:58] is when it comes to the
[25:00] pasture of the Tabernacle a young man
[25:04] groomed under a very good Ministry amen
[25:08] hallelujah but you might be older in age
[25:11] you might be older in the message you
[25:14] might not no more but what does the
[25:16] Bible say he is your pastor amen he is
[25:19] your shepherd He is your leader and if
[25:23] he says this way the reason why there's
[25:26] Corruptions in the churches is because
[25:29] some people are pulling this way and
[25:30] some people are pulling that way and
[25:32] they are
[25:34] disobeying the rulership of the
[25:37] Tabernacle amen hallelujah so brothers
[25:39] and sisters whether you know more or or
[25:42] whatever it is when the pastor says you
[25:45] just follow and watch the blessing over
[25:47] your life amen I say watch The Blessing
[25:50] over your life amen I'll give you an
[25:53] example and live examples you know
[25:56] brothers and sisters there was one
[25:59] time amen when I first got into the
[26:02] ministry about 20 years ago not Ministry
[26:05] when I first became a pastor about 20
[26:07] years ago and uh you know there was
[26:10] there were other brothers and there was
[26:11] one brother who got into the message
[26:13] long long before
[26:15] me and uh and he was a deacon and so
[26:20] brothers and sisters he one day he sat
[26:23] with me in the presence of an
[26:25] unbelieving home we went to minister
[26:27] there and and he then told the
[26:29] unbelievers he said you see your pastor
[26:31] you see our pastor here hallelujah I can
[26:34] teach him a few things in the house of
[26:37] an
[26:38] unbeliever I know more than him I've
[26:40] been long in the message I've been that
[26:42] and that and that you know brothers and
[26:44] sisters Hallelujah just by making those
[26:49] statements he dropped his point of
[26:52] leadership in other words he never had
[26:54] leadership he believed he can lead
[26:56] himself yeah that was his greatest
[26:59] mistake yes this is what happened number
[27:03] one he was a manager at
[27:05] Toyota he lost his
[27:09] job I'm not giving anybody threats but
[27:12] I'm just telling you obedience and
[27:14] Disobedience yes that's right it's a
[27:17] very very uh uh uh it's a very serious
[27:20] matter yes amen and so brothers and
[27:23] sisters number one he lost his
[27:26] job as he came
[27:29] home tried to do one or two things and
[27:32] then he he tested
[27:35] God by doing something else he tested
[27:37] God but one day he came to my house and
[27:40] he together with his family and we were
[27:43] dealing with a matter and he said no no
[27:44] no Pastor uh uh you know uh uh let death
[27:52] strike and I said but you know that's a
[27:55] very serious statement you know when we
[27:56] make statements we don't realize there's
[27:58] a God that is alive amen when we make
[28:01] statements we make it from an
[28:03] intellectual concept not realizing that
[28:06] we're dealing with spiritual matters
[28:07] with a god that is alive amen hallelujah
[28:10] so watch your mouth and watch what you
[28:12] say so this brother just made blurted
[28:15] out that statements and he said you know
[28:17] what this is how we we we can't get
[28:19] anywhere with this whoever it is let
[28:20] them
[28:21] die but the brother was siding with his
[28:24] wife and he and trying to show him that
[28:26] do not side with your wife your your
[28:28] wife might be
[28:29] wrong few weeks Down the Line a fit
[28:33] woman went to the hospital for some pain
[28:35] in the chest and on that Sunday
[28:39] morning she then couldn't breathe and
[28:41] she lost her life I'm talking about
[28:44] Weeks
[28:46] Later thereafter things went wrong and
[28:49] wrong and wrong until he left the
[28:53] message completely left the
[28:56] message Hallelujah and the simple reason
[28:59] is because the first point is he came
[29:04] against leadership
[29:06] amen amen hallelujah the Bible says here
[29:10] the congregation supposed to be with him
[29:13] 100% you are supposed to be just 100%
[29:17] together are all of you with me amen
[29:19] amen this is the truth and this is what
[29:22] the prophet says hallelujah so therefore
[29:25] if you feel I'm a bit hard but at least
[29:28] we're helping somebody amen and in there
[29:31] if you're not then Satan's got a way to
[29:33] get to get in you got a loophole
[29:37] somewhere
[29:39] so have everything cleared out amen
[29:44] hallelujah second thing my brothers and
[29:46] sisters I said number one Hallelujah
[29:48] he's got to be Hallelujah a righteous
[29:52] man amen number
[29:54] two he is a Watchman over his flock
[29:57] right amen hallelujah now what is a
[30:00] Watchman a Watchman is somebody that
[30:03] goes onto a tower yeah and he's able to
[30:06] see something that you cannot
[30:09] see very much related to my first
[30:12] point all of you with me you might think
[30:15] from the quotations and you might think
[30:17] from your intellect and you might think
[30:20] from your own understanding that what
[30:22] I'm doing is right and the pastor might
[30:25] be saying but this is not the way to go
[30:27] yes
[30:28] and my brothers and sisters the reason
[30:30] why he's got a conviction of that is
[30:33] because he's a Watchman he can see
[30:35] around the corner where you cannot
[30:38] see amen someone driving at 120 km down
[30:42] the road amen and all of a sudden
[30:45] there's a bu there's a board on the side
[30:47] that says slow down to 60 km
[30:51] yeah do you know why that body is there
[30:54] that body is there because somebody
[30:56] drove before m
[30:58] and somebody knows that there's a sharp
[31:00] Bend and there's a cliff going down and
[31:04] at 120 km you will not make that corner
[31:07] but somebody's been there before
[31:10] somebody saw it before and you are
[31:12] coming down at 120 and if you
[31:15] disobey you will end up down the cliff
[31:18] yes amen but if you obey the board and
[31:21] you slow down to 60 km per hour my
[31:24] brother my sister you will take that
[31:26] bend safely yes and in the same way
[31:29] brothers and sisters Hallelujah your
[31:31] pastor Hallelujah is actually Hallelujah
[31:35] is a Watchman over the flock amen amen
[31:38] the prophet says in that message or in
[31:40] question and answers amen
[31:43] 1954 now in order to be a correct Pastor
[31:47] or Minister you've got to watch your
[31:52] congregation amen are you with me if you
[31:56] see the enemy coming in
[31:58] then slip right over here and say here
[32:01] just a minute see now that's the wrong
[32:04] thing are you with me and see then
[32:07] you're
[32:09] watching the Bible says take heed to the
[32:12] flock to feed the flock which the Holy
[32:16] Ghost has made you overseer over
[32:20] Hallelujah now if you fail to do that
[32:23] God is going to make you answer for it
[32:26] see that's right
[32:28] amen so it's our duty brothers and
[32:31] sisters you know some people when you
[32:34] tell them hey you know what uh uh that
[32:37] brother there please do not go and
[32:39] fellowship there because it's poison the
[32:43] pastor won't tell you is poison but the
[32:46] pastor will nicely tell you yeah he
[32:48] nicely tell you you know what there's
[32:50] some contamination coming from that side
[32:53] Hallelujah I don't know how Pastor
[32:55] Adrian tells you in no uncertain terms
[32:57] or tells you in different ways but in
[32:59] anas we tell them in no uncertain terms
[33:02] Hallelujah there's poison down there if
[33:04] you eat it you're going to
[33:06] die and so brothers and sisters some
[33:09] people believe that because of
[33:15] jealousy that we don't want you to go on
[33:18] fellowship with so and so no brothers
[33:21] and sisters we're not jealous about
[33:23] nothing amen this is the prophet yes
[33:26] this is what he says
[33:28] he says Grievous wolves will come for
[33:31] the sheep and sheep cannot lead sheep
[33:34] you've got to have a shepher and the
[33:37] shepherd will tell you whether it's the
[33:39] right company to keep or it's the wrong
[33:41] company to keep Hallelujah so brothers
[33:45] and sisters
[33:46] hallelujah amen you've got to watch a
[33:49] congregation you've got to be a Watchman
[33:51] over your
[33:52] congregation hallelujah
[33:56] amen now listen to this one the third
[33:58] one pastors are suspicious
[34:03] people they will watch
[34:06] you we are suspicious people hallelujah
[34:10] the prophet says in the godhead
[34:12] explained he says and I think that
[34:14] pastors sometimes are
[34:17] suspicious of things that they
[34:20] hear and I think that they have a right
[34:22] to
[34:25] be are you with me yeah we are
[34:28] suspicious characters pastors are
[34:30] suspicious people hallelujah we don't
[34:33] take everything that you say yes
[34:36] Hallelujah we re we check behind whether
[34:39] it's the spirit of God or not we are
[34:41] suspicious of everything amen hallelujah
[34:44] and I think they have a right to be
[34:46] because if I understand the translation
[34:48] of the word pastor pastor means
[34:52] Shepherd and if a pastor would seem to
[34:55] be just a little bit suspicious
[34:58] that should not bother
[35:01] anyone
[35:03] Hallelujah you mustn't come to your p
[35:05] and say l but Pastor I told you you
[35:07] don't believe me no he doesn't the
[35:10] prophet says he
[35:16] won't Hallelujah hey Pastor you know how
[35:18] long I've been with you and still till
[35:21] this day yes till this day till
[35:24] death until the day of the Rapture will
[35:27] be
[35:29] suspicious Hallelujah everything you say
[35:31] to us will think
[35:33] twice because we are Shepherds amen
[35:38] hallelujah amen so brothers and
[35:46] sisters I the fourth one is quite
[35:50] easy he is to stay with the word amen
[35:53] amen and feed his
[35:55] flock I do not have a
[35:58] doubt whatsoever I said to you brothers
[36:01] and
[36:02] sisters Hallelujah I've got a lot of
[36:04] respect for the ministry of your pastor
[36:07] amen hallelujah and there are many
[36:09] others that have respect for the
[36:10] ministry of your pastor as well
[36:13] amen I know it's being taped but I'll
[36:16] say it some people are being threatened
[36:19] by this ministry as well oh yes and we
[36:22] don't have a problem with
[36:23] that Hallelujah we've got work to do
[36:26] that is God's work

[39:33] supposed to do amen stay with the word
[39:35] feish she himen number
[39:37] five he is
[39:40] higher and have Revelation above his
[39:45] congregation amen I touched on this
[39:48] earlier are you are you with me
[39:50] Hallelujah he is higher yes one time I
[39:54] was
[39:55] told I was told listen you can't live
[39:58] higher than your
[40:03] pastor you need to sell up your
[40:06] house until your pastor build a double
[40:12] story that was the understanding I'm
[40:14] talking in the message by the
[40:17] way Hallelujah living higher than the
[40:21] pastor
[40:24] amen and I was told in no uncertain
[40:26] terms I was
[40:28] told you will not continue living
[40:32] there you cannot have a five-bedroom
[40:34] house where the pastor has a
[40:35] three-bedroom house you cannot have a
[40:38] swimming pool while the pastor doesn't
[40:40] have a swimming
[40:42] pool you are living higher than the
[40:44] pastor
[40:49] yeah let's read the
[40:52] quotation
[40:55] Amen in the p Ian Church
[41:00] Age The Hidden manner a little something
[41:05] special what is the special not
[41:08] something to the blessings of the Holy
[41:10] Ghost oh no that's for the whole
[41:12] congregation but the hidden manner was a
[41:16] special Revelation amen amenallah
[41:22] let's not mix this thing brothers and
[41:24] sisters you know let let's not mix this
[41:28] thing of intellectualism
[41:31] yes a
[41:33] professor who is studying the Seven
[41:35] Seals who's not in the message
[41:38] yeah I'm giving you a vague example
[41:41] let's say he's doing a paper on the
[41:43] Seven Seals that we have and he takes
[41:45] the book and he then analyzes it and he
[41:49] spends years three years doing that to
[41:51] become a professor he's not in the
[41:53] message he becomes a professor because
[41:55] he knows the Seven Seals M and he
[41:58] studies it so well but there's no Spirit
[42:01] attached to it amen are all of you with
[42:04] me yes there's a difference between
[42:06] having an intellectual conception of the
[42:09] message of the hour and having the
[42:11] spirit attached Amen to the Revelation
[42:14] amen amen hallelujah so the hidden
[42:18] manner was a special Revelation cuz he
[42:22] had to teach the others amen see was a
[42:26] more was a little more knowledge of the
[42:28] scripture that he could teach others he
[42:32] is supposed to be
[42:35] amen is that right you'll never live no
[42:39] higher than your pastor
[42:42] amen amen not houses uh not cars no not
[42:49] money Hallelujah you know brothers and
[42:52] sisters if you get promoted we are happy
[42:55] amen not
[43:00] ties well that
[43:04] too are all of you with me if you catch
[43:07] the understanding the more blessed you
[43:09] are the more blessed we are and I always
[43:13] say this I can be driving a VW
[43:16] Beetle and you will buy a brand new
[43:19] Mercedes and I will come in to uh uh
[43:22] bless that vehicle and I'll be so happy
[43:25] for you amen because your blessing is my
[43:28] blessing amen hallelujah it shows growth
[43:31] it shows blessing there's no jealousy
[43:33] attached to it Hallelujah so we're not
[43:36] talking natural here yes Hallelujah you
[43:40] you'll never live no higher than your
[43:41] pastor you remember that amen cuz he is
[43:45] the
[43:47] Shepherd that feeds
[43:49] you all of you with me if he is the
[43:53] shepherd he's got to know where the Mana
[43:56] is yes to feed the Sheep amen amen you
[44:00] might know the word hallelujah but for
[44:04] that particular
[44:06] Sunday the pastor or the shepherd knows
[44:09] exactly what word is required for this
[44:12] particular church amen why because he's
[44:15] a Shepherd why because he's in prayer
[44:18] room why because he's a Watchman on the
[44:20] on the tower amen hallelujah we don't
[44:23] just come and pre preach anything that
[44:25] we feel yes Hallelujah wonder the night
[44:28] that I don't really sleep is on a
[44:30] Saturday night amen the reason being is
[44:33] we might have a thought we might have
[44:35] our notes we might have the quotation
[44:37] but we want to find the mind of God Amen
[44:41] Hallelujah because when we come here and
[44:43] when we speak to the church we need to
[44:45] have the mind of God because we might
[44:47] not have visited you we don't know your
[44:50] stories we don't know what you're going
[44:52] through but who does that it's the
[44:54] shepherd amen wonderful hallelujah amen
[44:58] and the shepherd knows exactly what word
[45:00] you require for that particular
[45:03] day hallelujah amen
[45:06] amen sometimes you don't like
[45:09] vegetables but if the menu is
[45:12] vegetables and you are hungry you just
[45:15] have to come and sit and eat
[45:16] here are you with me then I know you are
[45:20] Eagle so what he does is he puts a few
[45:22] pieces of meat yeah with the vegetables
[45:25] so that you have a balance
[45:27] [Music]
[45:28] diet amen all of you with me amen
[45:31] hallelujah sometimes you might not like
[45:33] this you don't like spinach you don't
[45:35] like brel you don't like this and that
[45:37] and the other but sometimes that's what
[45:39] on the table am Hallelujah and that's
[45:42] what you've got to eat if he's a
[45:43] Shepherd he's got to know where the Mana
[45:47] is to feed the Sheep amen hallelujah do
[45:51] you know brothers and sisters even if he
[45:53] invites somebody to come and Minister
[45:55] here he is is actually finding the mind
[45:58] of God to say I want so and so to come
[46:01] and Minister yes in other words he's
[46:03] taken you as the Sheep to that green
[46:06] pasture oh yes why because he's the
[46:08] shepherd amen and he knows what the
[46:11] church requires
[46:14] hallelujah amen and how the angel came
[46:17] to
[46:18] me the prophet says the church will
[46:22] never live higher than its Pastor
[46:25] teachers
[46:29] you seldom find that if you got a good
[46:32] sound saying gospel teacher yes you'll
[46:35] usually find that type of church and
[46:38] it's just where your pastor leads you
[46:42] the pastors that feed that you feed on
[46:46] Amen in that message why it had to be
[46:49] Shepherds not some man-made Hersman yes
[46:54] and that's a point that I'm making
[46:56] Hallelujah but a god-given
[46:58] Hersman amen who feed the sheep upon
[47:03] sheep
[47:05] hooden Hallelujah not poisonous
[47:09] peas Hallelujah are you with me amen so
[47:12] that is where the the the pastor comes
[47:14] in so this is what I'm trying to say
[47:16] brothers and sisters Hallelujah your
[47:19] pastor is a young man but nobody can
[47:22] live higher than the pastor amen
[47:25] spiritually speak yes he's a man on the
[47:29] Watchtower he knows what you need he
[47:33] knows what you need to feed on for that
[47:35] particular Sunday or that particular
[47:38] Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday or
[47:39] whichever service he's having he knows
[47:41] what you need yes he goes into prayer
[47:44] and he knows the Tabernacle you know
[47:47] brothers and sisters if you look at amas
[47:49] for example amas is a unique uh uh uh uh
[47:53] you know uh uh unique congregation and
[47:57] uh you've got to have a man that is
[48:01] placed there to be able to feed that
[48:04] particular
[48:05] congregation with manner that they
[48:08] require
[48:09] yes Hallelujah and so it's it's
[48:13] different and therefore your pastor has
[48:14] been called for you
[48:17] yes the time when Pastor kasani told me
[48:20] Pastor can you please come and be the
[48:21] pastor I'm going to East East London and
[48:24] the people are requesting you to come
[48:26] and be the pastor uh in Durban I used to
[48:29] minister once per month when he was gone
[48:31] to uh uh Eastern Cape or or or PE and uh
[48:37] so the time came when he was permanently
[48:39] leaving and he said to me Pastor can you
[48:41] come and take over the church and I said
[48:45] uh Pastor kasani unfortunately I
[48:48] cannot I won't be able
[48:51] to my plate is full in
[48:53] anas Hallelujah and I won't be able to
[48:57] Hallelujah so it's another man's
[48:59] congregation are you with me and I know
[49:01] that I want I can come and preach yeah
[49:04] but to Shepherd yeah it's a very
[49:07] difficult thing and you've got to seek
[49:09] the Lord and find out if it is uh uh if
[49:11] it is there amen he uh number six he is
[49:15] to be Fearless with the truth
[49:18] amen amen hallelujah I'm saying Fearless
[49:22] with the truth I believe and I know
[49:25] Pastor Adrian's Ministry he calls a
[49:27] spade a spade amen hallelujah he doesn't
[49:30] use fancy words like garden
[49:33] tools Spade is a spade oh is a and
[49:37] that's Pastor Adrian so in Jehovah JRA
[49:39] the prophet says what we need is
[49:41] God-fearing preachers who tells the
[49:44] truth amen amen that's right now that's
[49:48] what makes the
[49:50] separation amen you know within a pastor
[49:54] you get the different Ministries that
[49:57] sometimes he's an
[49:59] evangelist sometimes he's a
[50:01] teacher sometimes he's just
[50:04] Pastor Hallelujah so he's got all the
[50:07] Ministries under him and out of the
[50:10] pastor comes the other Ministries as
[50:12] well so if you believe you're an
[50:14] evangelist it will come out of the
[50:16] pastor's Ministry are you with me if you
[50:18] are a teacher it'll come out of the
[50:20] pastor's Ministry but we are GPS General
[50:24] Practitioners Hallelujah then there are
[50:26] other people who become Specialists
[50:29] evangelist is a specialist in this field
[50:32] and I I want to say this I will never
[50:33] touch an evangelist I can evangelize
[50:36] Hallelujah as a GP as a general
[50:39] practitioner but the Evangelist is an
[50:42] evangelist Hallelujah a teacher is a
[50:45] teacher I can teach but I'll never
[50:47] outshine a teacher and that is why the
[50:50] five fingers are different the fivefold
[50:53] ministry is different and please as a
[50:55] congregation never ever compare one
[50:58] Ministry with the other never ever say
[51:01] brother so and so teaches so well it
[51:04] teachers better than Pastor Adrian no no
[51:06] no Pastor Adrian is a pastor you can't
[51:09] compare a teacher with a pastor amen you
[51:12] can't compare an evangelist with a
[51:14] pastor you can't
[51:15] compare and what you need to do brothers
[51:18] and sisters when an evangelist comes
[51:19] behind the pulpit you say amen and you
[51:22] support that evangelist 100% but never
[51:25] ever compare that Ministry with another
[51:27] brother's Ministry it is wrong because
[51:30] we are all different five fingers are
[51:32] different never
[51:33] compare each brother is unique in their
[51:36] Ministry and if you can understand that
[51:39] brothers and sisters there will never be
[51:41] a
[51:42] breakaway because we understand each
[51:45] each Ministry we appreciate each
[51:47] Ministry and every Ministry that comes
[51:49] here we will salute those
[51:51] Ministries Hallelujah it says if I was
[51:54] choosing a pastor
[51:57] and I was on the board and I had to
[51:59] select a pastor and he was one of those
[52:02] wishy-washy kind of cified guys like
[52:05] that I sure wouldn't vote him into my
[52:10] church we need pastors with a backbone
[52:12] yes amen
[52:16] hallelujah amen he says here I'd vot him
[52:20] out and get a man that did believe God's
[52:24] word and took God's word and preached it
[52:27] and stood on
[52:29] it I want a son of Abraham up there a
[52:33] Son of God Amen that's what we need
[52:36] Hallelujah we don't need wishy-washy
[52:39] cified guys you know sometimes you'll
[52:41] say you know we walk out of the church
[52:44] when the pastor is preaching especially
[52:46] these kinds of preaching Hallelujah say
[52:49] it the way it is yeah Hallelujah and
[52:52] when you walk out be careful when you
[52:54] say hey you know what Pastor was
[52:56] throwing
[52:58] stones Pastor got no time to come and
[53:01] hear your stories amen are you with me
[53:05] you discuss with so and so and that so
[53:07] and so discuss with so and so don't put
[53:09] pastor in between them yes Hallelujah
[53:13] the pastor you know you know brothers
[53:15] and
[53:16] sisters
[53:17] someone a few weeks or months ago
[53:21] someone said hey you know you heard what
[53:22] the pastor was saying hey the pastor was
[53:25] only talking about me
[53:26] and only preaching about me and so on
[53:29] and so
[53:31] forth and you know brothers and sisters
[53:33] I asked the one question I said do you
[53:36] think I've got time the whole Saturday
[53:39] night to think about
[53:42] you do you think I must go and prepare
[53:46] six seven pages of notes based on the
[53:49] thinking that there's only one person
[53:51] there must think
[53:54] about I'm wasting my
[53:57] time we don't do
[53:59] that Hallelujah now this is where the
[54:02] difference is instead of saying throwing
[54:06] stones when the prayer altar comes and
[54:10] when the pastor says those of you want
[54:12] to raise your hands or those of you who
[54:14] want to come to the
[54:16] altar that word of throwing stones in
[54:19] actual fact means you
[54:23] convicted and your conviction you're
[54:25] passing the back onto the pastor to say
[54:27] Pastor heard that story
[54:30] somewhere from today stop it yeah are
[54:34] you with me there's no throwing of
[54:36] stones we are in prayer yes and if the
[54:38] Lord speaks to us as I read that other
[54:41] quotation he says the house of God is
[54:43] the house of judgment and God will come
[54:46] but through who amen through the
[54:48] ministry through the pastor amen and
[54:51] that's God's servant speaking to the
[54:53] church so in future when you want to say
[54:56] Stone throwing just do me a favor you
[55:00] won't find this in the Oxford dictionary
[55:01] but the synonym for stone throwing in
[55:04] the gospel is
[55:08] conviction are you with me Hallelujah
[55:11] the professors will kill me for this but
[55:13] it's called conviction yeah it's not
[55:15] Stone throwing it's called conviction
[55:17] meaning I am
[55:20] guilty Hallelujah I am
[55:23] charged Hallelujah let me just raise my
[55:25] hands and pay the F amen and walk out of
[55:28] your happy somebody but if you walk out
[55:32] bitter saying that there was Stone
[55:34] throwing I knew about my story I saw his
[55:37] car in that house and those people know
[55:39] my
[55:42] story Hallelujah he went there for
[55:44] something else to those people's house
[55:47] in fact he just parked his car there and
[55:48] went to the neighbor's house and you
[55:51] think you went to hear your story
[55:53] Hallelujah so brothers and sisters the
[55:56] prophet says get a man that did believe
[55:59] God's word and took God's word and
[56:01] preached it and stood on it I want a son
[56:04] of Abraham there a Son of God in that
[56:07] message Faith
[56:08] 1956 the prophet says you know when you
[56:11] go to choose your pastor usually the
[56:13] people choosing their Pastor they want
[56:15] to choose a good
[56:18] mixer oh we want a fellow that's
[56:22] sociable and that can do this and do
[56:24] that you know sometimes we pastors we
[56:26] are we we are accused of being stubborn
[56:32] people no don't don't don't accuse us of
[56:35] that we are who we
[56:38] are we're not stubborn sometimes we just
[56:41] you know our minds and our thoughts and
[56:43] our Spirits just gets caught up with
[56:44] something else hallah we got nothing
[56:47] against you Hallelujah we want a a
[56:51] fellow that's sociable that can do this
[56:52] and do that God don't call for that kind
[56:56] of
[56:57] man God calls for
[57:00] separators Hallelujah a lot of times
[57:03] people choosing their Pastor little
[57:05] cified boys that's ashamed to say what
[57:08] truth is and a lot of pastors are afraid
[57:12] to tell people where they are standing
[57:14] on account of their meal ticket yes
[57:18] amen
[57:19] hallelujah brothers and sisters
[57:22] Hallelujah we do not believe in that
[57:24] meal ticket yes
[57:26] Hallelujah I I salute Pastor Adrian One
[57:30] Time One Pastor came to me and he said
[57:31] to me Pastor CLI you got such a good
[57:33] Ministry you need to become a full-time
[57:36] Pastor you need to leave work and become
[57:39] a full-time pastor and that was another
[57:42] pastor and I said to him uh Pastor you
[57:44] know what who told you I'm not
[57:47] full-time in fact you might be
[57:51] parttime the reason being
[57:54] is when they wake up in the morning
[57:57] everybody's gone to work there's nothing
[57:59] to
[58:00] do are all of you with me take the
[58:03] fishing rod full-time past enough take

[58:11] people come from work you visit homes
[58:13] and whatever it is unless there's
[58:15] emergencies but brothers and sisters
[58:17] this is what I said to the pastor I said
[58:19] I am full time am when I wake up in the
[58:22] morning and I go and sit in my office I
[58:25] meet hundreds of people amen and I
[58:28] minister to hundreds of souls I have an
[58:32] opportunity that you do not have your
[58:34] opportunity is when you wake up you see
[58:36] the four walls of your house the
[58:39] opportunity that I have is I'm out of
[58:41] the house and I'm meeting people and I
[58:44] am counseling people amen hallelujah so
[58:47] much so that one day I'm just giving you
[58:49] one example of the power of being a
[58:52] full-time PR preacher while walking I'm
[58:54] talking mil de brother yeah Hallelujah a
[58:57] meal ticket we don't worry about Meal
[58:59] Ticket Pastor Adrian is working he got
[59:00] his money Hallelujah and therefore we
[59:03] will preach what we are supposed to
[59:04] preach whether you're a manager of
[59:07] whoever wherever it is we still preach
[59:09] the word of God we are not man Pleasers
[59:12] amen we don't please anybody oh yes you
[59:15] accept the word brothers and sisters
[59:17] this is spiritual matters amen
[59:19] hallelujah and so uh uh one
[59:22] day
[59:25] Hallelujah
[59:27] now let's leave that
[59:29] story so brothers and sisters what I'm
[59:32] what I'm saying to you is this
[59:34] Hallelujah we are working and therefore
[59:37] we won't preach to compromise and offend
[59:40] a brother or or a sister no we won't we
[59:43] just preach it the way it is you like it
[59:46] or you don't like it and if you don't
[59:48] like it come to the altar we pray for
[59:49] you and you'll become a better person
[59:52] spiritually Hallelujah so pastors are
[59:54] afraid to tell people where they are
[59:57] standing on account of their meal
[1:00:00] tickets
[1:00:03] Hallelujah in the in the message of
[1:00:05] deceived Church by the world we want a
[1:00:07] bunch of men of God who don't compromise
[1:00:09] on the
[1:00:10] word but preach the truth and stand on
[1:00:14] the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:18] Spirit
[1:00:23] hallelujah
[1:00:24] amen and
[1:00:26] seven he is to be a God sent over his
[1:00:31] community Hallelujah now if you if you
[1:00:35] look at this brothers and sisters there
[1:00:38] are certain times when the community
[1:00:39] comes and says pastor we don't have a
[1:00:42] pastor we need to bury this
[1:00:44] somebody and that somebody that they
[1:00:46] want to bury we don't even know we
[1:00:48] haven't even seen them but the prophet
[1:00:51] tells me that if I'm a pastor I'm a
[1:00:53] pastor to the
[1:00:54] community anybody can just just put that
[1:00:56] body to the ground but it is an
[1:00:58] opportunity for me to speak to those
[1:01:00] that are alive and I'll never miss that
[1:01:02] opportunity amen but then there are some
[1:01:05] people in the message will say hey but
[1:01:07] Pastor you know what you're a message
[1:01:09] believer you're a message Pastor how did
[1:01:11] you do this funeral how did you do that
[1:01:13] how did you do that brothers and sisters
[1:01:15] the motive that I have is different from
[1:01:18] you I am the pastor I'm looking for that
[1:01:20] Soul amen amen God is giving me an
[1:01:22] opportunity to go and bury somebody and
[1:01:25] look at their face while they dead for
[1:01:26] the first time I never saw them when
[1:01:29] they were alive Hallelujah I did many of
[1:01:31] those funerals and many people came to
[1:01:34] the Lord based on that amen hallelujah
[1:01:37] why for me it's not a funeral service
[1:01:40] it's an open a service Hallelujah the
[1:01:43] prophet says what doest thou here he
[1:01:44] says oh there's are lots of times they
[1:01:47] don't want to claim it but a God sent
[1:01:51] man to a community is a pastor of the
[1:01:55] entire Community amen are all of you
[1:01:58] with me amen so Pastor Adrien is a is a
[1:02:01] pastor of
[1:02:03] Phoenix he's a pastor of the community
[1:02:06] he's not only a pastor to those that are
[1:02:08] in the four walls of this building amen
[1:02:11] whether he Baptist Presbyterian or who
[1:02:13] it is God anoints his man not your man
[1:02:18] it's his man amen and he will not
[1:02:21] compromise and the people sometimes
[1:02:25] hates him
[1:02:30] that is a
[1:02:31] fact people outside hate us they will
[1:02:35] talk ill about us they'll call us Cults
[1:02:38] yeah false
[1:02:39] preachers and everything else but that
[1:02:42] doesn't change the fact that my Prophet
[1:02:44] told me that we are pastors to that same
[1:02:47] Community do you know that Elijah was a
[1:02:50] pastor to
[1:02:51] Jezebel amen hallelujah and yet he ran
[1:02:54] away from his own congregation
[1:02:57] remember are all of you with me yes
[1:03:00] Hallelujah that's the fact amen and the
[1:03:03] people sometimes hates him because he
[1:03:06] stands for the
[1:03:07] truth but yet he's a God's Pastor for
[1:03:12] the hour amen
[1:03:15] amen verse uh not verse number
[1:03:19] eight he's a gift from
[1:03:22] God hallelujah if ever you had a gift
[1:03:26] from God is your
[1:03:28] pastor hallelujah what it takes to
[1:03:31] overcome all unbelief so each of you
[1:03:34] people who has a Godly Pastor has a gift
[1:03:39] from God oh thank you Lord in your
[1:03:42] church
[1:03:43] amen can we give the Lord a round of
[1:03:46] applause
[1:03:47] amen God has actually given you a
[1:03:51] gift and the gift that God has given you
[1:03:53] is your pastor amen he is to pray for
[1:03:57] the sick and cast out devils in both
[1:04:01] Body and Soul so every time he comes and
[1:04:05] preach he does a soul cleansing and
[1:04:07] demons are casted out through the
[1:04:09] preaching Hallelujah the body those of
[1:04:12] you who read demonology will know
[1:04:14] Hallelujah sickness and all other things
[1:04:17] also in the message Kon it says listen
[1:04:21] if you are sick your Godly
[1:04:24] Pastor he his holy Sanctified hands upon
[1:04:28] you you know you call him to pray for
[1:04:31] for
[1:04:32] you all of you
[1:04:34] with you know some pastors are mechanics
[1:04:37] they work with gree all day are you with
[1:04:40] me at the end of the day they wash their
[1:04:42] hands with DEA and that same hand is
[1:04:46] Anointed by God amen amen according to
[1:04:50] scripture to lay hands on the sick and
[1:04:53] they shall recover amen that's God's
[1:04:56] word are all of you with me amen it says
[1:05:00] believe me that I am able to do this in
[1:05:03] 1950 says you've got a Tormentor in your
[1:05:08] soul see your
[1:05:12] pastor you've got a t t t torment in
[1:05:16] your body that's what I'm here for amen
[1:05:21] so whether your body is
[1:05:23] tormented hallelujah or whether your
[1:05:25] soul is
[1:05:27] tormented some of you you know when you
[1:05:29] have a soul torment you want to doubt
[1:05:32] the message you want to doubt the word
[1:05:35] you want to doubt God your soul you want
[1:05:38] to doubt your standing in the message
[1:05:41] you want to doubt predestination in your
[1:05:44] life that is where you come to the
[1:05:46] pastor cuz those things are tormenting
[1:05:48] you and the pastor's authority over the
[1:05:51] Tormentor yes amen even your bodies
[1:05:55] Hallelujah when you talk of sickness and
[1:05:57] you talk of all of those things number
[1:06:00] nine he is to cry out against
[1:06:04] worldliness and disorder in the body
[1:06:08] that's the body of Christ are you with
[1:06:10] me he is to cry out against worldliness
[1:06:14] so sometimes when Pastor Adrian comes
[1:06:16] here and he does evangelism and you
[1:06:18] think it's very hard no no no you
[1:06:22] sisters you do it in your own
[1:06:24] house

[1:06:54] time Hallelujah so brothers and sisters
[1:06:57] sometimes in the church when the pastor
[1:07:01] preaches hallelujah it's spring cleaning
[1:07:04] time
[1:07:05] amen hallelujah sometimes we are so
[1:07:08] common we walk into our rooms we sleep
[1:07:11] we dress the bed and so on and we walk
[1:07:13] out not realizing in some corner of the
[1:07:16] house the spider spider is making webs
[1:07:19] there and every day because of
[1:07:21] commonness you didn't realize but one
[1:07:24] day when the pastor comes and he says
[1:07:27] evangelism today all the cob webs come
[1:07:31] out am amen hallelujah so God sets up
[1:07:35] his Tower in the Forman letter r the
[1:07:37] prophet says God sets up his Tower he
[1:07:40] puts somebody
[1:07:41] there your pastor will scream out
[1:07:44] against
[1:07:45] it amen are you with me Hallelujah have
[1:07:50] not I sent thee sometimes I preach
[1:07:52] pretty
[1:07:54] rough because I see that somebody is
[1:07:56] getting out of
[1:07:59] line remember what the prophet says in
[1:08:01] the preview of the Bride he said get
[1:08:03] back online amen yes and we are
[1:08:06] reiterating what the prophet said in our
[1:08:10] messages get back
[1:08:12] online Hallelujah let me tell you what's
[1:08:15] happening in these days brothers and
[1:08:17] sisters our education system is corrupt
[1:08:20] yes I am from education and I'll tell
[1:08:22] you straight Hallelujah the things that
[1:08:25] they teach becomes
[1:08:28] normality but in the message it's not
[1:08:32] normal Hallelujah and we've got to clean
[1:08:34] out the church we've got to keep you
[1:08:36] intact amen hallelujah there's all kinds
[1:08:39] of bills coming up Bella Bill and all
[1:08:41] kinds of bills that are coming up and
[1:08:44] propagating things that are against the
[1:08:46] word of God yes and that is where your
[1:08:49] pastor comes in but when modernism comes
[1:08:52] in and when Hollywood steps into the
[1:08:54] church
[1:08:56] we then do things because of commonness
[1:08:58] and we think it is right but it is not
[1:09:02] right
[1:09:04] Hallelujah sometimes I preach pretty
[1:09:06] rough because I see that somebody's
[1:09:09] getting out of line you see we are
[1:09:11] supposed to do that a real daddy will
[1:09:15] amen why he'd shake you and say here get
[1:09:19] back here in line and if he is a real
[1:09:22] true father yes so some sometimes
[1:09:25] sometimes your pastor has to weigh you
[1:09:27] down on
[1:09:29] something just love him that much more
[1:09:33] yes because he's a real father to you
[1:09:37] amen are you with me amen when I take
[1:09:41] the belt out for my children it's not
[1:09:44] because I hate them it's not because I
[1:09:46] want to chase them out of the house it's
[1:09:49] because I have discovered that something
[1:09:51] went wrong in their lives and I want to
[1:09:54] put them back on track amen and the
[1:09:56] whole idea is to put them back on track
[1:09:58] teach them a lesson and this is what the
[1:10:01] prophet is saying just love him that
[1:10:02] much more because he's a real father to
[1:10:06] you Hallelujah you see trying to keep
[1:10:09] you lined up because he's watching over
[1:10:12] your
[1:10:13] soul which is the Holy Ghost he's made
[1:10:16] him the overseer of the church and you
[1:10:18] must always watch that so the pastor is
[1:10:22] the overseer of the church and when he
[1:10:24] knows things are not going according to
[1:10:26] the to the word he will come with an
[1:10:28] Evangelistic message do the clean up and
[1:10:31] clean out the church amen amen
[1:10:37] hallelujah the marriage of the Lamb a
[1:10:40] pastor will let his church get by with
[1:10:42] such things without blasting the tar
[1:10:46] out tar out of it from the pulpit he is
[1:10:50] a
[1:10:51] what we need is men the gospel
[1:10:55] not with rubber
[1:10:57] gloves but with the power and
[1:11:00] demonstration of the Holy Ghost with the
[1:11:03] word
[1:11:04] amen hallelujah in the position of a
[1:11:07] believer in Christ the prophet says
[1:11:10] pray God to send you some sensible sound
[1:11:14] gospel
[1:11:15] preacher that will stand in the way and
[1:11:19] give you a little bit of
[1:11:22] spanking when you need it and love you
[1:11:26] when you need it amen isn't that's a
[1:11:28] father's nature that's also a shepherd's
[1:11:31] nature that's also a pastor's nature
[1:11:33] Hallelujah we are fatherly figure amen
[1:11:37] hallelujah yet the prophet says don't
[1:11:39] call any man on Earth father it was
[1:11:41] referring to the Catholic priests we
[1:11:44] call them Father father father
[1:11:46] Hallelujah but we have the attribute of
[1:11:48] father nature when we are Shepherds amen
[1:11:52] and he says here keep you lined up with
[1:11:54] the scripture and with this spirit
[1:11:56] amen oh sorry he says a little bit of
[1:11:59] spanking when you need it and love you
[1:12:01] when you need it
[1:12:04] amen when I was in the school system
[1:12:09] right um I was the head of the school
[1:12:13] and I had two deputy
[1:12:15] principls and I had to appoint the two
[1:12:17] Deputy principal but what I used to
[1:12:20] do and I teach people to do it now when
[1:12:23] I appoint I always appointed one cool
[1:12:27] calm and collected
[1:12:29] somebody as a
[1:12:31] deputy the other person I will employ a
[1:12:35] very hote
[1:12:36] headed short tempered
[1:12:41] somebody are you with me amen now those
[1:12:45] two Deputy principles are acting on my
[1:12:49] behalf so what happens is let's say a
[1:12:52] phone call comes to one of of the
[1:12:55] teachers in the staff room and the phone
[1:12:57] call is saying uh you know your mother
[1:13:00] just passed
[1:13:02] away so what I would do is I will send
[1:13:04] one of the two Deputy principles who do
[1:13:07] you think I'll
[1:13:08] send I won't send the hote headed guy
[1:13:12] the hot-headed person will come there
[1:13:13] and say what you crying for you must go
[1:13:15] to
[1:13:17] class but what I would do is I would
[1:13:20] send that person who cool come and
[1:13:22] collect it and I say there's someone
[1:13:23] crying on the in in the staff room I
[1:13:26] believe they just lost their mother
[1:13:27] please go and sort it out they will go
[1:13:30] there with some uh tissues and servs or
[1:13:34] whatever it is and and and go in Comfort
[1:13:37] are you with me amen then you'll get
[1:13:39] another
[1:13:41] situation there's a class making
[1:13:43] noise the teacher is sitting in the
[1:13:45] staff room and never go to class then
[1:13:48] I'll send this hooted
[1:13:50] character I say please do me a favor
[1:13:52] from my window I can see that class is
[1:13:54] not not sorted out there's noise in the
[1:13:56] class there's no teacher there the
[1:13:58] teacher is somewhere else please go and
[1:13:59] sort it out while sitting in the staff
[1:14:02] room I can y
[1:14:04] him he makes no bones about it he goes
[1:14:08] into the staff room in a very UNC way
[1:14:12] imagine he's a deputy he's short
[1:14:14] tempered he just goes B so he goes in
[1:14:17] there and he says can you do me a favor
[1:14:19] according to the time table you're
[1:14:21] supposed to be in class you are shocking
[1:14:23] just get to class and all the other
[1:14:25] staff members are watching that now
[1:14:28] watch your pastor pastors don't have
[1:14:31] deputies we have deacons but we don't
[1:14:34] have deputies so sometimes the pastor
[1:14:36] will come there and when you are crying
[1:14:38] and by the way we don't carry tissues
[1:14:40] for you okay and our shoulders might be
[1:14:43] broad but it's not for your
[1:14:45] yet are all of you with me that's
[1:14:50] what Hallelujah that is why when we deal
[1:14:53] with cases brothers and sisters we want
[1:14:55] to protect our
[1:14:56] Ministries when we protect our
[1:14:58] Ministries we can take our wives we take
[1:15:00] a deacon or someone if we want to
[1:15:02] counsel
[1:15:04] assistant if it's a sensitive matter
[1:15:06] we'll take someone that we trust amen
[1:15:09] but never will we go alone as a pastor
[1:15:13] but one Pastor told me no no no no me I
[1:15:15] can sit with these young girls I can sit
[1:15:17] with the all the sisters alone and uh
[1:15:19] because I got the Holy
[1:15:22] Ghost Holy Ghost where Holy Ghost in
[1:15:24] This flesh still in this flesh are you
[1:15:28] with me never we don't allow that we
[1:15:30] don't have broad shoulders for others to
[1:15:32] cry
[1:15:33] on Hallelujah not that we hard brothers
[1:15:36] and sisters not that we don't have a
[1:15:39] heart but we do in our own way so please
[1:15:43] understand us as
[1:15:44] pastors
[1:15:48] amen so sometimes
[1:15:53] Hallelujah
[1:16:00] okay it says here pray to God to send
[1:16:02] you some sensible sound preacher that
[1:16:04] will stand in the way and give you a
[1:16:06] little bit of spanking when you need it
[1:16:08] and love you when you need it and keep
[1:16:10] you lined up with the scripture and with
[1:16:11] the spirit he's a Shepherd watching your
[1:16:14] soul If he if you got that Pastor flee
[1:16:18] to God and pray for him all the
[1:16:22] time listen to him you know brother and
[1:16:24] sister s is giving you two things here
[1:16:26] number one pray for him but don't pray
[1:16:28] for him when you whenever you feel like
[1:16:30] do you know on your prayer list every
[1:16:32] day one of the people that must be on
[1:16:35] your prayer list is the pastor the
[1:16:38] pastor's wife and the pastor's family
[1:16:41] amen you need to pray for them yes amen
[1:16:44] keep that in your list every day amen
[1:16:47] I'll tell you what the devil wants to
[1:16:48] destroy the church amen in order to
[1:16:51] destroy the church he'll try to destroy
[1:16:52] the headship of the church and that is
[1:16:55] why as a congregation we must pray for
[1:16:58] the pastor amen hallelujah don't worry
[1:17:01] I'm about to
[1:17:02] close the next thing is he is to be a
[1:17:06] humble
[1:17:07] man now I'm I'm not contradicting myself
[1:17:11] I'll show you through the next quotation
[1:17:12] right he's supposed to be a humble
[1:17:16] man you know brothers and
[1:17:18] sisters sometimes when we roll up our
[1:17:20] sleeves not literally when we roll up
[1:17:23] our sleeves people then question whether
[1:17:26] we really a
[1:17:28] pastor are you with me hey he calls
[1:17:31] himself a pastor what kind pastor this
[1:17:34] are you with me but watch this the
[1:17:37] quotation says in church order the
[1:17:40] pastor must be a man that has got a very
[1:17:43] humble way about him are you with me but
[1:17:47] it doesn't say full stop it says comma
[1:17:50] and in that comma it says but not too
[1:17:53] humble
[1:17:56] amen are you with me Hallelujah but what
[1:18:01] he could be like the Lord Jesus
[1:18:03] Christ amen when he seen wrong going on
[1:18:08] in the church he planted
[1:18:12] ropes are you with me yes Jesus gone
[1:18:19] violent and ran them out of the church
[1:18:21] so you don't come with this trick of
[1:18:23] saying hey but Pastor you call yourself
[1:18:25] a pastor you're doing like this if you
[1:18:28] are doing
[1:18:29] wrong and the pastor is whooping you
[1:18:32] amen he's platting ropes and he's
[1:18:34] literally whooping you
[1:18:37] too Hallelujah he is like Jesus
[1:18:41] Christ we can't stand for wrong in the
[1:18:44] church amen and when he sees wrong going
[1:18:47] on the church he plattered ropes and ran
[1:18:50] them out of the church and now the
[1:18:52] Church of God the Church of God is the
[1:18:55] highest of
[1:18:56] judgment and the pastor is the highest
[1:19:00] order in the church
[1:19:03] amen so it's a pastor's
[1:19:05] responsibility amen
[1:19:09] hallelujah I I you know we mustn't you
[1:19:13] know use that quotation in the wrong way
[1:19:16] we are a very short tempered pastor and
[1:19:18] get angry for everything then there's
[1:19:20] something wrong are you with me yes
[1:19:23] Hallelujah you get some pastors you
[1:19:25] their toe they your head are
[1:19:28] you with me immediately they don't wait
[1:19:31] but we've got to be humble but not too
[1:19:34] humble amen there comes a moment when
[1:19:37] people must not take advantage over the
[1:19:39] past amen and when that happens the
[1:19:42] pastor is able to stand based on the
[1:19:45] word of God hallelujah so the pastor is
[1:19:49] here hallelujah the highest of judgment
[1:19:53] amen the Church of God is the highest of
[1:19:55] judgment and the pastor is the highest
[1:19:58] order in the church the pastor I I hope
[1:20:01] you know I should have put all that in
[1:20:03] uh in capital letters the pastor is the
[1:20:07] highest order in the
[1:20:11] church
[1:20:14] 11 he is your
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:17] teacher he's your spiritual
[1:20:20] husband he is your
[1:20:22] counselor and he is your source of
[1:20:26] blessings the prophet says in y he says
[1:20:31] but listen to your
[1:20:34] pastor you know sometimes you
[1:20:37] know sometimes we make our decisions
[1:20:40] without
[1:20:42] consulting we don't consult the pastor
[1:20:44] we don't consult anybody and we in fact
[1:20:47] you consult other people yeah uh you
[1:20:50] consult
[1:20:51] agents but not the pastor yeah
[1:20:55] and when things go wrong you then want
[1:20:58] to blame the pastor for a decision that
[1:21:01] he wasn't part of
[1:21:03] initially Hallelujah it says listen to
[1:21:06] your
[1:21:07] pastor a good good God sent
[1:21:11] man a teacher that will send and tell
[1:21:15] you just exactly what to
[1:21:17] do so I'm saying some people you packed
[1:21:21] your bag you paid for the accommodation
[1:21:25] packed your bag you even put it in your
[1:21:29] boot and then you drive to the pastor's
[1:21:31] house pastor we thinking of going on
[1:21:34] holiday what you
[1:21:37] think what you want him to
[1:21:40] think are you with
[1:21:43] me and if the pastor says you know what
[1:21:46] according to the pastor he believes now
[1:21:48] or he says hey you know what uh you
[1:21:51] shouldn't be going this week you should
[1:21:53] be going the following
[1:21:56] and people get
[1:21:58] angry with the pastor's decision you
[1:22:02] know why because they already made up
[1:22:04] their mind and therefore the Lord allows
[1:22:07] a perfect will and a permissive world
[1:22:11] there's dangers with the permissive
[1:22:13] world he allows you to go the pastor is
[1:22:16] there and the pastor already knew that
[1:22:20] you already booked your ticket somehow
[1:22:21] or the other you're just coming as an
[1:22:24] ordinance to say Pastor can you give us
[1:22:26] can you can you tell us whether we
[1:22:27] should go or shouldn't go and the Pastor
[1:22:30] said no go the reason why the pastor
[1:22:32] says that is he knows you booked he
[1:22:35] knows you packed up and he knows in one
[1:22:37] hour's time you're ready to leave so he
[1:22:40] allows you to leave then when things go
[1:22:42] wrong don't come back to your pastor
[1:22:44] because you didn't consult when before
[1:22:46] buying the ticket you didn't
[1:22:49] consult but listen to your pastor a good
[1:22:52] god-sent man a teacher that will send
[1:22:54] you and tell you exactly what to do
[1:22:56] because himself is Anointed with the
[1:22:58] Holy Ghost and watch him he will stay
[1:23:02] right smack with the
[1:23:04] word how can I overcome your pastor is
[1:23:08] your
[1:23:09] husband spiritually speaking amen you
[1:23:14] see
[1:23:16] hallelujah amen your pastor is your
[1:23:18] husband man spiritually speaking if you
[1:23:22] ever feel to do something
[1:23:25] or a revelation or something comes to
[1:23:27] you strangely something warningly or
[1:23:30] something be
[1:23:32] careful Satan is as Sly and slick as he
[1:23:36] can
[1:23:37] be see put it with the word of God and
[1:23:42] consult your
[1:23:45] pastor many people make decisions I'm
[1:23:47] talking about huge decisions and I
[1:23:50] always say to our church I said listen
[1:23:53] you if you deciding to buy bread
[1:23:55] tomorrow don't come to the pastor say
[1:23:57] Pastor I can I go and buy bread are you
[1:24:00] with me yes that's a decision you need
[1:24:02] on a daily
[1:24:03] basis but if you're going to open a
[1:24:06] business or if you're going to invest
[1:24:08] somewhere or you going to do something
[1:24:12] not that you know hey you know who's he
[1:24:14] you know why do I have to tell him he's
[1:24:17] a God sent man he needs to pray for you
[1:24:21] he needs to tell you the direction that
[1:24:22] you're going is right or wrong
[1:24:25] so it's important for you to consult
[1:24:27] your pastor on important decisions that
[1:24:29] you that you're doing not on buying
[1:24:31] bread or going to the shop for doing
[1:24:33] your groceries and so on those things
