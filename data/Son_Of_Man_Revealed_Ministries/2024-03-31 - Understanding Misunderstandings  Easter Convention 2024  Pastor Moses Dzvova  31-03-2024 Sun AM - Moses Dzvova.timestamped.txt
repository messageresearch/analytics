[1:05:11] 21 God bless you we always say Pastor
[1:05:14] Nami our Elder may God bless him and
[1:05:18] other Elders also so John chter 21 just
[1:05:23] want to go quickly while we are standing
[1:05:26] John 21 verse let's start from want to
[1:05:30] see let's start from verse 21 Peter
[1:05:33] seeing him said to Jesus Lord and what
[1:05:38] shall this man
[1:05:40] do Jesus said unto him if I will that he
[1:05:45] T till I come what is that to thee
[1:05:50] follow thou me you know there are people
[1:05:53] are always wanting to interfere with
[1:05:55] people
[1:05:56] issues that's why Jesus says what is
[1:05:58] that to you yes follow
[1:06:01] me
[1:06:03] Hallelujah but that's what my message
[1:06:05] verse 23 then went this same abroad
[1:06:10] among the Brethren that that disciple
[1:06:13] should not die yet Jesus said not unto
[1:06:18] him he shall not die do you see how many
[1:06:22] things have gone out in the message
[1:06:25] because of
[1:06:27] misunderstanding Jesus did not say that
[1:06:31] disciple was not going to die but he
[1:06:34] just said what is that to you if I will
[1:06:37] Notre till I come what is that to you so
[1:06:41] you see that is a very bad thing to
[1:06:46] misunderstand preached the message that
[1:06:49] God had been
[1:06:51] misunderstood and the prophet says even
[1:06:53] the messenger of the AG
[1:06:56] is going to be misunderstood even with
[1:06:58] real true
[1:07:00] ministers you know misunderstanding is a
[1:07:04] bad thing how many can say Amen there is
[1:07:07] a lot of sayings in the message but
[1:07:12] based on
[1:07:14] misunderstanding does churches movements
[1:07:18] you know they are many because of
[1:07:22] misunderstanding so this morning I just
[1:07:25] want to give a small
[1:07:27] title understanding
[1:07:30] misunderstandings how many say Amen we
[1:07:34] want to understand that
[1:07:38] misunderstanding can you say amen amen
[1:07:41] can you say hallelujah
[1:07:43] hallelujah
[1:07:45] understanding the
[1:07:47] misunderstanding do you love
[1:07:51] him amen so let's finish it says
[1:07:57] if I will that he T till I come what is
[1:08:02] that to
[1:08:04] the this is H the disciple which John
[1:08:10] which testified of these things and
[1:08:12] wrote these things and we knew that his
[1:08:14] testimonies is true may God His
[1:08:17] blessings to the reading of the word
[1:08:20] hallelujah do you love him so we just
[1:08:23] want to like I always say I just want to
[1:08:26] go straight to the point Hallelujah
[1:08:29] understanding misunderstandings am
[1:08:32] praise be to God do you love him you
[1:08:35] know when you read the Bible sometimes
[1:08:38] you know you find where the Bible says
[1:08:40] Jesus you find where the Bible says

[1:08:53] yes life must be upon line precept upon
[1:08:58] pre and my brother my sister I realize
[1:09:02] that the evidence that you have received
[1:09:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a clear
[1:09:10] understanding of the message of your day
[1:09:13] how many believe that a clear
[1:09:16] understanding of the message of the hour
[1:09:19] is the evidence of receiving the Holy
[1:09:21] Ghost how many say Amen am why am I
[1:09:24] saying this
[1:09:26] when he the Holy Ghost is come he will
[1:09:29] reveal these things that I told told you

[1:09:36] tongues it does not only hear it does
[1:09:39] not only serve but the Holy Spirit also
[1:09:43] reveals the word the holy spirit is a

[1:10:38] Christ the son of the Living God and you
[1:10:42] know I realize something when you know
[1:10:46] who he is he will reveal to you who you

[1:11:29] said who are you are you the one or
[1:11:33] shall we ask for another they were
[1:11:35] asking for his

[1:11:39] identification are we together so he
[1:11:42] said I am the voice of one cry in the
[1:11:47] wilderness are we together my brother so

[1:19:30] heart of the children to the fathers two
[1:19:34] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:19:38] seven thunders in Revelation
[1:19:42] 10 which are the
[1:19:45] revelations contained in the seven SE so
[1:19:51] what are the seven they are the
[1:19:53] revelations
[1:19:55] contained in the seven
[1:19:59] seal preaching the seal the revelation
[1:20:02] of the Seven Seals he was revealing the

[1:20:21] contained in the Seven Seals it will be
[1:20:25] this divinely revealed mystery truth
[1:20:29] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:20:32] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:20:35] exactly
[1:20:37] so yesterday we said we are going back
[1:20:40] to e that's where the fall took place
[1:20:45] restoration is bringing back to the
[1:20:47] former
[1:20:49] state so the fall did not take place in
[1:20:53] Pentecost it did not take place in the
[1:20:57] days of Jesus the did not take place in
[1:21:01] Street the fall took place in
[1:21:05] Ed so we want to see what Eden was what
[1:21:09] was happening in Eden before the fallam
[1:21:13] was not praying in Eden but he was
[1:21:18] worshiping there is a difference between
[1:21:21] praying and worshiping when you are
[1:21:24] praying you are in a fallen state are we
[1:21:27] together you are begging God you are
[1:21:30] asking do this for me but when you are
[1:21:34] worshiping you are
[1:21:37] redeemed if you see a church of
[1:21:40] worshipers it's a church that is
[1:21:45] redeemed was open when John Hallelujah
[1:21:50] the L broke the SE the
[1:21:53] 24 and bound down and
[1:21:57] worship we are not called to pray but to
[1:22:03] worship father
[1:22:05] S as worship Him in truth
[1:22:11] and prayer came after the fall fasting
[1:22:15] came after the fall but from the
[1:22:18] beginning it was
[1:22:20] [Applause]
[1:22:21] s did not need to pray
[1:22:25] he was a God he was an am God if he
[1:22:30] wanted the lion to come he will speak
[1:22:32] the word will come if he wanted to
[1:22:36] divert the C of the river he would just
[1:22:39] say you go there the river will
[1:22:43] di if he wanted the mountain to move he
[1:22:47] would not PR Lord he will speak the
[1:22:51] word this is what we are supposed to do
[1:22:54] let
[1:22:58] to we speak word from the beginning it
[1:23:03] was it
[1:23:06] for this issue of praying this issue of
[1:23:09] fasting let's go back to
[1:23:12] it we are

[1:23:33] theal
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:40] time
[1:23:43] Hallelujah there is a difference between
[1:23:46] praying and
[1:23:49] worshiping from the beginning it was it
[1:23:53] s before the four and the prophet says

[1:24:16] the season of speaking the
[1:24:20] way I always thought that people who cry
[1:24:24] too much in church they are

[1:30:14] truths that literally take the hearts of
[1:30:17] the children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:30:19] exactly so so saying we are going back
[1:30:22] to what to eeden
[1:30:24] we go
[1:30:29] fire so when if we want to go to
[1:30:32] Pentecost let's say we want Pentecost
[1:30:36] speaking in tongues prophesying all
[1:30:38] these things it does not come by fasting
[1:30:42] it does not come by praying this is the
[1:30:45] key this Divine
[1:30:48] fi
[1:30:51] shall the of the children
[1:30:56] do you hear
[1:30:58] that we going to eat fire Pentecost but
[1:31:03] if we want to be in Pentecost we preach
[1:31:06] the divinely
[1:31:09] revealed and the divinely revealed misud
[1:31:13] will
[1:31:14] literally tell the heart of the
[1:31:19] children
[1:31:21] exactly why we just preaching
[1:31:24] R Truth you see people being healed you
[1:31:27] see people beinged you see things
[1:31:30] happening without steing people's
[1:31:33] emotions just preaching the word
[1:31:36] hallelujah the word of God is casting
[1:31:39] out of evil spirit preaching right now
[1:31:44] Dem are going evil spirit are going the
[1:31:48] preaching of the word is the casting out
[1:31:51] of evil spirit you love
[1:31:55] him amen hallelujah
[1:31:58] hallelujah so now what is the brother
[1:32:03] says the first is SE
[1:32:07] 263 we find what the thunder
[1:32:12] means he says that's perfectly we know
[1:32:17] that see the Thunder was the voice of
[1:32:22] God when the
[1:32:28] understanding understand it what is is
[1:32:32] the voice of God when a SE is
[1:32:36] open when Moses was talking to God they
[1:32:40] had
[1:32:41] Thunders lightning and everything but
[1:32:45] Moses was hearing a voice what is it's a
[1:32:50] voice of God when the seal is open and
[1:32:55] says here in questions and answers
[1:32:57] paragraph I think is it question 395 or
[1:33:02] he says if the seven thers which equals
[1:33:07] seven Mysteries already been revealed
[1:33:11] someone is asking Mali 4 if the seven
[1:33:14] what thers which
[1:33:17] equals seven Mysteries already revealed
[1:33:21] or were they revealed in the second
[1:33:24] seals but are yet not known to us as
[1:33:30] stands yet so the question is were they
[1:33:33] revealed in the Seven Seals but are not
[1:33:36] yet known to us as standers yet says no
[1:33:41] they were revealed in the Seven
[1:33:44] Seals that's what the was about they was
[1:33:49] to
[1:33:50] reveal H like I was saying yesterday
[1:33:54] I say you see a revelation contained in
[1:33:59] the Seven
[1:34:01] Seals so Pastor and all our pastors We
[1:34:05] Don't Preach the seals because a seal is
[1:34:08] only a container a seal cannot help you
[1:34:12] the book is not
[1:34:15] written the SE no is written the
[1:34:20] revelation of the seven s amen are we
[1:34:24] together so a seal is like a container
[1:34:27] right and the water inside is the ther
[1:34:31] how many can say Amen are we together a
[1:34:35] seal is a container carrying the th that
[1:34:41] Dively revealed M
[1:34:45] truth the seven th which are the
[1:34:49] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:34:53] like I gave an example to say if you pay
[1:34:56] 1,000 to Pastor a is your you put it in
[1:35:01] the envelope and Pastor Adrian prays for
[1:35:03] the envelope and then he goes to the
[1:35:06] fuel station to refuel his car yes and
[1:35:11] then he takes the envelope to give the
[1:35:15] petrol attendant no is that right no
[1:35:18] what must he do he must break the se he
[1:35:22] must break the envelope
[1:35:24] and take the 1 inside which is
[1:35:29] the now I want to ask what is important
[1:35:34] the SE or
[1:35:37] the what is

[2:02:22] with oil and he says and when thou
[2:02:25] comest look out
[2:02:27] there the son of jeos the son of nimi
[2:02:32] and go in and make him arise up among
[2:02:37] his Breen and carry him to an inner
[2:02:41] chamber do you see the exception when
[2:02:44] you arrive there take jail in the inner
[2:02:46] chamber verse three then take the box of
[2:02:50] oil I like this and and put it on his
[2:02:54] head and say th say the Lord I have
[2:02:59] Anointed The King over Israel who is
[2:03:03] anointing the son of the Prophet who is
[2:03:06] under the anointing and the Hallelujah
[2:03:11] of
[2:03:12] [Music]
[2:03:13] el so who anointed it's not the son of a
[2:03:17] prophet it's
[2:03:18] Elijah it's the spirit of Elijah
[2:03:22] I have Anointed The King over
[2:03:26] Israel listen to this after you anointed
[2:03:29] them then open the door and flee and T
[2:03:34] not but this man instead of opening that
[2:03:38] door and running away he starts preing
[2:03:41] his own things he start saying so the
[2:03:45] young man even the young man of the
[2:03:47] Prophet went to ra and when he came
[2:03:49] behold the captains of the host sitting
[2:03:52] and he said I have been to thee Oh
[2:03:55] Captain and Je said unto which one of
[2:03:57] all us and he said to thee o and he
[2:04:01] arose and went in into the house and ped
[2:04:05] exactly like the instruction and poured
[2:04:07] the oil on his head and said unto him
[2:04:11] thus say the Lord God of Israel I have
[2:04:14] anointed thee King over my the people of
[2:04:18] the Lord even over
[2:04:20] Israel he was supposed to open the door
[2:04:23] and go after this according to the
[2:04:26] instructions but verse seven is now
[2:04:29] under a certain inspiration and he
[2:04:31] starting to say and th shall SM the
[2:04:34] house was he told all this no the house
[2:04:38] of you see so sometimes you hear people
[2:04:40] preaching and then where are they
[2:04:43] getting it can I say this the prophet
[2:04:45] says say what the says saying what the
[2:04:50] says does not mean
[2:04:52] repeating word for word it means preach
[2:04:56] the message but don't change the context
[2:05:00] youe it in any way so the young man is
[2:05:05] continuing I you see he's talking about
[2:05:08] the Judgment the blood of my servants
[2:05:11] the prophets and the blood of all the
[2:05:13] Servants of the Lord at the end of
[2:05:15] Jezebel for the whole house of Shall
[2:05:18] Perish and our c can you imagine is not
[2:05:21] about the other
[2:05:23] prophecies and then verse 10 and he says
[2:05:27] and the dogs shall eat
[2:05:30] jeel in the portion
[2:05:32] ofz there shall be none to Buri and he
[2:05:36] opened the door and fled Hallelujah so
