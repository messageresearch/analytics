[28:58] Abraham's blessings are mine

[29:04] because we have no
[29:07] hope
[29:08] we have no no imagination
[29:12] we have no creativity
[29:14] in our minds but faith is a substance of
[29:17] things

[30:41] nature
[30:43] amen God won't leave you in the
[30:45] condition he called you out of that's
[30:46] the point of this verses God is not
[30:49] calling you out to live in the condition

[30:52] God has a vision for you God is a plan
[30:55] for you God has a purpose for you yes

[31:22] opinion of that person already you don't

[31:38] you can't get positive words out of your
[31:40] mouth when you especially when it comes
[31:42] to people critical to the Core
[31:45] amen When you mention a good word they
[31:47] go silent
[31:50] they're like I know better I had
[31:51] different experience
[31:54] amen what are you doing
[31:57] you are magnifying the devil
[31:59] you are calling demons
[32:01] Britain is root of bitterness root of
[32:03] envy
[32:05] amen hallelujah amen we need to move I
[32:08] Will Bless thee make the name great and
[32:10] you shall be a blessing
[32:13] Hallelujah and if you know as long as
[32:15] your seed remains with you you can bless
[32:18] no one because the kingdom principles is
[32:21] sowing and briefing amen amen Hallelujah
[32:25] did Jesus say do unto others as you
[32:28] would have them do unto you
[32:30] you can bless people in lots of ways
[32:32] hallelujah amen blessed be the name of
[32:35] the Lord
[32:36] so
[32:40] so not only does he bless you but anyone
[32:43] next verse now and I will bless them
[32:45] that bless me
[32:47] amen
[32:50] didn't Jesus say that
[32:52] didn't they say a cup of water cold
[32:54] water
[32:55] blessing didn't brother Branham say
[32:57] those who do good to the bride yes
[33:00] Hallelujah
[33:02] now sometimes
[33:04] we don't want to take blessings
[33:07] somebody give you 100 no brother you
[33:08] keep it you need it more than me
[33:11] you don't know what they are trying to
[33:13] do
[33:14] and you are telling them basically take
[33:16] your seed out of my ground
[33:19] don't sow it in me because I don't want
[33:20] you to have a return
[33:23] I hope you're spiritually minded the
[33:25] animals
[33:27] amen
[33:29] now the laws of God oh
[33:32] how many hours we got
[33:36] we got three hours praise the Lord amen
[33:39] amen because when you leave here you'll
[33:41] be more empowered
[33:43] now the laws of God don't operate like
[33:45] the laws of man
[33:46] the kingdom of God operates on a
[33:48] different principle yes like
[33:50] when you go to school they teach you
[33:52] that ABC means A is for
[33:56] come on now
[33:57] let's see all of you all are talking
[33:59] different here when I said when you go
[34:01] to school
[34:03] did I say when you come into the kingdom
[34:05] of God I said when you go to school A is
[34:07] for
[34:09] B is for
[34:11] banana somebody saying ball something
[34:13] banana C is for
[34:16] but in the kingdom of God now you can go
[34:17] to the ramen in the Kingdom of God in
[34:19] your soul
[34:22] he said
[34:26] some of you didn't hear this
[34:28] I always believe
[34:30] and see is
[34:34] the kingdom of God operates differently
[34:36] to men
[34:39] A is for everyone didn't understand that
[34:41] maybe everyone don't know it A is for
[34:44] always
[34:48] Christ always believe Christ now even in
[34:53] the numbers they got it wrong
[34:55] they teach you in school one plus one
[34:57] equals
[34:59] sorry no no no no I'm talking to brother
[35:02] Jaden
[35:04] right
[35:05] I need to make them vocally in the
[35:07] church
[35:08] one plus one equals
[35:10] did you earlier in the back no your
[35:12] father didn't hear you one plus one
[35:15] equals
[35:16] two everyone uh
[35:18] right
[35:19] they teach you that one plus one equals
[35:22] two in the kingdom of God it's not that
[35:24] way
[35:25] Jesus says that this one plus this one
[35:29] these two shall become
[35:31] ah one plus one is one
[35:33] but please don't go write that now in
[35:35] your tears
[35:37] but I'm just showing you the kingdom of
[35:38] God operates differently
[35:41] Jesus said these two shall become one
[35:44] flesh right I'm gonna take you now into
[35:48] a bit more tricky uh
[35:50] equations
[35:52] because
[35:54] if you attend red
[35:56] and you gave me three Ram now please I
[35:59] know some of you are scratching your
[36:00] head already
[36:01] let's make it easy
[36:03] if I gave you 10 grand
[36:05] and you gave me five grand how much you
[36:07] got left
[36:09] okay you got five grand everyone agrees
[36:13] but in the kingdom of God it's not so
[36:18] in the kingdom of God it tells you when
[36:20] you give
[36:21] amen it shall come back to you press
[36:24] down shake it together and running over
[36:30] good
[36:31] that's how the kingdom of God operates
[36:33] now what happens when you hold back your
[36:35] blessing when you hold back to your seat
[36:38] does the farmer ever lose a seed when he
[36:40] puts it into the ground do you think
[36:42] he's oh I lost my seed
[36:46] did Jesus say bless it it's better to
[36:49] what
[36:51] come on now
[36:52] some of you I'm trying to get you to
[36:53] know the Bible too it's better to what
[36:55] than to
[36:57] see that you receive so when a farmer
[37:00] puts a seed into the ground
[37:02] he's sowing it by faith
[37:04] he's putting it there by faith
[37:07] and when he's putting it there by faith
[37:09] he is not looking at the one seed he put
[37:11] into the ground that's right he is
[37:13] looking at hours
[37:17] so the kingdom of God is multiplication
[37:20] the kingdom of God the kingdom of the
[37:23] world tells you that 10-5 is five the
[37:26] kingdom of God tells you that when you
[37:28] give it's multiplication
[37:31] that you lose nothing yes then it must
[37:34] come back to you even your work going
[37:36] forth from your mouth it shall not
[37:38] return void but it must accomplish the
[37:40] purpose what you must send
[37:44] [Music]
[37:47] without an expectation
[37:49] we don't wait there to see that word
[37:51] return to us
[37:54] the farmer doesn't go every day and
[37:55] re-dick the soil to see if the seed is
[37:57] growing you're so in faith amen and you
[38:00] move on
[38:01] hallelujah amen in fact Jesus teaches us
[38:04] even further that when you are helping
[38:06] one another if your brother says uh can
[38:08] I borrow 200 you give him 200. because
[38:11] in your head you don't want to become a
[38:13] slave to that 200 real because every
[38:15] time you see that brother you are
[38:17] thinking when is he going to give me
[38:18] back the 200 Ram
[38:22] so you become a slave to it
[38:25] and he's so friendly when you're talking
[38:27] to you but yet you think you're talking
[38:28] a lot of stories with me laughing and
[38:30] joking where's my 200.
[38:34] but that's a human nature
[38:37] because and you know why you won't
[38:38] receive the result because you haven't
[38:40] sewn it according to the principles of
[38:42] the kingdom of God
[38:43] yes yes
[38:47] you know the the
[38:49] even the Muslim world and all of these
[38:52] people who do good deeds they know that
[38:53] it's a law on the earth they give they
[38:56] sow because they know it's a reward and
[38:58] some people actually give because they
[39:00] know their principle
[39:01] they constantly blessing and giving and
[39:03] giving because they know they see a
[39:05] return they see a return God blesses
[39:07] them God blesses them but we haven't
[39:10] been taught these things
[39:12] we taught that you mustn't talk about
[39:14] money you mustn't talk about finances
[39:16] you mustn't teach the people but Jesus
[39:19] is talking about money Jesus is talking
[39:21] about talents that he gave people and
[39:23] now some just buried it in the ground
[39:24] Jesus said You shall put it to the usury
[39:26] and uninterest even instead of just
[39:28] letting it there
[39:30] amen so son do nothing with it
[39:34] but if you want to understand the
[39:36] kingdom of God you've got to operate in
[39:38] his kingdom
[39:39] now you can so many things you can go
[39:41] just past monetary you can so love to
[39:44] reap love
[39:47] yes you can sow kind words to receive
[39:49] kind words if you know somebody is
[39:52] talking constant ly bad about you you
[39:54] talk the best about them yes you know I
[39:57] never understood many things growing up
[39:58] because sometimes you know you just you
[40:01] just want you as a young person you're
[40:03] growing up and you wonder how the
[40:04] prophet could say like unless you can
[40:07] pray for your worst enemy and don't have
[40:10] that business in them
[40:12] then you realize what level of anointing
[40:13] this man was under that even buddy Paul
[40:16] would say you couldn't tell his enemies
[40:17] from his friends but we are getting to
[40:20] that level now amen amen hallelujah
[40:22] we're the end of all things we are
[40:24] coming to perfection
[40:26] Hallelujah
[40:28] amen glory be to his name so how many of
[40:31] you know what 10 minus five in the
[40:33] kingdom of God is multiplication
[40:36] in the kingdom of God is coming pressed
[40:38] down shaken together and running over
[40:39] amen hallelujah
[40:43] and that is why it says if you want to
[40:46] do good he says do good without sort of
[40:47] Faith first yes
[40:49] sometimes you know there's a need but
[40:51] you hold back
[40:52] you know somebody's in need
[40:55] but you're waiting for them you know it
[40:57] is more blessed to give than to receive
[40:59] even before they ask you you go and give
[41:00] it to them say brother I just the Lord
[41:02] just laid this on my heart this is for
[41:04] you amen amen you got an extra plate of
[41:07] Biryani at home and you you know that
[41:09] thing is going to go in the fridge and
[41:10] the next day there's a possibility of
[41:11] you throwing it away rather pack it in
[41:13] the container and say Brothers there I
[41:16] add some Biryani I thought of you and
[41:17] there's some Biryani for you
[41:19] amen
[41:21] don't think that in the middle of the
[41:22] night you know 12 o'clock come here
[41:25] I'm going to attracted Pizza
[41:27] you already had your portion
[41:30] sow it
[41:32] give it amen amen you shall not lose
[41:35] your blessing you know that's some
[41:37] that's a principle in the in the word of
[41:39] God wherever I read that people came and
[41:42] complained to the Lord and Jesus said no
[41:44] that's fine they won't lose their reward
[41:46] even though it wasn't according to what
[41:48] he was condoning even the when they came
[41:51] to the Apostle Paul did he did he say
[41:53] nevertheless let them go on because the
[41:56] name gospel is being preached amen
[41:58] there's a reward in everything we do for
[42:00] the kingdom of God
[42:01] amen
[42:03] glory be to his name now
[42:06] let's just go here quickly
[42:08] the Bible says there's a curse
[42:11] on the person that curses you
[42:14] right
[42:15] but Jesus says rather bless him to curse
[42:17] you
[42:20] you know why according to the law in the
[42:23] Kingdom they already cursed why do you
[42:25] want to double curse them
[42:27] so Jesus says rather bless them they're
[42:30] cursed him right yeah Jesus the Lord is
[42:33] talking to Abraham so right now all the
[42:35] families of the Earth are blessed
[42:37] because of who
[42:38] no
[42:40] no right now
[42:42] right now all the families on the Earth
[42:45] are blessed Because of You amen
[42:47] amen you are the Royal descendants
[42:49] you should unless you begin to think
[42:51] like this
[42:52] and come up to date
[42:54] we are not reading history
[42:57] we are talking present tense amen All
[43:00] Families on the other blessed because of
[43:02] me amen my presence make a difference
[43:04] wherever I go I walk into a business and
[43:07] the business is blessed yes I walk
[43:09] anywhere and I bless people
[43:13] amen
[43:14] hallelujah hallelujah you keep singing
[43:16] amen amen because you're going to
[43:17] believe that you're going to receive it
[43:18] and you're going to operate in his
[43:20] principles
[43:21] amen glory
[43:23] so
[43:25] right now everyone is blessed on the
[43:27] earth because of you
[43:31] God works with the living
[43:34] didn't the Bible say God is not a god of
[43:36] the Dead
[43:37] he's a god of them living amen you see
[43:40] I'm talking only a Bible this morning
[43:42] because I want you to understand the
[43:44] Bible
[43:45] so everyone is living under the
[43:47] influence right now
[43:49] because of the opening of the word
[43:57] I'm saying it again
[43:59] every religion every denomination every
[44:03] politician
[44:05] everyone
[44:08] even demon powers
[44:13] are operating on the earth now
[44:16] because of the opening of the word
[44:22] if the word wasn't open
[44:24] and it wasn't time and season the photos
[44:26] right I can't write
[44:28] and D L can't be open
[44:30] and Hell follows him come on up please
[44:33] be spiritual and dig deep what I'm
[44:34] telling you
[44:36] we are coming to the climax
[44:38] we are living right at the climax
[44:40] when demon powers religious powers and
[44:43] political Powers upon the Earth and all
[44:46] of them are not in the infancy stage
[44:48] amen they have grown to full maturity
[44:52] yes
[44:53] but all of them can only operate because
[44:55] of the value of the opening of the world
[45:00] because of the word that was opened
[45:02] because of the seals amen amen so what
[45:05] am I saying all of them are living under
[45:07] the influence of the Seven Seals yes
[45:12] yes everyone is living under the
[45:13] influence of the world everyone is
[45:15] prospering amen you say demon powder
[45:18] prospering yes
[45:20] they are waiting waiting war and they
[45:22] are prospering in what they are doing
[45:24] because the Bible says they deceive the
[45:27] entire Earth except those names that are
[45:29] found written in the book
[45:31] in order for them to do that they must
[45:33] be prospering in the Demonic force and
[45:35] attack
[45:37] politicians are prospering Russia is
[45:41] prospering America is prospering all the
[45:44] nations of the Earth are prospering
[45:48] right now August they're fixing to hold
[45:51] brick Cemetery in South Africa
[45:54] bricks currently has five countries
[45:59] hello Rick scandalia five countries you
[46:03] know what brick stands for it's an
[46:04] acronym for Brazil Russia
[46:06] India South Africa
[46:09] and China and South Africa right
[46:13] but if you go and search it out there's
[46:16] another five that wants to join
[46:19] and in August they're going to make a
[46:21] decision whether they're going to let
[46:22] these other five countries become part
[46:24] of brics
[46:26] so then what will they become will there
[46:29] only be five Kings or will there be ten
[46:30] Kings
[46:31] there will be ten Kings
[46:33] so you go read Revelation and you search
[46:35] out the Ten Kings I'm saying considerate
[46:40] I'm saying go search it out for yourself
[46:42] all I gave you was an example you go and
[46:45] see if these things be or not we just
[46:48] come out of what season
[46:49] amen
[46:51] we come out of the pride month
[46:53] July things are heating up this year
[46:55] celebrated across the Earth rainbow
[46:59] amen six and six color rainbow
[47:04] but there's a seventh rainbow over the
[47:06] mighty angel thank you there's a seven
[47:08] color rainbow with these people yes
[47:11] amen
[47:12] so everyone is living and coming to
[47:15] their full potential because of the
[47:17] influence of the opening of The Seven
[47:18] Seals
[47:20] amen after the seals will open the
[47:22] prophet of Revelation 10 sound forth his
[47:24] message and the entire Earth the entire
[47:27] peoples Nations tongues are living under
[47:30] the benefits and influence of the world
[47:32] prior to that nobody had Revelation yeah
[47:36] yeah oh you don't know what I'm telling
[47:38] you
[47:39] right they're all coming out for their
[47:41] interpretation go search Google and see
[47:44] how many hundreds of denominations are
[47:45] telling you who the Antichrist is
[47:48] where did they get that from under the
[47:50] influence of the opening of the world
[47:52] whether they like to believe it or not
[47:54] amen
[48:00] the entire Earth People's National
[48:02] stripes and towns are living under the
[48:05] blessing and influence of the opening of
[48:06] the world that is why you have seen an
[48:08] acceleration in the realm of science
[48:12] amen some of you younger people don't
[48:14] know this
[48:15] but we were 20 years and older would
[48:17] know this
[48:19] that we've seen acceleration in the
[48:21] realm of Science in the last 20 years we
[48:24] didn't have internet
[48:29] laughs
[48:31] we didn't have internet
[48:36] but especially if you tell your son
[48:37] there was nothing such as Internet
[48:40] we didn't have internet
[48:43] we we must take them for to the museum
[48:46] and show them the telephone
[48:48] that we used to use
[48:51] and not even some of us maybe don't even
[48:53] know the other telephones I know the
[48:55] ones where you you know you yeah some
[48:58] know the other one where you are to put
[48:59] this here and they I don't know there's
[49:01] older ones there's older ones right
[49:05] but we've seen an accelerator science
[49:09] the last 20 years
[49:10] why what's happening amen what you see
[49:15] naturally yes is a sign of spiritual
[49:17] that's right amen amen amen hallelujah
[49:21] you've seen an acceleration in science
[49:24] in the last 20 years because there's a
[49:26] rapid acceleration in the spiritual
[49:28] kingdom of God
[49:29] Satan is nothing but a counterfeit yeah
[49:32] why do they accelerate what is what is
[49:35] internet communication information being
[49:37] spread
[49:39] [Music]
[49:40] did he not open up
[49:43] come down to give us communication amen
[49:46] acceleration of communication
[49:49] open communication with the word
[49:51] [Music]
[49:52] that is a counterfeit
[49:56] Revelation 10 the angel comes down to
[49:58] the open book to influence
[50:01] to influence the Earth via communication
[50:05] that is why John is asked to prophesy
[50:08] again through communication and
[50:12] acceleration in communication but now
[50:14] the communication is not from the earth
[50:17] the communication is coming from Heaven
[50:19] to the end so man has been restored back
[50:22] to direct communication like are we
[50:25] finding Abraham and God having direct
[50:28] communication
[50:30] oh come on now we're going back to the
[50:33] root
[50:34] direct communication where we don't have
[50:37] to get the word from denominationalism
[50:39] we can get the word in his purity
[50:43] this is the mind of Christ
[50:45] the message of the hour
[50:48] right
[50:51] amen the message of the hour is not one
[50:53] way one of the ways you can get into the
[50:55] end time prophecies
[50:58] the message of Yahweh is the only way
[51:01] you have to count wire do you think God
[51:03] wasted his time using seven Messengers
[51:05] and now we can bypass the prophet
[51:07] because we understand the opening of the
[51:10] word
[51:14] God is building a continuity
[51:17] building and continuity
[51:19] amen I wish I can get past my second
[51:21] paragraph amen but
[51:23] it runs to a point like you've never
[51:25] seen before
[51:27] like these natural scientists operating
[51:30] on the earth and look at the technology
[51:31] they've given us in order for Rapid
[51:33] communication speech and acceleration in
[51:37] science amen because spiritual
[51:39] astronauts spiritual scientists have
[51:42] gone into the word of God
[51:44] amen and receiving from the mind of God
[51:47] amen what is this amen they are working
[51:51] it's natural scientists are working
[51:52] according to Natural laws but spiritual
[51:55] scientists are working according to
[51:57] spiritual laws
[51:59] amen
[52:01] and what are you doing they are doing
[52:03] the Greater Works so in order to compete
[52:06] now man in this Fallen State that's the
[52:08] rest of the Kingdom now the rest of
[52:10] mankind trying to compare with the
[52:13] Romans 8 19 men
[52:16] put it up
[52:17] trying to compete with this man that all
[52:20] creation is waiting for
[52:23] but they know that man in his normal
[52:26] condition in his Fallen condition can
[52:28] only reach a certain level
[52:31] so they have created something called
[52:33] artificial intelligence
[52:35] yes
[52:39] right now artificial intelligence is a
[52:42] focal point in the scientific world
[52:46] it's because of this
[52:48] sons of God are manifesting on the earth
[52:51] now amen amen come on now yeah
[52:55] because they are trying to compete with
[52:57] the God man
[53:00] they have to get some form of assistance
[53:04] to compete with the God man
[53:06] do you know even right now you can make
[53:08] use of artificial intelligence you can
[53:10] get it to write to an essay
[53:12] you're just gonna put the topic in
[53:14] Chad GP what is it called
[53:17] chat GPT you could put the subject in
[53:20] that thing will type out a word you can
[53:22] tell it how many pages how many words
[53:24] and everything it will write it for you
[53:27] you can even say write it in plain
[53:28] English so they don't know that it was
[53:32] write it in plain English it'll write
[53:34] whatever you say you speak to it you see
[53:37] what I'm saying you speak to it
[53:39] and it will produce back what you said
[53:42] sounds familiar yeah
[53:46] it is a copycat
[53:48] artificial intelligence has gotten the
[53:51] world right now
[53:55] and the world is scared of this
[53:57] technology you'll see even last week the
[53:59] two weeks these uh actors or these
[54:02] scriptwriters were protesting in
[54:03] Hollywood because you can go to chat GPT
[54:06] or there's more maybe there's more
[54:08] advanced AI technology
[54:10] and you can just go type up a product
[54:12] and that thing will produce a script for
[54:14] you so you don't need the imagination of
[54:17] a man
[54:18] to produce a good movie anymore
[54:22] that's what the protest was about
[54:25] that they want to replace them with
[54:28] artificial intelligence so there's no
[54:30] need of scriptwriters
[54:36] and
[54:38] artificial intelligence is progressing
[54:40] to a place
[54:41] where they will replace actors
[54:44] they will take the best features
[54:46] of that person
[54:48] and they will create an artificial
[54:50] person that you will never know that is
[54:52] not a real person acting there
[54:55] so now even the actors are getting
[54:56] worried
[55:00] okay so you're seeing a rapid
[55:02] acceleration an impersonation
[55:05] you're going to see this rapid
[55:06] impersonation in the religious World
[55:08] amongst denominations as well
[55:13] Hallelujah
[55:15] amen amen what are they trying to do
[55:17] trying to compete with sons and
[55:19] daughters who are coming into sonship
[55:20] and Authority now who are coming into
[55:22] the image of priests and kings
[55:27] amen who are having Dominion on the
[55:29] earth now
[55:31] come on now that's about the time you
[55:33] get tired
[55:34] having Dominion on the earth now
[55:36] let me tell you God wants to take care
[55:38] of your situation amen but you keep
[55:40] saying Amen to the word God's going to
[55:41] deliver you right now
[55:43] amen you may feel like you messed up you
[55:46] may feel like you're nothing but God is
[55:47] showing you you all to be conditioned
[55:49] amen creation is even groaning waiting
[55:51] for you
[55:52] amen hallelujah because when God
[55:55] delivers he delivers properly amen thank
[55:58] you when God sets free breaks all chains
[56:03] amen and this artificial intelligence
[56:07] I'm going to say this way is going to
[56:09] impact the world in ways that you and I
[56:10] can't even imagine
[56:15] so they're trying to compete with sons
[56:17] and daughters who are coming upon the
[56:18] earth now
[56:20] amen coming into sonship Authority
[56:22] having dominion over the Earth man in
[56:24] the image and likeness of God
[56:29] and our intelligence is not artificial
[56:33] amen hallelujah
[56:36] you you have got like intelligence
[56:40] not artificial intelligence what's
[56:42] artificial
[56:44] something faith
[56:46] they don't know what to do to compete
[56:48] with this man that's here on the Earth
[56:50] that they have to create artificial
[56:52] intelligence
[56:55] amen
[56:56] why
[56:57] who has the mind of Christ
[56:59] if you think I'm wrong
[57:01] you have Godlike intelligence
[57:04] you tell tell your neighbor now tell
[57:07] them I I have the mind of Christ
[57:12] now when you say that I want you to
[57:13] apply that in everyday life the moment
[57:16] you you operate and you handle any
[57:18] situation from the candle or the flesh
[57:20] point of view you lost
[57:23] the moment you retaliate from the flesh
[57:25] you lost
[57:28] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[57:31] but against spiritual wickedness rulers
[57:34] of Darkness where
[57:36] in high places
[57:41] so in the idea in high places can you
[57:43] enter thy place in the flesh
[57:46] how do you enter spiritual places
[57:49] spiritually
[57:51] didn't Ephesians say we are blessed with
[57:52] all spiritual blessings in
[57:54] Heavenly places Heavenly places is high
[57:58] places
[58:00] I know we got a lot of students here of
[58:02] the world you'll say brother Brian said
[58:03] Heavenly places believer's position in
[58:06] Christ but the believer's position in
[58:07] Christ is a high place
[58:10] so when we are fighting battles to
[58:13] release words against one another
[58:16] to release words against our children
[58:18] our our brothers our sisters do we
[58:23] release words to fight it
[58:25] or to release words into that atmosphere
[58:30] this is deep teaching now where are we
[58:33] releasing our words
[58:35] where are we releasing the power and the
[58:37] blood of Jesus Amen father I release
[58:40] this word now into the Heavenly
[58:41] atmosphere into spiritual atmosphere and
[58:44] the Earthly atmosphere all around me is
[58:46] changing right now
[58:48] amen amen
[58:55] I know your flesh is not liking this
[58:57] I know your flesh is resisting this
[59:01] but I'm talking to your spirit man right
[59:03] now
[59:04] if you want to operate like this person
[59:08] you've got to operate by the power of
[59:11] your word
[59:12] you've got to break down tear down
[59:14] casting down imaginations amen too many
[59:16] of us have imaginations we think this
[59:18] person don't like me this person said
[59:20] that about me this person this person
[59:22] all focused on what this person said
[59:25] that person said but what we begin to
[59:26] call from is something called a
[59:29] complex
[59:32] so we form a complex about this person
[59:34] and all our interaction and reaction
[59:36] with that person is based out of this
[59:38] complex
[59:39] so we can't get the Victory and we can't
[59:41] get the freedom because out of this
[59:42] complex but you can speak to what you
[59:45] want you can speak what you want to see
[59:49] that's why Jesus says that you do unto
[59:52] others as you would have them do unto
[59:56] amen
[59:59] why are you teaching me the Bible
[1:00:03] they have the original intelligence they
[1:00:06] have the mind of Christ and they know
[1:00:08] what he wants done with the word they
[1:00:10] have that saith the Lord and the word of
[1:00:12] God is in there
[1:00:15] we have the mind of Christ
[1:00:18] amen I can't be bothered about what you
[1:00:22] say about me because you are trying to
[1:00:24] disturb my spirit
[1:00:26] you are trying to get me out of my
[1:00:27] heavenly atmosphere
[1:00:30] you know how much control you must have
[1:00:33] now I'm going to tell you something
[1:00:35] right you've seen glimpses of perfect
[1:00:38] Faith here in this church
[1:00:41] hello amen you've experienced it this
[1:00:45] year Glimpse is a perfect Faith now
[1:00:49] what happens
[1:00:50] if you lived in the realm all the time
[1:00:53] not only when you were desperate
[1:00:58] yes
[1:01:01] you know what I'm saying amen because
[1:01:03] the prophet says Jesus lived in this
[1:01:05] world of perfect faith
[1:01:07] now most of your testimonies if you go
[1:01:09] and examine it it was because of its
[1:01:12] need
[1:01:13] a situation that Faith rose up in you
[1:01:16] that you decided to speak to that
[1:01:18] situation I'm asking you what happens if
[1:01:21] you lived in that Rhythm all the time oh
[1:01:24] God yes yes amen
[1:01:28] forgive me for using you as an example
[1:01:30] brother Caleb
[1:01:32] right
[1:01:33] but here's a brother that saw his car
[1:01:36] losing oil
[1:01:39] now because he must have reached a point
[1:01:41] of desperation
[1:01:42] to go and find a scripture that wasn't
[1:01:45] even talking about high engines but it
[1:01:48] spoke about oil and now the foolish
[1:01:50] virgins were losing oil
[1:01:52] and he said Lord I'm not the foolish
[1:01:54] virgin because how many of you know that
[1:01:56] not only you are blessed but everything
[1:01:58] you own the property everything you own
[1:02:01] in life is blessed
[1:02:03] I am literally only on my second
[1:02:05] paragraph but I am going to close right
[1:02:07] now because I can sense your faith level
[1:02:09] is high
[1:02:10] amen but we build it
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:15] now what happens
[1:02:17] if somebody is in need of spiritual oil
[1:02:21] what is oil
[1:02:25] can I have confidence now because my
[1:02:28] brother
[1:02:29] has so much of Faith to believe that his
[1:02:32] car will not lose oil
[1:02:34] why can't I have confidence in him to
[1:02:36] use the same faith
[1:02:38] to pray over you need spiritual oil amen
[1:02:41] yes
[1:02:46] see but we think it's beyond us
[1:02:48] we think it's not
[1:02:50] it's not true I'm not called for them
[1:02:51] but but you add a need there you call
[1:02:54] for it
[1:02:55] why can't God use you now to touch
[1:02:56] others amen
[1:02:59] okay
[1:03:01] Sisters You prayed over situations you
[1:03:03] saw the miraculous power of God Amen
[1:03:05] touch a meal you think God is only
[1:03:07] limiting you to your husband to your to
[1:03:09] your own situation
[1:03:12] God can use you
[1:03:14] did Paul have co-workers in the gospel
[1:03:17] we need to fitly frame the gifts in the
[1:03:20] church
[1:03:22] that you become a valuable part in the
[1:03:24] body of Christ
[1:03:25] that we rely on you
[1:03:27] we are depending on your prayer
[1:03:30] right so next time somebody is sick
[1:03:33] can I have confidence to call you and
[1:03:35] say right brother
[1:03:36] lands on this person and pray
[1:03:40] yes
[1:03:43] if you've seen the glimpse of Faith once
[1:03:45] why can't you bring it in operation
[1:03:47] again yes yes and these were not
[1:03:49] ordinary miracles
[1:03:51] hello this is going beyond the ordinary
[1:03:55] amen yes
[1:03:58] can I say these are third two
[1:03:59] manifestations
[1:04:04] and I'm asking you if you can only live
[1:04:07] in that world of perfect faith what kind
[1:04:09] of person
[1:04:10] will this be the image coming on the
[1:04:12] earth yes yes
[1:04:15] not only when there's a need
[1:04:18] even before there's a need
[1:04:19] you say how do I do that father your
[1:04:22] daily prayer Lord even now Lord Jesus I
[1:04:25] pray for the people in the church
[1:04:27] they're going through situations trials
[1:04:29] father I pray Lord and I I start to
[1:04:31] resist and I bind and I curse some of
[1:04:33] you have seen situations change in your
[1:04:35] homes and you don't even know how
[1:04:38] but there's somebody on the knees
[1:04:39] praying every night
[1:04:40] I'm praying for you amen you are praying
[1:04:43] for one another yes sometimes you don't
[1:04:45] even have the faith because the
[1:04:47] situation is so great and so massive in
[1:04:49] your mind you don't know how you've been
[1:04:51] dealing with the situation but you've
[1:04:52] seen stronger with great you've seen
[1:04:55] chains break yes no that's the power of
[1:04:58] Prayer
[1:05:02] I am saying you need to realize your
[1:05:04] position in the body of Christ you can
[1:05:06] go read the quote let's just read our
[1:05:08] quotes and we'll finish I've got two
[1:05:09] quotes and maybe this will help you amen
[1:05:11] until we come back again
[1:05:13] blessed be the name of the Lord look
[1:05:15] like we have to have church in sessions
[1:05:17] now we have one session and we break we
[1:05:19] come back for another session
[1:05:21] amen so the prophet is talking about the
[1:05:24] word being restored back to the church
[1:05:25] now right it's not a Protestant Doctrine
[1:05:28] a Catholic Doctrine but we as
[1:05:31] Pentecostals integrated with man-made
[1:05:34] theology talking about the word how it
[1:05:35] was into bread that when you show
[1:05:37] somebody baptism they tell you about our
[1:05:39] church baptizes this way but our pastor
[1:05:43] allows women preachers
[1:05:45] you see what the property is meaning
[1:05:46] here they've taken the word of God and
[1:05:48] interpret it with man-made theology
[1:05:51] right you see where we're getting no
[1:05:54] wonder God can't set Revival got nothing
[1:05:57] to build on so here's the important part
[1:05:59] I want to get to he'll take individuals
[1:06:02] and build it on them individuals
[1:06:05] and declare them before the world
[1:06:08] who stay with us
[1:06:12] who stay with the word
[1:06:15] right that's in condemnation by
[1:06:17] representation preach 1960 then
[1:06:19] beautiful quotes and the stature for
[1:06:21] perfect man God never sent me to build
[1:06:23] organizations God sent me to build who
[1:06:26] is God building us individually
[1:06:29] as the focus changed from
[1:06:31] like just a corporate anointing and the
[1:06:34] focus of Spotlight has been going into
[1:06:36] individual lives now
[1:06:38] God Christ sent me to build individuals
[1:06:40] to the statue of Jesus Christ
[1:06:43] that they might be the what
[1:06:46] and the dwelling place of the Spirit by
[1:06:49] what
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:52] so can you have the spirit without
[1:06:54] feeding on the word
[1:06:55] how is he doing it they are becoming the
[1:06:58] PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the
[1:07:00] spirit the Holy Spirit by his
[1:07:03] and then he goes on to say how is he
[1:07:05] going to build up the individual to the
[1:07:06] place by his
[1:07:08] by his word one more and he just
[1:07:11] continues his quote not build an
[1:07:13] organization to a greater denomination
[1:07:15] but build an individual to Sons and
[1:07:18] Daughters of God that's the idea
[1:07:22] what's the idea is it an imagination
[1:07:25] is it in the back
[1:07:27] the God had this thought in his mind
[1:07:29] what's an idea
[1:07:31] it's something in him God gave you an
[1:07:33] imagination God had imagination God had
[1:07:36] creativity in him
[1:07:37] so he's telling you that God's thoughts
[1:07:39] got the attributes now it was in God's
[1:07:42] thoughts all along to build you
[1:07:45] build an individual to Sons and
[1:07:47] Daughters of God that's the Romans 8 19
[1:07:50] man coming on the earth now

[1:08:35] help somebody
[1:08:39] was God willing to give Abraham
[1:08:41] everything
[1:08:42] is everyone paying attention
[1:08:47] God is willing
[1:08:49] to give you everything in this life

[1:08:56] willing to give Abraham everything
[1:08:59] hold nothing back
[1:09:01] right
[1:09:04] now if we take in progression of time
[1:09:06] did God give us his best
[1:09:09] does God give us his best was Jesus
[1:09:12] Christ the best
[1:09:14] right that John 3 16 now
[1:09:17] ask yourself can I give God my best
[1:09:20] if he gave me the best
[1:09:22] if God is not going to hold back
[1:09:25] anything for me yes why can't I
[1:09:27] Surrender everything to him yes why do
[1:09:29] you have to see up seasons of dryness in
[1:09:31] my life Seasons where I fall and failed

[1:09:53] talking to a man who can't have children

[1:10:01] couldn't have children but God is
[1:10:03] looking past your problem
[1:10:05] and he's saying in multiplying I will
[1:10:07] multiply you

[1:10:19] Abraham in an impossible situation
[1:10:23] if anyone's looking at Abraham that it's
[1:10:25] impossible what God is saying
[1:10:28] that he can't have children
