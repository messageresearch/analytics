[12:21] of kings. Oh, praise the Lord. Worship
[12:25] the Lord. Give glory that his name.
[12:30] Oh, bless the name of the Lord.
[12:35] As you all
[12:38] eternity,

[12:42] I want to praise

[12:53] more.
[12:55] [Music]
[12:56] I shall reign with
[13:00] [Music]
[13:04] Hallelujah.
[13:06] All hail King Jesus.
[13:09] All hail Emmanuel this morning. Father,
[13:12] we lift up our hands to you, oh God.
[13:14] From whence cometh our help, oh God. And
[13:17] Lord, we just want to bow our heads to
[13:19] the dust of the ground from where you
[13:21] have taken us, Lord. Realizing that we
[13:23] are nothing without you, Lord. We stand
[13:26] here today, Lord, well in our bodies
[13:28] because of your grace upon our lives,
[13:30] Father. And we know, Lord, when our time
[13:33] on earth is done, Lord, you will call us
[13:35] away to our place of rest, oh God. But
[13:38] while we have breath in our lungs, we
[13:40] want to give you praise, oh God. And
[13:42] Lord, we want to come and serve you,
[13:44] Lord, to worship you, Father. And Lord,
[13:47] even sit around your feet this morning,
[13:49] around your precious word, oh God, that
[13:52] you have delivered to your people,
[13:54] Father. I pray Lord you'll come once
[13:56] again and speak to us through your word
[13:58] oh God and I pray you'll bless the
[13:59] gathering together of the saints father
[14:02] Lord even as our needs to fall one from
[14:04] another father I pray you will come down
[14:06] great Jehovah Gyra and meet us to the
[14:09] point of our needs we want to say we
[14:11] love you we appreciate you Lord we thank
[14:13] you Lord for the brothers and the
[14:15] sisters in this assembly Lord we pray
[14:17] for them we pray you'll bless them Lord
[14:19] Jesus and father I pray oh God that you
[14:21] would come now the mighty angel of God
[14:23] and speak to us through your word. We
[14:25] ask his blessings now in the name.
[14:30] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[14:31] the Lord this morning.
[14:32] Amen. Good to be back in the house of
[14:34] the Lord to worship him and give him
[14:36] praise. Amen. So, greet you all. Amen.
[14:39] In the name that is above every other
[14:41] name.
[14:42] Amen. And I pray that we are praying for
[14:44] one another. Everyone praying for one
[14:46] another.
[14:47] Amen.
[14:50] Amen. Praying for one another.
[14:53] Amen.
[14:55] Praying for yourselves. The Bible says
[14:57] pray always.
[14:59] Amen. Hallelujah. And even as we see the
[15:02] day fast approaching.
[15:04] Amen. We ought to pray even more
[15:05] earnestly. Amen. Let's turn to our
[15:07] Bibles this morning.
[15:11] Amen. We'll start reading at
[15:14] 2 Kings chapter 2 and verse 8.
[15:19] Amen. 2 Kings chapter 2 and verse 8.
[15:25] We'll speak this morning little thought
[15:28] a double portion anointing.
[15:30] Amen. That's what we have.
[15:33] We have a double portion anointing.
[15:37] Amen. 2 Kings chapter 2 and verse 8
[15:40] reads.
[15:41] And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped
[15:44] it together and smoked the waters. And
[15:48] they were divided hither and tither. And
[15:51] so that they too went over on dry
[15:54] ground. And it came to pass when they
[15:57] were gone over that Elijah said to
[16:00] Elisha,
[16:02] "Ask what I shall do for thee
[16:04] before I be taken away from thee." And
[16:07] Elisha said, "I pray thee, let a double
[16:10] portion of thy spirit be upon me."
[16:14] Amen.
[16:14] Amen.
[16:15] Amen. Mhm.
[16:17] And he said, "Thou has a thing.
[16:20] Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am
[16:24] taken from thee, it shall be so unto
[16:26] thee. But if not, it shall not be so."
[16:31] Amen.
[16:31] And it came. So what is he saying? You
[16:33] got to stick with the prophet.
[16:35] You can't let your eyes get distracted
[16:37] and take your eye off the prophet.
[16:40] Watch his every movement.
[16:42] Amen. So he says, "And it came to pass
[16:46] as they still went on and talked that
[16:49] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[16:52] and horses of fire."
[16:54] Glory
[16:55] and part of them bought a thunder
[16:57] and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[17:00] heaven.
[17:02] Examine that, scientists.
[17:04] Where did the chariots appear from?
[17:06] Amen. Where did the horses of fire
[17:08] appear from?
[17:10] Amen. And where did Elijah go? In a
[17:13] whirlwind into heaven.
[17:15] Amen.
[17:16] And Elisha saw it. Critics in the
[17:19] message room and say, "We want the
[17:20] evidence of it."
[17:24] Amen. But we got to take the Bible's
[17:25] account.
[17:28] And Elijah saw it and cried, "My father,
[17:30] my father, the chariot of Israel, and
[17:33] the horsemen thereof." And he saw him no
[17:36] more. And he took hold of his own
[17:39] clothes and rent them in two pieces.
[17:43] And he and stood by the bank of the
[17:46] Jordan. Notice he took Let's drop my
[17:48] volume a bit. Amen. And notice he took
[17:50] the mantle of Elijah.
[17:52] Amen.
[17:54] The mantle of Elijah is not laying in
[17:56] the grave.
[17:57] Amen.
[17:58] The mantle of Elijah is being passed on.
[18:00] Amen.
[18:02] Amen. He fell from him and went back and
[18:05] stood by the banks of Jordan. Now notice
[18:09] as mysterious and supernatural as Elijah
[18:12] is taken up, the mantle fell down.
[18:15] Amen.
[18:18] Amen. He says he also took up the mantle
[18:21] of Elijah that fell from him and went
[18:25] back and stood by the bank of Jordan.
[18:28] And he took the mantle of Elijah that
[18:30] fell from him and smoked the waters.
[18:33] Amen.
[18:34] Amen.
[18:35] And said, "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[18:38] Amen.
[18:39] And when he also had smitten the waters,
[18:42] they parted hither and thither. And
[18:44] Elijah Elisha went over. Amen.
[18:48] Amen. May the Lord have blessings to the
[18:50] reading of his word. You may be seated.
[18:52] Amen.
[18:55] Now, whatever you read there, that's
[18:58] exactly what's going on now in the
[18:59] message.
[19:00] Amen.
[19:01] Amen.
[19:02] Elijah's mantle has fallen.
[19:05] The bride has got a hold of that mantle.
[19:08] Amen.
[19:08] Amen.
[19:10] But I want to ask you, have you smoked
[19:12] the waters?
[19:14] Amen. Have you used the power that's
[19:17] laying in the message of the hour?
[19:20] Amen. We can walk around with Elijah's
[19:22] mantle
[19:24] and never use the mantle.
[19:26] But we've got to use the mantle that's
[19:28] been passed on to us.
[19:30] Brother Brandon said, "The bride under a
[19:33] messenger will become the final voice to
[19:36] the final age."
[19:37] Hallelujah.
[19:37] You cannot change that quote.
[19:39] Amen.
[19:40] Amen.
[19:40] Amen. That quote must come to
[19:42] fulfillment. Hallelujah.
[19:44] He did not say the tapes will be the
[19:46] final voice to the final age.
[19:48] Because that will be breaking Revelation
[19:50] 10.
[19:51] Amen.
[19:51] Amen. Revelation 10 ends with a
[19:54] commission given to John who is a type
[19:57] of the bride to prophesy again.
[20:00] Amen.
[20:00] And once that prophecy is finished, next
[20:04] comes Revelation 11, which is the two
[20:06] prophets to the Jews.
[20:08] Yes. Amen. So, Revelation 10 ends with
[20:11] the bride's prophecy.
[20:13] Amen.
[20:14] Amen. Hallelujah. I also want to say
[20:18] that the bride's prophecy is not a
[20:19] mysterious prophecy and a sealed
[20:22] prophecy.
[20:23] Amen.
[20:24] Yes. Amen.
[20:25] Amen.
[20:27] Because all the mysteries of God have
[20:30] been revealed.
[20:31] Amen.
[20:32] Amen.
[20:33] Hallelujah.
[20:34] Amen. So we find that the word must
[20:37] position us in our ought to be
[20:39] condition.
[20:42] Amen.
[20:43] Now it's not just any word.
[20:48] Everybody's got the written word.
[20:50] Amen.
[20:51] Anyone wants to go and buy a Bible, even
[20:54] give the Bibles free, they have the
[20:56] written word. Amen.
[20:58] So what when we are saying the word must
[21:00] position us, you know, ought to be
[21:02] conditioned, we are talking about the
[21:04] right kind of word.
[21:05] Amen.
[21:07] A word that was promised to believers,
[21:09] right?
[21:10] Amen.
[21:11] Now, everyone that's preaching the word
[21:14] has an objective and aim.
[21:16] Amen. Some seek man-made objectives to
[21:20] control the people with their idea. So
[21:23] the people end up glorifying and
[21:26] worshiping the idea more than worshiping
[21:29] God.
[21:29] Amen.
[21:30] Amen.
[21:31] Amen.
[21:32] The church will preach a word so that
[21:34] you can denominate around their creed
[21:36] and their dogma.
[21:38] And make you believe that you can find
[21:40] salvation in their church denomination.
[21:44] Amen.
[21:45] Amen. Because that is the word the
[21:47] people are receiving and the people
[21:49] start to worship that idea that if you
[21:52] don't fellowship with us you cannot find
[21:54] salvation.
[21:56] Some say outside of the Baptist church
[21:57] you cannot find salvation. Outside of
[22:00] the Methodist church, the Presbyterian
[22:02] church, the Anglican church, the
[22:04] Catholic Church,
[22:06] right?
[22:06] Amen.
[22:07] Amen. The Jehovah Witness Church, the
[22:09] Seventh Day Adventist are teaching you
[22:12] their gospel as truth.
[22:15] and they will point you to their
[22:17] organization or their lodge.
[22:19] Amen.
[22:20] But we know that these branches are
[22:22] grafted into the original vine.
[22:26] And they are living of the original
[22:28] life.
[22:29] Amen.
[22:30] Amen.
[22:31] Now we are in our time.
[22:35] At our time you'll find that they cannot
[22:38] produce the fruit of the original vine.
[22:42] Amen.
[22:43] Amen. harvest time. You can't hide the
[22:45] fruit.
[22:46] Amen.
[22:47] It's manifestation time.
[22:48] Amen.
[22:49] And the fruit that they bring forth will
[22:51] be a denominational fruit.
[22:54] And only the original branch as the
[22:57] original life flowing through the
[22:59] original seed which will bring forth the
[23:02] original fruit which is the life of
[23:04] Christ.
[23:05] Hallelujah.
[23:07] Amen.
[23:08] Now I want to break that down further.
[23:11] When I'm saying people are worshiping an
[23:12] idea more than worshiping God.
[23:17] If I take take an idea and I tell you
[23:20] that you must only listen to control
[23:23] worship now to the prophet's message at
[23:26] 2:00 on a Sunday evening.
[23:31] What is that?
[23:35] Now, everyone who subscribes to that
[23:37] idea is promoting that idea.
[23:40] Anytime you talk to them, they'll only
[23:42] promote that idea.
[23:44] Even when they listening to that tape,
[23:46] they're not listening to what the
[23:47] prophet's saying. They are more
[23:48] satisfied that they are following that
[23:50] idea.
[23:52] Amen.
[23:53] They feel justified. Oh, I'm just doing
[23:56] what
[23:57] I'm supposed to be doing. Do you get my
[23:59] thought?
[23:59] They're worshiping the idea more than
[24:02] worshiping God. Amen.
[24:05] It should also we should also take
[24:08] introspection this morning because we
[24:10] subscribe to the idea and the word of
[24:12] God that we should not forsake the
[24:15] assembling together of ourselves
[24:17] even as the man of some is.
[24:19] Yes.
[24:20] But we mustn't just worship the idea of
[24:23] coming together
[24:25] and feel oh we did our religious duty.
[24:28] When we come into the house of God, we
[24:31] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[24:35] We must give it our all.
[24:38] Hold nothing back when it comes
[24:43] because we know that faith cometh by the
[24:46] hearing of the word.
[24:47] Amen.
[24:48] So you can listen to any preacher, but
[24:50] the faith that you are going to produce
[24:52] out of that ministry
[24:54] may not be the same.
[24:57] You listen to a Baptist minister, you'll
[24:59] get a Baptist faith.
[25:02] You listen to an Anglican minister,
[25:03] you'll get an Anglican faith.
[25:07] But if you want rapturing faith,
[25:09] Hallelujah.
[25:09] There's only one channel and source it's
[25:11] coming out of.
[25:13] Amen. So, the true wife of the Lord
[25:16] Jesus Christ only has an appetite for
[25:19] the true word of God.
[25:21] Amen. Yes.
[25:23] It's my duty as your pastor to tell you
[25:26] filter what you are listening to.
[25:32] Amen. We have to have a filter and
[25:35] filter out anything that's contrary to
[25:38] God's word.
[25:39] Yes. We ought to have discernment of
[25:42] spirit
[25:43] to know whether a minister be it outside
[25:46] the message or even in the ranks of the
[25:48] message is sewing seeds of faith or
[25:52] sewing seeds of discrepancy.
[25:55] Try every spirit.
[25:57] Yes.
[25:58] Judas was in the church.
[26:00] Judas was performing signs, wonders, and
[26:02] miracles.
[26:03] The only time you could set Judas apart
[26:06] was in the upper room. Not in the upper
[26:08] room. In the last supper
[26:10] when Jesus told him go do what you must
[26:12] do quickly.
[26:14] Other than that you would have embraced
[26:15] Judas. You would have fellowship to
[26:17] Judas. You would have washed Judah's
[26:19] feet.
[26:24] Amen. And because Judas had the money
[26:26] bag, you know that he would order you
[26:28] your right kind of Nando's meal.
[26:32] So you would have been good to Judas.
[26:36] All right.
[26:39] So the right kind of word is giving the
[26:41] true wife of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[26:44] right kind of faith. We are talking
[26:46] about perfect faith.
[26:47] Amen.
[26:48] Translation faith,
[26:50] rapturing faith,
[26:52] something that has not been seen since
[26:56] Jesus and the disciples were taken up.
[27:00] Amen.
[27:01] So what you are believing sounds
[27:03] ridiculous to the world.
[27:06] Amen.
[27:08] Amen.
[27:11] Amen. So we are waiting for and we are
[27:14] hearing the word and we're getting
[27:17] rapturing faith to step into rapturing
[27:19] grace. Amen.
[27:22] This kind of faith is giving us grace to
[27:24] overcome.
[27:24] Amen.
[27:26] Overcoming power to overcome later.
[27:28] Amen.
[27:29] Yes.
[27:29] Amen. To overcome the world and all its
[27:32] temptation.
[27:33] Amen.
[27:34] Overcome the flesh.
[27:36] and live a life above reproach.
[27:40] Amen. Overcome sickness, overcome mind
[27:43] battles, to overcome mental oppression,
[27:46] to live a victorious life as an
[27:49] overcomer in Christ Jesus.
[27:52] Amen.
[27:53] Amen.
[27:54] If we can find Amen. this quote,
[27:58] let's uh find this in uh the church age
[28:01] book. I'll start to read it. Now we said
[28:04] everyone's got an objective and a hand.
[28:07] Now we are following the message of
[28:09] William Marry and Brandham.
[28:11] Amen.
[28:12] Okay. We say that unreservedly. We say
[28:14] that without being ashamed.
[28:17] That is our prophet.
[28:18] Amen.
[28:18] He's a scriptural prophet.
[28:20] Amen.
[28:22] Amen. Revelation 10.
[28:24] That's why we are gathered at 10 manner.
[28:30] Amen. So let's listen to our prophet's
[28:32] objective and motive for preaching. You
[28:36] see, we can also start isms. You can
[28:38] find the smallest thing
[28:39] and start isms,
[28:42] right? I just clicked here when I drove
[28:45] into the yard. I saw Revelation 10 and
[28:48] the next one is verse 8. So we need to
[28:50] claim that property.
[28:54] So we have Revelation 108, right?
[28:59] He says, "Now listen to the prophet's
[29:00] objective. You want to know why you're
[29:02] following the message? Where is the
[29:04] prophet leading me to?"
[29:05] Right?
[29:06] Let's see what he says. He says, "Not
[29:08] for one moment do I bring a message to
[29:11] the people that they may follow me or
[29:14] join my church
[29:15] or start some fellowship and
[29:18] organization."
[29:20] Right?
[29:20] I have never done that and will not do
[29:23] that now.
[29:24] Amen. I want to accomplish there. This
[29:28] is what he wants to accomplish
[29:31] and men.
[29:32] Amen.
[29:33] Wherein men live according to his word.
[29:39] Now I don't know why people would find
[29:40] fault in that when he's one of the only
[29:44] close to the Lord Jesus Christ that so
[29:47] everybody see brother Brandham's
[29:48] objective and motive
[29:50] establish a relationship with the Lord
[29:53] Jesus Christ.
[29:55] Amen.
[29:55] You say if I go to denomination don't
[29:57] they also say that? No they are
[30:00] preaching another Jesus.
[30:02] That's right. That's right.
[30:03] They say but Jesus loves us.
[30:07] We cannot find security just in that
[30:09] statement that you are loved by Jesus.
[30:12] Because the Bible says that when Jesus
[30:14] saw the rich young ruler,
[30:16] the Bible says it's recorded there in
[30:18] black and white.
[30:19] That's right.
[30:20] Jesus looking upon this young man loved
[30:23] him.
[30:23] That's right. Amen.
[30:25] So is that the end of it?
[30:27] Just because Jesus loved him, did he
[30:28] find eternal life?
[30:30] No. The Bible also says God so loved the
[30:33] world,
[30:34] right? So you notice their message is
[30:36] but God loves us.
[30:38] Jesus loves us. Yes. But what's your
[30:40] response?
[30:42] That's the main thing.
[30:44] Now
[30:46] let's find this in the angel of God.
[30:48] We'll find the double anointing and we
[30:50] want to find who brother Brandon types
[30:52] Elijah and Elisha with. Amen. It says in
[30:56] the angel of God 1948 it says so the
[31:00] hour has come for the repeat of the
[31:02] Bible. Amen.
[31:04] Amen.
[31:05] And the fulfilling of the word.
[31:07] Yes.
[31:08] God promised that he was going to send a
[31:10] former reign
[31:11] and a latter rain.
[31:13] Amen.
[31:14] Now, we are the only people that's going
[31:15] to receive till later reign. In other
[31:17] words, a double portion.
[31:20] Amen.
[31:22] Through the church ages, they had one
[31:24] reign.
[31:26] Amen.
[31:28] They had the former rain.
[31:30] But in the latter reign was going to
[31:32] come the both the former and the latter
[31:35] rain.
[31:37] So he says here as he promised the
[31:40] former and the latter reign in the
[31:42] latter rain. In other words, a double
[31:46] portion.
[31:47] Amen.
[31:48] So remember what we're speaking this
[31:50] morning, a double portion anointing.
[31:53] So we have two reigns.
[31:56] So he says, "Like the garment of Elisha,
[32:00] when Elijah dropped it, Elisha picked it
[32:03] up and had a double portion."
[32:06] He was a type of the church and Christ.
[32:10] Christ was taken up.
[32:11] Amen.
[32:12] And the same spirit that was upon Christ
[32:15] is on the church tonight.
[32:18] It's on you this morning.
[32:20] Amen.
[32:20] Believe it.
[32:21] Amen.
[32:22] Receive it.
[32:23] Hallelujah.
[32:24] the works that I do, greater works than
[32:27] these shall he do.
[32:29] Amen.
[32:34] He said he he took the gun and struck
[32:37] the
[32:39] let the
[32:44] to be bold and fearless with the message
[32:46] of the hour.
[32:48] Amen.
[32:52] Hallelujah. We find in the manifestation
[32:54] of the spirit. Amen. 1951 he says God
[32:58] never takes his spirit from the earth.
[33:01] Right?
[33:02] God takes his man but never his spirit.
[33:05] Did you know that?
[33:06] For he took Elijah a double portion of
[33:09] Elijah's spirit come upon Elisha. Is
[33:12] that right?
[33:13] And several hunted to come out again in
[33:16] the last day.
[33:17] Amen.
[33:18] God takes his man but not his spirit.
[33:20] His spirit remains here.
[33:24] When the spirit's gone, the church is
[33:26] gone. Then
[33:29] everybody caught that.
[33:31] The only
[33:33] now go to the Jews.
[33:36] Amen.
[33:38] He says God takes his man but not his
[33:40] spirit. His spirit remains here. When
[33:42] the spirit's gone, the church is gone.
[33:45] Then there'll be no more salvation, no
[33:47] more care. Mercy is over.
[33:50] When is it gone? When the spirit leaves
[33:52] the earth.
[33:54] He says when the spirit's gone, the
[33:55] church gone. There'll be no more
[33:57] salvation, no more care. Mercy is over
[34:00] then.
[34:01] The spirit's gone.
[34:02] The Holy Spirit was an apostles is here
[34:04] tonight. The same Holy Spirit. God takes
[34:07] his man but never his spirit.
[34:10] some famous
[34:13] me
[34:14] artist. If I had his spirit and if I
[34:17] confess to have the spirit of Jesus
[34:20] Christ on us, we should do the things
[34:23] that Jesus did.
[34:25] Jesus said he can do nothing but
[34:30] message. Amen.
[34:35] Witnesses the message witnesses
[34:38] preached. Amen. 1953,
[34:42] 5th of April. Just want to read a bit
[34:44] here to show you the stages of the
[34:47] journey that led to the double portion
[34:50] anointing.
[34:52] So in paragraph 196, it says, "After the
[34:55] great prophet was taken and Elijah
[34:58] taken, Elisha took Elijah's place."
[35:03] Did we already establish that the church
[35:05] is Elisha? with that opening quote.
[35:08] The prophet said it, right?
[35:10] Elisha took Elijah's place. Oh, I can
[35:13] imagine this type of witness.
[35:15] One day he started off, he seen Elijah
[35:18] and he threw his mantle on him, blessed
[35:19] him. He killed the ox and made a
[35:21] sacrifice showing that all things of the
[35:24] world was dead behind him. That's the
[35:27] only way to come to God. Now watch, I'm
[35:28] going to give some advice. Kill
[35:30] everything behind you.
[35:32] Burn all the bridges. Amen.
[35:35] I left one uh tight rope there, Lord.
[35:38] Just in case I want to go back and
[35:40] smoke.
[35:42] Don't leave. Not even a tight rope.
[35:47] Amen.
[35:49] Don't lay that bottle up so you'll find
[35:51] it tomorrow.
[35:53] That one under your bed, get rid of it.
[35:59] Amen.
[36:01] Don't lay this other thing up so you'll
[36:02] find it tomorrow. Get rid of the thing.
[36:06] Burn it up.
[36:08] Now, I don't know what that is in your
[36:09] life,
[36:10] but stop holding on to it.
[36:14] Amen. He says, "Be a real witness. Come
[36:17] out, brother, barefooted. That's the
[36:19] way."
[36:20] Amen.
[36:21] I don't all come here next week barefoot
[36:22] until you like Shamb.
[36:25] Come out there barefooted. That's the
[36:27] way. Excuse those expressions. Excuse
[36:30] that expression. He says, "But that's
[36:32] the only way I know to say it. Things
[36:35] are going to happen around here."
[36:38] So watch now. He's typing this, right?
[36:40] They started from Gilgal. They went on
[36:42] to the school of the prophets. And I
[36:44] want you to notice when he got there to
[36:47] the school of the prophets, he said,
[36:48] "The Lord is leading me to Jordan." And
[36:50] this is the point we want to catch.
[36:52] Three stages that Elisha followed
[36:54] Elijah.
[36:56] And Elijah was the type of Christ.
[36:58] Elisha the type of the church.
[37:01] I got to go to Gilgal first. Now Gilgal
[37:04] is justification by faith.
[37:06] Amen.
[37:07] And then he said, "Now you stay here to
[37:09] the church."
[37:11] Amen. The young and the old prophet, a
[37:14] type of Christ in the church. And as he
[37:17] soul lives, I'll not stay here. I'm
[37:20] going with you.
[37:22] Amen.
[37:23] Now watch our prophet now.
[37:25] when he came with the message of
[37:27] restoration, he also took us back to
[37:29] Luther's message.
[37:32] Amen.
[37:34] But we didn't stay with the just shall
[37:36] live by faith.
[37:37] Amen.
[37:38] In fact, brother Brandon broke down
[37:40] justification even more
[37:43] more than what Luther broke it down
[37:45] when he said to be really justified is
[37:48] as though you've never done it in the
[37:50] first place. Amen. Amen.
[37:53] Now, we could have stayed at Luther's
[37:55] message,
[37:56] but we to not so
[37:59] we will not stay at Luther's message.
[38:02] Amen. That's the church. So, that's 204.
[38:05] Now, he says, "Keep your eyes on Jesus.
[38:08] Wherever he moves, go." If he goes out
[38:11] of the Methodist church, go right on
[38:13] with him. He goes out the Baptist
[38:15] church, go right on with him. He goes
[38:18] out of brand tabernacle. Go right on
[38:21] with him.
[38:22] Amen.
[38:24] Amen.
[38:26] I wonder if the absolute applies here.
[38:32] If he goes out of Brandham Tabernacle,
[38:34] go right on with him. I'll not leave
[38:37] you. No matter where mama belonged,
[38:39] where papa belonged. Do you know people
[38:41] still talk about that today? Right.
[38:44] I was talking to a guy on just yesterday
[38:46] and he was telling me he goes to the old
[38:48] apostolic church. I asked him, "Why do
[38:50] you go to the church?" He said, "Oh, I
[38:52] can't leave. You know, my mother's been
[38:53] going there all the time." You're in the
[38:55] 21st century. Spirits do not die.
[38:59] What the prophet is saying there still
[39:00] holds true today.
[39:02] Amen.
[39:02] He's saying, "Oh, my mama belong there.
[39:04] My papa belong there. Where this
[39:06] happened? I'll go with you. I'll not
[39:08] leave you."
[39:09] Hallelujah.
[39:11] So 205 he says come on and I'll follow.
[39:14] And he goes to the school of the
[39:15] prophets
[39:17] and he told him stay here. Now that's
[39:20] another stage in the journey. And some
[39:22] of the prophets said to Elisha do you
[39:24] know your master will be taken from you?
[39:26] He said I know but hold your peace.
[39:29] The brother says I like that. I'm going
[39:31] to stay right with him no matter what
[39:34] the rest of them say.
[39:35] Amen.
[39:35] Amen.
[39:36] Do you know your prophet died in a car
[39:38] accident? So what? Amen.
[39:41] John the Baptist head was cut off.
[39:44] Right.
[39:45] Peter was crucified upside down.
[39:48] Are you giving me a history lesson?
[39:50] In fact, I know more about Brother
[39:52] Brandon than you do that the car
[39:53] accident. Let me tell you more about his
[39:55] life.
[39:56] Amen.
[40:01] Amen.
[40:05] Elijah turned around and said, "Now you
[40:06] Terry here for God is sending me to
[40:09] Jordan,
[40:11] three places, justification, Gilgal,
[40:14] sanctification, the school of the
[40:16] prophet." So, brother Brandham also took
[40:18] us to Wesley's message,
[40:20] sanctification
[40:22] through the blood, but he also
[40:24] elaborated further on the blood.
[40:26] Yes.
[40:27] And he told us it's not the literal
[40:29] blood. The chemical of the blood is
[40:32] dried up.
[40:32] Amen.
[40:33] But it's the life that's in the blood
[40:35] that must come upon the believer.
[40:39] You see how he magnified their
[40:42] teachings.
[40:43] Right.
[40:44] Amen.
[40:45] Amen.
[40:47] But he's going to Jordan.
[40:49] So school of the prophet was
[40:51] sanctification and to the baptism of the
[40:53] Holy Ghost at Jordan where Jordan
[40:56] represents death.
[40:58] Amen. So he talks about Martin Luther,
[41:00] John Wesley, Pentecost down to the
[41:02] Jordan, a dying out time. So Elijah
[41:06] walked right down to the Jordan with
[41:08] Elisha. And when they got down to the
[41:10] Jordan, death, the last stage of the
[41:13] journey, old prophet reached over and
[41:15] pulled off his mantle, struck the
[41:17] waters, and the waters divided hither
[41:20] and thither, and the two walked across
[41:22] and was on dry land.
[41:25] The preachers stood afar, looked at them
[41:27] go across.
[41:28] Amen.
[41:29] Now when they got on the other side, I
[41:32] hope this soaks into the Brandham
[41:33] tabernacle plumbed down to the marrow of
[41:36] the bone.
[41:37] Not when he was at justification or the
[41:40] school of the prophet, that
[41:42] sanctification. Neither when he was on
[41:44] this side of Jordan. That's the
[41:45] Pentecostal outpouring.
[41:47] But after he crossed Jordan following
[41:50] every step of the way.
[41:52] Amen.
[41:53] Amen. You say, "I accept Jesus as my
[41:55] personal savior. I quit my bad habits,
[41:58] but come down to Jordan."
[42:00] Amen.
[42:02] Where you die out, where all the things
[42:05] of the world, all your friends and
[42:07] everything has forsaken you, keep your
[42:09] eye on him alone.
[42:11] Amen.
[42:14] Amen.
[42:16] 214 he says, "And after he crossed
[42:19] Jordan," then he said, "What will you
[42:21] that I do for you?" That's what Christ
[42:23] wants to know of the church this
[42:25] morning.
[42:26] Amen.
[42:26] And after you separated from the things
[42:28] of the world, after you become a new
[42:30] creature in Christ Jesus, after you're
[42:33] born again, filled with the Holy Ghost,
[42:35] crossed over Jordan, all the things of
[42:38] the world is dead behind you. Now ask
[42:40] what I can do for you.
[42:42] Hallelujah.
[42:43] Amen.
[42:43] I like this.
[42:45] Amen.
[42:45] He said, "That's a double portion of
[42:47] your spirit come upon me.
[42:50] a double portion cuz I want to witness
[42:52] that much more.
[42:54] Now you asked the hard thing but if you
[42:56] will see me when I go away it shall be
[43:00] when you asked what you shall have.
[43:03] Now brother you talk about a preacher
[43:05] watching the other one he was really
[43:07] watching him.
[43:08] That's what the church ought to be doing
[43:10] tonight for a double portion of the
[43:12] spirit is watching Christ.
[43:15] Amen.
[43:15] Watching the Holy Ghost the way it
[43:18] moves. Amen.
[43:19] Did everybody get what a double portion
[43:21] is?
[43:21] Amen.
[43:22] If you didn't, please read that again.
[43:24] A double portion is watching Christ.
[43:27] Amen.
[43:28] Watching the moving of the spirit.
[43:31] Amen.
[43:34] Keep your eyes on Jesus.
[43:36] 219, he says, "The trouble of it
[43:38] tonight, we got too many Christian
[43:40] people, professing Christians, got one
[43:43] eye on the world and the other one on
[43:46] the cross.
[43:48] You know what they call them
[43:50] who can look two different directions.
[43:55] So they got one eye on Christ the cross,
[43:59] the other eye on the world. Now when you
[44:01] look at a person like that, you don't
[44:03] know where they looking.
[44:05] Am I right?
[44:07] I'm clever. I look here the forehead. So
[44:09] they don't know where you're looking.
[44:14] Right. We got too many people.
[44:17] Now he says, "Oh, let your heart be
[44:20] single. Let your eye be single. Let your
[44:22] thoughts be single." Brother, that rubs
[44:24] in, but that hurts, but it's good.
[44:27] Amen.
[44:29] People want to follow their own idea.
[44:32] Amen. You give them advice, they just
[44:34] want to follow their own idea. Brother
[44:36] Brandham is giving us advice.
[44:37] Yes.
[44:38] But we still want to follow our own
[44:39] idea.
[44:41] I'll do it my way, Lord. I'll see you at
[44:43] the end.
[44:48] Right. So, Brother Brandon goes on to
[44:49] talk now and he tells you about our
[44:51] taking castor oil
[44:53] and all of these things may make it feel
[44:56] bad. The taste is bad, but the end
[44:58] result it's good for the system.
[45:01] It cleans out the system. Amen.
[45:05] So, let's go to 225.
[45:07] He says, "Oh, I want you to get this
[45:09] now." What a beautiful type. Elisha the
[45:11] young prophet then the one that was his
[45:14] witness of all the power that he had did
[45:17] all the things that Elijah had done.
[45:20] Elisha was a witness.
[45:21] Amen.
[45:22] Then he picked up the same mantle,
[45:24] throwed it over his shoulder, started
[45:26] walking down towards Jordan. A perfect
[45:28] beautiful type. Walked down to Jordan,
[45:31] pulled off the mantle, held it in his
[45:33] hand, struck the water. Way is the God
[45:36] of Elijah. and the water divided one
[45:39] side to the other.
[45:41] A type of the church following Jesus,
[45:43] seeing his power, seeing his miracles.
[45:46] Amen.
[45:47] Now, is is this a concept in the Bible?
[45:50] A double portion.
[45:52] Let's go to 1st Samuel 16 and:e 13.
[45:57] 1st Samuel 16 and verse 13. This is now
[46:00] dealing with David's anointing.
[46:03] After God had rejected Saul,
[46:06] it says there, "Then Samuel took the
[46:09] horn of oil and anointed him in the
[46:12] midst of his brethren."
[46:15] Amen.
[46:16] And the spirit of the Lord came upon
[46:18] David from that day forward. So Samuel
[46:21] rose up and went to Rama.
[46:25] So David is anointed once,
[46:27] but notice where in the midst of his
[46:30] brothers only.
[46:38] 2 Samuel 2 and verse4.
[46:41] Now David is placed. So at that one
[46:43] point he wasn't even a king when he
[46:46] first got anointed.
[46:49] He was taking care of his father's
[46:50] sheep.
[46:52] Second anointing. Now remember the
[46:54] tribes are split. He's got Judah and
[46:57] then there's Israel. He is now made king
[47:00] over Judah. So 2 Samuel 2 and verse4 and
[47:04] the men of Judah came and there they
[47:06] anointed David king over the house of
[47:10] Judah.
[47:13] So they anointed him again.
[47:18] What am I saying? If you lose your
[47:20] anointing,
[47:21] ask God to refill you.
[47:24] Amen.
[47:25] Amen.
[47:28] Don't be despondent
[47:30] if you're not having the victory. Say,
[47:32] "Lord, this is not what I want." What
[47:34] have we just been reading? Elijah asked
[47:37] Elisha, "What do you want?"
[47:38] Amen.
[47:39] God is asking you this morning, "What do
[47:41] you want?"
[47:42] Amen.
[47:43] Amen.
[47:45] That's not the end.
[47:46] You can be anointed a third time.
[47:50] 2 Samuel 5 and verse three.
[47:55] So all the elders of Israel came to the
[47:57] king of Ebron
[48:00] and King David made a league with them.
[48:02] Now watch
[48:04] is uniting the two kingdoms,
[48:07] Israel. Now
[48:11] remember, he's now going to be king of
[48:12] Jerusalem.
[48:13] Amen.
[48:15] They made a league with him in Abram
[48:17] before the Lord and they anointed King
[48:19] David over Israel.
[48:22] So one time before his brethren he was
[48:24] anointed one time before Judah and one
[48:27] time before Israel
[48:32] because David is a of Christ.
[48:34] Amen.
[48:37] And one day we shall crown him king of
[48:40] kings.
[48:40] Amen.
[48:41] And lord of lords.
[48:43] Amen.
[48:43] And every knee shall bow.
[48:45] Amen.
[48:45] And every tongue will confess
[48:48] that he is Lord.
[48:50] Amen. Amen.
[48:52] Amen.
[48:54] Amen.
[48:57] Let's turn to First Kings chapter 19 and
[48:59] verse 5. Talking about Elijah.
[49:05] Amen.
[49:06] Elijah, the original anointing, the one
[49:10] with just one portion of the anointing.
[49:13] Here he is running from Jezebel
[49:17] religion.
[49:19] 19 and verse 5 says, "And he lay and
[49:22] slept under a juniper tree, and behold,
[49:24] an angel touched him, and said, arise
[49:28] and eat. And he looked, and behold,
[49:30] there was a cake baked on the coals and
[49:33] a cruise of water at his head." And he
[49:36] did eat and drink, and laid him down
[49:39] again.
[49:40] And the angel of the Lord came again the
[49:42] second time.
[49:43] Amen.
[49:46] a double touch
[49:48] from the angel
[49:51] and touched him and said, "Arise and eat
[49:54] because the journey is too great for
[49:55] thee." And he arose and did eat and
[49:58] drink and went in the strength of that
[50:01] meat 40 days and 40 nights unto the
[50:05] mount of God.
[50:07] Amen.
[50:08] Hallelujah.
[50:09] Oh, what a blessed savior this is.
[50:12] Amen. or a double portion anointing
[50:16] given to this bride.
[50:18] Amen.
[50:18] Given to this wife.
[50:20] Amen. The only thing exercise it
[50:24] know the power that's invested within
[50:26] us.
[50:28] Amen. Let's turn to 2 Kings chapter 4.
[50:34] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[50:38] Second Kings chapter 4.
[50:53] [Music]
[50:59] Amen. Everyone got 2 Kings chapter 4.
[51:02] Let's read from verse 18.
[51:05] Now, let's follow this woman because
[51:06] this woman is under the ministry
[51:10] of the double anointing of Elisha,
[51:16] right? We'll pick it up from verse 18.
[51:19] So now you remember that this w this
[51:22] woman could not have children.
[51:24] You all remember the story?
[51:29] Okay. So what did she do? You're not
[51:31] going to read the story. You can go and
[51:32] read from verse uh chapter 4 right from
[51:35] the beginning. What did she do?
[51:39] She fed the anointing.
[51:42] Did she feed Elisha?
[51:44] The Bible says she fed Elisha.
[51:48] Yet she
[51:50] housed the anointing. She created a
[51:53] womb. So the anointing, double portion
[51:56] anointing. Now, now we're able to tell
[51:57] you that this man had a double portion
[51:59] anointing.
[52:00] Amen. Now we're getting to a point.
[52:06] Now this woman, she couldn't have a
[52:08] child. The prophet prophesies and says,
[52:10] "According to the time of life, you
[52:12] shall have a child."
[52:14] So she has a child. Why? She fed the
[52:18] word.
[52:19] Are you feeding the spirit?
[52:20] Amen.
[52:21] Are you housing the spirit?
[52:23] Amen.
[52:24] Created a room so that the spirit can
[52:26] come and dwell in your heart.
[52:27] Amen.
[52:28] Amen. Amen. So this is now where the
[52:32] child goes into the field. It's noon
[52:34] time. Amen.
[52:37] And the son strikes him,
[52:40] gets a heat stroke probably.
[52:44] And by the time the father rushes the
[52:46] boy to the mother, lays him on the lap,
[52:49] the boy dies.
[52:52] So she leaves the house.
[52:55] Okay, let's read from verse 18. And when
[52:57] the child was grown, it fell on a day
[52:59] that he went out to his father, to the
[53:02] reapers. So reapers, take our time.
[53:07] And he said unto his father, "My head,
[53:10] my head."
[53:12] And he said to the lad, "Carry him to
[53:14] his mother." So the father couldn't have
[53:16] faith.
[53:18] The mother had faith.
[53:21] And when he had taken him and brought
[53:23] him to his mother, he sat on a knees
[53:25] till noon. and then died.
[53:30] Now remember, this was the manifestation
[53:33] of Elisha's spoken word. This boy was a
[53:36] manifestation of Elisha's spoken word.
[53:40] But he was dead.
[53:42] She called out to her husband and said,
[53:44] "Send me, I pray, one of the young men
[53:46] and one of the asses that I may run to
[53:49] the man of God and come again."
[53:52] And he said, "Wherefore wil thou go to
[53:55] him today? It is neither noon, new moon
[53:58] nor Sabbath. And she said, "It shall be
[54:01] well.
[54:02] There shall come a day, sayeth the Lord,
[54:04] shall be neither night nor day."
[54:07] Amen.
[54:07] But at the evening time,
[54:10] it shall be light.
[54:11] Amen.
[54:12] Yes.
[54:14] In the evening time, it shall be light.
[54:17] The path to glory you will surely find.
[54:21] Amen. Yes.
[54:24] So she settled and asked and she said to
[54:27] the servant, "Drive and go forward.
[54:29] Slack not thy riding except I bid thee.
[54:32] Ride to the school of the prophets.
[54:39] Ride to Gilgal.
[54:41] Ride to the Lutherans
[54:44] liar. Ride to Chris."
[54:49] Now they can't go to TB Joshua.
[54:51] because the worms got him.
[54:54] You know TB Joshua is dead.
[54:58] Okay, some of you don't know who TB
[55:00] Joshua is. You think I'm talking about
[55:01] tubiculosis
[55:06] right to what's this guy? Bushiri that
[55:09] he fled South Africa.
[55:13] Bushiri was traveling like Philillip.
[55:17] Even our government couldn't find him.
[55:18] He left the country. Hey, hey, must
[55:22] delete that part. You'll catch this and
[55:23] you'll really testify now. He was like,
[55:25] Philillip,
[55:26] you mustn't give these guys ideas.
[55:31] Okay, but ride but not to the school of
[55:34] the prophets.
[55:35] Amen.
[55:36] Don't go backwards.
[55:38] We left justification,
[55:41] sanctification.
[55:42] We come up a further stage in the
[55:44] journey. We can't go backwards.
[55:47] Right. Amen. Amen. Yes. Where is she
[55:49] going? To the one where the double
[55:52] portion of the anointing.
[55:54] Hallelujah.
[55:55] And if the people of the world want to
[55:57] know present day truth, where must they
[55:59] come?
[56:00] Amen.
[56:01] Two double portion anointed people.
[56:03] Amen.
[56:04] That's right.
[56:07] Okay. So, she came. Now, watch where
[56:11] she's going. She went and came unto the
[56:14] man of God to Mount Carmel.
[56:16] Hallelujah. Amen.
[56:18] Mount Carmel showdown.
[56:20] Yes. Amen.
[56:20] What was Mount Carmel? It is where
[56:23] Elijah had turned the hearts of the
[56:26] Israel people back to the faith of their
[56:29] fathers and said if God be God, serve
[56:33] him.
[56:33] Amen.
[56:34] You remember the Mount G showdown?
[56:36] Amen. where they had the sacrifices and
[56:39] they they prayed until noon or the 400
[56:41] prophets
[56:43] and they called and he he started to
[56:45] mock them and say maybe your god is gone
[56:47] on a holiday
[56:48] right
[56:53] I don't know you know nowadays when
[56:57] people want to talk straight they don't
[56:58] want to hear even the rights of the
[56:59] message
[57:01] ah the guru shouldn't have spoken like
[57:02] that
[57:05] he never have had a better spirit and
[57:07] said it in a different way. That's what
[57:09] they would have told Elijah.
[57:12] They don't like straight speech.
[57:16] When you got a spirit of discernment and
[57:18] you're calling out that thing,
[57:21] ah bro, you should have had better
[57:22] attitude. Eh,
[57:28] you know why? They're connecting with
[57:29] that spirit
[57:31] and they secretly hurt.
[57:34] That is why if it if it doesn't affect
[57:36] you, you wouldn't bother.
[57:38] Amen.
[57:39] Why would you bother?
[57:40] But now Elijah was telling them your God
[57:43] is gone to sleep. Now he says, "You know
[57:46] what? Bring water. Come pour water on
[57:48] this offering
[57:50] and let the God who wants us by fire be
[57:52] God."
[57:53] Amen.
[57:54] That's Mount Carmel.
[57:56] He turned the hearts of Ahab and his
[57:59] people back to the one true God.
[58:02] Amen.
[58:04] Amen. So that's the first Elijah and
[58:07] that's where we get turning the hearts
[58:08] of the faith back to the fathers. That's
[58:11] the original Elijah ministry.
[58:13] He turned Israel's heart
[58:14] back to the one true God.
[58:17] Right? So we find here this is where
[58:20] she's gone. Back to Mount Carmel.
[58:22] Back to the place of restoration.
[58:24] Amen.
[58:26] Every time you find yourself slipping
[58:28] away, come back to Brandham's message.
[58:30] Amen. Come back to the place of
[58:32] restoration.
[58:33] If you're gone out on a limb, maybe
[58:35] you're following Roscoll this morning.
[58:38] Come back to the place of restoration.
[58:40] Come back to Brandon's ministry.
[58:42] Amen.
[58:43] Maybe you're following some other
[58:44] preacher, but come back to the place of
[58:47] the true restoration.
[58:49] Hallelujah.
[58:50] Amen.
[58:51] Amen.
[58:54] And it came to pass when the man of God
[58:56] saw her from a far off. Now you'll find
[58:59] further down here he's not doesn't have
[59:02] fantastic eyesight but he's seeing her
[59:04] in a vision
[59:06] that he said to Gahazi his servant
[59:08] behold yonder is the shamite run now I
[59:11] pray thee to meet her and say unto her
[59:13] is it well with thee is it well with thy
[59:15] husband is it well with the child and
[59:18] she said it is well
[59:21] the son laying dead
[59:23] but she's saying it is well
[59:25] you got TV but you're saying it's
[59:28] You got cancer. You got our problem. But
[59:30] this morning, you're testifying it is
[59:33] well.
[59:34] Thank you, Lord.
[59:35] Amen.
[59:37] Yes.
[59:39] Don't play with an Holy Ghost fil son
[59:41] and daughter of God.
[59:44] Their vision is one. Their purpose is
[59:46] one. Amen.
[59:51] And when she came to the man of God to
[59:53] the hill, she caught him by his feet.
[59:55] But Gahazi came here to thrust her away.
[59:58] You know this Gazi character,
[1:00:00] you'll find out how he ends up if you
[1:00:02] continue reading the story.
[1:00:03] That's right.
[1:00:04] Amen.
[1:00:09] And the man of God said, "Let her
[1:00:10] alone."
[1:00:13] Amen. For her soul is vexed within her,
[1:00:15] and the Lord had hid it from me and had
[1:00:18] not told me.
[1:00:19] Wow.
[1:00:21] What happened to the absolute
[1:00:25] What happened to the doctrine that
[1:00:28] everything brother Brandham said he
[1:00:31] could see it at all times?
[1:00:33] What is the Bible telling us?
[1:00:35] God can hide things from his prophet.
[1:00:38] Didn't when he prayed over that person
[1:00:41] that was in the hospital
[1:00:44] and he told the mother she's going to be
[1:00:46] well
[1:00:47] but she still died.
[1:00:50] Did God not hide it from him?
[1:00:52] No. Then he went to the Lord and said,
[1:00:54] "Lord, you owe me an answer." And then
[1:00:57] the Lord showed him that this was the
[1:00:59] right time. She was right with the Lord.
[1:01:01] I could take her away.
[1:01:03] He says, "Go ask the mother. She would
[1:01:05] have died in a drowning accident
[1:01:07] incident years ago, but she wasn't ready
[1:01:10] then."
[1:01:13] Amen. Don't you love the Bible?
[1:01:15] Amen.
[1:01:16] Amen.
[1:01:19] People don't have discernment today.
[1:01:21] They forgotten what a prophet is.
[1:01:23] That's right.
[1:01:24] A prophet is a seer.
[1:01:25] When brother Brandham is saying a modern
[1:01:28] day prophet is a preacher, he's not
[1:01:30] meaning every office's gift.
[1:01:32] That's right.
[1:01:33] Cuz I am not a prophet.
[1:01:35] Doesn't mean because I preach, brother
[1:01:36] Joshua preach, brother brother Sani
[1:01:39] that we are prophets.
[1:01:41] We know our gifting.
[1:01:43] Amen.
[1:01:44] Now people because they don't want to
[1:01:47] offend anyone,
[1:01:49] they want to thread lightly.
[1:01:53] Okay, never mind. Maybe he's a prophet.
[1:01:54] Because you know the prophet said a
[1:01:56] modern day preacher is a prophet.
[1:01:58] Go back to the Bible
[1:02:00] and see what a prophet is.
[1:02:06] Amen.
[1:02:08] Didn't God use Now I'm just trying to
[1:02:10] bring a point here. Didn't God use
[1:02:13] Moses' wife to correct him?
[1:02:15] That's right.
[1:02:16] So, what you going to say now?
[1:02:19] Moses was the absolute. No one can
[1:02:20] correct him.
[1:02:27] If she was out of order, God would have
[1:02:29] smoked her like he smoked Miriam
[1:02:32] and Aaron.
[1:02:33] Yes.
[1:02:35] Amen.
[1:02:37] So, the prophet never placed himself as
[1:02:40] deity. That's right.
[1:02:42] But people today want to place him as
[1:02:43] deity.
[1:02:44] And that is what is causing problems in
[1:02:46] the message.
[1:02:47] That's right.
[1:02:48] A prophet when he says thus sayith the
[1:02:50] Lord, you watch that.
[1:02:51] Amen.
[1:02:52] Amen.
[1:02:54] Amen. Because that will never fail.
[1:02:56] Amen.
[1:02:57] When a prophet is saying thus sayeth the
[1:03:00] Lord.
[1:03:01] That word will never fail because it's
[1:03:03] not him speaking. It's God Almighty
[1:03:06] using the prophet to speak through him.
[1:03:10] Amen. So he says, let's follow the story
[1:03:13] quickly now.
[1:03:15] As the Lord liveth, he says, so
[1:03:19] he says to Gahazi now, "G up thy loins
[1:03:22] and take my staff in thine hand and go
[1:03:25] thy way. If thy meet any man, salute him
[1:03:27] not. And if any man salute thee, answer
[1:03:30] him not again and lay my staff upon the
[1:03:33] face of the child."
[1:03:35] So what he's asking him to do, carry his
[1:03:38] staff, carry his anointing,
[1:03:42] but you can't give it to just anyone.
[1:03:44] That's right. Amen.
[1:03:46] Especially people playing around in the
[1:03:47] message.
[1:03:49] This was going to expose who Gahazi was
[1:03:52] cuz he had no faith. So he goes, he
[1:03:55] follows the word of a doubleanointed
[1:03:58] prophet
[1:04:00] and Elisha. So he says he had gaji
[1:04:02] passed on before them even like was
[1:04:05] riding super fast
[1:04:07] right and laid his stuff upon the face
[1:04:09] of the child and there was neither voice
[1:04:12] nor earing hearing.
[1:04:15] Wherefore he went again to meet him and
[1:04:17] told him saying the child is not
[1:04:20] awakened.
[1:04:25] And when Elisha came into the house, and
[1:04:27] behold, the child was dead, and laid
[1:04:29] hands upon his bed,
[1:04:35] and he went in and shut the door upon
[1:04:37] them twain, and prayed unto the Lord.
[1:04:41] And he went up. Now, where is he
[1:04:43] learning this? He went up, lay upon the
[1:04:46] child, and put his mouth upon his mouth,
[1:04:48] and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hand
[1:04:51] upon his hands, and he stretched himself
[1:04:53] upon the child, and the child
[1:04:58] waxed warm. The child started to warm,
[1:05:00] but the child is not alive yet.
[1:05:02] Yes,
[1:05:02] the body of the child is becoming warm,
[1:05:05] right? What is he doing? is bringing the
[1:05:08] manifested word which is now dead back
[1:05:11] into the image
[1:05:13] of a double anointed prophet.
[1:05:15] Amen.
[1:05:16] Anytime you find yourself dying and
[1:05:18] falling away, line yourself up back with
[1:05:21] the word.
[1:05:22] Amen.
[1:05:23] What is he doing? He's lining himself up
[1:05:26] with the boy.
[1:05:29] I don't have time to read it, but please
[1:05:30] write this down. Where did he get it? He
[1:05:33] gets it from 1 Kings 17. The original
[1:05:36] anointing Elijah did the same thing to
[1:05:38] the w to the widow's son who had died.
[1:05:41] That's right.
[1:05:42] So you'll find that in first Kings 17
[1:05:45] from verse 17. So 1 Kings 17:17. You can
[1:05:49] go and read that.
[1:05:55] Now watch. So he's just warmed the body.
[1:05:56] Then he returned and he walked into the
[1:05:59] house to and fro and went and stretched
[1:06:01] himself upon him. And the child sneezed
[1:06:06] seven times.
[1:06:09] That really didn't work.
[1:06:10] Amen.
[1:06:12] He brought a full restoration.
[1:06:17] And the child opened his eyes. And he
[1:06:21] called Gahazi and said, "Call the
[1:06:22] Shinomite." So he called her, and when
[1:06:25] she was coming unto him, he said, "Take
[1:06:27] up your son." Then she went in, fell at
[1:06:30] his feet, and bowed herself to the
[1:06:32] ground and took up a sand and went out.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:36] Now the prophet is telling us here that
[1:06:39] when he stood there,
[1:06:41] he must have remembered first
[1:06:43] Thessalonians 4.
[1:06:46] What is that?
[1:06:49] That the living will not hinder them
[1:06:51] that are dead.
[1:06:52] I'm not going to read all that. You'll
[1:06:53] find that. Amen.
[1:06:55] in the message.
[1:06:57] Well, this is some long one.
[1:07:00] In the message, it is the rising of the
[1:07:02] sun. Okay, we're going to Amen. We're
[1:07:06] going to read a quote now that talks
[1:07:08] about this double portion anointing.
[1:07:11] Amen.
[1:07:13] Everybody okay?
[1:07:15] Amen.
[1:07:15] Amen. So, let's read from it is the
[1:07:18] rising of the sun paragraph 293.
[1:07:25] Hallelujah.
[1:07:27] So, we're still focusing our thought on
[1:07:29] that double portion anointing.
[1:07:32] We know the double portion anointing is
[1:07:33] following Christ, watching the moving of
[1:07:36] the spirit. Amen.
[1:07:39] So, he says, "Yeah, I see you putting
[1:07:40] down some scriptures." He says, "Put
[1:07:42] down 1 Thessalonians 4:16.
[1:07:45] The saints, them that sleep in Christ,
[1:07:47] will God bring with him." See saints in
[1:07:50] the grave resting like Elijah was. Some
[1:07:52] like Elisha was. See, some of them be
[1:07:55] quickened. Some will be taken away. Some
[1:07:57] will be in the grave.
[1:08:00] The trumpet of God shall sound and the
[1:08:02] dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:08:04] Amen.
[1:08:05] And we which are alive and remain shall
[1:08:06] be caught up together with them to meet
[1:08:09] the Lord in the air.
[1:08:10] Amen.
[1:08:11] The quickening power on the living.
[1:08:13] That's what the point I wanted to get.
[1:08:15] the quickening power that was upon this
[1:08:17] double anointed Elisha
[1:08:20] to quicken the power on the dead boy.
[1:08:22] Amen.
[1:08:24] Now that quickening power that's upon
[1:08:26] you, you go speak to somebody who's dead
[1:08:29] in sin and trespasses.
[1:08:31] If they have a gene within them, you
[1:08:33] bring them to life.
[1:08:34] Amen.
[1:08:35] Amen. So the power of the living to
[1:08:38] quicken the power on the dead.
[1:08:43] The same quickening power of God
[1:08:45] presented in both of these prophets.
[1:08:48] Look at their names. Almost the same,
[1:08:50] right?
[1:08:51] Elisha. Elijah. See the bride and the
[1:08:54] groom. One of them Mr. Jesus and the
[1:08:57] other one is Mrs. Jesus.
[1:08:58] Amen.
[1:08:59] Is that anybody here this morning?
[1:09:02] Amen. He says, you see, almost the same.
[1:09:06] Just between is the E and the she. Yes.
[1:09:08] Right.
[1:09:10] Elijah, look how it's presented here.
[1:09:12] Now, Elish, Elijah was taken in the
[1:09:14] rapture represents the church. All
[1:09:16] right. And Elisha rested until he's
[1:09:20] probably got the names around because
[1:09:22] Elijah rested until the resurrection.
[1:09:24] And Elisha, right, is taken. But he says
[1:09:26] he's just like a bird needs two wings to
[1:09:28] balance itself. The church was
[1:09:31] represented right there in these two
[1:09:32] prophets. For we which are alive and
[1:09:35] remain to the coming of the Lord shall
[1:09:37] not hinder them which are asleep.
[1:09:39] Amen.
[1:09:39] He says both wings shall come together.
[1:09:44] Aren't you glad?
[1:09:45] What he's telling you one wing is in the
[1:09:48] sixth dimension
[1:09:49] and one wing is here on the earth.
[1:09:51] But he says in order to make the rapture
[1:09:53] we need both wings.
[1:09:55] So that one wing from the sixth
[1:09:56] dimension must come to this dimension.
[1:10:00] Then we'll be changed. And he says,
[1:10:01] "We'll have both wings together and
[1:10:04] we'll fly away."
[1:10:05] Amen.
[1:10:06] You see the living or dead, that
[1:10:08] quickening power still lives.
[1:10:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:11] Quicken to see what these things are.
[1:10:14] Quickening power of this day. Remember,
[1:10:17] we are quickened.
[1:10:19] Amen.
[1:10:20] He says, I think of Paul. What the
[1:10:22] father showed me, I held nothing back. I
[1:10:25] tell you and in the days when we've seen
[1:10:27] his quickening power upon us, he even
[1:10:30] give us quickening power to see the sick
[1:10:32] healed. We have seen quickening power
[1:10:34] walk amongst us. It was then upon them
[1:10:37] in the early days see it bring back thy
[1:10:40] vision and raise the dead to see it make
[1:10:43] the sick well.
[1:10:44] Amen.
[1:10:45] So, brother Brand goes and tells you
[1:10:47] about Donovan WZ and he tells you that
[1:10:49] he had a little lump. Amen.
[1:10:52] In 299 he says I looked at his ear
[1:10:54] turned all the way inside out and he
[1:10:57] says how are you Donovan and he said
[1:10:59] just took him by the hand like that and
[1:11:00] the cancer. I said, "Donovan, what's the
[1:11:03] matter with your hair?" And he says,
[1:11:04] "Don't know, brother Brandon. About six,
[1:11:06] seven months just keeps getting."
[1:11:09] He says, "Why?" I asked him, "Why didn't
[1:11:11] you say anything about it?" I didn't
[1:11:13] want to bother you, brother Brandon.
[1:11:16] You mean you got the mental?
[1:11:18] Sure.
[1:11:19] And you don't want to use it?
[1:11:23] Do you know what it is? Said, "I have no
[1:11:26] idea." I put my hand over on him and
[1:11:28] never said a word. Two days after that,
[1:11:30] there wasn't even a scar.
[1:11:33] Amen.
[1:11:33] Amen.
[1:11:34] What is it? That quickening power.
[1:11:36] Hallelujah.
[1:11:38] I want you to move in that anointing.
[1:11:39] Amen.
[1:11:40] That Holy Ghost anointing that's in you.
[1:11:42] Somebody tell you that something's wrong
[1:11:44] with him.
[1:11:45] Find your opportunity to pray. You don't
[1:11:46] even have to pray like make a big pious
[1:11:49] prayer.
[1:11:51] Even if it's like, "Don't worry,
[1:11:53] brother.
[1:11:54] All will be well."
[1:11:55] Make that contact.
[1:11:57] Amen. Amen.
[1:11:58] Brother Brandon said that Donovan asked
[1:12:00] him to pray for him.
[1:12:01] No.
[1:12:03] He said, "I just laid my hand on him and
[1:12:04] never said a word."
[1:12:06] Two days after that, now that's
[1:12:07] operating in another anointing.
[1:12:11] Now, if that's if I can call that the
[1:12:15] single portion of anointing on William
[1:12:17] Granner, how much more a double portion
[1:12:20] anointing right now?
[1:12:22] Thank you.
[1:12:24] Amen.
[1:12:27] Amen.
[1:12:29] Didn't brother Brandham say that missing
[1:12:30] limbs will appear.
[1:12:32] He says wait until that third pull.
[1:12:34] Amen.
[1:12:35] Amen.
[1:12:37] Hallelujah. Didn't he say they can close
[1:12:40] the heavens,
[1:12:41] call for rain.
[1:12:43] Amen.
[1:12:44] So he says the same quickening power
[1:12:46] now. So in 302 he says the quickening
[1:12:49] power, it'll quicken your mortal body.
[1:12:51] His year would have eat off. His brains
[1:12:53] would have been gone.
[1:12:55] he'd have died.
[1:12:57] But the quickening power and he says,
[1:12:59] "One day I was weary." He says, "Boy,
[1:13:02] you you better get ahead. You're 50
[1:13:04] years old. If you're going to do
[1:13:05] anything for the Lord, you better hurry
[1:13:07] up and do it now."
[1:13:09] Amen.
[1:13:09] And there that morning, the quickening
[1:13:11] power come. And he took, "Let me look at
[1:13:15] over the curtain and I seen all of you
[1:13:19] over there."
[1:13:21] Amen.
[1:13:22] Amen.
[1:13:25] Hello.
[1:13:27] Amen.
[1:13:28] Quickening power took him to that sixth
[1:13:30] dimension. And he said, "And I seen all
[1:13:33] of you over there." Uh-huh. He said,
[1:13:36] "All that you ever love and all you
[1:13:38] love, they give to you. And I seen them
[1:13:40] all over there like that." What was it?
[1:13:43] Quickness power.
[1:13:46] What brother Brandham is saying, he's
[1:13:48] talking to an audience like this.
[1:13:50] And he's saying, "I saw all of you over
[1:13:52] there."
[1:13:53] Amen. Yes.
[1:13:54] Amen.
[1:13:55] Hallelujah.
[1:13:56] You say can't be.
[1:13:58] That is not a dimension of time.
[1:14:02] That's an eternal realm.
[1:14:03] Amen.
[1:14:04] So all the theophanes of the
[1:14:06] predestinated seeds are there.
[1:14:08] Amen.
[1:14:11] Okay.
[1:14:14] He says, I seen you all over there. I
[1:14:17] seen them all over there like that. What
[1:14:19] was it? Quickening power. He says John
[1:14:21] the revelator was filled with quickening
[1:14:23] power and he seen the end from the
[1:14:25] beginning. Hia filled with quickening
[1:14:27] power. He stood up and seen the
[1:14:29] millennia quickening power and the
[1:14:31] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:14:33] dwell in you. It will quicken your
[1:14:35] mortal body. Remember the quickening
[1:14:38] power.
[1:14:39] Look what we've seen in this day. The
[1:14:41] quickening power has come to us to open
[1:14:43] up the seven seals.
[1:14:45] Amen.
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:48] Now, who is this uncircumcised
[1:14:50] Philistine that will say there's no
[1:14:53] significance to the cloud?
[1:14:56] It's for the prophet's personal
[1:14:57] testimony.
[1:15:01] What nonsense is that?
[1:15:06] Say it another way, please.
[1:15:11] Say it nice.
[1:15:15] It is most inappropriate the comment he
[1:15:18] made.
[1:15:20] You like that better?
[1:15:24] He's talking about quickening power
[1:15:26] coming down.
[1:15:27] Revelation 10,
[1:15:29] mighty angel
[1:15:31] coming to open the seals.
[1:15:33] Amen.
[1:15:35] Now, you know why they make these
[1:15:36] statements? They don't believe the
[1:15:42] They rather leave that alone.
[1:15:45] They don't believe the cloud. Quickening
[1:15:48] power come to us to open the seven
[1:15:49] seals. What was it? The intelligence of
[1:15:51] a man. No. The quickening power of God.
[1:15:54] See the quickening power for told this
[1:15:56] would take place in sers. Is this the
[1:15:58] sign of the end? The vision you saw of
[1:16:01] seven angels coming down.
[1:16:02] Right.
[1:16:04] See the quickening power of God made the
[1:16:06] world testify to it. Yes, brother. I'm
[1:16:09] not ashamed of the cloud. Right.
[1:16:11] He's saying they took the picture
[1:16:13] making the world testify to it.
[1:16:15] Amen.
[1:16:16] It's the truth. The angel of the Lord I
[1:16:18] told you was around.
[1:16:20] Amen.
[1:16:20] Amen.
[1:16:21] Amen. Yes.
[1:16:24] Oh, hallelujah. We need some men to
[1:16:26] stand in this hour.
[1:16:27] Hallelujah.
[1:16:28] Amen.
[1:16:30] Amen.
[1:16:31] It says the angel of the Lord I told you
[1:16:33] was around in a pillar of fire
[1:16:35] quickening power. Let the world testify
[1:16:38] that it's the truth. And in that they
[1:16:40] don't know what it was. We knew just
[1:16:43] look at it this way.
[1:16:45] Glory.
[1:16:46] Amen.
[1:16:47] Hallelujah.
[1:16:47] But there's no significance.
[1:16:50] Oh, I almost want to say something. But
[1:16:52] there's no significance.
[1:16:58] He says, "If you only knew, they don't
[1:17:01] know what it was. We knew. Just look
[1:17:04] this away. And it's our Lord up there."
[1:17:07] Amen.
[1:17:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:09] Wow.
[1:17:10] Amen.
[1:17:11] Revelation 10.
[1:17:14] And as we are going closer to the coming
[1:17:16] of the Lord,
[1:17:18] sayation
[1:17:20] 10, he shall descend from heaven with a
[1:17:22] shout.
[1:17:22] Amen.
[1:17:23] Going now to the voice of the archangel.
[1:17:25] So are they scoffing? But don't worry,
[1:17:28] all these tears will soon be bundled.
[1:17:30] That's right.
[1:17:33] Amen.
[1:17:37] He's not ashamed to be identified with
[1:17:39] this. Look at what he said. They don't
[1:17:40] know what it was. We knew. Just look
[1:17:42] this away. It's our Lord up there. You
[1:17:44] see, he's the one who opened those
[1:17:46] seals.
[1:17:47] Amen.
[1:17:47] So, what do they believe? Brother Vladim
[1:17:49] opened those seals.
[1:17:52] He's the one who opened those seals. He
[1:17:54] is those seals.
[1:17:55] Amen.
[1:17:56] Hallelujah.
[1:17:57] For the whole word of God is Christ. And
[1:17:59] Christ is the seals that was opened.
[1:18:01] What is the opening of the seals then?
[1:18:04] revealing the antichrist.
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:08] I like bow and arrow story man writing
[1:18:17] revealing Christ.
[1:18:18] Amen.
[1:18:19] What is he revealing? Christ's
[1:18:21] redemption plan to all seven church
[1:18:23] ages.
[1:18:24] And what is he doing? Defeating the
[1:18:26] enemy that's riding in every age.
[1:18:28] Because that horse rider thought he was
[1:18:30] killing the church, killing the church.
[1:18:32] But there was silence in heaven.
[1:18:37] Silence. Amen.
[1:18:40] You know why? Satan loves it when people
[1:18:42] fuss and fight and talk about the
[1:18:44] mysteries.
[1:18:45] You know, he can hear what you're
[1:18:46] talking. He got no revelation about the
[1:18:48] mysteries.
[1:18:50] Soon as you say something, he is
[1:18:52] listening. But he get upset when it's
[1:18:54] silence.
[1:18:58] The only one upset at the silence is
[1:19:00] Satan. Right.
[1:19:05] Listen, he's going to go more into this
[1:19:06] cloud now. And the very angels, the
[1:19:09] seven angels which represented seven
[1:19:12] church is all completed. And we couldn't
[1:19:15] even see it.
[1:19:16] They did. They took the picture.
[1:19:21] Not us. And there he is standing there,
[1:19:24] supreme judge, showing that he is alpha
[1:19:27] and omega, the beginning and the end.
[1:19:30] What identification?
[1:19:33] Hallelujah.
[1:19:34] Quickening power did that to us.
[1:19:36] Are you a part of that?
[1:19:37] Amen.
[1:19:38] Amen. I'm a part of Revelation 10.
[1:19:40] Quickening power did that to us.
[1:19:43] Quickening power let us see is coming.
[1:19:45] Quickening power snaps us from dead to
[1:19:48] life. Quickening power gives discernment
[1:19:50] to know what's wrong with you. what to
[1:19:53] do, what you have done and what you
[1:19:55] ought not to have done and what you
[1:19:57] should not have done and what you will
[1:19:59] be quickening power. All those things
[1:20:02] our Lord Jesus so full of quickening
[1:20:04] power. He was all of it. He was so full
[1:20:07] of quickening power. You destroyed this
[1:20:09] body in three days. Talk about
[1:20:11] confidence in quickening power.
[1:20:13] Amen.
[1:20:14] Amen.
[1:20:16] 314 It was prophecy, the word of God.
[1:20:19] And prophecy if it's a true word of God
[1:20:21] cannot fail. And the same prophecy and
[1:20:24] the word of God said it raised him up
[1:20:26] says we are already raised with him.
[1:20:29] Glory. Amen.
[1:20:31] We already have eternal life.
[1:20:33] Amen.
[1:20:34] We are already quickened
[1:20:36] waiting for the translation.
[1:20:39] Amen. There was the living saints that
[1:20:41] had raptured. There was Elijah standing
[1:20:44] there. There was Moses the dead saints.
[1:20:46] Both of them had quickening power.
[1:20:48] Whether one died and the other didn't,
[1:20:50] they're all there. Makes no difference.
[1:20:54] We're all going to be there.
[1:20:55] Amen.
[1:20:56] Amen. He says the same thing promised in
[1:20:58] John 14:12.
[1:21:00] Go make that note and read John 14:12
[1:21:03] cuz he doesn't read it. He says the same
[1:21:06] thing that he promised in St. John
[1:21:07] 14:12.
[1:21:09] People, you claim to have power. He says
[1:21:13] we're just like them at Mount
[1:21:14] Transfiguration. Certainly we do not
[1:21:17] claim power
[1:21:19] on Mount Transfiguration. They wasn't
[1:21:21] saying Moses see who I am. See who I am
[1:21:26] and see who I am. You know what
[1:21:28] happened?
[1:21:29] They seen Jesus glorified. That's all
[1:21:32] they wanted to see. Jesus glorified. And
[1:21:35] so is it today. Now this is where I want
[1:21:37] to tell you where my heart is and where
[1:21:39] the shirt should be. We don't try to be
[1:21:41] some big person.
[1:21:43] We don't care what the people say about
[1:21:45] us.
[1:21:46] Our name ain't nothing.
[1:21:50] It's his name.
[1:21:51] He says our name ain't nothing. It's his
[1:21:55] name.
[1:21:55] Amen.
[1:21:56] Our life it's nothing.
[1:21:57] It's his life.
[1:21:59] It's his power, not our power. There's
[1:22:02] only one thing that we love to do is see
[1:22:06] him glorified.
[1:22:07] Amen.
[1:22:08] This is where I want to close now with
[1:22:09] my opening thought. We don't worship an
[1:22:12] idea.
[1:22:13] We want to see Jesus glorified.
[1:22:15] Amen.
[1:22:16] And how can it be when he's glorified in
[1:22:19] us by his resurrection that's in us? We
[1:22:23] see him represented again as he was
[1:22:25] today. Did you see that? Our desire is
[1:22:28] not to be glorified. Our desire is not
[1:22:31] some big name.
[1:22:33] Our desire not to boast some church.
[1:22:35] Yes. or make more in the Sunday school
[1:22:39] or try to bring in octai. Push in. Offer
[1:22:43] a picnic party. Bring one cake. Cut it
[1:22:46] for your birthday.
[1:22:52] Picnic party. Bring stars. How many of
[1:22:54] you want stars? Gold star. He's saying
[1:22:57] they want buttons too.
[1:23:02] People love that
[1:23:04] even in the message. They want gold
[1:23:06] star.
[1:23:08] If you came to church, they want gold
[1:23:09] star.
[1:23:16] They want picnic party
[1:23:19] or bring stars, buttons, something else
[1:23:22] like that. That's not Son of Man
[1:23:25] revealed ministries desire.
[1:23:27] Amen.
[1:23:28] Our desire is to see him glorified.
[1:23:31] Amen. glorified not with self pride but
[1:23:35] in us our lives to prove he is alive and
[1:23:40] living in us.
[1:23:41] Amen.
[1:23:42] If I can get myself out the way so when
[1:23:45] William Brandon not even thought of
[1:23:49] and you not even thought of till we can
[1:23:52] see Jesus glorified amongst us.
[1:23:54] See that's our desire.
[1:23:58] Reason why I'm telling you this,
[1:23:59] remember I told you everyone who
[1:24:01] preaches has a aim and a desire,
[1:24:04] right?
[1:24:04] This is our aim.
[1:24:06] Brother Brandham says he didn't bring
[1:24:08] people to himself, but to have a
[1:24:10] relationship with the Lord.
[1:24:12] That's our desire as well.
[1:24:14] So if Elijah had that desire, Elisha,
[1:24:18] we got it as well.
[1:24:20] Amen. And it says, "Seeing his same
[1:24:24] vindicated methods proving in us that he
[1:24:27] is risen now from the dead."
[1:24:29] Amen.
[1:24:29] So we close with this quote now in what
[1:24:31] shall I do with Jesus called Christ
[1:24:33] preached 1963
[1:24:35] just to end with the double portion
[1:24:38] anointing. Amen.
[1:24:47] For them to get the quote so we can read
[1:24:48] it together.
[1:24:55] talking about a double portion.
[1:24:57] Amen.
[1:25:00] This is what's prophesied now. He says
[1:25:04] the dynamics, the quickening power that
[1:25:07] we've been speaking about, the dynamics
[1:25:10] of this church
[1:25:16] will be a refund unit together. The full
[1:25:19] power of the Holy Ghost Christ for
[1:25:21] hundreds of years ago will rise in the
[1:25:24] beauty of holiness
[1:25:27] to the skies. The dynamics in the Holy
[1:25:31] Ghost. Amen.
[1:25:33] How many of you desire that?
[1:25:36] Amen.
[1:25:36] Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:37] A refilling.
[1:25:38] Amen.
[1:25:38] A double portion anointing.
[1:25:41] Amen. A double portion anointing upon
[1:25:44] you, the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:46] Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:47] Amen.
[1:25:49] Don't be afraid to water the word.
[1:25:53] We told you about this woman.
[1:25:55] She fed the word. She the word.
[1:25:59] Rebecca did the same thing.
[1:26:01] They brought the camel to her.
[1:26:04] Now, she had faith to believe Eliza's
[1:26:07] message. I'm closing with this thought
[1:26:10] now. Please give me this attention.
[1:26:13] She had faith. I'm going up the pyramid
[1:26:16] now. She had faith to believe Eliza's
[1:26:19] message.
[1:26:20] Everybody agreed?
[1:26:22] So, they brought the camels to her and
[1:26:23] they said,
[1:26:25] "Fill up these camels."
[1:26:29] And she didn't take them to Sha Garage.
[1:26:33] Shall got V power,
[1:26:36] but she had another V power. She had
[1:26:39] virtue power.
[1:26:40] Glory. Amen.
[1:26:42] Is that the next step?
[1:26:44] She filled up those camels with what is
[1:26:47] virtue? Strength.
[1:26:49] She gave them back water.
[1:26:50] Amen.
[1:26:51] To get strength for the journey.
[1:26:53] Amen. Did she have patience
[1:26:55] to feed those camels?
[1:26:57] Did she have the temperance?
[1:26:59] Now you're telling me to feed these
[1:27:00] camels?
[1:27:04] Amen. Then the then the brother wants to
[1:27:07] lead wants to introduce some
[1:27:09] denominational idea about her staying a
[1:27:11] few days.
[1:27:13] So she says, "No, I got godliness."
[1:27:16] Amen.
[1:27:17] I need to go.
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:20] Didn't Abraham leave this house? Abraham
[1:27:22] was taken from the same household.
[1:27:25] Were they not idol worshippers?
[1:27:28] So she wanted because she had godliness,
[1:27:31] she didn't want to get caught up in
[1:27:33] idolatry.
[1:27:34] So she said, "Let me leave and go now."
[1:27:38] Immediately,
[1:27:42] brotherly kindness.
[1:27:45] Now she's waiting.
[1:27:47] Didn't we just read there when this body
[1:27:49] unites
[1:27:50] she goes back on the journey she's
[1:27:52] writing back the word that she fed
[1:27:55] back to Isaac and at evening time Eliza
[1:28:00] is taken off the scene
[1:28:02] right
[1:28:04] she has to take her own veil
[1:28:06] and cover her head
[1:28:08] and approach the coming headstone.
[1:28:10] Amen.
[1:28:11] Amen.
[1:28:12] Amen.
[1:28:13] Yes.
[1:28:15] approaches the coming headstone and when
[1:28:17] they unite together
[1:28:19] they can start looking for power. Now
[1:28:22] that's what brother Brandon is saying
[1:28:24] when the full power of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:25] raises up just exactly they're both
[1:28:28] united and when that uniting time could
[1:28:31] come now Abraham seed can be reproduced.
[1:28:36] Amen.
[1:28:36] Amen.
[1:28:37] And you know out of Jacob came the 12
[1:28:39] tribes of Israel.
[1:28:41] Amen. So that's a wonderful type there.
[1:28:44] Amen.
[1:28:45] Hallelujah.
[1:28:46] Amen.
[1:28:47] Let's give the Lord a good hand of
[1:28:48] praise.
[1:28:51] Amen. The double portion anointing is
[1:28:54] upon you.
[1:28:56] Amen. Don't be afraid to use the mantle.
[1:28:58] Amen.
[1:28:59] Don't be afraid to use the word.
[1:29:00] Yes. Amen.
[1:29:01] Amen. Don't say, "Oh, I'm too small or
[1:29:03] too little." No. Brother Brandon said
[1:29:06] it's not our power.
[1:29:09] And you know, in the other message, he
[1:29:10] tells you, you have authority. You don't
[1:29:12] have power, but you have the authority.
[1:29:16] Amen.
[1:29:17] But the power lays in the Holy Ghost
[1:29:18] that's in you. Let us stand together.
[1:29:20] Amen.
[1:29:22] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:29:33] It's time to worship the Lord.
[1:29:35] Hallelujah.
[1:29:36] It's time to give him praise. Amen.
