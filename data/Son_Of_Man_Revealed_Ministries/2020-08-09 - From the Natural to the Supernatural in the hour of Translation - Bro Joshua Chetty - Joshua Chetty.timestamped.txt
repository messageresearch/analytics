[39:00] amen we thank god for the unique gifts
[39:04] that he has given
[39:05] to thank god for the firefox ministry
[39:08] if you've been listening in and
[39:10] streaming in the messages that have been
[39:12] preached in the past couple
[39:14] months and weeks
[39:18] a lot of messages spoken about pressing
[39:21] into the rapture
[39:23] things that are to be the shout wing
[39:25] fought which is a message going forth
[39:27] amen
[39:30] we gotta stay in the
[39:33] continuity of god's word amen amen
[39:36] because
[39:36] god has given us gifts and god has given
[39:39] us
[39:40] his spirit and we stay in the spirit
[39:42] then
[39:43] there is a continuity of his word amen
[39:45] amen
[39:46] and we believe that we might seem like
[39:49] fanatics to some but
[39:50] why we keep speaking about the rapture
[39:53] the coming of the lord
[39:54] a body change but that's what we are
[39:56] called to win this hour
[39:58] amen that's what we are enlightened to
[40:01] and that's the faith that we are given
[40:03] in this hour
[40:04] amen remember faith is a revelation
[40:08] yes amen and you cannot speak about
[40:11] something that's not revealed to you
[40:12] amen but it's if it's revealed to you
[40:16] and that's you can speak about it it
[40:19] becomes
[40:19] open it becomes plain to you amen amen
[40:22] it becomes
[40:22] second nature to you amen so
[40:26] we're going to go into the scriptures
[40:27] this morning and we trust that god will
[40:29] bless our hearts amen
[40:31] we've got our bibles read the book of
[40:33] matthew chapter 17
[40:36] from verses 1.
[40:51] the gospel of saint matthew says and
[40:54] after six days
[40:55] jesus taketh peter james and john his
[40:58] brother
[41:00] and bringing them up into a high
[41:02] mountain apart
[41:05] and was transfigured before them
[41:10] now we know what transfigured meaning he
[41:12] was changed amen amen
[41:15] he was changed before there in other
[41:16] words
[41:18] as they were walking up the mountain
[41:20] they're walking
[41:22] look at jesus think of jesus in a
[41:23] natural form with his disciples
[41:25] walking up a mountain if you picture
[41:27] somebody walking after
[41:28] up a mountain is tiring
[41:32] your body becomes sweaty
[41:35] and the natural side looks exhausted
[41:37] amen
[41:39] but this natural side now is going to be
[41:41] changed
[41:43] right before them they've seen
[41:46] they're looking at they're walking with
[41:47] jesus
[41:49] from the natural side but how are they
[41:52] going to see something now
[41:53] something supernatural is going to take
[41:55] place amen
[41:58] something that they haven't seen in the
[42:00] natural form
[42:02] in their life or there never was a time
[42:05] when anyone had seen that
[42:11] and he was transfigured before them and
[42:14] his
[42:14] face did shine as the sun
[42:18] and his raiment was white as the light
[42:23] so they never seen something like this
[42:25] the way he changed his form he come into
[42:27] his
[42:28] glorified state amen
[42:31] and behold they appeared unto them
[42:35] moses and elijah talking with him
[42:40] here's the disciples witnessing
[42:43] firsthand
[42:45] that when those that go those that i
[42:49] believe in god go and sleep
[42:52] they don't just stay in the grave
[42:55] there's a place where they are
[42:58] and here they appearing before him
[43:00] before the disciples
[43:02] with jesus moses and elijah was alive
[43:05] all the time
[43:08] amen remember moses is typing
[43:12] those that died because moses died and
[43:14] elijah was caught up
[43:16] amen amen so they was there now in the
[43:20] theophany form
[43:22] but jesus now he he was transfigured
[43:25] into a glorified state
[43:28] now then answered peter and said unto
[43:30] jesus lord
[43:32] it is good for us to be if thou wilt let
[43:35] us make
[43:35] year three tabernacles you see the holy
[43:38] ghost wasn't given as yet
[43:40] yes yes peter now still thinking
[43:42] carnally
[43:44] he's still thinking in the natural
[43:46] because he's seeing
[43:47] moles and elijah in the state in this
[43:49] because now
[43:50] they know that they come from another
[43:53] dimension
[43:54] and they're living in the dimension and
[43:56] they're looking at them as supernatural
[43:58] beings
[44:00] and now they want to make tabernacles to
[44:02] also worship them
[44:03] see peter thinking in the carnival the
[44:06] holy ghost hasn't come down as yet
[44:08] amen
[44:12] he said
[44:15] while he yet speak he wanted to cut him
[44:18] off right there
[44:19] while he yet speak beyond a bright cloud
[44:22] overshadow them
[44:24] and be on a voice out of the cloud which
[44:27] said
[44:28] this is my beloved son
[44:31] amen amen here comes the second adam now
[44:34] amen
[44:35] the first fruits of many amen the one
[44:38] has to die in the ground
[44:39] and because he will die in the ground
[44:41] he's going to bring forth many
[44:44] other sons amen he has the first the
[44:47] son son of god amen he's gonna come
[44:51] and he's coming to adoption amen asylum
[44:54] he is approved now
[44:55] amen
[44:59] aren't we living in an adoption age amen
[45:01] amen
[45:03] while he had spoke beyond a bright cloud
[45:05] overshadowed him and beyond a voice
[45:08] out of the cloud who said this is my
[45:10] beloved son
[45:11] in whom i am well pleased
[45:16] amen
[45:24] [Music]
[45:27] and when the disciples heard it they
[45:29] fell on their face
[45:31] and we're so afraid amen i just want to
[45:34] read
[45:35] the way mark 9 puts describes him
[45:40] in mark chapter 9 it says
[45:45] 9-2 and after six days jesus take it
[45:48] with him peter
[45:49] and james and john and leaded them up
[45:51] into a high mountain
[45:53] apart by themselves and he was
[45:55] transfigured before them
[45:57] and his raymond became shining exceeding
[46:00] whiter snow so as no fuller on earth
[46:04] can wipe them amen amen so it was
[46:07] something that you can't even describe
[46:09] it in a natural
[46:11] amen there was no color on the earth or
[46:14] there was no
[46:15] filler that one that you know that here
[46:17] was material and all that
[46:18] nothing no michigan was made like it
[46:20] nothing there was no white
[46:22] or brightness like this on the earth
[46:25] in the natural there was no brightness
[46:27] like this
[46:28] amen yet the disciples what are we
[46:30] trying to say
[46:31] they're looking at jesus one part
[46:34] walking with him in the mountain in the
[46:35] natural form
[46:37] and now they're seeing his supernatural
[46:38] form and realize
[46:41] that this supernatural form had nothing
[46:43] ever experienced before amen
[46:47] amen we thank god for the reading of
[46:48] this word let's pray one more time
[46:51] father we thank you for your divine
[46:54] presence this morning

[47:04] eyes of understanding give us
[47:08] the faith to hear your word of god and
[47:11] when we hear your word let us not just
[47:12] become yours but become doers of your
[47:14] word amen
[47:15] and let your word be embedded in our
[47:17] hearts let it do something to us father
[47:20] let it transform us from within the
[47:22] father and whatever transformation takes
[47:25] place within let it be reflected on the
[47:26] outside law
[47:28] we bring this natural man under
[47:30] subjection now
[47:32] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[47:35] amen god bless you may take your seat
[47:41] tell our bible also to the
[47:47] book of saint peter chapter two
[48:04] say peter chapter 2 reading from
[48:10] sorry ii peter chapter 1 verse 14.
[48:13] second peter chapter 1 verse 14.
[48:22] knowing that shortly yes peter speaking
[48:24] now remember peter was the one who
[48:26] witnessed
[48:29] the transfiguration of jesus right is he
[48:31] speaking now
[48:33] knowing that shortly i must put off
[48:37] this my tabernacle
[48:41] now those that understand
[48:46] the message language when the bible has
[48:48] revealed to you we understand when the
[48:49] bible is talking about the tabernacle
[48:51] he's talking about his body right
[48:56] so he's saying knowing that shortly
[48:59] i must put up this my echo so he come to
[49:02] your realization
[49:04] their day on mount transfiguration
[49:07] that what they knew about life was only
[49:10] temporal
[49:13] right and no doubt
[49:16] they've seen this they've seen the
[49:19] supernatural
[49:20] they've seen the first pool the first
[49:22] two pulls done
[49:24] they've seen jesus heal the multitudes
[49:29] they saw jesus feed them they saw the
[49:33] supernatural they saw what happened to
[49:34] the fishes
[49:35] amen but now
[49:38] and they've seen they were in the bible
[49:41] we had
[49:42] people raised from the dead amen but
[49:44] they all died again
[49:46] amen but now
[49:50] peter has come to the knowledge because
[49:52] now this is after pentecost now
[49:54] after he has the holy ghost and it's
[49:57] revealed to him
[49:58] that the life that he wants you is only
[50:00] a temporal life
[50:03] everything that he ever knew about his
[50:04] life until the holy ghost comes down was
[50:07] all temporal
[50:08] amen and what jesus
[50:11] showed him before he goes in the before
[50:13] jesus dies
[50:15] goes to the crucifixion jesus showed him
[50:17] what
[50:18] life is going to be like in that
[50:21] glorified form you can never die
[50:23] amen that's why in the book of
[50:26] revelation
[50:27] i am he which liveth and was dead and
[50:29] he's alive forevermore
[50:32] amen he didn't say i'm the one who was
[50:35] dead
[50:35] and live it now he's saying i'm i am he
[50:38] that limits
[50:39] amen and was dead and he's alive forever
[50:42] more amen
[50:44] amen so he was showing them in my
[50:46] transfiguration
[50:47] what what is going to be attained
[50:51] amen in other words there was like
[50:54] god playing out a drama or what you are
[50:56] going to attain
[50:57] amen that through jesus because jesus
[51:01] when he transfigured right there that
[51:02] glorified he could have went straight to
[51:04] heaven
[51:04] amen but he's come for a purpose
[51:08] amen god had to reconcile
[51:12] mad back to him because it was a promise
[51:16] that was made in the garden of eden
[51:18] by the seed of the woman amen
[51:22] now when when mary being a natural type
[51:26] a natural woman
[51:29] but the prophecy was already spoken of
[51:32] 800 years
[51:33] before gabriel even encountered visit
[51:36] her
[51:38] that a virgin shall conceive
[51:43] a natural woman going to have
[51:46] a supernatural experience amen
[51:51] but when gabriel visits her
[51:55] if she doesn't say to gabriel i'm
[51:57] receiving your word now
[51:59] beat unto me according to thy word
[52:02] yes mary is standing there on earth in
[52:04] the natural
[52:05] in our dimension on earth in a natural
[52:08] form
[52:10] but one comes from another dimension
[52:12] amen
[52:13] amen one passes the time barrier
[52:18] comes from another dimension comes and
[52:21] visit her
[52:22] and when he gives her the word of what's
[52:25] going to happen to her
[52:27] what happened she receives that word she
[52:30] said
[52:30] be unto me according to thy word amen
[52:34] and then what happened when she receives
[52:35] one from that dimension a message from
[52:37] that dimension
[52:39] which is pronounced in her dimension
[52:41] what happens
[52:42] something supernatural takes place in
[52:44] willingness amen
[52:46] amen the holy ghost overshadows her
[52:49] and she conceives of the holy one amen
[52:54] speaking about what happened in this day
[52:56] in 1963 amen
[52:58] a mighty angel comes down from heaven
[53:00] amen amen what happened with the shouts
[53:03] amen that was the message going forth
[53:05] amen
[53:06] amen and you're the bride the church was
[53:09] like a type of mary
[53:10] said be done to me according to thy word
[53:14] amen one come from another dimension
[53:16] amen
[53:17] come into your dimension and what
[53:19] happened you in the natural have
[53:21] received it with your natural senses
[53:23] because you began to hear it but what
[53:25] happened when you began to hear
[53:26] it something deep down within you deep
[53:29] down in the soul what was that
[53:31] it was faith amen it was faith that
[53:34] caught the revelation
[53:35] it was faith that connected to it amen
[53:38] and there was a connection
[53:42] and when there was that connection what
[53:43] happened you began to conceive
[53:45] amen you began to receive amen
[53:48] a word from another dimension amen
[53:52] and the very word that you received is
[53:54] going to do a work from within you amen
[53:57] amen daily daily you are dying
[54:00] naturally amen daily the natural man is
[54:03] dying
[54:05] but something is happening within you
[54:07] something is being renewed
[54:09] every day something is growing within
[54:11] you
[54:12] amen the supernatural he's growing
[54:15] within you amen
[54:17] amen and one of these days this natural
[54:19] is gonna put off
[54:20] and the supernatural is gonna take over
[54:22] amen
[54:25] and that's why nobody if you have a true
[54:29] connection with him if this message has
[54:32] been totally vindicated to you
[54:34] personally
[54:36] nobody no false prophets yes
[54:39] no deceiving theologian no
[54:42] intellectual person can come
[54:45] and deceive you from truth amen amen
[54:48] because the bible said the truth shall
[54:51] set you
[54:52] free amen and he said to whom the son of
[54:54] man set free
[54:56] is free indeed because when you receive
[54:59] this word
[55:00] that comes from another dimension what
[55:01] happened it was your year of jubilee
[55:04] amen you were the slave all along and
[55:06] you were slaving in his flesh
[55:08] in his past house but when he was being
[55:11] deceived
[55:12] from in satan's eden you was being
[55:15] deceived by signs
[55:16] you have been deceived by your
[55:17] educational system you are being
[55:19] deceived by the modern civilization
[55:22] but when one comes from another
[55:24] dimension and connects to you
[55:26] what happened the jubilee trump would
[55:27] sound it
[55:29] amen and you put everything down he said
[55:32] lay down this man amen you been you
[55:36] began to be convicted
[55:38] and you you something told you this is
[55:40] the truth you begin to repent of all
[55:42] your sins amen
[55:43] amen and then you come to justification
[55:46] amen
[55:46] amen and then by faith because you
[55:49] believed it
[55:50] you was justified
[55:53] amen and then what happened
[55:57] you went into that water amen you went
[56:00] into the water grave to watery grave
[56:02] because
[56:02] you wanted to die to that old man amen
[56:06] you wanted to die to that old man
[56:10] and what happened that whole out of
[56:12] stone
[56:14] amen began to become a heart of flesh
[56:19] and you began to be sanctified amen
[56:22] what happened there your own nature
[56:24] began to change
[56:26] yes amen your taste buds began to change
[56:28] you began to put on
[56:29] a holy man's taste you began to put on a
[56:32] thinking man's filter
[56:35] your desire for the whole things of the
[56:37] world began to change
[56:39] amen and now you no longer desire those
[56:43] things
[56:44] because why you are becoming sanctified
[56:49] and the purpose of you being sanctified
[56:52] is because he wants to put his spirit in
[56:56] you and his spirit is not a fully spirit
[57:00] amen his spirit is a holy spirit amen
[57:04] so you come to the process of
[57:05] sanctification
[57:08] and then when you are sanctified it
[57:12] becomes a place now
[57:13] for the holy spirit to come and dwell in
[57:16] you amen
[57:16] and when he comes and dwell in you he
[57:18] wants to come
[57:19] in every door in your hearts
[57:23] he wants you to open out all those girls
[57:26] all those hidden compartments because
[57:29] he just come he cannot just come and
[57:31] dwell in you he wants to come and have
[57:33] lordship of your life
[57:35] he wants to have leadership of your life
[57:38] amen that's what the bible says be not
[57:41] conformed any longer
[57:43] amen to the pattern of this world amen
[57:45] but be
[57:46] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[57:50] because there's a transformation taking
[57:52] place within you
[57:54] amen and when the transformation
[57:58] is taking place within you what happens
[58:01] the natural man began to put begins to
[58:04] project
[58:05] what is taking place within you the
[58:07] natural man becomes a reflector
[58:10] of the image of what's within you amen
[58:14] amen what am i talking about
[58:18] your nature your nature change the
[58:22] natural man is showing you now
[58:25] the things that i used to desire there's
[58:27] something testing
[58:28] for something else there's another
[58:30] testing within me amen
[58:32] that thirsting wants to receive of
[58:35] eternal life
[58:37] that thirst that thirsting within you
[58:40] cannot receive of this natural life
[58:42] because it's temporary it began to it
[58:46] becomes to be revealed within you that
[58:48] all that you are receiving is bringing
[58:50] forth depth
[58:51] amen amen every day when you look
[58:54] at the mirror you realize that your your
[58:56] body this body is decaying
[58:58] no matter how much you try to camouflage
[59:00] it with all the natural things that
[59:03] they've got
[59:04] with all the products that they have you
[59:06] cannot deceive yourself
[59:08] from within you the natural man the
[59:09] organs are all fading out
[59:13] but there's a spirit man that's
[59:16] growing amen there's a spirit man that
[59:20] is renewed daily
[59:22] amen so we find that peter is speaking
[59:25] here now he says
[59:31] knowing that shortly i must put up this
[59:33] my tabernacle
[59:34] even as our lord jesus christ and showed
[59:36] me
[59:38] what he's talking about now jesus showed
[59:41] him
[59:43] that when that tabernacle is put off
[59:44] there's another tabernacle
[59:46] amen amen he showed him
[59:51] that you're gonna change from a natural
[59:53] man to a glory of you to come to a
[59:55] glorified state that is the end result
[59:57] amen your end result of what you're
[59:59] going to attain peter
[1:00:00] is to become to a glorified state
[1:00:05] and we've come to the knowledge of the
[1:00:06] truth in this hour
[1:00:09] and we realize that we are not here by
[1:00:12] some form of religion
[1:00:14] because religion is man just trying to
[1:00:16] satisfy his conscience
[1:00:17] and i don't think anyone here this
[1:00:19] morning he's come here to satisfy
[1:00:21] his conscience because if you do that
[1:00:23] then you're wasting your time
[1:00:26] amen and i don't think that
[1:00:29] any one of you this morning want to say
[1:00:32] no i just lead a good christian life
[1:00:35] i don't dress up like the world i live a
[1:00:38] holy clean decent life
[1:00:40] if that is all it takes then you're
[1:00:41] wasting your time
[1:00:43] because religion can produce that
[1:00:46] religious
[1:00:46] religion can produce a people that is
[1:00:48] pious
[1:00:49] religion can produce a person with
[1:00:52] virtues
[1:00:53] religion can produce a lady that dresses
[1:00:56] up right
[1:00:57] amen it's beyond that
[1:01:00] those things you do because you have a
[1:01:01] revelation of who you are
[1:01:04] those things you do because you realize
[1:01:06] that the body is a tabernacle of the
[1:01:08] most high god amen amen
[1:01:11] it's beyond religion that you are here
[1:01:13] this morning
[1:01:14] you have a revelation that you are to
[1:01:17] attain something
[1:01:20] that we are not here to just establish
[1:01:22] church
[1:01:23] amen but we are part of a mystical body
[1:01:26] amen
[1:01:27] amen because we are connected to the
[1:01:29] headstone
[1:01:30] which has come down in this day and it
[1:01:32] was a uniting time
[1:01:34] amen of people called out from every
[1:01:36] organization
[1:01:37] from every system from every part of the
[1:01:39] world of people call out to be part of
[1:01:41] this body
[1:01:42] amen and under one spirit we all baptize
[1:01:45] into this body
[1:01:46] amen you see your water baptism may
[1:01:48] place you in a fellowship
[1:01:49] but your holy ghost baptism places you
[1:01:52] in the body
[1:01:52] and that's why if you've got the holy
[1:01:54] ghost baptism you will only find
[1:01:56] yourself as
[1:01:57] a particular group of people who've got
[1:02:00] something
[1:02:01] different from everyone else because you
[1:02:03] would identify yourself to an entire
[1:02:04] body amen i'm not talking about a body
[1:02:07] of denominational
[1:02:08] systems or a nominal church christian
[1:02:10] i'm talking about the body of christ
[1:02:12] amen amen amen you'll identify yourself
[1:02:15] as the entire body of christ in its
[1:02:18] entirety
[1:02:20] every church will be sovereign but i'm
[1:02:22] talking about a baptism placement
[1:02:25] where you are positionally placed in
[1:02:26] that body
[1:02:28] imagine to know your part in the body
[1:02:30] because until you come to a realization
[1:02:32] you're only living under a partial
[1:02:34] realization and you will never produce
[1:02:36] nothing because you're not connected to
[1:02:40] their body
[1:02:41] and you're not fulfilling god's purpose
[1:02:43] for you
[1:02:44] because god has a purpose for each of us
[1:02:47] amen amen
[1:02:49] that is why we are moving from the
[1:02:51] natural to the supernatural that's what
[1:02:53] we're speaking on this morning
[1:02:55] amen from the natural to the
[1:02:57] supernatural
[1:02:58] in the hour of translation amen amen
[1:03:01] we believe we're in our translation this
[1:03:03] morning amen amen all the signs all
[1:03:05] around us
[1:03:08] we can see that we're living in perilous
[1:03:09] times on the earth
[1:03:12] every nation is shaken
[1:03:16] amen i'll read that i'll read a quote to
[1:03:19] you now
[1:03:25] the problem of god says
[1:03:30] it's scared every nation is scared
[1:03:33] might as well like the white house you
[1:03:36] know what
[1:03:36] you know what's america like right now
[1:03:39] listen to what he says
[1:03:40] like a little boy in the nighttime
[1:03:42] passing a graveyard
[1:03:44] whistling in the dark can your spiritual
[1:03:46] years catch this
[1:03:49] acting like we big and brave
[1:03:54] but all behind everybody's shaking in
[1:03:56] their boots
[1:03:58] it's uncertain right our nation's treaty
[1:04:02] of peace and everything else is
[1:04:03] just shaking the united nations shaking
[1:04:06] everything shaking the bible said it
[1:04:10] would
[1:04:11] don't we have a virus that comes on the
[1:04:14] earth and leave
[1:04:15] every nation shaking amen
[1:04:18] every nation everyone no one can say
[1:04:21] they haven't been touched
[1:04:22] every industry has been touched amen
[1:04:29] but we receive a kingdom
[1:04:32] cannot be shook amen everything shaken
[1:04:36] is uncertain
[1:04:38] the season's uncertain you don't know
[1:04:40] whether to plant your crop
[1:04:42] if you haven't got some kind of
[1:04:44] irrigation the season's
[1:04:45] so irregular frost rain anything else
[1:04:49] can happen right in the summertime
[1:04:50] and you've seen that there's famine for
[1:04:52] food
[1:04:54] we don't have crops props are getting
[1:04:56] destroyed with locusts and things like
[1:04:58] that
[1:04:58] yes amen so we think that everything is
[1:05:01] shaken
[1:05:03] and no one is certain but in hour of
[1:05:05] uncertainty
[1:05:06] what what are you saying to you be
[1:05:08] certain of god amen
[1:05:10] amen if there's anything you can be
[1:05:12] certain about is
[1:05:14] be certain of god amen
[1:05:18] and that's why jesus was showing peter
[1:05:21] he showed to you
[1:05:23] that this is an example of what's going
[1:05:25] to happen
[1:05:26] he's going to be the first born of many
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:31] but peter to come into this into this
[1:05:34] stage
[1:05:36] you have to go through the process amen
[1:05:39] remember we want a body change right
[1:05:40] this is our translation
[1:05:43] how are we going to go up there into the
[1:05:45] other dimension
[1:05:47] in this natural body we can't do it
[1:05:53] that is why nobody can understand the
[1:05:55] mystery of the rapture
[1:05:58] if they haven't received god's word in
[1:06:00] this hour amen
[1:06:06] mary would not ever conceived if she
[1:06:08] didn't accept gabriel's word
[1:06:10] she had to receive gabriel's word
[1:06:14] coming from another dimension that
[1:06:17] something supernatural was going to take
[1:06:18] place to where that never happened
[1:06:22] in the history of mankind amen a virgin
[1:06:26] conceived of that holy one
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:32] so you have received in this hour you
[1:06:36] had to accept
[1:06:37] that one came down in this day amen
[1:06:43] from another dimension and you receive
[1:06:45] that word
[1:06:46] and that word now only that word
[1:06:52] under that seventh seal is gonna give
[1:06:54] you a rapturing faith
[1:06:55] amen because you're not going to have a
[1:06:58] change for the body
[1:06:59] no no matter how holy you are no matter
[1:07:02] how much you fast and pray
[1:07:03] no matter how much you attend church if
[1:07:06] that word is not
[1:07:06] revealed to you how are you going to
[1:07:09] have faith for the rapture amen
[1:07:12] peter james and john
[1:07:16] you've been seeing me healing the
[1:07:17] multitudes you see me turning what into
[1:07:20] wine
[1:07:21] you see me feeding the thousands but now
[1:07:26] i want to show you something peter james
[1:07:28] and john
[1:07:29] that was healing naturally those people
[1:07:32] that was raised from the dead still have
[1:07:34] to die
[1:07:35] but peter james and john there's
[1:07:38] something more to that
[1:07:40] you're going to need a body change amen
[1:07:43] you need a body change to get on the
[1:07:44] other side
[1:07:49] remember something
[1:07:53] those theories can only come down in
[1:07:56] this dimension
[1:07:57] when christ allows them to come down and
[1:07:59] pick up their bodies in the grave
[1:08:03] that if you when those theories are
[1:08:05] coming down
[1:08:06] this body is already has to be aligned
[1:08:08] with it
[1:08:09] he has to become one with it amen he has
[1:08:12] to dovetail with his body
[1:08:14] you have to become a perfect foot amen
[1:08:18] he has to doubt here with his body
[1:08:25] this natural body cannot go there
[1:08:29] dare to come here
[1:08:33] what the prophet was lying there going
[1:08:34] beyond the curtain of time lying in the
[1:08:36] bed
[1:08:36] he had to come out of his body and the
[1:08:39] body and he had to look at the body
[1:08:40] lying there and then he went in beyond
[1:08:42] the curtain of time
[1:08:44] and he went into the other body he
[1:08:46] stepped into the other body
[1:08:48] but there's going to come a time when
[1:08:52] those bodies have to come from that
[1:08:54] dimension to this dimension
[1:08:56] and transform this body into a glorified
[1:08:58] body amen
[1:08:59] amen so the prophet had then experienced
[1:09:02] where
[1:09:03] an out-of-body experience but it was
[1:09:06] another time when he's walking through
[1:09:09] amen look at this because remember now
[1:09:11] there should be an example of another
[1:09:13] son in this day
[1:09:16] remember he had an out of a body
[1:09:17] experience going through that i
[1:09:19] mentioned
[1:09:20] which is typing now the sleeping saints
[1:09:23] amen
[1:09:24] leaving this dimension and going out to
[1:09:25] another grain to the other body
[1:09:27] putting off this earthly tabernacle and
[1:09:29] putting off the other tabernacle
[1:09:32] but there was another time where he's
[1:09:33] walking while walking
[1:09:35] he has a body change amen amen while
[1:09:38] walking
[1:09:38] he has a body chain you never leave the
[1:09:40] body while walking here's the prophet
[1:09:42] having this experience
[1:09:44] because there to be a type in this day
[1:09:46] amen
[1:09:47] there to be one example in this day
[1:09:53] he had to have a body experience with
[1:09:54] change where you could see the deer
[1:09:56] right there
[1:09:57] and the deer could almost eat off his
[1:09:58] arm and everything changed the whole
[1:10:00] dimension changed
[1:10:01] he just entered into a dimension it
[1:10:04] didn't happen
[1:10:05] he actually it couldn't happen on earth
[1:10:07] he had to step into a dimension
[1:10:10] amen so here's the prophet that has the
[1:10:12] same experience
[1:10:13] and here's jesus now with his disciples
[1:10:17] before them while they're looking at him
[1:10:19] while they're watching him in the
[1:10:20] natural
[1:10:20] suddenly he's transfigured before them
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:25] showing them y'all are going to attain
[1:10:27] this
[1:10:28] and in this body you can never die amen
[1:10:31] in this body you can never get old in
[1:10:34] this body there'll be no more sickness
[1:10:37] yes you're gonna go around peter
[1:10:40] you're gonna go around preaching the
[1:10:41] gospel you're gonna go around
[1:10:43] under the first two pools under the
[1:10:46] first pool and
[1:10:47] healing people and so forth but
[1:10:50] more than just healing them you are
[1:10:51] going to give them the gospel
[1:10:53] because the gospel is going to do a
[1:10:55] transformation in their lives
[1:10:57] and the gospel when they go down to all
[1:10:59] those six ages
[1:11:00] when they go down in the grave there's
[1:11:02] going to be one day
[1:11:04] amen the very word that they received
[1:11:06] amen there's going to be a resurrection
[1:11:08] and those graves are going to open up
[1:11:10] those graves have to give up those
[1:11:11] bodies
[1:11:12] and those theophony bodies are gonna
[1:11:14] dovetail with those natural bodies
[1:11:17] amen it's gonna change from the
[1:11:19] corruption to the incorruption
[1:11:21] amen but we are given another promise in
[1:11:24] this hour
[1:11:26] hallelujah we are given another promise
[1:11:29] where the mortals
[1:11:30] is going to put on immortality amen amen
[1:11:34] we are given another promise that some
[1:11:35] of you won't see that amen
[1:11:40] amen in the hour of translation some of
[1:11:43] you are going to move from the natural
[1:11:44] to the supernatural
[1:11:46] amen from the natural from the
[1:11:50] from the earthly body to the heavenly
[1:11:52] body
[1:11:56] so he says here
[1:12:01] moreover i will endeavor that ye may be
[1:12:04] able after my decease
[1:12:06] to have these things always in
[1:12:08] remembrance
[1:12:10] so he knows that the body must die
[1:12:14] but because it's revealed to him that
[1:12:16] life doesn't end against
[1:12:18] amen no matter what
[1:12:21] going to happen to this body he knows
[1:12:24] that he has to
[1:12:25] get perfect he has to take up his cross
[1:12:27] and follow jesus
[1:12:28] and if christ was persecuted he's also
[1:12:30] going to get persecuted
[1:12:32] he knows that
[1:12:35] but no matter what you do to that body
[1:12:37] he has a revelation
[1:12:39] and he's willing to give his life for it
[1:12:41] why would he do that
[1:12:42] why would he be willing to give their
[1:12:44] life for christ because they had a
[1:12:46] revelation
[1:12:48] that this life that they know is not
[1:12:49] life amen
[1:12:51] amen you know we know people we are
[1:12:54] persecuted in this hour
[1:12:57] you are persecuted for following the
[1:12:59] true word in this hour
[1:13:01] you are persecuted in the fact that they
[1:13:02] call you an oddball they say but you're
[1:13:04] talking about
[1:13:05] going away you're talking about being a
[1:13:08] citizen of heaven
[1:13:10] you're talking about leaving the earth
[1:13:12] but this is life we have to live here
[1:13:15] you have to do progress and do all these
[1:13:17] things
[1:13:18] if you do all those things what are the
[1:13:20] revelation of who you are
[1:13:22] where you're coming from and where
[1:13:23] you're going then you're wasting your
[1:13:24] time
[1:13:26] yes there have to there are things that
[1:13:28] we have to do in the natural to get by
[1:13:29] in this life
[1:13:31] but is that that is not all that is not
[1:13:34] our purpose
[1:13:35] amen we are called for a purpose in this
[1:13:38] hour
[1:13:39] we are called to have a body change in
[1:13:41] this hour amen we are called
[1:13:43] to be that people that will have a enoch
[1:13:45] work amen
[1:13:47] we are walking into translation in this
[1:13:48] hour amen
[1:13:50] amen enoch was that seven from adam and
[1:13:52] he was the one caught up
[1:13:54] he was translated because he walked with
[1:13:56] god amen
[1:13:57] and how's your walk with god this
[1:13:59] morning amen your work with god is when
[1:14:01] you recognize your day and your message
[1:14:03] when you recognize god in this hour when
[1:14:05] you recognize where god is in his people
[1:14:07] in this hour
[1:14:08] amen amen god is always on the move
[1:14:12] and you got to recognize god in the form
[1:14:14] that he is in and where is he now
[1:14:16] he's in his bride amen god
[1:14:19] bailed in human flesh again in a many
[1:14:22] member body
[1:14:23] doing the greater works amen
[1:14:27] sometimes you think you you're trusting
[1:14:31] god for something
[1:14:32] and you think of every natural way first
[1:14:36] to achieve what you want
[1:14:39] because we are so we have this
[1:14:41] conception so much of the physical realm
[1:14:45] we invest so much in the physical realm
[1:14:48] that we spend little time investing in
[1:14:51] the spiritual realm
[1:14:53] and that's why we see so less of the
[1:14:54] supernatural
[1:14:56] if you want to experience the
[1:14:57] supernatural you gotta tap in that realm
[1:15:00] you gotta spend time connected to him
[1:15:03] remember he's a supernatural god
[1:15:05] amen he's a messiah how did we get this
[1:15:07] message
[1:15:09] from another dimension it came
[1:15:12] supernaturally to us
[1:15:13] how did you receive this message you
[1:15:15] read the book like everyone else did you
[1:15:17] read it with intellect
[1:15:19] it was an intellect that gave me the
[1:15:20] message the same angel of god
[1:15:22] that came and revealed it to the prophet
[1:15:24] he's the same angel and god came and
[1:15:26] whispered into your ears
[1:15:28] amen he came and opened your
[1:15:29] understanding amen he come to give you
[1:15:31] skill and understanding in his hour
[1:15:33] amen he comes to reveal himself
[1:15:35] personally to you
[1:15:37] it was supernaturally revealed to you so
[1:15:40] if you received a supernatural word
[1:15:42] and you connected to him then the
[1:15:44] supernatural should be something part of
[1:15:46] our life
[1:15:47] when you become so much with him
[1:15:50] eventually you become normally
[1:15:51] become part of your life amen you're
[1:15:54] saying but that was in the days of the
[1:15:55] prophet
[1:15:56] no this is your power amen this
[1:15:59] the prophet had in that measure now is
[1:16:02] the time amongst the many member body to
[1:16:03] receive it amen
[1:16:05] the prophet added in that time because
[1:16:08] why god had to reveal himself
[1:16:09] to a son of man ministry but now he's
[1:16:12] revealing himself to the bride
[1:16:14] because she under a messenger receives
[1:16:17] that word
[1:16:18] and she becomes the final voice in a day
[1:16:21] amen she becomes the final voice in this
[1:16:24] hour
[1:16:28] how does she become a final voice she
[1:16:30] had to receive something
[1:16:32] amen she has to receive a supernatural
[1:16:35] word
[1:16:37] amen and each time you're connected with
[1:16:39] him he's taking you from the natural to
[1:16:41] the supernatural amen
[1:16:43] that is why now after the holy ghost
[1:16:45] come down and when peter all experienced
[1:16:46] this
[1:16:47] and that is why they could walk now
[1:16:48] they're looking at a man with a natural
[1:16:50] eyes
[1:16:51] with a natural five senses they're
[1:16:52] looking at the man there in the gate
[1:16:54] beautiful
[1:16:54] and he's lying there down there and he's
[1:16:57] begging they must have seen him every
[1:16:59] other day
[1:17:00] but now the holy ghost is upon them amen
[1:17:04] now they're connected to the
[1:17:05] supernatural amen
[1:17:07] this man is asking for harm amen he's
[1:17:09] asking for something they can give
[1:17:11] naturally to him
[1:17:12] because he wants something natural
[1:17:16] he he doesn't have a living because he
[1:17:18] is in the state
[1:17:22] but they looked at him they fixed their
[1:17:24] eyes on him
[1:17:25] now they're not looking at him now would
[1:17:27] naturalize because if they look at him
[1:17:29] with a naturalizer look at him in his
[1:17:30] condition
[1:17:31] that he's in a disabled condition and
[1:17:33] they cannot help him
[1:17:34] no they looked at him now with spiritual
[1:17:37] eyes
[1:17:38] amen they don't look at a natural man
[1:17:41] they look at it supernaturally
[1:17:42] and they said silver and gold which is
[1:17:44] the natural things
[1:17:46] have we none but such as we have which
[1:17:48] is the supernatural
[1:17:49] we give unto you in the name of jesus
[1:17:51] christ rise up and walk
[1:17:53] amen what happened they were so
[1:17:55] connected now to the supernatural they
[1:17:57] are giving the supernatural
[1:17:59] amen are we connected today with the
[1:18:03] supernatural
[1:18:05] amen if we can't trust god for these
[1:18:07] little things
[1:18:09] if we can't trust god for natural i mean
[1:18:11] for
[1:18:12] small little things
[1:18:15] how are we going to have capturing faith
[1:18:18] amen
[1:18:19] rapturing fate lies in that word you
[1:18:22] must eat of that word
[1:18:23] john began to eat of that book man john
[1:18:26] was typing the bride
[1:18:28] you have to eat of that word i'm not
[1:18:30] talking about eating like
[1:18:31] reading with just human understanding
[1:18:33] i'm not talking about human
[1:18:34] understanding no no no
[1:18:36] we are beyond that now amen
[1:18:39] reading and trying to understand its
[1:18:41] meaning in the grammar and everything
[1:18:43] you're gonna go wrong
[1:18:45] because to understand scripture from
[1:18:48] genesis to revelation
[1:18:49] you'll find that sometimes scripture has
[1:18:51] come for meaning you've got to
[1:18:53] understand scripture in the way he's
[1:18:54] revealing it
[1:18:56] or you can look at the scripture for
[1:18:57] many times but until the holy ghost
[1:18:59] comes and reveals amen
[1:19:01] amen so he says
[1:19:08] for we have not followed cunningly
[1:19:10] devised
[1:19:11] fables you know what that means
[1:19:16] what is device favor something that was
[1:19:18] used
[1:19:19] in the dark ages to lure the people
[1:19:24] where they will speak about some
[1:19:26] phenomenal thing
[1:19:27] or something like that they'll be buying
[1:19:29] something that was like made like a
[1:19:30] supernatural
[1:19:31] which called mythology right they make a
[1:19:34] myth
[1:19:35] and then make it like a real thing
[1:19:36] they'll devise it for example they'll
[1:19:38] speak of a miracle that happened but it
[1:19:40] never happened
[1:19:41] they'll devise it they'll speak about
[1:19:43] these things
[1:19:44] they'll speak about doctrine they'll
[1:19:46] devise their business bible scholarly
[1:19:48] colleges and they'll make these
[1:19:49] doctrines and they receive the people
[1:19:54] but he says when we made known unto you
[1:19:57] the power
[1:19:59] and coming of our lord jesus christ but
[1:20:01] we're eyewitnesses of his majesty
[1:20:04] amen for we received from god the father
[1:20:08] honor and glory
[1:20:10] when they came such a voice to him from
[1:20:12] the excellent glory
[1:20:14] this is my beloved son in whom i am well
[1:20:17] pleased
[1:20:21] and his voice which came from heaven we
[1:20:23] heard
[1:20:24] when we were with him in the holy
[1:20:25] mountains
[1:20:27] we have also a more sure word of
[1:20:29] prophecy
[1:20:31] where until you do well that you take
[1:20:33] heed
[1:20:34] as unto a light that's shined in a dark
[1:20:38] place
[1:20:39] and until the day dawn and the daystar
[1:20:41] rise in your hearts
[1:20:42] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:20:44] the scripture is our private
[1:20:46] interpretation amen
[1:20:48] for the prophecy came not in all time by
[1:20:50] the will of man
[1:20:52] but holy men of god speak
[1:20:55] as they were moved by the holy ghost
[1:20:58] amen so we thank god that
[1:21:01] this day we received a word that it
[1:21:04] wasn't devised
[1:21:06] it came from god amen amen
[1:21:11] it wasn't something made made up
[1:21:17] we all can see the latency of the hour
[1:21:19] hey man
[1:21:21] but we can see that people are being
[1:21:22] distracted they be distracted because
[1:21:25] there's so much of things that are
[1:21:26] happening in a physical realm
[1:21:28] right now people are dying every day
[1:21:31] people are losing their job
[1:21:34] people don't have food to eat
[1:21:39] people are getting retrenched from work
[1:21:40] these are the natural things that are
[1:21:41] happening around us
[1:21:44] and these are the distractions that come
[1:21:46] in the physical realm
[1:21:51] and people don't know what is happening
[1:21:54] but if they can go back to scripture
[1:21:56] amen if they can realize that these are
[1:21:59] modern events
[1:22:00] made clear by prophecy
[1:22:03] that this was foretold before it
[1:22:05] happened
[1:22:07] peter and the disciples and all these uh
[1:22:10] the fosters
[1:22:11] and all of them that followed jesus in
[1:22:13] the day when the persecution came upon
[1:22:16] them
[1:22:17] and each one supposed to started to get
[1:22:19] killed
[1:22:20] he didn't come as a shock to them
[1:22:23] they were it was foretold before it
[1:22:25] happened amen
[1:22:26] jesus told them what was going to come
[1:22:28] of them when paul was called by god
[1:22:31] god told him to paul almighty muslim for
[1:22:33] the gospel
[1:22:38] but people are getting shocked as to
[1:22:39] what is happening
[1:22:43] if you are a believer in god and you
[1:22:45] have received this message
[1:22:47] if the word has been revealed to you and
[1:22:48] you understand what is happening in this
[1:22:49] hour
[1:22:50] and the latency of this hour shouldn't
[1:22:51] be a shock to you
[1:22:55] you could speak to any unbeliever they
[1:22:56] all don't know what to do
[1:22:58] you all are scared and the bible says
[1:23:01] you cannot give us a spirit of fear but
[1:23:03] a power and of a sound mind
[1:23:05] what does fear do fear brings torment it
[1:23:08] releases
[1:23:09] a tremendous demon on you fear fear
[1:23:12] releases the tormenting spirit on you
[1:23:14] i'm talking about when you accept fear
[1:23:16] it releases the spirit upon you and that
[1:23:20] spirit begins to torment you
[1:23:22] and he put you in bondage but we never
[1:23:24] receive that spirit
[1:23:26] amen we received a spirit that will that
[1:23:29] will come to give us liberty in the day
[1:23:31] amen
[1:23:32] a spirit has set us free from bondage a
[1:23:35] spirit that set us
[1:23:36] free from slavery from the stressed
[1:23:38] house
[1:23:46] amen
[1:23:48] take god at his word amen yes amen
[1:23:51] in this hour when you have need take god
[1:23:53] at his word amen
[1:23:55] what does his word say he said don't
[1:23:58] worry what
[1:23:59] food you're gonna eat yes what clothes
[1:24:02] you gonna wear
[1:24:02] amen he said the birth of the air yes
[1:24:05] amen
[1:24:06] hey toy lord he had this food for him
[1:24:09] the lilies of the field thank you how
[1:24:12] are they clothed
[1:24:14] he said don't worry about the things
[1:24:16] your father know that you have need of
[1:24:17] something
[1:24:18] amen amen but you see god
[1:24:21] amen sometimes when you're in a
[1:24:22] situation when you when you're
[1:24:24] in a dark place and you don't know what
[1:24:27] to do
[1:24:30] that's the time you go and seek god you
[1:24:33] go to your father
[1:24:35] and say lord i'm in the situation yes
[1:24:37] and you're not mine
[1:24:38] yes and you you let off you forget about
[1:24:41] your natural senses yes
[1:24:42] amen amen amen when you're connected
[1:24:45] with that word
[1:24:46] you'll let off that physical realm right
[1:24:48] amen amen i'm not saying there's going
[1:24:49] to be
[1:24:50] everyone will go to their faith everyone
[1:24:52] goes to this phase
[1:24:53] when they come down amen look at elijah
[1:24:55] he had this great
[1:24:57] great thing going on he he
[1:25:00] encountered those false prophets
[1:25:05] on the mount carmel showdown amen
[1:25:08] and after that jesus because of the
[1:25:09] jersey bell's prophet jezebel said she
[1:25:11] will have him
[1:25:12] have his blood and whatever he began to
[1:25:15] run for his life
[1:25:17] because what happened now from the
[1:25:18] supernatural you have to come down to
[1:25:20] the natural
[1:25:20] amen he will switch gears so i'm saying
[1:25:23] now from the natural
[1:25:24] switch gear to the supernatural switch
[1:25:27] into gear
[1:25:28] and see what the world says in the midst
[1:25:31] of uncertainty be certain of god
[1:25:34] amen from the natural moving to the
[1:25:36] supernatural realm
[1:25:38] amen from jesus come
[1:25:42] from the supernatural to the natural
[1:25:44] amen because god had to be fashioned
[1:25:45] like unto men amen
[1:25:46] he had to let up everything he had to
[1:25:49] empty himself out
[1:25:50] he was made of no reputation
[1:25:56] you have to let off everything and come
[1:25:58] like a man but he had to be fashioned
[1:26:00] like a man
[1:26:01] amen so we can come to where he is amen
[1:26:05] because he has to take us back again to
[1:26:08] what was lost in the garden of eden
[1:26:10] man forfeited his rights in the garden
[1:26:12] of eden
[1:26:13] i don't know that adam was the image of
[1:26:15] god and they met dominion
[1:26:16] over everything everything was under
[1:26:18] adam's foot
[1:26:20] but adam forfeited that when he listened
[1:26:23] to you
[1:26:25] who listened to the serpent and by one
[1:26:27] word
[1:26:28] brought sin into the human race
[1:26:31] separation
[1:26:32] from god amen but jesus
[1:26:35] now he's showing disciple
[1:26:38] this is what you're going to go to then
[1:26:41] they began to see
[1:26:42] this is we know people even prophets can
[1:26:45] heal
[1:26:46] and pray pray for people that
[1:26:47] get healed but what we see now
[1:26:49] this is god this is not natural
[1:26:53] this is supernatural because you're
[1:26:55] trying to show them
[1:26:56] i come fashion like man because god had
[1:27:00] to come in human flesh
[1:27:01] god is a spirit right god is a
[1:27:03] supernatural being is a spirit
[1:27:05] it was easy for the for the jews listen
[1:27:07] to this now
[1:27:09] when moses was called up
[1:27:13] to receive the commandments of god
[1:27:16] and when god came in the the mount sinai
[1:27:19] in
[1:27:20] thunderings and lightnings and so forth
[1:27:22] what happened the people got scared
[1:27:25] this is moses don't let god speak to us
[1:27:29] let me speak to you you come speak to us
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:32] they were scared it was easy for them to
[1:27:34] believe a supernatural god hallelujah
[1:27:37] but now it's coming 2 000 years ago now
[1:27:42] when jesus comes on the scene
[1:27:46] they can't believe that god who is a
[1:27:48] supernatural god confession like unto a
[1:27:50] man
[1:27:52] they can't believe that this great god
[1:27:53] can come in a natural form
[1:27:55] amen there they were scared of him
[1:27:59] they wouldn't go near the mountain moses
[1:28:02] speak to us
[1:28:03] but yeah he's put on his face they pull
[1:28:06] his beard
[1:28:07] they want to do all manner of things to
[1:28:09] him
[1:28:10] to the same god that he was afraid of
[1:28:13] amen
[1:28:16] and that is why we find today that
[1:28:20] when we tell the people he appeared to
[1:28:22] us in this day
[1:28:24] it's so hard for them to believe because
[1:28:25] they think about the natural
[1:28:27] he appeared but we never see him we
[1:28:30] never heard from him
[1:28:33] but you you go and tell them about the
[1:28:35] god of the bible yeah they believe you
[1:28:36] did the bible thing but they can't
[1:28:37] believe
[1:28:38] what he's doing in this day amen they
[1:28:40] can see this god in
[1:28:42] in 2000 years ago the gospels they can
[1:28:44] see this jesus working in the gospels
[1:28:47] but they can't see him right here then
[1:28:49] he appeared before
[1:28:50] us they can't see him in the way he's
[1:28:53] revealing himself
[1:28:55] and the same thing today with people
[1:28:57] it's easy for them to believe
[1:28:59] that he was here in 1963 he was here
[1:29:02] from 1947 right to 1965
[1:29:04] amen working amongst the prophets
[1:29:08] but it's hard for them to see that he's
[1:29:09] working amongst the people now amen
[1:29:12] it's easy for him to believe cancer was
[1:29:14] healed in the prophet moses
[1:29:16] the the blind began to see the death
[1:29:18] began to hear
[1:29:20] the the lame began to walk the dead was
[1:29:24] raised it's easy for him to believe that
[1:29:28] but has god changed he's the same
[1:29:31] yesterday today and forever
[1:29:33] amen is it not the same spirit that was
[1:29:37] there is here now today amen is he not
[1:29:40] now in the bride
[1:29:42] amen amen all these mechanics you have
[1:29:44] received and received amen
[1:29:46] through your five senses you had the
[1:29:48] dynamics the mechanics right
[1:29:50] amen but it's time now to switch into
[1:29:53] the supernatural
[1:29:55] amen and let the dynamics take place
[1:29:58] because it's the hour coming now when
[1:29:59] you're going to have needs
[1:30:01] where you're going to have needs that
[1:30:02] your natural man cannot help you
[1:30:04] yes amen it was the time
[1:30:07] it actually happened in the first exodus
[1:30:09] they came out
[1:30:11] supernaturally god fed them
[1:30:13] supernaturally the clothes never ran old
[1:30:16] supernaturally they were healed there
[1:30:19] were no sickness of the boundary if
[1:30:20] there was
[1:30:21] the brah serpent was there how much more
[1:30:24] jesus christ
[1:30:26] amen that was only the example you can
[1:30:29] believe god then
[1:30:30] amen under the blood of bull and goats
[1:30:33] how much more now
[1:30:34] under the blood of jesus christ amen and
[1:30:36] how much more now
[1:30:37] in this hour amen when he comes to put
[1:30:40] claims over you
[1:30:41] amen amen when the book of redemption
[1:30:44] comes down in the day
[1:30:51] and how much more now when you have an
[1:30:53] identification with him
[1:30:55] amen amen when you have signing powers
[1:30:58] yes amen
[1:31:12] that is why the natural mind it's so
[1:31:15] hard for the natural mind to comprehend
[1:31:18] the the the the things of god
[1:31:21] because the things of god are
[1:31:23] spiritually designed
[1:31:26] it is how can you you deserve something
[1:31:30] spiritually
[1:31:31] if you are not connected to him amen and
[1:31:34] how can you be connected to him you
[1:31:35] never come under justification
[1:31:37] you're not sanctified you don't have the
[1:31:38] baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:31:40] but how can you be connected to him how
[1:31:43] can the spirit of god dwell in you
[1:31:45] if you haven't even changed your heart
[1:31:47] of stone to other flesh
[1:31:49] if you never even had that changes yet
[1:31:51] there had to be a nature change
[1:31:54] amen there to be a nature change
[1:31:57] because now you realize jesus was the
[1:31:59] first born of many
[1:32:01] and he brought you now under a new
[1:32:02] citizenship amen
[1:32:05] that you are now no longer the citizens
[1:32:07] of this world
[1:32:09] all these elements that will die off of
[1:32:11] these temporal elements
[1:32:12] you are citizens of heaven amen
[1:32:17] jesus come from the supernatural to the
[1:32:19] natural we are going from the natural to
[1:32:21] the supernatural
[1:32:22] amen amen
[1:32:26] we are going to be transformed from
[1:32:27] natural from mortal to immortality
[1:32:37] it's so hard for us to to believe things
[1:32:41] god for to believe god for the
[1:32:42] supernatural because everything we in
[1:32:45] our life
[1:32:46] if we want to achieve a home we think
[1:32:48] about we have to get a job
[1:32:50] we have to get a we have to get so much
[1:32:52] mortgage
[1:32:53] to get a house and when we try to
[1:32:57] conceive how we're going to make this
[1:32:58] money
[1:32:59] but did we ever go and pray and say lord
[1:33:01] i lay this at your feet
[1:33:02] yes you direct me to get the right job
[1:33:05] yes you direct me to get the right raise
[1:33:08] you direct me to get a nice good enough
[1:33:10] salary to afford a mortgage
[1:33:11] and get a house if you just look at
[1:33:14] things only naturally
[1:33:16] that's what the people of the world do
[1:33:18] yeah we are not called on to that
[1:33:19] amen amen and neither are we called
[1:33:23] to build our kingdoms on this earth
[1:33:25] right because the bible says godliness
[1:33:27] with contentment is great gain
[1:33:29] amen if we've got the basic things
[1:33:33] that's good enough god don't want you to
[1:33:35] go hungry
[1:33:36] god never make history the righteous god
[1:33:38] will not leave the righteous forsaken
[1:33:40] nor lay when he let his children bake
[1:33:42] bread yes
[1:33:44] god will not god like his children to be
[1:33:48] happy
[1:33:50] god knows that if you're in need of a
[1:33:52] shelter you'll provide that for you amen
[1:33:54] god knows you have need of an automobile
[1:33:56] to take you from point a to point b
[1:33:58] and he'll provide that for you but god
[1:34:00] knows that you need clothes you need
[1:34:01] food he knows that
[1:34:03] but god wants you to seek refurb his
[1:34:05] kingdom and his righteousness
[1:34:08] then all these things shall be added
[1:34:09] unto you it is easy to take the
[1:34:11] scripture and say
[1:34:12] all this thing shall be added unto me
[1:34:14] but what about taking the first part
[1:34:16] seek first his kingdom and his
[1:34:30] righteousness and from the time we
[1:34:32] receive this word
[1:34:33] there's been hungering and thirsting
[1:34:35] within us for more and more
[1:34:38] just like how you feed your natural man
[1:34:40] if you don't feed that natural man
[1:34:41] anymore
[1:34:42] you stop drinking water you stop eating
[1:34:44] food
[1:34:45] that man will start to die
[1:34:49] how do we expect to achieve anything in
[1:34:52] the supernatural
[1:34:54] if we're not feeding the spirit man i'm
[1:34:56] not talking about coming to church
[1:34:58] and receiving a sunday message or a
[1:35:01] midweek message
[1:35:03] i'm talking about an individual work i'm
[1:35:06] talking about a personal relationship
[1:35:09] because it's a uniting time and a sign
[1:35:12] you know what a dangerous i want to see
[1:35:14] if you haven't been united with him
[1:35:15] am i if you haven't been united with him
[1:35:20] there was many who came and said lord
[1:35:22] lord have i not prophesied in your name
[1:35:26] lord i will not cast out demons in your
[1:35:28] name what he said
[1:35:30] depart from me workers of inequity i
[1:35:32] know you're not
[1:35:33] yes amen they haven't been united with
[1:35:37] him
[1:35:38] in the way he came in this hour
[1:35:40] hallelujah
[1:35:43] the pharisees and said you see the holy
[1:35:45] people
[1:35:46] they thought they were united with god
[1:35:48] through the law
[1:35:50] but the way he came they wasn't united
[1:35:52] with him
[1:35:55] the nominal christians are going to
[1:35:57] church they're talking about
[1:35:58] they're confessing jesus they're praying
[1:36:00] to jesus
[1:36:01] and they sing miracles because the bible
[1:36:03] says the rain falls on the just and the
[1:36:05] angels
[1:36:07] that doesn't mean they are saved
[1:36:11] they are getting miracles because the
[1:36:12] rain is falling
[1:36:17] but we're talking about we're talking
[1:36:19] about getting in the translation
[1:36:20] we're talking about the rapture in faith
[1:36:22] now
[1:36:24] they are receiving christ i mean
[1:36:26] speaking about christ they're professing
[1:36:28] christ
[1:36:29] they're using christ's name in prayer
[1:36:31] and so forth and they think miracles
[1:36:32] take place
[1:36:34] and god only deny them that because
[1:36:35] those are the spiritual gifts the lying
[1:36:36] spiritual gifts
[1:36:38] and the reason why it's falling is
[1:36:40] because the bride is on the earth
[1:36:42] yes that's the fact the rain has to fall
[1:36:45] because the bride is on the earth
[1:36:46] am i but it's going to become an hour
[1:36:48] when the bride is taken off the scene
[1:36:51] amen because she's going to transform
[1:36:53] from the natural body
[1:36:54] to the supernatural body amen from
[1:36:57] mortal to immortality
[1:36:58] when she leaves the earth it becomes the
[1:37:01] closing
[1:37:02] the grace days of gentiles
[1:37:06] and then what happens the rain starts to
[1:37:07] fall on them
[1:37:13] but the rain will fall as long as the
[1:37:16] bride is on the earth
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:36] world they could see no sin they could
[1:37:39] see no pain
[1:37:41] they could see no death they only could
[1:37:43] see that
[1:37:44] yet it wasn't fully revealed to them but
[1:37:46] when they received the baptism of the
[1:37:48] holy ghost
[1:37:50] nothing in their natural life mattered
[1:37:52] more
[1:37:54] than them wanting to attain what was
[1:37:57] supposed to be
[1:37:58] yet they never they never they
[1:38:00] themselves had to die
[1:38:03] they had to die they had to go by the
[1:38:05] way of death
[1:38:06] but they knew that was a door
[1:38:10] to an immortal life amen
[1:38:13] that was a door to another life
[1:38:17] but we are living in the hour now we
[1:38:19] have this promise
[1:38:21] this is our promise that is why this is
[1:38:23] all we speak about
[1:38:25] we speak about a rapture we speak about
[1:38:27] a body change
[1:38:28] we speak about leaving this past hour we
[1:38:31] speak about this earth being changed
[1:38:33] because we're living in the hour where
[1:38:35] god's three four purpose
[1:38:37] has to be fulfilled coming to completion
[1:38:40] amen restore fallen adam man back to
[1:38:44] dominion again
[1:38:45] to restore falun eve to bring his church
[1:38:48] into a condition
[1:38:49] where she wouldn't accept anything else
[1:38:51] she won't accept any deception
[1:38:54] that the serpent owned the savior with
[1:38:55] his word
[1:38:58] she will take god at his word
[1:39:01] that he's restored eve amen the world is
[1:39:05] gonna
[1:39:05] celebrating woman's day women want to
[1:39:08] achieve and get something they feel that
[1:39:10] was taken from them
[1:39:12] or they want to to come to some
[1:39:13] achievement they want to achieve
[1:39:15] something in life
[1:39:16] but here's the bride of jesus christ she

[1:39:26] because why she received the baptism of
[1:39:29] the holy ghost which is the earnest of
[1:39:31] the inheritance
[1:39:32] amen the down payment
[1:39:36] amen she received a kingdom which cannot
[1:39:38] be moved
[1:39:40] she received a kingdom amen and those
[1:39:43] people saw the kingdom coming in power
[1:39:45] when they saw jesus in a glorified state
[1:39:48] they saw the power of this kingdom
[1:39:50] they saw that this is something that
[1:39:51] contains death
[1:39:53] this is something supernatural amen as
[1:39:56] we've seen the kingdom come in power in
[1:39:58] this day
[1:39:59] have we seen the supernatural in this
[1:40:00] day amen have we seen god come our way
[1:40:08] amen
[1:40:12] let's open to john 1 john 3 2.
[1:40:34] beloved now are we the sons of god
[1:40:37] and don't not yet appear what we shall
[1:40:40] be
[1:40:41] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:40:44] shall be like him
[1:40:45] for we shall see him as he is amen
[1:40:49] amen we shall see him as he is we shall
[1:40:52] also have that body
[1:40:54] him and aren't you glad that we're going
[1:40:56] to have a body
[1:40:57] and we know what it is if you want to go
[1:40:59] to space
[1:41:01] you can't just go there you gotta you
[1:41:03] gotta go and learn how to be an
[1:41:05] astronaut
[1:41:06] you gotta have the right equipment you
[1:41:08] gotta have the right
[1:41:09] gear on
[1:41:12] and it takes you a long time to practice
[1:41:14] how to become an astronaut
[1:41:17] if you want to get into that dimension
[1:41:18] if you want to get into the rapture
[1:41:20] you got to know what it takes to get
[1:41:22] there you got to know what it takes to
[1:41:24] have a body change
[1:41:25] you got to come to the process to
[1:41:27] justification certification
[1:41:29] baptism of the holy ghost coming and
[1:41:31] accepting his word in this day
[1:41:33] come and apply the token in your life
[1:41:36] the holy ghost word that comes down amen
[1:41:40] this message is a holy ghost message
[1:41:43] amen he's not a message from a man it's
[1:41:46] come from another world
[1:41:51] the headstone has come down to be
[1:41:53] connected with the body
[1:41:55] and that's what the world rejected in
[1:41:57] this hour when they rejected the
[1:41:58] headstone
[1:41:59] they couldn't be part of their body
[1:42:02] when they rejected the message of the
[1:42:04] hour they rejected the headstone
[1:42:09] and they were no longer connected with
[1:42:10] that body they were not united with him
[1:42:14] and they lost their chance to go into
[1:42:16] the rapture
[1:42:18] because as hell was spoken
[1:42:21] from this very pulpit that the rapture
[1:42:23] is a cycle it's a process that already
[1:42:25] started
[1:42:25] yes amen and if you're not already
[1:42:28] caught up in that process
[1:42:30] and you're ready for some future events
[1:42:33] it'll already be gone
[1:42:35] and you'll continue life like normal
[1:42:38] rapture is not some future event it's a
[1:42:40] process that already started
[1:42:43] what's going to happen next is the
[1:42:44] resurrection
[1:42:46] of the sleeping saints and when they
[1:42:50] come
[1:42:51] and we which are alive and remain also
[1:42:53] will be quickened with them
[1:42:56] the sleeping sings their body is gonna
[1:42:58] end the sixth dimension is going to
[1:42:59] empty out
[1:43:01] those theoretically bodies those theorem
[1:43:03] bodies
[1:43:04] are going to pick those earthly bodies
[1:43:06] whether it went in the grave
[1:43:07] whether he went in the fire when it was
[1:43:09] eaten by lions when it went in the sea
[1:43:11] amen whichever way it went it's going to
[1:43:13] come up

[1:43:16] glorified state
[1:43:18] amen and you watch our life and remain
[1:43:23] your bodies the six dimension is also
[1:43:25] going to empty out your theoretically
[1:43:26] amen and it's going to connect with this
[1:43:28] body but if you are not connected to it

[1:44:01] prophet they had the pull of fire
[1:44:03] they had the supernatural cloud they
[1:44:05] went through the red sea
[1:44:07] but they wasn't there to cross over
[1:44:08] jordan amen
[1:44:11] it's crossing over time amen it's the
[1:44:13] hour of translation amen amen
[1:44:15] it's time to put out the old man from

[1:45:22] taking a lot with him
[1:45:23] eventually he had to be separated from
[1:45:24] lot as well
[1:45:26] amen then when lord comes out
[1:45:30] and he's just abraham now and sarah
[1:45:32] because sarah is connected to abraham
