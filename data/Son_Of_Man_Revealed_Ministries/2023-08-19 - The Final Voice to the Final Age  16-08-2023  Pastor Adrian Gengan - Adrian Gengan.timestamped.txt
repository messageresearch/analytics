[6:07] light for the elected see hey a city

[6:18] neither do men light a candle and put it

[6:51] glorify your father which is in heaven
[6:54] amen amen then let's turn to amen our
[6:57] main scripture Numbers Chapter 13. amen
[6:59] praise be to the Lord
[7:03] he has The Exodus Prophet now
[7:07] amen The Exodus Prophet Numbers Chapter
[7:10] 13 and we know there's 13 types of
[7:13] Revelation 13 because a great curse is
[7:15] going to come upon the children of
[7:17] Israel because of what takes place in
[7:19] Numbers Chapter 13.
[7:21] God curses that entire generation that
[7:25] came out of Egypt because of what takes
[7:27] place here
[7:28] and the Lord speak unto Moses saying
[7:30] send thou men that they may search the
[7:33] land of Canaan Canaan is the type of the
[7:37] Holy Ghost
[7:38] so search the holy ghost search the
[7:40] scriptures which I give unto the
[7:42] children of Israel of every tribe of
[7:44] their fathers and shall he send him man
[7:47] everyone a ruler among them
[7:49] and Moses by the Commandment of the Lord
[7:51] sent them from the Wilderness of Quran
[7:53] all those men were heads of the children
[7:56] of Israel so I'm not going to read it
[7:58] but you can read all the men that were
[8:01] chosen right
[8:02] how many spies were chosen
[8:05] amen we know they were changed spies
[8:07] right so we come to verse 16 now we
[8:10] don't we don't want to read to save time
[8:13] he says these are the names of the men
[8:14] which Moses sent to spy out the land
[8:17] and Moses called O'Shea the son of none
[8:22] Yeshua right so that's Joshua they just
[8:25] call his name differently there and
[8:26] Moses sent them to spy out the land of
[8:29] Canaan and said unto them get you up
[8:32] this way Southward and go up into the
[8:35] mountain
[8:36] and see the land what it is and the
[8:39] people that dwell it therein whether
[8:42] they be strong or weak few or many
[8:45] and what the land is that they dwell in
[8:48] whether it be good or bad and what the
[8:51] cities they be that dwell in whether
[8:54] Intense or in strongholds and what the
[8:57] land is whether it be fat or lean
[9:00] whether they be whipped they're in or
[9:02] not
[9:03] and be of good courage and bring of the
[9:06] fruit of the land
[9:09] now the time was the time of the first
[9:12] ripe grapes
[9:14] so they went up and searched the land
[9:16] from the Wilderness of Zinn unto their
[9:18] op as men came to Amat
[9:21] and they ascended by the south and came
[9:24] unto Ebron where ayaman cheshai and
[9:27] Talma the children of Enoch were so
[9:30] these are giants in the land and they
[9:32] came unto the brook of ishkol and cut
[9:35] down from thence a branch with one
[9:37] cluster of grapes and they bathed
[9:39] between two upon his staff and they
[9:42] brought off the pomegranates and of the
[9:45] figs
[9:47] the place was called The Brook escort
[9:48] because of the cluster of grapes which
[9:50] the children of Israel cut down from
[9:52] dense and they returned from searching
[9:54] of the land after 40 days
[9:56] now that 40 days is very important
[9:59] because God cursed them according to he
[10:01] says the number of days that you spend
[10:03] searching the land it shall be the
[10:04] number of years that you're wondering in
[10:06] the wilderness
[10:07] right that's how they got determined the
[10:10] number of years they were one in the
[10:12] wilderness and they went and came to
[10:14] Moses and Aaron and to all the
[10:16] congregation of the children of Israel
[10:18] and showed the fruit of the land I'm
[10:21] trying to skip here so we can get to the
[10:22] main point and they told him we came
[10:24] unto the land where would thou ascended
[10:26] us and surely it flow through milk and
[10:28] Ani and this is the fruit of it
[10:31] nevertheless the people be strong that
[10:33] dwell in the land and the cities are
[10:35] walled and very great and moreover we
[10:39] saw the children of anak there the
[10:42] amalekites dwell in the land of the
[10:43] South and the Hittites and the jebusites
[10:46] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[10:48] and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and
[10:50] by the coast of Jordan
[10:52] and Caleb stealed the people before
[10:54] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[10:57] possess it for we are well able to
[11:00] overcome it amen
[11:02] but the men went up with himself
[11:06] we be not able to go up against the
[11:08] people for they are stronger than we
[11:12] and they brought up an evil report of
[11:15] the land which they had searched unto
[11:16] the children of Israel saying the land
[11:19] through which we have gone to search it
[11:20] is a land that heated up the inhabitants
[11:22] thereof and all the people that we saw
[11:25] in it are men of great stature
[11:28] and they were and and there we saw the
[11:30] Giants the sons of Enoch which came
[11:33] which come of the Giants and we were in
[11:35] our own side as Grasshoppers and so we
[11:38] were in their sight
[11:40] and all the children of is this is the
[11:43] next chapter now and all the
[11:45] congregation lifted up their voice and
[11:46] cried and the people wept that night
[11:50] you see what
[11:51] wrong leaders can do
[11:53] amen this is typing the denominational
[11:56] church now putting fear into the people
[11:58] not able to possess the land of the
[12:00] inheritance which is the Holy Ghost
[12:01] which is the message of the hour
[12:04] and all the children of Israel murmured
[12:06] against Moses and against Aaron and the
[12:08] old congregation said unto them
[12:10] with God that we had died in the land of
[12:12] Egypt or what God have we died in the
[12:15] wilderness and wherefore at the Lord
[12:17] brought us unto this land to Fall by the
[12:19] sword that our wives and our children
[12:21] should be prayed were not better for us
[12:23] to return into Egypt and they said one
[12:25] to another let us make a caption and let
[12:28] us return into Egypt
[12:29] then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces
[12:32] before the Assembly of the congregation
[12:34] of the children of Israel and Joshua the
[12:36] son of none and Caleb the son of jephina
[12:39] which were of them that searched the
[12:41] land rent their clothes and they spake
[12:43] unto the company of the children of
[12:44] Israel saying the land which we pass
[12:46] through to search it is an exceeding
[12:49] good land amen
[12:52] if the Lord Delight in us then he will
[12:54] bring us into this land and give it to
[12:56] us a land which floweth with milk and
[12:58] honey only Rebel not he against the Lord
[13:01] neither fear he the people of the land
[13:04] for they are bred for us
[13:08] their defense is departed from them and
[13:10] the Lord Is With Us fear them not amen
[13:14] but all the congregation bathe stoned
[13:16] them with stones and the glory of the
[13:18] Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the
[13:20] congregation before the children of
[13:22] Israel
[13:23] so amen you may be seated the Lord and
[13:25] blessings to the reading of his word
[13:27] hallelujah
[13:36] amen praise the Lord
[13:40] what a scene amen
[13:42] when God had done so much for them
[13:45] and yet they find themselves in this
[13:46] predicament
[13:48] amen
[13:50] so we find here
[13:53] and I want to speak a little bit on the
[13:55] final voice
[13:56] amen because we are the final voice to
[13:58] the final age
[13:59] amen
[14:02] so if we have the final voice to the
[14:04] final age like the prophet says the
[14:06] question we need to ask ourselves is how
[14:08] are we using our voice
[14:11] amen because we have limited time on the
[14:13] Earth
[14:14] yes yes so we need to be able to use our
[14:16] voice effectively yeah
[14:18] amen and God has an expectation of us in
[14:22] this hour to use our voice and not to be
[14:24] silent amen so that's why Matthew
[14:27] Chapter 5 says let your light shine
[14:29] before men amen
[14:30] now if you notice Joshua and Caleb they
[14:33] didn't change their opinion
[14:35] they didn't change their voice but in
[14:37] the midst of a great outcry from the
[14:40] unbelief coming out of the camp they
[14:42] raised their voice and they stood firm
[14:44] on the word of God
[14:46] what were they doing letting their light
[14:48] shine before men
[14:51] amen
[14:53] so we know that a voice is used to speak
[14:55] a message to communicate to influence
[14:58] someone or to convey a message so we can
[15:01] use our voice in many ways we know that
[15:04] we can use our voice Amen to to feel
[15:08] to express how we feel
[15:10] we can greet someone with our voice we
[15:13] can encourage someone we can build up
[15:15] but with the same voice we can also tear
[15:17] down amen because our Words of Power yes
[15:20] amen hallelujah
[15:24] so are we using our voice to spread fear
[15:28] anxiety worry stress negativity
[15:32] [Music]
[15:33] how are we using our voice
[15:36] amen now
[15:38] I love the way you prayed brother Ramesh
[15:40] the prayer request went forth and you
[15:43] didn't say Lord that sister came heal
[15:45] Sister Kim I thank you Lord that you've
[15:47] already done it
[15:50] amen amen amen so what's the progression
[15:52] now because remember the teaching has
[15:54] been coming watch your confession watch
[15:56] what you pray believe that you've
[15:58] already received it so we thank the Lord
[16:00] that he's already done it
[16:02] amen because we call those things which
[16:05] are not as though they are
[16:07] right right you remember when God is
[16:09] looking at Abraham and he tells him now
[16:12] he doesn't even have a child yet he
[16:15] comes in he says I know this man that he
[16:17] shall teach his children
[16:19] God is already seeing him full of
[16:21] children
[16:22] amen so whatever you're praying for
[16:25] believe that you have already received
[16:27] it speak about it in the past tense
[16:30] by his stripes we were healed amen amen
[16:34] hallelujah
[16:35] so we find we had a voice that proceeds
[16:38] the final voice
[16:41] which is the voice of the seventh angel
[16:44] amen and he wants to reveal the
[16:46] mysteries of God yes
[16:49] yes Hallelujah
[16:51] amen we should never forget that fact
[16:54] it shouldn't be something casual there's
[16:57] no other Church upon the face of the
[17:00] Earth right now that has a pillow of
[17:02] fire you can put on the slide amen not a
[17:04] cloud yes
[17:06] Hallelujah there's no other church that
[17:08] has this Vindication yes we are the only
[17:11] church on the earth Amen in the final
[17:13] Exodus that has a pillow fire and a
[17:15] cloud yes thank you Father amen we
[17:20] should not be shy about the message this
[17:23] message came Vindicated yes amen
[17:25] sometimes we hang around too much of
[17:27] unbelief
[17:28] amen hallelujah we need to get away from
[17:31] all unbelief
[17:32] be like Joshua and Caleb thank you Lord
[17:35] amen hallelujah and sometimes it's our
[17:38] very family members that are full of
[17:40] unbelief and we love them so much
[17:43] that we get caught up in the unbelief
[17:44] it's not we're influencing them they
[17:47] influence us we want to see how close we
[17:50] can get to to entertain them amen to
[17:52] appease them
[17:54] without offending them amen be like
[17:56] Joshua and Caleb stand your ground amen
[17:59] declare the word of the Lord amen your
[18:01] very presence will bring condemnation to
[18:03] them and in fact if you are shining your
[18:05] light before men they cannot stand your
[18:07] presence if they are loving your
[18:09] presence and something is wrong Jesus
[18:12] said if they hate me they will hate you
[18:15] oh thank you Lord thank you Lord
[18:18] to be like Jesus amen to be like Jesus
[18:23] Jesus didn't want everyone Amen to love
[18:25] him he loved the word and Jesus spoke
[18:28] the word amen amen therefore they hated
[18:30] him
[18:31] amen hallelujah so the message that we
[18:35] have heard
[18:36] amen
[18:38] came by one
[18:40] the seventh angel
[18:42] and the Bible says he that happened here
[18:44] to hear what the seventh angel is saying
[18:46] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[18:49] amen so the one that has an ear to ear
[18:51] is the one that receives it into his
[18:53] heart
[18:54] we gotta learn Jesus teaching now yes
[18:57] the one that was sown in the heart the
[19:00] good ground
[19:01] because you must believe in your
[19:03] heart amen so the one that's believing
[19:07] the word in his heart becomes
[19:10] a generator
[19:13] we are all generators
[19:17] amen amen soon they might switch on the
[19:19] generator
[19:22] what are we what is that generator
[19:23] producing
[19:25] energy electricity
[19:28] what's the right word for the Caleb
[19:32] it's electricity
[19:34] right
[19:36] that will feed
[19:37] into that box
[19:39] and it will give us light
[19:42] so it generates producing that energy
[19:46] we become a generator of faith
[19:50] the word must fall into ears that here
[19:53] yes and when Faith falls into a ear that
[19:57] has the ability to hear amen
[19:59] thank you
[20:01] I'm telling you you're a free generator
[20:05] you're a rare species
[20:08] very few people can generate Faith
[20:10] perfect faith in this hour amen that
[20:13] isn't here to hear what the seventh
[20:15] angel has said
[20:17] oh Hallelujah you know when you hear
[20:19] that seventh Angels Voice or you hear
[20:22] that eagle screaming amen and something
[20:24] in your heart just tugs and you say oh
[20:26] hallelujah amen
[20:28] amen and that voice when you hear it
[20:31] amen you you look up and you hear Mama
[20:33] Eagle calling you to come up a little
[20:35] higher yeah amen and when Faith cometh
[20:38] by the hearing of that word within you
[20:40] start to generate a faith amen you start
[20:42] to generate faith faith cometh by
[20:44] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[20:49] amen say this over yourself now I am a
[20:52] generator of perfect free perfect Faith
[20:55] amen hallelujah some are generating
[20:58] imperfect Faith because they have an
[21:00] imperfect word
[21:01] they have a partial work
[21:04] amen if they are receiving Luther's word
[21:06] that's the kind of faith that they could
[21:08] that they will generate
[21:10] adjust
[21:11] ification faith
[21:14] amen that's all that they can generate
[21:15] if they are under the influence of
[21:17] Wesley all that they can generate is
[21:20] sanctification
[21:23] amenity all they can generate is Gifts
[21:27] of speaking in tongues
[21:29] amen but now we have come to The
[21:32] Showdown hey
[21:33] amen amen where there's a group of
[21:36] people that have listened to the voice
[21:37] of the seventh angels
[21:39] let me tell you something if you are if
[21:42] you are true predecided seed of God
[21:44] there's only one thing that you can
[21:45] produce by listening to The Prophet's
[21:47] voice that's perfect thing yes yes
[21:51] if something else is coming out there's
[21:53] something wrong with you there's
[21:55] something wrong with your generator you
[21:57] need a service
[21:59] amen and maybe you don't have enough

[23:02] and the pillar of Fire
[23:04] God told him and he told him go into the
[23:07] Holy Ghost
[23:09] go into the word

[28:20] denominationalism
[28:23] amen and maybe we won't go all the way
[28:26] back we just create a denomination
[28:27] within the ranks of the message
[28:31] Hallelujah
[28:33] will create a denomination in the ranks
[28:35] of the message
[28:40] amen but there's a people
[28:42] there's a people within a people
[28:45] there's a group within the group there's
[28:47] a message within the message
[28:49] amen because not all message is message

[30:29] our faith amen
[30:31] amen amen
[30:32] hallelujah you know I was
[30:36] I was thinking about these uh people
[30:38] there's two stories here and I was
[30:41] telling you about Genesis 12 how the
[30:43] first place that Abraham met the Lord
[30:45] was Inception
[30:47] and that's we building an altar unto the
[30:49] Lord
[30:50] and it became a holy place the first
[30:52] time that God had met Abraham in the
[30:55] journey and here we find amen if we
[30:57] maybe you can just put up the scripture
[30:59] you'll find it away quickly in Genesis
[31:02] 37 verse 12
[31:05] yeah the prophet
[31:10] Jacob who is
[31:12] Israel
[31:16] is sending Joseph
[31:23] verse 12 right
[31:26] his father thinks the obsession
[31:32] amen like when Brandon came on the scene
[31:34] he expected them to be in a certain
[31:36] place in a certain level of Faith but
[31:39] they were not there they were not at the
[31:41] place of the altar they were not where
[31:44] God had thought they were
[31:47] amen amen they looked from the outside
[31:49] they looked like they were
[31:52] in the father's thinking he thought they
[31:55] were there and his Brethren went to feed
[31:57] their father's flock in session session
[32:00] was so God was God appointed place of
[32:02] meeting right it was the appointed place
[32:04] where God made Abram
[32:06] but they left session and in verse 13 it
[32:10] says and Israel said to Joseph do not
[32:12] thy Brethren feed the flocking session
[32:14] come I will send the unto them and he
[32:17] said unto him yeah am I am
[32:20] so he was willing to go to his brothers
[32:23] amen
[32:24] hallelujah amen and he said
[32:28] go I pray thee to see whether it be well
[32:30] with thy Brethren and with the flux and
[32:32] bring me word again
[32:35] and he sends him out of the veil of
[32:38] Ebron
[32:39] amen and came to session
[32:42] and a certain man and be and a certain
[32:45] man found him and behold he was
[32:46] wandering in the field and the man asked
[32:48] him saying what Seekers thou and he said
[32:50] I seeketh my brethren tell me I pray
[32:52] thee where they feed their flocks
[32:55] amen
[32:57] and the man said they are departed ends
[33:00] for I heard them say let us go to Dothan
[33:05] and Joseph went up to his Brethren and
[33:07] found him in Dothan amen hallelujah
[33:11] praise be to the Lord
[33:13] now it's important
[33:15] to note a few things here
[33:18] amen
[33:20] this didn't come back on
[33:24] praise the Lord
[33:31] praise the Lord
[33:33] so notice
[33:34] session is how many letters
[33:38] count quickly
[33:41] we need to go back to verse amen 13.
[33:47] seven letters
[33:49] how many is counting seven letters
[33:52] and Dothan is only letters
[33:56] so they left
[33:59] the place of seven letters
[34:01] and they went down to the six letters
[34:03] but daughter means two Wells
[34:08] so they left the one place to one true
[34:10] God
[34:11] and they went
[34:13] after other gods
[34:15] Dothan means two Wells double systems
[34:19] decrees laws customs and double feast
[34:25] they left a place where Abraham met the
[34:27] one true Living God
[34:29] and they went to Dothan
[34:32] amen many left Branham and they went
[34:36] after Graham
[34:39] amen
[34:41] if you read Genesis 18 you'll see the
[34:43] two angels going down to Sodom yes and
[34:45] Gomorrah that types Oral Roberts and
[34:47] Billy Graham yes
[34:49] every denominational denomination that I
[34:52] sprung up is products of their Ministry
[34:54] you'll see either they gone into the
[34:57] word of faith and the healing movement
[34:59] or they gone into the Baptist side of
[35:01] things
[35:02] amen
[35:03] products of the Ministries but there's a
[35:07] group that stayed with Abraham amen
[35:09] there's a group that come out of
[35:10] Abraham's Ministry amen we are the group
[35:14] that's come out of branham's ministry
[35:17] amen hallelujah
[35:20] now also very notable
[35:24] is Joshua Joshua 24 32 let's read this
[35:28] quickly
[35:32] this place has a special meaning
[35:38] and when Joseph satis turned back now
[35:40] remember they left Exodus they left
[35:42] Egypt right
[35:43] and the bones of Joseph
[35:46] which the children of Israel brought up
[35:48] out of Egypt bury they went
[35:52] an impossible ground which Jacob bought
[35:54] of the sons of amor the father of
[35:57] session for a hundred pieces of silver
[35:59] and it became the inheritance of the
[36:02] children of Joseph
[36:05] the very place his father sent him
[36:10] they buried him in the same spot
[36:14] amen so just because the ten have left
[36:18] and gone hmm to another place
[36:21] to double Wells
[36:23] amen hallelujah to Lord and decrees and
[36:26] custom the tradition of men
[36:29] we need to stay with the message of the
[36:31] hour amen our hearts have to be turned
[36:33] back to the faith of the fathers
[36:35] amen so the very place that Israel had
[36:38] sent Joseph
[36:40] is the very place that he was buried
[36:43] amen now what were the brothers trying
[36:45] to do suppress his dream suppress his
[36:48] vision
[36:49] amen so people won't be happy with your
[36:51] vision yeah not everyone will be happy
[36:54] with your vision not everyone will be
[36:55] happy with your confession
[36:57] amen hallelujah but you need to stay
[37:00] true to the vision Joseph was not
[37:03] deterred by the negativity of his
[37:05] brothers
[37:07] the brothers that walked with him yes
[37:09] yes amen the brothers that had gone on
[37:11] with him neither was Joshua and Caleb
[37:13] deterred by the testimony of the other
[37:16] brothers
[37:17] amen so it's coming a time now and I
[37:20] don't know about you but the pressure is
[37:22] all around
[37:24] the pressure to stand out ground
[37:27] there's unbelief all around us let us
[37:30] seeing spirit is creeping up all around
[37:32] us amen people want to be casual in the
[37:34] message people want to settle in the
[37:36] message amen hallelujah we have things
[37:38] going well for us amen look at how God
[37:40] has blessed us with the word look at how
[37:42] God has done this but God has so much
[37:44] more in store for us God wants us to
[37:46] inherit all of the promises of God and
[37:49] I'm afraid too many people don't want to
[37:51] go into the land of Canaan
[37:56] now suddenly the Holy Ghost looks like a
[37:58] giant to them
[37:59] they are fearful of the Holy Ghost
[38:04] amen hallelujah
[38:06] praise the Lord amen can you say praise

[39:04] something oh you know my sugar levels
[39:05] are very high and this and that why are
[39:07] you confessing yeah

[39:40] can't be double-minded yes God cannot
[39:42] use cowards and if there's anything in
[39:45] the sour I want to be used of the Lord I
[39:48] mean if you have the desire Lord use me
[39:50] if you can use anything Use Me Lord yes
[39:52] amen I don't want to be a coward I want
[39:54] to be full of faith in this hour
[39:56] amen is giving us Revelation because
[39:59] faith is a revelation for a reason
[40:03] let's believe him amen when we believe
[40:05] him let's really believe it
[40:09] so don't let's confess one thing and
[40:11] then on the outside we are showing
[40:12] another thing amen you've got to believe

[40:35] the final voice do you know we have to
[40:37] be teachers of the word
[40:43] if we are not doing that then we are not
[40:45] fulfilling our duty we're thinking
[40:47] prophesying he's going standing
[40:48] somewhere here he hear he
[40:53] you can teach people the word in all
[40:55] situations
[40:55] [Music]
[40:57] you teach them what the word of God says
[40:58] whether it's a Believer whether it's an
[41:01] unbeliever you teach them the word of
[41:03] God amen amen if somebody's got a
[41:05] problem and you know they're so helpless
[41:07] and hopeless you tell them you know what
[41:08] that's why Jesus Christ came yes we
[41:11] can't do things on our own but Jesus
[41:13] Christ came to die for our sins and he
[41:16] paid the price Amen on our behalf
[41:20] they say what do you mean
[41:21] they say well Jesus took my sin on the
[41:24] cross amen well why did he take my sin
[41:26] on the cross amen so that I can train my
[41:29] sick body for his well body

[41:52] my troubled mind for his sound mind amen
[41:55] that's what the cross was for amen if we
[41:57] can only realize the benefit of the
[41:59] Cross and when he said it is finished it
[42:02] is finished and we can live in
[42:03] resurrection power we can live with that
[42:05] anointing in our lives amen that we
[42:08] become a blessing to others we become

[42:16] the voice of faith
[42:19] amen
[42:22] we ought to be so encouraging
[42:24] no matter the sinner
[42:27] because what did Jesus say
[42:30] you remember he spoke about that man
[42:32] who owed the Lord something some money
[42:37] and the Lord forgave him
[42:39] yes I think it was just let's call it a
[42:41] million
[42:43] he owed the Lord a million and the Lord
[42:45] forgave him then he had he accepted the
[42:48] Lord's forgiveness and he went away and
[42:50] somebody owed him a hundred and he
[42:52] didn't refuse to forgive them
[42:56] then the Lord says you Wicked person
[42:59] I forgave you but you can't forgive
[43:01] others yeah
[43:02] yeah amen
[43:04] now I want you to know if it had not
[43:06] been for the Lord Jesus Christ all of us
[43:08] would be going to hell amen

[43:14] none of us are standing here today based
[43:17] on our own righteousness
[43:19] my righteousness is like filthy
[43:22] amen hallelujah but when the Bible is
[43:26] saying let your light so shine before
[43:27] men that's Jesus shining to me amen amen
[43:31] if there's any good in me Jesus Christ
[43:33] yes yes amen
[43:37] I know amen I mean if you can testify
[43:40] that you are not the same person that

[44:03] believe the person you have become
[44:07] and they secretly admire you because
[44:10] What the Lord Has Done For You

[44:16] more do you become carriers of his grace

[45:05] others to come and disturb your
[45:07] anointing yes the atmosphere of perfect
[45:09] faith that you're building up don't
[45:11] allow others to come in Satan will come
[45:13] in like that
[45:14] to discourage you
[45:16] let's say one negative word about you
[45:18] and Satan knows your weaknesses your
[45:21] weak spot so you get somebody to come
[45:23] and say something to attack you and
[45:25] bring you down in the flesh yes
[45:28] Satan works from the outside going in
[45:32] so he knows when you attack your flesh
[45:34] and he's just say now they say you're so
[45:37] ugly
[45:37] now you become down in your spirit

[45:49] God builds you up by faith amen and when
[45:53] they tell you ugly you tell them I'm
[45:54] fearfully and wonderfully made amen amen
[45:58] the Lord says when I was conceived in
[46:00] the innermost Parts amen
[46:03] he knew me and God says I know the plans
[46:06] I have for you amen amen and you tell
[46:08] them amen and maybe an ugly duckling now

[55:18] we are to be proclaiming the message of
[55:20] the hour amen amen we've got to rise up
[55:23] and God is raising up sons and daughters
[55:25] in this hour amen who lose our shyness

[55:42] say Lord I'm Available come on let him
[55:44] hear you say Lord I'm Available
[55:47] amen amen let's go to this quote the
[55:49] amen of God Faithful and True
[55:53] Hallelujah we'll try and bring it to a
[55:56] close now with this
[55:57] praise the Lord
[55:59] amen
[56:02] but it's also in the church age book
[56:07] I want you to see something that
[56:09] something that may be found that over
[56:11] people don't have this expectation like
[56:14] when we preach it it sounds foreign to
[56:16] them oh it sounds like
[56:18] expectation is too high
[56:20] the very works of Jesus
[56:24] the very acts of Jesus
[56:26] you want to do that
[56:29] as he is so is she
[56:32] amen
[56:34] so we got there the amen of God
[56:37] faithful and true
[56:40] how many of you want God to reveal
[56:42] himself to you the only time the only
[56:44] way God would reveal himself in this
[56:46] hour is through his prophet
[56:48] yes right so let's follow his his uh
[56:50] teaching here is going to bring us very
[56:53] nicely and we'll get a clear
[56:54] understanding of the message of the hour
[56:55] since Jesus went away till now right
[56:58] the amen of God for faithful and true
[57:00] will reveal himself and it will be by my
[57:04] prophet
[57:05] amen
[57:07] oh yes that is so revelation 10. as in
[57:11] the days of the voice of the seventh
[57:12] messenger when he shall began to sound
[57:14] the mystery of God should be finished as
[57:17] he had declared to his servants the
[57:18] prophets there it is he's sending a
[57:21] Vindicated Prophet he's sending a
[57:23] prophet after almost 2 000 years
[57:27] he's sending someone who is so far away
[57:29] from organization education and the
[57:33] world of religion
[57:34] that as John the Baptist and Elijah of
[57:37] old you will hear only from God and he
[57:40] will have thus save the Lord and speak
[57:42] for God amen amen
[57:44] amen yes
[57:47] I have a prophet who has not said the
[57:49] Lord yes
[57:51] my Prophet is William Branham
[57:55] amen I think too many of us don't say
[57:57] that enough amen that's right
[58:01] others want to say they follow bushiri
[58:03] yeah and uh T.B Joshua
[58:07] okay
[58:12] snakes and Austin
[58:15] yes Colgate adverts
[58:19] amen
[58:21] they're proud
[58:23] but I follow them prophet of Malachi 4 5
[58:27] and 6. Revelation 10 7.
[58:30] amen hallelujah amen
[58:34] you really want to shock people you must
[58:36] tell them they won't know what to say
[58:37] they don't know what to say when you
[58:38] tell them that
[58:43] you silence the enemy
[58:46] amen amen you silence the enemy yes
[58:49] it's coming time for identification
[58:53] so yes that said the Lord and he speaks
[58:56] for God
[58:57] he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it
[59:01] is declared in Malachi 4 5 and 6 will
[59:03] turn the hearts of the children back to
[59:05] the fathers he will bring back the elect
[59:07] of the last day and they will hear a
[59:10] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[59:13] as it was with Paul
[59:16] he will restore the truth as they had it
[59:20] and here's what I want to get to and
[59:22] those elect with him are we with him yes
[59:24] amen can I see your hands are you with
[59:26] him amen we got an army here tonight
[59:29] we're going to feel the same here
[59:31] tonight we got a super Army here tonight
[59:34] amen we are with the prophets amen like
[59:37] Joshua and Caleb student Moses we are
[59:39] with our Prophets
[59:42] and those elected him in that day will
[59:45] be the ones or can you imagine speaking
[59:48] back there but we are living in it now
[59:49] yeah
[59:51] amen doesn't it make our hearts grow now
[59:55] we'll be the ones who truly manifest the
[59:57] Lord
[59:58] and be his body and be his voice and
[1:00:02] perform his what amen and perform his
[1:00:05] Works amen amen hallelujah amen
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:10] now notice he says that they will
[1:00:12] manifest the Lord be his body be his
[1:00:15] voice and perform his words that's God's
[1:00:18] expectation of us
[1:00:20] God doesn't have a mute bride yes
[1:00:23] yes God doesn't have a different damn
[1:00:25] right yeah
[1:00:26] this break in here and she can speak yes
[1:00:29] amen hallelujah and she perform his
[1:00:33] works
[1:00:35] so here's a momentary consideration of
[1:00:37] the church history will prove how
[1:00:39] accurate this thought is so here's the
[1:00:40] church history now in a few sentences in
[1:00:43] the Dark Ages the word was almost
[1:00:45] entirely lost to the people
[1:00:47] are you young people here you gotta
[1:00:49] understand this
[1:00:51] because sometimes maybe you haven't read
[1:00:54] the church age book you don't know that
[1:00:56] people don't have an understanding of
[1:00:57] the Bible
[1:01:00] has taken they a seminary teaching
[1:01:04] and they have taken the college teaching
[1:01:06] and what one man wrote A Commentary
[1:01:09] about the Bible and what his opinion is
[1:01:11] about the scripture
[1:01:16] so they have substituted the true
[1:01:18] revelation of the word of God for
[1:01:20] man-made Creeds dogmas teaching
[1:01:24] the Catholic church has taken the Bible
[1:01:25] away from the people and they must
[1:01:27] listen to their priest only
[1:01:29] somebody reads for them somebody recites
[1:01:31] somebody sings Everything the word is
[1:01:34] taken away from the people
[1:01:35] we've got to understand that right
[1:01:37] even you speak to denominational friends
[1:01:39] they only can quote
[1:01:42] the blessings and the promises of God
[1:01:44] that they want and they hate them not
[1:01:46] the tale and this and that and that
[1:01:48] yes right the very selective in the
[1:01:50] scripture but here's the word of God
[1:01:53] true
[1:01:54] will it work for anyone who plays it by
[1:01:57] faith
[1:01:58] so that's why it works for them
[1:02:00] but they are selective
[1:02:02] right
[1:02:04] so it was lost to the people but God
[1:02:06] said Luther with the word
[1:02:08] the Lutheran spoke for God at one time
[1:02:10] now we don't want to be like these
[1:02:11] people who speak for God for a certain
[1:02:14] season yeah and then he stops
[1:02:17] no no no no no
[1:02:18] I'm saying this with all humility
[1:02:21] and please understand what I'm saying
[1:02:23] If the message church ever leaves God
[1:02:25] and stops speaking for God then we need
[1:02:28] to leave them
[1:02:29] you understand what I'm saying like how
[1:02:32] God left the lutherans
[1:02:34] and he moved on
[1:02:36] yeah because this so-called messaging is
[1:02:38] not a message thing we are Christians
[1:02:41] that's who we are we are Christians
[1:02:43] right but just so that we understand we
[1:02:45] we say message right
[1:02:48] God said Luther was the word the
[1:02:50] Lutheran spoke for God at one time they
[1:02:52] organized
[1:02:54] and again the pure word was lost for
[1:02:56] organization tends towards dogma and
[1:02:59] Creeds not simple word they no longer
[1:03:02] they could no longer speak for God
[1:03:06] so don't think God
[1:03:08] doesn't have a plan in a program
[1:03:10] then God sent Wesley he was the voice
[1:03:14] with the word in his day the people who
[1:03:16] took his Revelation from God became the
[1:03:19] living Epistles rated known of all men
[1:03:21] for their generation when the method has
[1:03:23] failed God raised up others now he's
[1:03:25] going to talk about the Pentecostals
[1:03:27] here you can group all your
[1:03:29] denominations here
[1:03:30] so it is gone on through the years until
[1:03:34] now here we are in our day
[1:03:36] in this last day
[1:03:38] there is again another people
[1:03:41] in the land who under their messenger
[1:03:47] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:03:53] yes sir the church was is no longer the
[1:03:57] mouthpiece of God it is its own
[1:03:59] mouthpiece
[1:04:00] so God is turning on her
[1:04:04] so let's learn now because remember God
[1:04:06] is the same if we become our own
[1:04:09] mouthpiece
[1:04:11] he will turn on us
[1:04:16] not the prophet says if God doesn't deal
[1:04:19] with this generation
[1:04:20] the same way dealt with Sodom and
[1:04:22] Gomorrah you must raise them up and
[1:04:24] apologize yes
[1:04:25] so God will do the same thing here
[1:04:28] God is Not respecter of persons
[1:04:31] if we don't keep his word
[1:04:33] it will turn on us
[1:04:36] but now watch God has got a plan and I'm
[1:04:39] so glad I'm a part of this plan and I
[1:04:40] know you are too he will confound her
[1:04:44] through the prophet and the bride
[1:04:48] for the voice of God will be in her oh
[1:04:52] my word oh how I've got to protect your
[1:04:55] anointing Lord because your voice is in
[1:04:58] me Lord Jesus your voice is in me
[1:05:01] amen yes it is for it says in the last
[1:05:04] chapter of Revelation the spirit and the
[1:05:07] bride say come amen come
[1:05:11] once more the world will get direct from
[1:05:13] God as that Pentecost but of course the
[1:05:17] word bride will be rejected as in the
[1:05:20] first age
[1:05:24] Hallelujah
