You see, sometimes when I'm studying, if I hear somebody singing, I'll leave that one. Then I'll dance a little bit because I like singing. &gt;&gt; God bless you. May, let's stand as we open our Bibles. Matthew chapter 24. &gt;&gt; Matthew 24. Your pastor is a very good pastor. He came to Zimbabwe. He preached very well in our churches. So they're still asking to come back to finish. Not to finish. You can't finish to preach Jesus Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just come and continue. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; When he's tired, he comes back and after some months you come back again. So we really appreciate his ministry. H we northerners. I don't know you sers but we northerners there. We really appreciate his ministry. Please when you hear him saying I'm going to Zimbabwe, please tell him go go quickly. &gt;&gt; We'll pray for you. &gt;&gt; So as the prophet says, if you pray for me, it's you who are who benefit. &gt;&gt; You see, if you pray for me, you'll be benefiting. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So why can't you pray for me? &gt;&gt; You benefit. If you pray for him, it's who is benefiting. &gt;&gt; That's why you can hear the the the Bible says always let's pray for one another. Yes. &gt;&gt; So it's actually for you who be benefiting. &gt;&gt; Are you there? Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; Yes. So the brothers, I didn't give you some my notes because I'm going to pick them there. So you have to forgive me. But I know you are a star to pick those quotations. You know, &gt;&gt; I won't preach anything else but what you believe here. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see remember your your the old pastor pastor Ron Genkin he used to be my friend. &gt;&gt; I always testify you know that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And my first reading classes is the one who what who who bought them for me. &gt;&gt; They're still there. You see? &gt;&gt; Okay. Fine. Are we there? Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 12:1. And Jesus And Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple. Verse two. And Jesus said unto them, "See you not all these things? Very I say unto you, there shall be not be left here one stone upon another, &gt;&gt; that shall not be thrown down." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Verse three. &gt;&gt; And as he sat upon the mount of olives, the disciples came unto him privately. I like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They came to him &gt;&gt; privately. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Others they've gone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they said let's go to him privately. They wanted to ask other things. Now he says tell us saying tell us there there are three questions there as you see &gt;&gt; they wanted to ask these three questions. He says tell us when shall these things be? First question. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Number two. And what shall be the sign of thy coming? &gt;&gt; Question number two. Question number three. And of the end of the world. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless these word. You may take your seats. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can hear no uh these disciples asking these three questions. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I was telling where I preached on Sunday about this that I I had some months preaching about the three questions. &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to preach about three questions. I'm just going to let's fellowship all of us together about the scriptural signs. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you see about the scriptural signs. We might not finish but I'll pick there what the prophecy about the scriptural signs but basing on these questions maybe you can base on one of it. What shall be the sign of thy coming? Not exactly on into that &gt;&gt; but just to look into scriptural signs. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Either of our DAY OR WHATEVER ANY scriptural sign &gt;&gt; the meaning of the meaning of any scriptural sign. &gt;&gt; How do you interpret it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you view it? &gt;&gt; Because there are many signs. But as a Christian or AS A MESSAGE BELIEVER, YOU MUST BE IN A position &gt;&gt; to interpret any scriptural sign. &gt;&gt; EITHER IT'S OF GOD OR IT'S NOT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SUPPOSED IN A position &gt;&gt; to interpret. &gt;&gt; That's why the disciples came to him privately. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ASKING THOSE THREE QUESTIONS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY they were they are very important questions here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this? &gt;&gt; Yes. When shall these things be? &gt;&gt; AND WHAT SHALL BE THE SIGN OF THY COMING? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; But he was there. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU REMEMBER HE WAS PREACHING ABOUT HIS COMING. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; His death and resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And his coming. &gt;&gt; But they asking, "What is the SIGN OF THY COMING?" &gt;&gt; BUT WERE THEY NOT WITH HIM? &gt;&gt; They were with him. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IS THE SIGN OF THY COMING. YOU SEE AND THE END OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE END. &gt;&gt; WHAT GOING TO BE THE SIGN? THE SIGN OF the end of THE WORLD. THEY WANTED TO KNOW ALL THOSE THINGS. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; As I was saying on Sunday, &gt;&gt; you know in our country maybe you have heard also here the audio that was going on around on this social media of that is it a prophetist whatever she was telling people about the end of the world. Yeah, &gt;&gt; in 3 days whatever darkness whatever what you are saying but I'm still here &gt;&gt; and you still there &gt;&gt; so that's why I'm saying HOW IMPORTANT THESE questions were. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the CHRIST KNEW THAT ALL THESE PERSONS you are going to meet them. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU GO down with this chapter &gt;&gt; of Matthew 24 FROM VERSE ONE UP TO THE END, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE WHY the disciples they asked these questions. &gt;&gt; And after that Christ, HE WAS TELLING them &gt;&gt; about false Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; False prophets, &gt;&gt; isn't it? So, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; AND ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT THE END, &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE CAREFUL. AND ALSO, IF you &gt;&gt; if you read &gt;&gt; the sixth seal, &gt;&gt; OUR PROPHET, &gt;&gt; HE WAS PARDONING MATTHEW 24 with the sixth seal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, what was happening here? &gt;&gt; You can see it in the sixth seal. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I don't have time to go there, &gt;&gt; but I'm just trying to tell you something about the signs &gt;&gt; tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I'm standing here, I'm a sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have teachers here. If you got a teacher, &gt;&gt; when a teacher stand in front of students, &gt;&gt; according to the students is a sign. Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're expecting something from a teacher, A VOICE &gt;&gt; FOR HIM TO STAND THERE IS A SIGN. &gt;&gt; IF A TEACHER JUST GO AND stand like this, looking the students like this, &gt;&gt; what going to be the answer of the students? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; According to them is a sign. &gt;&gt; They want to write exams. They want to pass. But they they went to school and the sign is dumb. He can't speak that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's start our thing. I I just give you some few tips so that we won't finish in the message scriptural science of the time. Brother uh let's go. That was pre 1964 7410 paragraph 22. You see what the prophet is saying about these signs? &gt;&gt; Ah thank you Esther. I told you &gt;&gt; God gives signs. &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? Scriptural &gt;&gt; signs. &gt;&gt; Scriptural signs of a voice. You see remember when Moses Was WAS A SIGN GIVEN FOR? WHAT? What's a sign given for? What was a sign given for? The the PURPOSE OF A SIGN. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A SIGN IS IS TO attract &gt;&gt; attention. &gt;&gt; Any sign either natural &gt;&gt; or spiritual &gt;&gt; is there to attract your attention. If you are driving, even if you see a natural billboard, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; telling you that there's stairs 5 kilometers &gt;&gt; is there to attract whose attention? &gt;&gt; YOUR ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SIGN. &gt;&gt; Like if you IF IF YOU GO IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE dictionary says describing a sign says it's an event. M &gt;&gt; that is experienced as indicating important things &gt;&gt; to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was A SIGN FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A SIGN FROM HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; That's a sign. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER A SIGN YOU MIGHT SEE &gt;&gt; EITHER NATURAL or &gt;&gt; scripture &gt;&gt; is there to draw your attention. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT ATTENTION MEANS A LOT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY EVEN IN THE SCRIPTURES, &gt;&gt; you know, there was a scripture says how retest &gt;&gt; you MUST KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THOSE SIGNS. &gt;&gt; Especially scriptural signs. You must know HOW TO INTERPRETATE. &gt;&gt; HOW DID THE STAR message believe us? &gt;&gt; How did the star bride? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Says is to ATTRACT ATTENTION. A SIGN IS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; BUT IF THE SIGN DOESN'T HAVE ANY VOICE, &gt;&gt; THEN THE SIGN is not right. &gt;&gt; It might be a GOOD SIGN, BUT WITHOUT A VOICE, &gt;&gt; without a message, &gt;&gt; THAT SIGN IS NOT GOOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S SOMETHING DUMB. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST IGNORE THAT. YEAH. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, THEN THE SON IS NOT LIKE AND IF THE SON GIVE THE SAME ODD ECCLESIASTICAL VOICE, &gt;&gt; that sign isn't from God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF THAT VOICE HASN'T GOT a change, &gt;&gt; and that change must be scriptural sign. &gt;&gt; Must be scriptural voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's go to part four. Our pick out of 40 super sign super the super this super sign that was pre 1963 1129. Amen. You you you have heard the prophet say about a sign. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that so attractive attention? &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's see here what about in the message super sign paragraph 40. Let's see what the prophecy about these signs where remember let's concern about scriptural signs &gt;&gt; you see sometimes we waste our time by going to the negative all of THE TIME SAYS PROPHETS ARE THE CHIEF &gt;&gt; SIGN &gt;&gt; AMOS 3 &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT DO ANYTHING &gt;&gt; UNLESS HE REVEALED HIS SECRET TO &gt;&gt; THE 70 PROPHETS &gt;&gt; SO AS WE ARE SPEAKING PROPHETS ARE THE CHIEF side &gt;&gt; is So &gt;&gt; CHIEF GOD'S CHIEF SIDE IS A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; NOW I'M GOING TO SPEAK A FEW MINUTES ABOUT THAT. BUT HIS WORD MADE manifest &gt;&gt; for that age. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's THE REASON A PROPHET IS ALWAYS GOD'S CHILDREN SHINE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY EVEN MALACHI 4 AS WE ARE SITTING HERE &gt;&gt; IS IT CLEAR TO US? &gt;&gt; BEHOLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID I &gt;&gt; WILL SEND &gt;&gt; YOU ELIJAH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; The prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not sending to everyone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's you and your prophet. &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold, I sent you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The prophet. &gt;&gt; A chief sign. &gt;&gt; That chief sign must be scriptural. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF THAT CHIEF SIGN IS NOT SCRIPTURE THAT'S WHY MATTHEW 24 IF YOU GO DOWN WITH it as I said you can HEAR CHRIST SPEAK ABOUT FALSE Christ &gt;&gt; as you know all the prophet teaches when you hear the word Christ means anointed &gt;&gt; don't a false &gt;&gt; A FALSE ANOINTED ONE FALSE CHRIST IS SOMEBODY WHO IS ANOINTED &gt;&gt; YES &gt;&gt; IT IS A SIGN TO THE PEOPLE &gt;&gt; YES &gt;&gt; FOR FALSE ANOINTED &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A SIGN IS ATTRACTING PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT SIGN IS IN SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Are you GETTING THAT NOW? &gt;&gt; FALSE PROPHETS. HOW MANY PROPHETS YOU HAVE TODAY? &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SIGNS ALL OVER &gt;&gt; ATTRACTING PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING THAT. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SIGN TO THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WE WE ARE MEASURING TONIGHT ON THE SCRIPTURAL SIGNS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE OF A SCRIPTURE SIGN. &gt;&gt; GOD SENT A PROPHET IN OUR GENERATION. [Applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Are you here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I enjoyed when the pastor was about was talking about the shout now. Hey, we are here because of the shout. &gt;&gt; Together the what? &gt;&gt; SAINTS, HERE WE ARE BECAUSE OF THE SHOUT. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD SENT A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ACHIEVE SIGN &gt;&gt; IN OUR DAY WITH A SCRIPTURAL VOICE. &gt;&gt; AND WE could see &gt;&gt; that sign it attracted &gt;&gt; our attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we are here. &gt;&gt; Because you have been attracted by that sign. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, THERE ARE HIS WORD MANIFEST. Where are we? Okay, let's go. And that's THE REASON A PROPHET IS ALWAYS A CHIEF SIGN. HE HAS NEVER SENT A judgment upon the earth without first sending a prophet. &gt;&gt; Just see and search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; A prophet is the chief sign OF GOD TO HIS PEOPLE that he has sent this person. &gt;&gt; This certain person like Noah, like Moses, and Elijah and the prophets. HE SENT THEM TO MANIFEST THE WAY FOR THAT &gt;&gt; TO GIVE HIS PEOPLE A &gt;&gt; WARNING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER MOSES? WHAT HAPPENED TO MOSES? &gt;&gt; Moses saw the burning bush. &gt;&gt; It was a sign. &gt;&gt; The bush was burning &gt;&gt; but not being consumed. &gt;&gt; It was a sign. &gt;&gt; But behind that sign, &gt;&gt; there's a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WAS A SIGN FIRST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES WHEN HE SAW THE SIGN WHAT HIS ATTENTION &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; was what? &gt;&gt; It brought his attention. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he looked at that sign. &gt;&gt; He was waiting FOR SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; A SCRIPTUAL SIGN. &gt;&gt; OKAY. Let's go, brother. Let's go. Let's go. First one, brother. Let's go. This one. Christ is identified the same in all generations. 64 0415 you see let's go 21 AND THEN EVERY son has a voice oh brother this one hey you must come to my church my brother why are you here brother you want me to hire you listen to thism Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THEN EVERY SIGN HAS A VOICE BEHIND IT. &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES SAW THE SIGN, &gt;&gt; HE WAS WAITING FOR THE VOICE. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY YOU YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT YOU HAVE READ BEFORE. A SIGN WITHOUT A VOICE. WHAT DO you &gt;&gt; It's not good. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MOSES SAW THE SIGN, HE WAS WAITING FOR THE VOICE. &gt;&gt; AND THE VOICE CAME. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THE VOICE CAME &gt;&gt; AND MOSES WAS COMMISSIONED BY GOD &gt;&gt; TO GO TO &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A VOICE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I have come &gt;&gt; to deliver my &gt;&gt; people. &gt;&gt; That's why Moses &gt;&gt; when he saw the sign and the voice spoke &gt;&gt; when he went to Pharaoh &gt;&gt; he was so courageous &gt;&gt; because he knew that that was a scripture. And when when he was talking to Pharaoh, &gt;&gt; he didn't say please, please. He says, "No, no. Let my people &gt;&gt; because he knew what he was doing. It was scripture." &gt;&gt; He had a voice. He saw a sign, a script sign. And behind THAT SCRIPT SIGN, THERE WAS A VOICE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY TONIGHT, BROTHER, SISTER, &gt;&gt; WE HAD THE VOICE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE GATHERED US HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE CAN SHOUT AND DANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are you following that? THE SAME IT MUST BE A SCRIPTURE SIGN AND THEN THE SIGN IS ACCOMPANIED BY A VOICE LIKE MOSES &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WENT DOWN IN EGYPT. THE VOICE OF THE FIRST SIDE, THE FORCE OF THE SECOND SIDE, AND EVERY GREAT thing that happens with God that gives a sign, &gt;&gt; THERE'S A VOICE FOLLOWS THAT SIGN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SCRIPTURAL, &gt;&gt; NOT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT SCRIPTURAL. &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL DO HAVE ALSO SIGNS, &gt;&gt; BUT THE SIGN OF THE DEVIL THOUGH PEOPLE ARE BEING ATTRACTED, BUT THEY'RE NOT SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; They're not scripture. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE &gt;&gt; AS GOD CALLED US, &gt;&gt; WE MUST BE IN A POSITION TO DISCERN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And to know &gt;&gt; this is scriptural signs &gt;&gt; and scriptural voices. &gt;&gt; Like Jonah when he was delivered from the battle of of the world, that was a sign. &gt;&gt; THEN HIS VOICE WAS REPAIRED. YEAH. &gt;&gt; IN 40 DAYS YOU YOU PERISH. &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS ALWAYS A VOICE GOING WITH THE &gt;&gt; A VOICE GOES WITH THE &gt;&gt; SAME. &gt;&gt; Are we there? &gt;&gt; Brother 110. Let's just skip a lot of things. The voice of the sign 64 0214 0214 110. Let's go. They see Jonah there. &gt;&gt; And the prophet say Jonah was a sign. &gt;&gt; See, let me go FOR ONE THING. JONAH THE PROPHET WAS A SIGN. &gt;&gt; HIS SIGN WAS WHEN HE spit the world spit him out &gt;&gt; upon the bank. &gt;&gt; That was a sign. &gt;&gt; Then people were he &gt;&gt; fished for a living. &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; AND THEY SEEN THE WORLD GOD COME IN &gt;&gt; THIS GOD OF THE SEA &gt;&gt; AND TAKE THE PROPHET AND SPIT HIM OUT upon the BANK &gt;&gt; TO GIVE THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; AND DOWN THE BANK HE WENT &gt;&gt; THERE WAS THE signh the fish was the sign &gt;&gt; coming. &gt;&gt; They used to worship a ship a a fish god. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY SAW THAT SIGN COMING &gt;&gt; THEY WERE VERY HAPPY. BUT BEHIND EVERY SIGN THERE'S a &gt;&gt; that THERE'S A &gt;&gt; THE VOICE MUST BE &gt;&gt; the voice must be &gt;&gt; scripture. &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? &gt;&gt; SO THEY SAW THE SIGN COMING &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE HAPPY BECAUSE THEY USED TO WORSHIP A FISH GOD. &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THEM IT WAS A SIGN &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE WAITING and that sign attracted them. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT BEHIND THAT SIDE THERE WAS A VOICE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE VOICE? REPAIR AND PER OR PERISH &gt;&gt; BEFORE GOD STRUCK THAT NATION &gt;&gt; TO TEAR IT TO PIECES AND sing it beneath the sea. &gt;&gt; HE SENT A PROPHET WITH HIS VOICE. HE GAVE A SIGN, A SUPERNATURAL SIGHT. &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They repented. All of them. M &gt;&gt; because of the scriptural sign &gt;&gt; and the scriptural sign behind it there was a scriptural voice. &gt;&gt; We are here because of a scriptural voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There are many sides. &gt;&gt; There are many voices &gt;&gt; but are they scriptural? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go, brother.

Listen to this now. What is the city? The spoken word is original city. Uh I think brother it might be a different um this 62 0318 the spoken word is what part of 241 according to my mind here says now there's been three different kinds of seed planted &gt;&gt; are getting that now &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; right let's go a denominational there different of course. &gt;&gt; See now there's been three different kinds of seed planted &gt;&gt; A DENOMINATIONAL by Billy Graham. &gt;&gt; He was a sign &gt;&gt; to this denominational system &gt;&gt; and THE PROPHET SAYING HE WAS THE HEAD PLUNDER. HE'S A &gt;&gt; A BIG FOLLOWING AND THERE'S A BIG FOLLOWING BUT HE WAS THE HEAD PLUNDER of this denominational system. &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? Was it not a sign? &gt;&gt; And with a voice behind &gt;&gt; that's why it was blinding. You see &gt;&gt; he was hit by all over us for the Pentecostals SINCE PENTECOST HAS BEEN ALSO PLANTED. I'M TALKING ABOUT ORGANIZATION NOW. SINCE THEN THE WORD HAS BEEN ALSO &gt;&gt; PLANTED. &gt;&gt; PLANTED. &gt;&gt; There are three seats. That's why THERE ARE THREE SEEDS. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THOSE HEAD PLANTERS. &gt;&gt; The one who PLANTED THE DENOMINATIONAL ONE is &gt;&gt; the ONE WHO PLANTED THE PENTECOSTAL IS &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO PLANTED THE WORD IS who &gt;&gt; William &gt;&gt; but must have fition time or heaven's time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Could have been planted. &gt;&gt; I see. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THOSE WERE SIGNS. YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID? PROPHETS ARE CHIEF &gt;&gt; SIGNS. BUT WHAT WAS HE NOT A SIGN TO THE DENOMINATION? &gt;&gt; Was he not? &gt;&gt; ROBERT WAS SIGNED TO THE PENTECOSTAL. &gt;&gt; UP TO NOW THEY DOING WONDERS. WHATEVER ALL THOSE THINGS, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Behind every &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; scriptural behind every sign, there's his voice behind. &gt;&gt; Yes. You see now let's go. I'm talking. Okay, let's go. See, say stop. You have two. Understand, folks. I am saying this no more unless God tells me. &gt;&gt; I want you to get this good and clear. Three seeds have been &gt;&gt; planted. Let's go, brother. Next chapter. THAT'S THE REASON THE PLANTING IS ABOUT OVER. SEE, IT'S ALL OVER. SEEDS MUST BE planted before rain falls. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. Say otherwise THE SPIRIT NOW YOU ARE GOING TO disagree there but hold on just a minute seeds must be planted and then the rainforce &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; to water the seed. Is that right? &gt;&gt; I think you can see what happened now. IS THERE ANYBODY IN HERE THAT UNDERSTANDS Hebrew laws Hebrew words? All right. You you look it if you want to. Now we are hearing so much and so many organizations and everything else talking about we are in the larger ring. &gt;&gt; This is nonsense. &gt;&gt; No such a thing. Oh, something is happening. I can just see it passing before me. IT'S DONE. CAUGHT THE SPIRIT. SEE, I MEAN, I know this is the truth. IT'S THUS SAYS THE LORD BY VISION. SEE, &gt;&gt; JUST MOVING COMING HARD LOOK DOWN HERE. NOW, you can see what the prophet is saying here. I I don't have time to go over all those. What what's next? Uh let's you see you can read it on your own. But what you are to see here, the seeds that have been planted, you've seen the way &gt;&gt; some the denominational seed, &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal seed &gt;&gt; and the word. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; who planted they were chief planters &gt;&gt; who planted those seeds &gt;&gt; AND WITH A VOICE BEHIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; NOW, HERE WE ARE. GOD SENT A PROPHET TO US &gt;&gt; WHO PLANNED the word &gt;&gt; the message of OUR DAY. &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS ASSIGNED TO US &gt;&gt; WITH A SCRIPTURE VOICE BEHIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S why now we can see &gt;&gt; the seed &gt;&gt; is back again. &gt;&gt; The spoken word &gt;&gt; is the original seed. What was there in the beginning &gt;&gt; is speak again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What started in the beginning &gt;&gt; is speak again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was what Adam lost &gt;&gt; is back again. &gt;&gt; Because this message &gt;&gt; is a message of restoration. Not a message of replacing. It's a of replacement. It's a message of restoration. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Jews wanted to see the sign. Oh, let me finish friends. Wow. &gt;&gt; How many minutes friends? 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; Sure. 5 minutes. We have got a lot of things. We can't finish this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Either I've got more whatever I can't. That's why we have five ministry. This one will preach whatever this one this one also comes. I'm not here to finish everything. You can't finish to preach Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let me just this one then you see a super sign. &gt;&gt; Hey super sign you see. Okay still internal sign. Brother let's just find this one in the message 610117. Let me I'm just reading. I don't want to to to explain. Now, I BELIEVE THAT IN ISAIAH 9:6, WHEN ISRAEL had asked for a sign, God said, "I'll give them an everlasting sign, &gt;&gt; A SIGN, AN ETERNAL SIGN, &gt;&gt; ONE THAT WILL be forever." SEE, A VIRGIN SHALL conceive &gt;&gt; that will be a sign, and that one that will be born of her, his name shall be called counselor, the prince of peace, the mighty God, and the everlasting father. AND I BELIEVE that Jesus MET EVERY DESCRIPTION OF EVERY PROMISE THAT JEHOVAH made as the coming king and messiah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE HE WAS A SIGN. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE JEWS ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR A SIGN. &gt;&gt; THE SIGN OF THE coming of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A SUPER SIGN. HE POSSESSED THE GATES. &gt;&gt; He possessed the gates. The super sign. He possessed the gates. Not only did he he he that but those who had died in faith he had he led captive captive &gt;&gt; ascended on high &gt;&gt; and gave gifts unto men. &gt;&gt; That's Abraham's super seed. &gt;&gt; That's the royal seed. JESUS CHRIST THE SUPER SIGN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. REMEMBER IT WAS AN EVERLASTING SIGN, A supernatural everlasting sign. Jesus was &gt;&gt; he arose from the dead. &gt;&gt; They could not hold him. Death, hell, or the grave could not hold him. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8 &gt;&gt; as I say, he is the same yesterday, today, and forever &gt;&gt; to show this SUPER SIGN IN THIS AGE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Behind every sign there's a voice. &gt;&gt; Let the voice be scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are living in the age of science. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For signs, &gt;&gt; BUT MAY GOD HELP US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO KNOW how to read and to interpret &gt;&gt; these signs. Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is scriptural voice. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SIGNS THAT CAN TAKE US TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; VOICES THAT CAN TAKE US BACK TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY EVEN THE PROPHET IN THAT VISION, &gt;&gt; he screamed. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; HUH? THE BRIDE WAS DRIFTING. &gt;&gt; I believe THEY WERE LISTENING TO THAT OTHER VOICES. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SCREAMED. WHAT DID HE SAY? STAY IN LINE. &gt;&gt; STAY IN LINE. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ONCE IN LINE. BUT THEY STARTED DRIFTING. YOU KNOW THE WORD DRIFTING IS YOU CANNOT EASILY BE AWAY FROM THE LINE. No &gt;&gt; you can go little by little. &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT NOTICE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE DRIFTING &gt;&gt; BUT THE BRIDE WAS DRIFTING &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET IS OH STAY IN LINE. &gt;&gt; Stay in line. &gt;&gt; We are in the time. &gt;&gt; We're in the end time. &gt;&gt; There are many signs. &gt;&gt; Amen. eh trying to deceive people. &gt;&gt; But we thank God in Matthew 24 Jesus Christ with his disciples, what did he say? &gt;&gt; If it were possible, &gt;&gt; the elect would be deceived. But it's NOT POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; ALL THE SIGNS will come. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY WILL COME THE SIGNS &gt;&gt; WHATEVER. BUT we have to know our we &gt;&gt; as the prophet says, &gt;&gt; you as a message believer &gt;&gt; part of six &gt;&gt; in the message the ark. &gt;&gt; He said as amen we live in three elements. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The humanistic element &gt;&gt; the divine revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the vision one &gt;&gt; brother &gt;&gt; the humanistic we don't want to stay there &gt;&gt; oh thank you brother is him well now there's three element I've closed mine but he put it directly now there's three elements that people live in first is the humanistic &gt;&gt; second is divine revelation &gt;&gt; and the third is vision &gt;&gt; brother you can dwell the whole night on the divine Revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR WHEN YOU SEE A SIGN, &gt;&gt; THAT SIGN whatever it might say that voice THAT SIGN MUST BE SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN A DIVINE REVELATION STRIKES YOU, &gt;&gt; you are part of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN A SCRIPTURE VOICE SPEAKS TO YOU, &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HUH? WHEN GOD SPOKE TO MOSES, &gt;&gt; HUH, WHEN HE SAW THE SIGN AND THE VOICE OF GOD SPOKE TO MOSES, WHAT HAPPENED? MOSES, HE KNEW THAT THIS IS GOD, nothing else. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE ALSO WITH THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; We can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this day and age, &gt;&gt; many voices are going over. &gt;&gt; Some are even up to the extent of say, do you believe this sign? M &gt;&gt; maybe you've heard of that &gt;&gt; some going to that extent why do you BELIEVE THIS SIGN &gt;&gt; WHATEVER I SAY &gt;&gt; BEHIND EVERY SIGN &gt;&gt; THEY say &gt;&gt; a VOICE LET THAT VOICE BE SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; LET THAT VOICE BE IN LINE WITH THE WORD &gt;&gt; AMEN &gt;&gt; FROM THE BIBLE FROM COVER TO COVER IF IT IS NOT PLEASE &gt;&gt; WASH YOUR hands &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and run away &gt;&gt; run for your Yes. &gt;&gt; Believe the sign. Tell me. Yes, I believe the chief sign &gt;&gt; with a scriptural voice. &gt;&gt; What Moses saw &gt;&gt; what happened to Jonah? What happened to Elijah? What happened to those who saw the signs and God spoke? &gt;&gt; You see, not this make up many many things. What is going on now? &gt;&gt; You see, because of this fourth dimension, these YouTubes and so forth, they're giving us a lot of voices. Yes. &gt;&gt; A lot of signs which ARE NOT SCRIPTURE. DON'T FOLLOW THOSE THINGS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Don't follow those things. &gt;&gt; They will GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DOUBT. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE says don't doubt. &gt;&gt; If you are doubt, you must doubt your doubts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless for you. Blessed for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a good act of praise. Amen. Praise the Lord. You got a picture of the club. Amen. You know, the brother ended on that cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a sign, a true sign that's overlooked. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they say believe the sign. They started off with on a good note and they really believed the sign at that time. So here we got alpha cloud. Anyway, we need to get a full picture. Praise the Lord. But was it a scriptural sign? &gt;&gt; That's a question in line with the message. Now, &gt;&gt; this was a sign. It &gt;&gt; was thrown up. &gt;&gt; Remember, they add it the other way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's the ground there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But was it a scriptural sign? &gt;&gt; But it takes a prophet to interpret that sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, being a scriptural prophet, he goes to the word to interpret that sign. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And he did this in 1962 before this picture was ever taken. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So the sign that he sees in a vision is seven angels coming. &gt;&gt; In the form of a pyramid. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So interpret that to interpret that seven angels coming in the form of a pyramid. He goes to Revelation 10. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he goes to Revelation 10 to interpret the sign of seven angels coming in the form of a pyramid. And then in 1963, this picture is taken. &gt;&gt; But it's an unfolding revelation. &gt;&gt; But now ask yourself the question, if it's a sign, where is the voice of the sign? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A voice must follow the sign. &gt;&gt; And if you go to Revelation 10, you'll hear voices. &gt;&gt; You'll hear one voice like a roaring like a lion and then seven voices follow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But that's a mystery to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we've heard the sign and the voice of the sign. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then the voice of the sign finally told the prophet, "Turn the picture to the right." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; That's how we got this. &gt;&gt; Turn the picture to the right. And what did he finally declare? &gt;&gt; That's our Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the voice behind the sign declared that's the our Lord. Come on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now we as the bride become the final voice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This final age &gt;&gt; to the final age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So who's the final sign in the final voice? &gt;&gt; It's us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. He says the prophet, he says the spirit, the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; The bride under a messenger becomes the final voice. Let's stand together. Give him praise. Give him glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Enoch. Sorry I didn't see you there. You're hiding all the way in the back. But thank you for the sacrifice for hosting our dear pastor and for bringing him to the service tonight. We pray the Lord will continue to bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just bow our heads and we sing. Have we got that song? Uh, signs of the time are everywhere.
