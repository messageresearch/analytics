I'm going to give it context from verses 12 and on the moral when they will come from Bethany he was hungry that's our lord Jesus amen our lord Jesus was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar of having leaves he came if happy he might find another thing there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet amen what is that telling you season but God is asking us to be instant in season and out of season if he is going to use you in this hour you need to be bearing fruit at all times amen if he comes to your tree to your Vine and he sees no fruit on the tree don't let him speak to you but let him find fruit on your tree amen because Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of the year after forever and his disciples heard it so they heard the spoken word now this was Jesus coming to the third pool of his ministry amen the spoken word now notice there it's not seasoned and that's what they will tell us in the message of the hour right now it's not seasoned yet for the third pool but Jesus is standing historical Ministry and he's telling you it ought to be seasoned amen amen Hallelujah now watch from verse 15 to 70 is to verse 19 it's a hidden Mystery there because he's going to cleanse the temple amen you want to read it let's read it and they came out to Jerusalem Jesus went into the temple sorry I might be able to broken up here because the Lord just changed my entire message coming to church so I may not have everything that's why I do not even have a slideshow amen you know when the Holy Spirit just comes in and tells you don't touch that take this because I was going to speak on Mark 11 23 and take it from there but you notice my opening scripture was Numbers Chapter 20. amen I'll tell you why just now amen so they come into the temple and they find Money Changes amen but Jesus went to the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changes and the seats of them that sold out you know that's the type of the Holy Spirit does amen if you're going to most churches today and they're exchanging money amen are they selling the spirit of God aren't they telling you to come amen and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught them saying is it not written my house Shall be Called of all Nations the house of what amen amen amen catch the hidden Mystery there now where's the house of God today amen amen Where's the temple of God so before he goes back he just power the spoken word but before the disciples can see the evidence they are seeing a cleansing of the Temple amen amen this he's showing them how to dedicate the temple how to operate in the power of the spoken word amen amen oh I wish I had this in my nose how it sounds good amen how to operate in the power of the spoken word amen amen get back to prayer for my house my temple shall be called a House of Prayer amen yes amen but you have made it a den of Thieves so a thousand dollars connect with the anointing we say come by without money amen yes amen hallelujah the gospel is to be given freely amen but people don't want to bear the cost of the anointing the anointing will cost you everything amen amen amen and people do not want to elaborate those things but Jesus is telling you my house shall be called a House of Prayer but you have made it a den of Thieves even when people go down to pray they are thinking about money they are thinking about this that and the other they're trying to use the the prayer life to manipulate God amen and describes the chief scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him people do not like truth amen for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his Doctrine amen amen hallelujah amen they are going to come to see to destroy the bride in this time why the same way the tree to the groom is how they are going to treat the bride amen we speak things that uncover Satan scheme in this end time amen amen so what are they going to do they want to destroy us they're going to bring a squeeze amen but all the people who astonished at his Doctrine amen and when they even was come you went out of the city now the next morning coming back to the tree now as they passed by they saw the victory dried up from the roots amen they are witnessing the same one the spoke in Genesis chapter one Amen Let There Be amen and there was now he's in a body of Flesh and he spoke to that tree now ask yourself you in your Human Condition God has given you the ability to connect with the scripture amen but it requires certain things in order for you to come back to this academic condition amen you've got to align with God Amen amen you've got to align with his program we kind of come so far in the message after 30 40 years and we see no evidence of what the prophet spoke about there's going to be something wrong we can't be doing the same old things saying the same old things seeing no move of God and being content with it expecting different results people are wondering in the wilderness amen oh no leave us with our scribes and our Pharisees we love their teaching Jesus they had remember they had the law they had the ritual word but they had to come now to listen to the manifested words you are living in pistols where the Lord of all men amen people want to take you back and only point you back to history I am the manifested word the spirit of God is speaking out of you yeah you become co-workers with the holy spirit amen Hallelujah and you know it's always it looks like the manifested word is always against their religious thinking notice that in Scripture they were not happy with Moses being the deliverer they were not happy with Jesus being the deliverer neither will it be happy in the Third Exodus with whom God is chosen amen yes so the morning the next morning they passed to fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance say that to them here's the rock now Peter called them to remembrance the others may have forgotten what was spoken but Peter The Rock Amen remembers what Jesus said amen there's only a few that will remember what Jesus said there's only a few that's looking for the manifestation of what Jesus said Master behold the Fig Tree which that curse is withered away and Jesus answered say that to him have faith in God amen amen now here's 11 23. this is the third pool scripture you know that but watch How It's mathematically put them we've been explaining to you what the number 11 means it's the 11th Hour workers right we've been explaining to you what the 23 means so why is it there and that's the title of my message our association with the angel of God Amen is 11 23. we are the 11th Hour workers but we have a special connection with the angel of the Lord in this hour oh some don't believe that some want to say take me back take me back dear Lord give me an history lesson please if you want a history lesson this is not the place yeah if you want to see present tense realities present tense manifestation you'll find it here amen we are taking God out of History we know in Hebrews 13 8 but I don't want amen I don't want to only see me yesterday yes neither do I only want to hear about tomorrow he is today Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever some are not looking for the manifestation of today because it makes them uncomfortable amen who verily are saying to you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea thou shall not doubt in his heart amen now pay attention to the detail it's not always in the speaking it's in what follows amen people get excited in the first part but they don't want to label for the second part whosoever shall see unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart that's where you come now don't doubt amen yes hold to the vision amen we ask you to write stuff down division how many of you are holding to that vision amen hold to the vision stand true to it amen and you've got to have free to believe what you have spoken what you have written hold to the vision amen I don't care how long it takes you hold to the vision it requires you and I having faith because Mark 11 23 is you and me working with the holy spirit amen is fixing things amen isn't he working amen amen there's only one thing that can make this work brother calls it a super anointing he calls it a super anointing comes upon you and told him to speak those squirrels you heard the message last week he mentioned that super anointing Came Upon him amen he also mentions a few other things but if you caught it amen he's waiting for you to say the right word you notice it was we always talk about sister actually right said the right words but in that message it tells you the witch brother said the right words they were concerned about that lady that old lady yes you remember and he says because they said that yeah yeah amen amen the super anointing came down because that he writes said the right word the super anointing came down and then the people amen who's prophesied to have the right word in the sower amen read Revelation 10 it'll tell you all about yourself yes amen amen don't doubt in your heart but believe those things which he had said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saved amen amen amen whatsoever you saith amen hallelujah oh praise the name of Jesus so what is he saying there amen Jesus telling them my house shall be a House of Prayer amen we find that too many people are not living this amen does not brother Branham say you can eat too much you can drink too much you can talk too much what can't you do too much praying too much you can't pray too much now in Ephesians 4 and verse 30. if you read the scripture tells you not the Holy Spirit who is the Holy Spirit the angel of God Amen grieve not the Holy Spirit because you are sealed until the day of your Redemption do you know what that word grief means it means he Mourns he's in agony is in Trivial do you know what Grieves the Holy Spirit when you don't pray ask yourself what Grieves the Holy Spirit when you choose social media over your prayer times amen when you choose death or were you reading your the word now remember the word is first and foremost amen heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away we have had the opening of the world we of all people having the most amount of Revelation in all the Earth amen ought to be the most powerful people there is great power that happens in prayer yes now there are two people that you can grieve you can grieve the Holy Spirit by neglecting the word and prayer because the Holy Spirit feeds on the word yeah amen and you know what the problem is you do not connect we know that prayer is a connection to God but really the holy spirit is in you you connect to God you pray because you have a connection with God that's what I'm trying to say you pray because of your connection with God you realize it's the axis didn't Jesus say in Matthew chapter 6. you'll find it I think in verse five he's teaching them how to pray how does it started Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name holy is your name you reverence the name of God when you approach him in prayer sometimes if you approach it and your mind is racing you need to steal yourself in his presence do not stop praying because your prayer is like empty things just falling flat hitting the ceiling coming down how many times you just want to have a quick five-minute prayer but our mind is racing with thoughts quiet yourself amen if you can't quiet yourself meditate on his word or start to worship change the atmosphere amen amen amen don't stand your spiritual growth but if you're going to commit your test time to prayer don't spend that that half an hour that one hour just aimlessly let it be effective prayer of a righteous man know how to operate in prayer amen amen silence the mind yes yes the flesh will tell you I need to do this I need to do that you bring the Flesh and the subjection yes amen don't keep your phone near you amen don't be irreverent in his presence thank you Lord amen so prayer connects you to God and then what does it tell you because the next one you need to put up the Lord's Prayer in Matthew chapter 6. foreign our father worked in heaven Hallowed be thy name worship Him approach God In Prayer by worship amen now here's the key thy kingdom come thy will be done why would God ask you to pray for his will to be done on Earth how many of you pray that way amen Hallelujah the purpose of prayer is so that you align yourself to the will of God amen amen the purpose of prayer is to bring Heaven to Earth that Kingdom Come bring your thoughts to Earth bring your will to Earth bring your purpose to Earth bring your plan to the end not just idiot to my Earth we are to manifest the kingdom of heaven amen yes amen Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence you think we are on a picnic if we can open up your eyes to the spiritual World you'll see the violence that's taking place demonic forces attacking the kingdom of God even right now distracting you from the things of God even right now being irreverent to the things of God even right now with doubts in your heart you sit there [Music] amen but that Kingdom Come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven amen amen hallelujah amen I want you to know the will of God is not you can change the mind of God you can't change the will of God that's why prayer is not for you to go and change the mind of God it's not for you to go and change the will of God pray you amen amen amen Lord I may have had all of this thing but align me to your will align me to your purpose amen so the will of God think of it like this River that's flowing can you change the river's flow can you alter the river what you need to do is to jump into the river and allow the flow to take you in his will amen go with the flow of the river and we singing Flow River flow amen what are we seeing Lord I want to be in your will yes yes amen amen so when we pray according to his will when we pray according to his word we are bringing creation into alignment with God's plan on the Earth and doesn't he say in the word that my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts so what are we saying that this bride that aligns with God's will is thinking higher thoughts as higher ways as high as standards amen amen amen praying is not to persuade to do God's son to do something that God doesn't want to do please Lord please do it this way no the Bible says that our best laid plans God laughs at it doesn't he say in Jeremiah that I know the plans I have for you so why we want to fight God's plan God's will of Our Lives Lord align me to your will amen amen I tell you people are not serious about prayer if you want to be a powerful Army raise up amen if you want to be a powerful Army you need to get alone with God you need to read his word if you want to know the will of God you read his word people say oh the holy spirit is not speaking to me when last would you open your Bible the holy spirit will never reveal anything outside of the word because the Holy Spirit was said to remind you of the word to teach you the word oh I don't hear the voice of the Holy Spirit when last did you open your Bible yes I opened it last week and my mother told me to complete 900 and note that was Sunday hey when last did you open your Bible when last did you carry your Bible to church are we proud of our Bible do we carry it as the word the sword of the Lord sword of the king oh why are you preaching such basic things it's the basic things that's left undone you need to reverence the word do you know how the Jews reverence the word amen so prayer is not to say Lord bend your will to my will pray is not to limit God's Vision a lie to your vision prayer is to align your vision to God's vision amen Hallelujah and when God Reveals His plan and his purpose for your life when God Reveals His will to you nothing can stop it nobody can stop the will of God nobody can stop the move of God nobody can stop God's purpose for your life I don't care who they are they can't shut the move of God down yes amen God's will will be done on Earth but he's looking for agents the prophet says it that way that God's agency has always been man amen God will not work outside of man God's agency is man amen hallelujah amen oh bless the name of Jesus amen so if we look here now amen Moses and Aaron they were co-workers with God Moses was a prophet Aaron was a priest amen and the people wanted water from The Rock now you may be thinking why I'm speaking about this why am I speaking about the Rock when we're focusing on speaking to the mountain amen Hallelujah it's because we seem to be in a similar time amen we seem to be in a similar hour there's dryness all around what does the Wilderness speak of the dryness no move of the spirit of God people murmuring people complaining amen dry no move of God people have shut down the move of God we see it daily people shutting down the move of God people shutting down the move of the Holy Spirit you tell me brother oh you you associate a lot to denominations no I associate with message people yes but I see them shutting down the move of God afraid of the power of God of Freedom what the Holy Ghost will make them do afraid of surrender amen dry no water to drink but God calls we read their numbers amen put it up amen just want to show you that one point amen Numbers Chapter 20. verse 6 Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them did they fall on their faces after the glory of God appeared they fell on the faces mean they were seeking God when you see God you shall see his glory I told you two people get grieved for different reasons one you grieve the Holy Spirit when you do not commit yourself to word and prayer secondly Satan is grieved when you do pray amen amen what got Daniel in trouble is prayer got him into trouble and whether he also reading the word wasn't he seeking God about when the Deliverance would come to them was he done in Babylon are we in another Babylon amen prayer will get you in trouble with the supernatural World demonic world and they start to move in men rose up remember that demonic can only walk through men same two of the spirit of God will walk through men that's why it is a great contest going on both fighting for the control of man both the genomic the Demonic world and the spirit of God that's why I say if God could take the veil of our eyes we'll see the kingdom of God is suffering violence but the Bible says the violence take it by force amen when Nehemiah those people went back to build the walls of Jerusalem they had a sword by their side they had to defend themselves amen this battle is not a picnic but you are here on a war dearly you're facing a war amen but you don't see it as a walk you see it as oh this person got sick this body demon powers oppressing people you don't see it as a war amen getting angry with the devil amen stop being so polite with the Devil amen the Bible says amen we take it by force violence take it by force some of us need to get violence with the Devil amen yes some of you are scared don't be scared you got a whole lot of angels amen backing you up amen didn't Angels back Daniel up amen his prayer connected to heaven amen I'm giving you Keys Amen to your spiritual growth amen amen I am telling you the reason why people can't speak to the mountain is because they don't speak to the Rock man that's why we can't fully go into it we first need to speak to the Rock amen that should be the name of the Lord let's give it a minute amen Hallelujah amen let's give the Lord anchor of Praise amen amen oh that's the name of Jesus amen so they got on their faces and the Shekinah glory of the Lord appeared unto them how many of you have that expectation amen when you get into your quiet time us to see the glory of the Lord amen don't be in a hurry to get out of the room yes if it's not the appropriate time wait until the appropriate time to spend time in prayer don't just do a rush job quieten yourself in his presence ask the Lord Lord move in this place move in this place Lord can I see your glory fill me with your glory Lord Jesus amen amen hallelujah and the Lord speak unto Moses take the rod gather the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother speak unto the rock before their eyes speak to the Rock who did Brother Brown tell us that rock was he says that rock was Christ it was typing Christ and it shall give forth his water amen if you have dryness in your life if you have barrenness in your life speak to the Rock Amen and he shall default his Waters yes amen and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock not only will he give forth his Waters but you shall be able to give it to others and you'll give the congregation and the Beast to drink amen you know how that story ends because people couldn't handle that power you read further then amen I'm not going to that right now amen so before you can speak to the mountain you need to speak to the Rock The Rock recognizes the voice of faith amen now I want you to know this was not a spiritual thing this is not a a symbol that's written there there was literally a rock surrounded by baroness and desert but they spoke to the Rock God asked him to speak to the Rock God was asking them to operate in a certain anointing a certain power but they brought their man-made ideas he never asked him to strike The Rock he told him speak to the Rock Amen God recognizes the voice of faith free coming by the hearing of the word that's why it's important who you are listening to the voice that you are listening to is important amen amen because if you are listening to a voice that doesn't have faith in the word he's preaching what are you is it going to produce is it going to produce faith in your heart no it'll produce an intellectual concept but you gotta believe the one that is preaching the word amen The Rock recognizes the voice of faith when The Rock hears the voice of faith it gives what is Waters amen The Rock recognize the faith of Daniel Amen and amen Gabriel came down Michael came down amen the whole host of Heaven came down and there was opposing forces right what do you think is happening when you are in your prayer room amen and you are calling on the name of the Lord heaven responds to your call but there is a spiritual warfare so he may not always get your answer immediately amen but help is on the way amen amen amen The Rock recognizes one who is in their position and one in the authority just like the fix we did the victory recognized the Creator you say not so you go try to speak to the fig tree see if the Fig Tree obeys your voice but Jesus was teaching them amen that you too can operate in this but you don't doubt in your heart and you hold to that Vision you believe what you said The Rock recognizes one in their position one in the authority amen The Rock doesn't give his water to a voice of unbelief amen The Rock doesn't give forth its water to doubt Amen to irreverence watch our approach to The Rock amen the access to Freed lies in the prophets hear me now the children of Israel are crying to who to Moses and Moses had an assistant there with you which was Aaron a type of the priesthood God has given the church today a prophet and he's giving them a five-fold so they access to your faith lies in the prophet and the fivefold somebody say Amen or somebody believed that word amen Hallelujah they are commissioned to build a church amen if you don't believe that read Ephesians 4 . amen people need to get a revelation that God won't work outside of his word amen God is not going to work outside of his program amen God is not going to bypass the faithful Ministry and the prophet and come and give you a private revelation some people have a superior Revelation or I stay at home out of the will of God amen but like the pro the word says surely the Lord God will do nothing but it will reveal his secrets to his serving the prophets and you know the prophet that also goes on to say that a prophet is a modern day preacher that's what Revelation 10 11 is doing prophesying again how can you give prophecy if you're not prophetic amen hallelujah oh bless the name of Jesus amen amen hallelujah amen so God was confirming his word to the children of Israel that day no matter how Barren your situation no matter how dry your situation is if you can speak to the Rock Amen it will give what is Waters amen hallelujah amen brother Caleb find us in uh speak to this mountain amen I want to read this amen speak to this mountain it's preached 57 12 15. Hallelujah amen if you love the word of the Lord amen you got that message so type in there maybe just one little green amen so the prophet is telling them now when you speak to the mountain remember watch what Jesus is saying if you don't doubt amen and you believe that what you said shall come to pass watch what he's seeing him when you speak to the mountain don't turn and walk away wait amen he says maybe just one little grain of sand begin to move through the whole Mountain sure yes amen but it's starting to move amen yes amen you might not be able to notice it but there's something in your heart says it's being done we shall have what you say Hallelujah don't pray a prayer today and tomorrow go negotiate with the Lord okay if you can't do it this way can we run [Music] don't bargain like that when you go to God ask God for big things he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ever ask or think amen thank you don't really go to God and say God maybe my my request was a bit unreasonable hold true to what you ask the Lord amen amen amen don't go ask something easy the prophet says ask God for big things make it impossible amen hallelujah every response to Faith amen look at what Daniel did amen when he was so connected with God Amen and they tried to shut down his prayer life oh I hope you're getting it amen Daniel was the ego he was from the tribe of them he's the eagle flying through Babylon but he was committed to his prayer life in the world and they tried to shut down his prayer life they tried to shut down his worship they tried to shut down his connection with the Unseen World amen but he was willing Amen to even walk into a Den of Lions he didn't care about the threats or what they said they were going to do to him amen he knew who he was walking with amen he knew the line of the tribe of Judah amen and every line in that Den had to bow down to the line of the tribe of Judah amen thank you amen amen you may be thinking nothing's happening when you're praying let me tell you a grain of sand is beginning to move amen amen thank you Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah the prophet will tell you sometimes the symptoms will get worse amen hallelujah but what's happening amen amen demon Spirits are starting to manifest amen they know they need to vacate their premises amen hallelujah you have the legal authority over Satan and his kingdom amen you have the legal rights you know people have rights people have many rights they got squatters rights amen but you do not have squatters Authority in the land of the Holy Ghost you are not squatting in the land of the Holy Ghost you have a legal right to the Holy Ghost amen other people are squatting on your land others people are squatting on your anointing denominations or squatting on your anointing but you do not ask what is right you have the legal Authority the legal right to be in the land and you have the legal right Amen to serve eviction notice on the devil and put every other demon power of your land yes Lord thank you thank you we got too many leeches feeding on the anointing amen we need to remove the leeches man hey thank you Lord and amen what happened in Matthew 25 you think those five wives allowed that other foolish to leech of him to Leisure of the anointing they said no you can't Leach of our anointing amen amen you can't Leach of our oil amen amen that's why I say the violent take it by force oh this bride she's a warrior bride hey man she's got a gamma tone but she's got the sword amen the sword is a word that goes forth from my mouth she's operating that purple anointing now amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah yes oh bless the name of Jesus amen amen he says you shall have what you say that's the faith many of us are prayed for at night the next morning we'll say well there's no difference I don't feel any different what's your confession what's your attitude he goes on to say that's where we are failing is he talking about the third full scripture is he telling you where people are failing and manifesting that scripture they walk away thinking the sand didn't move that doesn't have to show one thing but if thou believes in that heart that what you say is being done you shall have what you say that's it if you believe that what you're saying is already taking place I don't have to feel it or see it I believe it that's the reason that it takes place laughs you don't have to settle for second best amen you shall have what you say amen hallelujah oh bless the name of Jesus Amen Hallelujah amen thank you too many churches have gone the carnal intellectual route amen or you may be thinking I'm preaching this amen for the killer go to paragraph 16 in that message speak to this mountain laughs speak to this mountain and it shall give forth its Waters that's the title of that message not this one the other one speak to this mountain or speak to this rock sorry speak to this rock you'll see what the prophet is saying people have gone the intellectual route Spirits don't die I mean if you know Spirits don't die Spirits don't die paragraph 16. he says no you got the wrong one it says speak to this rock and it shall give forth thy Waters its Waters amen blessed be the name of the Lord let me read it to you it says that's a whole lot of it today that's what the matter with many of our churches they've taken the carnal intellectual route and been cut off the supplies of God's blessing of healing and Power right and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I've taken the desert route what did they cut off the supplies of the blessings of God healing and power and baptism of the Holy Ghost and have took the desert route therefore we have arguing fossils truths and complaints but those that are remaining in the way it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory for the pillar of fire over them with power with joy with signs and wonders amen he says how that real Born Again Church is moving on to the promised land the promise of eternal life and land flowing with eternal life where there's no more sickness death sorrow nothing to harm them amen Hallelujah amen may we never go that kind of way without the Holy Spirit say Lord I don't want to go another step without your Holy Spirit leading me amen Hallelujah you know what the accusation has been with the message Church because when message people generally talk about the supernatural they will refer you to the days of brother Branham they may have one of you two testimonies here but when they talk about the supernatural and people are not silly people know their level of anointing their brother Brandon operated in so they asked the question if you believe his message what happened to you that's right that's right amen what happened to y'all yeah powerless cold dead it's sometimes it's an embarrassment to invite people to come to the meetings okay Paul said I I shall not to declare the full counsel of God Amen amen but I came with power and demonstration amen yes Lord just come there Empires say whatever you want no move of God people sitting there with needs yes yes the sick people Afflicted go read every one of brother Brandon's message and you see if he didn't call a prayer line amen see if he didn't pray for the sick even if it's not a prayer line if you're against prayer line it's fine see if he didn't pray for the sick see if he wasn't concerned for the people you know why they do it they got no backing of the Holy Ghost afraid to be exposed dead cold powerless but there's a church that's rising up

upon you amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen one time amen you think of Joshua and Caleb they were about to go on their first Pursuit amen there was a predestinated scene trapped Behind the Walls of Jericho but nobody knew beside the spies that went out there amen and probably Joshua and Caleb was strategizing how they were going to overtake these people and the prophet says they may have had the best arrows and their Swordsmen and the bowmen and everybody all in position amen wondering how we are going to overtake the city because they had a great War you know those walls were so great that they had chariots races on them amen they prided themselves in this great wall for the defense but the prophet says amen that Joshua came and he met the Rock [Music] and he spoke to the Rock the captain of the host amen the prophet says many times we are not in speaking terms with The Rock that's why we can't speak to the Rock we can't speak to the mountain because we don't speak to the Rock we can't speak to the mountain because we have no prayer life we can't speak to the mountain because we don't know the word we don't read the word is God amen even with a positive confession of Joshua and Caleb saying we are more than able to take it amen he required Supernatural assistance and God didn't ask the permission God didn't inform them I'm coming to help you he gave them the promise in Exodus 23 verse 23. amen I sent my angel before thee amen amen hallelujah maybe they've forgotten about it amen by the captain of the came down that table when he says captain of the horse

years and he tells us about a man sitting there [Music] by the name of Bartimaeus and he was not afraid his religious teachers that taught him wrong you'll hear by his own confession he's screaming son of David but he was not the son of David in that office yet he was son of man amen but the prophet says because of his faith The Rock Stood Still The Rock recognized his faith but to me is even
