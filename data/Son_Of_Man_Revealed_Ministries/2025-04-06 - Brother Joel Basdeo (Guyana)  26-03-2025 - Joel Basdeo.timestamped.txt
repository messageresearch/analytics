[0:06] out of here. The angel of God is
[0:10] there our souls
[0:13] in
[0:18] love to live for the impossible.
[0:26] I've seen the angel of God not seen for
[0:28] 2,000 years. Angel of God not seen. He's
[0:32] right here.
[0:35] He's here fixing things. They're fixing
[0:38] things for us to
[0:40] leave. Oh, waiting
[0:43] visions. Waving visions of our Amen.
[0:47] We'll see ourselves in the
[0:49] wood so we can walk step by step into
[0:53] what we behold. See new
[0:58] [Music]
[1:02] things. I'll be raptured.
[1:08] [Music]
[1:11] Angel in the inable
[1:16] inconceivable faith to believe for the
[1:20] impossible. Oh, in this new
[1:25] day. In this new
[1:27] [Music]
[1:29] day. Hallelujah. Oh, in this new day. In
[1:33] this new day.
[1:38] [Music]
[1:40] in this new
[1:45] day.
[1:47] Hallelujah. Amen. The prophet of God
[1:49] says when that seven seals were opened,
[1:52] a new land was opened up unto us. Amen.
[1:55] Declaring a new day for the bride. Amen.
[1:58] Calling you out of Leosia into the bride
[2:00] age. Hallelujah. The age of marriage,
[2:03] the age of adoption. Glory be to his
[2:05] name. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:08] Glory. Glory. Glory. Thank you, Father.
[2:12] Amen. Amen. We greet you all in the
[2:14] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[2:16] Jesus Christ. You can greet one another.
[2:18] Amen. God bless you. Let me greet you
[2:20] first. God bless you.
[2:23] Amen. Don't forget the people in back of
[2:26] you. You got your back turned to them.
[2:28] Amen. So, greet
[2:31] them. Praise the Lord.

[2:42] moments in greet all our pastors. Amen.
[2:46] That's here. Amen. I pray that you be
[2:48] blessed in the house of the Lord.
[2:50] Welcome you and all believers that have
[2:52] come to visit and fellowship with us.
[2:55] Amen. I'm excited because Joel the
[2:59] evangelist is here. Amen.
[3:02] You know, anytime somebody's got the
[3:04] name Joel, there's prophecy and they
[3:06] expect and I think the evangelist goes
[3:09] under the prophetic anointing because
[3:11] they go with Mark 16. Hallelujah. So,
[3:14] you be under expectation. Anybody come
[3:16] under expectation, they come with a
[3:17] need. Amen. So, when the holy, you know,
[3:19] as an evangelist moves, the Holy Spirit
[3:21] drops down. So, be quick to pick up
[3:23] things. Amen. Hallelujah. And catch the
[3:26] anointing. Want to read Joel 2:23 says,
[3:30] "Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and
[3:32] rejoice in the Lord your God, for he had
[3:35] given you the former rain moderately,
[3:37] and he will cause to come down for you
[3:39] the rain, the former rain, and the
[3:41] latter rain in the first month." Yes. 25
[3:45] says, "I will restore to you the years
[3:46] that the locust had eaten, the cankerm,
[3:49] caterpillar, palmer, my great army,
[3:51] which I send amongst you." I love verse
[3:54] 26, 27. It says, "You shall eat in
[3:56] plenty." Amen. Amen. There's only one
[3:59] people eating in plenty in this time of
[4:01] famine. Praise the Lord. Yes, sir.
[4:04] Hallelujah.
[4:05] And be satisfied. And praise the name of
[4:08] the Lord your God, that he had dealt
[4:10] wondrously with you. And my people shall
[4:12] never be ashamed. Amen. You shall know
[4:15] that I am in the midst of Israel, and
[4:17] that I am the Lord your God and none
[4:19] else, and my people shall never be
[4:21] ashamed. And it shall come to pass
[4:23] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[4:25] upon all flesh. Your sons and your
[4:27] daughters shall prophesy. Your old men
[4:29] shall dream dreams and your young men
[4:31] shall see visions. And also upon your
[4:34] servants and upon your the handmmaids in
[4:35] those days will I pour out my spirit.
[4:38] Amen. So I'm just trying to tap into the
[4:40] anointing of Joel. Amen. Amen.
[4:43] Hallelujah. You know, every name carries
[4:45] a meaning. Praise the Lord. And here the
[4:49] apostle Peter now taps into that
[4:51] scripture and he prophesies to them and
[4:53] says this is that which Joel prophesied
[4:55] about. That was the birth of the church.

[5:54] gives you one talent, if you invest it
[5:55] wisely, he'll give you another one. That

[12:09] thing with him.
[12:12] So I hear I know that you come under
[12:16] expectation.
[12:19] If you pull, I preach.
[12:24] So you pull, I preach you. So let's go
[12:29] into the
[12:32] scripture. Genesis chapter
[12:37] 22 verse 7-4.
[12:43] I want you.
[13:26] And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father
[13:32] and said, "My my father," and he said,
[13:36] "Here am I, my son."
[13:41] And he said, "Behold the fire and the
[13:45] wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt
[13:50] offering?"
[13:51] And Abraham said, "My son, God will
[13:54] provide
[13:56] himself a lamb for a burnt offering."
[14:00] And so they went both of them
[14:04] together, and they came to the place
[14:08] which God had told him
[14:13] of. And Abraham built an altar there,
[14:18] and laid the wood in order, and bound
[14:22] Isaac his
[14:24] son, and laid him on the altar upon the
[14:29] wooden.
[14:30] And Abraham stretched forth his
[14:33] hand, and took a knife to slay his
[14:37] son. And the angel of the Lord
[14:41] called unto Abraham out of heaven, and
[14:45] said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said,
[14:50] Here am I.
[14:53] And he said, "Lay not thy hands upon the
[14:57] ladder, neither do thou any thing unto
[15:02] him.
[15:04] For now I know that thou fearst God,
[15:10] seeing thou has not withheld thy son,
[15:16] thy
[15:21] only. Lay not thy hand upon the lad,
[15:25] neither do thou anything unto him. For
[15:30] now I know that thou fearest God,
[15:34] seeing, thou has not withheld thy
[15:38] son, thy only son from me. And Abraham
[15:44] lift up his eyes, and look, and behold,
[15:49] behind him a ram caught in a ticket by
[15:54] his horn.
[15:56] And Abraham went and took the ram and
[16:00] offered him up for a burnt
[16:04] offering in thestead of his son.
[16:10] And Abraham called the name of the place
[16:13] Jehovah
[16:15] Gyra, as it is said to this day, in
[16:21] the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
[16:26] Amen. And we go into John chapter
[16:32] 3, chapter 12, verse 32.
[16:38] And I if I be lifted up from the earth,
[16:43] I will draw all men unto me. Amen. Our
[16:48] dear precious eternal heavenly father, I
[16:52] pray. Father, you take control. Lord,
[16:55] you bless your word and feed. Use me, oh
[16:59] Lord. Use his feeble lips of clay to
[17:01] feed your children. In Jesus precious
[17:04] name we pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. You
[17:07] all could be
[17:13] seated. So we see
[17:17] here I've take a text accepting God's
[17:22] provided way.
[17:25] The message accepting God's provided way
[17:29] and God has a provided way. Amen. Amen.
[17:33] That is the message I get inspiration
[17:36] from. It's not even inspiration.
[17:40] It just have
[17:42] food, stored up food and it is good food
[17:45] for the bride.
[17:48] We as you eat
[17:50] natural to survival to reach 60 years
[17:54] and 70 years. If you decide this month I
[17:58] wouldn't eat but spiritually we just do
[18:02] that
[18:03] sometime long long you don't eat but
[18:06] your natural food you you eat a hunger
[18:11] just come in you you seeing dark all
[18:14] kind of thing
[18:17] but how sometime for days or or Sunday
[18:21] you eat until weekend till or during the
[18:24] week one time And then the next time and
[18:27] you're not feel no dark.
[18:30] You ain't getting no no no. That's why
[18:33] sometime your life they stagnant
[18:36] one way all the time
[18:39] because you have to feed daily every
[18:42] day.
[18:44] There was a question asked the prophet.
[18:49] How can I get stronger? They want to be
[18:52] strong. How can I get stronger in the
[18:56] Lord? Just simple read your Bible and
[19:00] pray every day.
[19:03] Amen.
[19:06] So you know the backbone of a church is
[19:09] prayer meeting. Amen.
[19:12] The backbone of a church is prayer
[19:15] meeting.
[19:16] So prayer it's very important. Sometime
[19:21] you see success but just a housewife
[19:24] being praying just a sister been
[19:27] praying. Amen. And it no matter who pray
[19:31] is who pray to. Amen. From my car in
[19:34] Guyana, it have prayer changes things.
[19:39] But now prayer changes things is the God
[19:41] that you pray to. Because you have many
[19:45] people praying.
[19:47] Prayer if prayer changes things you go
[19:50] to one stone and pray things got
[19:53] change but not prayer changes things is
[19:56] the God that you pray to but I am thank
[20:00] God that you are serving that true and
[20:03] living God. There is a living God. There
[20:08] is a present tense God.
[20:11] And you can't serve a God of history.
[20:14] You have to have a God of present tense.
[20:17] Abraham had a God of present tense.
[20:21] Abraham had a God that when the God
[20:23] speak, he obey. Amen. Because that's why
[20:27] because thou has
[20:30] oy that in blessing I will bless thee
[20:34] and in multiplying I will multiply. Thy
[20:38] seed as the star in heaven as the sand
[20:43] upon the seashore. So you are a blessed
[20:47] people. You are seed of Abraham. And
[20:50] because you
[20:54] there's a blessing. Take out. The bride
[20:57] from this earth is trouble. It is chaos.
[21:01] People will cry out and let a rock fall
[21:04] on me. You just let his bride and just
[21:07] move on.
[21:09] Some will call want the mountain to fall
[21:11] on their man trouble. Don't be a church
[21:16] go be brighter.
[21:19] Because he said and his wife had made
[21:22] herself ready.
[21:25] Amen. This thing no you're not no baby
[21:30] and thing for just tell you read your
[21:32] Bible when last you
[21:35] listen no that that when children are
[21:37] grow up when you listen a message you
[21:40] all read your Bible know your little
[21:43] children yet no you need grow up and his
[21:47] wife has made herself ready
[21:51] wife not no wife not no little small
[21:55] teenager
[21:56] wife of mature, you got mature and you
[21:59] might
[22:01] [Music]
[22:02] So if your wife if you're a bride of
[22:05] Jesus Christ, you got to make yourself
[22:09] ready. He is coming back for a glorious
[22:14] short without spot without wrinkle.
[22:18] Yes. You know how much brighter have the
[22:22] the the bride and and your garment got
[22:25] to be white.
[22:27] So any lying spot a show any gossiping
[22:32] spot a show.
[22:35] Any backbiting spot a show.
[22:40] But it is available and all this bucket
[22:44] cleanser. Are you washed in the blood?
[22:48] There is a provided way. Call me
[22:52] sinner. There is a fountain filled with
[22:55] blood.
[22:57] Trans from Emmanuel vain. When sinner
[23:01] plunch beneath the
[23:06] flies. Hallelujah. I am thankful for
[23:10] that. I have walked God's provided way
[23:14] and I have take a good washer.
[23:18] This God can wash you out, can cleanse
[23:21] you out. There is a thinking man filter.
[23:26] And when you have passed through that
[23:28] filter of the blood of Jesus Christ, I
[23:31] thank God that in
[23:34] Revelation 202 there is a book that
[23:39] record everything.
[23:41] There is a put it up there. Revelation
[23:46] 20 verse 12 there. And I saw the dead,
[23:51] small and great, stand before God, and
[23:55] the book were open. And another book was
[23:59] open, which is the book of life. And the
[24:02] dead were judged out of those things.
[24:09] That's it.
[24:11] Which were written in the book according
[24:14] to their works. Everything you do
[24:18] written down, there is an allseen eye
[24:23] watching you and there is angel taking
[24:26] down record. Every time you pick your
[24:30] your phone and you're watching nonsense,
[24:33] write down. Every time you're there
[24:35] watching Tik Tok
[24:37] long, he
[24:39] writing and then you get no time when to
[24:42] read your Bible, your eye burning. No,
[24:46] there is a angel watching you and take
[24:49] him
[24:51] record there is he's omniresent. He's
[24:55] here there everywhere at this set time.
[25:01] If you know that there many people don't
[25:05] know their God in that way but I know my
[25:08] God in that way
[25:11] because how come that sometime you
[25:15] you're watching wrong
[25:17] and nobody not there wrong then you then
[25:20] you operate like a certain way. There is
[25:24] a eye watching you and it take a reward
[25:27] of you. But I thank God. But when you
[25:32] all do all of that right down in the
[25:34] book, it have a available the good thing
[25:38] right down. So not only the bad thing
[25:41] when you do bad thing then you get
[25:43] somebody right down. When you do good
[25:45] thing, you right thing go. But when you
[25:48] pass through that filter, all the bad
[25:51] thing gone and the good thing left.
[25:54] Hallelujah. That filter not filter out
[25:57] the the good thing he filter out.
[26:01] All the bad thing. Hallelujah. I thank
[26:04] God for that. So now you can be
[26:08] available as sinless. Amen. Praise the
[26:12] Lord. Hallelujah. When Job had a
[26:15] question
[26:17] about what will happen to man
[26:22] there when he had a question there was a
[26:24] young man. So God just use young man
[26:26] too. Amen. Yeah. Amen. Eli who? Yes.
[26:31] That's right. But he was young. Yes. And
[26:34] all the old elder and everything around
[26:37] some say maybe secret sinner. Some say
[26:40] this.
[26:42] Amen. And Job was a prophet and Elijah
[26:46] will come at last.
[26:50] He said,

[31:28] child out. God said take thy son. But
[31:31] how nice he put to go.
[31:34] Thy only son
[31:38] begotten son whom thou lovest.
[31:42] Hallelujah. Nice.
[31:46] What if God tell anyone of y'all to do
[31:48] that? What happened? That son
[31:53] disappear because first thing you tell
[31:55] your wife or something you not got to
[31:57] tell wife something you just got hold.
[32:01] Yes.
[32:02] Yes. First time when
[32:06] God give Abraham the promise when Sarah
[32:10] said listen this thing now take Hagar
[32:14] big time
[32:16] pregnant Abraham not hesitate now when
[32:21] Hagar when Sarah said get rid of this
[32:24] son
[32:25] now he not hear God said listen to she
[32:30] amen you listen to sheep Yes. You listen
[32:34] at force.
[32:38] Now when you when that time for listen
[32:40] for get rid listen back then it was
[32:44] painful for Abraham. You see all the
[32:47] trouble in the Middle East. You see all
[32:49] the trouble the fighting and the war
[32:52] that when you get your own way that was
[32:56] Sarah ID and and Abraham caused all of
[33:00] that trouble.
[33:02] But God has a provided way that in
[33:06] blessing I will bless thee because of
[33:09] what thou has oy
[33:20] hallelujah God have sent a voice have
[33:24] you obeyed that voice in the days of the
[33:27] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[33:30] begin to Come all
[33:33] the mystery of God should be finished
[33:38] as he has declared unto the servant the
[33:41] prophet. Amen. Prophets God still have a
[33:44] five-fold ministry.
[33:48] If somebody have prophesy one time he'd
[33:51] be prophet.
[33:54] But he have major prophet word prophet
[33:58] and he have minor prophet. They can just
[34:01] prophesy something and that is it.
[34:04] Never again. You see some prophet look
[34:08] the book of
[34:09] Joel very small. Some of them book very
[34:14] very small and that all that them do.
[34:17] Yes. Look at my preaching. You can
[34:19] record how much he talking or pastor
[34:24] Denzel. Sometime we just talk too much.
[34:27] Yes. Well, God can just use a man just a
[34:30] little and that he have enough power.
[34:34] You see, God take a fish man.
[34:39] When I know to read and write and
[34:41] nothing, I'm not telling nobody not for
[34:45] for studying. I'm not promoting
[34:48] ignorance. Yes, you have there available
[34:51] your
[34:53] parents take care of your expense to go
[34:56] to school, take your education. Yeah.
[34:59] Because you can be working for 8 hour
[35:01] for a little bit of money. Yes. And
[35:04] because you take your education the same
[35:06] 8 hour you get two three time more plus
[35:08] you can get a loan you can you you get
[35:11] allowance you get a whole set of things.
[35:13] Take your education. I encourage young
[35:16] people don't if you if
[35:19] you you're not take your education and
[35:22] you're not elevate yourself now when
[35:24] you're young when you get old you still
[35:28] got to work hard so you better work hard
[35:31] now and you can play
[35:33] later than playing
[35:37] now your parents sending you to school
[35:40] and you're playing around yourself
[35:42] you're not take the education
[35:44] You got to work hard later.
[35:49] So I am preaching a
[35:51] practical gospel.
[35:56] And we we find the
[35:58] young children they are rude.
[36:02] And that is a evil spirit. You can't
[36:05] match up. Yeah, there you go. Imagine
[36:07] your
[36:09] parents
[36:11] working sacrifice so much money and
[36:15] think to send you to school and just
[36:17] because you learn something now
[36:22] you're talking anyhow to your parents
[36:24] and so no that is rudeness that is
[36:28] ingratitude is worse than a traitor.
[36:34] You need to reverence, respect, honor.
[36:39] Never state that if your parents are a
[36:41] Christian, honor them. No. If them a
[36:44] Hindu, honor them. If them a Muslim,
[36:47] honor them. If them poor, honor them. If
[36:51] them are still a drink, still honor,
[36:55] reverence, respect them.
[36:58] That your days may be long upon the
[37:01] altar. It's a blessing to have respect.
[37:05] Honor your parents.
[37:09] Children, obey your parents in the Lord.
[37:14] Because if your parents tell you a
[37:16] thief, you not got to go on thief.
[37:21] You know sometime men does use scripture
[37:24] wrong. Yeah.
[37:26] You know you get a
[37:28] scripture wife to obey their husband in
[37:32] everything.
[37:34] No Jesus when when the scripture were
[37:38] talking he was talking about a glorious
[37:41] church
[37:43] without spot. Yes. He was talking about
[37:46] a church. So he wasn't talking about
[37:48] sinner
[37:50] that in everything if you if your
[37:53] husband tell you go and drink wrong
[37:57] go and drink poison go and hang yourself
[38:01] that everything you got to you got to be
[38:03] have some sense it is not everything is
[38:07] everything in the order
[38:12] so but some people just want to put it
[38:14] how they feel that make boss now in
[38:18] everything.
[38:22] Use the scripture, right? Don't use it
[38:24] convenient for yourself.
[38:31] So, we see uh I have a
[38:36] story this AC um hitting me direct in my
[38:41] face. I'll stand more this
[38:44] week. Don't hate. Okay.
[38:48] Yes. We have a a a story with a infidel.
[38:55] The prophet went they went squirrel
[38:58] hunting and he and brother woods and
[39:01] when they went squirrel
[39:05] hunting no squirrel and he said I know a
[39:10] place where we can get squirrel but only
[39:13] thing this man is a infidel
[39:17] yes a infidel don't believe that there
[39:20] is a god
[39:22] No, God. He get
[39:24] God. He said, "Well, we let we make a
[39:27] shrine now. Let me
[39:30] go." And this man said, "You you
[39:35] preachers, the only thing you do, you're
[39:38] barking up the wrong
[39:40] tree. It's like a a a dog barking at a
[39:44] tree, but no animal is there."
[39:48] It's a lion dog. Yeah. So he calling the
[39:51] prophet a lying preacher.
[39:56] I tell you
[39:57] brethren, this man was preaching.
[40:02] You see when there is a God of present
[40:05] things, it make a difference.
[40:09] All the preacher in all over the place,
[40:13] he calling them barking up the wrong
[40:15] tree. Yeah. But there was a testimony of
[40:20] just a healing.
[40:23] He he did not went in this service.
[40:27] And he know that there is a woman had
[40:30] cancer.
[40:32] The doctor have give her up. They just

[41:43] if she have been obedient if she have

[41:50] court I'm going to use olive oil no she
[41:54] would have lose it but she have go and

[49:04] So that's why you must be born again.
[49:07] And to be born again, this have to die.
[49:10] Your own idea have to die out.
[49:14] The way your seating, how you think,
[49:16] your feelings, everything have to die
[49:19] and come under the headship of the word
[49:22] of God.
[49:24] God has a provided way. Man shall not
[49:28] live by bread alone, but by every word
[49:32] that proceedth from the mouth of God.
[49:35] Amen.
[49:38] To them that overcome will grant to sit
[49:41] with him in his throne. You can't
[49:43] overcome with your idea. You can't
[49:46] overcome by thinking the way of
[49:48] thinking. You just have to go God's
[49:51] provided way. Hallelujah. And you can
[49:54] overcome
[49:55] but you have to know what is it written
[49:59] for. You can't go build a ark. Now at
[50:01] the Bible, you read the Bible and you go
[50:03] and build an ark. God never tell you to
[50:06] be like
[50:08] [Music]
[50:11] so you have to do what is your part
[50:17] and your part as it was in the days of
[50:20] Noah. Amen. What was it in the days of
[50:24] Noah? In the days of Noah, God had a
[50:28] prophet in the land warning the people.
[50:32] Anytime you see a prophet, that prophet
[50:35] is to warn the people is to repent.
[50:40] It's to and he always have a safety
[50:43] zone. So if you accept God provided when
[50:47] he sent a prophet, you will listen to
[50:51] the benefits and you want the benefits,
[50:54] you have to obey God's word. God word
[50:57] that is God's provided way. What is it
[51:01] in this day as it was in the days of
[51:04] Noah? What happened before the door
[51:08] closed?
[51:09] The believer inside
[51:13] the ark. Yes. The believer that believe
[51:18] God now walk with plenty. Yes. Yeah. You
[51:23] are walking a straight and narrow road.
[51:28] And few find. So you may not have a big
[51:32] church.
[51:34] You may not have church like when you
[51:36] pass and you see denomination church
[51:40] big parking lot. But thank God you are
[51:44] that despise fuel. You are that and you
[51:48] are the apple of his eye that you are
[51:51] the people that he come and died for us.
[51:56] Thank you Lord. You are a blessed
[51:58] people.
[52:00] To them that overcome will grant to sit
[52:03] with him in his throne. But you have to
[52:06] go through
[52:07] persecution. I'm not preaching no better
[52:10] roses gospel.

[52:15] be tried. You have to be pressurized.
[52:20] You think a juster you want to be number
[52:24] as eagle.
[52:26] You want to be eagle. Eagle is the most
[52:30] pressurized board. You just sail and go
[52:33] and go and go. You have to build a
[52:36] certain way. So if you are build that
[52:39] certain way, pressure.
[52:42] There was a a young man come up to a
[52:45] pastor, "Pastor, I want to be a strong
[52:47] Christian."
[52:48] And the pastor said, "Lord, give him
[52:50] trouble.
[52:52] Pressure him. Give him trial."
[52:55] Amen. He said, "Pastor, no, no. I want
[52:58] to be a He said, "You can't be a strong
[53:01] Christian without testing,
[53:04] trial,
[53:05] pressure."
[53:06] [Music]
[53:09] Amen.
[53:10] If he get young man here, if you ask me
[53:14] that, tell me that you want to be
[53:16] strong. Yeah. I said, well, I start you
[53:20] out with 20 push-ups, but you're going
[53:23] to exceed 200.
[53:26] I want you to do so much squat.
[53:30] Bunning, you weak.
[53:35] So, as I give you walk, push-ups, squat.
[53:40] sit up. Yeah. I start to exercise you
[53:44] and after that when 20 push-up you when

[57:34] That when that blood from Jesus have
[57:38] they crucify
[57:39] him and that blood had a life
[57:43] because Jesus said I have power to lay
[57:47] down my head and to take it up again.

[57:54] disciple. I will not leave you
[57:56] comfortless.
[57:59] I will be with you. Yes.

[58:19] he tell them go and t Acts 1 and8
[58:24] he said you shall receive power after

[59:46] Are you in that number?
[59:50] There was a orange tree and the prophet
[59:53] of God went in a orange grove and he see
[59:56] a orange tree and he see this orange
[59:59] tree but it's a orange tree but he get
[1:00:02] lime.

[1:00:44] say okay for them sister wear pants
[1:00:47] because
[1:00:49] the place does
[1:00:52] cold. The prophet of God has a provided
[1:00:56] way. It's a
[1:00:58] abomination for a woman to put on a
[1:01:01] garment that pertain to a man. It's a
[1:01:05] abomination. If it's a a bom. So you
[1:01:08] can't tell me that winter I used to be
[1:01:10] there when that preach. Yes. But winter
[1:01:14] now and think word of God don't change.
[1:01:19] Heaven and earth pass away. But not one
[1:01:22] jot or title of his word. If you add to
[1:01:25] this scripture, he will add plagues to
[1:01:27] your life. If you take out from the
[1:01:30] scripture, he will take out your life.
[1:01:34] But thank God. So he asked the question
[1:01:37] when again will this limb next year
[1:01:42] bear orange?
[1:01:48] No assemblies of God bear that fruit how
[1:01:52] long he remain assemblies of God. Yeah.
[1:01:56] So he said when again he said unless
[1:02:00] it put forth another truth from the
[1:02:05] original.
[1:02:07] So that's why you can find
[1:02:10] denomination. They using the same word
[1:02:13] of God that you reading from and they
[1:02:16] but the fruits
[1:02:19] show what they bearing.

[1:02:38] gospel. Amen.

[1:18:47] in prison
[1:18:49] for? a
[1:18:52] woman fortune telling
[1:18:56] and telling and they make good money out
[1:18:58] of her.
[1:19:01] And she telling the truth,
[1:19:05] she tell that these men are man of God
[1:19:11] and these men bring salvation to the
[1:19:15] truth. M yeah. So what we would have do,
[1:19:18] we would have run and say, "Yes, you are
[1:19:20] a woman of God.
[1:19:24] But thank God there was a prophet. He
[1:19:28] see he's a eagle and he see different.
[1:19:33] He see that that is a evil spirit on
[1:19:36] that woman and he cast out a demon from
[1:19:40] from Satan prophesy to Satan see vision
[1:19:45] to Satan could have said these men are
[1:19:48] man of God they preaching salvation
[1:19:52] but what the denomination will do this
[1:19:54] is a woman this a prophetist bring them
[1:19:58] start to a next
[1:19:59] organization connect it to to we
[1:20:02] denomination
[1:20:03] connect it and bear same sinful fruit.
[1:20:08] But Paul a eagle eye looked down and
[1:20:11] said it's a evil spirit. I command you
[1:20:14] Satan get out of her
[1:20:19] and the business done.
[1:20:22] They making money from how and they put
[1:20:25] them in prison and not only prison they
[1:20:28] scourge them proper but look a man of
[1:20:32] God although pain all over with lashion
[1:20:36] in prison they start to praise God they
[1:20:40] start to pray and there came something
[1:20:44] happened the prison start to rock
[1:20:47] earthquakes start to happen all the
[1:20:50] shackles and everything that was on
[1:20:52] their feet start to loose.
[1:20:56] All them other prisoners start to move.
[1:20:59] Then this this guard that keeping the
[1:21:02] gate, he realizes death to make prisoner
[1:21:07] release is death. Yeah. So before he got
[1:21:10] to be punished to death, not just you
[1:21:13] know what I'm saying, bow or or kill
[1:21:15] you. They go torture you piece by piece.
[1:21:18] So you got dead but with punishment. So
[1:21:21] he know the punishment. So he decide to
[1:21:24] go and kill your own self.
[1:21:29] I said no no no we not like them rest
[1:21:32] people we are here. Yes. And that man
[1:21:36] could have see God in prisoner.
[1:21:40] And that prisoner accept he and his
[1:21:43] household accept Christ that night and
[1:21:46] being baptized the same night. Now

[1:25:28] he the one that pay to redeem when satan
[1:25:32] get us in his pawn shop he's the one
[1:25:35] come and he paid hallelujah the price he

[1:26:01] and he gone and when he gone he
[1:26:04] gone preaching to the souls that did not
[1:26:07] repent.
[1:26:10] So, brethren,

[1:26:14] Repent now. You have a chance to repent.
[1:26:19] You have a chance to you you may do some
[1:26:23] crooked thing.

[1:27:21] you do the wrong and you say, "Lord,
[1:27:23] forgive me." And you do it again.
[1:27:27] No. This gospel is a straight and narrow
[1:27:31] road. There was a woman one
[1:27:34] time she pray she's a church Sunday
[1:27:37] school teacher
[1:27:40] and she husband I want deacon
[1:27:42] in the church and she going up for
[1:27:47] prayer soon as alter call she run up
[1:27:50] pray and she getting worse and worse and
[1:27:54] worse
[1:27:56] and now the she pastor said watch go to
[1:28:00] Brother Brana, he's a prophet.
[1:28:04] He does see thing
[1:28:07] and and he called the prophet and he
[1:28:10] said, "I was send one of my member. We
[1:28:14] don't know all the and but she getting
[1:28:16] nervous. She she she tripping out."
[1:28:19] Yeah.
[1:28:22] And he
[1:28:24] went he said, "Watch. Go and talk to my
[1:28:27] wife. Spend some time I go in choir and
[1:28:32] as soon as I call you
[1:28:35] come and he start to see
[1:28:39] I thank God for a prophet like that and
[1:28:42] he start to see and he
[1:28:47] said I see you in a car
[1:28:51] I'm not in no car I never know he said
[1:28:54] no just sit still you only can tell what
[1:28:57] you see your husband is a blondheaded
[1:29:01] man
[1:29:03] and I see you with a blackheaded man.
[1:29:10] She jump
[1:29:12] and she scream out. She say I make it
[1:29:15] right with God. He say you're not sin
[1:29:18] against God. You sin against your
[1:29:21] marriage vow.
[1:29:24] No matter if a gallon of olive oil you
[1:29:26] pour on him and pray and son. No, you
[1:29:29] got to go back to the husband that you
[1:29:32] sin against.
[1:29:35] You said no. You put me away. Said God,
[1:29:38] you prefer God put you away. You better
[1:29:40] your husband put you away. But he said,
[1:29:43] "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1:29:46] I see something else. Your husband have
[1:29:48] the same." She said, "No, he's a deacon
[1:29:52] in the church." Deacon Donna said
[1:29:55] nothing.
[1:29:56] deacon in the church.
[1:30:01] If you not get a Holy Ghost, you do
[1:30:03] nonsense.
[1:30:04] Whether you're a deacon in the church,
[1:30:09] so he said, "Well, all
[1:30:11] right, take the phone and call your
[1:30:14] husband."
[1:30:18] And when he said
[1:30:20] what? And they make it right.
[1:30:24] And after that she have been forgiven.
[1:30:27] The husband have been forgiven. So
[1:30:29] brethren, this road is a straight and
[1:30:32] narrow road. If you have sin against
[1:30:35] this brother, come and face him. I said,
[1:30:38] brothers, I've been talking your name
[1:30:40] behind your back. And I want I I beg
[1:30:44] you, forgive me. I tell you, if this
[1:30:46] brother ever trust you before, he trusts
[1:30:49] you more now. Amen. If I I have done
[1:30:53] something wrong to brother Joshua
[1:30:56] and I have done something wrong and
[1:30:59] doing it sideway sideway and I make so
[1:31:02] now and I walk up to him and say brother
[1:31:06] Joshua such and such people I tell I

[1:31:16] wrong I ask you to forgive me I tell you

[1:31:23] before. Don't make Satan lie to you that
[1:31:27] what brother Joshua he will trust you
[1:31:29] more. So
[1:31:31] repent. Repent of all your sins. You
[1:31:34] have no right to keep any malice. You
[1:31:37] have no right to keep any any hatred in
[1:31:41] your heart because he is coming back for
[1:31:44] the honest in heart. He is coming back
[1:31:48] for a bride without spot or wrinkle. He
[1:31:52] is coming back for a glorious church.
