[0:06] Amen. I greet you all in the lovely
[0:08] name, the holy name of our Lord and
[0:10] Savior Jesus Christ. It's good to be in
[0:12] the house of the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[0:15] Amen. So, we are not uh governed by
[0:18] weather conditions and uh changing
[0:21] seasons. Amen. But we are governed by
[0:24] the word of the Lord. Amen. So, we
[0:27] forsake not the assembling together of
[0:28] ourselves. So greet you once again in
[0:30] Jesus name. Amen. So I want to speak on
[0:32] in changing seasons the word is our
[0:34] constant. Amen. And I want to declare
[0:37] over this church that the season has
[0:39] changed. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[0:43] The season has changed but sometimes you
[0:46] got to recognize the season changing.
[0:48] Amen. If we don't we'll miss it. Amen.
[0:51] Praise the Lord. But in every changing
[0:53] season, the word is constant. Amen.
[0:56] Amen. In fact, the word can also be used
[0:59] to change seasons, to change
[1:01] circumstances, because the word of God
[1:04] is the ultimate. He says, "Heavens and
[1:06] earth will pass away, but my word will
[1:08] not pass away." Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:11] Let's just get to our Bible reading and
[1:13] we'll we'll read Isaiah 43.
[1:17] We'll read from verse 18.
[1:21] Amen. Brothers, if you can just get me
[1:23] the HDMI.
[1:26] Remember he not the former things,
[1:29] neither consider the things of old. Now,
[1:32] how many of us like to sit and and
[1:34] remember our past?
[1:37] We constantly want to move forward
[1:40] like a crab
[1:42] looking back.
[1:45] Amen.
[1:46] We we're always trying to bring our sin
[1:49] and our past life above the blood of
[1:50] Jesus
[1:53] because we don't realize the cleansing
[1:55] power of Jesus.
[1:57] He says, "Remember he not the former
[2:00] things, neither consider the things of
[2:02] old. Behold, I will do a new thing."
[2:06] Hallelujah. Thank you. People want to
[2:08] still go back to denomination style, but
[2:11] he's done a new thing when he opened the
[2:13] seals. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:16] Amen. He said, "A new land was open to
[2:18] us." Praise the Lord. Now it shall
[2:21] spring forth. Shall ye not know it? I
[2:25] will even make a way in the wilderness.
[2:28] That's changing seasons now. And rivers
[2:31] in the deserts.
[2:33] Amen. Praise the Lord. You may be
[2:35] seated.
[2:38] In Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse one,
[2:41] it says, "To everything there is a
[2:43] season. Amen. You mean there's a season
[2:46] over my finances? Well, well, what does
[2:48] the word everything mean?
[2:50] You mean there's a season to uh
[2:53] different situations in my life?
[2:56] Now, a season, I want you to know,
[2:58] normally last three months.
[3:01] In the natural,
[3:04] hallelujah. So, if you are stuck in a
[3:06] season
[3:09] for too long, something is wrong.
[3:13] Amen.
[3:14] A season is supposed to last for 3
[3:16] months and then the next season comes
[3:19] upon you. And nothing can stop the power
[3:21] of a season coming upon you. Amen.
[3:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. So we're looking
[3:27] at it says to everything there is a
[3:29] season and a time to every purpose under
[3:32] the heaven.
[3:34] Hallelujah. So you're trying to get out
[3:37] of your situation, trying to get out of
[3:39] your problem, but God is saying there's
[3:40] a purpose for it.
[3:42] So in other words, if we are not
[3:44] learning the lesson that God is trying
[3:45] to teach us, he's going to keep us in
[3:47] that season.
[3:50] If we are stubborn, arrogant, and don't
[3:52] want to conform to the things of God,
[3:54] he's going to keep us in that holding
[3:56] pattern in that season until we learn to
[3:59] obey his word. You say, give me an
[4:01] example. 40 years the children wandered
[4:03] in the wilderness, children of Israel,
[4:07] and if you know something, they were
[4:09] wandering around the mountain. Yes, they
[4:11] were going in a circle
[4:15] and God kept them there because of
[4:17] disobedience.
[4:19] Amen. And the prophet says it could have
[4:21] been a three-day journey,
[4:24] but yet it took them 40 years.
[4:26] Amen. Because they didn't understand how
[4:30] to obey God's word in changing seasons.
[4:34] You can continue to read it and see
[4:38] the different things. Amen. and a time
[4:39] to be born. You know, all of these
[4:41] things very popular when it drop down to
[4:42] verse 11. But throughout all the
[4:46] seasons, God, we've been speaking about
[4:47] shaping and molding us. Look what verse
[4:49] 11 says that he had made everything
[4:53] beautiful in his time. Amen.
[4:56] Praise the Lord. So is God holding their
[5:00] seasons changing because he's making our
[5:02] lives beautiful according to his
[5:04] timeline.
[5:06] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[5:10] Also he had set the world.
[5:13] He had made everything beautiful in his
[5:14] time. Also he had set the world in their
[5:16] heart so that no man can find out the
[5:18] work that God maketh from the beginning
[5:21] to the end. Amen. I want to read one
[5:23] more portion of scripture here in uh the
[5:25] book of Daniel chapter 2.
[5:30] Praise the Lord.
[5:34] From verse 19. Amen.
[5:40] Then was a secret the secret revealed
[5:42] unto Daniel in the night vision. Then
[5:46] Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel
[5:48] answered and said, "Blessed be the God
[5:50] name of God forever and ever, for his
[5:53] wisdom and might are his, and he changed
[5:56] the times and the
[5:59] seasons." So who is changing this? God
[6:03] is changing it. He spoke his word in the
[6:06] beginning. He said the greater light
[6:08] I'll set in the skies. And he says the
[6:10] lesser light will be for times and
[6:12] seasons.
[6:14] Praise the Lord. So by his spoken word,
[6:16] he's saying he changes times and
[6:18] seasons. He removeth kings and setth up
[6:21] kings. He giveth wisdom unto the wise,
[6:23] and knowledge to them that knowing. He
[6:26] revealth the deep and secret things. He
[6:29] knoweth what is in the darkness, and the
[6:31] light dwelleth with him. I thank thee
[6:33] and praise thee, oh God of my fathers,
[6:36] who has given me wisdom and might, and
[6:38] has made me and has made known unto me
[6:41] now what we desire of thee. For thou has
[6:43] now made known unto us the king's
[6:45] matter.
[6:47] Amen. I can jump right ahead there.
[6:50] Amen. But I'm trying not to get there.
[6:52] But the mind of Christ has been revealed
[6:54] to us. Amen. The king's matter has been
[6:57] revealed to us.
[6:59] Every mystery plan of redemption,
[7:02] everything that was held once in the
[7:03] back part of God's mind has now been
[7:05] made known to us. Amen. The king's
[7:07] matter, the king's heart has been
[7:09] revealed to us. Amen. The king has held
[7:12] nothing from us. Amen.
[7:15] Praise the Lord. Amen. The entire plan
[7:18] of redemption, the plan of salvation has
[7:20] been revealed to us.
[7:23] And it's come down to make us understand
[7:25] that we are part of the mystery of God.
[7:28] Hallelujah. God's final dwelling place
[7:31] is in man. Hallelujah. God wants to have
[7:35] the preeminence in us. God wants to have
[7:38] rulership through us. Amen. So, praise
[7:40] the Lord. Now, so we've got this here. I
[7:43] just want to lay this quote down then we
[7:44] can continue.
[7:47] Amen. Tell me if you can see it. I need
[7:50] to duplicate or what do I do? Duplicate.
[8:00] Praise the Lord.
[8:04] Is it coming? Yeah.
[8:08] Now he says here the prophet is saying
[8:10] this now in the message the hour has
[8:13] come. He says now Jesus was speaking. He
[8:16] said father the time has come. Now
[8:19] there's seasons for everything. Do you
[8:21] believe that you sow in a certain season
[8:24] and you reap in a certain season?
[8:28] So the Bible also says don't grow weary
[8:30] in doing well. Amen. For in due time you
[8:34] shall reap. Amen. So always sow good
[8:37] seeds in every season because there's
[8:40] going to come a harvest.
[8:43] So continue to sow good seeds. Continue
[8:46] to do good deeds. Amen. That's sewing
[8:47] seeds. continue to sew the word of God
[8:50] in people's heart because you are sowing
[8:52] now. Amen. In in springtime,
[8:56] but summer is coming,
[8:58] when whatsoever you have sown, you are
[9:00] going to reap.
[9:02] So I'm saying again, don't sow anger.
[9:05] Don't sow discord.
[9:07] Don't sow, Amen. depression and anxiety.
[9:11] Because at our time, you are going to
[9:13] have a tree that's a miss.
[9:16] So sow good seeds. Speak good words. You
[9:20] know your words are a seed. Speak good
[9:22] words over people. Speak kindness over
[9:25] people.
[9:27] Amen. Don't ever say that person is
[9:29] beyond redemption or beyond salvation or
[9:31] they're good for nothing. Amen. Speak
[9:33] good words and say, "I see you coming to
[9:35] serve the Lord. I see." Amen. You're a
[9:37] son of God. You're a daughter of God.
[9:40] Amen. Hallelujah. He says there's
[9:42] seasons for everything. Do you believe
[9:44] that you sow in a certain season? Yes.
[9:48] And you reap in a certain season. And
[9:51] there's seasons when the time comes
[9:53] that's right for things to happen. Do
[9:55] you believe that?
[9:57] Now, if we are waiting for a particular
[9:59] season to come and it doesn't happen, do
[10:02] we get despondent?
[10:03] Do we get depressed? Do we get
[10:06] frustrated? The human part of it wants
[10:08] frustrations and say, "Lord, how long?
[10:14] But the spiritual man says, "Lord, I
[10:16] know you are working everything together
[10:18] for my good."
[10:20] Hallelujah. Now, he says here, we have
[10:22] families. Every family in here is
[10:25] accustomed to that. Sometimes everything
[10:28] will run fine for you for years.
[10:31] So, you're in a good season.
[10:34] Then all at once, you lit a spell where
[10:36] we say it many times in the south, when
[10:38] it rains, it pours and everything goes
[10:41] wrong.
[10:43] He says you're going through a night
[10:45] time,
[10:47] then there's a daybreak, then a night
[10:49] time. Everything runs in continuity.
[10:53] Amen. Hallelujah. So God has got you
[10:56] there for a purpose.
[10:58] Amen. God knows you're a son of daughter
[11:00] of God and you're not moved by
[11:01] circumstances.
[11:03] Hallelujah. Lord, remember earth is
[11:07] man's testing ground after the fall.
[11:09] Yes, he put you here on the earth for a
[11:11] reason. He chose you. He didn't choose
[11:13] the Apostle Paul for this time and
[11:15] season. Neither did he choose the other
[11:18] church age messengers to stand here at
[11:20] the end time after the opening of the
[11:22] word. But he chose you because you have
[11:24] a particular seed gene within you that's
[11:27] able to withstand this day, that's able
[11:30] to withstand Satan's Eden. You have a
[11:32] rare quality about you. You don't have
[11:34] the spirit of a lion, the anointing of a
[11:37] lion. Neither did you have the anointing
[11:39] of a ox. You don't have the anointing of
[11:41] a man. But the spirit of the flying
[11:43] eagle has come to anoint you in this
[11:45] hour. Amen. To take you out into the
[11:48] heavenlies.
[11:50] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. So, we got
[11:53] to recognize who we are. Amen. Praise
[11:56] the Lord. Is this thing misbehaving?
[11:59] Let's just leave it for now, right? I
[12:00] just wanted to set my quotes and then
[12:02] it's fine. Hallelujah.
[12:05] So he's saying there's continuity in
[12:08] everything. There's a season for
[12:09] everything.
[12:12] Now sometimes because of stubbornness
[12:14] like we said the children of Israel,
[12:17] you can remain in your pattern. That's
[12:19] right. The prophet of God says you can
[12:21] continue to smoke but get the Holy Ghost
[12:23] on you one time. And see if you want to
[12:26] smoke again. So if you got continue to
[12:29] have bad habits, don't think you got the
[12:30] Holy Ghost. You can't fool yourself. You
[12:33] can't fool us because the Holy Ghost
[12:35] won't want to smoke. The Holy Ghost
[12:38] won't want to drink.
[12:40] Hallelujah. So, the thing that you need
[12:42] to do is humble yourself and say, "Lord,
[12:44] give me the Holy Ghost."
[12:48] Hallelujah. You got bad habits. You
[12:50] You're continuing in a cycle. Amen. Pray
[12:53] for the Holy Ghost. Amen. Praise the
[12:56] Lord.
[12:57] Now, like we were saying that when when
[13:00] the season changes, God wants us to live
[13:02] in abundance.
[13:05] God wants us to live in fruitfulness. We
[13:07] can't be living dry and barren lives
[13:09] when we have the full opening of the
[13:11] word. We're supposed to be living in
[13:13] abundance. Our lives ought to be rich.
[13:15] Our lives ought to be full of joy, full
[13:17] of happiness, full of peace. Amen. We
[13:20] are to be the light of the world in this
[13:22] time and season.
[13:24] Amen. Hallelujah.
[13:26] Now if you look at Luke chapter 15 there
[13:28] and from verse 17 the Bible says that
[13:31] this this uh we well they call him the
[13:33] prodigal he came to himself which mean
[13:36] his season had changed.
[13:39] How about we come to our senses even
[13:41] tonight.
[13:43] And realize what God has called us for.
[13:46] Amen. When he came to himself he starts
[13:49] to talk about father's house. He starts
[13:52] to talk about his heart being turned
[13:54] back to the faith. Amen. So when the
[13:57] season change, God is going to take you
[13:59] back to where you're supposed to be.
[14:02] And notice it's in verse 17. We don't
[14:04] have it here, but you find it in your
[14:06] Bible. 17. We know brother George Martin
[14:09] explained to us very well what 17 means.
[14:11] It's a system change. Things are
[14:14] changing.
[14:15] Amen. The number 17 means things
[14:17] changing.
[14:18] So it's found in verse 17. He came to
[14:21] himself.
[14:25] His mind changed.
[14:27] Praise the Lord. And he starts to talk
[14:30] about his father's house. He talks to
[14:32] about amen what his father has and what
[14:34] the servants are eating. And he says, "I
[14:36] will arise and go to my father." So he
[14:39] was going from lack to abundance.
[14:42] Even tonight you can go from lack to
[14:44] abundance.
[14:46] What was needed? A journey back to
[14:48] father's house. a journey of repentance.
[14:51] Amen. You can go from lack to abundance.
[14:53] Amen. You can go from famine to feast.
[14:56] He was sitting there eating pig food,
[14:58] but he was going on his way to a feast
[15:01] that he didn't know about.
[15:03] Hallelujah. Amen. He was sitting there
[15:06] with a servant mentality, but he was
[15:08] going to move from a servant to a son.
[15:10] Why? The season had changed.
[15:15] Hallelujah. Amen. So in the time
[15:18] appointed of the father, in the right
[15:20] time, Amen. It's the changing of
[15:21] seasons. So we are to prepare to receive
[15:24] our greatest blessing right now.
[15:28] Amen. Hallelujah. God is about to pour
[15:31] out his power upon the church in such a
[15:33] way right before Amen. they come to
[15:36] close the doors. Thank you, Jesus. He
[15:39] says, "Wait until that happens." The
[15:41] squeeze comes. He says, "Watch the third
[15:43] pulled in." Right now, we've seen all
[15:46] the mechanics of what they've been
[15:48] trying to do. Soon, you will see Satan
[15:50] in his dynamics. But you're going to see
[15:52] a greater dynamics in the church of
[15:54] Jesus Christ, in the body of Jesus
[15:56] Christ. Amen. Because greater is he that
[15:59] is in you than he that is in the world.
[16:03] Hallelujah. He says they'll have power
[16:05] to shut the heavens. Amen. They'll have
[16:07] power to speak
[16:10] and it'll create itself. He says it
[16:12] won't be for a very long time. He says,
[16:15] "But it'll be there." Praise the Lord.
[16:18] Hallelujah.
[16:20] So, prepare to receive your greatest
[16:22] blessing.
[16:24] Amen.
[16:26] Obedience to the word of God.
[16:28] Hallelujah, sir. Will entitle you to
[16:31] everything that the prophet prophesied
[16:32] about this people. Amen. This end time
[16:35] people. Praise the Lord. So, the Lord is
[16:38] pouring out at this time is favor. Yes,
[16:40] sir. Do you know what about Do you know
[16:42] there's something about favor?
[16:45] When God pours out his favor upon you,
[16:47] it's unstoppable.
[16:52] Hallelujah. When this boy was coming
[16:54] back to his father, his father had comp
[16:57] the Bible says he had compassion. He
[16:59] hugged him and he kissed him. His favor
[17:02] was turned to his son. Hallelujah. And
[17:04] when God has favor upon you, nothing can
[17:06] stop it. He says, "Jacob have I loved
[17:10] and Esau have I hated." Amen. While they
[17:13] were yet in the mother's womb, God has
[17:16] favor upon you. Amen. The reason that
[17:18] you believe the message of the hour, the
[17:21] reason there's something there to
[17:22] respond to the call of the prophet
[17:25] because God has favor upon you, God has
[17:28] placed his mark upon you already. Amen.
[17:31] God has placed his seal upon you that
[17:34] you can never be lost. Thank you, Lord.
[17:37] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, it's a time
[17:40] now when he's going to pour out his
[17:42] favor upon the repenting sons and
[17:44] daughters who have been whose hearts
[17:46] have been turned back to the faith of
[17:47] the fathers. Amen. Amen.
[17:51] We find one time here in this time of
[17:53] famine. Amen. Uh it was going to come
[17:56] now where Elijah the prophet in one
[17:58] kings chapter 18
[18:02] he said you remember what he said it
[18:04] won't rain until I call for it. Amen.
[18:09] Amen. 1 Kings chapter 18 verse 43 to 44.
[18:16] But then when the season was changing,
[18:20] Elijah asked his servant. He says, "Go
[18:22] up now. Look toward the sea."
[18:26] And he went up and looked and said,
[18:28] "There is nothing."
[18:32] And he said go again seven times.
[18:38] Hallelujah.
[18:41] Now if we had gone six times
[18:45] that would have been seven times.
[18:49] How many of you calculating quickly
[18:50] here? He went the first time. That was
[18:52] number one.
[18:54] Then he said go again seven times. So
[18:57] altogether he went how many times?
[19:00] Very good.
[19:02] Amen. Some of you still calculating.
[19:05] So he went at the eighth time.
[19:10] And it came to pass, Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:13] That he said, "Behold, there ariseth a
[19:15] little cloud out of the sea
[19:20] like a man's hand."
[19:23] So let's say that was a glimmer of hope,
[19:26] like what I'm preaching to you tonight.
[19:29] to pull you out of your season.
[19:33] All you may see is a little cloud the
[19:35] size of a man's hand. Hallelujah. Amen.
[19:40] Amen. And he said, "Go up and say to
[19:43] Hab, prepare thy chariot and get thee
[19:46] down, that the rain stop thee not."
[19:49] Praise the Lord.
[19:51] He is seeing the cloud the size of a
[19:53] man's hand. Elijah says, "I hear the
[19:55] sound of the abundance of rain."
[19:57] He even tells Ahab, "Get onto your
[19:59] chariot and start moving."
[20:03] Don't stop for the rain. There's no
[20:05] rain. There's famine.
[20:07] But all he sees is a little cloud.
[20:11] What is that teaching us?
[20:14] When we see a scripture,
[20:17] by his stripes, you are healed. Even in
[20:19] your sickness, start to see yourself
[20:22] already healed. Amen. Start to call
[20:25] those things which are not as though
[20:26] they are.
[20:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. I see the
[20:31] cloud the size of a man's hand and I
[20:34] hear the abundance of the sound of rain.
[20:36] Amen.
[20:38] Now, in 1 Kings chapter 17, I'm just
[20:40] going to go over a few things here.
[20:41] Amen. A few examples before we pray.
[20:44] What we do in our dry season matters.
[20:48] What we're doing when we're going
[20:49] through famine matters. You remember the
[20:52] prophet just says we go through dry
[20:53] spells. Every family will feel that way.
[20:56] Sometimes it'll feel like your prayer
[20:57] life is dry. Sometimes it might feel
[21:00] like your prayers are hitting the
[21:01] ceiling and coming back down. Feel like
[21:04] dry. But what we do in those dry seasons
[21:10] matters.
[21:11] Praise the Lord. There was this woman in
[21:14] one kings happens to be chapter 17
[21:16] again. Amen.
[21:18] that
[21:20] she all she sees is a man coming to her
[21:23] and telling her, "Bake me a cake."
[21:29] Amen.
[21:31] But it was a dry season. It was famine.
[21:34] Praise the Lord.
[21:36] If you if you go to that scripture,
[21:38] you'll find here that she is making a
[21:40] confession. Amen. 1 Kings chapter 17
[21:44] she's telling him
[21:53] as the Lord and she said as the Lord thy
[21:55] God liveth I have not a cake but a
[21:57] handful of meal in a barrel and a little
[22:00] oil in a cruise and behold I am
[22:02] gathering two sticks that I may go in
[22:04] and dress it for me and my son that we
[22:07] may eat it and die
[22:10] that is her confession that is what she
[22:12] understands. She knows there's a famine
[22:14] in the land. This is the last portion of
[22:16] meat or bread that she's going to eat.
[22:20] And she says, "We are going to die."
[22:22] She's preparing for death. Hallelujah.
[22:26] But she does not know that she's
[22:28] encountering Elijah the prophet.
[22:32] And Elijah the prophet is going to
[22:33] change. Now remember, the famine does
[22:36] not end for the outside people.
[22:40] It only ends for whom the word of God is
[22:42] sent to.
[22:45] Hallelujah.
[22:46] It's only for Elijah and the woman
[22:50] that is kept sustained in this time.
[22:53] So outside in Leosia in denominations
[22:57] there is famine.
[23:00] There is gross darkness. Their churches
[23:02] look like nightclubs.
[23:05] Come on now.
[23:09] If you remember, some of you young
[23:11] people won't remember churches how they
[23:14] used to be. It was sacred. It was holy.
[23:20] There came a time when it was around the
[23:23] time when the song storm came out.
[23:28] And the pastors started to get into a
[23:30] frenzy.
[23:33] I know because I worked at the music
[23:34] store at that time. and they started to
[23:36] come into the store and started to look
[23:38] at lights.
[23:40] So I asked them, "Why do you want
[23:41] lights?" He says, "We're losing a lot of
[23:44] our young people to the clubs.
[23:47] So we want to put some of these lights
[23:49] in the church
[23:51] and attract them to come into the church
[23:54] instead of going in the clubs."
[23:57] They didn't use the word to correct
[24:00] them. They wanted to make the church
[24:02] conform to the world.
[24:06] So that's how the lights came into the
[24:08] church.
[24:10] Amen. Disco lights.
[24:13] You go to a church and that's why the
[24:15] Catholics are shocked. Because the
[24:18] daughters have gone wild.
[24:22] You don't feel like anything holy there,
[24:23] anything sacred.
[24:25] Amen. You walk into the church,
[24:27] everything is black
[24:29] because they flimming now. They want the
[24:32] video to come nice.
[24:34] Praise the Lord.
[24:37] So they have they have settled for
[24:38] church programs instead of the true word
[24:41] of God. They are not willing to tell the
[24:43] women anything about the way they dress.
[24:46] Not willing to tell the men anything
[24:48] about the way they dress. Not willing to
[24:50] tell the people about how they should
[24:51] live. All they preach about is God is
[24:54] going to bless you. They like the word
[24:57] seasons, too. What we're talking about,
[24:58] this is your season. This is your year.
[25:02] And every year is their season. And
[25:04] every year is their year. All you got to
[25:07] do is sew into my ministry.
[25:12] Can I get 10 people to raise a hand
[25:13] who's going to sew?
[25:16] But that's their message.
[25:19] Partner with me.
[25:22] Amen. Tap into the anointing.
[25:26] Now, while all of those things carry
[25:28] truth, that's not the main focus.
[25:34] Hallelujah. Because you know, for every
[25:36] bogus, there must be an original.
[25:39] There wasn't Janice Jamas first. There
[25:42] was Moses first.
[25:45] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[25:48] So, they changed the order. There's my
[25:51] point was there's famine out there but
[25:53] there's only now light in goan there's
[25:56] only food for the bride what we have is
[25:58] the message of the hour and let me ask
[26:00] you this way are we still feasting on
[26:03] the message of the hour
[26:05] in the course of the week are we
[26:07] feasting with the message of the hour
[26:10] are we spending time with this prophet
[26:12] that we say we believe that was sent to
[26:14] us to turn our hearts back to the faith
[26:15] of the fathers are we really listening
[26:17] to it
[26:19] amen Amen. Or we just get a quote here
[26:21] on the Sunday or quote on a witness day
[26:24] maybe occasionally on the group. Amen.
[26:28] This is our life.
[26:30] This is what changes us. The word of
[26:32] God, the revealed word of God. He says,
[26:34] "Amen." When those seals were open, the
[26:36] Bible became a new book to us.
[26:40] Amen. So this woman, what she did in the
[26:42] time of famine took her out of her
[26:44] season. Even though the season in the
[26:48] country was still famine. How many of
[26:50] you getting my point?
[26:52] So she was fed. She she had to feed the
[26:54] word prophet.
[26:57] Elijah was a word prophet. This woman by
[27:01] giving him a cake was feeding the word
[27:02] prophet.
[27:04] Hallelujah. And giving life to his
[27:06] words.
[27:10] Do you know if she disobeyed him, she
[27:12] had a choice to make. Either I'll obey
[27:14] this prophet Yeah, because he said if
[27:17] you do this, the cruise of oil will not
[27:18] run dry. Your barrel will not run dry.
[27:23] But she could have killed the prophet's
[27:24] word with disobedience. But she chose to
[27:27] give life to the prophet's words. Amen.
[27:30] By giving him a cake. Thank you, Lord.
[27:34] Hallelujah.
[27:36] So, obey what the prophet says and you
[27:38] will be be sustained in the time of
[27:40] famine.
[27:41] Amen. She had the choice to make and her
[27:44] season changed.
[27:47] Praise the Lord.
[27:50] Amen.
[27:53] This same woman, death strikes a home in
[27:55] verse 17, season change again. This is
[27:58] in 1 Kings 17. But in verse 17, her son
[28:02] dies.
[28:04] Hallelujah.
[28:07] Her son dies, but she's got a choice to
[28:10] make.
[28:12] What does she do?
[28:14] She calls the prophet.
[28:18] Amen.
[28:20] She called the prophet and says, "What
[28:23] do I have to do with thee, thou men of
[28:24] God? Had thou come unto me to call my
[28:27] sin to remembrance and slay my son?" And
[28:30] he said, "Give me your son." Amen.
[28:35] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. I don't
[28:37] think we are sufficiently impressed with
[28:39] the word that's in our midst
[28:42] because the word in our midst has power
[28:45] of resurrection.
[28:50] Do you know right now within us we are
[28:52] carrying
[28:54] that resurrection power?
[28:58] Let me say it this way. We are carrying
[29:00] the message of the voice of the
[29:02] resurrection
[29:04] because that's the next thing to take
[29:06] place.
[29:08] You say what do you mean by that? I mean
[29:10] that when Jesus was coming to Lazarus
[29:12] tomb, he was the voice of the
[29:14] resurrection.
[29:16] Right? But when he met Martha, he
[29:19] started to explain to her how he is the
[29:21] resurrection and the life. So who had to
[29:25] carry the message of the voice of the
[29:27] resurrection to Mary?
[29:30] Martha was now carrying all that she had
[29:33] heard to pull Mary out of her condition.
[29:38] So she was carrying the message of the
[29:40] voice of the resurrection.
[29:42] Amen.
[29:44] She had to tell Mary, Jesus said, "He's
[29:46] the resurrection and the life." Jesus
[29:49] just told me, "My brother shall live
[29:50] again." She's carrying the message.
[29:53] Amen. That the sleeping saints are going
[29:55] to come forth. Thank you.
[29:58] Martha, I uh Mary, the shout pulled me.
[30:04] But now the voice of the resurrection
[30:06] told me that he's going to raise the
[30:07] sleeping saints.
[30:10] Hallelujah. Amen. That the dead in
[30:13] Christ shall first rise.
[30:17] Yes, sir. That I'm going to see my loved
[30:18] one again.
[30:20] She called Mary out of that house of
[30:23] mourning because of that message she was
[30:26] carrying. Amen. Amen.
[30:28] Mary came to see what the commotion was
[30:30] about because she went to her and said,
[30:32] "The master has come and call it for
[30:34] thee."
[30:36] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[30:40] So here we see that what we do in our
[30:42] dry season matters because now death
[30:44] strikes the home. The prophet now goes
[30:46] and lays on the boy three times. He
[30:49] makes his three pulls upon the boy and
[30:51] he puts hand upon hand. The Bible says
[30:54] here, he stretches himself across the
[30:57] child. Amen. Hallelujah.
[31:02] He brought him, it delivered him. So, he
[31:04] brought the child back to life.
[31:07] Then there's one more point I want to
[31:08] make in the in the other woman with
[31:10] Elisha
[31:13] is that I'm talking about the woman now
[31:16] who couldn't have a child. And you
[31:19] remember that the prophet says, "What
[31:21] can I do for you?"
[31:23] Amen. You don't have a son. And you
[31:24] remember she had a son. But then one day
[31:26] while he was in the field, you know, in
[31:28] the heat of the sun, he died.
[31:30] So this woman again had a choice to
[31:32] make.
[31:36] So if death strikes your home, what are
[31:38] we going to do?
[31:41] She chose to go to the word prophet.
[31:45] She chose to go back to the place where
[31:46] her heart was turned back. Mount Karma.
[31:50] You remember Mount Carmel showed?
[31:53] Elijah Elijah had turned the faith of
[31:56] the children back to the faith of the
[31:57] fathers.
[31:59] She chose to go back to that point. She
[32:02] chose to change the circumstance by the
[32:05] decision she made.
[32:07] She had a choice to make. She could have
[32:10] either sat there and cried.
[32:13] Her son had died. She could have decided
[32:16] to call the undertakers to come and
[32:18] fetch a son and make preparation for the
[32:21] funeral.
[32:23] Or she said, "I can believe the word.
[32:27] I can believe that this boy can be
[32:28] raised back to life."
[32:32] So she went to the source of the
[32:34] lifegiving word.
[32:37] And she decided to go to the word to do
[32:39] something about a situation. Amen. Amen.
[32:42] I'm going to close now. Amen. because
[32:44] she knew to to everything there's a
[32:46] season.
[32:48] She knew that she couldn't have a son
[32:50] and this one was given to her from the
[32:51] prophet by the spoken word. Amen.
[32:56] So she received him as one from the
[32:58] dead. So she knew that even though he
[32:59] was dead, if she can only get to that
[33:01] prophet, that boy will rise again.
[33:07] Amen.
[33:10] Now watch your choices you make. Maybe
[33:13] you've been like Martha and Mary and
[33:15] buried your dream, buried your desire.
[33:18] Amen. You buried, Amen. all that you
[33:21] thought you had in this life. But Jesus
[33:24] is here to tell you, Amen. that which is
[33:27] in the grave and that which you have
[33:29] buried, I have come to resurrect.
[33:32] I have come to change your season,
[33:34] Martha and Mary.
[33:37] Praise the Lord.
[33:41] Now, sometimes it'll take time for you
[33:44] to understand or comprehend what the
[33:45] Lord is saying. Even tonight,
[33:49] listen when the voice of resurrection is
[33:50] speaking.
[33:53] Martha and Mary didn't immediately
[33:54] comprehend what the Lord was saying.
[33:57] Praise the Lord. But I want to re
[34:01] reiterate
[34:03] that every dead situation,
[34:07] every dry season
[34:09] is coming back to life. Amen. Because we
[34:12] are under the greatest message, the
[34:15] message of life. Amen. What did brother
[34:18] Brandham call this message? The shout.
[34:21] He said it's a message going forth. He
[34:23] said it's the living bread of life.
[34:26] Amen. You can't be eating this message
[34:28] and be dead. Brother Brandham calls the
[34:31] shout the living bread of life. So if we
[34:34] are eating the message of the hour,
[34:36] there ought to be a life flowing out of
[34:38] us. I've got a river of life and it's
[34:41] flowing out of me.
[34:44] Praise the Lord.
[34:46] Amen.
[34:47] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now God is not
[34:51] going to change his program and his
[34:53] season just because we in unbelief.
[34:56] God don't work like that. When he came
[34:58] to Sarah there and Sarah was in unbelief
[35:02] and Sarah laughed in art. How can me
[35:05] being old have pleasure with my lord?
[35:08] Did God go away now and say ah you know
[35:09] Sarah is still in unbelief. Let me wait
[35:11] another three years because uh
[35:15] I'll send some tapes there and faith
[35:17] cometh by the hearing of the word and
[35:18] she'll let her faith levels raise up.
[35:21] When time and season comes around,
[35:24] God's got a clock.
[35:27] God's got a program he's working with.
[35:30] When God comes to your door
[35:34] and he's telling you, I'm going to visit
[35:35] you about the time of life.
[35:38] This time
[35:42] All you will make all your doubts
[35:44] disappear. Yes. Amen.
[35:49] Now I want to say this as well that the
[35:52] that scene has repeated in our day again
[35:54] the prophet says the final sign that we
[35:57] saw was a prophet with his back turned
[36:00] to the audience.
[36:05] Amen. So God is not going to change his
[36:07] program because we are not ready to cope
[36:09] with what God is doing.
[36:14] Shadow was having mind battles. I can't
[36:16] cope with what you're telling me. I'm
[36:18] going to be the word made flesh. I can't
[36:20] cope with it.
[36:23] I'm going to be a manifested son on the
[36:25] earth.
[36:27] All creation is waiting for you.
[36:31] Whether you can cope with it or not,
[36:32] it's going to happen.
[36:34] Amen. Amen. God's not going to change
[36:36] his program for you. You say, "Give me
[36:38] another example."
[36:41] Zachchariah had the example of Sarah and
[36:43] Abraham
[36:45] in the Bible. But when the angel came to
[36:47] him to tell him his wife is going to
[36:49] have a child, he was in doubt.
[36:53] Amen. Amen.
[36:57] And being a priest, he studied the word
[36:59] and he still doubted.
[37:01] He doubted how old his wife was. Amen.
[37:06] But the prophet now in the resurrection
[37:08] of Lazarus, he says, notice that the
[37:10] angel would of God would perform his
[37:12] word. He would bring his word to pass
[37:14] regardless.
[37:17] So which means in this time and season,
[37:20] it's the power of the spoken word,
[37:22] right?
[37:23] But if you don't want to accept it, God
[37:25] will strike you dumb.
[37:30] So in this time and season, either
[37:31] you're going to speak back what the
[37:32] angel of God said, Amen. Or you're going
[37:35] to remain dumb
[37:41] and you're going to see everyone else
[37:42] speak and you're going to be dumb.
[37:45] You're going to be asking for pen and
[37:46] page.
[37:50] Yeah. Yeah. That's what he was asking
[37:52] for. He was asking for pen and page
[37:54] because he he couldn't speak. He wanted
[37:56] to write.
[37:59] Hallelujah. Amen.
[38:03] Amen. So God's not going to wait for
[38:05] you.
[38:08] Because
[38:10] you're already hearing and understanding
[38:11] what we are saying. But you want to keep
[38:14] God in a holding pattern. Time and
[38:16] season has come now.
[38:19] God wants to use you now.
[38:24] Do you know how do you know who God
[38:26] wants to manifest his life through?
[38:31] Somebody say me.
[38:33] This time and season, it's not 2020
[38:36] 2025.
[38:39] Every generation has a chance at the
[38:40] word.
[38:42] God is telling you week after week, I
[38:44] want to use you. You are telling him,
[38:46] Lord, look how you used him.
[38:52] Hello.
[38:56] We tell everyone how God used somebody
[38:58] else.
[38:59] But God is saying, "Hey, I want to use
[39:00] you. It's 2025.
[39:04] This is the dead in Christ." Ah, come
[39:06] on, somebody. This is the dead in
[39:08] Christ.
[39:10] God always uses living beings.
[39:15] This prophet was sent to turn our hearts
[39:17] back to the faith. He says, "Behold, I
[39:19] send you, Elijah the prophet, to turn
[39:22] your hearts." Amen. After he has turned
[39:25] your hearts, God wants to now tabernacle
[39:28] you. Do you know that we are the
[39:30] tabernacle of the living God? Do you
[39:32] know God wants to tabernacle us? God
[39:34] wants to use us for his kingdom
[39:35] purposes, but we are so busy with the
[39:37] things of the world. We are so consumed
[39:39] with the things of the world that God
[39:41] can't use us.
[39:45] You telling me God can wake you up any
[39:47] day of the week and say, "My son, go and
[39:49] do this." You tell the Lord, I got to go
[39:52] to Renault.
[39:57] But I thought sons of God are led by the
[39:59] spirit of God.
[40:02] Hello.
[40:04] Are we able to hear the voice of God?
[40:08] God wants to use us.
[40:11] What we've become is full-time employees
[40:14] and part-time Christians.
[40:17] Well, let me say it again differently.
[40:20] We've become full-time employees of
[40:22] corporate companies and part-time
[40:27] workers in the kingdom.
[40:30] Hallelujah.
[40:32] You'll never phone your boss and tell
[40:33] him, "When I get time, I'll come in."
[40:39] But for the things of God, if I get
[40:41] time, I'll come.
[40:48] But the Bible says, "Seek you first the
[40:49] kingdom."
[40:52] Amen. So I'm saying God can never fully
[40:56] manifest or use us because we are
[40:58] preoccupied.
[41:01] Amen. We are already preoccupied with
[41:04] the things of the world.
[41:07] Amen.
[41:09] So I am saying use your situation to
[41:12] change. Amen. Use the word to change
[41:15] your situation even now. Right now, you
[41:18] can change your situation with
[41:19] everything that's going on in your mind
[41:20] right now with the word of God that's
[41:22] coming forth. What did this woman choose
[41:24] to do? She didn't say there, I'm going
[41:27] to cry here for my son. She didn't say,
[41:29] "I'm going to wait for the undertaker."
[41:30] She settled her house and she went to
[41:33] where the word was.
[41:35] Get out of your situation. Get to where
[41:38] the word is. I am telling you, the
[41:41] season has changed.
[41:47] When God starts to do something, I'm not
[41:49] just speaking something now that's a
[41:51] season has changed. A season I'm telling
[41:52] you, listen to what I'm saying. The
[41:54] season for this church has changed.
[41:58] We may have had dry spells.
[42:01] We may have had a time of trying to
[42:02] understand what the Lord is doing. But
[42:04] the Lord is telling you tonight, the
[42:06] season has changed. Whether you want to
[42:08] move along with it and come, God is
[42:10] saying, "I'm already doing a new thing."
[42:15] and God is going to start to use the
[42:16] young people.
[42:21] You're going to see young people raise
[42:22] up.
[42:24] You're going to see a multiplication of
[42:26] young people in this church.
[42:29] That God is using.
[42:32] Amen.
[42:33] Now I ask and I put a challenge to you
[42:37] that from the young people here, how
[42:39] many of us can say, "Lord, use me.
[42:43] Use me
[42:45] for your glory. Use me for your kingdom
[42:48] purpose.
[42:50] Use me for the extension of your
[42:51] kingdom.
[42:53] Use me, Lord, in any way that you see
[42:55] fit to do so."
[42:58] Do you know that your life, your breath
[42:59] belongs to God?
[43:03] So I'm speaking to every young person
[43:04] here.
[43:07] That which God has given you, give it
[43:09] back to him.
[43:12] Amen. That which God has given you, give
[43:16] it back to him.
[43:20] I say this again, I've seen a door open.
[43:26] Amen.
[43:28] In the last few weeks, we've been
[43:29] preaching on the prodigal.
[43:32] And I've seen doors open.
[43:36] Amen.
[43:38] I can give you testimonies
[43:41] that private prayers answered publicly.
[43:46] Private prayers,
[43:48] secret prayers
[43:52] where we speak a word and the angel of
[43:55] God goes forth and performs it.
[43:57] Thank you, Lord.
[44:00] Amen. Some of you don't know. You were
[44:02] pulled out of your circumstances. You
[44:04] were pulled out of your homes. You were
[44:06] pulled back into church because of a
[44:07] prayer.
[44:11] Amen.
[44:14] I can give you names. I can give you
[44:15] examples right now, but it's not
[44:17] necessary.
[44:21] Hallelujah. And you're going to see a
[44:23] multiplication of it. Amen. Because when
[44:27] a son recognizes who he is,
[44:32] that he controls atmospheres,
[44:36] he controls situations.
[44:39] And when we are speaking a word, all
[44:40] that the father has given me will come
[44:42] to me. We are calling those names. They
[44:45] don't even know what's happening. We are
[44:47] calling those names. When Jesus said,
[44:49] all that the father has given me will
[44:50] come to me. What you saying? They will
[44:52] come to me. Amen. They could have been
[44:55] trapped under concrete.
[44:57] They could have been held by chains.
[45:00] They will come to him.
[45:03] And he says, "And not one of them is
[45:04] lost." And he says, "All of them who
[45:06] come to me, I will in no wise cast out."
[45:10] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[45:13] So in this time and season of I give it
[45:15] to you,
[45:17] include your loved ones here.
[45:19] Hallelujah.
[45:23] Include your loved ones because in the
[45:26] power of I give it to you all things are
[45:29] possible.
[45:31] So I I'm urging you again. I'm going to
[45:33] say it in a very simply way. Don't
[45:34] remain in unbelief and also don't remain
[45:37] in ignorance and don't remain in
[45:40] arrogant spirit. Say Lord I empty myself
[45:43] out. We sang the song I give myself
[45:45] away. We've tried other things. It
[45:47] didn't work. Right? We've tried to be
[45:49] proud. It didn't work. We tried to do
[45:51] things our way. It didn't work. How
[45:52] about we say, "I come now and I do it
[45:54] God's way." Amen. I want to pray. Let's
[45:56] stand together and give God praise.
[46:01] Amen. So, in every season, the word of
[46:04] God is our constant.
[46:06] The woman, the Shounomite woman now went
[46:08] to the prophet and she changed a season
[46:10] of death
[46:13] and brought back life because she
[46:14] brought the word to where the problem
[46:16] was.
[46:18] You can bring the word to where your
[46:19] problem is.
[46:22] You say my husband is a problem, bring
[46:23] the word to where your husband is. You
[46:26] say my wife is a problem, bring your
[46:27] word, the word to where your wife is. My
[46:31] children are a problem, bring the word
[46:32] to where your children are. My father is
[46:35] a problem. Bring the word to where your
[46:37] father is.
[46:40] There's a problem at work. Bring the
[46:42] word to work.
[46:49] Hallelujah.
[46:50] The word is constant in every season. I
[46:54] am saying that the prophet says we all
[46:56] go through seasons
[46:58] but we have the word
[47:00] and the word can pull us out of our
[47:02] seasons. You know what Jesus said when
[47:04] he saw the fig tree? The Bible says that
[47:06] it wasn't season for figs yet.
[47:11] Amen. The tree, the fig tree represents
[47:14] Israel. Didn't Jesus say the fig tree?
[47:17] Learn a parable from the fig tree.
[47:20] The fig tree was Israel. But Israel
[47:23] couldn't recognize that the season had
[47:24] changed of killing goats and and
[47:28] animals.
[47:29] The lamb of God was standing to himself.
[47:32] So as a type, he goes to the fig tree
[47:34] and he curses that fig tree for not
[47:36] recognizing the season had changed.
[47:44] I'm saying don't be a fig tree now
[47:46] that's going to be cursed.
[47:49] The season has changed.
[47:52] Amen. I tell you we are in 2025 right
[47:55] now. God wants to birth a new thing in
[47:58] your life. We read go and read Isaiah 43
[48:01] there again verse 18 from verse 18 I'm
[48:04] doing a new thing
[48:06] you know we sing that song oh north
[48:10] give them up oh south you can't hold
[48:14] them back this people I formed for
[48:16] myself
[48:18] every dry bone is coming back into
[48:20] position
[48:23] amen
[48:26] prophesy over your situation
[48:29] Maybe you never thought about it this
[48:30] way. When John is asked to take the
[48:32] book, eat the book. Amen. He's changing
[48:35] his season.
[48:38] Then he's asked to prophesy again.
[48:42] I say start by prophesying over your own
[48:44] life.
[48:46] Amen. Start by saying, "Lord,
[48:49] whatever your problem is right now,
[48:51] start by saying, Lord, I declare it's
[48:53] the end of one season
[48:56] and it's the start of a new thing in my
[48:58] life.
[49:00] Lord, I end the drought of
[49:03] a dry prayer life.
[49:06] You know, you can change that
[49:07] physically.
[49:10] I don't pray." Well, pray.
[49:13] I don't read the Bible. Well, read the
[49:15] Bible. Amen. Amen. I don't listen to the
[49:17] messages. Well, read the messages.
[49:19] Change your season. Amen. Change your
[49:22] circumstance. Lord, I'm so shy to tell
[49:25] my friend about Jesus. Well, change your
[49:27] situation and tell them about Jesus.
[49:29] Your mouth may get dry. You may not have
[49:31] the words to say, but start to speak
[49:33] about the goodness of Jesus. Start to at
[49:35] least tell them, you know what? Once I
[49:37] was like this, I was caught up in things
[49:39] like this, but Jesus changed my life.
[49:43] The prophet says, we don't know. It
[49:44] says, "Start with your testimony."
[49:48] I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[49:50] Christ.
[49:52] Amen. And I say we start to impact and
[49:54] influence and change.
[49:57] Amen. Situations, areas. Amen. We start
[50:01] to witness for the kingdom of God.
[50:04] Hallelujah. Every head bowed, every eyes
[50:06] closed. Amen. This is a time of prayer.
[50:08] Now, we're going to go into Amen.
[50:10] Hallelujah. I want you to start to pray
[50:12] in the spirit. Don't pray in the flesh
[50:14] now, but pray in the spirit and start to
[50:17] speak to the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[50:19] he says if you don't know what to pray,
[50:21] he says the Holy Ghost will make
[50:22] intercession on your behalf and start to
[50:24] speak. Amen. If you don't know what to
[50:26] pray, start to pray for the Holy Ghost.
[50:28] Start to pray for a changing, a renewal
[50:30] of season,
