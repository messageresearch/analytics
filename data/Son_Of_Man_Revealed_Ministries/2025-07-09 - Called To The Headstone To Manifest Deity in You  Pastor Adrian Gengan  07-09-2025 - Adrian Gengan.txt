And Lord, there's nothing we can do to inherit salvation. Nothing we can do of ourselves, oh God. We are relying totally on what you have done for us. Oh God, we relying on the work that you have done on the cross. Oh God, and therefore we identified with the work which you have done and we are sanctified. We are justified. We are perfected in Christ. Oh God, the one that paid the price for our sin, oh God, the one who shed his blood for us. How we love you, how we appreciate you.

We we are longing for the redemption of our bodies, oh God. Oh, when we shall be changed into your very own image and likeness, that we adore you and love you this morning. We pray, Lord, that you'll come and speak to us through your precious word. And I pray, Lord, that you'll anoint the preaching. You'll anoint the hearers of the word, oh God. Amen. I pray Lord the Holy Ghost will come now and tabernacle me, tabernacle your people, oh God.

And father Lord we will know without a shadow of a doubt that you are here in our presence oh God. We invite you sweet Holy Spirit Lord to have the preeminence right now. We give you glory and honor and we bind every work of the enemy. We bind every demon power. We bind and we Amen. We command every demon power to take its flight.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I greet you all in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. It's exciting to come into the house of the Lord. Amen. Knowing that this word that we are feasting on is going to change these bodies one of these days. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're getting rapturing faith by the word that we are feeding on. Amen. And praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I greet you all once again in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Everybody good? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. John chapter 6 and verse 37. All that the father giveth me shall come to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All that the father giveth me shall come to me. and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we all read that together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John 6:37. All that the father giveth me shall come to me. And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. The Lord had blessings through the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory be to his holy name. Amen. So I think I need to explain. Amen. Praise the Lord. So this morning we want to speak a little thought. Amen. So remember, brother Joshua's ministering at Tabernacle this morning. Amen. That's why they're not here. Pray that the Lord will bless them this morning. So he's the Jesus our Lord is saying all that the father giveth me shall come to me. &gt;&gt; So it's important where Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Jesus is not in the leninian church age. &gt;&gt; So all that the father is going to give him is going to come to him and he is the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So everyone that's coming now in the bride age &gt;&gt; must come to him where? &gt;&gt; In the headstone. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all that cometh to me, I won't cast you out of the headstone if you are designed to be a part of the headstone. &gt;&gt; So this morning we speaking on call to the headstone to manifest deity in you. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We haven't been called to the message of the hour for a picnic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We haven't been called to be a part of a church movement. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we have been called to manifest deity on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. All creation is waiting. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now remember all creation is not doesn't say that all creation is waiting for God. &gt;&gt; It says all creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Because the only God creation will see is God in you and me. &gt;&gt; Even though they are crying out for God, the final mystery purpose of God is to reveal himself through his people. So if people want to see God, they can't call him down out of heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's already here on the earth manifesting himself through you and I. &gt;&gt; Now this morning we're going to find there's unbelief in you. &gt;&gt; Because what we are preaching this morning is going to expose whether there's unbelief in you and whether you really believe the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When we say God sent a prophet, everyone believes it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. The opening of the seals, the opening of the word. But let's open it and see what the word says about you. &gt;&gt; And then when you can't if you can't believe and stomach what is being said, &gt;&gt; then that's unbelief. &gt;&gt; And we're going to see if there's unbelief in you sitting in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we are called to the headstone to manifest deity in you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember our scripture. All the father giveth me will come to me. &gt;&gt; Yes. There's a certain class of people called out of the later age to the bride age to be a part of the headstone &gt;&gt; to welcome back Christ. Now it's a very serious thing because I'm going to show you this quote now and we're going to find here brother Leo. Brother Leo was one of the 10 boys. &gt;&gt; He was involved in recording of sermons. So you'll say he had a great work to do. Right? &gt;&gt; Let's read the quote and then you'll get the context. He's this is in the message 70th week of Daniel. I remember not long ago brother Leo a vision that he had a dream he called it one night when we first met that he saw a great pyramid peak. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he seeing? &gt;&gt; He's seeing a great pyramid peak &gt;&gt; way up where &gt;&gt; in heavenly places. So, he's seeing a pyramid peak. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's seeing a pyramid peak way up in the air. We are called up to heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And I was up there preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somewhere. And he climbed up to see what it was all about. And when he got up there on top of this peak, why he said way off in kind of silver looking light or like a platter? I was standing preaching to the people and he attracted my attention and I looked around to him and he said, "How did you ever get out there? How could I get out there?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is up in the pyramid. &gt;&gt; He's up in the headstone preaching. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, if he's preaching, he's preaching to a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a people that he's preaching to way up in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But here's the part we want to get to. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I said, Leo, no one can come out here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has to take a man here. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Oh, hallelujah. I'm not called to be a part of the leaders here at church age. &gt;&gt; I'm called to be part of the headstone. &gt;&gt; God has to take a man here. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; God has to hone a man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has to shape a man. &gt;&gt; To be up here now. You're not to come up here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Leo, you are not called to be part of the bride age. &gt;&gt; Come on, let's read with understanding. &gt;&gt; There are people that's going to be sealed under the ladian church age &gt;&gt; and they'll be saved under that dispensation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There are people called to being saved under Luther's dispensation, under Wesley's dispensation. But Leo was not called to be part of the bride age. &gt;&gt; Now, you're not to come up here. You have to go down and witness to those people down there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You go and do work. Record the tapes. &gt;&gt; Do your part. &gt;&gt; But you are not called to be up here. &gt;&gt; This big pyramid in the air in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; You are not called to be up there. &gt;&gt; You are to go down and witness to these people down there. After you have seen it, that it's the truth. That it's the truth. Leo climbs back down to witness to the people. &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's a special class of people that are called up to the headstone ministry. &gt;&gt; We are the connecting stone between Christ and the rest of the church. &gt;&gt; Christ has got to fit a people and he can't come down and descend upon the Ladyian church age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's a group of people being owned up coming to a needle point where the headstone can fit. &gt;&gt; And when we are coming up into his image and likeness, brother Brandham says as we near him, as she nears the headstone, she will be so much in his image. &gt;&gt; She will be the super church, she will be the super race. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, how do we become part of this body? And how does how uh brother Brandon change our position? Praise the Lord. Is and here in the first seal, he's going to show us how he's going to change our position. &gt;&gt; So what makes us manifest deity? What makes us manifest and call ourselves, Amen, the bride of Jesus Christ? What makes ourselves son of man revealed again? &gt;&gt; He says, "And and and only is to be revealed." is talking about the seal now to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken. Broken to who? The seal is not broken to Christ. &gt;&gt; He says, but to the church. &gt;&gt; Now, when he uses the word church, you you need to get into the spirit of what he's preaching. &gt;&gt; Then the Holy Spirit is now wrestling within him and then he's going to change the word church. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be broken to the church world. So watch how the Holy Spirit watch he says broken not to Christ but to the church. Then he starts to speak now. Notice now oh my that just makes me tremble. You can see how the Holy Spirit working there. &gt;&gt; I I hope the church truly understands it what I mean. You people I'm going to call you bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what makes us the bride? &gt;&gt; The opening of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The difference between the church and the bride is that the bride has the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they have rejected the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is the secret of this. The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is where? &gt;&gt; In the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; How was it in Mary? How did it get into Mary? The angel overshadowed her. Yes. &gt;&gt; So in this time and season, that's why it's important to connect with the angel of the Lord because the angel of the Lord is here again to overshadow a people and put a word in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't do without leadership in this time and season. And our leader and our guide is the angel of God, the great Holy Spirit. Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I am the word. If you want deity in your midst, then welcome and receive the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know this Bible can be a closed book to you. &gt;&gt; Without the prophet Messenger. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revealing the mystery of God, without the angel of God here on the earth. Amen. And then what have we got? We've got books. When their eyes were open, &gt;&gt; they knew it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the scripture becomes alive to us. &gt;&gt; We recognize our day and its message. We recognize our part of the word. So he says, "I am the word." If you want deity in your midst, welcome and receive the word. &gt;&gt; No, pay attention what he's saying. If you want who in your midstity, &gt;&gt; that's God. &gt;&gt; If you want him in your midst, welcome the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. The denominational world is saying, "We want you in our midst. Welcome. Welcome. &gt;&gt; Welcome, Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're singing all of these songs to welcome the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; but the word is not in their midst. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you must be highly deceived if you trying to convince me that the word is in their midst. &gt;&gt; The prophet of the age indicted that generation Amen. &gt;&gt; For crucifying the word again. &gt;&gt; So don't none of you tell me that they have part of the word. &gt;&gt; They have rejected the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What they have is an impersonation of Christianity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They are jealous and generous. &gt;&gt; But we are Moses. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are Moses. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here. O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord. &gt;&gt; Receive the word. Don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hey, don't let a woman get between you and the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't let a boy get between you and the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Don't let your husband, don't let your wife, don't let nothing get between you and that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? We want deity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But now we come up to the head, the capstone. And this capstone has a voice and it's shouting something. This headstone. Oh, I tell you, I need grace in my life every day. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, &gt;&gt; oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I can't even walk. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Without you holding my hand. &gt;&gt; Mountains too high &gt;&gt; and the valley is too wide. &gt;&gt; Headstone is coming with shoutings. grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we are so perfect. &gt;&gt; No, all of us needs the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Therefore, when he's coming to descend on this capstone, this needle point, this flange. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's still doubt and unbelief sometimes. &gt;&gt; Think Genesis 18. The Lord himself coming with two angels. &gt;&gt; He's coming to find Sarah. You think Sarah is full of faith? &gt;&gt; It's time and season. &gt;&gt; Come on. It was time and season for Sarah to reproduce. &gt;&gt; But she was still found in doubt. &gt;&gt; She was still laughing. &gt;&gt; But the headstone came shouting, "Grace, grace to Sarah." &gt;&gt; Why did you laugh, Sarah? &gt;&gt; I didn't laugh. in the in the face of lying to God. The headstone was crying grace grace. That's why he didn't smite her. That's why he didn't kill her. Amen. In the presence of God, but grace was abounding. Amen. Oh, can somebody give God praise in spite of your failures? In spite of all your lies and all your unbelief, the headstone is coming crying, "Grace, grace to cover all your sin in this time and season to cover all your unbelief." Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or not, the headstone is here to bring you to manifest the word for your time and season. Sarah had no Amen. No option but to believe the angel's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Headstone coming crying grace, grace, grace to you. &gt;&gt; You say I'm full of faults. I'm full of failures. Here the headstone crying grace. Here the headstone crying grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why is he crying double grace because some of us are so bad. &gt;&gt; Not only do we need another another double portion, brother Caleb, we need double grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Seven church ages that may have needed grace. &gt;&gt; But up here in the headstone, the most evil age &gt;&gt; where it's an impossible age to live in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where brother Brandham says, I predict a time where people will be gone totally mad. &gt;&gt; He says they'll be insane. &gt;&gt; I I don't know if you're looking around and you're seeing sane people. &gt;&gt; The world has gone completely insane. &gt;&gt; So it takes the grace of God to keep us sane in an insane world. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. The headstone crying what? Grace. Grace passed from death and creed into living word. That's the shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The living bread of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pass from death and creed into a living word of the living God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What's God's provided plan for his age? How many of you want to know what God's provided plans for his age? &gt;&gt; For this age. Here's the provided plan for this age. His sons in the word age quickened by the spirit. That's dynamics coming on mechanics. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not a dead word. &gt;&gt; I'm a living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's time we stop saying, "God sent a message. God sent a prophet. Show me the message. Show me the message. The message must be alive. I must be a living manifestation of the message." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The message must come out of books. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like how Jesus stepped out of the pages of the Bible. They always spoke about a redeemer. Unto us a son is born. Unto us a child is given. Amen. Hallelujah. He shall be born of a virgin. But one day Jesus stepped out of the pages of the book. Amen. And all that is prophesied in the Bible of regarding you and me. We have now stepped out of the pages of the Bible. We have taken the book. Amen. And we have eaten the book. We have now become the word manifest on the earth. And not only have we become the word manifest on the earth, we are now prophesying again. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Make it alive. Seated now. Where? Where you seated? &gt;&gt; He said, remember what Leo said? I saw a pyramid in the air &gt;&gt; in heavenly places. How can we get up into heavenly places? You must be called there. &gt;&gt; Yes. So how privileged are we church if we are called to a place and a position as this? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You think we are just hearing an ordinary word this morning. &gt;&gt; I challenge you. Go to message channels. Go to message churches and see what they are preaching. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You'll be able to find those that are stuck in the Leadian church age &gt;&gt; and you'll be able to find those that are called up to the headstone. &gt;&gt; How? By the word that they are preaching. By the way they break the bread, &gt;&gt; you'll be able to identify those that are called up to the bride age. And it's no fault on their part. &gt;&gt; It's just Leo, go back down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not called to meet the conditions that are required up here in the headstone age. &gt;&gt; Your wings won't be able to carry you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But blessed are you have been called up to the headstone age. You have wings. Amen. Hallelujah. You know how to spread your wings and fly and soar up in the heavenlies. Amen. To meet the headstone, to meet the bridegroom. Oh, somebody give God praise. Amen. If you know you've been called up to the headstone. &gt;&gt; Seated now in heavenly places in present tense. &gt;&gt; Ah, I'm seated now in heavenly places in present tense. Yeah. In 2025. Amen. September 2025. I'm seated now in heavenly places in present tense. Already alive. and subject to every promise in the word. Then what does that do? You become a part of God's gene. &gt;&gt; A part of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A part of &gt;&gt; Brother Shan was singing that song last week. Who I am, Lord. &gt;&gt; A part of his plan. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation &gt;&gt; of who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep singing brother Sha. &gt;&gt; Even if you sing every week. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to start to understand how rewards are multiplied in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; If you take what God has given you, the gift he's given you, and multiply, do you know how promotion comes? &gt;&gt; Promotion comes from the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? And he's teaching us in Matthew 25, when the master comes, how does he give you promotion? How does he increase you? He sees what you have done with the promise, what you have been done with what you've been gifted. &gt;&gt; And some are investing it week after week. Some are investing it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Some are exercising it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Week after week. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But others given duties, given assignments, given a call, given a a position, just lay down and do least with it. &gt;&gt; Then there can be according to the biblical principle, there can be no promotion. There can be no reward. &gt;&gt; In fact, according to the biblical principle, the one who does nothing with the gift, it's taken away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go read Matthew 25. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, whatever God has given you, whatever he's imparted with you, use it wisely for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you've been entrusted with a position, do all you can and maximize it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, watch now. You being a part of God's gene, a part of the word, other men a part of God's gene seated together. &gt;&gt; Amen. manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you. See what I'm talking about, brother Brown? If there's any browns here, &gt;&gt; lots of browns I see here. &gt;&gt; No leaven among you. Just the word only. &gt;&gt; Hey, see these people that are up here in the headstone, there's no leaven amongst them. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but my hands are feeling very cold here. &gt;&gt; Is the egg one too cold for you? You okay there? I think this thing is hitting me directly here. But it's fine if the people are comfortable. It's okay. I will long suffer. No 11 among you. Just the word only. &gt;&gt; Seated in heavenly places in the door. &gt;&gt; John 10:7. &gt;&gt; I am the door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seated in heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. No leaven among you. That brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; The last time I read that, &gt;&gt; the fullness of the godhead dwell bodily in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now he's saying it brings the entire fullness of the body. But Jesus is in heaven. &gt;&gt; But he needs another body. The fullness of the Godhead needs another body. &gt;&gt; Yes. So apart in you, a party in you. He said all together bring the full of the worldly among you. &gt;&gt; Couldn't do it in L's age. Couldn't do it in Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age. But in the day when the sun is manifested on earth in the form of your prophet God all glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures where you worship at the house of God seated in present tense to accepting deity and expressing back the same kind of gift like they did that you identified by your gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're identified by your gift. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are identified by your gift &gt;&gt; that you give your entire being to it. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you &gt;&gt; to identify deity. &gt;&gt; Then you identify yourself with the deity. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to identify yourself with the deity? &gt;&gt; We're going to find out now and root out unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Man will be manifested, revealed, brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs, manifesting himself like he did in the beginning when he was by giving all you are and what you are to deity himself. Now Christ in this day that we live is still he's identifying himself deity amongst the people. He's still deity because he is the word. Remember we said how are we getting it? The word &gt;&gt; through the word through receiving this word. Deity is within us. &gt;&gt; And can identify itself in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then give your hold to it. Show that you believe it. Give it deity. Believe it. Service and be ready to die out to yourself and your own thoughts. But today it's rejected as it was then. Sure. &gt;&gt; You see, watch how when we when the service is going on now and we're starting to identify where deity should be, &gt;&gt; you watch the service to get more quieter and quieter &gt;&gt; because why? Give yourself to it. &gt;&gt; No, but how I'm going to watch this movie now? &gt;&gt; You're going to take Jesus to the bicycle. &gt;&gt; You're going to take the Holy Ghost to bicycle. What's the word? Cinema. &gt;&gt; Bio. &gt;&gt; You can't take the Holy Ghost and watch Netflix. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can't take the Holy Ghost and watch Showmax. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How you going to duck and dive with the Holy Ghost in your deity in you and go see that girl you wasn't supposed to see? No, believe me, then deity is not in you. You're moving ASA out. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're moving alone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're moving alone. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; Come on. Do we really want the present tense word? &gt;&gt; The present tense word is a deity must be found in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then give yourself to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give hold to it. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you're trusting the Lord for something, &gt;&gt; give yourself to the word. &gt;&gt; You're trusting the Lord for a wife, you're trusting the Lord for a husband, you're trusting the Lord for a job, you're trusting the Lord for anything in your life, give yourself to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I encourage you this morning, give yourself to the word. &gt;&gt; Show that you're believing it. Give it deity. Believe it. Service it. &gt;&gt; Be ready and die out to yourself and your own thoughts. But today it's rejected as it was then. &gt;&gt; Are you say it's limited? This is unlimited. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If if I abide in you and my word abide in if if your if you abide in me and my word abide in you, ask what you will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Jesus said, "But my father that dwelleth in me, he showeth me all things that himself doeth." Amen. There you are. What is it? Deity being identified in man. &gt;&gt; Now, the same thing is today. That deity, the promised word for this day, the very Christ that's in you is the only thing that can raise you up. That's deity God in you. &gt;&gt; If the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus, &gt;&gt; amen, that rose Jesus from the dead dwells in you, it will also quicken your mortal body. So there will be no resurrection of the sleeping saints if they didn't the deity is not dwelling in there. &gt;&gt; What? You're a Christian when you're filled. But there's no other way. There's no creed denominations you can join. Praise you can say they're all in vain. You've got to be born of the spirit of God or you're lost. Except a man be born again, he will in no way see God. That's right. You must be born again. And to be born again, you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost, the energy of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to open your life and throw yourself out and let deity God tabernacle himself in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the Holy Ghost is deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying the Holy Ghost is deity. &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in man. &gt;&gt; It's more than a sensation. &gt;&gt; So people want to have it on the flesh. It's more than in your flesh. It's more than speaking in tongues, more than gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's more than shouting in the spirit. &gt;&gt; So, it goes past the realm of the spirit, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You go to some churches. Amen. Even in the message, a lot of Pentecost going on. A lot of emotions in the flesh. A lot of Amen. walk up and and all kinds of things. Even sp amen shouting in the spirit and all of these things. It's more than just weeping. It's more than just joining church. It's God living. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Deity God himself tabernacle into that person when he can speak and it's just the same as God speaking. &gt;&gt; Oh, did somebody read that? &gt;&gt; When you speak, it's the same as God speaking. &gt;&gt; Not some mental work up now, but God dwelling in your heart that when you speak, God is speaking through your lips. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same God that said, "Let there be and there was" is the same God speaking through you. So when you speak to your situation, when you speak to your problem, Amen. It's God using your lips to speak to that situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the church of Jesus Christ. That's the way that first apostolic church went forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity. &gt;&gt; To receive the Holy Ghost, that's you tabernacling deity. &gt;&gt; Your words is &gt;&gt; his words. &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Notice quietness. &gt;&gt; Because the words we speaking is not his words. &gt;&gt; The words we speaking, Amen, is our own words. &gt;&gt; We need to be temperate. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We need to let go of all colorful language. &gt;&gt; We need to let go of all vernacular. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people speaking third party language, &gt;&gt; third party language. You know, you're lucky I'm not the old man I was either way. I would have finished you. What are you trying to say? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, which means that you know when somebody die, you can't resurrect him. Hey, &gt;&gt; you can't resurrect him. He must be dead. The old man must be dead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He is the word. So when he's spirit born, spirits fil man in faith takes that word into his heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If you believe in your heart, confess with your mouth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's going to use Romans 10 here. Now, &gt;&gt; if you believe in your heart, he's going to use Mark 11:23. You believe in your heart, place it upon your lips. Why? That is the same as deity speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say it doesn't work. Let there be a squirrel there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Squirrel appeared. &gt;&gt; You know why it's not happening? What was last week's message? We're not applying. &gt;&gt; We're not practicing. To apply means to practice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going through a situation. You're thinking it's in the flesh. You're thinking it's just there. God is presenting you with situations daily for you to speak over that situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God wants you to practice to apply the word. &gt;&gt; Lord, this situation is not ordinary. &gt;&gt; This is a very unusual situation. Lord, &gt;&gt; I can recognize you in this, but I'm going to now express the God in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm now going to apply the word by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You put your seal on me to show that I'm your product. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was made in your image. Last week we told you about the manufacturer putting a warranty on his product. &gt;&gt; Do you know they give you 6 months to a year, maybe a very good product, they'll give you two years. warranty on appliances and things beds that might give you 10 year but only on the structure. Praise the Lord. But you know when he put his seal on you &gt;&gt; it's an eternal warranty, &gt;&gt; an eternal guarantee, &gt;&gt; you pass from dead unto life. &gt;&gt; Meaning if you are dysfunctional, he's not going to reject you when he sees you. Your warranty is always active. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't throw the clay away. Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When we are defective, he doesn't throw the clay away. He takes you back into his workshop and he reworks you and he molds you and he shapes you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, where's the spirit born spiritual man and daughter of God this morning? Let me see your hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me see your hands. &gt;&gt; So, he says when a spirit born fil man in faith takes that word into his heart, places it upon his lips. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? That is the same as D speaking.

You know that sister is struggling with things. &gt;&gt; Did you ever make an appointment on a time to say, "Brother, we're going to pray right now. We're going to believe the word of God together." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who said you must leave everything for the ministry? Who says you must leave everything, Amen, for the pastor? Who says you can't ignite that faith within you to say, you know what, I'm praying for that brother. I'm praying for that sister. Amen.

How about we start to believe? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That the Lord is more than able to provide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, when I read there, all things are possible. Mark 9:23.

Doors indoors. &gt;&gt; I like a man of vision. &gt;&gt; Somebody who's not just laying by. God was a God of vision. &gt;&gt; He envisioned the world. &gt;&gt; He envisioned animals. He envisioned fish. He envisioned plant life, animal life. He envisioned the stars, the moon.

I want you to read the one word that I read wrong. Right now is when God is Jehovah Gyra to provide. &gt;&gt; No, ask brother Tyson. What? Anything. You mean you can ask anything? &gt;&gt; Now is when God is Jehovah &gt;&gt; Gyra. &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you that you gave me to live week to week. &gt;&gt; Do you know what he is the high priest of? &gt;&gt; Confession. &gt;&gt; He's the high priest of your &gt;&gt; confession. &gt;&gt; Confession. John Ryan confessed something that he wasn't experiencing. &gt;&gt; He was saying, "Thank you, Lord. I'm healed. Praise God. I'm healed." &gt;&gt; So, when the high priest was taking this John Ryan's confession, he's the high priest of our confession. He's looking at John Ryan's confession, but physically John is blind. So when the high priest got the confession, he's got the confession that John is healed, but he's looking back and he's saying, "Let's align John's eye to his confession." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; John Ryan was repeating it for about 6 months. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You repeated for a day and you got tired. So as long as you say Lord I thank you that I'm able to live week to week. The high priest is taking your confession. He has a thankful heart. He has week to week. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But imagine if now you are living week to week. And you say Lord I thank you that I have a six month supply. &gt;&gt; I thank you I have a six month supply. &gt;&gt; I thank you I have a six month supply. &gt;&gt; What is the high priest going to do? &gt;&gt; John's confession. He's got a 6 month supply, but he's got a week's supply there. Let's make his supply match his confession. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you how the confession high priest handles your confession. &gt;&gt; If you can do it for healing, he can do it for anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is your gyro. &gt;&gt; Gyra means provider. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Ask and you shall. receive Jehovah Gyra to provide anything that we've got need of for we are Abraham's seed under the covenant through the death and burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I know some of you don't like debt. So that's good. Then he still Jehovah Gyra to provide for your financial needs according to your confession. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the days you're going to call me and tell me, "Please dedicate my house that I bought cash." &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Please come. They're going to see somebody a fancy car. You're going to ask to the Sam, you got a visitor today, &gt;&gt; but the Sam will say, "I don't know whose car that is." Then you're going to see one of your brothers and sisters jumping out that car. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not for everyone. Remember what I'm speaking on. &gt;&gt; This is the one who believes and confess. &gt;&gt; Then the high priest knows how to handle your confession. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. You You're telling me you got into sin and he got you out of sin? &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; you got into sin and he got you out of sin. &gt;&gt; You got into trouble, he got you out of trouble. You mean he got into debt, he can't get you out of debt? &gt;&gt; Where's your faith? Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How about you go and apply a scripture? He whom the son of man has set free is free indeed. So want to be debt free. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; So you can put there, he who the son of man has set debt free is debtree indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not for everyone. If you're not called to be up here and receive this word right now, go back down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if you can receive the confession right now, &gt;&gt; change your confession. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Change your confession. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Leave negativity. &gt;&gt; Let's move on. What's the time now? &gt;&gt; Amen. 11:23. Ask what you want. Watch when the spirit ask, what is the time now? &gt;&gt; Come on. 11:23 is &gt;&gt; if you say to this mountain, be thou removed and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, wonder. &gt;&gt; Remember the last time I said that, brother Joshua asked &gt;&gt; and he spoke something instantly &gt;&gt; when they went out. They got a buy for those dogs. You remember the testimony? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember when the angel of God is here? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's move on. Amen. Just a few more and then we finish. The deity of him. Who is he? Some of them makes him a little baby back there. He is the one that stood on the invisible platform, raised his hands and spoke, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to show you this is you now. &gt;&gt; This very God is living in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there was light. That was Jesus Christ. For he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not. He is the deity of God. Look what it You're not seeing it. Sorry. Number seven, you're not seeing it. Praise the Lord. Look what he did back there. Talk about the miraculous back there. You talk about shouting when he performed the miraculous things to make things which are now out of things which was not. He spoke and it was so. And that same power, that same Christ, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; let the fundamentalist, let them who deny the power of God say say it's wrong. But that same power that spoke the word into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The same power that said, "Let there be &gt;&gt; light." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, some of you sleeping. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Some of you are daydreaming. Tap your neighbor. Say, "Come back to earth." &gt;&gt; Or tell them, "Come back to their headstone." &gt;&gt; Come back, Leo. Oh, sorry. I forgot if you're not called to be up here, you have to go back down. &gt;&gt; So those of you that have gone to sleep, stay there. Those that are in heavenly places right now, listen to what he's saying. &gt;&gt; The same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Please don't make my prophet a liar. &gt;&gt; It's in those people that's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The same creative power that said, "Let there be &gt;&gt; is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost." That's right, men and women. It's time we found out who you are. &gt;&gt; Satan has been holding your withholding your identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Anybody come to you, they want to see your South African uh Amen. ID document or a passport. Amen. Tell them I'm not of this world. Amen. I'm of a different kind. I'm not of this world. Amen.

The angel of God is breaking concrete this morning to expose you and show you who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell you that you're some little cow down thing, something. You're not. You're sons and daughters of God. The deity is not in heaven. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe. Amen. We're going to shout and scream right now. The deity is not in heaven. It's in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody say, I am deity. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; I am deity. I am tabernacling the most high God. &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In fact, if you wanted to go to the seven dimension now and find deity in heaven, you won't find it there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what that seven seal was all about. That's why all of heaven went silent. &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you getting the revelation of it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 10 will reveal where he is currently. Revelation 10 brought him back to the earth. Not Jesus in the physical flesh because Jesus can't come back to the earth. &gt;&gt; The body must be retained in the heavens until the restitution of all things. But the spirit that lived in Jesus came back to the earth. Amen. And he's living in you and I. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can take a trip right now. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can even send you to the seven dimension. You see, deity is not in heaven. Deity is on the earth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, I challenge you to go to heaven right now and ask them, "Where is deity?" &gt;&gt; They'll say, "You mean you came from the earth? &gt;&gt; You came from a church service and you didn't see deity in your brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Deity is supposed to be tabernacle in you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. It's in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know you think I'm crazy like some of you are thinking right now. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you are thinking I'm crazy. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; But deity is in you. &gt;&gt; Remember what we are doing. Taking out all unbelief. &gt;&gt; We saying we believe the message but we believe deity is in us. &gt;&gt; If you say no then unbelief is there &gt;&gt; and that is something Satan can work through unbelief. &gt;&gt; But the message of the hour is coming to take out all unbelief. So there is nothing within you that Satan can work through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I know you think I'm crazy, but let me tell you something, brother. When you realize that almighty God lives within you, immortal life, my life I give Zoe. &gt;&gt; The life of God is in the human being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
