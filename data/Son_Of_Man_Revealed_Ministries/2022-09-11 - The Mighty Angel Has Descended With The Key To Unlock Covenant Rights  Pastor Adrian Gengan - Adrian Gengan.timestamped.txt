[2:37] Jesus Christ amen the one who is worthy
[2:40] of Praise Not Just Praise but the
[2:42] highest praise amen amen hallelujah amen
[2:47] so amen this morning we'd like to uh
[2:50] speak on the mighty angel
[2:53] as descended
[2:55] with the key to unlock Covenant rights
[2:59] amen
[3:01] the mighty Angel has descended with the
[3:04] key to unlock Covenant rights
[3:08] amen hallelujah amen return to Genesis 2
[3:12] and verse 15 of scripture
[3:18] here we're looking at the first Covenant
[3:20] God had made with man
[3:22] and it says that the Lord God took man
[3:26] and put him in the Garden of Eden to
[3:28] dress it and to keep it and the Lord God
[3:30] commanded the man saying of every tree
[3:33] of the god and thou mayest freely eat
[3:36] but of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[3:38] Evil
[3:40] thou shall not eat of it for in the day
[3:42] thou eat us thereof Thou shalt surely
[3:46] die
[3:48] amen so that's the first Covenant God
[3:51] had made with man
[3:53] notice it's a different type of Covenant
[3:56] it's not an I will Covenant
[3:58] it's based on what
[4:00] Adam
[4:02] was going to do whether he was going to
[4:04] be faithful and obedient to the word
[4:06] let's turn to Genesis 12 and 1.
[4:13] Genesis 12 and 1 says now the Lord had
[4:16] said unto Abram
[4:18] amen
[4:20] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[4:23] Kindred and from thy father's house
[4:26] you got to separate from all unbelief
[4:29] right and then he says unto a land I
[4:32] will show thee so he's going to show him
[4:34] the land
[4:36] and I will make of thee a great nation
[4:40] amen I Will Bless thee and make thy name
[4:43] great and thou shalt be a blessing
[4:47] amen we can learn something from there
[4:49] we are blessed to be a blessing amen we
[4:53] shouldn't live selfish lives but we are
[4:56] blessed to be a blessing amen amen and I
[5:00] will bless them that bless me so your
[5:03] blessing is coming back to you as well
[5:04] amen
[5:07] and cursed him that cursed me and indeed
[5:11] shall all families of the earth be
[5:14] blessed amen amen
[5:16] amen
[5:18] hallelujah amen may God have blessings
[5:20] to the reading of his word you may be
[5:22] seated
[5:24] amen just want to say this morning in
[5:26] return thanks to the Lord amen that
[5:30] oh
[5:31] we have a beautiful baby girl
[5:34] she's the cutest most beautiful thing
[5:36] you've ever seen
[5:37] amen and we thank the Lord for the safe
[5:40] delivery it's happened according to how
[5:42] we had decided to happen amen though the
[5:45] doctors were putting pressure and you
[5:47] know trying to get the surgical
[5:48] procedures done but amen we persevered
[5:51] and we prevailed
[5:52] amen and we thank God for that amen so
[5:56] baby is doing well and Karen's
[5:58] recovering amen
[5:59] so we pray that the Lord will continue
[6:01] to be with him and bless them we'd like
[6:02] to thank everyone that's been praying
[6:04] amen hallelujah everybody feeling good
[6:07] in the house of the Lord
[6:09] amen so the mighty angel
[6:12] has descended with the key to unlock
[6:15] Covenant rights
[6:18] amen amen
[6:20] now God always has a covenant people
[6:24] and we sitting here this morning I
[6:27] Covenant people amen we are not without
[6:29] a covenant
[6:30] amen we have a love Covenant we have a
[6:33] Grace Covenant amen now a covenant is an
[6:36] agreement you remember a few weeks ago
[6:38] we spoke on the love Covenant between Mr
[6:41] and Mrs Jesus Christ amen so we're
[6:43] speaking on this morning the mighty
[6:45] Angel has descended to unlock with the
[6:48] key to unlock Covenant rights so God has
[6:50] a covenant people and a covenant is an
[6:53] agreement a contract treaty promise or a
[6:57] pledge
[6:58] now God's first Covenant was based on a
[7:00] conditional Covenant he could eat of
[7:02] every tree in the garden except one and
[7:06] one tree was forbidden to eat from and
[7:09] that was the tree of knowledge of Good
[7:11] and Evil
[7:13] amen and now in order for the Covenant
[7:15] to work manner to play his part in
[7:17] keeping keeping his end of the deal if
[7:21] we disobeyed God and head of the tree it
[7:23] will unlock something that Adam had
[7:25] never experienced before
[7:27] [Music]
[7:28] and that was them
[7:31] amen the fall brought death to the human
[7:34] race
[7:35] and through the entire Earth into chaos
[7:38] when man fell the Earth fell
[7:42] creation fell
[7:44] now there was only eternal life before
[7:47] the fall
[7:49] everything was made to live forever
[7:52] amen the Trees Animals fish of the sea
[7:55] never had to die death was unheard of in
[7:58] the Garden of Eden Adam lived in a world
[8:01] of perfect faith
[8:03] amen therefore he could speak to the
[8:05] winds and the winds would obey him he
[8:08] controlled animal life he had two
[8:10] million of a botany life and over the
[8:12] cattle and over every piece of the field
[8:14] amen
[8:16] amen how do we know he lived in a world
[8:19] of perfect Faith because that's how the
[8:21] second Adam lived
[8:22] and we watched when the second Adam came
[8:24] in on the scene he controlled all the
[8:27] elements amen
[8:30] amen
[8:32] so when God told Adam you shall surely
[8:35] die Not only would it be a physical
[8:37] death
[8:39] but man will lose his authority and
[8:42] Dominion Power
[8:44] he would lose his godship over the Earth
[8:48] this was the death of him being an
[8:51] amateur God
[8:53] and eventually it would lead to a
[8:55] physical death
[8:56] because remember he did not die
[8:59] immediately Adam Sue went on to live
[9:03] so man never lived a day in the eyes of
[9:07] God
[9:08] he never lived one day in the eyes of
[9:10] God because the Bible says that A
[9:13] Thousand Years is as one day unto the
[9:16] Lord and no man has ever lived a
[9:18] thousand years
[9:21] so in the eyes of God man never lived
[9:24] today
[9:25] yes so the women not the man she broke
[9:28] the Covenant because she stepped across
[9:30] the borders of God's word now if she
[9:33] broke a covenant with a husband she
[9:35] broke a covenant with God
[9:37] he says when you break your promise and
[9:40] your Covenant to God's word that's what
[9:42] caused so many illegitimate church
[9:45] members
[9:46] so many denominations because they broke
[9:49] their covenants with God
[9:51] amen the Covenant at first between man
[9:55] and wife was co-equal the properties but
[9:58] now after the fall there is another
[10:00] covenant made
[10:02] now she was no longer ruler with him
[10:04] each must have a separate Covenant
[10:08] find that in the message marriage and
[10:10] divorce he says we got another Covenant
[10:13] now now it's another Covenant now there
[10:15] is a covenant for the product and the
[10:17] byproduct notice before brought trouble
[10:20] death to every creature of creation
[10:22] making a difference in all nature
[10:26] amen so he says first was just a
[10:28] covenant Adam and Eve was co-equal one
[10:31] man and one woman now the woman sinned
[10:34] and what does she do she throwed them
[10:36] all to death and God had to make a
[10:40] covenant by that and not a covenant
[10:42] Unity is writing Genesis 3 16 he made
[10:45] another Covenant
[10:47] so the world had to be repopulated not
[10:50] by the original creation of God like in
[10:53] the beginning not by the original
[10:55] creation but by sex desire through women
[11:00] amen now you know the original thought
[11:04] of God that man was supposed to the
[11:07] spoken word
[11:08] to speak for children amen
[11:12] but this was the permissive will now
[11:16] that a woman would conceive and be a
[11:18] child amen
[11:20] but God is Not Taken unawares
[11:23] remember all of this happened so that he
[11:25] could express his attributes amen amen
[11:28] yes amen
[11:30] he says that's the reason Jesus had to
[11:33] come through a woman to bring it back to
[11:36] its original beginning again without sex
[11:38] desire he is Virgin born
[11:41] amen straight away amen 2000 years ago
[11:45] he brought forth a man without sexual
[11:47] desire
[11:50] amen
[11:51] Hallelujah there will come a time when
[11:54] it won't be no more sex but God shall
[11:56] call his children from the dust of the
[11:58] Earth
[11:59] [Music]
[12:00] amen
[12:02] back like there was in the original not
[12:05] through any women but through the
[12:07] molding of the clay and the cosmic light
[12:09] and the petroleum he will create again
[12:12] like he did Adam at the first time Jesus
[12:15] made this possible by God making himself
[12:18] a man and coming to the world so that he
[12:21] could die through this woman amen ask
[12:24] yourself the Believers that have gone on
[12:27] their body of decayed in the grave
[12:30] how are they going to get another body
[12:32] to another home
[12:34] but God shall call them out from the
[12:37] dust of the earth that's what he's
[12:39] saying there amen God's going to create
[12:41] them bodies again amen
[12:44] hallelujah amen
[12:46] in order for them to become glorified
[12:48] bodies they need flesh bodies again
[12:52] but if I take you to the graves this
[12:54] morning and I dig up the graves you will
[12:56] see that they have disintegrated yes
[13:00] amen oh yes
[13:03] but you are the Creator God will speak
[13:06] amen and that's the loud voice
[13:09] you will cry with a loud voice amen and
[13:12] they will come up in their bodies
[13:15] Resurrection bodies amen amen and the
[13:18] theophonies will dovetail with that body
[13:20] and it will become a glorified body amen
[13:24] yes thank you amen amen so we see from
[13:28] Adam to Abraham the Covenant change from
[13:31] conditional to an unconditional now it's
[13:34] no longer what you can do to keep the
[13:37] word but it's the Holy Ghost and power
[13:39] that is keeping me alive
[13:42] yeah it's the I will Covenant it's
[13:45] nothing we can do to inherit salvation
[13:47] but God rich in his Mercy has given us
[13:50] salvation full and free this morning
[13:53] give God a hand of Praise amen
[13:57] he says I want you to notice again there
[14:00] was also two covenants give one Covenant
[14:02] was given to Adam which was on
[14:04] conditions like law if you will not
[14:07] touch this then you will live but if you
[14:09] touch this you will die that was a law
[14:12] then there was another law given to
[14:14] Abraham which was by Grace
[14:16] unconditionally
[14:21] your little mistakes
[14:23] doesn't hinder God's grace to you oh
[14:26] thank you Lord hallelujah
[14:28] your thoughts and your failures
[14:31] amen
[14:33] cannot separate you from the love of
[14:35] Christ
[14:37] amen hallelujah do you know what
[14:40] unconditional love is it's nothing that
[14:43] you can do
[14:45] amen he says I have saved you and your
[14:48] seat after you that is a type of Calvary
[14:51] not a type of Adam Covenant he say
[14:54] abrahamic Covenant
[14:56] amen hallelujah and here in the message
[14:59] God's provide a place of worship and he
[15:02] said and that's the law that Christians
[15:04] must live by do we have any Christians
[15:06] here this morning he says we must live
[15:08] by the unconditional Covenant
[15:11] look that's the way Christians must live
[15:14] is not what we do ourselves but what he
[15:16] has done for us Christ has already been
[15:19] sacrificed no more amen necessary for
[15:22] you to go purge yourself and go through
[15:24] purgatory and burn candles amen but by
[15:28] one sacrifice amen the price of
[15:30] redemption has been paid
[15:32] foreign Lord amen
[15:34] holy Christ has already been sacrificed
[15:37] not he will be he has been it's a
[15:40] finished product yes he lived he died
[15:44] rose again ascended into heaven and has
[15:47] come back in the form of the Holy Ghost
[15:50] he says so if you finish work with God
[15:53] Christ knowing no sin became my sin
[15:57] that I might stand in this place amen
[15:59] aren't you thankful for that
[16:01] [Music]
[16:03] took our place at Calgary Church
[16:05] amen therefore we must go to Calgary and
[16:08] die yes
[16:10] down at the cross where my savior died
[16:14] amen amen
[16:17] and because of the law of sin and death
[16:19] is in the body you have to die to become
[16:22] reconciled with him amen
[16:25] now God has a new covenant
[16:28] the New Testament means New Covenant
[16:31] amen
[16:33] we find their medical types of covenants
[16:36] I'll just give you three covenants that
[16:37] we use you know about the Chinese
[16:40] laundromat yes how we couldn't write
[16:43] English so he wrote something on the
[16:45] paper and he told he gave one piece to
[16:47] you if you gave your laundry there
[16:49] amen and the only way you could collect
[16:52] your laundry is that those two pieces
[16:54] might match perfectly together yes
[16:57] maybe you could try to impersonate some
[16:59] writing
[17:01] and bring back another piece of paper
[17:02] like what the nominationalism have done
[17:05] but when they match it it's not a
[17:07] perfect match
[17:10] amen the two ends must compare to get
[17:13] your clothes
[17:15] then there was in the Oriental days how
[17:18] they took an animal and they stood
[17:19] between the animal and toyed apart they
[17:22] tore the body apart
[17:23] amen
[17:26] and a covenant was confirmed and when
[17:29] they brought the two pieces together
[17:31] they had to adapt here just exactly
[17:34] and then the third type is when God is
[17:36] showing us with the sacrifice of Jesus
[17:39] Christ that he took Jesus to Calvary he
[17:42] tore him apart amen and he received the
[17:46] body up into heaven and he sent the
[17:48] spirit down to the Earth amen amen down
[17:51] to us and the same spirit that was on
[17:54] him must be upon us and it must stop
[17:57] chill together because in that same
[18:00] spirit that moves Jesus from the dead
[18:02] dwells in you he will also Quicken I
[18:06] just want to party amen amen
[18:11] Hallelujah this is what the prophet says
[18:13] now he says here and the church he's
[18:15] been given a covenant
[18:17] amen what is the Covenant the Covenant
[18:21] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:24] which is the Seed of Abraham bring him
[18:28] to us so he's saying Abraham brought
[18:30] this blessing to us
[18:32] and then God making this Covenant that
[18:35] every man that's called into this grace
[18:37] of God by the Holy Ghost has the same
[18:39] promise that Abraham had of eternal life
[18:42] amen amen
[18:44] amen
[18:46] Galatians 3 and verse 13 amen the
[18:49] prophet is just not making this up he's
[18:50] taking it out of scripture he says
[18:53] Christ has redeemed us from the curse of
[18:55] the law the curse of that first Covenant
[18:59] being made in curse for us for it is
[19:02] written curse is everyone that hanged on
[19:04] a tree and in verse 14 he says that the
[19:07] blessing of Abraham might come on the
[19:11] Gentiles to Jesus Christ that we might
[19:14] receive the promise of the spirit
[19:16] through faith
[19:20] amen so let's not that's just the
[19:22] opening remarks amen let's not lose
[19:25] focus of what we are saying the mighty
[19:27] Angel has descended with the King to
[19:31] unlock our covenant rights
[19:34] so who is this Mighty angel
[19:37] the mighty angel of Revelation 10 is the
[19:40] Covenant angel
[19:42] it's the same angel that left Moses
[19:45] Hallelujah
[19:47] [Applause]
[19:48] oh come on now amen anoint your faith
[19:52] amen this morning he's the same angel
[19:56] and he says yeah who is this Mighty
[19:58] angel you're in Souls that are in prison
[20:00] now he says he saw this Mighty Angel
[20:03] come down
[20:04] do we have Revelation 10 there let's
[20:06] read this first I saw another Mighty
[20:08] Angel come down from heaven
[20:10] so this is not an angel this is not an
[20:13] Earthly Angel this is not the seven
[20:15] churches Messengers right this is an
[20:17] angel from heaven amen amen a mighty
[20:20] Angel an archangel
[20:23] come down from heaven and he is clothed
[20:26] with a what
[20:27] a cloud
[20:29] let's go back to the previous picture
[20:31] clothed with a cloud
[20:34] somebody came from the U.S recently
[20:39] and he said he can't place a scripture
[20:40] and tie the cloud with it
[20:42] he's a very close family member of the
[20:44] prophet
[20:47] and his statement is that he cannot tie
[20:49] the cloud with scripture
[20:52] being in the message
[20:55] you cannot come here to family relation
[20:57] yes right you have to come through
[20:59] revelation
[21:04] brother Brandon when he is talking about
[21:06] the vision of the constellation of
[21:08] angels he said if the vision is
[21:11] scripture it must be interpreted by
[21:13] scripture yes amen
[21:15] and when he said I'm going to Revelation
[21:17] 10 to interpret the scripture
[21:19] [Music]
[21:22] a bunch of unbelievers
[21:25] amen
[21:28] let's go
[21:30] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[21:32] from heaven and his clothes on the cloud
[21:34] and a rainbow upon his head and his face
[21:39] was as it was a son and his sweetest
[21:41] pillars of Fire
[21:43] and he had in his hand a little book
[21:45] open
[21:46] and he set his foot upon the sea and his
[21:49] left foot upon the Earth
[21:52] and when the seven pandas adapted their
[21:54] voices so he cries with a loud voice
[21:56] first right
[21:57] he says
[21:59] when he cried with a loud voice seven
[22:01] Pounders after their voices and when
[22:03] seven Thunders and after their voices I
[22:05] was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[22:07] from Heaven singer to me seal up those
[22:10] things which the Seventh Son has acted
[22:12] and write them not and the angel which I
[22:15] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[22:17] Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[22:20] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[22:22] ever who created heaven and the things
[22:25] therein are and the earth and the things
[22:27] that therein are and the Sea and the
[22:30] things which there is that there should
[22:32] be time no longer
[22:34] and he says but in the days of the voice
[22:38] of the seventh Angels amen when he
[22:41] singular

[29:09] now when he elected your predestinated
[29:11] you back in the mind of God he doesn't
[29:13] mean you were in a body
[29:15] yes let's read what the prophet says
[29:21] he says it is not the person that comes
[29:24] predestinated eternally from God
[29:29] it is the word the
[29:33] that is it way back there too far for
[29:35] the human mind to grasp the Eternal god
[29:38] with eternal thoughts thought and
[29:40] decreed Jacob have I loved but issue and
[29:44] neither was born so it was the thought
[29:47] that was in God's mind that you were
[29:50] predestinated
[29:51] elected he says here and neither had
[29:54] done good and evil see it was the
[29:57] thought
[29:58] and then that thought became expressed
[30:01] so through the bedding ground of time
[30:03] you became expressed through the womb of
[30:05] your mother
[30:08] and God brought back Jacob because Jacob
[30:12] alone was sick
[30:14] in your family there may have been many
[30:16] other siblings
[30:18] um
[30:19] but God brought you oh thank you Lord

[30:39] runeth but it's God that showed Mercy
[30:42] amen thank you amen amen
[30:46] Jacob alone had the seed and that is why
[30:49] he had what the ones who can't
[30:51] predestinated thoughts and other seed
[30:54] have respect to the birthright and
[30:57] Covenant of God
[30:59] amen the Bride of Jesus Christ is very
[31:03] respectful

[33:10] they are gentiles hey people out of the
[33:13] Gentiles for his names sick taking it
[33:18] for his name the church that got his
[33:21] name will come back to him amen now you
[33:25] see why they don't want to come back to
[33:26] him
[33:27] because he called out to them the call
[33:30] was made and the Lord cried at midnight
[33:34] amen behold the bridegroom cometh going
[33:37] out to meet him
[33:39] and they were asking what's his name we
[33:42] told them the Lord Jesus Christ they say

[34:09] who call himself believe two Lord
[34:11] doctrines
[34:14] sure
[34:16] they're going to ask Jesus because
[34:18] that's the only body you're going to see
[34:19] got him yes because God is a spirit
[34:23] foreign
[34:27] they're going to go to Jesus and say
[34:30] where's the father
[34:31] where's your father
[34:33] and you say
[34:35] when you have seen me
[34:38] amen
[34:39] [Applause]
[34:40] [Music]
[34:42] amen hallelujah so the Church of God his
[34:46] name will come back into him because
[34:48] that's who she is her life I hope that
[34:51] the church truly understands it what I
[34:53] mean you people this is now in the first
[34:55] seal I'm going to call you Pride
[34:59] for the first time he called her the
[35:01] bride why he was going to expose the
[35:04] soap was the poor exposed it to one
[35:06] husband now you was really easy
[35:10] to form the marriage ceremony
[35:13] he says I'm going to call you bride that
[35:15] you'll understand it
[35:19] now what is the evidence of a covenant
[35:22] people
[35:23] everybody following this morning amen
[35:25] what is the evidence of a covenant
[35:27] people let's see what the property is
[35:29] saying amen some of the actual fruits of
[35:31] it he says when on the day of Pentecost
[35:33] when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[35:35] Pentecost the life was given to the
[35:37] church and that church went right out
[35:40] and produced they wrote behind that
[35:42] church a book of Acts
[35:45] you know
[35:47] of what it did because it was Christ in
[35:50] the apostles so if it is Christ in us
[35:52] the hope of glory we must write another
[35:55] book of Acts
[35:57] amen amen
[36:01] but I mean if you know it's going to be
[36:03] something you strive for yes yes you
[36:06] can't live in this life and just be
[36:08] caught up in the cares of his life let
[36:10] us here I will choke you yes that's
[36:12] right let us yell will kill the spirit
[36:15] okay
[36:16] that's right
[36:19] you have got to stay in the word amen
[36:22] you've got to stay in the right
[36:23] atmosphere amen you cannot associate
[36:26] with the only people with worldly living
[36:29] worldly talk we have got to be a
[36:32] separated people and Covenant people is
[36:35] a separate people
[36:37] amen we'll talk differently who walk
[36:40] differently amen
[36:42] and they must take note that you have
[36:44] been with Jesus amen they must tell you
[36:47] but how come you are not like the other
[36:49] Christians
[36:50] amen there's something different about
[36:53] you
[36:57] amen
[36:59] now
[37:00] so we that's the evidence they must
[37:02] write another book of Acts
[37:04] the Covenant people were given a sign
[37:07] now remember when the mighty angel came
[37:10] in the days of Abraham
[37:12] and he descended you remember two other
[37:14] angels
[37:16] Abraham said my Lord you saw one Lord
[37:19] then the mighty Angel comes and he gives
[37:21] him a sign amen and the prophet says
[37:24] you're witnessing the final sign yes
[37:26] before the Judgment of God form
[37:29] because that was the final sign he
[37:31] deserved Sarah's heart with his back
[37:33] turned to the tent yes
[37:36] of higher fell and saw them
[37:38] he's going to repeat or has repeated and
[37:42] we're waiting for the fire to fall
[37:46] listen he says
[37:48] but remember he elected predestinated
[37:51] now we know who that was we said it was
[37:53] a seed right we are going in sequence
[37:55] here so follow along
[37:57] we describe what the elected who was the
[38:00] predestinated and who has the four-day
[38:02] Covenant Abraham and his group got a
[38:05] messenger
[38:07] we also had a messenger right he said
[38:10] aha watch what he did he gave them a
[38:13] sign that the time was near for the fire
[38:15] to fall
[38:17] now it's fire that we are looking for
[38:22] atomic fire the wrath of God now that
[38:26] messenger did something he spoke about a
[38:28] woman that he had his back turned to
[38:31] and he told her she was doubting what he
[38:34] was saying
[38:36] told her conditions and what was going
[38:38] to happen is that right did he say that
[38:41] the son of man would reveal himself in
[38:43] the same way that day well do you
[38:45] believe that's the truth amen now he
[38:47] says well here stands a woman now he's
[38:49] going to perform the same sign yes right
[38:54] so you see only the Covenant people
[38:56] recognized it
[38:58] yes we know it's the last sign given to
[39:00] the Gentile world
[39:02] listen now
[39:06] he says here
[39:09] and in The Invisible Union of the church
[39:12] the bride to Christ
[39:15] the messing death messenger is here now
[39:17] which is Jesus Christ is saying
[39:19] yesterday today and forever now don't
[39:22] get confused
[39:24] because remember it's a son of man
[39:26] revealing these son of man
[39:29] so it's Jesus Christ
[39:31] using his body
[39:33] so he's telling them in the invisible
[39:36] Union of the church the bride to Christ
[39:38] that messenger is here now which is
[39:40] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[39:42] and forever now do you believe you could
[39:44] tell me what's the matter with this
[39:46] woman before I even look it up amen I
[39:49] want you to know that same spirit is
[39:51] here right now I can discern your baby

[40:05] got a boy on her mind
[40:07] he's suffering with a kind of mental
[40:10] condition nervous condition and
[40:12] complications that's right do you
[40:14] believe that now he says now do you
[40:17] believe without looking at this woman
[40:19] the Lord Jesus can tell me what's her
[40:21] trouble
[40:23] so he's back turned to her now
[40:25] he says if you believe with all your
[40:27] heart you can have that baby that you're
[40:30] asking God for
[40:33] wow
[40:37] don't have evil thoughts in your heart
[40:40] God can design your eyes
[40:44] amen amen
[40:49] he says this one
[40:51] not only is she watching the baby this
[40:53] woman is wanting a great thing too
[40:55] that's not a baby but she's wanting the
[40:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:01] I'll tell you what to do if you get rid
[41:04] of them cigarettes now you also know
[41:06] she's smoking
[41:10] how many of you here want to get rid of
[41:11] your cigarettes
[41:13] you're drinking amen amen your bad
[41:17] habits your porn addiction your lust
[41:22] you lusting up to a woman
[41:26] amen amen
[41:34] you can lay down this morning amen he
[41:37] says if you get rid of them cigarettes
[41:40] God will give you the baptism of the
[41:42] Holy Ghost
[41:43] go believe it see do you believe have
[41:45] faith in God
[41:49] to the care if I needed to find this
[41:50] quote because it's kind of a long quote
[41:52] and I I didn't want to Pace today it's
[41:54] in the Easter seal
[41:56] amen
[41:57] in the Easter seal
[42:00] speech on the 14th of April 1965
[42:05] amen it's kind of a long porch but I
[42:07] wanted to read it now because this is
[42:11] what we're speaking about that the
[42:13] mighty Angel has descended with the key
[42:15] to unlock Covenant rights
[42:18] and in order to unlock the cabinet right
[42:21] of dominion over the Earth because
[42:23] remember we lost inheritance to the
[42:25] Earth
[42:25] he must bring back the title deed of our
[42:28] inheritance
[42:31] paragraph 108.
[42:34] amen
[42:37] in the Easter seal you got it
[42:41] so he sealed he says yeah
[42:46] amen
[42:48] he seals the Covenant by the Seal of
[42:51] circumcision so remember Abraham has a
[42:53] seal of circumcision
[42:55] for his Covenant and he says that God
[42:57] gives you a promise this body is going
[43:00] to be glorified with him at the end time
[43:02] but you see you have to get a clearance
[43:05] of that deed have you got it
[43:09] amen
[43:10] clearance of the deed isn't there
[43:13] so what happens any title deed has to
[43:16] get clear
[43:19] to show that there's no other claim
[43:21] being made
[43:24] you have to get a clearance of that deed
[43:26] and the clarity is where everything
[43:28] against it has been stricken off and you
[43:31] got the abstract to it meaning you have
[43:34] the original title deal
[43:36] you've got the seal it's yours
[43:38] everything in on it belongs to you
[43:42] and when you believe on the on Jesus
[43:45] Christ for your savior and repent and
[43:47] are baptized and come up to believe him
[43:49] God recognizes our repentance and our
[43:52] free towards him
[43:54] and sends down the abstract
[43:57] and the abstract is the Assurance it's
[44:00] the guarantee that everything that was
[44:02] held against you you thoroughly repented
[44:06] and the property is bought and you hold
[44:09] the abstract for the assurance
[44:12] let somebody try put you off the land
[44:15] say he belongs and you with the abstract
[44:18] in your hand let him try to do it there
[44:21] ain't no law in the land can do it
[44:23] because you hold the abstract amen
[44:27] amen listen up there's no devil no
[44:30] church no theology that can always get
[44:33] the boundaries of God's proven abstract
[44:36] [Music]
[44:39] that's why this Angel is putting his
[44:41] foot on land and sea he's suppressing
[44:43] the powers yes
[44:45] yes
[44:47] amen
[44:49] this is inheritance to the Earth
[44:52] and demon powers are coming out of the
[44:55] land and out of the sea read Revelation
[44:58] 13 you'll see a beast coming out of the
[45:00] land and a beast coming out of the sea
[45:02] that is why the mighty Angel is putting
[45:05] his foot on the land and he's putting
[45:07] his foot on the sea he's suppressing
[45:09] those two Powers amen not only is that
[45:12] angel suppressing those two Powers the
[45:15] four angels are holding back the winds
[45:18] with no Wars and strife that is why
[45:21] Putin cannot unleash a full-scale attack
[45:24] because God's people are still on the
[45:26] Earth
[45:28] [Music]
[45:29] man
[45:31] amen

[45:43] button when I'm here no

[45:47] amen hallelujah
[45:50] so he says nobody
[45:53] can overstep the boundaries of God's
[45:56] proof and Abstract right
[45:58] he says here
[46:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[46:03] recognized Us in Jesus Christ we just
[46:06] are sure to raise as he raised because
[46:08] potentially we have already raised in
[46:11] him and you are quicker and this
[46:13] quickening power brings your body into a
[46:15] raptured condition amen
[46:18] amen do you feel Rapture this morning

[46:24] raptured condition already in the spirit
[46:26] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[46:28] in your mortal body it shall also
[46:31] Quicken your mortal bodies
[46:33] this abstract it was designed to give
[46:36] them every promise that was on the
[46:37] grounds now he says in 118 it's the Holy
[46:41] Spirit today hunting out honest hearts
[46:44] that will believe that message
[46:48] [Music]
[46:50] the holy spirit is dancing out on his
[46:53] thoughts that will believe that message
[46:56] everything in the Bible that was
[46:58] promised is to the believer and when you
[47:00] accept it in its fullness God knows that
[47:03] you do it he gives you the abstract to
[47:05] that then every promise that's made is
[47:08] in your position and the Holy Spirit is
[47:11] there to Quicken that to you
[47:14] what kind of people should we be in 121
[47:18] he says it's God's promise he poured his
[47:21] spirit in the last days that when that
[47:24] what they would do notice lay downs on
[47:26] the sea everything that was in God's
[47:28] promise I support my spirit in the last
[47:31] days upon All Flesh your old man shall
[47:34] dream dreams your young men shall see
[47:36] his visions and all these different
[47:38] promises that he made everything is
[47:41] laying right there in God's promise
[47:43] Jesus redeemed it to us
[47:48] he says now in 122 if we ordained to be
[47:52] on the ground Like an Eagle walking in
[47:54] chicken's Nest the holy spirit is here
[47:57] to find you yes you know that these
[48:00] things are supposed to happen quickly
[48:02] your raptured to meet it
[48:06] and now you're sitting in Heavenly
[48:07] places in Christ Jesus Oh What A Promise
[48:11] what a heavenly father who would give us
[48:14] these things the spirit quickens their
[48:16] fellowship with God
[48:18] so that they call the dead back to life
[48:22] laying within you
[48:24] you can call the dead back to life
[48:27] come on say Amen somebody
[48:30] that's the Holy Spirit potential that
[48:32] lays within you
[48:36] you have the honest of the Resurrection
[48:39] now he says they laid their bodies upon
[48:41] the dead they came to life
[48:44] listen closely that they done the same
[48:47] things that Jesus did because the Same
[48:49] Spirit was upon him was upon them if one
[48:53] spirit makes a man act this way it makes
[48:55] the other one act that way
[48:59] you see we need to raise up into that
[49:01] level of faith
[49:03] don't think that it's not possible
[49:07] all things are possible to him that
[49:10] believeth
[49:13] amen I'm sure you're sitting in your
[49:15] chairs there this morning can feel the
[49:17] level of unbelief when that is being
[49:19] preached right now
[49:23] because we do not believe that we are
[49:25] the power laying within us
[49:28] but the Bible says that these signs
[49:30] shall follow them they believe amen Mark
[49:32] 16 is just true today as it was in the
[49:35] days of the disciples amen
[49:38] but we've got to raise up to that level
[49:40] of faith
[49:42] amen
[49:44] hallelujah amen now how many of you know
[49:48] that in Covenant requires a token
[49:50] you know when in any marriage ceremony
[49:54] yeah brother Brandon is talking he says
[49:56] I would require a token of you this is
[49:58] in the marriage vows now
[50:01] that this Covenant betwixt you
[50:03] that's been made will always be kept
[50:07] so the ring the wedding band
[50:10] is a token
[50:13] signifying that a covenant has been made
[50:19] everybody been to a wedding everyone
[50:21] looking so sad and so serious amen
[50:25] everybody been to a wedding everybody
[50:28] enjoys the Biryani but before the
[50:30] Biryani comes there's a covenant between
[50:33] the man and woman
[50:36] I gotta say man and woman
[50:39] okay
[50:40] it's not man and man and woman and woman
[50:43] a covenant is made between man and woman
[50:48] and the minister asked them
[50:50] to seal this Covenant I require a token
[50:55] okay sometimes the token costs a lot
[51:01] amen
[51:03] now he says if the token is not applied
[51:05] the Covenant is enough
[51:09] it was of non-effect not talking about
[51:11] your wedding ring now it doesn't mean
[51:13] you stop wearing a wedding ring that
[51:15] your Covenant is enough
[51:17] that is until death do your part
[51:19] right
[51:21] now listen what brother Branham says in
[51:23] the message talk and he says you might
[51:24] say well I've done this I've done all
[51:26] these things and I've paid my tithes I
[51:29] belong to the church I do all of this he
[51:32] says but God requires the token
[51:35] show that you've been identified with
[51:37] your sacrifice the one you claim to have
[51:40] the one that you believe that you have
[51:45] okay
[51:46] and when we can display the token of the
[51:49] Holy Spirit shows that we have already
[51:51] accepted in Christ that is our token
[51:54] that all we have need is already
[51:57] purchased in him
[51:58] we are identified without token
[52:02] the token must be ready
[52:05] we're going to a point with this now
[52:06] because God has given us the token as
[52:08] well
[52:10] he says the blood Covenant blood is not
[52:13] recognized without the token the word
[52:16] assures us of the promise the token is
[52:18] the sign of the purchase has been made
[52:20] for us and you know he says full
[52:23] obedience to the full word of God
[52:25] entitles us to the Token amen
[52:28] no other way is there that could ever be
[52:31] entitled to the Token until you fully
[52:34] obey the word not with not what somebody
[52:37] has put into you and added to it but
[52:40] what God has said about it now here's
[52:42] the token that he's given us
[52:45] here's the wedding ring that God has
[52:46] given us in the invisible Union of
[52:49] Christ he says hallelujah now notice
[52:51] you're not only that but you're going to
[52:53] the wedding in the sky and you're
[52:56] wearing the wedding band of
[52:58] predestinated
[53:00] unmerited Grace
[53:03] Grace is Our Winning band

[53:19] will let the woman decide how many carat
[53:21] ring they want how many carat diamond
[53:23] would you like
[53:25] amen five carat might be too big for
[53:28] your finger
[53:30] amen
[53:32] but Grace
[53:34] amen is that wedding band
[53:38] unmerited Grace he says a wedding band
[53:40] of Grace and merited of your own God did
[53:44] it himself
[53:45] he knew you before the foundation of the
[53:48] world
[53:49] now watch where did he slip the wedding
[53:51] band
[53:56] so you came into the world
[54:00] with the Grace Covenant over your life
[54:04] Hallelujah
[54:07] you may have been wandering around
[54:10] but you had Grace covering you
[54:12] a lot of other people didn't make it in
[54:14] this life
[54:15] a lot of other people ended up on the
[54:16] streets ended up drug addicts drunkards
[54:21] listen let's read now
[54:23] he knew you before the foundation of the
[54:25] world he slipped the wedding band on you
[54:28] there
[54:32] I would require a token of you
[54:37] thank you before the foundation of the
[54:40] world now who can lay a charge against
[54:42] God's elect

[54:48] a wedding band of Grace
[54:51] put your name on the book there
[54:54] what is Thanksgiving hallelujah praise

[54:59] now let's close with this to unlock
[55:01] anything in this life
[55:03] you need a key
[55:05] yes right
[55:07] we need a key to unlock anything in this
[55:09] life so we are saying the mighty Angel
[55:11] has descended with a key to unlock
[55:15] our covenant rights we just explained
[55:18] what a covenant is we just showed you
[55:20] the signs of the Covenant the token
[55:22] that's required for the Covenant amen
[55:24] but the rights of the covenants are
[55:26] locked up
[55:28] just not anybody can have Covenant
[55:31] rights
[55:32] you've got to be called You're going to
[55:33] be predestinated you're going to be
[55:36] chosen amen and we have been given the
[55:38] key when the mighty Angel has descended
[55:41] with the open book
[55:43] the title deed to man's inheritance
[55:46] he now follows our Lord to take the key
[55:49] and unlock our covenant rights
[55:52] amen

[55:57] the word the full word
[56:00] Luna without the Covenant rights opened
[56:03] up to just shall live by faith
[56:05] the mighty angel had not descended in
[56:07] his day that's right
[56:09] amen but he was the messenger of the age
[56:13] Hallelujah
[56:15] Wesley unlocked another portion of
[56:17] sanctification
[56:19] but when the messenger of Revelation 10
[56:22] 7 comes
[56:23] he will bring further light or Lewis
[56:25] teaching
[56:26] yes you will bring further light on
[56:28] Wesley's teaching
[56:30] he will bring further light on the
[56:32] Pentecostals baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:34] yes because all the mystery of God
[56:37] should be finished
[56:40] so he loses him the church shall live by
[56:43] faith
[56:43] and he spoke about justification the
[56:46] seventh angel comes and he tells you
[56:48] about real justification that it's as
[56:51] though you've never done it in the first
[56:53] place amen that's the justification that
[56:55] Luther never preached about
[56:58] then the second walk of Grace which was
[57:00] sanctification the blood
[57:03] amen
[57:05] telling you now the seventh angel brings
[57:08] for the light to the blood telling you
[57:10] it's not the literal blood but the light

[57:16] but it's the life that was in the blood
[57:18] that must come upon the believer amen
[57:20] glory amen
[57:23] then when the Pentecostals he brought
[57:25] further light on the baptism of the Holy
[57:27] Ghost they said the initial evidence is
[57:29] speaking in tongues yes but he said not
[57:32] so
[57:33] be true evidence we just went now he's
