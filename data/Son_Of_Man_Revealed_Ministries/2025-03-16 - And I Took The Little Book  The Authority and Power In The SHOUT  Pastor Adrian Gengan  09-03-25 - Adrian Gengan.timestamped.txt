[22:19] turn to our
[22:21] Bibles
[22:23] amen going to be speaking from an
[22:25] inspiration where John takes the book
[22:28] and he says and I took the book amen and
[22:30] I took the book praise the Lord so we'll
[22:33] go to Revelation 5 and my inspiration
[22:37] out of that
[22:40] is that the
[22:42] authority and the
[22:44] name is revealed in the
[22:46] shout amen amen amen it's only in the
[22:50] shout that we have the authority
[22:53] restored amen Revelation 5 and verse1
[22:57] and I saw in the right hand right hand
[23:00] is very important amen I saw in the
[23:02] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[23:04] a book written within and on the
[23:06] backside sealed with Seven Seals and he
[23:09] came and took the book out of the right
[23:11] hand of him that sat upon the throne and
[23:14] they sung in new
[23:15] song saying thou are worthy to take the
[23:18] book amen what made Jesus worthy now
[23:21] they're saying amen and to open the
[23:24] seals this is what made him worthy thou
[23:26] was
[23:27] slain and has redeemed us to our God by
[23:31] thy blood out of every Kindred tongue
[23:33] people Nation notice that's the same
[23:36] group now that we are asked to prophesy
[23:38] again amen amen the Lord had blessings
[23:41] to the reading of his word you may be
[23:42] seated we'll go to Revelation 10 and
[23:44] verse
[23:45] one praise the Lord Revelation 10 and
[23:49] verse1 we'll see this book now coming
[23:51] down to the Earth remember it was taken
[23:53] out of the right hand
[23:55] amen and this Mighty angel coming down
[23:58] now brother Bram is saying only Christ
[23:59] it could
[24:01] be it's not the Book Changing Hands it's
[24:04] the one who has the book changing form
[24:07] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[24:09] from heaven clothed with a cloud you're
[24:13] wondering what cloud This Cloud yes amen
[24:16] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[24:19] face were as it were the Sun and his
[24:21] feet as pillars of fire and he had in
[24:24] his hand a little book open yes so the
[24:26] book was closed in heaven the book is
[24:28] now open on the earth amen and he set
[24:31] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[24:33] foot upon the
[24:34] Earth there's a reason for putting the
[24:36] foot on the sea and upon the Earth if
[24:39] you read Revelation chapter 13 there's a
[24:41] beast rising from the earth there's a
[24:42] beast rising from the sea so he's coming
[24:45] to suppress those demon
[24:47] powers amen praise the Lord and then
[24:49] we'll drop down to Revelation 108 there
[24:52] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[24:54] spake unto me again saying go and take
[24:56] the little book which is open in the
[24:59] hand of the Angel which standed upon the
[25:01] sea and upon the Earth and I went I John
[25:06] I the bride amen I the wife I the son
[25:10] amen last week we were speaking on the
[25:12] changing of mask just like how Christ
[25:15] changed his mask the bride has been
[25:17] changing her mask in the different drama
[25:19] in the different scene she's no longer
[25:22] just the bride called out she's the
[25:24] married wife amen but she's not just the
[25:27] married wife she's the wife reproducing
[25:29] The Life of Christ and it's only this
[25:32] type of person who is now an adopted son
[25:34] that can stand positionally in
[25:36] Revelation 108 to take the
[25:38] book hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[25:43] amen to prove that
[25:45] point Eve can't take back the
[25:48] book Adam lost the book amen so a son
[25:52] lost the book so because a son lost the
[25:55] book in Genesis a son must be standing
[25:57] in Revel 10 Amen to take back the book
[26:01] yes praise the Lord amen amen and the
[26:04] voice speak unto me again said go and
[26:07] take the little book which is open in
[26:09] the hand of the Angel which standed upon
[26:11] the sea and upon the Earth and I went
[26:13] unto the angel and said give me the
[26:15] little
[26:16] book
[26:18] Hallelujah when you know it's yours you
[26:20] go back and you say give me the little
[26:22] book yes
[26:24] amen and he said unto me take it eat it
[26:27] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[26:29] and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[26:31] honey and I took the little book out of
[26:34] the Angel's
[26:35] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[26:38] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[26:41] had eaten it my belly was
[26:43] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[26:46] prophesy again before many peoples
[26:49] Nations and tongues and Kings before we
[26:53] move on I want to show you why prophesy
[26:55] to these nations tongues and Kings amen
[26:58] because in this book have
[27:00] names hallelujah amen is this the title
[27:03] deed of
[27:04] redemption so in this book has names so
[27:07] the one that is asked to prophesy again
[27:09] he asked to call those names which are
[27:11] in the book amen hallelujah
[27:14] am amen I need you to get into an
[27:16] atmosphere this morning I need you to
[27:18] forget about what happened at home I
[27:20] need you to get into the spirit of the
[27:22] service amen hallelujah so in this book
[27:25] of names and the one that is asked to
[27:27] prophesy again must call those names in
[27:29] the
[27:30] book praise the Lord so Revelation 17
[27:33] and 15 will tell you why we are asked to
[27:36] prophesy to Nations tongues and kings
[27:38] and he says the waters which thou sawest
[27:41] where the horse
[27:42] sth and of peoples and multitudes
[27:46] Nations and
[27:48] tongues so the S is trying to
[27:51] suppress it's sitting upon Nations
[27:54] tongues Hallelujah but we are asked to
[27:57] release a word of Prophecy amen yes now
[28:00] remember what I said the book is not
[28:02] changing hands the one who has the book
[28:05] is changing
[28:07] form now if you progress that thought he
[28:10] is there Seated on the throne God
[28:12] Almighty he's got the book in his hand
[28:14] in his right hand and then the lamb
[28:16] comes forth from the sanctuary that is
[28:19] why they couldn't find Jesus amen the
[28:22] high priest had to go into the holiest
[28:24] of holies so for seven Church ages Jesus
[28:27] was in the Holy Hest of holies amen
[28:29] making intercession so when they were
[28:31] looking in heaven they were looking in
[28:32] the earth beneath the Earth they
[28:34] couldn't find Jesus because nobody could
[28:36] go into the holiest of holies they had
[28:38] to wait for the high priest to come back
[28:40] out again amen so at the end of seven
[28:42] Church ages the high priest is now
[28:44] coming back out again to give witness
[28:47] that the blood that he sacrificed and
[28:48] shed had been accepted can somebody say
[28:51] Amen
[28:52] am that is why they say you are slain
[28:55] and your blood has redeemed us amen so
[28:59] the the book is now changing not
[29:01] changing hands changing form the lamb is
[29:04] coming to take the
[29:05] book then we find in Revelation 10 the
[29:08] mighty Angel which is Christ it's the
[29:10] same Lord Jesus changing form amen yes
[29:14] it's a mighty Angel Amen brother brandom
[29:16] says he had Swift Back Wings amen
[29:19] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah but then
[29:23] what happens in Revelation
[29:25] 108-111 is he still changing form oh
[29:28] come on somebody get this it is Christ
[29:30] now in bright form right
[29:33] amen amen so who is really taking back
[29:36] the book it is Christ in me the hope of
[29:39] glory amen therefore I can stand
[29:42] positionally upon the Earth he is now
[29:44] Christ in bright form taking back the
[29:47] title deed to man's inheritance and we
[29:50] know brother brandom is saying when the
[29:51] seals were open that was now opening up
[29:54] man's inheritance Hallelujah everybody
[29:57] amen okay amen amen so brother brandom
[30:00] is going to tell us what right hand
[30:01] means right hand means power and
[30:05] authority amen he says this in Hebrews
[30:07] chapter 1 he says what does right hand
[30:10] mean right hand means power and
[30:12] authority got the authority of
[30:15] everything in Heaven and Earth and all
[30:18] of heaven and earth is made by
[30:21] him hallelujah thank you Lord amen I
[30:25] want to tell you something amen you may
[30:27] agree with me or you may disagree with
[30:28] me but it's the word of the Lord because
[30:30] I'm going to challenge your thinking now
[30:33] man was given the Earth can you say Amen
[30:35] to that amen let's put it up Psalm 115
[30:38] praise the Lord amen amen while we here
[30:41] we might as well get to it amen you can
[30:42] get to verse I think it's maybe around
[30:44] 12 13 somewhere around there but it's to
[30:46] the letter part okay we know that he
[30:48] will bless us let's get to the next one
[30:51] amen next one maybe 15
[30:55] even right you are blessed of the Lord
[30:58] made Heaven and Earth
[30:59] amen next the heaven even the heavens
[31:02] are the Lords but the Earth had he given
[31:05] to Children of Men amen amen yes amen so
[31:09] the heavens belong to the Lord but the
[31:12] Earth he had given to Children of Men
[31:14] that's why he created a man in His image
[31:16] and likeness and said have dominion over
[31:17] the Earth but I want to show you that
[31:19] you are unique
[31:21] people when Jesus Christ arose and he
[31:24] ascended on high he said all power in
[31:27] heaven and earth yes is given to me
[31:30] Hallelujah that's the bridegroom that's
[31:33] the husband says all power in heaven and
[31:36] on
[31:37] Earth so we go beyond this because he
[31:41] didn't just keep it to
[31:42] himself but what he reclaimed he says I
[31:45] now give it to you if you read that
[31:48] quote again brother amen you see what
[31:50] the prophet is saying
[31:51] here he says right hand means power and
[31:55] authority got authority of everything in
[31:57] heaven and and
[31:59] Earth and all heavens and earth is made
[32:01] by him now when this bride overcomes
[32:04] this age what does the the promise say
[32:07] to you that overcome I will grant that
[32:09] you sit with me in my throne even as I
[32:12] overcame and sat down in my father's
[32:14] strong so I'm saying that this bride
[32:16] this wife of the Lord Jesus
[32:19] Christ
[32:21] amen a words are not just effective on
[32:24] the earth because whatever you bind on
[32:26] Earth is bound in heaven am and whatever
[32:28] you loose on Earth is Loos in heaven oh
[32:31] come on the authority has been given
[32:33] back to the
[32:34] church when you speak Heaven
[32:37] responds Hallelujah when Daniel spoke he
[32:40] had one prayer and Heaven dispatched
[32:44] Angels though there was resistance amen
[32:47] but Heaven dispatched Angels immediately
[32:50] when a son and daughter of God a man was
[32:52] connected Amen Hallelujah to the Holy
[32:55] Ghost when he speaks his word is a
[32:57] powerful in heaven just like Jesus
[33:00] word amen if you don't believe your your
[33:03] word is as good as the father's word
[33:05] then Redemption means nothing he came to
[33:08] make us amen ears of the father joint
[33:11] ears with the son now how many of you
[33:13] have a joint account and you draw less
[33:15] than the other
[33:18] person Amen brother rames brother Tyson
[33:22] you got a joint account in that account
[33:23] is 100
[33:26] million can you to him it's a joint
[33:29] account you both have access to it can
[33:32] brother rames dictate to brother Tyson
[33:34] you can withdraw how much you
[33:36] need no it's a joint
[33:39] account now if brother Tyson is drawing
[33:42] sparingly whose fault is
[33:45] it is it brother rames
[33:48] fault if brother rames is drawing
[33:50] sparingly who fault is
[33:52] it amen so brother Brandon is saying
[33:55] that the church is living beneath the
[33:56] Privileges she's too afraid to take back
[33:59] what was rightfully given to her and the
[34:02] the reason for that is because we don't
[34:04] realize the access that's been open to
[34:06] us under the shout amen the shout opened
[34:09] up a dimension to us amen amen the shout
[34:13] opened a dimension to the bride it's a
[34:16] door that's open to us it's a realm
[34:19] that's open to us amen praise the
[34:22] Lord and now in Genesis chapter 4 just
[34:25] want to read this one point here genes
[34:28] sorry maybe not Genesis maybe Exodus
[34:31] chapter 4 Exodus chapter
[34:35] 4 praise the lord it's actually Exodus I
[34:39] wrote Genesis there and Moses said but
[34:42] behold they will not believe me nor aren
[34:45] to my voice for they will say the Lord
[34:48] had not appeared unto
[34:50] thee they can still challenge you
[34:53] today and say that you claim hey man if
[34:56] this is not working
[34:58] maybe the battery is getting a bit
[35:00] lower
[35:03] amen what we can do is maybe change his
[35:05] battery or it's fine it's coming back
[35:08] slowly there's power being restored to
[35:10] the
[35:12] church if they disputing that you are
[35:14] the
[35:15] ones that has the authority because look
[35:18] at what Moses is saying now they may not
[35:20] believe me and not aren to my voice if
[35:25] somebody asked to prophesy again amen
[35:28] am yes praise the Lord but they may not
[35:31] believe
[35:33] you follow the point now they may not
[35:36] believe you neither may they AR to your
[35:38] voice
[35:39] Hallelujah then what he says they may
[35:42] say that the Lord has not appeared unto
[35:44] me they may tell you that the Lord has
[35:46] not appeared unto you they may dispute
[35:49] that the Lord has appeared to
[35:52] you Hallelujah yes they may tell you the
[35:56] Lord has not appeared to you they made
[35:58] dispute that you amen that you have not
[36:00] heard the voice of God and the Lord says
[36:03] what is that in thine hand amen I am
[36:06] asking you what is this in your hand
[36:09] what have you really taken back from the
[36:12] angel so they may dispute
[36:15] this they may dispute that you heard
[36:18] something but show them what you
[36:22] have amen hallelujah what is that in
[36:26] your hand amen praise the Lord and he
[36:29] said a rod I say the open book I say
[36:33] title deed amen hallelujah but they
[36:36] can't see it for too long because John
[36:40] goes immediately to reclaiming his
[36:42] rights the book was lost by
[36:45] eating Eve lost the book in the Garden
[36:48] of Eden by eating of the
[36:50] fruit so rather than keeping the book
[36:53] outside the book has got to get inside
[36:55] amen yes Lord praise the Lord amen I'm
[36:58] in the message I have all the message
[37:00] books that's on the outside Hallelujah
[37:04] but are you sealed on the inside amen
[37:06] amen with your flesh you can carry the
[37:09] message book with your flesh you can say
[37:11] I'm in the message but I need to see
[37:13] that amen move on into the insides and
[37:16] the message have an effect on you where
[37:18] you become the Living Word where we are
[37:21] the manifested word it's no longer just
[37:23] a profession but it becomes a life
[37:26] Hallelujah amen somebody give God praise
[37:29] amen hallelujah I'm asking you what is
[37:31] in your hand John takes the book and
[37:35] book amen that eating is a symbology in
[37:38] the in the Book of Genesis Eve ate of
[37:42] the fruit and and she gave to Adam to
[37:45] eat we know that was a sexual act
[37:48] because that is a symbology in the Book
[37:51] of Proverbs it says an adulterous woman
[37:53] eateth wipes her mouth and says I have
[37:56] done no wrong right amen praise the Lord
[38:00] so what is really happening here when
[38:02] John is eating the book somebody tell me
[38:05] they coming into
[38:07] Union
[38:09] Yes somebody tell me that seed is being
[38:12] put into the
[38:14] bride seed for reproduction of life amen
[38:17] the word coming into you is a seed for
[38:20] reproduction of life amen hallelujah
[38:23] then there's got to be a growth stage
[38:24] for the son to come to maturity under
[38:26] tutors and guides but when now he's in
[38:29] full Authority when he's accepted by the
[38:32] father amen the voice comes and says
[38:35] this is my beloved Son here he him amen
[38:39] that's what you see there in the last
[38:40] part of Revelation 1011 the son come to
[38:43] maturity and when the Lord is asking the
[38:45] nations of the earth to hear this
[38:47] prophecy coming out of this bride he's
[38:49] asking Nations tribes and Kings to hear
[38:52] he her
[38:55] Am Lord amen God won't ask the nations
[38:58] of the earth to hear your prophecy if
[39:00] he's not thoroughly convinced that you
[39:02] can handle the
[39:04] authority because the son that comes
[39:06] into position has the authority of the
[39:08] father amen who he fires is fired who he
[39:12] hires is hired he can withdraw from the
[39:14] bank account amen hallelujah he can take
[39:17] care of father's business I say we get
[39:19] about to taking care of father's
[39:21] business amen don't you know that I must
[39:24] be about my father's business amen
[39:26] hallelujah
[39:28] make the father's business your business
[39:30] amen make the father's will your will
[39:33] make the father's purpose your purpose
[39:35] make the father's passion your passion
[39:38] amen hallelujah oh we give God praise we
[39:41] give him glory this morning amen
[39:44] hallelujah amen we get too caught up in
[39:46] the things of this life amen but I want
[39:48] to say that the Church of Jesus Christ
[39:50] the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[39:53] who has reproduced his life the son now
[39:55] standing he's perfectly positioned in
[39:57] Revelation 108 to11 to fulfill the
[40:00] father's prophecy yes amen yes Lord we
[40:04] are not standing in Revelation 108-111
[40:07] as the bride who is not married come on
[40:11] now yes we are not standing there like
[40:14] Esther walking through the palace afraid
[40:16] to get into the holiest of holies she's
[40:19] Queen yes she's got the garments but
[40:21] she's walking around the palace doesn't
[40:24] know what to do with
[40:26] promise until a thundering voice cries
[40:28] out to her Hallelujah and says who knows
[40:31] whether you've been called for such a
[40:32] time as this you w't called to walk in
[40:34] the outou of cour you w called to be in
[40:37] the Holy amen holy place you are called
[40:39] to be in the holies of holies so take me
[40:41] to the king yes Lord thank amen that's
[40:45] why this wise virgin needs to progress
[40:48] from walking with a lamp light in
[40:51] leosa because Matthew 10 amen Matthew
[40:54] 25:10 says a door was opened
[40:57] amen and she was pulled into the
[40:59] marriage amen those that were ready were
[41:02] pulled into the marriage amen so watch
[41:05] our confession if you still confessing
[41:07] you're the wise virgins walking around
[41:09] with lamp light he says lamp light you
[41:11] can't use artificial light in the
[41:13] presence of the sunlight amen oh thank
[41:16] you amen and this is the progression of
[41:18] the Bride she is changing mask yes once
[41:21] we were the wise virgins with oil in our
[41:23] lamp but that was good for the church
[41:25] ages now it's the bright age and in the
[41:27] bright age only one light will last it's
[41:30] your kind of Glory
[41:32] light we can't go into the Hest of
[41:35] holies without lamp light and impress
[41:37] the Shak Glory light he will not be
[41:39] impressed he will kick out that light
[41:41] and you say that was good for all the
[41:44] ages l oh glory be to his name amen this
[41:49] is the age of where our impossibilities
[41:50] become possible amen God is putting his
[41:53] name on you God is putting his stamp on
[41:55] you and saying you are the the voice on
[41:57] the Earth right now you are the ones who
[41:59] carry my authority Jesus won't leave the
[42:02] heavens and come down to the Earth to do
[42:04] anything if he's going to do anything
[42:06] it'll be him doing it through your body
[42:09] because Jesus don't have eyes but your
[42:11] eyes Jesus don't have feet but your feet
[42:14] Jesus don't have ears but your ears
[42:16] Jesus don't have a mouth but your
[42:19] mouth amen praise the Lord wonderful God
[42:23] Matthew 17:19 the disciples come to
[42:26] Jesus and they can't cast out a demon
[42:29] yes sir amen I want to show you we are
[42:31] not positionally placed now where demon
[42:33] powers are resisting
[42:36] us every demon power must bow when we
[42:40] speak we carry an authority but you've
[42:42] got to know that you carry this
[42:45] Authority and Jesus said unto them
[42:48] because of your
[42:49] unbelief you're living in a realm amen
[42:53] where there's no faith yes
[42:57] because of your unbelief for verily I
[42:59] say unto you if you have faith as the
[43:01] grain of a mustard seed you shall say
[43:05] unto this mountain remove ends To Yonder
[43:07] place and it shall remove and nothing
[43:10] shall be impossible unto
[43:13] you what kind of faith faith he says now
[43:18] now I I'd like to believe that we as the
[43:19] church have progressed from M Seed Faith
[43:22] we can't have this message of the hour
[43:24] and be walking around claiming we got
[43:25] mid Seed Faith this is the entire book
[43:29] of The Plan of Redemption the Seven
[43:31] Seals brother Bram says amen this
[43:33] blessed revelation of the Seven Seals
[43:35] has been opened up to us a new land
[43:37] opened up to us so how can we now walk
[43:40] around with mustard seed free come on
[43:42] church we are to have a great of Faith
[43:44] amen yes Lord we can't be flying in low
[43:47] dimensions of Faith amen amen then that
[43:50] eagle is is is got a
[43:52] problem amen do you know the eagle in
[43:54] the valley is going through a time of
[43:56] renewal that's right amen maybe you're
[43:58] moving in low levels of low levels of
[44:00] faith I'm telling you amen strengthen
[44:02] yourself you weren't born for the valley
[44:05] you weren't born for that point in your
[44:07] life yes sir you were born to S up there
[44:10] hallah praise the Lord amen so I'm
[44:13] saying Jesus is saying if you have the
[44:16] faith of a mustard seed I'm saying come
[44:18] on church Faith is measurable Jesus said
[44:21] oh you have little faith and then he
[44:22] said I've never seen such great faith
[44:24] how do you want to be measured in the
[44:26] kingdom of God amen somebody with little
[44:28] faith a Mustard Seed Faith but look what
[44:32] a Mustard Seed Faith Can Do move a
[44:34] mountain he says and nothing shall be
[44:37] impossible to you so I'm saying at the
[44:39] opening of the word when perfect faith
[44:41] is now been preached into us and perfect
[44:43] faith is arising out of us nothing shall
[44:46] be impossible to
[44:48] you praise the Lord sir
[44:53] amen so part of my point is to tell you
[44:55] know what we have taken taken back know
[44:58] what we have eaten amen then the
[45:01] authority and the name is revealed
[45:03] through
[45:04] us if we don't know that we carrying the
[45:07] authority amen then something is wrong
[45:11] praise the Lord it says now Jesus also
[45:14] goes on to say the next verse there how
[45:16] be it this kind goeth not out but by
[45:20] prayer and
[45:22] fasting now clearly we've evolved
[45:26] because people
[45:27] people don't fast and
[45:29] pray do you think Jesus has an
[45:31] expectation of us to fast and pray let's
[45:34] see quickly just to get this point
[45:36] Matthew 66 but thou if thou
[45:41] prayest what is Jesus expectation when
[45:45] thou
[45:45] prayest know me you know me and Jesus be
[45:48] like
[45:50] this yeah if you're like this then
[45:52] you're far apart me and Jesus were like
[45:55] this my thoughts even before I speak he
[45:58] just knows Jesus is saying when you pray
[46:02] amen hallelujah hallelujah enter into
[46:06] your closet some people like to make
[46:09] loud prayers do you know some people
[46:11] pray better prayers here in church than
[46:12] at
[46:15] home because yeah is the
[46:18] publicans yeah is out in the public they
[46:21] pray long prayers here even God is here
[46:24] say he I never knew this guy can pray
[46:25] like this
[46:30] you at home he just says bless me Father
[46:32] for I have sinned and he goes to
[46:34] bed amen praise the Lord so let us not
[46:38] be like the Pharisees now my point is to
[46:41] show you Jesus expectation is for us to
[46:43] pray he says when thou prayest enter
[46:47] into your closet shut the door pray to
[46:49] your father which is in secret and your
[46:51] father would see it in secret shall
[46:53] reward you openly drop down to verse 17
[46:55] there and see about fasting as well
[46:58] because message people think they don't
[46:59] know to fast but thou when thou
[47:03] fastest Hallelujah so the expectation of
[47:07] the of the husband is fast and
[47:10] pray Hallelujah let's move on that was
[47:13] just by the way and when you're fasting
[47:14] and praying don't go tell everyone me
[47:16] I'm fasting e hey me I'm fasting Jesus
[47:19] says you see people would like to walk
[47:21] around with go back brother with dry
[47:24] hair he says put oil in your hair
[47:28] anoint your head and wash your
[47:31] face don't walk around so feeble what's
[47:34] wrong I'm fasting
[47:37] man you want everyone to be sorry that
[47:40] you're
[47:41] fasting amen hallelujah these things are
[47:44] to be done in secret praise the Lord
[47:46] let's move
[47:48] amen so believing the promises of God
[47:51] which is the word of God is opening up
[47:53] doors to us opening up Realms to us amen
[47:57] Heavenly placed DMS yes Shar Dimensions
[48:01] amen doors that we didn't know existed
[48:03] before Jesus is teaching us that nothing
[48:06] will become impossible to you if you can
[48:08] believe amen hallelujah amen now we know
[48:12] in Luke 137 nothing is impossible with
[48:15] God but if he saying nothing is
[48:17] impossible with you then what level of
[48:19] PL does that put you in
[48:22] amen hallelujah is he sharing something
[48:25] with you is it giving you access to a
[48:27] dimensional
[48:29] door hallelujah thank you Lord praise
[48:31] the
[48:33] Lord now we know it's because of the
[48:35] Cross and what he achieved and he died
[48:38] he he buried he rose again all power in
[48:40] Heaven and Earth is given unto him but
[48:42] what he redeemed he didn't keep to
[48:45] himself let's find it here the prophet
[48:47] is saying what does title did now you
[48:50] know in the in the breach he's basically
[48:52] speaking about the seven seal book and
[48:53] he's speaking about our inheritance Amen
[48:56] on Wednesday we spoke about what that
[48:57] book is it's our
[49:00] inheritance he says it's legal
[49:02] possession to that abstract deed title
[49:05] deed of eternal life means that you
[49:07] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[49:09] lost the possession of that
[49:12] deed thank you Lord now we can't be
[49:14] saying that Adam could speak to the
[49:16] winds Adam could speak to the waves Adam
[49:18] could speak this Adam could talk to the
[49:20] animals brother brandom is saying that
[49:23] the possession of this book means that
[49:26] we possess everything Adam and Eve lost
[49:29] but as long as we walk around without
[49:31] the ability to speak without the faith
[49:33] to operate the word amen hallelujah the
[49:36] word must be mixed with faith you can't
[49:39] take the word alone you got to mix it
[49:41] with faith otherwise you wonder like the
[49:44] children in the wilderness 40 years
[49:46] you're wondering 40 years you're
[49:48] wondering do you know it was supposed to
[49:50] be a 3 days journey yes Hallelujah but
[49:53] what stopped it they unbelief they
[49:55] didn't mix the word with faith
[49:57] how long are you praying over your
[49:58] situation how long are you praying over
[50:00] your problem I'm asking you let's
[50:02] reexamine the situation let's re-examine
[50:04] the case amen have we been wandering
[50:07] around this Wilderness for 40 years and
[50:09] having no
[50:11] breakthrough praise the
[50:13] Lord amen this is the point I also want
[50:15] to get to in Revelation chapter 5 he
[50:17] says is the title deed of redemption
[50:19] this seven seal book it's a title deed
[50:22] you wait till we get into those seals he
[50:24] breaks the seals reveals gives us his
[50:27] inheritance to his people yes he gives
[50:30] the inheritance that he
[50:32] inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and
[50:35] freely gives it out to us now remember
[50:38] what Jesus inherited he inherited Heaven
[50:40] and Earth can somebody say
[50:43] Amen it all belonged to him he was the
[50:47] one who redeemed it but instead of
[50:49] keeping it himself he gives it back to
[50:51] the people that's his love for us
[50:53] somebody ought to praise God for that
[50:55] amen
[50:58] amen amen now Wednesday we were trying
[51:02] to tell you and I'll condense it to tell
[51:04] you that an inheritance is given for
[51:07] continuity and inheritance is not given
[51:10] for you to squander it amen when
[51:13] somebody leaves you an inheritance
[51:14] that's your privilege it's not a right
[51:18] you as a father if you own Al's wealth
[51:20] land you you you are not obligated to
[51:22] leave it to your son though they possess
[51:24] your legal name it's your right who you
[51:27] want to leave it with so an inheritance
[51:29] is left for continuity all that a man
[51:32] labors for works for is for continuity
[51:35] he builds up for the next Generation so
[51:37] that they can live off the fruit of his
[51:39] labors amen amen so in inheritance is
[51:42] not meant to be Grievous the The
[51:44] Inheritance is meant for you to better
[51:45] your
[51:47] life it's meant to be a blessing to the
[51:50] one who's going to be a recipient of it
[51:52] thank you Lord and the ones who receive
[51:55] the inheritance must live in The
[51:57] Inheritance amen
[52:02] yes amen
[52:05] amen now Matthew 25 remember now the end
[52:09] of the story The talents how does God
[52:11] measure faithfulness by what we have
[52:14] done with what he's given us the one who
[52:16] did nothing with what he has given us he
[52:19] said binding maned foot cast him into
[52:21] out of
[52:22] darkness and I was tying that with one
[52:25] point in particular
[52:27] I was telling you you can't do nothing
[52:30] with the message that's been given to
[52:33] you
[52:34] right you can't come back when the Lord
[52:37] is coming back and asking you what have
[52:39] you done with this word you can't quote
[52:42] back the word of God behold you sent me
[52:45] Elijah the prophet I know I sent you
[52:48] Elijah the prophet in fact in Malachi 4:
[52:51] 5 and 6 I am talking to you I am not
[52:54] talking to William Brandon amen I am
[52:57] telling you I will send you Elijah the
[52:59] prophet so how can when I come back you
[53:01] telling me that you sent me Elijah the
[53:03] prophet which means you've done nothing
[53:05] with the
[53:08] word amen what is he expecting when he
[53:11] comes back he's expecting the end result
[53:14] of Malachi 4:5 and 6 he's expecting your
[53:16] heart to be turned back to the faith of
[53:18] the
[53:19] fathers so when he's coming back and he
[53:22] tells you what have you done with the
[53:23] word you must say praise the Lord you
[53:25] sent me Elijah the prophet and my heart
[53:27] has been turned back to the faith of the
[53:31] fathers praise the Lord you sent me the
[53:34] message of the hour Lord and now I
[53:37] didn't just receive the word but I am
[53:39] the
[53:41] word wonderful when he gives you the
[53:43] revelation of the word yes Lord when
[53:45] he's coming back he's not expecting you
[53:47] to give him the revelation of the word
[53:50] what is he expecting I won't put you
[53:51] that up I am the word made flesh today
[53:55] he's expecting a man estation of the
[53:57] word God doesn't want you to give him
[53:59] back the revelation of the word God
[54:01] wants you to give him back the
[54:02] manifestation of the word amen thank you
[54:06] amen because when God said let there be
[54:07] light he wasn't expecting the word to
[54:09] come back like a rebound let there be
[54:11] light let there be light he was
[54:13] expecting light to come
[54:16] back so don't be impressed with people's
[54:18] revelation of the word tell them I want
[54:20] to see the manifestation of the word
[54:23] amen I'm glad I'm glad brother that you
[54:25] have the revelation of the word but amen
[54:27] I'm Looking Through The Eyes Of God and
[54:29] I want to see the manifestation of the
[54:32] word amen we've been too impressed with
[54:36] preachers amen who have the revelation
[54:38] of the word I say give me the
[54:41] manifestation praise the Lord amen amen
[54:45] because this word is to sustain us now
[54:47] I'm saying this is our inheritance and
[54:49] Adam was asked to multiply it and
[54:51] replenish are we multiplying the word of
[54:54] God is the word being multiplied daily
[54:56] Our Lives amen are we a fruitful Vine
[54:59] amen oh somebody give God praise amen
[55:03] amen amen so it's a it's a privilege to
[55:06] have this open word it's a privilege to
[55:08] have the inheritance it's not it right
[55:10] so Lord we thank you for this
[55:13] privilege thank you Lord an honor that

[56:26] claiming to be having the shot message
[56:29] but living physical natural lives
[56:31] defeated lives yeah the shot put you
[56:33] into the realm of the supernatural amen
[56:36] come on now Church the Shar puts us in

[56:43] we are not of this
[56:45] world Amen I'm not the like the the next
[56:49] guy the neighbor here both of us may be
[56:51] going to the same place the same office
[56:53] the same work doing the same job the
[56:56] difference is he's going there Amen in
[56:58] the natural realm but I'm going to the
[57:00] same work the same job in Heavenly
[57:02] places I'm walking in my position I'm
[57:05] walking in my authority people may be
[57:08] shopping in checkers like you amen but
[57:10] they are shopping in the natural realm
[57:11] but I'm shopping in Heavenly places in
[57:13] Christ
[57:15] Jesus praise the
[57:18] Lord amen hallelujah so he's allowed us
[57:21] now access to the supernatural realm
[57:24] amen and and to believe means to have
[57:28] brother brandom says you ask anyone on
[57:29] the road you believe he say yes he
[57:31] believes amen but you really must have
[57:35] faith and perfect Faith opens up this
[57:38] dimension of the
[57:40] [Music]
[57:42] supernatural like I said we shouldn't be
[57:44] walking around in Mustard Seed Faith
[57:47] now amen we ought to be walking around
[57:50] with perfect Faith amen it's a world
[57:52] that nobody knows nothing about let's
[57:55] see what Jes what kind of world Jesus
[57:57] lived in amen praise the Lord Jesus
[57:59] lived in a world that no one know about
[58:02] he was an odd person he lived in a world
[58:05] of perfect faith in the perfect
[58:08] God when he spoke to them they say this
[58:12] and they and then they said you talking
[58:15] riddles we don't understand
[58:17] this you know when you talk the message
[58:19] of the hour it's encoded language to
[58:23] them that's right when you say behold I
[58:25] send thee Elijah the
[58:27] prophet they can't understand a word you
[58:29] are saying don't get fascinated with
[58:33] their tongues when you speak you're
[58:34] speaking in tongues to
[58:38] them they can't understand the bride's
[58:41] language they can't understand about a
[58:43] mighty Angel they can't understand about
[58:45] amen seven angels in a cloud they can't
[58:48] understand about the pillar of fire they
[58:51] can't understand about water
[58:54] baptism it's encoded
[58:56] language praise the Lord yes so he's
[59:00] saying they can't understand Jesus how
[59:02] can this be see there wasn't in the
[59:04] world he lived in now I'm saying we
[59:07] can't live in a separate world than what
[59:09] Jesus lived in I'm saying he was living
[59:12] in the realm of Faith he was living in
[59:14] another dimension on the earth you see
[59:17] the the problem will be if you think
[59:18] dimensions are far
[59:20] away brother Bram is saying if you pick
[59:23] this up and rejected King he's telling
[59:25] you that when he went beyond the curtain
[59:26] of time he said it was just a slanted
[59:29] Dimension he said I was standing here I
[59:31] could see my body he didn't say I was
[59:34] thousands of miles away and I took a
[59:38] a I looked I grabbed the abble telescope
[59:41] and I looked back on the earth he didn't
[59:44] say
[59:45] that he said I saw my old body there my
[59:49] hands behind my head it was just here
[59:50] another dimensional
[59:52] way just you
[59:56] praise the Lord amen so Jesus lived in
[59:58] this world what do you think happened
[1:00:00] when Peter was calling out to him to
[1:00:02] come on the
[1:00:05] Water Peter was there in the natural
[1:00:07] realm Jesus was in the Supernatural
[1:00:09] realm walking on water praise the Lord
[1:00:13] amen so then he stepped onto Jesus
[1:00:15] ground that's right Peter stepped into
[1:00:18] the supernatural realm amen so he walked
[1:00:20] on water am amen praise the Lord thank
[1:00:23] you
[1:00:24] Lord let's
[1:00:26] see they wasn't in the world that he
[1:00:28] lived in they couldn't understand him
[1:00:31] nobody could understand him he was a
[1:00:34] Mystic to them with his perfect Faith
[1:00:37] now he brings it down to us if we lived
[1:00:39] in a perfect faith of a
[1:00:41] Christian to what we are we'd be a
[1:00:45] Mystic to the
[1:00:46] world the people won't understand you
[1:00:49] you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit
[1:00:51] said you would do what it forbid you
[1:00:53] would not do that's the way it's to all
[1:00:56] all believers they were Mystic the
[1:00:59] people don't understand because they
[1:01:01] live in a world to themselves so when a
[1:01:04] man lives by faith walks by faith I mean
[1:01:07] substance Faith he is isolated from the
[1:01:09] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:01:12] in Christ there now you're getting into
[1:01:14] bright material you're getting into
[1:01:16] rapturing condition now this means for
[1:01:19] each one of you not just the pastor
[1:01:21] deacons trustees this means for the Ley
[1:01:24] every individual walks in a world with
[1:01:26] God Alone amen yes hallelujah amen and
[1:01:30] I'm going to say this amen sometimes you
[1:01:32] walk in a world alone that even it
[1:01:34] doesn't doesn't mean that you're living
[1:01:36] in the same house that the next person
[1:01:39] understands the world you live in come
[1:01:41] on
[1:01:43] now nobody know this is an individual
[1:01:45] walk you could be walking in ey
[1:01:47] dimensions of the Holy Ghost that they
[1:01:49] know nothing about but they just see you
[1:01:51] as the same old same
[1:01:53] old amen praise the
[1:01:57] Lord I know I know the opposite is much
[1:01:59] more
[1:02:01] true amen sometimes you OPP is much more
[1:02:04] true that's why you can't say Amen
[1:02:06] praise the Lord I am saying that we are
[1:02:09] to be living such
[1:02:11] lives brother Bram is saying we live in
[1:02:13] a world that nobody knows nothing about
[1:02:15] we live in a world with God
[1:02:17] Alone amen hallelujah in this
[1:02:20] Supernatural world we don't just share
[1:02:21] our
[1:02:24] experiences right this these things are
[1:02:26] sacred trust given to you am there are
[1:02:29] some things that you can't utter to the
[1:02:30] next person there are some things that
[1:02:33] I'm meant to be kept brother Bram says
[1:02:35] I'll have to take this to my
[1:02:39] grave what is it
[1:02:41] experiences with the
[1:02:43] supernatural because he learned under
[1:02:45] the first two you explain the gift too
[1:02:49] much so just because you're the daughter
[1:02:52] at home doesn't mean your mother
[1:02:54] understands the world you live in
[1:02:58] praise the
[1:03:00] Lord just because you're the father at
[1:03:02] home doesn't mean everyone understands
[1:03:04] the world you're
[1:03:06] liveing
[1:03:08] amen but that will create problems if
[1:03:12] the family is not
[1:03:14] United they'll see you as a nut they'll
[1:03:17] see you as a crank they'll see you as an
[1:03:19] OD ball amen praise the
[1:03:23] Lord hallelujah
[1:03:26] you're baptized into this kingdom and
[1:03:28] there's your mother there with you your
[1:03:31] wife there with you who's there with you
[1:03:33] brother Jaden what's brother brandham
[1:03:36] saying who's there with
[1:03:39] you
[1:03:41] nobody so how can they explain to you
[1:03:43] experiences you
[1:03:46] having
[1:03:48] amen if you are the only eye
[1:03:53] witness come on now this is for all of
[1:03:56] you amen nobody else in there but you
[1:03:59] and
[1:04:00] God he gives out the orders you pack
[1:04:03] them out praise the Lord amen whatever
[1:04:08] he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt
[1:04:10] nowhere now this is St John
[1:04:13] 5:19 if you don't know this is where the
[1:04:15] bride ought the sun should be St John
[1:04:17] 5:19 the sun can do nothing but what he
[1:04:20] see the father do that do the son
[1:04:22] likewise this is the point the end of it
[1:04:25] all
[1:04:26] we only do what the father says do St
[1:04:29] John 5:19 amen this is what brother
[1:04:31] Brandon is explaining
[1:04:33] here whatever he says there's not a
[1:04:35] Shadow of Doubt anyway you walk right on
[1:04:37] if the Lord says this is nobody in the
[1:04:39] world can talk you out of it you go
[1:04:41] right on just the same now now you're
[1:04:43] coming in perfect
[1:04:44] Faith see this is not Mustard Seed Faith
[1:04:49] now amen because everybody wants to
[1:04:53] stand before mountain and speak to it
[1:04:58] but when he tells you close your mouth
[1:05:04] now I thought you said I must
[1:05:09] speak there certain times you'll tell
[1:05:13] you
[1:05:18] amen but can we listen now everything he
[1:05:20] saying are we so sensitive to the spirit
[1:05:24] are we so sensitive to Father's voice
[1:05:26] voice praise the
[1:05:28] Lord you go right on just the same now
[1:05:31] you're coming to perfect Faith perfect
[1:05:33] Perfection that cannot fail that faith
[1:05:35] never fails yes he was a Mystic to them
[1:05:38] with his perfect faith and so it is now
[1:05:40] with those who have perfect faith I
[1:05:42] Mystic to
[1:05:44] others
[1:05:47] amen so when when he said nothing is
[1:05:49] impossible to those who believe he's
[1:05:51] giving us access to the ones who believe
[1:05:54] into a realm of infinite
[1:05:56] power I said this is only under the
[1:05:58] shout now
[1:06:00] hallelujah amen to invade Jesus Christ
[1:06:04] has given us access to this for what to
[1:06:06] invade Realms of
[1:06:09] impossibility amen we actually have it
[1:06:12] encoded in our genene
[1:06:14] seed to ascend Realms of impossibility
[1:06:18] we were born to invade The Impossible we
[1:06:20] were born to see things deemed
[1:06:22] impossible to watch them bend and bow to
[1:06:25] the name of Jesus Amen yes thank you
[1:06:29] Lord amen praise the Lord amen amen that
[1:06:34] Jesus speaking through our lips
[1:06:36] yes amen nature obeying our Voice
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:41] Hallelujah because those words of Jesus
[1:06:46] are longing to be uted but he has no
[1:06:48] voice but whose voice hallelujah amen
[1:06:52] Jesus has words that he wants to speak
[1:06:53] in 2025
[1:06:55] but he's not going to thunder from the
[1:06:58] heavens he's in his bride
[1:07:01] Hallelujah so as long as we're talking
[1:07:03] the things of the world he can't find
[1:07:04] the filter to speak through our
[1:07:07] lips what am I trying to say he's trying
[1:07:10] to find expression through you Amen to
[1:07:13] speak things through you thank you Lord
[1:07:16] Christ wants to express himself through
[1:07:17] the bright
[1:07:19] body come on now but sometimes the voice
[1:07:23] of God is silenced and didn't because we
[1:07:26] are speaking our own words we are living
[1:07:29] our own lives Lord Christ can't have
[1:07:31] expression through our
[1:07:36] lips oh God help us amen so the DNA
[1:07:40] that's encoded in our genes the essence
[1:07:42] the seed that's in US it it wants to
[1:07:45] give expression to Christ to speak like
[1:07:47] Christ spoke do you know that you and
[1:07:49] Christ words are exactly the same come
[1:07:52] on now Hallelujah
[1:07:56] oh praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:07:58] praise the Lord amen
[1:08:01] hallelujah Jesus wants to find
[1:08:03] expression through
[1:08:05] you where your words will find no
[1:08:08] impossibility amen and finds expression
[1:08:10] where you can manifest his power
[1:08:12] manifest his authority through you amen
[1:08:15] for his Kingdom Purpose Matthew 9:23 we
[1:08:17] need to move now amen Matthew 9:23 says
[1:08:21] if thou can't believe
[1:08:23] amen all things are possible possible to
[1:08:26] him that believeth amen praise the Lord
[1:08:29] amen if thou can believe all things are
[1:08:32] possible to them that believe
[1:08:35] amen amen so this word that's been
[1:08:38] released to us I want you to take your
[1:08:40] word and elevate it I want you to take
[1:08:43] the deadness of the word and elevate it
[1:08:45] because people have made the word dead
[1:08:48] when we repeat the word it's
[1:08:51] dead when we recite the word it's dead
[1:08:55] right but when we allow the word to have
[1:08:56] expression we give it life amen let's
[1:08:59] read 1 Corinthians 2:4 Paul is saying my
[1:09:01] speech which means my words and
[1:09:03] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:09:06] man's Wisdom but in what demonstration
[1:09:09] of the spirit and of power I'm saying
[1:09:12] we've been given accesses to this amen
[1:09:15] than Lord I say we've been given
[1:09:17] accesses to this amen this battery has
[1:09:19] run out
[1:09:20] amen it's okay I'll just grab the other
[1:09:22] mic amen just switches on
[1:09:27] what do we need Hallelujah less
[1:09:30] profession more manifestation hallelujah
[1:09:33] amen hallelujah tell your neighbor I'm
[1:09:36] tired of your
[1:09:38] profession how about some
[1:09:40] manifestation don't tell me how much
[1:09:42] power you got can you prove
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:47] it
[1:09:49] hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:09:52] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:09:54] of power amen people preach all night
[1:09:56] people lay dead then to call the
[1:09:58] Undertaker Paul wasn't like that if my
[1:10:01] preaching caused you to fall asleep and
[1:10:02] you died I have enough power and
[1:10:04] resurrection power to raise you back up
[1:10:06] again amen

[1:11:30] sufficient of not that we are sufficient
[1:11:32] of ourselves to think anything as of
[1:11:34] ourselves but our sufficiency is of god
[1:11:37] it's Christ that lives in US Church who
[1:11:39] also made us able Min this is what I
[1:11:41] love I'm looking for able Ministers of
[1:11:44] the spirit I'm tired of able Ministers
[1:11:46] of the letter able ministers that can
[1:11:48] take quotes that can take scriptures
[1:11:51] able ministers really but what is the
[1:11:53] Bible saying I'm looking for able
[1:11:55] Ministers of the New Covenant the New
[1:11:57] Testament is the New Covenant not of the
[1:12:00] letter but of the spirit so what are we

[1:12:22] that but he says amen
[1:12:27] able Ministers of the New Testament not
[1:12:29] of the letter but of the spirit sir how
[1:12:32] many Ministers of the leure do we
[1:12:34] have but where are the Ministers of the
[1:12:37] spirit that can tap into the mind of

[1:13:00] believing church we just read
[1:13:04] there in Mark
[1:13:06] 9:23 if thou can't believe all things
[1:13:09] are possible I'm taking you this morning
[1:13:12] into the Realms of
[1:13:13] impossibility thank you Lord to take
[1:13:15] away all doubts and fears and show you
[1:13:18] that the bride has been put into a realm
[1:13:20] a place in the shout that she hasn't
[1:13:22] been accessing yes she hasn't been
[1:13:24] living that real of
[1:13:26] impossibility yes praise the
[1:13:29] Lord listen to The Prophet now he's
[1:13:31] saying listen to the last message that
[1:13:33] fell from our savior's lips then believe
[1:13:35] Mark the 16th chapter 14th verse after
[1:13:38] he appeared unto the 11 and they said at
[1:13:40] meat upgraded them with their unbelief
[1:13:43] and Hardness of Heart because they
[1:13:44] believe not them which had seen him
[1:13:47] after he was risen he said unto them go
[1:13:49] into all the world preach the gospel to
[1:13:52] Every Creature brother Brandon goes on
[1:13:54] to say not many people just call it the
[1:13:56] word the word is right but the signs
[1:13:59] follow the word that's
[1:14:01] right yes it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we
[1:14:05] don't just preach
[1:14:06] signs we preach what the prophet is
[1:14:08] preaching we are saying signs follow the
[1:14:11] word so after all the wonderful
[1:14:13] Revelations after all the wonderful
[1:14:16] teachings where are the signs that are
[1:14:18] to be following the word amen I am
[1:14:20] asking you where are the signs that
[1:14:22] ought to be following the word thank you
[1:14:24] Jesus how are we going to prove Hebrews
[1:14:26] 13:8
[1:14:28] amen is not Hebrews 13:8 in word
[1:14:33] only who's reading this with me thank
[1:14:35] you Lord the word is right but signs
[1:14:38] follow the word amen Paul said the
[1:14:40] gospel came to us something not in word
[1:14:42] only but through the power and
[1:14:44] demonstration of the Holy Spirit not to
[1:14:46] prove that what he was speaking of he
[1:14:48] said preach it to Every Creature praise
[1:14:51] the Lord preach it to the Apostle amen
[1:14:55] sometimes the Apostle is
[1:14:57] sick need of healing if a human won't
[1:15:01] listen to you maybe an apostle needs
[1:15:02] healing maybe a c needs healing maybe a
[1:15:05] bird needs healing but speak to Every
[1:15:07] Creature because creation is waiting for
[1:15:10] its Master sometimes we are only looking
[1:15:12] for human beings to display the gospel
[1:15:14] and to speak a word sometimes you see a
[1:15:17] sick bird there but you don't think that
[1:15:19] all creation has come looking for its
[1:15:21] Master amen amen
[1:15:26] thank you Lord for those of you who
[1:15:28] don't know young ones there was an
[1:15:29] apostle that was sick or the children
[1:15:31] were sick somebody correct me if I'm
[1:15:33] wrong amen sick mother carrying babies
[1:15:37] and he came to the prophet and laid
[1:15:39] there and the prophet let it lay there
[1:15:41] he couldn't figure it out until the Lord
[1:15:43] revealed to him he must pray for that
[1:15:44] Apostle he prayed for that Apostle it
[1:15:47] greeted him amen said Thank you and went
[1:15:50] away
[1:15:51] amen
[1:15:53] hallelujah he to Every
[1:15:56] Creature praise the
[1:16:00] Lord he that believeth and is baptize
[1:16:03] shall be saved he that believeth not
[1:16:05] shall be damned and these signs shall
[1:16:07] follow them that believe these are the
[1:16:09] signs that follow the word in my name
[1:16:11] they cast out Devils now we say no you
[1:16:14] know what it's not wise to cast out the
[1:16:17] devil you know what we too smart the
[1:16:20] Bible says if we cast this one out seven
[1:16:23] more will come rather live with this one
[1:16:26] than
[1:16:31] eight amen so people rather deal with
[1:16:34] that one than
[1:16:39] eight thank you Lord they shall speak
[1:16:42] with new tongues yes I believe yes
[1:16:45] brother you believe but some speak with
[1:16:47] new tongues you know nothing about
[1:16:50] Hallelujah even their boss get shocked
[1:16:52] at the words coming out of their mouths
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:58] hey praise the Lord when you're dead
[1:17:01] they come to your funeral and they're
[1:17:02] doing Christian funeral day and everyone
[1:17:04] in the work is shocked this fellow was a
[1:17:08] Christian amen now you walk to them
[1:17:11] every day of the week
[1:17:15] right they know your words came from the
[1:17:17] pits of
[1:17:19] hell now the pastor is there this
[1:17:21] brother lives such a s Sanctified life
[1:17:24] he's now resting safely In the Arms of
[1:17:27] Jesus the boss is thinking wondering if
[1:17:29] he's at the right
[1:17:31] funeral
[1:17:32] hey maybe he screams from the back what
[1:17:35] is Jesus doing washing his
[1:17:39] mouth Our Lives must be examples
[1:17:41] wherever we
[1:17:42] go like you said the last time Christ
[1:17:46] don't have undercover agents in the
[1:17:51] Army
[1:17:52] amen there's no FBI agent
[1:17:56] praise the Lord you must have full
[1:17:57] uniform on fully identified with the
[1:18:00] word if they take up serpents drink any
[1:18:03] deadly things it shall not hurt them if
[1:18:05] they lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:18:07] recover amen now here's I just want to
[1:18:10] follow up that with another am man quote
[1:18:12] to prove that point he said in Matthew
[1:18:14] 24 true Spirits would be so close that
[1:18:17] only the very elect would tell them
[1:18:19] apart so you have a Divine amen ability
[1:18:22] to tell two Spirits apart
[1:18:25] yes sir they alone would not be
[1:18:27] deceived how can you tell two Spirits
[1:18:30] apart just give them the word test sir
[1:18:33] if they don't speak the word they are of
[1:18:35] the evil one as the evil one deceived
[1:18:37] the first two Brides he will deceive the
[1:18:39] Bride of this last days by trying to get
[1:18:42] to her to iodize herself through Creeds
[1:18:44] but just plainly turning from the word
[1:18:46] to any sign that suits her but God never
[1:18:49] play Signs ahead of the word signs
[1:18:53] follow the word amen
[1:18:56] as when Elijah told the woman to bake a
[1:18:58] cake for him first according to the word
[1:19:00] of the Lord and when she did as the word
[1:19:04] said the proper sign
[1:19:06] came amen come to the word first if you
[1:19:10] got a need now listen to this come to
[1:19:12] the word first and then watch the
[1:19:14] miracle amen amen people want to you
[1:19:17] know sometimes you invite no no just
[1:19:19] come come get you you'll get you healing
[1:19:21] no come to the word first and then watch
[1:19:24] the miracle
[1:19:26] praise the Lord the seed word is
[1:19:28] energized by the spirit hallelujah amen
[1:19:32] thank you Lord so I'd like to say that
[1:19:35] when when Elijah asked that woman to
[1:19:37] bake a
[1:19:38] cake and he must have told the testimony
[1:19:41] I was being fed there by Ravens but the
[1:19:45] brook dried up but the Lord told me to
[1:19:47] come here and she must have said that's
[1:19:51] nothing but the truth amen
[1:19:55] Glory yes
[1:19:58] Hallelujah she must have told Elijah
[1:20:00] that's nothing but the
[1:20:03] truth
[1:20:05] amen so your response can change your
[1:20:08] situation right
[1:20:10] now now listen response to a
[1:20:15] testimony your response that's why I'm
[1:20:18] challenging the church now change the
[1:20:21] way we sit in church
[1:20:25] you need to become a part of everything
[1:20:27] that's
[1:20:29] happening right agreeing with a
[1:20:32] testimony can position you into a
[1:20:34] realm of Faith where all things are
[1:20:37] possible so I'm saying when somebody is
[1:20:40] testifying don't sit dumb in the
[1:20:43] service you know sometimes this happens
[1:20:45] and I'm going to say it happens here in
[1:20:46] this church when somebody's testifying
[1:20:49] here that person feels like they're in
[1:20:51] this room
[1:20:53] alone you don't hear anyone make even a
[1:20:56] murmur they don't agree they don't
[1:20:59] praise the Lord they don't get into the
[1:21:02] testimony you left alone
[1:21:05] here they feel like Alcoholics
[1:21:10] Anonymous my
[1:21:14] name left
[1:21:16] alone you can't watch it with
[1:21:19] praise I'm trying to show you a
[1:21:21] testimony

[1:21:25] write a testimony right and she didn't
[1:21:28] sit there

[1:21:33] are saying amen I'm trying to help you
[1:21:35] church amen if you're taking offense to
[1:21:38] it then you are in the flesh I'm trying
[1:21:41] to show you how to receive your
[1:21:44] breakthrough because your agreement to a
[1:21:47] testimony can change things when a song
[1:21:50] is being sung you look there
[1:21:56] can't get into the spirit of
[1:21:58] things
[1:22:00] amen don't sit down when someone is
[1:22:03] testifying atti writes
[1:22:05] response not brother Brandon that's
[1:22:08] nothing but the
[1:22:09] truth

[1:22:14] so rigid so
[1:22:16] robotic amen like a dead I can't say
[1:22:19] eagle so if you're not a dead eagle what
[1:22:21] are you dead chicken
[1:22:25] be
[1:22:27] alive respond to a
[1:22:29] testimony there's nothing wrong with you
[1:22:31] getting rowdy in the church while
[1:22:33] they're saying that's nothing but the
[1:22:35] truth brother that's nothing but the
[1:22:37] truth or say something that's my God he
[1:22:41] does paradoxes he does impossible things
[1:22:44] am nobody will get upset
[1:22:47] here praise the Lord thank you Lord amen
[1:22:51] you are speaking the truth what you was
[1:22:52] telling brother brandom you are speaking
[1:22:54] the truth truth she was giving life to
[1:22:56] brother bram's testimony because you
[1:22:58] know when brother rames comes here to
[1:22:59] testify only he knows what happens but
[1:23:02] when you agree with him and say that's
[1:23:04] nothing but the truth brother brother
[1:23:05] rames you are giving life to his
[1:23:08] testimony amen praise the Lord amen
[1:23:12] she's touched heaven heaven came down
[1:23:14] the Shan of Glory came down in the room
[1:23:16] that day amen somebody singing an
[1:23:19] anointed song get into the spirit of the
[1:23:20] song Worship the Lord through that song
[1:23:23] God can do something when you get into
[1:23:24] the spirit of it amen and I like to say
[1:23:27] again I don't like a dead church I like
[1:23:30] a church where the Holy Ghost brings
[1:23:32] emotion brother Bram says anything
[1:23:34] without emotion is death now remember
[1:23:36] there's difference between emotion and
[1:23:38] sensation brother Bram says amen that
[1:23:40] the Holy Ghost don't work with sensation
[1:23:43] but it does bring emotion amen can you
[1:23:46] imagine them there on the upper room 120
[1:23:48] of them so casually you wouldn't have
[1:23:51] found 20 of them sitting quietly and got
[1:23:53] a quiet Holy Ghost
[1:23:56] while the other 100 are jumping about
[1:23:59] all emotional 20 stood
[1:24:02] there my Holy Ghost
[1:24:05] quiet
[1:24:07] no they all brother brandom says the
[1:24:11] door was too small so they were looking
[1:24:13] for Windows to jump
[1:24:15] through amen he said they were flying
[1:24:18] out of Windows flying out of doors drunk
[1:24:22] in the spirit
[1:24:26] amen hallelujah could not contain
[1:24:28] themselves sometimes we become over
[1:24:30] dignified sometimes Baptist wayed in
[1:24:33] Methodist wayed in nazarine wayed in
[1:24:35] amen can't say a holy ghost filled
[1:24:38] hallelujah amen amen how about we say a
[1:24:41] holy ghost
[1:24:44] hallelujah how about a holy ghost
[1:24:47] amen let's read this quote amen pay
[1:24:51] attention to what's happening here now
[1:24:53] at he writes
[1:24:55] she I guess she's sitting here this
[1:24:56] morning now you can tell a lie if the
[1:24:59] person is not
[1:25:00] there but the person is sitting right
[1:25:03] there yes sir he says actually right
[1:25:06] she's sitting here right morning sitting
[1:25:07] right there she was the first one to
[1:25:10] hear this
[1:25:11] testimony she was the first one when she
[1:25:14] when we seen the squirrels she know the
[1:25:17] commission about that and when them
[1:25:20] seven straight times that God created
[1:25:23] something amen
[1:25:29] amen I said now watch what did a agree
[1:25:33] to this is what she agreed to brother
[1:25:35] Bram is giving this testimony about the
[1:25:37] squiddles then he makes the statement
[1:25:39] and he said I said that's the same God
[1:25:42] that could create a ram for Abraham to
[1:25:45] convince him of his commission is the
[1:25:47] same God that can create a squirrel
[1:25:49] because that's what I have need of
[1:25:54] some of you don't need to speak to a
[1:25:55] mountain because that's not what you
[1:25:56] have need of but your need is different
[1:26:00] he's going to answer according to what
[1:26:01] you have need of Amen follow what the
[1:26:04] prophet is saying now he says little
[1:26:06] olti right there sitting in the back of
[1:26:07] the building with a heart off the things
[1:26:10] of the world watch the keys now get you
[1:26:13] out of the things of the world Amen
[1:26:15] she's in the spirit now what brother
[1:26:17] Bram is
[1:26:18] saying she was
[1:26:21] believing if thou can't believe am so
[1:26:24] which means her believing pulled into
[1:26:26] the realm of
[1:26:28] impossibilities brother Brandon there's
[1:26:30] nothing but the
[1:26:32] truth she didn't just say to me from
[1:26:35] here now watch all of us think brother
[1:26:37] Brandon uh that sister actually right
[1:26:38] after this what did I tell you in the
[1:26:40] beginning kept emphasizing God wants to
[1:26:42] find expression through your lips amen
[1:26:45] what does brother Bram say next God
[1:26:48] spoke out of her
[1:26:51] heart Christ in Bri form
[1:26:55] Hallelujah she didn't say it from
[1:26:59] here God spoke oh somebody reading this
[1:27:04] it's in as I was with Moses some of you
[1:27:06] want to go and write it down and see
[1:27:08] maybe you could just wrote this I never
[1:27:10] read this thing
[1:27:13] before I thought only actually WR
[1:27:16] spoke he saying God spoke out of her
[1:27:19] heart what did God use he used the limps
[1:27:27] okay yes it
[1:27:29] 60911 m for morning as I was with Moses
[1:27:32] so I will be with thee paragraph
[1:27:36] 144 to paragraph 145 you're writing
[1:27:40] it she didn't just say it from here God
[1:27:44] spoke out of her
[1:27:47] heart praise the Lord am amen you say
[1:27:51] brother Brandon does that now what watch
[1:27:53] what brother Brandon I'm trying to show
[1:27:54] you now how you need to connect with
[1:27:56] things she connected with a testimony
[1:27:59] and the testimony gave her the desire of
[1:28:01] her heart everybody understand that
[1:28:03] watch why brother Bram talks about
[1:28:05] raising your hand in church
[1:28:06] now brother brandham is telling them to
[1:28:09] raise their hand and he says brother
[1:28:10] Brandon does that mean anything it
[1:28:12] certainly does it means the difference
[1:28:14] between an eternal separation from God
[1:28:17] or an eternal presence of God when you
[1:28:19] raise your hand that means that's
[1:28:21] something in
[1:28:22] you you have power within you to break
[1:28:25] every law of signs break move
[1:28:28] gravitation and something within you
[1:28:30] makes a choice and you stick up your
[1:28:32] hand what does that do that shows an
[1:28:36] acceptance of divine Love Of Christ
[1:28:38] something in you caus you to raise your
[1:28:41] hand so something in at right caus you
[1:28:44] to speak something in you causes you to
[1:28:47] raise your hand i'm trying to show you
[1:28:49] there's a power in you
[1:28:54] yeah I'm just going to give you one more
[1:28:55] example in the mighty conqueror brother
[1:28:58] brandom is designing This Woman's Heart
[1:29:00] she's standing on the stage and because
[1:29:02] she's in this realm of perfect Faith
