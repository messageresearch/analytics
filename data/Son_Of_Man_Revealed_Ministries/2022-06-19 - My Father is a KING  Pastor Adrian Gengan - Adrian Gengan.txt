========================================

come on starts with an s and a h and a u it's a shout out amen the shot of the king must be in the camp amen hallelujah so shout out to the lord with the voice of triumph this morning amen what can we say about our father amen he is indescribable amen when we think about our god and our king look at how we work from in the garden of eden from the fall and look at father's love amen and father will never leave us no forsake us our earthly fathers may leave us and forsake us our earthly fathers may not give us the right provision and they may try to the best of the ability but there's nobody knows our needs like our heavenly father amen and he knows how to supply each need amen he knows what his children desires and he gives to us amen abundantly amen god doesn't give to us sparingly he gives to us abundantly so this morning amen we're happy to be in the house of the lord we want to wish every father a happy father's day amen i'm sure you being spoiled by your children and just you having children is a blessing children are an heritage from the lord amen don't look at our children as creeps as annoying children are an heritage from the lord amen they may walk on your nerves now and again but they are your blessing that the lord is bestowed to you and he says nurture this child train this child in the ways of the lord for who knows one of them might be carrying the gospel of peace amen that can sweep the world amen hallelujah and bring deliverance so happy father's day to you i pray you'll have a blessed day amen and even as we uh go into the word amen we welcome you the prevasion amen let's keep my hand welcome in the house of the lord the first time in the service amen good to see brother thomas rahm and his family back in the house of the lord hallelujah bless the name of jesus amen let's turn to john chapter 8. amen at this time we also remember the spiritual father that has left this church for 40 years amen that has gone on to be with the lord amen we know that his efforts have not gone in vain amen but we stand here as products of their ministry amen products that the grace of the lord has bestowed through that ministry amen so sons have been born in the house sons have been risen up in the house amen just one word of scripture here john 8 and verse 36 says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed amen we read it one more time amen why don't we all read it together if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed it's too basic okay you may be seated amen bless the name of jesus hallelujah bless the name of jesus amen amen so this morning we'll speak our freedom as sons and daughters of the most high god amen and for a title my father is a king amen our freedom as sons and daughters and my father is a king amen we're looking at a time and we're going to take this as a type because we know that god made man but man made slaves amen so to contrast our freedom we got to show you the bondage amen that man oppresses another man amen so god made man to be a ruler of the earth but he never put he never ordained it that one man should dominate and enslave another man it was not god's original idea amen but through the fall we find and through the curse you'll see that no one of noah's sons is cursed amen and then you find that and why we can relate to this is because we have also experienced some sort of slavery as the indians we were brought over to this country as slaves to work in the sugarcane fields amen amen now we look at that we're going to look at maybe and take because the prophet used it of the american black man amen so we find that the dutch that were and colonized africa and you know the dutch are the afrikaners and they started when they couldn't have things to trade with the european countries they started to train men they started to trade slaves for goods and products and that's how they value the life of the african man and once they went they were they were captured and it didn't matter they raised their class but whoever they could capture they captured and in one of their one of the captivities that they were taking and they were going to send these people to the land of the usa remember this was around the 1500s now they were traveling by ship and these people were from africa i don't think they ever enslaved anyone from south africa our guys are too lazy so they say they went to northern africa central africa okay now when they when they capture them we're going to focus on this one family here's a royal household and they capture this boy for some reason they didn't recognize his identity amen and they enslaved him they put amen what do they call it shekels upon their hands and they led them to the ships and when they led him to the ships they were never coming back anymore and from that little tribe from that village they captured this boy and his friends amen and now they were just a bunch of slaves and they were weary and they were going away from home and upon boarding the ship they stripped them of their belongings they chained them and they send them below the dicks amen send them below the decks where life would be a nightmare for them amen and they were forced to remain in this condition for months in that journey across the ocean there was no modern transportation amen and many of these captures remember were never at sea before so they started to get seasick they started to develop all kinds of sicknesses and you remember at that time there wasn't modern medicine so they lived in squalor and in filth and they packed the decks of the ships where they were lined up one against the other they cut them to the post amen it was unbelievably hot at the bottom it was crammed it was suffocating conditions and it was in constant darkness below the deck and they had to endure this for months the men were kept separate from the women and children amen and can you imagine how the spirits were crushed those that died they threw them overboard amen if we can maybe just go to that slideshow amen i'm not sure to give you an history lesson but just in that opening remarks i want you to understand that's how we were trapped in denominationalism when that rider came forth in a deception and he took god's people captive so here it is in the length of 360 years between 1500s and 1860s 1860s 12 million africans we have taken forcibly to the americas amen that the largest forced migration in human history so when they went there let's go to the next slide we just go through this quickly it was the trans and athletic atlantic slave trade so it was triangular because of where they took them from in their locations right let's go can we move quicker on these slides remember this is not my message on these people this is my foundation so you see european vessels took goods to africa where they exchanged for slaves can you imagine if somebody comes and give you goods for your child amen the ships then sail to the americas to trade slaves for agricultural products extracted by slave labor which was sold in europe after the return journey so you can't see too clearly but that's the outline of a ship and where you see those little marks those were humans that were stacked like this can you see there's no room for them to move they have to lay in that condition so if they defecated it was right there there was no toilets for them i don't know if you are extremely interested or awfully bored right now because i'm not getting any response from the people amen or i just shocked at the appalling conditions that people had to endure but what i'm trying to do this morning is to show you the appalling condition the church was in amen [Music] let's go to the next one a quarter of the africans brought to north america came from angola that's where they came from angola while an equal percentage arriving later originated from senegambia over 40 percent of africans entered the us through the port city of charleston brother caleb did i get my power cable for the sound amen [Music] let's go next slide so the earlier slaves now remember i'm focusing on this family this tribal family where they took this boy captive and they took them to the south to work in the cotton fields and the earlier slaves in north america worked on plantation along the southern coast cultivating cash crops like rice and tobacco cotton fields amen so they were taken to the cotton fields to be to work as slaves now some of the conditions that they were working as slaves they were whipped they were forced to work amen brother jeffrey before you said i just want to try the same man i don't want to go into it and then we find that it's not working [Music] they were whipped they were beaten amen they were treated cruelly the woman were raped and the children are disowned amen they disowned them and in this time now period that they were living in you got to remember the time we've got to remember that they didn't have the luxuries that we had for them to even make clothing they had to spin cotton to make fabric and all of these things so they use these people in their fields and they didn't want to use the american man because the american man was too high and mighty to work in the fields so they got these africans to come over and work in the fields amen so under these conditions this one family this family that came from this tribe in africa was sold to this plantation worker and he was put in the fields to work and that old tribe was put in the field to work amen and they were all given tasks but this one boy because he came from the household of the king he carried out his work with diligence though enslaved what allowed him to behave in this condition amen what liberated him from all the slavery that was going around him it was the knowledge of who his father was knowing who our father he is would change the atmosphere amen you can take a boy or a girl who's adopted into a family that boy and girl is never settled till he finds his original father and mother the adopted parents can take care of them as best as he can but they are never at peace because there is something yearning inside of him to know his origins that's why we were never settled in genomic nationalism we were always searching never settled in hinduism but always searching because we knew that that was not our father we were searching amen and if you take this even this boy when you take us we trace our lineage back you gotta go past india come on now if you have to trace your lineage back you gotta go past india yeah yes you gotta go past if this boy was gonna trace himself back he was gonna go past angola and if he started the journey to trace his ancestors and to trace his generations you and i if you both started in that journey both of us would have ended at noaa amen hallelujah but that's not where we were going to stop amen if you go seven generations earlier both of us would have arrived at adam amen but that's not where we originated because we gotta go past adam we gotta go back to the eternities amen where we were taken from the back part of god's mind amen the sea gene of god where we were predestinated and to be unto the adoption of sounds into the back path so you can't even trace our heritage and our existence to genesis only you gotta go past genesis amen amen hallelujah now there's nobody on the earth that can trace the lineage like the believers the bride of jesus christ can trace it amen you find man in the efforts to trace themselves they go and look at an ape or a chimpanzee oh my ancestor yes because his father is the serpent that is why science is proclaiming hey we evolved from eggs yes you did but not me i was created in the image of god amen hallelujah i'm in his image and i'm in his likeness in fact when god looked at me he said hey you are very good amen yes amen amen and after god made man he said you know what my work is complete and it took a whole day to rest so pleased he was with his creation amen so this because this boy knew his identity it changed his thinking in the field brother branham says they didn't have to whip him he just carried out his duties even though the other boys that were taken from his tribe were around him and they were getting whipped and they were getting beaten amen so one day brother branham says he says it was not too far down south from where he was and he knew this this farmer there or this uh owner of this field and he was releasing a story and he said now they were training remember we were talking about how they were trading human beings so now this guy had come to buy another slave for himself he comes into the field and he walks around and he's looking at all now they would want somebody young somebody strong somebody that they can use in the field not somebody feeble and that's what god wants god doesn't want feeble christians god wants rugged christians amen god wants soldiers in the gospel that he can use amen not up one day and down the next day and depressed and sad amen but somebody on fire for god somebody that's not afraid to say lord use me for your glory amen head on amen have we got some of them here this morning say amen hallelujah oh bless the name of jesus it doesn't matter amen if nobody is looking it doesn't matter that you are not getting the accolades but keep pressing on holding up the standard of the kingdom high amen you may be just a mother at home and you may be thinking nobody is taking notice of you i want to speak to the woman a little bit even though it's father's day there's nothing as powerful as a woman a godly woman who can pray amen who can pray for family pray for her husband amen say lord i do not know what demon powers out there along today's journey for him or for my children but lord i'm here on my knees right now and i'm praying for my children lord cover them by your blood i don't know what temptations may come across my husband but i'm praying for him lord keep him covered by your blood can i get some woman to say amen hallelujah some of you are too quiet for me can i help a sister say amen amen oh i can't hear all of you can i hear you say amen this morning amen hallelujah bless the name of jesus don't always find your voice only when you're shouting at the husband or shouting at the children but shout out to god this morning with the voice of triumph hallelujah amen or coming and acting all too many damn quiet in the house of the lord amen but you've got a boisterous voice everywhere else use your voice to give god praise amen [Music] a woman a hallelujah a godly woman is a powerful force to be reckoned with amen she can pray for family she can train her children up in the ways of the lord amen powerful women of god amen amen amen faithful women women of faith amen not women of complaints amen and woman of murmuring hallelujah but holy women of god sacred woman of god holding the virtues of the message of the hour amen holding on to the sacred teachings and the standard of god's word in the faith of later shia hallelujah [Music] amen your life is a testimony amen hallelujah so keep praying for your family keep praying for the church keep praying amen if you can't do anything pray hallelujah oh bless the name of jesus amen don't care now if nobody was looking at this boy in the field but he was shoulders upright walking in the field amen doing his work amen picking the cotton amen doing it like he was doing it for his father himself amen hallelujah amen and we find amen that it was during this time that some of the most beautiful songs were perfect because from an experience of pain comes forth beautiful things and that is why the lord tells us that in his own time he makes all things beautiful you'll find the best paintings the best sculptures the best songs that were written you find the person who wrote it he came from a deep emotional pain and experience that caused him to pin if we wink the ocean filled with the skies of parchment made and i believe he was in a mental asylum they found it written on the walls the love of god he found the love of god amen even the man that was running the ships newton pinned amazing grace how sweet the sound save the wrench like me amen amen when he saw how he was treating those people something spoke to his heart and he said that's not right amen and it's one of the most sound beloved hymns amazing grace amen the slaves the captured slaves used these songs i remember they couldn't communicate to one another in the normal way they were planning escapes they wanted to run away they wanted freedom remember we're speaking about our freedom as sons and daughters and our title is my father is a king they desperately wanted to get out of this bondage because at once they were once free people my mind is cast this morning to malachi chapter four five and six and i've seen so many posters for father's day and they got the scripture father's day celebration service in every denominational church and they're using elijah the prophet they're using malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 and they're using in verse 6 you'll find it he used they love this one here you know where it says fathers to children and out of children to father but they're missing an important part who's going to turn it who's the heat that's not god amen why are they using the scripture if you go back you find out who that he is he says i god is going to send elijah the prophet before the great the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord that's this day and he enlightened the prophet shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children so who are they referencing with this they're ignoring all the other parts because that word says father there because they search now father's day message hey this is it looks like a nice scripture let's see so all your broken homes your father your children are going to be turned back to your fathers and the father's hearts are going to be turned back to the children lying demons do not have the revelation of the scripture repent and receive elijah the prophet and he shall turn your hearts amen amen hallelujah so because they have to talk in cold language they've started to sing spirituals amen like wade in the water hallelujah they started to sing you know negro spirituals they started to sing these songs and it was cold wade in the water means if you if you're running and you flee run in the water so they can't see your tracks and they started to use songs about the exodus because these captive the people who held them captive made them christians so they learnt about moses and the egyptians so they started to sing about that captivity and they started to use it in code language in these songs amen hallelujah hallelujah they started to sing to one another oh songs amen hallelujah some of you may never hear this but i want you to hear it amen [Music] so if you're too lazy you go home and you put youtube for every other thing [Music] wait in the water gods are gonna trouble the water isn't that beautiful why are they walking in the cotton fields [Music] is [Music] amen while they're walking in the cotton fields they were desiring their freedom freedom freedom can you imagine their bondage and their singing for freedom [Music] i'll be buried [Music] because before we be a slave to this mark of the beast we'll be buried in our grave because we will not bow down we will not bear amen hallelujah amen we are going to hold our freedom they can kill us if they want but before we become slaves to the system we'd rather be buried in the grave death is an early exit from this life amen hallelujah people want the quickest exit death is the quickest exit it's an open door the bible says amen hallelujah and they should sing amen i want you to hear this why are they chopping [Music] [Music] [Music] i wanna lie down i'm just showing you these things amen hallelujah and they used to sing amen [Music] but we'll never understand that because maybe our forefathers would understand it but for us you're wondering why this pastor is playing old songs for you this morning but when it comes to the deep experience of pain when you're in bondage you're brothers that have come from denomination and now that you're worshiping in the message of the hour you would know the difference in the freedom of worship amen amen the chains that once held you bound do not hold you bound anymore but you are free amen hallelujah oh bless the name of jesus and the other song that we sing they used to sing swing low sweet chariot coming forth to carry me home amen so these were songs that were birthed from slavery out of the deep pain amen until god arose a man in the 1800s yes sir 100 years before william branham became a man to liberate man from natural slavery and a hundred years later god sent elijah the prophet to liberate man from spiritual slavery amen amen amen and you if you read the story of abraham lincoln it's quite a story i'm not going to go into it but you find how he persisted and though he failed at many attempts at being the president he persisted until he became the president and one of the greatest thing ever signed into law was the proclamation of emancipation let's put that slider amen i want you to see this let's see if you can pick it up amen yeah the one before that president abraham lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation on january 1st 1863 and 100 years later in 1963 came another proclamation of emancipation amen the proclamation declared that all persons there are the slaves within the rebellious states ah and ends forward shall be free now we would think that the proclamation of emancipation would have set all slaves free but not so because they didn't have modern technology like you and i right so the slaves that were working in the field didn't get word that there was an emancipation order the slave owners held back the truth from them denominations held back the truth yes amen amen because created dogmas chain the people that's what brother branham was up against every time he presented the light of the scripture according to the revelation of the hour they took it back to their creed and they were bound by the queen the shackles of the creed and dogma and what their people had been teaching them held them bound and they refused to let go of their teaching and see the light of the open book amen so that didn't free all the slaves only a small number of the country's 4 million slaves were freed immediately amen you will find here's what it says despite the expansive wording the emancipation proclamation was limited in many ways it applied to states that had separated from the union the message of the hour applied to only those that were out of the system that were out of the denominational system it's not that slight it's the next line amen it says here upon leaving it says it applied to states that had separated from the union there was only a few people that left denominations amen leaving slavery untouched in the loyal borders it also expressed exempted parts of the confederacy that had already come under northern control hallelujah amen i don't think you got that there were some states that had come under the northern control and we were already under the northern control because on the sides of the norm there's a king over the city amen there's a king amen hallelujah and now but words started to get around and as they started to understand that the president had signed into order that they could go free more and more of them started to escape and when they knew that sometimes they approached the ranch only and they told them and they knew it was law for them to release them but they told them that at sunrise you can go so what they started to do they started to climb the hill because they didn't want to wait for the sun to come over the mountain so amen hallelujah brother branham says they were climb up a hill amen they were going to be free at sunrise some could climb a little higher than others oh praise the lord they were not set free of paul's day at irena's day at martin's day at luna's day at wesley's day some couldn't climb all the way up to the pyramid amen to see the coming sun to see the rising sun amen hallelujah but you could climb higher amen hallelujah brother branham is saying sam could climb a little higher than the others the older ones couldn't get up yes amen hallelujah paul showed you the mystery but we have seen the shout out amen hallelujah paul wrote about the shot but we are in the shout amen so the ones that got the highest just as soon as they saw the sun peeped up amen glory hallelujah he said we are free amen so the ones amen they started to haul it down to the next group amen hallelujah they started to haul it down to the people that were at the bottom that they had seen the sun and the next one holiday we are free on down the hill passing down the news we are free and every man that sees the sun is free amen amen amen hallelujah amen so we came climbing up amen and our lord jesus amen he climbed above every mountain he climbed above every grave he climbed through the air he climbed beyond the moon beyond the sun he went to another dimension amen and he took that book from the hand of the original owner and he said amen i have come to set my people free and even then revelation 5 they are all wondering and trouble you can see that they are enslaved doesn't revelation 5 sound like they enslaved there's no freedom in their worship right because the strong angel says who is worthy to open the book and they say there is none found worthy we have got a proclamation of emancipation but it is unsigned but they came forth the lamb and it's stripping with blood yes the lamb was dripping with blood he walked forth to the original owner and he signed it with his blood amen amen when he came out of that sanctuary it took that original amen document of our title deed and he signed it with his blood pardon amen hallelujah then heaven must get to work amen hallelujah because the seals have now been broken and the names that were beneath the seals had to be revealed amen and it's not just good enough for the seals to be broken in heaven because that title deed is for man on the earth so god sends a mighty angel down amen in revelation 10 he comes descending amen from heaven clothed with a cloud put up that picture brother caleb amen there's some here may not know what that picture looks like amen but here it is in 1963 our emancipation proclamation and it wasn't done in silence yes sir hallelujah it wasn't done in silence oh praise the lord the bible recorded that when he spoke he wrote like a lion stand it amen yes amen you go read when they when the cloud appeared they said it was like a sonic boom brother branham describes this great blast god was not silent about it they just rejected what he did [Music] amen anytime god's gonna do something on the earth he proclaimed it in the heavens first amen so down comes the mighty angel with the proclamation of emancipation that you can go free amen amen hallelujah and you're gonna hide it inside of you so he asks you to take it and consume it amen you are freedom that's why we should be the happiest bunch of people here there should be people struggling around this place drinking the spirit of god worshiping god because for the first time there's a group of people that are free to worship him amen because he will the son of man is set free is free indeed oh say praise the lord amen hallelujah amen so jesus went above every principality and he ascended above every power he climbed the highest mountain he met and then one day at the rising of the sun in fact it was in the message at the rising of the sun that brother branham comes to announce to the people turn the picture to the right amen turn it to the right oh you skeptic because you the skeptic never saw the picture this way they were viewing it the other way brother branham went and orchestrated and told the jet to go and fly over that place and try to form this thing and also when you cameraman when you're taking it take it the other way so one day 1965 when i'm preaching it is the rising of the sun i'll tell them turn it to the right then he was a brilliant mastermind that he really was a master of all circumstances amen [Music] so we got a new we've got a word for you skeptic shut up amen but he came and he said turn the picture to the right amen and he said can you see his eyes amen he said he's appearing right now hallelujah what is he bringing a message coming forth a message to gather the living saints not kept saying say man together living saying say man to tell you who your father is to tell you that you are not from this world amen hallelujah you may not get along with your earthly father and mother amen but you need to get along with your heavenly father amen god will change your spirit god will change and you give you a new heart amen hallelujah where the holy spirit in you can get along with everybody no matter what they do to you whether they prosecute you whether they'll forsake you whether they say all manner of things against you the holy spirit within you will make you get along with everybody amen that's right amen amen hallelujah in fact one time now we're talking about the proclamation that went forth to sound that they were free but then we had some johnny crows and in this farm now they captured a little crow because the farmer said i'm going to show these clothes a lesson they're coming to destroy my crop so he caught one of the crows and he tied it to a post and the crow could fly away so every time the other crows saw this guy trapped jail they stayed away from the field amen and all the other crows will fly over and say come on johnny crow let's go south the storm and winter is coming and johnny crow would try to crawl and he could not he's tired so one day there was a kind of person going by he says oh poor crow lying dead half starved to death amen couldn't hardly get up he said i felt sorry for that poor bird so he goes over and he cuts the band and lets the crow loose but he's been bound so long till he thought he was tired because every time he tried to run and take off that string pulled him back and he became so conditioned that he knew exactly where to go before he could feel the joke of that string and he never even though the band was cut he never dared to go past that mark amen and the crows would go hollering amen and say come on johnny crow it's winter time let's go south and johnny would say i can't because i'm bound every time you go past them and you tell them acts 2 38 baptism they say i can't matthew 28 yeah amen every time you show them elijah the prophet they tell you the prophets were unto john they lie you know what they like if they saying that the prophets were unto john who was jesus was he not a prophet yes amen didn't the bible say the lord himself will raise a prophet like unto moses was that referencing jesus you see these lying demons [Music] jesus won't contradict himself amen so you tell him i'm bound but he was free yet he didn't know that he was free maybe the shame here this morning that don't know that you are free that you can sow into the heavenlies and you can live above the level that you are living right now you can sow into the blessings of the lamb amen into the blessings of the holy spirit maybe you're living a life of dehydration and life amen will your malnutrition but in the land of the holy ghost amen amen is life more abundant amen hallelujah so we ask you to come up a little higher this morning amen and when he had got through reading amen now the prophet is saying here he's typing jesus now and he says yeah when jesus had finished reading the scripture you remember they gave him the scroll he says this day the scripture is fulfilled in your years he says you see it for he was giving forth the warning of the coming forth of the great gasher of pentecost to sit at liberty everyone that was slaves to sin and bound now at the going forth of this jubilee here remember jesus said i've come to proclaim the acceptable here the acceptable year is the jubilee year it was to be sounded throughout all the lands a trumpet was to sound and this trumpet would make a distinction the trumpet was the 50th year sound and every slave that had been bought or become poor could not care for his own he had fell beneath the load and his master his death he had bought him and placed him into the field as a slave and he had to serve him for he was too poor to redeem himself now the prophet says remember you are one time slaves yourself and down in egypt and i have freed you therefore at the sounding of the trumpet every slave no matter how long you've been in or how short a time is that liberty to return to his family you are at liberty to return because malachi 4 has come he has come to turn you back to your family at pentecost amen hallelujah if pentecost had to be resurrected i'm talking about peter and the disciples and the people that were caught up in the upper room some of us would be offended that they worship some of us would think they had a bunch of radicals an emotional worker but these men were not drunk they were filled with the holy ghost when you sit in the in the seat of the scornful and in the seat of the critic like brother branham did one time but when he said what has she got that i don't have and then he said before he knows it his foot started tapping don't try to stop the tapping off your foot when you feel the spirit move let the spirit move don't care what the person next to me might say you tell them give me a little space can i get a little social distancing so that i can praise my god amen amen hallelujah tired of stiff starchy amen worship by the worship of freedom amen our proclamation of emancipation has come amen hallelujah amen he says we poor aliens nothing we could do in 57 if we could if we kept the sabbath every new man quit eating meat if we kept all kinds of days kinds of religious sacrifice isn't that tedious to follow the traditions of denominations amen every january daniel fast lens tedious when they having daniel fast you having daniel feast hey they're going home and eating herbs there's telling eagles don't eat herbs amen tell them we left egypt that's why they eat herbs every january they're celebrating their goshen the eating herbs you see the type [Music] they're still waiting for their proclamation of emancipation he says our parents sold us out yes they did our parents sold us out not our parents now talking about the generations that have gone on jf rollins what's this other guy at dome what's his name fred roberts someone who's scared to mention his name because at one time he's a spiritual father was your adopted spiritual father amen your true father is the holy spirit amen he says here our parents sold us out to sin amen we are laden under the bonds of sin as a slave to sin we were born in sin shaped in inquity came into the world speaking lies there nothing we can do to help ourselves because our own makeup our own nature everything we are is sin he says but when jubilee time come that we are free amen and the trumpet is the gospel the good news the trumpet was the gospel then good news you are no longer bound you no longer have to live in sin you can go home and be set free you don't owe any debts at all please don't stop paying your edges account and tell them end of the month jesus paid it all hey you know they have that spot bottom of the slip there please reply don't go right there jesus paid it all we're going to blacklist you brother branham also teaches us that a good christian page is dead amen the old emancipation or proclamation is then signed and you are free so when a man hears the

hear the good news of the trumpet the worldly pleasures seem so little that's a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol you don't need it no more so much greater is this news than the whole boundaries of slavery the old marks of sin that caused you to be petty i wretched by smoking cigarettes alcoholics on the streets with trembling you don't have to be that way the gospel trumpet is astounding whosoever will let him come and drink from the waters or fountains of life now this is where we're getting to here now so not everyone accepted the gospel trumpet sound and the prophet says to reject that if a man says i want to stay the way i am i don't want to go i just want to stay right here so even in the in the field he was a slave he says that man was taken to the temple with his slave master he must put his here against a post and all was brought in his hair and it was a sign that he could never be free amen he had to serve his master as long as he lived because he rejected the news of the good news if that isn't a perfect type of the marking of the beast the good news is the gospel to reject to hear the gospel your ears is sealed up that you always call it fanaticism and there's nothing to it and you'll be serving sin in forms of godliness as long as you live no matter how religious you are you are sealed off from the presence of god he says the emancipation of

prison houses but man always has long to see the other side and any little thing that looks a little supernatural that human being will run for it to see how they flock for these meetings he says anything that looks like the supernatural the human side will run for it because it's some sort of promise across the border just across the lane but what makes him do that is because he is created in the image of his maker almighty god he is created to be a worshiper of god and he must find some place to give an outlet to that feeling so don't suppress the feeling if you feel like shouting
