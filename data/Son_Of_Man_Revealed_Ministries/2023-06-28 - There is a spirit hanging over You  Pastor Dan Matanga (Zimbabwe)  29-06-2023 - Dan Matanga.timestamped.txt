[3:41] messages amen and what what did he give
[3:44] us the key he says if you can't even
[3:45] have faith for your healing how are you
[3:47] going to have faith for Rapture so when
[3:49] it comes to healing and all of our needs
[3:51] in our lives amen we ought to take

[10:02] part of the tensile for
[10:04] inviting me to Durban that we can come
[10:07] and be Hallelujah yes amen
[10:10] for that amen I believe we are gathered
[10:14] here for nothing else but the way amen
[10:16] hallelujah that is real and it is true
[10:19] and we know for sure
[10:22] as he Progress way into towards the
[10:26] rapture
[10:27] more and more
[10:29] days of men are over amen yes Lord takes
[10:33] up
[10:34] and he moves it on yes through these
[10:37] vessels amen you go back and see that
[10:41] going to the days of Moses and his
[10:44] ministry
[10:45] to start with it was a one-man band
[10:48] Ministry because as a prophet he was
[10:51] trying to demonstrate and to show
[10:53] something
[10:54] and when he moves of the sin
[10:57] you see that it no longer moves on as a
[11:00] one-man band Ministry yes but now you
[11:03] begin to see Joshua now in the rest of
[11:06] the people you know going around the
[11:09] walls of Jericho yes all those other
[11:11] people Everyone is involved amen and you
[11:14] see we have had a prophet who has come
[11:16] and gone he has played his role but he's
[11:19] given this message
[11:21] like the word says you know this this
[11:26] sign shall follow them amen now it's God
[11:30] now through the believer yes we're doing
[11:32] it and he said the signs shall follow
[11:35] them that day Hallelujah is is the signs
[11:39] that follow yes it's not as that man yes
[11:43] we are not sign Seekers but we we are
[11:46] followed by some amen actually it's not
[11:48] us being followed by the sign whenever
[11:51] the word is preached yes
[11:54] amen because it's it's the word the
[11:58] demonstration of his power absolutely
[12:00] amen you find that we have gathered
[12:03] around this message with this hour
[12:05] that's why you see the prophet it was it
[12:08] was Supernatural yes it was Supernatural
[12:11] you you cannot when once it's just the
[12:13] word it accomplishes amen it fulfills us
[12:16] but there is something that follows it
[12:18] yes there is something that follows it
[12:20] like you hear the talk about brother
[12:22] Branham says now when you will come for
[12:25] says maybe entering through the door
[12:26] there the back he says the moment he
[12:28] came in it looks like there is something
[12:31] that ended in with him
[12:33] something that came with that that was a
[12:36] company here now that's something that's
[12:38] beyond human yes that's something Beyond
[12:41] imagination yes it's something that's
[12:43] real amen something that comes out of
[12:46] that word that accompanied the preaching
[12:49] of that word and when it comes my
[12:51] brother my sister there is no doubt
[12:53] whatsoever that Anything Can Happen amen
[12:56] yes thank you
[12:59] that we are identified with such a
[13:01] message in this end time amen whereby is
[13:05] self-proclaiming itself
[13:08] manifesting amen that's what it is yes
[13:11] the touch of the supernatural accompanz
[13:14] it he says no no church can survive no
[13:17] individual can survive without that
[13:20] touch of the supernatural
[13:21] God in his word
[13:24] that things begin to manifest amen so we
[13:27] have such a great and a big message that
[13:30] we are so privileged to believe that we
[13:33] have nothing to fear we have everything
[13:35] to believe and it proclaims itself amen
[13:39] it proclaims itself through our lives
[13:41] proclaims himself through the preaching
[13:43] of the world and everything and
[13:44] everything now it moves from being a
[13:46] theoretical message but it goes to be a
[13:49] real message so you find that the
[13:52] message is not only Theory but the
[13:54] message is life amen
[13:57] practicality of Life absolutely so
[14:00] that's that's the highest distance now
[14:02] or the longest distance for the message
[14:04] to move from here right into the heart
[14:07] and then it moves into the heart it
[14:09] begins to produce a life and the lies is
[14:12] what is very very important amen Jesus
[14:15] was that small man was a man of few
[14:18] words
[14:19] but you know what really mattered uh in
[14:23] his life was a a is a life yes that's
[14:27] why whenever you would move around and
[14:29] talk around that life is what affected
[14:32] the people it was it was it was not so
[14:35] much of the words he said but the life
[14:37] that followed the few words or whatever
[14:40] he said is the life amen so we believe
[14:43] we are coming into that stage also or we
[14:46] are entering or we have ended that stage
[14:48] where the life of the message the life
[14:50] of the word is reproducing itself
[14:53] through the Believers amen do you
[14:55] believe that tonight
[14:59] now tonight I want to just preach a
[15:02] little short short message here
[15:05] Maybe
[15:06] where we look at
[15:09] uh Isaiah 53 verse 5.
[15:15] Isaiah 53 verse 5.
[15:19] and Mark 11
[15:20] 22-26. Hallelujah Isaacs uh Isaiah 53 5
[15:25] reads but he was wounded for
[15:27] transgressions he was bruised for
[15:29] iniquities such as ties made of our
[15:31] peace was upon him
[15:33] and with his stripes we are amen those
[15:38] stripes
[15:39] we are we are delivered whatever
[15:43] Ephesians 6 12 for we wrestle not
[15:46] against flesh and blood but I give his
[15:48] principalities against Powers against
[15:50] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[15:52] against spiritual wickedness in high
[15:56] places
[16:00] glory and Jesus entering Satan to them
[16:03] have faith in God Amen for very lie send
[16:05] to you the whole whosoever shall say
[16:08] unto this mountain whatsoever not the
[16:11] pastor not the preacher not the Deacon
[16:13] not the Elder only even the sister even
[16:16] the brother even young men whoever
[16:19] whosoever shall say now when the Bible
[16:22] say whosoever it means you can be placed
[16:24] right in there yes yes you say brother
[16:26] sorry and so if he shall say yes unto
[16:29] this mountain be thou removed and be
[16:31] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[16:33] doubt is the heart but shall believe
[16:35] that those things which he saved shall
[16:37] come to pass you shall have whatsoever
[16:41] [Music]
[16:42] I want you to watch that scripture is
[16:44] concentrating on whosoever yeah and
[16:48] he shall whatever he shall say it shall
[16:51] come to pass amen
[16:53] it's you you you you you so the ministry
[16:57] is condescending being God from being
[17:01] the prophets from being the preachers it
[17:03] comes down to the you yes the aim to
[17:06] this one if you shall pray Hallelujah
[17:09] and believe what you say yes pray for
[17:11] amen thank you Lord and you shall say
[17:14] Amen it shall be grounded so it's no
[17:18] longer what the pastor shall say yes
[17:20] it's no longer what the Elder shall say
[17:22] but if you shall say Amen you are the
[17:26] whosoever
[17:29] thank you Lord
[17:35] I can't get him where is he whosoever
[17:38] shall say
[17:40] amen and the ministry has moved through
[17:43] all times and through all stages and so
[17:46] it's now playing around the mouth
[17:50] this dangerous member yeah which can be
[17:54] a blessing and can be really bring
[17:56] Terrible Things yes that's where that's
[17:59] where it is playing around there if you
[18:01] shall Say Amen
[18:03] you cannot say without a mouth without a
[18:06] tongue if you shall say yes it's you to
[18:09] say it so it's come down to you amen
[18:13] amen you cannot blame anyone else
[18:17] amen God

[18:43] have them so where do I come in as a
[18:46] preacher yes
[18:48] yes Amen in other words it
[18:50] down to
[18:52] the responsibilities upon you so as
[18:55] preachers we are coming to equip you
[18:57] amen with what you are supposed to know
[19:01] man what you are supposed to believe
[19:03] what God is supposed to do through you
[19:06] it's you you you you absolutely
[19:20] it's you the issue is with you yeah if
[19:27] you shall say
[19:30] whatever things you desire yes When you
[19:35] pray
[19:37] you receive them and you shall have them
[19:41] amen that's for that brother that's what
[19:43] that brother that so that brother that's
[19:46] what that sister that sister and we come
[19:48] together with such a revelation and
[19:51] understanding the whole church will be
[19:53] on fire
[19:55] Hallelujah
[19:57] you are saying you are believing yes
[20:00] it's happening that one is saying it's
[20:03] believing and is happening so when you
[20:06] get together brother there is trouble
[20:08] for the devil Hallelujah do you believe
[20:11] that my brother my sister
[20:16] I want to title this message I pick it
[20:18] up from a message that the prophet
[20:21] preached now I want to title this
[20:24] message there is a spirit hanging over
[20:26] you yes
[20:29] have you ever wondered you come to
[20:31] church the word is grish you believe it
[20:34] you say as soon as I move on to this
[20:36] church all things are over now it's okay
[20:39] no more but you are back home you are
[20:43] taking the rat
[20:45] yes next service you're coming but Lord
[20:48] but why but why but why but why
[20:56] so as the prophet says the duty of the
[20:58] ministers he says is to cut the links
[21:01] amen
[21:03] with you of that Spirit yes that you are
[21:06] free yeah yeah then you are able to
[21:08] receive what is yours
[21:11] amen glory
[21:12] that's why we don't receive because
[21:14] there is something offering and hanging
[21:16] over us amen but the preacher man's
[21:18] duties he comes is cutting the limbs
[21:20] yeah he is he is evicting that enemy
[21:23] until you are free to be able to receive
[21:29] no
[21:32] with your thoughts it's already done
[21:34] amen hallelujah why can't you have it
[21:40] the person was caught in here it's in
[21:42] one of my quotations he says now we're
[21:45] not saved to the day we can yes we're
[21:48] not served we were not saved maybe the
[21:51] day we we had the message amen it's two
[21:54] thousand years ago glorious amen but we
[21:57] believed maybe two years ago or five
[22:00] years ago or ten years ago that's when
[22:02] we believed it but we were saved
[22:06] amen so he says by my stripes are you
[22:10] healed you were already healed
[22:13] but it's waiting for you to believe it
[22:18] the Holy Ghost is rightfully there for
[22:21] you but it's waiting for you to believe
[22:24] it and reach out and receive it amen
[22:26] amen your deliverance was paid down
[22:29] forth absolutely it's already yours amen
[22:33] but he's waiting for you to believe amen
[22:36] amen it's like when you came in the
[22:37] message I believe the message without
[22:39] yeah your friends could not believe you
[22:41] that are you you know you you're a
[22:43] drunkard we know you will go for drugs
[22:46] together you say but I'm now a Believer
[22:48] amen they were doubting you and when you
[22:51] continue to confess it I believe it oh
[22:54] yes we can see now that brother that
[22:56] that guy is now a Believer it's when you
[22:59] study to believe but otherwise it's
[23:02] already done for you
[23:04] amen
[23:17] so we see right there
[23:19] will wrestle not against flesh and blood
[23:22] but against principalities against
[23:23] Powers against the rulers of darkness in
[23:25] this world against spiritual wickedness
[23:28] in high places yes brother we are
[23:30] wrestling you know what the wrestler is
[23:32] it's a battle amen it's a fight yes of
[23:36] whoever is going to win it then he takes
[23:38] a a higher post amen over the world who
[23:41] has lost the battle so ours is a battle
[23:44] yes it's a lesson amen if you've ever
[23:47] watch some wrestling what they do those
[23:49] guys are serious yes
[23:51] if it gets you put you under his armpit
[23:54] he begins to hit you it begins to harm
[23:56] you if he takes you down he begins to
[23:59] just give you a hard time yes
[24:01] yes so it's a question of who
[24:05] wins over the other yes and that's the

[31:26] in the world that could not allow
[31:28] spirits to be there
[31:29] and close by to a farmers with their
[31:32] equipment making a lot of noise so they
[31:35] were prohibited factors yeah
[31:39] to be there
[31:41] but when God comes he bypasses all
[31:44] procedures Hallelujah he bypasses all
[31:48] circumstances he bypasses all situations
[31:51] like Sarah who was so old Beyond
[31:55] menopause she could not have a child but

[32:01] all procedures
[32:03] there was an age sector
[32:07] at that age you could not be able to
[32:09] have a chance

[32:19] having the nurse that the doctor wrote
[32:20] that this disease will take your life

[32:28] procedures
[32:29] maybe you're up for an operation but I
[32:33] tell you there is a possibility that
[32:35] before that Operation God will have
[32:37] carried out a supernatural operation and
[32:41] by the time you go there they will tell
[32:44] you we cannot we cannot identify where
[32:47] the cyst is
[32:49] no longer there where has it gone to God
[32:53] bypassing procedure
[32:55] [Applause]
[32:57] Christ
[33:00] when there was no wine
[33:02] because now the wine is finished and he
[33:05] says bring some water and right there he
[33:08] took that water and when he took that
[33:10] water he placed that water and that
[33:13] water literally became wine yes he says
[33:17] Jesus bypassed all procedures he was
[33:20] supposed to have grapes and from grapes
[33:23] then you have water and then you
[33:27] but he just piped us all the procedures
[33:30] and water was taken to wine
[33:35] and one time he just took from maybe one
[33:40] piece of bread and you broke it broke it
[33:43] broke it broke it broke it yeah it was
[33:46] in the process from wheat yeah for you
[33:50] to end up with bread amen but it just
[33:51] kept on breaking
[33:53] man and summer what was breaking never
[33:54] got finished yeah but he was multiplying
[33:57] it brother he was bypassing procedure
[34:00] and tonight also pop can bypass
[34:04] procedure Hallelujah
[34:09] man you want to get married but you look
[34:12] around the church there is no one to

[34:16] there is no one to marry you and my
[34:18] brother my sister you wonder who is
[34:20] going to marry me but God can bypass
[34:22] procedure from nowhere God can bring
[34:25] somebody
[34:28] Glory
[34:29] some 15 20 years ago I was preaching in
[34:32] another country called Holland
[34:33] Netherlands
[34:34] then I didn't know what was happening
[34:36] and then there was a sister at the back
[34:38] there she is the operator she was
[34:39] operating the sound system I didn't even
[34:42] know she was a medical doctor I said oh
[34:44] maybe sister you might you are very
[34:45] worried you don't know where your
[34:48] husband will come will come from but I
[34:50] tell you don't know by believing the
[34:52] word
[34:53] after this Silence of after this sermon
[34:55] maybe some brother from some country
[34:58] will come and approach the person they
[35:00] don't want to marry this sister brother
[35:02] when we left it we went the pastor full
[35:04] to say you know what it didn't take a
[35:07] few months somebody came from Germany he
[35:09] says I want to marry this sister oh my
[35:11] brother
[35:12] [Applause]
[35:13] I pass this procedure
[35:16] [Applause]
[35:18] procedure let them stop process amen
[35:22] procedure makes it impossible
[35:26] procedure makes it costly but when God
[35:30] bypasses procedure my brother he becomes
[35:33] reasonably

[35:38] where you were supposed to pray for an
[35:39] operation fourteen thousand then you pay
[35:42] nothing my brother you just say amen and

[36:02] amen you have to confess that you have
[36:05] to say that so that the high priest will
[36:07] take your confession and make it right
[36:10] before God Amen but for men of us God
[36:13] has nothing to confess because we always
[36:15] memoring we are always complaining but
[36:18] we have something positive to take

[36:21] the high priest amen

[1:12:45] there was a church being dedicated some
[1:12:48] three 300 kilometers of 100 kilometers

[1:12:53] go there and preach on the dedication
[1:12:55] day so we're there there were lots of
[1:12:57] people thousands yeah ministers we
[1:13:01] were over 100. so this is from another

[1:14:38] there and then the parts of the places
[1:14:40] Pastor can you just pray for this sister
[1:14:42] and her husband because they haven't had
[1:14:44] a child so and then the sister was
[1:14:47] saying I just agreed towards my pastor
[1:14:51] say because my husband was not there but
[1:14:54] as for me I already received yes amen
[1:14:58] and I just did it for my husband

[1:15:07] gynecologist and the gynecologist I told
[1:15:09] them it's very difficult for you to have
[1:15:11] a child
[1:15:12] she had been going there for years
[1:15:15] and then she went to gynecologist she
[1:15:17] tested positive

[1:24:22] glorifying you help me dear father to
[1:24:24] have faith to make this power to live
[1:24:27] that's a preacher standing behind the
[1:24:30] pulpit as you preach the word you are
[1:24:33] trying to equip them yes
[1:24:35] you are trying them to make them receive
[1:24:38] and believe
[1:24:39] and you are savoring that power
[1:24:42] cutting it off by the power of the holy
[1:24:45] spirit amen that they can be able to

[1:25:10] I said how demon of Oppression
[1:25:13] that's binding our system
[1:25:15] in the name of the son of God Jesus
[1:25:17] Christ leave the woman come out of it
[1:25:21] of operation there are many people these
[1:25:23] days who are oppressed yes yes like it
[1:25:26] is Zimbabwe because of the economy
[1:25:27] people are under oppression I was
[1:25:30] telling my Zimbabwean Brothers there
[1:25:32] before they came here they were you know
[1:25:34] in our church those three brothers
[1:25:36] sister and two brothers
[1:25:38] I was telling them when you go to church
[1:25:40] as a person you have to Crave them first
[1:25:43] yeah to bring them up put them up from a
[1:25:46] pit to level whereby now you can say now
[1:25:49] now we are in church yes because life is
[1:25:53] tough yeah
[1:25:55] you can't get enough to go and burn
[1:26:00] you buy a loaf of bread for 12 000
[1:26:02] symptoms 12 000
[1:26:05] 12 000 you buy a loaf of bread yeah
[1:26:09] and yet you end your enemy may be you
[1:26:11] any 150 150 is in my state of the
[1:26:14] teacher ends forty five thousand so it's
[1:26:16] it's not even enough to buy bread for
[1:26:18] for a week
[1:26:21] so you see people are oppressed
[1:26:27] you find the world today people are so
[1:26:29] uncertain about the future yes they
[1:26:32] don't know what will happen if Russia
[1:26:34] maybe will throw a boat if the squeeze
[1:26:36] comes then they'll press
[1:26:41] that demons
