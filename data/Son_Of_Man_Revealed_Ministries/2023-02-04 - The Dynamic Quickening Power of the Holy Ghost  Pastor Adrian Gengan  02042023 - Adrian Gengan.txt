Holy Ghost amen this will be my Easter message saying that they will not give me an opportunity to preach at the convention this morning will be my Easter message the quickening dynamic power of the Holy Ghost amen let's turn to John Chapter 2 and verse 19. Hallelujah John chapter 2 verse 19. and Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up amen I personal pronoun will raise it up those were not ordinary words how many of you can make that statement destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up so there to be something special about Jesus to make such a boast amen let's turn to Revelation chapter 1 verse 17. the Apostle John is seeing Jesus in heaven and he says and when I saw him so that's Revelation 1 verse 17 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead now he walked to Jesus for three years he didn't feel that way but he sees him in heaven and he says I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen so you see amen is scriptural you see even in the Bible they wrote amen so you're allowed to say amen amen I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death amen one more proportion of scripture in Romans chapter 8 verse 11. Romans chapter 8 verse 11 very familiar portion of scripture it's the one we can go down to the Grave with because of the quickening power that lays in the Scripture it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you is a Spirit dwelling in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen may the Lord the blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen the chain and if you can pull up the message it is the rising of the Sun and I'll give you the different paragraphs as we go through it in Memphis we'll just be touching that one sermon this morning amen hallelujah so the dynamic quickening power of the Holy Spirit amen we just read where our lord Jesus made a boast that you destroyed this Temple and in three days I will raise it up amen now there's many men on the earth that may have suffered may have died may have given their lives you know many men we even have men in our country that were sacrificial with their lives amen look at our ex-president Nelson Mandela they suffered and they gave their lives for real good causes but there was never one that could raise himself again like our lord Jesus did two thousand years ago amen nobody amen even you can't raise yourself up we've got to rely on the dynamic quickening power of the Holy Ghost if we go to the Grave without the Holy Ghost there's no Resurrection for us amen so this we know is the greatest week in all of history amen the greatest celebration of all times is to prove where what he said came to pass because any man can make a boast but he is to prove what he said when he said destroy this Temple and in three days I'm gonna raise it up again amen so that word we know that I'm alive or quick and the word Quicken means made alive after death amen to be made alive after death and this morning you and I sit in the presence of God as benefactors of the Resurrection amen if Jesus didn't rise again you and I would go to the Grave with no hope amen amen the end of this life would be that just there at the End Amen but we find for the believer amen it's not the end it's just the beginning it may be the end of this Temple pistols amen but we go into glorious Realm of the sixth Dimension we go into our fear of any body we experience another Rhythm people don't know of this but the prophet says Dynamic power struck him in the room one day and took him beyond the curtain of time amen nobody else on the face of the Earth has this revelation that we're going to tear off in your body a young body a body that doesn't eat that doesn't sleep amen amen Hallelujah so we find here amen like the prophet he's saying how how are we going to be quickened he says like the first day when the Lord says let there be light and that light struck the Earth and brother Branham says that when he said let there be he says there were seeds laying in the Earth but he needed the sunlight to strike the seed amen hallelujah what did it that Dynamic power and to strike the seed and he says there was light and it amen everything that covered the waters amen even though it covered the waters it was laying there dark dismal gloomy atmosphere but the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen and God had a reason to do that for beneath and Waters we said was seed amen hallelujah and he says in this time when the Glorious light of the message of the owl begins to strike the Earth seeds that are laying in the Earth Sons and Daughters see that's laying within you if you trace back your life at one time you had no Awakening that you were a son and daughter of God you are living your life but one day the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit struck your heart got your attention amen call you to deeper and higher things amen what is it you heard from your theophany amen hallelujah yes amen so that day amen we find amen this that day that first day can you imagine the first sunrise what a glorious thing it must have been when the Lord created the Sun and the Moon and the Lord saw that first Sunrise it must have been a glorious day amen everything was functioning according to its Eden Beauty amen hallelujah and we take this time now we're talking about we want to focus more on the resurrection amen we find that Sunday morning Sunday morning the Believers now let's picture ourselves in the church amen let's picture ourselves in that church for a moment we should never come to Jesus with preconceived ideas that's how these three women were approaching the tomb coming to Jesus with a preconceived idea that he was dead in the Tomb they had forgotten three years of teaching that his very purpose was to lay his life down so they were coming to Jesus based on their own idea based on their own feelings and based on their own ambitions the feeling was gloomy they were still sad in fact they were fearful and at least this woman had some courage to come to the tomb you couldn't find the disciples anywhere they were hiding fearful of their lives amen not expecting the promise because before the our lord Jesus was crucified them he told them he would rise on the third day but the disciples who heard the word didn't understand the word all right yes physically they heard the words coming out of Jesus mouth even the scribes of Pharisees all heard the words and they said we took 40 years to build his Temple what are you talking about so they heard the word hearing the word alone is not good enough you've got to believe the word the word is going to take root in your heart and you've got to wait for the expectation amen and the disciples being under expectation oh they wouldn't have been able to sleep Saturday night there would have been an anticipation they would have camped outside their tomb amen hallelujah waiting for the Glorious resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ now don't don't look down on them because the Lord has given us a promise of a body change the Lord has given us a promise of a resurrection of the sleeping Saints how are we preparing what's our expectation have we gone into a land and we become fearful have we just become accustomed to latest here and the cares of this life warmers go to work provide for my family come home amen what's our preparation what's our expectation let me tell you one time the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost comes upon you amen that will be your only conviction that will be your only purpose amen preparing for the body change you work your entire life around that amen hallelujah and you don't blame them you don't blame the scribes the Pharisees you don't blame the disciples because they had never seen this kind of a man before this was a God man amen I mean they never heard somebody say I'm gonna put me in the ground I'll Raise Myself up again this was foreign to them they never heard about it before so for them to believe it would have taken perfect Faith but they didn't have perfect Faith at that time they wasn't accustomed to this kind of man they were accustomed to a fallen man they were accustomed to man sinning you're taking a lamb slay it to make an atonement for that man amen they had seen glimpses of the powers with the prophets they had seen glimpses of the power through Moses through Elijah and through all the prophets but they had never seen a man operate in authority of heaven where he could stand and say peace be still he could speak to the winds and the waves and they would obey him a blind man who had no eyeballs amen Jesus spits into the ground takes a bit of mind and he puts it on there and the man I borrow the Creator they've never seen this kind of a man amen hallelujah they brought a dead man before Jesus one time and he raised him back to life again amen and they even testified never a man speak like this man Hallelujah and I want to say his bride has his potentials never a woman speaks like this woman with such Faith with such Authority for such purpose you speak as if you know the Redemption plan of God Amen you speak as if you know it's better amen the thoughts in the back part of his mind amen never a woman speak like this I've seen all seven Church Angels speak amen but never a woman amen speak like this bride of Jesus Christ are you a part of that party this morning give God praise amen [Applause] bring many many men hallelujah amen what was the expectation at that time they were looking for a man to come in on the scene and rescue them and deliver them from the Roman rule that's right they were expecting a similar Exodus to the first like how Moses LED them out of the Egyptian rule they were looking for Jesus to lead them out of the Roman rule amen but this was not the first Exodus this was another time this was another season catch this now God may have called you but you've got to wait for your time and season amen Moses was called he was living in Egypt all the time but when the right time and season came around the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost put that word in his heart and he quickened to that word Joshua and Caleb were there right there in Egypt but they didn't move out of season they didn't move out of time amen they supported Moses all the way amen these were young men these were able men amen sometimes they had to hold up the hands of Moses a weary Prophet a tired Prophet but they knew their Ministry and they subjected themselves under the ministry of Moses but when the right time and season came around amen the dynamic power comes upon them amen and they step into their position amen Hallelujah amen this is not at the church ages this is the time The Church Must arise to a potential this is the time you must arise to everything that God called you to be amen not be a lukewarm Christian you need to be a fire Christian amen Hallelujah amen and you know what it is sometimes we don't we think oh we just need to wait for the big situations to ask and speak no you speak over the minute situation you speak over the smallest situation amen start to exercise your faith nobody builds muscles Faith muscles natural muscles by picking up the heaviest of Weights you stop small amen you start to speak amen daily you start to speak situations you start to speak to your problems you start to speak to your circumstances not only yours but to others around you you ought to be a sphere of influence that everyone that comes under your atmosphere amen is changed he's healed he's delivered that's what the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost can do amen amen yes amen don't leave people miserable when they leave your presence yeah you tell them all your problems day like oh let me take this fellow's burden and go with me amen when they leave you they must feel energized they must be revived amen amen Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost that's what we need that's what we have amen amen amen but I tell you some of us just get into the lab tomorrow's Monday and you watch How we'll switch amen hallelujah amen so this Exodus was going to be a spiritual Exodus amen with the price of the Redemption of man fully paid the other Exodus had a temporal lamb but this Exodus would produce the original lamb amen that was slain in the back part of God's mind amen man was going to be filled with the Holy Ghost which would Empower him again and put the supernatural element back into man without the Holy Ghost there's no Supernatural element to us amen I'm going to speak quickly about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you know they drew them and those three types amen The Body Soul and Spirit that they threw into the fiery furnace amen but yeah the king testifies I see one who's the man in the furnace amen who's the man in the furnace he says he has the appearance like the son of God amen I want to bring that up now and further their thoughts amen you are made of a body spirit and soul but even science don't know that you have a soul science will not testify that you have a soul amen some of them believe that they have a spirit some don't write me no scientists are confused they'll go as fast as far as much as maybe saying yes you have a body and you have a spirit but most of them go with the mind only that the intellect is in the mind and that's what governs you right but my thought is this you are Body Spirit and soul but there's a supernatural specie on the face of the Earth a very small amount of people that is just not a three-part being amen the man is in you it's the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost there's only one class of people like that and it's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ God that have been filled with the power of the Holy Ghost not only do I have Body Spirit and soul but I have the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen let's go back to our thought on these disciples now they they were fearful because they saw the Lord whipped Church they whipped our Lord dispatch on him they pulled his beard they slept in and they said prophesy who slept you they took him to a pool they tied him to the pool and they whipped him I don't know if you know how many times amen they whipped him they whipped him till his flesh hung on him they beat him they saw the blood they saw the agony they saw and carried a cross is here so better than beating and Bruce was this lamb that he could barely carry that cross then he stumbled and they had to get a mad Simon to help him Carry the Cross amen they saw the pain and the experience and they saw the humanity of Jesus and they were driven to Despair and helplessness when they saw him die that day on their cross you know when you operate in the natural nobody gave them used the temple something is taking place in the temple this earthquake this darkness in the middle of the day nothing got a hold of them why is there an earthquake why is there darkness in the middle of the day why did the temple veil be torn into from top to bottom nothing triggered within them yet it was transpiring the mercies hit came in plain view something none of them had seen beside the high priest but now anyone who went into the temple could see it why because of the one hanging on the cross amen amen so he said had they believed they would have gone and waited at the Tomb in anticipation on the third day they would have been waiting with a royal robe they would have been waiting with songs of Jubilation and shouts of Joy if you thought the the celebration amen I think today is today Palm Sunday probably right we're not Catholics we don't normally follow those things amen I mean if you're doing Lent just shaking amen if you thought the celebration or Palm leaves or something this would have been a bigger celebration amen you know the prophet says crosses my mind now he says if the Lord told me tomorrow that somebody was going to raise up from the dead he said I would call everyone I would call the news outlets I would call everyone because I have blessed the Lord and I will say that saved the Lord this brother is going to rise up that's what they should have done and they moved by faith but Jesus told Peter you know what you're gonna run like a coward you're gonna run amen you know what they should have known that Jesus keeps all these appointments even in his own death he said you know what I'm going to raise up at this time I should have known this man keeps all his appointments amen Jesus will meet you at your appointment come to him with faith believing come with a heart amen sincere and not only will he meet your condition meet your need you will never be the same again amen hallelujah so here they come fearful these three women fearful sad cheerful coming with spices to anoint the dead cold body of the Lord Jesus that's what's in their mind right but in reality it's not so week after week people coming and preaching to anoint a dead cold body but that's not the case in reality right I know your body feels like a dead cold unanointed vessel right now amen what did The Church on the Move amen did the church on fire amen amen quickening power one day Amen brother Wade Falls dead in the service yeah amen there's a little Panic you can hear it on the tape there's a little Panic his wife is a resisted nurse she screams out he's dead he has a man quickening power lays within him Dynamic equipping power he goes there and he says brother way the brother wakes up and says yes brother Branham amen Dynamic quickening power of the Holy Ghost amen you say oh don't you have a more up to date testimony don't you ever more up to date because I tell you we are believing for the resurrection of the Dead that should not be foreign to the church if it happened in the book of Acts it must happen again amen if your God is too dead for death you could better bury your religion it's the message you have it doesn't believe that and you say that is for a day gone by you rather bury your religion yeah because if you can't believe for the resurrection of the Dead how are you going to resurrect right amen amen I'll give you more up-to-date testimony one day brother Joshua walking through City Hall amen driving through City Hall speaking about the gravel meetings amen somebody Flags him down tells him pull over he goes there a baby's a baby is being born woman about to deliver babies born on the street there's a nurse right there God knows how to fix situation delivers the baby but the baby amen they can see he's turning blue no heartbeat no pulse right brother Joshua there's your right sure I need you to say a bigger amen than that if you because some of them unbelievers your brother Joshua make Believers unbelievers and True Believers amen completely blue stillborn quickening power of the Holy Ghost if you ask him right now he'll tell you you don't even know what he prayed right but the quickening dynamic power of the Holy Ghost came upon him he prays for that baby baby comes back to life amen and he's got a video of it you still got the video it's in archive right he's got it on the whole computer amen he's trying to walk a plan to try and see how he can extract that video they videoed it quickening Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost if something happens to you or you want us to just take you straight to the mall what do you [Music] amen don't you want to hang around spiritual people a man here's a testimony sister victory's in the house this morning you'll saw it on the group amen maybe they didn't send you the picture but sister Maggie sent me the picture of the readings amen what is that blood what is the high blood pressure was it pressure going low she puts a prayer request praying some of you responded to her amen I'll add the opportunity I was in the room so I said Lord let me go on my knees right now and I said Lord send the angel of God right there right now I send sister Maggie a message back and I said I just prayed for your mom you know tell her they have faith believe she took another reading same time amen what is that quickening Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost amen we shouldn't be preaching something that's far-fetched we must be able to see the results of it amen Jesus Christ did the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah now what what happened that day you'll find here Amen brother you can probably pick it up in let's go to Mark 16 you can put it on the screen reason why I want to get to it is because some younger people need to hear the story amen and it says and when the Sabbath was passed you can put Mark 16 chapter one we all know Mark 16 How It Ends right [Music] these sign shall follow him this is how it starts this is why the science can follow you it's because of what happened here in verse one onwards and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome had brought sweet spices that they made come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the Sepulcher at the rising of the Sun right you know the prophet says there was a dual Sunrise that morning the rising of the sun and the rising of the son and they said among themselves who now look at what their thoughts are their thoughts are more on the sweet spices right and who is going to roll away the stone so that we can actually anoint the body who shall roll away shall roll us away the Stone from the door of the Sepulcher and when they looked they saw the stone was rolled away amen for now here the Bible reiterates the stone was very great and entering into the Sepulcher they saw a young man standing on the right side clawed in a long white garment and they were frightened and he said unto them be not a frightened you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen for he is not here amen behold the place where they laid him [Music] foreign you and I can run through every denomination this morning and make that same statement [Music] you can tell them he is not here you can go to the biggest churches in Durban run there on the platform he is not here he is risen amen hallelujah but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him and he's as he said unto you amen what did he say as he said unto you remember what he said remember what he told us Church remember the messages you've been hearing throughout the years when the dynamic power strikes that word it's going to Quicken you to life amen hallelujah amen and they went out quickly and fled from the Sepulcher for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid right that's not the only thing yeah it's in verse 12 after that he appeared in another form unto two of them and they walked and went into the country and they were told and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them who is this the two men on the road to you Mayors you'll find the full account in Luke right yeah Mark is just bringing it in a simple form and then he says afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they set at meat but watch every time they told him Jesus is Alive Jesus is moving the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost is being outboard they didn't believe them afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they said admit and upgraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which and seen him after he was risen see what he says again they didn't believe those that saw him after he was risen was there another crucifixion in this time you all know the message sermons right was there an indictment I induct this generation There They Crucified him and the prophet brings an indictment upon them he takes them to a trial he finds them guilty of crucifying the world again in this day so if the word was crucified they must come a resurrection they must come a resurrection amen Hallelujah that's why he's preaching it is the rising of the Sun amen the word was crucified all these years but the world is arising in the people's hearts amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and when I saw okay where am I in verse so it says they neither believe they them amen I don't want to get too much into that so you find amen they didn't believe other people they are to see physically so if you have unbelief in your heart then I have the grace enough to say Lord I want to see your resurrection power personally in my life it's my experience on brother Joshua's testimony for the Ramesh testimony brother Neville's testimony brother Sam's testimony say Lord if you are the same yesterday today and forever yourself to me I want to see your resurrection power in my life amen you can't go in on one another's experience we've got to have our own experience amen let me tell you that was the grace of God what you saw that day that was no ordinary incident amen God had allowed you to see that hallelujah look at what happened to Brother Sam here in the meeting he actually challenged the Lord if you ask him go ask him what he sold the Lord he was cleaning the church the day before a couple days before and you know you couldn't use that hand and he said Lord yeah I am cleaning the church and this and that and you know why am I suffering with this he came for prayer that Wednesday still didn't get his healing yeah the Sunday morning we're preaching amen nobody lays hands on him he's sitting there and he's saying Lord while the church is worshiping and praying and you know if you could probably get it on the video how it was going amen and he begins to question the Lord Lord have I done something wrong what have I done why are you not healing me he wanted to have his own experience he wanted his own Supernatural touch amen and there that was a miracle instant healing a miracle right I was standing and I said raise your hands to the Lord and he raised his both hands and then he realized I'm Healed he couldn't contain himself brother Joshua and I just walked out and here the brother standing there and he is weeping weeping crying he can barely speak he's trying to express what just happened amen amen Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost you can receive it this morning amen you can be delivered from your situation this morning amen whatsoever you desire you can receive if you receive it by faith yes Lord thank you Lord amen hallelujah there is no problem to be God cannot solve it Mr jayashree autism is nothing for Jesus Christ amen with a Kenzo amen hallelujah that is nothing but something that they've tagged the name and a label to but I believe in the quickening dynamic power of the Holy Ghost amen I believe he's more than able to heal he's more than able to deliver and he's more than able to set free do you believe it this morning the Bible just said these signs shall follow them that believe he didn't list the sickness and say Don't Touch This there's no sickness that's Untouchable before my God hallelujah amen yeah thank you hallelujah amen if you don't watch it amen they're going to try and pull you in the tribulation with the unbelief this is no the message of the hour came to give you a perfect Faith the message of the hour came to give you rapturing Faith Can you put the dynamic power back in you amen yes Ministries Enoch and Noah both building something yes both building something you know building a pyramid in a building and I mean Noah building an arc both with different Ministry one thing coming to the Earth One preparing for dimensional travel amen hallelujah what Ministry do you want to be under amen they probably tried to call Enos into the ark telling him hey your pyramid is going to get fruited Enoch said I've got a seven step amen and I'm stepping all the way into the king's chamber [Music] do you know the pyramids were built so I was the body of the pharaohs but in this particular pyramid there was no body laid there was no body laid there no body laid there amen Hallelujah two different Ministries they probably tried to entice you know why don't you come down into our ministry tell me to the Earth Enoch heard from another world Enoch was receiving revelation how to build a pyramid amen for you those of you who are unbelievers and agnostics and believe science I'm telling you this morning Enoch built the pyramids right on what Authority on the authority of Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 on the authority of Revelation 10 7. amen a prophet told us he not built the pyramids was it you brother Joshua telling me the other day they're still posting videos trying to figure out how would the pyramids build still trying to figure out how it was built amen but Enoch Was preparing for dimensional travel amen so yeah Noah and his sons amen they were beating and beating you know they had to beat a different tree to get the pitch and they had to cut down word and shape it and mold it and here this man was moving tons of stone the power of the spoken word and that's deep if you don't want to believe that amen one stone weighs so many tons how do they carry it and then they keep placing it on top on top on top amen who helps him yes amen yes amen amen let me ask you this way who helped you get your revelation who helped you be built into such a powerful super Church such a glorious Army of Jesus Christ if not that Revelation 10 yes a message from another world came down a mighty angel came down with an open book bringing [Music] love Amen brother we got him now amen hallelujah amen I'm asking you what's your expectation because Jesus just turned the picture to the right if you get where I am in that book Jesus turned the picture for the disciples he turned the picture for the three women he turned the picture for all of them they were looking at a dead Jesus and they call Jesus you can pick it up in paragraph 15. they were looking at a dead Jesus and a cold Jesus and some look at the cloud and they're looking at a rain cloud some are looking and they're seeing seven angels but the Angels only form the wig yeah he says well if you turn the picture like this and look you probably can't see it from the audience it's Christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and the judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes nose mouth congregation says amen he says he said just turn the picture from this way the way they took it in Life Magazine and he says just turn the picture from this the way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be I was tempted recently I walked into the church and I'm looking at this picture and it's another way I was feeling a bit bad to go turn it to the right I didn't want to be escorted out before I preach amen but the prophet says the way it's supposed to be turn it to the right amen can you see it he is supreme judge there is none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a Vindication that this message is the truth amen hello did you read that some people say the cloud was not the vindication what is the prophet telling you and this is the perfect identification again a Vindication that this message is the truth amen While others are taking out the cloud from their church we are saying it's a Vindication of the message it's a Vindication of Revelation 10. we stand on moved we stand with the prophet and his testimony amen he says this is the truth it's true not making him the third person but the only person amen hallelujah amen and the prophet day in verse 16 you'll finally sing how he's looking to the right amen he says he comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking because on the cross when you look to the right he pardoned The Sinner it says in the light of his resurrection we shall go forth in his name amen Hallelujah in fact this was a culmination of everything he told him follow me he told him about it that in 1933 a voice spoke to him and told him as John the Baptist 4 and the first coming your message shall foreign my second coming amen your message and you know he says he didn't have a message and he was waiting that's why he moved his family and he went Westwood he went to connect with the angels message he went there for the blast he went to connect with the mighty angel so he told him about it since 1933 and they wouldn't believe him but here was a prophet being faithful right division amen make it known upon plates of tablets of stone so he told him write the vision and the fly leaves of your Bible he says though Italian must come to pass have you written your vision have you tearing for it amen hallelujah you shall have what you have desired amen whatever your vision is you shall have it wait for it at the appointed time at the appointed season though he tarry it shall come to pass amen we don't have time to tell you the testimonies of physically where we wrote down the vision and it came to pass hold it before you where you can see that Vision amen amen daily you must see it when you see it you believe it amen if you're believing for a car and you don't have one rent saved amen believe that you shall receive a car brother you ain't carnal now are you limiting my God have a vision amen if all you can afford is a key order for your key go buy that key holder by faith show God he didn't even go buy a pair of shoes or that girl on the stage didn't they buy a pair of shoe already by your key holder you don't have a house goodbye that sign God bless us home and say as soon as I get my house I'm gonna put it there amen move by faith amen Hallelujah I was going to say something else but I'll tell the boys that later amen amen hallelujah amen so quick think power changes us to a supernatural being amen the quickening dynamic power of the Holy Ghost and how is the import outpouring himself amen let's move on Amen is outpouring in you and I amen hallelujah now when he died and rose again you and I became benefactors of this Resurrection you believe that yes amen I'm gone now to first uh paragraph 62. Hebrews 13 8 is made flesh in you if quickening power leads in you Hebrews 13 8 becomes personified in you because then you can't look for somebody else to bring you to pass the Holy Ghost in you will bring you to pass oh Hallelujah come on now get the revelation of this in that day as I was in the Father the father in me I in you quickening power will bring Hebrews 13 8 to pass in your life makes him present tense amen oh yeah amen it says we are his beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of his life the same life same powers that he had when he was here on Earth from God right here he goes on you're gonna have to find this I think it's a bit down there how will I know the message of the hour he says God proves what he promised and he talks about it that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proved what he talked about amen Hallelujah paragraph 18 hear what he says now what the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit does he says his Spirit brings the same life again on the Earth um his Spirit brings the same life on the earth and in 97 we want to get to this now amen we're close with this 97 he says because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is have you been resurrected this morning is collecting power in you what a resurrection this is Amen to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power amen he said how much like the Bible until the worship until the Holy Spirit comes upon the people to Quicken that word amen yeah he's talking now about you know the Cadillac you must have heard this we talk about it many times how people pay a ham and a leg for the BMW but they don't have fuel to put in the car a car is parked in the house okay nice they're polishing it they don't have fuel right so the prophet really labels that point I don't want to do that this morning you can read in the message he says here the gasoline represents the word the truth amen and he says the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to Quicken that word but without the spirit you don't move nine one or four he says we've put let's get this up 104. this is what we've been preaching over the weeks right we said we are in the book of it is the rising of the Sun hear me out now and your older brothers you can hear this as well because it really comes to life when I say all the brothers remember I've also been the message for a very long time amen I might be 44 years old I know some of this you really think I'm 20. but I might be 44 years old but I've been in the message for a long time amen I know some of you think hey this brother's living in the body change but no amen he says we have put too much fresh on the mechanics too much stress and nothing on the dynamic now watch his wording does he say we put some he said we put too much on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and bring to pass that this is gasoline gasoline is being poured out in the 117th year of the latest year in church age amen the holy spirit is being poured out it says it might be in a gasoline can it could still be water you could be hiding what's in your can you know like that people in Matthew 25 with your own with oil maybe you've got water there and you carrying and telling everyone here I got oil here we don't know until you point out right that's what the property is saying you carrying your gasoline can but it could be water but the only proof of it put this life on it prove whether it's whether it's getting or not [Music] it'll burn a lot of sin it'll burn our drinking smoking gambling a doubts me amen pornography amen it will drive all unbelief out put a little word in it we feed ourselves with nonsense we feed ourselves with movies we feed ourselves with Netflix we feed ourselves with showmax put a little word into you thank you Lord amen Hallelujah in 108 he says they asked me in churches churches Brides brides oh so many seven Church Ages full of them churches Brides brides he says but there has got to come one yes oh Hallelujah there's got to come one and he says hallelujah there has to come a real pride in 65 he couldn't see it but amen if my voice didn't get to that sixth Dimension right now I want to say brother Branham that bride is here on the Earth right now amen and I'm preaching to Earth the same gospel that you preach amen only answers what you said in seed form I'm seeing it in Fruit form amen hallelujah he says there has to come a real bride are you a real bride I believe you're a real bride amen there must come one not only got the mechanics not only got the word but the Dynamics of it makes the church live yes make it live if that's you see me maybe it's you that says Lord I just have the word say Lord Make It live in me give me the dynamic uppouring of the Holy Ghost amen amen amen until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs sure what good does it give to give her a facelift or a sermonized job when there's no Dynamics to it oh the Lord help me forgive me for this but there's too many churches just preaching a sermon to people this morning no Dynamic power I am even willing to take you up on your challenge if you are sick right now I don't care your situation how impossible it seems amen God can heal you right now in his presence yes amen that's the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost he says no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right isn't that what we've been living to tell everyone all these years we've got the right mechanics he says no matter how much the mechanics prove proved you right we can send our best teachers teachers there has got to be a dynamic to make it work 111 quickly now and he says as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can be only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any other spoke of the Bride it can only manifest you see what he's saying he's not talking about the only Theory Theory Theory he's saying the only thing he can do is try to produce a manifestation in you start to produce it yes right if you do something different from the groom then you're not bride that's what he's saying then if you don't have the same life as him the same outpouring as him he says you are not bright because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life Jesus is not like Stephen Hawking what's his name the brilliant man who died what's his name Stephen Hawkins you saw he says he saw his body yes that's not Jesus you know what I'm talking about one brilliant yeah I think he died now yeah but he was so brilliant in his mind but he had no use of his body do you think Jesus is like that but that's how some churches are Jesus got no use of his body there they crippled him only the Mind Jesus they say Christ is the head but the body is deformed it's crippled it says if it does something different from the groom it isn't bright because she is flesh of his flesh born of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one the woman taken from the side she has taken a spirit the feminist Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife what is the wife both let's read that properly now cool no no go back go back I just wanted that one line then what makes the wife both the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics comma the wife I Gotta Give English lesson here this morning too so the wife is made up of both mechanics and Dynamics don't never let any church tell you we don't need certain things they are lying to you right bring them before the prophet and call them a liar because they have no free to believe things of God both mechanics and Dynamics makes up the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics it says all until the 1 13 now until the church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did hello listen you must do the things that he did yes did he heal the sick did he raise the Dead amen did he go to the Grave believing for the resurrection you must do the same he says yeah until the church become both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders or some of your car enthusiasts know what I'm talking about 16 cylinder car you know some people don't they drive their car very lightly they don't fight all 16 cylinders but Jesus fired all 16 cylinders he says if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride how many cylinders are you running on no they don't even have one Vijay engines they've got 900 CC and all these things hey the poor quote is crying hey Sparks and all that they call it the spark Chef spot but I don't know what spot that thing's gone hey but he says this car this bride look at what he says here he describes you so will the bride amen for he said he that believeth on me the words that I do shall he do also amen and I give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day that's the Easter message the Dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the Dynamics no good and here's the balance and neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics as a Church of God we want to be faithful to say Lord we want both amen and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the Dynamics will take its place that's what he says these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the Dynamics will take its place amen you know all the Apostle Paul says the gospel came out in word only but in power and in demonstration amen and one of these days as we read Romans 8 11 the quickening power that's laying within you they can come to your grave and say ashes to ashes dust to dust from the
