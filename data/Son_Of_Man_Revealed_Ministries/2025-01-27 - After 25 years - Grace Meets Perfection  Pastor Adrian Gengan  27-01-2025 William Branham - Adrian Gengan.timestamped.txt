[0:03] greeting brothers and sisters the
[0:05] scripture I chose today is from Romans 3
[0:08] from verse
[0:10] 21-31 but now the righteousness of God
[0:12] without the law is manifested being
[0:15] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[0:17] even the righteous of God which is by
[0:19] the faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
[0:21] upon and all of them that believe it but
[0:24] there is no difference for all have
[0:27] sinned and come short of the glory of
[0:29] God being justified freely by his grace
[0:32] through Redemption that is in Jesus
[0:34] Christ whom God has set forth to be a
[0:37] prop through faith in his blood to
[0:40] declare that his righteousness is for
[0:42] the remission of sin that are passed for
[0:45] the forbearance of God to declare I say
[0:49] at this time is righteous that he might
[0:52] be just and the justifier of him which
[0:55] believeth in Jesus where is boasting
[0:58] then it is excluded
[1:00] by what law of of Works n but by the law
[1:06] of Faith therefore we conclude that a
[1:08] man is justified by faith without the
[1:10] Deeds of the law he is the god of the
[1:13] Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles
[1:17] yes of the Gentiles also seeing it is
[1:20] one God which shall justify the
[1:21] circumcision by faith and uncircumcision
[1:25] through faith do we then make the void
[1:28] the LA through faith
[1:30] God forbid y we establish the law in the
[1:35] message it also says this is the key
[1:37] note to the scriptures Faith he that
[1:40] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:43] and the reward of those who is D
[1:46] diligently seeking without faith is it
[1:49] impossible to please
[1:52] God amen glory amen

[6:40] hallelujah he's worthy of praise worthy
[6:43] of honor amen let's turn to our Bibles
[6:45] amen we'll go to the book
[6:47] of Amen
[6:56] Genesis amen the Book of Genesis
[7:06] let's start reading from verse
[7:16] 37
[7:22] amen let's read from verse three now
[7:27] Israel loved Joseph more than all his
[7:29] children
[7:31] children because he was the son of his
[7:33] old age and he made him a coat of many
[7:37] colors and when his Brethren saw that
[7:39] their father loved him more than all his
[7:41] Brethren they hated him and could not
[7:44] speak peaceably unto him and Joseph
[7:47] dreamed a dream and he told it his
[7:49] Brethren and they hated him yet the more
[7:52] and he said unto them yeah I pray thee
[7:54] this dream which I have dreamed for
[7:57] behold we are binding sheep in the field
[8:00] and lo my sheep arose and also stood
[8:03] upright and behold your sheep stood
[8:06] round about and made obes to my sheep
[8:09] and his Brethren said to him shal thou
[8:11] indeed Reign Over Us or sh thou indeed
[8:14] have dominion over us and they hated him
[8:17] yet the more for his dreams and for his
[8:19] words and he dreamed yet another dream
[8:23] and told it his Brethren and said behold
[8:26] I have dreamed a dream more and behold
[8:29] the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars
[8:32] made obedience to
[8:34] me and he told it to his father and to
[8:37] his Brethren and his father rebuked him
[8:40] and said to him what is this dream that
[8:43] thou has dreamed shall I and thy mother
[8:46] and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down
[8:48] ourselves to thee to the Earth and his
[8:51] bre Brethren envied him but his father
[8:54] observed the
[8:56] same amen hallelujah now I want to drop
[8:59] to a few verses here get to 37 and
[9:04] 18 so note now there's no prophet in the
[9:07] land there's no word of the Lord that we
[9:10] are told that he's hearing an audible
[9:11] voice we don't hear about the angel of
[9:13] the Lord all he has is a dream so the
[9:16] dream is typing the word of God Amen
[9:19] praise the Lord 37:18 says when they saw
[9:23] him a far talking about the brothers now
[9:25] even before he came near unto them they
[9:28] conspired against him to slay him so
[9:30] their intention was not to sell him to
[9:32] slavery they want to kill
[9:34] him right remember Joseph is typing
[9:37] Christ now how many times we read in the
[9:39] New Testament in the gospels they want
[9:41] to kill Jesus and they said one to
[9:43] another behold it dreamer cometh come
[9:46] now therefore and let us slay him and
[9:48] cast him into some pit and we will say
[9:50] some evil Beast that devoured him and we
[9:52] shall see what will become of his
[9:55] dreams 22 Ruben is the one that stops IT
[9:59] he says shed no blood but cast him into
[10:01] the pit that is in the
[10:03] wilderness amen lay no hand upon him
[10:07] that he might rid him out of their hands
[10:09] and deliver him to his father again amen
[10:13] 24 says and they took him and cast him
[10:15] into a pit and the pit was empty there
[10:17] was no water in it amen you may be
[10:19] seated we'll continue
[10:22] reading so even when they threw in the
[10:24] pit there's no water in the pit amen 26
[10:28] says Judah now tells the Brethren what
[10:30] prophet is it if we slay our brother and
[10:33] conceal his blood come let us sell him
[10:35] to the ishmaelites and let us let not
[10:38] our hand be upon him for he is our
[10:40] brother and our flesh and his bre
[10:43] Brethren be content right with that so
[10:46] I'm just going to go through a few
[10:47] things amen still reading now Hallelujah
[10:51] in verse 39 chapter
[10:54] 39 so remember he sold to the midianites
[10:57] he's now a slave going to go read the
[10:59] story at first before we get into the
[11:01] sermon amen 39:1 says Joseph was brought
[11:04] down to Egypt and Piper an officer of
[11:07] pharaoh captain of the god so these
[11:09] midianites sell him to Piper brought him
[11:13] of the hands of the ishmaelites which
[11:14] were brought him down to the and the
[11:18] Lord was with Joseph and he was a
[11:20] prosperous
[11:22] man so remember in captivity he's still
[11:26] in
[11:26] prosperity in our journey amen even
[11:29] though we haven't reached the finish yet
[11:31] God is prospering our way amen amen
[11:34] remember Joseph is typing
[11:36] Perfection and he was a prosperous man
[11:39] and he was in the house of his master
[11:41] the Egyptian and his master saw that the
[11:44] Lord was with him and that the Lord made
[11:46] him all made all that he did to prosper
[11:49] in his hand so watch now the world will
[11:51] try to use you more because they know
[11:53] you anointed they know you are
[11:55] blessed they're watching that you are a
[11:57] blessed person what whatever task you
[12:00] give them what whatever task they give
[12:01] you amen you are able to carry out with
[12:03] Excellence so they note these things and
[12:05] they put you to
[12:07] work amen but remember we are called to
[12:10] walk in the
[12:11] kingdom and Joseph found Grace in his
[12:13] sight and he served him and he made him
[12:15] overseer over his house and all that he
[12:18] had put into his
[12:19] hand and he let and he left all that was
[12:23] he had in Joseph's hand and he knew not
[12:25] what he
[12:26] had amen save the bread which he did eat
[12:31] and Joseph was a goodly person well
[12:33] favored amen we're not going to go into
[12:35] the rest you'll know there pipa's wife
[12:38] now makes an attempt Amen to seduce him
[12:42] but Joseph being an upright man refuses
[12:44] the advances and she lies against him
[12:47] and now amen they throw him into prison
[12:51] now as soon as he's thrown into prison
[12:53] in verse 21 there it says but the Lord
[12:55] was with Joseph and showed him mercy and
[12:57] gave him favor in the sight of The
[12:59] Keeper of the prisons and The Keeper of
[13:01] the prison committed to Joseph's hand
[13:03] all the prisoners that were in the
[13:05] prison and whatsoever they did there he
[13:08] was the doer of it the keeper of the
[13:12] prison looked not to anything that was
[13:13] under his hand because the Lord was with
[13:16] him and that which he did the Lord made
[13:18] it to prosper amen hallelujah so we're
[13:22] seeing a patter in Joseph's
[13:25] life amen I want you to know Joseph was
[13:28] not a lazy
[13:30] man any position they put him in he rose
[13:33] to the first position because he was not
[13:35] a lazy person he took his duties he took
[13:39] his responsibilities seriously amen and
[13:41] he had the spirit of Excellency within
[13:43] him amen hallelujah in
[13:46] 41 you see here in Genesis
[13:49] 41:14 then Pharaoh said sent and called
[13:52] Joseph and they brought him eastly out
[13:55] of the dungeon and he shaved himself and
[13:57] changed his rment and and came in unto
[14:00] Pharaoh so for Joseph appearance is very
[14:02] important he doesn't say oh no they call
[14:05] me unexpectantly uh the king can just
[14:07] see me with my long
[14:09] beard he takes pride in
[14:12] himself amen Joseph know he's coming
[14:14] before the king he makes them wait he
[14:18] shaves himself he gets himself all ready
[14:21] because he's coming into the presence of
[14:23] the Pharaoh amen so position yourself
[14:26] amen know how to carry yourself out amen
[14:30] hallelujah amen so you know then they
[14:33] laid out the dream before him and there
[14:35] in 41:38 and Pharaoh said unto his
[14:37] servants can we find such a one as this
[14:40] a man in whom the spirit of God
[14:43] is amen now even the highest office in
[14:47] the land is recognizing the gift in this
[14:49] man and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as
[14:52] much as God had showed thee all this
[14:54] there is none so discreet and wise as
[14:57] Thou Art Thou shalt be over my house
[15:00] according unto Thy word shall all my
[15:03] people be ruled amen only in the throne
[15:07] will I be greater than thou and Pharaoh
[15:09] said unto Joseph see I have sent thee
[15:12] over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh
[15:14] took off his ring from his hand and put
[15:17] it upon Joseph's hand not another ring
[15:19] now I know of another people that gets a
[15:22] ring in this time amen amen hallelujah
[15:24] one who's coming into marriage gets a
[15:26] ring praise the Lord and we know the
[15:28] marriage takes place here on the earth
[15:31] amen and a ra him with Veges of fine
[15:34] linen and put a gold chain about his
[15:37] neck and he made him to ride in the
[15:39] second Chariot which he had and they
[15:41] cried before him bow the knee and he
[15:43] made him ruler over all the land of
[15:45] Egypt and Pharaoh said to Joseph I am
[15:48] pharaoh and without thee shall no man
[15:50] lift up his hand or foot in all the land
[15:53] of
[15:54] Egypt amen just want to get to one more
[15:57] portion of scripture Hal
[15:59] hallelujah
[16:06] amen let's get to amen
[16:10] 45 chapter
[16:21] 45 so Joseph has two meetings first he
[16:24] meets the brothers amen he meets the
[16:28] brother and then he has a condition they
[16:30] must bring back Benjamin now remember
[16:32] the hearts of the children are what's
[16:36] what I'm looking for amen they don't
[16:38] have a good relationship with the father
[16:41] because of what happened to Joseph amen
[16:44] remember the father loved Joseph they
[16:46] sold Joseph they lied to the father and
[16:48] said he's
[16:49] killed so the relationship is
[16:52] strain so the hearts of the children
[16:54] have been turned away from the
[16:57] father amen
[16:59] Hallelujah am so Joseph sends them in
[17:03] order for the hearts of the children
[17:06] amen the hearts of the fathers should be
[17:08] turned back to the children and you'll
[17:11] find there that's typing the amen John
[17:13] the Baptist ministry because the father
[17:15] now listens to the children and he sends
[17:18] Benjamin but there's coming a time now
[17:21] the time that we are living in that the
[17:23] heart of the father is going to be
[17:24] turned back the heart of the children is
[17:26] going to be turned back to the fathers
[17:28] amen
[17:29] hallelujah amen what's happening Grace
[17:32] is going to meet
[17:34] Perfection yes amen remember the prophet
[17:37] is saying under Jacob it's Grace yes
[17:40] hallelujah praise the Lord amen under
[17:43] Joseph is perfection so what we are
[17:45] finding is Grace is coming to Perfection
[17:48] at the evening time amen amen at ab's
[17:51] time Grace is going to find
[17:54] perfection what is that we are going to
[17:56] find it in the message of the hour that
[17:58] whatever seats started the church is
[17:59] going to be the fruit on the
[18:02] tree praise the Lord amen so the title
[18:05] of my message this morning is
[18:08] amen after 25 years Grace meets
[18:12] Perfection amen
[18:14] hallelujah
[18:16] amen so a by saying that God measures
[18:20] faithfulness by what you've done with
[18:22] the promise of the
[18:24] word amen God measures faithfulness but
[18:28] what we have done with
[18:30] promise amen we find here at the age
[18:33] young age of 17 years old Joseph's life
[18:36] he's turned upside
[18:38] down he he held the highest honor in his
[18:42] father's house he was given a code of
[18:44] Many Colors notice this Mark of
[18:47] Distinction in Joseph's life even in his
[18:49] father's house he held the highest honor
[18:51] in his father's heart Amen in his
[18:54] father's house he held the highest Place
[18:56] amen hallelujah
[18:59] and we watch now he's got a code of Many
[19:01] Colors and each stage of his journey he
[19:03] gets a new garment when he sold as a
[19:06] slave amen he gets his slaves
[19:10] Rob when he sold as a servant into part
[19:13] of his house he gets his servants
[19:15] robe when he's sold when he's put down
[19:18] in the prison he gets a prisoner's
[19:20] robe and then when he's raised up into
[19:23] that highest position of Amen second in
[19:26] charge of all of Egypt he's given a
[19:28] rulers Ro a royal
[19:31] robe amen so he has five garments to
[19:34] mark his journey praise the
[19:38] Lord
[19:39] amen so when he is here now at 17 years
[19:43] old he's facing
[19:46] rejection he's facing amen that my
[19:48] brothers don't love me he's facing
[19:51] depression facing anxiety he's facing
[19:54] amen uh all of these negative emotions
[19:57] he's facing separation from family
[19:59] thrown into an unknown
[20:02] World
[20:04] Hallelujah because this world was
[20:06] nothing amen that Jesus knew about yes
[20:08] amen the word was made flesh he came
[20:11] from an Heavenly realm he was thrown
[20:13] into a totally unknown world yes he had
[20:17] never known flesh before praise the Lord
[20:21] amen so at 17 years old you had to learn
[20:24] to trust in God how old are we can we
[20:27] trust in God now remember all he had was
[20:30] the dream he had no written word he had
[20:33] to rely on the
[20:35] dream he had to rely on what was
[20:38] revealed to him through the
[20:41] dream and God there's no record that God
[20:44] continually comes to him to reassure him
[20:46] and reaffirm him so which means in the
[20:48] time of his lowest moments he must have
[20:50] went through loneliness he's in
[20:52] captivity Amen in this period before
[20:55] he's reunited with his brother and his
[20:57] father 13 years passes by so in 13 years
[21:01] he must have experienced a lot of lws in
[21:03] his life yes he must have experienced a
[21:06] lot of Heart Take amen being thrown from
[21:09] one position to the next and just when
[21:11] he thinks he is now the ruler in P's
[21:14] house he's falsely accused and thrown
[21:16] into prison
[21:17] yes even when the butler is restored to
[21:20] his position it takes him two years to
[21:22] remember Joseph yes in all of this time
[21:26] what is his attitude yes
[21:29] Hallelujah in the time of waiting for
[21:32] the dream the word to come to pass what
[21:34] is Joseph's attitude he still has the
[21:37] spirit of Excellence hallelujah amen no
[21:40] matter what we are believing the Lord
[21:42] for what we are trusting him for in the
[21:44] waiting in that waiting period amen we
[21:47] have got to learn to trust in Jesus in
[21:49] the infallible word of God Amen because
[21:51] he will never
[21:54] fail amen
[21:57] hallelujah praise the Lord I want to
[21:59] remind you that the prophet says things
[22:01] happen in the cycle of 2,000
[22:04] years amen you can find that cycle of
[22:06] 2,000 years amen first 2,000 years Noah
[22:10] built the ark second 2,000 years Christ
[22:13] come this is the end of the Gentiles
[22:15] another 2,000 years now at the End of
[22:18] the Age he's got to declare himself as
[22:20] he did then or he did wrong remember
[22:22] we've been through these ports now I'm
[22:24] just refreshing your memory showing you
[22:27] that something happen every 2,000 years
[22:31] then we read another quote amen that in
[22:34] we would see
[22:35] Jesus sorry in Shalom the prophet is
[22:39] saying after he trusted God seen the
[22:41] miracles of god 25 years he waited on a
[22:44] boy a promised son then God told him to
[22:47] go sacrifice the very thing he waited
[22:49] for I'm trying to show you in the lapse
[22:51] of 25 years what are we doing with the
[22:53] promise of God remember how God measures
[22:56] faithfulness what we do with the promise
[22:59] yes praise the Lord so I'm taking
[23:01] another 25
[23:05] years because it took another 25 years
[23:08] for Joseph to be reunited with his
[23:14] father praise the Lord amen he had to
[23:17] wait remember the dream says that your
[23:20] brothers will bow before you then he
[23:22] came back and told his father that you
[23:24] will bow before
[23:25] me that part of the dream amen was only
[23:29] fulfilled after 25

[24:13] and he's reconciled with his
[24:15] brothers
[24:18] amen but God has positioned Joseph and
[24:21] God has positioned us that in every
[24:23] season of our life he has a purpose for
[24:25] it so God has called us now through this
[24:28] dimensional door I'm going to go now
[24:30] straight into our message that God has
[24:32] called us into a dimensional door of the
[24:33] shout for a purpose Hallelujah
[24:36] denominations can't enter this door they
[24:39] can't understand what happens behind
[24:41] this door of the message of the hour
[24:43] they can't understand the mysteries of
[24:44] God they can't understand the Seven
[24:46] Seals they can't understand the seven
[24:48] Thunders amen they can't understand all
[24:50] that is being revealed to us in this age
[24:53] because that's a dimensional door that's
[24:54] been opened to the bride that only we
[24:56] can enter yes it's a revelation only for
[24:59] the
[25:01] bride
[25:02] Hallelujah I'm trying to Define our
[25:04] purpose now yes I'm trying to show you
[25:06] the vision for us and not take you away
[25:08] enough from Joseph and show you that
[25:10] there's a promise for us that we have to
[25:12] be married to the Lord Jesus
[25:15] Christ praise the
[25:17] Lord that's the goal the purpose we have
[25:19] to be married to the word we have to be

[25:27] taken into the the marriage prophet of

[25:40] called us out of every religion God has
[25:42] chosen each and every one of us we have

[26:00] you can believe William gram is the
[26:02] prophet you can believe that you are now
[26:03] going to be the word made flesh he's
[26:05] showing that you are not bypassing the
[26:07] promises for the age and that is a sign
[26:09] that you have the Holy Ghost thank you
[26:12] Lord the prophet of God says that a
[26:14] definite sign is that you recognize your
[26:16] day and its message and not only
[26:19] recognize you go on to live it
[26:21] out praise the Lord so we are united now
[26:24] with the word in an invisible Union and
[26:26] the word is molding us and shaping us

[26:31] say
[26:32] amen and as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[26:35] the word is washing us purifying us we
[26:37] stand Justified now amen We Stand
[26:40] Sanctified we are filled with the Holy
[26:42] Ghost until now we are the word made
[26:45] flesh oh I don't believe that there's
[26:47] coming a time when we are the word made
[26:48] flesh I believe now are we the Sons and
[26:51] Daughters of God I believe now is a
[26:53] season for the word made flesh I believe
[26:55] now is a Time amen when that word is
[26:57] becoming a alive within us and
[27:00] reproducing The Life of Christ within us
[27:03] amen stop doubting yourself stop second
[27:06] guessing yourself amen praise the Lord
[27:09] remember the word of God is always a
[27:12] prophetic word and it's an unfolding
[27:14] revelation of ourselves so amen no
[27:17] matter what we are going through in life
[27:18] don't doubt yourself don't doubt the
[27:20] word of God say I believe everything the
[27:22] word of God says I will be amen thank
[27:25] you amen now are we position for sunship
[27:29] now are we positioned where Sons will
[27:31] take back all that was lost we are here
[27:33] to rightfully reclaim all that was
[27:36] stolen from us in the Garden of Eden yes
[27:39] amen now Joseph wasn't always living on
[27:42] mountain tops 13 years he must have went
[27:45] through some valleys same with us we
[27:47] don't always live on mountain tops we're
[27:49] going through great trials we go through
[27:51] losses we go through depression we go
[27:53] through anxiety we go through trials of
[27:55] this
[27:56] life it's a and flow amen the prophet of
[28:00] God says that works like the
[28:02] seasons but I want you to be confident
[28:05] that in every season God is with
[28:07] us he said I will never leave you nor
[28:10] forsake you praise the
[28:13] Lord so like we were saying what is our
[28:16] attitude where we are currently in our
[28:19] lives we can develop an attitude that
[28:21] God has forgotten about me and become
[28:24] blinded by the surroundings and the
[28:26] situations Remember When Joseph is
[28:28] thrown into the pit he could have been
[28:30] sitting there at the bottom of that pit
[28:32] and all he's seeing is a besides of the
[28:36] walls
[28:37] yes what happened to the
[28:41] dream amen scoffers will
[28:44] come what happened super Church super
[28:48] race what happened Invincible
[28:51] arming amen Joseph had to encourage
[28:54] himself in the
[28:55] Lord he had to remind himself this is
[28:58] not what I saw the walls closing in
[29:01] around me is not what I saw when I look
[29:04] in the word this is not where I see
[29:06] myself amen I am the word made flesh
[29:08] today that's what the word says about me
[29:11] and that's how I must see myself
[29:13] Hallelujah the brothers could have stood
[29:15] on the STP of the pit and laughed at him
[29:17] yeah now who's bowing down Joseph who's
[29:21] bowing down now
[29:24] Joseph sounds a lot like those uh
[29:27] cousins that were scoffing at
[29:29] this girl that was given the promise
[29:32] that the bridegroom was coming for her
[29:34] she was there all dressed because
[29:36] Revelation 19:7 says that the Bride made
[29:39] herself
[29:40] ready she was waiting there with oil in
[29:43] her
[29:43] lamp I say it again the bride is not now
[29:47] the wise virgins standing outside in
[29:49] Leia with oil in their lamp if you seal
[29:52] the wise virgin with oil in your lamp
[29:54] out in Leia you haven't come into
[29:57] Matthew 25 where the bridegroom opened
[29:59] the door and pulled you into the
[30:01] marriage then you need to take marriage
[30:03] of the lamb and invisible Union and go
[30:05] and reread it and see that you have
[30:07] already been married amen you're not
[30:09] relying on any lamp light right now how
[30:11] many of you are relying on Starlight how
[30:13] many of you are relying on any light of
[30:15] the lamp when you get into the holiest
[30:18] of holies into the sh of glory amen
[30:20] there is no other light there besides
[30:22] your kind of Glory
[30:29] hallelujah
[30:31] amen so I'm saying amen that's what the
[30:34] message of the hour did the message of
[30:37] the hour came and brought the bridegroom
[30:40] here with the
[30:42] shout I'm going to say this way as well
[30:45] the Rapture is already in progress amen
[30:49] yes some people are still waiting for
[30:50] the Rapture you're going to miss if you
[30:52] miss your part of the Rapture you're
[30:53] going to miss
[30:55] everything hallelujah our part of the
[30:58] Rapture is being gathered together under
[31:00] the shout message because Jesus does all
[31:03] three things as he's descending he's now
[31:06] come with a shout the shout has gathered
[31:08] us together so we are already gathered
[31:12] in the Rapture caught up in Heavenly
[31:15] places the next part is the voice of the
[31:17] Resurrection which will be to the
[31:19] sleeping
[31:22] Saints Hallelujah if you are not caught
[31:25] up in the shout there's no way you're
[31:26] going to be caught up under the Trum yes
[31:30] Hallelujah because he says the Rapture
[31:32] is only for the bride and the bride is
[31:34] gathered where under the shout so if you
[31:37] haven't come under the message of
[31:39] William
[31:41] brandham if you haven't received the
[31:43] word of the age if you haven't come into
[31:46] Union with Jesus Christ and are married
[31:48] to him
[31:50] now there is no
[31:52] Rapture coming down the road for
[31:55] you hallelujah amen
[32:00] so what did Joseph have to
[32:03] do when he saw all
[32:06] adversity when he saw turmoil he had to
[32:10] focus sir because Satan tactics is to
[32:14] destabilize us yes Satan's tax is to
[32:18] take us our eyes off the word but every
[32:21] day I believe morning evening I don't
[32:23] know how many times a day Joseph prayed
[32:26] he had to refocus on the dream
[32:29] which is a type of the word he had to
[32:32] remind himself of the
[32:34] word one day even though I'm in this pit
[32:38] maybe when he was in part of his house
[32:40] he said even though I'm here as a slave
[32:43] maybe when he was a prisoner he said one
[32:45] day that dream of my brothers bowing
[32:47] down before me of my fathers bowing down
[32:50] before me will come to pass am
[32:52] Hallelujah I read a promise in the
[32:54] scripture to you that overcome Leia I
[32:57] will grant that you sit with me on my
[32:58] throne even as I overcame and I'm sat
[33:01] down on my father's Throne remind
[33:03] yourself of the scripture that one day
[33:06] amen one day amen you shall inherit
[33:09] because now you are overcoming the
[33:14] age amen hallelujah so he had to realign
[33:18] himself he had to refocus
[33:23] yes he was he was so confident that God
[33:27] had him in the seat Reon and that this
[33:29] purpose was orchestrated by God because
[33:32] God works all things together for our
[33:35] good
[33:37] amen so even when the Lord takes away
[33:41] when the Lord gives we say blessed be
[33:43] the name of the Lord amen amen it's the
[33:46] Lord who is in control of Our
[33:49] Lives amen all things are working
[33:52] together for my good amen we've got to
[33:54] encourage oursel and say my God is
[33:56] faithful yes amen hallelujah so if my
[33:59] God is faithful I've got to remain full
[34:01] of
[34:03] Faith amen my God didn't bring me this
[34:05] far to leave me my God didn't teach me
[34:08] to swim to Let Me Drown Hallelujah my
[34:11] God didn't take me into Heavenly places
[34:13] and TP me as a flying eagle amen for me
[34:16] to be tossed about by every wind amen
[34:20] because an eagle knows how to handle the
[34:22] storms of life the eagle actually uses
[34:25] the storms to start to Glide Hallelujah
[34:28] circumstances may look like it's against
[34:30] us amen it may seem like you right now
[34:32] you're in a holing pattern but my God's
[34:34] plans are greater than my current
[34:38] situation praise the Lord Jeremiah 29:11
[34:41] says I know the thoughts I think towards
[34:43] you you mean God thinks of
[34:45] me God thinks of you
[34:48] individually God says have you seen my
[34:51] boy oh he's coming nicely into the word
[34:53] image Hallelujah have you seen my
[34:55] daughter coming nicely into the word
[34:57] image look how she submits herself to
[34:59] the word amen look in the midst of
[35:01] leosia in the midst of gross
[35:04] Darkness she's allowing he is allowing
[35:07] the word to be made flesh in her
[35:11] Hallelujah I know the thoughts I think
[35:13] toward you say the Lord thoughts of
[35:15] Peace not of evil to give you an
[35:17] expected end amen God didn't give us the
[35:21] ability to have the spirit of the Flying
[35:24] Eagle for us to disintegrate In The Heat
[35:26] Of The Sun yes
[35:29] am because up there you closer to the
[35:32] Sun but God has given them the
[35:34] resistance to
[35:35] release resilience to cope with the heat
[35:38] of the
[35:40] sun that's why not anyone can get called
[35:42] into the shout door because there it's a
[35:46] sunlight only a certain class can handle
[35:48] sunlight hallelujah praise the Lord you
[35:51] better not come into there with
[35:55] sunscreen allow the full raise of the
[35:57] the Son of
[35:58] God hallelujah tell your neighbor no

[36:05] God praise the
[36:07] Lord with my Eagle abilities I can cope
[36:10] with the heat of the sun I can cope with
[36:12] the storms of life amen I know how to

[45:19] can restore it to
[45:21] you thank you Jesus thank you Lord I

[45:53] besides Sarah being past the age of
[45:55] childbearing she had cried for All That
[45:57] 70 years yes she was Barren
[46:00] yes she couldn't have a
[46:03] child praise the
[46:06] Lord so 25 years had gone adjusted their
[46:09] lives content with the way things are
[46:11] content with the way things are in the
[46:13] message I go to church I listen to a
[46:15] good message God is saying not this year
[46:18] God is saying not this time around I am
[46:20] coming now to confirm my promise shall I
[46:23] hie from Abraham that which I'm about to
[46:25] do
[46:28] read second Peter because God is Not
[46:30] slack concerning his promise 2 Peter 3:9
[46:32] the Bible says the Lord is not slack
[46:35] concerning his
[46:37] promise you have promised a body change
[46:41] but before the body change you are
[46:43] promised to come into Union with Christ
[46:45] that is a
[46:49] promise praise the
[46:54] Lord the Lord is not SL concerning his
[46:57] promise as some men count slackness but
[47:00] his longsuffering to usw not willing
[47:02] that any should perish but that all
[47:04] should come to repentance amen amen
[47:08] thank you Lord now to tie a parallel
[47:10] with this we may have forgotten about
[47:13] God's promises in our
[47:16] lives maybe God has confirmed something
[47:18] to you
[47:19] individually God has spoken something to
[47:24] you maybe we forgot about his maybe we
[47:27] forgot about his purpose but I want you
[47:29] to know God has not forgotten about
[47:33] it God has not forgotten about what he
[47:36] has spoken to
[47:40] you when God speaks a thing it must come
[47:43] to pass amen amen numbers 23:
[47:49] 19 I want you to believe in the Lord
[47:52] numbers 23:19 says God is not a man that
[47:56] he should
[47:58] lie amen praise the Lord in Isaiah
[48:04] 55 Isaiah
[48:06] 55 verse 10 for as the rain cometh down
[48:10] and the snow from heaven and R return it
[48:13] not tother but water the Earth and
[48:16] maketh it bring forth and but that it
[48:20] might give seed to the sewer and bread
[48:22] to the eater so the Lord is typing this
[48:25] this uh scenario of sewing and reaping
[48:28] and with the natural elements of rain
[48:30] and all of these things and you're
[48:32] receiving an AR so watch how he types it
[48:34] now he says so my word be that goe forth
[48:38] out of my mouth so he's saying my word
[48:40] is like that it's like a seed that goes
[48:42] forth amen it shall not return unto me
[48:45] void yes Hallelujah yes meaning if God
[48:48] sent you out with a mango seed you are
[48:50] not coming back with a mango seed but
[48:52] you're coming with a harvest of
[48:55] mangoes amen

[49:02] prophet in the cave in 1946 I'm going to
[49:04] send you out to the nations of the world

[49:07] and then he further gave him a third
[49:09] pool telling him he would get the Bride
[49:10] of Jesus Christ he's not coming back
[49:12] empty-handed but now at our's time there
[49:15] is coming forth a

[1:02:56] super church and a super

[1:03:13] spoken word seed son was a spoken seed
[1:03:16] word of God he was given a bride to

[1:03:30] given to him to reproduce himself to
[1:03:33] produce another Son of
[1:03:36] God Amen praise the Lord he goes on to
[1:03:40] say Jesus was also a spoken a seed word
[1:03:43] of God given a bride like Adam but

[1:03:47] Fallen amen she was put to the test if
[1:03:49] she would believe the word and live she
[1:03:51] doubted the word and died now he goes on
[1:03:54] to our last part this is packed with
[1:03:55] promise from a little group of the true
[1:03:57] seed of the word God will present Christ
[1:04:00] with a beloved bride amen she is Virgin
[1:04:02] of his word she's virgin because she
[1:04:04] knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas by

[1:04:09] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:04:11] of God to be made manifest in the Virgin

[1:05:20] the word of
[1:05:22] God is it a pattern yes is it a
[1:05:26] coincidence that Abraham and Sarah had
[1:05:27] to away 25 years is it a coincidence
[1:05:31] that Joseph had to away 25
[1:05:33] years is it a coincidence that we find
[1:05:36] ourselves now 25 years
[1:05:39] later every 2,000 years something major
[1:05:44] happens is it a coincidence that we find
[1:05:46] ourselves strategically placed right now
