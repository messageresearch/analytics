========================================

amen we'll speak title called Mount Zion the hill of his glory amen Mount Zion the hill of his glory Psalm 24 reads the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof amen that's ownership he's declaring ownership amen amen hallelujah amen there's only one that can put claims the King of Kings and the Lord of lords the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein amen not only is the heavens and earth is but the occupants belong to him so it's futile for man to fight over land when it doesn't belong to them they are custodians of the land amen praise the Lord so he starts off this chapter by declaring who is is the ruler who is the owner amen and the inhabitants thereof are also of the Lord for ye has founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the floods now you got to read Genesis there to read how the firmament above and the firmament below because you do know that science if you go watch all of these Rockets they can't get a rocket past a certain space it hits like called a glass ceiling when it touches that it explodes okay they were launched one recently you'll see the video footage when it hits that place it explodes the radiation is too great it can't go past that barrier so he's saying he founded it upon the Seas he established it upon the floods and here in verse three it says who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place right the hill of the Lord is where the presence of the Lord is the hill of the Lord amen is his Tabernacle now remember this is prior Calvary so they need to go to a physical Temple Ascend the hill go to the temple we know now in the Third Exodus the scene is changed we are the living Tabernacle of the most high God but the one that can Ascend the glory realm can get into the glory of the Lord is one that had Clean Hands and a pure heart amen must have clean hands and a pure heart who had not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully now this person that has Clean Hands pure heart doesn't lift his soul to vanity or sworn deceitfully has a blessing attached to it he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and the righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face oh Jacob which generation the end time generation this is the generation amen not the generation gone before but I say to you this is the generation I'm reading from the Bible Church of God I'm saying this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy faith oh Jacob lift up your head now watch there's a pause there at the sixth then in the seventh lift up he heads ho he Gates and be lift up he Everlasting doors and let the king of glory and the king of glory shall come in amen amen who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle lift up he heads oh he Gates even lift them up the Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the Lord of hosts he is the king of glory amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise the Lord amen so as we've been built up in the message of the hour we know that Mount Zion is typing an end time people amen hallelujah the Lord had met his people on different mountains at different time am amen but in the end time there not a physical mountain called Mount Zion it's a spiritual reference to the body and the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ Mount Zion the Lamb's wife amen the city of the Living God where God dwells where God Tabernacles Hallelujah aren't you glad to be part of the Tabernacle of God Amen praise the Lord amen if you know these things say Amen so I know that you know it I don't have to go digging the quotes for you and show you and prove to you that m Zion is the city of the Living God we've been through this through the years amen Mount Zion Hallelujah now in Psalms 24 is speaking about the hill of the Lord this means the place where the Lord lived amongst his people you would know it's the place of the Tabernacle at once you remember the meeting place around the tent then when the temple was built right think of Abraham now because they say that the temple is built where Isaac was about to be sacrificed same spot but did he go up the hill amen he went up the hill did the Lord Jesus go up the hill amen so it's all shadows and types so he's asking who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord who shall go into the glory realm where his glory descends now that is typing now we said the Tabernacle the temple the hill of the Lord that's what who shall Ascend the the hill of the Lord means who wants to really go into his glory realm amen so from that time forward where David is referencing it it's called The Hill of the Lord Jerusalem Mount Zion amen now we know that like we said now Mount Zion is the bride the Lamb's wife which is the holy place where the presence and the glory of God dwells amen hallelujah we are to carry ourselves am amen recognizing that we carry the anointing of the most high God Amen I'm going to put it to you this way because I want you to really grasp and understand who you are in this hour because we've got to get a revelation of who we are Amen brother brandom says if we have the spirit of Beethoven we'll start to act like Beethoven we'll start to play music like Beethoven amen everything about us be governed by the spirit of bethoven amen amen so much so that you wouldn't be able to tell bethoven and me apart yes amen he says if you had the spirit of some singer maybe Elvis Presley or some amen sing a modern day singer today he says you'll start to impersonate him you'll start to sing like him start to act like him start to dress like him so much so amen that you will become an impersonator of that person and some people are so good impersonators you can't tell the difference between the original and the fake amen now I put it to you this way I'm using a a law term there brother Joshua I put it to you amen that when the spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart the spirit of the Lord is the Lord God Almighty if he possesses this vessel who must I act like amen who must I behave like yes amen who must I represent like amen will I be different from God come on now no Hallelujah hey amen hallelujah God has sent forth the spirit of his son whereby we can cry so he's sending the spirit of his sons two sons yes amen amen I hope you catching it amen because when you possess the Holy Spirit who are you really then amen yes Hallelujah absolutely absolutely amen recognizing who we are recognizing the anointing we carry recognizing amen that we must have clean hands and a pure heart am then we can't conduct ourselves the way that we we want to In the Flesh in the world in our business Affairs in our home Affairs in our offices in our schools in our College our campus wherever we go we carry the glory anointing amen if people don't want to go to Church you take the presence of God into your workplace you take the presence of God into your work you take the presence of God into your school wherever you go you're carrying the presence and the anointing of God amen amen hallelujah that's what Peter was about Peter carried the presence of God that even his shadow was anointed amen it goes past your physical being that even the sun casting light upon your body cast a shadow Your Shadow is Anointed amen amen amen hallelujah you carry an anointing about you so much so amen hallelujah Supernatural things start to transpire in your life you have a thought and there it is it's happening amen hallelujah his glory anointing is here you think about this person it happens you see them or they inform them or something happens to connect you with them what is happening we are speeding up catching up with another dimension amen that Dimension is faster Dimension so that Dimension will have to slow down to bring up amen the six Dimension Saints and we'll have to speed up amen am into a faster Dimension amen glory be to his name amen amen hallelujah so what what are we really saying amen the bride of Christ is now reflecting the glory of God on the earth now amen amen the bride of Christ which is you and I are reflecting the glory of God on the earth now yes and we are not reflecting it it's shining from Heaven to Earth hear me what I'm saying now not in this time in this season not in the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ we are not reflectors of the Sun from Heaven amen how me if you understand what I'm saying the sun is not in heaven and the moon on the Earth and we are reflecting the sunlight from Heaven onto the Earth the glory amen because now is the time we are reflecting his glory what is it Christ in us the hope of glory amen we are reflecting the glory from within because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world amen amen hallelujah oh I'm going to say it again because I wanted to sink in the Holy Ghost In You Is God Amen amen I i' like to make it simple amen so that you understand the Holy Ghost In You Is God Amen God tabernacled your flesh you say but I thought that was a onean scripture a son of man revealing the son of man you know something about a manufacturer when he when he's creating a car let's talk about cars they have a prototype you know where I'm going with this they have a prototype and until they Excel that prototype yes they won't put it in mass production so God worked with a one man scripture God worked with a prophet amen until the Prototype was perfected until he could fully display his glory through this one Prophet amen then he said this wave she way before us amen I have confidence in this amen I have confidence in man now amen that the wave sheath is waved before the people and if I can reflect my glory through him I can now reflect it to the people who accept his message amen amen thank you Hallelujah you see we carry within us I was trying to present this to you on Sunday amen I was trying to present I don't know if you really got it or not that what we have different from the other churches is our Revelation yeah the revelation of the mysteries of God yes and and what that value is what the essence of the Revelation is the substance the glory of the Revelation is is that when we receive the Revelation yesen it is the glory of God revealed to us because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God so why I'm what I'm telling you I'm trying to bring it down I'm trying to break it down now let us not devalue the Revelation that we have in this hour am and think that the prophet came to reveal the mysteries of God for no reason we think it has no value to us it doesn't pertain to our daily lives but the the Revelation is our glory amen because what is coming out of the Revelation out of the Hidden Mysteries is coming forth of Faith amen because these divinely revealed mystery truths will literally turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers so there is glory in the Revelation revealed to us amen because the the Revelation is Christ himself being revealed how many of you know that's in the seal it's Christ revealing himself amen amen hallelujah so he's come to make it so plain to us so clear to us that this is now when his character is revealed to us when his nature is revealed to us his mind is revealed to us that's him revealing his glory and he'll reveal and share his glory with no one except the one to whom he has given after the kingdom oh yes amen so what a privilege we have church that we have been given the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven the mystery that he had locked up in the back part of his mind is now revealed to you and I you say I don't understand the Mysteries I don't understand the Revelation then you need to stay in the presence of God till he reveals it to you outside of the the mystery of God being revealed in this hour outside of us getting a understanding of the mysteries of God the revelation of God our our life has no value do you know if let me say it this way the Mysteries equals Thunders amen amen because he says the Thunders are the divinely revealed truths mystery truths right so I know many times when we say Thunders people don't understand what that means they think it's very mysterious amen hallelujah praise the Lord but it is him revealing himself to us through his word amen God has no higher order than revealing his word than through his Prophet yes amen but when he is revealing his word he's really revealing himself to us Christ amen praise the Lord amen you know these are the things we ought to be rejoicing about amen because this is life you you may be thinking what is the value in this I'm trying to show you the value in the revelation of the word it is the glory of God revealed to us am because think of it now when the glory of the Lord is revealed only this word this glory is going to produce rapturing Faith amen because Faith cometh by the hearing hearing of the word of God but how about when all the Mysteries are revealed what value will hearing that word amen the word revealed by the prophet the word where the Bible is made a new book to us it's going to produce a perfect Faith because we have partial understanding of the scriptures we have perfect understanding of the scriptures so it's got to produce a perfect Faith Can you say amen amen yes Hallelujah you know when you're sitting in algebra class and you you you bit lost in the class you and the teacher say you understand everybody say you understand amen hallelujah so I pray it's not going over your head this evening and I'm trying to break it down as and I'm not trying to talk message language but I really want to bring it down amen because the church cannot progress unless it understands who she is and the value of what has been revealed to us so I'm speaking about man Zion the hill of his glory so if people want to see the glory of God where must they come go to Israel see the temple go before the wall there's no value in that that is what the prophet says a day gone by Looking In if you want to go to Israel fine I know the the prophet encourages people he says you know what you go to Israel the Bible becomes a new book to you not a new book but it becomes alive to you because you walk where Jesus walked the Sea of Galilee you go to the tomb amen it makes you maybe understand the Bible better amen those experiences become alive to you but I'm saying if we really recognize who you are yes then that you have more value than that amen if people want to come into His presence if people want to come into the Tabernacle of God where must they come say me amen because who are you yes brother ra the word but who are you you are the word made flesh amen now it may seem a lot to swallow because you think me with my faults and my failures because you're looking at the flesh now me with my faults and my failures and my short temper and my attitude and my no patience and my all of these things but God is working on you oh yes building you up amen amen hallelujah don't look at the flesh thank you that's why the Apostle Paul is admonishing us I die to the flesh daily you see it's a struggle for you to really serve God I'm talking according to the flesh but when the spirit rules the [Music] flesh you take dominion over the the flesh amen right so I want you those of us that are exercising Mark 11:23 in the hour you can't exercise Mark 11:23 and call things into existence if you can't bring this under subjection first speak to your own flesh amen speak to this mountain amen everybody here what I'm saying before you go and speak to any other thing situation speak to this mountain say you come under subjection you like certain things I'm bringing you under subjection listen here my body is in a fallen state but I am coming back through Redemption amen and I have a c Gene Within Me amen hallelujah yes you know you got the C Gene within you that's all that matters amen because there is value there's Essence to the seed you put that seed in the right atmosphere it's going to grow yes and when that seed grows no matter if you put that seed in any other place as long as it's in the right environment what is in that seed Hallelujah if fact I don't know what the right word is but the DNA of that seed must come forth yes so if you are the gene of God the attribute of God the seed of God you are going to come forth in this hour irrespective of how your faults and your failures amen you are going to come forth in this hour shining forth in your Eden Beauty yes Lord amen so look past your faults amen look at the value of the Cross look at the blood amen hallelujah amen because when Satan is making you focus on your faults and failures he's basically telling you the blood was not enough and if you dwell on that and say yes I'm so weak I'm so feeble I'm like this you are also agreeing with the devil that the blood was not enough because the blood cleanses us from sin the blood cleanses us amen Hallelujah and makes us righteous thank you Lord hallelujah the blood amen apply the blood apply the token you Lord thank you Lord there is power in the cleansing blood of the Lamb thank you Lord amen praise the Lord so what are we really saying now is the season where we are reflecting the glory from within identifying that this is the day of St John 14:20 what is say in John 14:20 amen what is say in John 14 I'm saying this is the day where St John 14:20 is coming to pass let's read St John 14:20 it says at that day you shall know that I jesus am in the father and you the bride in me and I Jesus in where amen now if we are so close to the Rapture and the Rapture comes tomorrow is this scripture a future event or must it be fulfilled before the Rapture must this scripture be fulfilled before the Rapture so he says that that day you shall know I am in the father you in me and I in you amen it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me amen amen now we're going to read Hebrews chapter 12 this is a very important scripture for what we are saying now you'll see here what the Apostle Paul is telling us so remember all the mountains all the hills where God's presence was his presence was So Glorious that nobody could touch it nobody could come near except Moses except the priest but even they what they had to have clean hands and a pure heart everybody agree right so he's saying you have not come unto the mount that might be touched for you are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words what happened on the mountain there was a cloud there was voices amen his glory sh kind of Glory was coming down there was fire right which which voice that they heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore I want you to focus on the scripture now where is The Voice coming from Heaven The Voice is coming from Heaven everybody say The Voice is coming from Heaven Voice is coming from tell your neighbor The Voice is coming from heaven I'm doing this for a reason because when I go to another scripture you'll tie it in with what Paul is saying right for they could not endure that which was commanded you see when this event happens the church world can't endure you're seeing it now they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountains it should not be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quick now the scene changes but you I come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God Amen oh if only the church realize that this is a living God amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord this is the Church of the Living God amen amen and we carriers of the Holy Ghost we are to be a people Full of Life full of action amen full of the Holy Ghost anointing unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and unto an inumerable company of angels Lord open the boy's eyes amen thank you hallelujah thank you Lord I'm seeing some other scripture all over this place yes why where is he coming he is coming to Mount Zion the Lord is coming to where now if the Lord comes who's he coming back for in the second coming yes who is the bride Mount Zion but he's saying you are come un to mount Zion unto the city of the Living God we are the city if you're wondering who's the city yes say we are the city we are the city of the Living God of the Living God right when he's talking about Heavenly Jerusalem he's talking about us yes and to an innumerable countless yes company of angels yes amen are we connected to the Angelic realm yes to the general assembly the Church of the first born which are written in heaven now when was his names revealed amen and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of judg men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel now see that you refuse not him that speaketh yes for if they escape not we refused him that spake on Earth how much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven yes remember we said the voice from Heaven yes whose voice shook the amen amen his voice shook the Earth praise the Lord but now he has promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also Heaven am amen who has the ability to speak and Shake both heavens and earth if not God if not one yeah I'm going to give it away if I say it now amen I got to keep my highlights for my highlights amen praise the Lord but you know what I'm talking about and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain who's remaining in this hour yes it's the Bride of Jesus Christ we can't be shaken amen wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire amen amen amen now all of that I'm telling you the Lord is coming Revelation 10 he's coming to Mount Zion that's the scripture I was referencing I said I see that scripture all over what we were just reading when the mighty Angel is descending where is he coming oh yes amen what is he bringing the book too yes amen who's John a type of the who's the bride Mount Z so can I say the Angel is coming to Mount Zion yes amen so let's put Revelation chap 10 a amen praise the Lord amen Revelation 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head amen he's descending upon Mount Zion he's got a cloud he's got a rainbow amen and his face he's got the glory as the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and in his hand he has the book titled he didn't we just read there now talking about the names revealed in Hebrews 12 the names revealed amen praise the Lord set his right foot upon the sea upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice amen hello yes didn't we just read his voice shook the Earth amen but now he had promised yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also Heaven amen come on now I need you to catch this amen hallelujah this is a deep study now come on everybody put your thinking caps on Amen Revelation chapter 8 there's silence in heaven Revelation chapter 8 under that seven seal they silence in heaven why very important brother Bram tells us that when the lion roars in a jungle everything shuts up yes everybody understand natural type everything shuts up so great is this Angel let's read it now again and see his voice what it sounds like like and he cried with a loud voice as when a what Roars so when the lion roars must everything keep quiet yes amen right everything will keep quiet not only on the Earth where it's roaring why you got to put now let's go back the people need to catch this Hebrews 12 and verse 26 Hebrews 12:26 right he Roars like a lion and we said when he roar like a lion everything must sh up the voice would shook the Earth but now it promised yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also Heaven amen so the roar goes from Heaven to Earth amen or from Earth to Heaven because it's the king speaking amen and when the king speaking he has subjects both on the earth and in heaven so when the king speaks will everything keep quiet amen praise the Lord hallelujah that's verse three now and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices who are the seven Thunders amen praise the Lord hallelujah and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Rose and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write I Heard a Voice where's the voice coming from now you remember I made you repeat something The Voice is coming from seal up those things which the seventh undes outed write them not right you know then we go down there now to verse seven so verse six now starts like this swear by him which liveth forever created heaven things there are in didn't we read Psalm 24 now telling you who created who's the honor amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord I'm taking advantage of you class amen I'm taking advantage of you and teaching you deeper things tonight amen thank you because the spirit does not move freely on a Sunday thank you Lord understand what I am saying Thank You Lord amen the devil don't like to go church Wednesday so the spirit of the Lord moves freely on the wednes day amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah stop trying to be a janitor I'm giving you a doctor's degree tonight amen you see if we can't Rejoice around these we shouldn't be in the message of the hour yes amen this is our truth yes this is what's revealed this is manifestation time these scriptures are the ones that are alive now amen amen praise the Lord so showing you the ownership Psalms 24 verse one there same thing amen praise the Lord yes then 107 you know the the seventh angel sounds then now verse 8 this is what I was trying to get to the voice which I heard from where Heaven spake unto me again go and take the book now why am I telling you all of this I want to simplify it again because I don't want you to get lost in the translation what does Psalm 24 says who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord he that has Clean Hands and a pure heart right that's the one qualified to enter the hill of the Lord the glory of the Lord but here we find in Revelation 10 the glory of the Lord is coming down okay amen break it down again the mighty Angel is who the mighty Angel is Christ amen hallelujah it's the same one that took the book in heaven but now he's changed form amen amen hallelujah amen let me break break it down even more God is a spirit and he has bodies amen he's got a theop body mesic he took on a flesh body called Jesus he's got an Angelic body amen hallelujah am that's right amen praise the Lord amen he's got an Angelic body so he comes down as a mighty Angel amen praise the Lord and he and he comes down and he's got title deed he's got he's got the title deed of man's inheritance yes to the Earth giving you back your Authority your power that lost in Eden and is now telling you the voice is speaking from Heaven saying go and take the book from the hand of the Angel amen so you've got to have connect the ability to hear from Heaven to go and take the book amen amen praise the Lord so who is qualified to take the book is what I'm telling you the glory is coming down the hill of the Lord to the hill of the Lord so the only one qualified to take the book from the end of the Angels is he that has Clean Hands in a pure heart amen apart from that you can't touch this book amen Amen Let it sink in again but you start rejoicing about this truth amen amen we at Psalm 24 who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord from you say why are you speaking this we know these things for many years we preached it in Prophecy Hallelujah many years we preach Revelation 10 in Prophecy but I say to you this is the year of manifestation when the people who have clean hands and a pure heart of people who are cons consecrated to the Lord can go to the angel take the book amen amen the ones with Clean Hands and a pure heart are the only ones qualified to go and take the book amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah and what did he do did the angel say sorry I can't give this to you you're not qualified did the angel say you H do not have Clean Hands in a pure heart you can't touch this book did the angel say that you are not the inheritors to the [Music] Earth let me put it you another way denominations don't know that there's a message given to John to go and take the book yes it's a hidden Mystery amen so they can't go to the angel and tell him give me the little book give me my inheritance to the earth oh yes give me the key to unlock Mark 11:23 come on people amen give me the key to unlock Mark 23 nobody can can go to the angel and claim title Deeds to the Earth but to a selective group of people people whose names are found in the book people who have clean hands and a pure heart you and I give God praise amen hallelujah only we can do it why we have identity if the angel asks you who are you for you to come to me and ask me to give you the little book you say I am a son of a king amen I know who I am Hallelujah I have clean hands I have a pure heart I heard the voice from Heaven amen amen yes Lord hallelujah yes so what am I saying look at it from another point of view from the Angel's point of view from the angel point of view John is coming to the angel and he's seeing John say give me the little book he being God Almighty in Angelic form knows where this man is qualified to take the book but he doesn't refuse him oh yes am yes Lord he will not deny him doesn't it sound like eser going to the king yes wonderful and what is it oh it's just coming now Lord heavens and earth are his kingdom but half the kingdom is where the Earth so he says to half the kingdom give God praise for that amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord he that has Clean Hands and a pure heart amen amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah so he doesn't refuse the one who's asking him he gives him the little book he takes the book and he doesn't lay idle with the book he starts to eat he starts to eat because his eating is going to change him amen hallelujah this Revelation is going to change you give you so much of of Faith it's going to produce a new body hallelujah amen hallelujah you know when you when you when you got ingredients for a recipe if you put all the
