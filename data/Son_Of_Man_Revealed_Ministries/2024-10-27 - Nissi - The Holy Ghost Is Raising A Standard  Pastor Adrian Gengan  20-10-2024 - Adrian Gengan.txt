God this morning we pray we ask His blessings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with much Thanksgiving amen amen amen amen I greet you all in the precious and most holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen let's give the Lord a good hand clap of Praise amen he's worthy to be praised amen so I pray amen everyone is blessed amen sister Lily is back from a little vacation I'm sure brother sun is very happy Amen to have a back praise the Lord amen so everyone feeling good amen let's turn to our Bibles our swords pull out our swords this morning as we go into battle amen we want to Center our thoughts on Jehovah nii and we know that nii means the Lord is our Banner amen it was one of the Redemptive names of the Lord of our Our God Amen before he became manifest in Jesus Christ and one of that names is nii and that name means Banner another name could mean a standard that's raised amen so we'll send to that and amen we'll title it amen the Holy Ghost is raised a banner or a standard in this day amen we can also say it another way that the angel of God is here raising a standard praise the Lord so let's go to Exodus chapter 17 we'll read from verse 8 this this is the time where Moses amen the prophet Moses is still amen leading the children of Israel and 17 starts there with water coming out of the Rock from verse 8 then came amalec and fought with Israel in refidim and Moses said to Joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalec tomorrow I will send stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand so Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with amalec and Moses Aaron and er went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalec prevailed but moses' hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on and Aaron and er stayed up his hands and the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun and Joshua discomforted amalec and his people with the edge of The Sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put out the remembrance of amalec from under heaven so that is to utterly slay and Destroy they amen and Moses built an altar and call the name of it Jehovah nii for he said because the Lord had sworn that the Lord will have war with amalec from generation to generation amen so there Moses Builds an altar and he calls it Jehovah ni which is that was symbolizing the standard that Moses had raised which was the banner amen let's go to zah chapter 59 amen this is preluding amen 60 which is arise and shine the light has come amen but God gives a promise before he gets to chapter 60 there if we can read here in Isaiah 59 praise the Lord from verse 16 and he saw that there was no man and wondered there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate amen now we know that Ephesians 6 talks about the breastplate of righteousness so we see it's the same one here for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clar with Zeal as a cloak according to their deeds amen now what did we read in Ephesians 6 there that it's the armor of God here God is putting on the armor and he's going to fight for Israel right according to the Deeds accordingly he will repay Fury to the adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so then they so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from rising from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standarded against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from the transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them sayeth the Lord L my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayth the Lord from ends forth and forever the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise the Lord amen so we see that this is a time of spiritual warfare and a standard was used in the time of battle ancient armies used to carry B carry banners amen as marks of identification and as symbols that embodied amen what they were fighting for so the banner or the standard must have significance or meaning yes amen it's like a flag we our mod days of a standard is a flag amen a banner something that can be seen from afar it also serves as a railing point for troops when they see the standard raised they know the captain of the host is there whoever is leading the Army is based where the standard is raised amen praise the Lord so we find amen banners were used Amen in Egypt Babylon Persia and the Israelites carried them amen in their March through the desert amen we can we find amen that this is announcement before the battle is won they can raise the standard or is after a victory that they put a flag up there to say that they have conquered territory amen amen so when Moses holds up the stuff of God in the battle here with the amalekites he's holding it up like a banner he he's raising a standard yes amen and by building God an altar he's calling it Yahweh nii or Jehovah nii the Lord is my banner so he's creating this as a memorial to show God's protection and his power amen so if you think of the story every time Moses hands got weary and His Hands dropped the AMCs were winning the battle meaning troops were being injured but the moment he raised his hand up again Joshua and the Army were prevailing over the enemy so that is telling us in this hour that the standard can't be dropped we've got to keep the standard of the message raised high it's a thing sent to defeat Satan and his army the moment we start to drop the standard down amen Satan prevails amen and we read there in Isaiah 59 that he coming in like a flood Hallelujah now we know that when a flood comes it causes Devastation no matter what how secure your property is if there's a right amount of water coming in like a flood it can cause immense damage praise the Lord amen so the name Jehovah nii reminds us that we at War amen but we all also given a promise that we will win this war amen hallelujah so the at the outcome amen we will be Victors we will be victorious right we are declaring before time because we speak according to Romans 4:17 that Abraham believed God and he called those things which are not as though they are we Proclaim our victories beforehand amen amen we don't think what's going to happen we speak our Victory beforehand when we Face a giant amen like David we speak of Victory beforehand today I will give your head to the fouls of the air amen you speak your Victory beforehand amen so when we are facing sudden attacks and maybe we are prolonged sieges in our life the enemy is surrounded us we need to remember that we have authority over the spiritual Realms every one of us as Sons and Daughters of God have authority over the spiritual Realms of God that's what Ephesians is telling us we are now seated together in Heavenly places the bride is gathered on the sides of the north Hallelujah and it's a strategic point the sides of the north because the northern Army amen we know there are two armies in the north one is an invading Army coming to the sides of the north because he wants to sit upon the Mount of the congregation but the Army that's positioned there is positioned under a standard and under a banner praise the Lord so the battle we face can only be won with God's help amen we've got to remember that yes amen so the holy ghost at this time he's raising a standard in the hour hallelujah praise the Lord so like we said the standard or the banner must have significance because it must Inspire the Army no matter how battle scar they are along the way no matter how tired they are amen when they see that standard raised when they see that Banner raised something Rises up within them amen to make them push forward amen yes Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord It's a symbol of Hope in a time of war and it's a declaration of victory when territories are taken so we are moving the standard of the Kingdom forward as we advance the gates of hell and tear down Satan's kingdom amen and as God is opening up the Frontiers to us amen we must and we advancing the kingdom it's our duty to advance the kingdom of God but also to do it with humility amen we know the way up is the way down so we can't be boastful in our speech we speak with au Authority but amen We Are One People of humility hallelujah our speech should not be boastful there's got to come a progression of our Revelation amen so what I I saying we can't be stuck in the stage of diagnosis if we are doing spiritual Diagnostics the spiritual Diagnostics can't be a continual thing sir if you are diagnosing a car for something that's wrong you can't be satisfied with the diagnosis you've got to now repair the vehicle so how long are we going to be in a state of spiritual diagnosis amen so if if the spiritual diagnosis and through the preaching of the word is showing us where we are coming short amen we need to surrender in that area amen and Advance our growth in Jesus Christ all of us how to have a measuring St where we can measure our growth in Christ we can't be in the same place that we were 5 years ago 10 years ago or we can't be going in a worse of condition what is the level of our spiritual growth are we even concerned or do we even measure or track our spiritual growth according to the word of God or are we just satisfied with saying I'm a Christian and I come to church amen hallelujah now there are some things that a minister a pastor can't give to you via impartation if you come in the prayer line and you say pray for me brother pray for me Pastor amen I can't pray and in part I cannot lay my hands on you and pray for you to be able to pray more right if you have a desire to pray more you can't come in the prayer line here and say Pastor pray for me I desire to pray pray more I can't give that by impartation Praise the Lord if you desire to read the Bible more I cannot lay my hands on you to pray for you Lord help him read the Bible more praise the Lord I cannot pray for you to listen to more of the prophet's messages and tapes those things don't come by impartation amen These Are Spiritual disciplines amen amen that we must individually take be accountable for so you've got to be accountable for your own prayer life you've got to be accountable for your own Bible reading time your devotion time you've got to be accountable for the message of the hour amen hallelujah Glory turn to your neighbor and say be accountable praise the Lord we've got to be accountable now there's also something we can read the Bible to learn how to pray but at sometimes we've got to close the Bible and start to pray amen amen you can learn everything about prayer but if you never get down to praying it's meaningless amen so there comes a point in our time where we learn and we understand these principles that that prayer unlocks a realm Amen in the spiritual Dimension that it's our communication with the Unseen World and it's what brings our victories from The Unseen to the seen World our prayer life yes so we can't spend all our time learning to pray and never actually pray neither can I pray give me an appetite for the word Lord you can't spend all your time in prayer asking God to give you an appetite for the word at some point you got to stop praying and open the word and read it yes sir praise the Lord amen amen and I'm praying I'm challenging somebody here this morning especially the younger people because I know you don't read the messages I know you probably don't even read the Bible I know you probably don't even have a prayer life bless me Lord is not a prayer life help me Lord is not a prayer life amen hallelujah remember you're going to be accountable for your life Jesus at 12 years old told amen Mary and Joseph don't you know I must be about my father's business amen praise the Lord now we are so concerned about our boss's business amen we must be there at a certain time we must be there until a certain time we are so particular to follow the rules of work of school of college but when it comes to the rules that God has laid down in his word we have no regard for that yes sir which show shows us the fear of man is greater than the fear of God praise the Lord so we've got to watch amen our actions and what we are doing so these are spir key spiritual disciplines that are required for spiritual growth I was listening to a minister he's probably late 70s or 80 years old and this this man is interviewing him and he said if there was one thing you could give an advice to the younger you what would you do he says now that you have a PhD and all of these things he said now he answers it this way he says if I told you you probably wouldn't even believe me he said I wouldn't even go to Seminary I wouldn't even go to a Bible school I would just read my Bible and pray thank you amen he says I would just read my Bible and pray to grow in Christ now you see we want complicated things but you can do it in the comfort of your home you can read your Bible and pray praise the Lord to grow spiritually Hallelujah so if you want to pray what must we do we must make time to pray more if we want to spend time with the word of God we must make time to spend with the word of God am and it can't be that we are getting upset with the pastor or the ministry amen who are preaching the gospel and they are speaking the truth in love yes we get upset with what they are saying but they're trying to build up your morals trying to build up your character in Christ if you read Ephesians 4:11 he'll tell you exactly what the fold Ministry is designed to do yes amen so what we've got to do if you're studying that scripture you've got to maximize and and draw everything that they are supposed to bring to you am how come we getting upset with a Ministry that is trying to build you up but Hollywood who is tearing down morals you don't speak against that yeah amen Hollywood has spped the morals of people those of you that grew up in the 50s and 60s and 70s you would know that this is the most immoral time and age that we are living in now amen things that maybe we think are common like indecency and women dressed indecently those things were unheard of back then what caused it the television because it desensitized the people woman sleeping around with few men it became glamorous they threw it out in the movies and they corrupted the morals but nobody speaks out against that but you speak out against the minister that he is too and he's speaking on you but you're not speaking out against them that they are tearing down my morals Lord that they they are taking my time that I I can't spend 5 minutes reading the Bible but I can spend an hour watching my series I can spend an hour watching a movie amen I don't complain about that I complain that the preacher is too long yes but I complain the series is finished where I'm going to get the next episode from amen oh help us amen yes sir we can even go to friends with a hard drive I don't know if we use hard drives anymore now amen but you know what I mean go to download the movies onto that thing because you must stockpile you must get your stash but the stockpile the word of God we don't want it that's right we don't reach out to our friend brother amen hallelujah let's read the Bible let's let's you see what you drew from that scripture I'll read the same scripture I'll see what I drew from it we can compare notes yes amen amen we don't get upset with our favorite sport they lose but you still support them Hallelujah you blame everyone else for their loss too you blame the referee you blame this you blame that you are what am I saying you are raising the standard of your defense over your team but God has called you into the army of Jesus Christ am how about you raise the standard for the kingdom of God Amen now if we can be so particular about those things Hallelujah we tell everyone who we support maybe not sure you don't go around telling people you're a Liverpool supporter you're a man united supporter amen you support rugby or you support Cricket whatever it is amen people are so particular they want to be identified with that especially when it's winning anybody know what I'm talking about you are proud to be associated with that team when it's winning I am saying the team of Jesus Christ is the winning team amen be proud to be associated with Jesus Christ be as proud to be associated with the message of the hour amen it's the only Army advancing and is winning right now oh yes amen praise the Lord yes Lord amen you can read Ephesians 4 read it from verse 11 because you'll see you can't come to perfection without the fivefold that's Bible you can't come into Unity of faith without the fivefold that's Bible go read it and you can't come into the full measure of the statue of Jesus Christ without the fivefold read it it's there yes amen so if you are think you're going to come into the statue of a perfect man without the fivefold you are bypassing scripture you are bypassing protocol and God won't deviate from his word yes amen hallelujah let's move on Amen Hallelujah so we find it's a very inspiring name the name of Jehovah nii the Lord is our Banner amen the name is mentioned we know there in Exodus chapter 17 and Moses there Builds an altar amen and as we explore this we find amen that this that refers to a flag or a standard that is raised above the troops in battle amen now I want to stress this point that it served as a rallying point for soldiers and when they saw the standard raised how many of you have you seen aen in Array ready now to advance but did you notice right in the front they have standards raised flags raised Hallelujah so we can raise the the banner of Jehovah nii amen and trust that God is with us fighting our battles on our behalf amen the banner is reminding us that we are not alone when they saw Moses hands raised as long as those fighting down saw Moses hands raised they were courageous in battle amen they drew strength from seeing Moses hand is raised amen yes thank you [Music] Lord we find that the flag is a sign of commitment we find people can pledge they'll stand up they'll put their hand over their heart and they'll pledge allegiance to that standard that's right to the flag amen they're so patriotic they'll even cry yes they'll even weep you know the prophet talks about that one man that he was with there what this amus parade amus parade and now he's he stood there so proud that his King was going to go by and the prophet says he watched this man and when the king went by he saw tears running down his cheeks and he told the prophet that's my king he said if if that will do that to a man gr man how much more the King of Kings am and the Lord of lords amen Lord amen amen praise the Lord so we are declaring our Allegiance now to the King of Kings amen we are acknowledging of his faithfulness towards us we know that he will never leave us nor forsake us even in the toughest time amen turn to Song of Solomon there amen chap chapter 2 hallelujah amen Song of Solomon Chapter 2:4 amen now I want you to know that this was an exess the prophet of God says it there you know we read this quote before that when he revealed the seals he opened up unto us a new l land a new spiritual Frontier untouched territory everybody understanding nobody else knew what the seals meant but the the seals were revealed to the prophet and it opened up a new land a new frontier and he invited us and the Book of Solomon says that he brought us to the banqueting house amen and His Banner over me was love amen thank you amen I don't know about you but the Capstone is love when you're growing up in the Statue of a perfect man the Capstone coming to cap the Pyramid of your life is Charity which is love amen so he's bringing you amen into the full opening of the word and he's raising a standard he's raising a n over you and then n is love amen thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you amen we find here that N is a call to action and courage we find that the banner also represents power presence and protection over God's people in a time of uncertainty we can raise the banner of love we can raise the banner of Christ over our situations amen amen hallelujah we find here you know when when the when Japan inv uh attacked USA there you find there's a famous picture of these men six men placing the flag it's a very iconic photo you must have seen it on a on a Japanese island because this was going to be the point amen the Strategic point where amen they needed an air base and they they placed a flag there Hallelujah it was going to be a rallying point amen that they were going to launch an attack to the enemy we find here amen that we find that the children of Israel were camped on the southern border the eastern border the Western border and the northern border but each one of them were camped under a banner am each one of them were camped under a standard that was raised yes amen hallelujah they were camped under the banner of a lion under the banner of a ox under the banner amen of a man but I want you to know that it was upon the northern border come on on the sides of the north that Dan raised the banner of an eagle yes amen it's a it's a strategic Place amen that Dan raised the banner of an eagle on the sides of the north amen amen each one camped with the standard amen hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord you know around that's that's the the prophet says that they the Lord positioned them strategically in the land because they were following a pattern after Heaven yes amen and we didn't know what that meant Hallelujah until we go and we catch a glimpse of Revelation 4 and go into five you see that surrounding the throne yes amen so they were following in Heavenly pattern following the throne amen guarding the throne with these four beasts amen the lion the ox the man and the eagle and in the center of the throne was God Almighty amen so in the center of their camping amen there was God in the midst of Israel that's why we read there God is in the midst of her amen God is in the midst of his people now amen amen God is Raising now Dan in the tower to raise up the pan of an eagle to make strategic military attacks amen Lord hallelujah you seen Israel took out the leader of AAS amen and if you read there they say it was reservist and trainees that took him out right Hallelujah it was re reservist and trainees so it doesn't matter how young you are yes it doesn't matter how young you are in the kingdom of God you can take out head demons amen amen what's what's required is you to understand that you're a Son of God am that you are backed by this Banner when you fight under this Banner all of Heaven is backing you up you are not alone y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me Hallelujah sir amen you know why you have no fear amen why God has taken out all fear amen perfect love has come to take away all fear amen so so you can say it another way David was saying I I don't fear to be conquered because I am already conquered Christ has conquered me God has conquered my heart already so I have no need to fear that's right amen how many you can say God has conquered you yes that you don't hold any reservation Nations amen you don't hold any place in your heart where somebody else has conquered you amen the world hasn't conquered you but Christ has conquered you and he's taken away all fear praise the Lord amen so we're finding here that we know now that uh Israel in in natural he typing his spiritual Israel but I want you to know when when they went out this one unit and one Army all four standards came together as one Army amen they didn't fight amen separately when Israel was going out to make battle with the Enemy all four banners became one Banner amen and they represented one Lord yeah oh Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen now we we've been saying that we've never lived in such a time where there's been so much of Comforts in latest here and so much of challenges we know that we are under attack Israel and the naturally saying we are fighting on seven fronts spiritual Israel is also fighting on all seven fronts amen amen there's an attack to get you to doubt but you got to fight to keep the faith amen amen the Apostle Paul says we must contend for the faith amen you under attack to SLP you of your virtue that's right but you've got to guard that border of virtue you're under attack amen so while you are guarding Faith you've got to guard virtue yes amen Satan wants Amen to attack your knowledge knowledge of the Son of God yes amen so while you are protecting virtue and Faith you've got to protect knowledge you can go on and on Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity the Bride of Jesus Christ he's fighting on all seven fronts amen wanting to keep all seven virtues because she knows when her husband comes back if one of those coins is lost amen yes he will put her away but she's got to sweep the house amen she's got to call the neighbors and everybody to say come help me find my lost coin amen amen thank you Lord praise the Lord thank you Jesus so in the midst of us fighting on multiple fronts amen the Lord made us a promise that when the enemy is coming in like a flood the Lord will raise up a standard against it amen hallelujah so we find 963 the opening of The Seven Seals it was to issue a call a rallying point amen for sons of God Amen to come together 1963 was no ordinary time the prophet says I've waited all my life for this so it was a I'm said the banner now waights raised the emblem raised it's a rallying point it's also showing you where the commander is it puts confidence in the troops to know that the commander is in the battle with them so that's why he descends amen hallelujah the mighty Angel descends with a out with the voice of the Archangel praise the Lord and he coming in a time of military setting beasts are rising from the sea beasts are rising from the earth amen swars are blowing upon the Earth but the angels are holding back to winds amen and the mighty Angel is suppressing these two powers that are trying to defeat God's people on the Earth it's a time of War but the captain of the host has come down in a ring point and the message is to shout amen yes to call you to this Battleground thank you Lord praise the Lord amen so we know that God sent the shout message to gather the living Saints to raise the standard via the message of the hour and we are on a mission Amen to answer now amen hallelujah in all areas of Our Lives we are answering the devil's question yes am amen how are we answering it is written we are answering every one of his questions just like how Jesus defeated Satan amen amen we are defeating the enemy why we are built on the word we stand on the word we speak the word amen we are the word made flesh Hallelujah so no matter how Satan question us did God say this we say Satan it is written am praise the Lord hallelujah amen let's find this quote Amen in the Rapture message there amen for those of you that maybe want to find this in the message let's just read it out of the Rapture message there amen praise the Lord where he's talking about what is a shout now he said that Revelation 10 was a strategic rallying point praise the Lord a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth amen first the living Bread of Life Giving bringing forth the bride so the message of the hour came to bring forth the bride amen let's go on now God has promised to send that again in the last days to bring the bride out of that ecclesiastical mess in the only way it can be done hallelujah so okay this sounds like I am the way the truth and the life amen no man comes to to the father but through me it says it's the only way yes there's no other denominational way he's doing it to Shout by the only way it can be done amen and I want to say the only way can be done is revelation 81 Under The Silence of that seven seal because Revelation 10 is the setting of that seven seal can you say Amen to that so there's only one way it can be done praise the Lord that is why this this becomes a banner that's raised over us a standard that's raised Hallelujah this drives fear Into the Heart of the enemy because this brought Revelation T to life and I saw another Mighty Angel and he was clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was about his head yes his feet was as pillars of fire his face Shone like the sun thank you Lord amen and when he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Rose seven Thunders uttered their voices what were they thundering out a message going forth to call out a bride a rallying point amen yes the only way it can be done amen next one praise the Lord the first thing comes when he is descending from the heaven there's a shout what is it is a message to get the people together a message comes forth first amen amen now if he the first there there must be something else that follows right otherwise you'll put a full stop you won't say first Hallelujah so amen that's where we just want to read there to show you that the shout message the message of the hour the message that came by William brandom is to gather you to a rallying point in the fight is to let you know that the captain of the host has come down amen and his weighs the standarded over us Amen to tell us we are now in the final stretch thank you Lord now very quickly I want to say this probably I can use maybe two minutes for this when someone is in a relay a relay is very important for all four members of that relay team to work together each one must pass the Baton to to the other one and they must do it flawlessly if they want to win yes there can't be any stumbles upon the passing of the Bon yes sir there can't be any fumblings Hallelujah right but what if you drop the Baton what if you drop it you can either choose to get out of the race because you feel like it's too much to catch gain ground or if the Baton is dropped you can pick it up and continue the race yes amen right or there's another option the Baton is dropped you can keep running but there's a consequence to that you are disqualified that's right meaning you can't finish this race without picking up from the one that have gone before brother brandom says you find out where you left him where the Baton was dropped Even in our own lives every one of us if there's a spiritual lack you go back and Trace back where you left Jesus Christ but you've got to go back to that point yes sir if you want to continue the race and not get disqualified you've got to get to that point pick it up and run the race with patience amen why there are rules to the game The Prophet says there's rules to the game there's rules to the fight you know there's Rules of Engagement you can't just go and shoot anywhere there's rules to war praise the Lord amen and we are in a fight amen together to occupy advance and take back the territory of the kingdom of God the Bible declares that the Kingdom of Heaven suffer with violence yes amen amen and the violent are taken by force praise the Lord so the Bible says it this way in Mark 16 that these signs these standards shall follow them that believe am I'm raising up standards Amen in this hour in this time to the Believers I'm raising up signs which means I'm raising up a standard praise the lord lord a standard for the sick is what I'm raising a standard of healing Rafa is coming in on the scene as I raise my standard as I raise my banner over the sick healing is there amen but it's it's there for the believer these sign shall follow them that believe amen the standard amen is the name of Jesus Christ amen this is no ordinary name this is Yeshua Yeshua hamashiach amen hallelujah No Ordinary name there are many names on the Earth but they is the name that God Almighty chose the father of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you as a father maybe you chose the name of your child but this was no ordinary father choosing a name for No Ordinary sonjah unto us his child is given unto us a son is born praise the Lord the father of Glory chosen the name for his son amen amen praise the Lord Oh Glory glory glory glory amen scripture coming to mind I must get to it amen hallelujah if the spirit is bringing something to mind we must get to it amen let's go to John chapter praise the Lord let me find it first Hallelujah is he worthy of Praise amen amen amen amen our God is a good God Amen thank you Lord hallelujah praise the lord lord just want to find this very quickly amen if I can find it here I've just got the scripture in my mind let's go to John chapter 6 hallelujah amen so here in John chapter 6 we find here there's many portions of the scripture that we can read here you find in chapter 6 verse1 they he feeds the 5,000 amen and then in from verse 15 onwards we find that he's walking on water so these are the miraculous things that Jesus is doing amen hallelujah so we find here from verse 22 onwards they come looking for him and Jesus is telling them you don't seek me because you saw the Miracles but because you didn't eat the loaves [Music] right so yeah in verse 20 29 they ask or 28 they say what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus said answered and said to them this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he had sent right so they're asking him for his sign and they saying our fathers did it man in the desert so they are still after the bread you can see all the lines of questioning they still want physical bread Hallelujah so I want to get to a point here where the Jew in 41 the Jews then mmed him saying I am the bread of life which came down from heaven amen and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he say I came down from heaven so Jesus is showing his identification that he's the son of God praise the Lord m not amongst yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which had sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and as and they shall be taught of God every man thereof that ha heard had learned of the father cometh unto me amen amen so the point I want to get to here is I'll find the verse now this thing just came on the top of my head I can't find the exact verse but they are questioning Jesus how can you say that God is your father praise the Lord they want to know how can can you say that God is your father because if you say God is your father you are saying you are God because God can't give I have a son and the son be a monkey a monkey has an offspring it's a monkey a dog has an offspring it's a dog so they are questioning Jesus there and they want to know if you are saying God is your father what are you trying to tell us amen hallelujah amen now I'm saying this people here who are raising up to say God is their father Yes hallelujah amen if you are saying God is your father what does it really mean does it mean you are made in His image and likeness hello yes amen does it mean we were made in His image and likeness amen so the F I'm trying to show you that the father chose Jesus to display himself a human Veil but the standard has been been moved because the father has now chosen you yeah amen and the Holy Ghost is Raising you as the standard in this hour yes amen now you can't run away from that that's right if you are called to the running point where you've been called under the Shar message he's called you here for a reason amen now maybe some people misunderstood us I'm going to say it again that he wants to reveal his glory through you and in you now don't mistake that with Glory as in meaning the Praises Adoration of God no we are talking about the glory the sh Glory being revealed to you so that he can get the glory amen sometime when we say he will share his glory with no we're not talking about that we are talking about the visible manifest presence the Holy Ghost the sh of Glory coming into you and making you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you become a Holy Ghost yes you become a holy ghost son a holy ghost son and daughter of God praise the Lord amen so when we are saying that his glory is fully revealed through us we are the Temple of the Living God Amen we carrying within us Shak of Glory that God has clothed himself with us amen come on say Amen somebody don't run away from this truth right God is clothing himself with you oh yes God wants to show his glory through you you do you know that's his highest amen his highest form of what he's working to achieve in redemption's plan if fully expressed himself through Jesus Christ now he wants to fully Express himself through his bright body oh come on somebody say Amen better than that amen stop thinking about what you must surrender and Just Surrender amen yes I told you stop thinking about praying and pray stop thinking yes I will surrender and Just Surrender yes amen amen Satan will have you in that holding pattern to say okay let's negotiate around this you can surrender this surrender that but don't do this no stop negotiating with the Enemy amen there shall be no peace negotiations yeah there shall be no peace deals there shall be no treaties there shall be no compromise we will stand on every word of God Amen so yeah the father chose the name for Jesus and the name would represent his character now God is not known as just Jehovah nii or Jehovah Rafa or Jehovah Shalom or Jehovah amen Gyra but all seven compound names were locked up in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we know that amen this is the most exalted name it's the most magnified name it's the sweetest name amen amen it's the most powerful name demons tremble at this name hallelujah praise the Lord amen it's the name above every other name amen the name that not only in heaven but also in Earth Hallelujah the Bible says that the whole family in heaven is named after the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are you identified with that name amen and the Bible declares that everything in heaven and everything in Earth shall bow to that name hallu so God has raised the name as a standard amen oh Church of God let's just get to this point and God Jesus Christ has a bride and that bride has his name and you've got to recognize who you are you can't say we're in adoption time and never take control of the father's business amen come on now you've got to start to take authority over spiritual Realms you've got to take author over the principalities and Powers amen rulers of darkness and cast down imaginations and pull down strongholds in the Kingdom God has raised you up for this purpose to defeat the enemy God is going to show Satan amen I've got a bright body on the earth amen hallelujah and they're not going to do it by power not by might but by the spirit of God Amen when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord will raise up a standard amen yes Lord Lord praise the Lord amen so the standard over a sick person is the standard of healing raer the standard over somebody that is lost is standard of Salvation amen the standard over those that are bound and lost is the standard of Deliverance the standard over those amen that are in sin is the blood of Jesus Christ because what can wash away my sin amen nothing but the blood of Jesus Amen somebody say wash me now Lord Jesus amen if you know there sin hanging you over your life amen say Wash Me In The Blood amen hallelujah precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other Fountain I know nothing but the blood of Jesus Amen the blood of Jesus this SE is our Banner amen we find amen after four Church ages I'm closing now amen after four Church ages amen I had gone forth the church was all but dead the the Catholic church had gone out in a deception right and the church was like almost dead Tian Church age praise the Lord amen but the Lord declared in the word I will restore say the Lord amen oh be thankful for the spirit of his son the Bible declares if that same spirit that Rose Jesus from the dead dwells in you it will also Quicken your mortal body so the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Resurrection thank you because you are s God had sent forth the spirit of his son two sons God had sent the Holy Ghost which is the spirit of Resurrection he said because he raised Jesus from the dead because that Spirit has come upon you you shall not die but you shall live yes amen thank you Lord so the church the enemy thought after four amen after the fourth ride that he had the church but God raised up a standard Hallelujah God raised up a standard called Luther to hold the banner the standard amen the N of justification amen than you Lord praise the Lord they were they were taking money from the people and they were charging them penants and amen and charging them amen for purgatory and and all of these things all these rituals not found in the word of God and one day the Lord opens up this word to lther and he says the just shall live by faith amen the Lord raising up a standard amen praise the Lord amen but you can't look past the veil if you want to ident if you want to acknowledge the work of justification you can't look past Luther that's right amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen do you hear what I'm saying God's Avenue God's ambassadors are men yes amen hallelujah God's ambassadors are always men you can't have justification without Luther you've got to identify Luther as the man that God raised up to hold up the standard of justification God's not in the business of bypassing the many he used right hallelujah amen you know why we pray that way too because we heard somebody else pray it Lord I don't want to take this man out the way Lord the man go out the way are you going to he preaching you heard somebody say that in their prayer and you thought it sounds nice so you prayed Hallelujah you know many of our prayers are denominational prayers we heard it like passed down we got to pray with Revelation amen pray with understanding amen so God raised up the standard of Luther but when Luther had raised the standard and he moved the standard forward as much as he could because you know they denominated amen if you can find that quote they were uh in the San Church age if you have got it there God used him to bring the people God's standard against works so God was using Luther to raise a standard against Works yes the just shall live by faith at first he had been so gentle so Fearless so patient constantly waiting on God to work out the problems but then vast numbers began to come to his Banner see they were coming to the standard that he was raising their purpose was not a truly spiritual one rather they had political motivations they order to break the Yoke of the Pope they dislike sending money to Rome Fanatics rose up soon he was dragged into Political Affairs and decisions that actually lay outside the realm of the church except that the church through prayer preaching and conduct might set up a standard to be heeded amen these problems of political politics mounted until he was forced into an untenable position of mediating between Lords and peasants his decisions were so wrong that an uprising took place and thousands were killed he meant well but once he had let himself be entangled again in a church State gospel he had to reap the worldwind that's in the San Church age so Luther was meant to raise the standard of justification and move it forward as much as he could yes sir because his advancing the kingdom and when he moved it as much as he could God raised up Wesley Amen to raise up another standard amen the standard of sanctification the blood of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah and then when when when Wesley had raised up the standard of sanctification and he moved it as far as he could God raised up William sour and the early isua sweet Revival the early Pentecostal sweet Revival to raise the standard of the Holy Ghost outpouring with the restoration of the gifts to the church amen and then they started to move out and move out and take the battle forward sir take the standard forward Take N forward amen and we know the standard Banner raised amen hallelujah can cause reputational damage you know what's reputational damage most time when you say the word reputational damage you look at it I'm causing reputational damage upon myself no but I'm saying your reputation will cause damage upon the enemy's territory what is that knowing who you are I don't have time to go into the quote the prophet says when you know who you are Satan becomes powerless before you meaning that your reputation and knowing who you are he rendering this devil powerless and you are causing reputational damage by knowing who you are praise the the Lord go quickly they will find reputational damage Joshua chapter 2 amen let's read it from the Bible you'll know what I'm talking about your name can go before you and you can cause fear into the ARs of the enemy Joshua chapter 2:8 it says before the spies laay down for the night Rahab went up to the roof and said to them I know the Lord had given you this land and the fear of you has fallen on us so that all dwell in the land are melting in fear of you amen amen amen meaning when you walk demons will be asked to be please let me go into these Peaks why have you come to torment us amen you must see it manifest in your life amen why you think they couldn't even stand the shadow of Peter yes demons couldn't even stand the shadow of Peter how many of you want to say Lord anoint me so much amen that demons can't even stand my shadow yes Lord thank amen he says the everyone in the land now when they saying all who dwell in the land meaning they King as well fear has fallen on us so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the Waters of the Red Sea before you you see past experiences are driving fear into their hearts so what am i showing you here if the enemy knows in this day that you are following the message of William brandham and you are coming after his message and you are bringing the banner forward they know how William brandham cast them out and if you are carrying the message forward amen fear struck their heart knowing you carry the same message amen amen so the message becomes your standard Bearer hallelujah amen praise the Lord thank you Lord how you dried up the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to sonon and OG and the two kings of the amorites across the Jordan whom you devoted into destruction when we heard this our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you for the Lord your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below go to 24 then the Lord had surely delivered the entire land into our hands I want to say that is a prophetic word over the people of God hallelujah that the Lord has surely delivered the entire land am into our hands amen thank you Lord amen indeed all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of us amen thank you Lord so to surrender means you lose all your rights and and you get another set of rights do you know that think of it this way if you are a prisoner of war you lose all your rights but you follow another set of rights which is a prisoner of war rights you are you are governed under those treaties remember the Rules of Engagement we're talking about if you capture a prison of War he must be treated certain certain way praise the Lord so now when we surrender to the kingdom of heaven we surrendering our rights and we take on another set of Rights the rights to the kingdom of heaven the rights to Revelation the rights to sanctification the rights to justification amen let's move here amen so what is re doing she's revealing the condition of the men's heart in Jericho the banner of the name that went before struck fear to the men of Jericho but their pride didn't cause them to surrender they fortified themselves around walls wall so wide that they could have chariot races wall so wide that the Bible says Rab's house was built in of those walls amen wall so wide that they started to have conventions and they started to have meeting after meeting amongst those walls that they built sir that nobody can fellowship with them they've got camps right walls walled in cities but the Lord's army is here to pull down all the walls hallelujah amen praise the Lord thank you Lord so God is going to prove that these walls are no match for the standard he was Raising Israel's Army so they had to March once around the city seven times amen six times they they marched once but on the seventh day they did it differently on the seventh day they marched seven times around that wall and the priests were blowing the Rams on and they were moving through the land amen they were blowing the Rams on and it says when they blew the Rams on on the seventh day alone they had to give a shout amen amen hallelujah amen I'm afraid if some of you were there on that day you wouldn't have shouted amen how do I know you don't shout in church you can't say Amen if if Joshua gave the command on the seventh day when you hear the trumpet blow and you hear the the trumpet amen the priest blow the arms I want you to shout Victory some of you said victory victory I don't know if you know a shout is no ordinary projection a shout hallelujah it's from the depth of you it it tore down the walls of Jericho what was God showing you he was raising up a standard of Praise that my when you praise my name amen and you follow the word the Kingdom of Heaven the walls of Jericho must come down I'm asking you what has walled you in has sickness walled you in has disease walled you in amen as a situation walled you in start to shout the Praises of God let Jericho's walls come down this morning amen amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord the banner over us is the cross of Jesus Christ the banner over us is love amen praise the Lord so we know amen yeah let's let's find that quote improving his word want to close now with this amen I got two quotes to close on uh I'm I'm being very honest with you it's two very short quotes amen praise the Lord it says because you see that's the one I want to go to amen I want to show you as the word of God has come to give us knowledge Amen in this hour God needs a higher standard that's what the prophet is trying to say here amen it's improving his word amen hallelujah it says because you see sin wasn't known then like it is now and when we got more knowledge now than we had then and when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it and now today we got more knowledge more understanding so the rivers of unbelief is flowing in hard so the there are more rivers of unbelief flowing in hard the standard must be raised a greater standard I don't have time to read the fourth seal there but the writer is coming with a stand standard of death his name is called death he's got a standard of death and he's riding through the land people are spiritually dead and don't know it but he says when now when the when the when the rivers of unbelief is flowing in hard God will raise up a higher standard amen aren't you glad that you are part of the standard yes amen amen so the stronger they attack the greater the standard the stronger they attack the greater the retaliation amen I want to let you know Israel has a right to defend itself I'm talking about spiritual Israel you have a right to defend yourself you don't have to take every attack the enemy is bringing against you you have a right to defend yourself all of hell has been let loose but the standard raised is all of Heaven has come down and not only that sons of God are coming into the position as gods of the earth we are taking back what is rightfully ours amen let's go to that question what was the Holy Ghost given for amen we're closing now with this and you'll see how we are going to close up the Gentile dispensation God is an pict you to close out the just Gentile dispensation amen than you Lord and the quote back there amen some of you who keep saying these things I want you to I want you to reference this because some of you believe that people back then were much smarter than us today but here what the prophet of God is saying back there they wasn't half as smart as today they they couldn't make an atomic bomb or any or an automobile they didn't have signs and things as we have now right amen so all of everyone of you that quote those things qu that quote right yeah the prophet is saying they Wen as smart as they are today as science increases we got to increase in our Revelation as well right they didn't have signs and things as we have now but and the things of mysterious things to try and say man blow together by some dust and so forth and take some analysis and try to prove it to make infidels out of people but now what we need the spirit of God raises a standard what is it is pouring in his spirit so the standard is you receiving the Holy Ghost everybody understanding that he's going to pour His Spirit upon you right for what he doesn't just pour for nothing he doesn't call you to the railing point for nothing watch what he's going to do what is it he's pouring in his Spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave now he's telling you someone else is depending on you those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar of God as the scriptures are crying how long Lord how long how much longer God is waiting on me and you amen tell your neighbor God is waiting on you quickly now tell him come on wake up arise shine God is waiting on you amen quick la la I don't know how to say it properly IA Happ me amen a right shine means to awaken thank you Lord God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into to us his fullness amen oh right there I'm you to say Lord pour to me your fullness right his power how many of you want his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible amongst us and raises the dead and we go into the Rapture amen I believe we on that now God I want you to know as I close now God has raised you as a standard hallelujah hallelujah every one of you is being raised as a standard you are God's Banner that he is raising amen God is raising a standard against the enemy and don't let the enemy tell you you are insignificant you are a standard in this hour the prophet says in another message God has called you to light up the age to light up your neighborhood to light up your school to light up your college to light up your workplace you are the standard that's being raised Hallelujah that when people see you they'll say there's a true Christian they'll take note that you have been with Jesus let's stand give him praise give him praise amen hallelujah the Holy Ghost has raised the standard amen and that standard is Holy Ghost fill Sons and Daughters of God Amen you are not not insignificant you are not worthless good for nothing God has a specific plan for you hallelujah amen amen glory thank you Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Name what a powerful name amen the name of Jesus demons tremble at that name amen glory amen come on anoint your faith now get into a time of worship amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's time to Worship the Lord time to give him Glory time to give him honor
