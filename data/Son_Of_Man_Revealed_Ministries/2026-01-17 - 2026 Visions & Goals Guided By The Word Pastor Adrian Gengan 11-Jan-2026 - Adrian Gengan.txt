TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We anointed you with oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we prayed over you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So all of those things carry a significance and there's a blessing attached to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason why we did that is because the anointing breaks the yoke of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were trying to awaken in you that there's an anointing in you that you're carrying right now. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The oil is not on the outside. &gt;&gt; The oil is on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. It has moved from natural light to to candle light and it has now become shakana glory light inside of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. This gospel has not been stagnant. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The gospel has progressed. The gospel has moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh some of the brothers were just sharing with me. Amen. That they were blessed with last week's service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they have a new vigor and a new Amen. &gt;&gt; faith for the year ahead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you this morning &gt;&gt; and uh keep you as we go around the word of God and see what he has in store for us this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I can't meet the need of everyone here. It's only the Holy Spirit that can. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the way you touch God is through faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the way you reach out by faith is to have an expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; So if we have zero expectation, we're not going to get anything out of the service. But if our heart is full of expectancy, we're going to receive maximum benefit this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, let's stand together for the reading of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Joshua chapter 1. Last week, we read a quote and we we were reading how God has new promises for each new year. Now, as we are reading this, bear in mind that there's a progression. When God is finished with one ministry, he continues &gt;&gt; his plan. &gt;&gt; God is a God of a plan. God is a God of a goal and we were created in his image and likeness. &gt;&gt; So we are people with a plan and we are people with a goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are people of dominion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it says here Joshua 1:1. Now after the death of Moses, the Lord as the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister, saying, &gt;&gt; Moses, my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan thou and all thy this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; So it's God who has a goal to move the people along. &gt;&gt; They may have wanted to mourn Moses' death. They may have wanted to denominate around Moses, &gt;&gt; but God is now going to bring them into the land that he had promised them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And watch when God has a goal and a vision in mind for your life, he is already attaching a promise. And he says, "Every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, &gt;&gt; that have I given unto you, &gt;&gt; as I said unto Moses, &gt;&gt; you &gt;&gt; God told brother Brandham, there's going to be a super church, a super race." As he told the prophet, he says, "I'm going to give it to you. I'm going to make you that super church, the super race. I'm going to make you that invincible army. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he marks out his borders and his boundaries from the wilderness and this Lebanon unto the great river, the river Euphrates, the land of the Itites, even the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your coast. &gt;&gt; There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses, &gt;&gt; as I was with brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Nor forsake thee. &gt;&gt; Be strong and of a good courage. For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, &gt;&gt; our inheritance is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Which I swear unto their fathers should give them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only be thou strong, &gt;&gt; be and very courageous, that thou mayest to observe to do according to all the law which my servant Moses commanded thee. Turn not to it from the right hand or the left, that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, notice the prosperity is going to come because we are in the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Lord is telling Joshua. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you've got to put your foot. &gt;&gt; He says, "Everywhere you place your foot, &gt;&gt; you're going to prosper." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if Joshua stayed still, not moving his foot, &gt;&gt; Amen. He wouldn't have walked and marked out his prosperity. &gt;&gt; You got to move your feet and start to march forward. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the key here. The book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth, &gt;&gt; the age of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; But thou shalt meditate therein day and night. Why? In order to speak the word, you got to know the word. &gt;&gt; In order to know the word, you must meditate on the word. &gt;&gt; That thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. Then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and have a good courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee. I'll say now he's in thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whethersoever thou goest. Praise the Lord. The Lord had blessings reading of his word. Before you are seated, one more portion of scripture in Habacook chapter 2. Praise the Lord. Verse two. And the Lord answered me and said, "Write the vision. Make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie. Though it tar, wait for it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wait, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. &gt;&gt; The Lord had blessings to reading of his word. You may be seated. Hallelujah. So I'm speaking on visions this morning. Your goals and faith in the word. So your visions and your choices in this life now are going to be guided by the word. &gt;&gt; Has to be guided by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word is wisdom. &gt;&gt; You know the beginning of the year we have lots of goals. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lots of things we want to achieve. &gt;&gt; Yes. But very few people by the second or third week those things are gone away. They cast it away and they settle into the old routine of life. But in order to be able to achieve what we need to achieve, we've got to be persistent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even here in Abacook, the Lord is telling him, "Write the vision because you're going to forget about it." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But write it and put it somewhere where you can see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. M &gt;&gt; bring it to your memory all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only to your memory, whoever is going to read the vision may understand it clearly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your parents can understand what your goals are, what your vision is. Everyone who's reading it will understand it. And he says, "WAIT FOR IT." THOUGH IT TAR, wait for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So God has a unique design for each one of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is not building RDP houses. We all look the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what RDP houses are? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lowcost housing. &gt;&gt; No, you are not a lowcost housing. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; You are the tabernacle, the temple of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a mansion. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That is fully furnished. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes I may step away from the notes, but I just want to speak as the spirit leads. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your mansion fully furnished. &gt;&gt; And your furnishing is from faith to charity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS A FULLY FURNISHED HOUSE, A MANSION. &gt;&gt; YES. that he is now dwelling in. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're in lack of nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We go TO THE LIVING ROOM, IT'S FULLY FURNISHED. &gt;&gt; WE GO TO THE BEDROOM, IT'S FULLY FURNISHED. &gt;&gt; WE GO TO THE KITCHEN, IT'S FULLY FURNISHED. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS NOT LEFT THIS church unfernished. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has a fully furnished mansion and he's given it US THROUGH THE OPENING OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So the design for each one of our lives defer. &gt;&gt; We don't measure our life based on somebody else. &gt;&gt; If God is blessing them, praise the Lord for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God is working ON ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS A plan for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know the plans I have for you. Say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Plans to give you a hope and a future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are unique. The Bible says we are fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we can't base our lives on somebody else like I was saying because God may have designed your life to reach one soul, &gt;&gt; but he may have designed the next life to reach millions of souls. That's right. &gt;&gt; But as long AS WE FULFILL OUR PURPOSE, IF GOD'S purpose designed is to reach one soul for Christ &gt;&gt; and we achieve that, THEN WE HAVE FULFILLED OUR PURPOSE IN LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But if God has designed us for to reach 10,000 souls, we must also achieve that purpose in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. Praise the Lord. So when we are starting to have goals and visions, we've got to see it in the mind's eye first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to be seen and envisioned in the mind's eye &gt;&gt; before it can start to manifest in the reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO EVERY DETAIL, YOU'VE GOT TO THINK IT IN THE MIND'S eye first. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't just speak things and not give the detail. Right? &gt;&gt; God didn't speak things in Genesis and not give the detail. &gt;&gt; Everybody agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're trusting the Lord for a wife for a husband, WELL, TELL HIM WHAT KIND OF A WIFE YOU WANT. WHAT KIND of a husband you want? &gt;&gt; A God-fearing husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A God-fearing wife. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Describe them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. be specific about what we are asking the LORD FOR. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS VERY SPECIFIC IN GENESIS 1. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; And when we come to verse 26, he says, "I'm going to create a man IN MY IMAGE WHO'S ALSO GOING TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ABOUT THEIR GOALS AND THEIR PURPOSES. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, by now, we ought to be mature sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not now where God is restoring the church through justification. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we are past that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are mature sons and daughters OF GOD WHERE GOD can have confidence in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God can say, "THIS IS MY BELOVED SON. THIS IS MY BELOVED daughter in whom I am well pleased to dwell in." &gt;&gt; Because God wants to fulfill his plan through our lives. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have complete confidence knowing that God's word cannot fail. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We must set the word of God at our forefront in 2026. &gt;&gt; We have got to be guided BY THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD THAT IT WILL NEVER FAIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now, we we are we are conscious of the harmony that exists between the father and me. &gt;&gt; The father and you. You've got to be conscious of the harmony that's existing between you and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The harmony THAT GOD CAN DWELL IN US. A people called and chosen for his name. A people in whom he can have the preeminence. A people who can give God first place in everything. And who puts GOD FIRST IN EVERY DECISION. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Christ is in the forefront of OUR THOUGHTS. THE WORD is in the forefront of our our being, our soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our thoughts and actions are not shaped and governed by the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. The world doesn't set the standard for us. &gt;&gt; We don't FASHION OURSELVES AFTER THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; We don't dress like the world. &gt;&gt; We don't act like the world. &gt;&gt; We are from another kingdom. &gt;&gt; We are citizens of another kingdom. And we ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF THAT KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; AND IN OUR KINGDOM, THERE IS THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY. IN OUR KINGDOM IS THE HIGHEST POWER. IN OUR KINGDOM, THERE'S THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY THAT REST IN YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see what's happening in the global world right now. The USA has gone after the oil. &gt;&gt; They are positioning themselves for war. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They will NOT STOP WITH VENEZUELA. NOW THEY WANT GREENLAND. THEY WANT STRATEGIC POINTS BECAUSE WHEN THE WORLD WAR BREAKS OUT, &gt;&gt; they need TO HAVE STRATEGIC POINTS. All right. &gt;&gt; And the reason why the natural USA the peace SYSTEM HAS GONE AFTER THE OIL IS TYPING THE FOOLISH VIRGINS HAVE GONE AFTER THE OIL WHILE WE ARE SHUTTING WITH CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; Is that not Matthew 25? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That while they went IN AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT, THE W THE FOOLISH WENT TO LOOK FOR OIL. &gt;&gt; But there's that in the natural now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; you've never seen SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WHEN RUSSIA GOES AND TAKES OVER UH TRIES TO TAKE OVER UKRAINE, there's a uproar. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; they use UKRAINE AS A PROXY LAND TO FIGHT THE BATTLES TO TEST THE MILITARY EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO HOT WAR ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING ALL OF THESE OH LORD, speak this morning. They have BEEN DEVELOPING ALL OF THESE UH uh warfare and and machinery. &gt;&gt; Yes. But they DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TEST IT. BUT THE WAR IN UKRAINE GAVE THEM A CHANCE. NOW THEY STARTED TO PUMP ALL OF THEIR WEAPONS THERE in Ukraine. &gt;&gt; ISRAEL, I MEAN, US HAS BEEN PUMPING THEM WITH AMMUNITION and armor and and weapons of war and they've been testing it for them. &gt;&gt; Testing it for them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in that now, God also used to use the war in Ukraine because the largest population of Jews &gt;&gt; was in Eastern Europe. Yes. &gt;&gt; But this war displaced those Jews &gt;&gt; and they had to go back to the homeland. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thousands and thousands and thousands of Jews have returned back to the homeland because of the war in Russia and Ukraine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, they there couldn't be much more left. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if God has also been positioning and removing them back to their land, &gt;&gt; how close are we? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the close of the gentile dispensation. &gt;&gt; Let us be alert. Let us be awake. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD IS MOVING HIS GOALS AND HIS PLANS. AMEN. THIS YEAR, &gt;&gt; at the start of the year, look at what happened. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You also saw the video. Amen. Prophecy coming to pass. Last year, YOU SAW GREAT PROPHECY come to pass. But the prophet JUST SAYS, "AMEN." WATCH when you see that pope come out of THE USA. PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; People never felt that there WOULD BE A POPE COME OUT OF THE USA. &gt;&gt; BUT A PROPHET HAD SPOKEN it in 1954. &gt;&gt; AND HERE IN 2025, THE PROPHECY COMES TO PASS. A POPE OUT OF THE USA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; The wheels OF PROPHECY ARE MOVING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And we must move with the wheels of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now you look, they're positioning themselves for the oil. &gt;&gt; The foolish virgins are positioning themselves for the oil, &gt;&gt; trying to find it. What is the oil? The revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. He says here in this message that one of the greatest presidents that ever lived was Lincoln. You know, everyone know Abraham Lincoln. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he was a great man and though he was deprived of an education, brother Brandham is saying he never let his education get in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we shouldn't let our circumstances and our past get in the way of what God has called us for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet is trying to say in this message. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't allow Amen. our past experiences shape our destiny and our future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We should be able to use the word of God to overcome every situation and every circumstance that we have. Amen. Praise the Lord. So he says, "I like a man of vision." Now if you like a man of vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we people of vision? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to be people of vision. &gt;&gt; Yes. We've got to be people of purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has designed it now that we must be people of vision and people of purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God said write the vision, do you know he God's vision is you. God wrote you. &gt;&gt; God wrote your life story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the vision of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And though it God says, "Wait for it." &gt;&gt; You are going to see me do exceedingly abundantly in your life. &gt;&gt; Wait for it. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just want to see if I put this up. Maybe this will work. &gt;&gt; He says, "I like a man of vision. I like people that got something they are fighting for." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you fighting for? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I also want you not to be distracted because watch the pattern in your life. &gt;&gt; If you are fighting for something for 10 years, stop fighting for it. &gt;&gt; 20 years, stop fighting for it. &gt;&gt; You could be focusing all your time and your energy for something God does not want you to have. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Because God is raising up men and women in the kingdom of God that are meant and destined to take the kingdom of God further, to establish the kingdom of God. But if we're finding after 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, you are still fighting for things, something, amen, that God doesn't want you to have, then let it go. &gt;&gt; Cut ties with it. &gt;&gt; And say, Lord, I'm releasing this thing right now, and you are going to lead me and guide me. &gt;&gt; Because we could be focusing all our attention on the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, I like people that got something they're fighting for, not just lay around. So, we got to be on the move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have got to be on the move. Amen. He says, "Oh, some people just sit back and say, oh, whatever comes along will be all right." HE SAYS, "OH, BE UP AND AT IT." &gt;&gt; And Lincoln never let his education stand in the way. He had something to do. I think every Christian ought to be that way. Find your purpose and go do it. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, "Find your purpose." and go do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Have a purpose in life. Something you're going to do, God placed you here. Do something about it. Every member of every church, there's a revival in town. There's a revival for a purpose. Let's get something out of it. Let's do something about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "I like a man of vision." Here's the meaning of vision. The ability to think or plan the future with imagination &gt;&gt; or wisdom. &gt;&gt; The ability to think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have a concern for our lives. Don't let just things we'll see how it unfolds. No. Take charge of your life. &gt;&gt; Demon powers are not casual about your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Demon powers want to come to kill, to steal, and destroy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They are very strategic about their plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can't The Bible also says that THE KINGDOM OF GOD SUFFERTH VIOLENCE &gt;&gt; AND THE VIOLENT TAKEN BY FORCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO TAKE BACK OUR FAMILY BY FORCE. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE BACK OUR HEALTH BY FORCE. WE GOT TO TAKE BACK OUR BLESSINGS BY FORCE. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T BE CASUAL IN THIS TIME OF WARFARE. &gt;&gt; I LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE STANDING AND FIGHTING FOR WHAT THEY GOT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, LET'S MARCH NOW FORWARD. THERE'S AN AUTHORITY GIVEN TO THE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; LET'S START TO USE THAT AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; LET'S START TO WALK IN THAT AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T JUST BE DUMB AND STANDING THERE LOOKING AT SATAN COMING OVER YOUR FAMILY, SATAN OVERTAKING YOUR HOME, SATAN OVERTAKING THINGS. STAND YOUR GROUND. AMEN. Be like, AMEN. HALLELUJAH. SHANGA WHO SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE PHILISTINES WERE COMING YEAR AFTER YEAR TO TAKE HIS CROP. &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TIME AND SEASON DURING LUTHER AND Wley and the early Pentecostals, THEY STOOD AND WATCHED PEOPLE COME TO TAKE THEIR CROP. BUT NOT IN THE TIME OF ANOTHER DAVID. AMEN. IN THE TIME OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM, IN THE TIME, AMEN, OF THE PROPHECY OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, STAND YOUR GROUND. TAKE AN OX CODE AND DRIVE OUT EVERY DEMON FROM YOUR LIFE. DRIVE OUT EVERY DEMON from your family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; THERE'S TWO GOALS AND THERE'S TWO PLANS THERE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; In Luke 10:10. &gt;&gt; One come TO KILL, TO STEAL, AND DESTROY. &gt;&gt; BUT THE OTHER GOAL OF CHRIST IS I HAVE COME TO GIVE YOU LIFE AND LIFE MORE ABUNDANTLY. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; In whose goal and whose pattern will we fit? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when we starting to think about our lives and say I want to surrender my life to God. &gt;&gt; You know when when Solomon was going to he was placed as king over the greatest nation. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God had chosen this nation. &gt;&gt; Do you know he came to God and he says Lord I am young. You you made me lead over this people. He says, "Lord, why don't you give me wisdom to serve your people?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what are we learning from there? GOD HAS RAISED YOU UP in your position, whatever caliber you have to offer the kingdom to serve the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He never asked for riches. He asked God for wisdom to be able TO HANDLE WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN him &gt;&gt; and to serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What has God placed in our hands? YES. &gt;&gt; CAN WE ASK HIM for wisdom &gt;&gt; to say, Lord, whatever you've placed in my hand, give me wisdom so that I can serve your people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the Lord now comes back to and you know where all of this happened? I love it. I love it. &gt;&gt; It happened in a dream. &gt;&gt; Read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God still speaks in dreams. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God still speaks through his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you thought maybe God came down to Solomon and spoke to him, no. Go read there. &gt;&gt; Whatever God establishes in the dream becomes reality. &gt;&gt; Look at how God spoke. God never spoke to Joseph face to face. &gt;&gt; God spoke to Joseph in a dream. &gt;&gt; He kept coming to him in dreams. &gt;&gt; Don't fear to take Mary thy wife. &gt;&gt; Dream. Yes. &gt;&gt; He comes back to him in a dream. Flee to Egypt. Dream. &gt;&gt; Comes back to him in a dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Herod is dead. Go back now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Constantly revealing himself through dreams. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we falling asleep watching Netflix. What you think you're going to dream about? &gt;&gt; You dreaming. You're shooting people and you're running and you're fighting and you're action movie. Even we're not giving our channel to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why the Lord don't speak to us in dreams and in visions anymore. &gt;&gt; Our subconscious mind is given to the world. &gt;&gt; But God uses the subconscious mind for dreams and visions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're dreaming of this beautiful girl. &gt;&gt; You're dreaming of a long hair. You're dreaming. Set your the Bible says set your mind on things above. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible also says that Jo Joseph started to think on these things &gt;&gt; and then the Lord appeared to him in a dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Solomon asked the Lord for wisdom. Say Lord in 2026 give me wisdom to manage whatever you have given me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that I can now watch. Don't you say manage. I'm giving you the key now. So that I can serve your people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Serving the people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The secret of Solomon's success. He wanted the wisdom not to boast but to serve God's people. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Motives are very important. &gt;&gt; Objectives are very important when we are asking God things. When we are believing God for things. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to teach you the POSITIVE APPROACH. DON'T JUST BE somebody who ask God for things and don't know how to manage things and we mismanage resources that God has placed for the body. WE START TO ACCUMULATE IT AS PERSONAL WEALTH. WHEN GOD HAS STARTED TO RELEASE THINGS TO US for the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God has started to release WISDOM FOR THE BODY, WE START TO TAKE IT and apply it selfishly. &gt;&gt; Everything that God will release to us in this time and season is for the benefit of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was sharing at the Christmas message a few weeks ago and I was telling you that when GOD CALLED JOSEPH, HE HAD THE CAPACITY TO handle whatever God had called him for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD CALLED you for something, he will equip you. &gt;&gt; Some people like to give me spiritual answers, but I like practicality of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was asking somebody when God told Joseph to flee to Egypt, he needed finances. He needed resources. But if you read just before that three not three sorry wise men from the east come to to Joseph and what does he give him? Frankincense. Somebody tell me what else he gave him. What do you think he did with that gold? Joseph was saying MY GOD SHALL PROVIDE all my needs. &gt;&gt; You see you already thought spiritual answers. &gt;&gt; You thought they kept the frankincense one side, the myrr and they kept the gold one side. No. Joseph said what a thing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Lord has provided gold. &gt;&gt; What do you think he did with it? Come on. Don't give me a spiritual answer now, brother Sunny. What do you think Joseph did with the gold? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was for the provision for Jesus. &gt;&gt; You see, your religious mind won't make you accept that right now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you want to go to Israel because you're thinking Joseph got the gold hidden there. No, Joseph used the gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Joseph, use the frankincense. &gt;&gt; Joseph, use the &gt;&gt; turn to your neighbor and SAY, "WHATEVER GOD HAS GIVEN YOU, USE IT." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's break that religious spirit right here, right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; When God wants to take CARE OF THE BODY, THEY NEEDED PROVISION to take care of Jesus. God provided the gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the the frankincense and the myrr the my what the prophet says it was for his &gt;&gt; burial. So you say the gold was for his uh birth the gold was for his wellbeing. &gt;&gt; Hey come on the religious people. Come on. I'm fighting the spirit right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Luke. &gt;&gt; If you were Joseph watch you have done for the gold. Now you need transport to go to Egypt. You see, some of us are looking for provision to come elsewhere when it's in our account. &gt;&gt; The Lord placed the goal there before Joseph. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Demon of unbelief, I come against you in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Brandham says the in the in the uh game of life, there are rules to the game. &gt;&gt; You have to play the game according to the rules. &gt;&gt; If you play it outside of the rules, you'll be disqualified. &gt;&gt; He says that's the way it is with human life. &gt;&gt; You see, even this morning, some are so uninterested in the service when I'm talking to you about your goals and ambitions for life. You're in a service for you to set your mind straight. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you don't want to hear spiritual guidance and wisdom about it. You'll go outside and you'll tell your unbelieving friends about your goals and your visions for this life &gt;&gt; because you don't want to align your goal and your vision with God's word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll hear you talking TO YOUR FRIENDS YAPPING. CAN'T STOP YOUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; If I come and ask you, are you okay? You give me one word answers. &gt;&gt; Someone will think you need therapy, speech therapy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said we'll be so FULL OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I'M REJOICING NIGHT AND DAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AS I WALK the narrow way, FOR THE COMFORTER ABIDES WITH ME. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; IF WE CAN'T REJOICE AROUND THE WORD OF GOD WITH ONE ANOTHER, WHO are we going to rejoice with the word? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The world don't want to hear it. &gt;&gt; LET US HERE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. DENOMINATIONS DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is with human life. You can't play the rules of the game of life wrong and expect to win. &gt;&gt; You've got to play it according to God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the purpose that you WERE BROUGHT HERE FOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, there are so many people that don't seem to have any kind of purpose in life. I pray that's not anyone here this morning. Especially in this day we live, people seem to think that all they have to do is keep up with somebody. fashions of the world, animal enticements that the world give to them. Just like if you go to school and some little girls wear certain frock or a dress, everybody wants now to wear that. The ambition of the school is to be like this girl. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of the women on television, everyone wants to be like some famous person. &gt;&gt; Don't pattern yourself after worldly people. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Don't pattern yourself after a man, the fashions of this world. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God tells us that Jezebel became the queen of Israel &gt;&gt; because of Ahab married her and she brought her fashions in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She brought her pants into the Israel. She brought her makeup into Israel. &gt;&gt; And the rest of the woman looked at the queen in admiration. He said that did the same thing with Jackie Kennedy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Only thing nobody wants to be like Mr. Naposa. &gt;&gt; That seems to be just about the limit of the American ambition. Listen, I am I'm teaching. Some of you may have thought I'm preaching for you to set your worldly goals and your worldly ambitions. No, I'm bringing you back to the word. &gt;&gt; Hear what the property is saying. Some people think the ambition is to get a new job or to get a raise in your salary 2026. will get a raise. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why do you want the raise? &gt;&gt; Why do you want a new job? That's the question we must ask. &gt;&gt; Why do you want to get an increase in salary? Why do you want to get a television and a new car? &gt;&gt; Let me say this. These things may be all right. Tell your neighbor that's all right. &gt;&gt; It's all right. Don't be a hardliner. The prophet saying it might be all right. Tell him it's all right. Calm down. But there's higher ambitions in human life. Get your car, but serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Plant your potatoes, but serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Put God first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come to church. &gt;&gt; On a Sunday and a Wednesday, &gt;&gt; come to church EVERY TIME THE CHURCH DOORS OPEN. MAKE IT YOUR PRIORITY. &gt;&gt; TO PUT GOD FIRST MEANS YOU MAKE IT YOUR PRIORITY. &gt;&gt; You leave every other thing. SOME PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY made their job their God. You don't find them in church because their job is their God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if we refocus OUR AMBITION AND SAY, "LORD, I LEAVING THIS JOB BECAUSE I WANT TO BE IN THE HOUSE SERVING YOU." AMEN. &gt;&gt; And watch how God supplies because he says, "Seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things I'll add to you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We say, "Huh, &gt;&gt; I don't want you and your kingdom. I'll go and pursue my own way. I'll seek my own job. I'll seek my own happiness. I'll seek my own life. I won't seek the kingdom." &gt;&gt; You're not playing the rules of the game, right? &gt;&gt; You're going to lose. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY LOOK LIKE YOU ARE SUCCEEDING HERE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. ON THE OUTSIDE, you're living in A FANCY HOUSE. YOU GOT A NICE CAR, &gt;&gt; but in the kingdom of God, you are bankrupt. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PHYSICALLY RICH, BUT SPIRITUALLY POOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; There's higher ambitions in the human life than those things. And Christians, who Christians should set their affections on higher ambitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Christians should set their affections on &gt;&gt; higher ambitions. &gt;&gt; I think it will pay us all to sit down and wonder why we are here in the first place. &gt;&gt; Why are we here? &gt;&gt; Lord, why did you bring me here? &gt;&gt; Why am I here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whoever was kind enough to bring us here, we ought to consider and ask him what he would have us do, the purpose of us coming to fulfill what he has purposed for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't live meaningless lives. There's a purpose for each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; And we want to be in God's purpose. We want to be in God's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the proverb talks about choice as well. &gt;&gt; We are given choices in life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are given choices. &gt;&gt; We can choose now to even shut the voice that I'm speaking with now. Yes. &gt;&gt; I'd say I'll hear you another time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You are given a choice. &gt;&gt; THE WAY OF LIFE is a choice. &gt;&gt; We have a right to make our own way. Choose our own way that we want to live. Education is a choice. Don't let education take you away from the things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can choose whether we're going to be educated whether we're not going to be educated. So, I want to kill that teaching that don't get educated because the Lord is coming. Because there are many poor people here today because of that teaching 40 years ago. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are many people that didn't pursue the education to get a better job to take care of their families. &gt;&gt; Because the Lord was coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; They never brought a balance to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want scripture? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I pick up religious demons. &gt;&gt; In Genesis, when the Lord told Abraham that I'm going to make you a mighty nation. &gt;&gt; The only promise we think about is him having a son. &gt;&gt; But in the 25 years that he waited, that was only one promise to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Him having a son &gt;&gt; called Isaac. What about all the other promises? For 25 years, Abraham was not stagnant. &gt;&gt; He was moving. He was getting blessed. &gt;&gt; He was attaining things in his life. &gt;&gt; He was getting cattle. &gt;&gt; He was getting servants. The Lord was blessing him abundantly. He didn't remain stagnant for the 25 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't hear a lot of amens for that, but that's the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He didn't just sit around waiting for one promise. I will not be moved. I will just sit here under this tree, &gt;&gt; under this memory tree, and just wait for Isaac alone to come. Until I see Isaac, I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; Go read the book of Genesis there and see Abraham was on the move. &gt;&gt; Abraham was doing things. &gt;&gt; Abraham was not sitting idle waiting for Isaac. So, while we are waiting for the promised Messiah &gt;&gt; to come and CHANGE OUR BODIES, LET'S BE ON THE MOVE. &gt;&gt; LET'S BE UP AND AT IT. LET'S BE A PEOPLE OF VISION. &gt;&gt; LET'S BE A PEOPLE OF PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; I know people don't like to read posts like this. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You have a choice whether you want to be educated or not. &gt;&gt; That's a choice that we can make. We can make that choice. No problem. But keep your heart serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't let that take you away from the things of God. &gt;&gt; Right and wrong is a choice. Every man, woman, boy, and girl has a choice as to choose whether they're going to try and live right or not live right. It's a choice. Choice is a great thing. You know, some of you have made choices. &gt;&gt; You went into the world. &gt;&gt; You started to enjoy the things of the world. It was a choice you made. But there's a price to be paid. &gt;&gt; There's a price to be paid. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Your testimony is gone. People know about your past. &gt;&gt; Your reputation is gone. &gt;&gt; Your life is now messed up. You can't serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Officers you could have held, you can't hold anymore. It's a choice we made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your eternal destination is a choice. And maybe tonight some of you will make that choice where you'll spend eternity before the service ends. If you've turned God many times, there'll be one time you'll turn him down the last time. It's a dangerous thing for a man and woman, boy, girl to step across the line for there's no return when you step across the deadline. So, make your decision. Amen. There's another choice in life, a life's companion. A young man or young woman stepping out in life has a given a right to make a choice. The young man chooses. The young woman has a right to accept or reject it. But it's still a choice on both sides. Both men and women, they have a right to choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a choice as a Christian. You have a choice of the church in America so far that you can go to. That's your American privilege &gt;&gt; to choose any church that you want to belong to. That's a choice. You don't have to go to any of them if you don't want to. But if you want to change from Methodist to Baptist to Catholic to Protestant, there's nobody can tell you or make you come to any certain church. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our freedom. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you have a choice in the church that will guide you to your eternal destination. Praise the Lord. I'm just trying to show you that God has given us a choice when we are setting up goals and ambitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's up to us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We can choose to serve the Lord in 2026. We can choose to walk away from him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's a choice. Yeah, we find out now this is in line with prophecy. We find out the fire is ready. The nations are ready. Evangelists have gone to their places and every gift he set in order. No wonder we should be persistent. No wonder we should be perseverant. We've got a goal to achieve for God. Let's call out the bride of Jesus Christ from all denominations. Oh, is somebody hearing what the goal of the prophet was? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The prophet wasn't somebody without a goal. &gt;&gt; He was here to call out the bright from every denomination. &gt;&gt; From all people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In making the prophet goes on to say in making a goal or something, you have to be persistent. &gt;&gt; So even in our natural life, be persistent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you are trusting the Lord for something, be persistent. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you are trusting the Lord FOR A NEW JOB, WHATEVER YOU trusting the Lord for, be persistent. &gt;&gt; Amen. have a goal. He says to be persistent. Amen. Men through the ages. Now listen to this. You have to have faith in what you're trying to achieve. If you're starting a new business, have faith in what you're trying to achieve. &gt;&gt; A farmer don't plant potatoes today and look for others tomorrow. &gt;&gt; He lets the seed lay in the ground. &gt;&gt; He lets it go through the process. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when God starts to bless your business, don't turn turn away from him and start to go after your own ways. &gt;&gt; He says here, be persistent. Have faith in what you're trying to achieve. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Especially if you're trying to do something right. Now, when you're starting a business, whether you're starting a new venture, whether you're starting a new Amen, whatever goal you're pursuing, be persistent and don't be swayed by opposition. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The first month sales may be low. Second month, third month, be persistent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have faith in what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Apply spiritual laws naturally. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you understand spiritual laws, apply it naturally. &gt;&gt; It must work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to meet great opposition, but have faith, Lord. So, I'm coming to motive. Why do you want it to succeed? Why do you want your business to succeed? Why do you want to get a better job? Why do you want to get a better car? Motive. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; IF I CAN ESTABLISH THIS WITH YOU, AMEN. And and you get YOUR HEART RIGHT WITH GOD, GOD WILL WITHHOLD NOTHING FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to teach you motive. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll get to motive now. You've got to set a goal and say this I believe and tie yourself to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whatever you're planning to do in 2026, set a goal. &gt;&gt; Say this. I believe &gt;&gt; and tie yourself to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Become one with the goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BECOME ONE WITH THE PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T SAY, "I'M going to send a redeemer to the earth." and didn't tie himself to that redeemer. &gt;&gt; THE WORD BECAME FLESH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE TIED HIMSELF TO REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; SEE, keep drawing. Keep moving up closer. It's there knowing that something is there that you're coming to. That's the way faith is. He quotes there Hebrews 11. Faith is the substance of things. As long as you set your faith on it, then anchor it. You've got it coming. No matter if you can't see it, you know it's there anyhow. You're tugging at it. It's pulling. And any man that's ever done anything worthwhile has set a goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any man that has ever done anything worthwhile and set a goal. &gt;&gt; Be persistent to make that great men. Now, let's see. We're talking about men. I I'll show you God's goal. God is a God of a goal. &gt;&gt; I'll show you. The prophet says it. So, we can't be people without a goal. &gt;&gt; Ask your neighbor, "Do you have a goal?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have a goal? &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about your neighbor when you go home. I'm talking about who you see now. &gt;&gt; Because some of you never move. Some of you think I'm call and uh at home. No. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Luke. &gt;&gt; Brother Tyson. You to ask brother Luke. Why? Ask your neighbor if he's got a goal. &gt;&gt; You know why I'm ask you to do that? If they don't have a goal, you know, think now I'll answer quickly to tell you. Yes. &gt;&gt; We're trying to activate it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because nobody likes to be left out and say, "No, I don't have a goal." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's see God's goal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we are created like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God is a God who has goals, we have to be people who have goals. &gt;&gt; The entire Bible is an expression of one goal. That who had &gt;&gt; who had this goal? &gt;&gt; Somebody say God. &gt;&gt; God had this goal. &gt;&gt; God had a goal. One purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. And all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been the type and expression what God's great goal is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you're reading the Bible now, all of them are typing what God's great goal is. &gt;&gt; God has a goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now in the last days, he has revealed it and shows it. He's revealed his goal. You got to read the rest of the message. Now, I gave you an appetizer there. &gt;&gt; If you read the rest of the message, you'll understand what God great goal is. God's great goal, I'll give it to you in a very simple answer. He wants to live in people. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God's great goal is to live in people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Again, you have to have faith in what you're doing and don't be uphazard about it. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, don't be uphazard &gt;&gt; about your goals. &gt;&gt; Don't be uphazard. Amen. If you don't, you're going to be uphazard. I hope so. It'll never happen. It You see, &gt;&gt; hey, things are slow. Things are not working out. You know, I tried this thing. Let me try something else. No. Be persistent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who gave you that vision in the first place? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who gave you that motive in the first place? Who gave you that goal in the first place? &gt;&gt; Amen. He says you can't have faith if you're going to be like that. Hopping from this to that, hopping from this to that. He says tie yourself to it. Don't be afraid about it. Don't say it can't happen. &gt;&gt; You must thoroughly know what you're going what you're going and know it's going to happen. Then you're positive it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; You're positive it's going to happen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So be specific. Don't say Lord, oh I need a car. What car? How many seater? How many seater car you need? What is the purpose for the car? I'm coming to the purpose. I'll give it to you at the end. I'll close with that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want oil. What oil you want? Olive oil. You want cooking oil? What oil? Be specific. &gt;&gt; Don't go there and pray for oil. The Lord is a thing. Now what you want? He wants crude oil. He wants olive oil. &gt;&gt; Cooking oil is saying castor oil. &gt;&gt; The Lord don't know what oil to give you. Be specific. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want a house. Well, what house &gt;&gt; you want? A one-bedroom house. &gt;&gt; You want a two-bedroom house? &gt;&gt; You want a three-bedroom house? How many bathrooms you want? &gt;&gt; You see, when you start to there, then you're already starting to envision it. You see it in the mind's eye first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you're starting to operate like God. God had thoughts in the back part of his mind. He started to think about everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you start to do that, he says you're positive it's going to happen. All Christians must be persistent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we all Christians here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now all Christians must be persistent." &gt;&gt; You see Jesus, I just put this in here to show you. Jesus had opposition, but he went on preaching the same, healing the same, never bothered him. There were many critics. The man was criticized from the time he was a baby until he died on the cross. &gt;&gt; And even when he rose again, they said he didn't rise. &gt;&gt; But that didn't stop his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That didn't stop his goal. &gt;&gt; Maybe your father don't believe in you. &gt;&gt; Maybe your mother don't believe in you. Your family don't believe in you and tell you whatever you're doing, you're going to fail. You'll never amount to nothing. No. &gt;&gt; Close your ears to those words. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Every word spoken against you shall be condemned." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against you shall prosper. God gave you the goal. God gave you the vision. &gt;&gt; When David came there to fight Goliath, HIS FAMILY WAS AGAINST IT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God had revealed it to him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to kill this Goliath. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the voice of opposition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did it stop him? No, sir. What was his goal? What was his goal? Always do that what the father has written. Always do what pleased him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the prophet's goal. How many of you want to know what the prophet's goal was? &gt;&gt; People say he's a false prophet. &gt;&gt; People say it's a cult. &gt;&gt; Let me show you what the prophet's goal is, and you make your decision right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to see what William Brandham came for &gt;&gt; and you make a decision what his goal in life was? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Come on. Can I get more people to agree with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's put it to a test. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Not for one MOMENT DO I BRING A MESSAGE to the people that they may follow me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or join my CHURCH &gt;&gt; OR START SOME fellowship and organization. &gt;&gt; I have never done that and will not do that now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have no interest in those things. Those are not my goals. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I do have an interest in the things of God &gt;&gt; and people. And if I can accomplish just one thing, I will be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The that one thing is to see established a true relationship between God and men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet came to establish A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND MEN. &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't want that? &gt;&gt; How is this a cult? &gt;&gt; How is this a false prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm showing you the prophet's goal. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He came to establish A TRUE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD and man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The goal of the prophet wherein men become new creations in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Filled with his spirit. Live according to his word. I would invite all plead warn to hear his voice at this time and heal yourselves completely to him. Even as I trust in my heart that you have given my that I have given my all to him. God blessing and God bless you and may his coming rejoice your heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So that was the prophet's goal. &gt;&gt; That was the prophet's goal. Now let's close. How many of you want to close? Praise the Lord. Everyone say no. If you don't say yes and it means no. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone feeling good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Tell your neighbor I feel good. Oh, I feel good. Praise the Lord. Praise Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I told you that Joshua was I I open by showing you Joshua marching into a new land. &gt;&gt; Now, our strength is going to come from being in the land. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't think the seals are open for no reason. &gt;&gt; Our strength is being in the land. You hear what the prophet is saying here now, right? The pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their new found way. Being separated from their old denomination and creed, they could marry a new anointed word for their age. The new anointed word for their age for their day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now hear what he says. So we can be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world. all of our associates. Abraham was a pilgrim. God has separated us from dead religions. I'm speaking across the nation now dead creeds and to do what? Separated us and opened a new land. A new message for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a new land just LIKE HOW WE TOLD JOSHUA, YOU NEED TO INHERIT YOUR LAND. A new land was open to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? He says Pentecost dried up. You know, all of these things. What did he do? He opened up the seven seals of the last message. That's our new land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We live in the land of the open book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We live in the land of our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You notice that the seven seals which are all the mysteries of the seven church ages were sealed with seven seals. The reformers didn't have time to do it. They didn't live long enough. about this blessed revelation OF THE SEVEN SEALS. &gt;&gt; MORE PEOPLE OUGHT TO GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS BLESSED REVELATION OF THE SEVEN SEALS. THIS IS OUR NEW LAND. JOSHUA, YOU'VE GOT TO STEP INTO THE NEW LAND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's open to us in this last day from a prophecy that went forth to Arizona. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OUR STRENGTH. PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHERE THE BRIDE IS GETTING HER STRENGTH. SHE IS WALKING IN HER LAND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE'S MARCHING AND RULING FROM THIS LAND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; We don't have the same anointing as denominations. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE FALSE ANOINTED. &gt;&gt; WE ARE ANOINTED BECAUSE WE ARE IN OUR LAND. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TAKEN A POSITION FROM 63 RIGHT NOW TO 2026. THIS BRIDE HAS BEEN MARCHING onward Christian soldiers MARCHING TO THE BEAT OF ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS. We need more soldiers to arise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; BELIEVERS, THE SEVENTH YEARS IS OUR REVELATION. A BLESSED REVELATION. And we live in this land of abundance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Motive. Coming to motive. Now you say, "Show me the motive." HOW DO I ASK GOD FOR A CAR AND show him THE RIGHT MOTIVE? HOW DO I ASK GOD? AMEN. FOR BLESSINGS AND ASKING FOR THE RIGHT MOTIVE. WHY DO I WANT TO BE HEALED? WHAT IS THE RIGHT MOTIVE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Motive is very important. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Somebody say motive is very important. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this. Now I told you I'll give you the motive and then we can all ask God right and act right, live right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to see the motive? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's see now. Let's get our motive right. Whatever our goals we are facing, let's get the motive right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get the objective right. So he says here, a group of men came to him a long ago. I kept telling them there's oil in Kentucky. M &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; He kept telling them not Kentucky oil. Now I know it's very oily that chicken. Now he's not talking about &gt;&gt; that chicken. &gt;&gt; Some of you you you don't know what Kentucky is. You're thinking about KFC and you think how oily that chicken is. He's not talking about that oil. &gt;&gt; Right. Go to Kentucky. Oil down there. I knew it. I seen it in a vision. So now God can open up things to you &gt;&gt; if you ask him, &gt;&gt; but you must have the right motive. &gt;&gt; We are closing. Just tell your neighbor we are closing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You told your neighbor we're closing. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you because some of them are sleeping. I want you to wake them up and say come. We're closing now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet now, imagine the Lord would reveal to his prophet there's oil. &gt;&gt; There's great wealth in oil. He told his men to go down there to Kentucky. There's oil there. &gt;&gt; They didn't go. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Deus and them didn't go for a long time. After a while, finally they said Texas came in now. The oil merchants from Texas now. Now they said now we are going down. I said you auto went a long time ago but they didn't do it. M &gt;&gt; we have ought to be in places a long time ago, but we didn't go. &gt;&gt; God wants to move us farther ahead and we didn't go because we're stuck in cycles. &gt;&gt; We're closing. Tell somebody we're closing. Dema said, "I made a great mistake by not doing that." Brother Brandon, I said, "If you did, if you went down there, you were mad at all. Amen. &gt;&gt; You would have added all. &gt;&gt; How many of you know he's the same yesterday, today, and forever? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you seek God's wisdom, God can bless you exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ask for things. &gt;&gt; Let me be honest with you. People are still buying things. &gt;&gt; People are still buying products. People are still doing business. &gt;&gt; So ask the Lord for wisdom. Lord, bring that business to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember the motive. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're coming to the motive. &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't listen. &gt;&gt; We were having lunch. The Holy Spirit showed me a great crack in the earth. Yeah, we're talking about that crack in the earth now. Yeah. In Los Angeles. The Holy Spirit now showed the prophet a crack in the earth where the oil is. &gt;&gt; How many of you know where the Holy Spirit is right now? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know you can still show your cracks in the earth? &gt;&gt; Do you know some of us don't know how to harness the power of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is sent to lead us. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is sent to guide us. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is sent to teach us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But how many of us are ever conscious of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; How many of us ask the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; The power is in us. &gt;&gt; How many of us talk to the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, "Holy Ghost, give me wisdom. &gt;&gt; I'm doing this. I got this goal. God, this year, &gt;&gt; show me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Show me. &gt;&gt; How many of us have the capacity to hear the voice of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach the next service &gt;&gt; on that. Amen. The Holy Spirit showed me a crack in the air that was full of oil and those overflow in Kentucky was just a little bit of oil that was pumping, but this one was the main stream. And I said, "But the deus, it's there." &gt;&gt; So they went searching for it said, "Go down and tell us where the oil well is." I said, "Oh, no, sir." See, we don't use the gift of God for commercial. &gt;&gt; He could tell me where it was, but I don't have any need of it. &gt;&gt; So, let's learn from this. If we have a need for it, we can ask God for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in the prophet's ministry, he didn't have need for it. But if you have need for something, you can and you have faith for it, you can ask God. &gt;&gt; I don't have need. I wouldn't have enough faith to enough to ask him. If I had a need of it, I believe if I'd ask him, he'd tell me. &gt;&gt; But first, your motives and objective has to be right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to have reasons for this. God didn't give me those things just because you asked. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're trying to learn now how to ask God for things. &gt;&gt; You must have a need for it. &gt;&gt; And your motive and objective must be right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to it to be in the will of God. If you want to be well, what do you want to be well for? &gt;&gt; If you want to be healed, what's the reason you want to be healed? What are you telling God? What do you want to do with your life when you get healed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. There's got to be you've got to have a motive and objective and there have to be a right according to the will of God. Then then faith is revealed to you. God by sovereign grace places that faith in there then it's over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now to make that word true when the brethren got down there one fellow went over and brought a bunch of stuff. So leases cheated the other one. You see it wouldn't work. Now just to make the prophecy sure within a 100 yards where these men were digging their well some men struck the big gusher and there 1100 barrels of oil in half a day something or the other like that still putting it out right in that mainstream but just to make the prophecy of the word that had been said it was there it was there the rest of them nearly all dried up everywhere through Kentucky little ponds they pump them a little while it's only overflow from this but because of their selfish got among them. Its objectives was wrong. Signing up a bunch of stuff. It would be this way. And they promised they would do it for the kingdom of God, but look like it was for themselves. Here's the key. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want IT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Nobody likes that answer. &gt;&gt; THE OBJECTIVE MUST BE FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I WANT IT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The objective must be the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because in a kingdom, nothing belongs to the citizens. &gt;&gt; It all belongs to the king. AND WE ARE STEWARDS OF WHATEVER HE ADMINISTERS TO US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How many of you learning how to ask God for things? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many of you know why you want to be healed? You want to be healed for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, that's a good objective. I want to be healed for the glory of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to serve you in your kingdom. &gt;&gt; Why do you want a job? I want a I want a a job for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So that I can serve you in your kingdom. &gt;&gt; Why do you want the oil well? Lord, the kingdom needs funding. The kingdom needs finances. &gt;&gt; I want to finance the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So you have free to start to ask for it. Is somebody reading the quote and agreeing with me? The prophet is saying the objective must be the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. but look like it's all for themselves. It won't work. No selfish thing will work. Your motives and objective has to be exactly perfectly right. Then you are free to ask. If your art condemn us not, then we are confident. See, I want this to the honor and glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So write that next to your goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody hearing me? I'm closing. &gt;&gt; Write this next to your goal. &gt;&gt; Whatever you put your goal in, I want this for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if whatever you're asking, you know, now it can't be used for the glory of God, strike that from your goal list. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're hearing what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; If if your goal now can't bring glory to God, then you got to strike that goal off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So 2026, VISION BOARD MUST BE UP. &gt;&gt; 2026, your goals must be clear. AND IT'S ALL FOR THE GLORY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL FOR HIS KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I want this for the honor and glory of God. Then faith has a channel to move into it. If it doesn't, then you got mental, intellectual faith, not genuine faith. &gt;&gt; Might get you emotional, but it won't get you the healing you're looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I think we're done there. How many if you got the point? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How many of you got the point? Amen. &gt;&gt; God will withhold no good thing from his body right now &gt;&gt; from the bride of Jesus Christ. God will withhold no good thing. &gt;&gt; It's his goal and his objective to make this bride prosperous to make her abundantly blessed. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn to 1 Corinthians 15. I'll give you a scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People think there are no promises in the word of God. There are promises in the word of God that we can't even contain. &gt;&gt; Hey. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many of you are writing the scripture down? I don't know how to enlarge this here, but I've got 1 Corinthians 1:4. I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given to you by Jesus Christ. That in some things anyone can see that word. &gt;&gt; Somebody say it loud. &gt;&gt; One Corinthians 15. &gt;&gt; Somebody say it loud. &gt;&gt; That in everything &gt;&gt; you are &gt;&gt; in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; In all utterance and in all knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In everything I'm enriched in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm enriched in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get the musicians. Give the Lord a good hand clap of praise. &gt;&gt; Now, if God could show the prophet an oil well, God can show you for your life. &gt;&gt; God can show you the plan and purpose for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah.
