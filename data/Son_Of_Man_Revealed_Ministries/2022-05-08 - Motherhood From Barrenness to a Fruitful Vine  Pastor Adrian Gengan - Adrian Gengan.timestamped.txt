[9:17] not forgetting all the moms that have
[9:19] gone on before
[9:21] amen we always remember them amen
[9:24] so this morning we'll speak a little
[9:25] thoughts motherhood
[9:27] from barrenness to a fruitful vine
[9:31] amen
[9:32] from barrenness to a fruitful vine we'll
[9:35] turn to john chapter 16 and verse 21
[9:39] and our lord jesus is talking and he's
[9:41] talking about a woman in travail
[9:45] and it's in john 16 and 21 it says
[9:48] a woman when she is in travail at sorrow
[9:52] because the hour is calm
[9:54] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[9:56] child
[9:57] she remembered no more the anguish
[10:00] for joy that a man is born into the
[10:03] world amen amen
[10:05] so she remembers no more the anguish
[10:08] because a man is born into the world
[10:10] psalms 128 and 3
[10:13] amen psalms 128 and 3
[10:17] reads this
[10:19] thy wife shall be a fruitful vine
[10:22] by the sides of thine house
[10:24] and thy children like olive plants round
[10:27] about thy table
[10:29] thy wife shall be a fruitful vine by the
[10:32] sides of that house
[10:33] thy children like olive plants round
[10:36] about thy table one chapter before that
[10:39] psalms 127 and verse 3
[10:42] says
[10:44] lord children are an heritage of the
[10:46] lord
[10:47] and the fruit of the whom
[10:49] is his reward
[10:50] amen children are an heritage of the
[10:52] lord and the fruit of the whom is his
[10:55] reward amen and the lord that blessings
[10:57] to the reading of his word you may be
[10:58] seated
[11:00] amen so just casting our thoughts on
[11:03] motherhood
[11:05] and we know the bible tells us in
[11:07] revelation chapter 13 8 that the lamb of
[11:10] god was slain from before the foundation
[11:13] of the world
[11:14] amen
[11:16] the lamb of god was slain from before
[11:18] the foundation of the world so god by
[11:20] his full knowledge knew that man would
[11:22] fall yes and he already prepared a way
[11:26] for man way back in the beginning for
[11:28] the lamb to be slain
[11:31] and it had to be born on the earth
[11:34] jesus was not going to arrive from
[11:37] heaven a fully grown man
[11:40] like how when god appeared to abraham in
[11:42] genesis 18.
[11:46] he was going to be born into the human
[11:48] race
[11:49] amen
[11:50] so knowing that he had the lamb in the
[11:53] back part of his mind before the
[11:54] foundation of the world and the lamb was
[11:56] slain before the foundation of the world
[11:59] we know that
[12:01] this shows us god's thought about
[12:02] motherhood
[12:04] because if the land had to be born
[12:07] they must be a mother
[12:09] so god thoughts of motherhood from the
[12:11] foundation of the world so through
[12:13] childbearing through motherhood the lamb
[12:16] would be born to save man from their sin
[12:20] so god wanted to display his love to
[12:22] mankind and the first expression
[12:26] of his love is through a mother amen
[12:30] when a child is born before they are
[12:32] aware of anything around them they are
[12:34] welcomed into the world by mother's love
[12:38] amen and they will continue to be
[12:40] surrounded by mother's love
[12:44] all the days of their lives
[12:46] amen amen we find that no matter
[12:50] what a child does he'll always or she'll
[12:52] always be surrounded by mother's love
[12:55] amen
[12:56] a mother's love is the closest
[12:59] expression of god's unconditional love
[13:03] amen
[13:05] a mother's love is an attribute of god
[13:08] because it is unconditional
[13:12] amen we find no matter what a child may
[13:15] do no matter how bad how wrong it may be
[13:18] a mother will always love a child and
[13:21] want to protect her child amen
[13:24] now we're talking about godly mothers
[13:27] we know we are living in satan's eden
[13:29] where god where satan the god of this
[13:32] evil age has corrupted the morals of
[13:34] women so you get cruel women
[13:38] cruel women who rip babies from the whom
[13:42] they call it abortion
[13:44] amen but we are focusing on godly
[13:47] mothers amen the way god intended it to
[13:50] be
[13:51] amen so no matter how old or how
[13:54] wrong and wayward he may be
[13:56] [Music]
[13:57] he could be a grown man but mother's
[13:59] love reaches out to him
[14:02] people may be against him the law may be
[14:04] against him society may be against him
[14:08] but a mother will always want to protect
[14:10] her child
[14:12] why is that it's in a god given nature
[14:15] to love
[14:17] it's in our nature to care
[14:20] to protect to serve the family
[14:23] we know that mother is the fifth gospel
[14:26] amen and she gets them before the
[14:29] teaching of matthew mark luke and john
[14:34] amen
[14:36] mother is the first gospel
[14:39] and mother gets them before the
[14:41] teachings of matthew mark luke and john
[14:46] amen
[14:48] i'm happy to see brother's passion and
[14:50] his family i was worried about them
[14:53] i figured he went to pick up sister
[14:55] sodhi so
[14:57] amen good to see you all this morning
[14:58] god bless you
[14:59] amen
[15:01] so mother gets them before matthew mark
[15:03] luke john
[15:05] so a child will first learn about love
[15:08] the love of god from your mother amen a
[15:11] child will hear the first songs about
[15:13] jesus from mom
[15:15] jesus loves me this i know
[15:18] for the bible tells me so
[15:21] and she'll sing lullabies jesus loves
[15:24] the little children all the children of
[15:27] the world amen amen
[15:29] and the b-i-b-l-e
[15:32] amen that is the book for me
[15:34] amen
[15:36] i know some of you are getting broody
[15:38] now they have children
[15:41] just hold on
[15:42] it's a bit tough racing for children
[15:46] a man
[15:47] but look at the influence of mother
[15:51] before the child is aware of anything
[15:54] you are instilling godly values into
[15:56] that child amen
[15:58] you have the first access to that brain
[16:01] of the child
[16:02] to the heart of the child to the soul of
[16:05] the child amen
[16:07] amen
[16:08] a child will learn its first bible verse
[16:10] from its mother
[16:12] like john 3 16 for god so loved the
[16:15] world that he gave his only begotten son
[16:18] that whosoever believeth in him should
[16:21] not perish but have everlasting life
[16:24] so you find before the sunday school
[16:25] teacher gets the child mom has the child
[16:29] before the school teacher gets the child
[16:31] mom has the child amen
[16:33] amen
[16:35] hallelujah
[16:36] but that is god's pattern
[16:38] why amen
[16:40] it tells you to train it it's giving mom
[16:43] the opportunity to train up the child in
[16:45] the way it should go
[16:48] because when it grows up it will not
[16:50] depart from the faith
[16:52] amen so what does it tell you
[16:55] the four gospels can only point you to
[16:58] jesus
[16:59] to the love of jesus amen but the fifth
[17:02] gospel expresses the love of jesus to
[17:05] you
[17:07] amen
[17:08] the four gospels is just a written word
[17:13] it has no emotion to it
[17:15] for you to experience the four gospels
[17:18] in its entirety you must be baptized
[17:20] with the holy ghost
[17:22] then it will come alive
[17:24] amen but before you even counter that
[17:26] baptism of the holy ghost you have one
[17:29] expression mother's love
[17:32] amen the love of jesus expressed through
[17:35] that fifth gospel
[17:39] so we we want to love and appreciate all
[17:41] godly mothers this morning and remember
[17:43] the labels of love they live they
[17:45] sacrifice
[17:47] to the children to the family
[17:49] we also want to remember the moms who
[17:51] have gone to rest
[17:52] whom we miss and we love dearly
[17:56] mothers in the church
[17:58] in another dimension
[18:01] not even a few feet from where i am
[18:03] right now
[18:05] amen
[18:06] hallelujah
[18:08] you know brother branches we are bumping
[18:09] into our theophanies
[18:11] so if your theophany is in that sixth
[18:13] dimension and you're bumping into your
[18:15] theophany
[18:16] then they are right here
[18:19] a cloud of witnesses
[18:21] amen hallelujah
[18:23] son of man revealed ministries has
[18:26] another branch in the sixth dimension
[18:30] they have a pastor
[18:31] amen and a few congregants here
[18:35] amen and there's the son of man revealed
[18:38] ministries here
[18:40] amen both alive
[18:43] one more life than we are
[18:45] one more young than we are
[18:47] amen hallelujah
[18:50] what a glorious hope that is amen
[18:52] hallelujah we are so feeble and feeling
[18:55] miserable this morning but they in the
[18:57] spring of their life amen
[19:00] amen
[19:01] amen hallelujah so amen we cannot wait
[19:06] to be united with them they left us with
[19:08] their beautiful memories and instilled
[19:10] in us values that we will carry with us
[19:13] and instill in our own children and
[19:15] others
[19:16] amen so we look at the first woman in
[19:19] the bible the first mother and we know
[19:21] eve was the mother now we're just
[19:23] talking about the male sounds cain able
[19:26] and sith
[19:27] we know that in genesis 3 16 the lord
[19:30] told eve i will greatly multiply thy
[19:33] sorrow and thy conception
[19:36] in sorrow thou shalt bring for children
[19:38] and that desire shall be to thy husband
[19:41] he shall rule over thee then in chapter
[19:43] four verse one and adam knew his wife
[19:46] and she conceived and became
[19:51] and said i have gotten a man from the
[19:53] lord
[19:54] and she again bare his brother abel
[19:57] then in 425 it says adam knew his wife
[20:00] again
[20:02] now notice there was only two knowings
[20:04] there
[20:05] right right he doesn't say adam knew his
[20:07] wife she became adam knew his wife she
[20:10] bear able
[20:12] if you read that old chapter you'll see
[20:14] they're talking about the lineage
[20:16] and every time a man and wife come
[20:18] together and they conceive it talks
[20:20] about new his wife
[20:22] and here adam only knew his wife twice
[20:26] showing you
[20:28] the hidden mystery there
[20:30] and that is why
[20:32] eve does not say i have gotten a son
[20:34] from the lord
[20:36] amen she said that god made man from the
[20:38] lord it was not her son
[20:40] well yeah it was a son in a way but you
[20:42] know what i mean
[20:44] amen it came from the serpent amen the
[20:46] serpent seed
[20:48] amen
[20:50] so he knew his wife again and she bare
[20:51] his son and called his name sith for god
[20:54] said
[20:55] had for god for she said god had
[20:58] appointed me another seed instead of
[21:00] abel whom king slew now thought this
[21:02] morning is from a barren woman to a
[21:05] fruitful vine
[21:08] because
[21:09] brother brennan tells us that
[21:11] adam was given a wife to reproduce
[21:14] himself
[21:16] amen
[21:18] adam was given a wife to reproduce
[21:20] himself
[21:22] so if a woman is barren and unfruitful
[21:26] how are they going to
[21:28] bring about the plan of god because god
[21:30] told them be fruitful and multiplied
[21:34] now we find a few women who are barren
[21:36] in the bible now after god had done
[21:38] dealing with adam and eve
[21:40] you don't find him talking about them
[21:41] again
[21:42] right when he drove them from the garden
[21:45] you'll get the genealogy of how they
[21:47] bear the children and you don't hear
[21:49] about them again
[21:52] when he's dealing with another man that
[21:54] man has already has big children noah
[21:58] but when he starts his family
[22:00] in a new world
[22:02] with abraham he chooses a man
[22:06] and that his wife is barren
[22:11] so how is she going to fulfill genesis
[22:14] amen be fruitful and multiply in a
[22:17] better condition
[22:20] amen so we find in genesis 25 in genesis
[22:23] 21
[22:24] the lord visited sarah as he had said
[22:27] and the lord did unto sarah as he had
[22:30] spoken
[22:33] so we are reading the end of it
[22:36] when a baroness
[22:38] turned to be a fruitful vine
[22:41] but i want you to know it was the
[22:43] genesis 18 account
[22:47] a word descending from another dimension
[22:50] amen coming into this dimension
[22:54] amen when
[22:56] abraham saw three coming towards him
[23:00] amen the mighty angel had descended
[23:03] and he was coming there amen and he gave
[23:06] them a promise according to the time of
[23:09] life
[23:10] he was bringing back title deed to them
[23:12] he was bringing back inheritance to them
[23:15] amen so we find if the evil soul with
[23:18] the pride that's why revelation 10 is so
[23:21] important to us
[23:23] because prior to that seven church ages
[23:25] was a barren unfruitful wife
[23:30] but we receive communication and
[23:32] nourishment from another world from
[23:34] another dimension
[23:36] in revelation 10 when that mighty angel
[23:38] descends
[23:40] is bringing back the title deed of man's
[23:42] inheritance
[23:44] amen
[23:45] we find here that's
[23:47] genesis 21 and 2 it says for sarah
[23:50] conceived and bear abraham his son in
[23:53] his old age
[23:55] at the set time of which god had spoken
[23:58] to him now don't get confused with that
[24:00] scripture
[24:02] you'll say but you message people are
[24:04] preaching that god turned abraham and
[24:07] sarah back to a young man and woman
[24:09] again amen
[24:12] he was a 75 year old young looking man
[24:22] backwards like some backyard mechanic
[24:25] on the clock
[24:26] [Music]
[24:29] garden re-agent
[24:32] he just made him young again
[24:34] amen that's why the bible is saying that
[24:37] sarah
[24:39] bear abraham hassan in his old age
[24:43] so
[24:44] according to the timeline yes he was
[24:46] that age but he was in a young body
[24:48] again
[24:49] amen and at the set time of which god
[24:52] had spoken to him
[24:54] and abraham called the name of the son
[24:56] that was born unto him whom sarah bare
[24:58] to him isaac
[25:01] i want you to know that abraham's seed
[25:05] will never be barren
[25:07] right
[25:08] abraham's seed will never be unfruitful
[25:11] amen
[25:12] hello blessing our blessing amen
[25:16] oh this morning i hope we know that we
[25:18] are abraham's sheep
[25:20] through the royal sheep amen
[25:22] and the blessings that apply to abraham
[25:24] apply to you and i am amen in blessing i
[25:28] will bless you
[25:30] amen
[25:32] abraham's seed will never be unfruitful
[25:34] or barren right amen we find it wasn't
[25:37] only the case with sarah here's the case
[25:39] with rebecca
[25:41] daughter-in-law
[25:44] the chosen one
[25:45] the one who eliza sent across the desert
[25:48] to go and find she can't have children
[25:50] she's barren
[25:52] and in in genesis 25 and 21 isaac and
[25:55] treated the lord for his wife because
[25:57] she was barren
[26:00] amen and the lord was entreated of him
[26:03] and rebecca his wife conceived amen
[26:07] we are speaking about from barrenness to
[26:10] a fruitful vine
[26:13] so rebecca bore two children jacob and
[26:16] esau
[26:18] amen
[26:19] then we come in
[26:21] now another generation goes
[26:26] and lord is working through jacob jacob
[26:30] takes a wife
[26:32] amen we know he has given the wrong wife
[26:34] then he has two wives
[26:37] leah
[26:39] couldn't have children initially
[26:41] rachel couldn't have children and the
[26:43] bible reads in genesis 29 31 and when
[26:46] the lord saw that leah was hated he
[26:48] opened up
[26:50] oh glory hallelujah that shows you that
[26:54] god is in charge of opening and closing
[26:57] people's homes you are not here by
[26:59] chance
[27:00] if you are here today amen sitting here
[27:03] and hearing my voice god had
[27:07] amen so that you can be an expression of
[27:10] himself here on the earth today
[27:13] amen
[27:16] he opened up a home but rachel was
[27:18] barren
[27:21] amen
[27:22] and here conceived and bears son so leah
[27:24] has four sons
[27:26] consecutively she has ruben she has
[27:29] simeon she has levi and she has judah
[27:33] four children
[27:35] amen
[27:37] then we know the servants the seven
[27:39] girls get involved and rachel gives a
[27:41] servant girl
[27:43] amen
[27:44] and i want you to know this is typing
[27:47] the four anointings
[27:49] because jacob is surrounded by four
[27:51] women
[27:53] amen four women bear him children
[27:57] four women bear him the twelve sons
[28:00] so he is god's four anointings
[28:03] the lion the ox the man and the eagle
[28:05] amen
[28:06] amen think of the heavenly kingdom how
[28:08] it's set up
[28:10] amen amen with the twelve foundations
[28:14] the four gates yes they typed in jacob's
[28:17] life
[28:19] amen
[28:20] and we find that amen after
[28:23] rachel prays to the lord and in genesis
[28:26] 30 it says god remembered rachel amen
[28:31] god has not forgotten you
[28:34] you may have been praying about his
[28:35] situation
[28:37] keep holding on
[28:39] keep believing amen
[28:41] god has not forgotten you
[28:44] it says and god remembered rachel and
[28:47] hearkened to her and opened up her home
[28:52] and she conceived and bear sand and said
[28:55] god had taken away my reproach and she
[28:58] called his name joseph
[29:02] and said
[29:03] what's your prophesy now the lord shall
[29:06] add to me another
[29:10] amen hallelujah
[29:13] don't be satisfied with just one
[29:15] blessing amen amen she had just received
[29:18] one son
[29:19] and she says the lord will add to me
[29:21] another
[29:22] she prophesied by faith amen hallelujah
[29:26] you remember the time when when the king
[29:29] when the prophet told the king how many
[29:31] arrows take it and throw it
[29:34] you remember that time
[29:37] he could have taken 100 arrows and
[29:39] thrown it
[29:40] but he only took a certain amount and
[29:42] the prophet rebuked him for that
[29:44] and he says because you have only taken
[29:47] three arrows only three times you will
[29:49] smite them
[29:50] so i'm saying when god is blessing you
[29:54] speak life to it
[29:56] amen don't be satisfied that you had
[29:59] wine in the wedding eggman and when the
[30:02] wine is finished you say oh i am
[30:04] satisfied i have drunk all the wine
[30:07] ask god for more
[30:09] even if there's no wine you will turn
[30:11] water into wine
[30:13] amen don't be satisfied with your
[30:15] current situation
[30:17] don't be satisfied with your current
[30:19] circumstance amen
[30:27] amen
[30:30] amen hallelujah
[30:32] amen we find here that rachel's home was
[30:36] open and she bought joseph we know later
[30:38] on she bought benjamin
[30:41] so god is turning this woman's
[30:43] barrenness to be a fruitful vine
[30:47] amen
[30:48] we see joseph
[30:50] and moses amen
[30:52] how she valued a child this was a mother
[30:58] the threat of pharaoh
[31:00] the threat upon the life of a son
[31:03] to kill them
[31:05] but she she knew how to protect the
[31:07] world
[31:08] she knew that he was a proper son
[31:11] she went about to protect the world
[31:14] and if you know that this word is the
[31:16] proper word then you'll take this word
[31:19] and hide it in your heart amen

[31:24] not a denominational creed and a dogma

[40:14] amen
[40:16] my little children of whom i travail in
[40:19] birth again
[40:20] he's talking about birth pains
[40:23] he's saying i'm laboring in the gospel
[40:25] for something
[40:28] that you can bring forth the life of
[40:30] christ
[40:31] my little children of whom i travail in
[40:34] birth again until christ be formed in
[40:38] you
[40:40] [Music]
[40:42] amen
[40:43] first timothy 2 and 14
[40:48] first timothy 2 and 14
[40:51] the apostle paul you're dealing with
[40:53] the first mother
[40:56] he says adam was not deceived but the
[40:58] woman being deceived was in the
[41:00] transgression
[41:01] not withstanding
[41:04] she shall be saved in child bearing
[41:10] i mean if you are getting the concept of
[41:12] that scripture
[41:13] he's talking about eve being deceived
[41:16] but in order for eve to be saved she
[41:19] need to continue with childbearing
[41:21] because the promise was given to her
[41:24] amen
[41:26] that the seed of the women will prove
[41:28] the serpent's head
[41:30] amen so you read the scripture with
[41:32] understanding the woman being deceived
[41:35] was in transgression not withstanding
[41:37] she shall be saved in childbearing
[41:41] amen because
[41:43] one of the seed was going to be the lord
[41:46] jesus christ even though they didn't
[41:47] know who it was
[41:49] when joseph came they thought he was the
[41:51] one
[41:52] when moses came they thought he was the
[41:54] one
[41:55] but god could have no confidence in none
[41:57] of these men
[41:59] amen but there was one pawn of eversion
[42:03] amen the spotless sinless land
[42:07] so in order for them to continue to be
[42:10] saved
[42:11] for mankind to be saved
[42:13] then god had to open sarah's home god
[42:16] had to open rebecca's room god had to
[42:19] open leah's room god had to open
[42:21] rachel's room god had to open hannah's
[42:24] home
[42:26] amen he was turning baroness into a
[42:29] fruitful vine because from the seed of
[42:31] the woman
[42:32] was going to come forth the deliverer
[42:38] so woman was going to be saying through
[42:40] child bearing
[42:42] because the lamb that was from before
[42:43] the foundation of the world was going to
[42:45] be injected into the human race
[42:49] amen
[42:51] second peter 1 and 8
[42:53] now dealing with the church
[42:56] amen
[42:58] dealing with the church now
[43:00] talking about you know what second peter
[43:03] one is about talking about those seven
[43:05] virtues from faith
[43:07] to charity
[43:09] it says if these things be in you
[43:13] and abound
[43:15] they make you that you shall neither be
[43:18] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[43:21] of our lord jesus christ
[43:29] amen there's only one woman like this
[43:31] who have come through all seven church
[43:32] ages all seven steps
[43:37] amen that now has the knowledge
[43:40] the revelation of jesus christ
[43:43] you shall neither be barren nor
[43:46] unfruitful
[43:49] amen
[43:52] romans 8 verse 19

[43:58] page through your bibles romans 8 19
[44:01] amen
[44:03] for the earnest expectation of the
[44:05] creature
[44:07] waited for the manifestation
[44:10] of the sons of god
[44:14] oh hallelujah
[44:17] the earnest expectation
[44:19] the earth is in travail creation is in
[44:23] travail
[44:24] waiting
[44:26] for the sons of god to be born
[44:28] [Music]
[44:30] amen
[44:32] read again for the earnest expectation
[44:35] of the creature waited for the
[44:37] manifestation of the sons of god in
[44:39] verse 22 for we know that the all
[44:42] creation groaneth and prevail it in pain
[44:45] together until now
[44:50] what pain is that birth pains
[44:54] amen
[44:56] and not
[44:57] only they
[44:58] but we ourselves also have birth pains
[45:02] which are the first fruits of the spirit
[45:04] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[45:08] waiting for the adoption
[45:12] to with the redemption of our bodies
[45:18] [Music]
[45:19] why are we going here amen we're gonna
[45:22] close with this thought
[45:27] jesus does not want a barren and
[45:29] unfruitful wife
[45:32] amen
[45:34] we've had seven church ages of it
[45:37] and when the husband came home at
[45:39] evening time
[45:40] he was knocking at the door to gain
[45:42] entrance into his house
[45:44] but the woman would not let him in
[45:47] amen
[45:52] now bringing it to light this quote
[45:56] that the bride has the mind of christ
[45:58] and she knows what he once done with the
[46:00] word
[46:02] jesus told us the word is a seed
[46:06] a man gives seed
[46:10] so the bride has the mind of christ
[46:13] she knows what he once done with his
[46:15] seed
[46:18] so she must take in his seed by taking
[46:21] in the word
[46:22] you are taking in his
[46:24] seed
[46:25] by eating the book
[46:28] amen remember what we spoke the last
[46:30] time eating signifies
[46:34] it signified
[46:35] a relationship between a man and a woman
[46:37] amen
[46:39] right remember that scripture that says
[46:40] and the doubts this woman eateth wipe in
[46:43] the mouth and says i have done no wrong
[46:44] amen
[46:46] so here we are in the end time
[46:49] jesus knocking at the door
[46:51] he wouldn't let him in
[46:53] he was coming
[46:54] home through seven church ages he says
[46:57] lest i come lest i come and here he was
[47:00] right there
[47:01] now he had come
[47:03] and he was knocking
[47:05] yet they wouldn't open up to jesus
[47:09] amen
[47:12] and we know amen how he had sent the
[47:14] prophet to find him a bride a type of
[47:16] eliezer
[47:18] finding a bride for the lord jesus
[47:20] christ
[47:21] and how he had to take her through those
[47:22] seven steps of faith virtue knowledge
[47:25] temperance patience
[47:27] godliness brotherly kindness all the way
[47:30] to charity
[47:32] amen and bring her to this place that
[47:35] she is now the built-up church the
[47:37] pyramid city
[47:40] amen waiting for the camp strong
[47:45] amen
[47:47] the capstone of love
[47:49] crying grace
[47:51] grace
[47:54] amen
[47:55] what do we find amen that jesus now how
[47:58] is all creation groaning waiting for the
[48:01] manifestation of the sons of god
[48:05] you can only have sons of god
[48:08] if jesus and his wife have children
[48:14] hello
[48:16] what does that mean will you have little
[48:17] children no
[48:18] you must reproduce the life of christ
[48:22] you must reproduce the life of christ
[48:24] that is you bringing forth
[48:26] children for christ amen right
[48:30] we looked at extensively and all the
[48:32] women in the bible those that were
[48:34] barren how god had turned their
[48:36] barrenness
[48:37] to a fruitful vine
[48:39] we looked at genesis
[48:41] now we come to revelation
[48:43] and we see two women here
[48:47] amen
[48:48] both mothers
[48:50] in revelation 12 you'll find a great one
[48:52] day in heaven a woman clothed with the
[48:54] sun moon under her feet
[48:57] head crowned 12 stars
[48:59] and she being a child cried
[49:03] travailing in birth and pained to be
[49:06] delivered
[49:07] and they appeared another one day in
[49:09] heaven and behold a great red dragon
[49:11] having seven heads ten horns seven
[49:13] crowns and upon his head and his tail
[49:16] drew a third part of
[49:18] the stars of heaven and did cast them to
[49:20] the earth
[49:21] and the dragon stood before the woman
[49:23] which was ready to be delivered for to
[49:26] devour a child as soon as it was born
[49:29] and she brought forth a man child which
[49:31] was to rule all nations with a rod of
[49:33] iron and a child was caught up to god
[49:36] unto god and to his throne
[49:38] and the woman fled into the wilderness
[49:40] where she had a place prepared of god
[49:43] that they should feed her
[49:45] a thousand two hundred and three squad
[49:47] days amen
[49:49] so here's a woman
[49:51] amen giving birth
[49:54] in revelation 12
[49:57] but we find another woman
[49:59] in revelation 17
[50:04] revelation 17 says he carried me away in
[50:06] the spirit into the wilderness and i saw
[50:09] a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast
[50:13] and the woman was arrayed in purple
[50:15] and a scarlet color
[50:18] and decked with gold precious stones of
[50:20] pearls having a golden cup in a handful
[50:23] of abominations and filthiness of
[50:26] fornication
[50:30] so this woman was having children
[50:32] out of wedlock right
[50:35] why
[50:36] she's a cage of every hateful bird she's
[50:40] a cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[50:45] and upon her head
[50:47] was a name written
[50:49] mystery babylon
[50:51] the great
[50:53] the mother of harlots
[50:56] she's a mother
[51:01] the mother of harlots and abominations
[51:04] of the earth
[51:07] how many of you know satan only copies
[51:10] what god does
[51:12] because god is now establishing his
[51:14] kingdom
[51:16] god has selected a wife for himself
[51:19] and this wife is reproducing his life
[51:22] right
[51:24] so jesus and his family
[51:27] but here we find in satan's even
[51:29] he's also got a woman
[51:32] a
[51:34] and she has daughters
[51:37] harlow daughters
[51:38] abomination of the earth amen amen
[51:42] you look at the big fine fancy buildings
[51:46] in fact if you go to these buildings you
[51:48] can't help but stand
[51:51] and wonder
[51:52] you are whole
[51:54] it's like beautiful
[51:55] [Music]
[51:58] but
[51:58] [Music]
[52:00] think of it
[52:01] the bible says abomination of the earth
[52:04] amen i'll close with this quote
[52:07] [Music]
[52:08] jesus in the rapture message
[52:11] jesus wants fruit for himself
[52:15] his wife must bring forth the kind of
[52:18] children that he is
[52:22] then if you don't bring forth children
[52:25] bright children
[52:27] were children then it's the
[52:29] denominational
[52:30] child then her first love
[52:33] for the world and denomination she's
[52:36] gone back to that
[52:38] but it and it can't bring forth a real
[52:40] genuine born-again christian
[52:43] because there's nothing there to bring
[52:45] it forth
[52:49] so what is jesus looking for
[52:52] you to bring for children
[52:54] to bring forth bright children
[52:56] were children to be a real born-again
[53:00] christian amen
[53:02] amen so this morning even as we dwelt on
[53:06] motherhood
[53:08] if we have not been
[53:09] we don't have the life of christ within
[53:11] us
[53:13] we don't have the fruits of the spirit
[53:15] amen we find that that word born again
[53:18] christian seems foreign to us
[53:20] right
[53:22] amen
[53:23] if somebody asks you are you a
[53:25] born-again christian you're almost
[53:30] it's almost like a natural response of
[53:32] how the prophet asked somebody are you a
[53:33] christian amen and they say i allow you
[53:35] to believe i'm catholic
[53:39] you know we shouldn't be that way in the
[53:40] message oh i i'm in the message
[53:43] no are you a born again christian amen
[53:46] amen say yes brother sister
[53:49] and i'm filled with the holy ghost
[53:52] amen hallelujah
[53:54] how about you
[53:57] they ask you are you born again
[53:58] christian said how about you
[54:01] amen and then say how were you baptized
[54:04] amen
[54:06] amen
[54:07] they'll tell you
[54:09] we were baptized according to j.f
[54:11] rowlands
[54:13] baptism in the name of the father son
[54:15] and holy ghost
[54:17] he says oh you were baptized according
[54:19] to that baptism have you not heard of
[54:22] acts 2 and verse 38. amen
[54:25] a jew backslidden people need to repent
[54:28] and be baptized
[54:30] in the name
[54:32] of the lord jesus christ amen amen for
[54:35] the remission of your sins and you shall
[54:39] receive
[54:41] the holy ghost
[54:43] amen you see why they are wandering
[54:45] around without the holy ghost
[54:47] the baptism is wrong
[54:50] amen
[54:52] hallelujah but there's a bride was not
[54:55] ashamed to be identified with his name
[54:57] amen amen will proudly display the
[54:59] banner of the lord jesus christ
[55:02] proudly got the blood on display
[55:04] amen amen oh bless the name of jesus so
[55:08] god wants to turn your barrenness this
[55:10] morning
[55:11] into a fruitful vine
[55:12] amen
[55:14] maybe maybe it's a more simple thing
[55:17] maybe in your service to the lord you
[55:18] are barren
[55:24] and you're just serving the lord
[55:26] maybe take a simple thing like coming to
[55:28] church
[55:29] you are barren

[55:31] you are dry
[55:36] god can take that barrenness
[55:38] and turn it into a fruitful vine
[55:41] amen
[55:42] maybe your zeal for the lord is god
[55:45] and you are barren
[55:46] god can turn it around amen
[55:49] maybe you're serving the lord now
[55:51] on your own terms and your own
[55:53] conditions
[55:56] maybe you're serving the lord when it is
[55:58] convenient for you
[56:02] don't serve the lord that way
[56:05] even if it's inconvenient
[56:07] serve the lord
[56:09] amen
[56:11] even if it's inconvenient
[56:14] serve the lord
[56:16] put an effort into the things of god
[56:19] say but all it's just a small gathering
[56:22] they won't even miss me
[56:24] we miss you even more when it's a small
[56:26] gathering
[56:28] amen no
[56:31] that's just a wednesday service
[56:33] just a sunday service i'll go next week
[56:38] baroness
[56:40] no zeal
[56:42] no desire there's a barrenness there
[56:46] amen amen no love for the people of god
[56:50] parent
[56:52] but jesus said by this shall all men
[56:54] know that you are my disciples if you
[56:56] have love one for another
[56:59] [Music]
[57:00] in that maybe we are barren
[57:06] the only thing the only time we talk
[57:08] about somebody else you should talk
[57:10] bring them down and tear them down
[57:12] right to talk stories about somebody
[57:17] how about a good report
[57:19] how about a good testimony
[57:22] amen
[57:23] love covers a multitude of sin
[57:27] you hate without the cause
[57:30] amen
[57:33] you love nobody and you hate without the
[57:35] cause
[57:37] barren
[57:38] unfruitful
[57:42] some of you waiting for this
[57:44] maybe your finances are barren
[57:49] hey
[57:50] it's like old mother hubble who looked
[57:52] in the cupboard
[57:56] hey
[57:57] but you want god to only turn that one
[58:00] that barrelness to fruitfulness
[58:04] and he will do it
[58:05] because it's part of the blessings
[58:08] but we only want to be selective
[58:11] but let him turn our barrenness say lord
[58:13] i want the life of christ in me
[58:16] i want to reproduce your life
[58:19] amen i want to love

[59:06] heart but we want to be proud and
[59:08] arrogant how short and who i am
[59:11] till death do us part i will inflict
[59:14] vengeance upon them
[59:18] that's not a fruitful vine

[59:31] let us love
[59:32] the world is deprived of love
[59:36] we opened up telling about mother's love
[59:38] the world is deprived of love and you
[59:40] know people can sense when you love them
[59:43] people can sense when you care for them

[59:48] be the fruitful vine of our lord jesus
[59:50] christ and bring forth his life that
[59:52] they will really see you and say you
[59:54] know what you remind me of jesus
[59:57] because only jesus loves like this then
[1:00:00] now you become an expression of his
[1:00:02] attribute of love
