[31:22] beat and worship there
[31:23] although he wrote many psalms you know

[31:54] the whale's belly
[31:56] and he looked towards the temple yes he

[32:26] and where he put
[32:29] amen amen we give him all the praise
[32:31] amen and all the glory
[32:33] you know we we're hearing home time and
[32:36] see all the signs
[32:38] the events you know in spite of uh
[32:41] some countries are hit with their with
[32:43] their virus

[32:51] temple is
[32:53] they've got hurricanes and and a lot of
[32:56] destruction and damage and all these
[32:58] things
[32:59] so besides the coveting they're getting
[33:00] even behind the things
[33:02] and earthquakes you know in uh lebanon
[33:07] they had the blast over there and so
[33:09] many people are homeless so many people
[33:10] kill
[33:11] yeah and uh they're going to be
[33:13] disastrous after disasters
[33:16] but we know we are hearing all the time
[33:18] and jesus said in
[33:19] luke 21 all these things must come up
[33:21] for me amen
[33:22] so we are trusting you know we are
[33:24] believing and trusting we are in the
[33:26] last days
[33:27] amen uh we can see nations are actually
[33:30] preparing for war now and they're
[33:32] actually
[33:33] in the seas
[33:36] and aircraft training amen for a while
[33:39] we can see that all around us yes
[33:43] so we just be faithful
[33:46] be faithful and serve him and say lord
[33:48] just give us grace
[33:49] amen amen he also
[33:52] still want to remember he's recovering
[33:56] quite well amen just that he's got a
[33:58] he's got a bag
[33:59] that you know is uh collecting water
[34:04] about 150 to 200 milliliters per day
[34:09] so they want to find a way to stop that
[34:12] blockage
[34:13] you know it's got a bag and drain it
[34:16] from the lung
[34:17] see so uh i was encouraging him and
[34:20] telling him you know what the woman of
[34:22] the issue of blood yes
[34:24] amen amen
[34:27] he said if you can only touch the hem of
[34:28] his garment yes
[34:30] yes and the bible said she was healed
[34:31] instantly amen
[34:34] she was passing blood for 12 years damn
[34:36] amen
[34:37] but instantly it stopped amen so we know
[34:40] god can stop that
[34:41] yes wherever that water is coming and
[34:44] he's uncomfortable getting the bag and
[34:46] sleeping is a bit painful and all but
[34:48] let's pray for him that
[34:49] god will totally deliver him and be
[34:52] driven off the bank
[34:55] also you know remember brother lionel
[34:58] and his family
[34:59] is being transferred to johnsburg uh
[35:03] work working later he's gonna i think
[35:06] he's gonna go sort of the company up
[35:07] there
[35:08] some issues over there and then that
[35:10] there's gonna be in mid-range
[35:13] so he's got a few churches that he's
[35:15] going to decide whether they're going to
[35:16] fellowship there
[35:17] so we pray the lord lead him to the
[35:19] right fellowship
[35:21] and remember them in prayer i was
[35:23] telling them we're going to miss their
[35:25] children singing yes in the group here
[35:28] when they come to sing
[35:30] but pray god will be with them and uh
[35:31] remember them in prayer
[35:33] that uh you know everything will go
[35:35] according to the will of the lord
[35:36] amen so he's the family is living
[35:39] tomorrow morning to jerusalem
[35:41] so uh so you won't be with us so
[35:44] we're going to miss them so we pray god
[35:46] bless them anyway amen amen

[36:32] amen we're happy to have our apostle
[36:34] shane with us
[36:37] to sacrifice the time and uh
[36:40] they've also been out of church for from
[36:42] their lock down there

[36:46] to the school and use the place and all
[36:48] but i think they're going back this week
[36:50] after so many months and then so we pray
[36:53] god will bless them and the believers
[36:54] out there
[36:55] i've preached there quite a few times
[36:57] and i tell you there is a simple humble
[36:59] group of people

[37:23] amen the lord healed him and he's
[37:26] being going around a few services
[37:28] churches blessing them with the word
[37:30] amen so we thank god he spurred him
[37:34] that he can still preach the word praise

[37:52] needs
[37:53] amen say there's nothing about god he
[37:55] knows all our needs

[38:05] people coming to church

[38:19] while thinking on those thoughts
[38:22] the prophet tells us many times
[38:25] god showed him exactly where people are
[38:28] sitting
[38:30] before the service could start
[38:33] while he was at home god showed him
[38:35] exactly who was sitting there
[38:37] amen so god is mindful amen and you also
[38:40] show them exactly what color of clothing
[38:42] and everything they're sitting

[39:00] he had a heart problem and the doctor he
[39:03] saw the doctor examining him a few days
[39:05] ago
[39:06] and telling him you're going to lose an
[39:07] eyesight amen
[39:10] right over there in the sunset mountain
[39:12] but he said
[39:14] the lord has healed you amen amen amen
[39:17] and he said beside that before you leave
[39:19] home

[39:28] some problem with the leg i don't know
[39:30] what it was
[39:33] some leg vague problem or whatever it is
[39:35] please tell brother branham to pray for
[39:37] me

[45:52] we have a wonderful message yes
[45:55] that's the message of the hour it
[45:58] teaches us
[45:59] he brings us to a position sometimes we
[46:02] may not remain
[46:03] you know we may just feel why it is like
[46:06] this way
[46:07] but we fail to realize that god is
[46:09] shaping us amen and holding us
[46:12] to that perfection spoken of amen
[46:16] so as the pastor said it only takes
[46:18] death
[46:20] to be there but now we have the word
[46:23] amen
[46:24] to be in position whereby we would be
[46:27] glad to see
[46:28] that we are the word bright and we are
[46:30] bringing the rapture amen and let us
[46:32] give our hearty hand to the lord
[46:34] [Applause]
[46:38] i want to speak on a subject matter this
[46:40] morning
[46:42] uh the capstone revelation of himself
[46:47] amen praise the lord amen and in search
[46:50] there
[46:51] is this the time when brandon brought a
[46:54] subject matter
[46:55] pertaining to that no man
[46:58] and it's revelation chapter 10 1-7
[47:02] we have your bibles let's get to it amen
[47:05] amen
[47:07] i'm so glad that the pastor of this
[47:10] church here has such
[47:11] wonderful ministers coming up the joshua
[47:15] the sunny brother adrian coming up
[47:18] wonderful
[47:19] musicians that are here and it only
[47:21] takes the grace of god in the
[47:23] functioning of his spirit to perform
[47:26] that which he has purposed amen
[47:28] for them in their lives to be a blessing
[47:30] to a passion
[47:31] of the bride of jesus christ on the side
[47:34] of eternity
[47:35] may god be praised amen
[47:38] john was caught up in the isle of patmos
[47:42] and when he was caught up in the isle of
[47:44] patmos
[47:45] and he opened up and in revelation
[47:48] chapter 10 it says
[47:50] chapter 10 he says and i saw
[47:54] that means john saw another mighty angel
[47:59] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[48:02] upon
[48:03] his head now the question arises now
[48:07] church
[48:08] why did john say and i saw another
[48:11] mighty angel
[48:13] why didn't john say i saw an angel
[48:16] why did he say i saw another mighty
[48:19] angel
[48:20] let's catch it and the rainbow was upon
[48:23] his head
[48:24] speaking of the covenant and his face
[48:26] says it where the
[48:28] the sun and his feet has pillars of fire
[48:31] amen hallelujah
[48:32] one day we wonder now why all these
[48:34] things are happening
[48:35] feet as pillars of fire so there were
[48:38] men
[48:39] that were ordained by the pillar of fire
[48:42] to take something and give it
[48:46] into the hearts of the believer in that
[48:48] right
[48:49] there's two and he had his hand
[48:52] his hand he had his hand in his hand a
[48:55] little
[48:56] book open amen the book was open
[49:00] um and he set his right foot upon the
[49:03] sea
[49:05] and his left foot on the earth
[49:09] the book was open amen but nobody read
[49:12] it
[49:14] something was happening
[49:18] and he climbed with a loud voice as when
[49:20] a lion wrote it
[49:22] and when he had cried seven thunders
[49:23] after their voices
[49:25] hallelujah sounded their voices
[49:28] just correlated and when the seven
[49:30] thunders had under their voices
[49:33] i was about to write
[49:39] i was about to write and i heard
[49:43] a voice from heaven amen amen
[49:47] hear a voice from heaven saying unto me
[49:51] seal up those things which the seven
[49:53] thunders uttered
[49:54] amen and write them not
[49:59] he was given permission to be caught up
[50:02] in the isle of patmos
[50:05] wrote the book of revelation jesus
[50:06] himself wrote the book of revelation
[50:08] but he was there as a revelator just to
[50:10] come and give these
[50:12] uh scriptures for our admonition written
[50:15] in the bible
[50:16] and we say now hey but how come now
[50:19] what's going on here
[50:21] right he said write them not
[50:24] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[50:27] sea
[50:28] and upon the earth which angel not when
[50:30] he saw another almighty
[50:32] so that means there was a an angel there
[50:35] he was standing upon who where he stood
[50:38] to stand upon the sea
[50:40] and upon the earth this angel
[50:44] will have power over roman america
[50:49] okay catch and lifted up his hand to
[50:53] heaven the other hand he raised it up to
[50:55] heaven
[50:55] i'm taking authority over the papacy
[50:58] here
[50:59] they can't take advantage over my
[51:00] ministry i am the elijah that came from
[51:03] america
[51:04] amen i didn't have malachi chapter four
[51:06] relationship one chapter 1-7
[51:08] i am the one that's going to have that
[51:10] authority and denounce the satanic
[51:12] powers
[51:13] and give revelation and power to the
[51:15] blood of jesus christ
[51:18] and sway by him that liveth forever and
[51:20] ever
[51:21] who created heaven and the things that
[51:24] they're in our
[51:25] and the earth and the things that
[51:27] they're in out
[51:28] and the sea and the things which are
[51:31] they
[51:31] aim that they should be kind no longer
[51:44] amen our blood is in our darkness of our
[51:48] heart
[51:56] amen we have the supremacy we have the
[51:59] power
[52:00] amen it all was performed at calvary
[52:02] amendment
[52:05] to destroy the words of the devil yes
[52:08] but the devil cannot destroy us
[52:12] hallelujah amen amen but in the days of
[52:16] the voice
[52:16] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[52:20] to sound
[52:20] wow there's a changing dispensation
[52:24] the mystery of god in this great mystery
[52:27] this great mystery the capstone
[52:29] revelation of himself
[52:31] this great mystery about the goddess
[52:34] will be finished as he had declared to
[52:36] his servants
[52:37] the prophets may take the company god
[52:40] bless you
[52:41] thank you
[52:44] so there were a lot of key verses in
[52:46] there
[52:49] that sometimes we may read it on
[52:51] casually
[52:53] but you see brother branham was a word
[52:55] prophet
[52:56] and being a word prophet he was directed
[52:59] brother
[53:00] america he was directed
[53:04] spiritually amen to conduct
[53:08] his god-given ability
[53:11] amen and power and ministry
[53:14] to a god-given people to go into the
[53:17] rapture
[53:19] there will be some that will not chase
[53:20] death but they will be caught up
[53:23] and now we need to understand amen amen
[53:27] i'm so glad that i could be identified
[53:29] with your pastor
[53:30] amen because your pastor has the ability
[53:35] of getting from god to feed you amen
[53:38] i've been listening to the brethren here
[53:41] that has
[53:42] been ministering the word of the lord
[53:44] and the pastor ministering the word of
[53:46] the lord
[53:47] and you know i was praying when he told
[53:51] me a few weeks ago and i've been praying
[53:52] and said lord
[53:53] what am i what are you going to
[53:56] give me that i could be used
[54:01] in this ministry for your church in the
[54:04] son of man ministry
[54:05] amen then i
[54:10] suddenly this this thought that i was
[54:13] reading church ages
[54:14] the capstone revelation of himself
[54:18] then i said now lord how would i know
[54:22] now
[54:22] whether everything is okay hey you will
[54:25] be there
[54:27] son of man ministry you will be here at
[54:29] that church
[54:30] because the son of man ministry will
[54:32] identify
[54:34] the capstone ministry of himself amen
[54:48] [Music]
[54:51] pastor ronnie was ministering here just
[54:53] saying a few words i said lord
[54:54] use him but i see now suddenly he
[54:59] gave the servant over to me but anyway
[55:01] i'll catch him sometimes
[55:02] praise the lord amen okay first of all
[55:06] we must understand
[55:07] amen that brother branham
[55:12] uh is speaking about the six dreams
[55:16] plus a vision that transpired
[55:20] in his life and in his ministry man
[55:23] that's right
[55:25] so there are many people that will
[55:28] deviate from this spell
[55:33] presuming what it is
[55:36] this way or what it is that way amen but
[55:39] we need to catch the revelation
[55:41] amen and catching that revelation
[55:45] it will centralize logically
[55:49] our thought of direction through the
[55:52] world
[55:54] brother branham taught us amen
[55:57] there is scripture right requires
[56:02] a revelation a scripture
[56:06] requires a revelation anybody can get a
[56:10] torch
[56:11] and say this and say that and presume
[56:14] wrenching without authority but friends
[56:17] this is a serious business amen we're
[56:20] going to eternity amen
[56:22] i don't want one word that you've
[56:24] misconstrued then
[56:26] i don't want one line of thought that's
[56:28] going to be saying here
[56:29] there on the other i want to be true to
[56:31] the word amen
[56:33] and the only way that i could be true to
[56:35] the word lie that if you could
[56:37] show me the path of righteousness to act
[56:40] the way that i could act as a believer
[56:43] and do
[56:44] the things that i could do that would
[56:46] surpass
[56:47] my thoughts of nature into a realm
[56:51] of spiritual advancement that i will be
[56:54] adopted son
[56:55] and a daughter of god so therefore now
[56:59] over the years william brennan
[57:03] had learned obedience through the things
[57:06] which he suffered every minister will
[57:09] suffer
[57:10] you will suffer i will suffer
[57:13] amen he had learned to wait
[57:16] on a clear-cut decision
[57:20] from the lord and once he knew it
[57:24] he had learned to act on that decision
[57:29] too many times we want to act on
[57:32] decisions
[57:34] the decisions that we act on
[57:37] is not the way that it should be acted
[57:40] on understanding
[57:45] misunderstanding you say amen
[57:48] amen so it was
[57:53] with this with his decision to move
[57:57] westward he waited
[58:00] until it was god's time amen
[58:05] i want to tell you something we come to
[58:08] church
[58:09] to build our spiritual life yes amen
[58:13] we eat the word we want to act the word
[58:18] we want to manifest the word but it is a
[58:21] progression of time
[58:24] you see like a child when it's born
[58:28] you cannot take meat or whatever and
[58:29] give the child
[58:31] there are certain nutrients that the
[58:33] child
[58:34] must have to develop him
[58:37] or herself into what you are today
[58:41] so we take good parents the father and
[58:45] the mother
[58:46] to bring up the child according to the
[58:48] way of the lord amen
[58:50] that really goes oh it won't depart from
[58:52] him amen
[58:53] so naturally you take care of them
[58:57] and provide for them and give them
[58:59] everything
[59:00] as a parent that they should continue
[59:04] the work for the lord
[59:08] spiritually speaking we have a five-fold
[59:11] ministry
[59:12] and the five-fold ministry not only is
[59:15] to
[59:16] the locality of the church but a
[59:18] universal
[59:19] amen and and the revelation
[59:23] of that fifo ministry will be the same
[59:26] revelation that william brennan had
[59:29] amen it can never change amen
[59:32] i am the lord thy god and i change not
[59:35] amen
[59:36] can you see my friends so he had always
[59:39] known
[59:40] that someday he would live in the west
[59:43] as a teenager he had a vision
[59:46] of a cross in the sky
[59:51] with the glory from the cross streaming
[59:54] down
[59:54] upon him okay
[59:59] and in this vision he was standing
[1:00:02] somewhere out
[1:00:03] in the west those are the things that we
[1:00:06] we need to
[1:00:07] to search and find out like you must
[1:00:10] realize
[1:00:11] in uh uh the book of matthew
[1:00:14] uh the three megas where is he that is
[1:00:18] born
[1:00:18] king of the jews we have come from the
[1:00:21] east
[1:00:22] and now we're going to west to see where
[1:00:24] he was being born
[1:00:26] everything ties from the east to the
[1:00:29] west amen
[1:00:30] can you say amen amen praise the lord
[1:00:34] since his early teen years he had always
[1:00:37] had
[1:00:38] that yearning in his spirit to go west
[1:00:41] this yearning wasn't just for the west
[1:00:45] it wasn't just for the west in general
[1:00:48] but rather he felt he was being pulled
[1:00:51] towards a definite part of the west
[1:00:56] for him arizona was the place
[1:01:00] and the poem which he had written as a
[1:01:02] young boy
[1:01:03] of 16 years old was strangely
[1:01:07] prophetic indicating exactly
[1:01:11] where brother branham will live in
[1:01:14] arizona
[1:01:15] okay now he says here brother branham
[1:01:19] begins by reading the text of revelation
[1:01:22] 10
[1:01:23] 1 to 7. how are we going to find out
[1:01:29] is this the sign of the answer amen
[1:01:33] is this the sign of the end your pastor
[1:01:38] is well read
[1:01:43] he picks up what's happening in the
[1:01:44] world
[1:01:46] what's going on and we know revelation
[1:01:50] 10 7 time shall be no longer
[1:01:53] thanks for being no longer all these
[1:01:55] events that are being made
[1:01:57] clear by prophecy amen
[1:02:01] so we need to pick these things up by
[1:02:04] spiritual antenna that has been
[1:02:08] encrypted before the foundation of the
[1:02:10] world
[1:02:11] that nothing can blot out these things
[1:02:13] from us amen
[1:02:14] because we have something that will take
[1:02:18] us
[1:02:18] and that way there is something that
[1:02:20] we're going to stand true to
[1:02:22] and that is the word of the lord amen
[1:02:26] okay is this a sign of the answer
[1:02:30] and it goes on right up to revelation 10
[1:02:34] 1-7 why did he say that
[1:02:38] let's go further he says and my text if
[1:02:42] i should call it that tonight
[1:02:44] is this is this the sign of the answer
[1:02:46] ants
[1:02:48] amen we all know that we are living in a
[1:02:50] glorious
[1:02:51] time for the church
[1:02:54] but a horrible time for the unbeliever
[1:02:59] okay and we are living in one of the
[1:03:02] most
[1:03:02] dangerous times of all that
[1:03:06] ever was since the world began
[1:03:09] amen no prophet
[1:03:13] no apostle never in no time
[1:03:16] ever ever lived in such a time as we
[1:03:20] are now america this is
[1:03:23] the end amen you know if you realize
[1:03:25] that
[1:03:26] the statement there the blind makes
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:42] you want to get something you want to
[1:03:44] feed on something lord
[1:03:46] i need something lord that i that i need
[1:03:48] to to
[1:03:49] to know how how i'm developing my
[1:03:51] spiritual
[1:03:53] deeds to the spiritual body in the
[1:03:55] spirit the pastor preached
[1:03:56] the message of the spirit and and all
[1:03:59] these kind of things how
[1:04:00] brother everything is just coincided
[1:04:03] it's getting together
[1:04:05] lift up your redemption amen
[1:04:08] amen praise the lord
[1:04:12] it is written in the skies it's written
[1:04:14] over the face of the earth
[1:04:16] it's written in every newspaper this is
[1:04:19] the end amen if you can read
[1:04:23] the handwriting the prophet lived in the
[1:04:26] time
[1:04:27] when the handwriting was on the wall for
[1:04:30] a nation
[1:04:32] but we are living when the hand writing
[1:04:35] is on the wall for a time
[1:04:39] we know that time blends into eternity
[1:04:42] we know that we bypass our theophany and
[1:04:45] came into this
[1:04:46] world now through this world that we are
[1:04:49] living in
[1:04:50] there's something that is taking place
[1:04:51] inside of us
[1:04:54] you may not understand god understands
[1:04:57] and in its season
[1:04:58] he will let you know that you are a gene
[1:05:00] seed of god amen
[1:05:02] if you are a gene seed of god then you
[1:05:05] are planted
[1:05:06] right you are watched right you are fed
[1:05:09] right you will grow right and you will
[1:05:12] be
[1:05:12] all right amen amen
[1:05:17] so we must search the scriptures to find
[1:05:20] the hour
[1:05:21] that we are living amen yes always
[1:05:24] a true prophet of god will go to the
[1:05:26] scriptures
[1:05:27] therefore is absolute that it's going to
[1:05:30] be the way
[1:05:32] in the old testament when the prophets
[1:05:34] said anything
[1:05:35] they're always somewhere was a prophet
[1:05:38] with a word
[1:05:39] or stayed with the word amen can you say
[1:05:42] amen amen
[1:05:44] so there was a blessed plague of alan
[1:05:45] there the human common
[1:05:47] and all those kind of things that were
[1:05:49] there when something was true
[1:05:51] it will flash you know it is right
[1:05:54] i'm in the right track i'm moving but if
[1:05:58] it's
[1:05:58] it's not lighting up something is
[1:06:01] something is wrong and don't want to do
[1:06:04] this
[1:06:05] anymore i don't want to do it lord i
[1:06:07] want to act right
[1:06:08] do right and do the things that you for
[1:06:11] they need to do
[1:06:12] can you say amen amen look at david
[1:06:17] david took another man's wife
[1:06:20] he instructed that army got to take him
[1:06:22] and put him in the front deck
[1:06:24] and kill him but yet god loved him and
[1:06:26] chosen
[1:06:28] look at saul what he did look at all
[1:06:32] those people in the
[1:06:33] bible look at ray of the holidays yes
[1:06:35] look at the woman at the well
[1:06:37] yes look at the woman that they ran and
[1:06:39] came through and just said to the
[1:06:41] uh to jesus this woman was caught in
[1:06:43] adultery
[1:06:44] this death
[1:06:58] so we all come through different walks
[1:07:00] of life through simon
[1:07:02] and trespasses and once the
[1:07:05] uh word of the lord stuck the gene soul
[1:07:08] inside of us
[1:07:10] we are a new creature in a new creation
[1:07:13] in a new environment in the new message
[1:07:16] in a new directive way of thought
[1:07:18] that we will be a son and a daughter of
[1:07:20] god
[1:07:21] don't look to the past and look for your
[1:07:23] future amen
[1:07:24] that's your destiny
[1:07:28] he watched god for visions and if his
[1:07:31] visions was contrary to the word
[1:07:34] then his vision was wrong i was thinking
[1:07:37] about the yura
[1:07:39] that's god's way of getting his word to
[1:07:41] his people
[1:07:42] now i'm going to read a quote for you
[1:07:45] the bride
[1:07:47] church will come to his headstone

[1:08:08] okay 171 i said in paragraph two
[1:08:13] yes what i am trying to say
[1:08:16] to you the law of reproduction
[1:08:21] is that each species brings forth
[1:08:25] after its own time amen
[1:08:29] even according to genesis 1
[1:08:33] verses 11. amen amen now why is he
[1:08:37] bringing this
[1:08:39] into catching our
[1:08:43] attention for what he wants to say
[1:08:46] this morning let's go further and god
[1:08:49] said
[1:08:50] let the earth bring forth grass and the
[1:08:53] herb healing seed
[1:08:55] and the fruit tree hearing fruit after
[1:08:57] his kind
[1:08:58] whose seed is in itself amen upon the
[1:09:01] earth
[1:09:02] and it was so whatever life
[1:09:05] was in the sea came fought into a plant
[1:09:09] and danced into fruit amen the very same
[1:09:13] law
[1:09:13] applies to the church
[1:09:18] paul said i have planted amen upon us
[1:09:22] as water but it is god that giveth the
[1:09:25] increase
[1:09:27] hallelujah so it is god that has given
[1:09:30] the increase
[1:09:31] to the son of man ministry that's here
[1:09:33] and to the bright universal
[1:09:35] throughout the entire world whatever
[1:09:39] seed started in the church will come
[1:09:42] forth
[1:09:43] and be like the original seed
[1:09:46] because it is the same seed
[1:09:50] amen
[1:09:53] in these last days the true bright
[1:09:56] church
[1:09:57] christ's seed will come to the headstone
[1:10:02] and she will be the super church as
[1:10:05] super race
[1:10:06] as she needs him amen amen
[1:10:09] they in the bride will be so much
[1:10:13] like him that they will even
[1:10:16] be in his very image
[1:10:20] amen this is in order
[1:10:23] to be united with him amen absolutely
[1:10:27] they will be one they will be the very
[1:10:31] manifestation
[1:10:33] of the word of the living god amen
[1:10:38] denominations cannot produce this
[1:10:41] amen long seed amen

[1:10:49] a group and then they come and you know
[1:10:52] what
[1:10:52] happens come go come and go and whatever
[1:10:55] it is they just can't take it because
[1:10:56] why
[1:10:58] the nutrients that's given from the help
[1:11:00] disk of god
[1:11:02] doesn't warrant the state because they
[1:11:04] they they're looking at what they want
[1:11:06] to satisfy the ego and they the position
[1:11:10] and then they're gone but the true bride
[1:11:11] will stay

[1:11:15] i mean never be discouraged
[1:11:17] amen what a friend we have in jesus amen
[1:11:20] amen praise the lord hallelujah they
[1:11:22] will produce the creeds

[1:11:38] morning
[1:11:39] with a capstone revelation of himself
[1:11:43] amen our thoughts now are projected
[1:11:47] by why brother branham was bringing
[1:11:50] these things out
[1:11:51] for our admonition to see
[1:11:54] whatever transpired day will be the very
[1:11:58] same thing will be transpiring

[1:13:07] that are not staying true to what
[1:13:09] brother branham
[1:13:11] has brought for us amen are you happy
[1:13:15] amen just to show you how god deals with
[1:13:18] his people
[1:13:19] knowing what was going to happen brother
[1:13:22] jackson dreamed
[1:13:23] the dream in february of 1961.
[1:13:27] he couldn't get away from it and i was
[1:13:30] leaving
[1:13:31] and i was leaving his church
[1:13:35] amen and he just couldn't stand it
[1:13:39] while the prophet is leaving the church
[1:13:41] and he come to me
[1:13:42] and he said something is on my heart i
[1:13:45] must tell you
[1:13:46] brother bran and he said
[1:13:50] i dreamed a dream you know
[1:13:54] i just said stop and i listened
[1:13:57] and watched right and he said
[1:14:01] i dreamed that there was a great big
[1:14:03] hill
[1:14:05] like out in a field where blue grass or
[1:14:08] something was
[1:14:10] and said up on top of this hill
[1:14:13] where the water had washed away the soil
[1:14:16] there was a top rock up on top of the
[1:14:19] hill
[1:14:20] like the top of the mountain
[1:14:24] right it was a rock no glass
[1:14:28] and where the water had washed down
[1:14:31] it had cut some kind of readings on this
[1:14:35] stone
[1:14:37] streaming nuts this is the thing that i
[1:14:40] had
[1:14:40] and the water the washing of the water
[1:14:42] by the wood
[1:14:44] washed and there were writings on that
[1:14:47] stone
[1:14:48] okay and where the water had washed down
[1:14:51] it had cut some kind of readings
[1:14:53] on these stones and you were standing
[1:14:57] he saith they're
[1:15:00] interpreting this reading on these
[1:15:02] stones
[1:15:03] and said the brethren from georgia and
[1:15:06] from all around
[1:15:07] we are all standing together listening
[1:15:10] to you
[1:15:11] interpret that mysterious writing on
[1:15:14] those stones
[1:15:15] that mountain he said
[1:15:18] then you picked up something like from
[1:15:20] the air but before we go there we spoke
[1:15:24] about
[1:15:25] the writing i want you to catch
[1:15:29] an attention to revelation chapter 5
[1:15:33] when he said you know the seals were
[1:15:34] written within
[1:15:36] and on the side sealed with seven seals
[1:15:39] just a thought that you have on the back
[1:15:41] of your mind
[1:15:42] as you are now listening and having your
[1:15:45] attention
[1:15:46] to what the property is saying okay
[1:15:50] now i will read you something here from
[1:15:52] the church age
[1:15:54] just to appease your spiritual hunger
[1:15:59] okay are you with me amen
[1:16:03] praise god i'm happy for this message
[1:16:10] no matter what every process said i was
[1:16:12] in my deathbed
[1:16:14] but i will never leave this message
[1:16:20] i will just go with the lord just
[1:16:23] past you and i'll say lord snake away
[1:16:26] from me
[1:16:28] okay now revelation of himself
[1:16:46] you're in the right place you're in the
[1:16:48] right ministry
[1:16:50] you have a god-given pastor respect
[1:16:53] him appreciate him amen before he sleeps
[1:16:56] he has to take each one of you
[1:16:58] and present him to god amen for your
[1:17:00] soul
[1:17:01] day morning evening take them work safe
[1:17:04] bring them back lord
[1:17:05] supply to every need and do all those
[1:17:07] kind of things
[1:17:08] huh it's it's an easy job pass the job i
[1:17:11] like to be sitting there
[1:17:12] somebody passing yeah amen thanks a lot
[1:17:15] yes let's go
[1:17:17] he says here now you know brother
[1:17:18] branham made a remarkable statement
[1:17:20] he said that the god and revelation is
[1:17:23] above every other revelation
[1:17:25] amen we need to understand that that the
[1:17:28] godhead revelation
[1:17:30] is above all other revelation if you
[1:17:33] don't have that revelation which is your
[1:17:34] foundation
[1:17:36] you will never grow up into realizing
[1:17:39] and understanding the capstone ministry
[1:17:43] why did brother branham come he came
[1:17:45] because of her purpose
[1:17:47] and what was the purpose to gather the
[1:17:49] bride together
[1:17:50] to make them ready to get into the
[1:17:52] rapture time shall be no longer
[1:17:54] amen we need to expedient our time
[1:17:58] in relationship to the word of god to
[1:18:01] act
[1:18:01] and to grow spiritually in the
[1:18:03] administration of christ
[1:18:04] come and say amen amen yes
[1:18:08] yoga of the old testament the god of the
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:12] sorry i'll just go to you first just say
[1:18:16] the amen jesus is the amen of god
[1:18:22] jesus is the so be it of god
[1:18:26] amen stands for finality
[1:18:30] amen stands for finality
[1:18:34] amen so either what other things that
[1:18:35] you want to add up here
[1:18:37] to add finality amen
[1:18:41] it stands for approval it stands
[1:18:45] for prevailing promise
[1:18:49] it stands for unchanging promise
[1:18:52] it stands for the seal of god
[1:18:58] grieve not the holy spirit of god where
[1:19:01] whereby you are sealed
[1:19:03] unto the day of redemption
[1:19:06] so the seventh seal shields you
[1:19:09] into the day of redemption
[1:19:12] the seventh seal is a progression
[1:19:16] of revelation to the end when we are
[1:19:19] caught up
[1:19:20] for it to be concluded
[1:19:26] i want you to watch this carefully
[1:19:29] now and see something really sweet
[1:19:32] and beautiful i said this
[1:19:36] is his end time revelation
[1:19:39] of himself
[1:19:43] you're just imparting just a little
[1:19:48] don't you know that you are gods
[1:19:52] are you staying so quiet amen you're god
[1:19:54] you're walking you're a living bible
[1:19:56] you're walking
[1:19:57] you're god so what's so
[1:20:01] bad about thinking that you are gods and
[1:20:03] you are god's people
[1:20:05] you understand god's way of
[1:20:06] understanding and you're moving on
[1:20:09] why do you think that you came here you
[1:20:10] think the devil brought you here
[1:20:12] the devil didn't bring you maybe you
[1:20:14] just had little petrol now we can make
[1:20:16] it then
[1:20:16] and we go don't worry about cooking the
[1:20:20] food early and whatever no no let's
[1:20:21] listen to the word of god amen
[1:20:23] amen praise the lord
[1:20:26] the new the new testament
[1:20:30] does not reveal another god
[1:20:35] yes doesn't reveal him another god amen
[1:20:40] we're traveling in the train and he says
[1:20:42] no i'm a catholic
[1:20:45] lord how must i approach this person
[1:20:48] here
[1:20:48] i mean a message of the hour i didn't
[1:20:51] know what to do i gave him a book on
[1:20:52] hebrews i think it was
[1:20:54] okay and that changed the whole episode
[1:20:56] in his life and there he is here
[1:20:58] sitting here today under the tutorship
[1:21:01] of the son of man ministry
[1:21:02] praise the lord
[1:21:06] the new testament does not reveal
[1:21:08] another god it is a
[1:21:10] further revelation of the one and the
[1:21:13] same
[1:21:13] god christ did not come down
[1:21:17] to make himself known he did not come
[1:21:21] to reveal the son he came to reveal and
[1:21:24] make known the father
[1:21:26] yes he never talked about two gods
[1:21:30] he talked about one god and now
[1:21:34] in this last age we have come back to
[1:21:37] the capstone revelation
[1:21:39] the most important revelation of the
[1:21:42] godhead
[1:21:43] in the whole bible amen but in the days
[1:21:46] of the voice
[1:21:47] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:21:50] to sum the mystery of god will be
[1:21:53] completed
[1:21:54] as he has declared to his servants the
[1:21:57] promise
[1:21:58] so we had a prophet in the same time
[1:22:00] that declared
[1:22:02] the mystery of god and we cut the
[1:22:04] mystery of who god was
[1:22:06] god is and god will be we know about the
[1:22:09] unmarked
[1:22:10] uh transcript of the word
[1:22:13] we know changing the mask we already
[1:22:16] changed our mask
[1:22:18] from natural to spiritual say amen amen
[1:22:21] praise the lord so therefore the seven
[1:22:23] thunders
[1:22:23] of revelation 10 1-7 came to pick you up
[1:22:27] in a steep sincerity of understanding
[1:22:31] and knowing who you are in your
[1:22:33] relationship
[1:22:34] with god amen
[1:22:40] we have come back to the capstone
[1:22:43] revelation
[1:22:43] amen most important revelation
[1:22:47] of god in the whole bible amen that is
[1:22:50] jesus
[1:22:50] is god amen he and the father are one
[1:22:55] there is one god and his name
[1:22:59] is god amen
[1:23:06] so therefore we got to be identified and
[1:23:08] then where we go with church we go
[1:23:11] which minister we come in contact yeah
[1:23:15] so you could be the devil says hey you
[1:23:16] know yeah
[1:23:23] lord please lord go down on your knees
[1:23:26] like john wesley
[1:23:27] he had one spot there in the cupboard
[1:23:29] for years and years he played the carpet
[1:23:30] got one
[1:23:32] why he was he had the fervent desire to
[1:23:35] please god
[1:23:36] right fervent desire to please god try
[1:23:39] to reach out in the spirit and the
[1:23:41] passion to know his word
[1:23:43] and by that way of thought
[1:23:46] you could see where john wesley was you
[1:23:49] could see where brother branham was you
[1:23:51] could see
[1:23:51] where we the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:56] he is the god of the a man amen
[1:24:00] praise the lord let us go further
[1:24:03] okay so now the water came in
[1:24:08] watched the rock and there were readings
[1:24:11] on the stomach
[1:24:13] they were reading on the stone yeah
[1:24:16] catch this
[1:24:17] who saw julia jackson's dream amen
[1:24:20] reading
[1:24:23] on the rock john and the isle of patmos
[1:24:27] he was there seal it up john
[1:24:31] you don't like it junior jackson you
[1:24:33] don't like it you don't know
[1:24:35] you don't know don't capitalize on your
[1:24:38] own thoughts
[1:24:39] don't capitalize on your own way watch
[1:24:42] and pray god will reveal it to you
[1:24:46] what these things went to be
[1:24:49] god sends one prophet yes for the age
[1:24:53] yes and this prophet will have a
[1:24:55] prophetic
[1:24:56] utterance yes it will be the voice of
[1:24:59] god
[1:25:00] another people amen
[1:25:03] amen so therefore we need to adjust
[1:25:06] ourselves in the line of thought in the
[1:25:09] perseverance
[1:25:10] of our prayer amen and the understanding
[1:25:14] of the scriptures to earmark ourselves
[1:25:18] in a spiritual growth that will be
[1:25:21] appeasing to ourselves and to god yes
[1:25:24] amen
[1:25:27] okay here he goes now he said then you
[1:25:30] picked up something like
[1:25:32] from the air something like a wrecking
[1:25:34] bar
[1:25:35] or a crowbar how you done it i don't
[1:25:41] know
[1:25:42] and said you struck the top of the
[1:25:44] mountain

[1:25:49] on it off it was in the shape of a
[1:25:52] pyramid

[1:26:19] open the top and it was in the shape
[1:26:23] of a pyramid
[1:26:26] in the light of this dream so that there
[1:26:30] must be something you know now
[1:26:31] it's written on the outside and supposed
[1:26:34] to be in the inside
[1:26:36] what this is all about hallelujah amen
[1:26:39] this is only this is for the bride

[1:26:56] now that was months and months and
[1:26:59] months

[1:27:03] of the perfect man amen right was
[1:27:05] preached and said

[1:27:50] right now he said further we have
[1:27:53] upon this rock you will build my church
[1:27:56] amen amen
[1:27:57] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:28:00] against it
[1:28:00] but we will prevail against it
[1:28:04] can you say amen so it is a revelation
[1:28:07] pertaining
[1:28:08] to this rock which is an uh which is
[1:28:11] that great revelation
[1:28:12] that we need to understand and let's go
[1:28:15] on this is only the first dream
[1:28:17] best mission let's go
[1:28:22] and he says and in brother jackson's
[1:28:24] dream i said to the brethren
[1:28:25] look upon light has never come
[1:28:29] i said to the brethren to that
[1:28:32] brother brothers they were following
[1:28:35] brother branham
[1:28:37] amen watch here
[1:28:40] okay i said to the brethren
[1:28:43] look upon this light has never come upon
[1:28:46] its before
[1:28:47] and when all of them got up
[1:28:51] and i told them to watch that
[1:28:54] and all of them came up to look in
[1:28:59] while they were looking next to me i
[1:29:02] slipped
[1:29:03] over to one side and start going
[1:29:07] towards the west towards the setting
[1:29:10] of the sun coming up here
[1:29:14] going down a hill coming up a hill
[1:29:18] going down a hill getting smaller and
[1:29:21] smaller
[1:29:22] and went all the way out of sight
[1:29:26] if you are reading the message correctly
[1:29:29] and understanding the spirit inception
[1:29:33] of the world
[1:29:36] brings about brother branham going down
[1:29:42] and he's vanishing you know why because
[1:29:45] he was caught up in the constellation
[1:29:50] there was something between god and man
[1:29:53] to be
[1:29:54] brought out to the private age
[1:29:57] hallelujah so something happened then
[1:30:01] now
[1:30:01] let's go
[1:30:07] okay you say he speaks about that
[1:30:09] naturally down under there
[1:30:10] in the ages that formation was the light
[1:30:13] had never come upon that stone
[1:30:16] nobody had a revolution
[1:30:21] of that stone
[1:30:24] right brother branham was the light
[1:30:29] of this age come on now
[1:30:32] we are not doing laudation that we are
[1:30:34] out we are moving
[1:30:37] the cemetery message is moving like a
[1:30:39] magnet
[1:30:40] it's moving here it's moving there it's
[1:30:42] moving about everywhere
[1:30:44] and then praise the lord so he's the
[1:30:46] light of this age
[1:30:48] so if he's the light of this age then he
[1:30:50] must interpret
[1:30:52] what that capture
[1:30:56] of himself is
[1:31:00] okay it looked out of the you looked at
[1:31:03] the corner of the eye and watched
[1:31:05] and i slipped over and he went away out
[1:31:06] of the side and now when i did that he
[1:31:09] said
[1:31:11] then the brethren turned around after a
[1:31:14] while and said
[1:31:15] did he vanish where did he go
[1:31:20] didn't brother branham said catch your
[1:31:22] attention to that
[1:31:24] amen don't leave why
[1:31:27] because they were distracted amen
[1:31:31] they were distracted amen did you know
[1:31:33] what was going on
[1:31:34] okay and said that some took out
[1:31:38] that way some took one way
[1:31:42] some another but a very few
[1:31:45] state and looked on to what i had told
[1:31:48] you same thing is going into this church
[1:31:51] here
[1:31:52] this morning and bride universal amen
[1:31:56] the second dream not long ago police
[1:32:00] said
[1:32:01] brother billy is all torn up he had a
[1:32:04] strange dream
[1:32:06] i went to brother beer down at his house
[1:32:09] house one night when i was waiting on
[1:32:12] some calls
[1:32:13] and he said brother branham i had a
[1:32:16] strange
[1:32:17] dream okay he said i dreamed that i was
[1:32:21] going down a stream of water towards the
[1:32:23] west
[1:32:24] and there was a road on the left side
[1:32:26] and i was on the left side
[1:32:28] going westward on the road seemingly
[1:32:31] like hunting for cattle
[1:32:36] and on the right side i happen to notice
[1:32:39] after i got down there
[1:32:41] there you were and you were rounding up
[1:32:44] a big
[1:32:44] bunch of cattle and there was plenty of
[1:32:47] feed over there
[1:32:49] then you got those kettle and started
[1:32:52] them back
[1:32:53] up the river they now
[1:32:56] try and get his attention as to what his
[1:32:59] dream
[1:33:00] was all about amen no more than he said
[1:33:04] he spoke the dream i saw it the notice
[1:33:07] he said
[1:33:08] he got a little leery around about me
[1:33:11] so he went back to look and said that i
[1:33:14] was coming to a
[1:33:15] solid mountain
[1:33:19] what's that junior jackson mountain
[1:33:22] solid mountain
[1:33:24] and all at once i vanished
[1:33:29] and he wondered what was wrong he ran
[1:33:31] down
[1:33:32] then he had a little stream on this side
[1:33:34] that off to the left
[1:33:36] and he noticed over on my side was a
[1:33:39] terrific
[1:33:39] fall terrific fall
[1:33:43] and then he thought i could have got it
[1:33:46] got in those falls and perished
[1:33:50] then he noticed then and he said he
[1:33:52] looked around
[1:33:53] and he's seeing the effects of those
[1:33:56] falls
[1:33:57] that went down this way and was causing
[1:34:01] an artesian well and then to spread out
[1:34:06] but the water wasn't going back in the
[1:34:08] ground wow
[1:34:10] you looked across the little branch a
[1:34:13] little stream
[1:34:14] and you seen some little animals with
[1:34:17] round ears
[1:34:18] and said i believe i will take one
[1:34:22] and he crossed then in the dream he got
[1:34:25] to thinking about me
[1:34:28] he got up on a little gnaw to look over
[1:34:30] and see if there was a little bitty
[1:34:32] narrow ledge you know that it could have
[1:34:35] walked
[1:34:36] around but said there wasn't nothing
[1:34:39] and he got worried about that got
[1:34:41] worried about and said
[1:34:43] wonder what happened to brother brennan
[1:34:45] she vanished
[1:34:46] spoke about that storm right
[1:34:50] i was standing up on top of a mountain
[1:34:55] right and told brother biller an
[1:34:57] interpretation of a dream
[1:35:00] that i've given him not long ago and
[1:35:02] told him to wait on the lord
[1:35:04] that someday i would meet him on an
[1:35:06] island
[1:35:07] and there he was fulfillment of the
[1:35:10] dream
[1:35:13] now these are all these are things
[1:35:16] that has been said from the help desk of
[1:35:18] course to a piece for you to understand
[1:35:22] for you to know the time and the season
[1:35:25] in which we are living in right i say
[1:35:28] okay it's good to have some this meeting
[1:35:31] or that meaning or whatever
[1:35:32] but we need to have some form of solid
[1:35:35] foundation
[1:35:37] and if we have that solid foundation
[1:35:41] we will stand together in the
[1:35:43] unification of his spirit
[1:35:45] we won't have wandering spirits
[1:35:48] wandering
[1:35:49] thoughts whatever we will be one
[1:35:52] as the father and the son
[1:35:55] is one we are one with the father
[1:35:59] we are one with the spirit we are one
[1:36:02] with the son
[1:36:04] there's nothing that can pull against it
[1:36:06] it only takes
[1:36:08] the spirit of satan to cover
[1:36:11] and disrupt but it cannot distract you
[1:36:14] because you're a child of god it will
[1:36:16] only disrupt
[1:36:17] them who are not solid and grounded
[1:36:21] in the word of the lord amen
[1:36:28] praise the lord are you happy amen let's
[1:36:31] go to the third dream
[1:36:33] so now then immediately after that
[1:36:35] brother roy robinson
[1:36:38] he had a dream and he dreamed that we
[1:36:42] were
[1:36:42] rounding cattle and that in the third
[1:36:45] one
[1:36:46] and that is the third one running up
[1:36:49] chapel and there was grass very deep
[1:36:51] plenty of food
[1:36:52] all of us brethren were together
[1:36:55] they were all together they were not
[1:36:57] separated
[1:36:59] we have a meeting you're all together
[1:37:01] you're not separated
[1:37:03] can you say amen amen when you have
[1:37:05] fellowship all together
[1:37:06] amen not separated
[1:37:10] praise the lord because while you have
[1:37:12] an understanding of the spirit
[1:37:14] amen and what is the understanding of
[1:37:16] the spirit you want to learn more
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:23] amen all of us we have never reached a
[1:37:26] perfection
[1:37:28] but if you think that a man knows
[1:37:30] everything
[1:37:31] he knows nothing so therefore you need
[1:37:33] to go down on your knees
[1:37:34] you get something to understand
[1:37:46] please
[1:37:48] the fourth green third dream
[1:37:52] and he spoke about the cross and the
[1:37:53] brethren were together and we come to a
[1:37:55] place for dinner
[1:37:57] and where the fred shot man raised up
[1:37:59] and said elijah
[1:38:01] the great prophet will speak from here
[1:38:04] today
[1:38:04] at noon and then
[1:38:08] when we all had dinner
[1:38:11] everybody went away
[1:38:15] and wondered and he wondered why they
[1:38:17] didn't wait to hear
[1:38:19] it being spoke
[1:38:22] the reason why they went away why
[1:38:28] now see how that exactly curves
[1:38:31] with brother jackson
[1:38:35] how does people walk away they never had
[1:38:37] their eyes focused on
[1:38:39] brother see all these people had the
[1:38:41] dinner they walked away
[1:38:42] they will focus on brother branham and
[1:38:45] the ministry
[1:38:46] today all the people will walk away
[1:38:48] because they haven't got themselves
[1:38:50] focused
[1:38:51] on the message of the hour with your
[1:38:52] brandon's message
[1:38:54] they know everything but you're doing
[1:38:57] nothing
[1:38:59] praise the lord okay then he says didn't
[1:39:02] hear
[1:39:03] right and when we all had dinner
[1:39:05] everybody went away
[1:39:06] and he wondered why they didn't wait to
[1:39:08] hear it
[1:39:10] being spoke now see how that exactly
[1:39:12] occurred to brother jackson
[1:39:14] see that it's exactly what brother billy
[1:39:17] said
[1:39:17] no one waited to find
[1:39:20] out what was
[1:39:24] in those standards no one knew
[1:39:28] but we need to know
[1:39:31] it will take a profit to make us
[1:39:35] understand and make known what the
[1:39:37] thunderstorm
[1:39:39] these will divinely turn our hearts
[1:39:44] so the changing of the hearts will be
[1:39:47] the revelation of the tenderness
[1:39:49] and you will no longer be the same if i
[1:39:52] be lifted up
[1:39:54] i will draw all neighbors amen
[1:39:58] wonderful i love that
[1:40:03] nobody wants to find out only the bride
[1:40:05] will find out
[1:40:07] therefore we are
[1:40:12] amen we are here
[1:40:15] today to be
[1:40:18] enlightened by the word amen amen
[1:40:23] so you never come here just to say well
[1:40:24] hey i'm sitting and agreeing now you are
[1:40:26] a
[1:40:27] foreordained member
[1:40:30] amen four ordained brave member
[1:40:34] remember that now
[1:40:37] he goes on and this is what he says
[1:40:39] notice in the 15th
[1:40:41] notice immediately after that sister
[1:40:43] colin
[1:40:44] collins dreamed a dream of being here at
[1:40:48] of being here at the church and there
[1:40:51] was a wedding fixing to take place
[1:40:54] and when she did she saw the bridegroom
[1:40:56] come in
[1:40:57] perfect the bridegroom
[1:41:01] come in perfect catch the spiritual
[1:41:05] concept of what is being said here but
[1:41:07] the bride wasn't
[1:41:09] very perfect yet it was a bride
[1:41:13] we are not yet perfect
[1:41:17] but we are the bride so we
[1:41:20] are following the spiritual
[1:41:24] digestive order of the word
[1:41:28] to be fully nourished in the way
[1:41:31] that god allows it to be
[1:41:34] in the individual as he takes
[1:41:37] and retains the word to grow up
[1:41:41] into that which god has proposed
[1:41:46] can you say amen amen that's what
[1:41:48] different people do in different times
[1:41:50] some people catch it some people don't
[1:41:51] catch it later on this that and the
[1:41:53] other
[1:41:54] let's move on amen let's hold to god
[1:41:56] unchanging
[1:41:57] he's the only one that could make a way
[1:41:59] for us putting first
[1:42:00] put in number one more than your wife
[1:42:02] more than your husband more than your
[1:42:03] child more than anything else
[1:42:05] put god first and i want to see a person
[1:42:07] that put god's first
[1:42:08] as feelings in his life
[1:42:15] he goes and he says that and immediately
[1:42:17] after he said that
[1:42:19] uh but the bride wasn't very perfect
[1:42:22] here it was a bribe
[1:42:23] now that is the church and there was
[1:42:27] like a communion or a service
[1:42:30] going on there like a dinner being set
[1:42:35] and it kind of forgot next to her
[1:42:38] because what brother neville was serving
[1:42:40] at dinner
[1:42:41] in the church but she said it was the
[1:42:44] best
[1:42:44] food that she had ever
[1:42:48] seen brother branham spiritual food
[1:42:53] is the best we cannot take an
[1:42:56] understanding of anybody else
[1:42:57] yes we cannot take an understanding of
[1:42:59] what that brother said
[1:43:00] that pastor said this said and that said
[1:43:03] if anything
[1:43:04] has got to be said it's going to be
[1:43:06] revealed by the spirit
[1:43:07] confirmed by the word made manifest with
[1:43:09] the results it burst 100 upon 100
[1:43:12] and i want that nothing else
[1:43:17] she was so hungry but she thought maybe
[1:43:20] that in the dream
[1:43:21] that he shouldn't serve it she and
[1:43:24] brother willard was going to go
[1:43:25] up to the ranch house and eat when they
[1:43:28] did
[1:43:29] the light on the right hand side went
[1:43:31] out
[1:43:32] now you know what that is
[1:43:37] the food the bride isn't perfect
[1:43:42] but the bridegroom is perfect the bride
[1:43:45] is not perfect yet
[1:43:47] but the food that was being given was
[1:43:50] not literal food
[1:43:53] it is the spiritual food that you have
[1:43:55] been having
[1:43:56] all along
[1:44:00] let me stop here on the front dream just
[1:44:04] a moment you see when your pastor comes
[1:44:08] to the help desk of god and he ministers
[1:44:10] the word of god
[1:44:11] he's giving you food spiritual food
[1:44:15] and you take that food a digestive
[1:44:17] friends
[1:44:19] you don't know how he's going down and
[1:44:20] how he's praying and how god is
[1:44:22] revealing
[1:44:22] and i said to myself today you know i
[1:44:25] and then the rest of the days i said
[1:44:26] lord
[1:44:27] i'm looking at you the augmented head of
[1:44:28] christ and the seven angels that say on
[1:44:30] the photograph
[1:44:31] and i said lord no brother branham
[1:44:33] looked at him and he prayed
[1:44:34] lord there was no failure there was
[1:44:36] nothing else but not only you
[1:44:38] that was their father that made a
[1:44:41] provided way
[1:44:43] can you say amen so god is there god was
[1:44:46] making a way
[1:44:49] can you say amen amen praise the lord
[1:44:51] hallelujah
[1:44:52] so the spiritual food that comes from
[1:44:54] the help desk
[1:44:55] is from the scripture from the message
[1:44:57] of the hour not from year
[1:44:59] day and the other the rest of the
[1:45:01] ministries i certainly checked
[1:45:03] how they minister so well in this
[1:45:05] congregation to the congregants
[1:45:06] and to see that how they are captivated
[1:45:09] by the word of god
[1:45:11] and the anointed gift that has been
[1:45:12] working in them to provide
[1:45:14] spiritual food in due season amen praise
[1:45:17] the lord
[1:45:18] at this point brother branham forces to
[1:45:20] explain a vision
[1:45:22] that the lord had given him the previous
[1:45:24] year
[1:45:26] in the vision he was instructed to store
[1:45:30] in food he said and then the food in
[1:45:33] that little
[1:45:34] long building i returned to this little
[1:45:36] building
[1:45:37] and we made dozens of tapes of the
[1:45:39] pyramids and everything
[1:45:41] to show the people the hour that we are
[1:45:43] living in
[1:45:44] just for your clarity when he preached
[1:45:48] the stature of the perfect man
[1:45:50] they thought that the seven thunders are
[1:45:52] the virtues
[1:45:54] there was certain group those groups
[1:45:56] that went away
[1:45:57] didn't stay the program you're with me
[1:46:01] so they were moving in later on as they
[1:46:04] moved on
[1:46:05] then the revelation struck them now they
[1:46:08] come to an understanding
[1:46:09] of what it was amazing can you say amen
[1:46:13] praise the lord never give up just pray
[1:46:15] for them
[1:46:16] just pray for them don't say any bad
[1:46:17] things about it just pray for them pray
[1:46:19] for them lord
[1:46:20] give them revelation give them
[1:46:21] understanding we've come this
[1:46:23] far lord you can make your way for
[1:46:27] i returned that you spoke about the
[1:46:29] pyramids and everything to show the
[1:46:31] people
[1:46:31] the hour that we are living in now
[1:46:33] compare even
[1:46:35] that with the others the dreams this was
[1:46:37] a vision
[1:46:38] the food which is here this is the place
[1:46:42] that will dream right
[1:46:45] can you say amen praise the lord
[1:46:48] so everything that abraham said and done
[1:46:51] it was not something
[1:46:52] that was uh not far for us it was for
[1:46:56] the bible
[1:46:57] you see key words like you know he said
[1:47:00] you know like for example in revelation
[1:47:04] 19 uh like john didn't know what to do
[1:47:07] he didn't know what to say what to do
[1:47:09] and then he wanted to worship
[1:47:11] and then he went down on his feet to
[1:47:13] worship and death
[1:47:14] don't worship me worship god this is one
[1:47:16] of their fellow servants
[1:47:18] amen the brothers one of the prophets or
[1:47:20] whatever can you say amen
[1:47:22] so could you see the tendency of the
[1:47:25] scriptures
[1:47:26] could you see the revelation that has
[1:47:28] been bestowed
[1:47:29] and given to us in the end time that is
[1:47:32] why the other churches that don't
[1:47:34] believe the way that we believe

[1:49:36] i've got to tell it i've got to tell
[1:49:38] brother branham
[1:49:40] it is bothering me
[1:49:43] and god knows not one dream
[1:49:46] in between them just come one two three
[1:49:50] four
[1:49:50] five and six yeah everything was coming
[1:49:54] true
[1:49:58] said i had a dream a dream that i was
[1:50:01] going to have a meeting up there
[1:50:03] and somehow another there was a meeting
[1:50:05] here in a new church
[1:50:09] watch
[1:50:16] praise the lord this new church
[1:50:20] how it come out that he wondered why
[1:50:23] there wasn't cooperating
[1:50:24] between the two or something on that way
[1:50:27] there were other churches too
[1:50:29] there were no cooperation we can't
[1:50:31] cooperate with the denominations
[1:50:34] we can't take sides with a
[1:50:35] denominational pastor him the truth
[1:50:37] he wants you to praise the lord he
[1:50:39] doesn't want it go where you go
[1:50:41] do what you do be happy and gain we will
[1:50:45] stay
[1:50:45] with what the prophet tells us and we'll
[1:50:47] do all what he tells us to do say amen
[1:50:51] praise the lord amen speaks about the
[1:50:54] church right
[1:50:56] and said he was standing here and
[1:50:58] thought well i've been in here i will
[1:51:00] just wait and we'll attend the service
[1:51:03] and said a man come through the building
[1:51:05] with a brown suit on and a book
[1:51:09] i think he was writing and he told
[1:51:11] brother parnell said
[1:51:12] this is a closed meeting
[1:51:16] it is only for deacons and trustees
[1:51:19] well he kind of felt a little stepped
[1:51:22] on so he went out the door of the new
[1:51:26] church
[1:51:27] the church that had been elected
[1:51:30] or this one repaired fixed over
[1:51:34] and when he went outside it was snowing
[1:51:37] bad weather winter time and none of
[1:51:39] these people
[1:51:40] know nothing about this
[1:51:43] watch now and when he went
[1:51:47] out the door i was standing there
[1:51:51] looking at whisper and i said don't feel
[1:51:55] stepped
[1:51:55] on brother i will direct you
[1:51:59] what you should do and then brother
[1:52:02] parnell he said that i
[1:52:03] said to him brother stop
[1:52:06] and the first place you will ever come
[1:52:08] to will be separa
[1:52:12] which means hyphen
[1:52:22] don't stay there then go next
[1:52:25] and you'll find an old woman coming to a
[1:52:28] climate
[1:52:29] right and when you're undivided
[1:52:33] and then don't stop there go again
[1:52:36] you will find a real old woman
[1:52:40] don't stop out there
[1:52:43] and all the time i was talking
[1:52:47] we were walking through the snow and
[1:52:50] still
[1:52:51] in his dream i said go till you find
[1:52:55] my wife say
[1:52:58] till you find my wife and when you find
[1:53:02] my way
[1:53:03] stop there
[1:53:07] stop there and say he looked
[1:53:11] and we was out of the snow on the desert
[1:53:14] and i had vanished and he looked back
[1:53:17] and he saw his wife
[1:53:18] pumping water from a well and some
[1:53:21] minister
[1:53:22] pulling on her to pull her away from the
[1:53:24] pump
[1:53:25] she was watching him and he will come
[1:53:28] and watch
[1:53:29] the interpretation of the dream and
[1:53:31] that's
[1:53:32] very important here is the
[1:53:34] interpretation
[1:53:35] of your dream and i could have told you
[1:53:38] that night
[1:53:39] but i just turned away in so much
[1:53:43] that zipporah and the old woman
[1:53:46] and another real real old woman that's
[1:53:52] churches watch
[1:53:55] who is telling this interpretation as
[1:53:58] daniel told the interpretation to
[1:54:01] nebuchadnezzar now
[1:54:05] brother branham he's giving the
[1:54:07] interpretation
[1:54:08] of this dream to the brother and
[1:54:11] explaining
[1:54:12] now that these were churches
[1:54:15] there are many churches millions of
[1:54:17] churches there's only one church
[1:54:20] and the church
[1:54:24] is a mystical body amen he's a mystical
[1:54:28] body
[1:54:29] and the individual is baptized
[1:54:32] in spiritual revelation to get into that
[1:54:36] body
[1:54:37] to be called the church the called out
[1:54:39] one let's go further
[1:54:42] see i told him not to stop at them no
[1:54:45] matter how old they was
[1:54:46] they were organizations don't stop at
[1:54:49] them
[1:54:51] they have lived their time but when
[1:54:54] he comes to my wife which is
[1:54:58] my church that jesus christ has sent
[1:55:01] me to in this last day and here it is
[1:55:05] stopped there and i was gone
[1:55:13] a true sign that has been overlooked by
[1:55:15] others
[1:55:20] now we are failing to see who is william
[1:55:24] amen who is this man the prophet of
[1:55:30] malachi
[1:55:32] he come in a suit put his hat on
[1:55:35] when he stood on the helpdesk of god and
[1:55:37] the holy spirit the pull out of cloud
[1:55:39] fire was out there who was he he was the
[1:55:43] voice of god
[1:55:44] to this generation and the five-fold
[1:55:48] ministry
[1:55:49] the pastors and whatever they are the
[1:55:50] voice of god
[1:55:52] in the true sense of revelation amen
[1:55:55] but the same word but the same
[1:55:56] revelation that william branham had will
[1:55:59] come from the happiness of god
[1:56:00] to sustain you to appease your hunger
[1:56:03] come on say amen amen
[1:56:07] right so in other words that's jesus
[1:56:09] christ that sent me
[1:56:10] to this last day and there it is stopped
[1:56:13] there and i was gone
[1:56:14] whispered luke 17 30 revelation 10

[1:56:31] do this i don't want to do that
[1:56:33] i have my eternal life lord if i change
[1:56:35] i might go astray
[1:56:36] amen please lord help me
[1:56:47] [Music]
[1:56:52] let's go now comes
[1:56:55] the sixth grade
[1:56:58] then sister steffi came to my house
[1:57:02] for prayer
[1:57:05] before she went to the hospital for
[1:57:08] surgery
[1:57:10] that god would help her and bless her
[1:57:13] and he certainly did and she said
[1:57:16] i have a strange dream brother
[1:57:22] and she said i dreamed that i was out
[1:57:25] west
[1:57:26] and it is rolling country and when i
[1:57:29] looked standing upon a hill
[1:57:31] there was a real old man with a long
[1:57:34] white
[1:57:35] beard and what hair he had
[1:57:38] was grown down across his face and he
[1:57:42] had a white
[1:57:43] white wrap around something garment
[1:57:46] and said the wind was blowing
[1:57:50] and she said listen very carefully
[1:57:53] i kept drawing closer you were standing
[1:57:57] up
[1:57:57] on top of the mountain julia jackson
[1:58:01] mountain next mountain
[1:58:02] now mountain

[1:58:11] he was standing on top of a mountain
[1:58:14] watching
[1:58:14] eastward i wondered who this old man
[1:58:18] and she moved closer closer and when she
[1:58:22] got
[1:58:22] closer listen very carefully church
[1:58:26] she recognized who it was it was the
[1:58:29] immortal elijah the prophet
[1:58:32] standing up there watching the east
[1:58:36] listen very carefully now she said
[1:58:40] i must see him she had a knee
[1:58:44] and she ran up the hill and fell down
[1:58:47] there
[1:58:47] to speak in the name of elijah
[1:58:50] and said when she spoke she had a voice
[1:58:54] say

[1:59:10] [Applause]
[1:59:14] your dream was fulfilled right there
[1:59:16] sister steffi
[1:59:18] or immediately after that i went to
[1:59:20] louisville
[1:59:22] what you was needing was the prayer
[1:59:25] to see what she got through
[1:59:29] all right at the hospital and the sign
[1:59:31] of me going westward
[1:59:33] watching israel for my flock
[1:59:36] amen right for my flock amen

[1:59:44] my sister is this time why
[1:59:47] he wanted to go and give to us
[1:59:51] that interpretation of that rock
[1:59:54] and we see in the book of revelation 10
[1:59:56] 1-7 revelation 8 1
[1:59:58] and out there brother branham how he was
[2:00:01] doing things
[2:00:01] how he was performing how he said now my
[2:00:04] understanding of these things
[2:00:05] were quite different to what he has told
[2:00:07] me now in my room
[2:00:10] you see you were subjected unto that
[2:00:12] spirit so when he came there
[2:00:14] and uh uh day after day day after day
[2:00:17] the angel of the lord came
[2:00:19] and spoke to him god in some british
[2:00:21] guardians of the bridge
[2:00:22] first year secretary right up to the
[2:00:24] seventh seal and whatsoever
[2:00:26] and god was a part of it and he regarded
[2:00:29] in the book of the revelation of the
[2:00:30] seventh seal
[2:00:31] and if you got it brother read it day
[2:00:33] and night day and night day and night
[2:00:34] the seven churches day and night day and
[2:00:36] a day and night
[2:00:37] it will do something to your sustain
[2:00:45] to pray for sister stephanie then he
[2:00:47] goes on you may read that in search this
[2:00:49] is the time
[2:00:52] it says here i turned away and that
[2:00:55] quick something struck it
[2:00:56] i went home and went into my den room
[2:00:59] picked up
[2:01:00] that book
[2:01:04] that book what book did you
[2:01:07] and there it was wasn't concrete blocks
[2:01:10] it was stones i said mira
[2:01:12] get ready needed to go home now needed
[2:01:14] to leave that place you need to go
[2:01:15] because something
[2:01:16] is taking place he needed to go there
[2:01:20] he knew that the mighty angels will come
[2:01:22] down and when the mighty angels come
[2:01:23] down
[2:01:24] the pillar of cloud with the reformers
[2:01:26] and all that they formed jesus christ
[2:01:28] and he was caught up in the
[2:01:29] constellation to be there to understand
[2:01:31] what god has said
[2:01:32] and then he had his hand a little book
[2:01:34] that was open
[2:01:35] and then the messenger the earthly
[2:01:38] messenger was on earth at the time
[2:01:39] of his coming so he was captivated in
[2:01:42] that uh
[2:01:43] theophanic uh body of glorified body and
[2:01:46] he received the word of the lord
[2:01:47] and he came and he was there and taped a
[2:01:50] change day by day
[2:01:51] he gave the capital revelation of what
[2:01:53] it was
[2:01:55] and that is what we are training on
[2:01:57] praise the lord
[2:01:58] hallelujah during the first week of
[2:02:02] january
[2:02:04] 1963 brother branham and his family
[2:02:07] arrived in tucson
[2:02:10] it was to this oasis on the arizona
[2:02:14] desert
[2:02:14] that god led his prophet knowing that
[2:02:17] soon
[2:02:18] he would be calling him into the
[2:02:20] wilderness amen amen
[2:02:22] okay let's just stop
[2:02:25] let's go back did brother bryan said
[2:02:28] that he preached what paul preached
[2:02:30] amen did paul say
[2:02:34] he was taught by gamalia that's why i
[2:02:36] feel that
[2:02:37] did you say that you know you you taught
[2:02:39] all these things and but still
[2:02:40] you never got the satisfaction to have
[2:02:42] the philippine fire experience
[2:02:45] when you had the pillar of fire
[2:02:46] experience where you went he went into
[2:02:48] the desert
[2:02:50] did when he went to the desert what
[2:02:51] happened god spoke to him
[2:02:54] look to look yeah to hear come on now
[2:02:56] say amen
[2:02:58] i never received it of man neither was i
[2:03:00] taught it but by the revelation of jesus
[2:03:02] christ
[2:03:04] brother branham he went to the backside
[2:03:06] he went there to the oysters in the
[2:03:07] arizona desert
[2:03:08] that god led his prophet knowing that
[2:03:10] soon he would be calling him
[2:03:12] into the wilderness god had called his
[2:03:14] elijah
[2:03:15] prophet aside for a time of communion
[2:03:18] and revelation
[2:03:19] in the wilderness of the catalina
[2:03:21] mountains the lord will
[2:03:23] commission his servant for the third and
[2:03:26] final
[2:03:27] phase of his ministry come on our same
[2:03:29] man
[2:03:30] rejoice hallelujah this phrase
[2:03:33] would bring an anointing that would not
[2:03:35] only change
[2:03:36] the prophet but it's ordained to change
[2:03:39] a bride
[2:03:47] for this complete right
[2:03:51] he says here it has to wait
[2:03:54] till this time now
[2:03:57] all things has been brought
[2:04:00] coming shaping up to a headstone to a
[2:04:04] manifestation
[2:04:05] of the sons of god coming back and the
[2:04:08] spirit
[2:04:09] of god coming in to these
[2:04:12] men so perfectly until
[2:04:15] their ministry will be so close like
[2:04:18] christ's
[2:04:19] children it will join them and his
[2:04:22] church
[2:04:23] together i think i would have to stop
[2:04:25] there
[2:04:27] praise the lord right your thoughts can
[2:04:30] only take
[2:04:32] so much next time maybe we can
[2:04:35] just expand on those things
[2:04:39] and let god come and make our way and to
[2:04:42] show to you
[2:04:43] the capstone ministry of himself now
[2:04:47] no man was worthy amen to lose the
[2:04:50] shield amen
[2:04:52] behold the lion of the tribe of judah

[2:05:12] god
[2:05:13] how did the spirit of god come in how
[2:05:15] did the spirit of god come
[2:05:17] into and more fair with our prophet
[2:05:20] messenger who was our prophet
[2:05:24] messenger what relationship
[2:05:28] will the word bride be to the world
[2:05:31] what relationship will the prophet be to
[2:05:34] the word
[2:05:36] can you see what i'm saying so when he
[2:05:38] spoke why did brother branham say
[2:05:41] look to his wife and then said his wife
[2:05:44] is the church
[2:05:46] who are we looking to our husbands and
[2:05:48] wives who is our condition today
[2:05:50] do we understand one another do we have
[2:05:53] a cooperative
[2:05:55] uh balance of understanding and knowing
[2:05:58] what we need to do as a husband and a
[2:06:01] wife amen
[2:06:02] amen children how are you
[2:06:05] are you doing the things that god has
[2:06:07] forwarded for you to do

[2:06:33] go to work
[2:06:35] but you as a portion of the bride of
[2:06:36] jesus christ in this particular area
[2:06:39] and whichever area in the world god
[2:06:41] every day
[2:06:42] gave you a plate of food a drink of
[2:06:44] water to be sustained
[2:06:46] and to move on
[2:06:49] look to god and god will look to you
[2:06:53] it is with your faith that you exercise
[2:06:57] like enoch at the testimony that he
[2:06:59] pleased god
[2:07:01] being seventh from adam he was
[2:07:03] translated
[2:07:04] we come in the seventh church age we
[2:07:07] come out of

[2:11:58] glorious ministry for his last day amen
[2:12:01] amen that god set up on this earth amen
[2:12:05] and our people couldn't see it amen
[2:12:09] theologians bible scholars
[2:12:13] you know men of the church
[2:12:17] they couldn't see these glorious lights
[2:12:20] now one day when they realize we're
[2:12:22] going to tell them jesus already came
[2:12:24] amen
[2:12:30] he came already amen luke 17 30.
[2:12:34] his glorious message of this day amen in
[2:12:37] the prophet
[2:12:40] amen this message is jesus christ
[2:12:44] so one day when they realize you know
[2:12:46] what what they have missed
[2:12:48] in there what they turned out yes
[2:12:52] now we thank god for this because
[2:12:53] they'll say it's ripped on the whites
[2:12:57] but revealed to babes amen so we can
[2:13:00] feast on this word
[2:13:02] see they're the learned man the educated
[2:13:06] bible scholars
[2:13:09] they know about this message they read
[2:13:11] it yes they even studied
[2:13:13] they got their tape library in the in
[2:13:16] their studies
[2:13:17] yes but they can't see that's nice
[2:13:20] brother
[2:13:21] amen a lot of them are preaching from
[2:13:23] the message they want the message
[2:13:25] yeah there's to preach it and they say
[2:13:27] they can't see this message
[2:13:31] so the word has come and turned our
[2:13:33] hearts back
[2:13:35] thank you jesus for the pentecostal
[2:13:36] faith
[2:13:38] see all these hidden troops that were
[2:13:41] lost through the ages
[2:13:43] they made known to us amen and these
[2:13:46] divinely revealed mysterious truths
[2:13:51] turn our faith back hundred percent we
[2:13:53] believe it
[2:13:55] so our hearts are turned back thank you
[2:14:00] and uh if they can go and study all the
[2:14:02] ministries
[2:14:04] right from 1947
[2:14:08] there were great men all robots here tia
[2:14:11] osborne
[2:14:12] yeah billy graham many many others
[2:14:16] but never had a ministry like this and
[2:14:19] then
[2:14:20] they can see it's completely different
[2:14:23] to everybody else
[2:14:26] and they yet they're blinded they wanted
[2:14:28] to go back to the denominations
[2:14:31] how many of them came to the prophet and
[2:14:33] said we know you are preaching the truth
[2:14:36] amen but if you're going to go teach
[2:14:38] this and please you're gonna get kicked
[2:14:40] out
[2:14:41] but the prophet told them you know what
[2:14:42] you must be begging for your living on
[2:14:44] the streets
[2:14:45] then compromise and go to hell amen sure
[2:14:48] see some of them even knew it was the
[2:14:50] truth
[2:14:51] but they didn't wanna go wrong with it
[2:14:54] but we thank god he opened our eyes
[2:14:56] amen not to see these things see that's
[2:14:59] what will take uh
[2:15:00] it'll take a special people to believe
[2:15:03] these things
[2:15:04] amen say the bride special
[2:15:07] thank you the bride is predestinated and
[2:15:10] the prophet said
[2:15:12] the rapture is for the bride correct
[2:15:15] pre-destinated bride she's ordained to
[2:15:18] be there
[2:15:19] and then you know if you're listening to
[2:15:20] the messages you'll pick up the things
[2:15:24] the problem is saying while he's
[2:15:26] preaching and making altar calls and all
[2:15:28] yes and he's telling people give your
[2:15:30] heart to the lord come and serve him
[2:15:32] it talks about predestination he says if
[2:15:35] you're not in the predestination
[2:15:38] god has also made a way for you yes
[2:15:41] and he talks about free model agencies
[2:15:43] amen
[2:15:44] we don't come in by free model agencies
[2:15:46] no sir
[2:15:48] pick up a destination but there's people
[2:15:51] can come in by free moral agency
[2:15:54] amen they can they can repent and see
[2:15:58] that you know see what the message is
[2:16:01] about see what the law is all about
[2:16:04] and they receive it he actually says
[2:16:07] that
[2:16:07] god has made a way for you through free
[2:16:10] moral agency
[2:16:12] i'm glad for that amen so people that
[2:16:15] want to repent
[2:16:16] and receive the lord jesus christ
[2:16:20] they can't like the thief on the cross
[2:16:22] there
[2:16:24] the last minute he had no chance he had
[2:16:26] no chance to get baptized
[2:16:29] he had no chance to be part of a church
[2:16:31] nothing
[2:16:33] but right there he spoke to the lord to
[2:16:36] remember him
[2:16:37] amen and he said tonight you'll be with
[2:16:40] me in paradise
[2:16:42] he never got baptized
[2:16:46] the lord he received his salvation
[2:16:48] before even jesus
[2:16:50] was crucified and not went on the ground
[2:16:55] amen look at that glorious thing he got
[2:16:58] saved there
[2:16:58] on the cross okay see so let's press on

[2:21:15] challenge amen
[2:21:17] amen when the preacher came and preached
[2:21:20] and said
[2:21:21] in the other meetings and he said no
[2:21:24] jesus not god

[2:21:35] other pastors there
[2:21:36] amen took up the challenge amen man i
[2:21:39] challenged him i've sent him all the
[2:21:40] quotes
[2:21:41] on the goddamn amen and he was trying to
[2:21:43] put his own interpretation and
[2:21:46] there was another person trying to back
[2:21:47] him up and you know try to say
[2:21:49] this and say that amen but we showed him
[2:21:52] all the quotes and he all had his orders
[2:21:54] he was trying to bring in subtle two
[2:21:55] lords
[2:21:58] but we protested and protested and then
[2:22:01] the second time he preached he did the
[2:22:03] same thing
[2:22:03] and then i brought it up again amen none
[2:22:07] of the pastors want to challenge it
[2:22:08] amen we have the word amen but you know
[2:22:12] the third time he preached he preached
[2:22:14] him right
[2:22:17] he preached the goddess right amen he
[2:22:20] actually preached jesus christ
[2:22:22] he's god amen so let's stay with the
