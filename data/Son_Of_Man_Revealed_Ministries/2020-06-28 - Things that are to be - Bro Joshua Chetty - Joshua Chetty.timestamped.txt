[25:04] this morning do you know a basic place
[25:12] amen
[25:14] I'd be glad for that you know the we
[25:18] thought maybe the grace of God but the
[25:21] Bible also says the grace of our Lord
[25:23] Jesus Christ amen amen
[25:25] it's full of grace and mercy praise Lord
[25:28] babysitted a few months left to be in
[25:31] this morning him give him all the glory
[25:33] and praise in the span when the whole
[25:36] world is unsure and they don't know
[25:39] where they're going and what's gonna
[25:41] happen and everything else but I'll say
[25:44] kept the state of the Word of God amen
[25:46] then to our faith is stay on the
[25:49] promised Word of God and then we thank
[25:51] Bob you know he spoken everything to us
[25:53] you know as I said this word of God the
[25:56] Bible tells us the past tells us of
[26:02] present and also telling us what's
[26:05] waiting in the future everything God has
[26:07] given us a big leg so everything all the
[26:11] answers he and the Word of God so faith
[26:14] is nesting on this world especially in
[26:17] these last days where the Word of God
[26:19] has been open to us
[26:20] I meant the true revelation has done so
[26:23] the am denominator Brian she's
[26:27] predestinated elected to receive and to
[26:31] be at this age she got for us and they
[26:34] say you know I put us in this age right
[26:36] other believers have gone through other
[26:38] ages but it put us here at this age and
[26:41] we believe the world and press on to the
[26:44] coming of the Lord we know there's a
[26:47] tribulation for the world waiting ahead
[26:49] and there's a rapture waiting also to
[26:53] catch us all raised alone so we believe
[26:56] by faith by grace
[26:58] our names are they in the Lamb's Book of
[27:01] Life see all whose names are not there
[27:06] they are the one girl did you see
[27:09] and but he says the one that names are
[27:11] they will not be deceived so we will
[27:13] stand with the way we weren't going to
[27:15] the systems of this world into the
[27:18] programs that everything else that by
[27:21] deception they don't even know they're
[27:22] gonna be snuck into it but we'll take a
[27:25] stand for the Word of God the Bible has
[27:29] filled believers entire create this
[27:32] money from their savage not well he's
[27:34] got the flu right well rule touch him
[27:36] and make away free also brother sorry he
[27:40] went to the hospital this past week and
[27:42] the desert check is he's for a couple
[27:45] for a few months he had you know
[27:48] respiratory problems and things like
[27:50] that but the dribbler tests and they
[27:52] found cysts some growth on his land
[27:55] right so is they will go back this
[27:58] Wednesday and they're gonna assess how
[28:01] they do not break him that because he's
[28:04] a complicated case you know what is
[28:06] chest and all the states and so it's a
[28:10] dicey thing so you was gone Wednesday to
[28:14] decide other than a afraid and then want
[28:17] to remove it so we just bring up a
[28:20] little bit for the Lord the Lord will
[28:22] make a way through I went on the
[28:23] internet and I checked about you know
[28:26] these system roads and all of the lungs
[28:28] and I live quite a bit so the left side
[28:33] of your lung is in two sections right
[28:37] that's what the same the left side is
[28:40] two sections the right side is three
[28:42] sections right let me show you there if
[28:45] there's a there's a growth in one
[28:47] particular spot then happy prophecy
[28:50] which they just cut it off as a weight
[28:52] and if it's on one section of the five
[28:56] on the left or right you can either take
[28:59] up the wrong section
[29:00] oh right and if you Beach taking off one
[29:05] side of the lung I can take up the whole
[29:07] side of the law after the person through
[29:10] loops right and gap in there to show the
[29:13] other one throws in there you know
[29:16] and also they do lung transplants
[29:21] you know actually see them also do a
[29:23] lung transplant they take out a lung
[29:25] from somebody else in and Transplant it
[29:28] into the person so it's a it's not a
[29:32] very serious thing but you know they go
[29:34] to cutting there and getting there and
[29:36] all these things and you know cut off
[29:38] that area where the growth is so let's
[29:41] say I pray the Lord will make a way for
[29:42] it and you know be with him and give him
[29:45] grace so he's going on Wednesday for the
[29:48] graces one day and when they could
[29:50] operate and all this thing so and also
[29:54] we got used that believers in the
[29:57] Phoenix Arizona the pastor there Ron
[30:00] Peterson and some members of his church
[30:03] he's got the virus and his wife has got
[30:06] the virus and he's living awesome is
[30:08] really in hospital now but is that the
[30:11] treatment now and he said it's really
[30:12] much fine but is that the treatment they
[30:15] are giving him the drugs that will
[30:18] shorten the space of time you stay in
[30:20] hospital see so this thing is to carry
[30:23] God and also in our country the juice

[37:48] money let's turn our Bibles to the book
[37:51] of John
[37:54] reading from chapter 14 verse 1 to 7 I
[37:57] mean Amen I believe that God has
[38:00] something to say to all this money I
[38:03] think what Ronnie does eat it on the
[38:05] nail the thing that he was just speaking
[38:07] on now so I believe the Holy Spirit
[38:10] knows what do you want to be a man a man
[38:14] in John chapter 40 reading from verses 1
[38:17] to 7 Jesus speaking says let not your
[38:31] heart be troubled you believe in God
[38:34] believe also in me in my father's house
[38:39] are many mansions if it were not so I
[38:43] would have told you I go to prepare a
[38:47] place for you and if I go and prepare a
[38:50] place for you I will come again and
[38:53] receive you unto myself that where I am
[38:58] they they a maybe also hmm and would I
[39:03] go you know and the way you know Thomas
[39:09] saith unto Him Lord we know not whither
[39:12] thou goest and how can we know the way
[39:14] jesus said I say unto him I am the way
[39:17] the truth and the life no man cometh
[39:21] unto the father but by me if he had
[39:23] known me yeah when you should have known
[39:26] my father also and from n for you know
[39:30] him and have seen him
[39:33] a man you may be seated
[39:45] we're gonna speak this morning on the
[39:52] thing there ought to be a man a man
[39:55] that's why I said pastor Ronnie just hit
[39:57] it on the nail this morning he and I
[39:59] don't believe that anything happened by
[40:01] chance I believe the Holy Spirit is in
[40:04] control and he knows what he wants said
[40:06] to his people so we can speak on a
[40:08] subject all the things that are to be
[40:09] amen and for the subtitle we'll call it
[40:12] in the junction of time a man knowing
[40:15] the junction of time amen
[40:18] even I believe it's very important to
[40:20] always know the time that you living in
[40:22] because you might miss something that is
[40:25] happening in the hour that you're living
[40:26] in
[40:27] amen you might look at something in the
[40:28] past and rejoice upon it
[40:31] you might look at something in the
[40:33] future and look forward towards it but
[40:35] you're not looking at what's happening
[40:37] right now in the present hour so we're
[40:41] looking at the things that have to be we
[40:44] know the prophets he said to us that
[40:46] reading from this it's a very familiar
[40:50] structure and everybody knows this to be
[40:53] a funeral message but the property
[40:57] looking is what you said you want to
[40:59] draw from the context of it we're not
[41:01] looking just at the checks let's look at
[41:04] it in the context let's look at the
[41:06] picture bigger picture of it what Jesus
[41:08] is speaking about you remember yeah what
[41:11] is when he's speaking the scripture in
[41:13] John chapter 14 in John chapter 13 is
[41:20] breaking bread and giving wine to the
[41:23] disciples
[41:24] amen and we know we can trace that that
[41:29] type of characteristics or that type of
[41:32] attribute he write to Abraham method
[41:37] equals day after the slaughter of the
[41:39] king
[41:40] amen to come and break the bread and
[41:43] wine and give red and white to Abraham
[41:46] amen
[41:47] and here's my Connecticut game and he is
[41:50] now to East he's coming now to this to
[41:53] the seed of Abraham
[41:56] so we find that Jesus life is fixing to
[41:59] leave the earth so what is trying to
[42:03] show them that life is not ended in
[42:05] depth remember he's come to spoil every
[42:09] power and principalities a mess it's
[42:13] come to crush Satan a madman you come to
[42:16] take the sting of death but he's saying
[42:21] to his disciples would I go you know and
[42:26] the way you know he said I go to prepare
[42:28] a place for you and I will come again
[42:31] and receive you unto myself that where I
[42:33] am there may be also so he tried to say
[42:37] he's not trying to say to them he has to
[42:39] go and create something now he knows
[42:42] because we know we only have bodies
[42:44] waiting for us but he has to prepare a
[42:47] way for them to get there he remember we
[42:50] bypassed I was the offerees and we come
[42:54] into this flesh body we can buy a wrong
[42:58] Union amen because of the wrong act that
[43:00] happened in the Garden of Eden
[43:02] and because of the wrong union of our
[43:05] first births we cannot go to where we
[43:08] supposed to go but Jesus said I'll go
[43:11] and prepare a place for you none of us I
[43:13] will make provision in the way you
[43:16] should come there and he's been making
[43:18] provision throughout the seven church
[43:20] ages amen
[43:22] he was the one in the book of Revelation
[43:24] and the seven star is an amen amen
[43:28] and each time each star represented a
[43:32] messenger of the age a man and in every
[43:36] age a message went forth and whatever
[43:40] when the people received the message he
[43:42] caught them they captured him and he
[43:45] came under the message of the age amen
[43:47] and they were saved in age hey man man
[43:52] and we find that each age and a
[43:54] messenger in each age word came forth
[43:59] amen and it caught the attention of the
[44:02] people what happened when the word was
[44:04] rejected
[44:09] so it isn't very interesting now Jesus
[44:12] is speaking about things that are to be
[44:13] and remember this message is linked to
[44:16] the rapture message he is actually a
[44:18] continuation of the message of the
[44:21] lecture remember what the Prophet was
[44:23] speaking on the message of the rapture
[44:25] he was in this place and he was keep
[44:27] getting eaten up to the end of the
[44:28] service mmm
[44:29] because of the time and but he had all
[44:33] these thoughts and he was a continuation
[44:34] of those thoughts and then he comes and
[44:37] preached this message things that ought
[44:38] to be amen amen
[44:40] so you know you've got to take it
[44:41] together amen so Jesus speaking to the
[44:47] disciples when you see my life ending
[44:49] it's ending for a purpose doing a man in
[44:53] John 12:24 it says bitterly bitterly I
[44:55] say unto you except a corn of wheat fall
[44:58] into the ground and die it abideth alone
[45:03] it bringeth forth much food but if you
[45:09] die bring it forth much fruit so what
[45:13] are you trying to say if I thought he
[45:17] said he except I die I'll be the only
[45:21] one would have the awfully body if I
[45:25] don't make a way for you even if I don't
[45:29] make a way for you you are not going to
[45:31] get to that body I'll be the only one
[45:35] walking around after Libya with that
[45:38] body because jesus never buy pasta
[45:41] Stephanie amen he was the logos that
[45:44] came up from God amen he was the
[45:46] javanese the logos amen the same one
[45:49] that that Moses saw he saw the back part
[45:52] of the mat there was a deal for your God
[45:53] the same one that come to Abraham amen
[45:56] he wasn't one yeah but we bypassed all
[46:01] theophany we come into this world
[46:03] sorry to be tested and we were trapped
[46:06] into the space down amen
[46:10] we got trapped into the space dollars
[46:12] but now Jesus want to take out all the
[46:14] space dolls now you're saying in my
[46:16] father
[46:17] amen you are in the natural you are
[46:21] laying the kernel you are yeah the
[46:23] corruptible hey man
[46:24] you are yang the mortal but I'm going to
[46:26] show you the incorruptible I want to
[46:28] show you the immortal I want to show you
[46:31] not not not the house of mr. and mrs.
[46:34] so-and-so met in a game a union and you
[46:37] were born in I want to show you were
[46:39] holding my father's house are many
[46:42] mansions he say this yeah you say in my
[46:47] father's all these many kind of mansions
[46:49] I don't believe that when we get to
[46:51] heaven that we will be just everybody
[46:54] just look just exactly alike I don't
[46:58] believe it all we blondes or brunettes
[46:59] or little big or Giants I believe that
[47:02] God is a God of variety the world proves
[47:07] that he's got big mountains for little
[47:10] mountains he got planes he got gathered
[47:13] he's got different things because he
[47:15] made it the way he wanted it and he made
[47:19] the seasons he made summer will just
[47:21] spring out him he made season each
[47:23] shallows he's a God of righty he made
[47:28] you in a variety some men are real
[47:30] prosperous and some are real dogmatic
[47:33] and others are fine I was a kind and you
[47:37] just find all different kinds of people
[47:40] amen enemies Kingdom see he said look at
[47:45] st. Peter and judging my Andrew Andrew
[47:48] is the prayer warrior just need only
[47:50] need all the time he and the Apostle
[47:53] Peter was one of those firebrands they
[47:55] preach and so fun and poor was most
[47:57] fallen alike and see Moses wrote the
[48:03] first four books of the old which he
[48:06] wrote the Old Testament the risk of it
[48:07] was the laws and kings and sons and so
[48:09] forth and what someone wrote of the
[48:12] prophets but Moses wrote the roles the
[48:15] first four books of the first four books
[48:17] of the Bible Genesis Exodus Leviticus
[48:19] and Deuteronomy
[48:20] do not run on me and then Paul wrote the
[48:24] New Testament that's true Matthew Mark
[48:27] Luke and John wrote the ex of what they
[48:30] can place
[48:30] so what but Paul separated law and grace
[48:34] and put it in his place yes he was the
[48:38] light of the New Testament he gave us
[48:40] the writings of the New Testament
[48:42] shedding the Word of God in order so he
[48:45] said I noticed many mansions many kind
[48:48] of mansions so what he's trying to show
[48:50] us now when he's talking about the many
[48:52] mansions
[48:53] he has different types of people live
[48:56] amen amen and you look at the there's
[49:00] millions of people out there that's
[49:04] gonna make this mansion they men from
[49:06] every Church change if you look at the
[49:09] dark age alone 68 million people were
[49:11] martyred every age every messanger the
[49:17] people under them that's why this
[49:19] problem when he went beyond the curtain
[49:20] of time he was gathered with these
[49:22] people
[49:23] and every messenger was gathered with a
[49:25] people of every age but the entire all
[49:30] those ages make up the body of Christ it
[49:34] make up all his mentioned amens but what
[49:37] it was
[49:38] it's the often easy man many theophanies
[49:41] coming together make you up dimension
[49:43] amen what he was forming his pyramid
[49:46] city amen and she was at dawn at the
[49:50] Bible book of Revelation says she was
[49:51] adorned as a bride a man coming down
[49:54] from heaven email because one of these
[49:57] days we know like what Jesus was in the
[50:00] year 2000 years ago he had to empty out
[50:02] paradise amen
[50:04] he had to empty attenders what are these
[50:06] days the six that I mentioned will have
[50:08] to be emptied out and you have to come
[50:11] and populate the earth amen because why
[50:14] there will be your earth that will be
[50:15] renovated there will be other than will
[50:17] be foot for it to dwell in and she loves
[50:19] to come and populate this earth I don't
[50:22] know when I've talked about population I
[50:24] don't mean they're common repopulate I'm
[50:26] talking but when there's no one else
[50:28] here you've got everything else is
[50:29] destroyed they will come in populated
[50:31] amen
[50:33] that will make up the population of the
[50:34] earth at a time even in the Millennium
[50:41] a man all this was either he's preaching
[50:48] his things things that have to be is
[50:50] pitching the rapture message but God at
[50:53] that time he didn't want it to be
[50:54] revealed
[50:55] so he you know today is not saying all
[50:58] these things like when Jesus was on you
[51:01] and he comes and says it in terrible
[51:02] form he's coming and speaking his thing
[51:04] but he wasn't our amen where there will
[51:07] be a bride on the earth amen
[51:09] where the seals are broken to her amen
[51:12] and nothing is it from an event the
[51:15] entire revolution that will be to her
[51:18] because why what he said
[51:20] I would say the King it was the Holy
[51:22] Ghost coming a great Haven the very same
[51:25] own egos that was there revealing the
[51:26] seals to him he's a very holy go that
[51:29] will come and feed us back this word
[51:30] again so we find that John 24 he said
[51:43] bitterly verily I say unto you except a
[51:45] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[51:47] die the pilot alone if we die and bring
[51:50] it forth much it'll bring it forth much
[51:52] fruit
[51:52] now that the seals are broken and the
[51:57] Bible now to us it becomes a new book
[51:59] amen because everybody come to - it
[52:01] comes to make the Bible in plain view to
[52:03] us from Genesis to Revelation we start
[52:07] to see it in this context now we start
[52:09] to understand this this book of
[52:11] redemption we start to understand Christ
[52:14] is the mystery of God's revealed God's
[52:17] three for purpose plan that he had right
[52:19] from the beginning
[52:20] amen then he wanted to restore fallen
[52:23] air for the matter more than Adam fallen
[52:26] Eve and fallen Eden and he's working
[52:30] through this plan right through the
[52:31] Bible amen and we're looking at
[52:33] different characteristics in the by
[52:35] characters in the Bible we watch God
[52:38] calling on Abraham out of Babylon amen
[52:42] and he called him to a place that he
[52:45] didn't even know
[52:48] but Abraham by faith he went sojourn in
[52:51] a strange land even hey man but all this
[52:55] while he was searching for a city whose
[52:56] Buddha and make me his boy hey man he
[53:01] wanted you and he suffered to set for
[53:03] the city and we know that one day he had
[53:05] a visitation a man started first it was
[53:09] a voice speaking to him and then it was
[53:12] he's coming now into your free forum to
[53:14] speak to him so he met the king of that
[53:20] city a man when he comes into open forum
[53:23] what he's doing Abraham is meeting the
[53:24] king of the city Amos and he knows that
[53:27] is there does eternal city and he began
[53:30] to search for it hmm and he know that he
[53:32] was just so joining and so joining and
[53:34] he knew that it was a better place he
[53:36] was a better life amen
[53:42] because in Genesis 18 when he comes to
[53:45] it now is Elohim amen he comes to him
[53:48] and he promises them he come visit him
[53:52] at the time of life what happened after
[53:54] that
[53:54] there was a body change amen the fact
[53:58] there was a body change it showed to
[54:00] Abraham the day in the place he men Dave
[54:03] another place it is another dimension
[54:06] amen there is another place where you
[54:08] can have this body hey man
[54:10] because the experience that body change
[54:12] right there where did that body change
[54:15] come from what came from some from
[54:17] another world
[54:18] hey man what come from another dimension
[54:20] and come to him and being a prophet he
[54:23] saw he saw three of them but he said
[54:25] you're my lord
[54:26] he identified who years would amen in
[54:30] this day there was seven angels coming
[54:32] down but we recognize the mighty angel
[54:34] amen
[54:35] we like a knife boiling shall come down
[54:37] a man the mighty God and will before us
[54:43] yes amen the mighty God comes to
[54:46] Plainview in front of us hidden from the
[54:50] from the from the world amen just like
[54:54] when Jesus went across wounded when the
[54:56] Train of the temple the the Train of the
[54:59] for the cut-ins was was lately trainees
[55:02] the curtain was read between and they
[55:06] Jesus on the cross comes in plain view
[55:08] he but hidden to the people at that time
[55:12] given to the Jews at that time they were
[55:14] blinded and just like that he comes in
[55:17] plain view to us but he's hidden from
[55:20] the world
[55:20] he's hidden from the system man cannot
[55:23] see what happened people are talking
[55:27] about the coming of the Lord but we know
[55:30] that is the sequence of event that
[55:31] happens there's a sequence of events
[55:33] that must take place before the coming
[55:35] of the Lord we know that the rapture was
[55:39] the hidden must it was a cycle that had
[55:40] to happen
[55:42] amen but everyone speaking about the
[55:46] coming of the Lord
[55:48] everyone speaking about a repkin going
[55:51] to heaven how are you going to go there
[55:53] if there was no preparation for you II
[55:56] he said I go to prepare a place for you
[56:02] aren't you glad this morning that
[56:05] through all the faults and failures in
[56:08] the flesh to all the sin of mankind he
[56:12] is going to prepare a place for us and
[56:14] when you began to see that one going
[56:17] take that book in Revelation chapter 5
[56:19] Amen that one that was fun worthy when
[56:22] you personally begin to see that you
[56:24] begin to take that book and you begin to
[56:27] see those seals broken amen and you'll
[56:29] begin to see that now I'll be the tone
[56:31] for hey man
[56:32] now I mean accounted for my name is let
[56:35] book and if my name is in that book you
[56:37] cannot be taken out you're not being
[56:40] doubt anymore who you are you'll not be
[56:43] wavering anymore you'll not be tossed to
[56:45] and fro you will recognize your position
[56:48] you will recognize that you are saved by
[56:51] a saving grace of God you will recognize
[56:54] that it was purely election you're like
[56:56] a night you know your predestinated
[56:58] in today's age for a purpose amen
[57:04] but we find exactly the crystals we look
[57:09] at people dying every day we'll get a
[57:11] body decaying every day we look at the
[57:13] bodies suffering we look at people
[57:15] getting older we look at all kind of
[57:18] diseases coming in pestilences and so
[57:20] forth but he is a better body there is
[57:26] one waiting day man me man there's one
[57:29] not matrons

[57:34] man when we come in his first but he'd
[57:41] come from the this first but he comes
[57:43] from a life that started in the Garden
[57:47] of Eden it comes by perversion that
[57:50] comes from the tree of the knowledge of
[57:52] good and evil our first birth comes from
[57:56] perversion it comes from the body
[57:59] responds amen but this one has
[58:02] foundations and bodies speaking about it

[58:09] the land and he began to see these
[58:12] things

[58:16] and his body and then he sees himself in
[58:19] another body even another body but isn't
[58:21] that body but he sees himself in another

[58:26] speak there yes because he wasn't meant

[1:07:16] that's already done a minute when he's
[1:07:20] talking about preparing a way for you to
[1:07:22] get there because you need a new birth
[1:07:24] to get it wound up by your first but you
[1:07:26] cannot get the first but will never get
[1:07:29] you there yes you must die to the whole
[1:07:32] nature the first husband must be put

[1:07:38] you need the new birth to get there amen
[1:07:43] what a promise we have we don't have a
[1:07:45] promise to come to do together and just

[1:07:58] Jesus was the first born of a new

[1:08:03] he was there the show has a different
[1:08:07] yet different species we had different
[1:08:10] kind of people
[1:08:11] yes he come to speak to us about another
[1:08:13] place amen he come to speak up to a
[1:08:16] house about another body and that's why
[1:08:20] you wasn't up worrying about the
[1:08:21] temporal things when he was preaching
[1:08:22] around at that time you wasn't talking

[1:46:52] talking about Israel army of you at
[1:46:54] their news this morning anybody listen
[1:46:57] to the news on the radio
[1:46:59] Robin okay
[1:47:01] talk about Israel now our country is in
[1:47:04] a serious problem that is the government
[1:47:07] and other political parties because they
[1:47:10] are against Israel the bottle says those
[1:47:15] who bless Israel be bless those who
[1:47:18] curse Israel be cursed now because only
[1:47:22] uses foreign the supreme what's it
[1:47:26] called McRae McRae McRae my sister chief
[1:47:32] justice the Chief Justice is the highest
[1:47:35] authority Israel the highest authority
[1:47:38] he said he is for Israel and he says the
[1:47:43] Bible said was pray for Jerusalem and he
[1:47:46] quoted the scripture from the book of
[1:47:48] Psalm that you know I think he's steady
[1:47:50] lad or something and he said all those
[1:47:52] who bless Israel be blessed
[1:47:53] all those who cast is going to be cursed
[1:47:56] now as a chief justice the highest or in
[1:48:00] the code day now they are calling for
[1:48:03] him to resign that's in the news and
[1:48:08] they answer no because why they NC want
[1:48:11] to support the Palestinians but the
[1:48:15] Bible said those who can seize will be
[1:48:17] cursed
[1:48:17] so they don't stand for Israel the back
[1:48:21] in the Palestinians see so we thank god
[1:48:25] this our country is gone
[1:48:29] could that say yes they're gone
[1:48:32] just for the sake of the bride the bride
[1:48:35] would be yeah see so just a moment are
[1:48:38] they in the calling for him to resign
[1:48:39] the chief justice
[1:48:41] but he says listen dia the Bible says we
[1:48:43] must pray for his left we must pray for
[1:48:46] Jerusalem
[1:48:48] hasten things that are to do you know
[1:48:53] when the Prophet lost his first wife in
[1:48:55] the flood 1947 she actually died I think
[1:49:00] it was TB or something she actually died
[1:49:03] and they didn't want to let the proper
[1:49:05] to get to her but he says now I'm going
[1:49:07] to go to see her and then later down in
[1:49:09] the basement over there were all the
[1:49:11] dead bodies that she was dead I want the
[1:49:14] Prophet when they're shooting at me
[1:49:17] talking to us that she's dead all of us
[1:49:23] he opened the eyes and she looked up she
[1:49:28] says bull why did you call me back I was
[1:49:32] born entering the beautiful gates and
[1:49:34] there's beautiful birds flying around
[1:49:37] everywhere he said what are you talking
[1:49:41] about
[1:49:42] he says bull this is heaven you're
[1:49:45] preaching about it amen
[1:49:50] say there is a land over there then we
[1:49:54] had a chat she didn't say Oh bull you
[1:49:56] know what i'ma lighten up Lisa you know
[1:49:58] yeah can I get from here and go with you
[1:50:00] no she was you know she's gonna go she
[1:50:06] was just given that a grace of God to
[1:50:08] open that and never check with the
[1:50:09] Prophet and he had a chat and she said
[1:50:13] well promise me you won't preach to
[1:50:15] those people that those poor people
[1:50:17] he says that's a reason why this
[1:50:20] happened
[1:50:22] I was about to drink those beautiful
[1:50:25] gates and he called me they praise the
[1:50:29] Lord
[1:50:31] see that's what we went to Basel and see
[1:50:37] so he said lord help us we just want to
[1:50:41] believe in place on the devil
[1:50:42] so we were said ABBA but why must we
[1:50:45] believe this message you know is it only
[1:50:47] through this messy but the Prophet tells
[1:50:49] us those who believe no one's message
[1:50:51] only and no matter all the opposite
[1:50:55] occator him against noah and they didn't
[1:50:58] want to believe he said God said so God
[1:51:02] said so isn't it'll be a flood God said
[1:51:05] so so we can apply the same word today
[1:51:08] God said so
[1:51:11] amen those who come out of the ministry
[1:51:14] not this Minister malicious is barreling
[1:51:17] north this each junction of time see
[1:51:21] many mysteries in the world you know
[1:51:24] Jesus is preaching in Israel again not
[1:51:27] by their minds the teachers Jesus is
[1:51:31] preached in Israel I put some posted on
[1:51:36] what's up we must have seen those things
[1:51:37] and when they preaching Jesus please
[1:51:42] alone and the problem is the Word of God
[1:51:45] tells us where the gospel go back to the
[1:51:47] Jews how glorious is gonna be amen
[1:51:53] so we press on the devil give him all
[1:51:57] the glory give him all the praise see so
[1:52:01] he's going to see through this message
[1:52:02] that God raised up a prophet and those
[1:52:06] seven angels came down it was list
[1:52:09] now this is right there with the pasta
[1:52:12] around filthy listen they got the virus
[1:52:16] in Phoenix Arizona right their way see
[1:52:21] this thing happen that was in fresh
[1:52:23] stuff name they were in Phoenix see so
[1:52:27] it was right over there contact to the
[1:52:29] starting from the east go to the West
[1:52:32] plays along see so this message came to
[1:52:36] call out a bride that's why I said now
[1:52:40] when the profit will we have the capital
[1:52:41] of time he was a leader there was no
[1:52:45] other leaders for the bride day
[1:52:48] amen see so if our names who they will
[1:52:53] come for the problem said that word must
[1:52:56] strike that heart if we were predestined
[1:53:00] then we are picking a man we come to
[1:53:04] life amen
[1:53:06] so not everybody can believe this
[1:53:08] message people attend the back Sunday
[1:53:11] they have said all manner of things and
[1:53:12] and everything else but there's a
[1:53:15] predestined right and God brought us
[1:53:17] here for his glory
[1:53:19] he made us bypass of theosophy for his
[1:53:22] glory amen
[1:53:25] to show their enemy and he'll ever
[1:53:27] bright here
[1:53:28] place the rock so we press on the battle
