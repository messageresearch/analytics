Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 2. we'll speak for a little uh title in the subject and I'll just says be not forgetful strangers by some amen you may be seated may the Lord and blessings to the reading of his word amen we find we're living in a very exciting time amen we're living at the brink of the closing of the Gentile dispensation amen and the title this morning will be entertaining Angels amen taken from that scripture so in this body that we live in we are limited to what we can see but there's more going on in this three-dimensional world than what meets the human eye amen there is an Unseen World that the natural man can miss but we can train ourselves to be more sensitive to the Unseen World amen now Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 is talking about the lives of the Prophet coming before the great as I references scriptures you can throw them up amen Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 because I want also these scriptures to be embedded in the Arts of the young people these are our scriptures young people amen you've got to know these Scriptures it pertains to the hour that we have because we have received the Elijah the prophet in our day yeah now when Elijah the prophet comes he's going to turn off heart back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers amen now when our hearts are turned back to the original Pentecostal fathers and we're looking at the book of Acts because that's the Pentecostal father does everybody agree and we look at the book of Acts and we've got to see a mirror mirror image of ourselves amen and the book of Acts is it's actually the acts of the Holy Spirit in the apostles amen and you cannot deny the working of the supernatural power of God in that early church now we have received the opening of the word we have received the word because remember man made Theology and programs could only lead us so far in fact we gave the Catholic Church a chance gave the denominational World a chance and they could not meet enzyme conditions Amen in fact men on their own had failed completely and that is why at the end of this seventh Church age at the end of the Legacy and church age man God cannot rely on just men and even though he got his seventh angel Prophet on the Earth the prophet can only move up until a certain point so there's got to come in word from this Unseen World in Revelation 10 . so the word that we are receiving you cannot find it in a Bible School you can search every Bible School you will never find the revelation of the hour it came via an angel a mighty angel in the Bible says amen so God at so set it forth that a mighty Angel would come with the most important message to give us a faith to take a translation in this hour the changing of our bodies so we are not living in ordinary times amen we are living in extraordinary times amen amen so we've got to be sensitive to the things of God now the prophet would say here we can go to the first slide with a quote he's talking about electricity and he's bringing this as a type he says there's no one in the world that knows what electricity is amen he says they can harness it they can make light they can cook with it they can heat it they can light with it but no one knows what it is it take two pieces of material rolling together makes the continuity and sends out the electricity so that's the way when a Christian gets to working with God rolling together that brings an unseen force that does Mysteries that none of us knows nothing about amen amen amen Hallelujah you and I are not ordinary people even if you take us in our secular jobs in our secular position you are not an ordinary person you're an extraordinary person amen amen have you ever seen a holy ghost-field policeman well we have two of them yet and these are unconventional policemen because they carry an anointing have you ever seen holy ghostful lawyers when we got two of them and more on the way in there amen you put that in your line of work and what you do I'm bringing it down to the Natural because you are not ordinary amen if you are in the flesh then yes you are ordinary then you are just an electrician you're just a burger but when you're born again you know Born Again electrician you're a born-again businessman amen you don't do things according to the world Amen you're an anointed son and daughter of God and every place that you go you carry this anointing with you what am I trying to say you carry this unseen force and Unseen World with you amen amen and we've got to become more conscious of this world we cannot operate in the ordinary anymore amen if we want to go forward with the things of God and his program in this hour we've got to mirror ourselves back with the book of Acts yes and I mentioned this on Wednesday if we take the message church as a whole there's a key element missing and that's the moving of the angel of God now we can hide behind yes the angel of God is moving through the opening of the word yes undeniable we know it we've seen it we've heard it but they've also seen physical manifestations of the angel of God they actually saw the angel of God Amen amen and the angel of God can appear in many forms amen now if we go to that second slide there the second slide of that scripture I've got something highlighted there amen not this we need to get to the scripture when I say scripture I mean scripture not quote amen Hebrews chapter 13. it says here be not forgetful amen so what is he saying Human Condition can make us forgetful right amen be not forgetful what makes people forgetful especially with age it's called amnesia amen but a word has been given to us in this hour to take away our amnesia so he says be not forgetful to entertain strangers now these angels now they are mining angels and there is the angel of God many angels can visit us in our homes amen and if you have ever met the met an angel of God how many of you ever had an encounter let me see your hand I wear an encounter with an angel of God amen amen but I want you to know that more people have had encounters with angels and what raised their hands sometimes we appear to us in forms that we did not recognize Sometimes they come in the form of a man but yes amen so the Bible says be not forgetful to entertain strangers amen he says because thereby some have entertained angels unawares amen amen unaware we have entertained these angels amen now we have got to make room in our lives to entertain his presence and the only way we can do that is to start changing the atmosphere around us all right amen we cannot expect to live in the world and do the things of the world and expect to have Angelic visitation and the presence of God in our homes amen we've got to do introspection and see and get away everything that's not of God amen I'm going to reference now and we can get to it you can open it up in your scripture amen Genesis chapter 18. this is the second time that the AIM that an angel is mentioned in scripture the first time in fact it's quite surprising you think the angel of God would appear two two a Believer first I mean if you know the angels of God appeared to the first time it was aega amen you remember when she ran away from Sarah the angel of God appeared to her and told her go back amen so watch even we would regard that as unbelief right Abraham impregnating agar but the angels of God was concerned about it he was even concerned about the seed that was in her and he said I'll make this nation a great nation amen so in Genesis 18 it says the Lord appeared unto Abraham in the plains of memory and he said that the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifts up his eyes and he sees three men standing by him and he runs to the tent door and he bows himself to the ground so watch worship amen watch how he's entertaining the Angels amen amen he says if I found favor in your stride past not let me get a little bit of water now watch he gets to the physical yeah and I can show you numerous times in the Bible where food and water is involved yeah the Unseen comes to the natural world and the partake of natural substances amen amen so don't be afraid to entertain strangers and give one another food amen amen because the angel of God and the spirit of God that's living within you you can also entertain that there's nothing wrong with you inviting me me inviting you over a meal amen like we're going to see in fact if you don't want to really do it I'm going to make you do good to everyone I'm just going to come visit you and expect something because the Bible says that even if you offer something to one of these little ones amen address you want so I'm going to force you not to be mean yes amen I know you're not mean amen I know you're very giving people amen but watch how he gets you entertaining he doesn't think of some super super spiritual thing he doesn't go for his message book learn now it doesn't go for his message book it doesn't go for any literature he sees the need and he says let me get you water let me wash your feet and he says rest under the tree I will fetch a morsel of bread Comfort your hearts and after that you can go right he tells him now watch and they said do as thou I said so they were in agreement amen with hospitality amen they were in agreement with entertaining the angel of God so Abraham Eastern into the tent and to Sarah I want you to catch just because the prophet had intent vision and all the while while there was Angelic presentation shower remained in the tent amen didn't the prophet see a little room in the tent amen amen Hallelujah now watch Supernatural things are going to happen to Sarah and a word of Prophecy is going to be given to her while she remains in the tent amen amen amen so Abraham goes and he makes really three measures of fine meal now I can take each thing and type it out with Christ right because you know the meal offering amen you see that the meal of ring and he makes cakes upon the earth now if you were to go back to Eastern tradition you will know he was making some nice parathas awesome non-bread that's how they make this thing right falling out quickly I don't have time to dwell in detail then he runs through the herd and he gets a young lamb come on I need to decide to wake up I'm not getting any image from this side he said brother Joshua amen it sounds like I'm listening in mono if you know what mono is I need stereo amen otherwise I'm going to shift you all around and put some amen people on this side and put some people on this side amen and he says to settle back to the side because she was a good amen calling her this side amen you know they say uh you you get influenced by the people around you so if the people around you are not saying amen maybe they push you there so you can scream amen very strategic move there amen Hallelujah so maybe a little fire a man will liven up all of us amen can I get some emails from the back amen hallelujah yes yes amen we're talking about an atmosphere Abraham was trying to create an atmosphere so don't even now while I told you that don't get what's wrong I'm not picking I'm trying to make you change the atmosphere amen amen so he says so watch now all of those three things go and study it he takes fine meal amen he takes a young tender lamb and you know who the lamb represented amen and he takes all of these things and he begins to sacrifice it because the one sitting in front of him will become all of those sacrifices amen amen and then look he took butter and more and enjoyed it add garlic garlic now [Music] it messed it and he said it before them and stood under the tree and they didn't eat and watched after that way Sarah thy wife in the tent vision she's still in the tent Vision yes amen and I want you to know she remains in the tent even while the discernment is taking place pay attention now while the prophet Ministry is going on she's still mailed behind the tent amen because they are no not being a mess right right I'll be following this if you know 10 Vision you know what I'm talking about and he tells and now what's the discernment because he entertain the angel of God Supernatural things are going to start to take place and this is God in the scripture this is dealing with the body change yes amen this same Mighty Angel appeared in this day in Revelation 10. and now if you know there is also eating taking place in Revelation 10. amen amen so he took what he says I'm going to return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah Heard It In The Tint door which was behind him so you'll see there 11 is confirming that they were old and stricken in age so this is going to take a supernatural intervention for Cerro is part of the age of childbearing to now be a child amen amen amen so you know the terror laughs we're not going into all of that my point was I want to show you that they entertain the angel of God Amen job 29 and verse 12 says because I deliver the poor that cried and the fatherless and him there had none to help him this is beautiful now job 29 you know what they say job is one of the oldest books in the Bible John 29 and verse 12. he says because I delivered the poor that cried are we hearing the cries of the poor and the fatherless and him that had none to help him the blessing of him that was ready to perish Came Upon me there's a blessing attached to it did you follow amen amen he says the blessing of the one that is about to perish Came Upon me and I caused the Widow's heart to sing for Joy amen amen amen I caused the Widow's heart to sing for joy hallelujah amen moving along now amen God can use you and God can use the prophets and God can use situations and circumstances in our lives to bring about a blessing upon us now we come to Elijah the prophet in First Kings chapter 17. I'm going to move through these stories very quickly here it is now now remember I'm gonna go from Elijah to Elijah and show you something here amen so Elijah is typing the prophet and Elisha is typing the bride everybody say amen amen amen so Elijah the cheese fight you know he's coming before air and he is causing judgment to come upon the land because AF was walking wickedly before the Lord and he caused Israel to sin so what did he say they shall not be due or Reign for three years but according to my word right so the Lord tells him in verse 3 get the ants tell the Eastward and hide themselves by the Brookshire that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook as I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there and he did according to the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook sheriff and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning so not only can we entertain the angel of God or the angels of God but God can also provide Supernatural food for us amen Ravens are bringing bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank off the brook and he came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land now learn something from this now the judgments of God that are coming upon the Earth even now the vials that are being poured on even the Believers I will be subjected to it to all the economic crisis and the turmoil that's happening the Believers will be affected by it because the land of the Prophet said there'll be no rain and even himself had to endure Without Rain and God did not make it Supernatural that he would have water only I'm talking about now in the wilderness there God could have continued letting the brook to run yeah and let Ravens feed him but God subjected his own prophet to the Judgment of the Earth that even the brook that he was drinking from dried up yes so the believer is is affected by the Judgment that is passed on the Earth that is why you're feeling it economically tough times now you're feeling it hard you cannot get anything from the grocery stores amen with the money that we once spent 500 before you could get some decent stuff now very few items amen so you are experiencing difficulties because of the judgments that are being poured out upon the Earth anybody feeling it anybody feeling it anybody feeling it when you get to the gas stations amen so some of the judgments you don't know it but why are they subjecting the Earth to the Greenpeace deal everyone must conform to it because the Judgment of the Lord apparted upon the Earth and God is going to destroy them that destroyed the Earth man has destroyed the Earth it has shook the Earth of its materials and pollute to the Earth not only immorally but also physically but the Caleb was sharing something we shared this a few months ago or last year but he reminded us amen they put the new Doomsday Clock out yeah and they said 90s remember the prophet preached three minutes to midnight now they're saying 90 seconds to midnight amen so the Lord will sustain us through all of it because the Lord is going to sustain Elijah the prophet now and when we follow the lord he will work all things together for our good amen so the Lord instructs him to go to the Widow of zeropheth we just read the scripture right he's going to cause the Widow's heart to sing that was in job sing for joy in other words the twofold purpose for God doing the supernatural in This Woman's life so he goes to zeropheth and he says I have commanded him with a woman to sustain thee there amen he said I commanded that you do it yes but when he gets here the woman knows nothing about it amen so the woman comes to the gate the Bible says in verse 10 of the city and behold the woman was gathering sticks the prophet says she was taking two sticks to make the last fire and have a last meal and she and a son were preparing emotionally physically they were preparing mentally that this is going to be our last meal and we are going to die and even as you begin you can turn to Psalm 37 they put it up on there amen even as she began to walk now remember this is after the days of King David the Psalms are already written and while she's Gathering the streets she begins to recite his sound trust in the Lord and do good so shall not dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed she starts to remember the word of God Amen she starts to recite the word of God and she says Delight thyself in the Lord and He Shall give you the desires of your heart she says commit your ways to the Lord and Trust all to heal him and he shall bring it to pass amen amen amen she goes to verse 7 it says rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospered in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass and she goes to verse 11 and says the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of peace amen then she goes to verse 23 and she says the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord he delighted in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upolded him with his hand and now she says I have been Young she remembers this verse now of King David and says and now I am old and yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken no exceed begging amen Now watch how the Holy Spirit tied that psalming with the scripture amen because after this meal what would she have to do if she wanted to survive she would have to be big but you remember the scripture I have never seen the righteous forsaken no is he begging bread and just about then Elijah calls to her we need to go back to the description says fetch me I pray thee a little water in your vessel an emotion of bread in that hand now notice the continuity of where we started it's dealing with bread and water and natural things and when we become obedient to these kind of things and hospitality and entertain strangers it opens up the Unseen World yeah and she says as long as the Lord God liveth I am not King but I am full of meal in the barrel yes it again being in the barrel and a little oil in the cruise and I'm gathering two sticks that I might go in and dress it for me and my son we may eat and die and Elijah said unto our fear not go and do as thou I said but make me therefore a little cake first amen yes amen Hallelujah and bring it unto me and after make for thee and thy son and she went and did a calling to the saying of Elijah and she said and she and he and the house did eat many days right how many days you say and the barrel of meal wasted not amen neither did the crews of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah amen so there's a reason the Lord is sending him to the Widow not only for him to sustain her through this difficult time because the judgments are passed upon Israel but also because Elijah is going to be there he also needs sustenance through three and a half years and the Lord is not going to send him house to house baking yes yes he's coming to a specific woman amen good during the time of the judgments remember amateur judgments are upon the Earth and the word of the Lord has come to a specific woman in this hour amen and the word is remaining with her yes amen through the judgments amen amen and as long as the prophet stayed with her and she stayed with the prophet they were going to make it through the time of famine amen amen this was God's provided place of sustenance for Elijah and it was also a provided way for the woman to make it through the famine that's the message we've been given in this hour Amen to make it to spiritual famine but we've got to stay with the prophet and his message amen this was the meeting and a Divine Arrangement that was going to lead to a greater miracle for the women now watch beautiful type you know Elijah is typing the prophet and we know that our Elijah the prophet what in a great what Ministry Healing Ministry amen you'll find in verse 17 it goes where it says the one the Mistress of the house felt sick a sickness was so sore and there was no breath in it the son of the woman right so the woman's son goes sick and Elijah said what have I to do with thee o man of God at that time to call my sin to remembrance and slay my son and he said unto a gift so the son does not die the sun is sick and he performs a sign and the sign is healing so you'll find here in verse 22 the Lord the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and revived and Elijah took the child and brought him down under the chamber into the house and delivered him unto the mother and said see thy son liveth and the woman said to Elijah now by this I know that what a man of God and that the word of the Lord is in thy mouth is truth amen amen so that Elijah meeting the woman of xerophyll the widow woman right but Elisha who is the type of the bride and has a double portion anointing amen also meets another woman amen amen you'll find this in second Kings chapter four we'll start at verse eight and this is the shulamite woman amen one brought healing to the boy there was healing in the days of the prophet but are they double portion anointing shall come forth the resurrection of the Dead shall come forth the resurrection of the sleeping Saints amen because yeah the sunamite woman is bearing and unfruitful you know that watch again verse 8 it fell on a day Elijah passed to show them where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat what bread and so it was that ought as he passed by it until that we eat bread sell the physical elements still Hospitality still entertaining strangers and she said unto a husband see she doesn't know who he is she just knows he's a stranger but she talks to her husband and says I perceive that this is a holy man of God which passeth us continually yeah let us make a chain by praying on the wall let us set for him there bed a table stool Candlestick and it shall be when he comes he shall turn internal so you know the he comes in there and then the prophet asks and he says in verse 13 that was being careful to take care of us what it should be done for thee can we speak to the king the captain of The Host and because he said verily she had no child her husband is old and he said call her and when he had called her she stood at the door and about the season according to the time of what according to the time of life same thing in Genesis 18 thou shall Embrace a son now this is a spoken word by the bride Ministry amen amen you shall have a son yeah you shall have a daughter you shall have whatsoever you desire amen spoken word under the bright Ministry and verse 17 says the woman conceived bear son at the season that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life pay attention now the Joshua labeled last week and he told you the angel of God moving in a specific season right we're telling you the season is open now amen amen but if you know well if you read the proper message when the hunting season is open that's when they went hunting when the answer of season is closed they didn't go until when it's the right time and the right season you got to move for the things of God Amen we cannot remain in the old and expect new things yeah amen right so what a better than unfruitful woman brings forth a child so what is this a type of this is type of Peter that this woman is now built up into the pyramid because Peter says if these things abide in you that's Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness you'll be neither Barren nor unfruitful amen so this woman has all the virtues now we know she has produced the word son the spoken word son is now standing in manifestation even in your life you can see the Son of God revealed in your life you are a son and daughter of God Amen you can see the life is on display amen amen amen surely amen we have come so far in the message and all of the word we were has produced the sun in our life has produced the image in our life amen amen but now the boys in the field working with the Reapers and you know that the sun strikes him and he says my head and the boy dies you know what happens the woman settles and asks and she goes out to The Prophet where does she go to mount Kama what is Mount Carmel the original place where the hearts of their children were turned back to the faith of their fathers yes so she goes back to the place where her heart was turned back and that's where we are coming back to we are remembering what has turned our hearts back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers because the time has passed by and people have forgotten the Gen truths the hidden mysteries of God that were revealed to us and the power that's associated with those Mysteries because this word has come to release her power and an anointing upon the bride yes we have not had seven Shields revealed to us and seven Church ages and seven trumpets and seven viles and all the Mysteries found in Revelation for us to be ordinary Church going members but we are the supernatural Church of God we are the Invincible Army that's Rising our amen we are the Church of the move that is being led by the angel of God Amen giving praise amen amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen she gets to working amen so what happened she does not want to see the image of Christ that is now in manifestation die yeah don't let that image die yes amen because remember the situation around you will affect you we just labor to show you that let us here is still going on around us and he's trying to kill the man child The Same Spirit that existed in the first Exodus they tried to kill Moses existed in the second Exodus where they tried to kill Jesus existing the Third Exodus where they're trying to kill the Christ in you amen thank you amen that's right you cannot make the word of God lie it's then every type and every shadow amen amen so they're trying to kill the Sun amen but she believes in a resurrection all the while she's making her way to mount Palmer the sun is dead there's no move there's no manifestation look even in your own lives if you are dead if you are barren amen if you have caused Christ to die twice the word to die in your life all the while she's moving to Mount Carmel and the prophet back to the prophet's message the sun is dead but that doesn't deter from going back to the world the prophet says find out where you left him and go back to that place and make it right amen no matter how far gone you are or how far gone other people think God is not finished with you God has no purpose for your life as long as there is breath in your lungs amen God has a purpose for your life and God will not stop until the purpose is finished in your life yes amen say Amen somebody believe the word of God yes you are important to the God Amen you are important to the program and the economy of God in this day in this hour and in this season yes God is depending on you you say I'm depending on God God is depending on you to see the manifestation of the word in this day amen hallelujah so she gets back to the place amen and you know she gets the attention of the prophet and you know that she's bypassing your housing and she tells him all is well amen amen and when she gets to the prophet you know what he does again amen you know that he lays upon the boy mouth upon mouth nose upon nose amen trying to reflect the image back amen get back to the word see her flexion back in the world Amen and what happened it brings the sleeping Sage back to the Earth oh Hallelujah the resurrection of the Dead didn't come in the Days of Elijah but he came under the Elisha Ministry amen and aren't we now living in the days of the bright Ministry where we are expecting to see the resurrection of the dead yes amen amen but before we can see the resurrection of the Dead let us look into God's mirror this morning Amen Let Us come back to the image let's put nose to nose mouth to mouth eye to eye and let it breathe life back into US Amen Let the Holy Ghost be loosed upon you amen receiving the Holy Ghost in This Hour amen thank you Lord let's get away every worldliness let's get away with Ross amen let the Unseen World open up to us amen let us have Angelic visitations back again amen amen let us have an expectation in our hearts amen that yes I can see and entertain angels how did it all start with a little water I need a little bread brought about the supernatural things of God Amen stuck up on your water and your brain get some nice spring water don't go by the Woolworths one now because your spiritual side changing [Music] amen father will do the star water I have doubts about this it could be tap water amen but get back to entertaining strangers be sensitive to the angels of God amen Jesus said in Matthew 10 40. here's our Lord Jesus Christ now who is Jesus I want to I'm looking for three words Jesus is who is Jesus now I'm not looking for that I'm on I want a three-letter word starts with G Jesus is [Music] come on I want you to help the young people because they need to establish these things in their heart who is Jesus Jesus is God Matthew 10 and verse 40. says he that receiveth you receiveth me amen and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give unto these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward are you a disciple of Christ amen amen then give opportunity for people to be kind to you you know the Bible also says that God loves a cheerful Giver but you know sometimes people have a problem with receiving sometimes you give them something no I don't want it no man you take it you'll give it to someone else people have a hard time receiving they're making the person lose their blessing because what did the scripture just say now they won't lose their reward yes amen so be gracious to care but also be gracious to receive amen and say brother I thank you so much I really appreciate it may the Lord bless you amen because you don't know with one heart and what intention that person is giving perhaps the Lord told him to give them to you but you're looking at that 10 grand and you are thinking what am I going to do with this 10 grand give it to somebody else sure but God is checking your heart amen God wants to see what what heart you receive them amen Hallelujah in Matthew 25 and verse 34 Jesus now talking about the kingdom now you really know that Matthew 25 deals with the seventh seal because it's talking about the kingdom because Matthew 24 he preaches all six seals Everybody follow Matthew 24 he preaches all six seals Matthew 25 is dealing with the kingdom and we're going to read from verse 34 where the king is going to say come here blessed of my father he never the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world now watch what our lord Jesus says for I was hungered I was hungry and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick you visit me I was in prison you came to me then shall the rights just answer him and saying Lord when saw we thee and under and fed thee or thirsty and gave the drink when so we be a stranger and took the Inn or naked and lothy or we saw the sequin prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in so much as you've done it unto the least of my brethren you have done it unto me like the Lord Jesus was standing here in flesh how many of you wouldn't want to take him for lunch I don't know why you're laughing I don't have an agenda behind this point how many of you want to take the Lord Jesus for lunch not only for lunch we will tell brother Ramesh you're taking for lunch please do not feed him too much because I'm taking him for supper give him a light lunch right but God is ways and opportunity God provided an opportunity for the Widow to entertain a stranger God provided an opportunity for the shulamite woman to entertain a stranger God provided the opportunity for Abraham to entertain a stranger but it happened to be not ordinary people amen then you know the the Lord if you read the rest of the verse the Lord does that in Reverse now and he tells them those that didn't visit him and didn't feed him he says you've done it unto me right what are we doing we are looking for his presence and to entertain his presence because when we entertain his presence it releases the Unseen World a supernatural world amen let me break it down for those of you that didn't get it the Supernatural is not only unlocked in the prayer line or in a religious setting yeah in a religious service that's the underlying senior it's happening in your in a natural daily life amen these people are entertaining strangers and in an unlocked Supernatural world today unlock Supernatural experiences to them so the woman received the healing of the son by being kind by entertaining the word look at the woman who came and washed Jesus feet when they didn't want to entertain him in Simon's house she caught the opportunity to entertain Jesus and wash his feet awake they didn't even want to give it a waiter's job to bring the food to Jesus she found the lowest of jobs and she went to washing his feet to what length are we willing to go to accommodate Jesus and to make sure he is comfortable in our homes and in our presence are we willing to take the lowest of jobs or do we always want to be seated in a restaurant he's not always going to have a Zacchaeus moment where are you going to have a feast and you got any abundance and you're going to give back to the poor he's going to provide like Mary now an opportunity for you to wash feet to become low to become humble amen amen Hallelujah we can go through many more scriptures amen let's just find I'm going to close it now because I feel the spirit is right you got the message amen I this I've only touched the introduction part because that was teaching us how to entertain strangers and showing you how the supernatural can be unlocked through the physical but maybe that's where we need to stop and we can go into the other thing some other time amen but maybe we can just read something else right let's read I will go to slide six amen the prophet here says and this is why we emphasize the revelation of the word we must have a revelation of the word yes right he says when you receive the revelation of the word something slips out of the Unseen World Yonder and comes rolling down through a mystical Channel some way into your soul that says now I see your eyes brighten your lips are hung down straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to Rejoice amen so watch what the association of the world can do right let's go to the next one he says Angelic beings associate together and I hope you get that that just dropped right down free what is he telling you that's first revelation he says if you've got the holy spirit in you you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural amen amen when you when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes a twofold being one of the year to die one of the able to live in this body is subject to death but in his soul is passed from Vietnam to life in his body he has Earthly contact with his five senses but in his Spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visit them speaks with them and they are messengers from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual amen angels are coming bringing messages to us amen he says if a boy is knocking at your door and he's got a telegram for you he would be a messenger or an ugly angel right he says your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave that word and stay straight with the word because he's feeding the shepherd's place the word pastor means Shepherd look it up find if it ain't right a posse the shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock feed them with what the word of God Amen let's just leave it right there amen Give the Lord a good answer for praise [Applause] so God can use natural situations and I really was rejoicing with that part where even Elijah was subject to the entire conditions his own word brought judgment upon the land and I indict this generation who said that amen the end time prophet so we are all subjected to that the curse is upon the land you can put me or you as every president in the country in every country take a message believe and place them in every position make them a president of every country it will still not change end time prophecy this world must be destroyed amen Bible scripture must come to pass amen amen not even we can stop the judgments of God that are coming upon the Earth but I want you to know there's a prophecy given to you that God will see you through this time amen keep trusting God keep serving God church God loves you amen God is concerned for you amen and God will never leave you nor forsake you amen I want you to know if you've left the Lord if you wandered away from the Lord maybe you try to do
