[5:58] area of our lives in fact we are seeing
[6:00] it in everything we look at
[6:03] amen
[6:06] some things we don't even tell you but
[6:09] because it's too much
[6:11] it seems fabricated amen it seems like
[6:15] we are making it up but the angel of the
[6:16] Lord is so present in every detail of
[6:18] Our Lives amen amen and we when we are
[6:22] seeing him we are saying Lord truly you
[6:24] are in the midst of us
[6:26] amen he is right here in the midst of us
[6:28] and I urge you not to miss the move of
[6:31] God I urge you not to move the letter in
[6:35] amen because when he is outpouring
[6:37] himself remember this is the last
[6:39] outpouring yes amen for the Gentiles
[6:43] amen and then it's going to move over to
[6:45] Moses and Elijah
[6:47] amen is going to move over to Revelation
[6:49] 11. so while he is outpouring now catch
[6:52] it in the season
[6:54] amen
[6:56] just want to start there from verse 20
[6:57] and I want to type it there with Exodus
[7:00] 23 and show you in Joel chapter 2 verse
[7:02] 20 he says behold I will remove far
[7:06] off from you the northern Army and will
[7:08] drive him into the Bland Barren desolate
[7:11] with his face towards the EC and his eye
[7:14] under part toward the utmost sea and his
[7:17] thing shall come up the Lord is saying
[7:18] he's going to slay your enemies
[7:20] and look what he says in Exodus 23 23 as
[7:23] contrast for my angel shall go before
[7:26] thee and bring thee unto the amorites
[7:28] the intights the parasites and the
[7:30] Canaanites the Evite jebusites and I'm
[7:34] going to say this even now even all your
[7:36] porn sites
[7:39] and I will cut them off
[7:42] Spirit knows why he's saying that
[7:44] amen and I will cut them off
[7:47] but watch out contrast Joe 20 is going
[7:51] to remove them
[7:52] with the northern Army
[7:55] why the northern Army
[7:58] didn't he say he's going to ascend
[8:01] amen and sit on the sides of the North
[8:05] yes you know what I'm talking about
[8:06] Satan said I will I will sit upon the
[8:08] sides of the north upon the congregation
[8:10] of the people he's talking about Mount
[8:13] Zion
[8:14] amen sides of the north so God is saying
[8:17] I'm going to remove that Northern Army
[8:20] God is going to kill them who's doing
[8:22] this the angel of the Lord amen amen he
[8:26] is the one that is going before you now
[8:28] he's not only just walking
[8:30] supernaturally and spiritually it
[8:34] like yeah I'm talking about universally
[8:36] in the church but is working in your
[8:38] individual lives as much as you are
[8:40] seeing your progression and a rapid
[8:42] progression in scripture and in
[8:43] Revelation of Prophecy coming forth you
[8:46] are seeing rapid progression in your own
[8:48] life
[8:50] amen what would make the angel of the
[8:52] Lord come personally to you
[8:54] and not only the angel of the Lord but
[8:56] the host of angels amen
[8:58] sometimes it may not be the angel of the
[9:00] Lord but they are angels and kept around
[9:02] you amen amen
[9:05] Hallelujah
[9:07] Joe 2 and 21 to 22 says fear not o land
[9:12] be glad and rejoice now watch what this
[9:14] is doing this is taking Romans 8.
[9:17] because he's speaking to the land he's
[9:19] speaking to the Beast and he's speaking
[9:22] to all nature and creation talking about
[9:24] trees
[9:26] doesn't Romans 8 say that all creation
[9:29] is groaning prevailing and waiting in
[9:32] pain together until now
[9:36] what are they waiting for the earnest
[9:38] expectation of the creature is waiting
[9:41] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[9:43] Amen this is it now amen you are
[9:46] manifesting that you are a silent
[9:48] daughter of God Amen you have the
[9:51] teaching Reign all these years
[9:53] amen the teaching Reign was important to
[9:56] build us up amen if we hadn't had the
[9:59] opening of the seals the opening of the
[10:01] word amen we would be like a
[10:03] denomination with no revelation of the
[10:05] world but we thank God for the teaching
[10:08] that came amen amen
[10:11] he says fear not all land
[10:13] look how he's talking to creation Now be
[10:16] glad and rejoice for the Lord will do
[10:18] great things be not afraid he beast of
[10:22] the field for the pastors of the
[10:24] Wilderness to spring for the three
[10:26] bearable fruit now watch the trees
[10:28] bearing true fruit catches Revelation
[10:30] the fig tree
[10:34] is who
[10:36] is the fig tree
[10:38] oh come on students of the world you
[10:40] have the more rain you had the more rain
[10:42] now we are moving in the outpouring of
[10:44] the spirit in order to Quicken that word
[10:46] who is the Fig Tree when the Fig Tree
[10:48] puts for the bad amen it's Israel but
[10:51] what she's talking about for the tree
[10:53] bear with her fruit the Victory and the
[10:56] Vine I am the vine you are the branches
[10:59] two trees a fig tree and a vine
[11:03] they do heal their strength amen this
[11:07] bride has got strength in this hour amen
[11:10] amen hallelujah and you can see how
[11:13] perfectly those two scriptures fall in
[11:15] line and thereafter you know comes Joe 2
[11:17] 23 talking about the former and the
[11:20] letter A coming in the first month
[11:24] amen
[11:27] now there's a lap of a period if you
[11:29] know
[11:31] brother Brandon talks about a lap of a
[11:33] period between each age yes
[11:36] amen how each age fell in continuity one
[11:40] to the other
[11:43] and he says there is also going to be a
[11:46] leftover period from us to Moses and
[11:48] Elijah
[11:49] amen so yeah he goes into detail to tell
[11:53] you how
[11:55] the Luther and he calls the rain right
[11:58] talking about latter rain later rain
[11:59] didn't only fall now every outpouring of
[12:02] the spirit was a move of God Amen amen
[12:05] remember Luther himself did not
[12:07] denominate
[12:09] blur the hell through to the spirit of
[12:11] God Wesley are true to the spirit of God
[12:14] it was the people after him
[12:17] then walk to a certain period of time
[12:20] then they denominated around that idea
[12:22] amen so the rain is always falling
[12:26] or catch this the rain is always falling
[12:30] amen
[12:32] so if you've got this seed
[12:34] outside and it needs sunlight remember a
[12:37] seed needs sunlight it needs the right
[12:39] amount of moisture
[12:41] not right amount of rain
[12:45] but if you see shoots coming out and the
[12:48] plants grow out of here and you think
[12:50] that's sufficient and you take it and
[12:52] you put it inside your house you may get
[12:54] an indoor plant it's no longer in the
[12:57] right environment where the rain is
[12:58] falling where the sunlight is falling so
[13:01] what's going to happen that's going to
[13:03] have Central growth yes
[13:05] so that's what happened to the Lutheran
[13:07] if the lutherans had progressed they
[13:10] would have gone into Wesley's message
[13:12] amen justification would have become
[13:14] sanctification because it was another
[13:17] move of the spirit of God but when they
[13:19] denominated God left the lutherans and
[13:22] he raised up Wesley
[13:25] amen
[13:26] after he raised up Wesley we know amen
[13:29] the the sanctification message came
[13:31] about and the Nazarene message came
[13:33] about amen but then
[13:36] there was a cry from the people
[13:38] we're going to that just now let's just
[13:41] see how the prophet dramatizes us he
[13:43] says each one became a lettering to the
[13:46] other
[13:47] Luna was a letter Reign to the Catholics
[13:51] so the Catholics Harry reign but Luther
[13:55] was the letter reigned to the Catholics
[13:59] and John Wesley was a letter Reign to
[14:01] Luther
[14:03] are you following catching that
[14:05] Revolution now the Pentecost was a
[14:07] letter into the denomination and the
[14:10] Pentecostals are organized now what's
[14:12] going to happen
[14:14] and watch he says c c what is he
[14:18] expecting you to say if you're following
[14:20] the continuity of it he's expecting you
[14:22] to say there's going to come another
[14:23] latter rain
[14:26] just to confirm this in another message
[14:28] he says the loser was a lettering to the
[14:31] Catholic the Baptist was a lateral went
[14:33] to Luther the Methodist was a letter
[14:35] range to them the Pentecostals was a
[14:38] letter into the nazarenes lettering
[14:40] lettering what is it and this is where I
[14:43] want to drive a point right now when the
[14:45] church gets organized
[14:47] are we the true church amen
[14:50] amen when the true church gets organized
[14:52] and sit down home
[14:58] let's just stay home and press play
[14:59] please
[15:00] when the church gets organized and sit
[15:03] down home and just a big bunch of cold
[15:06] statues
[15:08] then the Holy Ghost moves out and starts
[15:12] a lot to rain
[15:15] yes
[15:17] oh Hallelujah
[15:19] I can blast it right there amen but you
[15:22] get what I'm saying you know amen
[15:24] hallelujah help us never to become dead
[15:27] cold statues amen May the message Church
[15:30] always move with the spirit of God may
[15:32] we never denominate amen
[15:35] amen amen
[15:37] but if you look around with spiritual
[15:39] eyes is that's not what's happening is
[15:42] that not what the spirit is crying out
[15:44] against amen amen people have
[15:47] denominated and they don't even know it
[15:49] yeah why don't they know it because it's
[15:51] deception you tell me lutherans knew
[15:54] that they denominated and the spirit
[15:55] left them right until now they'll tell
[15:57] you the spirit of God is with them and
[15:59] you need to join the Lutheran Church so
[16:01] did the Wesleyan Church the Methodist
[16:03] Church that'll tell you it's through
[16:05] their Church
[16:06] oh is it become that way amongst us
[16:10] that we are saying amen it's only here
[16:13] but the spirit will move he says when
[16:15] they become big bunch of cold statues
[16:18] the Holy Ghost moves out and starts a
[16:20] lettering
[16:23] that's why I say this is the lettering
[16:25] of Brandon's message
[16:26] amen we are not going crazy
[16:29] amen if you call us crazy then call US
[16:32] odd balls amen because we are moving
[16:34] with the spirit of God
[16:38] amen
[16:41] now when we move with the spirit of God
[16:43] we have a testimony amen
[16:45] amen amen we've got something to say
[16:47] Amen amen the letter rain didn't come
[16:49] amen for us to keep quiet the latter
[16:52] rain ties in amen perfectly with
[16:54] Revelation 10 11 that there's a people
[16:57] going forth to prophesy the spirit won't
[17:00] fall for you to be entertained and
[17:02] watching manifest in your life
[17:04] [Applause]
[17:06] is to empower you with the Holy Ghost
[17:11] amen watch what he's gone back to now
[17:15] didn't we start me off with your life
[17:18] your prayer life
[17:19] amen you're alone time with God your
[17:22] consecration because that's where true
[17:25] power lies
[17:28] amen it's not in the public amen that
[17:31] God's suddenly going to anoint you no
[17:33] these kind of things come with
[17:34] consecration these things come amen with
[17:36] a lot of time with God Amen
[17:39] any anointed man any Gifted Man any man
[17:43] has an alone time with God
[17:46] thank you we don't just come out here
[17:48] professing and speaking things amen
[17:51] neither do we commit all our times to
[17:53] just studying the word
[17:56] but there's a consecration
[17:58] there's a prayer yes there's a devotion
[18:01] time amen Lord speak to me amen amen
[18:04] Lord amen reveal yourself to me yes
[18:07] sometimes we just need to shut up in his
[18:09] presence amen and let the Holy Spirit
[18:12] Come and minister to us amen
[18:16] amen
[18:18] thank you now what we said your life
[18:20] your life is speaking volumes right now
[18:25] hear what he says your life will shine a
[18:28] lot louder than your testimony you could
[18:30] ever give
[18:32] your life is so loud too the people
[18:34] don't even understand your testimony
[18:38] and right now a lot of people won't
[18:41] where he says it's where that's where
[18:44] sincerity and sacredness
[18:48] remember now the prophet said the angel
[18:50] told the prophet if you are sincere in
[18:52] your heart
[18:54] you get the people to believe you and
[18:56] you are sincere
[18:58] you remember the time he was funneling
[19:00] that shoelaces he had that vision
[19:03] the two pools
[19:04] and the Lord told me you need to be more
[19:06] sincere
[19:10] now what he says here he says if five
[19:14] good people
[19:15] really filled with his spirit
[19:18] now I didn't put that word I didn't
[19:19] change the word I just highlighted the
[19:21] word
[19:23] but where are you sitting tonight amen
[19:26] he says if five good people really
[19:29] filled with the spirit will do more in
[19:31] Phoenix than all the members we got
[19:35] the first five bands will receive it
[19:38] amen amen
[19:41] five good people
[19:44] really filled with the spirit will do
[19:47] more in Phoenix and all the members we
[19:48] got if they consecrated to God
[19:52] what it goes down to consecration
[19:55] not if they go out being boisterous and
[19:57] tell them we are the people of the hour
[19:59] no if we are consecrated to God in a
[20:03] sincere life

[20:07] through there and vindicate that to be
[20:10] truth

[20:42] for you to believe that a simple humble
[20:44] person like you God will be walking
[20:46] through right now
[20:47] yes amen but you gotta pinch yourself
[20:50] and tell yourself you better believe it

[21:07] things are happening are things
[21:09] happening amen and he says you can't
[21:11] hold it down

[22:58] double portion or are you in the Elijah
[23:01] of the hour

[23:50] you and I speak life into that situation
[23:52] I don't care what area of your life it
[23:55] is you speak life into it thank you Lord
[23:59] slay every enemy amen Satan will come

[24:08] of God and you don't give in to the
[24:10] enemy you don't give it to deception
[24:12] amen you stand true to the word of God
[24:15] in this hour
[24:16] don't compromise one bit amen the
[24:19] opening of the word came amen so that we
[24:21] can have revelation of the world that
[24:23] this evil not be deceived
[24:25] amen yes thank you amen you know what
[24:28] the prophet says you think things stop
[24:30] when he went away he even prophesied in
[24:32] the word and he said look here he says
[24:34] when I'm gone away from here is he gone
[24:36] away yeah
[24:38] is the prophet gone away
[24:42] so this quote is actually literal now
[24:44] when I'm gone away Jesus will be here
[24:48] just the same as he is when I'm here
[24:51] oh people want to stifle him people want
[24:54] to put cause upon Him amen but Samson
[24:57] will break free amen because Samson is
[25:00] regrowing amen Samson's hair is
[25:03] regrowing amen wine amen stimulation of
[25:06] Revelation he's striking the people in
[25:08] this hour he says he will be here to
[25:10] heal the sick to do just the same things
[25:13] that he could do at any time amen you
[25:16] put limitations of God I say take the
[25:18] limitations off of God this evening amen

[25:53] you can hear me in that sixth Dimension
[25:55] Jesus is here just the same amen yes
[25:58] amen amen
[26:00] but the problem says sometimes you got
[26:02] to know how to apply the scriptures
[26:04] because when you pray the scriptures
[26:06] amen there is power in those scriptures
[26:08] amen yes and when you say back God's
[26:11] word to him watch him coming on the
[26:13] scene there's my son there's my daughter
[26:16] taking me at my word I'm going down to
[26:19] back them up

[26:24] shock heaven will even shake heaven
[26:28] that they've got to come in on the scene
[26:29] amen
[26:32] amen hallelujah
[26:36] amen
[26:39] oh it's you know when the prophet says
[26:41] you have the power to operate the gifts
[26:43] on the pulpit
[26:45] I've seen that amen I shared the
[26:47] testimony with the brothers here in the
[26:48] Easter convention
[26:51] power to operate the gift
[26:54] to meet the need of the people yeah
[26:57] I won't share it with all of you because
[26:59] sometimes it'll be too long
[27:01] too hard for you to swallow
[27:03] amen but the brothers I did shared with
[27:05] they caught it like that
[27:08] because if you can command
[27:10] he says
[27:13] things you're bind on Earth will be
[27:15] bound in here yes amen amen so what
[27:18] about things you lose will be loosed in
[27:20] heaven

[27:34] your Authority yes and you're making
[27:36] creation grown that's why it is
[27:38] earthquakes

[28:06] God and then we are not dedicated to the
[28:09] things of God
[28:11] Liars are coming in the message of the
[28:13] hour we have the opening of the word
[28:16] and we don't need these basic things

[29:13] iniquities the chastisement of these my
[29:17] peace was upon him and by his stripes

[29:58] Cockroaches will run away

[30:18] and penetrate the darkness

[35:10] John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3. he
[35:13] planted the former Reign and was
[35:15] rejected by organizations of his day
[35:17] then Jesus came and he had a mount
[35:20] Transfiguration Showdown
[35:22] amen
[35:24] the second Forerunner of Christ was so
[35:27] for the latter rain
[35:30] Jesus will be the showdown between
[35:32] denominations and Creeds for he will
[35:34] come to back up his word and take the
[35:38] bride in erection
[35:40] what's he coming to do back up his word
[35:43] therefore always like I just said
[35:47] recite the word of God catch him you
[35:49] promised in your word
[35:51] I challenge God that way I tell him
[35:53] either you are Hebrews 13 8 or you are

[36:11] they can go ahead and do it now
[36:15] amen hallelujah
[36:22] amen
[36:23] the first Showdown is man Kama second
[36:26] was Mount Transfiguration and the third
[36:28] will be Mount Zion
[36:31] now I just want them to switch amen
[36:47] now I know that
[36:49] Mount Carmel was a physical Mountain
[36:51] [Music]
[36:53] Transfiguration was a physical Mountain
[36:57] but the events that happened on each
[36:58] Mountain
[37:00] but Mount Zion is not a physical
[37:02] Mountain
[37:07] are you getting there
[37:09] Mount Zion is you
[37:12] you are Mount Zion
[37:14] and The Showdown will be in you amen
[37:17] you will produce The Showdown
[37:20] why is Christ in me
[37:25] amen or is it just saying that we know
[37:29] in the message all that was in God he
[37:31] poured into Christ
[37:34] and all that was in Christ he poured
[37:36] into the church
[37:37] so if he is being poured into the church
[37:39] who is in you
[37:41] it's Christ in me the hope of glory amen
[37:47] amen we have limited him for too long
[37:49] yes
[37:50] we have put the stoppers on him for too
[37:53] long because later Sia has us enticed
[37:56] you know his latest here Delilah
[37:58] she puts you on a lap and strokes your
[38:00] hair
[38:02] oh my beloved tell me your secret to
[38:05] your power
[38:07] leducia is deceiving you Whispering
[38:09] Whispering trying to put you into Allah
[38:15] amen the third will be
[38:19] me
[38:20] that's the right way to read it
[38:22] the first showdown of Mount Carmel say
[38:25] it with me
[38:26] the second showdown of man's
[38:28] Transfiguration and the third world
[38:31] me
[38:35] amen
[38:38] as the evil one deceived the first two
[38:41] Brides he will try to deceive the Bride
[38:43] of this last day by trying to hybridize
[38:46] herself through creeds
[38:48] or just plainly turning from the word to
[38:50] any sign that suits her but God never
[38:53] placed signs ahead of the word
[38:55] oh I'm so glad that we followed the
[38:57] continuity of it amen
[39:02] because we went up to the word first
[39:07] amen and now that we are the world made
[39:09] flesh
[39:11] we can't help it we can't manufacture it
[39:14] but science follow the believer
[39:18] amen
[39:19] God never placed signs ahead of the word
[39:22] science follow the word
[39:24] that's why in this church we establish
[39:27] the word of God it's the word first amen
[39:30] hallelujah
[39:32] but when the Dynamics strike that word
[39:34] it produces the signs
[39:38] I'm sorry if you get upset that signs
[39:40] are following us I'm sorry if you get
[39:42] upset that the Holy Spirit still pours
[39:45] himself out and manifest himself out in
[39:48] whichever way he pleases to do amen
[39:51] but it's not our doing it's the Holy
[39:53] Spirit watching
[39:55] look what he says here as when Elijah
[39:58] told a woman to bake a cake for him
[40:00] first according to the word of the Lord
[40:03] when she did as the word said the proper
[40:06] sign came
[40:07] I'm telling you this is the proper sign
[40:09] amen amen amen believe it or not this is
[40:12] the prophesying
[40:14] amen
[40:16] come to the word first then watch the
[40:19] miracle
[40:20] the seed word is energized by the spirit
[40:23] there's it right there mechanics and
[40:25] Dynamics
[40:26] it's in continuity the seed word is
[40:30] energized by the spirit amen
[40:34] amen
[40:36] he says the age started just at the turn
[40:39] of the 20th century we're now in the
[40:41] 21st century for those of you don't know
[40:44] as it was to be the age in which the
[40:47] true church
[40:49] oh
[40:50] we gotta hide this quote from some
[40:52] people brother Joshua
[40:54] they don't believe this
[40:56] the prophet says as it was to be the age
[40:59] he's saying this is the age that the
[41:01] true church would return to being the
[41:03] bride she was at Pentecost
[41:06] amen
[41:07] now anyone who says anything else
[41:10] is contrary to the message of the hour
[41:14] the true church were returning to being
[41:17] the bride she was at Pentecost we know
[41:19] that there must of necessity be a
[41:22] returning of dynamic power amen
[41:26] amen
[41:28] amen
[41:30] now watch
[41:31] 2023 the Believers here since this in
[41:35] their spirit and there was a cry yeah
[41:38] the believer sends this in their spirit
[41:40] and began crying to God for a new
[41:42] outpouring such as there was in the
[41:45] first century is that not what happened
[41:47] here the believer started crying out for
[41:49] a fresh outpouring of his spirit
[41:52] hmm
[41:55] it says what seemed to be the answer
[41:57] came as many began to speak in tongues
[42:00] and manifest gifts of the Spirit he's
[42:02] talking about Pentecost now Azusa Street
[42:04] right he's saying it was then believed
[42:07] that this was indeed the long-awaited
[42:10] restoration it was not
[42:12] for the lettering can only come can come
[42:16] only after the former rain
[42:19] which is the spring teaching reign
[42:22] oh he's got a day in 1200 messages

[42:29] anytime you want to be Shout with that
[42:31] rain just put on one of those messages

[43:08] the latter rain then
[43:10] is the hour stream
[43:12] when is Harvest Time when the fruit
[43:16] is now on the tree
[43:18] you remember he said the messenger was
[43:20] so
[43:21] for the lettering what is sold you're
[43:24] seeing fruits right now
[43:26] I am a fruit of the message of the hour
[43:28] you are a fruit of the message of the
[43:30] hour amen why did it take 60 years amen
[43:34] it takes a period of time for something
[43:36] to come to maturity amen it takes a
[43:38] period of time for the Lord to sort out
[43:40] all our nonsense in our lives amen and
[43:42] bring us to True maturity of the world
[43:46] take away all the unbelief
[43:49] and sometimes we can't you know like a
[43:52] baby
[43:53] we have baby food then we go to the next
[43:56] stage and the next stage and the next
[43:57] stage Revelation upon revelation
[44:01] until the old book is opened before our
[44:03] wandering eyes

[44:19] he says the people of God are being made
[44:21] ready by the word of truth from the
[44:23] messenger to the sage

[44:32] the fullness of Pentecost
[44:35] amen
[44:37] in her amen will be the fullness of
[44:40] Pentecost
[44:41] that's why I I'm not standing here to be
[44:44] crazy or to be different
[44:46] when I told you that Philip amen was
[44:49] transported and it can happen now again
[44:51] yes amen whatever you see my shadow
[44:54] passing by people can heal the sick

[45:16] amen I'm a demanding child
[45:20] amen when I go to the shop of the word
[45:22] of God I want that amen
[45:25] yes and sometimes I cry until I get it
[45:30] amen
[45:32] some of you are very good children you
[45:34] don't know what I'm talking about
[45:37] hey every time I go home science tells

[45:53] will be what you want
[45:57] it's bad to spend my money
[46:01] and sometimes she wants the minimal
[46:03] stuff
[46:04] amen but then when she wants something
[46:07] I'll overdo it with her because she's
[46:09] that kind of a child amen
[46:12] Hallelujah I don't want to say anything

[46:25] pentagon

[46:41] the fullness of Pentecost will be in you
[46:43] the spirit will bring the people right
[46:46] back to where they were at the beginning
[46:51] who's doing this brother Jeff with us
[46:54] the spirit is driving us back
[46:55] [Music]
[46:57] the spirit will bring the people right
[46:59] back to where they were at the beginning
[47:01] and watch how he caps it this is thus
[47:05] said the Lord
[47:11] to me
[47:14] you see I can't handle Dynamic power you
[47:17] are made to handle Dynamic power you
[47:19] were designed to handle Dynamic power of
[47:21] the Holy Ghost
[47:23] you are equipped and kept aside for this
[47:25] age
[47:26] when Joe prophesied back there he was
[47:29] speaking about you
[47:33] I know that's hard for you to believe
[47:37] God isn't
[47:39] you know the prophet is so I just got to
[47:42] read it God isn't going to plant a new
[47:45] church
[47:46] but it's going to bring the original
[47:48] planting back to original sea
[47:53] is this verse popping up again he is
[47:56] doing it as stated in verse 23.
[47:59] by teaching or former rain next will
[48:02] come the Harvest rain or rapturing faith
[48:07] what do you say
[48:09] the teaching Reign the prophet is
[48:10] sorting all of that out
[48:12] because when that seventh angel sounds
[48:15] the Mysteries will be revealed
[48:18] he retired all the Loose Ends
[48:21] he will bring that that open book that
[48:23] came down from the Angels Amen in the
[48:25] Angel's hand he would reveal the seals
[48:29] trumpets vials founders
[48:32] reveal all of it
[48:35] but it's going to produce Albus reign
[48:38] for rapturing faith
[48:40] [Music]
[48:46] yeah the prophet goes on to talk about
[48:48] Balaam now
[48:50] no one denies that the spirit of God
[48:53] manifesting in gifts is upon them
[48:58] but like Balaam they all have their
[49:00] programs
[49:04] amen
[49:06] you say they are gifted preachers that's
[49:07] what the prophet is talking about here
[49:10] he says but they have gifts you no one
[49:12] he says no one denied that the spirit of
[49:14] God is manifesting in them
[49:16] he says but they are like Balaam
[49:19] they have their programs
[49:21] make the appeal for money exercise gifts
[49:24] but they deny the word
[49:26] or bypass it
[49:28] that's what we are finding now they are
[49:31] bypassing it for fear that a controversy
[49:34] might diminish their chances for greater
[49:36] gain
[49:38] amen
[49:42] who touched on Balaam a bit now he says
[49:44] all that there will be a true former and
[49:47] lettering in the last days upon that
[49:50] little group
[49:54] Church your reading prophecy and you're
[49:56] seeing now the manifestation of it
[49:59] he said there will be a true former and
[50:01] lettering in the last days upon that
[50:04] little group that come with him on this
[50:07] little donkey low and humble no
[50:09] denomination crying Hosanna to the king
[50:12] that comes in the name of the Lord
[50:13] what's the matter what's the attraction
[50:17] on this mountain Mount Zion
[50:21] what's the attraction on Mount Zion
[50:24] what was the attraction on Mount Karma
[50:26] God came down
[50:28] what's the attraction on Mount
[50:30] Transfiguration God came down
[50:33] transfigured Jesus in a glorified body
[50:36] what's the attraction now in you and me
[50:38] amen
[50:40] amen he has a you want deep stuff Christ
[50:45] in the bride amen
[50:46] Christ in bright form
[50:49] too hard to swallow
[50:53] amen take away your false teeth and chew
[50:56] on that steak
[50:58] you are Christ in bright form yes
[51:01] you are the feminine part
[51:03] that he left to be manifest in this hour
[51:05] and in this day amen
[51:08] amen

[51:20] up the story

[51:23] Numbers Chapter 22. you'll read the
[51:26] story then
[51:28] and who was this person that were dead
[51:31] raise up a man called balak
[51:35] raise up to curse God's people

[51:41] nobody can stop your anointing
[51:43] man amen nobody can stop your gifting
[51:47] amen no matter how much of opposition
[51:50] you face no one can stop it if God calls
[51:54] you he is going to protect you and watch

[51:59] amen nobody can stifle you
[52:03] thank you
[52:04] you will rise up to be all that God has
[52:06] promised you to be in this hour
[52:09] amen Hallelujah and what did he say
[52:12] you're a double portion anointed people

[52:22] you must go to Genesis if you want to
[52:24] pick up who this
[52:25] fellow us
[52:27] amen I'll tell you I don't want to go
[52:29] into all of it now let me tell you
[52:30] quickly this was Moab
[52:33] but who's Moab
[52:35] Moab is a lot
[52:38] oh come on now yes it's not reproduced
[52:45] and who are the children of Israel
[52:47] Abraham's seed reproduced
[52:51] so a lot
[52:53] the one who Abraham went after
[52:56] the one we pleaded to the angels to have
[52:59] mercy on them
[53:01] now dear stand
[53:05] and want to speak against Abraham's seed
[53:07] do you see it yes so the conflict that
[53:10] they had there where they separated
[53:12] remember the husband and conflict didn't
[53:16] end it they just separated for a season
[53:20] but when did the children of Israel are
[53:22] coming back into the land or catch it
[53:24] now because the Bible tells you in
[53:26] Numbers 22 that the people were kept in
[53:28] the land they were there in Jericho
[53:31] are we back in the land of the Holy
[53:32] Ghost watch baelic arise now and try to
[53:36] produce Balaam in this hour

[53:44] amen oh Hallelujah this is an
[53:46] inspiration for a whole nother service
[53:48] amen hallelujah but here they are
[53:51] calling Balaam
[53:54] foreign
[53:57] telling he's afraid now that these
[54:00] children of Israel are going to
[54:01] overpower him and his territory
[54:04] but if he only told them they knew his
[54:06] identity they would have known his
[54:08] Abraham's nephew
[54:13] amen wouldn't he have known this is
[54:15] Abraham's nephew and if you're going to
[54:17] read the Genesis of that story go read
[54:20] Genesis when Abraham when Lord flees saw
[54:23] them
[54:24] and he goes on the mountain and he's
[54:26] drunk
[54:27] remember Lord there's no seed
[54:30] there is no seed promised to Lord yes
[54:33] even though he didn't have a son God
[54:35] didn't appear to lot to tell him that
[54:38] you shall have a seat and your seed will
[54:41] who did that
[54:42] his two daughters
[54:46] trying to produce seed
[54:49] they were doing goddess service without
[54:51] it being his will
[54:54] you know what happened in Genesis
[54:57] they live with their father and they
[54:59] produce the tribe of Moab yes
[55:01] these are the same people that's
[55:03] standing there want to curse the
[55:04] children of Israel
[55:08] so not all the people you intercede for
[55:10] risk your life
[55:13] Abraham risked his life and took on five
[55:16] Kings and the armies
[55:18] to rescue lot
[55:23] amen not everyone you intercede for
[55:27] and walk with
[55:30] yes we'll be standing with you all right
[55:33] there'll come a point in life where they
[55:35] will rise up against you and they'll
[55:38] want to curse God's people
[55:40] but God won't allow it
[55:43] amen Exodus 23 23 says behold I send my
[55:47] angel before thee that same engine was
[55:50] still there in numbers 22.
[55:54] these people were walking carnal
[55:57] didn't have vision
[56:01] familiar story about bail and writing in

[56:23] to pray
[56:25] children of Israel okay I'm sorry sorry
[56:27] I just want to tell you which verse to
[56:29] start from right
[56:36] let's start
[56:50] let's start from verse 18. you know now
[56:52] Baylor calls Balaam
[56:54] Bala calls Balaam and tells him to come
[56:56] and curse the people so you'll read now
[56:58] from verse 18.
[57:00] what Balaam answers them
[57:03] answer is
[57:10] liquid full of
[57:12] sin cannot go beyond the word of the
[57:15] Lord my God to do less or more
[57:18] now therefore I pray you tell me ye also
[57:22] hear this life that I may know what the
[57:25] Lord will say unto me more
[57:28] and God came on to Baylor at night and
[57:32] said unto him if the men come to call
[57:35] thee rise up and go with them but yet
[57:39] the word which I shall say unto thee
[57:42] that shout thou do
[57:45] and belum Rose up in the morning
[57:48] and settled his ass
[57:50] and went to the princes of poem
[57:53] and God's anger was kindled because he
[57:56] went and the angel of the Lord stood in
[57:59] the way for an adversary against him
[58:02] now he was riding upon his ass and his
[58:06] two servants Within
[58:07] and the Earth saw the angel of the Lord
[58:10] what verse is that
[58:13] why Sunday in verse 23
[58:17] amen the angel of the Lord becomes
[58:19] visible
[58:23] amen this entire chapter remember even
[58:26] in verse 22 that is
[58:29] God now giving you the account right
[58:32] but in the natural when it's happening
[58:34] nobody knows that the angel of God is
[58:35] dead suddenly towards 23 comes around
[58:39] and even the donkey sees the angel of
[58:41] the Lord
[58:43] yes amen I tell you even the donkeys
[58:46] will see the angel of the Lord in this
[58:47] hour
[58:49] amen
[58:52] read again Amen brother named 23 I had
[58:56] to stop you there because some didn't
[58:57] catch the 23rd verse there
[58:59] and the Earth saw the evil of the Lord
[59:02] standing in the way and he swore thrawn
[59:06] in his hand
[59:08] and the Earth turned the side out of the
[59:10] way
[59:11] and went into the field
[59:13] and they even smoothed their ass to turn
[59:16] her into the way
[59:18] but the angel of the Lord stood in a
[59:20] part of The Vineyards
[59:22] a wall being on his on this side and a
[59:25] wall on that side
[59:27] and when the ass saw the angel of the
[59:30] Lord
[59:31] trust the self
[59:33] unto the world and crash balance food
[59:36] against the wall and it's water again
[59:40] and the angel of the Lord went further
[59:42] and stood in a narrow place
[59:45] where was no way to turn either to the
[59:48] right hand or to the left
[59:51] and when the earth saw the angel of the
[59:53] Lord
[59:54] he fell down on the balance and balance
[59:58] anger was killed and he smoothed the ass
[1:00:00] with their stuff
[1:00:02] and the angel and the Lord opened the
[1:00:05] mouth of the Earth
[1:00:07] and she said unto Villa
[1:00:09] whatever I done unto thee
[1:00:11] and thou has smitten me
[1:00:14] these three times
[1:00:15] and balance it
[1:00:17] and Balaam said unto their ass
[1:00:21] because thou has smoked me
[1:00:23] I would dare wear a sword in mine and
[1:00:27] for now would I kill thee and the
[1:00:30] answered unto bill
[1:00:32] and not either
[1:00:34] and not and not are than as
[1:00:38] upon which Tau has written
[1:00:40] ever since I was there until this day
[1:00:43] was I ever want to do so and to be and
[1:00:47] he said name then the Lord opened the
[1:00:50] eyes of David and he saw the angel of
[1:00:53] the Lord standing away and his sword
[1:00:56] drawn in his head and he bowed down his
[1:00:58] head and fell flat on his face
[1:01:01] and the angel of the Lord said unto him
[1:01:04] wherefore as thou smitten down as these
[1:01:07] three times behold I went out to be to
[1:01:11] withstanding
[1:01:12] because thy way is perverse before me
[1:01:16] and the Earth saw me and turned from me
[1:01:19] these three times
[1:01:21] unless he has turned from me surely now
[1:01:24] also I have slain thee and saved Airline
[1:01:28] alive
[1:01:29] and William said unto the angel of the
[1:01:31] Lord I have sinned for I knew not that
[1:01:35] thou stood Us in the way against me now
[1:01:38] therefore
[1:01:39] if you displeased him I will get me back
[1:01:42] again okay you can stop there brother

[1:01:54] normal for you that this guy is talking

[1:02:39] you can speak to situations in your life
[1:02:42] and it will come to pass yes that's true
[1:02:45] how many times have this false prophet
[1:02:46] strike the
[1:02:48] s
[1:02:50] how many times did Moses strike The Rock
[1:02:54] hey
[1:02:58] Moses struck the rock twice
[1:03:01] Balaam struck the S three times
[1:03:05] amen
[1:03:06] both those strikings
[1:03:08] two and three were not in the will of
[1:03:11] God
[1:03:14] and both times he came in the midst
[1:03:19] amen
[1:03:21] both times he came in the midst
[1:03:24] the angel was so concerned now watch if
[1:03:27] you're thinking why I'm leaving the
[1:03:28] point Exodus
[1:03:30] 23 says Beware of the angel
[1:03:34] do not provoke him
[1:03:37] unto his voice you see what he's doing
[1:03:40] here he's executing judgment
[1:03:44] he's got a sword
[1:03:48] this Angel didn't age this is the same
[1:03:50] angel that came on souvenir Canyon amen
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:55] and the sword fell into the prophet's
[1:03:56] hand yes
[1:03:59] swallow swallow swallow yes same Angel
[1:04:02] yes
[1:04:04] he's coming
[1:04:06] and I'm telling you he's going to lay to
[1:04:08] waste all of your enemies
[1:04:10] not only your enemies but every
[1:04:12] situation but you've got to trust him
[1:04:14] you got to believe him you've got to be
[1:04:16] sincere and consecrate your life to him
[1:04:19] amen you got to have the victory over
[1:04:22] all your circumstances amen and then if
[1:04:25] you want to be really blessed you need
[1:04:27] to read the 23rd chapter of numbers
[1:04:30] I'm not going to read it for you tonight
[1:04:33] the Joshua posted some stuff yesterday
[1:04:35] right amen we'll read the 23rd chapter
[1:04:38] of numbers because every time they try
[1:04:41] to curse you
[1:04:43] Balaam can only bless you
[1:04:47] oh
[1:04:49] amen
[1:04:51] and there you'll find even there's a
[1:04:53] former and there's a letter there I
[1:04:55] don't have time to go into it right now
[1:04:57] there's a first hole to raised up
[1:04:59] where Balaam blesses the people he
[1:05:02] prophesies
[1:05:03] then Bale accepts up a second altar
[1:05:08] consults the Lord again and then he
[1:05:11] prophesies again blessings
[1:05:15] right and if you think if the type is
[1:05:17] going out of balance here because then
[1:05:19] raises a third altar but unfortunately
[1:05:22] there's no more people after the second
[1:05:24] prophecy goes for
[1:05:26] that Balaam doesn't even go to the third
[1:05:28] altar
[1:05:30] there's only two prophecies there's only
[1:05:32] two reins
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:36] there's only two Reigns
[1:05:38] and they bail at his left standing alone
[1:05:40] with this last altar with no one to
[1:05:43] prophesy
[1:05:45] amen because after this final latter
[1:05:48] rain
[1:05:50] there will be no more prophecy going
[1:05:52] forth amongst the Gentiles so this is
[1:05:55] the latter rain of branham's message
[1:05:58] and I'm gonna make it personal now you
[1:06:01] are the lettering
[1:06:03] outpouring of the spirit upon you
[1:06:06] a brand new's message
[1:06:09] amen
[1:06:10] who is it
[1:06:11] say I am
[1:06:13] I am
[1:06:15] everything that the prophet Branham
[1:06:18] spoke about amen you are coming right
[1:06:20] now to manifestation and I'm telling you
[1:06:22] some of us need to press through because
[1:06:26] the cares of Life are going to try and
[1:06:28] choke us try and make us busy
[1:06:31] but remember you need to consecrate your
[1:06:34] life you need to have your time with God
[1:06:37] amen we're coming into a serious hour
[1:06:39] now
[1:06:40] trouble sometimes all around us
[1:06:43] don't think you may be thinking hey
