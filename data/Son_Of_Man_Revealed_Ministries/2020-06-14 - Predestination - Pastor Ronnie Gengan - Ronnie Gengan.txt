he was making some pretty B's publication there then they wanna change but they are worship to set today and the one that was true seventh they need to spend time with the family and and just relax that's one of these desires so you won't be surprised with that the New World Order starts they might change it saturday is a complete any of reds for everybody that's an order they'll have to follow but the Bible tells us that you know after the resurrection they gathered on the first day of the week amen well Jesus was there with the disciples preaching it all they went to the synagogues to preach down Saturday but how with the resurrection the gathered on the first day of the week that is Sunday see but he's got a bright idea I said the world is too pressurized now and and people really need rested stay at home and spend time with your family and everything else in with which is true they are stressed out and they no rest and he wants to make them Aurora but the body tells us our risk is a Sabbath is the host friends alone that's our true 7th event we give all glory when he comes in establish all what he wants a video from the earth yes God will take it and we find that then in the spec now he can fend for himself you know in this disaster nobody can come to anybody's risky the trying everything they can and violence America is burning at the moment this division in the country listen to the news this morning they do know what happened there but he was running away from the police and they shot him so that sparked another night there and then all of America is in the right us control himself yes chapter 14 that will be from verse 36 and our topic is centered on predestination but coach called method of saving us and now it can't be saved any other way and I'll be caught that you can't have any other way we said long before we came here we read the stocks and then see if that was years ago see we weigh the stocks so he starts to express your love so we have express thoughts of gods so let's go to the Old Testament it's a flat so today we read from this 36 against him by bringing up a slob day upon the land even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the play before the Lord right by the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh which were of the men that went to search the land live stove so only from the 12 that God said I supposed to set the clock right only two of them Joshua and Caleb but not killing them because they were prepared to do what God told ya so let me spray Jesus we thank you love you Jason thank you all for your mercy Lord Lord is by your mercy we learn every day forgive us our shortcomings Lord we pray that you be with us this morning we come you said whenever two or three I gathered your name your he novice thank you Lord for this glorious day we thank you Lord for that a word that is already preached by profiting man in the message shallow loss darkness upon this earth yes Lord the word said rise and shine our light is come yes do ya lets our hearts and maybe press one thank you Jesus the way that you touch them in and they are great people there you go buddy ask it in Jesus precious name thanks amen according as it was a division when the widget to be for foes everything had to be as you saw it in the vision and there if the property was in the play said he knows now the Lord is gonna work and he waited for everything to come into place I think the very early days there was a little sick baby to be playful and the Lord showing the grandmother will be set ablaze and the father will be giving and their salute something was in his place God I think brother Jeff what you post for that speak God waits for everything to come he is coming into place the Antichrist is coming to place revelation 13 is coming into play and the black chairs not appoint one day he's not gonna spread out for a couple of days till one day the hubs is that last one is that he was preaching in the hotel you know I made me eat this up till tonight not important at all see the predestinated so we must all always pray for that but the message of the hour see and you might end after that there wasn't that last one you see everything is gonna come into place in other words the rapture won't go until that last one give you this land and birth order it's a good land you better find everything there to live you're not going to come shop but I said to Moses cannot twelve men from the twelve tribes they have the rule is from each fire and said then twelve let them go and bring the evidence bring the evidence first praise the Lord so Moses did that call the twelve men from each of the twelve tribes and the book of Revelation 13 sorry numbers 13 names each one that was taken from each row man and so the wind a the spies went and they were there for forty days they spied out the land and everything else in and they brought the evidence and the broth pomegranates the broad figs and the broth and so much of grapes the budgets were so big two minutes Kenny maybe they put and walk through the Charlie now the candy what had all in the past so they brought the evidence and the product they had this said to Moses here's the evidence we look like grasshoppers in the sight there is a the children on the event and God was very angry with and God came and told Andrew sit here you people Joshua and Caleb said let us go up at once amen then we're not going to fear any giant saw or anybody I believe what God said reading you know you get the little writings there before the part and in there in the group and that's a Hebrew and the Greek translation is Jesus amen so that's why he was born and able to say we're gonna go over and he catch the Holy Ghost today so who is a leader today the Holy Ghost he's leaving us later on and the K loop is the faithful believers and the Bible says there was another spirit in Caleb and then so these two are fearless to go over and take over and when when these people died Moses came and told the people and they all born that said listen here let us get a leader we want to go back to Egypt God you brought us here to die we want to go back to Egypt it'd been better to stay over there and he said you know what the children of you can say you let them out and it supposed to be a mighty God but then I what happened here to destroy the people so God had to change his mind and he was prepared to take Moses and he says by your seed now make a mighty nation than them but Moses said we'll eat to see great so long and then we find when he told these people that go to the man something over there he said all of y'all that moment for those leaders from 20 years and upward all of you are going to die in the wilderness their weapons find out the land for forty days now one day is not before one year for your you're gonna perish in the wilderness for forty years years despite the leg up for every one year is going to be one year for yours he actually came since said to Moses no no we'll go over now when mother said listen yet to read that here let's well say check out is saying unto the children of Israel and the people mourn greatly see that others were killed in the play and the ball did noticing and God is gonna wipe your ass twenty years and over you're not going to go over there's 40 and they rose up early in the morning and get them up into the top of the Mount and say no we be air and we'll go up to the place which the Lord had promised for we have sinned and Moses said wherefore now do you tend less the commands of the Lord but it shall not prosper see cannot prosper go not up for the Lord Lord is not among you that should be smitten before your hidden ease verse 43 for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are before you and you shall fall by the sword because you have turned away from the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you but they presume to go up to the you top nevertheless the act of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not from the camp so this rebellious people still that I cannot now we want to go see but it says we're gonna go there the enemy is gonna make your run it didn't wanna listen this won't want to go was 45 then there many tracks came down and the Canaanites which dwelt in the hills and smoked them and discomforted it even dr. Ouma thanks a lot so we find from that old group here only Joshua and Caleb encouraged and then only David two that were able to go over and then from 2 million people only two maybe over Braves a lot so the bar tells us it's not in the bullet or him God show it mercy all that the father has given me will come amen praise the Lord when God is calling us here bring us his glorious message glorious light of the day you think the people want to come no they find all excuses remember against God they're not family gets a profit the memory gets got right all the evil things are said about mental telepathy you know reading the people's mind and fortune-telling and everything the murmur that gets God and they still want to continue and self God in the denominations there's still want to serve God in the systems but God is taking the new generation with his word the Prophet said this is a further and from Pentecost amen Pentecostal Holy Spirit came like a rushing mighty wind yeah God Himself kid now element fulfilling his word so the variety shall be Claudia and the revelation of the word and then coming down the restaurant said no we can't take it we can't take this word by the world tells us trying to take the book the angel don't take a book and eat amen it was sweet and butis amen we must take a whole book and eat it whether the web is put on my Twitter we must take it and eat it praise Allah so they called murmurs and everything else in and there and God is going to deal with them and smite them amen when they murmur against him the woman came to set in the church she was not this properly how did them is given a coat to come to Jim I don't wanna from what that power that's nice she got angry and went away from the church astronomy preaching it all the time and she went oh she started to die record started coming out of the face the highs got crossed and she said the husband please run and go call that man see please Navin : you know the story he said please come and see a place that's no it's too late chichi she remembered against the Word of God she died miserable day and the thought is yeah gamora if God don't destroy the world because of what happened they then he was raised up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologized to them because how he tell to them you must deal with the whole world you must deal with every individual so if God don't deal with people the way you dealt with this woman that got angry and walked away and said this is what you call religion I won't want it from my pet cow isn't it true if God don't deal with the rest of them you must raise up a phony tax I'm sorry I can't believe the rest of them apologize to you ratio see so every one of them that member and come against is word of God [Music] and the make kisses you know and says we living in a modern age and we would ever write it and we have a right to know this when you want to learn and where our way we want to that's our right but what the Prophet said we must fulfill all our rights surely we have rights we have a right to live abroad tells us we are not of this world we have a right to do whatever we want to but if you are born of the Spirit and through the Holy Spirit we are subject to the holy spring even we don't even belong to ourselves you know the people of this world so boastful of everything but the whole and everything else but the bank says we are purchased position if somebody purchased us we got nothing to lose ourselves amen he purchased us with his own blood he paid the price so he owns us and if he tells us in his word however slow and what we must do we got to be obedient to his word amen otherwise we are not fit to go on the other side praise Allah we got to make an effort and press on and stay with this word Amen so God doesn't want members you get memories yeah you know we don't want this message the message is too hard and this and that and everything else and people will never come to that knowledge of the truth some of it yes right see the world you know what is this and what is that and everything else if it's not the grace of God they will never see see ya in the hole blindness that will continue taking yourself God another one tells us they are heavy learning never able to come to the north the truth ever lemme they go to private school I will college everywhere they learn things but they'll never come to the knowledge of the truth they read the Bible and then leave the Bible we know Christians out there dedicated to read the Bible they got a reading plan they read in the mornings we're gonna read we've got a really plan to read they can read from Genesis to Revelation but you know what it can be ever learning that can be really right but if they don't get a revelation that really doesn't be much they got to get the revelation what is happening people can study the Bible most you could take the fastest around the world denominations everywhere they are reading the Bible yes right you can take a man that put him on an island and give it this Bible you'll read from Genesis to Revelation you can read it but it gotta take the Holy Spirit to quit even work to make that word alive for your day why they really give me other by passing the scriptures either by passive Malik I draw this in the Bible scholar now that's interpreting you know never say wait a senior Medicare for said before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the rod he voice might be eight of the curse I would say it's so much destructive sentence again this is what's happened so where is the seal and yet even box much the air for the gas and all the other scriptures revelation Ted might the ancient come down amen and then opens up would never say listen yet I'm dubious guys are we eating Phyllis am I sitting at this before the rapture there's going to be a revolution careful for a number say Luke 17 we are seen as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah has he president days Allah the one who's gonna be the second coefficient they say loose again this must happen but why are they reading and all this thing in and also baptism and all they they reading it but they never coming to the knowledge of the truth right now well it must be the quickening power it must be revelation right so we take for example yeah we're calling Saul for now because he wasn't falling I don't know what their what they told me means anybody knows oh we was looking before I became well you were so right so who was so caught by who can you he had the best teacher he taught him in all the Jewish moocher he thought he belong there were a word and everything the Jewish rule kids the Jewish faith and then he was one of the best teachers there so Saul was brought up under him he's a true he had the best teacher yes but he never knew things I'll tell the purifier metric that actually pull off I said not God and I would send you to the Gentiles so said that if it's not them you can talk to them about the best agent and tell them Roxana Crawford and opening the word and everything else and they will they won't listen listen but it must be the oldest people to work in the lives we we want everybody will be safe we want everybody to believe a message you know we get excited when you speak to somebody in and we are wishing that no doubles you know be quickened by something and and then really say you know as Chris but they said that but it must be the Holy Spirit quickly marry a man like Jake said to Peter now who do men say that I am they've gotta have a revelation some say Jeremiah some say you know your eyes and this and that man but Peter who do use it you got that revelation of who he was see so you've got to get that revelation of this message written gonna explain this message to them but they're gonna get the revelation they got to see it's God I'm going to see it's a move of the Holy Spirit they're going to see something different hey Ben we're gonna see Jesus Christ again coming and doing things that preforming but they were that was so far gone they didn't even identify the moving of the Holy Spirit they were so set in their ways and everything else and the parameters are because the same when Jesus came the first time in that here we saw said I'm when the priest was there they were doing the office and they were taking the second fire on behalf of my people or not but when the scriptures were fulfilled for that day they didn't know you are standing right in the midst and if you know all these things yeah cheap the scriptures were there but I let me take Holy Spirit to reveal it amen when the three wise men came they said where is he palm King of the Jews well it works surprise huh as they keep supposed to be born and the College where it says but friend that pity in the Bible I said yeah I know it says he had been here and the wise men went okay dokay don't find it when you find it come back and I also want to worship Him see that was a devil he didn't wanna worship we will not destroy so God call those three wise men after the finish don't go back to her by the way and there it stood when I found out they didn't come he went to kill all the babies two years ago bed all the males say so God will give him the revelation if they don't give in revelation amen so we must pray that God must open the heights amen nomination is that there was ever spiritual sight see not just hearing they're reading the Bible they are all reading a Bible but who is going to reveal to the malachite forum where looks empty who's gonna reveal to them and yet we tell them it is only going to happen if there's a seed gene of God that's going to quicken them that round certainty of accepting like that legally that in a place there will come bursting for out of it why it's gonna be the word that's going to quicken it they know it's not a bit bad that is the revealing this but the Holy Spirit is revealing this word and they're gonna burst out of it praise Allah so the Bible tells us to be ever ready never coming to the knowledge of the truth right now what he says here it was three seven surely the Lord will do nothing but the reveals his secrets three servants see he's not going to do nothing so that's true you must be full foe there should be a profitable and because he's not gonna speak to anybody first he will bring that passage through his prophet first then the must hear that prophet and it's a predestined seed they will hear and what he says in Revelation chapter 3 ye that happen here let him hear what the spirit saith in my respect a man talking in the day it's just full of talking in the day through the men see and what don't be the oldest of great big higher education of learning in and the brothers are pretty tight I wish I could speak like believe them I wish I had a voice like is well they call Roberts you know that you come in and speak and presented know what chose him and in the way that he speaks and everything else atever it's not in the way that they spoke amen you know the voices went out them and really sounded and things know God spoke in a simple way yeah but I believe that word will get to the bride creaking the bride see so people can come for a while and serve God for the one but the one who tells us here right second to me ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and the dream that exactly they are ever lemme yes spending all the time they'll never come to the knowledge of the truth and the other scripture tells us it see Hebrews chapter 10 is anybody grows back since so people can't grow up that we're gonna read the scripture that let's go to eBrush up to ten we know that because people went the message there grew back all over the world he walked through the world the rejoice of the work then rejoice want to seize it but they drew back so let's see what the box and about then revelation 10 verse 34 for you at compassion of me by bones said Paul and to joyfully the spoiling of your good knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward see cast not away your confidence which a great recompense of reward for you and need of patience then how can you have done the will of God you might receive the promise what of us do first then after you've done the will of God even let me see the promise for yet a little while he that shall come will come and not tarry speaking about the coming of the Lord for yet a little while and need that shall come will come and not tarry now the just shall loop I say but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him huh you he's coming but some people wanna draw back and the dead they wanna draw back from blood going to the promise of God we want to draw back now we find fault here we find fall there the prophet said something is wrong the prophet said something there we're gonna draw back I want to go back to Egypt Egypt comes the world Egypt plasma systems I have the order go back we don't want to follow that attached for we don't want to follow the message so if any men project my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them would draw back unto perdition what is position hell we are not have been the draw back unto perdition who was Judas son of perdition see one of them that believe to the saving of the soul we don't wanna drop back we're gonna press on they're coming up the rock to the saving of the soul see let me say in verse and ER we must be perseverant we must be persistent plays a lot right if if the true revelation of what you have in the word and the Holy Spirit is not keeping you then what is keeping you how are you going to continue amen we know we ever promise we know this is a Word of God and when we love their last days are yeah see remember that case upon us the condition of the world is sitting there getting just right for the rapture see men are heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God false accusers trucebreakers incontinent fears this is then the world is like that there's no place you can go you know once even in our country when things were looking good yeah especially with this uh all the chaos you know country people were fleeing you could write to us pray New Zealand the world knows I'm going to go back where were places where there's no fear and the safety for the children and obviously but now there's no place all this places that I want to go to a place is a problem you know in the private preaching Chicago another place he spoke in Chicago that the gospel must go and people must receive the Word of God Francis today Chicago is one of the highest murder states in the world the highest murder people are murdering I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of people are defended in Chicago even the same is happening United States Tucson where the fire came down well the prophet got the Commission seven angels can go through the seal but Tucson in the news there's uprising and writing and everything there they can't control them yeah and the Prophet when the Lord sent me there there was like desert place cactus and he's talking about once when they're ready instead over here the place was so peaceful and you can yeah disability but it says now it's a place of where the growth is casinos gambling dens and the cities are so you know Goethe and then and become the biggest cities over there now Tucson Arizona full of mighty they don't know what to do in the place called on the west coast a border in Canada and America Seattle they corner again and the brunt says job if you're God said and stop this violence I'm gonna send the bill three other lady the lady government and what she says we are gonna come back your military you can try and send your military going to combat them can you believe that the president said you can stop them for lighting and burning up the places at all you're fully Center give up send your military we're gonna combat them chaos what and also once all these places aware that God was preached and we feel sorry for the believers there clover their battle as good believers in Seattle they just cross over the border there and the good church over there also they gotta preach it off but now all this chaos and violence and all you know the movements are restricted Branson the old world has got to the stage but the bride is looking she's looking at all what's taking place listening to the news and that people don't know what's happening they want an answer see as much as advance they are scientists can't come to the rescue right now scientists are personnel aboard asleep trying to find a vaccine which is an immune system only to pull your immune system and when you get that virus your body must be able to handle it and they can't kill that because there's no life in it ourselves is what they need they're gonna get into ourselves and then they multiply and reproduce and damage our organs the lungs and then stop top top news that this was from the laboratory it is a biological thing that is introduced this proof so it's not something that just started from animal and I reckon they've done that than the research and all the way that it sticks to human beings when it gets into them it doesn't stick to the animal like that it sticks like that like a tick you don't click on the goal that invites into the skin over there you can't get it out they're going to try to put a tick over there it's holding so much you'll pull there it's still in the skin so as it can stick more on the human get into your lungs and your throat and everything but it don't stick like that pamphlet anymore there maybe like that science is very advanced but before I got to take any weight there are some believers around the world got infected with these things especially there in England some believers from zubaba working over there and we got used some of them have got the virus and things like that so pray God will make me wait for them even other parts of the world so it's a it's something because I look at now and ask God know what is happening now our province here there was hardly any cases now you know that way it was slow and how do you meet somebody that's been traveling out but I believe you're supposed to be at the Caleb in Joshua's teacher one of the guide the husband that the teacher is infected huh so we gonna find that now how come all of a sudden these people got the virus from where because you're gonna have a trace of it not happening with a few people but all of a sudden is cool about it is it it sounds very scary so you don't know where so there they are warning us don't go to the supermarket don't go yet don't go there because you don't know who's got it sick somebody can just have it there and that's the reason the clothes done all the mushrooms are now somebody can prepare your food is sneeze over there at the Romney people people speech then if they don't know because they're cooking in the back there they don't know you think Dean fall on the floor they take it and throw it away no they take it put it back in the pot that's right that we didn't UNICEF and the brain researchers study the gluttonous undercover guys they're the fondest people they're not even washing the heads preparing the meal thank you see they're wiping the nose so you find that your food is a little bit tastier so grandchildren they don't know where this is and they're trying to prove it but the people are protesting oh we want that we weren't there she beat you open we want the bottle store to open you know we want to have we want cigarettes open the places so we don't know what to do so we just beat this classic a lot done that you just keep us by its grace so what is this all the see coming up on the earth and one time the world had an opportunity to hear the gospel together the message and if they reject this word they got to pay for it so you're gonna find out all these places the Prophet wrote in Greek so you can trace those places are become terrible cynic I'm Governor Bob there's no control see so we pray the Holy Spirit come and catch his bride and take them away but in the woods our fathers some people what a drawback and the only drawback when all the fault again trying to go to scrutinize the life of the Prophet and find out why he gave wrong dates with this at wrong begs for that so that's an excuse of the drawback but if you see the moving of the working of the Holy Spirit we wish it brother we're not drunk back yes we know that the problem spoke alive you would have not moved at all because you know one time when he said to the government authorities that were under you for the Texas he said too so I tell them I'm not here and God won't eat a baby that will see you have to go make that land and confess it right so you throw so many other lies right God would the who gave His life so yeah go and confess it right so people wanna drop it we wonder what revelation they had now how can they have the revelation how can the rejoice for a while how can they be there were there were partakers of the Holy Ghost there was singing and praising God and everything else what happened go to Hebrews chapter 6 now Hebrews chapter 6 is one of their scriptures here the prophet in his early days where the witness somebody speak with tongues and somebody interpret and by the gift of God that he had he was able to find that one was the genuine Christian one was the sinner living in adultery and that trouble is mine because they're all there in the chair to rejoin see but this one guy was living in adultery but so he got trouble he went with them in the wilderness he said I'm gonna wait upon the Lord I'm confused about this and this is one school - yeah the Holy Spirit blew open amen the Prophet had the Bible closed but the wind came and blew it here to Hebrews chapter 6 see first four we can read for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift Oh the taster and we made partakers of the Holy Ghost can it ever be broke here were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and tasted the good word of God and that was only the message the good word of God and the powers of the world to come why cry speak the Prophet aunty five times he was able to speak and things happen powers of the world to come the tadpole if they shall fall away okay if they shall fall away thank you the power of God if they shall fall away to reduce and put him to an open shame see this is where it's good to have been to the profit mode for that for the head would you drink it in the rain they're coming off upon it and bring it forth herbs meat for them to me this dress this Seema the blessing from God but that which well Tom's and Prius is rejected and is not at the cursing was hellish to be burned what he said he falls on the just as a gesture but the real predestined writers I'm not going to be like these people just gonna be partakers that rejoice for a while and everything else no praise Allah they say but that which well Tom's and breezes and things that accompany salvation the only that speak so there's something will pull back how many people that pull away many people through back back to the old way of living the first signs when you see somebody leave the true Word of God the first signs of unbelief the dressing change though they become worldly and I want to still say today you can still see that distinct difference between a message believe addressing and the worldliness people and some of it that blessing change the sketch become shorter shorter tender stop putting all these things Ostara they suspect hyperosmotic see let me not get on like a hybrid you can go by pet and you can put your but when you believe it they left the word the word and the message but keep keeping them in line but they pull back you know I'll see the sister a very long time we seen at the funeral she used to fellowship with us too she and her family then some little something to have they left to went to another church and they left jet jet went to another church and they basically now they're not going to any church at all and I got problem that we seen the sister and the funeral well it's wearing slacks was once coming to the message that bless properly like every basic believe it off wearing slacks and the a is got chopped the wife and I were there the day when we see that the leave the world and they think the only way not to become worthy and to make it even worse they gone home pick one one and I want a dress for their for their slacks so I must believe the word leave a message the first thing about scum like that it shows what spirit is motivating them he's controlling them they're taking the blood of Jesus cutters they can't come back they put him to an open shame so without me ten bucks for this message I would have Gordon and out his early days he met his wife and things like that and she was going to be a missionary going to Tibet Dave Asia and the mountain Himalayan mountains and a mother father were missionaries in in Japan and things like that and she want to be a we shouldn't go there but she met Billy Graham and they've got many then all after that and I was looking at some pictures they and all the same you know as much as he was a phosphor preacher and ready preach the message also someday cities are picked up their your speech preach against denominations and churches like has a problem he chopped his wife now she's got very home because lips and now she's giving her testimony how wrong God was gonna use that and send it to Tibet and all this thing and then you know just let me look at pictures of people and tell us what spirit is there then I thought of the prophets if you look at the profit of each of you maybe his wife totally different number all this makeup and and walked in and dressing you know she was a super humble how to learn and I recommended his wife spoke very highly of her see so there is a wariness that people get into the corrective at the truth right I gotta deny the word to get into their and their enemies not there they got to come to the judgment and the prophet said everything would play out down the street the type of clothing that we were the things that we had interested but places we went to explain anything it just be plain you wanna see you don't know what funny judgment is not be pronounced everything that promises even every word we attack it continues in the airways we were just yell if anything it's forgotten it's continuing in their ways and they said everything to be there every word that we have to draw with everything else see the Bible talks about a conversation is everything what manner of people we have to be raised alone so remember now there's going to be a people on the face of the earth although we are not perfect ourselves we are still human right we are subject to failure failure we are subject to false thanks a lot Texan normal human living conditions isn't it I mean you know what Frances I mean if you have white going to bed the Kami all the time you cannot comment down okay you tell such a lovely cook you are enjoying your food everyday nothing the Muslim white a buzz word that she was wrong ago a little thing can upset American say no universe you'll never make my sandwich nice let's let's go quickly end and spring Gordon speech a little bit more to us enough so who are we today so we like everybody else we are human we have Falls we have failures and everything else but were they just full of big eNOS amen as much as we are the outside natural takes a spirit be there's a spirit man inside brother box in the output method is day by day but the inward man should be revealed right so now who are we really so the problem now he went to a laboratory with one of the brothers then and they took him to the laboratory where they had all the test tubes and everything else and if someone to test you how baby calves are born and when they look at this fish poop to put their micro microscope or whatever it is there on the glass and the foot was there and he looked through that and he saw millions of life millions of life and it looked at me speak to the brother he says you know what he's dead from one you know like one good-looking yeah he says it must be about a million life over there he said yes million the other one he says here if you'd watch the natural birth it's more of a mystery than the virgin birth but surah I mean the virgin birth Christ was prophesied already the virgin shall conceive a man that angel games and you shall call his name Jesus right that was what the supernatural right but the natural birth from over a million living Joe laughs Joe only one will come to life the rest of it must die in Finnish say so themself is the natural birth is more because only one comes to life horn we had put others and sisters but they all at the finish you came to life now the Prophet tells us something blinded you and your life so we look to by chance you had to be tired furthermore your image stops you are predestinated and he says in the beginning all the seats will lend you the drama it has to take the life of the subtle psychic to bring it to life but and because this firm there's one in there that's predestinated to live and the rest of the die and it isn't the first one beats it's a first one that comes together with a hey maybe the egg may rise up from the back of his firm or the middle of the spoon the germ they do the same they hang the germ crawls into the hay and little tails drop off of it and there starts the spine there's only one in that whole load of million that's going to make it only one and that's determined by some unknown force men get there everyone alike every one of those jumps I just like same thing in animals same thing in men it's determined whether it's going to be a boy or a girl Levin black in it or what it's determined by God like God said to Jeremiah before you were swamped with your mother's womb I knew you I knew everything about your maker and God was preparing it to be a prophet you can't be nothing else see so I'll be planned to come here I will predestinated then when God saw his own worth in their own world with that in the chaos with the teachings and you know his word and everything then is raised up yet there's no sucker believe is worth the predestinated ones see only after Paul went and studied for three years then he got the revelation to preach about predestination even myself he was predestined see he's speaking about predestination he's speaking about the foreknowledge of God see before that all these people are coming and then they you know coming take the people away from our faith the fearing or a Jewish faith but in that would be revealing what Danny is living in and what is happening yet me everyone alike okay it's determined by God but there's one in there that's ordained to in a million yet all of them are like when Israel left Egypt there was approximately 2 million people left at the same time every one of them had the message of the Prophet every one of them saw the pillar of fire every one of them was baptized to Moses in the Red Sea and one of them shouted in the spirit feed the tampering ran up around the banquet William when Moses sang in the spirit all of them did that everyone drank from the same spiritual rock they were there everyone he freshman at every night any one of them but there was two made the lame one out of a million what was the risk what was a test they all drank the same Rock they all need the same spiritual manner that we are eating this morning but the word test proved them ah the word test they were not able to believe God was able to do you think God telling them go over there I'm giving you the land and God no these giant Sunday God was not able to fight the battle for them right he did it from judgment killer family wins but I was dominated see they're going to get the word test when it comes to the time of Kennish Ponyo when they started over in the promised land and they could not go over to there was tested by the world and the other team can make said we can't make it we're like grasshoppers to them the great varsity their opposition's to great but judgment came up stronger people they said we are more than able to do it why God said before they left the promised and given you the land and give it to you it's yours and then wear one I don't teach believe so blood sisters how we got a pretty shot I were going to stay faithful to the Word of God and say what God all things are possible with God all things are possible right so there's nothing nothing to watch with a lot I mean he created the heavens and the earth he spoke things into existence when Moses was standing before Pharaoh he asked Moses Troy a rock down already sure it will tend to seventh God can make a rock ten to seven God can speak to a donkey and tell Balaam you know what you shouldn't go huh a donkey donkey and the Balaam was so much out of his senses big stuff at the end yeah you talk to you know you couldn't you're talking with a donkey huh so what I plan to show who are we the message I'm gonna set block for that short one and then run away whoa what the word says we are there's approximately 500 million so-called Christians in the world today again that was in this generation and each day ends in separation and now what if the rapture will come today and 500 people universally would be taken in the rapture so I think today there's about 2 billion Christians in the world right all over to believe and I think 2 billion Muslims also so they're not to take place you never know or even see let's see in the paper of them going and the coming of the lawn is the secret coming he said it's gonna happen so quickly the twinkling of an eye so who's gonna be this one's gonna go in the rapture you think God is gonna take it choose that y'all will choose yes we all that God prepared my speed when I come back I'm going to receive you he's going to prepare at the office they already prepared you take a youngster want to marry one girl you know okay the guy I mean haven't got a house yet we were like that we'll be young marry the girl take mother's ups dead mother's house date should be finished be able to have a job but know you're able to support your wife your parents got it enough today they don't you're worsening that you already prepared a place for us see we're not going to pick up there that said oh you know okay you got a quickie he is already gone to prepare a place and he said when I come back I'm gonna save you right so young people not get that mic set now I'm just gonna get bed those things over honestly Meatwad sir cranberry Mother's us after things didn't work out the mother completely is that if you recall we were go so make sure to get through but getting married to must make sure that I can support you yeah you find the house I'm fortunate I got a hot body okay so what is it he will come and steal away he will come and steal away he will be such a minority to just like it was in the days when the disciples asked Jesus why does the scribe cycle is was first come he said he's already come and you never knew it did you ever think what the people did the winter right on believing that he lies was coming and he was right amongst them and they didn't know it so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man they will do with him just the same thing the Spirit of God is here well what are you going to do with it are you going to eat manna and so forth and not condemn me move up as we grow did you ever notice the sea as a level interpreter speaking a few moments ago and how a seed goes into the ground many seeds are in the ground and then when God moved up on the water with the light it's light and what the waters went back the seed and that's why they equate to the mood and want to go to Mars at all to see if there's water there once they got water they know they can plant seeds they need water there's no problem they got sunlight the Sun striking day but they need water but so the water was have to see to grow so God has done all this had prepared for us okay your body was laying there right on the earth when God's has brought their people existence we are part of the earth we were living there and by his foreknowledge he knew exactly who would love it and who would serve it and who would not see loving him and serving him he's taking he taking his word all the way not to them drawing back he knows who love me when seven so that's why we love and certainly been the message and he's talking about a redtail we love him and be serving it we should believe the message where the last one standing if God is gonna work on his previous method method let all go all ten away we must be able to say Lord I'll be standing his foreknowledge tells them if he doesn't then he's of God he can't be God without the incident and if he's infinite he knows all things from you she's very good in you so you see people making the blunders people making the blunders they stimulated they learn at him and they think this and death but it doesn't work right we see it but there is a working right that's to find God's perfect world and stand in it what God called for you is a types in the Bible that we could see what happened there though the Old Testament that had what's going to happen in God down to the millisecond certain way he's going to do the same thing millions of the world 2 billion how many of their bought into life okay not yet jumps off to regroup see never right so the bride you saw then that came up through the Great Tribulation so their people will come up in the Great Tribulation they demand the chance of the web they will die for the faith they left it go to persecution or the Antichrist and everything else and they will die for the faint like in the early ages they'll be killed John saw bedroom and then he saw they happen to 44,000 of the Jews so the bride is there and the brightest part of him the Bible of the world won't tell us anything about anybody else being part of the bride and following the land only the brian has these potentials only she is part of him because she's part of in the world and the world came today right see so rude and we translate we ought to appreciate God really appreciate it I'll closer this one Katya now the Prophet also says somebody that did a good deed to you being the bride they will receive salvation can you believe that maybe they are not expecting it at least expect it but because you're the bride how important that is and they cannot receive salvation then if you turn that around if somebody does just despite to the bride what's gonna happen to this is it going to be blessed by Greek something for the bride and if they tell me get surprised you can think about that but God is going to deal with them too because you're the bride he said let the millstone be hanging around the neck round even if somebody comes and gets a child of God so this thank God we may be the few in number the bride if you talking gently around the world few in number but I pray now God has really revealed it to a hearty young people also God is revealing pray that God would make a way to you lot of young people after they came for their you know knowledge get knowledgeable and they could read something up don't know what the reason about the place if not that's gonna go see part of it but God has called you for a purpose God has predestinated us and that is where our fate to be anger pleasure our freedom or bliss [Music] yeah [Music] let's sing it again me [Music] I was so worried [Music] when he was [Music] my little Piper this is worshipable human insane rather we glorify
