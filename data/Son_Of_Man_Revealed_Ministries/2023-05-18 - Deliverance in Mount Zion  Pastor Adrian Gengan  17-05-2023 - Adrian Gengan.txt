right now Lord Jesus pray Lord that you would come now in your own Gentle Way even as we submit ourselves under your Mighty hand we have his Blessings Now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen I greet you all in the mighty name and the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen good to see every one of you in the name of the Lord amen I believe tonight we're going to have a great victory in the house of the Lord I believe we have a winning team amen you know when the coach is confident about the team he puts them against better competition amen and I'm confident about our team because the Lord is being doing a work for us amen the Lord has been we've been consecrating our life to him amen and we've been surrendering Our Lives to him and I believe the Lord wants to take us another stage in the journey and another step in the journey under the third pool Ministry because one of the polls is speaking to the Lost yes amen preaching to the lost so you'll find a lot of time people's Deliverance and their victory is going to rely on us and how consecrated we are amen and how dedicated we are in this hour right amen hallelujah we'll speak for a little thought amen I haven't said that amen just for I I really said that an inspiration I believe we have winning team amen amen amen hallelujah amen how many of you are ready to whoop the devil amen amen thank God for the songs of the song Amen one of The Inspirations so Deliverance the prophet says is the Earthly number tied to four so Deliverance is for the Earth and it's for the people of the Earth amen and if you notice when I wrote that song these three stages I wrote that verse of that song these three stages are changing me into the fourth stage which is the formed word image amen of the Son of God because brother Branham says there were four stages of the rider you remember he ate the bark he ate you know those the restoration of the Bright Tree how he ate the tree yes the caterpillar canker warm Palmer worm Locus he says the same way he rebuilds the church in four stages now we can't stop short at baptism of the Holy Ghost because those are only three stages justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he says we're going to come to the fourth part which is coming to his image coming to his likeness and I like brother Sony's prayer because amen people are catching the revelation we are Kings and Priests that's the image he's King and his priest he's the high priest and he's King and that's the image we are coming back to if he is there in heaven and he's the head the bride is dead on the earth amen amen and I said this before but I want to reiterate this in order for us to walk in in our kingly Authority it rests in our priesthood in our service and our submission to the Lord amen let's read Joe chapter 2 and verse 32. we'll see here amen with the Lord will revealed to us and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the Lord shall be delivered where is Deliverance coming from for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance amen not in a lodge it's coming from a people now it's a revelation who Mount Zion is amen amen Mount Zion is the Bride of Jesus Christ called the sides of the north amen there's a there's a natural Jerusalem and there's a spiritual Jerusalem so he says in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord had said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call amen and in Obadiah 117 I don't know anything about preaches out of Obadiah but he has a nugget here but upon Mount Zion shall be Deliverance and now watch preached again and there shall be holiness and the house of Jacob which is Israel shall possess their possessions amen we shall not live beneath our privileges we shall possess our possession yes Lord we'll be in the land and claim all the land amen thank you Lord that blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen hallelujah if you don't play with this bride not in this time not in this hour amen hallelujah we are taking back everything as ours amen we are not living Beyond amen we even taking the bones of Joseph yes because there's no Resurrection in Egypt yes for the federal revelation there's no Resurrection in Egypt amen so we find we're living in the time of the fourth living creature the flying eagle with soaring in Revelation nothing can touch us amen no chicken no Oak no vulture can fly where we fly yes amen amen so the prophet says four is the number of the earth and it means Deliverance amen hallelujah I just want to tie a few things here and show you that in Esther chapter 4 Deliverance comes to the Jews hmm but it comes from a particular woman who's Queen she's in a position of authority now remember we said four so s to four is typing the Deliverance coming to the Jews but she's got to step into that position of being the deliverer you remember Mordecai comes to her and he tells her maybe you were put into the kingdom for such a time as this amen and then you find she goes into a time of consecration if you go to the end of uh Esther chapter four you'll find it there she tells Mordecai go fast three days don't eat because I'm gonna fast amen so we find S to 4 biblical number shows you Deliverance is coming to the Jews isn't it also true that in John chapter 4 Deliverance comes to the woman at the well she's trapped by bondage by six men she's tied to those men because Jesus being a prophet deserves and said you had five husbands and the one you're living with now is not even your husband amen six a number of the men had abound six Church ages amen amen but yes the seventh the manifested word standing in front of her and he is bringing Deliverance to her yes amen she runs back to the city and says come see a man that told me things I have done she was completely delivered amen and how many times does the prophet use John chapter 4 the woman at the well amen isn't it also true that in Malachi chapter 4 amen Elijah the prophet is coming and he's sent to a people to deliver them and turn their hearts back to the faith of the fathers amen has that already happened amen amen it's already happened our hearts have already been turned back amen and isn't it also true that in first Thessalonians chapter 4. amen amen Deliverance is coming to a people amen Deliverance is going to come not only to the sleeping Saints amen but it's our final deliverance from Mortal bodies to Immortal glorified bodies amen one more and isn't it also true that in Revelation 4. John is caught up and is delivered from time into eternity and he's asked to come up a little higher amen and his Revelation explodes he goes from partial revelation of who God is and he goes into the throne room and he sees one sitting on the throne boy is the number of Deliverance amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah so God promises Abraham that is seed is going through sojourn for how many years 400 years Deliverance is coming yes 400 years amen hallelujah and Moses was a fulfillment of that promise amen then when God brought Moses on the scene and he took them out of Egypt how many decades had they had to wait before they entered the Promised Land 40 years is how many decades four decades deliberate is coming to the children who are in the wilderness after four decades amen so yeah we are under we've had them they're lying we had the ox we had the man but now we're in the age of the Flying Eagle amen under the fourth anointing is coming and deliverance to the people amen a Deliverance to the earth a Deliverance to the church to Fly Above Mammy Creeds man-made dogmas man-made systems and so into spiritual Revelation amen [Music] back in the day of Daniel you find that there was three anointings Shadrach Meshach and Abednego typing the lion the ox and the man but there was a fourth anointing there Daniel was the eagle amen Dan is the symbol was the eagle amen and he was flying through Babylon amen amen and isn't it true that there Shadrach Meshach and abedin go three men stepped into the fiery furnace but the Fourth Man brought Deliverance to them amen amen amen so we find Daniel is the eagle in Babylon and we know Daniel is praying seeking wisdom and he has such a amen and his prayer causes Devastation in the spiritual Realm yes chaos in the spiritual reality he's in his room but he's causing chaos in the heavenlies yes amen amen amen he's shaking the spiritual world and look how violent it gets When you pray it may seem like it's quiet in the house nothing happening but there's violence happening amen Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the violent taken by force amen hallelujah oh bless his name I want to take it now and show you amram amen amram is Moses father and I'm showing you that it's a time of intercession right now amen it's a time of consecration right now because through Abraham's prayer came Deliverance the answer was Moses and we'll take it from the prophet and show you how he dramatizes this now right and he says here and I want you to also catch a revelation of this and not just stop somebody but encourage one another amen so yeah we see now watch M Ram is how many letters there five okay so we see him night after night as amram climbed the stairs and Joseph Beth would come up to him and say amram dear you've been here praying all night why don't you just tell some of the boys you're working with let them pray a while right think in the terms of us now um amen now this is Moses mother and father before Moses was born well honey what if they don't do it somebody has got to do it think in the Realms of the message now amen I really believe at one stage we were speculating but I really believe that we are the people calling in the shower amen amen oh come on connect to that right now I really believe we are the people called in the hour right now somebody has got to do it who will raise their hand up with me and say Yes me Lord I'll do it they don't want to pray but we will pray they don't want to seek the Lord but we will seek the Lord they don't want Revival but we will bring Revival amen amen yes Mom somebody has got to pray through yes amen he says that's the way every Christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else but take the front ourselves and go through amen amen Lord I want that to be me amen amen amen hallelujah so then that night he said I'm going up to pray like I've never prayed before amen now that's the way to pray isn't it pray like you've never prayed before really get to business if it's just go up and say Lord bless so and so God don't take much interest in that bless this person bless that person bless this person God takes note when you challenge him amen when you take him at his word yes amen imagine God day every night what's wrong with every day I must bless this person bless bless bless bless don't they have a revelation they're blessed coming in and they're blessed going out amen amen nobody can take your blessing yeah if your lot is allotted to you amen he says but when you really get down to business he says oh I don't know what to do but he said dear if somebody don't take the people to heart if somebody don't pray for the people what will we do [Music] watch now it's the same Spirit on Esther in the Kingdom he says we're getting worse surely sometimes God will hear amen now if you track back our history wasn't that our concern yes what's happening to the people amen he says oh this time he goes upstairs different maybe even tonight maybe in the time passed you went in a different way but the next time you go to pray go dear friend he says when he goes up this time he kneels down puts his hand up in the air holler God I'm speaking to you now amen getting to business God that was years and you can hear me that was eyes and you can see amen that was memory you know your word amen you know your promise amen I plea to you God look down here amen yes wrong man don't you saw a casual prayer Pray that Lord I want you to come now in this room amen amen you're the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob that your people are in distress and they are dying if there's ever a time people are dying it's now spiritual death sweeping across the land if there's ever a Time amram needs to pray it's now amen amen Grace needs to be extended amen your people are in distressed they die do something for us God we've got to have you at once we just got to have you all will perish we might have you we must have you we just got to if we live that's when you really pray oh he prayed amen amen and yet the prophet says you know sometimes people when they pray they get tired he says don't they mother and dad oh get so tired brother Branham sometimes get so tired or almost freak when I go to praying for a long time it's revealed just get to Fringe go without eating and things for days and pray and pray and pray and preach and I just get to a place I'm going to faint nearly and sometimes people get that way amen I want to tell you the victories we're having in the shirts right now is because of a similar type of Lifestyle things needed to change amen and we were willing to change amen amen he says there's no time to give up keep on God will answer amen right keep holding on Amen amen yeah he says listen to the nature of people now today people if they don't get everything they asked for the first time they pray they seem to think that he's dead what we need is men and women today of Gallant Spirit men and women who are determined to hold on amen amen are we determined to hold on amen amen hallelujah remember that grain of sand is moving yes amen they're holding on till they see God that really lives coming to action that will not take no for an answer amen amen I refuse to take no for an answer amen amen you remember we read that story on on Sunday about this woman who was desperate and went to the prophet Elisha and Elisha told gehazi to go and take his stuff and put it upon the boy did anything happen did the woman give up no so if God don't answer Pray Again amen seek his face again yes don't take no for an answer say Lord I refuse to take no for an answer they determined to stay with it if they are sick and the doctor said they can't get well something within them tells them they're going to get well amen amen hold on no matter what takes place amen that doesn't only extend to sickness that can go into any problem in your life any area in your life amen you've got a child that's Wayward say Lord I refuse to give up on them yes I'm claiming them For Your Glory Lords I'm pleading the blood of Jesus upon them in fact I'm praying Lord that I see the return Yes Man amen amen hallelujah thank you oh he's worthy to be praised isn't he amen yes Amen brother Caleb you need to get me on the quotes now it works is Faith expressed 1965. you find that and I'll give you the amen but we'll come to that now so we find we've got to have a concern amen amen nobody asked and if you can also put up Daniel chapter 9. amen nobody asked Daniel to do what he did Daniel was like amrap the Bible says here in nine chapter two let's take it from there in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years where of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem now we are in another Babylon and we don't Daniel is the eagle we are the eagle yes and we understood when we looked we came to random the prophet amen and we're understanding that our times and our season the 17 year speaks about the times and seasons of natural Israel but in our time when we come to Brandon the prophet we understand our times and season and we know we don't have much longer amen amen because everything is going full steam ahead the world is going full steam ahead amen the devil is going full stream ahead amen politics demon powers religion full steam ahead amen amen I said this before I'm going to say it again the final documents for the one world religion has already been signed yes there's no more meetings it's all in place they are just waiting now they don't know in the state of limbo don't know what's happening why the angel is here on the earth amen one foot on the land one foot on the sea amen amen amen they can't make a move now until the Angel takes his foot off of them amen hallelujah yes and Israel as well wondering hey what's happening what's happening because there's four Angels holding back the winds holding back the walls amen amen hallelujah who can speak with such Clarity in this hour if not the Flying Eagle amen yes amen So Daniel chapter 9 verse 3 says I set my face unto the Lord to seek by prayer supplications fasting sackcloth and Ashes we just read we need to get desperate amen amen and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from their judgments now he goes on and he's praying and he's praying and he's praying amen we're not going to read all of which you can read it amen so what am I trying to tell you that Daniel the eagle in that hour had to enter a time of intercession a time of prayer for the people amen the people are unaware of it the rest of the message community in Babylon were unaware of it but there was a selected few people that cried out to the Lord amen Selected Few people like amaran cried out to the Lord amen amen so our ministry is not always going to be a public show it's going to be behind closed doors amen somebody has got to take on the responsibility somebody has got to take on the burden Lord we know it just any time now something's gonna happen it's like Daniel something must happen now hmm get to seeking the Lord amen hallelujah so yeah amen from verse 20 on you'll find some of you get that remember Exodus 23 from verse 20 remember Joel chapter 2 from verse 20. yeah Daniel chapter 9 from verse 20 and while I was speaking and praying confessing my sin and the sin of my people and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for my for the Holy Mountain of my God while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel who might seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation amen thank you Lord amen the evening sacrifice yes amen the angel of the Lord comes down and he informed me talked with me and said oh Daniel I'm not Comfort to give this skill and understanding and yeah in verse 23 he tells him at the beginning of your supplications the Commandment came fourth I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision amen when you get to praying in this hour another Daniel angels are commissioned amen Gabriel may have been busy with other things yes but he says at the beginning of your supplication the Commandment came forth to me amen go to Daniel amen now this is not the time that he was withheld 21 days that's in the chapter before right amen amen so it shows you that every time Daniel Prayed Heaven responded to his prayer amen amen what am I trying to tell you don't think your praise are going unanswered look at the change that's happening amen look at the lives you are affecting Deliverance is coming from Mount Zion amen Deliverance must come internally first before it can go externally right now we're experiencing the Deliverance internally in every life we've experiencing Deliverance amen we are praying for total Deliverance if you have not received Deliverance yes no amen and let me give you a clue and a secret now the reason why some people have not stepped over into the Deliverance is because of this no praise no Judah Judah means praise amen amen this is key yeah go listen back to a sermon I preached last year the sound of the redeemed amen the redeem there's a certain sound yes Amen Let the trumpet sound forth in Zion amen amen amen spiritual priests offering sacrifices yes amen amen amen you've got to let loose amen you've got to show inside you're standing on Amen did we show you that when Miriam died amen the waters dried up Miriam was trying typing their praise they worship amen they reverence to the word of God Hallelujah that is why some people don't have the victory amen even now some people are sitting Spellbound Spellbound amen no Victory no praise if you want to get into another level amen you've got to be able to amen the word of God Amen rid yourself of every amen every amen I don't know mental problem you got you can't break free in the house of the Lord Hallelujah if you were in natural Israel you'll have a hard time there you'll be like uh David's wife looking from the window other people worshiping now you're sitting in the church watching other people say amen to the word watching amen what's happening yeah I'm talking to you he was looking at me right now amen I'm talking to you amen get your praise going the Bible says let everything that has breath praise the Lord everything oh you must go and read about how they went around the walls of Jericho yes what caused the walls to come down yes that's right they want to take a silent night walking around amen hey josephat was told what get your singers get your musicians put them before the Army that's right the Army is not even going to fight by your praise you shall defeat the enemy amen yes that's what I'm saying deliverance from Zion Zion can't be quiet yes even that physical design can't be quiet he must speak amen hallelujah yes amen amen Deliverance amen amen yes hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah we'll preach it till you get in Revelation [Music] hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh hallelujah thank you Lord he says let the high praises of God go forth yes let it be in your mouth add a two-edged sword in your hand thank you Lord he says let the Saints be joyful and Glory let them cry aloud on their beds thank you Jesus oh God we know there's a man who can turn on the light but eskom likes to turn on the darkness but we thank God Amen that we have backup power Amen in the midst of legacy and darkness we have backup power amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name let's give the Lord a good answer for praise amen amen hallelujah that was to wake up the people who's falling asleep now thank you thank you amen energize blood flow amen glory be to his name so we just showed you Daniel now Daniel in Babylon had a concern now I don't want to go into Esther but you go and see Esther's Queen esteve is a position in a position of royalty she's the married wife of the king yes amen what is your current status if not married wife of the king yes amen invisible Union let me preach it yes then we preach marriage of the Lamb yes amen didn't he say you came predestinated from heaven with a marriage ring on your finger of predestinated Grace amen you are Mrs Jesus Christ yes amen standing in your position walking around the palace with no Authority but somebody needs to remind you of why you are there that's right amen and Mordecai comes to tell her don't think that because you are in the King's house you shall Escape what's put into law will even affect you in the house then we read on Sunday that Elijah was subject to his own prophecy that there shall be no rain yes that even the brook dried up because of his own word of Prophecy so once a word is released it becomes law amen but who are to rewrite the laws the one that has power to do it the one that has power to appeal to the king amen but there's a beautiful story there you need to read it amen and see how she steps into that intercession Deliverance is coming because of you amen amen amen if I had to break it down in a nutshell and tell you right now if there is four unsaved ones now that we are waiting for the last one to come in how is the Deliverance going to come in if not from you yes amen amen because through foolishness of preaching the gospel he has chosen to save man so it's our duty to prophesy again yes amen amen hallelujah so we find Daniel Day in Babylon he had a hard time because they were changing laws amen amen they were changing laws trying to stop his prayer life but Daniel will not allow the laws of the land to stop him from praying and he didn't pray differently amen you open up the windows as at other times the Bible says and pray to God so just because the enemy is not pleased with your prayer life amen and he may try to shut you down amen tell the devil that's your problem yeah amen amen if your husband don't like you to pray tell him that's your problem if your wife don't like you to pray tell you that's your problem yes if your children don't like you to pray tell them that's your problem don't make your problem my problem [Music] amen and maybe maybe through the cause of life through situations in life we've catered to the devil with catered to his plan for us in leadership we've catered for his work plans people can sacrifice they won't come to church but they'll go to work they'll finish on time they can even come here after seven but they won't make the effort they'll make all manner of excuses and if you are working overtime there's no excuse why you're not just here to be in the house of the Lord because over time is not compulsory yes you are making it over time because you want extra money shame on you you're not you're in the house of God and you want to work overtime amen don't let me get to praying I will get God to take the job away from you because who's the chef with you yes who must watch over the Sheep don't get the shepherd now to pray to the Lord and say Lord that's not good job for that person take that job away give them a Monday to Friday job amen even if it's less than mine I can pray that way why concern for your soul amen put God first amen make God your priority amen amen Hallelujah the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God amen amen so yeah amen you find that maybe situation that we cater to the devil and his imps because they want to change your life change your lifestyle amen they don't know demonic world is going to have a meltdown right now yes right the Demonic world is going into a meltdown because you are surrendering your life don't think they are happy about it okay amen they're going to come against you with everything they have with everything they got he's got the church world it's got the religious world is ganza focused on you right now amen send the devil into a meltdown make him angry get on your knees and pray amen open up your Bible read the word amen read the message of the hour amen sending me to a frenzy yeah we wrestle not against flesh and blood amen is trying to cause divisions in the home divisions in the family tell him Satan you're a liar yeah we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers wickedness rules in doubt of Darkness recognize the enemy amen you go to pray and also of angels are encamped around you yes we are to walk with their confidence that there's a host of angels and camped around me and nothing shall harm me yes amen that's right amen they are protecting you from the enemy amen don't give in to the Temptation and go back to your whole life yes amen that it's okay to be just casual in the message amen there's nothing casual about a believer in the message of the hour every day we are in a battle amen oh no it's okay people have become so lazy not even the amen German as the spirit but South Africa is a spirit each country has a spirit amen laziness oh no there's a certain form of the message that we should conform to and it's okay with that no let's press through amen let's seek more of God yes amen we want to see his Dynamic power return to the church yes amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah bless his name amen don't give it to the temptation to go back to your whole life of no prayer life no reading the word amen Amen in a backslidden state and Satan has deceived us that we're in the message of the hour it's okay put you back to Allah Rockabye Baby it's okay drink some milk amen what is it a life without the Holy Ghost he wants to attract You by that a life without prayer a life without reading the word that's a miserable life yes no no no no no no no I'll never go back anymore you know you can't get us to drink to smoke to take drugs commit adultery fornication things of the world sweet thing is an entice you with that no just negotiate on your prayer life just negotiate on your reading time just negotiate on this that and the other amen now demons may have tried to attack the body with sicknesses that's how they're going to come against you now they might try to attack the body with sicknesses and diseases and get you to surrender to their will but you stand your ground amen God has made a way for you you need to continue like a steam train a steam train amen that's that's rolling full steam ahead amen there's nothing amen they better not be anything in your way as a steam train going down Satan better not stand in your way and you don't stop the train so let him off the track if he's standing in your way run through him amen amen hallelujah bulldoze your way through every obstacle amen if Satan is on the railway track I want you to run him over don't feel sorry for him amen let's go to that one quote that he says I still don't believe you'll do it amen when the Devil comes in God is still God that's on the slide I think amen God is still God he'll not permit these Devils to do that I believe that today when that's when fashion and nonsense and all the stormy rot going on God still Reigns and he is still God what we need is somebody like amram got a burden on the heart who will stay there and pray through until Heaven is split open Yonder Daniel did it Esther did it amram did it and we are going to do it God comes down and answers prayer amen so no matter what he brings against the flesh you amen he may bring sickness amen but Jesus was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and tell Satan by his stripes I am healed amen amen hallelujah oh glory be to his name amen oh I tell you must watch how your mouth is going to open that time when you're on your jet bed yeah even now under the preaching of the word you refuse stubbornness watch on your jet bed you'll want to call on the name of the Lord Pastor please pray for me we're going to stand by your bedside like the prophet stood over Billy you pray yes but but I never ever prayed in church that time you're going to say Pastor teach me how to pray then you're gonna learn very quickly that your deliverance we're speaking about Deliverance is coming through your praise amen hallelujah how the job get his Deliverance he said though he slay me yes yes I will trust him amen raise up to the confession of job though he slay me yet I will trust him amen and I want to say the most wonderful life is a Holy Spirit-filled life there's no better life than a life filled with the holy spirit amen he's our teacher he's our guide he's our comforter the one that empowers us with the power from an eye amen amen he takes us natural and turns it Supernatural amen Amen to live without without the holy spirit is to live beneath our privileges amen yes amen so we we made these opening statements and we said we are living in the fourth stage of the restoration amen we've had justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the fourth stage of our deliverance comes with us being into the formed word image the statue of the perfect man amen hallelujah you asked what is the word image you must come back into sonship Authority walking in Victory that's what speaking to the mountain is coming back to sonship Authority amen amen and sonship Authority is tied to the Angelic World sonship Authority is tied Amen to that Unseen World amen Elisha could work in such Authority and stand with confidence that they were going to win the battle because his eyes was open to the Unseen World and tell me which group of people their eyes have been opened to the Unseen World right now amen that there's no doubt yes amen oh sometimes it's hard for you to understand or believe that with God works with simple People Like Us yes amen God works in Simplicity amen amen and the image we said is King and Priests Melchizedek was both King and priest wasn't he the king of Salem yes didn't he come to Abraham and offer him like a priest Bread and Wine yes amen King Melchizedek came to Abraham and performed this Priestly offers by serving him Bread and Wine now King Jesus amen King Jesus is now a priest after the order of Melchizedek making intercession on our behalf according to our confession amen watch what we confess yes he is offering debt so confess positive confess healing confess Deliverance confess promotion confess increase confess double portion anointing whatsoever you desire confess it amen who to the positive confession of your faith keep a positive car testimony Heaven responds to it amen Jesus is holding fast to your confession

Zion Mount Zion he says I dreamed you got it he preaches it once in 1965. amen he says I dreamed that I've seen a man a young fellow in shackles so this man needs Deliverance right and he was trying to get out somebody told me those are horrible people don't have nothing to do with them and I've seen this young fellow getting out of his shackle so I just let him alone I said I'll see what he does he was a nice fellow and I seen others trying to get out out of their chains and I walked and I seen Roy bought his very good friend of mine lives in California looked like something's wrong his eyes was off closed maybe cancer or something over his eyes so what is that demonic right something was trying to pull me away from him ice cream brother borders in the name of the Lord Jesus snap out of that now watch he used the name of Jesus and he said he could just barely speak saying brother Branham he loves to take something more than this [Music] I just can't grasp it brother Branham I just can't grasp it I said oh brother borders and then something pulled me away I looked it was a lady standing over here her name was Mrs Fenton amen and she said you've been misunderstood you misunderstood these people too these are fine people and I looked over there and like a great big cello big walls beneath the great big cave great iron bars eight or ten inch thick and people out of their mind Twisted arms legs beating the head like that people were bound now some of you don't know but that was the message Church you and I before the message came trapped in denominationalism big cave iron bars eight or ten inch thick people out of their mind Twisted arms legs beating the head like that and she was crying deliver the people brother Branham help us we're in trouble she herself I know her she belongs to the Church of Christ Christian Church 31 I looked around I wished I could and go on look around and then great big iron bars these people poor people in there you couldn't get to them iron bars were sitting close together isn't that the way it feels like talking to some of these German National people iron bars you talk to them you can't get to them yes and I looked they were beating the head like they were out of their mind and I seen some lights flickling around in there if you go to the church you see that lights flickering yeah doesn't it look like a Meadows right it looks like a disco yes it's dark they're like a duck we went to the church for the funeral completely black curtains Black Walls Black see it's black carpets black aircon black everything black it's right here Palm View Drive what's the name of it but there's no Worship Center black black black and they got all these disco lights there I saw some lights flickering around in there and I looked up and there's to the Lord Jesus with the lights of rainbow he is the one that makes the difference he's the one that can turn on the light amen he was looking right straight to me and sit now watch deliver those people amen amen amen amen and I said House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and all the creaking and popping and rocks rolling and bars falling and people running screaming delivered amen amen amen scream delivered amen amen and screaming at the top of the voice was all delivered you see people who are delivered scream at the top of their voice yes amen amen people who are set free scream at the top of their voice amen your answers all people back in the day those people that were enslaved when they were free they cried out free at last free at last thank God Almighty I'm free at last amen it's okay they were excited about their freedom exciting about the Liberty yes when you see other people dying in their churches amen we are to be the most excited people amen hallelujah delivered screaming at the top of their voice was all delivered and I was screaming there brother Roy borders where are you where are you God is delivering his people where are you brother borders I wondered about that amen you know brother borders is very scared you know the prophecy many of you do you take the tape so far about the West Coast amen now you'll find the prophet is tying this dream to him taking the Rock and throwing it up in the air that's why you'll find there amen if you'll see in paragraph 35 he throws in something there amen you're seeing 35 he says creaking popping and rocks rolling because when he threw the rock up in the air that Whirlwind came down and rent the rocks that was a time those little rocks came out in pyramid pieces right so he's tying it up to the Judgment side judgment right right you remember and Alaska yes earthquake The Good Friday earthquake he's tying it to death and he's what delivered the people the word of God came forth amen I know what under the third pool notice it was son of man that had to come down and tell give commission brother Branham deliver the people you and I again we spoke we're speaking about our association with the angel of the Lord yes Revelation 10 11 is our association with him where he says Thou must prophesy again amen amen hallelujah oh bless his name amen so we really need Amen to step into that time because like we said people's Deliverance you know if you were talking with us on Sunday here's a young man coming to church watch from the first time he came to now on Sunday when we were speaking to him like chains are broken shackles are gone and he's telling about how amen is rejoicing in the world and his life is being changed amen amen amen and you can see what am I telling you Deliverance coming in Mount Zion if people can only come to Mount Zion if you read those scriptures again Deliverance in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance Joel 2 32 amen Obadiah 117 says upon Mount Zion shall be Deliverance there shall be Holiness amen and he says we even question him a bit Stark difference in churches he says here you're more into the word amen he says never mind it's a bit longer yeah he says he doesn't even feel the time yes amen amen why the word is transforming lives the word is changing it and all of this what you see here in a public service lots of hours of secret labor going on yes amen labor in prayer labor in the word and all of these things yes amen amen you can rest assured right now amen that the ministry in this church is not lazy yes imagine it's right amen amen we must still find time to study the word wait for inspiration still pray because that's what many Ministries are failing yes you get so caught up in Ministry so caught up in preparing just a sermon next sermon this that visiting this that that weighs your own personal prayer life amen raise your own personal consecration so what to Ministry don't get so caught up in Ministry yes that you yourself don't have that consecration amen that goes for every one of us that goes for the deacons for the ministers here amen for the song leaders for the musicians don't get so caught up in other things yes that you don't have that time because music itself is a Ministry yes amen amen you carry an anointing yes that's right so there should be effort put into that yes amen the Bible says play skillfully Nobody practices so no one is skillful amen come anointed Leading the People In Worship come anointed amen office bearings everyone coming prayed up amen amen everyone in their post of Duty yes amen amen hallelujah some feel like the opposed of Duties to sleep in church amen Hallelujah you know there was a man sleeping one time in Paul's service yes the service went so long it was midnight and he fell and he died yeah amen and thank the Lord that Paul had Grace because I don't know somebody else might have just taken you to the mortuary you said now you deserve it you were sleeping in church but Paul had the power of the almighty God upon him amen amen and he raised him back up to life amen so I pray amen that we will be the channel of Deliverance in Mount Zion amen thank you thank you why did the angel ask John to prophesy again release the word of Prophecy John they have people bounded yes your word prophesy again yes Sir John you need to deliver the people amen and that Ministry has been given to you and asked amen every day I know brothers are witnessing what are you doing yes you're trying to break shackles break chains amen deliver the people yes the concern for the people amen but remember the power that's attached to you is in a lot of consecration amen you find the most successful men in Ministry spends hours in prayer I was in prayer I was in consecration yes amen people just want to say oh I want to be like this person I want to be like that person but when they see what goes behind it they don't want to surrender that way they just think God attaches his power to anybody God don't work a person amen amen hallelujah blessed be his name amen let's just leave it there let's give the Lord a good answer for praise him so if you never caught nothing this will give me I'm gonna summarize it and say you are Mount Zion and deliverance is coming through you and deliverance is in you anyone who comes to Mount Zion shall be delivered work with that anointing now amen amen you can walk into workplaces and pray that way say Lord if if Peter walking in his shadow could make demons flee and people were healed when I walk into places now pray with purpose right say Lord when I walk into places let demons tremble yes let people be delivered let people be set free let sickness leave the bodies amen hunger and thirst for that anointing amen say Lord I want to be so full of the power of God amen hallelujah hallelujah amen I know it takes a special Grace to want to desire those things the average person in a message Church won't want to desire to live that way yes but we're not talking to average people I told you we are talking to a winning team amen amen a team where every player matters and the team where we need the entire body to work together to function together amen and accountability in this time is very important accountability you need to account to somebody you need to have a prayer partner or you have to have somebody that you can give an account to doesn't the Bible says confess your wrongs one to another hello partner you can pray with someone you have confidence in that you can say brother pray with me brother amen I'm struggling in this area of my life somebody that will encourage you that will say okay brother what we're going to do tomorrow between nine and ten we both are going to pray together you can be in your house I'll be in my house but we both pray at the same time yes amen each family get together every evening read the scripture pray together amen you say oh I've never done it start now yes take take authority of your own again if Satan has taken your home away from you and it's not a Christian home reclaim your home amen say from today things change yes from tonight things change amen and things will never be the same again you'll walk in Victory amen play the messages again in your house yes amen Amen Let The Prophet's voice bring out in your house again amen yes let that voice Thunder through the house again right amen hallelujah amen let's all stand together give God praise amen is worthy to be praised oh he's worthy to be praying that amen glory be to his name amen while I was praying somebody touched me while I was praying somebody touched me while I was praying somebody touched me it must have been the angel of the Lord while I was praying somebody touched me while I was praying somebody touched me while I was praying somebody touched me in my step in the angel of the Lord while I was singing somebody touched me while I was singing somebody touched me and while I was singing somebody touched me it must have been the angel of the Lord oh yes and while I was let's clap our hands or somebody touched me while I was praying nobody touched me while I was praying somebody touched me into my step in the angel of the Lord if you read that message amen you'll find the prophet says yes finally when Abraham got to pray to a point the angel of the Lord came down thank you and he saw the sword in his hand and he said Hamra I have heard your prayer and you shall have a son when his name shall be and he shall deliver the people so pray amen until you have an experience pray through amen hallelujah glory be this name amen let's start to pray amen every one of us while you're praying now the angel of the Lord will touch you amen amen his wings will brush through you amen everyone exercise your faith let's call upon the name of the Lord father we thank you Lord that Deliverance is the revelation
