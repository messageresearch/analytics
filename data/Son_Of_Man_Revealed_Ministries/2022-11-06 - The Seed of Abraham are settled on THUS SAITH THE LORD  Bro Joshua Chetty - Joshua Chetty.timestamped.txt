[15:15] Bibles quickly to the Book of Genesis
[15:17] chapter 22.
[15:20] amen our faith that you have a beginning
[15:22] amen amen
[15:25] Genesis chapter 2 verse 15.
[15:33] and the angel of the Lord called upon
[15:35] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[15:38] amen
[15:40] and said by myself
[15:43] not by any man not by anybody else but
[15:47] by myself
[15:49] have I sworn
[15:51] save the Lord
[15:53] for because thou has done this thing
[15:57] and has not without thy son
[16:00] thy only son
[16:03] that in blessing I Will Bless thee
[16:06] and emulsifying I will multiply that
[16:09] seed as the stars of the heaven
[16:14] now here's Abraham
[16:16] the only evidence that is God that God
[16:18] has given him this promised son
[16:21] the one that is waited so many years for
[16:24] him he has the evidence now
[16:26] when God given him the Commandment to go
[16:29] up with thy son and sacrifice him
[16:32] and now he's going to destroy the
[16:34] evidence
[16:35] but he was obedience
[16:38] in the word of God
[16:40] because why he knew he's God
[16:44] Abraham had a personal relationship with
[16:46] his God
[16:47] and he knew that this is not man
[16:50] he knew that this God is a supernatural
[16:52] God
[16:54] and he was obedient to God
[16:57] and said
[16:58] that in blessing I will blessed thee and
[17:01] in multiplying I will multiply that seed
[17:04] as the stars of the heaven
[17:07] and he has the son which is upon the
[17:09] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[17:14] gates of his enemies amen amen and in
[17:19] thy seed shall all the nations of the
[17:23] earth be blessed because thou has obeyed
[17:28] my voice
[17:30] a man obedience is better than sacrifice
[17:34] yes
[17:40] aren't you glad that we are part of this
[17:42] Royal scene amen that come to Jesus
[17:45] Christ which was part of Abraham amen
[17:49] and he saved him die seed
[17:52] are you included in that seed amen amen
[17:54] shall all the nations
[17:57] of the earth be blessed because thou as
[18:01] obeyed my voice
[18:04] you're the man with a covenants yes
[18:07] yes because before this in the scripture
[18:09] prior to that God is going to visit in
[18:12] the first time and give him a cover God
[18:14] call him firstly out of the land that he
[18:17] was in
[18:19] and you are to go into a Strange Land
[18:21] and he was obedient to say call yeah I'm
[18:24] saying man God called in for a total
[18:26] separation
[18:27] firstly from all the unbelief that he
[18:31] was separated from
[18:32] and because he could separate himself
[18:34] from all unbelief God will bless him
[18:38] and then God bring them to another land
[18:40] and then God gives him another
[18:42] visitation and makes a covenant with you
[18:47] amen and when God makes that Covenant
[18:50] with him he was typing Jesus Christ amen
[18:53] because that sacrifice that was put
[18:54] there and part in two and what a
[18:57] covenant means God was gonna make an
[19:00] agreement with him in a binding
[19:01] agreements yes an agreement that he
[19:04] himself cannot break amen
[19:07] and then it was separated when Jesus
[19:09] would be on the cross and his body is
[19:11] torn apart amen for you and I that Amen
[19:15] to that sacrifice God and make the
[19:17] continued the Covenant amen amen amen
[19:21] and when Abraham made a covenant God
[19:24] what was the instruction out there to be
[19:26] circumcised yes
[19:28] everyone that comes under the Covenant
[19:31] must be circumcised amen that is why we
[19:36] don't need those uncircumcised people to
[19:38] take our inheritance the inhabitants are
[19:40] falling upon the Earth God blessings are
[19:43] still upon the Earth because of the
[19:45] circumcise amen but the blessings fall
[19:48] under the rainfall on the just and the
[19:51] unjust amen the unjust I enjoying your
[19:54] blessings will blessing the men for you
[19:58] but they take these blessings and they
[20:00] want to say God did this for me see I
[20:02] prayed for this God bless me with a cow
[20:04] God bless me with a job God bless me
[20:07] with a house but when they change God's
[20:08] word
[20:09] no they will not be like Abraham to obey
[20:13] God at his words
[20:15] but there will be a people upon the
[20:17] Earth amen is supersede yes amen that
[20:20] will rise up in his last days amen amen
[20:23] and she will also come on the ministry
[20:26] amen because why there to be another
[20:27] patriarch in this day yes
[20:30] another one with a seven-letter words
[20:34] amen another one with the ending with
[20:37] the ham amen amen better to come on come
[20:41] on this Earth and through the Royal seed
[20:43] comes for this ministry yes
[20:47] and he goes that sowing amen let's see
[20:50] and in the last days she comes up she
[20:53] brings to life amen
[20:55] and she's that supersede so he's
[20:57] speaking on this morning the Seed of
[21:00] Abraham are settled upon thus said the
[21:04] Lord amen
[21:06] amen
[21:08] in other words
[21:10] out of God's word she doesn't do
[21:12] anything else yes
[21:14] because why the message is coming today
[21:17] not to make you a church member
[21:19] the message didn't come to make you add
[21:22] to a number in the church yes
[21:25] the message has come the opening of the
[21:28] word has come the Seven Seas have been
[21:30] revealed those seven times not in their
[21:32] voices for once
[21:34] so that you can be awakened out of
[21:36] spiritual Amnesia to make you recognize
[21:39] your position in Christ all right
[21:42] to make you recognize Who You Are
[21:46] and it comes so you let's supersede can
[21:50] be manifested in this hour amen
[21:53] and he says and in thy seed shall all
[21:57] the nations of the earth be blessed now
[21:59] I want to take debt and take Revelation
[22:02] 10 18 11 that thou must prophesy again
[22:05] before Nation turned and Kindred amen
[22:08] and kings
[22:11] what is happening now
[22:12] out of you preaching the gospel the true
[22:15] gospel yes everybody else is in
[22:18] spiritual famine yes yes amen scrambling
[22:21] around for spiritual food trying to eat
[22:24] up the garbage bins yes
[22:26] and they're trying to find some
[22:28] inspiration that's why we got only a
[22:30] fourth anointed one yes trying to give
[22:33] them some inspiration
[22:35] hmm
[22:36] but you the nation of the earth when you
[22:39] give me blessed through you amen the
[22:41] fact that you hear now the rain falls on
[22:44] the just and the unjust yes
[22:46] Every Nation upon the Earth is only
[22:49] being blessed to you yes amen God the
[22:52] angels of God are holding those wings
[22:55] those wins for what for Wars amen yes
[22:59] two walls that passed behold the third
[23:01] world coming quickly it's about we are
[23:03] now going to bring the world on the
[23:05] brink of World War III amen but what's
[23:07] all in the wind what's oppressing this
[23:10] forces
[23:12] it's because you're upon the Earth amen
[23:15] and this right now the world cannot go
[23:18] on any longer
[23:20] man and destroyed marine life he's
[23:23] destroyed botany life he's destroyed the
[23:26] atmospheres
[23:28] um
[23:29] the world right now is a convergence the
[23:32] world is in birth pains yes he was
[23:34] waiting for this hour
[23:36] because this is the hour when the super
[23:38] city is being manifested amen
[23:41] this is the hour when a super seed has
[23:43] come and brought forth fruit in this
[23:46] hour
[23:47] it's it's the hour now when she shall
[23:49] possess the gates of the enemy amen yes
[23:53] amen and as we take from Abraham's life
[23:59] the problem of God says now Abraham was
[24:01] just an ordinary man he wasn't a super
[24:03] duper somebody
[24:05] people looked at him at that time he was
[24:07] an ordinary man
[24:09] just like every other man
[24:12] wasn't something special yes
[24:14] God never called him as far as we have
[24:17] any record until he was 75 years old
[24:19] [Music]
[24:21] so the rest of his life
[24:23] he was an ordinary man to everyone else
[24:26] his wife which was his sister being 65
[24:30] years old at the time
[24:32] they had probably lived together since
[24:33] they were very young
[24:36] and she was Barren and Admiral children
[24:38] the god called a complete separation
[24:42] to separate himself from the rest of the
[24:44] world and from all of his people
[24:47] and from all of his kindred
[24:50] there was a special thing for him to do
[24:52] nothing that remind you of your life
[24:55] a God had to call you from wherever you
[24:58] was
[25:00] before you receive this message
[25:02] and you had to separate from all those
[25:04] things yes and then as you come in you
[25:08] have to further separate from the spirit
[25:09] of leadership
[25:11] that Spirit has even creeped into the
[25:13] message now yes right
[25:17] if the Lord carries any longer
[25:20] and the years go by
[25:22] you'll you won't make the difference
[25:24] between message sisters and the people
[25:26] of the world or even message brothers
[25:27] and the people of the world right
[25:29] because the generations get weaker but
[25:32] for the election
[25:34] the day shall be shortened amen amen
[25:39] and we find that the world is tripping
[25:41] in it's creeping into every home he's
[25:44] creeping to every household
[25:46] but what will make you difference
[25:49] is the Covenant yes yes
[25:52] the Covenant is not lying upon you
[25:55] amen God is Not relying upon you he's
[25:58] right upon what he already made the
[26:00] Covenant that he made amen amen and you
[26:02] have to accept that by faith amen yes
[26:05] your entire walk is my feet yes
[26:09] the Lord was having a shadow of things
[26:12] to come speaking about Grace which is a
[26:14] greater thing
[26:15] and which comes through the Royal seed
[26:18] and then we received Jesus Christ now we
[26:21] walk by faith
[26:23] amen we are living the fact that we are
[26:25] yeah they can believe this message
[26:27] purely by grace
[26:31] amen
[26:32] and right until we receive this word we
[26:34] was buried
[26:36] amen you believe that yes
[26:39] and because God will close the womb
[26:42] maybe he was in the denominations
[26:44] maybe he was in the Hindu World wherever
[26:46] you're going God had to close that
[26:49] spiritual room to ensure that no seed
[26:52] gets thrown in there amen
[26:55] he won't let what happened in the Garden
[26:57] of Eden happened to this elected right
[27:00] he found you you before the foundation
[27:03] of the world
[27:04] while Abraham was in Babylon
[27:10] he already knew that he had to bring him
[27:13] to the promised lands that was not the
[27:15] land for him yes before knew you he knew
[27:19] that no other seed could be planted in
[27:21] there yes
[27:22] yes that's why you were barren
[27:24] but there had to come a time of life
[27:26] amen
[27:30] because Sarah
[27:32] had to conceive at a specific time they
[27:36] had to be a visitation yes but before
[27:39] the conception there had to be a name
[27:41] change
[27:43] amen and you couldn't have the name
[27:46] change sitting in some denomination
[27:47] sitting in some organization amen amen
[27:51] you had to be obedient to the voice of
[27:53] God
[27:55] you have to come
[27:57] under thus said the Lord
[28:01] and when you come forth amen
[28:04] and then you began to conceive
[28:06] conception to place you began to receive
[28:09] of the word
[28:11] he said be not to me Lord according to
[28:14] Thy Word
[28:16] conception to place
[28:19] but she was buried before that and thank
[28:21] God you were barren
[28:23] because why
[28:25] if he wasn't buried it means you would
[28:27] have wrought for denomination you will
[28:29] denominational seed would have been sold
[28:31] in there Europe brought for
[28:33] denominational fruits
[28:35] but she was preserved
[28:37] because there was a covenant amen thank
[28:39] you amen you have to be preserved amen
[28:44] now God called a complete separation to
[28:47] separate himself from the rest of the
[28:49] world and from all of his people
[28:52] and from all of his Kindred there was a
[28:56] special thing for him to do and when God
[28:59] expects you to do a special thing he
[29:02] demand a complete separation from any
[29:04] doubts
[29:07] right
[29:08] this is the hour where we need to take
[29:10] God in his word yes amen this is our way
[29:13] we are so convinced Mary is so convinced
[29:16] by the scientific civilization
[29:20] that is very hard for man to have faith
[29:24] we're living in a hour that man is that
[29:26] men would rather believe what a doctor
[29:28] says
[29:30] what an intellectual intelligent people
[29:32] of the world tell them
[29:35] but let a spiritual man come there and
[29:37] give him the word of God
[29:39] you wouldn't want to accept it because
[29:41] because of him
[29:43] he wants to accept something with
[29:45] intellectual words yeah
[29:47] and that is why you find even in
[29:49] preaching even in a message if someone
[29:52] comes with an intellectual way of
[29:53] bringing the word people rather follow
[29:55] them
[29:56] even in the message
[29:58] people rather someone can explain the
[30:01] word what intellectualism
[30:03] someone can buy other scriptures someone
[30:06] can can give you the proper Greek
[30:07] pronunciation yeah
[30:09] I would rather have a man come at an
[30:11] inspiration of the Holy Ghost under the
[30:14] leadership of the Holy Ghost and under
[30:16] the anointing of God and preached under
[30:18] inspiration amen
[30:21] because what everyone does say the Lord
[30:23] amen amen
[30:27] amen if you are thoroughly convinced if
[30:31] you are converted if you receive the
[30:33] Holy Ghost
[30:34] and you come under the true anointing of
[30:36] the word of God because that's what the
[30:38] mess that's what the seven times come to
[30:40] do yes
[30:43] it comes to take you out of that sex
[30:45] body into the world body
[30:48] amen come you take you out of The reigns
[30:50] of the Mortal to the immortal
[30:55] that's what this word come to do
[30:57] come to make you change Dimension from
[31:00] here from the Earthly to the heavenly
[31:06] the prophet of God says and when God
[31:09] expected to a special things it demands
[31:11] a complete separation from any doubts
[31:15] if you've got any doubts you want to say

[37:16] ugly body to another body amen
[37:20] amen amen because why you are so jealous
[37:22] in this land like Abraham amen
[37:25] we are searching for another land
[37:29] now watch now
[37:32] nothing happened but still Abraham held
[37:35] on he was not discouraged he never
[37:39] staggered at the promises of God through
[37:41] unbelief
[37:42] but was strong giving praise to God
[37:45] year by year as it went by No Doubt many
[37:49] critics come by and said Abraham father
[37:51] of nation how many children do you have
[37:54] now he didn't stagger him
[37:57] only
[37:59] how many of you already in the message
[38:01] I've had this maybe a family that told
[38:04] you how many years are you talking about
[38:05] a Rapture how many years are you talking
[38:06] about the coming of the Lord
[38:10] but did you stag it
[38:12] no you went stronger
[38:15] amen you and you you your roots went
[38:18] deeper yes
[38:20] and you began to grow up more firmer in
[38:23] the world Amen more solid in the world
[38:25] more mature in the world you didn't
[38:28] stagger you began to become upright
[38:30] until now you began to speak and
[38:33] prophesy directly to them we have just
[38:36] saved the Lord and there's coming in our
[38:38] when there's going to be a resurrection
[38:40] that's coming in over when I'm gonna
[38:42] have a body change that's coming over
[38:44] with destruction is coming upon here but
[38:47] I'm gonna be gone amen amen amen
[38:54] oh
[38:55] remember when Noah was in the ark
[38:58] he didn't see before he goes into the
[39:01] heart he didn't see a sign of any dark
[39:03] clouds coming yes
[39:05] he didn't say a sign of lightning
[39:07] flashing
[39:09] no
[39:11] only when the doors were shut
[39:14] yes amen then the weather the atmosphere
[39:18] has began to change amen
[39:22] but he believed it by faith
[39:24] amen
[39:27] and he was obedient to God
[39:30] so year by year he went by No Doubt many
[39:32] critics come by the Abraham father of
[39:34] nation how many children do you have now
[39:37] that didn't stagger him no child in
[39:40] Sarah was passed the time of life or
[39:43] bearing children because Way Beyond
[39:44] menopause
[39:46] but still Abraham believed God just the
[39:48] same
[39:49] look at this now this is the step of
[39:51] Faith now he made preparation for the
[39:53] baby
[39:55] are you making preparation for the
[39:58] departure amen
[40:00] amen you're speaking about the Rapture
[40:02] but you're living like you stuck upon
[40:03] the Earth
[40:05] are you planning to depart but you you
[40:08] want to be EarthBound
[40:10] are you planning to depart but you want
[40:12] to build your kingdom upon the Earth
[40:15] how can you talk about being a Rapture
[40:17] but your life doesn't have just too many
[40:19] how about a Rapture when you stuck with
[40:21] all the people of the world every day
[40:22] you're stuck with all the problems you
[40:24] stuck with a little seeing issues
[40:27] why don't you speak like you're from
[40:30] above amen amen why don't you speak like
[40:32] you like you're hearing from another
[40:34] source
[40:35] because that's what you're hearing from
[40:36] amen
[40:39] because you are now seated in every
[40:41] places in Christ Jesus and if you've
[40:44] seen it in Heavenly places in Christ
[40:45] Jesus it means you are receiving from
[40:48] another source
[40:54] so he made preparation because he knew
[40:57] when it was fully persuaded that God
[40:59] could not make a promise that he wasn't
[41:01] big enough to back up
[41:04] you see to think the same thing
[41:07] regardless of how unreal it seems
[41:11] how unnatural it seems to the mind
[41:16] God cannot make a promise that he is not
[41:20] big enough to take care of Amen you
[41:23] worry about little things
[41:24] you worry about what food you can eat
[41:27] you worry about clothes you've been away
[41:30] you go you worry about your the future
[41:32] of your career and your job
[41:34] you think God is that big enough to take
[41:36] care of those things
[41:40] you think you you're serving a finite
[41:42] God
[41:45] you serving an infinite God rich in
[41:48] Mercy
[41:49] he said he is Jehovah China my provider
[41:56] he is able to open his window of heaven
[41:59] and pour out his blessings upon you
[42:01] and if he could feed the children of
[42:04] Israel in the wilderness
[42:07] here we could take care of Elijah in the
[42:10] cave
[42:11] maybe he could take care of that with a
[42:13] woman behind closed doors in the house
[42:17] oh no that is how much more he do for
[42:21] you
[42:25] you think God is not able to multiply
[42:28] that her so that wallet that you have
[42:32] um
[42:32] how many everyone ever took your word
[42:34] and literally prayed over you and said
[42:36] Lord let this wallet never run dry
[42:40] how have you had the faith to do that
[42:46] that's the type of thing we should be
[42:48] having
[42:50] it why are we limiting the god that we
[42:53] have
[42:54] with the same God looking at the Mount
[42:57] of Olives and he looked at the mountains
[42:59] there and he said if you say to this
[43:01] mountain be thou removed and plucked
[43:03] into the sea it shall be done
[43:08] did Jesus not say that
[43:12] he said
[43:14] how unnatural it is to the lesser man
[43:17] how foolish it is rather to the Natural
[43:19] mind it doesn't make a bullet difference
[43:23] if God said so that's it amen and here's
[43:28] the code here's what we're talking about
[43:29] this morning and the Seed of Abraham are
[43:32] settled upon thus said the Lord yes that
[43:36] settles it
[43:39] we find out at 25 years later
[43:43] no children and still God was faithful
[43:46] to keep his promise to Abraham
[43:49] for Abraham believed God the little boy
[43:52] came on the scene
[43:54] little Isaac
[43:56] so his message the prophet goes off to
[43:58] see in 1965.
[44:00] the message goes around the world
[44:03] but you ought to be an hour
[44:06] where does body have to be manifested
[44:09] amen
[44:10] that that food was stored up but they
[44:13] had to be an hour where this body of
[44:16] Christ will be manifested upon the Earth
[44:20] and when she raised up that supersede
[44:24] she will rise up to that soup to become
[44:26] that super Church

[45:06] other Army

[45:13] Covenant before them amen amen and they
[45:17] the the people of the world

[45:29] themselves
[45:31] when the children of Israel and can't
[45:33] talk about them
[45:34] even though they had this powerful World
[45:36] they were shaking within themselves

[47:44] even give him a second thoughts you say
[47:46] sorry amen I see this thing from Genesis
[47:49] I see the entire picture now amen where
[47:54] I see the old thing made plain to me yes
[47:56] amen this is no longer a mystery amen
[48:00] amen amen there was a time when he was a
[48:03] mystery but now it's made plain yeah
[48:08] I'm the manifested word in this hour and
[48:10] now I'm here to possess the gates of the
[48:13] enemy amen thank you Lord
[48:16] thank you amen yes amen he says
[48:23] you know
[48:26] so you God put him on a double chest he
[48:29] said after being now with 115 years old
[48:31] or 20 Abraham was and he said I want you
[48:34] to take this your only son
[48:37] and take him up to the mountain you see
[48:40] everybody said your only son yes God
[48:43] only recognizes those in his Cosmos yes
[48:46] and God so loved the world
[48:49] that he gave his only begotten son amen
[48:52] what world
[48:54] the cause mother no he's on Cosmos his
[48:57] own world those that were in his
[48:59] thoughts before the foundation of this
[49:01] world
[49:03] that's the world that God loves don't
[49:05] let everyone come and tell you no God
[49:06] loves everybody
[49:08] God loves his own amen yes
[49:11] God is not going to love the devil God
[49:14] is not going to love serpency he knows
[49:15] who they are
[49:22] you don't love this worldly world he
[49:25] loved these worlds his perfect world
[49:27] Amen
[49:30] then after he said
[49:33] your only son God when he recognize the
[49:36] seed amen and take him up to the
[49:39] mountain
[49:40] that I will show you and they offer him
[49:44] up on this mountain for a sacrifice
[49:47] in other words destroy every evidence
[49:49] that he had that the promise would be
[49:51] fulfilled that's taking away all the
[49:53] natural things you see God was showing
[49:57] in Ibraham how he was going to bless us
[49:59] amen he was showing how Jesus was going
[50:01] to come and now he was going to
[50:03] sacrifice his only begotten son for you
[50:06] and I amen that truly we might have life
[50:09] and have it more abundantly and through
[50:12] him to the Royal seed we will be blessed
[50:15] amen we will be a blessed people we will
[50:18] have a covenant
[50:20] we will have all the blessings of Gods
[50:24] and Abraham said I received him as one
[50:27] from the dead and I'm fully persuaded
[50:30] that he was able is able to raise him up
[50:32] from the dead amen Abraham was convinced
[50:35] that he wasn't going to kill him but he
[50:38] was also convinced that in my old age
[50:40] when I couldn't have children
[50:42] I was good at that said I was good as
[50:44] dead but we had a child
[50:47] God is able to raise him up amen if God
[50:50] can do that to us because remember
[50:53] before Isaac come
[50:55] the mysterious thing took place
[50:58] that no church world can tell you about
[51:00] it
[51:01] see no Theologian will tell you about
[51:03] yeah amen he took a profit yes to come
[51:06] in this day and show you
[51:08] the sign that you are now seeing
[51:12] upon the Earth Discerning the hearts of
[51:15] the people telling them who they are
[51:17] where they come from
[51:18] that sign was done one time in the Bible
[51:23] showing him brought them to the Adrian
[51:25] time he said that was the last Shrine
[51:26] before the destruction
[51:29] for them
[51:33] they showed it again in Son of Man
[51:34] Ministry this price but yeah he's
[51:37] showing it before the destruction of
[51:38] Sodom
[51:42] um
[51:43] foreign
[51:50] then she had to have a presentation
[51:53] the heart was designed and then they
[51:56] added body change
[51:57] amen amen yes it was a sign remember my
[52:02] day was the shadow
[52:05] and this is our way the people the
[52:07] people greater than the shadow amen upon
[52:10] the Earth
[52:10] if the Shadow and the people of the
[52:13] Shadow can be blessed how much I see men
[52:16] when they were given for example
[52:20] how much more the blessings of God upon
[52:22] us now amen
[52:26] so he says that I am fully persuaded
[52:28] that he is able to raise him up from the
[52:29] dead that's the people now the seed of
[52:32] Gabriel
[52:33] because he raised us from the Deads we
[52:37] were dead in sin that trespasses
[52:40] and the devil thought he could destroy
[52:43] this Royal seed
[52:44] every time God wants to bring forth to
[52:47] see the devil wants to destroy it
[52:49] in the time of Moses he did that
[52:52] before
[52:53] Adam could fly could speak the word and
[52:56] bring forth his reproduce after himself
[52:59] he went to Eve then before Moses comes
[53:03] on the scene because he already told
[53:04] Abraham
[53:05] that your people's in a journey there's
[53:07] a journey in a Strange Land but I will
[53:09] send him a deliverer
[53:10] so before the deliverer comes the team
[53:12] the devil does the Lord of scripture
[53:14] the devil wants to now come and destroy
[53:16] the sea
[53:17] but God revealed to Moses parents that
[53:20] he wasn't a normal child amen they had
[53:23] to have a visitation from the angel of
[53:25] God
[53:25] he showed that he was was cut out for a
[53:29] specific purpose
[53:30] and God preserved Moses for a Ministry
[53:33] he did the same thing when Jesus comes
[53:35] on the scene he wants to destroy that
[53:37] Royal seed amen
[53:39] but God preserved him amen
[53:41] and then he come and walked through the
[53:43] church ages try to destroy the seed
[53:47] but in every age God sent forth and
[53:50] messenger what a message to captivated
[53:52] seed and once they received that word
[53:55] they conceived he was no longer buried
[53:57] in an age they conceived in their age
[53:59] amen amen and they were kept away yes
[54:03] until in this day there was the people
[54:06] upon the Earth
[54:08] and God had to come in preserve us for
[54:10] his name's sake and we had one from the
[54:14] dead raised up again the spiritual body
[54:16] of Jesus Christ upon the Earth for two
[54:19] thousand years the world will never see
[54:20] the hand of God like you did until the
[54:23] days of the prophets
[54:27] they never beyond the prophet in this
[54:29] day
[54:30] they never saw all these things taking
[54:32] place
[54:33] all these people that went out with the
[54:36] healing revivals it was first the
[54:38] prophet they saw it in the prophet
[54:39] Ministry and that spearheaded the
[54:41] healing Revival
[54:45] it was his ministry that took off
[54:47] he never saw things taking place like
[54:50] this since Bible times yes
[54:55] and this now was done in math around the
[54:58] world this the prophet went around the
[55:00] world
[55:02] he began to see the supernatural God
[55:04] again God became God God was pulled out
[55:07] of History
[55:08] amen God became little God to the people
[55:12] because why he was manifesting God
[55:14] before the people
[55:17] and just like in the upper room
[55:19] when the disciples were there about 120
[55:22] of them
[55:23] and the pull of fire separated himself
[55:25] among each of them into cloven tunnel of
[55:28] Fire
[55:29] and each one was enjoyed with power from
[55:31] an eye for service amen just like that
[55:34] to pull out fire now is moving amongst
[55:36] and many women dried amen because she's
[55:39] endured with power from an eye for
[55:41] service man amen so what the power of
[55:44] God can be manifested through our life
[55:48] amen that she can be walking on the
[55:50] earth drawing Garden of History again
[55:53] making God little to the people amen yes
[55:58] and when the people see you and they see
[56:00] God manifesting through you God is
[56:02] becoming tangible to them
[56:06] you see what what the responsibility
[56:08] there is upon the bride
[56:11] I just you can go to a person and Speak
[56:13] Life to them
[56:16] mm-hmm
[56:18] and that's the people down the seat of
[56:20] Abraham because he raised us from the
[56:22] dead we were dead in sins and trespasses
[56:24] and he was able to change my mind change
[56:27] my thoughts change my nature change me
[56:29] all over he can do as he pleases
[56:31] whatever he says I believe in the church
[56:34] and every Seed of Abraham believed the
[56:36] same thing
[56:37] amen
[56:38] amen Hebrews 11 8
[56:47] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[56:50] God into a place which he should after
[56:53] receive for inheritance obey him and he
[56:56] went out not knowing whether he went by
[56:59] faith he saw John in the land of promise
[57:01] and in a strange country dwelling in
[57:05] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob
[57:09] you see this
[57:11] he was drowning with
[57:13] the Tabernacles in temporary places
[57:18] for he looked for a city
[57:21] which air Foundation
[57:24] whose building and making is gone amen
[57:27] through faith also
[57:29] Sarah a cell perceived strength to
[57:32] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[57:35] child when she was past aged because she
[57:38] judged him faithful word promised amen
[57:41] therefore spring there even one even of
[57:45] one even as good as dead so many as the
[57:48] stars of the sky in multitude and as a
[57:51] sand which is by the sea show
[57:54] innumerable these all die in faith not
[57:57] having received the promise
[57:59] but having seen them afar off
[58:02] and we are persuaded of them and
[58:05] embraced them and confessed that they
[58:08] were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth
[58:12] for they that say such things declare
[58:15] plainly that they seek a country
[58:18] and truly if they had been mindful of
[58:20] the country from whence they came out
[58:22] they might have an opportunity to have
[58:23] returned in other words Abraham could
[58:25] have returned back to where he came from
[58:27] but he was searching for this country
[58:31] for the city which had Foundation that's
[58:33] why he was just pitching of kids
[58:34] dwelling temporarily take his family and
[58:37] move take his family and move
[58:40] but one day he met the king of that City
[58:43] amen
[58:45] amen he met him
[58:50] when he met him that country became a
[58:53] reality to him amen and he knew that all
[58:56] of you see my Souljah
[58:59] must go to that City and he knew that
[59:02] when we come to his time of his death
[59:04] he's going to go to that City
[59:06] because he already met the king of that
[59:08] City amen
[59:11] amen and we had one in this day
[59:14] amen another one with a seven-letter
[59:17] word
[59:18] that go and visit the city
[59:21] this literal Place amen he literally
[59:25] went there amen and he goes he comes
[59:28] back and testifies amen
[59:31] this is the temporary joining place
[59:35] you are now in The Pastels but in my
[59:38] father's house
[59:39] amen there are many mansions there's
[59:42] Better Bodies amen there's another
[59:44] Immortal body waiting for you amen
[59:47] amen you are dying daily you are
[59:49] decaying daily but there is an eternal
[59:52] City there is a better body waiting for
[59:54] you
[59:56] a body that cannot corrupt a body that
[59:59] kind of age amen
[1:00:02] whoa I he said he saw the people in the
[1:00:05] prime of the youth amen
[1:00:12] we find that Abraham did the same thing
[1:00:15] and every child of God will do the same
[1:00:17] thing amen
[1:00:22] so what did you desire he said he
[1:00:24] civilian making his God a Heavenly
[1:00:26] country
[1:00:27] they are Desiring an immortal land amen
[1:00:31] we are designing any mortal land amen
[1:00:34] that's why you can't find yourself
[1:00:35] comfortable on the Earth
[1:00:37] right now
[1:00:39] like as the eagle stood up the nest
[1:00:42] you are becoming uncomfortable
[1:00:45] this world system that you are now
[1:00:47] dwelling in is becoming uncomfortable
[1:00:50] for you
[1:00:51] he will be if it's become comfortable
[1:00:54] for you and you're enjoying your life on
[1:00:56] your thing we are living a good life on
[1:00:58] the Earth
[1:01:00] it is something wrong with you amen
[1:01:03] foreign
[1:01:08] our Lord
[1:01:10] even now come Lord Jesus amen
[1:01:14] you can see now
[1:01:15] from 2019 we are telling the way to
[1:01:19] 2020. and we said the world is not going
[1:01:21] to be the same and the world we can see
[1:01:24] it as a different Junction of time
[1:01:26] you can see now that we're turning now
[1:01:28] to a different Corner amen yes
[1:01:31] you can you can't go back to what you
[1:01:33] want you can see it
[1:01:36] even unbelievers can see that something
[1:01:38] is different upon the Earth
[1:01:40] you can see
[1:01:42] the world governments how they changed
[1:01:44] it overnight
[1:01:46] you can see you can see the politics you
[1:01:49] can see even in Israel they got a new uh
[1:01:51] Benjamin Netanyahu is back now in power
[1:01:54] and you can see in Britain what happened
[1:01:55] you can see in other nations what
[1:01:57] happened you can see
[1:01:58] even in USA
[1:02:01] when the Republicans become empowered
[1:02:03] this guy fighting might not even know if
[1:02:05] he's going to be impeached so a lot of
[1:02:07] things are taking place right now that's
[1:02:09] right
[1:02:10] because why this Kingdom of this world
[1:02:12] must crumble that's right
[1:02:15] but he's also getting the state is also
[1:02:17] being set for the Antichrist system to
[1:02:19] take complete control of the Earth
[1:02:22] so if all is he's taking place
[1:02:25] and if Satan is moving in his time slot
[1:02:27] and moving fast
[1:02:29] how much more the bride should be moving
[1:02:31] in daytime amen how much more relevant
[1:02:34] we should be in the tower yes amen amen
[1:02:37] instead of worrying about what Satan is
[1:02:39] doing and he is in his Eden let's
[1:02:42] concentrate on what we should be doing
[1:02:43] in our purpose our purpose is searching
[1:02:46] for that City whose building and making
[1:02:48] God our purpose is to make the Rapture
[1:02:51] so we should be conditioning ourselves
[1:02:53] to make the Rapture amen amen amen we
[1:02:56] should be in a lecturing condition amen
[1:02:59] we should be a mature Church working
[1:03:01] upon the Earth we should be a church
[1:03:03] that know what our promises are a church
[1:03:06] that know whatever inhabitants are
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:10] and a church that can declare plainly
[1:03:12] our promises declare plainly who our God
[1:03:16] is plainly what are God has done for us

[1:03:35] got into the holy of holies into the
[1:03:38] secret Chambers amen and you come now
[1:03:40] you are sealed away into Christ
[1:03:44] you are so locked up into Christ that in
[1:03:47] the midst of this little CNA in the
[1:03:49] midst of grass Darkness you can keep the
[1:03:52] word amen because why you have given an
[1:03:56] overcoming power in this age amen you're
[1:03:58] flying above all the foods flying above
[1:04:02] all the demon powers that are filtrated
[1:04:04] the entire world right now
[1:04:06] because this world right now demon
[1:04:09] Spirits upon the Earth demon Spirits are
[1:04:11] powering upon mankind but the also aware
[1:04:15] that you are here
[1:04:16] they say these people here

[1:04:32] word of God
[1:04:34] amen

[1:04:37] you need to be fortified by the word

[1:08:12] I don't look what I'm saying is look at
[1:08:15] things
[1:08:16] with our spiritual life
[1:08:18] this is our way we should walk with our
[1:08:21] spiritual eyes open amen
[1:08:24] because you're working with people that
[1:08:25] are influenced by demon Spirits you are
[1:08:28] you are associating every day
[1:08:31] with people that are influenced by the
[1:08:33] devil you realize that
[1:08:35] if you believe that those demons are
[1:08:37] upon the Earth manifested him because
[1:08:40] the demon the only time the demon can be
[1:08:42] manifested is through a body
[1:08:44] they have to work through a body amen
[1:08:49] and if they are working through a body
[1:08:51] we are associating with them right so
[1:08:55] you've got your discern the spirit yes
[1:08:57] amen you've got to have discernment in
[1:08:58] this hour and how are you going to have
[1:09:00] a discernment if you've got a life that
[1:09:02] you don't separate yourself with God
[1:09:04] if you haven't come up Ayah and locked
[1:09:07] away into the inner Veil where you are
[1:09:09] in the presence of God Alone
[1:09:12] if you don't have God walking with you
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:15] if you don't have a personal
[1:09:16] relationship with God then you are
[1:09:18] walking in the flesh yes right
[1:09:21] because this is our way should be
[1:09:23] circumcised you should be half the Holy
[1:09:25] Ghost we shall be led by the spirit of
[1:09:28] God they that the sons of God are led by
[1:09:30] the spirit of God Amen
[1:09:34] amen you know I think we had this
[1:09:36] meeting that the brother was preaching
[1:09:38] here that that night and the anointing
[1:09:39] was so strong
[1:09:41] and the next morning I was at work
[1:09:44] and somebody came to me
[1:09:46] and they came in a distressed boy I just
[1:09:48] said this is deserving the person of
[1:09:50] distress and they're giving me the story
[1:09:51] this lost their mother and now as soon
[1:09:55] as the mother died the daughter was in a
[1:09:57] coma
[1:09:57] because the daughter was so used to the
[1:10:00] mother and she was also a doctor and she
[1:10:01] ended up in a coma in Johannesburg and
[1:10:03] he was stressed understood and he just
[1:10:05] give me so I said no let's stop talking
[1:10:07] now
[1:10:09] I said now you need God
[1:10:11] there's only one person that can
[1:10:12] intervene I stopped him I didn't want to
[1:10:15] listen to anything more negative and I
[1:10:17] just began to pray
[1:10:19] the next time I met him he told me no
[1:10:21] his daughter is fine she's not a diploma
[1:10:23] there's nothing that I did but I'm
[1:10:25] talking about just
[1:10:27] giving heed to that position that you
[1:10:29] have
[1:10:30] being conscious of that at that time
[1:10:32] when God has asked me to do something do
[1:10:34] it
[1:10:38] when God wants you to do something do it
[1:10:41] I should go pray some other time yeah or
[1:10:43] I'll leave for another time in that
[1:10:45] moment when God wants to do something do
[1:10:47] it amen
[1:10:50] to what the spirit is telling you at
[1:10:51] that time be led by the spirit of God
[1:10:53] and I just held his end and I prayed and
[1:10:56] I left the God so next time I met him
[1:10:58] when you're telling me in the testimony
[1:11:02] and mind you this is the person
[1:11:05] can almost believe the message
[1:11:08] because his old church or half of the
[1:11:10] church ends up in the message
[1:11:12] and he was the one that left behind but
[1:11:14] I even took him to the voice of Her
[1:11:15] Library the first time when I went to
[1:11:17] the voice of my library I took him with
[1:11:19] me
[1:11:20] so it was an opportunity for him to see
[1:11:22] and the way the power of God is now with
[1:11:25] the children of God Amen that believe
[1:11:26] this message amen now that's not for me
[1:11:29] to see but that godmother could have had
[1:11:31] that opportunity
[1:11:32] for him to witness
[1:11:34] that God
[1:11:37] is working in this message amen amen
[1:11:41] because why we don't serve a god of
[1:11:42] History amen amen the message didn't
[1:11:45] stop it or the healings and all didn't
[1:11:47] stop in the days of William Brennan
[1:11:50] the same God of William Branham is here
[1:11:52] today amen amen because we have believed
[1:11:55] this message of William Branham yes
[1:11:57] yes and we have accepted him as the
[1:11:59] prophet of birth yes we accepted him
[1:12:01] that God used him and even God will use
[1:12:05] that redeemed body to manifest himself
[1:12:07] Amen in Son of Man Ministry amen
[1:12:12] yeah
[1:12:13] nobody walked in this day
[1:12:17] and their comfort walked amen
[1:12:20] nobody can come and testify we have even
[1:12:22] signs picturing taking picture of the
[1:12:25] pool of Fire
[1:12:27] science can even testify of that
[1:12:30] yes
[1:12:32] but yet the people rejected
[1:12:34] they're so random but Kelly it's hard to
[1:12:37] Fathom now that you believe it because
[1:12:38] it's revealed to you if not to fed them
[1:12:40] how people have seen the supernatural
[1:12:43] they've seen paradoxes I mean people
[1:12:47] without eyeballs receiving eyes they
[1:12:50] didn't even have those eye sockets but
[1:12:52] they received iron whatever color they
[1:12:54] wanted they've seen the dead rails
[1:12:58] they've seen a person that will speak to
[1:13:01] the storm out of existence
[1:13:04] things like that
[1:13:06] the pillar of fire there in the meetings
[1:13:09] people pronounce to be with cancer mom
[1:13:13] was about to die and then come with
[1:13:15] healing just too many years
[1:13:17] they've seen all that
[1:13:19] people that he never saw before he could
[1:13:21] discern the hearts tell them where they
[1:13:22] come from tell them what they did one
[1:13:24] one after the other
[1:13:27] and there after the false prophets went

[1:13:31] impersonators because first came Moses
[1:13:33] then came jealous in Germany amen first

[1:14:13] not meant for everybody yes and for a
[1:14:15] special class of people
