[1:44] quarter
[1:45] of all the evidence that we've already

[1:55] Sovereign God Sovereign choosing
[1:57] God's Sovereign Grace of how he wants to
[1:59] reveal these things

[2:03] phenomenal there's too much available
[2:04] amen amen is that even he didn't even
[2:07] give you a quarter
[2:08] of all the evidence that we've gathered
[2:10] thus far

[3:17] thy way is in the sea and I part in the
[3:20] Great Waters and I footsteps are not
[3:23] known

[3:27] revealed to this is unlocking these are
[3:31] mysterious things that is unlocking now

[3:35] encrypted in scripture amen his
[3:38] Footprints are encrypted
[3:41] and only he himself can come and reveal
[3:46] it to you amen amen so his Footprints

[3:51] because he's in he's doing everything
[3:53] amen amen yes amen everything that we
[3:56] see is according to his blueprint amen

[4:46] for the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a
[4:48] man that is an householder
[4:50] which went out early in the morning to

[6:46] season ago

[6:50] and show us what it means in the hour
[6:52] that we're living in Lord
[6:53] we're done looking at a time in the day
[6:55] going by but we want to look here

[7:17] pray and ask it now in Jesus name amen
[7:20] amen Chloe go back to the same structure
[7:23] again
[7:24] we see that
[7:26] he says for the Kingdom of Heaven is
[7:28] like unto a man that is an householder
[7:30] which went out early in the morning to
[7:32] hire his laborers in the vineyard amen
[7:35] and see each time he's asking that he's
[7:37] looking at them standing idol God
[7:38] doesn't like anybody standing either yes
[7:40] amen amen amen God like liberals he
[7:45] wants you to be a laborer in his
[7:46] Vineyard we don't want you to be
[7:49] standing either
[7:52] and he went about the third hour and so
[7:54] understanding either in the marketplace
[7:56] and said unto them go yeah also into the
[7:58] vineyard and whatsoever is right I will
[8:00] give you when they went their way
[8:02] now if you turn your Bible quickly to
[8:04] the books of Acts chapter 2 verse 14.
[8:08] X 214
[8:11] .
[8:17] he says but Peter's standing up with
[8:19] with the 11 lifted up his voice and said
[8:23] unto them a man of Judea and all ye that

[8:47] experience to see the baptism of the
[8:49] Holy Ghost
[8:50] they would they were to carry there they
[8:53] had to wait there until they were
[8:55] enjoyed with power from one eye
[8:59] and the Saint Peter that denied Jesus
[9:02] the Saint Peter that was afraid to be
[9:04] identified with Jesus he is now standing
[9:07] boldly
[9:09] and proclaiming the same Jesus amen
[9:12] amen because why he's endured with power
[9:17] amen
[9:19] verse 5 of that scripture and again he
[9:21] went out about the sixth and ninth hour
[9:24] and did likewise
[9:29] so you can see he's working
[9:31] amen amen is working
[9:34] from the day of Pentecost he's working
[9:36] all the way through all this
[9:41] now if you take the scripture Matthew 27
[9:44] 45 and put it there let's look at
[9:46] Matthew 27 45.

[11:22] called us amen amen he is the one he's
[11:26] the one that called us to work in his
[11:27] Vineyard
[11:29] he's the one that called us because he
[11:32] said all that the father has given to me
[11:34] will come unto me
[11:37] which one of us can say about our own
[11:39] intellect by our own intelligence that
[11:42] we better understand what was happening
[11:44] in this hour
[11:45] amen but God had a selected people
[11:48] scattered all over in all the nations
[11:51] amen amen amen
[11:53] death
[11:56] in his 11th Hour
[12:00] he could call the people out amen
[12:03] so we're speaking this morning
[12:05] on the 11th Hour workers called under
[12:09] the third pool amen amen amen because we
[12:12] know the first two fools couldn't call

[12:17] fish amen amen the first two pool was
[12:19] calling small fish yes yes amen you was
[12:23] a rainbow trout
[12:25] took a special type of fishing to call
[12:27] you out amen amen this couldn't be a
[12:31] public show yes you may hear what
[12:33] brother Eden said there's certain things
[12:35] here we can't play out there amen that's
[12:38] right there's certain things that is
[12:40] Sovereign amen God in his Sovereign
[12:43] choosing will divinely reveal it unto
[12:47] you yes and that's God Sovereign
[12:49] choosing yes amen and a certain thing
[12:51] when he came to the third pool
[12:54] the angel said the prophet you can't
[12:56] teach these things yes you can't teach
[12:59] Pentecostal babe these things amen
[13:01] people have to come up to a certain
[13:03] level amen there's a special class of
[13:05] people that need to hear these things
[13:07] amen yes that's why you finally even
[13:10] when I was first came in the message I
[13:12] tried to win everybody for Christ
[13:16] and we go we we we're taking them to
[13:18] slip and see taking them to also this
[13:20] all to the things that we've heard in a
[13:22] message expecting them to to be
[13:24] rejoicing with us yeah
[13:27] but he takes a special class okay to
[13:30] receive this thank you Lord amen the
[13:33] makeup
[13:34] the gene of God already had to be in you
[13:37] amen
[13:38] you already had to be part of the vine
[13:41] oh thank you Lord one day they came to
[13:43] the prophet and said tell me something
[13:45] so all these other churches this church
[13:47] world they're producing these things
[13:50] are they influenced by what are they
[13:54] influenced by the sectors of the vine
[13:56] he's speaking about the sacrament of
[13:57] divine amen he said no then he was
[14:00] telling them no no the drawing from the
[14:02] same life yes but they cannot produce
[14:05] the same fruits amen
[14:11] amen because of you today upon the Earth
[14:15] because you are becoming appointed time
[14:17] in the season God at the sin of the
[14:19] prophets yes amen and from that same
[14:22] Reign that was falling there to be
[14:24] people like Billy Graham Arnold Roberts
[14:27] going out to Sodom yeah
[14:29] drawing from the same Vine but they
[14:32] produce their own denominational fruits
[14:34] yes
[14:35] because there wasn't of the original you
[14:38] are part of the original amen you will
[14:40] have to produce only of the original
[14:42] amen
[14:44] in all these years they could hide the
[14:47] seed yes but they cannot add the food
[14:50] because now is the time when the fruit
[14:52] is on the tree in the time of the
[14:54] lettering every now this time amen the
[14:57] fruit is on the tree
[15:00] and therefore in this hour
[15:04] it is it was in this hour there to be
[15:06] the falling away yes there will be a
[15:09] shaking up of the tree and everything
[15:11] that is not of it had to come out amen
[15:16] amen
[15:20] so we find that in this 11th Hour
[15:24] a people is called out yes now what
[15:27] these people are associated with
[15:29] Mark 11 23 amen amen amen because that's
[15:34] that Mark 11 23 is the third full
[15:37] scripture amen amen hallelujah amen open
[15:41] to

[16:10] yes that those things which he said
[16:13] shall come to pass he shall have
[16:15] whatsoever he says amen yes Hallelujah
[16:19] it had to be stored in there at Mark 11
[16:23] 33 It's associated with 11th Hour
[16:26] workers amen because he's the third pool
[16:29] scripture amen and that's why he
[16:31] couldn't preach this until the time of
[16:35] the thakur amen
[16:37] amen under the first to pull he couldn't
[16:40] Bridge it yes
[16:42] he was walking in it yes yes hallelujah

[16:50] whether where you have identified who
[16:53] you are in the scripture and now you are
[16:55] working under this third pool amen at
[16:58] one stage he was prophecy that there
[17:00] will be a people yeah
[17:02] but you are now not prophecy you are
[17:05] walking out of that scripture amen amen
[17:11] amen there's too much of vindication now
[17:15] to deny that this is that amen that
[17:18] which William Graham spoke of
[17:21] amen
[17:24] amen yes thank you
[17:27] let's also turn our Bibles too because
[17:34] let me just give you this quote here
[17:41] look for the quote not the seventh
[17:43] Angels message
[17:48] and uh
[17:53] recognizing your daily message
[18:00] from paragraph to YouTube
[18:04] now the seven angels message
[18:07] is to open the mystery of the seals
[18:10] calling the leaven our Gentile workers
[18:13] to receive the same pay
[18:16] that the first workers got amen amen
[18:20] now Jesus taught it he said there were
[18:23] some people who went into the Harvest
[18:25] they were hired
[18:26] when they did off early in the morning
[18:28] they received a time of penny for the
[18:30] day and then a new time someone else
[18:31] came in and went to work and then in the
[18:35] 11th hour that's the last hour of the
[18:37] today
[18:38] the 23rd up amen amen that someone come
[18:43] in and receive the same kind of pay that
[18:46] they did at the first of the day last
[18:48] hour
[18:49] it so perfectly how the first
[18:52] our messages with the word with the
[18:55] gospel with the truth they came in at
[18:57] the day of Pentecost
[18:59] then there was a dockage that blocked
[19:01] them out
[19:02] then at the middle of the day do then
[19:04] Wesley then and then came in and then
[19:07] there is to be an evening time message
[19:09] amen and to receive the same thing
[19:13] that they did at the beginning
[19:16] the evenings are messy to stop back to
[19:19] bring back that same thing again amen
[19:23] they were sealed with the Holy Ghost
[19:25] in the first day
[19:27] first is the same Holy Ghost must come
[19:31] and seal you yes amen hallelujah not a
[19:34] different Holy Ghost
[19:36] then the that's why he said they will
[19:39] write another book of Acts yes
[19:41] now watch this
[19:46] at the 11th Hour the 23rd hour
[19:51] these people are called but who's
[19:52] calling them out
[19:55] the prophet came preached a message but
[19:56] who's going who went around and said
[19:58] I'll run this Trail again amen yes
[20:01] to call it in the 23rd hour to call the
[20:04] 11th Hour workers
[20:07] the angel of the Lord amen amen
[20:17] amen who was the one that called you
[20:21] to give you your true identity
[20:25] amen
[20:27] what did the seven titles come to do

[20:48] certain way
[20:50] the entire world system your educational
[20:52] system is alive
[20:57] because it's designed to make you think
[20:59] in a certain way it makes you think
[21:02] according to the world agenda
[21:04] do you know that and that is why
[21:06] education is always changing yes because
[21:09] each time they change the the methods of
[21:13] education is to make you think according
[21:15] to the world's agenda
[21:19] why do you think you got all these
[21:21] feminist movements in our love yeah it's
[21:23] all in your education system

[21:38] the media to the mainstream media they
[21:41] make you believe things a certain way
[21:43] yeah
[21:45] yeah and then they lie to you they keep
[21:47] putting emphasis on global warming
[21:49] global warming and all these things but
[21:52] when you really do a research on it
[21:54] you'll find that they got another agenda
[21:56] behind it
[21:57] they're pushing money they're pushing
[21:59] all these things
[22:04] they make you understand life in a way
[22:06] that you didn't understand
[22:08] but
[22:09] the angel of God comes to make you
[22:10] understand your misunderstood life amen
[22:13] he comes to give you skill and
[22:15] understanding yes amen he comes to give
[22:17] you a true identity yeah
[22:21] yeah that you thought your you were you
[22:24] were just there you're by your mother
[22:25] and father your mother and father was
[22:27] just there to produce the Earth body
[22:30] that because you needed a body to dwell
[22:32] in yes you are a supernatural being amen
[22:35] you needed a body
[22:36] and at a certain time and season
[22:39] dare to be carriers of the seed and then
[22:42] that body had to come forth on the Earth
[22:46] but
[22:48] your identity
[22:50] wasn't that human identity
[22:53] you are a supernatural being amen amen
[22:57] when the word came in make you realize
[22:59] where you truly come from amen
[23:02] and yeah you are grumbling oh I'm just a
[23:05] person living around here I've got a
[23:07] simple job and I can't make it in life
[23:10] but when you come to realize that God is
[23:13] your father Yes amen
[23:16] you're talking about if a person born in
[23:18] the royal family a child born in royal
[23:20] family he's not worried about money
[23:21] you know he belongs to the royal family
[23:23] a person born in one of the areas or
[23:27] something born in The Bolognese children
[23:28] they're not worried about money
[23:31] they're not worried about all these
[23:32] things because they know all these
[23:33] things are taken care of
[23:34] how about you yes amen when you come to
[23:37] have the two identity that you have the
[23:39] dean of God and you men that you always
[23:42] was part of God hallelujah that you
[23:44] never just began here amen that you was
[23:47] part of God
[23:51] in the back part of God's mind he took a
[23:53] profit to go there yes
[23:57] yes amen now when you when these things
[24:00] when when these things are made known
[24:03] unto us then it gives us a perfect faith
[24:06] it makes us live in a world of perfect
[24:08] Faith because it shows us through the
[24:11] scriptures amen
[24:21] that's why the scripture says Ephesians
[24:23] 4 30 and Grave not the holy spirit of
[24:26] God
[24:28] whereby your seals amen until the day of
[24:32] redemption
[24:33] if the first workers were sealed
[24:37] if the oil from Pentecost they were
[24:39] sealed at every age they were sealed
[24:41] away
[24:42] so you are sealed receiving the same pay
[24:46] as them amen
[24:49] but you need to identify who you are
[24:52] amen because right now
[24:56] the angel of God is a daily fight in
[24:58] this hour in this Third Exodus
[25:01] that while Israel is going to the
[25:04] Homeland natural land you are in your
[25:06] homeland of the Holy Ghost amen and it
[25:09] is the angel of God that is leading you
[25:12] while you are thinking you in your
[25:14] darkest hour you don't know what to do
[25:16] it is
[25:17] in you
[25:19] the property in the darkest hour that
[25:22] Jesus came
[25:24] he will drive out all these in your life
[25:26] amen you're not
[25:29] natural genocide revised and so forth
[25:32] but 200 million demons are upon the
[25:35] Earth influencing mankind
[25:38] their Spirits all over
[25:41] you know you're actually walking around
[25:44] and you're talking to people but you
[25:45] don't you need to have spiritual yes
[25:48] I used to realize that people are
[25:49] possessed with their powers amen if you
[25:52] hear people talking and you are the
[25:54] things that they are saying
[25:56] you will under you're able to contact
[25:58] the spirit right
[26:00] you said if you spend more than five
[26:02] minutes on someone they don't contact
[26:03] the spirit
[26:04] then you need to really get the Holy
[26:06] Ghost and have discernments to contact
[26:08] what type of spirit that people got yes
[26:13] and you'll see
[26:14] that those spirits will not
[26:17] cannot stay wrong with you
[26:19] if you don't talk about God it's fine
[26:21] but if you if you speak about the things
[26:22] of God
[26:24] they can't stay long with you yeah
[26:28] yeah but man is gone so insane he's
[26:31] imagining all of all things that even
[26:34] you say and human cannot imagine because
[26:37] why is in because of the imagination of
[26:39] his heart and the influence of demon
[26:41] power upon him is now giving to
[26:44] everything
[26:46] that is ungodly
[26:55] now he says
[26:57] in the message
[26:59] the mark of the beast and the seed of
[27:00] God
[27:02] paragraph 51.
[27:06] he says now notice
[27:09] he's talking about now he's talking
[27:11] about uh the world war one now right
[27:13] talking about the world war the first
[27:14] World War
[27:16] he said all the nation Ally Gathering
[27:17] and he was writing on the decline of the
[27:19] first World War
[27:20] so I was wondering what happened how
[27:23] does war stop now
[27:24] he said nobody knows today whoever made
[27:27] the issue of peace
[27:30] he said no General City
[27:32] said he didn't do it but notice how
[27:34] strange it was
[27:36] now watch this now we're talking about
[27:37] World War one now
[27:39] this is World War one ended suddenly you
[27:42] know
[27:43] it was on November the 11th
[27:47] at 11 o'clock in the day
[27:50] in the 11th day of the month
[27:52] [Music]
[27:55] in the 11th
[27:57] in the 11th month in the year and in the
[27:59] 11th Hour of the day and 11 minutes 11.
[28:04] he said what was it
[28:07] he said watch did it
[28:09] God issue when fought all the Four Winds
[28:13] amen wins win means why and strife now
[28:17] we know World War one was 1918.
[28:21] and it stopped right there on the 11th
[28:23] Hour
[28:24] because remember Jesus speaking of the
[28:26] 11th Hour people
[28:28] and the one that come in on the 11th
[28:30] Hour
[28:33] so what was happening here World War One
[28:35] Stop mysteriously why dare to be stopped
[28:40] because God had to deal
[28:42] at that time God had to deal with the
[28:44] Jews it was kept in All Nations
[28:46] but even from 1918 till 1946 that's when
[28:50] the angel of God came in the cave in
[28:53] 1946
[28:54] the angel of the Lord appeared
[28:57] visibly to the prophet Town amen
[29:00] appeared in this Dimension where he
[29:01] could see him and and talk to him
[29:04] appeared to him in a cave in 1946 and
[29:06] gave him his commission at the same time
[29:09] he is being commissioned he's telling
[29:11] him now but Israel is becoming a nation
[29:14] danger of the Lord
[29:16] what was that Naomi coming back in the
[29:19] Homeland after World War II
[29:21] and so we find that
[29:25] the reason is that to be done because
[29:30] I go there let's turn to the Book of
[29:33] Revelation verse 10 chapter 10.
[29:37] let's read that very slow
[29:39] Revelation 10 verse
[29:42] 8-11
[29:48] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[29:50] spake unto me again and said go and take
[29:53] the little book which is open in the
[29:55] hand of the Angel would stand upon the
[29:57] seed upon the Earth
[29:59] and I pray that we've been laboring on
[30:03] this scripture for many years now I pray
[30:05] that you identify yourself
[30:08] with the scripture amen let's take into
[30:10] the book
[30:11] I pray you don't just look at that as a
[30:14] symbol and John taking the book and you
[30:16] have to see yourself that John is part
[30:17] of the Bride
[30:20] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[30:23] him give
[30:24] he said unto me take it and eat it up
[30:26] and he shall make that belly bitter but
[30:29] it shall be in their mouth sweet as
[30:30] honey and I took the little book out of
[30:31] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[30:34] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[30:37] soon as I eat in it my belly was bitter
[30:39] look at verse 11 now
[30:44] here's a lemon hour working
[30:46] why is on Lebanon he said unto me thou
[30:49] must prophesy again amen
[30:51] before many people and nation and
[30:55] tongues and King
[30:57] you see that wage
[30:59] fit perfectly in the scripture that
[31:01] you've got to work to do Amen in the
[31:04] 11th Hour in the 23rd hour before
[31:07] midnight
[31:08] it so there's a quick short work
[31:13] amen you don't have much time left amen
[31:16] amen there's a quick short work for you
[31:18] to do yes yes there in verse 11 and he
[31:22] says prophesy again amen but for many
[31:26] people and nation and tongues and kings
[31:30] do not stay idled do not check from your
[31:33] responsibility amen so wait there until
[31:37] you enjoy with power from an eye
[31:39] and then that is why the Holy Spirit has
[31:43] taken us from from step onto step yes
[31:47] amen where did you take us first back to
[31:50] repentance amen when you take us back to
[31:52] the altar amen back to consecration yes
[31:55] amen back to prayer back to wait wait
[31:59] for what till he enjoys with power from
[32:02] an eye
[32:03] and then when he drops down which is
[32:06] already doing right now amen then he
[32:09] will give you the ability to operate the
[32:11] gift within you amen
[32:13] and then you will go out with bonus
[32:15] because what happened to the first
[32:17] Pentecostal church when they began to
[32:19] Proclaim Christ when he came out of the
[32:21] upper room boldness Came Upon them amen
[32:23] no fear upon them none of them was
[32:26] worried about whether they should save
[32:27] his life or not
[32:29] because you realize that this life was
[32:31] just a temporary life yeah
[32:34] and therefore we are not here to build
[32:36] our Empires upon the Earth because
[32:38] everything around here is temporary yes
[32:41] amen
[32:42] amen do you know that man is trying to
[32:44] seek intelligence and say I've got this
[32:46] degree I got this qualification but what
[32:49] you don't realize
[32:51] soon that qualification will be nothing
[32:53] yes right do you know now people they
[32:56] have identified people Joshua was
[32:59] telling me people have been doing their
[33:00] phds
[33:02] master's degree to artificial
[33:03] intelligence in fact our University
[33:06] Center sent us a warning the other day
[33:09] and they got now a software that can
[33:12] pick up
[33:13] if we have used artificial intelligence
[33:16] in time because matters become lazy now
[33:18] dependent on the artificial intelligence
[33:20] because it's more intelligent than men
[33:22] so you think
[33:24] you understand what I'm saying you he's
[33:26] trying to acquire this as soon as I say
[33:28] we don't need your degree we don't need
[33:29] that the computer you've got no more
[33:31] knowledge than you yeah
[33:33] yeah but thank God for Spiritual wisdom
[33:36] amen it supersedes the wisdom of man
[33:38] amen the wisdom of God supersedes the
[33:41] wisdom of man because intelligent men
[33:44] can't understand simple things yes
[33:47] amen he still doesn't know where he
[33:49] began from how does that begin he's
[33:52] still trying to fed him death
[33:54] he's still trying to he's still trying
[33:56] to fed them what happened in
[33:57] inexperiment yes yes yeah how the
[33:59] pyramids were Bulls
[34:01] but all his secret was revealed to us
[34:03] amen
[34:05] they are so caught up in the system they
[34:07] don't realize that Rome is controlling
[34:09] all his world powers and they don't
[34:11] realize us all these economies are gonna
[34:13] soon crash
[34:14] and what is happening around that
[34:16] everything is controlled
[34:17] but it must happen
[34:20] and it must come a time amen the why is
[34:24] the holy spirit taking us to this
[34:25] because they're coming a time where
[34:27] you're gonna have to now
[34:29] you don't know what to do you don't have
[34:30] you have me amen you're gonna have needs
[34:34] you're gonna have a need for medication
[34:35] but you can't get it you're gonna have
[34:37] to speak the word that's right amen
[34:39] you're going to need for finance you
[34:41] don't know what to do with it there's
[34:42] gonna be a need for it amen amen and
[34:44] you're going to speak it yeah he's
[34:46] preparing us for the time amen yes
[34:54] now he says now there have been sorry it
[34:57] is quoting
[34:59] in the message they're recognizing your
[35:00] day and his message
[35:03] 62. now they had been scattered blinded
[35:06] and are far in the third day you see it
[35:08] they were scattered from Palestine
[35:10] throughout the world they were blinded
[35:12] to reject the Messiah and now they have
[35:14] been gathered in their own land ready
[35:16] for the trumpet to recognize the
[35:18] atonement
[35:19] so let me so remember now
[35:22] we have a very short work to do yes
[35:25] yes and they showed you there in
[35:26] Revelation 10 8 to 11 Dharma prophesy
[35:28] again amen what follows after Revelation
[35:30] 10 8 to 11 the 11th birth it goes to
[35:33] Revelation 11. amen watch in Revelation
[35:36] 11 it's Moses and Elijah coming down yes
[35:40] to call out just to preacher the Jews
[35:43] yes
[35:45] because why
[35:47] we were called under it seven seal amen
[35:50] and they are called under that seven
[35:52] trumpets yes what did seven some would
[35:54] cause them to do
[35:55] to recognize to come to the Feast of
[35:56] atonement to recognize the atonement to
[35:59] recognize the Messiah that was rejected
[36:04] yes amen therefore you find now
[36:07] that is why for this quick short work
[36:08] you find here now
[36:10] the angel of God suppressing the powers
[36:12] the earth and the Sea yes suppressing
[36:15] the power because they got the atomic
[36:17] Powers amen they got everything to
[36:19] escalate into their final world war
[36:21] three
[36:23] nothing else is stopping them the only
[36:25] thing that's stopping them is the Angel
[36:26] of the Lord amen because we are here and
[36:29] amen
[36:31] and we find that
[36:32] all is part of when when World War One
[36:35] stopped in 1918 it was because
[36:37] God had to also seal their Jews amen and
[36:41] eventually he had to use
[36:44] Mussolini Hitler Stalin to get them back
[36:49] into their Homeland
[36:51] and therefore all those things were used
[36:53] to get the Jews back into the Homeland
[36:55] the start of this Russian war what came
[36:58] out from
[37:00] what was one of the things that was seen
[37:02] to die from the spirit
[37:04] that the Jews was going back
[37:07] amen why every time you mention a war
[37:10] this major was now the Jews is World War
[37:13] One Jews are going back World War II
[37:15] Jews going back coming to world war
[37:17] three Jews are going back yes amen
[37:21] you see what I'm saying
[37:26] so on this Exodus on this Third Exodus
[37:30] Journey
[37:31] amen
[37:33] some
[37:34] have gone
[37:36] Souls under the altar gone off the scene
[37:39] but there are people right here now who
[37:41] left who are in now
[37:43] in that land in the land of inheritance
[37:46] amen
[37:47] but they have to now
[37:50] cultivate that land
[37:51] they have to prosper in the land
[37:54] amen
[37:55] because we don't God don't want stagnant
[37:59] Christian amen you know you become
[38:01] stagnant you leave the Holy Ghost
[38:03] outside he said no no I've settled now
[38:06] for message theology yeah I've settled
[38:10] now that I've received this word I'm I'm
[38:12] satisfied
[38:14] that all this world has been opened I'm
[38:16] satisfied we have the opening of the
[38:18] word
[38:20] but what are you doing with it amen
[38:22] you're in the land you're in the land of
[38:24] the Holy Ghost enjoying the word yes yes
[38:26] but are you cultivating the land is the
[38:28] land becoming fruitful yes
[38:30] yeah amen
[38:31] [Music]
[38:33] I say the Jews now in the Homeland
[38:36] waiting for the Feast of trumpets
[38:37] recognizing the atonement and to wait
[38:39] for the coming to mourn for the
[38:41] rejection of the first time they
[38:44] rejected it in the Homeland for that
[38:47] waiting everything is positionally
[38:49] pleased he says that in recognizing your
[38:52] day and message
[39:05] another quote he says now to see whether
[39:08] this message that we got is connected
[39:11] with it or not
[39:12] the very hour
[39:14] for him
[39:15] quoting from the 10 virgins and 144
[39:19] 000 joules in paragraph 94.
[39:22] Telegraph 93.
[39:24] now to see whether this message that
[39:27] means god is connected with it or not
[39:29] they're very hours that Israel was
[39:31] signed in to be a nation is it was the
[39:35] very same hour very same day very same
[39:37] month everything else I was a Green Mill
[39:39] Indiana when that angel there appeared
[39:43] to me and sent me out on the field
[39:46] with this after he had met me down in
[39:49] the river and told me what would take
[39:51] place then commissioned me
[39:54] 11 years later at the same hour that
[39:58] Israel was signing as a nation it's all
[40:00] connected together
[40:02] see the angel of the Lord is on earth
[40:04] now amen he's moving around fixing
[40:07] everything yes amen for the coming of
[40:10] the Lord so he's not only dealing with
[40:12] us
[40:13] he is dealing with politics he's dealing
[40:15] with Nations all those things
[40:17] and it's the same angel that heard the
[40:20] sin when they went down to Sodom yes
[40:25] the father said we've come down to see
[40:27] if these things are so what we have
[40:28] heard
[40:33] now the prophet
[40:36] after
[40:38] the opening of the world
[40:40] and the message was rejected
[40:42] and the people you know he said he could
[40:44] just go away
[40:47] and just live
[40:49] away you know away from the people he
[40:51] was disappointed because all the people
[40:53] stopped giving him invitation Stop
[40:55] opening doors because it was the opening
[40:57] of the world
[40:59] and he just wanted to go be in the
[41:01] wilderness
[41:03] and then one day he had this dream
[41:06] and when he had that he had the dream
[41:11] and uh he saw his brother-in-law
[41:15] who was like you know they call him a
[41:17] bum
[41:19] and
[41:20] by the end of the dream he realized that
[41:22] he was there too because the brother was
[41:23] saying we were saying him you did all
[41:25] this for me
[41:26] you took care of my children and
[41:27] everything now I'm you are here now let
[41:29] me look after him you know
[41:32] and the Lord was showing him
[41:34] that you lost your heart for the people
[41:36] you know
[41:42] and then he realized
[41:45] he said if you stay here you live you
[41:47] lose everything
[41:49] and the Lord rebuked him today and he
[41:51] had to go back
[41:52] amen and do the work of the Lord because
[41:55] he said now till he died he will do the
[41:57] work of the Lord
[41:58] because he said
[42:00] he said but Lord we got you know the
[42:01] opening of the word everything he said
[42:03] no no I must find the support
[42:08] I want to give it to you as he said
[42:26] yeah
[42:29] he said but that was the prop sorry he
[42:32] said
[42:33] you called me to be a prophet I want to
[42:35] live in the wilderness like the prophet
[42:37] you can go to the message
[42:44] standing in the gap paragraph
[43:01] paragraph 121
[43:04] 3120 and I said I don't want to have to
[43:07] live like that want to do something
[43:09] different
[43:10] he said and I want you to live in the
[43:12] world and I want to live in the
[43:14] wilderness like the prophet
[43:15] but I was using my own excuse so I could
[43:17] honest my own good
[43:19] 121 And he said
[43:21] but then what the prophets of the Old
[43:23] Testament
[43:24] you've been called to be
[43:27] there in a much higher office than that
[43:31] he said you have more gifts besides that
[43:36] he said you were called to pray for the
[43:38] sick and to preach the gospel and in the
[43:41] apostolic form
[43:47] people are still looking
[43:51] for one man Apostle to rely on you see
[43:54] what these Ministry was done and in the
[43:56] apostolic form you know of greater thing
[43:58] many great
[44:00] many great gifts he said why do you wait
[44:04] for me to move you every time you move
[44:07] where is your reward
[44:09] you know said do you remember I told you
[44:12] do you remember what brother Robertson
[44:13] told you in your dream in his dream or
[44:15] vision
[44:16] that you had done like Moses you forgot
[44:19] the feeling of your people
[44:20] you forgot the call that I called you to
[44:24] I let the sick lay I want the Lord to
[44:26] tell me where to go and not to that's
[44:28] wrong
[44:29] I had built myself a complex because the
[44:32] people didn't hear my message
[44:34] and God forbid that I'll try to compare
[44:36] the life of Moses like now but it's
[44:39] exactly what Moses did the people
[44:41] wouldn't listen to him when he come to
[44:43] deliver them so he just left them alone
[44:45] and went into the Wilderness but God
[44:47] turned him around and he had long forgot
[44:49] the suffering people
[44:51] and I said Lord I'll put this right with
[44:54] no education with a grammar school
[44:55] education and the people would stand in
[44:57] rows and everywhere to hear the simple
[44:59] gospel
[45:00] the greater now that under the whole
[45:02] Covenant he said on eye and gave gifts
[45:04] unto men Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[45:07] today and forever
[45:10] and he's talking to bully Paul or
[45:12] whatever
[45:13] in 126 he said
[45:16] he said then he's talking about the
[45:17] dream now
[45:18] about having a dream about his
[45:25] and he looked at me kind of he talking
[45:27] about Billy Paul is telling him but
[45:30] and he said oh I want to tell you
[45:32] something I Dreamed a Dream not long ago
[45:34] you remember seeing that guy that looked
[45:36] like me and pledged ask Mother whether
[45:38] you could go you get back to Tucson I
[45:41] told her this dream and Bully there is
[45:43] something happening it's going on now
[45:45] something was talking to me I thought it
[45:47] was you he looked at me kind of strange
[45:49] I waited a little bit we were driving on
[45:52] so a few minutes he went back to sleep
[45:54] and I was driving along thinking about
[45:56] what could that mean driving along
[45:59] Riding Road and all at once he ate come
[46:02] talking to me again and he said return
[46:04] did not I tell you in the beginning to
[46:06] do the work of an evangelist
[46:08] when I called you down on the river did
[46:10] not I say as John the Baptist was sent
[46:12] to forerun the first coming wasn't John
[46:15] more than a prophet Jesus said so
[46:17] himself what to go on to see a prophet
[46:20] more than a prophet then it began to
[46:23] come to me he reminded me again of the
[46:26] people
[46:27] so you see what happened there
[46:29] so what I'm trying to tell you in this
[46:30] now we have the opening of the word I
[46:33] mean you fail the regard enough
[46:35] and we feel that now we we're just
[46:37] waiting now for under our ministry under
[46:39] the third pole but he's saying he's
[46:41] saying to the prophet you are more
[46:43] important more than that all these
[46:45] things are given to you and
[46:47] because you got Pentecost plus amen
[46:50] amen
[46:50] so
[46:52] we can't be satisfied say we got the
[46:55] opening of the world will wait for the
[46:56] Lord to say move
[46:57] but there's other things to do
[47:00] all the gifts to operate in the church
[47:02] all these things are given unto us
[47:04] because he who receive the prophet in
[47:07] the name of a prophet shall receive a
[47:09] prophets reward yes amen
[47:12] amen and some sometimes you feel that we
[47:15] we have an air of ourselves God has
[47:17] shown us all these things and we are
[47:19] saved we wait in the Rapture and we lose
[47:21] the compassion for the loss yes God is
[47:25] speaking to us in this eleventh hour yes
[47:27] this 11th our workers do not lose your
[47:29] compassion for the loss
[47:32] amen
[47:33] yes
[47:34] right till the day go on the cross even
[47:37] on the cross
[47:39] spoke to the game the opportunity for
[47:43] the person on the cross to come with him
[47:44] in Paradise
[47:46] the prophet till they leave the scene
[47:49] amen continued the work of the Gospel
[47:52] tell me where one quote where the
[47:54] Prophet said we must stop going out and
[47:56] evangelizing tell me where the property
[47:58] must stop praying for the sick
[48:00] because we have now I have the opening
[48:02] of the world
[48:03] tell me where he said we must stop it
[48:07] but look at what the Lord said to him
[48:08] but the angel of the Lord said to him
[48:10] you are not just like the normal
[48:11] Prophets
[48:13] amen you are dead but you have all these
[48:15] gifts
[48:17] amen and now all what did Jesus say
[48:21] greater things than this ye shall do
[48:24] amen that's all for the 11th Hour
[48:28] this is for the body of Christ
[48:30] because Christ now is
[48:33] Christ now is represented by a body
[48:37] amen
[48:38] Christ is here on Earth again
[48:40] represented by a body but if the body
[48:43] doesn't produce Jesus Christ then how is
[48:45] the people going to see the power of the
[48:47] Resurrection
[48:48] because that is the testimony of Jesus
[48:50] Christ here he rose again yes there is
[48:53] not dead there is a living God Amen
[48:57] and the testimony of the Resurrection is
[49:00] to say that Jesus Christ is the same
[49:03] yesterday today and forever
[49:15] Unleashed upon the Earth upon people and
[49:19] we're walking around and those demons
[49:21] are not feeling nothing amongst us
[49:23] those demons need to leave
[49:25] you say whatever you bite on Earth shall
[49:27] be bound on every amen whatever you lose
[49:29] an Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[49:34] you're speaking about this
[49:36] guy Danny Henry one time
[49:40] and one day
[49:43] he started to he came to the prophet and
[49:45] he
[49:46] and he just started speaking in tongue
[49:48] he threw his arms around the prophet
[49:50] he said God bless you brother Branham he
[49:51] said I hope this don't sound direct
[49:53] sacrilegious
[49:55] but my way of seeing it that message
[49:57] could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation
[49:59] and when he said that he started
[50:01] speaking tongues amen
[50:03] and a body would never even heard of
[50:05] such a thing because he was a Baptist
[50:07] there by denomination you know the
[50:09] battles don't believe in the gifts of
[50:10] the Holy Spirit
[50:12] and he turned white and looked at me he
[50:14] didn't know what to do these men sitting
[50:17] here was there
[50:19] so you know they will interpret the word
[50:22] what it meant it said
[50:25] now here is what he said because Dao has
[50:27] chosen the narrow part the other way
[50:29] that always walked in your own children
[50:32] now I can see Moses had to make his
[50:35] choice too now that has picked me
[50:37] precise and correct way correct decision
[50:40] and it is my will underline my way the
[50:43] Holy Spirit speaking back yeah
[50:46] so this is not an easy way
[50:49] to come back to the altar again
[50:52] to come back under consecration
[50:55] to come back under his way
[50:57] I'm not talking about I'm talking about
[50:59] the Holy Spirit now
[51:00] under to fall under his way not the easy
[51:03] way
[51:04] is not the easy Road
[51:07] but you got to make the choice
[51:09] each one of us going to make the choice
[51:11] individually amen
[51:13] the pastor might preach it preachers May
[51:15] preach it but they can't make the choice
[51:18] for you yeah
[51:19] in your home your parents can't make the
[51:21] choice for you amen
[51:23] amen you gotta make the choice
[51:24] individually whether you're gonna take
[51:27] this way to go with the Lord despise you
[51:30] because in this way you're going to be
[51:32] mocked
[51:33] I'm talking about now when you got
[51:34] Bowlers now and you prophesied again now
[51:37] in the 11th Hour
[51:40] when you're prophesying of who you are
[51:42] amen where you come from yes what type
[51:45] of people you are
[51:47] and you're walking and you're telling
[51:49] the people what food they're living in
[51:51] the world
[51:52] when you have that bonus you're going to
[51:54] be mocked you're going to be scorned
[51:57] and the coming a time where the living
[52:00] shuttles down
[52:02] because we're going to speak things
[52:04] against the certain condition
[52:07] because right now America becomes you
[52:10] know America is the mouthpiece for Rome
[52:12] [Music]
[52:13] you know what the what what the pope
[52:15] said recently the the gay rights and so
[52:19] forth must be legalized
[52:22] and what is America doing they're going
[52:24] on to other nations African nations and
[52:27] so forth and criticizing them for
[52:29] bringing laws against these things
[52:32] they are forcing their laws onto other
[52:35] nations who don't want to have these
[52:37] things in a country yes amen and while
[52:40] they're doing the treating them with
[52:41] sanctions yeah
[52:43] and they can do that because why who
[52:45] controls all the wealth
[52:48] Rome controlled all the wealth
[52:52] and right now the other nations are they
[52:55] realize that these are ungodly things
[52:58] we don't want these things
[53:00] but they forcing them they're trying to
[53:03] now Flex their muscles and tell them you
[53:05] don't do this
[53:06] we will give you sanctions the
[53:08] indirectly they're telling them we will
[53:10] give you sanctions we won't give you
[53:11] funding and so forth
[53:13] so you see whatever we're living in
[53:16] [Music]
[53:21] now you know the prophet now he was
[53:24] Associated his life
[53:29] in his own life he was associated with
[53:31] God showing this
[53:34] the Seven Peaks amen
[53:37] he saw the mountain and he saw the caps
[53:40] on it the white kept on the mountains
[53:41] amen
[53:45] he said he stopped and looked and he
[53:46] seen seven years
[53:49] he said there were Seven Peaks on top of
[53:50] the mountain
[53:52] one mountain that ran from several miles
[53:55] and he said the last Mountain before you
[53:57] go okay let's go let's get the quote so
[53:59] you can all see it
[54:01] standing in the Gap let's take it from
[54:05] [Music]
[54:11] let's take it from 139
[54:15] telling the gift from paragraph 139
[54:20] he said now when is Billy and I started
[54:23] on down the road
[54:24] started going down the road but he went
[54:26] to sleep again
[54:27] and he and he said I'll give you an
[54:31] everlasting sign yes
[54:36] and I said Lord
[54:37] what I waited a little bit and nothing
[54:39] happened I said what is the Everlasting
[54:42] sign Lord
[54:43] and I waited a few minutes and just did
[54:45] I looked over to see Billy he was asleep
[54:47] and he said I'll give you an everlasting
[54:50] sign
[54:51] he said look Westward from where you're
[54:54] at
[54:55] and I turned my head like this in the
[54:58] trunk in the trunk to look slow down you
[55:01] know and oh my the spirit of the Lord I
[55:04] felt like I could scream and cry you
[55:07] know when the spirit of the Lord comes
[55:08] in you know you know that feeling you
[55:10] can't contain yourself
[55:11] and I looked and I just saw a mountain
[55:14] or white caps on it
[55:16] I said I don't know see no Everlasting
[55:19] sign about that he said your name is
[55:22] wrote all over it
[55:25] okay
[55:26] I thought what is that and I got real
[55:30] weak and I started stopping
[55:32] and Bully raised up and said what's the
[55:35] matter with you and I pulled my my hands
[55:38] like this perspiration dropping off my
[55:39] hand and it's snowing
[55:41] I said bully something is happening and
[55:44] at one time I know we have done wrong I
[55:47] know that I feel God and looked like I
[55:49] could hear that song being sung and see
[55:51] thousands of mixed people lame or blind
[55:53] with it here they call your voice of
[55:56] some great renowned Voice singing
[55:57] unclean unclean the evil spirit drove
[56:00] drove him
[56:01] then Jesus came the capital city I could
[56:04] see the sick line laying everywhere I
[56:06] had to stop bully didn't know what was
[56:09] taking place and I look up and I stopped
[56:11] and I looked up on the mountain and I
[56:13] saw those Seven Hills
[56:14] now yeah if you want to see something
[56:17] there were Seven Peaks on top of a
[56:19] mountain one mountain that ran for
[56:21] several miles the last Mountain before
[56:23] you go into the other country no more
[56:26] Mountains after that and it was running
[56:28] from east to the West
[56:31] the mountain said it was no kept on top
[56:36] the first two small pigs and then a
[56:37] large Peak and then another small Peak
[56:39] and then a larger Peak and then a small
[56:42] Peak and then a great large Long
[56:44] snow-capped Mountain and I said Lord I
[56:47] do not understand what it means he said
[56:49] how many Peaks there
[56:51] I said the seven
[56:53] how many letters in your name
[56:55] seven right
[56:57] and then there was three outstanding
[56:59] Peaks he said those three picks are the
[57:02] first second and third pull
[57:04] yes
[57:06] the first one of your first part of your
[57:09] ministry is smaller
[57:11] in your first pool pretty high
[57:13] you know sign in the hand then there was
[57:16] a little interval in there the time that
[57:19] I was taken off from being too tired
[57:21] many of you remember it and then come
[57:23] the discernment
[57:24] the second port
[57:26] now add another about a few years of
[57:29] just kind of little Peak sea that like
[57:31] in Ministry wasn't here and then come
[57:33] the third one
[57:34] three is a number of completion
[57:39] the third one the next Peak was five
[57:41] names Grace and the next was seven the
[57:45] number of perfection
[57:47] six days shall you labor the seventh is
[57:50] the seventh
[57:51] the end of the week
[57:53] now what he said here after the seventh
[57:56] after that seventh week it was no more
[57:59] Mountains it takes you to another
[58:01] country
[58:02] amen amen
[58:04] the other there's another code where he
[58:06] says
[58:09] it takes you into eternity amen the
[58:12] Continental Divide amen so there was
[58:15] from the last Mountain he takes you to
[58:16] another country
[58:18] in the 11th Hour Work is associated with
[58:21] the third pool amen amen speak to the
[58:25] mountain
[58:26] Amen in that time there's no other pool
[58:30] there's no other Mountain amen
[58:35] because from there it's gonna take you
[58:38] to Eternity amen yes amen
[58:41] amen there's no pool after that this is
[58:44] the hour of the Deadpool amen and from
[58:47] here it takes you now to the land that
[58:51] we all been waiting for amen the land
[58:53] that we're preaching about amen
[58:55] take you from this Dimension to the
[58:57] other dimension

[59:07] rapturing faith amen that's what the
[59:09] seven Thunders come to do to give you
[59:11] rapturing faith
[59:12] because under this third pool comes the
[59:14] opening of the word yeah
[59:17] without Revelation you cannot do nothing
[59:19] yeah
[59:20] without Revelation you might come and
[59:22] believe this message come in you might
[59:23] die you might go under the altar but
[59:26] without whatever without this Revelation
[59:28] you can't have that body change you
[59:31] can't go into the rapture
[59:33] so understandable comes the opening of
[59:35] the word
[59:36] it comes to Spirit speaking to the souls
[59:39] that are lost in prison now
[59:41] because it's our way he that is Holy be
[59:43] holy still he that will be filthy be
[59:45] filthy still and he's also preaching it
[59:49] also to the power of the spoken word
[59:56] that's the hour that we're living in the

[1:02:17] testimonies amen I just dropped this
[1:02:20] with you now in my closing
[1:02:22] I was on my way with the wife to the
[1:02:25] shop
[1:02:26] and the next day we we had a dog that
[1:02:29] was going to come home and this dog is a
[1:02:31] regular dog that we've kept for many
[1:02:33] years and is now very old and it's gone
[1:02:36] very sickly
[1:02:38] so the owner phone my wife and said she
[1:02:40] cannot bring it because it got very sick
[1:02:41] he can't eat he can't drink water it
[1:02:44] cannot pass urine
[1:02:46] and it's just in one place he cannot
[1:02:48] move anything it's just like very sick
[1:02:52] so
[1:02:55] she said she'll bring it the next
[1:02:56] morning though so we were going to the
[1:02:58] shop in the evening
[1:02:59] and suddenly the wife said to me you
[1:03:01] must pray for this dog I said no problem
[1:03:02] we'll pray
[1:03:04] we'll keep it in prayer you know
[1:03:06] she said no no pray now
[1:03:10] I'm driving the car now I'm gonna play
[1:03:12] it now
[1:03:14] then I said okay
[1:03:16] she's asking me this then I felt
[1:03:18] something
[1:03:19] I said I'm not going to pray
[1:03:21] I reminded God about all the things that
[1:03:23] he did
[1:03:24] I reminded him about the apostle
[1:03:26] I reminded him about the squirrel I
[1:03:29] reminded me about the little fishy yes
[1:03:31] but the minority mother's promises
[1:03:34] and then I spoke amen amen
[1:03:37] amen the dog to be better amen
[1:03:42] and we loved it we went
[1:03:44] I think the wife tried to phone the lady
[1:03:46] and then he couldn't get over
[1:03:47] the next morning the lady I was in a
[1:03:50] bathroom I think and dropped him
[1:03:53] imagine the dog was very sick he
[1:03:55] couldn't drink water he couldn't eat
[1:03:56] food throwing up
[1:03:58] couldn't pass urine
[1:04:00] the first thing he did when he came to
[1:04:02] our house he passed Union amen
[1:04:05] the first thing he started working his
[1:04:07] tail then he started eating then he
[1:04:09] started drinking water amen so I think
[1:04:12] she was trying to phone the lady to tell
[1:04:13] her what happened she didn't get all
[1:04:14] about you today and she came on before
[1:04:16] we could get home
[1:04:18] and she saw the dog is perfectly fine
[1:04:22] well I think I took a picture of the dog
[1:04:24] I think we must mention that
[1:04:27] it was a time there right yeah
[1:04:30] okay I think I was I think I was talking
[1:04:33] to brother even telling him the
[1:04:34] Testament
[1:04:35] then while he was telling me the
[1:04:36] testimony of the Joshua said ask him for
[1:04:38] a picture at home they sent me a picture
[1:04:39] why did I send me the picture then he
[1:04:41] identified the time with the picture hmm
[1:04:43] I can't remember now but it was
[1:04:45] associated with the 23 right the time
[1:04:47] was associated with that
[1:04:50] he was sending it to me I mean I just
[1:04:52] sent him the picture of the dog I didn't
[1:04:53] see it he saw it and he sent it to me he
[1:04:56] said did you see this
[1:04:58] and then yeah
[1:05:00] so now the lady took the dog home she's
[1:05:02] and she's the first thing she do she
[1:05:03] thanking God but you don't know what
[1:05:05] happened then the wife was telling you
[1:05:07] what happened
[1:05:08] so you see these are not
[1:05:11] things that we're talking about the time
