[27:51] amen we want you to pull on the word of
[27:53] god
[27:54] amen because your miracle can take place
[27:56] here tonight
[27:57] amen your supernatural experience can
[27:59] take place here tonight everybody has an
[28:02] appointed time this could be our
[28:04] appointed time this evening amen
[28:06] so amen we were talking about the
[28:08] inspiration of the meetings as brother
[28:10] jeff was telling you
[28:13] and no fruit appears on top of the tree
[28:16] everything starts in seed form
[28:19] amen so we come 70 years since
[28:22] the prophet of the age
[28:24] touched durban soil
[28:27] amen and that seed was planted back then
[28:30] we know men like sydney jackson
[28:32] amen
[28:34] men like julia statcliff was
[28:36] instructed to write a prophet visit
[28:38] south africa
[28:39] documented
[28:41] and wrote about the miraculous things
[28:42] that were happening amen so we don't
[28:44] want to forget before we go any further
[28:47] we want to welcome uh
[28:49] we got josephine and
[28:51] we got
[28:52] autumn as well who wants to read you
[28:55] some maybe just a portion of the events
[28:57] that transpired just to kick start the
[28:59] meeting
[29:00] because you know some of us may not know
[29:02] what happened
[29:10] remind you
[29:11] and uh they themselves didn't know what
[29:13] happened till i gave them the thing to
[29:15] read
[29:18] amen
[29:20] so we got a whole new generation that's
[29:21] risen up
[29:24] and we need to tell them amen what the
[29:26] great things the lord has done
[29:35] the most outstanding meetings were held
[29:38] in
[29:42] the meetings were held in the city hall
[29:44] others were held at the gravel race
[29:47] class at the opening service on
[29:50] wednesday evening a mother brought her
[29:53] 11 year old son
[29:54] in a wheelchair she left her boy in a
[29:58] wheelchair
[29:59] up in front where the rest of the sick
[30:02] people were seated
[30:05] herself
[30:16] [Music]
[30:20] she found out the boy had stood up
[30:22] without any help she told him to get out
[30:25] of the wheelchair and try to walk
[30:28] he did and was able to walk for the
[30:31] first time in several years
[30:38] friday night brandon went to town to buy
[30:41] a pair of slippers going into the shoe
[30:44] shop
[30:45] the clog
[30:48] just walking out of the store
[30:50] who had been
[30:52] bought his first pair of shoes in 20
[30:55] years
[30:56] his feet had been so deformed that he
[30:59] was
[31:05] this man received his healing and now
[31:07] his feet were normal
[31:14] amen
[31:16] hallelujah thank you
[31:18] amen
[31:20] so they coordinated that themselves
[31:22] there as you can see
[31:23] amen but out of the mouth of babes amen
[31:25] the truth is told amen what the lord has
[31:28] done amen
[31:30] so we were talking about that and we
[31:32] were so inspired by what happened
[31:34] and when we see a bride in full maturity
[31:36] now
[31:38] amen a bride who recognizes a position
[31:42] recognizes authority amen reproducing
[31:45] the very life of christ
[31:47] amen and that's what christ wants christ
[31:49] wants fruit for himself
[31:51] amen he wants seed for himself he wants
[31:54] his own life to be reproduced in us
[31:57] amen so we thought we'll use this as an
[32:00] excuse
[32:01] to celebrate
[32:02] and thank the lord
[32:04] and give him praise for what he's done
[32:05] for us
[32:06] amen we are not ungrateful people we
[32:09] come to the lord and we say thank you
[32:10] lord for what you have done for us
[32:12] because let's be honest i did not been
[32:14] for this message where would we have
[32:15] been
[32:17] amen trapped in some denomination
[32:20] trapped worshipping idols
[32:22] trapped in some catholic system
[32:24] but the son of man had come to set us
[32:26] free amen hallelujah those spiritual
[32:29] genes that he had in the back part of
[32:31] his mind amen
[32:32] hallelujah they came to maturity in this
[32:35] age so we're thankful for the portion of
[32:37] the bride that he's raised up here in
[32:38] durban south africa and we stand as a
[32:40] testimony and a witness of the ministry
[32:44] of william branham
[32:45] though see that he laid
[32:47] he may not even have been able to maybe
[32:49] never saw a vision of what the full
[32:51] mature church would be but he said the
[32:54] seeds will go out in book form amen in
[32:57] magazines in papers
[32:58] amen it will go out and look what the
[33:00] lord has done so this evening amen we
[33:03] don't waste too much of time we have
[33:04] with us our pastor boytomelo
[33:07] madiba
[33:09] amen let's give him a hand
[33:16] madiba is married with one wife
[33:21] amen he's got three children uh the
[33:24] names are tomisho tobejo and bonello
[33:28] amen so he's married with three children
[33:31] and he started
[33:38] and he's been a pastor since 2008
[33:41] at a church based in wood bank called
[33:44] the lighthouse tabernacle
[33:46] so he's 42 years old
[33:49] and he's a bit younger than me so i just
[33:52] want to tell him i'm his elder
[33:56] amen so we want to welcome him to durban
[33:59] and we give him liberty to preach the
[34:01] word of the lord
[34:02] amen we have not discussed what's to be
[34:04] preached
[34:05] but we said lord as the holy spirit
[34:07] gives utterance give us our portion this
[34:09] evening amen so let's stand together
[34:12] and welcome the holy spirit
[34:15] amen to minister and speak the word amen

[34:47] you got it brother
[35:00] caleb amen bless the name of jesus
[35:05] [Music]
[35:21] until this day
[35:23] no man could tell us
[35:25] just where
[35:29] [Music]
[35:37] but through the eyes of the prophet god
[35:40] revealed to us
[35:43] before god was god all the way the
[35:47] future home
[35:51] new things are being declared
[35:55] [Music]
[36:04] [Music]
[36:07] oh
[36:09] in this new day
[36:13] [Music]
[36:18] amen

[36:25] lord jesus christ
[36:27] are you happy to be here tonight

[36:31] believers
[36:33] it is such a grand privilege
[36:36] i want to greet the ministers who are
[36:38] here
[36:39] together with their wives and i want to
[36:42] greet you sister
[36:43] gengan as well senior and brother adrian
[36:47] and his wife and the elders and the
[36:49] whole church amen
[36:52] it is a privilege to be invited here to
[36:54] come and speak to you
[36:56] uh i always say
[36:59] uh when you i think the sisters would
[37:04] diet is dictated by the body that is
[37:07] within them
[37:09] so similarly spiritually speaking
[37:12] i cannot feed you theology
[37:14] i cannot feel you motivational
[37:18] i can only fit the bright the
[37:20] unalterated word of the living god
[37:23] i mean appreciated the fullness of the
[37:25] weight today
[37:26] so we appreciate the motive
[37:30] and objective of this meeting and just
[37:33] pray
[37:34] i don't bring anything new we just echo
[37:37] what brother branham has already spoken
[37:40] brother branham says if god's lost
[37:42] because she was looking for the new
[37:44] thing
[37:45] but here we are with something tested
[37:47] the word of god
[37:49] how many believe the weight will defeat
[37:51] satan anyway anytime and under any
[37:54] condition
[37:56] the same god that was here in 1951
[37:59] is still here today in 2021
[38:03] amen so god bless you richly i
[38:06] enjoyed the view music my brother
[38:09] i was having a jubilee in the office as
[38:12] you were leading the songs amen
[38:14] shall we bow our heads for prayer
[38:17] gracious heavenly father
[38:19] we approach your throne of mercy
[38:22] acknowledging our insufficiency
[38:26] and acknowledging that you are the
[38:27] almighty god
[38:29] your people are here this evening and
[38:31] they came with expectations
[38:34] because they are got they know that you
[38:36] have never disappointed them
[38:39] even one time
[38:41] dear god there is no disease that is
[38:44] incurable in your presence
[38:46] there is no problem that cannot be
[38:49] resolved in your presence
[38:51] and there is no situation that cannot be
[38:53] subdued in your presence
[38:56] your prophet many a times when he prayed
[38:59] he would say i take every spirit under
[39:02] my control
[39:03] and this evening as the bride of jesus
[39:06] christ we take every spirit under our
[39:09] control
[39:10] for your glory may the holy spirit move
[39:14] in an unhindered way
[39:17] may the sick be healed
[39:19] may there be deliverance is the dear god
[39:22] we are not worshipping a historical god
[39:26] but we are worshiping the ever-present
[39:28] and god
[39:30] you're always with us a dear god and i
[39:33] believe many believers tonight
[39:35] if they were to be given an opportunity
[39:37] they would tell a lot of things that you
[39:40] have done for them brother branham says
[39:43] god never leaves himself without a
[39:45] witness
[39:46] there are many witnesses in the building
[39:48] dear god
[39:50] that can testify about your greatness
[39:53] we sang a song i'm only in this message
[39:56] by grace
[39:57] how many people were with it to be in
[39:59] the message
[40:01] learning the people but it passed them
[40:04] and came to the predestinated seat
[40:07] that's why our hearts are full of
[40:09] gratitude
[40:11] where would we be had it not being of
[40:13] this message
[40:15] how would our families being without
[40:17] this message
[40:19] how would our children have been without
[40:22] this message what kind of ministries
[40:24] would we have without this message
[40:27] this message has elevated us
[40:31] above dear god satan's nonsense
[40:34] and brought us closer to you heavenly
[40:37] father
[40:38] we are not ashamed of this message
[40:41] and i believe ministers that are here
[40:43] tonight when they come to the end of
[40:45] their journey they want to speak like
[40:47] paul of the old
[40:49] i was not a disobedient to the heavenly
[40:51] vision
[40:52] that is the dear god the desire of every
[40:55] brother and every sister we pray for the
[40:58] host the pastor
[41:00] and with his dear wife a dear god and we
[41:03] pray for the whole laity the elder said
[41:05] dear god may you blessed the logistics
[41:09] may the meetings come out the way it was
[41:11] expected a year ago may there be
[41:13] testimony supposed to this meeting dear
[41:16] god maybe there's something moving
[41:19] even among our young people dear god so
[41:22] that they can testify that there is a
[41:24] god
[41:25] who is living dear god we committed the
[41:28] reading of the way to you
[41:30] as a reporter for duty i'm not here to
[41:33] show my skills
[41:34] i'm just yet your god as a mere mortal
[41:38] may you dear god take this body and use
[41:40] it as a vessel that when we come to the
[41:42] end of the service may they all the
[41:44] glory go to you dear god as we commit
[41:47] everything to you in the name of jesus
[41:50] christ and the whole church shall say
[41:52] amen
[41:54] amen
[41:55] as we turn to the book of
[41:58] luke 18
[42:00] i don't know the brother that was there
[42:02] if you can help me i just did the
[42:04] microphone
[42:05] i think people that came before me were
[42:07] taller
[42:09] amen
[42:10] god bless you
[42:12] i i prefer let it be here and then we
[42:15] will sort it out amen become closer yeah
[42:19] god bless you my brother
[42:21] as we turn to the book of luke 18
[42:24] verse 27 i would invite you to read with
[42:28] me if you don't mind or read immediately
[42:30] after me
[42:32] and he said
[42:35] are you all here church
[42:37] let's reach it together and he said
[42:40] the things which are impossible with men
[42:45] are possible with god
[42:48] how many witnesses are in the body
[42:51] in the book of psalms 78
[42:53] from verse 41 it rates in this manner if
[42:58] it has been found just to give you a
[43:00] minute or two to find it psalm 78
[43:04] from verse 41 to verse 43.
[43:14] is it found can we
[43:16] read amen
[43:18] it says yeah they turned it back and
[43:21] tempted god
[43:24] you can read with me
[43:29] and limited the holy one of israel
[43:35] i hope you check it he was not limited
[43:39] he is not at the limited god but they
[43:41] limited him
[43:43] god is unlimited he is limited by
[43:45] people's faith
[43:48] they remember to note his hand
[43:52] i hope as devin won't forget his hand
[43:57] know the day when he delivered to them
[43:59] from the enemy
[44:03] how he had wrought his signs in egypt
[44:09] and his oneness in the field of zohan
[44:15] god bless you richly as you take your
[44:17] seats
[44:23] so this evening i just went
[44:26] amen
[44:27] there
[44:29] a bigger god
[44:31] and he says you can never exhaust god's
[44:34] blessings hallelujah and he says what he
[44:38] has done yesterday he will do today
[44:49] and i think
[44:50] debbie is known for quite a number of
[44:52] things
[44:53] historically
[44:55] the zulus would remember kinshaka
[44:58] and some would visit devin and remember
[45:01] the bani chao
[45:03] there's quite a lot of things that you
[45:04] can remember about devin but the
[45:06] greatest thing that has ever happened in
[45:09] dubin
[45:10] were the meetings that were held by
[45:12] brother brennan
[45:14] that it leaps all the meetings in the
[45:17] history
[45:18] of the church
[45:20] amen so it is quite wonderful for what
[45:23] god has done amen
[45:26] now
[45:27] let me brother just bring this quotation
[45:30] so that we built our foundation
[45:33] in the message if you don't mind i've
[45:35] got some quotations to read
[45:38] hallelujah
[45:39] sometimes the things have got you to go
[45:41] through the weighty filter we live
[45:43] during a time where people speak their
[45:45] minds
[45:46] but sometimes it's best that the god
[45:48] should speak amen
[45:50] and i hope that yes you are there you've
[45:53] got to the way to test amen
[45:56] now brother abraham says in the message
[45:58] of faith once he delivered it to the
[46:00] saints
[46:01] paragraph 24 he says when god called
[46:04] christ from the grave and he ascended up
[46:08] jesus left he waited to his church to go
[46:11] into all the world and preach the gospel
[46:15] these signs shall follow them that he
[46:17] believed
[46:19] science was to follow the church
[46:22] how far unto all the world
[46:26] some people want to limit
[46:28] that limit that faith into a creed
[46:31] someone to limit it to a denomination
[46:34] but i say this upon the authority of
[46:37] god's weight
[46:38] there is no limit to the faith of god
[46:41] that he left for his church
[46:44] because he said all things are possible
[46:47] to them that believe
[46:49] and he says it's not limited
[46:53] do you believe that all things are
[46:55] possible to them that believe
[46:57] folks these signs are supposed to follow
[47:01] the church
[47:02] what god did in 1951 it cannot remain in
[47:06] history
[47:08] hallelujah there's got to be a repeat of
[47:11] that because we've got a new generation
[47:14] that was not there but they've got to
[47:16] see the god of today
[47:19] so that mommy and dad can say this this
[47:21] god what he is doing today is exactly
[47:24] what he did in 1951
[47:27] hallelujah but brother probably said
[47:28] many times people want to limit god
[47:32] and i believe that even
[47:35] on the basis of teachings
[47:37] it depends on how people have been
[47:39] taught some
[47:41] the danger today
[47:42] we can become intellectual about the
[47:45] message but i don't want to become
[47:47] intellectual about the message because
[47:49] when you become just intellectual they
[47:51] see come to church and they go back sick
[47:54] people come depressed they go home
[47:57] depressed
[48:00] hallelujah you cannot come sick and go
[48:02] back sick you cannot come with
[48:09] resources and we still have resources
[48:11] that we can tap you into as a church of
[48:14] the living god
[48:16] hallelujah you must make sure that god
[48:18] is resident in your house
[48:20] you must make sure that god is there
[48:22] with you at your work so that you are
[48:24] able to pinpoint certain things in your
[48:26] life and say this is what god has done
[48:29] and this is what god has done it gives
[48:31] you a credibility as a believer can i
[48:34] have an amen
[48:36] now
[48:38] let us come to this second quotation my
[48:40] brother what does
[48:41] what does thou hear paragraph 70
[48:45] the prophet of god says no matter how
[48:47] much we cry out and think this that or
[48:51] the other
[48:52] nothing can take us until god is
[48:54] finished with us
[48:56] folks the devil will never take you
[48:59] sickness will never take you nothing
[49:02] will take you until god is finished with
[49:04] you you can be short at a close range
[49:07] you'll still survive a gun shot because
[49:10] if god's purpose is not yet fulfilled
[49:13] there is nothing that will take you
[49:16] folks our being here was determined by
[49:18] god and our departure here will be
[49:21] determined by god you don't live here
[49:24] because you are careless you live
[49:26] because it's your time are you still
[49:28] with me here the and at no point in time
[49:31] as we approaching power to satay satan
[49:34] is powerless
[49:36] i say satan is powerless satan has got
[49:39] no power over us satan has got no power
[49:42] over the life of a believer
[49:44] brother brennaman said god's purpose in
[49:46] your life shall never be defeated folks
[49:49] god's purpose in your life shall never
[49:51] be defeated if god designed that you
[49:53] will take a certain path the devil will
[49:56] never stop you
[49:57] hallelujah demons will never stop you
[50:00] can i get an amen on that one and
[50:02] brother branham say i'm glad i'm so glad
[50:05] that you know that and the reason i'm
[50:06] reading this quotation that is somewhere
[50:08] where i'm going because there are people
[50:11] that are expecting brother brahm to rise
[50:13] from the dead and continue with the
[50:15] ministry i beg to differ
[50:18] hallelujah
[50:19] god took brother brennan because brother
[50:21] branham's ministry was done
[50:23] hallelujah we are not waiting brother
[50:26] brennaman to come back as a preacher we
[50:28] are waiting for him to come back with
[50:30] the saints
[50:31] hallelujah but the culture that was with
[50:33] william branham is still on the scene
[50:36] hallelujah willem branham is not on the
[50:38] scene but the god of william branham is
[50:41] still on the scene are you still with me
[50:43] here the devil must never tell you that
[50:45] what happened only happened in 1963 it
[50:49] can still be repeated in 2021 if you
[50:52] have quoted the same level of faith
[50:54] hallelujah
[50:56] now brother branham is preaching here
[51:00] in the message the church of the living
[51:02] god
[51:03] paragraph 84.
[51:05] he says
[51:06] master
[51:08] is in prayer it seems that my life is
[51:11] dwindling away from me
[51:13] i don't know how much longer you have
[51:15] let me be here on this earth but i pray
[51:18] for many years if you can use me
[51:21] but when thou art finished with me
[51:24] may i come to you
[51:26] but i know that i shall be able to stay
[51:29] until i've completed the work that you
[51:32] have for ordained that i sh that should

[53:19] suffered all my life
[53:21] why why did he heal me now he said very
[53:25] profound statement i believe i'll ride
[53:28] this trail again i got to bring a
[53:32] message
[53:33] now people took the phrase i will ride
[53:36] this trail one more time that's why
[53:38] they're expecting brother branham to
[53:39] come on to the scene and i say i beg to
[53:42] differ and i want to demonstrate tonight
[53:45] what this phrase means i shall ride this
[53:48] trail one more time
[53:50] hallelujah in the message and know with
[53:53] it not
[53:54] in that message brother branham
[53:56] a brother speaks to your brother brandon
[53:58] about the dream that he had
[54:00] and in this dream he said brother
[54:01] branham i saw you you were on a white
[54:04] horse
[54:05] and it says that horse looked like a
[54:07] military horse it isn't a message and no
[54:09] with it not you can reference it from
[54:11] paragraph 257 to paragraph 265
[54:15] and it says you were on a white house
[54:18] and it looked like a military horse and
[54:21] say you were moving towards the east and
[54:23] you screamed at the top of your voice i
[54:26] shall ride this trail one more time and
[54:28] it says the whole earth is shook and it
[54:31] says as you were riding towards the east
[54:33] you came across a group of scientists it
[54:36] says they look like they were busy
[54:38] mixing some stuff in the tube and he
[54:41] says you shall i shall write this one
[54:43] more time he said they looked at you and
[54:46] they struck their shoulders and you
[54:48] moved on hallelujah and i say as you
[54:51] moved on then
[54:53] the person on a horse that looked like a
[54:57] mixture of white and black
[55:00] it's an impersonation folks when we
[55:02] speak about a horse we speak about power
[55:04] now brother brahma say well this
[55:07] gentleman says to your brother when you
[55:09] were on that horse this person was on
[55:11] this white hole and he says this person
[55:14] he wanted to trip the horse that you
[55:16] were on but it says this horse that you
[55:18] are on it kept in the line and it kept
[55:21] on marching forward you know what it
[55:24] means folks there is no power that will
[55:26] derail the message
[55:27] i say there is no power that will derail
[55:29] the message the message will go forward
[55:33] no demon will stop this message no devil
[55:36] will stop this message and as a matter
[55:38] of fact no impersonation will stop this
[55:41] message this message will deliver the
[55:44] results this message will rapture you
[55:47] hallelujah
[55:48] and then in that he said
[55:50] you screamed again i shall write this
[55:53] trail one more time hallelujah i want to
[55:57] follow up on that maybe brother can skip
[56:00] the second second one i need to get to
[56:02] the africa vision uh
[56:06] statement
[56:08] brother branham had a vision about
[56:09] africa
[56:11] in this message do you now believe
[56:13] paragraph 27
[56:15] he says and here is what will take place
[56:19] the angel of the lord which come to me
[56:21] and told me to return to africa and he
[56:25] sat me down in africa and showed me a
[56:28] greater meeting than was there at the
[56:31] first time
[56:32] hallelujah
[56:34] many people look at this
[56:37] vision and many say it was not fulfilled
[56:40] and many have left the message because
[56:43] of that but i say they are the poor
[56:46] students of the scriptures
[56:48] hallelujah brother promises when i
[56:51] return back to africa there will be
[56:53] greater miracles than when i went for
[56:55] the first time there is a promise that
[56:58] there will be greater meeting than what
[57:00] happened here in devon
[57:02] hallelujah we'll take it there now the
[57:06] prophet says
[57:08] as we carry on my brother
[57:11] in this message it is the rising of the
[57:13] sun
[57:15] paragraph three five zero he says you
[57:18] all know where i'm going don't you know
[57:21] he says africa
[57:22] i've called you for a long time for
[57:25] years i've tried to get it back
[57:28] now a vision the spirit of the lord has
[57:30] prepared the way
[57:33] they said
[57:34] when those poor natives heard it
[57:37] that i didn't come the last time when i
[57:39] was there they laid on the ground day
[57:42] and night and moaned and cried and say
[57:45] lord what have we done
[57:47] thousands of them those people don't
[57:50] even believe they've got a soul they
[57:52] cried and they moaned and they cry who
[57:54] was he referring to he was referring to
[57:57] our forefathers
[57:59] they hurt the desire that brother
[58:00] branham should come back to africa and
[58:03] you remember the first when he came here
[58:05] he was in johannesburg and brother god
[58:08] said to him you need to get your debian
[58:10] because in devon everyone will have an
[58:13] opportunity to hear you ministering and
[58:16] when he was in jobac it was only a
[58:18] certain class that attended brother
[58:20] branham's meetings but the message of
[58:23] the hour is not for a specific class the
[58:26] message of the hour it is for everyone
[58:28] that believeth and during that time the
[58:30] government of the day did not want the
[58:32] people to meet but god wanted to break
[58:35] the protocol of that day and say i need
[58:39] all of them to be there i need a white
[58:41] brother next to an indian brother i need
[58:43] an indian brother next to a black
[58:45] brother i need them to worship god
[58:48] because this message will be a universal
[58:51] message hallelujah and we know what
[58:54] happened he came here in one just one
[58:57] prayer over 30 000 people got it
[59:00] delivered
[59:01] not a prayer line folks just one
[59:09] young white a man called hallelujah and
[59:12] as they gave a testimony of a young man
[59:15] that was working he was limping because
[59:18] his feet were uneven and they came
[59:20] before brother branham and brother
[59:22] branham laid hands upon him and the
[59:24] young man in no time he no longer limped
[59:27] he walked upright what was happening the
[59:30] gut that can heal was here hallelujah
[59:33] and we saw people the natives they came
[59:36] some of them were blind but brother
[59:38] branham prayed for them immediately they
[59:40] received to their side we know that
[59:42] during that time the ambulances were
[59:45] bringing the sick to the raised course
[59:48] the hospitals were being emptied out
[59:50] there is a deliverance taking place that
[59:53] the whole day but and bring him today
[59:58] in this message my brother
[1:00:04] in the message ashamed of him he says
[1:00:06] this is one of the highest moments of my
[1:00:09] life
[1:00:10] i've waited
[1:00:11] 15 years of this time
[1:00:15] two weeks ago i was under great
[1:00:18] anticipation
[1:00:20] believing that i would get to come and
[1:00:22] have a meeting but when i got to the
[1:00:25] visa it was restricted
[1:00:27] i almost had a heart attack i wanted to
[1:00:30] come so bad
[1:00:32] but i still believe this is very
[1:00:34] profound but i still believe that
[1:00:38] true god
[1:00:40] will minister again in the name of the
[1:00:42] lord jesus among the people of africa
[1:00:47] god has promised to give us the desire
[1:00:49] of hearts that
[1:00:52] of
[1:00:58] my people want that he had when he was
[1:01:01] here but brother branham was taken of
[1:01:03] the scene and a lot of people they say
[1:01:06] the vision was not fulfilled but let me
[1:01:08] bring it to a scripture in the book of
[1:01:11] psalms chapter 22 verse 16.
[1:01:15] here david says
[1:01:17] for dogs have compassed me
[1:01:21] the assembly of the wicked have enclosed
[1:01:24] me
[1:01:25] they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:01:28] now in the record of the life of david
[1:01:31] there was never a point where his hands
[1:01:34] and feet were pierced
[1:01:36] hallelujah but here the statements say
[1:01:39] they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:01:42] so if people want to leave the message
[1:01:44] and say the vision of africa was not
[1:01:47] fulfilled then you must leave the bible
[1:01:49] because here david say they pierced my
[1:01:52] hands and my feet
[1:01:55] his feet were never pierced but the
[1:01:57] students of the scriptures they
[1:02:00] understand it was not david speaking
[1:02:03] they understand that it was the messiah
[1:02:06] sticking through the mouth of death
[1:02:09] and the principle we take it our respect
[1:02:12] to africa and i will minister among
[1:02:15] african people it was not william
[1:02:18] branham that he was preaching it was the
[1:02:20] messiah preaching through william
[1:02:22] brennan today we are not expecting a
[1:02:25] kentuckian man to return but the one
[1:02:27] that used the kentuckian man he has
[1:02:30] returned to the shores
[1:02:32] hallelujah and somebody say oh he has
[1:02:34] returned where are the miracles
[1:02:38] let me give you something
[1:02:40] jesus
[1:02:41] is somewhere he's got multitude of
[1:02:43] people that are sick
[1:02:45] they're coming to him are squeezing they
[1:02:47] want to be praying he's called leprous
[1:02:50] he's got a and as he was there
[1:02:53] brother branham say they came as servant
[1:02:55] of a pharisee called sam simon
[1:02:58] and these seven came to jesus and said
[1:03:02] my master is inviting you on such and
[1:03:04] such a day
[1:03:06] do you mind to come and jesus said i
[1:03:08] will come jesus leaves crippled lepers
[1:03:12] sick people he goes to the house of the
[1:03:15] pharisee he gets it there and is sitting
[1:03:18] there in the corner
[1:03:28] the prostitute looked at him and said
[1:03:31] now is my opportunity and the prostitute
[1:03:34] went to buy a perfume and came back to
[1:03:37] unwind to the feet of jesus and wiped
[1:03:40] the feet of jesus and she got a
[1:03:42] deliverance of the soul
[1:03:44] now tell me which is a greater miracle
[1:03:47] the miracle of a person walking out of a
[1:03:50] wheelchair or a person that is being
[1:03:52] delivered on the soul
[1:03:54] if i get delivered from a wheelchair i
[1:03:56] can die without god and i will go to
[1:03:58] hell hallelujah if i get delivered
[1:04:02] because i'm dumb and i speak and i don't
[1:04:04] repent i will go to hell but my brother
[1:04:07] once ideally get delivered on the soul
[1:04:10] there is no point of return even god
[1:04:13] himself cannot disown me
[1:04:16] hallelujah forward i go and no one will
[1:04:18] stop it the devil will never stop me
[1:04:22] demons will never stop me why because i
[1:04:25] got it delivered on the soul and god
[1:04:27] does not save you today to lose you
[1:04:29] tomorrow there are people that today as
[1:04:32] i'm preaching in this church they are
[1:04:34] infallible
[1:04:35] i said there are people in this church
[1:04:37] that are infallible there are people in
[1:04:39] this church that will never go back to
[1:04:41] the world no matter what is happening
[1:04:43] they will never go back to the world
[1:04:45] because themselves and god they are so
[1:04:48] intertwined the devil will never
[1:04:50] separate to them hallelujah and i'm glad
[1:04:53] that i can say i'm one of those people
[1:04:56] folks i'm not you are not expectating
[1:04:58] the message you have become the message
[1:05:01] of the hour
[1:05:02] the spectators are leaving but the
[1:05:04] partakers are not leaving
[1:05:06] if you join to the message you will
[1:05:08] return back but if you become the
[1:05:11] message you will never call back there
[1:05:13] are people that are criticizing the
[1:05:15] message i said they are too late because
[1:05:17] those books now have become human beings
[1:05:20] hallelujah how are you going to change
[1:05:22] it back christ is the mystery of god
[1:05:24] reveal is now working on two feet the
[1:05:27] invisible union of the bride is now
[1:05:29] working on two feet we have reached a
[1:05:32] point of no
[1:05:35] i return we are together here
[1:05:37] always wanted to stop god's move
[1:05:41] yes
[1:05:41] hallelujah abraham sees a character he
[1:05:44] sees the three engines coming to his
[1:05:46] household and he identifies
[1:05:55] to abraham according to the time of life
[1:05:57] i shall return their wife sarah shall
[1:06:00] have a son
[1:06:01] hallelujah
[1:06:02] one day when abraham came from the
[1:06:05] slaughter of the kings he meets him
[1:06:07] again
[1:06:08] it was melchizedek walking through the
[1:06:10] pages of the bible one day jacob met him
[1:06:14] he wrestled with him
[1:06:16] when the moses said i have got the
[1:06:18] desire to see the lord and the lord says
[1:06:20] stand behind the rock you will see me
[1:06:22] passing by and moses sees a back patch
[1:06:24] of a man hallelujah we see him through
[1:06:27] the pages of the bible the hebrew
[1:06:29] children they were thrown into the fire
[1:06:32] but when nebuchadnezzar went to look the
[1:06:34] first man was in the fire who was dead
[1:06:37] it was god walking through the pages of
[1:06:39] the bible and that same one became the
[1:06:41] lord jesus christ and after he became
[1:06:43] the lord jesus christ the devil took him
[1:06:46] to the cross and the devil crucified him
[1:06:49] and put him into the grave and he
[1:06:50] thought he was finished but you can
[1:06:52] never stop god's move within 72 hours he
[1:06:56] was on his way to him house i said you
[1:06:59] can never stop god's move the same god
[1:07:02] that was here in devon is still here
[1:07:04] tonight
[1:07:05] oh brother the same angel that was here
[1:07:08] is still here tonight if you've got
[1:07:11] sugar diabetes that same angel can
[1:07:14] deliver you from your sugar diabetes if
[1:07:16] you've got a lost child that child can
[1:07:18] be reconciled by the power of the spoken
[1:07:21] way but brethren we've got to confess
[1:07:25] we've got to confess and our conviction
[1:07:29] will bring our circumstances in
[1:07:31] subjection to our confession if you say
[1:07:34] you are a failure you will be a failure
[1:07:37] but if you say i am a victim by grace
[1:07:39] i am healed by grace we must learn to
[1:07:42] ignore the symptoms and focus on the
[1:07:45] word of god and the lord that god that
[1:07:48] delivereth you from all the sicknesses
[1:07:51] frogs from their all sicknesses
[1:07:54] greater than all of them is here
[1:07:58] greater than moses is here
[1:08:00] greater than solomon is here
[1:08:03] greater than covet 19 is here
[1:08:05] greater than sugar diabetes here greater
[1:08:08] than all of them is here
[1:08:10] do you hear me brethren this god is able
[1:08:14] this god
[1:08:15] delivered you will see what in the
[1:08:17] message only believe
[1:08:21] the prophet says
[1:08:24] if we who are acquainted
[1:08:27] with the supernatural
[1:08:29] we just take a man
[1:08:31] where the man in his senses
[1:08:34] is limited
[1:08:35] to his senses
[1:08:37] but a man and his spirit is unlimited
[1:08:43] your terrestrial body is limited
[1:08:45] but you in your spirit you are unlimited
[1:08:51] the tree of knowledge
[1:08:53] can only climb so far
[1:08:56] and it breaks back
[1:08:58] but the tree of life goes on forever
[1:09:01] and how that science has taken men
[1:09:04] further with his five senses than we
[1:09:08] have with his soul
[1:09:10] this is an indictment church
[1:09:13] science has taken a man further
[1:09:16] with his five senses
[1:09:19] than we have with his soul
[1:09:23] we've got untapped resources where all
[1:09:26] things are possible
[1:09:28] folks let me say this
[1:09:31] every challenge of the hour the church
[1:09:33] has got a solution for it
[1:09:35] i say every challenge of the hour the
[1:09:38] church has got a pose has got a solution
[1:09:40] for it but here is a problem
[1:09:43] a man in his scientific thinking
[1:09:46] he believes it's unlimited
[1:09:48] but a man that has received the message
[1:09:51] of the hour he is doubtful
[1:09:54] a man
[1:09:56] hallelujah in his scientific thinking
[1:09:58] when covet hit he believed that i will
[1:10:01] get a vaccine
[1:10:02] hallelujah and you and i we must have
[1:10:06] faith that god will provide the solution
[1:10:08] are you still with me here
[1:10:10] the the scientists are working day and
[1:10:13] night to find
[1:10:24] that means when the world is saying
[1:10:26] all children are on rehab
[1:10:29] they are struggling with drug addiction
[1:10:32] we must not join the world we must not
[1:10:34] complain like the world we must tell the
[1:10:37] world there is a solution
[1:10:39] we must tell the world that we've got
[1:10:41] the solution the problem the church is
[1:10:43] ashamed to take a stance and brethren
[1:10:47] say you will never see god until you
[1:10:49] bring him to a showdown
[1:10:50] i say you will never see god until you
[1:10:53] bring him to a showdown and when you
[1:10:55] bring god to a showdown you've got to
[1:10:57] live your thinking brother branham said
[1:10:59] the supernatural thinking is to leave
[1:11:02] your own mind and get to the mind of
[1:11:04] christ what does it mean you're going to
[1:11:07] speak things that are ought
[1:11:09] i say you are going to speak things that
[1:11:11] are odd and when you speak things that
[1:11:13] are old people are gonna say you have
[1:11:15] lost your mind but at that moment god
[1:11:17] said that's my man that's my woman she
[1:11:21] believes in me he believes in me and let
[1:11:23] me tell you something brother but
[1:11:24] brother makes a profound statement he
[1:11:26] said god will back up even a hypocrite
[1:11:31] if a hypocrite if his weight is at stake
[1:11:35] how much more you are not a hypocrite
[1:11:37] you are the son and a judge of god you
[1:11:40] are not a hypocrite you left the things
[1:11:42] of the world you embraced the message of
[1:11:44] the hour you live according to the word
[1:11:47] of god how much more when you say this
[1:11:50] shall happen
[1:11:53] but many times
[1:11:55] we are afraid
[1:11:58] hallelujah
[1:12:00] better than the message influence
[1:12:02] paragraph serving
[1:12:05] brother branham
[1:12:06] says god's power
[1:12:10] is limited
[1:12:11] to your faith in it
[1:12:14] you say he said that's the only limit it
[1:12:17] has is your faith
[1:12:19] tonight my question would be
[1:12:23] what do you desire from the lord

[1:12:37] at your point of need
[1:12:40] and i say this god that i'm preaching

[1:12:44] this god demonstrated through the life
[1:12:46] of brother
[1:12:47] where he took a sex sex-born individual
[1:12:50] and said william branham what you need
[1:12:53] and he said i need to the squirrels and
[1:12:55] willem branham stood today and god said
[1:12:58] you i will not speak them you will um
[1:13:01] bring them you will bring the squirrel
[1:13:03] into the manifestation and willem
[1:13:05] branham stood like god stood in genesis
[1:13:08] 1. this was a man born by charles and
[1:13:12] ella branham and william branham stood
[1:13:14] there and said let there be listen to
[1:13:17] what you say god said how many do you
[1:13:19] need and he said i need you three
[1:13:22] hallelujah and brother since let there
[1:13:24] be a squirrel and there was a squirrel
[1:13:26] when he said i thought it was a vision i
[1:13:28] rubbed my eyes
[1:13:30] hallelujah i shot to the square i went
[1:13:32] to it i found it bleeding and it said
[1:13:35] the vision does not bleed and if you say
[1:13:37] i picked up the squid i was ready to go
[1:13:40] and god said no wait a minute you said
[1:13:42] how many do you want you know what when
[1:13:45] he said i needed three three were
[1:13:47] manifested in the supernatural realm
[1:13:50] they were waiting to be dropped down in
[1:13:52] the physical realm some of your
[1:13:54] blessings are there in the supernatural
[1:13:57] realm
[1:13:58] hallelujah god is waiting for you to
[1:14:01] bring them down to the physical realm
[1:14:04] and tonight the devil must not stop you
[1:14:06] the devil must not say it's just a
[1:14:08] church service it's just a minister it's
[1:14:10] not just a minister it's not just salmon
[1:14:13] it's a reality and if you take god in
[1:14:16] his way god will do the miraculous in
[1:14:19] your life
[1:14:22] and wilhelm branham stood there
[1:14:25] and said right now
[1:14:26] now i want to do something impossible as
[1:14:29] a hunter i know a squirrel will never be
[1:14:32] on the sacramento tree
[1:14:34] but today i'm unlimited
[1:14:37] under the unlimited god in an unlimited
[1:14:40] background i'm gonna call the squirrel
[1:14:43] to be on the sacramento tree and he said
[1:14:46] let there be a squirrel on a succumber
[1:14:48] tree and there was a squirrel on the
[1:14:50] soccer mall tree and there was another
[1:14:53] one he shot them and he went back home
[1:14:56] oh folks there was no chimera
[1:14:59] there was no selfie there was no
[1:15:02] evidence it was willem branham and
[1:15:04] william brennaman
[1:15:06] but when he began to narrate
[1:15:09] as he was narrating what god was doing
[1:15:12] sister haiti
[1:15:14] at the corner there
[1:15:16] a weird woman poor woman
[1:15:19] she listened
[1:15:20] and she listened and she said brother
[1:15:23] branham one thing is nothing but is the
[1:15:27] truth
[1:15:28] and god said sister haiti said the right
[1:15:32] thing
[1:15:32] and brother abraham stood up and said
[1:15:35] the same god that i was with in the
[1:15:37] wilderness is here in this room and said
[1:15:41] sister haiti ask whatever you want i
[1:15:44] shall give it to you
[1:15:47] sister say what masaya say here is your
[1:15:50] sister aries she's sitting on a
[1:15:52] wheelchair
[1:15:53] here is your parents they are old head
[1:15:56] sisterity requested that my i need my
[1:15:59] parents as young people they would have
[1:16:02] turned back to being young people again
[1:16:05] but as a mother
[1:16:08] one day it will be gone when i'm gone
[1:16:11] if i ask for the healing of sister eric
[1:16:13] she will die
[1:16:14] but the greatest desire
[1:16:17] that i have brother branham is the
[1:16:20] salvation of my two boys
[1:16:23] william branham stood there and looked
[1:16:26] his sister hit in the eye and said
[1:16:28] sister haiti i
[1:16:31] give you your children in the name of
[1:16:34] jesus christ and folks for as long as
[1:16:37] eternity stands those children will make
[1:16:39] it into eternity because there was a
[1:16:42] prophetic utterance over their lives but
[1:16:45] tonight i'm here
[1:16:47] the same god that was in the wilderness
[1:16:50] the same god that was in the sister at
[1:16:52] his house the same god that was young
[1:16:54] david is here right in phoenix
[1:16:57] [Applause]
[1:16:58] tonight folks that same god is here
[1:17:01] but the same god is looking for you as
[1:17:04] i'm preaching right now the table is
[1:17:06] whispering into your ear and says
[1:17:08] nothing
[1:17:09] refuse the devil's report
[1:17:11] tell the devil you are a liar i came to
[1:17:14] the house of god i know that there is a
[1:17:17] god i know that there is a god that can
[1:17:19] meet
[1:17:20] me at my point of need don't be afraid
[1:17:23] folks to testify about god god is
[1:17:26] looking for people that can testify
[1:17:29] before they are granted to their healing
[1:17:32] god is looking for people that can
[1:17:34] testify
[1:17:36] it reminds me of a blind man
[1:17:38] that said brother say you can see he
[1:17:40] went away he was still blind but every
[1:17:44] time you say thank god i can see
[1:17:47] and everybody made more career of him
[1:17:50] and everybody talked about him but one
[1:17:53] day he went to the barber
[1:17:55] and as they were busy cutting his head
[1:17:58] hallelujah the man the power the boy
[1:18:01] said angela had that you had to you went
[1:18:04] to that holy roller meeting
[1:18:08] and i heard that you said you can see
[1:18:10] they were trying to mock him
[1:18:12] but a man was not discouraged
[1:18:15] with a towel on his shoulders
[1:18:17] hallelujah
[1:18:39] in this message here in life
[1:18:42] paragraph 19
[1:18:44] he says now
[1:18:50] now when the brethren i hope you don't
[1:18:51] mind if i take off my jacket
[1:18:55] the devil is in trouble
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:01] now in the message here in life
[1:19:04] paragraph 19
[1:19:06] brother brandon say now brethren
[1:19:08] now
[1:19:09] when the brethren received
[1:19:11] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:14] they said this is the summit
[1:19:16] this is all of it
[1:19:18] but brethren it's wrong
[1:19:21] there is no summit to god's power
[1:19:25] brother there are people that say we
[1:19:27] hate heaven there is nothing that can
[1:19:29] surpass david but i'm here tonight to
[1:19:31] say there is no summit to god's power
[1:19:36] he said there is no submit to god's
[1:19:38] power
[1:19:39] we move on and on and on
[1:19:42] is the unlimited resources of god has
[1:19:45] never been tapped yet
[1:19:48] oh brother you mean after devon there
[1:19:50] are still resources that are untapped
[1:19:52] you mean after speaking the squirrels
[1:19:54] into existence there are results that
[1:19:56] are still untapped
[1:19:59] let me carry on here i'm getting excited
[1:20:03] he said we move on and on and on is the
[1:20:06] unlimited resources of god has never
[1:20:08] been tapped yet
[1:20:10] and it says blessings and powers that we
[1:20:12] know nothing about
[1:20:14] is never being even revealed to the
[1:20:16] archangels and is laying just ahead for
[1:20:19] his church that will believe
[1:20:22] for i has not seen
[1:20:24] ear has not had neither has it entered
[1:20:27] to the hearts of men what god has for
[1:20:30] them in store that love him
[1:20:32] there are still greater blessings are
[1:20:34] down the road there's still greater
[1:20:36] miracles down the road we need to move
[1:20:39] on and on hallelujah you know science is
[1:20:42] not science is not stagnated
[1:20:45] you know the technology that you think
[1:20:46] is the technology is outdated
[1:20:49] we got gps we thought it was break
[1:20:52] groundbreaking that thing was used by
[1:20:54] the military many years back
[1:20:56] and actually what you deem to be modern
[1:20:58] technology it's an outdated technology
[1:21:01] in the military once they don't need it
[1:21:02] anymore they give it to everyone but i'm
[1:21:05] looking at this spiritual army and i say
[1:21:08] what do you have tonight
[1:21:10] hallelujah and i can say
[1:21:12] you cannot say science can can outrun
[1:21:15] the church of god it can never outpace
[1:21:17] the church of god
[1:21:20] amen
[1:21:21] brother in the midfield hidden live
[1:21:23] paragraph 19.
[1:21:26] he says so let's move up
[1:21:29] and claim our eyes
[1:21:32] hallelujah you can have rights but if
[1:21:35] you claim them they lay dormant
[1:21:38] tonight there are privileges that you
[1:21:39] must lay
[1:21:41] amen you can have money in the bank and
[1:21:43] it is left in your name but if you don't
[1:21:46] go to the bank to claim it it remains
[1:21:48] there
[1:21:49] hallelujah and brotherhood says there
[1:21:51] are untapped resources there are
[1:21:53] interpretive blessings there is untapped
[1:21:56] power you can have access to that
[1:22:00] are you still with me you can access
[1:22:02] that but today the church is timid
[1:22:05] brother probably says the greatest
[1:22:07] problem with the church the church is
[1:22:09] fearful
[1:22:10] we are full of fear what's going to
[1:22:13] happen tomorrow and as a result we get
[1:22:15] worried and worried and brother says
[1:22:17] there is no value in worry
[1:22:19] he said if i'm going to die tomorrow and
[1:22:22] what about it what good is it but it
[1:22:24] says
[1:22:26] tell you there is a reservoir of god's
[1:22:28] power
[1:22:32] hallelujah
[1:22:35] brother let's move up and claim our eyes
[1:22:40] as god god opens
[1:22:42] the gaze
[1:22:44] and swings out the welcome mate
[1:22:47] let's move on up into
[1:22:49] deeper depths
[1:22:51] and never colonize ourselves
[1:22:54] to organize ourselves and to get into a
[1:22:57] place where where this is we shall
[1:23:00] believe this and that's all
[1:23:03] let's believe this plus how much more we
[1:23:06] can hear from god
[1:23:08] ah but are you here
[1:23:10] don't put a comment a full stop there
[1:23:14] put your calm
[1:23:15] and say to be continued if god blesses
[1:23:18] you today don't say that's it
[1:23:21] the same god that bless you today he
[1:23:23] will bless you tomorrow
[1:23:24] the same god that delivers you he will
[1:23:27] deliver your children
[1:23:28] hallelujah and you mothers today
[1:23:32] we are looking for a spiritual sense of
[1:23:35] militancy amen
[1:23:37] the devil cannot keep on snatching
[1:23:39] children away from us and we just accept
[1:23:41] that we are in the end time you know how
[1:23:44] children are no we don't know
[1:23:47] what we know you can bind that demon
[1:23:50] what we know a mother who is prayerful
[1:23:53] god will back up that mother oh mothers
[1:23:56] are you in the building brother brethren
[1:23:59] say even the grave will never stop your
[1:24:01] prayer
[1:24:02] he said even after you are gone your
[1:24:04] prayer will go after your children and
[1:24:06] tonight they say keep on praying for
[1:24:08] them and say lord they will come at the
[1:24:10] right time
[1:24:12] hallelujah how many believe the holy
[1:24:13] ghost is here
[1:24:15] and if your child is not in church the
[1:24:17] holy ghost can go where your child is
[1:24:20] right in a tavern drinking the holy
[1:24:22] ghost can go there and the boy while
[1:24:25] he's drinking it drops down the bottle
[1:24:27] and says something is moving
[1:24:29] why the prayer of the mother the prayer
[1:24:31] of the father but the problem the church
[1:24:34] has surrendered
[1:24:38] the neighbor is an unbeliever
[1:24:40] she complains about her children you are
[1:24:43] joining her
[1:24:44] complaining like she's complaining do
[1:24:47] you think she's gonna come and accept
[1:24:48] what you have accepted
[1:24:50] no you must tell hey
[1:24:53] that our children both of them are on
[1:24:55] drugs but the difference is that every
[1:24:58] night
[1:24:59] as a godly mother
[1:25:01] before i go into bed
[1:25:03] and kneel down and pray to god
[1:25:06] at some point in time
[1:25:08] my child whether she likes it or not
[1:25:11] whether he likes it or not god will
[1:25:13] bring him back into the fold are you
[1:25:15] here mothers
[1:25:17] are you here mothers the devil cannot
[1:25:19] come and run amok in our houses there is
[1:25:22] enough power
[1:25:24] you are limited in your spirit
[1:25:27] i say you are limited to your spirit
[1:25:30] oh another quotation brother adrian
[1:25:32] brother branham says when a man is
[1:25:35] connected with god
[1:25:37] he is
[1:25:39] he is as powerful as god is powerful oh
[1:25:43] tonight i'm preaching not to a
[1:25:44] denomination i'm preaching to the bride
[1:25:47] of jesus christ
[1:25:49] you are married to jesus christ in
[1:25:51] community of property his blessings are
[1:25:55] your blessings his power is your power
[1:26:04] you know when a woman is married to a
[1:26:06] rich man
[1:26:07] and she goes to the gatewall mall to
[1:26:09] shop
[1:26:10] she's not just sorry
[1:26:13] hallelujah she comes pushing a trolley
[1:26:16] full maybe it's two of them
[1:26:20] hallelujah she's not nervous
[1:26:23] she's not got no calculator

[1:26:32] what i have forgotten she goes and get
[1:26:34] even the more expensive item what is
[1:26:37] happening this woman knows who she is
[1:26:39] married to but i'm looking at the church
[1:26:41] of the living god
[1:26:43] married to jesus christ but they are
[1:26:45] afraid
[1:26:46] to swipe
[1:26:48] and tonight it's a lot of swipe
[1:26:51] healing is here let us fight
[1:26:53] deliverance here let us why bless inside

[1:27:16] oh my then listen to what there's some
[1:27:19] way i'm going
[1:27:21] brother brahman says in the message the
[1:27:22] deity of jesus christ paragraph one one
[1:27:25] zero
[1:27:26] he says now friends
[1:27:28] i know that it should be the truth
[1:27:30] i know people don't realize who you are
[1:27:34] that is the problem today there is
[1:27:36] spiritual amnesia people don't know who
[1:27:39] we are we have forgotten who we are
[1:27:42] but i'm here maybe to help you by god's
[1:27:45] grace to be delivered from that amnesia
[1:27:49] you are not just an ordinary church
[1:27:51] the message is not just an ordinary
[1:27:53] doctrine the message is jesus christ in
[1:27:57] the revealed where they form
[1:28:01] he'll say friends i know that to be the
[1:28:04] truth i know people don't realize who
[1:28:06] you are
[1:28:07] every person in here can live above sin
[1:28:13] folks every every person amen amen every
[1:28:17] person tonight in this building
[1:28:21] young ones
[1:28:23] the middle aged the elderly you can live
[1:28:26] above sea
[1:28:28] that's a great america
[1:28:30] to live above sin
[1:28:33] amen hallelujah amen and subdue satan
[1:28:37] because you know i'm a son and a
[1:28:39] daughter of god
[1:28:41] the power is in your identity
[1:28:46] he says you you will make mistakes
[1:28:50] but god the blood of christ will forgive
[1:28:52] you
[1:28:53] father forgive them for they know not
[1:28:55] what they do
[1:28:56] the same power
[1:28:58] of christ that was hung on calvary's
[1:29:01] cross
[1:29:02] the same god that raised him up on the
[1:29:04] day of the resurrection
[1:29:07] he's not in america today
[1:29:10] he's not in jeffersonville tonight
[1:29:13] he's not in jobac tonight folks i don't
[1:29:16] believe myself god that i will admire
[1:29:18] him at a distance
[1:29:19] no if i go to a church i believe god is
[1:29:22] in my church
[1:29:23] i believe god is in my family
[1:29:26] the same god that was in jeffersonville
[1:29:28] is in my family
[1:29:33] that same
[1:29:34] power of christ that was hung on
[1:29:36] calvary's cross the same god that raised
[1:29:38] him up on the day of the resurrection is
[1:29:41] in you
[1:29:43] you that's quite the holy ghost
[1:29:46] then if the same you know the problem
[1:29:49] today the devil recognizes what is in
[1:29:52] you more than you recognize what is in
[1:29:55] you
[1:29:57] the devil is more afraid of you and you
[1:29:59] don't realize why he's not he's afraid
[1:30:02] of you
[1:30:04] have you ever been a son of a top cop
[1:30:07] and maybe you go somewhere there are
[1:30:08] criminals and you introduce yourself
[1:30:10] from madiva and all of a sudden it
[1:30:12] clicks to the criminals marijuana is the
[1:30:15] top cop and then all of a sudden they
[1:30:16] run away but you don't know why they are
[1:30:18] running away that's exactly how the
[1:30:20] church is the devil is afraid of what is
[1:30:24] inside of you
[1:30:26] hallelujah there is something within you
[1:30:28] that binds demonic powers
[1:30:31] the same power that was in the race
[1:30:33] cause tonight is not in america
[1:30:35] it's not in the grave where brother
[1:30:37] branham was buried
[1:30:38] he's in the in the believers tonight but
[1:30:41] that power remains untapped
[1:30:44] because why a lot of times we
[1:30:46] concentrate on things that are not
[1:30:48] important
[1:30:52] i hope we are together
[1:30:55] brother branham says
[1:30:59] that he didn't tell me what time do we
[1:31:02] what time do we lose
[1:31:04] all right you know he never said
[1:31:09] brother be careful
[1:31:11] you might carry on until four o'clock
[1:31:13] and somebody falls asleep and falls like
[1:31:17] the days of paul i won't go there
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:22] now the prophet says listen to this
[1:31:25] redemption in completeness in joy
[1:31:28] paragraph 134
[1:31:30] he says look
[1:31:32] he speaks of the early church
[1:31:34] they were full of new wine
[1:31:37] that's right the one that comes from god
[1:31:39] out of heaven
[1:31:40] he says did you ever see a drunk man
[1:31:43] he is just in love with everybody
[1:31:48] have you ever seen a drunk man he's just
[1:31:51] in love with everybody you see he
[1:31:54] doesn't care that's the way a man is
[1:31:57] when he gets drunk on the spirit
[1:31:59] the bible says be not drunk on strong
[1:32:02] wine with excess but to be drunk on the
[1:32:04] spirit
[1:32:05] the spirit of god makes you so drunk you
[1:32:09] forget all your enemies
[1:32:11] oh the reason we remember our enemies is
[1:32:13] because we are sober
[1:32:17] a sober man knows his enemies will coach
[1:32:20] his enemies what they did to him but not
[1:32:23] a drunk man
[1:32:24] a drug man just want to hug everybody
[1:32:27] hallelujah
[1:32:31] then he carries on
[1:32:34] he says that the spirit of god makes you
[1:32:36] so drunk you forget all your enemies and
[1:32:38] everything and everybody's in love with
[1:32:40] you
[1:32:41] he don't care about who's standing
[1:32:43] around you you're the biggest man in the
[1:32:45] counter right then
[1:32:47] i don't care you have you ever seen a
[1:32:50] drunk man he believes is the best thing
[1:32:53] you can't hide him during a family
[1:32:55] gathering he wants to greet everyone
[1:32:59] he wants to tell everybody about what he
[1:33:01] thinks
[1:33:02] hallelujah he's not afraid of anyone
[1:33:05] he thinks that he's on top of the world
[1:33:08] and brother brennan say if a drunk man
[1:33:10] in the nature can be in such a manner
[1:33:13] how much more drunk men in the spirit
[1:33:17] sometimes we are afraid because we are
[1:33:19] too sober
[1:33:21] somebody was talking about a rat and a
[1:33:24] cat and it says this red was running
[1:33:26] from a cat but it fell into a jar and
[1:33:28] the child had an alcohol
[1:33:30] and the rat sipped the alcohol and when
[1:33:33] it came out of the jar
[1:33:35] the same rat that was running away from
[1:33:37] the kid started looking for a cat
[1:33:40] because now it was a drunk rat
[1:33:43] oh brother you run from the table but
[1:33:46] once you are in judged by the spirit
[1:33:48] from above you are no longer afraid of
[1:33:50] satan now you are looking for that demon
[1:33:53] and say where is that demon so that i
[1:33:55] can deal with
[1:33:56] amen
[1:33:58] amen
[1:34:00] brother let's carry on amen
[1:34:02] brother brennan speaks something here
[1:34:04] as i'm gonna work towards the clothes
[1:34:08] and the message israel in the church
[1:34:09] paragraph 13 this is very
[1:34:12] very important
[1:34:16] brother branham says let me ask this let
[1:34:20] me give you an illustration
[1:34:22] here is one sphere
[1:34:24] here's another sphere
[1:34:26] and here is another one
[1:34:29] maybe brother let's just go
[1:34:31] one forward a bit we'll come back he
[1:34:34] speaks about those fears
[1:34:36] there's one sphere
[1:34:38] another sphere and another sphere will
[1:34:41] come to the diagram so that you
[1:34:42] understand what i'm talking about
[1:34:45] then it says now down here is the
[1:34:47] nominal church
[1:34:49] maybe let's leave it there like that he
[1:34:51] says now down here is the nominal church
[1:34:54] now up in here
[1:34:57] here is the sublime there at the top
[1:35:00] and it says here is where we are
[1:35:02] supposed to be
[1:35:04] right next door to heaven
[1:35:07] where the powers of god is leaking down
[1:35:11] all right it drops on this drops down
[1:35:14] through to this one then drops through
[1:35:17] to this one this is the nominal church
[1:35:19] at the bottom
[1:35:21] it just goes on just old cold
[1:35:24] professions
[1:35:26] and a little really ritualistic affair
[1:35:28] that is the nominal church
[1:35:30] they just get the very slight drippings
[1:35:35] then the next church up here is full
[1:35:38] gospel
[1:35:39] get some of the blessings but they go
[1:35:41] off into isms and if you've got to
[1:35:45] if we've got to lift up into the next
[1:35:47] fear here before we can ever have
[1:35:50] rapture that's exactly right you've got
[1:35:52] to get up in that before we can ever
[1:35:55] have it that's true
[1:35:57] are you i hear church tonight there is a
[1:36:00] nominal church
[1:36:02] they are just a little ritualistic
[1:36:04] all to con call called confessions
[1:36:08] and there is a full gospel they receive
[1:36:10] a little bit of drippings of god's power
[1:36:13] but there is a sublime church
[1:36:16] that is next to the door of heaven
[1:36:18] they've got access to the heavenly power
[1:36:22] and tonight we don't want to be a
[1:36:23] nominal church we don't want to be an
[1:36:26] average church
[1:36:27] folks we don't want to be church a child
[1:36:29] where the sinners just come in and go
[1:36:32] back the same whether she come in and
[1:36:34] they go back they say brother brethren
[1:36:36] say this coming a time where the sick
[1:36:39] will get healed without being prayed for
[1:36:42] by the atmosphere in the church
[1:36:44] during the period of grace right there
[1:36:47] before a song service the power of god
[1:36:50] moves into the church and somebody say i
[1:36:52] had a cancer is god i had a diabetes is
[1:36:56] god
[1:36:57] hallelujah and he said the sinners will
[1:36:59] repent without being preached to
[1:37:02] before the minister comes already
[1:37:04] people's hearts are ready for god
[1:37:07] oh brother i'm looking forward to that
[1:37:10] time and if that time is tonight let it
[1:37:13] be so the atmosphere where the church is
[1:37:16] in an atmosphere
[1:37:18] hallelujah we don't want to be full

[1:42:22] worshipping a son

[1:42:37] but it says if my god cannot deliver
[1:42:40] this man
