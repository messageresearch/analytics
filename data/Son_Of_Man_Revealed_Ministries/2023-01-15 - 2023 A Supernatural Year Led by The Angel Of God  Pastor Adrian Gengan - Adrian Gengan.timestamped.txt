[2:10] snowing

[2:26] with a Renault am I saying their name
[2:28] properly no amen so he stays down in
[2:31] green Manner and obey the spirit of the
[2:33] Lord let him here he said his mother and
[2:35] his father told him there's a church
[2:36] here so he should come amen but I don't
[2:39] believe things happen just happened as a
[2:41] amen because we believe in the leading
[2:43] of the angel of God and I appreciate the
[2:46] morning prayer brother Sunny amen
[2:49] the angel of the Lord is still here on
[2:51] the Earth right now
[2:52] and you'll see some of the things where
[2:54] why I'm saying that is you'll see our
[2:57] message is going to be centered around
[2:58] that
[3:00] amen we appreciate the song service we
[3:02] appreciate the singers amen I noticed
[3:04] you were flowing uh in a good spirit and
[3:07] anointing this morning and that's a good
[3:10] atmosphere for the spirit of God to move
[3:12] Amen brother Gans is here this morning
[3:14] let's keep my hand welcoming amen
[3:16] blessed be the name of the Lord amen so
[3:18] brother salvation and his family is
[3:19] still away and they should be back this
[3:21] week amen pray the Lord will give them a
[3:24] safe traveling buses amen coming back
[3:26] home
[3:27] amen so we'll turn our attention to
[3:30] Exodus chapter 23.
[3:35] amen Exodus chapter 23
[3:40] . the message will start on 23.
[3:45] amen
[3:46] so we're going to be looking at amen a
[3:48] few things in the scripture and in
[3:50] Exodus chapter 23
[3:54] reading from verse 20
[3:57] I just want to read a quote before we
[3:58] get into that okay you can give me that
[4:01] back our words foreign
[4:04] amen
[4:07] Exodus chapter 23 and verse 20.
[4:10] it says behold I send an angel before
[4:13] thee
[4:15] who is the Lord talking to you Moses
[4:18] right the Lord is talking to Moses and
[4:21] he's telling him behold I send an angel
[4:24] before thee
[4:26] now very important to note what he's
[4:28] going to tell him number one he's going
[4:29] to keep thee in the way
[4:32] now if I'd ask you who was the deliverer
[4:35] in the first Exodus you will tell me
[4:36] it's Moses
[4:38] but here we see that Moses the deliverer
[4:40] is being led by an Angel
[4:43] and the Lord is telling him behold you
[4:46] can pick it up in your scriptures Exodus
[4:48] chapter 23 and verse 20. amen
[4:51] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[4:53] thee into the place which I have
[4:56] prepared
[4:57] so whose job is it to bring them from
[5:00] Egypt to the promised land is it Moses
[5:03] job
[5:05] or is it the Angel's job
[5:07] so the angel is going to keep him in the
[5:09] way the angel is going to bring thee
[5:11] into the place which I have prepared
[5:15] aren't you glad he said I'm going away
[5:17] to prepare a place for you and there's
[5:19] an angel leading us to take a place
[5:24] just beware amen
[5:26] Beware of the angel
[5:29] amen amen
[5:31] right there's two ways you can read that
[5:34] beware of him
[5:36] and then be cautious or be aware of him
[5:43] and you know from the news if service
[5:45] the spirit has been leading us and
[5:47] telling us to be more sensitive to the
[5:49] spirit of God and the angel of God that
[5:51] is leading the church
[5:53] so be aware of him obey his voice
[5:58] provoke him not
[6:01] for he will not pardon your
[6:03] transgressions
[6:04] all verse 5 said I mean the fifth point
[6:07] there is for my name is in him
[6:12] [Music]
[6:16] which do you say I came
[6:19] anybody knows that a name represents
[6:21] character
[6:22] that's why the prophet is telling us
[6:24] watch what you name your children it
[6:26] represents their character
[6:28] amen and his name Shall be Called
[6:31] wonderful counselor Mighty God fruits of
[6:35] peace
[6:35] this Angel is going to have that same
[6:37] characteristics
[6:41] are you reading with understanding 22
[6:44] says but if thou shall indeed obey his
[6:46] voice
[6:48] and do all that I speak then I will be
[6:51] an enemy unto thine enemies and an
[6:53] adversary unto thine adversaries note 23
[6:57] 23 now make this 20
[7:03] so Exodus 20 23 is your scripture for
[7:06] the year
[7:07] for my angel shall go before thee
[7:12] amen and bring thee unto the amorites
[7:15] the e-tites the peasal rights the
[7:19] Canaanites the invites the jebusites and
[7:23] all the other pornographic sites
[7:25] and all the other websites
[7:29] so he's going to deliver you from the
[7:30] rights the tights the sights the knights
[7:32] the whites and the sights
[7:35] he's going to deliver you from all of
[7:37] these things amen may the Lord have
[7:39] blessings to the reading of his word you
[7:41] may be seated
[7:42] amen
[7:44] oh isn't he a good God give him praise
[7:47] amen I know you're feeling uncomfortable
[7:49] where you are right now
[7:50] for those of you streaming in it's
[7:53] extremely hot here in Durban South
[7:55] Africa today and uh but we're just going
[7:58] to bear with the Heat this morning amen
[8:01] hallelujah
[8:02] aren't you glad that we serve a God and
[8:05] he gave us his glorious message
[8:07] amen such a prophetic word amen why
[8:11] would we want to be out in some
[8:13] denominational Church
[8:15] when we are living in the glory
[8:18] of his word amen
[8:21] Caleb I'm going to give you this back
[8:22] and then you can just see if you can
[8:24] pick that up amen
[8:27] so I want to say this morning
[8:32] that this is no ordinary Church
[8:37] this ministry sorry one said amen
[8:40] watching you amen
[8:49] this ministry is designed
[8:52] Supernatural amen
[8:55] and when you are caught up into a
[8:57] spiritual Supernatural atmosphere
[9:01] it's going to overflow into the natural
[9:04] it will affect everything about your
[9:06] natural life
[9:08] and that's the true meaning behind
[9:10] Matthew 6 and 33 when Jesus is saying
[9:14] seek ye first the kingdom of God
[9:17] no no the kingdom is not natural the
[9:19] kingdom is Supernatural
[9:22] spiritual he says when you seek the
[9:24] spiritual Kingdom and his righteousness
[9:27] all the things in natural shall be added
[9:30] unto you
[9:31] so we are those Ministry is designed to
[9:34] lead you into the supernatural spiritual
[9:36] things of God
[9:38] you've come just looking for a natural
[9:39] church for church membership this is not
[9:42] the place to be
[9:44] amen because you will be grieved by the
[9:47] things that the spirit of God is
[9:48] speaking
[9:49] the spirit of God will make you feel
[9:51] uncomfortable
[9:52] so the ministry is designed to connect
[9:55] you to the supernatural world
[9:57] and then you will live gloriously in the
[10:00] natural
[10:01] the demand should pick it up amen
[10:04] all right it's fine maybe you can pick
[10:06] up the quote I want to read this
[10:09] brother Brandon is saying yeah
[10:12] and he's talking about Exodus 23 and 23
[10:15] he says I usually read this at the
[10:17] starting of your Revival
[10:20] there you go
[10:21] because this deals with something the
[10:24] way God is dealing today
[10:27] amen amen
[10:29] it's dealing with the way God is dealing
[10:32] today Exodus 23 and 23 I send my angel
[10:36] before thee
[10:38] amen
[10:39] now
[10:40] what were the children of Israel why did
[10:42] they need Deliverance they were in Egypt
[10:44] and as long as they were prospering
[10:46] under Joseph
[10:48] and the next 400 years they had need of
[10:51] nothing and went along living life just
[10:53] fine
[10:54] but that got away from God
[10:57] and that's the trouble in man
[10:59] they got in trouble with God and they
[11:01] got under bondage
[11:03] and they came a great need a great
[11:06] persecution that they had to endure to
[11:08] drive them to see God again
[11:11] now there's a lesson to be learned right
[11:13] there because we live in the midst of
[11:15] leadership the most lukewarm and cold
[11:18] Church age that there ever is but it's
[11:21] also the most easiest age to live life
[11:24] amen you can become anything in this
[11:26] life if you put your time your effort
[11:28] your discipline and you can live a
[11:31] comfortable life
[11:32] but what will it profit a man if he
[11:35] gains the old world Amen and he loses
[11:37] his soul
[11:39] amen and the nature of man has not
[11:42] changed
[11:44] if we are not converted if we are not
[11:46] born again all of us have this nature as
[11:49] long as things are easy man does not
[11:51] seek after God
[11:56] amen man always wants to call out to God
[11:59] and cry out to him only in the time of
[12:01] trouble
[12:03] but I pray him and there won't be the
[12:05] wind with us this morning amen may we
[12:07] always seek the Lord
[12:09] amen may we always call out to him when
[12:12] times are good when times are bad
[12:15] through sickness when we are in good
[12:17] health in times of financial prosperity
[12:20] and even when economic times are tough
[12:22] may we never lose weight or belief in
[12:25] God Amen amen may we be steadfast to him
[12:28] how many times have we spoken about job
[12:31] and don't we sing that song Blessed Be
[12:34] Your Name
[12:35] amen when I'm found in the desert place
[12:38] though I walk through the Wilderness no
[12:40] matter the circumstance find a place
[12:43] where you can praise God
[12:45] no matter how difficult to test still
[12:48] testify still sing to him
[12:52] amen most people say oh no I'm not
[12:55] feeling good
[12:56] I feel down in my spirit I cannot praise
[12:58] the Lord that's the right time to praise
[13:00] him
[13:01] Amen in the midst of your circumstance
[13:04] praise the Lord
[13:07] and watch the devil begin to tremble
[13:10] because he cannot stand to see a
[13:12] Believer rise up in faith he'll say no
[13:14] matter what I'm putting through this
[13:15] Christian through he is still praising
[13:17] God
[13:18] he wanted job to curse God
[13:22] amen
[13:24] now we serve a mighty God
[13:27] we serve a powerful God
[13:29] amen can you testify to that this
[13:32] morning we serve a God who is worthy of
[13:34] praise and a true worshiper does not
[13:37] worship God according to circumstances
[13:39] amen a true worship God does not worship
[13:42] amen God Less in trouble times but in
[13:46] fact he increases his level of praise
[13:48] and his level of worship in troubled
[13:50] times
[13:52] amen
[13:53] Hallelujah a true revelation of God will
[13:57] make you worship Him in spirit and in
[13:59] truth amen
[14:01] amen amen now you're the prophet of God
[14:03] says when God's prophetic time comes to
[14:06] pass after he promised Abraham that his
[14:09] seed with sojourn in his Strange Land
[14:10] for 400 years he would bring them out by
[14:13] strong hand
[14:14] he says no matter how impossible it
[14:17] seems that it will not be when the time
[14:20] of the promise draws nigh God will make
[14:23] things eat up to foot his prophetic
[14:25] promise
[14:29] amen
[14:30] I didn't give you my title this morning
[14:33] the title for my sermon is
[14:38] 2023 and my focus is on 23.
[14:42] It's Supernatural here led by the angel
[14:45] of God
[14:46] and I'm going to show you how 23s
[14:48] associated with the angel of God
[14:52] amen 23 is associated with the angel of
[14:56] God
[14:59] we read Exodus 20. now for those
[15:02] Skeptics who are saying oh no
[15:05] why are you making these things up
[15:07] Exodus 23 and 23.
[15:10] my angel shall go before thee
[15:14] wasn't it God who designed man to write
[15:16] the Bible
[15:17] wasn't it God who made them so
[15:20] meticulously
[15:22] number it accordingly otherwise how can
[15:25] we fathom Revelation 10 7. that in the
[15:28] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[15:30] when he shall begin to sound
[15:33] you know that sounding was the sounding
[15:35] of a trumpet a jubilee trumpet
[15:38] to let man go free
[15:41] and on the tenth day of the seventh
[15:43] month he laid down the law and Leviticus
[15:44] and he told him in the tenth day of the
[15:47] seventh month you shall call the trumpet
[15:49] to be blown
[15:50] so God is accurate in the way numbers
[15:53] things
[15:55] amen so he makes it as 23 and 23 my
[15:58] angels shall go before thee
[16:00] amen hallelujah and I told you we're
[16:04] going to be looking at some of these
[16:05] things and show you how the number 23 is
[16:08] associated with the angel of the Lord
[16:10] and what year are we living in
[16:12] 2023
[16:15] I declare that this year shall be a
[16:17] shift in the church
[16:19] there'll be a shift in and a move
[16:21] towards the supernatural things of God
[16:24] you become more aware of the angel of
[16:26] God you become more aware of his
[16:28] presence and his Supernatural walking
[16:30] amongst the Believers of course that
[16:33] only applies to the ones that are
[16:35] expecting it
[16:36] if you remain in a natural you will not
[16:38] see the move of God but if you are on
[16:40] the expectation this morning amen you
[16:43] shall see the supernatural moving of the
[16:45] spirit of God
[16:49] live and take a switch it's me deals
[16:52] with the seven Feasts
[16:54] what are the seven feasts given for
[16:57] it's all typing Christ
[17:00] it's typing Christ's sacrifice
[17:03] amen and we have lived amen Christ typed
[17:07] the first three trees amen and you know
[17:09] the fourth Feast was the Feast of
[17:11] Pentecost
[17:12] and there's been 50 years
[17:15] amen a jubilee a Pentecostal feast amen
[17:19] hallelujah
[17:22] I will show you amen that amen this
[17:25] feast day is the past and then the
[17:27] prophet wants to preach Feast of the
[17:29] trumpets he wants to lay out seven days
[17:31] and preach Feast of the trumpets but
[17:34] then he cannot do it because the spirit
[17:36] of God tells him you already preached
[17:38] the trumpets supernaturally under the
[17:40] Sixth Seal
[17:43] so watch what happened supernaturally
[17:45] now and the prophet himself does not
[17:47] even explain this because the last three
[17:50] Feasts is the Feast of atonement
[17:54] amen sorry the Feast of trumpets the
[17:58] Feast of atonement and the Feast of
[17:59] Tabernacles
[18:01] and yet he preaches three consecutive
[18:04] Sundays
[18:05] the first message he takes is fear the
[18:08] Feast of the trumpets right
[18:11] the second message he takes is
[18:12] recognizing your day and its message
[18:15] which is what's going to happen to the
[18:17] Jews recognizing the atonement
[18:21] there are three more fees left for them
[18:24] now we know six trumpets have already
[18:26] sounded
[18:28] right the property has six trumpets
[18:29] rushed him to the Homeland they are
[18:31] waiting for the seven trumpet
[18:33] which will be under the ministry of
[18:35] Moses and Elijah can somebody say Amen
[18:39] amen hallelujah now you're going to be
[18:42] spiritual to catch these things some
[18:43] some of these things may go over your
[18:45] head otherwise but watch how the prophet
[18:47] the spirit leads the prophet to preach
[18:49] Feast of the trumpets one Sunday the
[18:51] following Sunday he preaches
[18:54] recognizing your day and its message
[18:57] like how the Jews are going to recognize
[18:59] the atonement the one they rejected was
[19:03] the true atonement we the denominational
[19:05] world have rejected the message but we
[19:08] have recognized our day and its message
[19:10] and then the third message which is
[19:13] typing Feast of the Tabernacles or Feast
[19:16] of boots so what did they do in that
[19:18] Feast they made temporary Dwelling
[19:20] Places
[19:21] even up to today they do these temporary
[19:24] dwelling they call it boots
[19:26] it's signifying a move from the this
[19:29] world into the next world
[19:31] and then the prophet preaches the third
[19:34] Sunday the future home
[19:37] of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[19:40] Earthly bride
[19:42] he preaches his messages supernaturally
[19:45] led by the angel of God Amen amen
[19:48] showing us that we have received it
[19:50] spiritually
[19:52] amen amen hallelujah
[19:55] and aren't you thankful it's a Heavenly
[19:57] bridegroom
[19:58] coming to an Earthly bride
[20:01] what is he doing he's gonna take an ugly
[20:04] bride away into another world he is the
[20:08] architect of that world
[20:10] he is the designer of that world
[20:14] amen
[20:15] and watch our signs now in the natural
[20:19] where do they want to take man because
[20:21] they are trying to copy God don't they
[20:23] want to take man out of this world and
[20:25] try and find another Dwelling Place
[20:29] that is the more motive behind it
[20:32] amen because Satan is a copycat
[20:35] Hallelujah
[20:38] now we're just going to hit some
[20:40] highlights
[20:41] Exodus 23 and 23 was the angel leading
[20:45] Moses
[20:46] but what did he say I will take you into
[20:49] the land
[20:50] now did Moses take them into the land
[20:53] who took them into the land
[20:55] so it's the same angel
[20:57] I hope you picked this up
[20:59] Moses was The Exodus Prophet now
[21:02] the same angel that started the ministry
[21:04] in Moses is the same one leading them in
[21:07] Joshua
[21:09] the same Ministry that started out in
[21:11] William Branham is the same Angel
[21:13] leading the church today
[21:16] Hallelujah
[21:18] and watch out supernaturally now the
[21:21] spirit of God would take Joshua 23 on
[21:24] New Year's Eve
[21:25] and I didn't know that still I Was

[25:13] and Luke 23 remember what we've been
[25:16] speaking about now the spirit of the
[25:18] Lord is leading there now what did they
[25:20] have in the first Exodus they had a
[25:22] natural lamb that was slain the blood of
[25:25] the Lamb was applied on the doorpost in
[25:27] the second Exodus they had the true lamb
[25:31] they had the blood of the lamb and in
[25:34] Luke 23
[25:35] deals with the crucifixion of that lamb
[25:41] the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ
[25:43] the turning point in Humanity's history
[25:50] the ultimate sacrifice for the sin of
[25:52] mankind is found in Luke 23
[25:56] and it was he was offered and he was
[25:59] sacrificed once and for all and an
[26:01] atonement was made and through the blood
[26:04] of Jesus Christ you and I are set free

[27:13] you to concentrate right now but pay
[27:15] attention amen Hallelujah don't miss it
[27:18] because amen this service depends on how
[27:21] you're going to finish this year
[27:23] amen
[27:25] this is going to be the most glorious
[27:27] year for the church this is going to be
[27:29] the most Supernatural here for the
[27:31] church
[27:33] amen
[27:36] or the first messenger of the first age
[27:39] the Apostle Paul
[27:41] [Music]
[27:43] let's turn to Acts 27. and oddly enough
[27:46] what verse do you think it's found in
[27:52] who's following me
[27:55] the 23rd verse
[27:58] of Acts 27
[28:03] . what does he say
[28:06] for they are stood by me this night the
[28:09] angel of God
[28:11] whose I am
[28:13] and whom I serve d
[28:16] do you think that's coincidence
[28:19] Exodus 23 23 talking about an angel
[28:22] leading the church
[28:24] acts 27 and 23
[28:27] they stood now this was give you context
[28:30] he remember the ship was going to go
[28:33] down
[28:34] the Apostle Paul is telling them they
[28:36] stood by me an angel of God
[28:38] whose I am amen so who is this angel
[28:43] that the Apostle Paul wants to be
[28:44] associated with him
[28:46] and he's saying who am I serve
[28:52] the angel of the Covenant
[28:55] the one leading the church the prophet
[28:58] we don't have time to go into it now he
[29:00] says people think that the angel doesn't
[29:02] leave the church anymore
[29:04] he says come to find out I'll show you
[29:05] in the scripture and then he takes him
[29:06] throughout the angel let Philip the
[29:09] angel LED Paul Peter the angel LED Paul
[29:11] we went through that a few months ago
[29:13] when we preached on the wings of the
[29:15] mighty Angel and we showed you how the
[29:17] angel was leading the church
[29:24] that was first Exodus right
[29:27] Exodus 23 23 here's the second Exodus
[29:32] Jesus Christ Angel of the church Angel
[29:34] leading the church and you're starting
[29:37] off the first church age Paul the
[29:40] Apostle Paul telling us the angel of God
[29:42] was with him leading him
[29:47] confirming the angel is leading the
[29:49] church
[29:50] now watch what the prophet says he says
[29:53] go to a Moses I'm going to send an angel
[29:55] before you to keep you in the way he
[29:57] said I love that now anyone knows that
[30:00] that angel that met Moses or guided
[30:03] Moses was the angel of the Covenant
[30:05] which was Jesus Christ the pillar of
[30:08] fire and he's the same yesterday today
[30:11] and forever it's the same Angel leading
[30:14] the church today LED that one dead
[30:19] thank you
[30:29] now let's just jump forward
[30:31] amen I'm trying to be mindful
[30:34] you know humans are something that if
[30:36] they feel uncomfortable they're not
[30:38] going to pay attention
[30:40] amen so I'm trying to be mindful
[30:43] I'm trying to keep you focused this
[30:45] morning
[30:47] amen
[30:50] the prophet of God
[30:53] in his second marriage
[30:56] he told Mida to go and pray about it you
[30:59] remember that
[31:01] she wasn't sure and he wasn't sure
[31:04] so he told her to go pray about it and
[31:06] he said I'll pray about it as well
[31:08] so she goes to pray about it
[31:12] and the Lord gives America the old I
[31:15] send you Elijah the prophet
[31:18] and what did the prophet tell her
[31:20] he said the Lord told me to marry you on
[31:23] October
[31:24] 20
[31:25] third
[31:32] saying are you playing around with
[31:33] numbers this morning
[31:34] why did the angel of the Lord tell
[31:37] brother Branham to get married October
[31:39] 23rd
[31:42] now I'm sure most of you don't know this
[31:44] this morning
[31:45] why
[31:49] October 23rd
[31:53] is a very significant date
[31:56] in the creation of the Earth
[32:00] the prophet in
[32:03] in the message 70 weeks of Daniel
[32:07] to find this in paragraph 195 you make a
[32:10] note of this
[32:13] in the message 70 weeks of Daniel
[32:15] is referencing
[32:19] a writer by the name of Usher
[32:22] and he makes reference to Ash's
[32:24] chronology
[32:27] and he's telling you how they had
[32:30] 1954 years
[32:33] that God dealt with the Jews that's the
[32:36] only point I want to get to that the
[32:37] prophet is referencing Usher
[32:40] so who is Asha
[32:45] amen
[32:46] everybody feeling okay
[32:49] Asha lived in the 17th century
[32:54] and he used the Bible to pinpoint the
[32:57] first day of world's creation
[33:01] and using the Bible and you know the
[33:03] Bible has dates
[33:05] and would
[33:07] pinpoint accuracy he says the first day
[33:10] of creation was October
[33:13] 23rd 4004
[33:18] before Christ
[33:24] right
[33:26] so four thousand and four years before
[33:28] Christ and watch how accurately he
[33:30] predicted it is because we believe that
[33:33] the Earth is six thousand years old
[33:38] come on now
[33:40] we believe that the Earth is 6 000 years
[33:42] old or creation since creation started
[33:45] amen
[33:48] now
[33:51] why would the Lord tell him get married
[33:52] on that day October 23rd if it did not
[33:57] carry a significance
[34:00] amen
[34:04] then you know what happened on October
[34:07] 23rd
[34:08] he was having
[34:10] a moment
[34:12] in the wilderness
[34:14] and he was remembering his wife
[34:17] because it was the anniversary you'll
[34:19] find this in the message of the guide
[34:22] and while he is remembering her
[34:25] he said he sits down
[34:27] and he says he looks before him
[34:30] and he sees he's changed
[34:34] he turns back young again
[34:37] how many of you know the testimony
[34:39] he said he was sitting there in virgin
[34:41] Timber
[34:42] he turned back young again
[34:46] is that coincidence
[34:51] I'll leave you with one more thought
[34:55] before we continue
[34:57] you can go and do the math on this
[35:01] it's 2023
[35:05] and we know the shortest search Angels
[35:08] when
[35:11] shortest churches
[35:14] 117 years
[35:16] everybody agree
[35:19] when did this church Aid start
[35:22] approximately 1906.
[35:26] you're gonna do your math
[35:30] I'm asking you have you made yourself
[35:32] ready
[35:34] could this be the year
[35:36] where God will finish up walking with
[35:39] the Gentiles
[35:40] could this be the year that the Lord is
[35:43] going to lead the church into the third
[35:45] port
[35:47] I'm talking about the supernatural
[35:49] I'm talking about where she left that
[35:51] said the Lord
[35:53] is everybody with me
[35:55] or if you're not with me amen you can
[35:57] leave
[35:58] we're looking for a supernatural Church
[36:01] we are preparing people for a Rapture
[36:03] amen amen lots of churches around the
[36:06] corner
[36:08] you want a church program or do you want
[36:10] to go in a reaction
[36:13] do you want to be prepared to see your
[36:15] lord and savior
[36:16] Jesus is coming soon how many times have
[36:19] you heard eventually screened that out
[36:22] Jesus is coming soon
[36:28] could this be the year the year the
[36:30] world enters a World War
[36:33] could this be the year they changed
[36:35] popes
[36:36] could this be the year
[36:39] then everything comes to its climax we
[36:43] don't know
[36:46] but watch
[36:47] and pray
[36:49] we're trying to keep you in Readiness of
[36:51] the hour
[36:54] God moves in times and Seasons doesn't
[36:56] he
[36:59] amen hallelujah I want to leave this
[37:01] with you do you know that every time in
[37:04] your natural cycle as well you know if
[37:06] you've gone extremely bulky I'll use the
[37:08] word bulky right the other word for it
[37:10] is fat
[37:11] okay come on somebody smile
[37:15] amen
[37:17] they tell you you need to change your
[37:19] diet
[37:23] and how long did they give you they say
[37:25] you must do this diet for how long
[37:27] don't they say three months
[37:29] 90 days
[37:33] nobody agrees
[37:37] three times four is twelve twelve weeks
[37:40] how many of you seen most diets tell you
[37:42] 12 weeks three months
[37:44] 90 days
[37:48] come on people
[37:51] how many of you have seen that
[37:53] I know you only read the message books
[37:59] how many of you just stumble across it
[38:01] somewhere
[38:04] what is three months
[38:06] if not I see
[38:08] what are they they're working according
[38:10] to a law
[38:12] because the Bible says in Ecclesiastes
[38:14] to everything there is a season what is
[38:17] a season three months
[38:23] then if the Bible is saying to
[38:25] everything there is a season
[38:27] and if you are going through something
[38:29] more than three months ask yourself why
[38:33] if there's not been a turnaround in that
[38:35] situation you either have not your lunch
[38:38] or less than you are not listening to
[38:39] God so God is keeping you in a prolonged
[38:41] season
[38:44] whether it's a season of sickness
[38:45] poverty
[38:47] whatever it is
[38:50] I mean if you want to walk by biblical
[38:51] laws this year
[38:52] and biblical principles the Bible says
[38:55] to everything there is a season
[38:58] to your situation and you say according
[39:00] to the Lord and the principle of God
[39:02] everything there is a season and I
[39:05] declare and I decree that this season
[39:07] shall pass from me
[39:08] [Music]
[39:10] you are sick shall be sick no more
[39:13] you are depressed shall be depressed no
[39:15] more amen you are bound shall be bound
[39:19] no more
[39:20] but you've got to accept God's will
[39:23] you know a pardon is not a pardon until
[39:25] it is received as a pardon and neither
[39:28] is the gospel trumpet of Jubilee if you
[39:31] are hearing the word of God telling you
[39:33] you can go free and you choose to remain
[39:35] in your situation then you are to blame
[39:38] for it
[39:39] what are you trusting God for let me ask
[39:42] you young man what are you trusting God
[39:43] for young woman what are you trusting
[39:46] God for
[39:50] having expectation in your heart
[39:52] trust the Lord believe the Lord
[39:56] amen I need to see a church rise up in
[40:00] faith I need to see young men young
[40:01] women of God rise up in the power of His
[40:04] word amen have a testimony have a power
[40:07] of an amen have a power of an Allelujah
[40:11] to worship a god a living God
[40:15] this is not a dear church this is not a
[40:17] good formal tradition amen but this is
[40:20] the Living Church of Jesus Christ

[40:25] you amen

[40:49] the promised land

[40:54] out of Judaism what was Judaism it was a
[40:57] traditional condition

[41:12] Ghost
[41:13] amen and then the Third Exodus The
[41:15] Exodus which we are now where the same
[41:18] Pillar of Fire takes the bride from the
[41:21] church world

[42:00] of Jesus Christ amen

[42:05] this message is designed to give you a
[42:08] body change amen there's no way with the
[42:12] message I know that Enoch was packing he

[42:16] have tried to pull him into the ark the
[42:18] message that he received will not permit
[42:21] him to go into the ark he had to take a
[42:23] flight

[42:26] tribulation but the message you have
[42:28] received will not permit you to go into
[42:30] the tribulation but you shall be changed

[43:21] you think amen amen that being in the
[43:23] upper room or something

[43:34] amen oh man amen there in the upper room
[43:38] the Holy Ghost brought itself out
[43:40] amongst 120 people

[48:35] for fog because it's 30 miles high and
[48:37] 27 miles across after it got up that
[48:40] high
[48:41] there's not even humidity or nothing up

[49:08] they told him we can't understand him
[49:12] Supernatural things of God cannot be
[49:14] explained by man

[50:08] tell them scientists about that

[50:18] he says cast not your purse Before Swine
[50:20] Jesus said not to I have no leadings to
[50:23] do it
[50:25] yet living right in the city
[50:27] there where they was calling for it I
[50:31] thought I'd go down the Holy Spirit the
[50:34] angel of God
[50:36] stay away amen
[50:38] it's not to them go back and tell the
[50:42] Tabernacle

[50:49] you

[51:01] for you see amen and you understand
[51:03] these things
