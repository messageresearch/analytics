========================================

amen you find here that God is sending somebody God is saying that he's going to send somebody but he's sending somebody for a reason because the condition of the people are not where God wants them to be so that's the context he's saying behold I will send you so I'm going to send you Jeff I'm going to send you Joshua I'm going to send you Caleb I'm going to send you Tyler I'm going to send you a prophet in the spirit of Elijah amen before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord yes so God is going to pronounce judgment on the world or judgment is coming yes but he wants to save a people amen so that's why he's sending a prophet and the word of the Lord comes to a prophet so we know if he's sending Elijah the prophet he must be coming with a word so what's the purpose of sending him it's in verse six he's going to turn the heart of the fathers to the children we know that was in John the Baptist and the second part and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the with a curse amen let's pray father we come before you this evening Lord our hearts are humble before you we lord want to prostrate ourself before you now and say there is nothing good in us the goodness of our God is found in US Lord Jesus we thank you Lord that we can live in your righteousness by faith we believe you oh God and I pray Lord you'll speak to us through your precious word now and I pray Lord that you'll bring Clarity to your word oh God take away my own thoughts my own ideas my own desires and I pray Lord the Holy Ghost father will be Lord a shining light through me oh God let your glory seen in this place I ask in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated amen before I go on I want to read a quote to TI with that Malachi chapter 4 he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers now watch where God starts God starts at the heart God is going to do a work and he realizes that the Throne of a man is in his heart so he has to start with the heart so Malachi 4 is going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and two he will reveal the mystery of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the heart of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so yes so the most powerful people on the Earth right now is the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Sons and Daughters of God yes the most powerful people when we are looking for a church and we want to see the Church of the Living God the one amen is a continuation of the Disciples of the Apostles we ought to be looking no further than ourselves amen hallelujah if there's a lack there's a problem if there's a deficiency there's a problem if somebody is vexed with a spirit you need to get to the Apostles of this hour you need to get the the Disciples of this hour and who will you go to yes amen is there a church powerful enough that you can have confidence to go to yes amen so our our thoughts so the heart of that scripture is that these people's hearts who Elijah the prophet coming to their hearts are filled with fear there is no faith there yeah so he is going to bring a message the purpose of sending Elijah is to turn your heart to not not nothingness is to turn your heart back to perfect [Music] Faith so I am saying after these years that we have received the message of the hour where is the church with perfect Faith amen amen and we've got to be hungry after it we've got to ask these questions and we've got to amen go after it yes and sometimes you know the Bible says as a man think in his heart so is he right yes so sometimes before we can even move our thoughts Hold Us bound a person don't have to say a word but his actions already tell you if he is a faithful man or if he's a man of fear a man who doesn't take action is a man of fear but a man who takes actions and will believe God at his word is a man of Faith so a person can even speak a positive word but in his heart he's full of fear word will have no impact it's like that boy walking through the graveyard whistling acting like he's brave but in his heart he is fearful I'm trying to ask you what is our heart condition amen what is stopping us from from moving into perfect Faith what is stopping us from getting to what God has visioned for our lives I saying that our thoughts are holding us bound we are thinking too low thoughts our thoughts are too Earthly minded and I'm saying that we as a church should not be happy with that and it's not just me saying it's the travail of the spirit to say Amen that all things are ready now and we are to be moving up to a higher Dimension we are to be the Church of the Living God on the earth now amen so a man whose heart is full of fear but speaking positive words his words mean nothing so we've got to be liberated in the mind and in our thoughts a heart that is not bound by fear then then faith can take a hold yes and what we speak we can have now you would know what I'm saying because in mark 11:24 amen let's just read it because if we're going to do it the teaching then I need to show you the scripture for it praise the Lord Jesus is going to revealed to the man whose heart is full of faith and I'm going to make a comment on prayer now Mark 11:24 we know 23 what it deals with but 24 deals with this therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen where must you believe Jesus told us in 23 you believe in your heart yes so when I'm saying believe in your heart I'm saying our thoughts can't be hurly minded so in Isaiah 55 it says my thoughts are higher than your thoughts am my ways are higher than your ways now if I'm going to bring it down to this I'm going to tell you that the prophet showed us exactly where God is now he said he he was God above us then when he he the word was made flesh and dwelt in Jesus he was God With Us and and the last part somebody tell me he God sorry who in you really what are powerful people God takes residency upon the throne of our heart but are we conscious of that are we conscious of it do we walk with that Consciousness God walking through these bodies amen so think higher thoughts and his ways are not our ways for he says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than yours and my thoughts higher than your thoughts amen okay so I ask a question how many of us love God Amen that's going to have a meaning for us because to love him is to obey his word and then his word is not Grievous to us we know those are scriptures so if we ask ourselves are we hungry for God are we really hungry are we pursuing his presence not casual coming to church but are we hry for God are we pursuing his presence do and and we know that that is measurable yes the pursuit of his presence is measurable we can measure it by time spend in his presence we can measure it by the things we do to be half to the heart of God Amen so and and another question are we because if we saying God is in us are we available for God to use us yes God needs hands are you available God needs feet are you available God needs ears are you available God needs eyes are you available God needs a voice are we available am amen hallelujah now when we are seeing that Jesus is saying in mark 11:24 that prayer when you speak when you pray you believe that you have already received what you have asked so I'm saying prayer becomes prophecy amen thank you Lord think about it your prayer moves from prayer Amen to prophecy because what you are praying for is what you have already you believe you have already received it yes come on now think about it Hallelujah your prayer is moving past a petition and I want to say that prayer is a legal action prayer is legal amen it's the most powerful weapon given to access the throne room of God and bring down his presence so prayer is a legal action of faithful people an anointed prayer is announcing what is already going to happen am I'm going to read it again when you pray whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so I'm not just praying amen hoping that God answers me I am praying a prophetic prayer believing that I've already received what I have asked for my prayer becomes prophecy Hallelujah so I say prophesy amen and prophesy again amen amen now I'm going to ask a question how many Of You' been praying for things amen and I'm talking about this year now and that you are still waiting for the answer can I see your hands maybe you're still trusting the Lord and he's still going to answer you amen there's still a breakthrough coming Hallelujah so I'm saying anointed prayer is announcing already what is going to happen yes Hallelujah we don't just pray and pray and pray and and hope that it happens Lord when are you going to answer prayer amen is a prophecy that you know God is already answered and then you walk in that Victory yes praise the Lord so prayer moves Beyond a request and a petition to believe amen that you have already received what you have asked for and that becomes prophecy I'm saying that again so prophetic words are spoken over our lives through prayer and what is that the groaning of the spirit in Romans 8 the groaning of the spirit goes beyond words the Bible says when we don't know what to pray the spirit makes groanings for us how many of you have experienced that the spirit making groanings for you come on that's Bible now Hallelujah that your groanings in the spirit goes beyond words that you don't even know how to pray but the Holy Ghost In You makes petitions make intercessions a travailing the prophet of God says here it's not three different gods three officers of one God God above us in the father God With Us in the son cleansing his way condescending coming down making a way for me to get back where to Eden right and bring his people back to manifested sons of God like he had them in the garden of Eden amen The Whole World's groaning and waiting for that hour for the manifestation of the sons of God yes he has no voice tonight but our voice he has no hands but our hands he has your hands that's whose hands it is he said I am the vine you are the branches that's in the message it is I so as you Ponder upon these things and the roman8 man I want to ask you what does the Fulfillment of the manifestation of the sons look like amen when you are looking for the manifestations of the Son of God what will it look like how will it impact the Earth what is the expectation upon the sons of God who are to be made known manifestation means to be made known what is our expectation when we see the sons of God made known what are we expecting them to do what will that prophecy fulfill look like we can quote it and say all creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God but what will that look like what is our expectation regarding that scripture yes I'm not going to give you the answer right now but I want you to ponder higher thoughts I want you to think higher thoughts I I want you to ponder upon these things Lord if I am to fulfill that scripture then what is your expectation for me when I am made known amen hallelujah if we go to the Book of Mark chapter 7 tonight we're going to have a prayer meeting amen so I'm just bringing a little word of exaltation and the reason why I'm announcing this is because there's a there's a groaning and a travailing inside of me and we're going to announce a service soon maybe in the week or next week that's not going to be comfortable for us and and and really we are not expecting everyone to respond to it even though we'd like everyone to respond to it because it's going to be unusual it's going to be inconvenient it's going to be out of the ordinary but it's for people who want to pursue his presence amen hallelujah the Bible says here I'm just looking at it now and you watch how the spirit is typing things here amen dropping in things here Mark 7 and it happens to be verse 24 here and from then he rose talking about our lord Jesus now and when now who is Jesus Jesus the word made flesh everybody agree so he's the word made flesh and he went into the borders of Tai and sodon and entered into an house and would have no man know it so the word was a hidden word meaning it wasn't easy to find everybody can read that the word was hidden the word made flesh amen but watch Faith Can Do impossible things amen faith can make you find the hidden word amen it says for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him now Faith cometh by the hearing of the word so this woman heard about Jesus casting out demons yes and it Faith grew in her so she went to find the hidden word and came and fell at his feet watch a posture a one of worship and the woman was Greek Ser phenician by NA and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled talking about Israel for it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs now how many of you know Jesus words there is as good as let there be light so when he's saying I want the children of Israel to eat first before I can speak to you Greek woman I'm not going to pay any attention to your request about casting out a demon here yes watch your faith now and she answered and said unto him y Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs now I want you to notice a response this woman is a Greek woman she don't know the scriptures she heard about Jesus so she's got no her response is not based on the word yes her response is based upon the behavior and the nature of dogs she's saying yeah Lord but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table I want you to see how God views Faith yes she had no word she didn't quote back a scripture to the Lord her response was based on the behavior of a dog that the dog even eats the crumbs that falls from the m table she observed something in nature and he said unto her for this saying go thy way watch how he changes his words now he's even answering her out of season didn't he just announce it's now season for the word to go to the children of Israel yes but because of her faith he pulls her into the season hello some of you just raise your hands that you're still expecting God to answer your prayer Lord I'm trying to help you here but what is your faith what is your heart has Malachi 4 turned your heart back to Faith perfect Faith then you shall have what you desire I'm trying to pull you into season now by showing you through the word of God what is your response amen amen for this saying what's saying she didn't quote the word I'm trying to show you something she did not quote the word she quoted a natural observation of dogs behavior and he said for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter [Music] I'm saying it's twofold her faith caused the devil to run away combined with Jesus her faith in Jesus caused the devil to live and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed yes now your needs vary your needs vary from healing to needs to Gyra Amen to Salvation of love ones I saying your response and your hard attitude right now when you go home you can find them in a different condition oh come on now I need to pull you up into Faith now because you are not ordinary come on you are not ordinary people right now the faith in your heart can pull your loved ones in and when you get home you find them in a different condition can I get somebody to connect with that thank you you say oh you're coming up with uh one example let me show you another example how me feel like another example praise the Lord let's turn to Matthew amen I didn't take this chapter down for some reason but he here we're talking about the Centurion Amen Let me just show you this very quickly even if you don't want to turn there amen but if somebody can find the chapter I've only got the verse for some reason I didn't copy the chapter but it's also found in Luke chap 7 and John chapter 4 it says and when Jesus entered capernium now watch all of these things Jesus is extending his borders he went into Tha and sudon and now he's going into capernia he's not staying isolated the word is extending their borders is in Matthew chapter 8 thank you brother s amen verse five yes that's it so those of you following in your Bible you can read he says there came a centurion now watch I want you to understand the Centurion is not a Christian hello the Centurion is not a Christian he's not a follower of Jesus they came a centu unto him beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lied at home sick of the pulsy grievously tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him there again the word spoken this is what I am going to do I'm going to come there and I'm going to heal it the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed Centurion where are you getting this theology from yes let's find out where the Centurion is getting his theology from next verse he says I am observing something in the army that I am in this is not based on any word he says I am a man under Authority having soes under me yes and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard it he marveled and said un to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel did he go to scripture No he was looking at a natural type that I is an mortal man I command Authority this man he's commanding spiritual Realms yes he says I say unto you that many shall come from the East and the West shall sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness they shall be weeping and nashing of teeth watch he's bringing a condemnation based on this man's confession because he's saying that they will not meet the this fith level yes then he goes back to him says Jesus said to the Centurion go thy way and H thou has believed I'm saying even if your expectation supersedes and it seems to be the most amen fascinating thing or thing that is too unbelievable Jesus is saying has you believe it yes I'm saying if SS never found a cure for something yet as you believe it you shall receive it [Music] I'm saying if s says that you are only given one man to live but as you believe amen praise the Lord go thy way and as thou Hast believed so shall it be done unto thee amen and the servant was healed in the selfs hour so ask yourself what was the belief in the C Ian heart Jesus just told him as you are believing you're going to receive it so I am saying the centurion's in the centurion's heart he was believing his servant was going to be healed at same hour yes Jesus just told him as you are believing you're going to receive it so I'm showing you the heart of the Centurian was believing that when Jesus speaks he's going to be healed at same hour I am saying Jesus is speaking to you now and what is in your heart you shall receive it as you desire it right now praise the Lord amen amen I think it's Matthew chapter 18 amen I need to close now got 5 minutes before we can go to prayer amen hallelujah is it Luke chapter [Music] 18 Luke chapter 18 and he spake a parable to them to this end that men always that men ought always to pray amen and he SP make a parable unto the end time people and said unto them that you can pray when you feel like that you can pray casually he says that men ought always to pray somebody say always and not to faint don't get tired don't get weary but pray amen you see apart from us being a church of faith I want us to be a Praying Church saying now this is Jesus saying there was in this in a city a judge who feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God no regard man yet because this woman troubleth me I will avenge her L by a continual coming she weary me out you see how the Lord is saying you don't go Weary by praying you can wear the Lord out let me put it that way by a continual coming to him now watch he turns it into the kingdom now he says hear what the unjust judge said and shall not God now watch I'm going to show you what kind of people the elect of God are it's written here here what the unjust judge said and shall not God avenge his own elect what does his own elect do Jesus who cry day and night unto him amen so God's elect cries day and night unto him wasn't there a marking Angel sent yes to Mark those in the city who sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city so he's saying this is my elect how many of us are now saying we are God's elect but here's the scripture God is defining his elect he elect is the ones who cry day and night unto him though he be long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh oh my word shall he find faith on the earth he is asking when Luke 17:30 is fulfilled will there be a people of Faith raiseed up come on now don't be don't be dull that was the first son of man coming there but Luke 7 1730 spoke about even when the son of man shall reveal himself in the end time through a prophet and I say through more than a prophet I said the son of man is now revealing himself through the bride I said amen now he's saying when the Son of Man reveals himself again will he find the people of Faith are you the people of Faith hallelujah amen hallelujah that's the Sodom sign that we have seen amen Hallelujah with his back turned to the audience he discerned the heart yes and two amen two angels went down to Sodom preaching a bully Graham and an all Roberts oh it's a Sodom sign praise the Lord so we need Amen to have an abounding faith I'm so glad that Revelation 10 doesn't read amen like amen the mighty Angel gave the book to the Revelation 10:7 Angel and the Revelation 10 angel had the book and the angel said go and take the book from Revelation 10:7 Angel yes that's not how the reading goes the reading knew the writer of the book knew that the the literal body of the seventh angel will be taken off the scene but his voice will Thunder out and then the same angel that connected with that Revelation 10:7 angel in the cave in 1946 he's the same angel that will connect conect with us now we cannot be successful in the message of the hour without a connection to the angel of the Lord no Ministry or progress in this hour unless he connects with the angel of the Lord unless he connects with the voice of the Resurrection am amen that's right praise the Lord amen so he's saying there's going to be the son of man is going to be revealing himself through a many membered body but can we remain in faith and persistently until we receive what we ask for I am saying amen let's just take it off our just our natural asking now for now for a moment take it off your natural asking take it higher amen say Lord help me to fulfill all my prophecies amen pull me into prophecy Lord pull me into season amen what are we believing for we know the parable of the friend who comes at midnight amen hallelujah praise the Lord yes and you know the friend comes at midnight I said the friend comes at midnight he comes at An Inconvenient hour that's right amen praise the Lord and say friend lend me three Loaves and the friend is amen he says I have a visit who has come and I have nothing to give him to eat and he says now the man in the house the friend who's sleeping says don't trouble me yes for the door is now shut and my children are in bed with me I cannot rise and give thee so the man has already spoken I can't come to you go away he says I say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of the importunity that word means persistent pestering and demanding he will rise up and give him as many as he needs amen I'm going to close it now and tell you that God is looking for a heart that's turned yes so maybe amen our heart posture wasn't the right way and our attitude towards the Lord and maybe even to pray is not the right way God honors a man who can turn his heart God realized he can work with the children of Israel and he sent Elijah on Mount to turn their hearts on the mount carel Showdown we find here in the book of Kings chapter 21 God is pronouncing to King aab amen now we know King ABAB was a wicked King he married Jezebel right he was he killed an innocent man he took his property took took his inheritance but God sends Elijah the prophet to tell him that he was going to utterly burn him up and cut off every male from his lineage right but hearing the words of Elijah changed the heart of aab the Bible says that he walked softly before the Lord and he he he took these words to heart and he tore his clothes and he put sacko instead of his Royal garments he fasted amen and he didn't let the words of Elijah take root to his heart God took notice and the Lord told Elijah have you seen how aab has humbled himself before me I'm I'm trying to show you something here he's self humbling is what God took notice of Amen no matter how Wicked he was God is looking for a man who can humble himself change his heart we know the story of ezekiah as well prophecy came over him get ready you're going to die humbles himself why scripture If my people who are called by my name amen will humble themselves and pray I will hear from Heaven I will come and I will heal the land amen amen so is this not God's window that was ahab's window of opportunity I am saying that the tering we're almost ready for lift off now to change Dimensions yes but this little period that we have this window of Grace is it not because God wants us to change our hearts and turn our hearts like the message was intended to do back to perfect faith if you say no then you're a man of perfect faith if you say no you're a man of perfect faith and what you speak must happen hallelujah amen so instead of us what what am I trying to show you instead of us trying to turn the heart of God God wants us to turn our hearts so he uses situations and different things to turn our hearts amen and sometimes if it's not there in faith God will present an opportunity to us to make us rise up in faith amen remember that okay we got many more examples you can find there Moses God wanted to slay the children of Israel Moses stepped into a role of intercession amen and God Amen God didn't kill him immediately amen ninev you know ninev God told them if you don't repent I'm going to come and kill you all what happened when they heard Jonah's message sir amen the humility of the king of Nineveh and the people no one was excluded from the prayer no one was excluded from the saot no one was exempt from the fasting and the repentance are you hope you hear what I'm saying don't think you're exclusive I am saying nobody was excluded nobody could say of the children of of the people of Nineveh you know what you the king and the 10 go and do that we'll just sit here you all appease God's Wrath nobody was exempt am I saying nobody in this church is exempt from pursuing the presence of God so what is God looking for those hearts who were fully committed to him he's looking for hearts amen full of honesty yes amen that will turn from sin turn away from sin that people God is looking for this church I'm closing now God is looking for people who not only talk about prayer but pray hallelujah thank you Lord amen don't just talk about turning from sin but actually turn away from sin don't just talk about reading the Bible but actually read the Bible so how many of you want more of God how many of you want more of God hallelujah you want more of God I'm giving you all of God am than who else wants more of God if you telling me I got more of God on my lap you see we we like phrases we like saying I want more of God makes me sound religious amen but more of God all of God is right here amen so when we are saying we want more of God well the word was made flesh what dwelt amongst us this is no different from God God is as good as his word hallelujah yes you mean the seven seal scroll book was the Bible became a new book some of you got shocked when I said yeah there's more of God here cuz then you realize how you beting all of God and how much time you really you saying I want all of God God where are you Mark chapter 7 as we close I say I'm closing closing I got to close amen but the spirit needs to get a point across I guess amen trying to show you the condition of the heart amen he says here in verse six he answered and said unto them while as asaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me I'm in the message where's your heart amen how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men laying aside the Commandment of God you hold the tradition of men now we don't want that to be asked I'm just trying to show you how people can confess something with their lips but their heart is somewhere else God is not looking for that amen Romans chapter 10 quickly now Romans chapter 10 verse 8 but what say it the word is neither even in thy mouth and in th hope you can see the connection amen from the beginning I've been speaking about what's coming out of your mouth but what's in your heart the word must be in your mouth but the word must also be in Your Heart Right This is scripture now the word is neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God had raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture sayth whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so true believing is to believe from the heart and a True Confession is to confess what is already in your heart our words as a man think in his heart so the word of faith in our heart amen must come forth now I tell you now when your when your thoughts speak louder than your word when your heart is full of Faith your thoughts govern who you are amen just your thoughts I'm trying to tell you that you have a Consciousness yes that you're a spirit man I'm this is a very deep thing that the prophet speaks about Consciousness and a subconscious you know what the prophet is saying those two conscious are so close together in a prophetic realm that he can be awake and he can see things right how many if you know the prophet explained that so what will be the people who are so attuned to the spirit I'm talking about your spirit your spirit being so attuned to your spirit being because when I read Revelation 101 there's a people who's asked to prophesy so if you have to prophesy you have to be a prophetic voice and to be a prophetic voice you got to have a higher Consciousness yes so your spirit mans to be so aligned yes that even your thoughts catch amen it's discernment you can pick up right hallelujah amen I told you God's ways are higher than our ways amen let's leave it there let's stand together give God an ank up of praise worthy to be praised hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen this is a launching pad am amen what we spoke tonight is going to be a launching pad for where the Lord wants to take us we are not called to be ordinary amen I I feel like I am not called to be ordinary how many of you feel you are not called to be ordinary you are not to go with the flow yes of things amen amen I want to be like that salmon who swimming against the crowd right going back to father's home amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen we can turn the camera off amen hallelujah ljah
