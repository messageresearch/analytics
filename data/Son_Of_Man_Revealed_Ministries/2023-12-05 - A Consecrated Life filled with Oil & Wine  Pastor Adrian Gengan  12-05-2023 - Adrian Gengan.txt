let Moses Speak O God yes and father tonight we want more of you tonight father [Music] will ask in Jesus name amen amen amen ritual in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen I'm actually surprised amen and I think we can give the Lord a good hand clip of praise because he was doing a good work in US amen he's able to finish it Hallelujah amen and I believe amen you have come with that expectation in our hearts when we initially thought of this we said you know it was just a desire we had and then the prophet confirmed it with that message we were listening to speak to the mountain and then we we thought okay let's just leave it to anyone wants to come it's not a compulsory service but amen I can see the Zeal in your heart amen and the Lord is pleased with you amen so we are now in the second watch [Music] amen you know the first watch starts at six six to nine second watch is nine two twelve so we're approaching the Third Watch amen and at midnight if you do a study on midnight you know things Shake prison shake when the Praises go up at midnight Third Watch starts the Third Watch amen hallelujah so we're moving from the second to the third you get what I mean amen so the third call has been open to us the major part the opening of the word yeah amen but we are Desiring another part of their third pool to be opened up unto us yes amen so this evening for a little thought amen you know no service is complete without the reading of the word so have a little excitation amen so this is our 23 hour service we're approaching the 23rd hour amen so it consecrated a life filled with oil and wine amen filled with oil and wine amen hallelujah you know anytime there's a consecration oil is required amen amen wine is required amen so we'll take our reading amen from The Book of Romans chapter 12 verse 1 and 2. it says I beseech thee therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world see the scripture is talking about consecration but be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen that you may prove what is what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you see we've got a part to prove brother Brandon would go on and say that this bride is going to prove to Satan that she's not like the first Eve amen and she will not fall like the first Eve so we got a part to prove amen may the Lord that blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so we don't know how the service will go amen we just go as the Lord leads amen hallelujah amen so you know when we talk about consecration most people will not want to be a part of it but I'm glad to see majority of the church here and that we have a Zeal to be consecrated now consecrated means to be set apart amen and to be consecrated in fact consecration is actually the foundation of a Christian walk amen amen when you are building and your foundation is not built properly yeah yeah amen you can't come now to the roof path and then try and fix the foundation you're going to have problems with your building so consecration is very important in the Christian Life in the Christian walk amen amen hallelujah but we want to consecrate ourselves every step of the way and especially now in leadership in the darkest age amen we ought to be consecrating ourselves daily amen the prophet says that we backslide daily yes amen so we are to consecrate ourselves daily to be set apart Amen to love and live for God now consecrate also means to make holy or dedicate to a higher purpose to surrender everything die to self amen amen hallelujah so a Believer will consecrates himself amen gives his time give his own plans to God gives his position he gives himself he gives his all in consecration amen because living a consecrated life brings Joy amen peace the Bible says I will keep you in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me amen amen so we find the benefits of living a consecrated life are inexhaustible because he is the inexhaustible function of life and this is the reason one must dedicate their lives to God in order to enjoy the benefits amen amen now I don't believe you stayed awake this late in the night amen if you didn't have a Zeal to turn your life around amen you know in in our homes as well if things are just the same there comes a point in time where we want to renovate we want to change things up amen and if we can do that in the natural they even have something called Every Spring people want to do spring cleaning but in the natural if we can do these things how about we shake things up in our lives how about we don't just go continuing the same old way amen and we haven't gathered in a convenient hour because we purposed in our hearts if we said Lord we want to prove to you that we are serious and we are desperate for you amen otherwise we could have gathered at seven o'clock amen we could have gathered at the normal hour but yeah the prophet we find amen and these are some of the quotes we've been through I just want to reiterate it he says give me 500 people born of the spirit of God filled with the Holy Ghost and on fire for God Amen can anybody identify that being you amen amen filled with the spirit of God filled with the Holy Ghost and set on fire for God Amen listen to what he says now standing statement he says I'll do more for the kingdom of God in one year's time then the whole church has done in 2000 years amen the prophet just needed 500 people Born Again filled with a spirit on fire for God amen amen and I believe this is the church amen he may not be here physically but we are still under our messenger amen amen and we can do more for the kingdom of God in this year it's already started amen hallelujah amen you know there's going to be a group of people who finish the work yes who finish redemption's plan amen amen God's not going to call on angels to finish the work God is looking to you and me to finish the work amen so he says he goes on to say this group of people will believe in signs and wonders and miracles not make believe you know we got a lot of people walking around make believe yes we believe in signs and wonders yes we believe Amen in uh the sick being healed but you see no manifestation amen so we know don't want to walk around in Make Believe make believe like yes we believe Mark 16 but we never ever see the manifestation of it neither do we have the faith to speak it it says but truly born of the spirit of God that's God's program Hallelujah is God's program sitting and studying and and being intellectual is that what he's saying he's bringing it down to a manifestation amen hallelujah he says we just come back to that sincerity of the world if we come back to the sincerity of the word amen he says believe that so God can vindicate himself now he says now what shall you bring sincerity consecration he says that's where sincerity and sacredness five good people we got more than five now I can see we're competing for that spot of five amen but there's room for all but he said I just need five amen but amen I can see there's a competition here now nobody wants to be left behind everybody wants to be the five amen amen really filled with the spirit will do more in Phoenix than all the members we got in the message amen amen if they're consecrated to God in a sincere life amen yeah we don't care about pump and pride yeah we don't care about reputation amongst the community the message Community we want a consecrated life amen we want to Humble consecrated life where the spirit of God can move through us matters not whether we are recognized or not as long as we are recognized by heaven and we are backed by Heaven amen amen he says why now watch these people who are consecrated these five good people in Phoenix now I didn't change that name there I didn't put feelings he's not talking about Jeffersonville he actually says Phoenix we'll do more in Phoenix than all the members we got if they have consecrated a God in his sincere life he says because God will move his word through there through Phoenix to the people in Phoenix and vindicate that to be the truth and the first thing you know things are happening I got good news for you amen things have already started to happen amen amen this is just a continuation of things happening amen amen you can't hold him down you can't hold it down amen amen hallelujah now this consecrated life really requires oil and wine amen we come here and we see in Revelation 6 6 under the third seal it says see the hook not the oil and wine yes these two things are very important for a consecrated life amen amen if you had to look back you'll see the priesthood was set aside for a consecrated life they couldn't mingle with the rest of the people they had to be set apart amen amen amen but they had to be Anointed with the oil yes yes amen amen the garments had to be anointed you can read all about it in Exodus 20s 9 30 amen going into Leviticus and showing you how Aaron and his sons the priesthood had to be consecrated later on the same concept was taken to Kings and God anointed Kings how did he do it with the oil amen amen and we know yet is a picture of oil and wine amen we get oil from olives that's your olive plant there amen and you're getting wine from grapes Hallelujah and the spirit was speaking to us and telling us don't just be satisfied with grape juice let it ferment a bit amen amen because many people can drink grape juice and never get filled with the spirit never get stimulated but a wine that's fermented begins to stimulate you amen amen and you know there's something about this too that they are grown together these two plants are grown together amen when I started to look at it these two are very similar types of plants they grow in the same kind of climate amen and both of them require a certain amount of squeezing and pressing to get the nutrients out both go under the same process in order to get out that juice you got to squeeze it in order to get out that oil you got to squeeze it amen amen and God is squeezing us now amen getting out that oil under wine amen so wine and oil share similar similar traits amen because the Olive and the grapes are harvested crushed bottled and tested for Purity and quality now there's something about this why they grow these two trees together you see the Grapevine is the shorter ones there right and the olive trees are found growing together in The Vineyards both require a similar climate and the olive trees act as protection for the vines so they grow it like that you can see the Olive Tree is there forming protection for the vines amen amen now we know the natural types the spiritual amen hallelujah so what is it doing no I didn't write this right I copied it and I pasted it here this is a journal from farming and they are telling you that the olive trees act as protection for the grapevines shielding them against strong winds wins or Wars and stripes we wrestle not against flesh and blood but we're in a daily walk and you know the oil represents the Holy Spirit the oil is good and what does wine represent amen the stimulation of Revelation the Holy Ghost is protecting our Revelation in this time amen while millions are being deceived we will not be deceived because God has opened up our Revelation amen amen so watch The Olive Tree the the oil is protecting our Revelation in this time shielding us from winds from what in Strife amen amen hold back the winds amen hallelujah amen amen and you know what these two trees are they are self-pollinators amen because now look at how they type it but I'm going into a spiritual meaning neither rely on the help of insects Birds to pollinate their flowers no outside interference amen everything he comes from the inside amen we don't need these insects [Music] we are self-pollinating amen amen Hallelujah now one of the biggest differences between the two the olive oil the grape is that oil does not improve with age so oil is going to be put to use amen amen but wine gets better with age now follow their thought now because your Revelation when you first came in the message got better with age amen Ash Who let that wine ferment within you isn't your Revelation increasing in Christ amen because wine gets better with age but you better not store the oil you better put the oil to use amen yes you know what happens to olive oil if you keep it and you don't use it you have to throw it away amen so the Holy Spirit has got to be put to use amen amen amen hallelujah amen I'll try not to be too long I just want to hit these highlights amen the prophet now opening up this mystery in the third seal so oil and wine I just I took it out of a quote form and I put it into this form right this is all these quotes exact words he says oil and wine is associated together in the Bible oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit then he gives us two scriptures where Aaron before he went in there to be Anointed with oil amen now you say why am I talking to you about oil sorry about Aaron I'm not a priest yes you are that old priesthood was taken away there's a new priesthood here Christ is our high priest but he's got other priests on the Earth amen and we have to be Anointed with oil so he says oil is the holy spirit we have to be Anointed with the Holy Spirit and then he goes in Zechariah 4 12 oil coming out pouring through those two pipes and he says this is my spirit oil and then he gives us the third scripture Matthew 25 4 the wise virgin has oil in her lamp because she is Spirit-filled amen so I'm just hitting the highlights of what he says there and wine he says symbolizes stimulation of Revelation he goes on to say what is wine in the Bible refreshments amen the is the refreshment that comes from the presence of the Lord amen amen if you are struggling with something in your life maybe you're struggling amen with overcoming amen the flesh amen ask the Lord to come and give you the baptism of the holy spirit amen amen amen hallelujah say Lord you can cleanse me father from this whole life of sin amen the only thing that was given to man to prosper in this life was the New Birth outside of that we are going to fail so say Lord oh give me that new birth amen Hallelujah give me yeah you know what the new birth consists of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost amen labor amen cry out to god father change my life amen and as you begin to read his word he opens up his Revelation to you it gives you the wine to drink amen hallelujah amen Now watch how he brings us down here and this might be a bit you got to follow now right it's he's trying to type the both he says when the truth of the promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil they get all stimulated yes amen and he says stimulated with Joyce and shouts amen hallelujah thank you for those three shouts amen they get stimulated with Joyce and shouts because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation became becomes so great it makes him behave himself abnormally amen thank you for that word brother Brandon amen you won't find that in Webster's but he began to behave themselves abnormally amen amen like David amen he was so filled with the spirit of God Amen and he was so anointed amen when they were bringing the ark back then he began to dance and begin to act abnormally yes yeah amen amen amen when we sit quiet amen that's not normal behavior [Music] amen we gotta get make a little noise amen Shake That demon off to you amen amen hallelujah oh bless his name glory be to his name some of us have got a deaf and damn Spirit only in the house of God everywhere else they call you big mouth everywhere else you're the life of the party amen but in the house of God there will be shots of joy and victory resounds in the tent of the righteous of the Lord amen begin to act anomaly Hallelujah yes amen hallelujah that's what happens you know you give somebody a bit of drink and eh nobody like them they got a mouse on them now so you see you can't hide your stimulation of Revelation if you're sitting quiet in church we know now you don't have stimulation of Revelation yeah yes yes you're not drunk we can't quote acts true on you and say these are drunk amen now watch he goes on to talk about this oil and wine he's talking about this peace now right this Rider because they were gonna he tells him not hurt not the oil and the wine he says if you catch some of my little flock that's filled with my oil and wine off the pure word and you're going to kill them don't force them to say any hail Mary or do anything like that or some of your Creeds yeah Don't force me to your Trinity Don't force me into your false baptism amen amen you keep your hands off of them amen they know where they're going for they are anointed with my oil yes amen amen and being Anointed with my oil they have the wine of Joy Hallelujah cause they know my Word of Promise I'm going to raise them up again don't hurt them don't go trying messing them up you see how God is rebuking Satan hurt not the oil and the wine amen and in this time he is refilling the oil yes yes amen and it's increasingly the intensity of the wine you are getting more intoxicated with the wine yes amen amen tell me you're not service after service getting more Revelation upon Revelation upon revelation amen amen some of you don't believe that let's go to Luke 10. Luke 10 quickly now Luke 10 yeah this lawyer comes to Jesus how can I have eternal life yes Jesus now takes a parable and a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho that talks about the church ages the transition from Ephesus to leadership amen I don't have time to label on this we preached on this before and they fell among certain Deeds they went to genome nationalism a bunch of Thieves struck him off his raiment there's only one Church age that he stripped up the arraignment and they don't know it yes what age is that so he said ask for us to recognize where this guy is amen amen and he wounded him and departed leaving him off dead so he's in a leadership Spirit leadership condition and they come down a certain priest that way and when they saw him he passed by the other side so notice now Billy Graham couldn't do anything for him yeah or you think I'm making this up these are Parables put there yes now likewise they Levites when he was at the place came and looked at him and passed the other way Oral Roberts amen and notice one was a priest one was a levite one day supposed to be consecrated yes one is supposed to be anointed to help this man when they're supposed to have compassion but they left him there amen but now there comes another man a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him amen now I want you to know this is not William Branham William Branham is still coming this is the son of man oh somebody this is the son of man coming down amen right when he saw in here compassion on him went to him and he bound up his wounds who bangs up the hoons amen who binds up the Brokenhearted amen and watch what he begins to do very unusual now have you ever seen a wounded man and you go pour oil and wine on him so he takes you straight from a natural story and he blows it up amen amen to a Supernatural story right pouring in oil pouring in wine amen which hospital you go in the boil and wine on you the man is off dead have you ever seen our dead man that got start pouring wine on him but the Lord knows how to raise you up from your condition spiritually this man needed a spiritual awakening and the only thing that could awaken him spiritually was oil and wine amen amen the Holy Ghost and the stimulation of Revelation that's the opening of the word amen and he set him on his own peace a peace represents power and the fourth piece flying in this age amen he sets him up on a flying eagle amen amen amen amen oh Hallelujah walk with the spirit of God now come on there's oil and wine there amen there's the son of man there he sets him on his own beast and he brings him into the inner courts into the holiest of holies amen and took care of him amen yes amen and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pulls and he gives you to Branham the host amen amen he comes you to the cave you should have two sons amen he gives him two pools and he says unto him take care of him amen and whatsoever thou spendest when I come I will repay thee amen now watch what he does then he lives in two pools but he gives the third for the man to speak amen he says whatsoever he spend it more so the man could maybe didn't want to spend more but if he ever has free to realize that the price is already paid amen that the son of man had already said that you can operate the third pool he says when I come again I will repay you amen so that third pool is actually a secret amen amen that's why it's not written there it's a secret he leaves two pools and he leaves the third for the man to operate because the man must be able to speak in us I have need of this yeah amen amen I have need of this and whatsoever you need amen he shall give it to you amen amen amen so while you are here under the prophet under the host Don't Be Afraid Amen to speak amen speak the revelation of your faith amen hallelujah because the son of man has already made provision the son of man is already expecting you to speak and when he comes back he says will I find faith on the earth will I find a thoughtful faith will I find rapturing Faith amen yes amen don't be a to it now when he comes back do I have anything to repay you no this guy was very good eh he was satisfied with the first two pulls he didn't ask for nothing else and ordered room service now that's very expensive but if somebody ever tells you order what you can order what you want yes yes you go to town amen because he better have the backing to pay the bill otherwise don't tell you order what you want amen have any inexhaustible Fountain amen he must own a candle on a thousand years amen yes amen for him to tell you whatsoever you spend it more when I come back I will repay amen [Music] don't dabble with faith amen let your faith rise up to such a level amen that God Amen one day when he's having a conference and the accused of the Brethren is coming and he's mocking the men of God he's accused of the Brethren and he's saying all men are wicked and evil God tells him have you considered my servant job because right now he is boasting he has all the church world yes everyone is the seated now is the God of this evil age the Bible says he's the accused of the brethren amen and there's some set up in heaven where he can go and present himself and make accusation now you must be saying I've deceived the whole world but God is looking at you now have you considered my son yes have you considered my daughter he's not like them in all the Earth filled with my oil filled with my wine amen hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen how many of you want to say now don't be satisfied if you want to save more wine amen yes more he left the third part for you amen hallelujah one more scripture then we'll so what's Revelation 5 10 says he has made us unto our God Kings and Priests two things two things we are priests amen and we must be anointed as priests amen because the king ruled in his kingdom and everything is subject to him but in order for for you to operate in that level of authority as a king you have to become a priest because as a priest a priest lives a consecrated life amen totally separates from the cares of this life and he offers up spiritual sacrifices now I'm teaching you how to walk as a king on the Earth but the secret to walking in your dominion and your sonship Authority is in priesthood is in servantude amen hope you're catching this because a priest yeah in Hebrews 13 it says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name yes amen so as a priest we've got to offer up spiritual sacrifices I'm gonna say it again as a priest we've got to offer up spiritual sacrifices what our sacrifices giving thanks to his name giving praise to his name Amen in fact there's only one prerequisite to give thanks to the Lord to give praise to the Lord and what is that let everything that has been using the only time you exempt from that is if you don't have breath but the Bible says let everything that have breath praise the Lord amen do you have breath amen say praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah in order for you not to operate in this realm of the third pool in order for you to operate in this level become a priest become anointed amen become amen the one who is giving praise to God who is serving his fellow brothers you can walk in sonship authority yes he has made us Kings and Priests amen don't only walk around as a servant now it's a dual role you can't only be servant to them have no sense of authority because your submission to God will make room and he will lift you up to a sonship Authority amen amen blessed be his name in order to rule and Reign on the earth as a king and operate the spoken word we must live like a priest consecrated to the Lord and set apart for his glory amen amen now think of it every single servant of God that God used for his glory and the operating that realm of a king when I say King when he's when the word went forth it was fulfilled that's what the king does right when he speaks a word the entire Kingdom obese amen you are the king of this Earth amen hello [Music] operates in your kingdom yes yes amen hear what he says and humble thyself you know people want Power and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking there's consecration now yes we're not away from our topic amen get away from worldly thinking yes humble yourself before God Amen and then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building making a big lot of noise see because you are able to conquer yourself consecration and commit yourself to Christ consecration yeah to humble yourself before it that's really power amen amen you watch that man speak amen he speaks with authority because he knows his word he's backed amen amen hallelujah one more scripture amen Revelation 3 and 21 says to him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my Throne now before we go and inherit Heavenly things I want you to overcome the flesh because when you overcome the Heavenly places in his throne which is a tingly domain in his throne which is 2 million over the Earth come on now catch this to him who overcomes the flesh yes and walks after the spirit amen you are going to sit with him in his throne Ephesians 2 6 says yet raise us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah thank you sit in Heavenly places is more than a figure of speech amen it is the spiritual reality for the believer because of our Union with Christ we reap the benefit of his position of divine Authority amen why have we gathered here today in the 23rd hour is because we want to consecrate Our Lives amen you say I'm living a consecrated life rededicate your life God is fixing to move you in another way in another Realm he wants support we read all his quotes you read it then he wants to pour himself through you yeah yes yes tore himself out amen the world saw it through one man William Branham he's about to do it in a many-membered body amen we've had the wine and the wine has been getting stronger and stronger in fact we can't contain ourselves now this wine is really strong because they brought the best out for the in the last year yes yes amen and now is the time now is the season amen amen how many of you believe that yes that we are not just making a statement yes Hallelujah this is the word of the Lord yes Lord amen now is the time now is the season for the outpouring for the manifestation of the sons of God because spoken word sons of God are rising up in their power you ask the brothers here you ask the sisters how many of you have noticed sisters becoming more vocal in the church have you seen that amen amen that's a good sign you know why the prophet says you want to know any church he says watch the woman watch the woman amen amen [Music] so if the woman are coming in alignment with the word amen if the women are getting excited about the world and this is not a move of a man we are not hyping things up what's doing the change the word amen all we can do is preach the word preach the word and I tell you since it's here people are hungry for God Amen people have a renewed desire for God people are thirsting for God Amen and God's filling you up daily is filling you you can't tell me you're thirsty and you're hungry now the Lord is filling you daily amen some of you have seen his power so manifest Amen in your life amen outpouring that you can't even continue you can't believe it you got to pinch yourself he's outpouring himself in ways to us amen so I want to bring that little word of exhortation amen about the oil and the wine now it's tied to a consecrated life amen hallelujah thank you amen bless the name of Jesus glory be to his name let's just sing one song as we get to maybe the next part and we'll see how the Lord leads us now amen let's just sing the song together sweet sweet [Music] s flowing down to make me clean like a mighty rushing wings [Music] sweet so sweet anointing is pouring out the oil and wine all over me let's just stand together as we sing in sweet anointing sweet sweet anointing flowing flowing down to me make me clean my teeth sweet anointing pouring out the oil and wine for me amen let's sing amen we are standing on Holy Ground amen you believe the angels are here all around us amen gotta be here amen hallelujah Amen on my way to church I was telling the angel of the Lord you are young they are fixing things amen but I said if you can leave whatever you're doing and come here amen amen come fix us if you are fixing things on the earth here's the people who have gathered now yes desperate for his presence amen [Music] we are standing ending on whole ground and I know and I know that there are angels they're all around oh yes Let Us Praise so Let Us Praise Jesus Jesus found for we are
