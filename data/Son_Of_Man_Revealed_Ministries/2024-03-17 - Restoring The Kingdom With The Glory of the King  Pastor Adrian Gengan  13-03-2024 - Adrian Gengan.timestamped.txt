[0:12] 18 and it came to pass when he made
[0:15] mention of the Ark of God that he fell
[0:18] from off the seat backward by the side
[0:20] of the gate and his neck Breo and he
[0:23] died for he was an old man and heavy and
[0:27] he had judged Israel 40 years this is
[0:29] talking about
[0:30] Eli and his daughter-in-law Phineas
[0:34] wife was with child near to be delivered
[0:37] and when she heard the tidings that the
[0:39] heart of God was taken and that her
[0:42] father-in-law and her husband were dead
[0:44] she bowed herself and prevailed for
[0:47] pains Came Upon her and about the time
[0:50] of her death the woman that stood by
[0:53] her said unto her fear not for thou has
[0:56] born a son but she answered not NE
[1:00] neither did she regard it and she named
[1:02] the child ikabod saying the glory is
[1:06] departed from
[1:08] Israel because the Ark of God was
[1:12] taken and because of her father-in-law
[1:15] and a husband and she said the glory is
[1:19] departed from Israel for the Ark of God
[1:23] is
[1:24] taken amen praise the Lord let's read
[1:28] Revelation chap 3
[1:35] amen Revelation
[1:39] 3 verse 20 says behold I stand at the
[1:44] door and
[1:45] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:49] the door I will come in unto him and
[1:53] will s with him and he with me to him
[1:57] that overcometh will I grant to with me
[2:00] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[2:04] am sat down with my father in his throne
[2:07] he that ha in here let him hear what the
[2:09] spirit said unto the churches amen
[2:12] praise the Lord you may be
[2:19] seated if you can also open to Esther
[2:21] chapter
[2:27] 3 amen
[2:33] maybe we'll just read from verse chapter
[2:35] 4 there
[2:39] amen so in chapter 4 you're going to see
[2:42] there's a dialogue happening between
[2:44] Moriah atak and Esther we know that
[2:49] modai is typing the end time Prophet aak
[2:52] is typing the fold
[2:54] Ministry so the five for Ministry is
[2:56] getting a word from the end time prophet
[2:59] and taking it to the bride eser
[3:06] amen let's read from verse 8 also he
[3:09] gave him a copy of the writing of the
[3:10] decree that was given at shushan to
[3:12] destroy them to show it unto Esther and
[3:15] to declared unto her and to charge her
[3:18] that she should go in unto the
[3:20] king so this is Mori is saying get into
[3:24] the presence of the
[3:26] king get into his glory Realm amen amen
[3:32] hallelujah
[3:35] amen to make supplication unto him and
[3:39] to make request before him for a people
[3:42] and aak came and told Esther the words
[3:45] of moray you see that's typing there
[3:47] five-fold coming to the bride to repeat
[3:50] the words of the end time Prophet amen
[3:53] all the king's
[3:55] servants and the people of the king's
[3:57] provinces do know that whosoever whether
[4:00] man or woman shall come unto the king
[4:04] into the inner Court who is not called
[4:08] there is one law of his to put him to
[4:11] death except such to whom the king shall
[4:14] hold out the golden scepter that he may
[4:17] live but I have not been called to come
[4:22] in unto the king these 30
[4:26] days and they told
[4:30] to morah Esther's
[4:32] words then Moriah commanded to answer
[4:35] Esther think not with thyself that thou
[4:38] shallal Escape in the King's house more
[4:41] than all the Jews for if thou altogether
[4:44] holdest thyy peace at this time then
[4:47] shall their enlargement and deliverance
[4:49] arise to the Jews from another place but
[4:52] thou and thy father thou sh be destroyed
[4:55] for who knoweth whether Thou come into
[4:57] to the kingdom for such a time as this
[5:01] amen praise the Lord I'd like to speak
[5:04] amen this little topic amen we were
[5:07] speaking on the title deed and showing
[5:09] out the title deed is man's inheritance
[5:12] coming back to the Earth man's Glory
[5:15] coming back to the Earth amen so I'm
[5:18] going to title this restoring the
[5:20] kingdom with the glory of the king
[5:24] amen we an end time people are put here
[5:28] to restore
[5:30] the kingdom of God with the glory of the
[5:33] king amen amen hallelujah amen now just
[5:38] to background this on our first chapter
[5:41] we were reading there how the Ark of the
[5:44] Covenant got captured got taken away and
[5:48] when they are presenting the news that
[5:50] to Eli that the Ark of the Covenant was
[5:53] captured he fell backwards he broke his
[5:56] neck and he died we know the Ark of the
[5:58] Covenant is typing the word of of God
[6:00] when the word of God is taken away amen
[6:02] hallelujah from the people that is the
[6:05] glory of God leaving Israel yes because
[6:09] in the ark dwelt the presence of God the
[6:11] sh kind of glory amen amen so it so
[6:14] shook the prophet of God Eli amen that
[6:19] he he fell backwards he broke his neck
[6:22] when he saw the glory depart from the
[6:24] Kingdom of
[6:25] Israel amen hallelujah now I'm taking
[6:29] this three passages of scriptures to
[6:31] show you in typ then we're coming to the
[6:33] Book of Esther and you'll know that the
[6:36] Book of Esther starts out with the King
[6:38] wanting to display his glory he's got
[6:41] 127 provinces amen and he's displaying
[6:44] his glory he has his seven days of feast
[6:47] amen and His glory is being displayed
[6:50] throughout the kingdom but the highest
[6:52] form of his glory was going to be found
[6:55] in his wife but vasti refused to come
[6:58] out and show the king's glory amen amen
[7:03] he had shown all his wealth he had shown
[7:05] all his treasures he had shown
[7:07] everything that he had achieved in his
[7:08] life materially but here he was going to
[7:11] present the bone of his bone and the
[7:14] Flesh of his flesh but she rejected him
[7:17] yes amen what was she doing refusing to
[7:20] display his
[7:21] glory amen so we know that there's a
[7:24] search made and Esther is chosen in the
[7:27] place of Queen vasti amen for those of
[7:30] you that are familiar with What's
[7:32] Happening Here in the church ages you'll
[7:34] see the Apostle Paul and the early
[7:36] church started out in strength the glory
[7:40] of God was in the church if you're
[7:41] looking at Acts chapter 2 you'll see the
[7:43] glory of God come down in the form of
[7:45] the pillar of fire amen the Holy Ghost
[7:48] filling the people and you're seeing a
[7:50] super Church you're seeing a super race
[7:53] you're seeing an invincible Army in the
[7:55] book of Acts amen amen hallelujah but
[7:59] you what
[8:00] as the Roman Catholic system is coming
[8:03] in on the scene the glory of the Lord is
[8:06] departing amen amen amen hallelujah the
[8:10] glory of the Lord is departing so that
[8:13] through 6,000 through 2,000
[8:16] years six Church ages coming into the
[8:19] seventh you'll see that they kept
[8:21] rejecting God if you go and read
[8:22] Revelation chapter 3 amen you'll see how
[8:25] the Lord wants to come and reveal the
[8:27] glory but watch now something here we
[8:30] just read Revelation
[8:32] 3:2 when the glory is about to reach its
[8:35] Pinnacle and the
[8:37] highest The Glory gets shut out from the
[8:41] church amen because remember he starts
[8:44] out with Luther restoring justification
[8:47] then he goes with Wesley restoring
[8:49] sanctification the word is getting
[8:51] stronger but as the word gets stronger
[8:54] the word gets kicked out of the
[8:57] churches there's a total rejection of
[8:59] the word amen that's right and they
[9:02] crucify the word again but the Lord sets
[9:06] forth a word that if any man opens the
[9:09] door I've got the glory but it's outside
[9:12] the door amen but if there's somebody in
[9:15] there who can hear my words he that have
[9:18] in here within these churches let them
[9:20] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[9:22] church and if you can hear me and he's
[9:24] talking to the predestinated seeds he
[9:27] says if you hear me I will come in and I
[9:30] will s with you oh thank you Lord so the
[9:32] Lord amen has called us and we have all
[9:35] opened up the door to him amen
[9:37] hallelujah so we find the setting now
[9:39] I'm typing this with Esther you'll find
[9:41] it it progresses now to a time where
[9:44] there's a threat you know that Amon
[9:46] makes a law to kill all the Jews on a
[9:48] certain
[9:50] date amen so modai gets wind of this and
[9:54] he's writing to Esther and he's sending
[9:56] the message via
[9:58] ACH and this is where we at the point of
[10:00] the story is because the King was
[10:03] displaying his glory through all the
[10:05] kingdom watch the type now he shuts
[10:09] himself off and His glory is shut off
[10:12] from the rest of the Kingdom amen nobody
[10:16] can experience the glory of the king any
[10:19] man who comes into his glory will be
[10:21] killed any man who comes into his
[10:24] presence Uninvited will be
[10:28] killed Hallelujah notice the statement
[10:31] that Esther makes that he hasn't called
[10:34] me for 30 days and the lawyers that no
[10:38] man should come into His presence and
[10:40] even if they try to come the Royal
[10:42] scepter must be
[10:44] raised amen
[10:47] hallelujah but nobody wanted to take a
[10:50] chance nobody was bold enough to go into
[10:53] the king's presence amen amen hallelujah
[10:56] but it took a woman of Faith amen amen
[10:59] amen so remember without the glory of
[11:02] the king the kingdom is
[11:05] miserable the kingdom is wondering
[11:07] what's happening to our King yeah you
[11:09] know when they don't see the president
[11:10] for a while or they don't see the king
[11:12] for a while the country wonders what's
[11:15] happening amen so you the glory of the
[11:18] king he's cut off from the rest of the
[11:20] Kingdom all
[11:22] 127 provinces don't see the glory of the
[11:26] king the glory has departed like we read
[11:33] amen but there is one
[11:36] woman who can restore the kingdom with
[11:39] the glory of the king amen amen amen and
[11:43] she must be bold oh she must be
[11:46] courageous amen amen all she has is the
[11:49] word of the Prophet coming via atch amen
[11:53] amen there's nobody else sharing her on
[11:56] there's nobody else giving her the
[11:58] courage to go she is sitting as the and
[12:01] she has the position of Queen I ask you
[12:04] have you been married to the Lord Jesus
[12:06] Christ amen don't sit quiet in the house
[12:08] of the Lord amen I'm asking you a
[12:10] question amen have you been married to
[12:12] the Lord Jesus Christ in this time and
[12:14] season amen the only way the Earth will
[12:17] see the glory of God is through you and
[12:19] me yes amen amen and it takes an Esther
[12:22] to bring the glory of God back to the
[12:24] Earth
[12:25] amen amen so there's a woman that that
[12:29] shut out that's amen nobody is
[12:31] encouraging her nobody is telling her
[12:33] anything she is concerned herself that
[12:35] the King has not come out
[12:37] yet yes yes she's also concerned that
[12:41] the King has not come back
[12:44] yet wow amen are you concerned the king
[12:47] hasn't come back yet amen
[12:50] hallelujah so she says one night she
[12:53] singing even so come Lord Jesus come
[12:58] amen even so she's longing to see him
[13:03] amen amen she sings Oh I want to see him
[13:07] look upon his face she wants the glory
[13:11] back so she will risk it
[13:14] all amen for the preservation of
[13:17] life amen so Esther goes on a
[13:22] fast and she says I will put neither
[13:24] food nor drink in my mouth and you all
[13:26] fast with me but she's going into the
[13:29] presence of the king what is it
[13:31] consecration amen amen it takes a
[13:34] consecration to get into the presence of
[13:36] the king yes amen amen she didn't care
[13:40] about her life she didn't care about
[13:42] risking her life whether she was going
[13:44] to die she said if I perish I
[13:47] perish how many if you feel that way
[13:50] amen unless I get the full baptism of
[13:52] the Holy Ghost unless I get his full
[13:54] anointing and His glory in this time and
[13:56] season if I perish I perish but I must
[13:59] ask of him amen amen thank you amen
[14:03] praise the Lord so we find here she gets
[14:06] into the presence of the
[14:07] king
[14:09] amen and when she gets into the presence
[14:12] of the
[14:13] king the Royal scepter is
[14:16] raised amen and watch what happens now
[14:19] notice it's in Esther chapter
[14:22] 5 the king is Seated on his throne yes
[14:26] and he has the title deed Amen to the
[14:28] king om come on now and in Revelation 5
[14:33] amen the king steps out of the sanctuary
[14:35] oh yes and he's got the someone's got
[14:39] the title deed Revelation chapter 5 now
[14:42] amen but he comes and he takes the title
[14:45] Deed from the one sitting on the throne
[14:47] what is the title deed it's the right to
[14:50] man it's the inheritance of man it's
[14:52] man's inheritance to the Earth amen amen
[14:56] hallelujah amen you know we've been
[14:58] building up on this the past weeks so
[15:00] can't explain it again amen hallelujah
[15:03] how man lost it and where it ended up
[15:05] amen praise the Lord amen so watch
[15:08] Esther chapter 5 watch Revelation
[15:11] chapter 5 oh thank you Lord two kings
[15:15] amen and he's presenting to Esther and
[15:19] he says I'm going to give you half the
[15:21] kingdom amen what is your request yes
[15:24] amen what is your desire what is your
[15:27] request even to have to Kingdom I won't
[15:30] with all from you my Queen
[15:32] Esther why she opened up the door to his
[15:36] glory she opened up the door to his
[15:38] presence amen
[15:41] hallelujah amen so we find here after
[15:45] seven Church ages amen the glory got cut
[15:48] off from the church amen what they had
[15:51] seen in the early isua Pentecost Revival
[15:55] the outpouring of the gifts if they had
[15:57] stayed there long enough
[16:00] if they had not denominated around the
[16:02] evidence of the Holy Ghost he's speaking
[16:04] in tongues because there was much more
[16:06] to come amen yes amen amen amen the Lord
[16:10] was only starting the work to bring his
[16:12] full Glory back to the Earth amen
[16:14] because the fullness of the word was
[16:16] going to come yes amen he was going to
[16:19] bring back title deed to man's
[16:20] inheritance to the Earth amen but this
[16:23] amen hallelujah the early church
[16:25] denominated they formed organizations
[16:28] then you got the the lutherans wesan
[16:30] Pentecostals amen you got the Methodist
[16:32] Church split amen you got all kinds of
[16:34] denominations splitting from there each
[16:37] one denominating around their Church
[16:39] Creed and Dogma each one believing that
[16:41] the only way to Salvation is if you
[16:43] fellowship with them so they are finding
[16:46] salvation in the church but Salvation is
[16:48] only through Jesus Christ amen amen
[16:52] hallelujah amen by one Spirit we are all
[16:55] baptized into the body yes amen
[16:57] hallelujah so find here that the glory
[17:00] was out of the church but here was a man
[17:03] Hallelujah God connects with a man amen
[17:06] because God's Avenue is man and God
[17:08] works with man amen so this man is
[17:11] written off in the Bible amen hallelujah
[17:14] and he is here on the Earth but he was
[17:16] now quick in the
[17:17] scriptures amen and he has the legal
[17:20] Authority he has the legal right on the
[17:22] earth amen amen just like how Mary had
[17:25] the legal right on the earth the angel
[17:27] comes to Mary to say can I use your body
[17:30] and she gives him the legal right to use
[17:32] her
[17:34] body so the angel basically was asking
[17:37] this Prophet do not smoke do not drink
[17:39] do not defile your body from the time he
[17:41] was a little boy because when you grow
[17:43] older I have a work for you to do and
[17:46] now that he has grown older now comes
[17:48] the angel of God to connect with him and
[17:51] tell him about his strange and
[17:52] misunderstood life amen hallelujah amen
[17:56] and he tells him about how Moses was was
[17:58] given two signs you shall be given two
[18:00] signs and you'll take a Ministry of
[18:02] healing to the Nations Hallelujah but
[18:05] there that was not the only thing amen
[18:07] he was going to fulfill and light up
[18:09] Malachi 4:5 amen his ministry had come
[18:13] for you because Malachi 4:5 says behold
[18:17] I sent you amen Elijah the prophet yes
[18:21] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[18:22] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[18:25] children back to the faith of the
[18:27] fathers yes amen now initially we
[18:30] thought he was only going to turn our
[18:32] hearts all the way back to the original
[18:34] Pentecostal fathers but come to find out
[18:36] when he went in the back part of God's
[18:38] mind he was going to fulfill Ephesians
[18:40] chapter 1 that we were predestinated to
[18:43] be Sons and Daughters of God Amen that
[18:45] he was going to reveal to us our
[18:47] original condition our original spirit
[18:49] that we had and he's taking us back way
[18:52] before the beginning and now we are
[18:54] Eternal as God is eternal amen amen
[18:58] hallelujah
[18:59] amen oh praise the Lord amen amen
[19:03] hallelujah so there was one man who
[19:05] opened the door to the
[19:08] age
[19:09] hallelujah praise the Lord
[19:12] amen actually there's a quote where the
[19:14] Prophet says that that age
[19:18] ceased you know we said shortest Church
[19:21] age amen he says that age sees there and
[19:26] the door for the bride was opened yes
[19:29] amen
[19:31] amen the door for the bride was opened
[19:33] so we come into a bridal time oh yes
[19:37] Lord a time where only those remember
[19:40] he's speaking a word and saying if you
[19:42] open up the door so there's some that
[19:44] open up the door so he's only working
[19:46] with the ones where there is an Open
[19:48] Door amen hallelujah hallelujah thank
[19:51] you oh praise the Lord praise the Lord
[19:53] praise the Lord amen I pray amen
[19:56] hallelujah the holy spirit will Quicken
[19:57] the gene within you right now amen
[19:59] praise the Lord amen so Esther brings
[20:02] the glory of the king back out to the
[20:05] people amen but he presents to her now
[20:09] the title
[20:10] deed and he says to half the kingdom now
[20:13] remember our Lord Jesus Christ he says
[20:16] amen hallelujah that all power in heaven
[20:19] and in Earth is given unto me when he
[20:21] rose on high he rose triumphantly amen
[20:25] hallelujah praise the Lord so he's God
[20:28] of the heavens and he's God of the
[20:30] earth amen hallelujah there's a kingdom
[20:33] of God in heaven and there's a kingdom
[20:35] of God on Earth amen and he says to up
[20:37] the kingdom I given
[20:39] you thank you the kingdom of the
[20:43] earth I have given back to my bride I
[20:45] have given back to my people amen so we
[20:48] find here that the prophet's Ministry
[20:50] goes on Amen he's turned I don't know
[20:54] about you but I'm not looking for my
[20:56] heart to be turned back my heart is all
[20:58] already turned back can you get a
[21:00] witness here
[21:01] tonight my heart has already been turned
[21:04] back I am not looking for that anymore
[21:07] that scripture has already been
[21:08] fulfilled in my life can you testify and
[21:11] give God
[21:14] praise praise the Lord I'm not looking
[21:16] for Revelation 10:7 to be fulfilled the
[21:19] mystery of God revealed that mystery has
[21:22] already been revealed God is no longer a
[21:24] mystery to us amen hallelujah amen I'm
[21:28] not looking for Luke 17:30 to be
[21:30] fulfilled a son of man revealing the son
[21:33] of man that scripture has already been
[21:35] fulfilled there was the prophet of the
[21:37] age Who lit up those scriptures and he
[21:39] made those scriptures live amen yes
[21:42] that's
[21:43] right praise the Lord Revelation 10
[21:46] comes into life now because the prophet
[21:49] progresses all the
[21:51] way yes amen and this book that we see
[21:54] in Revelation chapter 5 is coming down
[21:56] in Revelation chapter 10 yes amen the
[21:59] title deed of man's inheritance what is
[22:01] that Bringing Down the glory of God Amen
[22:04] Bringing Down the will of God bringing
[22:06] back the mind of God to the Earth you
[22:09] remember what we spoke a few weeks ago
[22:11] that Eve left the
[22:14] guide Eve left a
[22:17] husband she had no guide to lead her yes
[22:21] amen just like our the church today has
[22:24] rejected the Holy Ghost they rejected
[22:26] the guide but this end time Eve knows
[22:29] that her Lifeline is to connect with the
[22:31] guide amen and that's why she has the
[22:33] mind of Christ because she has the word
[22:36] did did Eve have the word let's let's
[22:38] talk about this did Eve have the true
[22:40] word yes but she had no guide to lead
[22:44] her
[22:46] yes so he says the bride has the word
[22:50] that's pick up your pen and write now I
[22:52] mean the word is in the bride but she
[22:55] needs the guide amen she has the mind of
[22:58] Christ but she know needs to know what
[23:01] to do with the word you see Eve didn't
[23:04] know what to do with the
[23:06] word and the message came to take away
[23:08] all unbelief amen come on now there's no
[23:11] room for unbelief in my life there's no
[23:14] room for unbelief in the body of Christ
[23:16] so when there's no unbelief there's
[23:18] nothing for Satan to work with because
[23:20] Satan can only work through unbelief
[23:23] somebody give God praise amen this end
[23:25] time people amen message of the hour
[23:29] came to take away all unbelief amen so
[23:32] when all unbelief is taken out there's
[23:34] nothing for Satan to work in this bride
[23:36] therefore he is powerless before her yes
[23:39] amen he can only work through doubt and
[23:41] reasoning but the message came to
[23:43] eliminate all doubt and reasoning amen
[23:46] the message came to put us in our
[23:48] rightful estate so we find that the
[23:50] title deed of man's inheritance the
[23:52] title deed to the Earth is coming down
[23:54] in Revelation
[23:56] 10 Hallelujah am but the book can't
[24:00] remain in the hand of the Angel yes the
[24:03] glory of God can't remain in book form
[24:07] yes just like how scriptures Isaiah 7
[24:10] couldn't remain as a scripture Mary had
[24:13] to light up the scripture and allow God
[24:16] to use her body am there is scriptures
[24:18] in the Bible that you and I have to
[24:20] fulfill amen amen Greater Works than
[24:24] these shall he do for I go unto my
[24:26] father amen hallelujah amen if you say
[24:30] to this mountain be thou removed cast
[24:33] into the sea don't doubt in your heart
[24:35] but believe what you have said shall
[24:36] come to pass you shall have what you
[24:39] say now we know that Mark 11:23 could
[24:43] only be fulfilled in this time and the
[24:45] prophet of the age unlocked Mark 11:23
[24:49] there's not a recorded in all of history
[24:51] that any man operated Mark 11:23 beside
[24:56] this Prophet amen amen thank you Lord
[25:00] amen now we know that this book is
[25:03] coming to a
[25:04] prophet but it's also coming to a
[25:07] prophetic class of people amen this
[25:10] Bride is a prophetic class of people
[25:12] amen hallelujah because she must
[25:15] prophesy again amen so she's got a
[25:18] prophetic Ministry not only that the
[25:20] bride under a messenger becomes the
[25:23] final voice to the final age amen so
[25:25] she's taking this book it can't remain
[25:27] in the Ang Angel's hand so the
[25:29] instruction is given you go and take the
[25:31] book now who is this
[25:34] John John is a type of the Bride of
[25:36] Jesus Christ amen the same one is found
[25:39] in Revelation 5 the same one is not
[25:41] worthy to take the
[25:43] book but because the perfect one took
[25:46] the book amen and he redeemed man
[25:51] completely because of his faith in Jesus
[25:54] Christ amen he is totally cleansed from
[25:57] all his sins amen he is made perfect and
[26:00] he's put into his original state he seen
[26:03] as sinless he seen as spotless amen he's
[26:07] seen as a worthy one why the sacrifice
[26:10] had been accepted what he had been there
[26:12] doing there for 2000 years Amen in the
[26:15] sanctuary when he comes out amen it
[26:18] signifies that the sacrifice has been
[26:22] accepted therefore he can now take the
[26:24] title deed but the book don't belong in
[26:26] heaven it belongs on the Earth amen amen
[26:29] yes amen hallelujah you are made to be a
[26:32] God on the earth you are made to have
[26:34] dominion on the earth amen amen you were
[26:37] made to take control of every situation
[26:39] amen you don't let problems control you
[26:41] you don't let trials control you amen
[26:44] you control the trial you control the
[26:46] problem amen because within you is
[26:48] locked up Faith within you is locked up
[26:50] virtue within you is locked up knowledge
[26:53] within you is locked up patience within
[26:55] you is locked up Temperance within you
[26:56] is locked up godliness within you is
[26:58] locked up brotherly kindness amen there
[27:01] are no temptation that has overcome
[27:06] you thank you Lord amen so we find the
[27:10] title deed is back on the earth so like
[27:13] I said we are not waiting for that
[27:14] certain scriptures to be fulfilled and
[27:17] now now I'm going to say this now we are
[27:19] not waiting for the title deed to come
[27:21] back to the Earth the title deed is
[27:24] already in me I have already taken the
[27:26] book I have already heat in the book I
[27:29] have already digested the book and now I
[27:32] am the book manifest on the earth
[27:34] somebody give God praise
[27:37] amen
[27:38] amen hallelujah oh hallelujah amen with
[27:42] are people amen hallelujah an invincible
[27:45] Army amen there is no demon power that
[27:48] can stand before you amen every demon
[27:50] power must bow
[27:52] down so like Esther brought the glory of
[27:55] the king back to the people all 127
[27:59] provinces the commission is given to
[28:01] this end time bride you have taken this
[28:03] book and within you that's the glory of
[28:05] God come that's man's Glory come back to
[28:08] you and you know First Corinthians what
[28:10] it says man is the glory of
[28:12] God amen amen so by you taking the book
[28:16] by you coming back into your rightful
[28:18] position you are displaying the glory of
[28:20] God and thou must prophesy again and
[28:23] show the world that his glory is back on
[28:25] the earth so you be a people who who
[28:28] restore the kingdom of God with the
[28:30] glory of the king amen amen thank you
[28:34] Lord now there's a reason why the head
[28:37] appeared in the sky and not the entire
[28:40] body there's a reason why amen
[28:43] hallelujah the body must remain in
[28:45] Heaven until the restitution of all
[28:47] things is because the head appeared
[28:49] because he has another body now didn't
[28:51] the prophet says he has displayed
[28:53] himself in every way except the Corporal
[28:55] body because he has a body on the Earth
[28:59] so they were only looking for headship
[29:01] they were only looking to connect with
[29:02] the guide they were only looking to
[29:04] connect with the mind of Christ because
[29:05] he has the word and now the bride needs
[29:08] to know what to do with the word so he
[29:09] sends the guide to show the bride what
[29:12] must be done with the word amen amen if
[29:16] we are really being honest for many
[29:18] years the people didn't know what to do
[29:19] with the word they knew they had a word
[29:22] but they didn't know what to do with the
[29:24] word but now comes the revelation of it
[29:27] what to do with the word amen thank Lord
[29:32] amen amen prior to that they were
[29:35] quoting the sequence of events that how
[29:37] the word came to me they were focused on
[29:40] the surroundings it's like I'm going to
[29:42] say it in a veiled way like Rebecca can
[29:45] only tell everyone about how Ela came to
[29:48] her they were telling everyone how Eliza
[29:50] came to her amen but now she's already
[29:53] married to Isaac can she still tell the
[29:55] story amen does that become a Cal theme
[29:58] of her life how Ela came to be no she
[30:02] must not live in the glory realm of
[30:04] Isaac and she must produce the life of
[30:07] Isaac and you'll find that Rebecca is
[30:09] Barren and unfruitful but Isaac goes to
[30:13] praying for his wife Rebecca and she
[30:15] brings four twins hallu thank Youk you
[30:19] Lord now that's also
[30:23] dangerous because now comes Jacob and
[30:25] Esau twins in the body of the Bride
[30:29] so you got some Wild Ones some make
[30:32] Believers amen hallelujah but there's a
[30:34] genuine
[30:36] believer amen there's a genuine believer
[30:38] there there's one whose real name is
[30:41] Israel and he takes the angel of God
[30:45] Amen the angel of God coming down to
[30:48] reveal his name that was written in the
[30:50] book amen yes and that can only come
[30:53] with the opening of the seals you see
[30:55] your name in the book amen amen praise
[30:58] the
[30:59] Lord amen so we see we are end time
[31:02] people who are to manifest the glory of
[31:04] God back on the earth and it is only you
[31:06] Esther who can go into the presence of
[31:09] the king and bring back the glory
[31:12] amen now when you are coming back out
[31:15] with the glory remember you are not only
[31:17] coming out with the glory but you are
[31:18] coming back with the
[31:20] power oh
[31:22] yes she gives the king gives
[31:26] Esther off the kingdom
[31:29] and you go watch there Esther goes to
[31:31] commanding things in the Kingdom she
[31:34] calls the king to a feast she calls Amen
[31:38] to a
[31:39] feast amen and under that Feast she is
[31:42] exposing his plans and schemes now she
[31:45] didn't get this Revelation on her own it
[31:48] came via the
[31:50] prophet so when she speaking these
[31:52] things it sounds like she is saying it
[31:55] oh yes because she is the final voice
[31:58] amen oh yes but only a few people know
[32:02] the source of where it came
[32:04] from amen amen praise the Lord prise the
[32:08] Lord so you got to know how to present
[32:10] the gospel
[32:12] too now is your time amen now is your
[32:16] season amen now is your
[32:18] ministry rise up to it amen
[32:22] prophesy amen hallelujah now is your
[32:25] time to display the glory of God now is
[32:27] the time for you to be on display amen
[32:30] now is not the time amen for us to be
[32:31] focused on material things amen my soul
[32:34] is not satisfied with material things of
[32:37] the earth amen yes amen my soul is
[32:40] satisfied with things of above for the
[32:43] kingdom of God and his righteousness
[32:46] amen my soul is centered around amen the
[32:49] things of God hallelujah amen praise the
[32:52] Lord so we have to come to build the
[32:54] kingdom of God back on the earth amen
[32:56] how by living righteous iously amen
[32:59] individuals being built into the Power
[33:01] House of the most high God you'll find
[33:03] the prophet says I've come to build
[33:06] powerhouses Tabernacles The Dwelling
[33:08] Place of the most high God am
[33:11] amen what are you doing you are bringing
[33:15] righteousness peace and joy to the
[33:19] Earth amen amen you're a big bundle of
[33:24] joy believe it amen
[33:28] brother Joshua tell them what
[33:29] righteousness peace and joy is what does
[33:32] the Bible say it's the kingdom of
[33:37] God
[33:38] Amen so to bring the kingdom of God on
[33:41] the earth you are bringing righteousness
[33:43] to the Earth you are bring peace to the
[33:47] Earth and you are bringing Joy to the
[33:50] Earth amen
[33:52] hallelujah because you are the only one
[33:55] who is saying
[33:56] Lord let your kingdom come let your will
[33:59] be done you find you going to most
[34:01] churches today they'll only speak about
[34:03] finances they'll speak about money
[34:06] they'll speak about how you must sww
[34:07] into the church how you must
[34:10] give amen they sent to the gospel around
[34:14] Financial blessings when the kingdom of
[34:17] God has come to give you more than just
[34:19] Financial blessings it's come to restore
[34:21] you back to your true identity in
[34:25] Christ amen hallelujah UAH you are the
[34:29] feminine part like Eve was taken from
[34:32] the side of Adam you were taken from the
[34:35] side of
[34:36] Christ amen and he can't reject you in
[34:39] this hour that is
[34:42] why
[34:45] King hesus didn't reject Esther because
[34:49] that was bone of his bone flesh of his
[34:52] flesh she was him amen so he presented
[34:56] to her after the kingdom it presented to
[34:58] her the title deed now the prophet would
[35:01] would detail this you know when you're
[35:03] buying a car if you finance it if you
[35:05] look at the log book most of the time
[35:08] you won't even have the the NS the log
[35:10] book because if you finance it it goes
[35:13] to the bank the bank is the title
[35:17] holder you'll see there's two sections
[35:19] on that form it says title holder an
[35:23] owner
[35:25] right so the proper calls this the
[35:28] abstract title deed where it's traced
[35:31] all the way back to the beginning
[35:34] meaning that the bank doesn't have claim
[35:36] on it before
[35:37] you right only when you finish paying
[35:40] off your Finance when your term has come
[35:43] to an end do they release the log book
[35:46] to you the NS to you then you can go and
[35:50] re-register that thing in your name way
[35:53] it says title holder it has your name
[35:55] and owner it has your name that that's
[35:57] what Christ did
[36:00] amen amen amen prior to that the book of
[36:04] man's inheritance Authority on the earth
[36:07] had a title holder there that was not
[36:09] you you were just under the owner
[36:11] section amen but he says when it's
[36:13] traced all the way back to the beginning
[36:15] because of the blood of Christ amen it
[36:18] erases every
[36:21] past you see you can't sit in the church
[36:23] with condemnation there is now no
[36:25] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[36:27] Jesus
[36:28] walk after the spirit and not after the
[36:30] flesh amen hallelujah so we can't be
[36:33] living in fear and condemnation Jesus

[36:39] bleach you would call it he raised your
[36:41] past he raised your sin amen amen
[36:44] hallelujah and you are now legal owner
[36:47] of the vehicle you are now legal owner
[36:50] to the Earth because the abstract title
[36:52] deed has come back to you amen so I'm
[36:55] asking you how are you bringing back to
[36:57] glory to the Earth right now by living
[37:00] the word you're taking the word of God
[37:02] in your heart and you are believing the
[37:04] word amen you accepting the word and the
[37:08] supernatural of God is evident in your

[37:20] carnal life defeated life amen

[37:33] before you and overtake you thank you
[37:37] sickness was taken care of at the cross
[37:39] thank you Lord amen in fact it was taken
[37:41] care of before the cross because the
[37:43] Bible says by the stripes of Jesus you
[37:45] were healed
[37:48] amen amen hallelujah how many of you
[37:52] know no future illness on you can have
[37:54] an effect on you amen because the blood
[37:56] of Jesus has cleansed you the blood of
[37:59] Jesus has washed you from the curse amen
[38:02] amen some people still believe that the
[38:04] Genesis 3 curse is still over the
[38:07] people how can the Genesis 3 curse have
[38:10] preeminence over the blood of Jesus the
[38:13] blood of Jesus came to reverse the curse
[38:16] yes amen so there's nothing in that
[38:18] curse that can come and take control of
[38:21] your life because you are under the
[38:23] blood amen amen can I get a better amen
[38:25] than that amen amen Hallelujah so stop
[38:29] confessing oh because of the Fall

[38:36] like that hey because of what Adam and
[38:38] Eve did we suffering like
[38:40] this no what about what Jesus did amen
[38:44] say because of what Jesus did I'm living
[38:46] like this because Jesus shed his blood
[38:49] amen because Jesus gave his life for me
[38:51] I am fully restored as a son and
[38:53] daughter of God I don't have to live
[38:55] beneath my means amen Satan wants to
[38:57] keep you down in your
[38:59] Revelation and make you still believe
[39:01] that you under the curse you under that
[39:04] amen hallelujah you have eternal life
[39:06] within your soul we are seated together

[39:52] already descended with a shout amen so
[39:55] the Rapture is already in progress right
[39:57] the shout is a message going forth to
[40:00] prepare people for a Rapture yes now
[40:03] watch very prophetically in the Bible
[40:06] here catch this amen Esther is between
[40:10] two
[40:11] books Esther is talking about amen
[40:14] changing Queen Esther is talking about
[40:17] amen hallelujah saving the lives of
[40:19] people Esther is also talking about how
[40:22] the presence of the king he shut up from
[40:24] there but she alone can bring back the
[40:26] presence amen
[40:27] but it's found in between two books it's
[40:30] found between the book of Nehemiah and
[40:33] you know what happens in Nehemiah March
[40:36] 14th there's a decree given to go and
[40:38] rebuild the walls of Jerusalem yes amen
[40:42] why you go and read nemiah the glory is
[40:45] gone
[40:48] yes so there's a man sent nemiah
[40:51] sent to go and build the walls amen
[40:56] hallelujah but if you watch the book of
[40:58] Nehemiah how it is built it is not a
[41:00] oneman
[41:01] Ministry oh somebody get this it is not
[41:04] a one man Ministry the book of Nehemiah
[41:07] goes into detail and tells you how each
[41:10] family was working on a section of the
[41:12] wall oh somebody get this each family
[41:15] was in consecration working on their
[41:18] section of the wall getting themselves
[41:20] ready for the glory of God to come back
[41:22] to the
[41:24] church amen and next comes the Book of
[41:28] Esther and after the Book of Esther what
[41:31] do you think comes next The Book of Job
[41:33] who prophesies about the
[41:36] Resurrection talking about the Rapture
[41:38] and the resurrection amen amen though he
[41:40] slay me yet in my flesh I shall see my
[41:44] redeemer because I know my redeemer

[41:56] amen amen hallelujah we see the glory of
[41:59] God coming back the walls being rebuilt
[42:01] we see his glory coming back we see the
[42:03] mind of Christ coming into the church to
[42:05] know what he wants done with the word
[42:07] amen because a time and a season like
[42:09] this Eve is now in Satan's Eden and he
[42:12] is coming there amen hallelujah to try
[42:15] and tempt her he's coming in an hour of
[42:19] temptation but I want you to rest ass
[42:21] short eat the book eat the message of
[42:24] the hour it will dissolve all doubt and
[42:27] fears amen it will leave no room for the
[42:30] enemy to
[42:31] work amen you can say it is written it
[42:34] is written it is written when he comes
[42:37] to you and say did God say was the cloud
[42:40] there was this picture there you say it
[42:43] is written it is written amen I don't
[42:47] care what you say about this what your
[42:49] location and this death and the other it
[42:51] is written in Revelation 10 that the
[42:53] mighty Angel shall descend amen our
[42:57] backing is not you remember he says
[43:00] sence took the
[43:02] picture our scripture Our backing is

[43:35] coming amen we'll have a double portion
[43:39] anointing where they connect now it's
[43:42] very important you'll find Ministries
[43:44] I'm saying Ministries I'm talking about
[43:46] you attached to the Ministries as well
[43:48] no ministry will survive in this time
[43:50] and season if they are detached and not
[43:53] connected with the angel of God
[43:56] right yeah that is the key amen think of
[43:59] it now it's how the age
[44:02] started talking about the bride age it's
