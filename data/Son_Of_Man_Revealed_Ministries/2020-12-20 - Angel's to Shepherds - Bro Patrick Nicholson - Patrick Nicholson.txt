us so this morning we come out of the blood of our lord and favor jesus and christ conquer fear through love and we thank god for perfect love that came in this day hallelujah the capstone of love

fear cause i am a child of god [Music] amen amen god bless you greet you all in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ kind of unusual circumstances we just got a small team here just myself trying to operate this morning and we envisioned the service to be a bit different today we were going to have our church here in function but due to the outbreak of the virus we couldn't gather together we thought it would be safer to close the church amen but be happy to have with us amen my father-in-law my daddy mr pat nicholson that's here with us this morning and he was scheduled to preach with us and he willingly obliged amen we could have easily played a message but he says no you'll preach this morning to bless the saints so i know many of you are taken up with the virus or you have a family member close loved one that's taken up with a virus we just want to encourage you that god is not taken by any surprises you know we hear many times about it's maybe said in jest or a joke about people coming to the pearly gates of heaven and peter greeting them at the polling gates want you to know that any of the loved ones that have gone on heaven was not taken by surprise amen the virus did not take god by surprise neither did he take heaven by surprise amen the bible says to everything there's a season to everything there's a purpose amen there's a time under the sun amen a time to be born a time to die a time to love a time to rejoice so this morning amen even as we come into the house of the lord and you've gathered there with your families our prayer will be strengthened even as we sang that song i'm no longer a slave to fear amen the prophet of god told us that job's faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought him to it amen so what be encouraged this morning do not have any fear do not have any doubt amen because the blood of the lord jesus christ still avails us there is still power in the cleansing blood of our lord and savior jesus christ amen so you strengthen yourself this morning even as you hear the word of the lord being preached you strengthen yourself you draw upon the word of the lord and remember this is the time when faith matters when you're going through your worst trials this is the time for your test to see where your faith will be injured upon so even as we hand over the service now to pastor pat nicholson as he comes and shares the word of the lord with us we pray that you will be blessed this morning be encouraged amen and just rejoice with the word of god amen [Music] so so good morning friends and saints i reach in the lovely name of our lord and savior jesus christ it's a wonderful privilege to be back in phoenix durban and just to enjoy fellowship with family grandchildren my daughter and son grandson and it's just that we can't have enough fellowship with those that are sick and quarantined we think on those especially and i'd like to pray and ask the lord's blessing upon those that are sick as we will pray here this morning and trust that god will certainly bless you as we gather around the word of god so before anything else we'd like to just power heads and close our eyes and trust the lord to accompany us as we move along in the service of the lord as we are in service to him heavenly father we come before you in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ we are blessed to know that you are the same yesterday today and forever the unchanging god and we understand that there's nothing that we need but you are all our sufficiency we are all that we need of god so i thank you that we think and our precious pastor ronnie his precious wife we ask that your merciful hand will be upon them and that grace will abound to the extent that they will come out strong healed because it's a finished work of god and that's why i pray across the ether waves that you will bless everyone that are needy knowing your god that the doctors can't help the medical fraternity might be at what's end but we believe that you are the same jesus the same yesterday today and forever and we look to a finished work as moses raised up the brazen serpent in the wilderness we can look to calvary because you were lifted up lifted up on high between heavens and earth and now we can look and live we can look and be healed we can look and know that we will be saturated with those healing virtues of god and may we just touch you not by the hem of your garment but we will touch you father god by the feeling of our infirmities and know that when we touch you we are touched in a way that we can rejoice like a cough and just spring lord and jump and for joy and knowing that you've done the work in our lives we look we don't look at circumstances we don't look at what we feel but we look at the promised word of god and you cannot fail upon your word lord we come by faith and we come upon those virtues of your blood that was shed for us it's upon the doorpost of our heart it's upon the lintel of our heart it drops down lord to the dust that from which we are taken and in the name of jesus christ we pray we commit the pastor lord his wife under the blood we speak her god like the blood of abel and knowing lord that we have a finnish word right now we believe lord we don't look to what the enemy shows us we don't look to what the doctor shows us we look to calvary we look to the hill far away and know that you've done it lord we agree as touching knowing that we are more than two here this morning we are more than two on the ether waves we come against the power of the enemy and say satan release the children of god leave them in jesus name for the power of god to saturate their lives for the power of god to come in anoint him right now father in jesus name every household has the blood right now we know the enemy would like to say we don't have it but we have it by faith we have the blood by faith we have our healing by faith we know we are delivered in jesus name in jesus name in the name of the lord and savior he saved us from the power of the plague he saved israel in the time of egypt he saved us in this day by his own blood we thank you lord we praise you we give you glory and we know we are healed in jesus name in the name of jesus christ we thank you father may those virtues flow into every home right now we know it's a work that's already done accepted by faith right now and i believe it if you believe it you can have that what you desire in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen and the church says amen wherever you are hallelujah satan is defeated amen by the very mentioning of the name jesus christ so we don't have to backtrack we don't have to think on anything that we have lost but we know that greater is he that's within us than he that's within the world so i greet the pastor i agreed his precious wife that we could not meet physically but trust that god will certainly undergird our love and that he will carry us through these troublesome times and we believe that god is in control amen it seems like it's chaotic out there it seems like there's no remedy but god is in control if we can believe all things are possible to them that believe i'd like to invite your attention to the book of luke chapter 2 and also the book of saint john chapter 10 and i can read it we can just have the fan maybe just go past me maybe it's just blowing so luke chapter 2 we can read and it came to pass in those days that they went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david so he was to be taxed with mary's his past wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in spotlight clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round above them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people amen so unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in sweating clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising and saying glory to god in the highest amen and on earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us amen and they came with the with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the same which was told them concerning this child and saying john chapter 10 and verse 11 i would have liked to read but due to time constraints we just want to hit the high spots and trust the lord that he will be the officer speaker of his word as we read verse 11 says in john chapter 10 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd give thee's life for the sheep but he that is an heiling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not see at the wolf coming and leave with the sheep and fleet and the wolf catches catches them and scattereth the sheep the highland fleas because he is in hiring and any carrot and carrot not for the sheep i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so no i the father and i laid down my life for the sheep may god bless his precious word and we trust that god will certainly bless our title here this morning which is angels to shepherds amen amen so we understand what uh angel means an angel he is a messenger and you also get the heavenly angels so we believe that god created men formed them out of the dust of the earth and gave us seven stars amen we are so in a starry festive season and this is my christmas message to the church in phoenix and it's maybe not coincidental because we don't believe in coincidences we believe in that the righteous the footsteps of the writers are ordered of the lord and when i looked at my sermon while i was studying and this sermon i was going to preach in b tabernacle but could not for some rhyme or reason could not make it and so this is the first time that i'm preaching this sermon and being a christmas message i trust that god will certainly bless it to your heart and knowing that jesus is the good shepherd and i want to just read a few quotations and believe that we can start preaching this message now the book of james gives us a few tests what christians normally go through and he says james chapter one counted all joy my brothers when you meet trials of various kinds amen hallelujah for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness and let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete lacking in nothing hallelujah that's what god wants us to have abundance amen if any of you lack wisdom let him ask god amen hallelujah he gives generously to all without reproach and it will be given him but let him ask in faith donors thinking oh you know i'm asking but i might not receive it but if you ask in faith you will receive that what you asked for and don't doubt for the one who doubt is like a wave of the sea that is driven and touched by the wind so the wave comes in hallelujah but we find that when our faith is established we can really take god at his word now the book of james goes further for that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the lord because he's double-minded man unstable in all his ways let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation and the rich in his humiliation because like a flower of the grass he will pass away for the sun rises with its scorching heat and will is the grass its flowers fail and its beauty perishes so also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits blessed is the man who remains ted falls under proud amen that's the man that we want to speak about this morning amidst all the pandemic and the plague and the negativeness and also the positiveness amen be positive when you are positive hallelujah doesn't matter what happens you are a son of god hallelujah so now we find that when he has stood the test amen that's where we are we stand the test whether we live or die we stand the test say like a hound a man a roaring lion seeking who he can devour and this plane speaks about that lion it speaks about devouring it speaks about death it speaks about meaning it speaks about uh separation hallelujah we've never seen death personified like displayed where it separates husband and wife it separates fathers from their families it separates families from families churches from churches amen states from states worlds from worlds but god is ever present god in a time of trouble he's there when we need him at most hallelujah he is the god of abraham isaac and jacob and he's still the god of the now he's my god hallelujah he's the chief shepherd he's the good shepherd he is the great shepherd oh my and we are a sheep who follow wherever he leads there we have to follow even if it's through death hallelujah so blessed be the man who remains steadfast under trial for when he astute the test he will receive the crown of life which god promised to those who love him do you love the lord i love him with all my heart amen when i speak about his love i just cry and cry and cry because of his goodness towards us his goodness towards me oh then we find that each person should not say that i am being tempted by god for god cannot be tempted with evil amen and he himself tempts no one so don't think that god is tempting us with a plague god is not tempting you all you have to do is believe that he is greater in you than he that's outside than he that's in the atmosphere than he that's on the walls hallelujah he's all that i need amen then each person is tilted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire hallelujah obey the law don't be enticed amen but remember there's one thing that you trust god above everything else amen when death stares in the face then we find that when when a person is tempted each person he's lured and enticed by his own desire then desire when it has conceived it gives birth to sin hallelujah so there is a sowing of the seed remember the battle ground is in the mind that's where fear starts and when fear starts it gives back to sin because conception happens in the mind that's where it does so may god help us to shrug off when the birds fly over the nest we don't let them come and nest we let them fly we shoot them like abraham showed the birds from the carcass as a sacrifice unto god hallelujah so be not deceived that when sin is fully grown it brings forth death that's what sin does amen so do not be deceived my beloved brothers every good gift and every perfect gift is from above amen amen many gifts have gone into this world but we are talking about the perfect kids i'd rather have love than every gift the prophet said amen i rather know you in the power of love and the power of a gift because your gift can take you to hell because you are not born again and there we find that he uh do not be deceived every good gift comes from above coming down from the father of lights we see many lights in this festive season amen but he is the father of light amen with whom there is no variance variation there there's no shadow due to change of his own world he brought us forth it's his will that we are here it's his will that we fight the good fight of faith don't draw back pick up your shield take up your sword fight the good fight of faith put on your singles amend the shard with the preparation you are prepared you are prepared oh yeah you're fighting the good fight of faith don't draw back the best form of defense is attack amen hallelujah come on and speak the word we've read the word we've heard the word it's now time for you to speak it upon your lips that the divine word of god there's divinity right now on your lips as you speak it amen speak not your own word but speak the word of god thus saith the word and that's why we find amen being the father of lights of his own world he brought us forth by the word of truth not a word of denominationalism not a word of doctrine or some kind of an issue that comes out of your mind but it's the issue that comes out of the mind of god and the mind of god is christ hallelujah and then we find that we cannot be a kind of a first fruit of his creatures hearing and doing the word isn't that wonderful that we cannot only hear the word of god but we can do the word because god is not interested in the hearers but more so the ink is interested in the doers of his word be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves for if anyone is a year of the word and not a doer he's like a man who looks intently at his interest or at his physique or at his doctrine or at his revelation and when he leaves that he forgets who he is and he loves the way he lives in the world he loves just the way he wants to because his doctrine doesn't match up with his life amen so when your doctrine matches up with your life that's why the prophet says i've got no doctrine but christ no book but the bible no law but love amen that's how a christian should behave so that doesn't mean worry wherever he is it means he will be a christian going and he'll be a christian he's a christian on the front he's a christian on the back he's the christian at the bottom he's a christian on top he's uh saturated with the word of god because he's loved god is love be doers of the word amen for we find that if anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but he sees his heart this person religion is vain it's like you don't have to do it in any case because you can't bridle your tongue james says so he deceives his heart this person's religion is worthless it means nothing religion that is pure and undefiled in their affliction they mentor it before the father is this to filtered orphans and widows in the affliction and keep yourself unstained amen from the world oh my my that is religion that is pure and undefiled before god so where does it leave this message amen this message brings us to be pure and undefiled amen in god's eyes and in the eyes of the world you are pure and undefiled that's why the devil hates you that's why he wants to take you that's why he wants to ridicule you he speaks bad about you but because of the glory of god that's over you that's why the devil hates you because he sees god's glory and we are god's glory amen amen we are that part born again by the spirit placed into the body of christ and that's why jesus could say very very i say unto you i am the dog of the sheep hallelujah amen oh my now we would think about the door of our current day but when the door is spoken up as a shepherd he leaves the door physically literally sleeping in front of the entrance to the sheepfold hallelujah i am the door and he says he is the good shepherd oh my that's why angels have to come down to come and tell the shepherds there's a baby the messiah christmas hallelujah happened on that night when jesus was born crying in a manger wrapping swaddling clouds there he was on the breast of mary oh hallelujah just think of that and joseph being a son of david watching over david was a shepherd boy hallelujah and the lineage comes out as a lamb of god a lamb that john said that takes away the sin of the world amen i'm not worthy to unleash this the latter of his shoes but he's the one that's coming after me hallelujah he's the one that's going to take away the sin of the world he's the lamb of god but when everyone looked they saw this lion that was heating out at the pharisees when they looked they saw this carpenter coming out of joseph's shop and said your generation of vipers flee for the wrath to come so they said hey uh herod is after you and he said because he was the second adam amen he said go tell that fox that i'm going to do things today and tomorrow i'll be perfect amen being the second adam he could name the animals hallelujah he called them snakes and sappins and foxes because he was the second adam before the rib came out of his side on calvary he had to name the animals he named the pharisees who they were they could not hide from the lamb of god because he was on the line of the tribe of judah amen he was not in that lineage because the bible said so to speak he was the son of joseph but he was not the son of joseph he was not the son of mary he was the son of god and that made him the god the name of the father son and holy ghost and the name of the father son and holy ghost is the lord jesus christ the greatest revelation that struck the earth when jesus came as the messiah after the angel spoke his name hallelujah call him jesus but when you look back in the prophecies his name shall be called counselor wonderful the prince of peace the mighty god the everlasting father hallelujah amen they were giving his name there were so many titles to that name that could not fall the bible from genesis to revelation if you follow his titles it will surpass the very book of revelations from genesis because he was everything he was all in all he's god amen he created all things jesus did hallelujah when he placed his foot on eternity or on the room of time and he looked out into eternity he said let there be who was that that was the son of god amen hallelujah nothing else but jesus christ oh yes that made himself known as the logos so now you can see this light traveling you could see it made visible it was that light that said let there be let us make man let there be a fish left to be a whale look to be a tiger let there be a donkey hallelujah and then when the angels came down to say he yeah hallelujah the shepherd said what and they realized now there to go find out what was happening with the salutation christmas has landed or we call it the mass of chris christ the mass of christ that's what the catholic that's why it's name cursed mass christ mass amen but we know that it's not a mass of christ but it's christ in you the hope of glory amen that's him coming down he just didn't want to be in a manger he wanted to be in the heart of these subjects in the heart of each and individual bride member so we find ourselves now as we read hey man let's look at these shepherds after having heard that the sun is wrapped in sweat clothes and laid in a manger because there was no room for him oh you get angry when there's no room for you amen but there was no room for the master of the world the master of the universe the master of creation the master of nature he had no room hallelujah so take it from him when you are cast out when you are rejected that's when the glory of god rests upon amen hallelujah receive rejection like he did he was not welcome amen but when we receive him into our hearts when he knocks we welcome him in and when we welcome him in we are welcoming in the baptism of the holy ghost which is jesus christ amen hallelujah he's not a lesser god or a force that that he that he is he's he's not just the father or the son and the holy ghost he's the lord jesus christ amen nothing less than that and the lord jesus christ is the one god who it was said in the commandments by moses you shall have no other god before me nothing not a man not an angel not a prophet nothing before me no other god but that would be an idol and we thank the lord that when those shepherds reach looking now it's only a shepherd that looks for a lamb amen when when it would have been a pharisee that the angels would have made the salutation no the sanitation was made to shepherds angels to shepherds and we find them in the church ages where angels became shepherds amen so it was angels to shepherds and in the church ages that was a bride to be brought forth out of this world out of the ages we find that those seven angels became shepherds and what is a shepherd he's a feeder he's a gatherer he gathers his sheep amen he lets him loose to feed but when it's gathering time he brings them together hallelujah amen in a time of trial the shepherd might not be there and it's hot out in the field they are feeding and when the sun starts to bake upon them they find that those sheep will come from all corners and huddle together as their fellowship one with another amen and that fellowship hey man they will dig their head when the one is uh hot he will dig his head under the other and he will cool down and when he's cooled down the other one will dig themselves and they will exchange their heads hallelujah and the who is just keeping the sun at bay on the backsides hallelujah so we find those sheep gather together they are cheap that needs a shepherd in a time of trouble but when the shepherd is not closed and the elements the trials come your way gather together amen amen be in one accord don't break up because that's what the whole is waiting for on the outside he's waiting for the breakup but come together in fellowship under the word of god under the great champion the good shepherd the chief shepherd if not the pastor it's jesus amongst us amen oh i love that and that's why we don't have to depend on man we depend on him hallelujah and that's why we love to look at man but once the man doesn't show you christ then there's a problem with that man he becomes a hireling and not a shepherd hallelujah because the shepherd goes to the door there where the door is that's where the shepherd goes and he protects the sheep because he's the good shepherd and the only way you can be a good shepherd as a pastor you need the holy ghost without the holy ghost you've got no right behind this pulpit to feed the lambs of god to feed the sheep of god to feed the older sheep there's sheep and the sheep and there's lambs and that's why jesus asked peter do you love me peter and he said feed my sheep you love me peter he said feed my sheep do you love me peter feed my land hallelujah because the older sheep and the young sheep and the lambs they're all there to be fit and that is why having the holy ghost is utterly important amen because you are speaking and feeding those that's got the holy ghost because the holy ghost feeds on the word feed on sheep food nothing less they will go and only feed on that what sustains them nothing less nothing more a sheep doesn't go to mcdonald's but she doesn't go to kfc they just go into the field and eat cheap food amen hallelujah and that's why if all of god's little sheep would just stand together we have the coolness of the shade of each other the comfort to lean upon each other now we need that hallelujah we need to pray for one another we need to ask god's mercy upon those that are struggling to breathe oh but let the breath of god pass over us right now we speak the word right now let the breath of god come and let there be nothing that is hindering your love in jesus name i speak the word so shall it be because i believe it you believe it and that settles right there amen it certainly is necessary there's nothing like having a real good dependable friend that when the troubles are blazing the hearts on you can you can go to this friend sat down explain to them talk it over in personal confidence and then kneel down and pray together and know that this person is a good god-saved man or woman that you can put confidence in oh there's so little confidence that we can put in there today when you tell them something in confidence the whole world knows about it shame on us that god will bring us back to be being confidently man confident that in time when we hear something bad that happened to you in your life oh you made a mistake or something happened you done wrong you stumbled and fall fallen and you went to a confidant and the confidant tells the old church that's a cancer in the church that god will eradicate and if he can't get it out of you that man will get you out of the church can somebody say amen out there hallelujah if we can't get the devil out of you he will get the devil out of the church because when the man fell over the prophet's feet and he said you will follow my feet and they ask him is the devil gone the prophet says no the devil is only subject to me because of the word of god but he said he worships that spirit so when he gets off my feet he'll still have the same spirit but he cannot come against the spirit behind here because it's god jesus christ against the devil and the devil is a loser in the sight of god in the presence of god if you can hold your ground the devil is a loser amen he's lost the battle he's lost the fight he's lost the war he's lost to you because you are more than conquerors in christ amen let's take god at his word and see the power come back oh yes let's reason together say the scripture you see sheep in a cold country they just love to warm up to each other and there's been nothing as cold as this blizzard blowing through the world called covet amen and that is why we need to be closer together than more than ever before oh yes when the church gets cold and indifferent god's sheep ought to be huddled up together amen and pray for each other and the warmth of the real good christian fellowship david spoke of it in islam blessed is the man that sets not in the seat of the scornful standing in the way of sinners but his delight is in the law of the lord and in the law that he meditate thy day and night and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the river of water and his leaves shall never wither whatsoever he does shall prosper amen god said it god said headed by the mouth of a shepherd hallelujah a singing shepherd oh yes just imagine amen this was in the media where the shepherd was standing and he had a challenge made to every visiting tourist to call the sheep that was out in the field feeling and everyone would take up the challenge and he would give him the sound that they are normally attracted to and the sound is the voice of the shepherd hallelujah so we realize that the shepherd's voice is all we listen to and what is a voice it's a thunder what is a thunder it's a voice and there we realize that everyone went onto the platform put their feet against the rail and they did speaking tongues hallelujah went something you couldn't understand what they were saying what the shepherd was kind of making an example of how the sheep would come but everyone tried the women tried the men tried the children tried but to no avail it was like the sheep were deaf and that's how a christian should be he should be dead to other every voice but he should listen to the master's voice oh my and there comes the shepherd he puts his foot on that rail and hundreds of sheep just grazing all over the field scattered but when the shepherd made his tongues the interpretation went through to the sheep hallelujah the denomination doesn't understand this they don't know what's happening behind this pulpit right now they don't understand what's the revelation of the thunders they don't understand what's the revelation of adoption they don't understand what's the revelation of the rapture they don't know what's happening they don't understand what the prophet got to do with us in this day the prophets are there in the old testament what's he doing in this day they don't understand and as the shepherd started calling with his voice it seemed like nothing was happening the sheep just went on grazing but he didn't stop calling and that's what god is that's why the shepherd is he doesn't stop calling it doesn't seem like you are getting it but listen the more we preach the more you are ready to hear the voice of god the thunder that's coming from the eat the winds through the clouds of witness the thunder will strike it's the voice of god amen and as the voice struck every ear of those sheep amen and we find that there's lambs also but it doesn't mean that you need to preach to the lamb it means just get the sheep to come the lamb will follow hallelujah the lambs will follow just live the right kind of a life in your homes in church in your cars do the right thing the lands will follow and that's the shepherd called out friends there was a stir oh yes there was a turnaround a repentance upon the gain experience they had a look around they knew something stop what you're doing stop your eating stop your peanuts stop doing what you are doing the shepherd's voice has uttered it it's calling out and each of them they were facing that way but malachi chapter 4 says but in the days of the voice amen of that elijah he shall turn the hearts of the children that's in denomination the children of denomination we were there we were the that eagle that was waiting for the voice of mama eagle we were in that denominational as children we were methodists children we were baptist children but then they came advice of the shepherd a voice that said turn around back to the apostolic fathers not nice you're wrong not 83 25 when they said father son holy ghost no but before that when absolutely it was in action when acts 19 and verse 5 was in action and he received the holy ghost since you believed they said we don't believe that there's any holy ghost we don't know about the holy ghost but we are preaching christ he said if you haven't received the holy ghost how are you baptized he said well we are baptized unto john he said that was fine but it won't work now you have to be baptized over again in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins for the holy ghost to come upon you amen and when they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they received the holy ghost when paul laid his hands upon them and that is apostolic doctrine we still lay hands on those that need the holy ghost but we as gentiles we don't even need to be laid hands on because we believe it cornelius didn't have to have hands laid upon him oh my he had a vision if you have a vision call peter call the prophet call the message to attention and say i've heard the voice of god by a vision called peter and as speaker yet speak these words even lay hands upon him he was astonished when the holy ghost fell on those gentiles and he said what what's happening here they received the same holy ghost like we did being gentiles what's happening here but jesus gave peter a vision and said don't call that unclean what i've made clean what is cleaned by the blood is clean what is clean by the message of the hour you don't have to worry about doctrines and teachings and things all you have to do is listen to the voice of god and you know that you're coming through amen i'm so happy and i believe that it was angels that came to the shepherds it's written but what about our age from paul which is the bright age from paul to william branham and the prophet says that i came at the end this messenger comes at the end of the laodicean church age but now the question is has it ended the prophet says no while we are here that edge hasn't ended but there's a new age in this age which is the capstone age where every believer receives the capstone which is the holy ghost and when we receive the holy ghost in this age we call for the headstone and it's the headstone that takes up everything hallelujah it takes paul irenas martin combo all those shepherds who are angels are our corners are drawn up like a wee plant when the weed plant is sown the seed dies it rots and the life travels and as the life travels it dries in the first age it dries in the second age but the life has left it as the light bleeds it dries it dries and when it gets to the top it becomes seed again but in a multiple form it see the game the first seed that fell into the ground which was christ was what paul sowed back into the ground by a revelation of who this is who what our lord he said i am christ i'm jesus i'm jesus he said wow i thought you were elohim i called you lord but i recognize that now you're introducing yourself as jesus the everlasting father yes he's not the eternal son of god he is the son of god amen because the prophet says there's no such a thing as the eternal son of god that was made up amen it was made up in demon nationalism there's only one the son of god and that's jesus who is god and that's why you could say i am now paul i am now back as the everlasting son as isaiah said i will be the everlasting father amen the son that you hear me say why are you persecuting me saul said i am jesus who you are persecuting and saul being a pharisee being a binge of mine circumcised the eighth day went through the law know the law he said it's time for me like to sheep to stop grazing in a pharisee uh grazing ground but it's time for me to turn around and go towards the master's voice then that angel became a shepherd paul became a shepherd to the gentiles and then at the end we find another shepherd approaches amen because he had to come to the land that was opening the book the book was now being opened amen it was the son of man which was jesus revealing himself through a son of man hallelujah which was william branham and that prophet comes at the end of the laodicean church when everything has been broken down by the very people that acted like the pentecostals dead but did they have it no they did not amen but there was individuals that had it in the days of paul we are trying to say paul only had faith but if paul didn't have the holy ghost he's not in the bride so if paul had the holy ghost he had to have second peter one without these things you are blind and you can't see a far off but paul saw right into laodicea hallelujah and there we find ourselves that angels on our shepherds angels to shepherds to show a land to go look for a lamb to worship the land now its angels becoming shepherds to bring forth a bride to jesus christ we are not just a bride but without us they cannot be made further they cannot be complete without us amen because remember perfection comes by the blood sunlit perfection comes by the blood but it takes a get together according together seven thunders gathers the bride who's that it's the voice of god what is the voice of god so when the thunder strikes obviously the father of lights made a strike that took it from paul right up to william branham and william brown says you know there must be one prophet in the beginning and there's a prophet at the end he's alpha and his omega the carriers are in between so when the omega comes he says i say what paul said hallelujah so we can't go back to any other voice but the voice of the good shepherd amen the wise of the great shepherd the wife hallelujah of the chief shepherd so now we realize that another age is really coming and that's where these brothers are picking on they are trying to make another angel in the eighth hallelujah but it's christ back again to the beginning back to what he was back to capping believers believers by the holy ghost because remember once you start mixing up the church ages with the individual you'll be lost in the pyramid you'll be a you'll be a mummy in the pyramid you die or you are dead going in the permanent there's a lot of traps in the program hey man there's a lot of booby traps in the permit so when you're going there you must know who you are from faith to the holy ghost amen now my time is running out and i'm going to just try to go another five minutes and then trust that the lord will bless us and they're not closed so there we realize that when we look at in the orient how they take care of the sheep the shepherd brings them in at night and he counts them everyone to see if everyone is in is it nighttime yes is everyone in i want to say lord i'm in so if they are still coming may god have mercy on them remember the last one is not the one that's baptizing water the last one is the one baptized by the holy ghost amen so the one can still be sitting around baptizing water but never went on to receive the holy spirit we are waiting for you and you and you may god have mercy on us that we hear the voice of the shepherd and then we become that ship we become the chief we become that shepherd after we become that sheep amen we can go out like the shepherd and tell everybody that the messiah is born the lamb of god is born come see hallelujah shepherds became messengers they were angels angels spoke to shepherds shepherds became angels and right through the church ages from paul angels that was in the right hand of jesus became shepherds and they and no wonder seven voices seven thunders gathers the bride amen paul gathered his group arenas gathered his group and everyone after him martin colombo gathered this group william branham is gathering his group and i believe that we are right there at the end to wait for the coming of the lord jesus christ so the dead in christ will rise first and we which are alive shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen and we when we see that uh that went on when we see them it will send such a shaking in our bodies that it will be changed in an instant and we will meet him together in the air i trust that you are happy and i believe that as those sheep finds if there's one missing he will not lay down until he goes out into the deserts that's where the church is right now we have to go out into the deserts or wherever he is heard it all day long and he will find that sheep lay it over his shoulder bring it in then when all is in the fold then the shepherd lays himself down at the gap he's the door to the sheepfold there's no other way it's a coral you've got over the top over it and nothing can come into those sheep until he crosses the shepherd so he as the prophet says it's a dog it's a coral so as he goes over this coral he has to climb over jump down and get and get to the ship and anything that comes has to come from the top but he's laying there waiting for everything to come through that gap because he becomes the door amen there we find no matter what it is it will have to come by the shepherd matter is not what it is it will have to come via the word if you say you have the thunders it must come via the word and the only way that you can have what the sun is uttered is when you consult the prophet because there's no other way of getting around the word that's not written but via a prophet so when it's not written consult a prophet when it's written consult the word hallelujah consult the word when it's not uh when it's a when it's written but when it's not written you have to consult the prophet because he reads between the lines and he said it must be it must be measured with the word to say if you have the thunder it must be measured in the word because it's not written amen and then he said he's going to do two things he's going to reveal the thunders and he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers so may god bless you and may the good shepherd shepherd you may gather you so that we can be in one accord may gather you so that you can be healed may we pray for one another that covert will be defeated in the name of jesus christ stay safe and believe all you need to do is have faith in god and the rest is settled god bless you let's pray heavenly father we come before you in the name of jesus christ we commit every soul into your hands we pray now oh father that you will come as the good shepherd and take the sheep and gather them together by your voice we don't hear no other voice we don't hear another voice but the word of god every prophet has to come by the word for us to listen to his voice because then he will be speaking the oracles of the living god straight out of the written word lord we know there's nothing more powerful than the written word and that is why we come anointed by the written word and we take god right at his word take it like an ease and that settles it we also thank you for a prophet that you send our way we thank you for william branham that came lord that you sent and revealed the seals revealed the thunders that was contained in the seals and even not even written in the word of god but it had to come by a prophet the omega prophet that said what paul said the alpha prophet and we thank you today father may you bless the pastor the shepherd of this church may you bless the chorus leaders may you bless the congregation
