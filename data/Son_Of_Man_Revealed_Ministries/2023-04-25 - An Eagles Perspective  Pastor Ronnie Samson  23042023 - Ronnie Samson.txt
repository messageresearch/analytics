same time it's not easy amen all right some people might think it's easy it's never easy to be a pastor yes it's a very very difficult Road and here's a church you must hold his hands okay lift him up to the Lord remember he's a human being just like you amen there's nothing different about ministers all right so we're just like you we got our difficulties and our trials and everything we go through because we're human beings just like you amen you to support our brother may the Lord which you bless him as he continues all the thought to to pass to the church okay so we find it's actually according to scriptures you know that Generations in the family takes takes on you know the position as creatures of the Gospel so it's everything is in order it's according to the word of the Lord so God with you bless you this morning we want to speak a few things and look accessible what we say this morning that the Lord will help us amen so remember now why you come here you don't come to see one another amen amen okay you come here just one purpose and you come to Worship the Lord amen you come to listen to his word and you come to choose yes okay so we don't want to listen to all the preaching and not change that's the problem amen you could go to change and whatever we listen to we try to live it we'll have our struggles here and there like they say we might lose a battle here and there but we we win the war amen that's the important thing okay so God bless you we thank God for the message amen yes you know the revelation of his word and remember you can thank God because the fact that you can come here to a message church that you know God has chosen you yeah amen hallelujah because remember he bypasses millions of people but he chose you amen thank you and so appreciate him for that yeah so many people don't see what you believe they might not ever see it yes okay but you can thank God because you know the word of God is promised he said I'll give you higher self that you will see amen so we can be very very grateful to God so I was raised up in the uh Methodist Church then we got into the Pentecostal people a little more as you know we we grew more but you see God has a birthplace for everybody amen yes and then we find yeah you know those days gone by because Pastor Dan it was uh late Pastor Christie Roberts and you know like one of them and then we begin to see this message and of course we had uh challenges from our families and so forth but we pressed on Amen so that's important thing we don't buckle down to anything amen No Matter What opposition comes out with yes they can mock you they can do all sorts of things but we know in our heart God has revealed this message we're very very grateful for the Lord for that right he's got some notes one John 2 15 to 17. first John chapter 2 and 15 to 17. love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him I want you to know this is very straightforward right yeah for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but of the world now verse 17 and this is important and the world passeth away and the last thereof but either do it the will of God abides forever all right one John 5. and verse 19. and we know that we are of God and the whole world lies in which the spirit father we indeed grateful to you this morning Lord It's a privilege to be in the presence of the Lord amen to be here with your dear people yes we're grateful oh God for the singing we're grateful for the worship and and Lord once again we pray we realize it's uh it's now the time that you must speak to us amen yes Lord so I am the Lord submit ourselves to you we pray that you will give us spiritual understanding divine revelation yes we pray the spirit of God will come and make things clear in our hearts and our lives father we will open Lord to you this morning amen whatever you want to tell us it is we pray that the spirit of God will help us once again bless all your pastor Adrian oh God together with his family amen and sister Grace oh God together with the rest of the family and even Sean's wife Lord the family we come with all of them to you now and the rest of your children we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you looking at yeah we we're looking John this great Apostle yes okay so I think we're quite familiar with this gospels when we look at we look at Matthew Mark Luke and John okay if you show the old Believers you know the message so brother Brian taught us and he showed us you know the lion the ox the man and the eagle amen yes okay under those four uh the schools that was written and it depicts that right and we know it's showing the Lord Jesus Christ but the thing that we want to look at this morning in particular remember John typifies the eagle amen hallelujah all right so this morning we're going to look to look at things by the ego perspective yes all right the ego perspective remember Lord told to John he says come up higher yes okay so we find now we are moving in the cycle of Revelation yes divine revelation okay and you'll find we're able to see things that we didn't see before yes amen the reason being that remember the promise was that he would give us I sell that we might see we can see those wonderful things while it's hidden to other people [Music] so that makes you special as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen that is why brother Brian told us you know this message now look the the fivefold ministry is very very important yes amen okay you know we can play the tits so we have to play the tapes that is good enough but that is not sufficient yeah I'll tell you why brother made a statement you said the faithful ministry will make more sense to what I'm saying amen is so brother probably the word in the seed form amen amen hallelujah okay we we're blessed with the convention yeah the Easter conventional you saw the word has been unfolded all right the word is placed there but it takes the faithful Ministry to take these things and to break it down and to bring it to the people and we have all the Ministries call some prophets pastors teachers evangelism faithfulness right so let's look at some of these things so what is the difference so when you look at the other gospels let's look at Matthew Mark and Luke will notice the Bible is written in Parables yeah all right you know the different Parables we're going to go through it many parables one thing that is very very outstanding in the Book of John there's no problem yeah John doesn't write parables amen hallelujah why John sees things from an eagle perspective amen okay John tells you the real story as it is amen amen there is no types and shadows in the Book of John that's wonderful because God is doing something amen God is showing you that you must go higher yeah right so what does John do John breaks into the mysteries of God amen amen which means that this book which always talk about Revelation but now I'm talking about John yes and John also wrote Revelation amen all right so when John writes this book we find this this book was not even open to the public it's not opened up another box so when you go look at similarities now watch the hidden things right so you will notice in the Book of John if you really look at it we've got no time to go through all that the scriptures as such we will find the Declaration I am up here seven times [Music] there's a seven I am declaration amen all right so you go look at it and you'll find to break it down Jesus said I am the bread of life I am I am the light of the world I am the door to the Sheep okay I am the Good Shepherd amen I am the resurrection and the life I am the way the truth and the life amen seven Declarations of I am and then we find out go the Book of Revelation 7 7 7. seven land stands seven churches seven schools before control yes seven Thunders Seven Seals amen seven seven seven seven it's the same writer amen amen okay then we find out that each gospel writer complemented the other yeah okay Matthew Mark Luke and John as I said Each one showing the lion then we have the ox the man and the eagle you know through that we see the church ages all these things under that anointing amen okay so if there was an ox anointing so the people could give their lives over yes okay so there's an eagle anointing in our time amen right so that's very very important right right now to the Book of Matthew uh Matthew starts the genealogy as presents Christ the King okay so you'll find Matthew's genealogy is presenting the Christ the Christ the King we know is the king yes the lion he is the line of the tribe of Judah amen amen all right so watch these things you're not breaking it further as I said it will take too much of time as you know Here Comes This genealogy and he presents Christ the King what does he say he says Jesus Christ the son of David why amen watch the kingly like and the kingly expression all right because David was the first king and then what does he do he leaves out all the others and he comes to Abraham amen all right he comes to Abraham the leaves of the others why because Abraham met King melchized amen right then we find out that Mark is the uh the ox which presents Christ as a servant yes that's what Mark does right he's visiting Christ as a servant now if you watch something when you employ a servant right you don't worry about his genealogy really yeah all right and then of course you don't employ infants all right so what Mark does when Mark starts the gospel he starts with Christ at 50. 30 years of age yeah nothing about infancy all right and then you will you will find and he tells us how Christ was baptized by John and so forth so Mark doesn't present a genealism right Luke is the man and the Man Comes the third anointing now watch this right Luke starts the genealogy backwards Luke's has a genealogy backwards right and he starts with Jesus Christ and he goes all the way back to Adam the man [Music] what does he do he's giving the man's view of Christ so that's why Luke's gospel is so full with Parables giving the man's heal yeah yeah okay but now we find okay we know Prophets uh prophets are eagles amen you know right yes it was Ezekiel Ezekiel Saw our modern highways and you saw the lights of vehicles flashing yes all right he was caught up in this time but he was a prophet way back thousands of years because God's word is always true and unfailing hallelujah amen all right so you saw all these things why he said Eagle amen amen God that glimp so God showed him and so if I John shows now the eagle John shows no earthly genealogy right he shows nothing on the Earthly line isn't this wonderful amen he shows nothing on the airplane what does he do he he starts off in the beginning was the word amen hallelujah is going to Eternity yes he's the eagle in the beginning was the word we find that this is a prophetic View this is the Eagle's View of Jesus Christ all right we've seen him in all other forms throughout the ages where John comes back here and tells us how it began yes amen and he takes Jesus right to the logos all right when God gave birth to himself yes that's what the prophet taught us God giving birth to himself right so yeah and then we find it shows us how creation began see John is dealing with mysterious things so Jonah is able to bring these things to the bride the bride can catch the true Revelation all right and know who God is know who you are know where you come from know what you're doing here all right I know where you're going to those are the wonderful things that you know Israel known when we find creation began it's only go back we find through the beginning of the creation of God the promise of God is very clear in John's gospel without the use of parables so John doesn't use Parables but it shows us the promise of God is the promises are very very clear right here you find now the gospel is entirely to the believer always say to the bride in our terms yes right the gospels now to them right you know we add uh Parables you know uh 10 virgins all that uh you know the household The Vineyards all these kind of a thing each one of us to revealing Christ all right but you say John doesn't speak like that but what did John tell us you find this year in John 14. all right what is writing Jesus said so watch Journal is coming very straight to the point no Shadows no Parables but what he says in John 14 in My Father's House now he's coming Street and direct to the truth yeah because he has an eagle's perspective in my father's house are many mansions right not spoken of in the other Gospels right he was giving the prophetic View and showing the positioning of a Believer yes okay you find out in John 15 Jesus said to the disciples I no more call you servants I no more call you servants but I call you friends amen hallelujah okay but in John 13 we find Jesus in an indirect way called themselves all right and the Lord's supper and food washing Jesus said you call me master and Lord for so I am right Jesus said use you speak right right you'll notice that Judas was there after chapter 13 Jesus Judas goes out of the scene all right and you'll find his only seed at the Betrayal okay see how beautifully the scriptures are put together okay Jesus was uh revealing his intimacy yes amen false church is not there yes he's revealing it to the bride okay so you you find here right uh so Jesus was the living is in intimacy to his disciples John 17 is a prayer of Jesus for his disciples for us you don't find that in the other gospels all right so what he's saying is you know watch that intimacy by the writer John and revealing to you and I these things by uh by the perspective of an eagle all right he's watching all these things okay okay right so yeah this is to be one of two things yeah so Jesus prayed for us how can that prayer become void Jesus is praying for his bride can that prayer become void so we've got to really believe it believe that Jesus prayed for you all right and here we find so Jesus prayed a personal prayer for us in John 17 then he he spoke of the mystery of him and the bride you'll notice this Misty uh intertwined in the Book of John about the bride I in me and you and me and we are We Are One all that kind of things is the Mysteries that Jesus was speaking were all written in the Book of John okay why you said uh they are in me that they might be made perfect in one it's a mystery right so all these things was declaring okay you'll find in the Gospel of John the other gospels out of Christ's birth and at 33 years John's gospel went beyond that amen yes all right John showed the beginning of the creation of God in the beginning was the word John broke into the Realms of Eternity amen declaring the logos and the future all right so again we're saying John did not use parables in uh in Jesus's coming like he was in the days of no other gospel said that like it was in the days of Noah so shall it be of lot and all that John straight away come and said look he says the finishing point is all the supremas were to the father's house in My Father's House on many mentions he leaves all the other things right then he says I will come again and receive you the intimacy again to his bride I will come and receive you unto myself all right it was plain John gave us a prophetic view very plain so John did not go to times and shadows now he's speaking directly to the believer both the Book of John and the Book of Revelation is the full revelation of Jesus Christ amen okay so we find out so we said in John 10 he says I am the door and in Revelation 4 4 4 you is the aura saw a door opened in heaven amen okay so what does brother bring Jesus about this doll it's a Dolph Revolution yeah right and he comes and says right to ever now Jesus on Earth he said I'm the dog Zone comes up he sees these things he says I see a door opened what's the evil all right that's open in heaven John was in a Heavenly dimension not only for the Book of Revelation but to write the Gospel as we read we are transported into the Heavenly Dimensions ourselves remember you know Jesus is the right dude we are the Beloved bride where Jesus is that's where we will be amen we cannot be separated from here amen all right we won okay Prophet showed us in many many uh uh cases all right but so we move into that heavenly Dimension ourselves all right and then we see we look into these things and see the glory of God we see how God opened up these things now we don't see through a glass Darkly we are seeing face to face right so now remember now well as I said you know the church we're moving in Revelation okay that's actually going to come a time when it's going to reach that Climax and you'll find there will be that bodily change so The Church Must position itself to receive from this revolution okay so now let's get through a few things right so we're coming back to one uh John chapter 5 and we read verse 19. okay so there you told us okay he says we know that whosoever is born of God sin it not but he that is begotten of God hebrewed himself and that Wicked one toucheth him not all right now you know something we must not give place to the devil all right in whatever we do remember you are overcome amen all right and you'll always you you know we always got Victory amen okay look we have our struggles we will not immune to certain things and this life we have our sicknesses and problems whatever okay but that don't change God one bit of who it is so so now let's watch this so we find out you know you'll notice according to John's writings there's only two groups of people he identifies in this world two groups of people all right two groups of people that exist in this world only two types of people according to John and his children of God and Children Of Satan amen because he would never be down all right leave all this Earthly uh religions and this one world things and one God region all these kind of things is not according to the world right so John is saying look there's two classes of people you're either you're a Believer or you're an unbeliever all right children of God and children of Satan so one belongs either to God or to the evil world are you coming to something the evil World system that is Satan's domain all right don't forget we are in Satan's Eden okay in Satan's Eden and so you know you know why is John placing so much emphasis this is not Elemental stuff why is the ego okay the Eagle's View placing so much of emphasis on the world system all right and God or the devil's children and God's children why is he placing an emphasis and telling us look this world he says it will pass away and the lust thereof amen okay remember now if if you are walking with God you qualify for eternity for heaven okay and so we find so John is saying look there's only two of them now and you're fine because the old world the whole world belongs to Satan Christians should avoid its contamination amen yes I don't get contaminated with the world now sometimes don't think you'll say you know what I'm strong and I can just overcome you'll be surprised the devil will take you with a back end you wouldn't know what happened never never underestimate the devil you're not we're not giving him glory but he's your number one enemy you do everything to bring you down or as you've got to avoid its contamination second Corinthians 4 4 the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not so it's quite busy so if you want to turn back and resist God if you want to resist the ministry if you want to resist what the Holy Ghost is telling you the devil will further blind you amen so you don't receive truth and he's doing it yes yeah that's right okay and definitely we can't be comfortable with that something is wrong if we are comfortable with that so is blinded Satan blinds men to God's truth through the world system he has created will system that Satan has created without a Godly influence man left to himself will follow that system right so the Godly influence is so very important so don't you know you've got to raise your children according to the laws of God Amen and if your child is doing something wrong don't say they they say these days he's comfortable with that that is nonsense you've got to stand with the word of God okay you can be comfortable with nothing outside the word of the Lord okay and you find it will be that same fellow that lovely beautiful child will turn out to be a renegade in the end right why because he was schooled under that so-called evil system okay and we let our children go like that and you'll find they'll be gone already you know they're waiting for the schools and every places Society okay they want to bring them down or make them part of them okay now every watch James the brother of John adulthoods and adulteresses okay now sometimes we say we think of the natural act but it's a metaphorical description of spiritual unfaithfulness all right so spiritual and faithfulness as much as the natural Act is also wrong we find that James as in view professing Christians outwardly associated with the church but holding a deep affection for the evil World System so how many today the same message and message and messenger but have you got that affection for the world you've got that desire in you for the world you're dressed a certain way when you come to church and when you go to work you just a certain way you put your dress in the church when you go to work you put your pants on these things are true I'm not saying you're doing it we're fooling ourselves right doing these things and holding a deep affection for the world you know something that is what I'm saying is so serious we've got an eagle's perspective John it's time to tell us look if you do these things he won't even enter into the glory land we should join us very very straight that is why you also find James a very straight writer we're not seeing the others are not straight but replacing their emphasis for a special reason amen amen okay so we don't be just you know saving Christian friendship with the world all right it's too often as thus you know why you know let's face it or we we're ashamed you know like they will laugh at us the way we dress like the ground says you say you're putting a flat tire and then all those things about your air and so forth because there was something you're gonna please them they'll go to hell you need to please them yes men friendship of the world all right we're saying we're looking at the ego's perspective well I said again this is not Elementary otherwise John wouldn't be writing this as the eagle right so the the Greek word describes love in the sense of a strong emotional attachment right those who did and intimate longing for the things of the world give evidence that they are not redeemed hmm right it's strong but it's true why it's energy with God The Sovereign thought that unbelievers are God's enemies is taught throughout this country and we're going to go back to see what the scriptures are teaching us all right okay and that is why Romans 8 7 tells us the carnal mind is enmity against God that is why it calls for a discipline of our minds how we think what we speak all these things are very very important because a carnal mind is enmity against God you want to be an enemy with God I mean who's going to win with you an enemy with God okay your battle is done finished so John is saying again the whole world lieth in wickedness the evil World System under Satan's control message like Satan's Eden all these things to tell us these things okay so the world and we're looking at the world and yeah we read 1 John 2 15 17 we find this is not a reference to the physical material world but the invisible spiritual system of evil dominated by Satan so you think you're looking at physical world normal okay we find you saying it's an invisible spiritual system you say is Satan fighting you you can't see him it's invisible but the war is going on yes yes you see many times lots of us we even forget we you know battle right so so what is telling us again very straightforward very cutting John was leaving nothing behind all that is in the world the lust all right what is last a strong desire for evil things you really speaking if we are under that situation and we are under bondage all right and that must be broken amen all right so you think what the church needs no not more lectures I'm not even more preaching but we need the person of the obligation Amen to come into our that changes us yes like somebody said you know we always want to look on the outside you know we tell our children don't do this don't do this don't do that don't do this and they wonder what you're talking a lot but let them receive the whole egos then the outside will be taken care of Amen all right all that's in the world is loss of the flesh right refers to the sin nature of man okay again who's the trouble causer Satan uses the evil system will system to incite the flesh okay then we have the lust of the eyes and we find that Satan uses this Avenue to incite wrong desires okay and all these things and then we'll say we have the parade of life pride of life you know they say like the peacocks you know so proud but he's living in a fallen world yeah that's where we are and then we find pride of life arrogance over one circumstances the slaves of so-called Christians today yeah okay verse 17 has told us but the good news for us John is telling us the world is passing so everything that we think we've got permanence here is passing away yes amen okay you know one time uh you know Prophet was speaking to somebody and you know he had that 1940 something uh the Ford you know is Mojo Khan he says you know I done everything to take care of that car and he will polish it and every other thing will look so good and you turn back around I don't know whatever year it was maybe around the 60s and he says you know something desire to go and look for my thought I would not find one piece who's happened that's why it's time to tell us look whatever we do if there's no endurance we are wasting our time because I can't find a piece of it but I worked for it I spent my mind I did every other thing but where is it today he said where do you please value them yes are we interested in ourselves okay and yet you find and we can have all the things we got our work and every other thing but that is not your God that is just you have to sustain you in this life amen but the world systems the evils everything will pass away okay so you find okay we you know we actually labor for things that will not perish okay so if I all these things he says is going to go why Christians must not love this evil World system because of its temporary age right I don't love it it will serve its purpose because it's only temporary right Daniel's prayer was with the hell for 21 days imagine this great prophet so who are we in the side of Daniel we're not doing comparison as such but what I'm saying is the warfare that's going on Daniel okay due to an evil angel opposing Gabriel in Heavenly welfare tells us that Satan engages in Heavenly Warfare to influence generations and generations against God and his people it was quite busy you can't put all over Satan's eye right so yeah we're fine so we're speaking now this you know looking at this on my ego's perspective we find that salvation is transformed right and you find transformation is the new birth produces a new life you see I'm born again with the life amen okay you can say I'm born again you look yes with wisdom life amen amen all right he produces New Life in which the power of sin has been broken okay so I want you to watch and you watch you know you and I in this fight we're battling it out but remember we're on the victory side amen don't don't you know just give in to what Satan is trying to tell you so just look at this a little bit now how do we know we're going to teach a message on the unwelcomed Christ so you know actually that's what we say sometimes if we don't know the dress right the same Christ you're not welcome we don't want to talk right you're not welcome yes yes okay but imagine when we do these things as Christ is sitting there what's he gonna do how you will speak so Jesus was invited by Simon the Pharisee and then watch this Prophet attitude tells us to make fun of him hmm inviting Jesus because remember the Pharisees they didn't want anything to do Jesus they always criticize him and they mocked him under every other thing to him and so we find out this is what happens when we find out you know you find every time when Satan thinks he's doing something that he can turn the church down whether somebody there to stand out as a testimony because the infamous woman yes with the alabaster box of oil but nothing is perfume so how did he what happened perfume smell is influencing and penetrating so when she did this an old house she washed his feet and all these things and she she done service to him okay there's always somebody that will show you what truth is no matter how much the Devil comes to 12. it was a cloud around things and what did she do while the others mob Jesus the ill-fame woman done a great honor it is amen amen okay what are you doing to honor him this morning but you watch this very carefully we know the Pharisees hated Jesus then he shows us in the types and shadows you know Joseph and his brother and all these kind of the things right hated Jesus but invited him look at that what an audacity hate him but he invited him okay we hate you but will Pharisee means an actor so Prophet daughters right he's an actor so he said you know what we're hating but just act this out they're like we love him we'll call him but what does the prophet tell us he says you know there's something wrong with the story it's something is wrong with this story okay what did the Pharisee have in common with Jesus let's see the way you calling Jesus right that's where you find people actually supposed to have things in common then you'll find and congregate together yes amen why is you coming here this morning if we love the Lord amen I told you not come to see so and so now I was dressed with what or whatever you come here to meet the Lord amen okay that's our purpose we love the Lord so we go to church we have a common ground right now it's like this you know you know like you'll find little children have things in common you'll find a seven year a seven and eight-year-old children You'll Always Find they accept each other you know why they got something important right like one time you know now we're not saying I like the elderly people shouldn't uh associate with the younger ones and things like that or be befriend them or whatever we're not saying that but you know one time at work and we are just working colleagues and this one fellow was there and this other guy was the supervisor she was part of an elderly family we had some youngsters working there as well as you'll find always this you know absolutely supervisors will always go you know you'll be around those young fellows so other fellow was about the supervisor's age he turned around told us he says look at this fellow oh who is going there with this young family you know with their kind of a jokes and all this thing why it shows you know that someone seem to be no compatibility all right so what is it teaching us Isaiah told us little children pray playing in the streets his little children okay so little children attract little children so I wanted to run and say he says you know what in Germany he says little Americans and little Germans play together he didn't say there was a segregation because I'm American I would not be with the children they probably know nothing about nothing but they were of that same age that same group and they started playing together solution now the point is what does Simon the Pharisee have to do with Jesus that's why people remember him say there's something wrong with the study right then young women have things in common the middle age have things in common old people have things in common all right so let's come a little more I wouldn't say deeper but there's a our senses are good buzzards can talk about some old Partners dead Partners somewhere all right all right Sinners talk about the big dances and parties how was your parties how was your dances Sinners talk about that Sinners talk about big dances and parties all right Christians talk about wholesome things all right and good things and sinners talk about dirty things you don't even want to be with them why your diet is different amen yes the unwelcome Christ foreign he said what do they do to my Lord and the prophet cried and he cried all right creatures of the night and fellowship and darkness the Sun that the night creatures they can't have fellowship with the creatures of the day they just can't so what Fellowship did the Pharisee have with Jesus this point again remember it was customary before Jesus could step into the house now Frankie was at the door at the door right the point is how did you receive because when everyone comes in and goes around turns back and said but he was Mr Jones's feet yeah it's like a political setup so here you find everything is all set up and the slang is in purposely I know I'll pretend obviously this anointing of the Pharisees you must be always one of them too the actors who pretend I didn't even see this man so he goes in Jesus is so dirty feet all right and he goes into the dining hall and he sits there and here comes this woman an infinite woman a woman that had a bad name in society nobody wanted to look at her right what did she do and Jesus sitting at the table would unwashed feet he washed the feet he said of Dr Jones and all the other dignitaries and Jesus Takes second or third place a ball with you when you persisted in oh I tell you you say you love him you only love him because he first loves you amen right so yeah so the old Story Goes to say and the prophet is telling us the woman you know had an opportunity but don't miss it you alsoever yes amen hallelujah somebody said what will you what will you do neutral you cannot be [Music] okay someday your soul will be asking what will he do you love the Lord this morning amen okay let's go to one or two things in your time a bit all right so we find okay yeah we watch okay watching this uh you know from prophet's perspective another Eagle's perspective and here you find actually we find Prophet tells us you know the church needs a bird and not a facelift it's not going to help you amen but you need a bit amen born again all right the Bible speaks about being begotten again that's born again yeah all right so you find that's what we really need okay this is one of two things but some things that I want to just miss is very very uh important right okay so we're watching uh all these things okay okay so we're looking let's let's just touch a little on this but we say we find I'm gonna look at that woman all right so she's busy watching feet and she anoints him the Bible says you know she uh even with the hair should wipe his feet do all these things well he shares and opportunity he said you and I also have opportunities today God once our fellowship this morning okay and fellowship must not be artificial yes amen okay uh was would anybody else Fellowship was not friendship you can have a lot of friends but very few that you're going to have fellowship with yes all right so you find Fellowship you must be transparent you must be honest okay like the Pharisees lots of people are pretending in all walks of life also people are pretending in all walks of life well we find we human beings are like this but it's not good because some people can only fellowship with graduates yeah graduates fellowshipping with graduates all right but Paul I fellowship with the Greeks and The Barbarians the uncultured the uneducated and the uncivilized what's that great Apostolic just to touch that year and there this morning okay now let's come to this some some kind of sovereign things God must help us there was a church one time Minister began to say you know the church you see that there's one particular time he says uh I will say his church all right he used to fast every Saturday that's a very Gallant thing right every Saturday they will fast all right and what they would do they would read their Bible on their knees such reverence for the word of God right actually what do we do we stand we read in the Bible these are all scriptural things right but these people say you know what we will go on our knees with a fast wait on the Lord right now these are honest people so the most is a very honest man but he wondered why the people do this you can go through all the emotions sometimes no change yes new life amen yes no but yeah what has happened and people are doing this every Saturday you know for most people Saturday is a very busy day with the uh you know only things that people do on a Saturday is people with a great sacrifice you said I wondered why they did not change he says in a way backbiting they were still hating they were still doing all these things that is why there wasn't a change so the Lord told him God told this man I believe you've been an honest man so God told this man he was spending time with the book but not with him even when we meditate we don't meditate on the Lord but our uh our minds are on other things of Fellowship John says the eagle must be with the father and the son amen amen all right so by the way it is in passing so I came across this one time and they said there was a certain Methodist Church maybe in that Iran that's what they did but I want to show you the respect they add so what they used to do in kind of Bibles today lots of our Bibles my pages might have dogs years they say it also might be covered with dust all right because it depends how long you've read our Bibles we're supposed to be in love with him all right so we do all these things rather we don't do what we're supposed to be doing but what these people used to do this Methodist people they have the word of God to such I esteem they will have the Bible locked up in a special room and when the service starts all right the time for reading the Bible they will have the Bible wheeled into the church will the Bible in he felt unworthy to even hold the Bible it was real in the Bible was read whatever was read was taken back and locked into him how precious is the word of God all right amen okay this is closed now a little bit okay really finish off this morning okay so they'll be fine so look just as a as a testimony maybe it's a bit out of the subject but maybe somebody needs this amen or we all need it right so we find one time brother Brian was mother-in-law a clock did not work all right you know in those days that people are very poor and couldn't afford it much of these things but we find that she could not do without a clock right she didn't have the money to buy another clock it should go down and read when she looked up the clock worked perfectly with God yeah she must say I would really add a true relationship with the Lord right a couple of days after that a fridge kept defrosting she didn't have the money to buy another fridge she said Lord will you be merciful to me again she got up and looked the refrigerator he says it froze all around it worked perfectly so what is he saying don't mentally figure it out just believe it amen with your soul all right on the message on the uncertain sound and by the way this is amen Hallelujah story of that creature remember the Bible said preach the gospel to every creature not only human beings now you know the prophet stories we know all of that but let's because a little bit right now here comes this opposium that came to the prophet's door that creature all right came together if you really look at the story you find by the way it was a fifth house which was the prophet saws he left four other houses yeah past four other houses and he came to the fifth house what told this teacher amen there's a picture here there's a prophet there's the ego here all right so we find so and you know we are told the other houses were closer to him he left all of that okay the right thing we find in the mental realm of sociality the right thing was to kill it because his life was almost gone it was something Prophet says was down here wouldn't let me do it okay he says soul okay Mark 16 said preach the prosecutor every creature animals and human beings she Mo she knew more than the preachers that denied Divine Healing preachers and with the deity whatever they call it they deny Divine you know she knew more than them never went to school you know with God it doesn't really matter you can be educated with God is nothing all right even if you're uneducated with God is nothing now with men down here it means something but not from God amen amen that's why it took a seventh prophet of the seventh grade education and he said you'll go around the world with around the world seven times you confronted and you know even prayed for monarchs and great people so she knew more about the preachers she followed the leading of the Holy Spirit to go to the prophet's door if God could do that to an oppism how much more could he do it to you amen hallelujah there's an ego perspective this morning that we're looking at all right brother in the message uncertain sound he says Saint Francis of Assisi while he was preaching he told the birds to keep preach the gospel preach the gospel to every teacher that the Virgin at that point okay so we find now like you said you know you said uh okay we're coming back to that you know what John was saying everything else would pass the world will remember Peter told us he says you know I saw the evidence of the Earth the role as a scroll okay and of course he tells us about the new world come in why is all passes away so what I told you this morning we will see our loved once again amen whatever says I will give a hundred million dollars to talk to my dad will pass on for just one hour right [Music] just for one hour so you turn back and see what is money worth how much more is a soul than money the world is passing away the evil eye had caught okay so he says nobody's fault if I found one piece he says you know I can't find it what you say rather he says I wonder will you please value I turned back he said even he at times because he had to work on a on a Sunday all right he says but then you know he says I appreciated it appreciate a little time to work and you can get a little more money you see because I was in debt he said I wasn't dead but he says where did it get me where did that get me all right so all these things this morning is really really going to pass right so let's close this one quote on the handwriting on the wall right the world we said evil will system all right like somebody was saying you know sometimes you know people you can talk about our children both about their children and all these kind of things right and then they wonder why isn't my children spiritual return back and says you know what because you let them to feed on this evil World System how do you expect them to be spiritual okay so we find out the devil wants to keep you from being born again don't let him explain it away born again is a real experience every one of us must have that experience right so handwriting on the wall it says worldliness speaking on worldliness is he says Church flowing would list resistance are we in that category when the Wilderness is going so strong but the church is just flowing not resisting it with least resistance stand up for the system and says you know what he says the Rapture is an end yeah Okay so we've got to redefine our rightful position there's much here for as I said from the ego's perspective it actually brings us higher into Revelation amen all right like we said Revelation remember now Revelation seals have been opened all these Prophet auras since the seals were open the Bible became a new amen hallelujah you see we look at things differently we look at different Eagle's perspective from the view of an eagle shall we just pray God bless you thank you for your patience foreign by this morning you know we we need him okay this is not anybody to look around just going to ask people to bow in prayer I won't even be looking around if you feel you know you need prayer in some way this morning you can raise your hand to the Lord and I just want to pray let's find forgive me dear God in heaven Lord we thank you we have nothing to fear because your word is the ultimate and Lord what we do is by our best of our knowledge and understanding trying to present these things to your children Lord Jesus in the end we want to be one bless family in heaven together with the rest of the church is the Believers and throughout the world in eternity or God will be the love will be Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ with the bridegroom we thank you we know that your word is helping us shaping us each day bringing us a little more into statue

perspective amen and I believe we are eagles gathered together amen under the revealed word of the hour you know there's something about eagles they saw above the things of this world they say if you if you're bumping into chickens you're flying too low amen if your Association is with chickens and you're flying too low you ought to be out there in the heavenlies that's where the ego thrives amen and Eagles can't feed them chicken food amen Eagles feed on the revealed word of the hour on Revelation of the hour which is a stimulation of Revelation amen hallelujah so certainly you were blessed this morning amen amen an ego's perspective amen hallelujah and we know that we were typing John John was the type of the Bride so everything John saw the amen we are seeing it in reality form John saw it in symbol form with the bride are seeing it in reality form amen think of it John when he's writing about Revelation 10 he is writing about a mighty angel coming down and the prophet Revelation 10 7 he is only writing it in simple form how privileged are you and I to be seeing it in Revelation form when it's being revealed when it's being unfolded and then you amen being a type of the Bride will now needs to take that book and eat the book and that's what we are doing we're eating the word amen and as we are eating that word it's changing us giving us faith for your rapture and one of these days we will take our final flights amen actually looking forward to that day let's stand together let's give our dear Pastor amen appreciation thank the Lord amen for you sacrifice for his
