Praise amen Ramesh amen we miss you amen you missed a good service on Sunday amen hallelujah you must have read on WhatsApp yes at least you can rely on whatsoever to tell you what's up what's happening the happenings of God Amen praise the Lord amen so just this afternoon you would have read amen what's his leg is healing now I asked you to observe that and who was here you want me to read a report to you this is what the prophet spoke about yeah yeah she says God bless Saints I want to give God all the praise Glory and Honor just got back from the doctor and the doctor is now testifying the doctor said that he's surprised with the results because all the symptoms indicated kidney problems all my results came back clear hallelujah thank you all for praying with me yes thank you Jesus now somebody was here to change the situation amen who was there who was it that moved through here and touched brother Joshua was he did the chances to Sarah amen and didn't we end with that quote that some of you have been healed you don't even know it that's how the court ended on Sunday the prophet says it's all good one and healing's here and you don't even know it amen but faith is an incredible thing yes amen and that's what God has come to do to give us make us people of Faith amen and I believe he is is moving us to the villains amen not for self-glorification if you can only get I me and we out of the way yes amen and exalt him yes you can do the Greater Works through US yes hey amen amen amen so let's turn to Second Kings chapter two I'm going to speak a little thought amen you know it's our witnessed in that prayer meeting and you'll find the faithful Believers amen come amen we just want to draw closer to the Lord a little title I want to speak on we have a double portion anointing of the Holy Spirit yes amen but even that must be believed by faith must be received by faith amen and we're going to see here how Elisha is going to be asking not God for something you ever notice that yes Elisha doesn't ask God for it yes amen he asked Elijah for it yes amen amen so let's read from verse one we'll read a few portions of that and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from yoga amen now the prophet teaches us that Elijah is the type of the church yes so there is somebody that's staying with the prophet that's walking with the prophet amen amen amen and that's the true church that's not forsaken William Branham he's our Fort Elijah come on now yes right amen we are message Believers we have an end time Prophet yes that's right amen and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord and sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I will not leave thee so he had a choice to make yeah and he is making the choice I will not leave you so they progress in the journey and they come down to better now here they find the sons of the Prophet that went that were at Battle and they said unto him Noah star not know us that the Lord will take away thy master from the head today and he said yeah I know it hold he your peace so you see these people are very discerning nobody told them this but they were operating in the prophetic as well now if you if you understand what I'm telling you out there they're operating the prophetic as well the sons of the prophet amen and they are coming to tell Elisha the Lord is going to take your master away now wasn't there prophecy that these people put out always and they had a prophecy that William Branham was going to be taken away have you heard it yeah yeah you heard it right what's this guy I forget his name yeah yeah somebody like that right but they keep coming now to tell Elijah this and you'll see it's not more than it's not just once they keep coming back to him so they came to Jericho and the sons of the Prophet said where Jericho also came to Elijah and said knows thou that the Lord will take that Master from thy head today and he answered yeah I know it holy your peace and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray he here for the Lord had sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and thee too went on now how many times did he tell him that three times so notice this bride will go all the way into the third pool amen we are not staying he told him to stay in the first pool he said no amen he told him go stay here in the second pool he said no amen amen amen he told him the third time and he went through them all the way into the third pool and you'll see it manifest here amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord and the 50 men now that 50 is typing Pentecost 50s type of Pentecost amen hallelujah and they stood to view of half and they they too stood by Jordan and Elijah took the man took his mantle now here's the important part we want to get to and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoked the waters and they were divided either until so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee notice a man is asking another man and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me amen and he said that was asked a half thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so now notice Elijah is not saying anything about the mantle amen and you'll see what the prophet is saying about the mantle amen Elisha is not interested in the mental he's interested in the double portion anointing amen praise the Lord you're getting it amen and he said that was I say our thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so so he had to keep his eyes fixed on the prophet yes yes and it came to pass yes they were still went on and talked and behold they appeared Chariot of Fire and Horses of fire there's the Unseen World now the supernatural World we're talking about amen so did they travel thousands of miles hundreds of kilometers or do they come from a dimension the dimension just opened up yes and it was there and part of them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the Osmond day off and he saw him no more and he took all of his own clothes and rent them into pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah and when he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan so having the the mantle is not good enough right you got to put your faith into action amen and he goes back to the bank of Jordan verse 14 and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had us when he also had smitten the waters they parted either until the and Elijah went over okay let's stop reading there we'll go to verse Luke 24 49. praise the Lord Luke 24 49 . this is our lord Jesus speaking to go from verse 48 and you are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry he in the city of Jerusalem until he be endured with power from on high amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word may be seated amen so the prophet is teaching us that that enduring of power from an eye is similar to Elijah's anointing going on in a double portion too Elisha he says Jesus walked the same way when Elijah left he sent a double portion upon Elijah Elijah when Jesus left he sent us his holy spirit amen hallelujah so the church is not a defeated Church Jesus didn't want us to be a defeated church amen Jesus came to put the power back in the church amen so you'll find in Elijah's Ministry the prophet will teach us there was four Miracles but in Elijah there was eight yeah so he was doing the Greater Works amen so he says that the church tonight ought to be operating under a double portion of the spirit amen amen amen watching Christ longing for Christ searching for his presence Amen laboring to enter into his presence amen they are definitely anointings and we were trying to touch on that image they had demonic influences their demonic anointings and you can be attached to that anointing yes now don't get confused now you say oh can I be filled with the Elijah's anointing double portion anointing and the Holy Spirit you know people get confused when it comes to the spiritual things of God but it's not hard for us to believe that thousands of demons can possess one man that a legion can possess one man that's why the prophet says watch now sometimes you take your pastor spirit instead of the Holy Spirit he says you're watching past tonight he says amen and you find after a while if they take his Spirit they'll say Amen Hallelujah and if your pastor likes jumping around I wish some of you take this amen then you'll find the church jumping around amen but what is it it's the atmosphere that's created it's the influence amen hallelujah so God that's what he's doing tonight he wants the church to watch him to observe his ways and to observe how he's moving keep our eyes focused like Elisha kept his eyes on Elijah amen and the prophet tells us he couldn't keep his eye on the world and keep his eye on Elijah amen he had to be single line he had to keep both eyes fixed on Elijah amen amen he says the trouble of it now is we got too many Christian people professing Christians got one eye on the world and the other on the cross amen you'll fall as sure as the world let your eyes be single let your heart be single let your thoughts be single he says brother that rubs in but that hurts but it's good yeah yeah amen hallelujah praise the Lord now he also goes on to tell us that God takes his man of the sin but never his Spirit yeah amen Hallelujah you'll find this in the message the hour is come amen God takes his Spirit from the Earth oh sorry God takes the man from the Earth but never his Spirit right he says do you know that he took Elijah Elijah but a double portion of Elijah's Spirit come upon Elisha and several hundred years he came out in John the Baptist and he's predicted to come out again in the last day is that right God takes his man but not his Spirit his Spirit remains here he says when his spirit's gone then the church is gone there's no more salvation no more care Mercy is over them the spirit's gone the Holy Spirit was upon the apost that was upon the apostles he's here tonight I mean if you can say Amen you know if I asked the question without the evidence that we've seen you probably would have been skeptical but you notice how all of you raise your hand amen amen amen because you've seen it evident yeah amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen now you don't need to have faith if you got good eyesight if I tell brother Ramesh that's brother Joshua sitting next to you do you believe brother Joshua if you look at him do you need Faith to believe that or can you rely on your senses but if I told you there's an angel sitting next to you now amen you need to believe it with the sixth sense so the things of God must be believed by faith okay so he says I want you to notice the season your father always come paragraph 16. I want you to notice it's the same holy spirit that was in the days of the Apostles amen yes is here now present tense I wanted to soak in now yes because this is the season we're living and this message is called the hour is come amen amen amen amen I want you to notice it's the same holy spirit that was in the days of the Apostles he's here now present tense in this meeting working among the people amen and it behooves us to realize this you see sometimes the presence of God can go unrecognized that it isn't your brother it is your lord Jesus who is here amen and we are all representatives of his yes now we know that's the truth do you believe that's true now that his holy spirit is here he's just as willing and he can work through the people as the people will let him work oh yes that's right that's why the Lord is working is because you are allowing him to work amen hallelujah I know you're not easily offended because nobody ever came to me and said ah bro you spoke to me I know you some rugged not some hotbed plants yes amen you recognize the spirit speaking and calling out the error yes and you're willing to take the correction amen make the adjustments yeah and say Lord more of your spirit more of your anointing oh God you know we come to a place now where we feel like we'll die without his anointing we'll die without his spirits happy if you feel that way amen hallelujah amen amen oh talk about a love story amen the The Love Story between the man and woman is nothing compared to the Love Story between God and us hallelujah amen there's a fire burning within us amen Hallelujah right he he tells us that if any particular man's spirit is upon you will start acting like that man right and he says if I confess to have the spirit of Jesus Christ we should do the same things that Jesus did amen amen amen Hallelujah now it wasn't he says when the Lord appeared to Moses it wasn't Moses it was the angel of God then we had the pull of fire that led the children of Israel and that's what the angel of the Covenant amen and it's the same yesterday today and forever and he says that Let the church the same one that led the church back there in the Natural Body talking about Israel he's the same one leading us the spiritual body right and now you know we got the picture of the pull of fire you can put it up if you got it that's a Vindication that no denomination can boast about you'll never find this picture in any denominational Church they are not at the pillar of fire amen amen hallelujah thank you you see most people when they look at this picture they focus on this yeah that's right yes yes why you got this White Man's picture in your everywhere we are looking at the one above amen Christ our head is coming Amen to lead the church praise the Lord amen now Elisha was wrapped like if you find the message second-handed robe I'll give you the uh amen praise the Lord secondhand row paragraph It's 56 11 25 amen I just want you to get some things here where the Prophet is saying it amen we find that Elisha wrapped himself in Elijah's rope and he's walking and the prophet says he wasn't walking with like a defeated person he was walking like a conqueror amen he was marching to the Jordan River he had a purpose he knew that he shall receive whatsoever he asked for he knew that this Elijah was connected to God and he knew that this man Elijah will not lie to him he had confidence in the man that's why the prophet saying you need to have the confidence in the one who's leading you right if you've got no confidence in him then he says you'd rather go find somebody else who you can have confidence in amen hallelujah so he's coming down with the victim's March he's marching down Onward Christian Soldiers marching us to war remember he feels nothing he feels no different amen it's not going on feelings maybe right now you don't feel any different but the power of the Holy Ghost is here amen amen you need to put your faith into action the moment you activate Faith amen the power of the almighty God is here Amen to do the impossible so his ma he's marching and he says just like the Church of Christ now the body of Christ is robbed in Christ we are robbed with Christ what is Christ the anointing we are robbed with the anointing marching to Victory to what not to just to the Jordan Jordan type death but we are Marching to a body change amen I mean if you can testify your magic your body change amen yeah you've been put you on the earth for this time and this season to manifest first Thessalonians amen amen Hallelujah that's one of the scriptures you can tell them brother look I I need to share something with you one of these days you're gonna come looking for me you're not going to find me amen and this is the reason why yeah amen show them the scripture tell them if you don't try me don't get worried don't go put out a missing person's alert don't go notify the authorities I'm informing you now look at first Thessalonians 4. amen we which are alive and remain our body shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen and I want you to know something else brother if you see me gone you must know don't go and visit the uh the grains and put flowers and all that because the dead in Christ have already Arisen amen hallelujah praise the Lord now tonight if you feel you see Elisha felt trapped because the waters are parted behind him maybe the waters have passed behind you you feel Elijah's gone amen sometimes people are left in in this Quantum and they left in these thoughts what happened now that William Branham is gone I feel like the waters have closed now I say that some people not us because we've had those questions but the Lord has reparted the waters for us amen amen he says the waters may have been closed behind you but it's time to Cross Jordan time to strike the waters with what f a i t h he had no word from the law that if instructed water it was going to pass amen that's right so my my my my my admonishment to you is is this make sure the mentor that you're asking for is a man that's anointed yes a man who's been with God amen amen a man who talks with God amen amen a man who has fellowship with God amen he wasn't asking from any priest from just any old King but he was asking from the prophet of God Amen a man who was Fearless a man who had a experience in the backside of the desert a man who was not afraid to walk in the midst of giants in the midst of Kings a man who was not afraid to challenge Jezebel and King Air amen amen amen a man who can walk in the midst of criticism yes yes a man who's not afraid to walk out into the unknown amen Hallelujah a man who can walk alone with God a tested man a tried man amen make sure the mental that you are asking for is from a holy ghost filmed amen amen the prophet will tell us here don't put on somebody else's second-handed robe that's not eaten amen sometimes you feed off of somebody that's sharing the word of God and you can just feel it's not eaten amen there's doubts there's fears there's amen there's the defeats there's superstitions that come out of it you experience ups and downs the Ebbs and flows of life there's no sure foundation in what they are preaching amen he says don't put your trust in a church that once taught salvation that one starts Divine Healing he says they are not eaten amen that that silently will never say that they believe the days of Miracles are passed but they actually do believe it because they say since Branham fell asleep we have not seen the move of God amen all not eaten with doubt and everything else he says you put on the robe of Christ the Conqueror put on the Rope of him that never lost a battle amen then you're on your road to Jordan amen if you got second-hand rope amen you can go to 106. praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen hallelujah amen I think they're getting ready to switch amen Hallelujah you get one of six I think they're going to start the generator soon amen praise the Lord how many of you know you can ask God for a double portion of anointing yes Elisha at the conference to ask him amen right now you can ask him amen say Lord before the service finishes we are reaching upward point now amen Hallelujah amen just bow your head and ask him now amen why don't we switch this let's just ask the Lord let's use this time father even now Lord Jesus yes Lord you send a double portion anointing of your Holy Spirit Lord father I pray Lord God that it will be so real oh God so tangible father that you can move through this place like a mighty rushing wind oh God and sweep through this place oh God and Father Lord may your Holy Spirit Come here through the place of God touching lives anointing people oh God lord filling us with your Holy Spirit Lord Jesus just father God moving in a way oh God that's brooding over our hearts right now settling us oh God and Father Lord knowing and settling that thing that we are believing for oh God to know it is finished oh God yes and no Lord that you are the same yesterday today and forever and you can do it even now Lord Jesus father I pray you'll touch your people Lord yes and even now father God I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit Lord will anoint Him Father and Lord I pray father God there will be such a move of the Holy Spirit amongst them Lord Jesus that Lord they will Lord be said Ablaze oh God to be Witnesses of his Dynamic power Lord Jesus of his authority Lord Jesus I believe oh God you are able to do it even now Lord Jesus and we are asking of you he said ask anything in your name and he shall be given and we ask right now Lord Jesus that you shall do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think Lord Jesus I pray Lord and I thank you for it I thank you for answering prayer I thank you Lord Jesus that you've heard our prayer Lord and that Lord you have granted it to us yes bless your name now hallelujah thank you for it in Jesus name amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen while they're getting that up amen so if you're reading the story now most people would think it was the mantle that part of the waters amen most people would think it was Elijah's Mantle that part of the waters but remember what Elisha asked for he never told him I want your mental he said I want a double portion anointing yeah yeah right so it was not the mantle sometimes people look at the thing being used oh yes the Holy Spirit bringing this now so here's the metal and you strike the water and you think if I can only get the mantle yes but it's not that yeah yeah so sometimes people chase gifted men yes yes but it's not the Gifted Man yeah amen it's the god amen amen now let's go to 106. you got it let's read from here now he had his on his second-handed rope that's true and many of the people this morning have second-handed robes on but when he comes to the Jordan he realized that the robe alone wouldn't do the work amen yeah he says oh we got schools we have ethics of the Bible down pat we've got all our doctrines better down we've got the woven rope all right the promises we've got it all all we are baptized we're all baptized amen we're very Apostolic we have an Apostolic Faith we believe in Divine Healing we believe in God we believe in the powers we're baptized in the Bible the way the Bible says we receive the Holy Ghost we spoke in tongues we do all that but brother if that's the only thing you need you'll find your lack when you come to Jordan you see now he's taking us to the hidden Mystery he says you may have The Robe of the message search on you oh sorry Methodist Church you may have the rope of the Pentecostal Church on you may have the Rope of assemblies on you or the Oneness or the trinitarians whatever it might be it's only a second-handed rope to begin with that's right some man-made dogmas been taught up so forth like that and even if you have been a Christian and the church has been a Christian and wrote correctly 108 now but when Elisha's standing up visible to the old Bank right he's visible to the old Bank land full of prophets and critics seeing what he would do you know he come walking with Elijah's robot is good otherwise he's educated he's submitted he believes there's nothing wrong with him he comes down to the Jordan and the world is watching him so we need to go to 110 there and when he come down to the Jordan to face the critical world what did he cry amen where is the god of Elijah amen amen you hear what he says now it wasn't the robe of Elijah that done it it was the power of the god of Elijah that's done it thank you amen hallelujah amen it was in the robe of Elijah that done it it was the power of God of Elijah that done it and the thing the world needs this morning is the power of the god of Elijah and if you wondered amen the power of the god of Elijah you might have spoke with tongues and shouted and ran over the floor but what we need is the power of God of Pentecost to produce the lives and things that was lived in that day in the apostolic power amen and by God's help amen hallelujah that's what's been put into the church the apostolic power back in the church amen amen hallelujah a second-handed wrote was all right but he needed a fresh call in his heart from God oh Lord even tonight Lord I need a fresh call I need a fresh start Lord Jesus amen that's my prayer he needed a fresh anointing from God He Wore a second-handed robe when he came down to the river but he needed a brand new first-handed call from God amen or I feel that way because you know what I'm talking about I don't want to say it amen because I don't want to seem like I'm being against something amen but it feels like we've been wearing a second-handed robe all the time if you've got discernment you know what I mean amen hallelujah but we want a brand new first-handed call from God a first-handed power from God to perform the what the miracle amen amen now this next thing is going to really revive you because God is demanding for you to believe the impossible then you must make a demand back right he says don't be afraid to ask God for anything amen yes only spiritual things don't be afraid to ask God for Spiritual things somebody correct me anything you must ask politely you must ask sorry you got to help me here tonight [Music] do you know what a demand is brother Tyson you know husbands are very demanding I'd rather say it that way we won't get in trouble demand amen Hallelujah you must demand God or ask God for anything that he promised for I am introducing a God that's omnipotent and all-powerful amen and if I be a servant of God I must do the works of God and if you are Servants of God then you must do the works of God amen here again I must demand God to bring these things to pass because he is demanding me to produce the impossible amen I have to ask him so God is demanding you to do the impossible do you know it's not possible according to science and man to heal a blind man to give man back his side to make a crippled man walk right they're coming now Satan is coming remembers they're reaching the height now with AI yeah AI can give you limbs AI can bypass if you've got a spinal damage and can't walk they can connect you put a chip in your head and via Bluetooth send the signal down to your legs and your legs can obey so they are trying to compete with God Supernatural power why now because there's a church operating it now amen the counterfeit is here amen I must demand of God to bring these things to pass because he is demanding me of me to produce the impossible so you come across somebody like I came across somebody the other day telling me they got a walking with crutches they got a bone four inch shorter than the other I told him don't tell me the symptom my God can heal that right now fix that for you right now don't focus on the trouble amen you focus on the word the word is the absolute these son shall follow them that believe yes amen hallelujah praise the Lord I'm gonna read it again because it's so beautiful I must demand of God to bring these things to pass because he is demanding of me to produce the impossible I have to ask him I have to call upon him and stand there and say God you promised it yes so do you every person amen then he quotes here you shall receive power Acts 1. amen after the holy spirit is come upon you after the Holy Spirit has come upon you after your rope there's a Christian after your faith has set in Christ then you shall receive power now if you're sick this morning and want to be healed I can prove to you Christ gave you the promise the promise is yours if thou can't believe you know that's Mark 9 23 right don't be defeated now watch what he says you're very very very very very very profound statement as I stood preaching on David and Goliath now it isn't a Goliath that hindered me God is laying before me but the thing that hindered me is a lack of faith is the lack of something that I knew was around we need the God I feel this is 119 now this is what we have been crying the whole year we need the god of Elijah we need the power of the god of Elijah back in our church the power to make it holy and call God's word right regardless amen praise the Lord now let's turn to John 11 John 14. amen John 14. praise the Lord I'm not going to be much longer because it's our prayer meeting I'm just exhorting amen and then we'll pray Hallelujah amen praise the Lord Saint John 14 12 goddess amen so what did we land in Elijah us amen and he got his heart's desire so if you know how Faith Works did Elijah have faith did he already believe he has received it that's how Faith operates believe that you have already received what you have asked for you so if we know how Elijah received it Elisha when he asked Elijah even though he didn't feel anything he believed he already had it right and when the test came and he proved and he asked where's the god of Elijah and he struck towards us the proof was there you could be walking around a simple humble young man a simple angle brother simple humble sister but in the time you were asked in the time of need you know the prophet Charles of Samson wasn't a big-sized man with big muscles and everything that's right and that's why the Philistines were amazed because when the anointing Came Upon him he could carry the gates of the city he could slay a lion that was showing the power of God amen amen yeah brother Joshua was telling me you don't mind to share your test tomorrow amen I know he's full of dynamic quickening power amen and he wants to come and share his testimony amen but he was just telling me today that he's walking through the office and then somebody calls him you know offers an open Office full of people and they're telling you're a man of God my phone's not working come pray for it there are the man of God that other Pastor was it was your pastor the other person the other office they told us that his phone wasn't working one time and he prayed for it so now he's put your open challenge imagine you're walking in office and somebody tell you that what you're going to tell him you think I'm a cell phone you think do I look Pakistani to you amen but if you know who you're walking with amen you know the angel of God is with you so brother Joshua shares the scripture what scripture did you share brother Joshua sorry Mark 9 23 the scripture we're walking in right if that can't believe all things are possible amen so I believe he takes the phone he prays for it and then you started to speak to them and as they speaking the person notices the phone and screams my phone is working amen amen amen amen hallelujah you see he got his Pastor Spirit on him now because I told him the other day he wants to compete with me now so I gotta watch this I prayed for the phone into what now you see amen but that you know that inspires one another's faith amen these testimonies Inspire one another you remember the time you shared about your so when he had the same problem he said you refer to your testimony so these things rub off of one another it builds the faith amen I remember one time when I was sharing the testimony about how I prayed and I said Lord send your angel to go touch that baby then brother Jaffa told me when he's was it your mom that was sick he remembered that testimony he said Lord you can send your angel to touch my mom amen hallelujah so that's what testimonies are therefore amen hallelujah I'm reminded now the prophet was telling us about this one story that this woman came into the prayer line and she had an anchor over a face like this and he was wondering why she was doing that and he was still operating under the vibration of the hand and she touched his coat and he says we were moving the fast line and she didn't want to let go of him and then he told then why when because she touched him that vibration went through his body and he could discern what was wrong with her and he says woman do you know you have cancer and just as he said that she lowered the Anki and you saw her nose was all eaten it was all eaten up and she told him I've been looking for you all over I've been believing for you to meet you and I believe the Lord will be able to touch me and the Lord said the prophet says you know that's very good faith you got and he prayed for and he says he met a son a few weeks later and he says his mother is a changed woman so she went back to the doctor and the doctor couldn't recognize her the doctor says what happened to you she says well I changed doctors because she had a new nose amen amen amen I'll put that quote up on the WhatsApp group you can read it she had a new nose amen and she told that doctor I changed my doctor she says the doctor says oh what's his name she says Dr Jesus amen amen the doctor says oh I never heard about him he says where does he operate from he says he operates from glory amen praise the Lord you know the prophet that ways to dramatize these stories amen so yeah we have John 14 verse 12 very really verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also who's going to do it the one that believes on Jesus and Greater Works and these shall he do because I go unto my father now he hasn't asking that the Lord is going to ask you in the next verse amen and you be like Elisha now and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do now please I need all of you to not let this lay here right now don't let the asking be from here Amen Let It Be from here if you really want to see it work right now yes amen did he say ask for anything I'm going to read for you now and then you'll see what I'm telling you whatsoever you asking my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son you see the purpose behind it Lord do this for me that you may be glorified of God I promise I will testify some people don't like to testify some people don't like to testify and they in lies the problem Jesus is telling us about the man who refused to give thanks only one came back that if it wasn't important for Jesus he wouldn't have put that there yes he wants a thankful heart amen amen sometimes you do something with somebody and they don't thank you they don't have common courtesy amen but we should always be thankful that's right amen hallelujah if you can find the message God commissioning Moses amen God commissioning Moses got it oh 508 and in paragraph 37 let brother Joshua find this quote because you're going to really enjoy it amen you got it he says when they crossed over got over on the other side he said now you've asked ask what you will and I will give it to you right he's talking about Elijah now and Elijah did you receive what he asked for us all right he says that's a perfect type of the church yes amen I really pray that some people who needs you that's really got some requests because I want to see The God Who is able to do exceedingly abundantly fulfill them right now he says I want a double portion of your spirit a head amen hello thank you Lord don't be afraid to ask sparingly sorry what did he say brother Tyson abundantly ask abundantly you have not because you ask not you ask not because you that's right ask you a lot God will give you a lot amen said I want the prophet's poverty eh did you catch it with Ramesh you didn't hear that I'll share that with you outside amen Hallelujah God will give you a whole lot have a whole lot of faith if fella told me the other day he said he was riding a old model G4 now he has to somebody who's believing for something physical right he says one day

are satisfied with what you have right now I don't know if you are not satisfied amen then what the key word there is us Elijah didn't go and discern Elisha's heart and tell him I perceive that you have need of a double portion the asking must come from you yes amen amen amen so we're gonna we're gonna stop maybe here and then we're going to be able to pray and the prophet will say I believe there's something here in the second miracle I believe there's something coming that's going to be a double portion to the church and I feel that down in my heart the mental a double portion Jesus said the things that I do shall heed also and greater more of it a double portion you are witnesses after you receive the double portion let's watch him keep your eyes on him the mental is down the

Hallelujah I want to lay this in closing and just show you just to re-establish what we've been preaching and here let you hear it from the prophet if you get the authority of the word 0602 the authority of the word I'm going to read here now the prophet also says now bow your heads if you will let's bow our heads paragraph 29 right if you're writing it down so that's the message the authority of the word paragraph 29 he says now buy your heads if you will it's mental nervousness now the woman stops the prophet and asks the prophet you'll you'll read this in the message now he says the woman asks should I believe when I feel like I'm dying all the time the prophet said See You Must Believe regardless of anything you never go to your feeling you go to your faith that's where the lacking of it is I want you to be well okay I think I think you need to see this quote maybe look up at it maybe it's really going to help you now right let's read it again so the woman stops the prophet in the prayer while he's designing it starts Discerning and it's saying it's mental nervousness the woman saying should I believe when I feel like I'm dying all the time can you see it there he says You Must Believe regardless of anything you never go on your feeling you go to your faith amen that's where you are lacking of its sister I want you to be well see it's not a it's mental
