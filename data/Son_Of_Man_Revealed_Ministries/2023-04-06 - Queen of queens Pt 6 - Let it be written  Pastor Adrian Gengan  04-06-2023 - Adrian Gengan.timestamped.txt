[8:37] amen
[8:39] who's the queen of Queens amen somebody
[8:42] say me
[8:44] Amen Let It Be written
[8:48] and the inspiration is from if you say
[8:50] Mark 11 23 amen
[8:52] hallelujah let's take our scripture
[8:55] reading let's take it from Esther
[8:56] chapter 3 for the Caleb you'll go into
[8:58] your uh
[9:00] Bible
[9:01] update and project the scriptures I
[9:03] don't have it all typed up amen Esther
[9:05] chapter 3 and verse 7.
[9:08] Hallelujah
[9:10] amen
[9:13] if it please the king now this is amen
[9:16] talking
[9:17] Let It Be written that they may be
[9:20] destroyed talking about the Jews and I
[9:23] will pay ten thousand talents of silver
[9:24] to the hands of those that have the
[9:27] charge of business to bring it into the
[9:29] king's Treasures
[9:31] and the King took his ring from his hand
[9:33] now learned from these things the king's
[9:35] sealed a ringing that time had a seal
[9:39] and that's how they signed their letters
[9:42] amen
[9:43] they put it in ink and the letter was
[9:46] signed once that was done nothing could
[9:49] change it not even the king himself
[9:51] could change it
[9:53] amen
[9:55] so he took the ring from his finger and
[9:57] gave it to aim and the son of Emma data
[10:00] the agatite the Jews enemy and the King
[10:03] said to Amon the silver is given to thee
[10:05] the people also
[10:08] to do with them as it seemed good to
[10:11] thee so power and authority of the
[10:13] kingdom is being given to amen
[10:15] amen then then were the king scribes
[10:19] called on the 13th day of the first
[10:21] month what's the first month listen
[10:24] and they were written according to all
[10:27] that amen had commanded unto the king's
[10:29] lieutenants and to the governors that
[10:31] were over every Province and the rulers
[10:33] of every people and every Province
[10:35] according to the writing day off and
[10:37] every people after the language in the
[10:40] name of King aesurus was it written
[10:42] sealed with the king's ring
[10:44] amen and the letters were sent by post
[10:47] into the king's provinces to destroy to
[10:49] kill and to cause to pray perish all
[10:52] Jews both young and old
[10:54] little children and women in one day
[10:56] even upon the 13th day of the 12th month
[11:02] amen
[11:03] which is the month of Da and to take the
[11:06] spoil of them for a prayer the copy of
[11:09] the writing for a commandment to be
[11:11] given to in every Province was published
[11:13] unto all people that they should be
[11:16] ready against that day the post went out
[11:18] being Asian by the king's commandment
[11:20] and the key was given in shusha and the
[11:23] palace
[11:24] and the king and amen amen sat down to
[11:27] drink but the city's shushan was
[11:29] perplexed then we'll go to Esther for
[11:31] eight so that was the beginning of the
[11:33] decree being sent
[11:36] amen
[11:38] we'll go to Esther chapter 8 verse 5.
[11:42] year now after Esther
[11:45] and Mordecai uncover even scheme and
[11:48] amen is dealt with we come to the queen
[11:51] of Queens
[11:53] Esther
[11:54] and she comes before the king remember
[11:56] she asked him the king asked her what is
[11:59] that desire what is that request even to
[12:00] ask the Kingdom so she says if you
[12:02] please the king and if I found favor in
[12:05] his sight
[12:06] and the thing seemed right before The
[12:08] King and I be pleasing in his eyes Let
[12:11] It Be written
[12:12] to reverse the letters devised by aim
[12:15] and the son of him a doctor the agatype
[12:18] which he wrote to destroy the Jews which
[12:21] are in all the king's provinces
[12:24] but you know what the king says now
[12:25] because this is law
[12:27] for How Can I Endure to see evil that
[12:29] shall come upon my people or How Can I
[12:31] Endure to see destruction of my Kindred
[12:33] then the king asari said unto Esther the
[12:36] queen and to Mordechai the Jew behold I
[12:39] have given Esther the house of Amen in
[12:41] the King's house
[12:43] and let him
[12:46] and him have they hanged upon the
[12:48] Gallows because he had his hand upon the
[12:51] Jews
[12:52] right he also
[12:54] for the Jews
[12:57] as it like with you
[12:59] amen amen I can't change my law
[13:04] you rewrite it
[13:10] amen hope you're getting it right to you
[13:13] also for the Jews as it liked you in the
[13:15] king's name
[13:17] and seal it with the king's ring
[13:20] for the writing which is written in the
[13:22] king's name and filled with the king's
[13:24] Ring May no man reverse
[13:28] amen may the Lord a blessing to the
[13:30] meaning of his word you may be seated
[13:32] so I can see you got the inspiration
[13:34] already if you say

[13:49] when there would be a persecution come
[13:51] upon the Jews
[13:53] and you have been called in the same
[13:55] time
[13:56] the Lord could have put Paul in this day
[13:58] he could have pulled all other seven
[14:00] churches messages he could have even
[14:02] preserved for the Branham to be alive in
[14:04] this time at the coming of the Lord

[14:56] though he ruled 127 provinces
[14:59] amen but he is not King of Kings

[16:15] been living in fear

[16:29] alive in this time and that your faith
[16:31] is with an happiness hour

[16:49] verse 39 just to show you this amen and
[16:52] show you some background when Joseph was
[16:55] written up notice now every time the
[16:58] king gives his ring the person is rising
[17:00] from a great trial
[17:03] a great test
[17:05] Joseph is thrown from it the highest
[17:08] position in his father's mind he had him
[17:11] as his favorite son is thrown into the
[17:12] lowest position of the pit

[18:11] because of that
[18:13] not from the prison house
[18:15] the King has a need
[18:17] to interpret a dream
[18:19] and then the Lord set him back all the
[18:22] way back then that he was seeing dreams

[28:58] the beginning of all things

[29:06] forbidded me that I should give the
[29:08] inheritance to my fathers and today and
[29:11] they have came into his house heavy and
[29:13] this please because the word which
[29:15] neighbor the jezreeland had spoken to

[30:14] sons of Bilal before him to Bear witness
[30:16] against him
[30:17] and say thou just blaspheme God and the
[30:20] king and then carry him out and stone
[30:21] him that he may die
[30:24] and the men of the city even the elders
[30:26] and Nobles which were inhabitants in the
[30:28] city did as Jezebel at the same time to
[30:30] them and as it was written in lit in the
[30:33] letters which he had sent unto them
[30:35] amen so they go and they fulfill these
[30:37] things they bring a false accusation

[35:16] gone away or does it still stand as a
[35:19] declaration even today amen the Bible
[35:21] says neither tonight the attitude speech
[35:23] amen here today they give glory to the
[35:26] Lord amen so that first Bible is still
[35:28] in existence yes amen amen didn't he
[35:31] write his second Bible there in the
[35:32] pyramid amen hallelujah what's laying
[35:35] next to the pyramid there's a figure
[35:37] there where the lion body and a virgin

[35:42] they call it the springs they don't know
[35:43] what it is I am telling you what it is
[35:45] it's a sign God wrote his Bible there
[35:49] stops with the Virgin and it ends with a
[35:51] lion
[35:52] amen hallelujah the prophet told us God
[35:56] wrote his Bible in the pyramids even the
[35:58] flat couldn't destroy that word amen
[36:00] because it's God's word even today amen
[36:03] it stands for The Monuments amen so if
[36:05] God brought it in the heavens and it
[36:07] still stands God wrote it in the pyramid
[36:09] the pyramid still stands how many years
[36:11] have gone by 6 000 years look at any
[36:14] other building amen that has been able
[36:16] to stand that fossils of nature stand
[36:19] Wars amen which stand was amen but it's
[36:22] God's word and evidence Earth will pass
[36:24] away but his word will never pass away
[36:27] hallelujah how about the written word
[36:30] yes amen amen hallelujah we have the
[36:34] written word in the form of the Bible
[36:35] amen 66 books amen written by different
[36:39] authors but none of them contradict one
[36:41] another brutally in different times
[36:43] different seasons but it never gets old
[36:45] it never gets stale the power leads in
[36:48] the world when the power of the amen the
[36:51] scriptures applied in the lips of faith
[36:53] will produce the results amen amen take
[36:55] the word and apply the word by faith
[36:59] yes sir thank you amen amen hallelujah
[37:03] blessed be the name of the Lord that
[37:06] never could tell us right division yeah
[37:09] Hallelujah don't you speak it yes write
[37:12] it because you're a queen yes amen
[37:15] amen thank you Lord Make It law amen
[37:18] hallelujah
[37:20] oh Hallelujah and you've got to teach
[37:22] your children and your children's
[37:24] children amen ask yourself now and if
[37:27] you went to law school to study the laws
[37:29] of the land
[37:30] but yet there are laws in the country
[37:32] who taught you the laws
[37:35] do they send the children to school to
[37:37] learn the laws of the Lamb I don't know
[37:39] of anyone that went to school to learn
[37:40] the laws of the land
[37:42] but they learn from people their parents
[37:45] we're not allowed to do this the speed
[37:47] limit is this this is that this this
[37:49] this this
[37:51] amen who teaches them
[37:55] besides lawyers I don't know anyone else
[37:57] who knows all the laws of the land
[38:01] you know all the laws of the land
[38:05] even the ones you disagree with they
[38:07] take it from you
[38:11] Lord
[38:13] pay
[38:15] amen hallelujah
[38:19] amen
[38:20] but application
[38:22] of the word is important
[38:25] saying it correctly is important right
[38:28] reciting something correctly is
[38:30] important to get the results now when
[38:34] we're saying the revelation of the world
[38:35] is important you can quote the word and
[38:37] it has no effect
[38:41] amen you can quote the word without
[38:43] Revelation where you can quote the word
[38:46] without faith because faith is a
[38:47] revelation right
[38:49] and a person can quote the word for many
[38:52] years
[38:53] for 40 years they can quote the word
[38:56] and be in the wilderness condition
[38:59] why they are not seeing the evidence of
[39:01] the word living in them hey amen
[39:04] right for example
[39:07] Millions can I see millions of churches
[39:10] quoting Matthew 28 19. yeah preach the
[39:14] gospel teach them to baptize in the name
[39:16] of the father and of the son and of the
[39:19] Holy Spirit
[39:20] now they have converts
[39:22] they even have churches amen
[39:27] but that is not the Revelation yes
[39:31] is that the revelation
[39:35] but we know that the holy spirit will
[39:37] bring things our remembrance and teach
[39:39] us all things so when the Holy Ghost
[39:41] pours out on the day of Pentecost he
[39:43] reveals to Peter the Revelation that the
[39:46] name of the father and of the son and of
[39:48] the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:50] and it's the correct formula to be
[39:52] baptized in amen
[39:56] amen
[39:57] I hope you're learning brother Renault
[39:59] amen
[40:01] Acts 2 38 Pete on the day of Pentecost
[40:04] filled with the Holy Ghost says repent
[40:06] and be baptized in the name yes amen of
[40:10] Jesus Christ amen for the remission of
[40:12] your sins
[40:14] so it's important to have the revelation
[40:16] of what Jesus said yes amen isn't it the
[40:19] same with the godhead amen you have a
[40:22] trinitarian thought of the godhead maybe
[40:24] a tune is thought a Oneness thought
[40:26] extra Etc but the holy spirit in this
[40:29] time
[40:30] has come to give us a correct
[40:31] interpretation of the godhead which is
[40:34] it the condescension of the one true God
[40:36] yes now he came from Spirit to word to
[40:39] flesh amen and the Holy Spirit again is
[40:43] now forming himself in a many-membered
[40:46] body
[40:49] amen that's what Christ the mystery is
[40:52] all about now remember he came from
[40:54] Spirit
[40:55] then he became theophany word Manchester
[41:00] then he became flesh Jesus
[41:03] he ascended on high
[41:06] where is he now son of God
[41:09] Son of God Ministry what is Son of God
[41:11] Ministry Holy Spirit in a people
[41:14] God in the people no longer God above us
[41:17] no longer god with us but now God in us
[41:22] amen
[41:24] now to many of you that may sound like
[41:26] you know that but that's a mystery to
[41:28] people
[41:31] that's one of the mystery truths that's
[41:33] been revealed to us amen
[41:34] amen and right now we are poking Satan
[41:36] in his remember we read those quotes
[41:38] last week we are punishing him every
[41:41] time he hears the Revelation the true
[41:42] Revelation he's getting punched he's
[41:44] getting beaten yeah
[41:46] amen hallelujah
[41:48] amen amen amen amen hallelujah turn to
[41:52] your neighbor telling Jesus Is God
[41:54] I wish you could see saved now you got a
[41:57] blue eye with that
[42:00] okay
[42:02] amen so the same applies
[42:05] with prayer
[42:07] a lot of people are praying same
[42:09] principle applies but there's a reason
[42:11] why the law details The Lord's Prayer in
[42:13] that way
[42:16] amen it's a guideline for us when we
[42:18] pray and approach the Lord to pray
[42:21] amen and you know many times Jesus said
[42:23] when you pray
[42:25] so there's a reason why the Lord
[42:28] has asked you to do that he says because
[42:29] there's a promise attached to it right
[42:32] and then you shall receive what you have
[42:34] asked for so praying is what making your
[42:38] supplications known to the Lord amen
[42:40] it's making your request communicating
[42:42] right
[42:47] so we're coming now to a time where laws
[42:49] have been Rewritten in the land
[42:53] laws are changing
[42:54] [Music]
[42:55] we're in another sort of condition yes
[42:58] that has now become legalized
[43:01] it's the even though it's a minority
[43:03] population and a minority group
[43:06] they have exalted it
[43:09] it's become the number one priority for
[43:11] leading Nations to Advocate and they
[43:13] call it humans rights but it's another
[43:15] solemn sign amen amen amen Luke 17. even
[43:20] as it was in the days of lot so shall it
[43:23] be yes the coming of the son of man so
[43:26] when you see all of them frauding their
[43:27] rights their lesbian the gay rights they
[43:30] transgender rights it's a sign of the
[43:32] end yes amen hallelujah
[43:35] amen amen and I'm gonna say it plainly
[43:37] amen so that everybody understands it's
[43:40] not the natural order for boys to like
[43:43] boys girls to like girls
[43:46] lives
[43:49] God created man and a woman God's
[43:53] institution is a man will marry a wife
[43:57] a man can't marry a man and a woman
[43:59] can't marry a woman yes amen the schools
[44:02] may tell you it's okay but God's word is
[44:04] against it amen they are going against
[44:07] God's law God's nature
[44:09] and men are becoming so perverted they
[44:12] put up women all this time since the 60s
[44:14] to give their moments rights women's
[44:16] Liberation they put them up and set them
[44:18] up not the same man goes and says I
[44:21] identify as a woman so he gets all the
[44:23] women's rights
[44:25] foreign
[44:28] they believe them
[44:30] now they're competing in their races
[44:32] they are setting new records this thing
[44:35] has gone crazy in the U.S
[44:37] they are setting new records breaking
[44:40] records now they are so perverted
[44:42] because they're only acting like they
[44:45] transgender
[44:47] so this one guy says
[44:49] I'm transgender I'm a man biologically
[44:52] is a man but now he's identifying as a
[44:55] woman
[44:56] so now he's saying in my position
[44:58] because he wants to lie with a woman
[45:00] he's saying I'm a lesbian woman
[45:06] but you see how corrupted there
[45:08] he still wants to be a woman
[45:10] or sorry to be with a woman
[45:13] but in order to attain all the rights
[45:16] and all the Privileges he's identifying
[45:18] as a transgender
[45:20] saying is a woman but then now you say
[45:22] no I want to be with another woman I'm a
[45:25] lesbian woman okay
[45:26] corruption corruption
[45:29] people are going crazy doesn't the
[45:32] prophet prophesy they'll come a time
[45:34] neurotics on the air yes gone insane
[45:36] totally insane why you think he wants
[45:38] you to get out of the mall the other day
[45:40] yeah
[45:41] he said I saw hell back on the Earth

[49:38] so don't think that Revelation 6 8 all
[49:40] evidence turned loose hear what he says
[49:42] now all Heaven has turned loose
[49:47] if all hell is on the Earth
[49:49] Heaven is on the earth combating them
[49:54] yes and it's prophesied that to be a
[49:56] Janice and generous on the earth in the
[49:58] last days wouldn't almost impersonate
[50:00] the real thing so close it'll deceive

[50:05] somebody ought to praise the Lord right
[50:06] there say thank you Lord that I cannot
[50:08] be deceived yes Lord amen not will not I
[50:12] cannot be deceived amen
[50:14] amen
[50:16] amen
[50:19] he says in Christ the mystery coming to
[50:22] an individual Revelation now
[50:24] God didn't say to Peter
[50:27] upon all of you are doing my church
[50:30] it's upon the one that has the
[50:31] Revelation Upon This Rock Thou Art Peter
[50:34] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[50:37] church so he says it's an individual one
[50:40] person all hell is against this teaching
[50:42] and all that is against this truth but
[50:45] it is the truth amen you are packing the
[50:48] message of the hour you are packing the
[50:50] truth of the day amen and all hell is
[50:52] against your Revelation yes that's right
[50:55] that's right amen
[50:58] amen
[50:59] amen thank you Lord and that's the
[51:02] mystery people may think hey you ain't
[51:04] significant somebody but yeah he says
[51:06] his Mysteries only revealed to his
[51:08] beloved bride that's the only one could
[51:11] see it
[51:14] amen that's right you can speak from now
[51:16] until Kingdom Come talking to some
[51:18] people yeah and they will never see it
[51:20] that's correct there is no seed there um
[51:25] right
[51:26] Hallelujah
[51:31] he says Flesh and Blood never reveal it
[51:34] to you but upon this Revelation call
[51:36] that group I'll build my church in them
[51:39] and all the gates of hell will never be
[51:41] able to withstand it
[51:43] there's nothing you're going through in
[51:45] this life
[51:47] that Satan can withstand you
[51:51] Satan cannot withstand when you speak
[51:54] yes
[51:56] yes the reason why you are living with a
[51:59] condition you are living with that
[52:01] problem
[52:02] Jesus even said
[52:04] sometimes you pray but you pray a miss
[52:08] you're praying presumptuously you are
[52:10] praying in Hope
[52:12] but when you pray by faith amen when you
[52:15] speak by faith there is nothing can
[52:18] stand before you amen thank you Lord
[52:21] amen
[52:25] Hallelujah Blessed Be His holy name amen
[52:28] amen let's progress to thought now amen
[52:31] so here we are with Esther
[52:35] you know what happened
[52:37] amen
[52:38] divides the plan to kill all the Jews in
[52:40] one day
[52:41] right
[52:44] then bordecai finds out about it because
[52:46] the letters are being sent Mordecai gets
[52:49] one of the letters
[52:50] but Esther
[52:51] is unaware
[52:55] remember trials and tribulations
[52:58] what we said now will raise you to your
[53:00] position
[53:02] the testing will raise you to your ought
[53:04] to be conditioned
[53:05] it's meant to push you it's meant to
[53:08] perf you
[53:10] that's what happened to Joseph all of
[53:12] his trials worth of him to their
[53:15] position all of Daniel's trials brought
[53:18] him to that position yes now the same
[53:20] thing is going to happen to Esther
[53:22] amen
[53:24] she is now sitting here as Queen
[53:28] she's the married wife
[53:30] but she's living in the Kingdom without
[53:33] any Authority
[53:34] she doesn't know that she can speak she
[53:37] doesn't know Authority as Queen
[53:40] oh thank you Lord
[53:42] so for many years she served there
[53:46] not knowing a position
[53:49] until there was one Branham that spoke
[53:51] to us amen and said who knows you have
[53:54] been put into the kingdom for such a
[53:56] time as this amen let's go to uh
[54:00] now remember we preached this the last
[54:02] time
[54:03] number four is the number of Deliverance
[54:05] so Deliverance is coming in the fourth
[54:07] chapter of Esther amen amen
[54:10] read the last verse there
[54:14] maybe one before this
[54:18] just before this way he says Deliverance
[54:20] will come from another place
[54:21] I think it's a verse before this where
[54:24] you're speaking to him
[54:26] amen yeah
[54:29] if they're all together old is thy peace
[54:31] at this time
[54:33] this shell and and
[54:34] their child and enlargement and
[54:36] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[54:39] another place
[54:41] but thou and their father's house shall
[54:43] be destroyed and who knoweth whether
[54:45] Thou Art coming to a King into the
[54:46] kingdom for such a time as this but look
[54:49] at Mordecai's Revelation yes Mordecai
[54:51] knows that these people are at the
[54:54] Abraham's Covenant yeah
[54:56] that nobody can destroy them
[54:59] he's saying if you don't raise up to
[55:00] your position
[55:01] deliberate is going to arise from
[55:04] another place
[55:05] yes if you are not the people that's
[55:07] going to rise up to your position God's
[55:10] Gonna raise up a people yeah
[55:14] don't think God because it's written in
[55:17] his word
[55:18] once he writes it he can't change it
[55:21] it's written that Abraham's people have
[55:23] blessed people
[55:25] that they can never be destroyed God may
[55:27] put you to trials through situation
[55:30] because of unbelief because of
[55:32] circumstances amen God May throw you to
[55:34] the Babylonians God may put you to
[55:36] trials amen but God's purpose will not
[55:39] be defeated amen
[55:41] amen
[55:42] amen so Deliverance will arise from
[55:44] another place if the messages shall not
[55:46] raise up to the standard and recognize
[55:49] the position
[55:52] but we thank God preaching like this
[55:54] preaching like that made us go away
[55:57] yes yes you are right Mordecai yes you
[56:00] are right brother Branham we are the
[56:01] people amen for too long I've been
[56:03] reading it there as a future prophecy
[56:05] but we are the super church we are aim
[56:08] and the Invincible Army for too long
[56:10] she's been an invisible Army amen
[56:13] amen for too long the message people
[56:14] have been an invisible Army but right
[56:16] now we are raising up to be an
[56:18] invincible army yes amen
[56:21] thank you Lord amen Jesus blessed be the
[56:24] name of the Lord hallelujah amen
[56:31] so we find amen now watch I need to
[56:34] detail this but I'm not going to read it
[56:35] because it'll take too long to read but
[56:37] maybe I can frame it in a few minutes
[56:41] Eamonn scheme is exposed
[56:44] right you know she calls him to the
[56:46] banquet of wines you know what the
[56:48] banquet of wine is it's a simulation of
[56:50] Revelation now he's highly revelated so
[56:52] she invites him to the banquet of wine
[56:55] amen all seven seals are open to her
[56:58] the banquet of wines
[57:00] she is living under the stimulation of
[57:02] Revelation
[57:03] what did the seals reveal did leave your
[57:06] Satan unveiled Satan schemes he's
[57:08] brought to kill to destroy
[57:11] how you went from deception to the Palos
[57:13] yes so that's what he did now it
[57:16] unveiled Satan's schemes
[57:18] then she the king is unaware of this
[57:21] because remember
[57:23] Eamon was a prince
[57:27] and he wrote These decrees and laws
[57:29] because the king gave him the Signet and
[57:31] the ring
[57:32] and this guy when wrote his laws
[57:37] we find amen is now killed
[57:41] he's hanging on the Gallows
[57:43] pay attention I'm closing
[57:46] this is the allergy
[57:48] is
[57:49] hung on the Gallows and he prepared for
[57:51] monicaiah so animal is dead
[57:56] but what about the decree
[58:01] it's now months later
[58:05] but a die is still coming
[58:07] the day of death and destruction
[58:11] because what did we say
[58:13] nothing can stop the Great Tribulation
[58:16] that's what I'm getting to right it's
[58:19] already been written
[58:21] no matter how much they fast and pray
[58:24] you can't do nothing about it it's
[58:26] already written
[58:30] so even though amen is there
[58:33] is and now in fellowship with the King
[58:38] but the day is fast approach him
[58:42] the day is fast approaching
[58:44] when death and destruction is coming
[58:51] amen Esther getting the king to kill
[58:54] amen didn't change the law
[58:57] didn't change the circumstance
[59:00] that was not the Deliverance
[59:03] how many of you really followed what the
[59:05] True Deliverance was
[59:08] have we progressed so far into the story
[59:10] to see where Deliverance came from
[59:13] who delivered the Jews
[59:19] I think most time it's preached it stops
[59:21] it
[59:24] you follow me
[59:27] how would the laws change
[59:29] it couldn't be changed
[59:34] amen it couldn't be changed
[59:37] even though Eamon was dead there was
[59:39] still an army raising up
[59:42] to slaughter on their day
[59:48] even though she pleads with the King
[59:50] the king suggests
[59:52] why did you write take my ring I can't
[59:55] change my own word
[59:57] amen amen hallelujah God cannot read
[1:00:02] write end-time prophecies what he wrote
[1:00:04] must come to pass his word will not
[1:00:06] change
[1:00:06] amen hallelujah amen Satan and his army
[1:00:10] are now preparing to come against the
[1:00:12] people of God and will make a final move
[1:00:14] against the wife of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:16] Christ
[1:00:17] so what must we do amen hallelujah
[1:00:21] we need to form an offensive yeah yes
[1:00:24] amen because the day is coming
[1:00:28] you and daily battles
[1:00:30] you think you're backsliding because of
[1:00:32] your own backsliding Satan is causing
[1:00:34] you to backslide
