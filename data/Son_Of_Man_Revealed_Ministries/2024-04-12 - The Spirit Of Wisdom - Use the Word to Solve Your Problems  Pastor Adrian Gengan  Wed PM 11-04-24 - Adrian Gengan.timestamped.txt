[0:36] amen so we'll pray that the Lord will
[0:39] amen touch them amen hallelujah
[0:43] amen let's turn to our Bibles Ephesians
[0:46] chapter 1 we'll read from verse
[0:49] 17 161 17 somewhere around there
[1:05] amen praise the
[1:08] Lord okay let's read from verse 15 it
[1:10] says wherefore I also after I heard of
[1:15] your faith in the Lord Jesus and love
[1:19] unto all the saints cease not to give
[1:21] thanks for you making mention of you in
[1:24] my prayers that the god of our Lord
[1:27] Jesus Christ the father of Glory
[1:30] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:34] and Revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:37] amen the eyes of your understanding
[1:39] being enlightened that you may know what
[1:41] is the hope of his calling and what the
[1:44] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:47] in the Saints amen you may be seated
[1:49] praise the
[1:53] Lord amen so the spirit of wisdom has
[1:58] come in this time
[2:01] amen amen the spirit of wisdom has come
[2:05] amen amen it's come to help us in the
[2:08] place of our
[2:10] trying amen the bride is fixing to go
[2:13] through a greatest
[2:15] trial a greatest
[2:17] test amen praise the Lord you remember
[2:20] the prophet is teaching us the word is
[2:23] in the bride if you type the code up you
[2:25] can find it amen it says as it was in
[2:27] Mary the word is in the bride amen amen
[2:32] now a lot of message people walking the
[2:34] face of the Earth we don't dispute them
[2:37] that the word is in
[2:39] them but what we need to look for is the
[2:42] word quickened in
[2:44] them amen the word must become quickened
[2:47] amen that is what we are talking about
[2:49] the Dynamics coming upon the word which
[2:52] is the holy spirit here to Quicken the
[2:54] word in us now when we are going through
[2:57] trials and testings and the enemy is
[2:59] surrounding us we have a choice to
[3:02] handle it with the five senses we can
[3:04] either go carnal amen or we can choose
[3:07] to handle it with the word of God
[3:09] Amen and when the word of God is Quicken
[3:12] to us that is
[3:15] wisdom Amen to apply the word of God
[3:18] Amen wisdom to apply the word of God
[3:21] Amen so you can now use the word to
[3:24] overcome our problems our trials and our
[3:28] situations amen so the word becomes aive
[3:30] to us amen hallelujah we don't just
[3:34] rejoice in the revelations of it but we
[3:36] are using the word in our daily lives to
[3:40] overcome amen now most Christians have
[3:43] not come to that place yet because they
[3:46] don't know what to do with the
[3:48] word no application of the word St this
[3:52] St come Panic fear anxiety worry
[3:56] depression amen don't know how to use
[4:00] the
[4:00] word but the the the prophecy over us is
[4:03] the Bride As the mind of Christ she
[4:05] knows what to do with the word amen amen
[4:09] she knows how to apply the word yes amen
[4:12] so the moment we find ourselves in
[4:14] anxiety in tension in stress amen
[4:16] getting depressed that is US showing
[4:19] that we are not spiritually mature yet
[4:22] we may have the word in us but we don't
[4:24] know how to use the
[4:26] word amen so we can use the word to over
[4:29] overcome our situations amen word inside
[4:32] people amen but when they face
[4:34] situations they don't know how to use
[4:36] the word when they face Temptation they
[4:38] fall because there is no present tense
[4:41] reality the word is not alive Amen to
[4:44] tell them what to do they got no guide
[4:48] they got no teacher they got no Spirit
[4:50] of Truth amen hallelujah so having the
[4:54] word is one thing but you need the guide
[4:56] you need the teacher you need the spirit
[4:58] of Truth amen to come and Quicken that
[5:01] word to show you what to do with the
[5:03] word amen now the word can be in you but
[5:06] you need the intelligence amen
[5:09] hallelujah we know the holy spirit is
[5:11] the intelligence come to Quicken that
[5:12] word amen so we find out when we
[5:16] speaking on Sunday on changing positions
[5:19] and we find Jesus was walking on the
[5:21] earth for 30
[5:23] years and everybody knew him as a son of
[5:26] Joseph son of Joseph son of Mary
[5:31] but God was going to change his position
[5:33] when he came to the Jordan River that
[5:35] day amen God changed his position he God
[5:39] changed his title because the voice that
[5:41] came out of Heaven said this is my
[5:43] beloved Son amen changing his position
[5:47] from Earthly Joseph that's who they
[5:49] thought his father was but he came to
[5:51] give him his
[5:53] identity amen amen he changed Jesus
[5:57] position to a Heavenly Place position
[6:00] to let him know he's not the son of the
[6:02] earth amen amen he's the son of
[6:06] God so remember the Bible says
[6:10] immediately after the baptism the spirit
[6:14] led him into the Wilderness for a place
[6:16] of trying for a place of testing yes
[6:19] amen amen he needs he needs to be tried
[6:22] because when you have the word in you
[6:24] you are going to go to a test oh yes yes
[6:28] amen
[6:30] God will try your
[6:32] faith to see if you're a mature son if
[6:35] you're a born son if you're a trained
[6:37] son or will you just Buckle under the
[6:39] pressure so Jesus was tempted went into
[6:42] the Wilderness but the Holy Spirit was
[6:45] there the Bible says that the Holy
[6:46] Spirit led him into the Wilderness
[6:50] amen now you may be thinking the Holy
[6:53] Spirit was not with him the Bible says
[6:55] the fullness of the God dwells in Jesus
[6:56] bodily amen so father Son and Holy
[6:59] Spirit was locked up in Jesus amen so he
[7:02] was being led by the guide he was being
[7:05] led by the spirit of truth and the
[7:07] spirit of Truth told him what to do with
[7:09] the word so every time Satan counted him
[7:12] and Satan went to the word but remember
[7:15] the Temptation was not for him to turn
[7:17] Stone into bread that's what it seems
[7:20] like but what Satan was really attacking
[7:23] is a revelation of what he heard at the
[7:26] Jordan that you are the Son of God Amen
[7:29] oh yes he was there to test him to see
[7:32] if this was truly the Son of God Wonder
[7:34] amen because if you were really an
[7:37] adopted son if you're really the Adam
[7:39] man on the earth Turning Stone into
[7:41] bread is nothing he was there to make
[7:43] him doubt that he was the son of God yes
[7:46] he was there to make him doubt his
[7:48] position and that's what Satan will come
[7:50] to make you do doubt your position thank
[7:53] you Lord thank you Jesus so Jesus goes
[7:56] to the word to reestablish his position
[7:59] you shall not tempt the Lord your God
[8:01] Amen Hallelujah so you can find that
[8:04] example of testing in Matthew chapter 4
[8:07] amen now just to dwell on the scripture
[8:09] for a short time Ephesians 1:1 17 the
[8:13] god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father
[8:15] of Glory may give unto you
[8:19] gold
[8:20] silver this is what Paul is praying for
[8:22] the Ephesians now I pray that the Lord
[8:25] will bless you
[8:27] abundantly I pray amen that the Lord
[8:30] will bless you in all things in diamonds
[8:33] not forgetting a million
[8:36] Rand but the Apostle is saying I do not
[8:39] stop praying giving thanks for
[8:41] you that the god of our Lord Jesus
[8:44] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[8:47] you blessings and good
[8:53] health good jobs best jobs in
[8:57] deran what is he praying for the spirit
[9:01] of
[9:05] wisdom you need wisdom more than
[9:07] anything else amen hallelujah amen
[9:11] because wisdom can go to work for you
[9:14] wisdom is the word
[9:15] applied wisdom is the problem
[9:18] solver so he's asking for the spirit of
[9:21] wisdom who is he asking it for a mature
[9:24] Church a church who's in the land amen
[9:28] yes amen hallelujah praise the
[9:31] Lord so what is wisdom when a person
[9:34] reads the Bible we know that we are
[9:36] getting
[9:37] knowledge but knowledge is not good
[9:39] enough anyone can read the Bible and
[9:41] attain knowledge but the word does not
[9:44] make that knowledge of the word does not
[9:47] make us
[9:50] successful does Knowledge from the Bible
[9:53] give us
[9:54] Victory
[9:56] no knowledge is only showing us the
[9:59] theory part that's where many people die
[10:02] in the schools of denomination in the
[10:05] schools amen Bible Colleges and Schools
[10:08] and
[10:09] seminaries but Hebrews 4:2 let's put it
[10:13] up brother amen Hebrews 4:2 teaches us
[10:16] how to handle the word amen amen praise
[10:20] the Lord amen tonight might be a little
[10:23] practically practical look at the word
[10:26] to show us how to operate the word amen
[10:29] amen amen Hebrews 4 and2 For unto us was
[10:32] the Gospel
[10:34] preached as well as unto them so the
[10:36] gospel is going into all the world but
[10:39] the word preached did not profit
[10:42] them so not everyone hearing the word
[10:45] having the luxury of hearing the word
[10:47] does it profit them why yes why not
[10:51] being mixed with faith in them that
[10:54] heard
[10:56] it so hearing the word is one thing but
[10:59] you've got to mix it with faith amen
[11:02] amen hallelujah thank you Lord you got
[11:04] to Quicken it with faith amen because
[11:07] Faith cometh by the hearing of the word
[11:09] mix it with faith amen one more
[11:11] scripture there James 1 and 22 says
[11:15] James 1
[11:16] and22 but be doers of the
[11:20] word and not hearers
[11:25] only if you only hear the word what are
[11:28] you doing
[11:30] you are in
[11:31] deception we come to church week after
[11:34] week we say I love to hear the
[11:36] word deceiving
[11:39] ourselves but be doers of the word what
[11:42] is he saying use the word for wisdom and
[11:45] apply it in your life amen hallelujah
[11:48] amen amen so we must be doers of the
[11:50] word not just hearers the word must be
[11:52] put into action and we can only put the
[11:55] word into action when it becomes a
[11:57] revelation to us amen
[11:59] you'll never be excited about anything
[12:01] unless it becomes a revelation to you
[12:04] amen praise the Lord
[12:06] am thank you
[12:08] Jesus so when we use the revealed word
[12:11] now what is wisdom we're answering the
[12:13] question what is wisdom this is wisdom
[12:15] when we use the revealed word with
[12:17] understanding in our trials in our place
[12:20] of testing to solve every problem that
[12:23] is wisdom amen that is spiritual
[12:27] wisdom now throughout the message you'll
[12:30] find the prophet speak against wisdom
[12:34] but he's talking about worldly wisdom is
[12:37] not talking about spiritual wisdom so
[12:39] don't get it mixed up when you're
[12:40] reading the prophet's message and he's
[12:43] talking about wisdom he's talking about
[12:45] people who have no revelation of the
[12:47] word they're quoting according to their
[12:50] teachings he's calling that
[12:52] wisdom amen praise the Lord but the
[12:55] Bible is saying the Apostle Paul is
[12:56] saying I want you to have spiritual
[13:00] wisdom amen praise the
[13:04] Lord so every problem we can deduce from
[13:07] there that every problem in our life
[13:09] requires
[13:11] wisdom the problem the the solving the
[13:14] thing the solution for every problem is
[13:17] wisdom amen let's read First Kings
[13:19] chapter
[13:21] 3 First Kings chapter 3 praise the
[13:25] Lord
[13:28] amen
[13:31] First Kings 3:5 yeah the Lord sets up
[13:34] Solomon as
[13:36] king and the Lord the Lord meets Solomon
[13:39] here you'll find in gibian the Lord
[13:42] appeared to Solomon in a Dream by night
[13:44] and God said ask what I shall give
[13:49] thee how many if you want God to ask you
[13:51] what do you
[13:53] want right now if we could ask you what
[13:57] do you want amen
[13:59] don't go carnal now learn from Solomon
[14:03] wisest
[14:04] man watch what he asked
[14:06] for and Solomon said thou has showed
[14:09] unto thy servant David my father great
[14:11] Mercy according as he had walked before
[14:14] thee in truth and in righteousness and
[14:16] in uprightness of heart with thee and
[14:18] thou has
[14:19] kept for him this great kindness that
[14:22] thou has given him a son to sit upon his
[14:25] throne as it is this day and now oh Lord
[14:28] my God thou has made thy servant King
[14:30] instead of David my father and I am but
[14:33] a little child I know not how to go out
[14:36] or come in and thy servant is in the
[14:39] midst of thy people which thou has
[14:41] chosen a great people that cannot be
[14:43] numbered nor counted for multitude give
[14:46] therefore thy servant an understanding
[14:48] heart to judge thy people so he's asking
[14:51] the Lord for wisdom here
[14:57] right that I may discern between good
[14:59] and bad for who is able to judge this
[15:02] thy so great a people and the speech
[15:05] pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked
[15:08] this thing amen
[15:11] amen so when you're praying for a job
[15:14] pray for wisdom
[15:17] amen you're praying for anything in life
[15:19] pray for wisdom
[15:25] amen and God said unto him because thou
[15:28] was asked this
[15:30] thing and has not asked for thyself long
[15:32] life neither has asked for riches for
[15:36] thyself so don't keep going Lord bless
[15:38] me bless me bless
[15:42] me nor as I ask the life of thine
[15:47] enemies but has asked for thyself
[15:50] understanding to discern judgment amen
[15:52] here's the blessing Now Behold I have
[15:54] done according to thy words yes lo I
[15:59] given thee a wise and understanding
[16:01] heart so that there was none like thee
[16:04] before thee neither after thee shall
[16:07] arise
[16:08] any shall arise shall any arise like
[16:12] unto thee but I have also given thee
[16:15] that which
[16:16] thou Hast not asked both
[16:19] riches and honor so that they shall not
[16:24] be any among the Kings like unto thee
[16:27] all thy days amen so what must we ask
[16:31] for
[16:33] wisdom amen praise the Lord if we are
[16:36] seeking a job if we have wisdom wisdom
[16:39] will give us a solution if we lack
[16:41] finances wisdom will provide the answer
[16:44] for it if we have uh sick in body wisdom
[16:48] of the word will teach us how to apply
[16:50] the word by faith
[16:52] amen the prophet says if you have need
[16:54] of healing think on those scriptures
[16:56] that pertain to Healing Hallelujah if
[16:58] you have need of any a thing he says
[16:59] think on scriptures that pertain to
[17:02] that so use the word as
[17:06] wisdom people think oh the word is
[17:08] boring the word is nuggets the word is a
[17:12] solution
[17:14] amen
[17:15] hallelujah amen so in James 1 and3 now
[17:20] James 1
[17:24] and3 amen let's read that James chap
[17:27] 1:3 amen am I pray this is okay tonight

[17:41] and hallelujah amen because now we are
[17:45] training some soldiers here yes amen and
[17:48] you know he's going to get a
[17:52] hiding praise the
[17:55] Lord verse two my brothers counted all
[17:58] joy
[17:59] what is
[18:00] joy joy is knowing the end
[18:04] result
[18:06] amen Joy is knowing the end result
[18:08] that's why you en Joy you can't be
[18:11] joyful if you're in worry and doubt and
[18:12] wondering what's going to be the end
[18:14] result Joy is knowing the end result
[18:17] amen for the joy that was set before him
[18:19] he endured the cross am oh
[18:23] yes
[18:25] amen if you are going through a trial in
[18:27] a situation and you can't see the end
[18:30] result you're not going to be joyful yes
[18:32] you're going to be in worry but faith
[18:34] will make you see the expected End Amen
[18:37] how it's going to end up and you will be
[18:38] joyful knowing that that's how you
[18:40] that's the place you're going to reach
[18:42] amen so he's saying my brethren count it
[18:45] all joy when you fall into diverse
[18:47] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[18:50] of your faith worketh patience here it
[18:52] is now amen here it
[18:56] is Faith covered by the hearing of the
[19:00] word but now when you receive that
[19:03] Faith God's going to try that faith in
[19:08] order to add a
[19:11] virtue
[19:13] yes yes amen that the trying of your
[19:16] faith worketh
[19:19] patience Hallelujah am how are you going
[19:23] to get patience the trying of your faith
[19:26] amen praise the Lord but let patience
[19:30] now patience remember Faith must be
[19:34] tried When Faith is tried it worketh
[19:36] patience but if you you got to remain in
[19:39] patience because patience has a work to
[19:42] do
[19:43] yes if we if we step into
[19:48] impatience Faith can't do that work the
[19:51] final work thank you brother
[19:53] amen God has a plan and a program but
[19:57] all of these things are hidden mysteries
[19:58] is that Satan can't understand how you
[20:01] are being built up into the image of
[20:03] Christ yes you see why he wants to take
[20:06] away the revelation of your word so that
[20:09] you don't have faith because Faith now
[20:11] when it's tried brings forth patience
[20:13] but let patience have a perfect work be
[20:16] patient in your problem be patient in
[20:18] your trial thank you endure because

[20:41] lack what does wanting nothing mean I'm
[20:44] not going to be in
[20:48] lack if any of you lack wisdom let him
[20:52] ask of God you see where he's going back
[20:54] to you need wisdom but if you lack
[20:58] wisdom no problem let him ask of God
[21:02] hallelujah amen amen how many you want
[21:04] to ask God for wisdom amen Lord give me
[21:06] wisdom how to handle my trial my
[21:08] situation my circumstance oh God my my
[21:11] path in life what I have to do in this
[21:13] life what you've called me for Lord
[21:16] reveal your mind to me give me wisdom
[21:19] am thank you Lord if any of you lack
[21:22] wisdom let him ask of God that give it
[21:24] to all men
[21:27] liberally and iaid it not and it shall
[21:31] be given him so if you ask now by faith
[21:36] it shall be given you maybe you walked

[21:41] now you walk out of the service a wise
[21:44] person amen full of spiritual wisdom
[21:47] amen thank you Lord thank you Lord but
[21:50] let him ask in faith nothing wavering
[21:53] don't waver now when you're asking for
[21:55] he that waver is like a wave of the sea
[21:58] driven with wind and toss for let not
[22:01] that man think that he shall receive
[22:02] anything of the Lord a double-minded man
[22:05] is unstable in all his ways amen so
[22:09] every person must be tested every Son of
[22:11] God must be tested you must go to your
[22:15] place of trying amen when God had taken
[22:18] Abraham amen and called him out and he
[22:20] had to take him to his place of trying
[22:23] the very promise that he told him you'll
[22:25] have a son that was his place of trying
[22:27] because the son son that he waited for
[22:29] for 25
[22:31] years oh
[22:33] yes after many years now you must
[22:35] sacrifice that son place of
[22:39] trying what if you've been praying for
[22:42] this job for this something in your life
[22:46] and then God tells you sacrifice that
[22:49] thing what are you going to do your
[22:51] dream job your dream car your dream
[22:55] house your dream whatever and God says
[22:58] sacrifice that thing can you trust God
[23:02] enough to say you know the plan for me
[23:05] Jeremiah 29 you know the plan for me so
[23:09] if you say sacrifices I sacrifice it
[23:12] amen nothing
[23:14] wavering praise the Lord amen so you
[23:18] must be tried you will go through trials
[23:21] you now when you're going to trials it's
[23:24] not you don't take it as a personal
[23:26] attack on you it is not you that God is

[23:39] Faith any man that cometh to God must
[23:42] first believe that he is and he's a
[23:44] rewarder of them that diligently seek

[36:06] they hand you a license without testing
[36:08] you to see if you can drive on the road

[37:23] patience right Faith worth patience
[37:27] anybody who has lost their

[37:48] patience none of us praise the Lord
[37:52] hallelujah thank you
[37:54] Lord anybody so I know mother's lose
[37:57] their patience quite easily with the
[37:59] children children have the tendency to
[38:02] work on the mother's
[38:04] nerves praise the Lord I know all your
[38:06] mothers have angelic children here but
[38:09] you're going to
[38:10] learn praise the
[38:15] Lord when I ask a question it's not to
[38:18] condemn you so if anybody has lost their
[38:20] patience in life I want to see your
[38:22] hands because we're talking about this
[38:25] amen hallelujah very patient brother
[38:27] here amen they don't even lose patience
[38:29] here praise the Lord praise the Lord
[38:32] praise the
[38:38] Lord so you've lost your patience so
[38:41] when the test and the trial was going on
[38:44] in your life and you lost your patience
[38:47] what happened instead of your thoughts
[38:49] being on the word of God your focus was
[38:52] taken away to focus on the problem and
[38:56] you didn't look to the source of all
[38:58] wisdom you didn't go to the spirit of
[39:01] wisdom and you focus on the situation
[39:04] you focus on your child you focus on
[39:06] that person and you lost
[39:08] patience so patience couldn't do their
[39:11] perfect work
[39:14] amen so instead of you coming Victorious
[39:16] out of that
[39:18] situation you came out frustrated out of
[39:21] that situation you came out defeated
[39:23] after that situation and many times you
[39:26] had to put your tail between your legs
[39:28] and go back and apologize for that
[39:30] situation where you lost your patience
[39:34] amen hallelujah now you have to go eat
[39:37] Humble Pie I'm sorry brother I didn't
[39:39] mean to do
[39:41] this but if you remained in
[39:45] patience don't be quick to answer a fool
[39:48] the Bible
[39:49] says don't answer a fool according to
[39:52] his folly the Bible says hallelujah
[40:00] so instead of your mind being fixed on
[40:01] the word of God what are you looking at
[40:04] what this person is doing to you what
[40:05] this thing is doing to you what this
[40:07] person is saying to you what this one is
[40:09] doing and what that one is doing you
[40:11] spend your entire life in Warfare
[40:14] engaged in fleshly battles and Satan is
[40:18] sitting back and laughing because you're
[40:20] losing your patience with
[40:23] everyone am praise the Lord
[40:31] so what happens in impatience you speak
[40:34] the wrong
[40:36] words now you are Sons and Daughters of
[40:39] God and your words carry power when you
[40:42] are in impatience you speak the wrong
[40:44] words even things you didn't want to
[40:47] confess with your mouth you start
[40:48] confessing you tell the child things you
[40:51] shouldn't say you speak over them and
[40:53] you say things you tell that friend of
[40:55] yours or that colleague of yours you
[40:57] utter words or maybe even a stranger
[40:59] that that's aen come up against you and
[41:01] your anger and you're not in patience
[41:04] you're not in
[41:06] control and you speak
[41:09] words amen hallelujah so what is that
[41:13] fear you're not working in faith you're
[41:15] working in fear you are so fearful amen
[41:19] that you feel you need to control now
[41:20] and the Lord is telling you shut your
[41:22] mouth and you say no Lord I want to show
[41:25] them I want to give them a piece of my
[41:26] mind
[41:29] and the Lord is saying stay
[41:32] still stay
[41:34] still but
[41:36] [Music]
[41:38] no Bush knife Bobby is
[41:42] back
[41:44] amen you're not in
[41:48] patience Hallelujah so people lose
[41:51] battles when they lose patience if
[41:54] you've lost battles in your life it's
[41:56] because you didn't remain in patience
[41:58] Hallelujah people who win battles are
[42:01] those who have overcome
[42:04] impatience people who win battles are
[42:07] those who remain imp patience
[42:11] am so give you a very simple example
[42:14] somebody learning to play the
[42:16] keyboard what does it require lot of
[42:19] practice and a lot of patience amen you
[42:23] went out you bought yourself a organ and
[42:25] you got yourself something classes maybe
[42:28] you bought a guitar and the teacher told
[42:30] you play the string now and you're
[42:31] playing
[42:32] tingting
[42:37] tingting amen but you've got to remain
[42:40] in
[42:40] patience because it's a process I don't
[42:43] if you picked up the guitar and you were
[42:45] skillful the first
[42:47] day
[42:49] amen praise the
[42:52] Lord so you're playing till your fingers
[42:55] bleed all day you're practicing this one
[42:58] thing but if you
[43:01] continue in the faith if you continue in
[43:06] patience amen if you do not
[43:08] quit amen you and you start to grow in
[43:12] patience and you diligently keep
[43:14] practicing and you remain in patience
[43:16] and you keep practicing and you keep
[43:18] practicing you will reach your end goal
[43:22] and you will learn how to play the
[43:23] guitar or you'll learn how to play the
[43:25] keyboard people who are have stopped
[43:27] learning to play an instrument or pursue
[43:30] anything in their lives are people who
[43:32] have gone into
[43:34] impatience if you took up something and
[43:37] you quit have away is because you
[43:39] remained in
[43:44] impatience praise the Lord I hope you
[43:48] can see the deeper thing here if you
[43:50] don't attain perfect faith is because
[43:51] you were in
[43:54] impatience what I'm trying to tell you
[43:58] amen praise the Lord I know all of you
[44:00] want me to quit
[44:02] now
[44:03] hey you saying maybe this brother is
[44:06] going to go deeper now and ask me other
[44:08] questions amen praise the Lord amen now
[44:12] let's not be people who want me to close
[44:16] because you're not
[44:17] [Laughter]
[44:21] patient remain imp
[44:23] patience praise the
[44:25] Lord amen I pray this is helping
[44:28] somebody tonight am amen praise the Lord
[44:33] amen American runner must remain in
[44:37] patience I don't know why they want to
[44:39] run from Peter mburg to
[44:42] Duran but they must remain in
[44:45] patience
[44:47] Hallelujah if they want to go that is
[44:49] why Paul says keep your eye on the
[44:52] prize and didn't he say the race is not
[44:55] to the Swift in the I think it's in
[44:58] Proverbs the race is not to the
[45:01] Swift right so you got to
[45:03] endure amen you press on to the mark of
[45:06] the eye calling praise the
[45:08] Lord so patience is going to lead you to
[45:11] spiritual
[45:12] maturity amen
[45:15] hallelujah so how many times when you
[45:17] are believing the Lord and you're
[45:18] believing in the promise and the Lord
[45:20] said don't open your mouth you still
[45:21] want to open your mouth the Lord says
[45:23] give me praise and thanksgiving in the
[45:25] situation but then you In Fear And you
[45:28] speak doubt and negativity the Lord says
[45:31] remain in praise and thanksgiving but
[45:33] and remain Amen in using your mouth to
[45:36] bless my name hold your
[45:38] peace but you screamed out in anxiety
[45:41] and worry and
[45:45] fear and now did that turn worry fear
[45:48] and anxiety turned into Victory no amen
[45:51] so testing of Faith produces patience
[45:53] spiritual muscles called patience
[45:56] spiritual muscle

[49:21] injections she went for it because of
[49:22] patience she knew what she was going to
[49:24] bring forth into the world
[49:28] if they told

[50:17] months maybe a year or two years she'll

[50:32] child she remains in
[50:35] patience so we said Temptation the
[50:38] intention of Temptation is to make you
[50:40] fall into a trap amen but a test is that
[50:43] you should not fail but that you should
[50:46] pass the test so that God can promote
[50:48] you to the next level so exams and test
[50:51] trials that we face in this life are for
[50:54] taking us to the next level of glory
[50:56] amen amen amen yes every student goes
[51:00] through test exams and those that get
[51:02] good marks are promoted to the next
[51:04] level amen
[51:06] hallelujah that's what a test is for so
[51:09] we've got to have a Victor's mindset and
[51:11] not a victim mindset somebody say I've
[51:14] got to have a Victor's
[51:15] mindset oh come on some of you need to
[51:17] speak this words I need to have a
[51:20] Victor's
[51:21] mindset and not a victim's mindset I
[51:25] don't now I don't want you to all this
[51:27] but I want you to understand what I'm
[51:28] saying forget about your past where you
[51:30] came from your circumstance and stop
[51:33] having a victim's
[51:35] mindset amen if you want you've got all
[51:37] the reason to have a victim's mindset
[51:39] because the Bible says we were born in
[51:41] sin shaped in iniquity came into the
[51:44] world speaking lies our first birth was
[51:47] cursed so we can choose to have a
[51:49] victim's mindset and live under the
[51:51] curse or we can come under the Victor's
[51:53] mindset and rise above the curse amen
[51:57] amen amen yes Lord praise the Lord amen
[52:02] hallelujah amen so when you're tested
[52:04] you get patience patience amen should be
[52:06] you should endure in patience patience
[52:08] should have a work in you because when a
[52:10] person stays in patience does not give
[52:12] up he's passing the test amen he will
[52:15] not only meet amen the end result but he
[52:18] will be perfected read that scripture
[52:20] again patience will lead you to
[52:21] Perfection amen we've remained patient
[52:24] for how long now patience is leading us
[52:27] to our Perfection amen your test is not
[52:30] to kill you your test is to improve you
[52:33] your test is to bring you to
[52:35] Perfection to show that you are not a
[52:38] weak
[52:39] son amen hallelujah so the the one who
[52:43] remains in patience is the one who
[52:44] remains on cause the one who is steady
[52:47] amen amen the one who can endure extreme
[52:50] pressure amen the one who can remain in
[52:54] love that's what I was going to say
[52:57] that a mother because of love she goes
[52:59] through all of that because of
[53:04] love and what does the Bible say there
[53:06] in James you will lack
[53:09] nothing if you have spiritual wisdom you
[53:12] will lack nothing because what are
[53:14] finances if you got
[53:16] wisdom then you'll know how to operate
[53:18] with
[53:20] finances hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[53:25] any area in your life
[53:26] if you got spiritual wisdom why you
[53:29] think Paul talking to the most mature
[53:31] Church he's saying I I think of you day
[53:33] and night I've not ceased to pray for
[53:36] you but when I'm praying for you I'm
[53:38] asking for the Lord to give you the
[53:40] spirit of
[53:42] wisdom did David ask for it did Daniel
[53:46] ask for it we read Daniel chapter 2
[53:49] there amen so lacking in nothing you're
[53:52] lacking in nothing tell somebody I'm
[53:54] lacking in
[53:55] nothing I can't believe that we will be
[53:57] sitting here tonight to say that we are
[53:59] lacking in the word I can't believe that
[54:02] after the message of the hour has come
[54:04] Revelation 10:7 has come Malachi 4:5 and
[54:07] 6 has sounded amen that we can lack
[54:11] anything the word is our source we are
